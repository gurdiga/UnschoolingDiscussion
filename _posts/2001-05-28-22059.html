<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335784467">I want to apologize to the moderator (and all those non-quilters out there who don&#39;t appreciate the quilt posts). I know that this is an unschooling list and I&#39;ll try to keep my comments to that topic. It&#39;s just nice to find out that we have more in common than unschooling our kids. So, before I am &quot;fussed at&quot; or reminded, I just want to say that I&#39;m sorry--my posts got a little out of hand, because it&#39;s a subject close to my heart. <br/>
<br/>
If this is a problem, I will make an effort to watch my topics. I&#39;ve been on other lists that were almost strict about keeping to the list topic. Since I&#39;m new to this list, I don&#39;t know how the rest of you are about that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474646935">Thanks, Lisa! And you&#39;re right about the &quot;so many ways&quot; part! <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found funny is that lately my husband, who&#39;s still &quot;not real sure&quot; about this &quot;unschooling thing&quot;, is becoming more aware of just how much we teach our children, sometimes without even meaning to. They have convinced him to build them a treehouse. I suggested he include them in the planning stage as well....and left it at that. He came to his own conclusion that they&#39;d learn math--addition, subtraction, variables, angles, etc. without me pointing it out....maybe there&#39;s hope for him yet.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713194521">Okay, Molly, just curious, but why fat quarters if you don&#39;t quilt? I didn&#39;t even know about fat quarters before I started quilting. I just bought fabric by the yard or 1/2 yard. <br/>
<br/>
If you ever decide to have a fabric sale, give me a call! No such thing as too much of a good thing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982157681">Helen, come on, about time you &#39;fessed up!<br/>
<br/>
Hand or machine? I visited the quilt guild my mil goes to once a month--talk about &quot;quilt snobs&quot;! If you don&#39;t hand quilt, they look down their noses at you, but then again, most of them look like they are past the age of raising three very active children....KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
Traditional blocks or newer, geometric ones? Personally, I like some of the traditional ones, but am always looking for designs that have a little &quot;punch&quot; in them, something different. I bought a neat pattern book yesterday at a flea market for $4!! (Yes, I practically stole it!) It has southwest designs in it, but I thought of using floral fabric instead of the regular southwest stuff. It&#39;ll make it look totally different. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450817319">Watercolor quilts are THE most amazing! It is so impressive how someone can take a bunch of fabric and turn into almost into a photograph! I&#39;ve seen some gorgeous ones in my quilt magazines. I&#39;d love to see your designs. I&#39;ve found out that I enjoy the planning and piecing stages, but not necessarily the actual quilting and finishing. I really love modifying existing designs and creating my own. I hope that doesn&#39;t mean that I won&#39;t finish most of what I start....that&#39;s a bad trait I have already. <br/>
<br/>
The first weekend in April this year was the Annual Mennonite Churches Relief Show and Sale in Hutchinson, KS, about an hour from me. Last year, I wasn&#39;t that interested--this year it rained most of the time. Bummer! <br/>
<br/>
The Mennonite churches in this area (and there are tons) have their ladies make quilts year round (by hand, of course) to donate to this auction and then give the money to charities. The quilts go on view on Friday and bidding starts on that Saturday. They raise several thousands of dollars--the quilts themselves bring anywhere from $500 to $4500 each! And they usually have a minimum of about 500 quilts on display! <br/>
<br/>
Most of the quilts are traditional, but there are quite a variety as well. Next year, *nothing* will stop me!  I can leave the checkbook home--I don&#39;t have that kind of money!! BUT I&#39;m bringing my camera!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping my mil and I can go to the &quot;big&quot; show in Houston in November...hubby is saving his pennies---he says it&#39;ll be our Christmas present if he can afford it! What a sweetheart! Pretty understanding fellow--raised by a quilter and married to a quilter. He tolerates our fabric, books, tools, and all the other little things that are just a *necessity* for this expensive love affair with quilting! Nothing about it is cheap!But, like I tell him--he buys Craftsman tools, because you want quality so it&#39;ll last and you have to have one of everything, so you can have the right tool for the job....that&#39;s just like quilters!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135003452">Terry, first welcome on your newness. The basic attitude of this list is anything goes as long as you aren&#39;t personally attacking people. If you keep the subject appropriate to the post, anyone not interested in the subject will probably just delete it. another note, quilting does apply to unschooling. Unschooling is a lifestyle and I consider my education part of unschooling also, not just my children. If I delight in learning something new, my children see and learn from that also.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I want to apologize to the moderator (and all those non-quilters out there<br/>
who don&#39;t appreciate the quilt posts). I know that this is an unschooling<br/>
list and I&#39;ll try to keep my comments to that topic. It&#39;s just nice to find<br/>
out that we have more in common than unschooling our kids. So, before I am<br/>
&quot;fussed at&quot; or reminded, I just want to say that I&#39;m sorry--my posts got a<br/>
little out of hand, because it&#39;s a subject close to my heart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If this is a problem, I will make an effort to watch my topics. I&#39;ve been<br/>
on other lists that were almost strict about keeping to the list topic.<br/>
Since I&#39;m new to this list, I don&#39;t know how the rest of you are about that.<br/>

become the target of my quilting questions. You see... I am on a &quot;due <br/>
date list&quot; for my son, born in &#39;96. At one point, we did a quilt <br/>
block exchange, where each square had our child&#39;s handprint on it. So <br/>
now I&#39;ve got like 60 of these squares and NO idea of how to put them <br/>
together into a beautiful quilt. So, any of you avid quilters - how <br/>
would you get started? I have to admit I am craft-impaired and I <br/>
don&#39;t know how to sew. My husband sews, but he won&#39;t volunteer to do <br/>
the quilt project. We&#39;ve got a heavy duty sewing machine (for making <br/>
parachute harnesses) that I suppose I could figure out how to use. If <br/>
you&#39;ve got some links or advice for me, I&#39;d love to hear it...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Robin......A quilt is basicaly three layers. Top<br/>
Bottom , and a middle of batting, can be commercial,<br/>
natural, or even and old blanket, or another old<br/>
quilt, or for summer use, just another piece of<br/>
fabric.  <br/>
<br/>
For your handprints you may want to make a &quot;hanging:<br/>
instead of a bed cover.  The pictures will last much<br/>
longer, and as the back is not for viewing, you don&#39;t<br/>
have to be so carefull.  <br/>
<br/>
To piece the pieces together you can just sew the<br/>
edges together on the wrong sides or add pieces betwen<br/>
the squares to make a pattern of your choice.   When<br/>
you have a all of the pieces included layer this &quot;top&quot;<br/>
on the batting you have chosen and the backing.  For a<br/>
backing muslin works well as it is easy to push a<br/>
needle through.  When this is all situated to please<br/>
you either baste or pin it in place.  or if it is<br/>
small enough skip that.For a really &quot;quick and easy&quot;<br/>
quilt just &quot;tie&quot; the layers together.  You can use a<br/>
really big needle and yarn or an embroidery needle and<br/>
use embroidery floss or crochette thread ( I like<br/>
crochette thread becuase I can see it easily).  Poke<br/>
the needle through from the top to the bottom, turn<br/>
and poke it back up.  Tie a knot.  One that doesn&#39;t<br/>
come undone! If you are makeing a hanging you can tie<br/>
or sew on beads or buttons or charms or other little<br/>
keepsakes.  For a bedcover these would be lumpy.  When<br/>
you have decided that it will stay together OK. Sew<br/>
soemthing around the edges to keep the batting (middle<br/>
layer) from sticking out.  This can be as simple<br/>
(prefolded quilt binding....from notions section of<br/>
fabric store) or a complicated as you like. Just sew<br/>
(ha!) it covers all the raw edges.<br/>
<br/>
Think of a giant pot holder.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

&gt; Dear Robin......A quilt is basicaly three layers. Top<br/>

&gt; on the batting you have chosen and the backing.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide you need another fabric between each block...take a look at a<br/>
quilt book at the library or fabric store.  You&#39;ll probably find some<br/>
pictures of quilts that look like a grid with &#39;picture&#39; squares between the<br/>
lines.  When I&#39;m making this type of quilt I find the hardest part is<br/>
finding a single fabric that looks good with all the different squares.<br/>
So, here&#39;s my tip &lt;drum roll, please!  &lt;G&gt; &gt;  Take the squares with you to<br/>
the fabric store.  Pick out several fabrics that you like and think might go<br/>
with the handprint squares (or most of them!).  Then ask the nice ladies at<br/>
the fabric store if you can use an empty cutting table.  (I&#39;ve never had<br/>
them refuse and you&#39;ll probably even get lots of help!  &lt;G&gt;)  Lay out a<br/>
couple of yards of the bolts of fabric on the table, spreading them out one<br/>
at a time.  Lay your squares on top of the fabric in very random order (you<br/>
aren&#39;t finishing the quilt at this time).  When you find the one you like,<br/>
buy it!  Don&#39;t try to analyze why you like or if it&#39;s the &#39;right&#39; fabric.<br/>
If you like it at first glance, you&#39;ll love it when it is finished.<br/>
<br/>
What has surprised me about this is how often I go for a dark color for the<br/>
lattice work (the strips between squares).  It seems to set off each square<br/>
so they are all pleasant individually and collectively.<br/>
<br/>
Then proceed as Sharon suggested.  I would definitely consider tying this<br/>
quilt rather than traditionally quilting it.  OTOH it depends on your<br/>
ultimate goal.  If you have a desire to learn how to &#39;quilt&#39; this is a great<br/>
time to do so.  Pick a design (or several) that you like and quilt them on<br/>
the lattice between squares.  If your desire is simply to finish the quilt,<br/>
go with tied!  If you&#39;re quick about it, you can have the whole thing<br/>
finished in a weekend...a week if you&#39;re persistent but have to work on it<br/>
in small pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Any beginning quilting book can give you pictures about how to do this.<br/>
Don&#39;t buy one at this point unless it&#39;s something you&#39;ll want to be doing<br/>
for a long time, though!  It&#39;s too addictive!  Your local library is bound<br/>
to have something.  Or you can look it up on the internet using a search<br/>
engine and &#39;how to make a quilt&#39; or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
