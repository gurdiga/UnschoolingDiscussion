<h4>Nancy from MI</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7366808">Just about two months ago, I took away TV for two weeks from my<br/>
almost nine-year-old daughter as a punishment for something (I forget <br/>
what, now). Anyhow, the most unexpected thing happened. Since then, <br/>
she **rarely** asks to turn it on! She is always walking around with<br/>
a book in her hand. She gets a huge stack of books every week at the <br/>
library and reads every single one of them! Now, she liked to read <br/>
before, but she loves, LOVES, L-O-V-E-S to read now. She told me she <br/>
stills loves TV, and always will, but that books are her &quot;favorite&quot; <br/>
thing. This, from a girl who picked out slippers from KMart that <br/>
looked like two huge TV remote controls and wore them so much that in <br/>
less than four months she wore the bottoms right off! <br/>
