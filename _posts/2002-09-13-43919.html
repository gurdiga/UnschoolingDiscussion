&lt;&lt; Do you call your husband Keith to the kids? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  <br/>
I could say &quot;your dad,&quot; but they know he&#39;s their dad, and he&#39;s not MY dad, so <br/>
I don&#39;t call him &quot;dad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[the other day when I responded to a quoted part of this, I didn&#39;t know there <br/>
was a first part]<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or do <br/>
you call him Keith even when you are talking to the kids? Do your kids call <br/>
you and Keith, Sandra and Keith, or Mom and Dad? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I call them all their names.  Keith and I never came up with any &quot;sweetie&quot; or <br/>
&quot;honey&quot; forms of address.  <br/>
<br/>
He says to the kids &quot;your mom&quot; as in &quot;Go ask your mom&quot; &lt;g&gt; or &quot;Is your mom <br/>
ready to go?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I say Keith.<br/>
<br/>
When they were little we did combo names sometimes.  Partly because of the <br/>
SCA and people they know having two names.  But come to think of it, my adult <br/>
friends do that sometimes, because we have three Marks and two Jeffs, and <br/>
we&#39;ll say &quot;Jeff-Artan&quot; or &quot;Koris-Mark&quot; in a conversation to avoid the &quot;which <br/>
one?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so I&#39;d say &quot;Daddy Keith&quot; to little kids so they&#39;d get both connections.  <br/>
But at events it was &quot;Daddy Gunwaldt&quot; or &quot;Keith Gunwaldt.&quot;   Not right out <br/>
loud, but just when giving information to a child about who was going to do <br/>
something or where someone was.<br/>
