concerns are not schooling or not-schooling, they are, needless to say,<br/>
parenting. For a fast track on unschooling, I believe you will learn more<br/>
from books by John Holt than from any other source.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, this list has recently discussed the idea of un-preschooling,<br/>
and it seemed to me that it was a good subject for a few new books to help<br/>
new parents prepare for unschooling as a way of life. Maybe you could write<br/>
one of them, as you learn from your babies.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree...schooling is part of parenting -- no matter what kind of <br/>
schooling your child gets you can&#39;t seperate the two...Of course I know that <br/>
my children&#39;s immediate needs need to be taken care of.  However, I belong to <br/>
email lists that support the type of parent I want to be.  I don&#39;t expect to <br/>
post here about the fact that my 10 month old woke up 8 times last night.  <br/>
However, to say that because my children are younger means I shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
concerned with their schooling is absolutely inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
In the area that I live, there are waiting lists a year in advance for the <br/>
&quot;right&quot; preschool.  There is legislation being promoted to make preschool <br/>
mandatory.  There are 3 yr waiting lists for the &quot;right&quot; (private) elementary <br/>
schools.  If I were to send my child to preschool and elementary school I&#39;d <br/>
be making those plans now...with my 2 1/2 yr old for next year as we would be <br/>
paying for private school.  Why shouldn&#39;t I make the same plans and get ideas <br/>
now for unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, at what age then do I &quot;begin&quot; unschooling if my children never <br/>
go to schoool?  It only applies when they are 5 or 6?  You can&#39;t unschool a 2 <br/>
yr old?   From what I understand, unschooling is about allowing your child to <br/>
progress and be interested in things at his own pace. Maybe I should fill his <br/>
days with swimming lessons and gymboree and art classes and gymnastics and <br/>
foreign language like so many of my friends instead of being home with him <br/>
all day.  Maybe I should be prepping him for preschool interviews.<br/>
<br/>
Formal school education is starting younger and younger.  Parents are <br/>
terribly afraid that if they don&#39;t give their children the right start even <br/>
before preschool age they may never catch up.  I find myself constantly doing <br/>
mental gymnastics...&quot;Andrew is smart for his age...should I teach him to <br/>
read?&quot; &quot;Maybe he should go to preschool just to play with other kids&quot; and on <br/>
and on.<br/>
<br/>
So forgive me if the advice to just let your child play doesn&#39;t quite get it <br/>
for me.  Maybe it is the world I move in but education is not simply <br/>
relegated to the &quot;I&#39;ll think about it when he turns four&quot; catagory anymore.  <br/>
Most of the children my son&#39;s age (yes he&#39;s 2 and 4 months) are already in <br/>
some type of program.  And these are not daycare children but ones with stay <br/>
at home moms.  I&#39;m already doing something unusual by not making those plans.<br/>
<br/>
When my boys are older I will hopefully take your advice about a book about <br/>
unschooling...but not just about preschool (although that is an intriguing <br/>
idea)...rather for those who never sent their children to school to begin <br/>
with.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I disagree...schooling is part of parenting -- &gt;&gt;<br/>

Unschoolers don&#39;t &quot;school&quot; though.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Why shouldn&#39;t I make the same plans and get ideas <br/>
now for unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because unschooling is not like going to private school.<br/>
It&#39;s like NOT going to school.  And not bringing school home.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Furthermore, at what age then do I &quot;begin&quot; unschooling if my children never <br/>
go to schoool?  It only applies when they are 5 or 6?  You can&#39;t unschool a 2 <br/>

<br/>
There are different theories.  If you have a stimulating home and a good <br/>
relationship with your baby, that&#39;s wonderful whether or not he will go to <br/>
school later, and he will learn more and more happily if you care and really <br/>
be WITH  him in all kinds of ways.   <br/>
<br/>
But many parents of pre-schoolers destined for school do that with their <br/>
children too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe I should fill his <br/>
days with swimming lessons and gymboree and art classes and gymnastics and <br/>
foreign language like so many of my friends instead of being home with him <br/>
all day.  Maybe I should be prepping him for preschool interviews.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s saying that.  But if you think of yourself as <br/>
&quot;schooling&quot; him it will be more difficult to be comfortable NOT schooling him.<br/>
<br/>
Words have power.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So forgive me if the advice to just let your child play doesn&#39;t quite get <br/>
it <br/>
for me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always just let my children play, and they&#39;re 10, 13 and 16.  I play <br/>
with them.  We play at the grocery store, we play with ideas, we play with  <br/>
music and words and tools.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When my boys are older I will hopefully take your advice about a book about <br/>
unschooling...but not just about preschool (although that is an intriguing <br/>
idea)...rather for those who never sent their children to school to begin <br/>
with.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Advice about reading a book? (You didn&#39;t quote anything about a book.)<br/>
<br/>
Reading a book now would probably be good.  The way children learn later is <br/>
the way they learn when they&#39;re younger.  Knowing more about learning <br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly hurt .<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Advice about reading a book? (You didn&#39;t quote anything about a book.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Writing a preschooling &quot;unschooling&quot; book had been the suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s saying that. But if you think of yourself as <br/>
&quot;schooling&quot; him it will be more difficult to be comfortable NOT schooling <br/>
him. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think you missed my point here...I don&#39;t think in terms of schooling them <br/>
especially for preschool (maybe I should have said learning.)  But all of the <br/>
people I&#39;m surrounded by IRL are actively pursuing their children&#39;s education <br/>
even at the age of 2.  So for someone to say that I shouldn&#39;t be concerned <br/>
with education (or schooling vs. unschooling as the original post referred <br/>
to) because of my children&#39;s age is a bit disconcerting.  I&#39;m trying to learn <br/>
what unschooling is exactly and how it works in day to day life...I&#39;ve read <br/>
more books than anyone could possibly imagine about how and why babies and <br/>
children learn.  I know my children are not going to school.  The question <br/>
now is what is the best way for them to learn from home.  I discovered this <br/>
list from reading Unschooling books and from parenting lists.  The idea of <br/>
natural learning is the best I&#39;ve learned about...which only makes sense <br/>
seeing as how it is natural.  I do have idea of the basics but now I hope to <br/>
see how it works in people&#39;s real lives.  My instinct however great <br/>
unschooling sounds would be more lesson based.  So I want to change my <br/>
thinking before they get older...I don&#39;t want to wait until they are &quot;school <br/>
aged.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My point then was this:  Even though my children are young I feel like I can <br/>
learn from this list.  So that when they get to be 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 it won&#39;t <br/>
feel strange to continue on the way we have been all along.  I would hate to <br/>
feel that since I don&#39;t need to be concerned (therefore don&#39;t belong??)  with <br/>
it now I can just forget about it and come back in 3 yrs.<br/>

<br/>
That was my own point.  <br/>
You can&#39;t keep a two year old from learning.<br/>
It does not good to talk or think about &quot;schooling&quot; him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I do have idea of the basics but now I hope to <br/>
see how it works in people&#39;s real lives. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s it working in YOUR real life?  Don&#39;t the kids learn from playing?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I would hate to <br/>
feel that since I don&#39;t need to be concerned (therefore don&#39;t belong??)  with <br/>
it now I can just forget about it and come back in 3 yrs.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The point wasn&#39;t you didn&#39;t need to be concerned with their learning, but <br/>
that you didn&#39;t need to be concerned with the relationship to school, or <br/>
schooling, or UNschooling.  School doesn&#39;t ever need to be a factor for them <br/>
if they never go to school, but you seem perhaps to be living in the ghostly <br/>
structure of a school.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to avoid &quot;school&quot; and &quot;teach&quot; you&#39;ll be a lot closer to &quot;home&quot; and <br/>
&quot;learn.&quot;<br/>

about that.  He seemed to be deliberately muddying the waters about what&#39;s <br/>
unschooling and what&#39;s parenting in order to further his agenda.<br/>
There was some talk a while back about whether parents of kids younger than <br/>
school age should call themselves unschoolers.  I think that&#39;s because of <br/>
people who say they&#39;re unschooling their preschoolers and then send them <br/>
off to school.  I considered myself an unschooler when my son was preschool <br/>
age.  (I didn&#39;t realize then that I didn&#39;t quite &quot;get it&quot;, but that&#39;s <br/>
another story.)  I don&#39;t think anything really changes when a child reaches <br/>
school age if the parents are commited to helping the child learn what he <br/>
wants to learn.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll admit the thought did cross my mind once or twice....keep em out of <br/>
preschool and then send them to Montessori or Waldorf schools...but then I <br/>
read the Unschooling Handbook.<br/>
<br/>
However, here is an interesting story (its kind of long but it does have to <br/>
do with unschooling at the end):  On a parenting list I&#39;m on we all have <br/>
children born in 4/2000.  A discussion started about TV and videos and how <br/>
much to let them watch.  I forwarded the link about video games from Mary&#39;s <br/>
article (which I absolutely loved!)  So everyone agreed with that article -- <br/>
which astonished me.  Then I mentioned the rest of Sandra&#39;s website and how <br/>
it talks about unschooling.  There are several other mothers there who are <br/>
planning on homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, now the talk is all about how &quot;unschooling&quot; is what you do with your <br/>
kids after they get out of school.  A post said:  I plan to supplement my <br/>
children&#39;s education with &quot;unschooling&quot; projects from home.  HUH????  Where <br/>
did they ever get that idea?  Then the talk moved to letting a child have <br/>
control over their learning is creating problems for adults.  Plus, it&#39;s <br/>
irresponsible in thier minds.  One mother said she wasn&#39;t &quot;qualified&quot; to <br/>
teach her children herself.<br/>
<br/>
So my point is:  I can see how the terms can be bandied about and misuesd by <br/>
those who don&#39;t know what true unschooling is.  However, I do think you can <br/>
&quot;unschool&quot; a preschooler...especially when the kid who doesn&#39;t go to <br/>
preschool or be involved in structured activities is getting rare.<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you all this though:  we are moving on Friday...Andrew has <br/>
learned so much from this...how much will fit in a box, how will it fit if <br/>
you put it in neat vs. messy, how things like tvs and vcrs get unconnected, a <br/>
little can fits in that hole but a big one doesn&#39;t ect.  These things when <br/>
they happen, and I notice, are the things that convince me that unschooling <br/>
is the best and right thing.  (And just wait till the movers get here!)<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m getting him off to the right start now...I just need to <br/>
continue always doing what I am.  And somehow get the what if&#39;s out of my <br/>
mind (at least for the most part :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220770569">Yeah! That&#39;s unschooling! And yes, it is harder in some ways for those <br/>
of us with younger kids, because we get &quot;well, duh!&quot; sounding responses <br/>
sometimes, when we voice our concerns with younger ones.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the veterans don&#39;t have experience with unschooling younger <br/>
ones, because they didn&#39;t catch on until at least some of their kids had <br/>
gone to school. So they may have some trouble identifying with some of <br/>
the concerns.<br/>

I come from a very &quot;teacherly&quot; family and was noticing myself one day <br/>
thinking &quot;no, you have to write it like THIS&quot; when ds was writing an &quot;o&quot; <br/>
starting at the bottom, not the top. Then I caught myself and thought, <br/>
no, I don&#39;t have to do it the way that will best prepare him for school. <br/>
I can just say &quot;terrifc!&quot; to him and go on.<br/>

gone to school.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most of the veterans DO have experience with younger ones, either from not <br/>
having sent their kids to school at all, or only having sent the first one <br/>
for a little while.<br/>
<br/>
And though some people are from places (Delaware, Maryland) where <br/>
pre-kindergarten classes are seen as mandatory by their neighbors and <br/>
relatives, many of us are from places like New Mexico where kindergarten is <br/>
only lately required, or from states where it&#39;s not required at all.  So in <br/>
such places, the way children are treated until they&#39;re &quot;schoolage&quot; is the <br/>
same as unschooling entirely.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t consider myself to be unschooling any child until the day the state <br/>
expected him to be in school and didn&#39;t go.  But the things we did with Kirby <br/>
were no different than we would have done if he had been going to school.  <br/>
Knowing the boredom problems kids have who go to school already knowing what <br/>
school&#39;s going to drag them through (repeatedly) I was in NO hurry to teach <br/>
him anything fancy.  He was learning for fun, and then didn&#39;t go to school, <br/>
so there was no break in routine.<br/>
<br/>
I know the arguments for and against people &quot;unschooling&quot; babies and toddlers <br/>
and when kids don&#39;t go to school I don&#39;t really care whether the parents <br/>
claim to have been unschooling them since nine months before birth or not.  <br/>
But if anyone says &quot;we unschooled him until he was five and he went to <br/>
kindergarten,&quot; or &quot;we unschool him when he&#39;s not in nursery school&quot; or &quot;After <br/>
daycare, he&#39;s unschooled,&quot; then I think it&#39;s nonsense.  <br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s the problem, for me.  If a child isn&#39;t yet schoolage, the <br/>
difference between unschooling and just not being in school yet would, <br/>
ideally, be no difference at all.<br/>
