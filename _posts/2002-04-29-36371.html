 </span></blockquote>I should have said they come to an end. One person talking isn&#39;t a<br/>
converstaion. It&#39;s a monolog. And generally, inductively reasoning from past<br/>
behavior, people are looking for dialog.<br/>
<br/>
Though occasionally, and I&#39;ve observed this also, some people do keep<br/>
posting. Perhaps, theorizing here, because they just enjoy seeing their<br/>
words appear even if no one is responding. I&#39;ve never observed it to<br/>
continue for long. Though I can&#39;t recall if it always stopped spontaneously<br/>
or if it needed moderator intervention.<br/>
<br/>
One way or the other we will add another data point to our collection.<br/>

They might not!  I guess a theory with NO evidence or logic is as valid to <br/>
some people as one proven daily by personal experience.</div>
