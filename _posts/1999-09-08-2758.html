<div id="ygrps-yiv-532651184">Finally got a new modem up and running.  It got zapped by lightening <br/>
Saturday and was working intermittently since then.  Surge protection <br/>
protected the computer,  but the lightening came through the phone <br/>
line!  Aarrrrrrrgh!<br/>

I hope you didn&#39;t take offense at anything I wrote.  I was enjoying <br/>
the unschooling/unguided discussion.  I like to write and read <br/>
opinions because it helps me solidify my own beliefs.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes e-mail is tough because it can be so easily misinterpreted <br/>
without facial expressions, etc.  I felt there were strong opinions <br/>
expressed,  but I wasn&#39;t offended by anything you,  Carol, or Linda <br/>
said. I thought you were telling us how you do things and why.<br/>
 I thought Linda&#39;s opinions were strong,  not angry.  I thought Carol <br/>
was just asking a question - pondering how lists end up where they <br/>
do. Unschoolers,  as a group are questioners.  If we didn&#39;t <br/>
question almost everything,  we wouldn&#39;t question the &quot;school idea&quot; <br/>
down to it&#39;s very core.  Often,  we&#39;re quick to question somebody&#39;s <br/>
opinions or ideas. We&#39;re not satifisfied just to hear it and let it <br/>
be.   Part of our nature,  I guess.  Also,  we&#39;ve <br/>
probably all been put in the position of having to defend  what we do <br/>
over and over,  so sometimes it&#39;s second nature.<br/>
<br/>
Glad your going to stay.  I&#39;ll enjoy your contributions, as I do <br/>
Linda&#39;s, Carol&#39;s and the rest of the members.<br/>
