<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432448646">I&#39;m hoping someone here has some advice on this subject...<br/>
<br/>
My 14 yr old came to me yesterday with pages of information on navel <br/>
piercings. Seems she has read up on this and it&#39;s something she really wants <br/>
to have done.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about it and really have no objections other than the pain it&#39;s <br/>
probably going to bring but her dad is NOT happy about my agreeing to drive <br/>
her to get it done.<br/>
<br/>
I realize it&#39;s probably a passing thing.  Our oldest daughter (who was <br/>
schooled) got her tongue pierced her freshman year of college but after <br/>
probably six or eight months became bored with it and took it out.<br/>
<br/>
I figure it&#39;s summer, the neighborhood kids are on spring break, she sees <br/>
theirs, they look cool, she has a flat stomach and wants to get hers done <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
So do any of you have children/teens or yourselves with piercings other than <br/>
ears?  How much pain does it cause?  Is it hard to heal?  Infect easily?  Any <br/>
tips or pointers?<br/>
<br/>
I know this probably doesn&#39;t seem &quot;unschooly&quot; but it really is since she <br/>
spent the time to read about it, digest the information and it&#39;s something <br/>
she is really interested in.  I guess the concept is that EVERYTHING is <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything in particular I should look for in the piercing place <br/>
(other than autoclaved instruments of course)?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help if anyone has information they&#39;ve experienced.  I&#39;ve read <br/>
her information and there is lots of conflicting information about after <br/>
care, healing and such.<br/>

Tara has ner belly button pierced. She&#39;s been wanting it since she was 13.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t happening then. I needed her to have her dad say yes. My husband<br/>
and I were okay with it. It wasn&#39;t a passing fancy with her. When she was<br/>
16, she still wanted it done. She started to work on her dad and I did too<br/>
for her. We got him to reluctantly agree. It&#39;s been over a year and she<br/>
still wears various rings. It&#39;s cute and the jewelry she picks is cute also.<br/>
<br/>
Try to ask as many people as you can where they got piercings done from.<br/>
That&#39;s the best way to go, word of mouth. And don&#39;t just ask where but ask<br/>
how their piercing was after they had it done. Did they get an infection or<br/>
have any problems. A lot of times that has to do with how it&#39;s done.<br/>
Tara is a real baby when it comes to pain. She doesn&#39;t handle it well. She<br/>
was told it didn&#39;t really hurt that much. I was with her and held her hand,<br/>
when the needle went it, she turned as white as a ghost. I thought she would<br/>
faint. (she was laying down) But that fast she was fine. She said it hurt<br/>
worse than she expected but was over as soon as she felt it. She said it<br/>
didn&#39;t bother her after that except for pants maybe rubbing there until it<br/>
healed.<br/>
<br/>
Her&#39;s healed quick. She did everything she was supposed to. She soaked in<br/>
epson salts I think once a week, didn&#39;t keep playing with it like some do.<br/>
(a big no no) and used no alcohol. Way too drying and not necessary. All<br/>
according to the guy that did it. She only used antibacterial soap and also<br/>
took vitamin E by mouth and used it topically on the piercing every now and<br/>
then. Stay out of the sun for awhile and no beach. Hers healed before he<br/>
said it would and she was able to change the piercing after I think 2-3<br/>
months. He suggested she wait 6.<br/>
<br/>
I think I covered everything.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
My 16yo daughter just had her navel pierced a month or so ago.  She&#39;s still <br/>
asleep now (it&#39;s only 9am over here) but when she gets up, I&#39;ll ask her to <br/>
write about it so you can have the teens perspective of having gone through <br/>
it.  She did a LOT of research about it and we talked and thought about it <br/>
a lot before doing it.<br/>
<br/>
The reasons I finally felt okay about it were:<br/>
1. It is really her body and she should be able to decide.<br/>
2. She&#39;d done her research, even so far as to find the places that do <br/>
&#39;good, clean work&#39;.<br/>
3. She&#39;d taken the time to talk with me about it, in depth.  (easing my <br/>
concerns)<br/>
4. She&#39;s wanted one for quite some time and was starting to really get <br/>
serious about it.<br/>
5. She can always take it out and let it heal over if she changes her mind.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out to be no big deal - for me.  It was a HUGE deal for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-905351841">I have piercings, tounge and mutiples in my ears and Jason has his ears and nose. The belly button is not the most dangerous place(that would be the tounge) but it is up there. It can take a very long time to heal, and can become infected very easily. It also has a tendancy to push out - the body regects the piercing and will push the jewlery out of the body. One of my best friends is a body piercer and hates belly button peircings, try to talk women out of them all the time. But, if your daughter really wants it and is prepared, yes it will hurt, it will be sore for a long time. She HAS to follow the care instructions to the letter, that area is naturally dirty, it sweats alot, and seems to collect dirt. I say go ahead, I plan on getting mine done, as well as a few others, as soon as I&#39;m done nurcing. I would try to find a place that has licenced piercers. And has been doing body piercers for a long time. A place that has a seperate room for the piercings, ask for pictures of their work. Most places will not pierce people under 18, they may with a parents permision and you may need to sign a release form. One other thing, your daughter with the toung peircing, how soon after she had it done did she remove it? And did she have it done surgically or did she just take it out? If you have any other questions feel free to contact me. Rebecca<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I have my navel pierced.  I got it done about 6 years ago and it took <br/>
about a year to completely heal!  I don&#39;t know if this is normal, and I was <br/>
very careful about what rubbed on it and keeping it clean.  So unless your 14 <br/>
year old is extremely responsible, I would recommend waiting a few years... I <br/>
actually talked my friend&#39;s 15 year old into waiting just last year... I <br/>
don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with it, it just is a lot of maintenance <br/>
for a young teen!  Good luck!  My oldest is only 7 so I have a few more years <br/>
on that one!<br/>
