 I thought there was so much unschooling in it. Don&#39;t get so grown up that you forget what it is like to be a child. Don&#39;t get so caught up in providing for your children that they miss out on what they really need; your love and attention. Play games with your children. Take risks, have fun! Don&#39;t spend your life planning your children&#39;s lives and lose them in the process.  And remember, to live is an adventure!  <br/>

Thanks for posting this.  I am struggling with this issue myself.  <br/>
Caught between there are better things they can be doing and worried <br/>
it will encompass their whole lives!  I still restrict it because at <br/>
this time that is my comfort level.  But, I am letting go and letting <br/>
them watch much more than they could before.  A work in progress!  So <br/>
it is nice to hear it is working for you, maybe that will give me <br/>
more courage to let go even more.<br/>

 HI,<br/>
  The only television that is watched here is at noon when my 8 year <br/>
old watches &quot;Toad Patrol&quot; on ToonDisney and at 4:00p.m. to watch <br/>
Cyberchase and on Fridays the ToonDisney movies.<br/>
  Ofcourse my dh being a television addict watches at night.<br/>
 If I had my way there would be no television,because we enjoy(the <br/>
girls and I) reading more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I posted a little while back about lifting the tv restrictions in my <br/>
house.  I don&#39;t regret it for a minute!  I had already started <br/>
letting my daughter (just turned 6yo) watch more than I had before <br/>
when I started reading on this group.  So I may have been one step <br/>
ahead of you, but you are definitely going in a great direction.  <br/>
Yes, my daughter watches quite a bit of tv, but I am amazed at how it <br/>
gets her juices flowing.  <br/>
<br/>
Her mind is SO much MORE active all the time now.  She even tells me <br/>
about how she would have had the story end, or how she would have <br/>
acted in a certain situation.  Yesterday as I was sitting on the <br/>
couch and she was watching tv, one of the characters wrote a note <br/>
that had PS- at the end of it.  She asked me what that meant.  After <br/>
I explained it to her, I wondered when that gets introduced to <br/>
schooled children.<br/>
<br/>
Just little stuff like that all the time.  I love the <br/>
question about what Steven Spielburg would have become if his mom had <br/>
limited his tv viewing.  Or Bill Gates with the computer.  <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, just another vote in the &quot;To TV&quot; direction.  Take the <br/>
plunge!  The water&#39;s great!</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If there were a thread where parents were discussing children and allowing<br/>
unlimited free reading and you liked TV more would you say &quot;If we had my way<br/>
there would be no books because we enjoy watching TV more&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Apparently you feel that TV is a less useful way to spend time than reading<br/>
and you need to let people know that you feel superior (and perhaps relieved<br/>
so you don&#39;t have to deal with a love of something you dislike) because you<br/>
and your daughters don&#39;t like TV much.<br/>
<br/>
That feeling and the need to tell people about it is worth examining for<br/>
yourself. If you don&#39;t learn well physically would you post to a thread<br/>
about biking and skateboarding that &quot;If we had my way there would be no<br/>
bikes or skateboards because we enjoy books more&quot;? What would a statement<br/>
like that be for? What purpose does it serve? (Those are questions to ask<br/>
yourself.)<br/>
<br/>
TV is a resource. Books are a resource. Bikes are a resouce. They&#39;re there<br/>
to be used when they&#39;re useful and turned off or put away when people are<br/>
done with them.<br/>
<br/>
TV is also not a homogenous entity any more than books are. They both range<br/>
from sublime to trashy. The difference is that we get to pick and choose<br/>
books before we bring them into our homes. With TV we have to pick and<br/>
choose after the full range of choices comes into our homes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s perfectly legitimate to not like visual media if you don&#39;t learn<br/>
visually. Just as it&#39;s perfectly legitimate to not like books if someone<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to read. (Naturally doesn&#39;t like to read. Not doesn&#39;t like to<br/>
read because of bad experiences in school.) But it&#39;s worth asking yourself<br/>
why you need to tell a 1000+ people that you don&#39;t like something when<br/>
they&#39;re trying to deal with something their kids do like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515081090">Hi Julie<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still biding my time, with my 10 year old boy. He&#39;s still <br/>
in &quot;Mom&#39;s letting me watch/play computer THIS MUCH? I don&#39;t believe <br/>
it!&quot; Hubby had a little problem a few days ago, not wanting to let <br/>
him play computer for no reason (there was nothing else going on, he <br/>
just was getting edgy about how much &quot;screen time&quot; the child is <br/>
doing) and I told him &quot;It&#39;ll end. It&#39;s only been a month or less. <br/>
Let&#39;s give it some more time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have had a few days where my son chose Other Than TV/Computer <br/>
Games, so I figure, once the saturation level is hit, he&#39;ll get into <br/>
other things. Our committment to Natural Learning is only about a <br/>
month old, so I figure, we started Summer VAcation a little early! <br/>
Ain&#39;t gonna fret. *gulp*<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be saving your post, btw. Putting it in <br/>
my &quot;TV/Video/Computer&quot; bookmark. thanks!<br/>

We enjoy them both. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever classify my kids as <br/>
literature &quot;addicts&quot; just because they&#39;re drawn to reading LOTS of <br/>
books though. They go after many things with a passion. TV is just <br/>
one more learning tool in their lives.<br/>

And don&#39;t forget, for those dealing with lifting any restrictions at all,<br/>
that the saturation point can be so very different depending on the child<br/>
and the circumstances. So what might take one family a month to deal with in<br/>
a good balance may take another family 3 months.<br/>

<br/>
My kids were waiting for me to change my mind for a little while, not quite<br/>
believing it was going to be forever. I really tried to sit and watch with<br/>
them and that helped me heaps.<br/>
 My daughter went through a Pocohontas phase. She watched it 3-4 times a<br/>
day. I was getting worried then I sat down and watched it with her, really<br/>
watched it, and I saw what she loved.<br/>
A young girl full of life, excited by all the beauty of the world around<br/>
her. She wasn&#39;t scared of the unknown and she was full of courage to be true<br/>
to herself.<br/>
My daughter is only 4 and maybe she didn&#39;t get all that from the movie but<br/>
I&#39;m sure she got  some of it. And isn&#39;t that what we want for our daughters<br/>
(and sons!)?<br/>
Seeing that movies have the power to inspire huge things in our kids allowed<br/>
me to get excited with my kids and when I started bringing home movies for<br/>
them with excitement instead of resignation, I think they realized that I<br/>
wasn&#39;t going to change my mind and also that I wasn&#39;t resenting the time<br/>
they spent watching.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t fret!<br/>
And it&#39;s nice to know you&#39;re out there making changes like me. A lot of<br/>
people in my life are looking at me like I am ruining my kids.<br/>
