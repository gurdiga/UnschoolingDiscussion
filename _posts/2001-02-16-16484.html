&gt;.  The only thing they are currently pushing for someone your<br/>
&gt; age is the Hep B/A vaccines.<br/>
<br/>
Down here a 14 yo would also be pushed to get a tetanus booster (10 years after<br/>
the &quot;after the age of 4&quot;booster) and  especially a measles booster (some areas<br/>
even do an additional MMR  instead of just measles).     It is not considered<br/>
good cost/benefit  or risk/benefit to worrry about pregnancy tests on fertile<br/>
teens before mass immunizations.<br/>

In the UK children can turn these things down because the UK signed the
Children&#39;s Rights Act. I can&#39;t remember if the US did. If a child objects
to vaccinations and is given one against their will then it is &#39;assault&#39;
<br>Mind you, I would imagine that if it went to court then some uninformed
judge would rule that it was for the child&#39;s own good or that they were
&#39;too young to understand&#39;
<br>When my kids were in school I refused the Meningitis C vaccine for
them (they are all unvaccinated) and I asked the nurse about the Children&#39;s
Act. She said that if the kids knew about it then she&#39;d be in trouble.....
<br>It amazes me that the drug companies have developed the power to make
a govt rule that their medicines must be given compulsoryarily(sp). What&#39;s
next? Compulsory antibiotics because the world is full of bacteria? Prozac
so that no-one is unhappy?
<br>The mind boggles.

I do think that HSLDA  still has as a listed, important goal to prevent the US<br/>
ratifying the UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child---feeling it interferes with<br/>
parental ownership.<br/>
<br/>
From their website today under &quot;where HSLDA stands&quot;<br/>
&quot;    The UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child is an example of the UN&#39;s view of<br/>
the family. We have opposed the UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child because it<br/>
would strip parents of much of their authority to educate, train, and nurture<br/>
their children according to the dictates of their conscience.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282433317">Right now there is a huge shortage of tetanus vaccine in the U.S. so only<br/>
those that are high risk can get it. Those with burns and an infected wounds<br/>
are the ones &quot;allowed&quot; at tetanus shot. I guess one of two companies who<br/>
make it stopped and it takes 11 months to incubate more so supposedly it<br/>
will be awhile until available. Source: recent TV news.<br/>
