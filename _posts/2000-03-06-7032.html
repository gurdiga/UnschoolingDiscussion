<div id="ygrps-yiv-413424659">hi,<br/>
<br/>
you might want to look and see if you have return receipt checked.  i don&#39;t<br/>
thing i&#39;m getting doubles but i noticed that one of your message asked me for<br/>
a return receipt.  i&#39;m pretty much of a simpleton when it comes to things like<br/>
this.  sorry i can&#39;t be of more help.<br/>
