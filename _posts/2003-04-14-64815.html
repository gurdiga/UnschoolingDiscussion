 </span></blockquote>I have older children (and at the risk of posting TOO much, I will tell you <br/>
about how we handled these situations, keeping in mind they were not <br/>
homeschooled children, but I haven&#39;t changed that much in my philosophy of <br/>
child rearing that this might be of help).<br/>
<br/>
If they were going anywhere I had three questions, Who are you going with?  <br/>
When will you be back?  Where will you be?  Those are important questions, <br/>
they often led down paths the further needed to be discovered.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when one of them was adamant about going somewhere that I <br/>
knew was an unsafe place, were things would go on that I was not approving <br/>
of.  I didn&#39;t just say, well go ahead, your decision. BUT I didn&#39;t just say <br/>
no, because I said so and I&#39;m the mother.<br/>
<br/>
I would tell them it really is their choice, after all what can I do?  Tie <br/>
them to a chair, their bed?  Call the police?  BUT I would be VERY <br/>
disappointed if they made such a poor choice because I know they are much <br/>
smarter than to want to be _______________.  Then I would ask them to think <br/>
it over for an hour and let me know their decision.<br/>
<br/>
Are we allowed to be disappointed in our kids decisions?  Of course we are.  <br/>
Not for going to the mall or something innate like that.  But there are REAL <br/>
dangers out their that teenagers often think they can handle and often they <br/>
can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking about older teens, not 12 or 12 or maybe even 14 year olds.  At <br/>
those ages we pretty much were their way to get anywhere, after that, friends <br/>
drive, they know people, they get around.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my kids rethought their wanting to go and it was usually simply <br/>
because one of their friends was trying to persuade them to go and they knew <br/>
they shouldn&#39;t already.  Sometimes they went and sometimes they called me to <br/>
come get them and sometimes afterward they wished they had not went. (Like a <br/>
concert/festival in downtown DC where the bleachers collapsed and he took the <br/>
wrong metro train home at midnight and I had to drive 120 miles roundtrip to <br/>
pick him up because it was the last train of the night)  Sometimes things <br/>
happen and they just aren&#39;t prepared for it.  Not enough life experiences to <br/>
make some decisions quickly that need to be made.<br/>
<br/>
But I do know that if I simply said they were not going or demanded they stay <br/>
home it would never have worked because they would have immediately become <br/>
defensive and nothing would have stopped them from going, not even their own <br/>
thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a hard thing raising teenagers, some of them anyway.  But if they know <br/>
you love them and only want the very best for them it&#39;s easier for them to <br/>
accept your opinions.  My son once said to me that I am probably the only <br/>
person in the world that doesn&#39;t have some hidden agenda when it comes to <br/>
offering him advice.  Everyone else has a reason that is usually something to <br/>
do with getting what THEY want.  I only want what is best for them to grow up <br/>
happy and healthy and well.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you, I know this is a difficult time for you.<br/>
