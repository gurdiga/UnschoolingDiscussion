<div id="ygrps-yiv-612849565"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;No Work Garden<br/>
 </span></blockquote>maybe &quot;Lasagna Gardening?&quot; - have been using the &#39;method&#39; for a year or <br/>
so and it IS easy and very effective, too. It suits our style - not a lot <br/>
of work, pretty foolpfoof and LOTS of results<br/>
<br/>
For reading - have a look at Diana&#39; Gabaldon&#39;s series -<br/>
Outlander, Voyager, ( forget one title) and Dragonfly in Amber - 3 more <br/>
books to come. David got me the Companion to the series for Christmas and <br/>
acknowledged with a kiss that he was unlikely to get the chance again <br/>
until the book was devoured (hee hee).<br/>
Make sure your library has all volumes before starting - or get that <br/>
interlibrary loan thing going!  There is a site I like (clevermoms.com) <br/>
that has quite a few book discount coupon codes for Borders, B & N and so <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
David is reading Clive Cussler&#39;s newest novel - says it is almost as good <br/>
as the Dirk Pitt ones (new main character) and is on the 3rd Harry Potter <br/>
with our daughter Hannah.  14 year old son Davy - who started reading at <br/>
8 and a half - is now reading Lord of the Rings series again and <br/>
impatiently waiting for another David Eddings (read that ENTIRE series <br/>
twice, too).  Recently discovered a novel by David Drake, &quot;Lord of the <br/>
Isles&quot; and is scouting today for a prequel or sequel. I read it, too - <br/>
very good.  Armus is having us read him fish stuff fish stuff and more <br/>
fish stuff as he just started an aquarium.<br/>

I love these books!  I get completely engrossed while reading them, and <br/>
sometimes it takes me awhile to get back to &quot;real life&quot; when I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading for awhile.  <br/>
