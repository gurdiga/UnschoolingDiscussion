<div id="ygrps-yiv-596393666">How much is too much and how young is too young.<br/>
<br/>
My cousins were in town last weekend and a bunch of us unschooling moms got<br/>
together, one of whom my cousin brought over with her.<br/>
<br/>
This woman has 3 kids ages 2, 4 and 5.  She has the oldest child enrolled in<br/>
a charter school because &quot;it offers so much that he wanted.&quot;  The youngest<br/>
is enrolled in Kindergym, Kinderart and two or three more activities.  The 4<br/>
yo is going to ballet, gymnastics and four or five other activities.  The 5<br/>
yo not only has &quot;school&quot; activities but karate and cub scouts and a couple<br/>
of other things.<br/>
<br/>
Mom does all the planning but says it is unschooling because the kids showed<br/>
an interest in each activity.  The rest of us weren&#39;t buying that a 2 yo<br/>
voiced wanting to sign up for all these activities.  The same with the 4 yo<br/>
and 5 yo.<br/>
<br/>
They live in a gated community, mom drives a Cadillac SUV and going camping<br/>
means buying Eddie Bauer.  Personally, I think she is a misplaced Marin<br/>
County yuppy playing keep up with the Joneses and that the kids all have to<br/>
be in the &quot;right&quot; groups and organized activities.  She doesn&#39;t belong to<br/>
the unschooling group or any homeschooling groups, only a parent group for<br/>
the charter.<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, my real question is how do folks handle young children who see<br/>
something on television or hear about a friend doing it and do the &quot;me too&quot;<br/>
routine.  Do you rush out and sign them up for ballet because they saw a<br/>
ballarina on tv?  Or sign them up for karate because they like to watch the<br/>
Karate Kid movies.  Or do you try and set up some activity with a<br/>
homeschooling group so they can &quot;play&quot; at it until they are older and really<br/>
know what it is that they want or buy them a ballarina costume so they can<br/>
play at home.  Not to say that they don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to be a ballarina at that<br/>
moment, just that what they want is to play at it, not get serious about it<br/>
and take lessons in a very organzied sense.<br/>
<br/>
AND, also, how much is too much. I thought it was a bit too much to haul a 2<br/>
yo around 6 days a week (plus he has sunday school on sundays) and on some<br/>
days to 3 different activities.<br/>
<br/>
Seems way too much to me when you have to have a white board and 5 different<br/>
colored pens so you can keep track of who belongs where and when.  AND, when<br/>
they kids have to be up EVERY day at 7 and some at 6 so they can &quot;enjoy&quot; all<br/>
their activities.<br/>

You can&#39;t join Cub Scouts until you&#39;re 6 yo or in first grade.   Mine (13yo<br/>

also participate in a local soccer club (their choice; the older one is a<br/>
referee and the younger one plays).   Since that takes up 4 nights a week,<br/>
we don&#39;t allow anything else (unless it can be done during the day, and fits<br/>

some of them really seem to like it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-395081673">The eldest may be 6, I&#39;m not sure.  I do know the youngest won&#39;t be 3 until<br/>
next October and he has things scheduled for 6 days a week.<br/>
<br/>
I think they are already suffering burnout.  We went to the park here in<br/>
town (75 acres with a zoo which has a petting zoo, a couple of acres in<br/>
playgrounds and the rest is a forest with trails and a duck pond) and they<br/>
were too perfect and didn&#39;t seem to know how to play without directions.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it made me feel tired &lt;g&gt; and glad that eldest drives and takes<br/>
some of the burden off poor ol&#39; mom &lt;g&gt; in this house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-966893182">I was teaching my daughters girl scout troup some card games, and at <br/>
the introduction of the first one, I said, I wrote the rules, and you <br/>
can each take a copy and teach it to your family if you want.<br/>
One girl immediately said, &quot;oh, we don&#39;t have time for family game <br/>
nights.  We&#39;re always going to activities.&quot;<br/>
I thought she was exaggerating and mentioned it to the mom.<br/>
She was NOT exaggerating.  The mother starts telling me, how between <br/>
the 3 basketball teams, and one lacrosse team this girl is on, the <br/>
little brother is also on a soccer travel team and the park and rec <br/>
league AND boys basketball, they are literally gone every day.  I was <br/>
shocked.  She said, well, they need to be doing something.  I do it <br/>
for my own sanity as much as for them.<br/>
I took that to mean, she couldn&#39;t imagine actually spending time at <br/>
home with them.  Just being a family.  These kids also go to school. <br/>
Not to mention girl scouts and anything else outside of sports she <br/>
didn&#39;t mention.<br/>
She&#39;s always been an overactive lady.  always complaining about how <br/>
she can&#39;t say no(school volunteer stuff), and therefore always has <br/>
too much on her plate.  I wondeer if that&#39;s a form of escapism.??<br/>

Here&#39;s how I feel. I don&#39;t know these people, I don&#39;t know their history or<br/>
their reasons why their kids are in lots of activities. Maybe thye have<br/>
depression and need structure to prevent a relapse. Maybe thye were raised<br/>
very hands off and think this is the way to raise children. Maybe this is<br/>
better thn the way they were raised and they are trying.<br/>
I can&#39;t presume that someone does something different that I see as wrong,<br/>
simply because they don&#39;t *want* to do anything different or don&#39;t care or<br/>
wnat control. I try to remember that my (our) way of parenting/looking at<br/>
life is VERY radical for most people. We should set an example drop gentle<br/>
hints and when they ASK for a different perspective, THEN slam them with our<br/>
ideas. (After all they asked! lol)<br/>
Maybe parents of young children put them into lots of activities because<br/>
they have no one in the neighborhood or want to meet other parents with<br/>
kids. I don&#39;t know.<br/>
I used to sit on the beach with a friend and &quot;critique&quot; people as they<br/>
walked by or sunbathed. This is what this feels like to me.<br/>
If we are talking about one persons friend then lets talk about ways to<br/>
introduce what we think are better ideas to that friend. How can we show<br/>
these other parents that they cacn relax and not run their kids around. Lets<br/>
think of ways to explain that the mainstream view of raising kids might not<br/>
be right rather than saying *they* are wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968361929">Well, I started the thread but like so many others, it has grown a mind of<br/>
its own &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The original questions was &quot;how young is too young and how much is too<br/>
much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was a request for personal opinions.  Opinions sometimes get redefined<br/>
as judgements.<br/>
<br/>
IMNSHO, 7 days of planned activities, some that started with rousting the<br/>
kids at 6 a.m. is way too much for a 2 yo.  I was rather surprised that a<br/>
mother could make a claim of unschooling while enrolling her 5 yo (may be<br/>
six now since he is in Cub Scouts and someone said they have to be 6) in a<br/>
charter school because he supposedly requested it because of all the<br/>
activities he could join plus enrolling him in classes outside the charter 7<br/>
days a week.  Also, there is a 4 you girl that is enrolled in 2 to 3 classes<br/>
per day seven days a week.  She has a marks alot board with color coding so<br/>
that &quot;everyone knows where they have to be each day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t sound to me like the kids were making the choices but rather that<br/>
mom was making the choices and that she had latched onto the word<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; from going to the activities that my cousin plans.<br/>
<br/>
So, it wasn&#39;t really a request for what anyone thought about the woman, her<br/>
story was simply an explanation of why I was asking the question.<br/>
<br/>
So, Elissa, whaddaya think, are 2, 4 and 5 yos the ones doing the leading in<br/>
circumstances such as this?  Personally I can&#39;t picture a 2 yo asking or<br/>
even giving an indication that they want 7 days of structured activities in<br/>
their life each week.<br/>

&gt; Here&#39;s how I feel. I don&#39;t know these people, I don&#39;t know their history<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; their reasons why their kids are in lots of activities. Maybe thye have<br/>
&gt; depression and need structure to prevent a relapse. Maybe thye were raised<br/>
&gt; very hands off and think this is the way to raise children. Maybe this is<br/>
&gt; better thn the way they were raised and they are trying.<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t presume that someone does something different that I see as wrong,<br/>
&gt; simply because they don&#39;t *want* to do anything different or don&#39;t care or<br/>
&gt; wnat control. I try to remember that my (our) way of parenting/looking at<br/>
&gt; life is VERY radical for most people. We should set an example drop gentle<br/>
&gt; hints and when they ASK for a different perspective, THEN slam them with<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; ideas. (After all they asked! lol)<br/>
&gt; Maybe parents of young children put them into lots of activities because<br/>
&gt; they have no one in the neighborhood or want to meet other parents with<br/>
&gt; kids. I don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt; I used to sit on the beach with a friend and &quot;critique&quot; people as they<br/>
&gt; walked by or sunbathed. This is what this feels like to me.<br/>
&gt; If we are talking about one persons friend then lets talk about ways to<br/>
&gt; introduce what we think are better ideas to that friend. How can we show<br/>
&gt; these other parents that they cacn relax and not run their kids around.<br/>
Lets<br/>
&gt; think of ways to explain that the mainstream view of raising kids might<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; be right rather than saying *they* are wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663144395">So, Elissa, whaddaya think, are 2, 4 and 5 yos the ones doing the leading in<br/>
circumstances such as this?  Personally I can&#39;t picture a 2 yo asking or<br/>
even giving an indication that they want 7 days of structured activities in<br/>
their life each week.<br/>

Who cares?<br/>
I don&#39;t know. the answer to your question, It&#39;s neither right or wrong.<br/>
I also don&#39;t know this two year old so I can&#39;t decide if they were making a<br/>
choice. I think she probably wasn&#39;t. BUT<br/>
I can&#39;t picture someone actually striking their child, or molesting someone<br/>
or going to college at 10, or eating fish eyeballs (Iron Chef) but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>
Have you ever said something to the mom? Are you close enough to do so? Has<br/>
she ever said anything to you about her choice?<br/>
BTW, like I said, I didn&#39;t remember the beginning post. I was just getting<br/>
uncomfortable with the tone that was developing as the discussion went on.<br/>
The tone I was reading was &quot;Look at all these people. they are so wrong. See<br/>
what she is doing how horrible! What a control freak! etc. etc.&quot;<br/>
But, I may very well have been reading this completely ewrong, after all, it<br/>
is email.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Well, I started the thread but like so many others, it has grown a mind of<br/>
&gt;its own &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The original questions was &quot;how young is too young and how much is too<br/>
&gt;much.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This was a request for personal opinions.  Opinions sometimes get redefined<br/>
&gt;as judgements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IMNSHO, 7 days of planned activities, some that started with rousting the<br/>
&gt;kids at 6 a.m. is way too much for a 2 yo.  I was rather surprised that a<br/>
&gt;mother could make a claim of unschooling while enrolling her 5 yo (may be<br/>
&gt;six now since he is in Cub Scouts and someone said they have to be 6) in a<br/>
&gt;charter school because he supposedly requested it because of all the<br/>
&gt;activities he could join plus enrolling him in classes outside the charter<br/>
 </span></blockquote>7<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;days a week.  Also, there is a 4 you girl that is enrolled in 2 to 3<br/>
 </span></blockquote>classes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;per day seven days a week.  She has a marks alot board with color coding so<br/>
&gt;that &quot;everyone knows where they have to be each day.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It didn&#39;t sound to me like the kids were making the choices but rather that<br/>
&gt;mom was making the choices and that she had latched onto the word<br/>
&gt;&quot;unschooling&quot; from going to the activities that my cousin plans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, it wasn&#39;t really a request for what anyone thought about the woman, her<br/>
&gt;story was simply an explanation of why I was asking the question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, Elissa, whaddaya think, are 2, 4 and 5 yos the ones doing the leading<br/>
