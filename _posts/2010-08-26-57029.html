&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nyti.ms/9IbAaI">http://nyti.ms/9IbAaI</a>&gt;  - titled &quot;What is it about 20-somethings&quot;.  It<br/>
discusses the 20s as a time when young adults are postponing big<br/>
decisions - work, marriage, family - to explore their identies and<br/>
figure out what they want in life.  My first thought upon reading it was<br/>
that the reason young adults need this time for self-reflection is<br/>
because they haven&#39;t had the time/opportunity for it during their school<br/>
years and even through college, but I&#39;m thinking I may be wrong to<br/>
assume it&#39;s exclusive to schooled kids.  So, the reason I bring the<br/>
article here for discussion is because I&#39;m curious if this seems to be<br/>
true as a general rule for some unschoolers as well.<br/>
<br/>
One quote from a 23-year-old caught my attention... &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
somewhat terrifying,&quot; writes a 25-year-old named Jennifer, &quot;to<br/>
think about all the things I&#39;m supposed to be doing in order to<br/>
`get somewhere&#39; successful: `Follow your passions, live your<br/>
dreams, take risks, network with the right people, find mentors, be<br/>
financially responsible, volunteer, work, think about or go to grad<br/>
school, fall in love and maintain personal well-being, mental health and<br/>
nutrition.&#39; When is there time to just be and enjoy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschoolers get this pressure from their parents, but I<br/>
doubt they are immune to it from society, so I am curious if there are<br/>
any differences and/or simarities between schooled and unschooled young<br/>
adults.<br/>

With unschooling, the ideas is that all of life is time to be and to  <br/>
enjoy.  That has made a difference in our family&#39;s life in lots of  <br/>
ways, documented in a couple of books and here:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some of that is probably true, but there&#39;s more than one thing going on. Late teens and early twenties tends to be a time when people have big ideas, strong attitudes, and a lot of drive, and that&#39;s something that&#39;s true historically, too - lots of great inventions and discoveries by people in their teens and eary twenties, lots of intense philosophical and religious revelations, too. <br/>
<br/>
But its also true that unschoolers have more time and support to pursue what they want. If they need to spend a lot of time thinking, or going to political events, even if they need to stay home past (gasp) the magic age of 18 to have time to devote to their own needs. <br/>

He tends to socialize with people with quirky, out-of-the-box lifestyles. He&#39;s certainly not facing the pressure I or George did at the same age, to figure out what we wanted to do either in terms of college or, in George&#39;s case, work. <br/>
