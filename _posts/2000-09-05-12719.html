&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, not to make it too terrible for ya, Pris, but we live in an area<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; has the average temp for the whole U.S. which means it runs about 67<br/>
&gt; degrees all year.  We only vary by about 10 degrees in either direction<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; only have about a dozen frost days a year.  The little town &quot;next door&quot;<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; the most growing days in a year for the whole country.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, we can usually drive down the road a bit (half hour to an hour)<br/>
&gt; and be in some friendly (80 to 90&#39;s) heat in one direction and serious<br/>
heat<br/>
&gt; (90&#39;s and up) in the other.  But, this year we didn&#39;t get the &quot;friendly&quot;<br/>
&gt; heat to often on the river which was a disappointment to the kidlets.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And going up the hill to the hotter temps was kinda limited as last year<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; lost 100,000 acres to a fire compliments of the parks boozos and one of<br/>
&gt; their controlled burns.<br/>
