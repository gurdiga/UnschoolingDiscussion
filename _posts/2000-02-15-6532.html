 </span></blockquote>Stephanie how do you organise this I am very interested! I&#39;ve read all the<br/>
tightwad gazette&#39;s and still feel like a failure as I don&#39;t make stuff from<br/>
scratch *due to lack of desire to clean up the mess* but I would love to<br/>
learn how to be more &quot;efficient&quot; and still be there for the kids. Do your<br/>
kids help you with most of the cooking?<br/>

    I buy everything on sale, and then try to get it into correct serving<br/>
sizes immediately. If you buy your groceries first thing in the morning, it<br/>
will be easier to actually do the work. I can get the kids to help with the<br/>
buying and cooking but I usually let them be the tasters, and they get<br/>
something they want when shopping (is this bribery, or just good planning)<br/>
They actually like trying to find what I want...<br/>
<br/>
Buy in bulk (if you can). I never buy in less than 10 LB for meat. I bring<br/>
it home and then cook it when I am putting the other stuff away. there are<br/>
so many things that you can do with ground beef (precooked). But get<br/>
creative. I know that it took me a lot of time to actually start cooking<br/>
ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and when it comes to cooking from scratch, buy things like egg noodles.<br/>
What I originally did was fake recipes. (Look at the hamburger box, and try<br/>
to make it without the nifty box) One of the faves in our home is ground<br/>
hamburger with egg noodles in cream of mushroom soup. Seriously! Last night<br/>
I changed to chicken and added French cut green beans to it, for the exotic<br/>
look! LOL I used 2 full bags of noodles, 4 cans of mushroom soup, 2 cups of<br/>
milk, and about 1 complete fryer chicken (deboned) I have enough now for 2<br/>
more dinners out of that one pot!<br/>
<br/>
It took me a while to actually get it together enough to cook enough for<br/>
many dinners, but now I cannot cook normal if you paid me. I think it helps<br/>
that I have 4 children, so I am ALWAYS in the kitchen anyhow. I think that<br/>
the way to start is to just do it one day. I started for Y2K, believe it or<br/>
not. I wanted all the foods cooked so I could deal  with power loss and all<br/>
that! LOL I just got up one day, took all kinds of meat out and started<br/>
then. I am the queen of whatchamacallit meals that are done in 30 minutes<br/>
flat.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, I can go more into what I do. I do not know if the list would<br/>
appreciate my cluttering. Post me-<br/>

I would be interested in more info on the cooking. Do you freeze everything<br/>
and if so how do you reheat? Do you thaw it first?<br/>

Some of the recipes call for you to not cook the food, others call for<br/>
certain parts cooked (like ground meat), then you have my favorites, fully<br/>
cooked - heat in Microwave!<br/>
<br/>
When I cook, I always cook extra, and then freeze the excess. I do not<br/>
freeze noodles, unless they are in a dish like lasagna. Then I make 3 or 4<br/>
pans and freeze what the family did not attack :) I make meatballs, freeze<br/>
in ziplocs, and then just pop them into sauce as needed.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to spend some time digging up recipes and get them going for<br/>
those who want to learn more about freezer life :)<br/>

Off I go to feed the troops, we are eating leftover creamy chicken<br/>
casserole. Cream of Mush soup, egg noodles, cut up chicken, French cut<br/>

for starters. I did check (for a min) both sites. The second one does not<br/>
say a thing about freezing, but From the recipes on the page (lasagna, etc.)<br/>
I know that it is safe to do. I would suggest to make the dishes, then cook,<br/>
divvy into meal size containers, wrap, label, and freeze! Then when you<br/>
want, you can pull it out, heat up, and munch! When I only had Mart (1st<br/>
child) I would cook a 9x13 pan of lasagna, cut it up into what we could eat,<br/>
and freeze into 4 meals!<br/>
Let me know how it goes!<br/>
