<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143349503">I wqas just wondering about something that has been on my mind lately. I <br/>
would say our parenting hasn&#39;t changed much lately, except for possibly the <br/>
words I use with the children. My husband Joe is still a bit more strict <br/>
than I would like but he&#39;s trying and listens to all my suggestions on what <br/>
to do and not to do with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the question. Is there a general age when you have noticed that the <br/>
children become more aware of others and start to not be so selfish?<br/>
I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;m thinking of it more or the kids are more into <br/>
themselves lately, but they seem so into themselves recently they don&#39;t stop <br/>
to think about others. I hear their words when there is a conflict, that <br/>
they talk it out and think of how the other would feel. What I don&#39;t see is <br/>
the action behind it on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
Just as an example, this morning my 2 middle kids got up very early, (for <br/>
this house) it was obvious everyone else was asleep. They proceded to play <br/>
in the playroom at a noise level that would wake the dead. I mentioned it <br/>
once and not 3 minutes later, it was just as loud as before. That&#39;s the kind <br/>
of stuff I am thinking that maybe they would see by now. I&#39;m not looking for <br/>
a magical age, I know they are kids, but I just kind of worry now that maybe <br/>
they won&#39;t get it.<br/>
