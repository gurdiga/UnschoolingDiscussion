Hi Susan :-)<br/>
<br/>
You and your boy sound so great!  I love the caring you have for eachother<br/>
that comes through in your posts :-)<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I would say that I notice one of my son&#39;s allergic reactions<br/>
is a huge increase in anxiety and irrational fear.  When he was about eight,<br/>
he started to worry about the doors being locked at night and stuff.  This<br/>
confused me because he had never acted like that before, although he had<br/>
allergies like stuffed sinuses which I could not figure out. We switched our<br/>
diet to exclude grains and beans and sugar (as best as we could), and those<br/>
fears went away.  Now at 11, he knows that if he eats grains (especially<br/>
wheat- bread), he can expect a really stuffy head AND if he eats say two or<br/>
three meals of &quot;bad&quot; foods--anxiety.  And he says, &quot;I am worrying about the<br/>
dogs getting out, I think it must have been the birthday cake&quot;.  My other<br/>
son gets kindof mean and also &quot;irrational&quot; like wanting it to be day when it<br/>
is night (he just turned three :-) when he eats grains.  He chooses those<br/>
foods much more than his brother because we have alot of friends that eat<br/>
mostly eat grains and have crackers and stuff, although he is learning about<br/>
when he feels yucky, and is starting to choose say, sunflower seeds over<br/>
pirates booty (cheesy corn puffs) at the store- (although yesterday it was<br/>
pirates booty :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe it is related a bit to food for your son too. I read a book<br/>
&quot;Is this your CHild&quot;, I think there must be others- that one talks about<br/>
emotional allergic reactions which some people dismiss, which is really<br/>
silly I think.  I mean we really act like our mind and body are different<br/>
and separate- but it is sort of an illogical assumtion I believe.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
