Actually, Pokemon has been pretty valuable in our house.  Zack has learned <br/>
the usuals:  math and reading, but he&#39;s also been studying strategy and <br/>
problem solving, monetary value, how best to stretch his allowance, <br/>
motivation to save money.  His memory for the details on those cards and on <br/>
the games is frightening.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also been an extremely useful tool for social development.  Zack is a <br/>
bit awkward socially (with kids but not with adults -- go figure!), but <br/>
Pokemon gave him something in common with lots of kids.  He learned to <br/>
negotiate his trades, approach others with propositions, communicate what he <br/>
wants.  He made new friends.  He learned how to deal with the clerks at his <br/>
favorite card store.  He also learned how to share his Gameboy, and how to <br/>
schedule turns when his friends played the games on his Nintendo.  It amazes <br/>
me that he can sit down with another child or even an adult and have this <br/>
animated, detailed discussion about Pokemon.  <br/>
<br/>
As tired as I may be with all of it, I have to admit that it has been a real <br/>
boon for Zack.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I feel the same way about Pokemon-I think my boys got their moneys worth out <br/>
of it. They even joined a pokemon league. We thought it would be great to <br/>
send them to a place where others speak their language! It has pretty much <br/>
worn off for them, though. They were into it for almost a year, but now they <br/>
are enjoying having allowance for other things than cards. Now Nick is <br/>
thinking of selling his cards on ebay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074004222">We don&#39;t watch the cartoon, but we love the game. It is every bit as<br/>
challenging as chess!<br/>
<br/>
I started taking the kids to Pokemon League and after the second time<br/>
decided to figure out what was going on. After reading the rules and<br/>
watching a few games, I started to get the hang of it. My kids let me use<br/>
their extra cards to build a game deck and I started playing and of course<br/>
learned a lot more by actually playing instead of just reading about it or<br/>
watching.<br/>
<br/>
For Christmas, Glen and Lane bought me my own deck and I began to play in<br/>
earnest. I&#39;m now a certified coach, have earned several badges, and I<br/>
frequently get beaten by kids less than a quarter my age!<br/>
<br/>
League play is a great experience for kids who don&#39;t have the advantages of<br/>
homeschooling as they get real life experience in reading, math, strategy,<br/>
and negotiating skills by playing the game and trading the cards. They also<br/>
learn that age or gender is not important in determining ability (there&#39;s a<br/>
5 yo girl who regularly beats kids 3 times her age and adults often lose to<br/>
kids!). They also get the opportunity to teach the game to newcomers, and to<br/>
socialize with kids of a variety of ages who homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
I think Pokemon League is a great experience for kids who are deprived of<br/>
opportunities for socializing and real life learning because they attend<br/>
institutionalized school. And for homeschoolers, it&#39;s a lot of fun too.<br/>

<br/>
I have an 8 year old that just awesome. He is my Mr. Detail Man.  The child<br/>
will explain all 150 pokemon and their moves in one breath.   He was asking<br/>
me to read one of the cards and I said you know.... if you can learn 150<br/>
pokemon, and all their hits, and how to play the game and how to create<br/>
decks and begin to learn the Neo&#39;s.... then you can learn the 70 or so<br/>
sounds/letter combinations we use to read with.  Now, he&#39;s as cute as he can<br/>
be, with eyes that will eventually melt many a girl&#39;s heart. He rolled those<br/>
eyes and said, &quot;70! I can&#39;t learn all of that!&quot;<br/>
