<div id="ygrps-yiv-601401885">that is such a shame, Myranda. You must have felt really crappy leaving <br/>
that Meeting.<br/>
<br/>
I must add that I have been attending Meetings for 23 years ( yes, <br/>
years) and have not ever seen anything even remotely like that take place.<br/>
I have seen some women, who are so excited and passionate about their <br/>
babies, get more than a bit boisterous about the benefits of <br/>
breastfeeding. These are women who attend Meetings and a Leader never <br/>
knows what the make -up of a Meeting will be as they are open to the public.<br/>
It is the LLL Leaders&#39; responsibility to lead the Meeting in such a way <br/>
that everyone&#39;s needs are met. Much easier said than done! but LLLI <br/>
Philosophy is certainly accepting of every woman&#39;s choices.  Leaders <br/>
study a long time, attend sessions on communication skills, keep their <br/>
knowledge of research current, all on a volunteer basis, in order to <br/>
*prevent* what happened during the Meeting you attended.<br/>
Most of the women in the local Groups here are working Moms and some <br/>
have chosen to supplement with formula during their absences. I have <br/>
seen many single mothers whose babies spent time with their fathers away <br/>
from mom...women who nursed one twin and not the other.....<br/>
There are as many situations as there are babies; yet each Mother is <br/>
always treated with respect. *You* know what is best for your family and <br/>
you should not have been judged in any way.<br/>
I am so sorry that you had that experience....I can guarantee you would <br/>
not be treated that way at any Meeting near me. and it is likely that <br/>
you could have returned to that Group and met with an entirely different <br/>
gathering of Mothers and had the wonderful experience most people have <br/>
when they find LLL. I distinctly remember the first time I attended one- <br/>
I was pregnant with my 2nd, had weaned the first  early ... no one said <br/>
a word about my past experiences but they did offer vast amounts of <br/>
information that made my breastfeeding relationship with the new baby <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
La Leche League is the &#39;World&#39;s Foremost Authority &#39; on breastfeeding, I <br/>
hope you will use the information the organization has available if you <br/>
should ever need it.<br/>
Fondly, Judy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402470412">Thanks Judy! One of the worst things was that it was the leader who started the criticism. She asked why I had formula fed, then went on to tell me that I should have done my homework about it, because I could have and should have still nursed at night. Then I said they both slept through the night starting at two months, and everyone jumped in about how I must have let them cry til they just gave up and slept (not true) and about how I dehydrated them, and several other things I don&#39;t remember now. The leader just sat there quietly frowning at me after the others started in. Three of them were in agreement that I wouldn&#39;t have enough dedication to nurse my new baby, and insinuated that I was wasting their time by coming. I&#39;m glad to hear not everyone&#39;s like they were!!!  <br/>

&gt; &gt;started the criticism. She asked why I had formula fed, then went on to<br/>
&gt; &gt;tell me that I should have done my homework about it, because I could <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt;and should have still nursed at night. Then I said they both slept <br/>
&gt; through<br/>
&gt; &gt;the night starting at two months, and everyone jumped in about how I <br/>
&gt; must<br/>
&gt; &gt;have let them cry til they just gave up and slept (not true) and <br/>
&gt; about how<br/>
&gt; &gt;I dehydrated them, and several other things I don&#39;t remember now. The<br/>
&gt; &gt;leader just sat there quietly frowning at me after the others started <br/>
&gt; in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Three of them were in agreement that I wouldn&#39;t have enough <br/>
&gt; dedication to<br/>
&gt; &gt;nurse my new baby, and insinuated that I was wasting their time by <br/>
&gt; coming.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m glad to hear not everyone&#39;s like they were!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Myranda<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that is such a shame, Myranda. You must have felt really crappy <br/>
&gt; leaving<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that Meeting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I must add that I have been attending Meetings for 23 years ( yes,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   years) and have not ever seen anything even remotely like that <br/>
&gt; take place.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I have seen some women, who are so excited and passionate about their<br/>
&gt; &gt;   babies, get more than a bit boisterous about the benefits of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   breastfeeding. These are women who attend Meetings and a Leader never<br/>
&gt; &gt;   knows what the make -up of a Meeting will be as they are open to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; public.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   It is the LLL Leaders&#39; responsibility to lead the Meeting in such <br/>
&gt; a way<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that everyone&#39;s needs are met. Much easier said than done! but LLLI<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Philosophy is certainly accepting of every woman&#39;s choices.  Leaders<br/>
&gt; &gt;   study a long time, attend sessions on communication skills, keep their<br/>
&gt; &gt;   knowledge of research current, all on a volunteer basis, in order to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   *prevent* what happened during the Meeting you attended.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Most of the women in the local Groups here are working Moms and some<br/>
&gt; &gt;   have chosen to supplement with formula during their absences. I have<br/>
&gt; &gt;   seen many single mothers whose babies spent time with their <br/>
&gt; fathers away<br/>
&gt; &gt;   from mom...women who nursed one twin and not the other.....<br/>
&gt; &gt;   There are as many situations as there are babies; yet each Mother is<br/>
&gt; &gt;   always treated with respect. *You* know what is best for your <br/>
&gt; family and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you should not have been judged in any way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I am so sorry that you had that experience....I can guarantee you <br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt;   not be treated that way at any Meeting near me. and it is likely that<br/>
&gt; &gt;   you could have returned to that Group and met with an entirely <br/>
&gt; different<br/>
&gt; &gt;   gathering of Mothers and had the wonderful experience most people have<br/>
&gt; &gt;   when they find LLL. I distinctly remember the first time I <br/>
&gt; attended one-<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I was pregnant with my 2nd, had weaned the first  early ... no one <br/>
&gt; said<br/>
&gt; &gt;   a word about my past experiences but they did offer vast amounts of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   information that made my breastfeeding relationship with the new baby<br/>
&gt; &gt;   wonderful.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   La Leche League is the &#39;World&#39;s Foremost Authority &#39; on <br/>
&gt; breastfeeding, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;   hope you will use the information the organization has available <br/>
&gt; if you<br/>
&gt; &gt;   should ever need it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Fondly, Judy<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; Be careful what you say if you go to their meetings! I formula-fed<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; both my boys because I had to work full time. When I had my third<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; baby, I had been staying home for over 4 years, so I wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; breastfeed her. I went to a meeting.... they asked about how I&#39;d fed<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; the boys, and I told them. The rest of the meeting was spent <br/>
&gt; with them<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; attacking my choices and telling me what a bad mom I was. Absolutely<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; no support for me wanting to breastfeed now, no help or advice,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; nothing. Just criticism for past choices. I was almost in tears <br/>
&gt; by the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; time I left.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt;   attending LL Meetings is a must do while pregnant<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt;   and the LLLI website is VERY helpful:<br/>

Hi Myranda :-)<br/>
<br/>
I though I would reply to this thread because I have been a practicing LLL<br/>
Leader since my first baby was one (she is now 14).<br/>
<br/>
We are expressly trained to focus on the positives of breastfeeding, not the<br/>
negatives of bottlefeeding.  If a woman starts ragging on bottle feeding or<br/>
bottle feeding mothers, it is the leaders obligation and responsibility to<br/>
say something like, &quot;We are not here to critizise bottlefeeding but to<br/>
support and encourage those wishing to breastfeed.&quot; And steer the meeting in<br/>
another direction.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes moms come to meetings having bottlefed wanting to find out why<br/>
breastfeeding didn&#39;t work for them. Then we can brainstorm for the possible<br/>
reasons so she has that information for the future.  This is sometimes<br/>
painful, especially when the mom didn&#39;t want to stop breastfeeding.  As a<br/>
leader, it is important to be sensitive to the feelings of the mothers at<br/>
the meeting.<br/>
<br/>
I am very sorry you had such a bad experience.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell by your posts that you care deeply about your children and only<br/>
want what is best for them.  This is what the leader would have recognized<br/>
in you and enunciated in the meeting, (if I could have a wish from a LLL<br/>
genie).<br/>
<br/>
(Hey, while I am at it, &quot;I wish that all of my meetings were and will be<br/>
perfect! and that all of the mothers leave feeling that they are the most<br/>
important beautiful person in the world to their baby!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Love to you,<br/>

These are some of the things I&#39;d always heard about LLL, which is why I wanted to go in the first place. I guess I should have driven the extra 30 miles to the other town meeting!<br/>
