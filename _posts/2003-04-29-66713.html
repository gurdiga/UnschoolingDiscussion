<div id="ygrps-yiv-470674825">They are an excellent magazine, though of a decided conservative bent.<br/>
Please lmk if anyone is interested. I&#39;m going to have to get off the<br/>
computer soon, and get packing. Everything goes in early June...that&#39;s when<br/>
we ship the stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so excited.<br/>
