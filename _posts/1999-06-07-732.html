Something WAY away from schooling, or unschooling.  Don&#39;t read about <br/>
education.  DEschool yourself!  Read something distracting and amusing and <br/>
light.<br/>
<br/>
As to inspirational unschoolingish videos--Mary Poppins (with Julie Andrews) <br/>
and Heidi (with Shirley Temple).  Both are about learning without school and <br/>
they&#39;re about cooler, older places than wherever you are and that&#39;s relaxing <br/>
too.  And the grandfather in Heidi sounds like Arnold Schwartzenegger with <br/>
that Austrian accent, which is fun.<br/>

while. I asked for unschooling/deschooling suggestions because I am trying<br/>
to gear myself up to write my first homeschooling letter of intent/proposal<br/>
and &quot;curriculum&quot; (if you&#39;ll excuse the expression) for the school<br/>
superintendent, which is due mid-August. I&#39;m nervous about it. I feel like<br/>
I&#39;m a kid again writing a term paper that counts for 80% of my grade!  Yikes!<br/>

people put one together.<br/>
<br/>
History: We will learn about several different time periods this year, <br/>
utilizing a variety of biographies, computer games, internet sources and <br/>
other information.  Maps, timelines and field trips will round out our <br/>
history pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
Math: We will be continuing or mathematical education using lots of <br/>
manipulative based elements.  WE fully anticipate learning more mathematical <br/>
concepts, at age and grade level appropriate pace.<br/>
<br/>
Science: Out science will be done by studying the lives of some of the great <br/>
scientists, delving into their theories and processes.  We will have lots of <br/>
hands-on science experiments through-out the school year.<br/>
<br/>
Now - this shows that you intend to cover all the basics, yet is not <br/>
specific.  In MOST cases, the state does not require specifics - they just <br/>
want to see what you will be covering.  There is nothing in the above that <br/>
clashes with unschooling.  Presumably - some of you WILL read books, that <br/>
will include mention of science and history.  Presumably some one in the <br/>
family WILL watch a history show or two, play a game, such as Oregon Trails, <br/>
etc...<br/>

Be general in your descriptions, if they ask for more - circle the wagons and <br/>
try to tighen up your definitions a bit...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
When writing your outline remember to include the most important thing: &quot; <br/>
SUBJECT MATTER & MATERIALS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE&quot; that way, they can&#39;t <br/>
&quot;hold&quot; you to it...<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have the &quot;What your __nth Grader Needs to Know&quot; by E.D. Hirsch.  <br/>
It&#39;s the only thing close to a &quot;curriculum&quot; I use.  I like it because <br/>
everything&#39;s there; it&#39;s not a list, then you have to go back to the library <br/>
to get the stories that the list recommends...<br/>
It&#39;s done as a core knowledge series to keep check on schools so that their <br/>
teaching the same things--when a kid moves from another school, there&#39;s so <br/>
much inconsistancy that what one school teachs in 3rd grade may not even be <br/>
addressed until the 4th grade at another school...<br/>
<br/>
my 2 cents...<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have been where you are and it is NOT fun. <br/>
 I also have to send in a &quot;brief outline&quot; of the intended curriculum for the <br/>
 current year.<br/>
 As well as a list of &quot;textbooks&quot; and other basic teaching materials that the <br/>
 parent intends to use. I really hate it. How old are your children? I can <br/>
 show you what I did for my children. I kept the &quot;brief outlines&quot; and &quot;lists <br/>
 of teaching materials&quot;. I have them for 1st grade, 2nd grade, 7th grade & <br/>
8th <br/>
 grade. <br/>
 What I do, is go to the library and get a bunch of those &quot;What your second <br/>
 grader needs to know&quot; books, etc. I really think it&#39;s quite ridiculous that <br/>
 the school districts think that all 8 y.o.&#39;s need to know the same thing, <br/>
but <br/>
 I tell them what they want to hear. You don&#39;t have to stick to your <br/>
 curriculum, I just basically &quot;make it look good&quot;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In Ohio, when we notify(we are notifying of our intent to educate our <br/>
children at home, not asking permission!!!), we have to submit our <br/>
_intendend_ curriculum.The operative word is intednded--things change, and <br/>
life presents us with all kinds of opportunities and challenges. Some folks <br/>
just copy from World Bk Encyclopedia&#39;s typical Course of Study K-12.  I used <br/>
to sweat about it until i realized that they really don&#39;t care--so i write a <br/>
brief narrative statement about continuing our explorations in xyz, using <br/>
educationally and developmentally appropriate materials, etc. I don&#39;t expect <br/>
problems and have never had them!!<br/>

  World Book Encyclopedia 800-621-8202.  As for Typical Course of Study k-12. <br/>
I didn&#39;t have to pay for it at all--others to whom I&#39;ve spoken have paid for <br/>
postage.<br/>
  This will be our 6th yr.  We took our oldest dd out  of kdgn after winter <br/>
break(she&#39;s 11).<br/>
We&#39;ve always unschooled. My older dd want more structure now, so we got the <br/>
Key Curriculum Press math books this year which she does from time to time. <br/>
She just finished one of the Decimals book (I call it her Decibels book--loud <br/>
math!!!). <br/>
