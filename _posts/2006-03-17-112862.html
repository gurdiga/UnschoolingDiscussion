<div id="ygrps-yiv-736530484">So I wonder if there are statistics available for the French schools about<br/>
the ages of reading fluency and comprehension. I just can&#39;t believe that<br/>
every French schooled child would be reading fluently and fully by 9 if<br/>
every American, Australian, English and Canadian child is not.<br/>
***************************** Oh, you&#39;re right.. But they don&#39;t care about those statistics.. One thing here in France is that they ask things to the parents who homeschools they don&#39;t ask to the teachers at school. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is worth saying to your child, especially an older one, &quot;We can<br/>
keep these folk of our backs and comply with the law if you do a few of<br/>
these worksheets. Would you be willing to sit down sometime for a hour and<br/>
I&#39;ll help you if you want?&quot; I should think saying that would be better than<br/>
going to court if the risk was losing your child. <br/>
***************** Oh ! yes... It&#39;s exactly what we are doing here, in my family this year, with Tom. I know radical unschooling can&#39;t be defended in front of an inspector, here, at the moment, sure, sure, sure.. I will never take the risk.. <br/>
We discussed with Tom about all that. He&#39;s ok with that. <br/>
<br/>
Today, I&#39;m so confident with my children.. I see them living, they seem to be happy.. They have time, they love this life... And I just have this little thing in my head, those people, they will not let them taking their time... <br/>
<br/>
But I will not give up. I will find something to carry on.. :-)) <br/>
<br/>
I really hope that my english is ok, I&#39;m not sure about it... I wouldn&#39;t want saying the opposite that I want to say... <br/>

**************** We thought about that last year, for months,with my husband, and it was very hard to find a solution... we found it for the moment. I hope we will find solutions for the next years... <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Years back there was a family (not unschoolers) who went to court  <br/>
  over homeschooling and their children were taken away and (I think)  <br/>
  the mom was put in jail for a while, and they seemed happy about it,  <br/>
  in that they were practicing civil disobedience and making their  <br/>
  point and getting publicity.  I can&#39;t imagine, for myself, that it  <br/>
  would be worth losing one&#39;s children over at all. Not even for a  <br/>
  week.  There are other ways to make a point.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-I guess parents might view saying &quot;let&#39;s work on your reading&quot; in  <br/>
  some way<br/>
  as compromising one&#39;s integrity and ethics. They might see it as<br/>
  unacceptable, and be willing risk whatever the consequences are. I would<br/>
  hope that the child involved is mature enough to have a real  <br/>
  understanding<br/>
  of what is being risked, and a real ability to consent to be a heroic  <br/>
  figure<br/>
  in the struggle for Unschooling rights. -=-<br/>
<br/>
  But that&#39;s why integrity and ethics need to include principle and  <br/>
  priorities.  My &quot;ethics&quot; take a back seat to my desire for my  <br/>
  children to be safe and happy.  So far, I haven&#39;t had to make a  <br/>
  choice between those things, but I wouldn&#39;t think long if one of my  <br/>
  children was about to be taken away from me.  I would compromise the  <br/>
  HECK out of life to keep that child with me.  If I had to have my  <br/>
  kids in public school to keep them, they&#39;d be in school today.   <br/>
  Because I DO have a choice, then I make the choice that goes toward  <br/>
  keeping them with me, which is that they don&#39;t go to school.  And I  <br/>
  make the choice that goes toward natural learning and the maintenance  <br/>
  of their curiosity, which is to help them discover the world in fun  <br/>
  ways.<br/>
<br/>
  Last night Holly was in the hot tub with me and Keith.  That tub has  <br/>
  been good for incidental conversations.  Wednesday night it was us  <br/>
  and Marty, talking about college and U.S. Savings Bonds and such.   <br/>
  Thursday it was Holly, telling me how glad she was that I had shown  <br/>
  her &quot;view source&quot; for webpages, because she had found some good  <br/>
  backgrounds and codes, for her My Space page.  We talked about the  <br/>
  legalities, courtesies and ethics of using other art and codes, and  <br/>
  how to credit people, and how to lift public domain art onto her own  <br/>
  computer and then upload it from there.  We didn&#39;t plan that, and  <br/>
  couldn&#39;t have, and it was great.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-My fears are more along the lines of how she might be emotionally<br/>
  harmed by testing etc and how I could mitigate that.<br/>
  -=-<br/>

<br/>
  I stand by that.  If Holly gets busted here in her final years and  <br/>
  the state demands she be tested, I&#39;ll just recommend that she make a  <br/>
  pattern with the numbers and walk away whistling happily.  Kirby is  <br/>
  past the age of compulsory attendance.  Marty, at 17, is working full  <br/>
  time, which is a kind of twilight zone.  It&#39;s one of the requirements  <br/>
  for being allowed to drop out of school, and so I could say he&#39;s  <br/>
  finished with school, or I could say he&#39;s doing a project on trades  <br/>
  and vocations.  I&#39;m just not worried about it.   He&#39;s reportedly one  <br/>
  of the best workers there, and the lady in charge of the deli section  <br/>
  has been chatting him up, but when she found he wasn&#39;t 18 she was  <br/>
  disappointed, he said.  She said he was always cheerful, and he  <br/>
  should come and work in the deli when he&#39;s older.<br/>
