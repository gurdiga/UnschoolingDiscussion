changed forever?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see Summerhill text being &#39;whacking&#39;. So maybe any whacks that <br/>
subsequently follwed were just reminders of a introduction that you <br/>
already had that was serene and pleasant in the experience?<br/>

If it wasn&#39;t you who read it, then I retract the above, go on to the next <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess we must be down to the definition of whacking.  &lt;g&gt;  I *think* that <br/>
the discussion was about people being straightforward in what they were <br/>
saying, rather than worrying about the person&#39;s feelings.  Obviously A.S. <br/>
Neill was being straightforward and not worrying about his readers&#39; <br/>
feelings.  Then again, my feelings couldn&#39;t have been hurt by anything he <br/>
wrote because I wasn&#39;t then in a position of making decisions about <br/>
anyone&#39;s education or upbringing.<br/>

<br/>
And yes, I need to ponder the definition of what one would deem as <br/>
&#39;whack&#39; against what another would deem as &#39;whack&#39;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;ve always thought of a whack upside the head as being more like a <br/>
wake up call, an opportunity to look at things a different way.  I never <br/>
really thought of it terms of any kind of violent act, even verbal.  Quite <br/>
possibly other people think of them differently.<br/>
