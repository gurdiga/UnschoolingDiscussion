<div id="ygrps-yiv-743837798">Being new I was wondering if/what rules are instilled in your household.<br/>
<br/>
example-     No  food out of the dining area<br/>

                  ect<br/>
<br/>
This is our first week and I do see some changes already, but trying to <br/>
change my out look on something&#39;s are very hard, like when my son just picks <br/>
and picks on  the other child I take care of during the day.  Will sit there <br/>
and repeat his name in a chant and when the child ask him to stop he keeps <br/>
doing it and will even follow him to do it.  I just want to tell him to knock <br/>
it off but don&#39;t feel that is the right approach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602666344">We do have rules, but really they are more like habits because we&#39;ve done them all along and no one argues about them or ignores them. Basically ones of cleanliness and respect to people and possessions. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is not the kindest most compassionate answer at all.  That is the <br/>
emergency nothing-else-works answer if the situation has no options.  FIRST <br/>
look at options.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I would do if I needed to extinguish that behavior NOW, before the boy <br/>
came back tomorrow is when that boy was gone, I would follow my own child <br/>
around repeating his name, and I wouldn&#39;t stop until he was begging me to <br/>
stop. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And once he was whimpering and begging I would say &quot;SEE!?&quot;  It&#39;s irritating.  <br/>
It hurts.  Why can&#39;t you just believe me when I say something&#39;s irritating <br/>
next time?<br/>
<br/>
And I think that would solve it quickly.<br/>
<br/>
If quick isn&#39;t as important as humane, the more humane answers involve NOT <br/>
keeping someone else&#39;s child and giving every bit of attention to your own.  <br/>
But I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s not the option.  (If that IS an option, maybe go with <br/>
that for a while, and spend more time with your son.)<br/>
<br/>
So for me, if that kid were due back the next day, I would go for the taste <br/>
of his own medicine approach, even though it sounds kind of cruel.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not willing to aid and abet or enable my children to be mean to other <br/>
children, especially those who are unable to get away from it, and certainly <br/>
not when they&#39;re guests in my home.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;example-     No  food out of the dining area<br/>
                  bathing<br/>
                  ect&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a food rule.<br/>
<br/>
My kids like to take showers.  Kirby does it almost every day. Marty every <br/>
two days or so, and when he gets a haircut.<br/>
<br/>
Holly sometimes two times a day in the summer and every two or three days <br/>
when it&#39;s colder.<br/>
<br/>
If I had ever MADE them take showers, I don&#39;t think they would like it now.  <br/>
But we&#39;ve tried to make it fun, instead.  A game.  A privilege.  A cool thing <br/>
to do.<br/>

swimming pool, and I&#39;m the chief (only) lifeguard.  So, my rule is that <br/>
nobody hangs out in the area of the swimming pool unless I&#39;m there.  This <br/>
takes the heat off Liam (7yo) if one of his friends wants to go look at the <br/>
pool or something like that.   Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t call them &quot;rules&quot; as <br/>
much as &quot;cultural norms,&quot; like respect for each other, speaking our truth <br/>
when we can, listening to each other.  These aren&#39;t stated in the &quot;rule <br/>
book,&quot; though because there is no rule book.  We just try to treat each <br/>
other this way.  There are certainly times when we&#39;re antagonistic towards <br/>
each other for one reason or other, but because we respect and love each <br/>
other we work it out.  I try to help Liam whenever I can and certainly <br/>
whenever he wants me to.  We are ALL learning here.<br/>

like, &quot;Sounds like ______ doesn&#39;t like that.&quot;  Your son may be bored or <br/>
feeling yucky in some way.  This would be my cue to help him resolve those <br/>
feelings in a good way.  It could mean talking together, but more than <br/>
likely it could mean that some snack is in order or pulling out some <br/>
interesting thing that your son hasn&#39;t seen before or in a long time.  It <br/>
may mean that it&#39;s time to change the venue altogether and go for a walk or <br/>
to the park or something like that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14438672">I think you have gotten a few good ideas about your child calling out after <br/>
the one you watch. I can&#39;t say I could add anything new.<br/>
<br/>
As far as rules go, I&#39;m not sure one would really call them rules. Well <br/>
maybe we do have one, one big one. Keep the front door closed at all times! <br/>
Not just because of the baby but mostly because of one cat that is dying to <br/>
get out and two dogs who would just love to terrorize the neighborhood. <br/>
Being that one is a Beagle, we&#39;d never see her again. (you can see the dog <br/>
post about hunting dogs!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, no rules. I guess things we&#39;ve just always done that no one <br/>
questions or has a problem with.<br/>
<br/>
All 4 kids take showers every night. The only exception is when they swim in <br/>
the evening and see no point in getting wet again! Food comes and goes <br/>
around this house so much it&#39;s no big deal. The 2 year old eats better on <br/>
the run so I&#39;m use to following through her path with the vacuum. (don&#39;t get <br/>
a mental pic of me chasing after her with the vacuum!)<br/>
<br/>
The kids generally eat in the dining room but mostly in the playroom. We use <br/>
to eat in the kitchen too but I lost my table in there because of 2 dog <br/>
crates. My husband, myself and sometimes our oldest will eat in the living <br/>
room watching TV from one of my stack tables and sometimes on a movie night, <br/>
we&#39;ll have dessert in there. Teeth get brushed twice a day but only because <br/>
that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done. I don&#39;t force and the kids don&#39;t complain, <br/>
although I will ask if it was &quot;done yet.&quot; The playroom gets picked up every <br/>
night also, but again, it&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done. If the kids go to bed <br/>
with stuff on the floor, no big deal. I&#39;ll do it or just leave it and it <br/>
gets done the next day. I guess some things have become a habit with us and <br/>
with the kids not giving us a hard time at all about it, it never became a <br/>
battle or a rule.<br/>
<br/>
I know some people think it odd that none of our kids has ever slept with <br/>
us. Point is, none of them have ever asked or had a problem sleeping in <br/>
their own bed. I have asked them on occasion and they say &quot;No Thank You.&quot; I <br/>
do have good kids!!! Just meaning maybe a bit easier than others.<br/>

Why not? He&#39;s being obnoxious on purpose. He either needs some of your <br/>
attention, or is getting a kick out of annoying another person that can&#39;t <br/>
defend themselves.<br/>
How is that ok?<br/>
I would tell my dh to knock it off if he was pestering someone smaller and <br/>
less defensible. I have no hesitation in telling a child to stop taunting <br/>
another person.<br/>
I would also try to understand why the behavior is happening and try to <br/>
accomodate the need they are not having fulfilled.....boredom, need for <br/>
attention, SOMETHING real is going on to provoke the behavior.<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t make it ok for the adult present to allow the other child to <br/>
suffer because your child just feels like bugging them!!<br/>
