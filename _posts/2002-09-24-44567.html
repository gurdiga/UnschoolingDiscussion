<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328659583">Hi everyone. I have been lurking around here for about 3-4 months and figured that I <br/>
should probably introduce myself, especially since I will probably be posting with<br/>
questions pretty soon! My name is Stephanie, married to dh Jeff and we have two boys, <br/>
Jason (5.5 yo, will be 6 in Dec) and Kyle (2.5 will be 3 in Feb). Jason did go to <br/>
a very relaxed play-based preschool for 2 years (2.5 hrs 3 days/week the first year<br/>
and 4 days/week the second). At that time I had just started really considering hsing<br/>
and last year I still had not convinced Jeff. Finally convinced him and here we are.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that I am having very similar feelings as I did when I found an <br/>
Attachment Parenting board when my oldest was a year old. I was amazed to find<br/>
that there were people who were raising kids the way that my heart was telling <br/>
me too and that they weren&#39;t spoiling or ruining them like everyone told me that<br/>
I would LOL! I met my first hsers online at that site and at the time thought <br/>
that it was great for others, but not for me. But as time went on, I realized <br/>
that I couldn&#39;t not hs - it just makes too much sense to me and seems like<br/>
a natural extension of my parenting. <br/>
<br/>
I started researching online, trying to get a feel for curriculums and options. <br/>
Read tons and tons of books. Even checked out 100 EZ lessons for teaching your<br/>
child to read but couldn&#39;t get past the directions that said that I had to read<br/>
the pages *exactly* as they were written or I would mess it up. I decided that<br/>
even if it might work for Jason it was just too structured for *me*! I found<br/>
unschooling.com a few months ago and have been reading the archives like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how many Ah-Ha! moments I have been having. My hubby thinks that <br/>
I have lost it because I have been staying up late just reading, reading and <br/>
reading. Trying to take it all in. I feel pretty comfortable with unschooling,<br/>
although I am finding that I still need to work on my mental checklists...I<br/>
am still seeing things in semi-schoolish terms. But I think that will change<br/>
with time and seeing my boys continue to blossom. What I am really trying to <br/>
wrap my mind around is letting go and trusting the boys in other areas. I just <br/>
removed all restrictions on tv 2 weeks ago (wasn&#39;t much to remove...when Jason was<br/>
younger, we had a 1 hr limit, which had gradually changed to a no tv in the morning<br/>
rule). So far, so good I think....I may post more about this later. I really<br/>
want to get rid of the restrictions on junk food (this is a major issue lately)<br/>
but hubby will take a little more convincing. I am also actively looking at other<br/>
ways that I try to control the boys and rethinking what I am trying to accomplish.<br/>
The funny thing is that I have always been one of the most relaxed (when it comes<br/>
to rules) moms of all my friends! I don&#39;t use &quot;time outs&quot; (although I do remove<br/>
Jason from a situation if needed and try to help him calm down), don&#39;t force my <br/>
kids to say sorry (although Jason is actually pretty good about doing this himself),<br/>
and generally try to limit my nos. This list has helped me realize that I really <br/>
can do an even better job at that. I think that I read someone here (or on<br/>
the boards) who posted about trying to be an advocate for their child to get what they<br/>
want out of life, rather then being the person who stands in their way. This really<br/>
spoke to me.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is getting long. I have so much I want to say and so little time to say it<br/>
in! I definitely have lots of questions as I try to sort through everything. I still have<br/>
a long way to go, but I am getting there, I think. The thing that really gets me is how<br/>
much *fun* this is! I feel so guilty some days, especially when I talk with my friends<br/>
with kids in school. But they all think that I am nuts anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading so far and thank you for sharing this wonderful way of life with me!<br/>

Hi Stephanie,<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you are off to a great start. The whole trusting your boys issue <br/>
will come with time. Some people seem to get it right away, although I think <br/>
everyone has their doubts in some way or another every now and then. The <br/>
important thing is to not act on it right away and you usually find the kids <br/>
are fine before you get too much of a chance to really think about your <br/>
decision. If there is a restriction you are thinking of eliminating, I guess <br/>
the best thing is to just jump right in there. Easing into it really defeats <br/>
the purpose. I struggled with this recently when it was regarding my oldest <br/>
and her having a curfew. I was sweating it out, more so because of what my <br/>
husband would have said. He was dead set against me lifting it. Luckily she <br/>
has been great about it and very responsible. My husband even acknowledged <br/>
that I was right and he was wrong. Of course I made it seem like I had all <br/>
the confidence in the world, but secretly I was wondering myself!!!!<br/>
<br/>
And as far as I&#39;m concerned, just because you try something out, if it gets <br/>
too uncomfortable for you, that doesn&#39;t mean you have to still do it.<br/>
<br/>
As many times as my kids pick their own dinners, I do have dinners at other <br/>
times that we all sit down and eat the same thing. Mind you I don&#39;t make <br/>
something that we all won&#39;t like, but I do make the decision for us to do it <br/>
all together. And I could also say we don&#39;t have set bedtimes, but I do <br/>
suggest when I see them getting tired that they get some sleep. And that is <br/>
because I don&#39;t like them sleeping until noon because we won&#39;t get out and <br/>
doing things that we all enjoy doing. So there are ways to let them decide <br/>
and have more of a free rein without making it uncomfortable for one parent <br/>
or the other.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy and have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Mary B<br/>

 </span></blockquote>woohoo!!  glad that worked out well!<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was away for the weekend, at an anime convention in Denver.  I expected <br/>
him back sometime late in the day Monday, or that night.<br/>
<br/>
Monday (yesterday) I got up and came to the computer to find a little folder <br/>
from a Holiday Inn with a room number, an e-mail confirmation printout I  <br/>
know he took with him, and to see he was the last one on AOL.   That was <br/>
cool, knowing he was in the next room and a whole day early! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly and Marty had still been awake when he got home at 1:00 a.m.<br/>
<br/>
1:00 p.m. he got up and told us all stories for hours, showed us photos on <br/>
the webpage, showed us the things he had bought, paid me $70 he owed me <br/>
because he had saved and taken more money than he needed to spend, asked me <br/>
to cut his hair off (that was unexpected), and then went to the gaming shop <br/>
where he works.  Even though he had the day off, he usually runs the anime <br/>
gaming session Monday from 4:30 to 6:30, and he went by just to voluntarily <br/>
help out.<br/>
<br/>
That is what can happen when you let a sixteen year old have a lot of freedom.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah Sandra, I&#39;m glad that worked too! Thanks for the vote of confidence <br/>
before I actually made the decision. I was just so afraid, being that Tara <br/>
is not homeschooled, that it would back fire on me. Let&#39;s face it, she was <br/>
raised different from early on and had under gone quite a few life altering <br/>
experiences because of that. Plus, even though I&#39;ve seen her change for the <br/>
better in the past year, peer pressure is still greatly on my mind and in <br/>
her daily life. I really do think my husband and I both will be very <br/>
different with the other 3 when they get to that age because of the natural <br/>
progression of how things are going.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, things are going better than ever and we are all happy!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>

I am headed. I have found in the past that I have to drag him kicking <br/>
and screaming sometimes, but he eventually comes around. Just drives me<br/>
nuts in the meantime. He still is not 100% convinced about hsing (much<br/>
less unschooling) but he did support me when my dad (who is NOT happy <br/>
about me hsing) talked to him. He told my dad that &quot;his daughter is <br/>
a smart woman who was perfectly capable of teaching our children and <br/>
that he trusts my judgment&quot;. Blew me over when I found out. :o) Now if<br/>
I can just get him to trust me on trusting the kids....<br/>

company around the time Jason was born and he acts as the CIO. So his hobby happens<br/>
to be work related...I keep trying to have him make the connection that hsing is<br/>
my &quot;work&quot;, so my online time researching is just as &quot;valid&quot;. But I also have some<br/>
hobby related email lists (I enjoy rubber stamping) and a wonderful email list<br/>
of friends from the ap board I mentioned earlier. Time spent on these lists are <br/>
just as &quot;valid&quot; to me. It was this realization that has made it easier for me<br/>
to accept that Jason&#39;s computer games are just as &quot;valid&quot; to him.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah...this makes sense. The whole idea is that the kids know that it <br/>
is truly their decision which is not possible if you ease in (which<br/>
means keeping some control). It is funny...I got rid of all tv rules <br/>
about 2 weeks ago. Things have been going pretty well. I have found that<br/>
if I go outside to work in the yard or suggest that we do something together<br/>
they are more likely to turn off the tv and join me then before when we<br/>
had restrictions (when nothing I said could get them to join me if they <br/>
were watching tv, I guess because they knew that they only had a short time<br/>
to watch). I have also noticed that Jason (my oldest) does not sit absolutely<br/>
glued to the tv anymore...he is more likely to be playing with his legos or <br/>
other toys while watching. However, yesterday, I woke up with this nagging <br/>
feeling...it bothered me that the boys no longer played cars or other things<br/>
with each other in the morning, but rather just watched tv. It also was <br/>
bothering me that it seems like every time we walk in the house the tv goes on<br/>
first thing. I decided that it was too early to really judge this experiment.<br/>
Then the boys ran in and asked me to help set up their train set! They had turned<br/>
the tv off and wanted to play trains. :o) Go figure. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was actually a very eye opening &quot;unschooling at work&quot; day. It started out<br/>
not so great. I was trying to get the kids out of the house so that I could run an<br/>
errand (I wanted to get it over with so we could do whatever we wanted the rest of <br/>
the day). They were dragging their feet and we did not get going until around 1.<br/>
The store we went to was near a Zany Brainy so of course Jason wanted to go. My first<br/>
reaction was no, because we had not come out to go there. But then I realized there<br/>
really was no real reason not to stop in. So we stopped in to check out the legos.<br/>
Didn&#39;t know how much money he had at home, plus we have a lego outlet near us, so he<br/>
decided to wait before buying anything. Came home. I had thought that we would try to<br/>
get together with his best friend since he hasn&#39;t seen much of him since school started<br/>
but Jason got on the computer. I kept nagging him and getting more and more upset that <br/>
he was not doing anything to help get ready to go. Finally realized that it really was<br/>
his choice. As soon as I made that realization, the day got much better. I asked<br/>
Kyle if he wanted to go outside. I started weeding and Kyle started playing. In about <br/>
15 mins Jason came out and started playing with Kyle. Then they helped me dig holes<br/>
and I transplanted some plants. Came back in and instead of turning on the tv, Jason<br/>
asked me if we could put on some music. He choose my Cats cd (I love broadway shows)<br/>
and we moved the coffee table over and they did some great dancing! (we also talked about<br/>
what an overture is). While dancing, Kyle (my 2.5 yo) went over to one speaker and put<br/>
his head down to listen, ran over to the other speaker and listened, and then went back <br/>
to the first one. Jason did the same thing and asked me why sound was coming out of<br/>
both speakers. I started playing with the balance which they thought was really cool.<br/>
We had dinner and when I added Jason&#39;s soccer schedule to the calendar, Jason wanted<br/>
to look at it and started naming off the days of the week (he knew sun, mon and tues).<br/>
Then after dinner Kyle found my calculator and was punching random numbers into it. Jason<br/>
asked me what the number was...it was -2.34556 or something like that. Then Jason <br/>
wanted to know what a negative number was. I went and googled it and found an explanation<br/>
with a number line, so we talked about it a little while. SO basically once I gave up<br/>
control of the day it went great LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I am just absolutely amazed at how Jason&#39;s mind works. The things that he ponders.<br/>
He wanted to know that other day how metal was made. He will ask me from out of the<br/>
blue if 3+3 makes 6 and then go back to whatever he was doing.<br/>

&gt; it. Luckily she <br/>
&gt; has been great about it and very responsible. My husband even <br/>
&gt; acknowledged <br/>
&gt; that I was right and he was wrong. Of course I made it seem <br/>
&gt; like I had all <br/>
&gt; the confidence in the world, but secretly I was wondering myself!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I have also noticed that Jason (my oldest) does not sit absolutely<br/>
glued to the tv anymore...he is more likely to be playing with his legos or <br/>
other toys while watching. However, yesterday, I woke up with this nagging <br/>
feeling...it bothered me that the boys no longer played cars or other things <br/>
with each other in the morning, but rather just watched tv. It also was <br/>
bothering me that it seems like every time we walk in the house the tv goes <br/>
on first thing. I decided that it was too early to really judge this <br/>
experiment.<br/>
Then the boys ran in and asked me to help set up their train set! They had <br/>
turned the tv off and wanted to play trains. :o) Go figure.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See, it takes care of itself before you know it!!! And my two middle ones <br/>
are like that too with the TV. I notice that it&#39;s on and sometimes they <br/>
watch and sometimes not, they play and sometimes they do both. Just when I <br/>
think they aren&#39;t paying attention, I find that they are listening to what <br/>
interests them. They do that with what&#39;s going on in the house too. The only <br/>
thing I ask is that the last one to leave the room turns the TV off. Makes <br/>
my noise level around here a little more manageable!! (a little!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Finally realized that it really was his choice. As soon as I made that <br/>
realization, the day got much better. SO basically once I gave up<br/>
control of the day it went great LOL!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a great day and also sounds like you have the idea and more <br/>
importantly, the kids do too!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am just absolutely amazed at how Jason&#39;s mind works. The things that he <br/>
ponders.<br/>
He wanted to know that other day how metal was made. He will ask me from out <br/>
of the<br/>
blue if 3+3 makes 6 and then go back to whatever he was doing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that just great? Sometimes you have to just wonder what goes on in <br/>
those little minds. Up pops a question and you wonder where in the world did <br/>
that come from and then it&#39;s on to something else that fast again. Ahhh, to <br/>
be young again!!!<br/>
