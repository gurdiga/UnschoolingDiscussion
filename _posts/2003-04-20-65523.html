<div id="ygrps-yiv-37602902">Hi everyone, <br/>
My daughter Kiele thrives on praise and I have heard two different views about praise and how it affects children.  The first view being that it&#39;s good for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work that they have accomplished or with what ever they have done.  The second view is that a child who is always praised will only do things to please adults rather than to please herself, to hear others talk good about her.  Kiele looks for praise constantly although I do see the pride that she takes in her work whether it&#39;s building with blocks or coloring a picture, however she looks for my approval to see if I like what she has done.  I know that this is normal for a 4 year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all the time for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some pointers on this I would appreciate it...<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866158888">When my little ones bring me something they made that they&#39;re very <br/>
pleased with, I make a fuss over them.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t do is tell them that if they make their beds and brush <br/>
their teeth every day they get stickers or praise.  They don&#39;t get <br/>
praised for things that I tell them to do in order for me to get them <br/>
to keep doing them, but they get encouraged when they do something on <br/>
their own that they&#39;re happy about.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that the thing you don&#39;t want to do with praise is try to get <br/>
them to do stuff by praising them.  In other words, you don&#39;t want to <br/>
withhold kind, affirming, words that tell your child she&#39;s a <br/>
wonderful person until she does something that you consider <br/>
praiseworthy.  You want to make sure she doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s worth <br/>
more as a person when she performs a certain way.  <br/>
<br/>
But when she says, &quot;Look what I&#39;m doing, Mom!&quot;, she&#39;s looking for you <br/>
to be excited with her.  If my husband painted the windows while I <br/>
was out and I came home and he showed me, all excited about the work <br/>
he did, he would be a little disappointed if I didn&#39;t say, &quot;Wow, you <br/>
did a really good job!&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779228959">I think it often has to do with the type of praise being given.  Truthful <br/>
praise, imho, can do no harm.  I also think there is such a thing as <br/>
overdoing it, though.  For example, pulling out the bells and whistles for <br/>
*every tiny little thing*.  &quot;WOW, you are the BEST child in the WHOLE ENTIRE <br/>
WORLD&quot; is great here and there.  We over did those type of statements with <br/>
our now 6 yr old and she went through quite a phase of letting EVERYONE know <br/>
just how incredibly wonderful she was at any opportunity.  That tends to <br/>
turn people off, even their friends.<br/>
<br/>
I take every opportunity to tell my children when they are doing something <br/>
right, nice, and so on.  &quot;Thanks for helping your sister with ________, that <br/>
was very nice of you.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you for _____ all by yourself!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even using gentle parenting techniques, it is so easy to pay more attention <br/>
to the &#39;bad&#39; things.  I think the key is to *catch* our children being good <br/>
and doing well and honestly comment on those things.  Offering unrealistic <br/>
praise *can* be detrimental to a child who *may* grow up thinking they can <br/>
do no wrong.  There *may* also come a time, further down the road that they <br/>
become fearful of sharing important situations or times of bad judgment in <br/>
fear of what their parents might think of their *perfect* child.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose parents treated her as if she were THE best child on <br/>
earth.  She became pregnant at 14 and went to her choir teacher at school to <br/>
confide because she was so terrified of letting her parents down.  She truly <br/>
believed that they thought she was perfect.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to say this extreme situation is normal or even probable in <br/>
every circumstance.  I just think we owe it to our children to be honest <br/>
with them and let them know that we ARE proud of them for their <br/>
accomplishments and will offer honest praise accordingly, but that they are <br/>
also allowed to make mistakes and that we will help them resolve their <br/>
mistakes and still love them regardless.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yr old made a rather large mistake recently and I calmly explained why <br/>
I was upset.  A couple of days later, she wrote me a letter, apologizing, <br/>
suggesting a consequence very appropriate to the situation and offered an <br/>
appropriate solution.  All on her own!  When I told her how proud of her I <br/>
was and how impressed I was and kept going, she finally stopped me and said, <br/>
&quot;Goolleeee Mom, you don&#39;t have to over do it or I might do it again!&quot;  Of <br/>
course, she was laughing but it was a wise lesson.  I LOVE learning things <br/>
FROM my children! :)<br/>

&lt;&lt;My daughter Kiele thrives on praise and I have heard two different views<br/>
about praise and how it affects children.  The first view being that it&#39;s<br/>
good for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work that they have<br/>

the time for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some<br/>
pointers on this I would appreciate it...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course when a child does something they are excited about, they want to<br/>
share and get a response back. One that will make them feel good. I also see<br/>
the point of how praising just everything isn&#39;t good either. I watch what I<br/>
say and how I say it. I make sure to comment on how much work it looks like<br/>
went into that picture they just did or how I love the way they used color.<br/>
Something else beside just &quot;oh isn&#39;t that lovely, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; Making<br/>
sure I praise the effort instead of just the picture. I think that makes a<br/>
big difference. Not just the result but the process to get there. I think<br/>
that helps so much with their self esteem and not always concentrating on<br/>
whether the end result will be to anyone else&#39;s satisfaction. I do this with<br/>
all comments, or I should say I try on most. Even with something like<br/>
cleaning up the playroom without me asking. Instead of just saying great<br/>
job, I will comment on how nice it was to do that because they know it makes<br/>
me feel good and how much time it took them and how organized everything<br/>
looks. Hope this helps some.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666877542">I also wanted to add to my last post that if it&#39;s something my child did<br/>
creatively, like a picture or making up a game, I always ask them how they<br/>
feel about what they did. Sometimes they are unhappy with it and just asking<br/>
to see what someone else thinks. If that&#39;s the case, I can hear why they<br/>
aren&#39;t satisfied and help them figure out a better way or point out other<br/>
good things they may have not seen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152223718">Too much gushing can cause the child to start not to really trust your <br/>
judgment, and so too much praise can prevent you from being able to honestly <br/>
praise them in the future.  <br/>
<br/>
When kids were little and would show me something I try to think what I would <br/>
do if it were an adult who was showing me some project or hobby of theirs.  I <br/>
could converse with them about it, ask them questions to draw them out to <br/>
tell me more about how they did it, and what the characters are doing, or <br/>
where they got the idea, or something that creates more understanding and <br/>
appreciation for me, and gives them a chance to explain more about what they <br/>
made/built/wrote/planned.<br/>
<br/>
Today some friends came over who hadn&#39;t been over for a few months, and Keith <br/>
was showing them his yard project.  Then we ended up in the garage to get a <br/>
tool, and they saw his current wood carving.   Thinking back on those <br/>
conversations, as candid examples of honest interaction involving praise, <br/>
they didn&#39;t gush, they didn&#39;t use &quot;the poodle voice,&quot; and they didn&#39;t say <br/>
anything like &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you&quot; or &quot;This is WONderful.&quot;  They asked <br/>
questions about what kind of gate he was going to use, what kind of tree one <br/>
tree was, and about the wood, they talked about poplar wood and carving <br/>
patterns and what he could do to make his knotwork horse look less <br/>
dragonlike.  He told them about the bed he&#39;s making.  We talked about <br/>
medieval tents (we&#39;ve discovered a new Viking tent design).<br/>
<br/>
There were no kids around.  Keith was getting some very positive feedback, <br/>
but they were also drawing him out to teach them more about what he was doing.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was doing some painting last week, and using nail polish for some of <br/>
her paint.  We talked about textures and whether other paints and markers <br/>
could go with it or whether they chemically clashed.  <br/>
<br/>
I ask sometimes if she wants me to keep something for her, or if she wants to <br/>
put it up.  Sometimes it&#39;s yes, and sometimes no.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some parents say &quot;I LOVE this and I want to put it on the wall&quot; <br/>
when the kid might not be finished with it, or might have just wanted someone <br/>
to say &quot;I like the way you wrote your name on that picture.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
As kids get older, one thing they&#39;re learning from us is how to act with <br/>
others, and so if we treat them like other people instead of like kids, we <br/>
model respect and interest instead of just praise.  <br/>
<br/>
When my husband shows me something he&#39;s making (or I show him something new, <br/>
like a webpage or a sewing project) we can TELL how the other person feels <br/>
about it, so saying &quot;How do you feel about this?&quot; seems to impersonal for <br/>
people who live together and can read each other already.  If a kid brings a <br/>
picture she doesn&#39;t like, wouldn&#39;t the mom know?<br/>
<br/>
One way I found to keep from just making mom-noises was to remember not to <br/>
say &quot;This is good.&quot;  I don&#39;t KNOW something is &quot;good,&quot; and it makes better <br/>
sense (and better communication, and conversation) for me to say &quot;I really <br/>
like this&quot; (&quot;I&quot; messages) or &quot;How pretty, especially the trees.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is very important.. the &quot;truthful&quot; part.  Of course, you don&#39;t <br/>
want to criticize a childs efforts by saying.. UHHG, that is awful, that is <br/>
so ugly, that is worthless.. BUT, I have also read ( and heard) that if you <br/>
constantly tell a child thier efforts are WONDERFUL, GREAT, THE BEST!, and <br/>
they know in thier hearts its really lousy, then that breaks down thier trust <br/>
in you.    A good way to approach this and open up the lines of communication <br/>
is to ask the child what they think about the &quot;thing&quot;, or how they feel about <br/>
it.  For example, a child paints a picture and brings it to you, all <br/>
excited.. LOOK Mommy, LOOK! at my picture.. isn&#39;t it pretty?  OH, let me see, <br/>
yes, I think it is pretty, what do you think?  Do you like it?   Maybe say, <br/>
my favorite part is the &quot;X&quot;, what do you like best about it?    Then you can <br/>
talk about the picture, maybe the kid will say, I love the &quot;X&quot; but, I think <br/>
the &quot;Y&quot; look stupid..   Ask why they think the Y looks stupid, how could they <br/>
fix it.. etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
   Another good way to encourage children without &quot;labeling&quot; them is to <br/>
praise them with a variety of adjectives.  Instead of always saying.. &quot;good, <br/>
great, wonderful, smart&quot;, use more direct and descriptive words .. For <br/>
instance, instead of saying. &quot;oh that is a great picture&quot;.. say.. Oh, you are <br/>
so creative and expressive with your paints&quot;.    Instead of saying, &quot;you are <br/>
so smart for figuring that out&quot;,  say, &quot;that took some real logic and <br/>
calcuation to solve&quot;  Say a child picks up all of thier toys and tidys a room <br/>
up without being asked to help.  Instead of saying,  oh, what a good boy, <br/>
thank you so much.. Say, Thank you,  you are so considerate and helpful.  You <br/>
are an excellent organizer.  <br/>
<br/>
 I have always tried to express to my children what wonderful qualities they <br/>
have without lumping them all under &quot;good or smart&quot; categories.    I think it <br/>
strengthens thier sense of self and uniqueness and boosts their self esteem.  <br/>

I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with Life Learning Magazine?  In the last few months they have run a series of articles on praising your child.   I think they&#39;ve been very interesting and helpful.   They are on the same tone as Punished by Rewards,  that someone else suggested.   This author is Naomi Aldort.  It says also that your can read her articles at www.naturalchild.org and other sites.<br/>

Thank you for the feedback on the praise bit, most of what you have offered<br/>
I already do, so I guess I&#39;m on the right path.  However I do like some of<br/>
Sandra&#39;s suggestions about asking how she came to make/build/plan something,<br/>
to give her a chance to to explain and understand how she came to make it.<br/>
And it makes sense to give her feedback as if she were an adult, I&#39;ll have<br/>
to remember that!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
When my little ones bring me something they made that they&#39;re very<br/>
pleased with, I make a fuss over them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t do is tell them that if they make their beds and brush<br/>
their teeth every day they get stickers or praise.  They don&#39;t get<br/>
praised for things that I tell them to do in order for me to get them<br/>
to keep doing them, but they get encouraged when they do something on<br/>
their own that they&#39;re happy about.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the thing you don&#39;t want to do with praise is try to get<br/>
them to do stuff by praising them.  In other words, you don&#39;t want to<br/>
withhold kind, affirming, words that tell your child she&#39;s a<br/>
wonderful person until she does something that you consider<br/>
praiseworthy.  You want to make sure she doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s worth<br/>
more as a person when she performs a certain way.<br/>
<br/>
But when she says, &quot;Look what I&#39;m doing, Mom!&quot;, she&#39;s looking for you<br/>
to be excited with her.  If my husband painted the windows while I<br/>
was out and I came home and he showed me, all excited about the work<br/>
he did, he would be a little disappointed if I didn&#39;t say, &quot;Wow, you<br/>
did a really good job!&quot;<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; My daughter Kiele thrives on praise and I have heard two different<br/>
views about praise and how it affects children.  The first view being<br/>
that it&#39;s good for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work<br/>
that they have accomplished or with what ever they have done.  The<br/>
second view is that a child who is always praised will only do things<br/>
to please adults rather than to please herself, to hear others talk<br/>
good about her.  Kiele looks for praise constantly although I do see<br/>
the pride that she takes in her work whether it&#39;s building with<br/>
blocks or coloring a picture, however she looks for my approval to<br/>
see if I like what she has done.  I know that this is normal for a 4<br/>
year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all the time<br/>
for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some<br/>
pointers on this I would appreciate it...<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>

  He&#39;s also focused on making friendships through the activities that<br/>
  he is good at (or at least enjoys), like computer gaming, D&D, etc.<br/>
  Right now he is also finding that he can connect with older (16/17)<br/>
  girls. He&#39;s got a couple of friends who are girls right now. He&#39;s<br/>
  also always been better at connecting with adults than kids his own<br/>
  age.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you for your kind words. Funny how I couldn&#39;t think of focusing on<br/>
her strong points.Guess i was feeling a bit funky.Molly is still trying to<br/>
find what she is good at. She has a sister (the hypersensitive one)who is<br/>
mega quick and finds every activity easy and is noticed by others right away<br/>
for her immediate skill. Hard on Molly.Her sister does not rub this in at<br/>
all but molly notices it none the less. We have been focusing on accepting<br/>
herself for where she is at.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Has she always been unschooled? Does she have any school induced<br/>
  stuff to get over?<br/>
<br/>
  Molly has been home now for 5 years and really unschooled for 2-3 years.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if she has stuff still to get over. I guess being put in<br/>
special reading and needing extra help always.<br/>
<br/>
  !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   I like the idea of finding areas for her to use her body individually.<br/>
She so far loves rythmic gymnastics as there is no focus on others ability.<br/>
She has only been involved for about 1 month.She laughed with one girl over<br/>
a move they made and was very excited. This alone was social contact enough<br/>
for her. One girl is seeking her out .Molly is hesitant but we are working<br/>
on trying one visit and seeing how it goes. I am helping her with wording to<br/>
make the call.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Help her find her strengths and don&#39;t focus too much attention on her<br/>
  weaker points. Let her shine. That plus your support and love will<br/>
  help her remain Whole.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank You again. I sometimes forget about this.<br/>

&gt; My in-laws are right near West Palm Beach in Lake Worth. We go down<br/>
&gt; there, but not that often. Maybe once a year. I&#39;ll be sure to put<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; word out next time we go. I love meeting other unschoolers!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  My parents live about 5 minutes from Lake Worth.<br/>
Also about 5 minutes from Dreher Park zoo.  Dh and my dad took my<br/>
younger 2 to the zoo this past visit.  I like to go there just to<br/>
climb the trees there in the park.  I grew up climing trees like that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have gone to the Dreher Park Zoo and Science Museum and<br/>
sometimes<br/>
&gt; the Lion Country Safari. Our big find the last time we were down<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; the Morikami Gardens. I&#39;m not sure exactly where it was, but it was<br/>
&gt; within 15 minutes of their house. It was this fabulous acreage of<br/>
zen<br/>
&gt; gardens right in the middle of a bustling Florida avenue. Lots of<br/>
&gt; information on the former Japanese settlers and gardens in general.<br/>
&gt; Art work too. We loved it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My Dad takes the grand kids to Lion Country Safari every Thankgiving.<br/>
The women go shopping that day. (We love Ross, TJ Max and Marshalls)<br/>
My mom has mentioned a garden that sounds like what you&#39;ve<br/>
described.  We&#39;ll have to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know next time your heading down.<br/>

Subject: Re: Praise<br/>
<br/>
I think it often has to do with the type of praise being given.  Truthful<br/>
praise, imho, can do no harm.  I also think there is such a thing as<br/>
overdoing it, though.  For example, pulling out the bells and whistles for<br/>
*every tiny little thing*.  &quot;WOW, you are the BEST child in the WHOLE ENTIRE<br/>
WORLD&quot; is great here and there.  We over did those type of statements with<br/>
our now 6 yr old and she went through quite a phase of letting EVERYONE know<br/>
just how incredibly wonderful she was at any opportunity.  That tends to<br/>
turn people off, even their friends.<br/>
<br/>
I take every opportunity to tell my children when they are doing something<br/>
right, nice, and so on.  &quot;Thanks for helping your sister with ________, that<br/>
was very nice of you.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you for _____ all by yourself!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even using gentle parenting techniques, it is so easy to pay more attention<br/>
to the &#39;bad&#39; things.  I think the key is to *catch* our children being good<br/>
and doing well and honestly comment on those things.  Offering unrealistic<br/>
praise *can* be detrimental to a child who *may* grow up thinking they can<br/>
do no wrong.  There *may* also come a time, further down the road that they<br/>
become fearful of sharing important situations or times of bad judgment in<br/>
fear of what their parents might think of their *perfect* child.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose parents treated her as if she were THE best child on<br/>
earth.  She became pregnant at 14 and went to her choir teacher at school to<br/>
confide because she was so terrified of letting her parents down.  She truly<br/>
believed that they thought she was perfect.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to say this extreme situation is normal or even probable in<br/>
every circumstance.  I just think we owe it to our children to be honest<br/>
with them and let them know that we ARE proud of them for their<br/>
accomplishments and will offer honest praise accordingly, but that they are<br/>
also allowed to make mistakes and that we will help them resolve their<br/>
mistakes and still love them regardless.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yr old made a rather large mistake recently and I calmly explained why<br/>
I was upset.  A couple of days later, she wrote me a letter, apologizing,<br/>
suggesting a consequence very appropriate to the situation and offered an<br/>
appropriate solution.  All on her own!  When I told her how proud of her I<br/>
was and how impressed I was and kept going, she finally stopped me and said,<br/>
&quot;Goolleeee Mom, you don&#39;t have to over do it or I might do it again!&quot;  Of<br/>
course, she was laughing but it was a wise lesson.  I LOVE learning things<br/>
FROM my children! :)<br/>

 Weird.  What good does it do for a baby to identify birds?  What good would<br/>
 it do a child in New Mexico to identify a cardinal, unless just for fun?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the program that guy started (you know the &quot;teach your baby<br/>
to<br/>
read&quot; guy) called &quot;teach your baby encyclopedic knowledge&quot; or something like<br/>
that.<br/>
I looked into it many years ago (silly me) and couldn&#39;t believe the<br/>
flashcards and memorization stuff they were pushing on little babies!! It<br/>
was<br/>
ridiculous.<br/>
All so the kid could recognize different birds, names of things and<br/>
definitions.<br/>
It&#39;s all about the parents, not the child.<br/>
They feel oh-so-good when little Johnny can show off his incredible<br/>
knowledge.<br/>
Only problem is, if you can look it up in an encyclopedia, why does the kid<br/>
need to memorize it at all? How silly.<br/>
Sick people.<br/>

&lt;&lt;My daughter Kiele thrives on praise and I have heard two different views<br/>
about praise and how it affects children.  The first view being that it&#39;s<br/>
good for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work that they have<br/>
accomplished or with what ever they have done.  The second view is that a<br/>
child who is always praised will only do things to please adults rather than<br/>
to please herself, to hear others talk good about her.  Kiele looks for<br/>
praise constantly although I do see the pride that she takes in her work<br/>
whether it&#39;s building with blocks or coloring a picture, however she looks<br/>
for my approval to see if I like what she has done.  I know that this is<br/>
normal for a 4 year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all<br/>
the time for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some<br/>
pointers on this I would appreciate it...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course when a child does something they are excited about, they want to<br/>
share and get a response back. One that will make them feel good. I also see<br/>
the point of how praising just everything isn&#39;t good either. I watch what I<br/>
say and how I say it. I make sure to comment on how much work it looks like<br/>
went into that picture they just did or how I love the way they used color.<br/>
Something else beside just &quot;oh isn&#39;t that lovely, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; Making<br/>
sure I praise the effort instead of just the picture. I think that makes a<br/>
big difference. Not just the result but the process to get there. I think<br/>
that helps so much with their self esteem and not always concentrating on<br/>
whether the end result will be to anyone else&#39;s satisfaction. I do this with<br/>
all comments, or I should say I try on most. Even with something like<br/>
cleaning up the playroom without me asking. Instead of just saying great<br/>
job, I will comment on how nice it was to do that because they know it makes<br/>
me feel good and how much time it took them and how organized everything<br/>
looks. Hope this helps some.<br/>

I also wanted to add to my last post that if it&#39;s something my child did<br/>
creatively, like a picture or making up a game, I always ask them how they<br/>
feel about what they did. Sometimes they are unhappy with it and just asking<br/>
to see what someone else thinks. If that&#39;s the case, I can hear why they<br/>
aren&#39;t satisfied and help them figure out a better way or point out other<br/>
good things they may have not seen.<br/>

Yes, all I could think of was &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot;.  Quite sad.<br/>
Some of the things people put these poor children through is just insane!<br/>
Don&#39;t you just know those poor babies are sitting there wondering how to<br/>
roll their eyes in the back of their little heads! &gt;BG&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw a similar program called &#39;teach your baby math&#39; or something to that<br/>
effect.  They have these flash cards almost a foot square with different<br/>
patterns of red dots and the baby is supposedly supposed to learn how to do<br/>
the four math facts by looking at random dot pictures.  Looks like a head<br/>
start to blindness to me!  I always wonder if those kids were the ones who<br/>
started those pictures you have to stare past to actually see the form<br/>
through all the muck.  Ah well, I&#39;m rambling again...<br/>

Sandra, When I tell my daughter she&#39;s &quot;stuck with me&quot; it&#39;s in the<br/>
context of we, her family, will not abandon her.  No matter what.  She&#39;s<br/>
come up with some rather interesting &quot;Even if...&quot; questions, and<br/>
sometimes that becomes a game, but it&#39;s also very very serious.  With<br/>
her recent query into belief systems (swim team locker room discussions<br/>
with a &quot;fundy&quot; teammate has triggered a rash of conversations!) plus our<br/>
current health issues (my cancer recurrence/current chemo & DH&#39;s<br/>
upcoming major surgery), the &quot;stuck with me&quot; has expanded into<br/>
discussing what will/may happen after death does separate us. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
We&#39;ve had some really amazing talks.  Yes, including running, suicide,<br/>
murder, going to jail, heaven/hell/reincarnation/etc, how would I<br/>
feel/what would I do if she died, she&#39;d like to live with Aunt P but<br/>
Aunt P&#39;s even older and what if she dies, wills & inheritance, oh my, on<br/>
and on.  Addressing a lot of things, curiosity, security, laws, her<br/>
sib&#39;s trials growing up (one legal name change at 18) and my own (my<br/>
father died when I was 4), what it takes (& means) to earn a living...<br/>
<br/>
Ann<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He tested us unbelievably,...my husband (ex-marine) finally looked<br/>
him straight in his eyes, after a major<br/>
meltdown on son&#39;s part, and said, &quot;get it all out, give us all you&#39;ve<br/>
got, but you&#39;re not going anywhere.  You&#39;re stuck with us.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I missed the original of this, but wanted to point out just on principle<br/>
that<br/>
kids are NOT stuck.  They can run or they can kill themselves.  I&#39;ve<br/>
known<br/>
kids who&#39;ve done both.  Trapping and holding them too hard isn&#39;t<br/>
guaranteed<br/>
to raise them to adulthood.<br/>

Subject: Re: Praise<br/>
<br/>
Too much gushing can cause the child to start not to really trust your<br/>
judgment, and so too much praise can prevent you from being able to honestly<br/>
praise them in the future.<br/>
<br/>
When kids were little and would show me something I try to think what I<br/>
would<br/>
do if it were an adult who was showing me some project or hobby of theirs.<br/>
I<br/>
could converse with them about it, ask them questions to draw them out to<br/>
tell me more about how they did it, and what the characters are doing, or<br/>
where they got the idea, or something that creates more understanding and<br/>
appreciation for me, and gives them a chance to explain more about what they<br/>
made/built/wrote/planned.<br/>
<br/>
Today some friends came over who hadn&#39;t been over for a few months, and<br/>
Keith<br/>
was showing them his yard project.  Then we ended up in the garage to get a<br/>
tool, and they saw his current wood carving.   Thinking back on those<br/>
conversations, as candid examples of honest interaction involving praise,<br/>
they didn&#39;t gush, they didn&#39;t use &quot;the poodle voice,&quot; and they didn&#39;t say<br/>
anything like &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you&quot; or &quot;This is WONderful.&quot;  They asked<br/>
questions about what kind of gate he was going to use, what kind of tree one<br/>
tree was, and about the wood, they talked about poplar wood and carving<br/>
patterns and what he could do to make his knotwork horse look less<br/>
dragonlike.  He told them about the bed he&#39;s making.  We talked about<br/>
medieval tents (we&#39;ve discovered a new Viking tent design).<br/>
<br/>
There were no kids around.  Keith was getting some very positive feedback,<br/>
but they were also drawing him out to teach them more about what he was<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was doing some painting last week, and using nail polish for some of<br/>
her paint.  We talked about textures and whether other paints and markers<br/>
could go with it or whether they chemically clashed.<br/>
<br/>
I ask sometimes if she wants me to keep something for her, or if she wants<br/>
to<br/>
put it up.  Sometimes it&#39;s yes, and sometimes no.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some parents say &quot;I LOVE this and I want to put it on the wall&quot;<br/>
when the kid might not be finished with it, or might have just wanted<br/>
someone<br/>
to say &quot;I like the way you wrote your name on that picture.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As kids get older, one thing they&#39;re learning from us is how to act with<br/>
others, and so if we treat them like other people instead of like kids, we<br/>
model respect and interest instead of just praise.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband shows me something he&#39;s making (or I show him something new,<br/>
like a webpage or a sewing project) we can TELL how the other person feels<br/>
about it, so saying &quot;How do you feel about this?&quot; seems to impersonal for<br/>
people who live together and can read each other already.  If a kid brings a<br/>
picture she doesn&#39;t like, wouldn&#39;t the mom know?<br/>
<br/>
One way I found to keep from just making mom-noises was to remember not to<br/>
say &quot;This is good.&quot;  I don&#39;t KNOW something is &quot;good,&quot; and it makes better<br/>
sense (and better communication, and conversation) for me to say &quot;I really<br/>
like this&quot; (&quot;I&quot; messages) or &quot;How pretty, especially the trees.&quot;<br/>

Anna ( my 13 yo dd) and I were just talking about preschool and daycare the<br/>
other day.  I used to work in a preschool, and it was just like you<br/>
describe.<br/>
  I loved being around the kids, but I HATED the &quot;make out your lesson plan&quot;<br/>
demands from the director ( who was really just operating under the command<br/>
of the preschool Board of Directors)   Anna and I talked about how totally<br/>
ludicrous it was to try to mold those little kids to such a structured day.<br/>
We talked about ways to nurture and &quot;take care&quot;  of 10   2 yos at one time.<br/>
How to handle &quot;nap/quiet&quot; time for kids who need and want to sleep and kids<br/>
who don&#39;t, meal times, outside time.. all the standard daycare routines.<br/>
Anna had solutions and ideas that were so wise and sensitive to children.<br/>
I<br/>
said, &quot;Anna, you are so wise, you must have lived 3 lives&quot; .. :-)<br/>
<br/>
  I know that some parents have to work. They have to put thier children in<br/>
daycare. Everything   I have learned about children in my own experiences,<br/>
coupled with my recent embracing of unschooling, has confirmed to me that<br/>
the<br/>
Montessori method of preschool/daycare is the best alternative IF a parent<br/>
has to put thier child in an out of the home child care situation.  My neice<br/>
and nephew go to a public Montessori school and they absolutely love it. If<br/>
they didnt go there, my sister would most likely homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
As we discussed Montessori methods, Anna said that she wants to have a<br/>
Montessori preschool, and maybe even a Montessori  &quot;grade&quot; school, when she<br/>
grows up.  I am going to call our local Montessori school next week and see<br/>
if she can volunteer.  She is VERY excited!<br/>

Good Morning,<br/>
I find that in some areas of Providence, this mentality applies.. When I was<br/>
first awarded placement of Brianna, I searched for day care. (I was<br/>
finishing a degree program and working.) The competition for some of the<br/>
&#39;pre-school enrichment & learning centers&#39; was fierce!!<br/>
The state was helping me pay for this, so I thought that with the state<br/>
money and what I could afford, Brianna would be in a great day care program.<br/>
My college courses were 4 days per week. 9AM-11:45AM. I found a day care<br/>
that was seemingly okay. They concentrated on organized activities. They<br/>
promised &quot;learning adventures&quot; This day care was one of the most desired in<br/>
the area!<br/>
I would drop her off at around 8:20 AM and usually I was there by noon. I<br/>
must say that the day care required payment for a full day (7AM-5:30PM).<br/>
One day, due to a major traffic problem, I arrived there at approx 12:45 PM.<br/>
I had called the office and explained the traffic situation. The office<br/>
person put me on hold. The director came on and asked me when I would be<br/>
there. I honestly couldn&#39;t give an answer. I was in traffic, it was beyond<br/>
my control. She informed me that our agreement was that I pick Brianna up<br/>
around noon. I pointed out that the center was getting paid for full time<br/>
day care and had been, in fact, providing part time day care, I also said<br/>
that this was very unusual for me to be late and that I really didn&#39;t see<br/>
the problem.<br/>
When I arrived, Brianna was sitting out by the double locked doors - by<br/>
herself- with her little school bag and jacket. She was frightened. Just a<br/>
few feet away - in her classroom, the kids were playing.<br/>
When the secretary came to open the door for me, I was pissed! I wanted to<br/>
speak to the administrator, but was told she was busy. I could see the<br/>
office, the woman was eating a salad & reading Cosmo.<br/>
I picked Brianna up and walked into the administrators office. I fired them.<br/>
Not only did I pull Brianna out, I put a stop payment on the check and had<br/>
this daycare stricken from the state rolls so the state wouldn&#39;t pay for<br/>
them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back, this action of theirs was part & parcel of training the kids.<br/>
The administrator told me that Brianna needed to be disciplined, trained -<br/>
that she was spoiled. (At this time, Brianna had seen goddess knows what<br/>
while in custody of her bio-mom who was an iv drug user.) Brianna was &<br/>
remains a rather quiet kid. Back then, she was very quiet. kids used to take<br/>
her snacks, her toys and she would say & do nothing. I couldn&#39;t understand<br/>
what this cosmos reading woman was talking about!!<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of the semester, Brianna went into another day care that was so<br/>
much better, however, it was serendipitous that I got her in there!! It was<br/>
also over $100.00 per week more!! (thank goddess for the state help!)<br/>
<br/>
For a long time after the experience w/ the first day care, Brianna was very<br/>
wary of doing ANYTHING!!! w/o asking! She would get visibly upset over<br/>
&quot;being wrong&quot; in writing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
all in all - it was terrible for Brianna.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;When someone with a one year old says &quot;unschooling&quot; the question is &quot;as<br/>
  &gt;opposed to what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d have to say, as opposed enrolling the kid in my next door neighbor&#39;s<br/>
  licensed-for-12-we-do-activities-at-10am and<br/>
  3pm-and-structure-everything-else-too day care.  She&#39;s practically got a<br/>
  preschool running over there, complete with &#39;everyone sit down and glue<br/>
the<br/>
  pom-poms on the xerox&#39;d picture of a rabbit for easter&#39; and &quot;everyone sing<br/>
  the alphabet song!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Kids start their &#39;schooling&#39; around here WAY before they hit<br/>
  kindergarten.  Back in the days when I was doing day care (10 years ago<br/>
  now), parents had me driving their kids to &#39;enrichment&#39; courses so they<br/>
  wouldn&#39;t be behind when they got to kindergarten.  It was a serious<br/>
concern<br/>
  of theirs, no matter what I thought of it.  (I ran a very non-academic,<br/>
  muddy, messy, yummy child care.  How are they going to learn their ABC&#39;s<br/>
  from that?)<br/>
<br/>
  In my opinion, unschooling can start from year one, if they&#39;ve made the<br/>
  conscious decision to not push their child in a schoolish way during their<br/>
  &#39;preschool career&#39; or to prep for kindergarten.<br/>
  The whole parenting/education competition gets pretty crazy in this neck<br/>
of<br/>
  the woods sometimes.<br/>

  Yes, all I could think of was &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot;.  Quite sad.<br/>
  Some of the things people put these poor children through is just insane!<br/>
  Don&#39;t you just know those poor babies are sitting there wondering how to<br/>
  roll their eyes in the back of their little heads! &gt;BG&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  I saw a similar program called &#39;teach your baby math&#39; or something to that<br/>
  effect.  They have these flash cards almost a foot square with different<br/>
  patterns of red dots and the baby is supposedly supposed to learn how to<br/>
do<br/>
  the four math facts by looking at random dot pictures.  Looks like a head<br/>
  start to blindness to me!  I always wonder if those kids were the ones who<br/>
  started those pictures you have to stare past to actually see the form<br/>
  through all the muck.  Ah well, I&#39;m rambling again...<br/>

For the last year it&#39;s been the Harry Potter series.  Last night I started<br/>
reading them the fourth book for the fourth time.  We have June 21st on our<br/>
calendar!<br/>
<br/>
The only other books they have been interested in me reading to them this<br/>
past year are from the Edward Eager series.  Half Magic, Knight&#39;s Castle,<br/>
The Time Garden etc.<br/>
<br/>
My eldest has been very interested in mythology the last few months so he<br/>
has been reading various books on this subject. He also can&#39;t wait for his<br/>
Nintendo Power magazine to show up each month, and is often be seen with his<br/>
nose in a player&#39;s guide!<br/>
<br/>
For my youngest when we&#39;re reading alone it&#39;s anything Scooby-Doo. :)<br/>
<br/>
I picked up the Chronicles of Narnia book series and though nobody has been<br/>
interested in hearing me read them, they really enjoyed the Lion, the Witch,<br/>
and the Wardrobe video (a BBC production) I found at the library.  They<br/>
liked it so much I picked up the DVDs a few weeks ago that has the BBC<br/>
productions of 4 of the 7 books (3 DVDs).  The older two loved it and sat<br/>
through the last 3 in a row, about 6-7 hours I think it was, including<br/>
popcorn breaks ;)<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 11, 9, and 5.<br/>

&gt; Truthful<br/>
&gt; praise, imho, can do no harm.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is very important.. the &quot;truthful&quot; part.  Of course, you don&#39;t<br/>
want to criticize a childs efforts by saying.. UHHG, that is awful, that is<br/>
so ugly, that is worthless.. BUT, I have also read ( and heard) that if you<br/>
constantly tell a child thier efforts are WONDERFUL, GREAT, THE BEST!, and<br/>
they know in thier hearts its really lousy, then that breaks down thier<br/>
trust<br/>
in you.    A good way to approach this and open up the lines of<br/>
communication<br/>
is to ask the child what they think about the &quot;thing&quot;, or how they feel<br/>
about<br/>
it.  For example, a child paints a picture and brings it to you, all<br/>
excited.. LOOK Mommy, LOOK! at my picture.. isn&#39;t it pretty?  OH, let me<br/>
see,<br/>
yes, I think it is pretty, what do you think?  Do you like it?   Maybe say,<br/>
my favorite part is the &quot;X&quot;, what do you like best about it?    Then you can<br/>
talk about the picture, maybe the kid will say, I love the &quot;X&quot; but, I think<br/>
the &quot;Y&quot; look stupid..   Ask why they think the Y looks stupid, how could<br/>
they<br/>
fix it.. etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
   Another good way to encourage children without &quot;labeling&quot; them is to<br/>
praise them with a variety of adjectives.  Instead of always saying.. &quot;good,<br/>
great, wonderful, smart&quot;, use more direct and descriptive words .. For<br/>
instance, instead of saying. &quot;oh that is a great picture&quot;.. say.. Oh, you<br/>
are<br/>
so creative and expressive with your paints&quot;.    Instead of saying, &quot;you are<br/>
so smart for figuring that out&quot;,  say, &quot;that took some real logic and<br/>
calcuation to solve&quot;  Say a child picks up all of thier toys and tidys a<br/>
room<br/>
up without being asked to help.  Instead of saying,  oh, what a good boy,<br/>
thank you so much.. Say, Thank you,  you are so considerate and helpful.<br/>
You<br/>
are an excellent organizer.<br/>
<br/>
 I have always tried to express to my children what wonderful qualities they<br/>
have without lumping them all under &quot;good or smart&quot; categories.    I think<br/>
it<br/>
strengthens thier sense of self and uniqueness and boosts their self esteem.<br/>

Oh sure. :o) There are lots. Here are some I can think of off the top<br/>
of my head.<br/>
<br/>
A Series of Unfortunate Events series by Lemony Snicket<br/>
Harry Potter series by JK Rowling<br/>
The Witches by Roald Dahl (others by him too)<br/>
Holes by Louis Sachar<br/>
Wayside School series by Louis Sachar<br/>
Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon hatcher by Bruce Coville (others by him too)<br/>
The House With The The Clock in its Walls by ?<br/>
Watership Down by Richard Adams<br/>
The Secret Garden by Francis Hodgsen Burnett (could be wrong on the<br/>
author)<br/>
The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings Trilogy by JKK Tolkien<br/>
The Dark is Rising series<br/>
Skellig<br/>
The Golden Compass, His Dark Materials series by Philip Pullman<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;We never had the learning problems other than high distraction and<br/>
the classroom sounded like a loud echoing place always for her. She<br/>
would come home from school and cry for 1-2 hours just screaming and<br/>
biting and hitting.I was always told I was to soft and needed to be<br/>
firmer etc...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People have all sorts of advice, don&#39;t they. :-P~~~~~ Conor once told<br/>
me that the classroom felt like a war going on, only no one would<br/>
come  help him. &lt;ouch&gt; Glad I rescued him when I did even though I<br/>
wish he had never gone at all. How long was your daughter in school?<br/>
How long has she been out?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; I have never heard of sensory integration.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Look for the book The Out of Sync Child by Carol Kranowitz. It gives<br/>
a great explanation and overview of the whole topic.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; One thing about this personality was it sure made me explore<br/>
parenting,my own issues, marriage and listening to each individual.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I definitely feel blessed by each my kid&#39;s &quot;quirks.&quot; They have<br/>
brought me to a place I may never have found otherwise.<br/>

<br/>
&gt;&gt;Thank you for your kind words. Funny how I couldn&#39;t think of<br/>
focusing on her strong points.Guess i was feeling a bit funky.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It happens. :o) It can happen to them even more. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so<br/>
important for us to remind them and help them and encourage them<br/>
towards what *is* working for them. And every child has those<br/>
qualities that make them shine. Schools only appreciate one or two<br/>
qualities in a &quot;good&quot; student. We have the ability to open up the<br/>
whole world of possibilities for our kids to shine in their own<br/>
unique way.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Molly is still trying to find what she is good at. She has a sister<br/>
(the hypersensitive one)who is mega quick and finds every activity<br/>
easy and is noticed by others right away for her immediate skill.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds a lot like my two kids.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Hard on Molly.Her sister does not rub this in at all but molly<br/>
notices it none the less. We have been focusing on accepting herself<br/>
for where she is at.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And where she is, is exactly where she needs to be right now. She has<br/>
amazing gifts and her gifts will be unlike her sister&#39;s or anyone<br/>
else&#39;s. It&#39;s not just a matter of accepting herself as less than<br/>
someone else (not saying that&#39;s what you&#39;re encouraging BTW), but<br/>
understanding that there are other qualities that are *her*<br/>
strengths. Qualities she can bring to the world unlike any other&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Molly has been home now for 5 years and really unschooled for 2-3<br/>
years. I&#39;m not sure if she has stuff still to get over. I guess being<br/>
put in special reading and needing extra help always.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that can definitely give a kid the feeling of being &quot;less<br/>
than.&quot; The more places she has to shine, the more successes she has<br/>
NOW, the less that old school stuff will matter.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;I like the idea of finding areas for her to use her body<br/>
individually. She so far loves rythmic gymnastics as there is no<br/>
focus on others ability. She has only been involved for about 1<br/>
month.She laughed with one girl over a move they made and was very<br/>
excited. This alone was social contact enough for her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;One girl is seeking her out .Molly is hesitant but we are working<br/>
on trying one visit and seeing how it goes. I am helping her with<br/>
wording to make the call.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I still make the phone calls for both of my kids when they ask or<br/>
need me to. Sometimes that&#39;s needed to get the ball rolling.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

   How long was your daughter in school?<br/>
  How long has she been out?<br/>
  She was in kindergarten,then I curriculum homeschooled her for grade 1.<br/>
Lots of damage done there for her and I.Then in grade 2-41/2 in montessori.<br/>
She has been out for 5 years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Look for the book The Out of Sync Child by Carol Kranowitz. It gives<br/>
  a great explanation and overview of the whole topic.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks, I will.<br/>

<br/>
  Isn&#39;t that the truth. Can&#39;t imagine life without this journey. I was very<br/>
compliant and mainstream until I had kids.<br/>
  I actually consider myself lucky that they found me to guide me in my<br/>
journey or maybe we found each other.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Thank you for your kind words. Funny how I couldn&#39;t think of<br/>
  focusing on her strong points.Guess i was feeling a bit funky.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  It happens. :o) It can happen to them even more. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so<br/>
  important for us to remind them and help them and encourage them<br/>
  towards what *is* working for them. And every child has those<br/>
  qualities that make them shine. Schools only appreciate one or two<br/>
  qualities in a &quot;good&quot; student. We have the ability to open up the<br/>
  whole world of possibilities for our kids to shine in their own<br/>
  unique way.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Molly is still trying to find what she is good at. She has a sister<br/>
  (the hypersensitive one)who is mega quick and finds every activity<br/>
  easy and is noticed by others right away for her immediate skill.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Sounds a lot like my two kids.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Hard on Molly.Her sister does not rub this in at all but molly<br/>
  notices it none the less. We have been focusing on accepting herself<br/>
  for where she is at.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  And where she is, is exactly where she needs to be right now. She has<br/>
  amazing gifts and her gifts will be unlike her sister&#39;s or anyone<br/>
  else&#39;s. It&#39;s not just a matter of accepting herself as less than<br/>
  someone else (not saying that&#39;s what you&#39;re encouraging BTW), but<br/>
  understanding that there are other qualities that are *her*<br/>
  strengths. Qualities she can bring to the world unlike any other&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Molly has been home now for 5 years and really unschooled for 2-3<br/>
  years. I&#39;m not sure if she has stuff still to get over. I guess being<br/>
  put in special reading and needing extra help always.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I think that can definitely give a kid the feeling of being &quot;less<br/>
  than.&quot; The more places she has to shine, the more successes she has<br/>
  NOW, the less that old school stuff will matter.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;I like the idea of finding areas for her to use her body<br/>
  individually. She so far loves rythmic gymnastics as there is no<br/>
  focus on others ability. She has only been involved for about 1<br/>
  month.She laughed with one girl over a move they made and was very<br/>
  excited. This alone was social contact enough for her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Great!<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;One girl is seeking her out .Molly is hesitant but we are working<br/>
  on trying one visit and seeing how it goes. I am helping her with<br/>
  wording to make the call.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I still make the phone calls for both of my kids when they ask or<br/>
  need me to. Sometimes that&#39;s needed to get the ball rolling.<br/>
<br/>
  Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
  Life is good.<br/>

I just re-read a long post I sent regarding Brianna & day care. What was<br/>

It was a discipline mindset kind of thing.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with Life Learning Magazine?  In the last<br/>
few months they have run a series of articles on praising your child.   I<br/>
think they&#39;ve been very interesting and helpful.   They are on the same tone<br/>
as Punished by Rewards,  that someone else suggested.   This author is Naomi<br/>
Aldort.  It says also that your can read her articles at<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Hi everyone,<br/>
  My daughter Kiele thrives on praise and I have heard two different views<br/>
about praise and how it affects children.  The first view being that it&#39;s<br/>
good for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work that they have<br/>
accomplished or with what ever they have done.  The second view is that a<br/>
child who is always praised will only do things to please adults rather than<br/>
to please herself, to hear others talk good about her.  Kiele looks for<br/>
praise constantly although I do see the pride that she takes in her work<br/>
whether it&#39;s building with blocks or coloring a picture, however she looks<br/>
for my approval to see if I like what she has done.  I know that this is<br/>
normal for a 4 year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all<br/>
the time for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some<br/>
pointers on this I would appreciate it...<br/>
  Thanks<br/>

I got sent a sample copy and found it too &quot;schooly&quot; for me-( I really wanted<br/>

Is that not the case?  maybe it was a &quot;bad&quot; issue I read?<br/>

I have found it quite unschoolish.    They refer to unschooling quite a bit<br/>
and self-directed learning.   I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed reading the articles.<br/>
<br/>
**I got sent a sample copy**<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t know,  was this a while ago?     I&#39;ve had my subscription for about<br/>
 a year now.       They have had quite a few articles written by unschooled<br/>
young adults; which I have really enjoyed reading.   Last issue also had an<br/>
article by David Albert in it.<br/>

I did some reading at naturalchild.org. I especially liked the Maxims about childhood behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Some Maxims About Childhood Behavior<br/>
<br/>
  a.. Children aren&#39;t adults, so don&#39;t expect them to behave as though they were. <br/>
  b.. Children learn by doing, so don&#39;t expect to approve of everything they do. <br/>
  c.. It is a rare child whose behavior equals his parents&#39; expectations. <br/>
  d.. Children are more likely to do as you do than to do as you say. <br/>
  e.. It is often less important for parents to control their children&#39;s behavior than it is for them to control their own. <br/>
  f.. Children react to anger; they respond to love and affection. <br/>
I printed them out and they serve to remind me ;-)<br/>
