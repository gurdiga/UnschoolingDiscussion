<div id="ygrps-yiv-326922663">Hello Susan;<br/>
First, I want you to know that I understand and identify with your<br/>
anxieties and fears. I see you as a loving, caring parent who wants<br/>
the best for her children. We all want our children to experience<br/>
success, to be accepted by everyone they meet, to be seen as valuable<br/>
not only in their own families, but in the eyes of the rest of the<br/>
world as well. I am a home schooling mother who is taking the first<br/>
tentative steps into unschooling, mostly because I have been<br/>
struggling with the same thing you have: encountering resistence from<br/>
my 8-year-old son. In his case, it is the pencil-and-paper learning he<br/>
objects to, not reading, but in many respects I can identify with what<br/>
you are expressing. He is a strong-willed child, and I am a<br/>
strong-willed mom! Which both helps us to understand each other, and<br/>
gets us butting heads with each other. I have been attracted to<br/>
unschooling, but have been reluctant to take the leap for the same<br/>
reasons that you express: fear of my children not developing important<br/>
skills, falling behind, etc. But in the end, I have decided that the<br/>
absolute most important thing is my relationship with my son. I would<br/>
like to hear more about your son&#39;s interests. What really lights his<br/>
fire? What are some of his great strengths? Where does he shine? I can<br/>
tell you that, as a former (and recovering!) classroom teacher, I<br/>
could always tell the children that would do well in life, even if<br/>
they didn&#39;t do well in &quot;academics,&quot; because they had their own<br/>
interests, parents that cared about them, and a sense of themselves<br/>
that went beyond simply wanting to please me as a teacher. I hope you<br/>
have not been put off by some of the strong responses you have<br/>
received. Sometimes in the zeal to promote strong beliefs, it is easy<br/>
to forget the person behind the questions, to forget to show<br/>
respectful tolerance for other views and choices. I applaud your<br/>
courage in opening up to this circle, and I applaud your desire to<br/>
find better solutions for you and your son. I have found it eases my<br/>
mind greatly to read the many success stories I find on the web, about<br/>
children who were &quot;late bloomers&quot; as readers, writers, etc. And there<br/>
are so many greats contributors to the world whose learning was very<br/>
unorthodox and perplexing to &quot;traditional&quot; ways of learning. So, dig<br/>
up and print up some of these stories to ease your mind when you&#39;re<br/>
anxious. You know, the bible is full of stories of late bloomers too!<br/>
And, if any one starts making comments about your son&#39;s reading, break<br/>
in with some great stories about some of his fabulous talents,<br/>
interests, etc. Take heart! Your son&#39;s different path through the<br/>
world of reading may just be the opportunity for you to learn to let<br/>
go in some ways, as I am learning to do, and it&#39;s actually quite<br/>
liberating. In the meantime, enjoy reading together, so many great<br/>
books out there to choose from! Good luck, I will be thinking of you!<br/>
