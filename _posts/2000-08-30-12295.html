<div id="ygrps-yiv-54969254">Dear Susan<br/>
<br/>
This may not be encouraging, but all four of my sweet little daughters have<br/>
done the same kinds of things as you describe. I think it&#39;s &quot;kid normal&quot; not<br/>
just &quot;boy normal&quot;. We know this parenting thing is a tough gig. Hang in<br/>
there.<br/>

Thank you.  I just hadn&#39;t experienced anything like this with dd (7).  He&#39;s<br/>
really wearing me out.  But at least I now know there&#39;s an end... somewhere.<br/>
How long were your girls in this stage?  I&#39;d like to keep the sweet boy<br/>
around more.  Thanks again.</div>

Thank you for your note.  See the list is very helpful to everyone.  After<br/>
writing my long note & taking a trip to run errands I really felt better.<br/>
So no one has to visit him in the hospital.  I guess it&#39;s basically that<br/>
he&#39;s so different from what I went through with dd & that&#39;s ok.  I&#39;m keeping<br/>
the letters I get to read when I need to be reminded.  The stories have been<br/>
great & I&#39;ll share with dh so he&#39;ll see we&#39;re not the first to have a<br/>
non-stop explorer in the family.  Thank you all for your notes.</div>

You&#39;re welcome Susan....but I wonder why you are speaking in past tense when<br/>
you say &quot;How long were your girls in this stage?&quot;  We&#39;re in it right now.<br/>
&quot;We&quot; because we all experience what one of them does. The worst offences<br/>
seem to occur at ages 1-1/2 to 5. Very &quot;creative&quot; art, especially body<br/>
art...involving permanent markers, peanut butter, (ahem) K-Y jelly....the<br/>
list is endless. Want to hear about the Parmesan cheese incident? Want to<br/>
know how much I owe the library right now for what happened to that book?<br/>
Perhaps not.<br/>
<br/>
Someone had a great idea...keep a journal open on a table somewhere and jot<br/>
down anything new or amusing the kids do. Just a running commentary. What<br/>
your little boy did in one day could stand as some sort of record of Bad Day<br/>
for Mom. Or you could have one for each child and give it to them as a<br/>
wedding gift---ha. See if you ever become a grandmother that way.<br/>
<br/>
Your sweet little boy is in there.....Valerie</div>

I&#39;ll try the journal idea.  Looking back there have been other days.  Once<br/>
he got a new bottle of baby powder & did a free for all in the living room.<br/>
I walked in & thought the house was on fire.  DS was only 2.5 then.  About 3<br/>
months ago he did it again but in my bedroom.  I&#39;m still cleaning up this<br/>
mess.  I guess it was, in my ds&#39;s words, &quot;I&#39;m having a really bad day&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think a journal for each would be in order.  What a great gift but instead<br/>
of for their wedding I think on the birth of their first child!!!</div>

are trying to figure out why in the world they decided to embark on this <br/>
grand experience!<br/>

getting a little wistful today.  Zack&#39;s birthday is tomorrow.  He&#39;ll be 8 <br/>
years old!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082848528">Zak came to me this morning with completely red legs and hands.  He <br/>
told me he wanted to be red today so he&#39;d taken a red market <br/>
(permanent ink by the way) and covered his legs and hands.  He said <br/>
he wouldn&#39;t need to wear pants because the red covered his legs... <br/>
Guess that made sense to him (LOL)... He went out with Steve with <br/>
shorts on, and very very very red legs underneath... Wonder what the <br/>
people in the Skating Rink or Target are going to think of that.<br/>
