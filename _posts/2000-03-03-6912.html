Sca stands for The Society for Creative Anachronism. &quot; The Society for<br/>
Creative Anachronism (SCA) is an international organization dedicated<br/>
to researching and re-creating pre-17th-century European history. All<br/>
persons interested in such study are invited to use these pages to<br/>
obtain information about the SCA. &quot;  (From their web site.)<br/>
<br/>
A great way to learn European history of the time, actually.  You<br/>
should browse their web site for more info.<br/>

Hey, we are SCA newbies and loving it!!!  I&#39;ve actually got a couple <br/>
of outfits now, some great looking feast gear and all of my kids are <br/>
pretty well garbed for the youth combat program.<br/>
SCA has something for everyone. I think it&#39;s a really wonderful <br/>
resource for homeschoolers. Where else can you actually live history? <br/>
And there are so many opportunities to learn uselful <br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
It assumes those who participate want to know more about what they&#39;re seeing, <br/>
what real tournaments would have been like, whether their garb could be more <br/>
period, whether what they brought for lunch could be more period, what someone <br/>
of their chosen place and time would have known about science or geography.<br/>
<br/>
The SCA doesn&#39;t require teaching.   It thrives on learning.   The real <br/>
reasons and the framework for learning are provided.   People shouldn&#39;t have to wait <br/>
to be taught.<br/>
<br/>
If children are in and about the grownups they came with, they&#39;re learning <br/>
from the conversations they&#39;re hearing, the people they&#39;re meeting, the work <br/>
they&#39;re doing.  If children are isolated in kid-land, they will learn that <br/>
children should be isolated, that they&#39;re not really part of the event.   <br/>
<br/>
Just because it&#39;s common doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My husband just became <br/>
authorized to be a boffer marshal. That&#39;s what we do. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Another evil thing in my world.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have played boffers since they were little, and we (old-timer <br/>
parents) have resisted &#39;boffer marshals&#39; and boffer rules effectively until now.  <br/>
Still there&#39;s a push to have them; still we push back.   The liability to the <br/>
group is greater with rules than without.  The fun for children is greater <br/>
without rules than with.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have often provided the boffers and the ideas for hours of safe and <br/>
happy  boffer play (as recently as May, Kirby who was 17, organized a castle <br/>
seige with the members of the Order of the Stag&#39;s Blood defending against 40 <br/>
kids with boffers).  They  counsel other kids to be gentle with younger kids, no <br/>
headshots, avoid the hands, all that--but armor isn&#39;t required, because <br/>
they&#39;re not hitting too hard.  Kids who are hitting too hard are told, by the other <br/>
kids, to play softer or not play.   <br/>
<br/>
That freedom will fall, as so many other rights and freedoms fall if people <br/>
let them, but my children grew up their whole lives being members of the SCA, <br/>
active, present, playing freely.   If I defended those freedoms for 18 years <br/>
for Kirby&#39;s sake, that was 18 years of freedom for other kids too.   So it&#39;s not <br/>
that I don&#39;t understand the theory.  It&#39;s just that the ministry of children <br/>
and boffer marshals are things we&#39;ve resisted.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you joined after it was too late where you are.   That will happen to <br/>
people here too, someday.<br/>

staying you could have enriched their lives at all? This is the sort of <br/>
thing I struggle with. Plus, this isn&#39;t school, and I don&#39;t have the <br/>
*same* rules.  I could, in theory, run my job by eliminating it (by not <br/>
providing distinct activities, and instead having all game planners and <br/>
such allow children to participate). But I can&#39;t make their parents <br/>
want to be with them, and that&#39;s where the ultimate problem lies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=- If I didn&#39;t bring things for the children, I&#39;d be bringing things <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the original question is still partly unanswered. Is there a way <br/>
to get the schooled kids to loosen up and enjoy things more? Maybe <br/>
that&#39;s too noble and unrealistic a goal. Is it a lost cause? Is there a <br/>
way to integrate schooled kids with an unschooling philosophy? Maybe <br/>
still too large. Maybe help me figure out the question? LOL I think I <br/>
am trying to figure out the cost-benefit ratio (to my family, to me, to <br/>
other children) of providing activities, and not having any luck (I <br/>
know I have to figure it out FOR ME but other&#39;s ideas do help clarify <br/>
it). I keep going back to &quot;I can still do it better than xxx can&quot; and <br/>
&quot;But no matter what I do, these kids still have to go to school and <br/>
it&#39;s not enough&quot; and &quot;Dratted Corpora rules and lawsuit-happy country&quot;, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Is it wrong to be selfish on this? My daughter says she has fun helping <br/>
with activities, she likes the children, and wants to continue doing <br/>
it. My sons like doing boffers. Is it wrong to &quot;aid and abet&quot; the <br/>
schooling mentality, if my kids get to do what they want to?<br/>
<br/>
Already, some of your ideas have provided some clarity (different ways <br/>
to think about the issues), so thank you for that.<br/>

I&#39;ve seen kids&#39; questions rebuffed, because they are children.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t comment on wars, I don&#39;t go to them (medical reasons). Most of <br/>
our events are single-day tournaments, and this is what I have <br/>
witnessed. Many in our area have no chosen persona, or don&#39;t function <br/>
within it. Garb is showy but in many cases, inaccurate. Kids aren&#39;t <br/>
always garbed in any case. Tournaments are 99.9% of the time fought <br/>
&quot;standard double elimination&quot;, there is not much to learn there (plus <br/>
it has no historical precedent, from what I have gathered). Lunch is <br/>
frequently Burger King (not MY lunch, but the stuff you frequently see <br/>
people eating at an event - except in my own Barony where my Baroness <br/>
is an EXCELLENT cook and frequently offers a lunch - but that&#39;s not the <br/>
norm at all events). There&#39;s not much for anyone to learn FROM. It&#39;s <br/>
largely a dress-up party in the park. Maybe it&#39;s one of those <br/>
downswings, but how would we know? I agree in theory, this should be a <br/>
GREAT place for this, to soak up atmosphere if nothing else, but the <br/>
reality is, at the events I have attended, it just doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If children are in and about the grownups they came with, they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; learning from the conversations they&#39;re hearing, the people they&#39;re <br/>

&gt; they&#39;re doing.  If children are isolated in kid-land, they will learn <br/>
&gt; that children should be isolated, that they&#39;re not really part of the <br/>
&gt; event.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They aren&#39;t a part of things anyway tho, and I agree it&#39;s not <br/>
appropriate. The conversations are not (from what I have heard) <br/>
anything medievally related, they&#39;re about work and traffic and partly <br/>
about SCA matters (which officers didn&#39;t come to xxx meeting, that sort <br/>
of thing), but not &quot;persona&quot; matters (I know those conversations would <br/>
have some value also, but they aren&#39;t exclusive to the SCA). At least <br/>
in &quot;kid-land&quot; (LOL) they ARE learning and exploring and playing, if <br/>
they choose to. They don&#39;t have to come to where I am, they WANT to (or <br/>
are possibly coerced by their parents, or provided no other options). <br/>
I&#39;ve had kids (7-10 yr old age range, and older) who don&#39;t even know <br/>
their own mom and dad&#39;s SCA names, or what Barony they are from, or in <br/>
some cases, their OWN SCA name, if they even have one, what time period <br/>
their garb is from, or any other number of things you&#39;d think they <br/>
might have picked up from their adults, if the adults were discussing <br/>
them. And FYI in our area (I know this varies), we&#39;re not really <br/>
*isolated* as such, we&#39;re in one of the many sunshades parked around <br/>
the eric, we&#39;re not off in some corner or a separate room or something <br/>
(I know we&#39;re still apart, but we might be right next to the Baronial <br/>
pavilion for instance, we&#39;re not in some way-off spot). And I don&#39;t run <br/>
a timed program, so kids do come and go and presumably spend at least <br/>
some time with their adults, tho I don&#39;t keep track of where they are <br/>
when they are not with me.<br/>
<br/>
There are of course exceptions and some wonderful people and some <br/>
events with things to do and learn, actively and passively. But it <br/>
seems the exception rather than the rule.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just because it&#39;s common doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know. :) But when it&#39;s the &quot;norm&quot; and the Powers That Be say it&#39;s <br/>
Right, it&#39;s hard for us lowly peons to fight the system. I haven&#39;t been <br/>
as active as you&#39;ve been, or in as long, and I don&#39;t have the titles to <br/>
give me any sort of backing. And I am sure you know it&#39;s MUCH harder to <br/>
get a rule eliminated once it&#39;s made, rather than fight its creation. <br/>
The rules are already made, here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-My husband just became authorized to be a boffer marshal.  -=-<br/>
&gt; The liability to the group is greater with rules than without.  The <br/>
&gt; fun for children is greater without rules than with.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, but if we choose to play, we have no choice but to follow the <br/>
rules, as the law has been made here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s just that the ministry of children and boffer marshals are things <br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve resisted.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you joined after it was too late where you are.   That will <br/>
&gt; happen to people here too, someday.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s probably true, about joining too late. We can&#39;t have ANYTHING  <br/>
boffer-related (or boffer-like) without an authorized boffer marshal <br/>
present and witnessing, and all sorts of other rules. Not even a <br/>
practice. That&#39;s one reason my husband authorized, because our boys <br/>
love boffers and we didn&#39;t have a marshal in our area. We don&#39;t like <br/>
the rules, but the boys want to play badly enough that we deal with <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your ideas. It&#39;s helping for me to clarify the problems.<br/>

<br/>
We did.<br/>
I think it&#39;s one reason my kids got tired of the SCA fairly quick. <br/>
Not that we were ever super involved...we showed up for occasional <br/>
fighter practices and the big yearly event here.<br/>
But all the rules and formality really turned Trevor off to the <br/>
whole thing. The archery was pretty good, the guy in charge of that <br/>
showed them period stuff and kept it safe, but they came and went <br/>
from it as they wished.<br/>
The boffer fighting was WAY too serious and high pressure. They were <br/>
preparing young ones to be great fighters. Noble perhaps, but it <br/>
didn&#39;t allow for the learning to happen...there was too much <br/>
teaching going on.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what you &quot;owe&quot; the world&#39;s children...I think my <br/>
responsibility is to my own family first. If an activity is <br/>
contributing to our peace and happiness, while benefiting other <br/>
children..great. If not (as in the case of Sandra&#39;s teaching job) my <br/>
priority is MY children. I can change the world better by living my <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446511187">Hi all! This is my first post to this list but I have been lurking for a <br/>
couple of months. I have been very impressed with the way the list is handled. I <br/>
like seeing people be able to debate but end the silly jibes when it gets to <br/>
that level. I am addressing this topic because I do have some insight into the <br/>
world of &quot;medievel period living&quot;. Before I ever joined SCA, and then quickly <br/>
&quot;unjoined&quot;, I worked for 2 years at the Ren Faire in Colorado. I was the dead <br/>
fish trainer. If you want to know more about that let me know but I want to get <br/>
to my view.<br/>
<br/>
As you all know, a title does not an organization make. Although SCA is <br/>
supposed to be against all things &quot;mundane&quot; (boffer not being a word used when I <br/>
was there 12 years ago), if the people in the group choose to allow Gameboys and <br/>
plastic toys, they pretty blew the whole point. <br/>
<br/>
In my own experience, if you would like the children to really be exposed to <br/>
the land of Knights and Kings, see where your closest Ren Faire is held. Get <br/>
ahold of the director and ask if you could be a part of it. Although most <br/>
faires require auditions, if you are willing to work for free or even hire one or <br/>
two of the regular participants, you will most likely get the &quot;in&quot; you need to <br/>
truly explore the world of jousting and courting and all the rest. Even if <br/>
your nearest faire site has been opened and closed its gates already, it is <br/>
highly likely that several of the people who work the faire are local. Although <br/>
most of the merchants and large acts travel from state to state, some of them <br/>
only work the one faire with regular &quot;mundane&quot; jobs keeping them home. I <br/>
guarantee that once you have met a few of them and proven your interest, you will be <br/>
introduced to all the learning you can handle. Many of the faires require that <br/>
the goods sold onsite are made with only the materials and level of technology <br/>
available during that period in history. California is especially known for <br/>
the authenticity of it&#39;s players, dress and goods. <br/>
<br/>
On the whole, I believe that you will find that Ren people are generous, <br/>
open, and eager to teach anyone who wants to learn. And they are also a group that <br/>
I would consider an assortment of unschooling families. Rather like modern <br/>
day gypsies, the ones that travel all year take their children with them and <br/>
teach them on the road. These children always caught my attention as being smart, <br/>
swift and mature (although often dirty and underfoot, LOL). <br/>
<br/>
Okay anyway, this is my two pence worth as far as your best source of <br/>
learning Renaissance period crafts and well, all the fun stuff from that time. They <br/>
don&#39;t dwell too much on the not so great stuff, but it can help give some <br/>
perspective when you have to hit the library.<br/>
<br/>
SCA is very fighting oriented, which is indeed, the pivotal part of that <br/>
time, but I feel that if you are interested in more one on one experiences as well <br/>
as a more rounded experience as a whole, the Ren Faires are your best source.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this is just my opinion, LOL! <br/>
<br/>
As a side note, we just got back from a trip visiting the inlaws in Las Vegas <br/>
and stayed at the Excaliber and saw the &quot;Tournament of Kings&quot; with wonderful <br/>
performances by all. If you ever get a chance to get out there - and avoid <br/>
those casino floors, yuck - that is wonderful place to take the children and also <br/>
learn much about that time in history. <br/>
<br/>
All right, pretty long entry for my first one. Thanks so much for all of the <br/>
wonderful things I have learned from all of you!<br/>

them better, that&#39;s more what I am striving for. It helps me, it helps <br/>

<br/>
Well, Robyn caught the funny before I did, darnit!! I was going to <br/>
say Yeah, I think that fits me. LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say though, we&#39;ve really enjoyed our Renaissance Faire <br/>
here in Pensacola. It&#39;s newer and not-so-big, but we&#39;ve had a GREAT <br/>
time the last two years. They have things the SCA could never <br/>
afford, like falconry and equestrian events (we live in a rather <br/>
poorish shire). We feel so immersed at the event, with all the <br/>
booths, entertainers and demonstrations...so much more authentic <br/>
than our SCA experience.<br/>
I think the glory days of the SCA may be gone. I could be wrong, but <br/>
I think it&#39;s just not the same anymore....and in the poorer areas, <br/>
they cut too many corners that make it lose authenticity.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about the Ren Faire, is we get to see our SCA <br/>
aquaintances doing fight demonstrations. It&#39;s a lot of fun.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have never worked Ren Faire so I can&#39;t comment from experience from <br/>
that angle.<br/>
<br/>
We did *go* to (So CA Renaissance Pleasure) Faire one year recently and <br/>
we won&#39;t go back. It was horrible. It was like Renaissance Disneyland, <br/>
maybe 10% was anything authentic and the rest was a waste of time (and <br/>
tho some merchandise were well-crafted, period type items, the bulk was <br/>
Faire t-shirts and cheap felt flags and fairy wings and the like). <br/>
Around every corner was someone trying to sell us some kind of <br/>
overpriced junk, or modern food (pizza, french fries, etc.). I&#39;d been a <br/>
few times many years ago, and it was about the same.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun for some people (and if someone wants to go just for fun, <br/>
great!), but I did not see the level of authenticity you say is there. <br/>
My kids did enjoy commenting on how unauthentic everything was (but <br/>
they asked not go ever go back, they enjoyed nothing else about it).<br/>
<br/>
We intended to go to some of the smaller local Faires, but didn&#39;t get a <br/>
chance to this year. Some of those are supposed to be good.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of the pageantry and atmosphere is gone, at least where I am. <br/>
We&#39;re not exactly a poor area either.<br/>
<br/>
The problem I have seen with authenticity is not so much that it&#39;s <br/>
GONE, as that&#39;s it&#39;s not easily accessible. We have very active guilds <br/>
in many crafts, and things of that nature.   There are many people who <br/>
are VERY concerned with authenticity and research. It&#39;s just not very <br/>
available to the children. It&#39;s done behind the scenes, as it were, <br/>
rather than being out in the open at events. And not everyone is there <br/>
because of the historical aspect, it&#39;s like there is no longer a common <br/>
vision. People have &quot;fairy&quot; names and sponsor fantasy-themed events. I <br/>
know everyone gets different things from it, people have different <br/>
things they want to focus on, but it seems, frequently, that people <br/>
take a modern interest and try to stuff it into the SCA framework <br/>
somehow (or don&#39;t even BOTHER, and just do the modern thing, put a <br/>
dragon on it, and call it authentic), instead of discovering what is <br/>
fascinating about a specific time-frame, or craft that existed then. <br/>
It&#39;s backwards in a lot of ways.<br/>
<br/>
Our current Kingdom level children&#39;s officer took the position because <br/>
it had been vacant -- she is mundanely a schoolteacher. She is a nice <br/>
person, but clearly school-y. Our current boffer program was started by <br/>
a fighter who wanted his sons to be able to do combat (rather than by <br/>
someone who just wanted them to be able to play safely). This probably <br/>
explains a lot. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Not that this really furthers the discussion much, but these were <br/>
thoughts I had as I&#39;ve been reading all of the messages. :)<br/>

<br/>
Had the pro-Renfaire recommendation been 25 years ago, I would have defended <br/>
the SCA and told some tales of lame Renfaires.   But...<br/>
<br/>
Over that quarter decade, Rennaisance Fairs have improved extremely, while <br/>
the SCA has become rulebound and complacent.   <br/>
<br/>
I knew the SCA in its glory days.  I was seneschal of Atenveldt when there <br/>
were only five kingdoms, soon after Meridies split from Atenveldt.  When the SCA <br/>
was only ten years old and people were really doing their own research <br/>
joyfully and not expecting others to teach them it was vibrant.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no getting around the fact that it&#39;s different from town to town, and <br/>
that regions are different and kingdoms are different, but I&#39;ve learned the <br/>
sad lesson that the longer a political entity exists (club, church, town, <br/>
state), the more laws they have.  Laws are created, but rarely taken back.    And <br/>
one place I see that is in newer western states&#39; laws compared to some of the <br/>
NE original 13 states&#39; laws.   Pennslvania, New York and such places have TONS <br/>
and tons of laws.  Picky little rights-limiting laws.   They had a 100 year <br/>
head start on lots of other states.<br/>
<br/>
The SCA lost its lustre for me within the past few years, but I feel I gave <br/>
more than my share and don&#39;t feel guilty about quitting while I was ahead.<br/>
<br/>
I care more about learning than I do about the Middle Ages.   I loved the SCA <br/>
because I loved medieval social history and I loved being around people who <br/>
were learning for fun.<br/>
<br/>
I still have those interests!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are also in the Barony of Gyldenholt and have just recently <br/>
attended our first newcomers meeting. The next meeting is this <br/>
Friday. We did have a discussion about the two types of SCA people, <br/>
the authenticity mavens and the &quot;hey,let&#39;s party&quot; crowd. They did <br/>
emphasize that it kind of misses the point to attend without getting <br/>
into the authentic aspect of it. Everyone does it for fun of course <br/>
but you must respect the original intent of the group.<br/>
<br/>
 We went to a couple of tournaments this last spring and met the <br/>
Baroness of Calafia at one of them. She told us we should attend a <br/>
war before we decided if we really wanted to get into the SCA. We <br/>
attended the Potrero War over Memorial Day weekend and had a great <br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
I think that during the longer events like a war there are more <br/>
opportunities for learning and participating, for kids and adults. <br/>
We learned so much just from the merchants alone. There was a guy <br/>
that was selling woven belts and looms and primitive weaving <br/>
instruments and he was also giving classes on ropemaking at specific <br/>
times. When we approached him and expressed an interest in what he <br/>
did, he was happy to talk about his craft and he showed the kids and <br/>
I some simple weaving/ropemaking techniques right then. We had <br/>
similar experiences with the natural fabric dye people, the middle-<br/>
eastern drum guy, the belly dancer ladies, the guy that was making <br/>
arrows by hand, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My kids also had a great time boffer fighting with lots of other <br/>
kids, free roaming, no rules and they were fine. Occasinally one of <br/>
the adult fighters would be around to show some technique or even <br/>
join them, but mostly the kids did a great job of governing <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
One night I went back to our campsite for a while and the kids were <br/>
off with some of their new-found friends. I caught up with them a <br/>
couple of hours later and they had been to a dance and learned 3 <br/>
folk dances.<br/>
<br/>
During the day we watched some of the fighting and it was much more <br/>
exciting than a tournament. My son was very interested in the <br/>
trebuchet and since then we have been researching and planning to <br/>
build one. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter and I plan on joining the costumers guild. I understand <br/>
that they have a place to meet once a week and large tables for <br/>
cutting fabric and good sewing machines that we can use. We have <br/>
been doing some research on the internet and at the library on <br/>
period costumes. <br/>
<br/>
My son is interested in making his own armor. I am hoping that he <br/>
can join the armorers guild.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a great authentic SCA experience for you and your family <br/>
I think you can make it happen. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do.<br/>
<br/>
 If you want a great SCA experience for all the INTERESTED kids in <br/>
your (our) Barony, I have an idea.  What about inviting different <br/>
guilds to do demonstrations of their crafts at events? Preview what <br/>
they are going to do and come up with different things that the kids <br/>
can do depending on their age. Encourage the guilds to point out <br/>
that they are open to all SCA members and would be happy to instruct <br/>
new people that are truly interested in their work. It doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to be kid only, just kid friendly. Faciltate the kids hooking up <br/>
with the adults that share their interests.<br/>
<br/>
I think the crafts are more compelling if they are grown-up, <br/>
authentic things. Making a banner is more interesting if you have a <br/>
real herald there showing you what some of the symbols mean, <br/>
accurate color combinations and layouts and such.<br/>
<br/>
It has been my experience that if you get someone that is passionate <br/>
about what they are doing, they are happy to talk about it and show <br/>
others how to get started. Their enthusiasm makes them interesting <br/>
to learn from. I think there are many like that in the SCA.<br/>
 <br/>
How about planning a simple authentic dish (food) that the kids can <br/>
make? Gently show the kids that being authentic is what it&#39;s all <br/>
about. Maybe the kids can influence some of the not-so-authentic <br/>
parents to be more-so.<br/>
<br/>
I am new, so this is just my idea of how it COULD be. How I hope it <br/>
will be. So far we have had a great time but I can see how people <br/>
could be lazy and attend with a different attutude. We won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents. OK more like 20:)<br/>
