&lt;&lt; Japanese isn&#39;t a hard language to learn, and I LOVE to tell Japanese people<br/>
that I think English is harder, speaking as someone who has taught English<br/>

Hi :) ( brace yourself, taking highly of PS for a sec) In the 9th grade I <br/>
went to a huge public high school. we are very lucky to live in a very <br/>
&quot;culturally diverse&quot; town. each of our public elementary schools has a <br/>
different language for students who&#39;s first language is not English and if <br/>
you come to our town  (speaking that lanaguge)you can go to whichever school <br/>
that is regardless of which district you are in. (I believe, though not <br/>
entirely positive, that they are Japanese, Chinese, Korean and French) ( mine <br/>
was Korean) and in addition to that (and for that reason) our  (high) school <br/>
offers more Language&#39;s then others, because students are offered the chance <br/>
to study these language&#39;s at an earlier age.unfourtatly, while my school was <br/>
great for the Korean kids. they didn&#39;t ooffer anything other then French or <br/>
Spanish to us. when I got to the high school, I learned that I had the <br/>
opportunity to take Japanese (as one of the first classes). I Immediately <br/>
jumped at the chance. My dad (who&#39;s American) lived in Okinawa Japan on the <br/>
army base when he was little. And my mom traveled to Japan and studied the <br/>
tea ceremony. ( they actually met though a mutual love of Japanese culture). <br/>
While neither of my parents Actually speak Japanese (in about 4 weeks I <br/>
surpassed my dad&#39;s knowledge lol) they were very glad I would get the <br/>
opportunity to study it. I was very nervous at first, because I had heard <br/>
that Japanese was quite hard. I actually found Japanese not to be any harder <br/>
then French after my initial struggle to learn the alphabet (s) ( hiraganga <br/>
and katakana) and my teacher was absolutely fabulous. ( actually, she was not <br/>
Japanese and Japanese was her second language but she was highly proficient)</div>
