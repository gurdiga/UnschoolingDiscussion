<div id="ygrps-yiv-305976390">I&#39;ve set up a lyrics game.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you have played Encore before (some of you have played it  <br/>
with me!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m making an attempt to play a version of it online, just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lyricsgame.blogspot.com/">http://lyricsgame.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
If you want to come and play, the current word is &quot;farm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If that sounds fun and if you can think (THINK, not google) of eight  <br/>
words of a song that contain &quot;farm&quot; (or farming or farmer), go and  <br/>
put it in as a comment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571956503">Speaking of lyrics... <br/>
<br/>
Tonight while I was in the grocery store and my dh Ross and dd Michelle were driving around until I came out, they had an exchange of rock music info. The Who&#39;s &quot;Baba O&#39;Reilly&quot; came on the radio and Ross said &quot;this is one of my all-time favorite song-beginnings.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Michelle asked what the instrument was (Moog synthesizer, maybe?) and then Ross says &quot;Guess who sings this?&quot; Michelle answered &quot;Who?&quot; and Ross said &quot;Yes!&quot; which led to the back and forth &quot;Who?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; for a bit. Then, dd *got* it. They proceeded to talk about other names and dd figured out a comedy routine of rock groups:  &quot;Guess Who? Who? Yes! Them!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
When I got back into the car (and after all this was related), we started trying to think of names we could categorize:<br/>
 <br/>
Animal names: Beatles, Eagles, Byrds, Crazy Horse, Monkees, Turtles, Cat Stevens <br/>
(singing I Love My Dog), Doug & the Slugs (local to Vancouver, B.C. ) <br/>
<br/>
Weird and interesting names: !!! (pronounced chk, chk, chk like the <br/>
tongue-clicking of African bushmen), Smashmouth, Smashing Pumpkins, Golden <br/>
Earring, Canned Heat, The Killers, The Shins, The Smiths, Maroon 5, The Troggs, Simon and Garfunkel, R.E.M., Gary Puckett and the Union Gap &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Place names: Chicago, Boston, New York Dolls, John Denver <br/>
<br/>
Western themed: Blue Rodeo, Cowboy Junkies, Crazy Horse (again), John Denver <br/>
(again) <br/>
<br/>
Car themed: Cars, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Booker T and the MG&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
We know there are way more, but couldn&#39;t think of all of them right then.  Additions welcomed!<br/>
<br/>
Dd thought the absolute funniest name was The Doors. She was thinking of a bunch of dog doors/glass doors/screen doors/front doors/back doors and wondering how the heck they came up with that!   She chuckled about that all night.  It never occurred to me - all I think of is Jim Morrison and he&#39;s doesn&#39;t seem so funny to me...<br/>
<br/>
And then we talked about misheard lyrics. My favorites are &quot;Slow motion Walter, fire engine guy&quot; and &quot;&#39;Scuse me will I kiss this guy&quot;, not to mention the unitelligible lyrics of &quot;Jumping Jack Flash&quot; (as Whoopi Goldberg wished aloud in the movie &quot;Mick, Mick, speak English&quot;).  <br/>
<br/>
Michelle said she liked &quot;Stop the cat box/lock the cash box&quot; (she&#39;d seen an ad on tv with guys discussing the lyrics).  That lead to a search online when we got home for misheard lyrics.  She couldn&#39;t believe how many misheard versions of one song existed (and how many songs were on the site).  Kissthisguy.com has been shut down, but this one&#39;s not bad <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amiright.com/misheard/song/">http://www.amiright.com/misheard/song/</a><br/>
<br/>
It was quite the ramble and much fun, in any case!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576736810">This is a good story of just where an Animaniacs song can take you.  Several months ago my 10 year old dd and I were listening to the Countries of the World song.  This led to a search to find the lyrics so we could sing along.  That in turn led to a discussion and then search for whether Wacko missed any countries (yes, he did).  One of the countries he missed was the Maldives.  Which led to a discussion and impromptu research project on the Maldives.  Which then led in turn to Google Earth, which gave us lots of questions about Indonesia and Micronesia.<br/>
   <br/>
  To this day Ashanti perks up whenever she even hears mention of the Maldives.  One song and one idle question led to all that.<br/>

That&#39;s cool and I was excited, but it&#39;s 12 years old and all the  <br/>
links seemed to go to a re-direct page.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll restore the links to working order, especially if it&#39;s  <br/>
something I can methodically change with search and replace.  Later.   <br/>
So it&#39;s on my site but I rendered it invisible for now.  THANK YOU,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127755331">One thing that always intrigued me was, why does Wakko have a Scouse <br/>
accent?<br/>
<br/>
Which led me to this from Wikipedia:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wakko (Jess Harnell) wears a red cap, blue turtleneck and, as he <br/>
likes to point out, no pants. He speaks with a Scouse accent that <br/>
Harnell explicitly modeled after Ringo Starr (initially Harnell <br/>
created a John Lennon-esque voice for Wakko until he saw that the <br/>
character was short, so he just raised the pitch).&quot;<br/>

Gotta love that Google. :)<br/>
