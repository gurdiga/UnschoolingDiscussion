&gt; he needed you to come along.  He would probably ask something like &quot;Hey<br/>
&gt; Dawn, I need to go to Target today and I need you to come along because of<br/>
&gt; such and such.  What is your plan today?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So with Zac, how about &quot;Hey Zach later today I need to drop this stuff off<br/>
&gt; at Target and since Mom is working, I need you to come with me.  Do you<br/>
&gt; think morning or afternoon would be better?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s say Zac really isn&#39;t too interested in Target, dh might respond with<br/>
&gt; &quot;Well, there is a park around the corner from the store.  How about we pack<br/>
&gt; a lunch and have a picnic on the way back?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
