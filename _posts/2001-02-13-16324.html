&quot;reasonable&quot; force.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to the balance.  You have made a statement as fact which is your<br/>
opinion.  The facts are that &quot;justice&quot; in the U.S. is, indeed, all luck of<br/>
the draw as it is all dependent on who gets killed, who does the killing,<br/>
who has the money, who doesn&#39;t have the money, who know who and the<br/>
personalities of the respective law enforcement officers.  Anyone who claims<br/>
otherwise is not familiar with the realities of the law and what is<br/>
happening on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a group of FBI agents framed an individual who did 35 years for<br/>
this crime that he didn&#39;t commit.  The agents were given a warning.<br/>
<br/>
Another example, a cop in LA framed more than a dozen men for crimes ranging<br/>
from burglary to homicide.  One of those he framed got the death penalty.<br/>
When his &quot;game&quot; was discovered, he was tried and got 5 years.<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;you are right&quot; has nothing to do with it, the courts do not always have<br/>
anything to do with it as most cases never get to the courts.  Also, an<br/>
investigation can consist of nothing more than an interview after which the<br/>
cop involved writes a report recommending no further action.<br/>
<br/>
There are several crime computers, one of which is local, one of which is<br/>
statewide and one of which is nationwide.  Any stats on murders go to the<br/>
FBI and go into the national crime computer.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; The law reads &quot;responable force.&quot;  Each cop and DA defines this in a<br/>
&gt; different way.  You could be charged with murder or aggravated assault or<br/>
&gt; you could just get a warning.  Strickly luck of the draw.  However, you<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; be put in the crime computer. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never heard &quot;responsible force&quot; in any context.  It might be local to<br/>
&gt; where Lynda is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nobody who has killed another person will just get a warning.   There will<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; an investigation for definite sure.  If you&#39;re in the right, there&#39;s<br/>
nothing<br/>
&gt; to warn you about and it is NOT luck of the draw, it&#39;s the judgment of the<br/>
&gt; court.<br/>
