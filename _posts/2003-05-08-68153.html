 </span></blockquote>I get stuff going that interests ME and I don&#39;t ask my kids to be a part of <br/>
it (although they&#39;re turning into great &#39;enablers&#39; and can join in if they <br/>
like!  As an example of their &#39;enabling&#39;, they recently found rides home <br/>
from a local spring fair so that I wouldn&#39;t have to leave early and could <br/>
continue shearing my sheep.  They saw I was in the middle of &#39;intensely <br/>
interesting&#39; stuff and let me continue on.  I do the same for them.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s when the parent gets so intensely interested in the child, <br/>
especially when they think of  their children as a &#39;product&#39; they&#39;re <br/>
putting out (which harkens over to the whole stupid award thing - an Award <br/>
for a Great Product!), that things get botched up.  Once folks realize that <br/>
there is no &#39;product&#39;, they can usually let go of &#39;quality control&#39; and let <br/>
the kid be whomever they want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Think of unschooling as non-industrial art.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy, did this strike a resonant chord within me.  I still struggle with the <br/>
sense that I&#39;ve wasted my own potential.  I&#39;m hearing that from several <br/>
others here, too.  I&#39;m 42 years old, and what do I have to show for my life?  <br/>
I don&#39;t go to HS reunions because I can&#39;t handle the scrutiny.  I know so <br/>
much more was expected of me.  And so I find myself wanting so much more for <br/>
my children in this way -- at weak moments like this.  It&#39;s rather <br/>
compulsive, I realize.<br/>
<br/>
The thing I like about unschooling is that there are no definitions (and <br/>
therefore no limitations) placed on the concept of *potential.*  It&#39;s <br/>
completely up to the individual child, and a wise parent learns to back off <br/>
and let that flowering happen unimpeded.<br/>
<br/>
What an enormous improvement over the pressures that a standard education <br/>
normally exerts!<br/>
<br/>
A question, then.  How do you guys actually practice getting yourselves out <br/>
of the way and allowing your child to blossom into his/her own natural <br/>
potential?<br/>

<br/>
I get myself out of the way &lt;g&gt; by practicing my OWN potential!  I read, I <br/>
write, I bake and sew.  I&#39;m working on a website I&#39;ve only really dreamed <br/>
about until I was asked to share my unschooling experiences with others.  I <br/>
keep an irritating friend on board who&#39;s daughter goes to ps and is treated <br/>
like a worm.  I just spoke with her tonight.  She was ranting on and on <br/>
about how her daughter is failing English and never turns in her work.  How <br/>
she&#39;s grounded until the end of the year (!?!?!?! grrrr) because her grades <br/>
are horrible.  Yes, what a terrible reason to hang on to an old friend but <br/>
she keeps asking for my advice and I keep hoping she&#39;ll take it!  Yet, she <br/>
goes on to tell me they have a club at school called LOTR (Lord of the <br/>
RIngs).  They speak their own language.  Write intricate roll playing scenes <br/>
and characters.  Ona and on.  I&#39;m sorry but this doens&#39;t sound like a dumb <br/>
kid!  I could go on but I won&#39;t. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the bottom line is to live out YOUR dreams!  Fulfill YOUR potential! <br/>
  When you are busy with your own life, you&#39;ll quit worrying so much about <br/>
hers and one day, you&#39;ll walk in the room and be greeted by a child <br/>
exploding with fulfilled dreams and realized potential of her own!  I <br/>
believe that!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033206490">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m 42 years old, and what do I have to show for my life?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, now this really makes me MAD! &lt;bwg&gt;  What do you have to show???  Where <br/>
are your kids?  I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t walk into an unschooling classroom <br/>
somehwere, take a test and only then decide that you could do it.  I bet <br/>
there was a LOT of research, headaches, doubts, fear, you name it!  You <br/>
faced them all and took the plunge.  You are a mother.  You are influencing <br/>
the lives of hundreds, if not more, by changing the lives of a few (um, <br/>
sorry, not sure how many kids you have...lol).  Every person that witnesses <br/>
the beauty in your children is directly affected by you!  If it weren&#39;t for <br/>
YOU those kids wouldn&#39;t be here!<br/>
<br/>
So, grab an armload of pictures and a mountain of pride and show up at that <br/>
next reunion!  Slap an unschooling sticker on your bumper and dare anyone to <br/>
ask you about it!  It would be so easy to toss the kids into daycare and ps, <br/>
work a posh job and see them for two hours a night.  I haven&#39;t met a woman <br/>
yet that thought working was harder than being a stay at home mother.  (In <br/>
terms of workload.) But you take it a step further, you are taking full <br/>
responsibility for your family.  Your are enriching their liives by allowing <br/>
them to follow their dreams.  I&#39;d say you&#39;ve done a lot and should be DAMN <br/>
PROUD of it!<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, ok sermon over :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know the feeling. One of the reasons {I think} we have so much <br/>
frustration with my MIL is because my BIL wife has children from a <br/>
previous marriage {they have a young child together, slightly younger <br/>
our youngest} and the two that are old enough go to PS. The boy <br/>
{middle child} was in Kira&#39;s {my oldest} Kindergarten class. {only <br/>
for the couple of months she was in public school} So when my sil <br/>
goes and gushes  to her about what he is learning and what they do in <br/>
class, there is that reminder of what Kira &quot;should&quot; be doing. OH <br/>
YEAH, my SIL is now a substitute teacher. {so I have my mother, <br/>
sister, husband&#39;s grandmother and now my SIL who do, or have, like in <br/>
the case of the grandmother, working in the PS system. hip hip hurray <br/>
for me - LOL }<br/>
<br/>
My sil&#39;s oldest {13 I think} has just started the rebellious era of <br/>
her life, I believe. She is having a horrible time and doesn&#39;t have <br/>
many friends, her grades are dropping {she was a AB student}... <br/>
<br/>
MIL and my husband and I were talking and she was talking how <br/>
lazy &quot;A&quot; is, and about all this {obviously what the mom had said}. I <br/>
said &quot;WOW, Jon {my hubbie} that sounds like you. {because in school <br/>
he Intentionally did bad in math, just so he could get the easy <br/>
classes and slide through}Then she started talking how Jon could have <br/>
used all those upper math classes in life. We reminded her, he DOES <br/>
{he makes custom countertops and cabinets} and how books don&#39;t teach <br/>
anything like life experience. And that life is always is the best <br/>
teacher. <br/>
So she didn&#39;t say much after that, about her because she &quot;got&quot; that <br/>
her actions weren&#39;t a disappointment to us, because we could <br/>
understand where the kid was coming from. All too well. We both hated <br/>
school and had dropped out. {I graduated BEFORE my class with my GED-<br/>
LOL} He was the loner and I was like I can imagine her to be, tall, <br/>
skinny awkward kid getting picked on a lot. Pretending to fit in but <br/>
not doing a very good job of it. <br/>
<br/>
LOTS of baggage to unload.<br/>

Me too, me too!  We looking for a new house right now.  One of the houses <br/>
has 18&#39; ceilings in the formal living room.  I told my husband he&#39;d better <br/>
start planning my library!  Can you imagine?!?!  Walking in the front door, <br/>
surrounded by rich wooden bookcases, soaring 10 feet above your head??  I&#39;d <br/>
be like a kid, jumping on that ladder, one hand and foot hanging on for dear <br/>
life, and the others swaying wildly while I race around the room.  Now <br/>
THAT&#39;S a merry-go-round for Mom!<br/>
<br/>
One problem.  We&#39;d have to take out a second loan just to fill the shelves!  <br/>

life.......Where&#39;s Aimee??  Wheeeeeee! LOL<br/>
