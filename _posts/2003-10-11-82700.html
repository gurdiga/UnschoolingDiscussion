 </span></blockquote>Just curious what it is about this show that you don&#39;t like. Accalia, 4 1/2,<br/>
likes to watch this show from time to time, but it&#39;s not a big deal either<br/>
way. <br/>
I only saw one of these, and it was all about the boys and men being turned <br/>
into girls and women and thinking it was the most horrible thing that ever <br/>
happened. They never came to any conclusions that being female would be anything <br/>
less than horrible, and were finally changed back.<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty horrified, and ranted for quite a while to the amusement of my <br/>
nephew, who was watching this with me. (Sean was pretty much oblivious to the <br/>
plot...the tv was on, but he was paying only minor attention to it. &gt;I&lt; on the <br/>
other hand, cracked him up.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh...we don&#39;t restrict stuff either. I do share my opinions and ask <br/>
questions. ANd when Julian was little I used to sing &quot;Barney is a dinosaur who feeds on <br/>
little children...&quot; which cracked HIM up, and made him want to watch it more, <br/>
so that I would sing it....<br/>
