<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314465911">I have lots of trouble falling asleep.  Always have.  It is much harder if I<br/>
am trying to get to sleep.  I get all tense and then I&#39;m awake for hours.<br/>
<br/>
Things I have found helpful either individually or all together:<br/>
<br/>
*A bath with Lavender essential oil<br/>
*A cup of mugwort tea<br/>
*A cup of chamomile tea<br/>
*A cup of Sleepytime Extra Celestial Seasonings<br/>
*sleeping outside<br/>
*Deciding not to sleep, just spend some time imagining, laying down with my<br/>
eyes closed and daydreaming<br/>
*laying down with my eyes closed, mentally relaxing my body, starting at the<br/>
feet and visualizing my body being slowly dipped into warm honey<br/>
