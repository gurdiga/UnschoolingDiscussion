<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214391133">I thought this was really cool ...<br/>
<br/>
I showed my daughters, ages 4 and 6, parts of &quot;Bill Cosby: Himself&quot; <br/>
from the early 80&#39;s. The older girl, especially, thought it was <br/>
really funny.<br/>
<br/>
Then I remembered that in February we had read a book called &quot;Super-<br/>
Fine Valentine&quot; by BC and told the girls, &quot;Oh, he&#39;s the man who wrote <br/>
that book about the valentine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So my 4 year old (!) suggested I do a search on the library computer <br/>
so we could find more books by him. Well, I did a search and what <br/>
came up? A DVD called &quot;Best of the Best of The Electric Company.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t even know Bill Cosby was IN the Electric Company!<br/>
<br/>
Nor did I know that Morgan Freeman was in it ... or that Joan Rivers <br/>
and Gene Wilder did the voices for Letterman. <br/>
<br/>
This is such a total trip. I&#39;m watching it with the girls, and it&#39;s <br/>
interesting to see what I remember, what I forgot until I saw it <br/>
again, how it comes on differently each season, the hip 70s music <br/>
throughout, what my girls like or not (the older one thinks Letterman <br/>
is creepy; the younger doesn&#39;t like Morgan Freeman as the DJ), and so <br/>
on ...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a blast! :)<br/>

find it strange that The Easy Reader (Morgan Freeman ~ who was my <br/>
*favorite*) grew up to be an actor LOL.  Playing God, no less. :)<br/>

My husband came to this country from Greece when he was 2.  He learned to<br/>
speak English from watching the Electric Company and a host of other things<br/>
on TV - including soap operas his grandmother watched.  In fact, recently we<br/>
went to a wing ding at our library and Charles Keating did a beautiful<br/>
monologue on aging.  Anyway, Charles Keating has been on soap operas and<br/>
there were some of his soap opera friends there.  My husband (who has less<br/>
than any interest in soap operas) knew of all of them from his early years<br/>
of watching TV.<br/>
