<div id="ygrps-yiv-840490766">So, I guess it&#39;s very strange to have an eight year old that doesn&#39;t <br/>
write, even his name!  Usually my family has been very supportive of <br/>
homeschooling.  BUT I guess that&#39;s because they assumed the boys <br/>
were &quot;ahead&quot; probably due to the fact they are tournament chess <br/>
players.    My youngest doesn&#39;t want to write and I don&#39;t believe in <br/>
making him.  Well, family thinks he should be reading too but the fact <br/>
he &quot;CAN&#39;T&quot; write his name has caused quite the uproar and even has my <br/>
husband upset.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess this is more of a vent but it seems like I have not one ounce <br/>
of support right now.  : (  If didn&#39;t have my older two that have <br/>
turned out &quot;just fine&quot; I might be worried.  My oldest is 14 and the <br/>
shinning example of a teen.  EVERYONE, EVERYWHERE compliments how well <br/>
behaved and smart he is.  <br/>

seen a need to bother with it. There&#39;s a big jump from &quot;doesn&#39;t&quot; <br/>
to &quot;can&#39;t&quot; that they seem to not be getting. My DS can go weeks and <br/>
weeks without picking up a book or magazine to read. Just because he <br/>
chooses not to read, he doesn&#39;t read for a while, does not mean he <br/>
can&#39;t. Hmm pondering &#39;aloud&#39; - is there something that someone in <br/>
the family &quot;can&quot; do but doesn&#39;t do? For instance, maybe riding a <br/>
bicycle? Something that you could use as an example when your DH <br/>
starts getting nervous (everyone else can go fly a kite but since <br/>
he&#39;s right there it helps to have him on board).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

longest time, and was 11 when she read, but she would copy words  <br/>
others would write down long before she tried to make them up on her  <br/>
own, and LONG before she could read them back.   Maybe he&#39;d be  <br/>
interested in that.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be pencil, you might mess with letters with a  <br/>
stick in the sand (or a finger in flour or sugar or pudding) or a  <br/>
chalkboard or something impermanent.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby only got a signature lately.  All the kids and I signed &quot;assent  <br/>
to participate in research&quot; forms for someone&#39;s master&#39;s thesis, and  <br/>
Kirby signed and walked out, and the rest of us looked amazed at a  <br/>
nice-looking signature.  Kirby&#39;s 19.  Last fall at the conference in  <br/>
Boston he signed a copy of Moving a Puddle and didn&#39;t have a nice- <br/>
looking signature at all.  So I said &quot;Kirby has a signature!&quot;  Marty  <br/>
said, &quot;That&#39;s because he has to write at work, and I&#39;ll have big  <br/>
thighs!&quot;  (Kirby works at a pizza restaurant that takes LOTS of phone  <br/>
orders, and did that for the first several weeks he was there.  Marty  <br/>
is working at a grocery store and does LOTS of pushing and retrieving  <br/>
of grocery carts in a big parking lot.)<br/>
<br/>
If the freaking out of the family is worse than the pain of the name  <br/>
writing, maybe just ask your son to practice his name.  If that  <br/>
freaking out is worse than the stress of asking the family to back  <br/>
off, then don&#39;t press him.  That&#39;s my best, but imperfect,  <br/>
suggestion.  I&#39;d go with the impermanent materials which might lessen  <br/>
his stress.<br/>
<br/>
Can he enter his name with a videogame remote control or a keyboard?   <br/>
There are adults who can&#39;t.  The world is changing.  Handwriting  <br/>
isn&#39;t as crucial as it once was.<br/>

<br/>
When Kate was young and we weren&#39;t yet unschooling, she was really<br/>
struggling with writing. The physical act of writing was almost painful for<br/>
her. She could read well (finally, she read late, but when she did, she took<br/>
off), we were using curriculum and she could do all the work orally. She<br/>
could articulate and verbalize wonderful stories, but she could not get them<br/>
down on paper. I was concerned as she was about 10 and consulted a few<br/>
&quot;experts&quot;.  I was actually told by the experts to not worry. Since she could<br/>
type, they said let her go with that. They felt that with the world the way<br/>
it is, that the &#39;need to write&#39; did not exist and wasn&#39;t worth the stress. I<br/>
was pretty surprised by this at the time. There was some kind of name for<br/>
not being able to write.....then, the following year I learned that my<br/>
father-in-law never wrote and still doesn&#39;t. He is 70 years old, has<br/>
multiple master degrees and has owned his own successful business for 30<br/>
some years. And he does not and will not write anything beyond signing his<br/>
name. Never has. He hires someone to do his writing if it&#39;s needed. He<br/>
managed very well even before the days electronic communication. That helped<br/>
me a great deal in relaxing and getting perspective.  Once I relaxed and<br/>
stopped &quot;making&quot; Kate write, she stopped all of it. Didn&#39;t write, type or<br/>
anything for a while. Then suddenly at about 12 or 13 she started typing her<br/>
ideas and stories....volumes of them. At about 14 she picked up a pencil<br/>
again. She writes all the time. She still prefers typing to writing (as do<br/>
I).  So much of what people worry about just doesn&#39;t really matter in the<br/>
long run of life. And rarely so their worst case scenarios come true.<br/>

go straight to the principal&#39;s office the day after we got the <br/>
congratulations letter and inform him that there must have been some <br/>
mistake!  It was pretty humiliating.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how on earth I ever managed to be nominated for <br/>
induction, let alone passed muster for induction!  I did not recall <br/>
ever applying for the NHS (if that&#39;s what you do).  (I wondered if I <br/>
might have been stoned or something and applied as a goof.)  But, in <br/>
retrospect I think perhaps a beloved English teacher or art teacher <br/>
of mine must have nominated me.  I mean, I cut so many classes in <br/>
high school that there were teachers whose classes I was *supposed* <br/>
to be in who didn&#39;t even know who I was!  There were classes I just <br/>
never attended.  There were whole days I totally blew off (lots of them).<br/>
<br/>
To tell the truth, my induction into the NHS really diminished the <br/>
stature of that organization in my eyes!!  I figured they just <br/>
weren&#39;t being very careful about who got admitted, and maybe they <br/>
didn&#39;t like to admit that they had made a mistake (which, I believed <br/>
they had - I believed that I had somehow slipped in there by some gross error).<br/>
<br/>
In my book, high school attendance was optional, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean I felt good about my choices at that time.  I was certainly <br/>
shamed enough about my incorrigible class-cutting and wild behavior <br/>
by people whose opinions were important to me (namely, Mom & <br/>
Dad).  Nevertheless, I just couldn&#39;t make myself endure that hell for <br/>
the sake of their acceptance.  In retrospect, I do feel good now <br/>
about the choices I made, but at the time, I was a &quot;bad&quot; girl in <br/>
everyone&#39;s eyes, including my own.<br/>
<br/>
So, there it is:  a gold NHS sticker on my high school diploma, and I <br/>
gotta say, the whole thing has proven to be worthless really.  Except <br/>
that I have a pretty nutty-looking, conflicted high school transcript!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208064019">Thanks for the replys.  He does have some writing issues.  On his <br/>
own he has copied words from books around the house fine.  He wanted <br/>
to learn how to write his name but couldn&#39;t (he can copy rather <br/>
clearly) so I told him just to write his initials.  RJ which he <br/>
usually writes JR with the r backwards.  I worked in a pharamacy (we <br/>
often couldn&#39;t read the dr.&#39;s handwriting)and in an office full of <br/>
engineers where 90% wrote on about a 3rd grade level so I&#39;m not very <br/>
worried.  It&#39;s just dealing with others opinions and concerns that <br/>
is hard.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t play chess myself.  I guess that would be the perfect <br/>
example that children can learn and succeed on their own.  I&#39;m proud <br/>
of the fact that they do an outreach program and all 3 teach kids <br/>
chess.  They have taught HUNDREDS of children how to play.  I also <br/>
don&#39;t behave very well so I&#39;m amazed my kids do at just the right <br/>
time like at family weddings and get togethers.  I think they like <br/>
adults and get along with them and that is why people think they are <br/>
well behaved.  They also do all the normal kid stuff.  Their <br/>
favorite show is the Simpsons, lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-593083233">Our school posted the list of who got into NHS on a bulletin board,  <br/>
after giving it a big build up for weeks in advance, so we all had to  <br/>
go stand around and look at the bulletin board in public to see  <br/>
whether we got in or not. People were crying if they didn&#39;t get in,  <br/>
it had been made such a big deal. And, they posted the list by grade  <br/>
point average, so everyone could see that, for instance, I was the  <br/>
person with the lowest gpa to be admitted, which made me an object of  <br/>
ridicule both among the 47 or so people with higher gpas than mine  <br/>
and, weirdly, among the people with lower gpas who hadn&#39;t been admitted.<br/>
<br/>
And, after all that drama, it turns out that it makes no difference  <br/>
in life at all whether you were in NHS or not, as far as I can tell.<br/>

I am always amazed when friends of mine can&#39;t understand why anyone  <br/>
would homeschool. I always want to say, &quot;Don&#39;t you _remember_ school?  <br/>
Were you so stoned the whole time that you can&#39;t remember any of it?  <br/>
Or have you watched Mr. Holland&#39;s Opus so many times that all your  <br/>
real memories have been replaced with Hollywood reconstructions?&quot;<br/>

One of my friends actually cried after I told her we were going to  <br/>
homeschool. She has this big liberal commitment to public schools,  <br/>
which isn&#39;t very well thought out but is definitely deeply emotional  <br/>
for her. When I reminded her of some things she had told me about her  <br/>
high school experience, she said, &quot;Oh, it wasn&#39;t all that bad.&quot; I  <br/>
said, &quot;Sorry, but &#39;not all that bad&#39; isn&#39;t good enough for my kids.&quot;<br/>

(lifetimes, I suppose, one apiece) others will likely try to make  <br/>
them feel they missed out on something great, deep, meaningful and  <br/>

HEY!  A kinda decent article on homeschooling, which mentions  <br/>
unschooling without sounding ridiculous.   I&#39;ve quoted a little block  <br/>
of it.  Laura Derrick used to be very active in the AOL days:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
========================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some parents follow an educational philosophy known as &quot;unschooling,&quot;  <br/>
where the children are encouraged to follow their own interests  <br/>
rather than adhering to a fixed curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
Laura Derrick, president of the National Home Education Network, has  <br/>
followed this philosophy with her 14-year-old son and 12-year-old  <br/>
daughter.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My son learned to read before he was 3 and I realized then we were  <br/>
working better than any school program ever designed,&quot; she said.  <br/>
&quot;Children are born wanting to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lisa Dean, who was a lawyer before she became a mother, said  <br/>
homeschooling her children was tremendously rewarding but also very  <br/>
exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=========================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I left that last paragraph because I figure CNN will get maybe 1200 e- <br/>
mails from female lawyers who will figure they&#39;re the first and only   <br/>
to say &quot;I was a lawyer even AFTER I became a mother!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205350482">I saw another site&#39;s posting of that Reuter&#39;s article and it had one  <br/>
more paragraph at the end which CNN left off.  I think CNN&#39;s cool,  <br/>
then. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

-=-Back in science class, the children were satisfied that heavy and  <br/>
light objects both fall to earth at the same speed, just as Galileo  <br/>
observed, even if neither they nor their mothers seemed to know why.  <br/>
And then it was time for lunch.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have this to say about that:<br/>
If no one before or during the time of Galileo except Galileo knew  <br/>
it, there&#39;s no reason to think ALL the people alive since &quot;know  <br/>
it.&quot;   Some physics formula on a piece of paper doesn&#39;t explain it  <br/>
anyway, not in English, and not in a way that really matters.<br/>
<br/>
And I wonder if the webmaster or editor who decided to include that  <br/>
paragraph and the reporter who wrote it have seen the scene in  <br/>
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead where they drop a feather  <br/>
and... what was it?  A wooden ball or something. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh well... doesn&#39;t matter.  There are some things that don&#39;t fall as  <br/>
quickly as others, and those get OTHER scribbled-on-paper proofs. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the replys.  He does have some writing issues.  On his <br/>
&gt; own he has copied words from books around the house fine.  He wanted <br/>
&gt; to learn how to write his name but couldn&#39;t (he can copy rather <br/>
&gt; clearly) so I told him just to write his initials.  RJ which he <br/>
&gt; usually writes JR with the r backwards.  &gt; Barb in VA<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just be careful about thinking he has &quot;issues&quot; because he writes some <br/>
letters in a different order and some backwards.  That is completely <br/>
normal.  Many children I taught that were in the second grade were <br/>
still writing that way.  Others in third were also.    <br/>
<br/>
Remember, he has a lot of things to consider when he is learning how <br/>
to write.  He has to do so many things that we take for granted.  He <br/>
has to make the letters that he hasn&#39;t had a lot of experience with, <br/>
he has to do it in some accepted order and all this with little hands <br/>
that aren&#39;t so used to holding a pencil.  Little ones like your ds <br/>
shouldn&#39;t feel pressure to learn things no matter how easy they seem <br/>
to us.  I&#39;m thinking that he might be feeling that pressure even <br/>
though you don&#39;t intend for him to.<br/>

And, Laura&#39;s family is here, visiting Southern California, right now.  <br/>
Guess why?<br/>

Laura and her dh, John Pritchett, and their two always-unschooled  <br/>

he wishes I had been in the military for at least one enlistment, <br/>
THEN I&quot;D UNDERSTAND, because I just don&#39;t get it. <br/>
I&#39;ve been married to the military for almost 16 years. I understand <br/>
enough, thanks. I am just ready for us to be DONE. At least he <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135609246">My daughter went to high school last year.  I told her from the <br/>
beginning, &quot;you better not make the honor roll, cause I&#39;m not <br/>
sticking that damn bumper sticker on my car&quot;  Well she made the <br/>
honor roll.<br/>
The first thing she said to her friends was &quot;man, my mom&#39;s gonna be <br/>
mad at me.&quot;  She brought home the bumper sticker and was teasing me <br/>
about sneaking it on my car.  I did tell her I would put it on if <br/>
she really wanted me to, but I had a real conflict with it.  She was <br/>
a die hard unschooler until she decided to check out high school, so <br/>
she really didn&#39;t want me to put it on.  We went to the honor roll <br/>
banquet where they called up everyone and gave them a certificate.  <br/>
I couldn&#39;t believe the who-ha they made of it all.  Also, they <br/>
divided them up into &quot;regular&quot; honor roll and &quot;exceptional&quot; honor <br/>
roll. :-p<br/>
The dinner took about 4 hours!  When we were leaving I said to <br/>
her, &quot;you better not make the honor roll next year, cause I&#39;m not <br/>
coming to this damn banquet again.&quot;<br/>
She is having such a different high school experience than I did, <br/>
and different from all of the kids she&#39;s in school with.  It&#39;s <br/>
really been a facinating &quot;social science&quot; experiment for both of us.<br/>
If it weren&#39;t for French and Drama and loving her French teacher and <br/>
going to Paris and Barcelona this Spring with the French club, we <br/>
both wonder if she would still be there.  Those huge positives <br/>
outweigh the vast amount of little negatives at this point.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen that so much with kids who voluntarily go to school, or  <br/>
kids who are still in school but whose parents would rather they come  <br/>
home.  It makes SUCH a big difference that nearly every statement and  <br/>
assumption about school seems to need revision.  It&#39;s not &quot;school  <br/>
causes X,&quot; or &quot;School is like X,&quot; but &quot;Being forced to attend school  <br/>
involuntarily causes X&quot; and &quot;A school full of reluctant, resistent  <br/>
children without choices is like X.&quot;<br/>

up too late, then went to bed and cried herself to sleep.  It was <br/>
right before her period and she was thinking about a lot of sad <br/>
things and it was all coming out.  Her eyes were really bad, and she <br/>
was still weepy the next morning and I was saying to her, &quot;just stay <br/>
home&quot;.  We were in the car, on the way to school before she finally <br/>
relented to skipping it.  She was really mad at herself for caring <br/>
about school so much.  She couldn&#39;t figure out why she cared about <br/>
being there, when so many of her friends skip or stay home as much <br/>
as possible.  All I could think of was, it&#39;s her choice to be there <br/>
so maybe in some way, she feels like she is letting herself down, or <br/>
maybe if she lets herself feel like, &quot;I don&#39;t have to go&quot;, she might <br/>
stop going a lot and eventually not at all.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know.  But her feelings about it are perplexing to both of <br/>
us.  <br/>
