but quickly get bored or don&#39;t want to go in depth.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t assume that kids are looking for a lot of depth each time they express <br/>
an interest in something. While some of them do get caught up in great <br/>
interests (Pokemon, historical fiction, rockets, dinosaurs, etc.) lots of <br/>
others are satisfied with the short answer while quickly moving on to the <br/>
next quetion. But those quick little interests and those quick little <br/>
answers will help create meaning in your child&#39;s big picture of the world. <br/>
Another piece in their puzzle of the universe, to use PamS&#39;s analogy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wasn&#39;t this the kid who had gone to school?  We let a couple of our <br/>
(formerly) schooled kids have some time to unschool their way into life <br/>
after they left school.  (These were the ones whose other parent opposed <br/>
homeschooling.)  I think it did them a lot of good.  What&#39;s so magic about <br/>
age 19 that a kid automatically has to be grown up and out into the working <br/>
world by then?  We aren&#39;t supposed to worry if a kid isn&#39;t reading by some <br/>
certain age.  Why should they be ready to work by a certain age?  I&#39;ve even <br/>
heard of some parents who were willing to support their kid away from home <br/>
but not in college during the &quot;college years&quot; if they were doing anything <br/>
that could lead to a career.<br/>
<br/>
I think chucking a kid out of the house at a certain age to make it on <br/>
their own is something like throwing a kid in the water so he&#39;ll learn to swim.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990711540">Health insurance is kind of like government money in some ways.  When <br/>
they give out the money, they tell you what you can do with it.  It&#39;s <br/>
all about them telling you what THEY think you should be doing.  They <br/>
think it&#39;s good for kids to be in school, so they offer big <br/>
incentives to keep them in school.  And they probably feel very self-<br/>
righteous about this &quot;good&quot; thing they&#39;re doing.  Kind of like a <br/>
teacher handing out stickers for kids who learn their lessons well. <br/>
<br/>
Schools train us to live in a world where we accept these kinds of <br/>
incentives.  Unschoolers are going to have these things to deal with, <br/>
but the more we deal with them and inform others why we deal with <br/>
them differently, the better chance we have of having an impact on <br/>
the world.  <br/>
<br/>
I know we hardly use our health insurance at all now that our family <br/>
is being treated by a homeopath.  The insurance won&#39;t pay for a cent <br/>
of it.  They want to discourage anything other than allopathic <br/>
medicine.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember once when my insurance would have paid for a vaccination <br/>
but wouldn&#39;t pay for a blood test to see if the child was already <br/>
immune (turns out he was and didn&#39;t need the vaccination!)  And when <br/>
I wanted to use infertility drugs, the insurance wouldn&#39;t pay for it <br/>
but they would&#39;ve paid for an abortion.  It&#39;s all about choice, and <br/>
insurance companies don&#39;t want to give it to us. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s just it, the part I can&#39;t shake.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get a paycheck for what I do, yet I do a lot of work.  I take <br/>
care of our 8 yo, I keep house (sporadically &lt;g&gt;), I do the finances. I <br/>
have mega-guilt sometimes and need constant reassurance from dh that <br/>
what I do is valid and valuable to him, even if I&#39;m not bringing in a <br/>
paycheck.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if I could simply allow my kids to &quot;work on their <br/>
music&quot; for the benefit of the greater good, (they might be next Elvis, <br/>
who knows?--one of them wants to be) but I don&#39;t think that benefits <br/>
them much at this point in time.  They&#39;re not gifted in such a way that <br/>
would make giving up everything else for that greater good worthwhile.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the qualities that I value is independence.  How can I foster <br/>
that in my young, able-bodied men if I allow them to be completely <br/>
dependent?  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong...there&#39;s no hard-and-fast rule in our house.  Each <br/>
of my two older children are met by me at the point of their need.  My <br/>
20 yo doesn&#39;t work as much as my 17 yo.  They have different strengths <br/>
and weaknesses, and their goals and aspirations are different.  I don&#39;t <br/>
treat them the same by any means. Different circumstances require <br/>
different reponses.   But here is a minimum amount of participation in <br/>
the household and in the workforce that is required.  The only harm I <br/>
see in it is that they haven&#39;t known the satisfaction of hard physical <br/>
labor, like I did when I was a teenager, and is the tradition in my <br/>
family (picking tomatoes, yard work, etc.).  I think they&#39;re too soft, <br/>
but I let it go because they handle themselves maturely in other areas <br/>
and I believe they will know how to work hard when the time is right.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s the part I can&#39;t shake.  Able bodied people should be working <br/>
and contributing to society in some way.<br/>
