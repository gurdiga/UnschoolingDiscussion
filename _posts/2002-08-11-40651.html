Almost anything that&#39;s created and packaged to be used for &quot;Education&quot; is<br/>
junk. Hey, that&#39;s a big part of what&#39;s wrong with schools -- it&#39;s<br/>
prepackaged and predigested ideas and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
But you are a creative individual and so are your kids. You are all unique !<br/>
<br/>
You can see for yourself about HOP when and if someone you know gets it, but<br/>
like Sandra implied, it&#39;s a waste of good money, and I&#39;ve never seen it.<br/>
