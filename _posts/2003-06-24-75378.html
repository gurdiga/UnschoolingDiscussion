&lt;&lt; In the US people don&#39;t go around telling people they&#39;re Christians. It&#39;s<br/>
 just assumed. It&#39;d be like telling people they&#39;re human ;-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    I was talking to a woman at a party once, and when I responded to one of <br/>
her questions that I was not Christian, she was speechless.  <br/>
    It&#39;s similar to assuming Alex goes to school.   I love when people ask <br/>
what grade he is in, and he tells them, I don&#39;t go to school.  Again, speechless <br/>
is usually the reaction.  <br/>
