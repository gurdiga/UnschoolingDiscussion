<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143066773">LOL Tia. Did you just see my post after yours? I feel the same thing. You hit the nail right on the head for me. I guess I feel like my dd who is 9 is acting the same as her sister who is 4. I know it&#39;s not really true. I mean afterall she is reading and writing, but sometimes it&#39;s just so hard to let go of those feelings that we have of what a &quot;9&quot; year old is supposed to be doing and what they will choose to do when given the freedom.<br/>

LOL Tia. Did you just see my post after yours? I feel the same thing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s funny Kathy! At least we know we aren&#39;t alone &#39;eh? My kids aren&#39;t<br/>
reading yet though; I think I&#39;d relax more if they were. Daily practice<br/>
is one thing that keeps me tied to &quot;school&quot;. I&quot;m good at it though. When<br/>
someone asks my son if he did school today, he always says no. So, he&#39;s<br/>
not pained about it in any way hee hee. They are surrounded with a great<br/>
learning-encouraged kind of environment...days just feel like perpetual<br/>
summer vacation. Know what I mean? Tia in Fl.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one of the things that solidified my confidence in unschooling, when <br/>
Kirby was little.  The things he came across on his own or discovered while we <br/>
were out and about were frequently better than I could have planned!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The old question of &quot;when do they learn that days are not just<br/>
about play&quot; comes up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Look at the adults you know.  Some quit playing years ago.  They shut down <br/>
their senses of humor, they closed off their sense of wonder, they blush if they <br/>
accidently have a fleeting thought that something is REALLY COOL!<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t want your kids to be that way, do you?<br/>
<br/>
When ARE days not just about play?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been collecting morning glory seeds to give to my sister who&#39;s just <br/>
gotten a new house.  Every day I go out and collect seeds.  It&#39;s fun.  It&#39;s <br/>
soothing.  It has become a game for me, and I&#39;m learning a lot about the plants.  In <br/>
past years I&#39;ve waited until after frost to collect seeds, but the <br/>
housewarming party is next weekend, the 12th, and that&#39;s pre-frost.  <br/>
<br/>
It only takes half a day for some pods that weren&#39;t dry to dry breakable.  A <br/>
full day, one can be totally dry.  So I check every day.<br/>
<br/>
I could spend $2 and buy her some seeds, or not even bother.  She could buy <br/>
her own damned seeds.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m playing.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I started going to bed at 10:00, but one thing and another <br/>
happened with the kids, so at 11:45 I was FINALLY saying &quot;This is it, see you guys.&quot;  <br/>
Kirby had a friend over, and they were playing a game.  Marty was on the <br/>
computer, and listening to music.  Holly had been doing something that involved <br/>
cloth and dolls.  As I was loading the dishwasher, I muttered that the floor <br/>
needed to be mopped.   Holly said &quot;That&#39;s MY job!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s never done it before, and I don&#39;t do it a whole lot myself.<br/>
<br/>
So she asked me a couple of logistical questions, and I thanked her and went <br/>
to bed, while she was sweeping in preparation.<br/>
<br/>
I woke up this morning.  The kitchen was mopped really well.  The mop had <br/>
been rinsed and was set in a good place to dry.  Downstairs, there was a pile of <br/>
phonics worksheets (out of a phonics book that surfaced when we rearranged the <br/>
den), filled out, torn out, scattered on the floor in front of the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and Marty and I had planned to get up at 9:00 to watch Wayne Brady.  I <br/>
got up at 6:30, did a bunch of stuff, woke them up and they were both too <br/>
tired and decided to pass.<br/>
<br/>
No problem.<br/>
<br/>
We were just going to do it for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby goes to work at 11:30 and then teaches beginning karate at 4:00, takes <br/>
his own level class at 5:00, and a weapons/kobudo class at 6:00.  That&#39;s a <br/>
seriously scheduled day for him.  Yet it&#39;s play, because they&#39;re things he <br/>
chooses to do, and likes to do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They are happy and relaxed and exploratory...just what I want my kids to<br/>
be! And it hasn&#39;t always been this way so I appreciate the progress. But<br/>
is it ever time to &quot;grow up&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;grow up&quot; you mean stop thinking the world is a wonderful place, maybe <br/>
you should take back your wish.<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;grow up&quot; you mean grow through the stage of adolescence, realize they <br/>
could reproduce, start to experience the urge to maybe go out on their own, <br/>
maybe mate, maybe explore the world without mom or dad, yes.  That will happen <br/>
if you&#39;re lucky.<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;grow up&quot; you mean prematurally pretend to be &quot;grown&quot; and <br/>
sober/serious/businesslike/no-nonsense, people have been doing that for a long time, and it <br/>
hasn&#39;t made the world a better place.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 17, 14 and 11.  They&#39;re responsible with their things.  They keep <br/>
their word.  They&#39;re considerate of others&#39; feelings.  They&#39;re honest and <br/>
careful with money.  I wish more adults were.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The old question of &quot;when do they learn that days are not just<br/>

<br/>
 They are happy and relaxed and exploratory...just what I want my kids to<br/>
be! And it hasn&#39;t always been this way so I appreciate the progress. But<br/>
 is it ever time to &quot;grow up&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I would love to say that my kids would always think the days were full<br/>
of play. Hopefully if they grow older and find something they really love to<br/>
do that will support them, they will think that way. My husband, finally<br/>
after years of searching found what he really loves to do and because of<br/>
that, he is terrrific at it and loves doing it. I hope the same for our<br/>
children. So my answer to the first question would be &quot;hopefully never.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I feel like anyone learns better when they &quot;play.&quot; Meaning if it&#39;s fun for<br/>
them (playing) they learn from it. I absolutely hate messing with the<br/>
computer and different programs. I just don&#39;t enjoy it. I get on, do what I<br/>
want to do and that&#39;s it. My husband loves playing around with all sorts of<br/>
things on here. He has tried to show me. I don&#39;t like it, so when he does<br/>
show me, I usually don&#39;t remember how to do it the next day. It&#39;s not fun<br/>
for me. He on the other hand, when he gets a free even ing where he can sit<br/>
on here for an hour or so goes nuts. He loves it, he&#39;s good at it and really<br/>
enjoys it. He&#39;s learning tons while I&#39;m learning nothing. Well not really<br/>
but you get the picture.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s playing and learning. I&#39;m not playing and dreading it. I think that<br/>
pretty much goes for most things in life. Play is different for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
I just posted something to another list when someone was talking about their<br/>
kids watching mindless tv. I mentioned that my son adores YuGiOh. It&#39;s one<br/>
show he watches that I just don&#39;t enjoy. But I would never say it was<br/>
stupid. For him, it&#39;s not at all. That show lead to him wanting to play the<br/>
card game. That lead to him reading better, it lead to him doing math<br/>
better. Then he wanted to enter tournaments and I watched this skinny little<br/>
8 year old waltz into a store like he owned the place, walk up to 17 year<br/>
old strangers and have a conversation with them and either play a game or<br/>
trade cards like he was doing it all his life. I was quite impressed. For<br/>
him, it was all play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627066658">-=-sometimes it&#39;s just so hard to let go of those feelings that we have of <br/>
what a &quot;9&quot; year old is supposed to be doing and what they will choose to do when <br/>
given the freedom.-=-<br/>
<br/>
In school kids who are nine aren&#39;t allowed to play with kids who are seven, <br/>
or twelve.  Maybe not even with kids who are eight or ten.  And they extend <br/>
that to their out-of-school lives, lots of times, telling other kids &quot;You&#39;re a <br/>
baby, you can&#39;t play with us,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re just a FIRST grader.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers don&#39;t have those divisions and prejudices.   So we see how <br/>
children really act.  School sees how their rules make children act.  But they think <br/>
all children are in school, and so they think that it&#39;s natural behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Someone my age who grew up in my hometown moved away from New Mexico over 30 <br/>
years ago.    I contacted her last week for the first time in all that time.  <br/>
A mutual friend had run into her, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
I sent her Holly&#39;s webpage so she could see the photo of my family.   She <br/>
wrote this back:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now for the SUPER-SIZED WOW -- your daughter Holly!  She seems like the<br/>
paragon of maturity or at least a point far beyond where we were at her<br/>
age.  You must be very proud of her (and her brothers).  In Holly&#39;s<br/>
profile she refers to her cousin, Gina Trujillo.  Is Gina one of Nada&#39;s<br/>
daughter&#39;s?  I&#39;m not surprised that a daughter of yours has an<br/>
appreciation for the musical.  It seems like yesterday that we were<br/>
hanging out and you and Jon Tsosie provided the entertainment.<br/>
You were singing Big Yellow Taxi long before Amy Grant or Counting Crows<br/>
did.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s page is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/holly">http://sandradodd.com/holly</a><br/>
<br/>
So someone (with a vivid memory, I should add--photographic memory for people <br/>
and places) who knew me when I was the age any of my kids are now (and <br/>
younger) thinks Holly seems mature.<br/>
<br/>
I could cite twenty instances of &quot;immature&quot; behavior on Holly&#39;s part in the <br/>
past week, if anyone wanted to call playing Barbies immature, or carrying a <br/>
baby doll, or playing with stuffed animals, or putting stickers on all her little <br/>
scabs and zits (stick-on earrings), or coloring her hair with a marker the <br/>
same day she&#39;s styling all her Barbies, who shampoos and curls her My Little <br/>
Ponies, who was really excited about a preying mantis in the car, and squatted to <br/>
watch and discuss snails and a slug in the yard last night.<br/>
<br/>
When is she going to grow up?<br/>
<br/>
She is at once more mature and less mature than the school-issue 11 year old. <br/>
 She would be in sixth grade.  How do sixth graders dress?  Holly dresses as <br/>
an adult sometimes, and as a little girl sometimes.  How do sixth graders <br/>
talk?  Holly talks like a person, about real interests, and asks real questions <br/>
and she cares about the answers.<br/>
<br/>
If you worry about your children, make an effort to be around other <br/>
unschooled kids, older than yours, and see if you think they&#39;re growing up okay.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ll lose your worries.<br/>

<br/>
pretty much goes for most things in life. Play is different for all of us. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Play can be really hard work, too.<br/>
<br/>
One night last week Holly dug a DEEP hole in a low place where the yard had <br/>
flooded.  She was just goofing around, but dug about two feet, picking up <br/>
shovelfuls of mud and arranging time to make the hold even deeper, and then playing <br/>
in the hole.  She was out there with just a flashlight.  I went it and opened <br/>
a window where she was, turned all the lights on in that room and aimed a <br/>
desk lamp out toward her.<br/>
<br/>
She worked on that for an hour.<br/>
<br/>
It was sweaty, dirty work, but it was voluntary play.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has a bunch of kids who play &quot;ork ball&quot; nearly every Sunday afternoon.  <br/>
They play for most of three hours, and play HARD, and some get hurt, and they <br/>
get grumpy and they make up and they re-tell their stories, congratulate each <br/>
other profusely, and though it would be easier to stay home and watch a <br/>
movie, they CHOSE to do what&#39;s hard, as play.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Then he wanted to enter tournaments and I watched this skinny little<br/>
<br/>
8 year old waltz into a store like he owned the place, walk up to 17 year<br/>
<br/>
old strangers and have a conversation with them and either play a game or<br/>
<br/>
trade cards like he was doing it all his life. I was quite impressed. For<br/>
<br/>
him, it was all play.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has been one of those 17 year olds little kids come up to to play <br/>
Yu-Gi-Oh, or Pokemon, and he&#39;s been one of the guys that both kids and adults come <br/>
up to when registering for Magic tournaments, Lord of the Rings card games, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
People pay big bucks to play those games!  They have the same gaming value as <br/>
chess, they involve &quot;story line&quot; (literary factors galore), art (if you <br/>
haven&#39;t looked at collectible cards, DO!), tons of math, sometimes real-world <br/>
history, often battle tactics (even though just talk, but even in the real military <br/>
the tacticians are often &quot;just talking&quot; while others are doing the moving and <br/>
doing)...   Big deal.  Much work and money.  Yet play.<br/>

Daily practice of what?<br/>
Reading?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeeaaaahhhhh....but it&#39;s bad to do that? Here&#39;s what it looks like:<br/>
<br/>
I grab one of our short little readers. I say, &quot;Andrew, want to come sit<br/>
with me and read for a few minutes? You could do that since you don&#39;t<br/>
want to watch Barney and brother and sister do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay mom&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And we read the book. I help him where he needs it and then he does a<br/>
final re-read. That&#39;s it. No more workbooks or painful phonics lessons.<br/>
He isn&#39;t bothered by it and we get to &quot;check off reading&quot; for Dad, who<br/>
isn&#39;t all that interested in this experiment of mine but who tolerates it<br/>
as long as he knows I&#39;m at least trying to let reading and math fall into<br/>
thier path to stumble over daily. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been waiting for them to learn about money.  So yesterday I put out<br/>
a toy catalog for them to find and they asked how much something cost. I<br/>
showed them where the price near the description was. They asked about<br/>
dollars and cents so we talked all about that.  I got out the play money<br/>
and equivelent flash cards and they learned about that. I wrote it down<br/>
as math and they had something to show dad when he came home. <br/>
<br/>
If they hadn&#39;t asked about cost, and just wanted to look at the toys, it<br/>
would have been fine. I would have though looked for another place to<br/>
&quot;drop&quot; math into thier path. If he hadn&#39;t wanted to sit and read, I would<br/>
have written post-it notes around the house or something, for him to<br/>
find, and get practice that way.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s wrong? Please explain. Tia in Fl<br/>

Sorry bout that.  ;-) They&#39;ll mature on their own timetable, maybe not in the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267817695">Hi, just an intro first - I&#39;m Sharon in South Africa.  I run a small<br/>
&quot;school&quot; which is basically unschooling (I can explain more about that in a<br/>
separate post later) but felt compelled to answer Tia.  My son is 12.  He<br/>
spent his day  (in fact has spent the whole week) at a computer workshop run<br/>
by a local training company, aimed mostly at high school students.  He is<br/>
computer crazy and begged to go on it.   Today he was learning about Flash.<br/>
He has these fat manuals that he studies avidly.  He came home to find me<br/>
unpacking toys that I am going to be selling and spent about two years<br/>
playing with a doll&#39;s house with his ten year old brother.  Then he took out<br/>
a set of coloured shape tiles (the type they use in pre-schools) and happily<br/>
made patterns for ages - then he got the digital camera and said &quot;cool - I<br/>
can get some neat angles - and then I&#39;ll animate it tomorrow&quot;.    What was<br/>
playing and what was &quot;working&quot;? - I don&#39;t know.  Children are doing<br/>
something very important internally when they are &quot;just playing&quot; - the<br/>
thought occured to me that it&#39;s hidden because it is so important - If we<br/>
could see what was happening we adults would try to muck with it ...<br/>
(hope that was gentle enough!)<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; I got out the play money&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why didn&#39;t you get out real money?<br/>
<br/>
Play money is one of the most amusing thing on earth.  Fifty plastic pennies <br/>
for $4.95.   VERY very funny.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If they hadn&#39;t asked about cost, and just wanted to look at the toys, it<br/>
would have been fine. I would have though looked for another place to<br/>
&quot;drop&quot; math into thier path.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you take them to the grocery store with you?  Do you ever go out for <br/>
ice cream?  Do they get an allowance?  Have you ever ordered pizza and given the <br/>
delivery guy a tip?<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re not old enough to understand prices at a restaurant or tips, then <br/>
they&#39;re also not old enough to need to know.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If he hadn&#39;t wanted to sit and read, I would<br/>
have written post-it notes around the house or something, for him to<br/>
find, and get practice that way.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
DOES he want to sit and read?<br/>
Does he want to because you&#39;re doing it to placate his dad?<br/>
That&#39;s not quite an honest desire of his own.<br/>
<br/>
I want to do what others need and I want to placate people too.  I just try <br/>
to keep it separate from learning, because if you show him that you don&#39;t trust <br/>
natural learning, he won&#39;t trust it either.  And if he learns to read (in <br/>
your opinion or his or his dad&#39;s) because of your daily sessions, he will think <br/>
he needs daily sessions of other things, later.<br/>
<br/>
If he learns to read on his own and he knows it, and you know it, he won&#39;t <br/>
worry about anything else for the rest of his life.  Not much is harder than a <br/>
young person figuring out how to read on his own.<br/>
<br/>
If you take that away, unschooling will be harder for all of you.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;wrong,&quot; it&#39;s just not optimal, and you&#39;re trying to move forward <br/>
with the brakes on.<br/>

And what I&#39;ve seen is wonderful. WONDERFUL. They still play that way - <br/>
in fun natural flowing ways - at 12, 16, and 18. The games become more <br/>
sophisticated in many ways - lots of things the older kids do would <br/>

<br/>
Why didn&#39;t you get out real money?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago, I bought a play cash register for my dd.  I thought it was cool bc it had great big buttons on the front and also was a solar calculator.  What kid couldn&#39;t have fun with a real working calculator of her very own?<br/>
<br/>
Well, we were at my brother&#39;s for holidays when she opened it.  Right away she wanted to &quot;sell&quot; us things.  She would give people the play money so we could use it to &quot;buy&quot; stuff.  At the time she knew that money buys stuff, but didn&#39;t understand the arithmetic yet, and would just give us any combination of money for change.  That was fine with me.  It was her toy and I didn&#39;t buy it to teach her anything, I just thought she would like it.  My brother started turning it into a lesson in arithmetic.  She responded by refusing to sell anything else.  Instead, she played at giving all of us stuff.  I was impressed by her brilliance at avoiding his lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Now she gets real lessons in spending real money and once in awhile will even choose to not spend it.  She still plays with her cash register/calculator too though.  I guess I was right about it being something she would like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652441374">&lt;&lt;Yeeaaaahhhhh....but it&#39;s bad to do that? Here&#39;s what it looks like:<br/>
<br/>
I grab one of our short little readers. I say, &quot;Andrew, want to come sit<br/>
with me and read for a few minutes? You could do that since you don&#39;t<br/>
want to watch Barney and brother and sister do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay mom&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I never invite Jayn to come and read. I do my own reading when I can<br/>
snatch a few minutes, and she asks me to read to her when she wants to<br/>
read. Or she asks me to put one of her games into the computer for her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to sound harsh, but that whole conversation seems contrived.<br/>
Just because he didn&#39;t care for Barney (and I don&#39;t blame him for that)<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that he didn&#39;t have some other activity in mind for<br/>
himself. Does he have the freedom to say &quot;Not right now&quot; (one of Jayn&#39;s<br/>
favorite phrases) and go about his business? Do you perceive doing<br/>
nothing in particular as vegetative idleness, or as someone involved<br/>
with their own important thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And we read the book. I help him where he needs it and then he does a<br/>
final re-read. That&#39;s it. No more workbooks or painful phonics lessons.<br/>
He isn&#39;t bothered by it and we get to &quot;check off reading&quot; for Dad, who<br/>
isn&#39;t all that interested in this experiment of mine but who tolerates<br/>
it<br/>
as long as he knows I&#39;m at least trying to let reading and math fall<br/>
into<br/>
thier path to stumble over daily.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of threads in the archives and message boards about<br/>
reluctant spouses. How would you feel if you husband had a list of<br/>
particular housework tasks you had to accomplish and you had to check<br/>
them off each day? What happens when you don&#39;t get through the<br/>
designated tasks? I feel that any practice that sets up (1) one parent<br/>
as an authority that must be deferred to rather than a partner, (2) you<br/>
having to manipulate the information that your husband is getting about<br/>
the children&#39;s day, is a dangerous practice and contrary to the living<br/>
in freedom life of joy that Unschooling can be. Gee I hope you can help<br/>
your husband around. James, my dh, had a great time at the conference,<br/>
and met a spectrum of fathers along the path to acceptance. We also<br/>
found out just how much more he gets it than I realized about him<br/>
anyway. <br/>
<br/>
What you have been doing doesn&#39;t sound like the benign &quot;strewing&quot; you<br/>
seem to desire it to be. It seems more active and always with ulterior<br/>
motives. Gosh that sounds sinister. Lots of threads about strewing in<br/>
the archives also.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I never assume that Jayn is feeling a certain way or is &quot;not<br/>
bothered&quot; about something, unless I ask her specifically and in a<br/>
non-leading way. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been waiting for them to learn about money.  So yesterday I put<br/>
out<br/>
a toy catalog for them to find and they asked how much something cost. I<br/>
showed them where the price near the description was. They asked about<br/>
dollars and cents so we talked all about that.  I got out the play money<br/>
and equivelent flash cards and they learned about that. I wrote it down<br/>
as math and they had something to show dad when he came home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You lost faith - some kind of mental timetable you are still holding on<br/>
to made you lose patience with the process, so you had to take action.<br/>
Jayn calls the toy catalogues that come her &quot;magazines&quot;. I don&#39;t even<br/>
look at them, just pass them to her. She gets so excited by new things,<br/>
and sometimes is disgusted when all they do is repeat the items in the<br/>
last catalogue. She sometimes asks about prices. Sometimes I have to<br/>
tell her things are too expensive for us to afford right now.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If they hadn&#39;t asked about cost, and just wanted to look at the toys,<br/>
it<br/>
would have been fine. I would have though looked for another place to<br/>
&quot;drop&quot; math into thier path. If he hadn&#39;t wanted to sit and read, I<br/>
would<br/>
have written post-it notes around the house or something, for him to<br/>
find, and get practice that way.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s wrong? Please explain.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not wrong, so much as not Unschooling. It is still your need to<br/>
look like something got done, your priorities, your either conscious or<br/>
unconscious need to keep up and take responsibility for their EDUCATION<br/>
and PROGRESS, instead of allowing them to be responsible for their own<br/>
learning.  It is still separating &quot;life&quot; from &quot;educational activities&quot;,<br/>
with the attendant belief that educational activities are &quot;better&quot; than<br/>
the others, and that a day without (insert subject here) is an<br/>
incomplete day. If it is easier for you, try imagining that every thing<br/>
is educational. Personally I like to think that nothing has to be. <br/>
<br/>
The real problem is what you and your children are missing out on with<br/>
all this &quot;dropping of math into their path&quot; - which is the excitement<br/>
and joy of spontaneously finding the math both on and off the path and<br/>
running to show you what they found; the fulfillment of choosing and<br/>
knowing it is a real choice to read/do something - how do you know that<br/>
your son was not on the point of making a request to you to do some<br/>
reading? You don&#39;t have to &quot;practice&quot; reading - you just read stuff that<br/>
is interesting to you; you don&#39;t have to &quot;practice&quot; math if you have<br/>
real internal reasons for doing it. Jayn sometimes gets a bug about<br/>
measuring stuff with her little retractable measuring tape. Why? I don&#39;t<br/>
know, but her reasons are as serious to her.<br/>

Leave it in their toy box. One of the big stumbling blocks that some<br/>
people have found, to judge by postings to the list, is the idea that<br/>
they don&#39;t want to waste the money they already spent on curriculum or<br/>
other educational materials (esp. husbands ;) ). Others have found that<br/>
by just leaving the stuff available, it gets used in ways imaginatively<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be unhappy that you have avoided a &quot;lesson&quot; in math - rejoice that<br/>
you are living life instead. You won&#39;t get any kudos here by keeping the<br/>
idea that activities have to be seen as lessons just because the people<br/>
involved are children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He wants to be on equal footing with his peers, all of whom can read<br/>
well. He&#39;d like to get rid of the icky feeling when he says, &quot;I&#39;m just<br/>
not good at books I guess&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I feel so sorry for him feeling himself less than others. This is such a<br/>
&quot;school damage&quot; type of statement. I wonder if it would help him to hear<br/>
stories about other Unschoolers who have been later readers, but are now<br/>
reading fine. Where is he getting this sweeping generalization about<br/>
books? If Jayn started saying negative things about herself, I would<br/>
have a look at her companions, and hang around nearby to eavesdrop<br/>
without shame on their conversations. Jayn is almost 4.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He&#39;d like to be able to use his measure tape,<br/>
get his building materials at Home Depot, and pay for the stuff. He&#39;s<br/>
motivated to be independant and has realized that reading is necessary.<br/>
He is *not* wanting to sit and write for longer than one sentence or<br/>

from a reading curriculum. He wants it with as little effort as possible<br/>
and I&#39;m trying to help him acheive that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I like to do things with as little effort as possible too. The choices<br/>
are not between the extremes of workbooks and curriculum, and no help at<br/>
all, as I think you know.<br/>
It occurs to me that he may not be aware of the extent of his own<br/>
reading if he sees &quot;real&quot; reading ability as only books or worksheets as<br/>
compared to instructions for building projects, product labels and<br/>
catalogues. Some other parents on the list have found it salutary to<br/>
point out to their doubting kids when they are successfully reading.<br/>
Jayn always asks the cashier at the store, &quot;How much is that?&quot; and<br/>
enjoys handing them the credit card, and receiving the receipt. She is<br/>
very disappointed that she is not allowed to do the signing.<br/>

If you go when the store&#39;s not busy and make a leisurely trip, a store can be <br/>
as good as a museum.   I used to put two kids in one cart and one in the <br/>
other, and we&#39;d look at lots of things, and talk about where they came from or <br/>
whatever came up naturally.   We had a good time at the store.  My oldest was <br/>
five when the youngest was born, so I had three little ones for a long time.   <br/>
<br/>
I never treated going to the store as a math lesson, but they did learn a <br/>
lot, and discussions about why things are sorted/arranged as they are in the <br/>
store is fun too.  Categories!  Advertising strategies.   Patterns/colors/sizes.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  He&#39;d like to get rid of the icky feeling when he says, &quot;I&#39;m just<br/>
not good at books I guess&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once you know some people who aren&#39;t comparing and racing, it will help.   <br/>
<br/>
You could say &quot;You will be someday.  There&#39;s no hurry.  People learn things <br/>
at different times and in different ways.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids read &quot;late&quot; in a way (because I didn&#39;t say &quot;reading&quot; until they were <br/>
reading REAL things, not baby-readers, not doing phonics pages, which school <br/>
calls reading but it isn&#39;t, really).   But if one expressed concern, I&#39;d ask <br/>
who they were thinking of (it was always one specific kid or another) and would <br/>
point out what they could do better than that child, and that there could come <br/>
a time when the other child would surpass them there.<br/>
<br/>
They all read perfectly well.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby didn&#39;t know the word &quot;polygamy&quot; when he glanced over at an article <br/>
about the northern Arizona fundamentalist Mormon town that&#39;s been in the news.  He <br/>
said &quot;What&#39;s poly...gram?&quot;  Keith and I looked at each other and shrugged.  <br/>
Keith started saying &quot;something written in several ways?&quot;  kinda guessing by <br/>
root meanings, and I said &quot;Spell it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We talked about &quot;polygamy&quot; just briefly and said when it&#39;s not religion based <br/>
or culture based, it&#39;s &quot;multiple marriage,&quot; and he&#39;s known people in multiple <br/>
marriages.  It wasn&#39;t news to him, just the word itself was new.<br/>
<br/>
That happens a lot with my kids.  Their understanding of the concepts and <br/>
ideas is way beyond their reading.  Their aural (heard and understood) vocabulary <br/>
is larger than their visual vocabulary, so they have an easy time recognizing <br/>
words and sounding words out.  They KNOW the words.   In school it&#39;s often <br/>
the other way.  Kids are sounding out words they&#39;ve never had cause to hear <br/>
before, so they waste a lot of time looking things up and writing down and trying <br/>
to memorize definitions.  If they learned more language before they tried to <br/>
read, reading would be EASY.  And more useful and more sensible.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t already seen this collection of accounts of kids learning to <br/>
read naturally, here:<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;He is *not* wanting to sit and write for longer than one sentence or work<br/>
from a reading curriculum. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good for him.  It&#39;s stupid.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He wants it with as little effort as possible<br/>
and I&#39;m trying to help him acheive that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let it go entirely.  Get him magazines about things he really likes.  Buy him <br/>
CDs.  He&#39;ll read the liner notes and lyrics eventually.  Forward good <br/>
websites to him.  Even if he just looks at the pictures at first, he&#39;ll pick up a <br/>
word here and there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072370025">&lt;&lt;If you go when the store&#39;s not busy and make a leisurely trip, a store<br/>
can be <br/>
as good as a museum.   I used to put two kids in one cart and one in the<br/>
<br/>
other, and we&#39;d look at lots of things, and talk about where they came<br/>
from or <br/>
whatever came up naturally.   We had a good time at the store.  My<br/>
oldest was <br/>
five when the youngest was born, so I had three little ones for a long<br/>
time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so pleased that my local store has just got in some of those<br/>
wonderful carts that are made like cars. Jayn is not so interested in<br/>
&quot;driving&quot; them anymore, but the actual seat part is so much bigger and<br/>
more comfortable than the seat part in regular shopping carts. <br/>
<br/>
We just got back from a trip to the store actually (10pm) and it was<br/>
pretty nice and sparsely populated. We played a follow the leader game<br/>
that I don&#39;t usually have time for. Jayn has a number of friends amongst<br/>
the cashiers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541844737">&lt;&lt;Yeeaaaahhhhh....but it&#39;s bad to do that? Here&#39;s what it looks like:<br/>
<br/>
I grab one of our short little readers. I say, &quot;Andrew, want to come sit<br/>
with me and read for a few minutes? You could do that since you don&#39;t<br/>
want to watch Barney and brother and sister do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay mom&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never invite Jayn to come and read. I do my own reading when I can<br/>
snatch a few minutes, and she asks me to read to her when she wants to<br/>
read. Or she asks me to put one of her games into the computer for her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to sound harsh, but that whole conversation seems contrived.<br/>
Just because he didn&#39;t care for Barney (and I don&#39;t blame him for that)<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that he didn&#39;t have some other activity in mind for<br/>
himself. Does he have the freedom to say &quot;Not right now&quot; (one of Jayn&#39;s<br/>
favorite phrases) and go about his business? Do you perceive doing<br/>
nothing in particular as vegetative idleness, or as someone involved<br/>
with their own important thoughts?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it was contrived, it&#39;s probably because I left off the whine fest that<br/>
came right before it about how mad he was that other people were using<br/>
the TV and how he had nothing to do. My offer to listen to him read is<br/>
something he enjoyes because it&#39;s rare one on one time with me.  He had<br/>
no activity in mind for himself; yes, he has the freedom to say no, and I<br/>
have every respect for what &quot;apparent idleness&quot; can really mean...and I<br/>
try not to interfere. In fact, I started this thread  because my kids<br/>
spend so *much* time in apparent idleness and child play that I was<br/>
wondering if it was normal.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How would you feel if you husband had a list of<br/>
particular housework tasks you had to accomplish and you had to check<br/>
them off each day? What happens when you don&#39;t get through the<br/>
designated tasks? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hee hee, I don&#39;t go there ;-). He doesn&#39;t have an acutal list, but he<br/>
does have concerns that his kids get everything in childhood they need,<br/>
which to him is a good, empowering education. Most all of his<br/>
childrearing info comes through me, as he doesn&#39;t have time to sift<br/>
through books, websites, lists, conversations to weigh pros and cons. He<br/>
trusts alot to me but really, honestly he feels alot better about things<br/>
if I can say, &quot;yes we read today&quot;. It bothers his son that he can&#39;t read<br/>
what he wants to; as a father, he&#39;s bothered his son is bothered, and is<br/>
motivated to allivate that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What you have been doing doesn&#39;t sound like the benign &quot;strewing&quot; you<br/>
seem to desire it to be. It seems more active and always with ulterior<br/>
motives. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;s the line between coersive strewing and creating a helpful<br/>
environment? I&#39;m putting things in their path, offereing them options on<br/>
how to spend thier time, that may catch thier interest or it may not. I&#39;m<br/>
not making them do anything they don&#39;t want to, and if my &quot;bait&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>
catch, I move onto something else or leave them alone for awhile. I have<br/>
plenty enough to do in a day...it&#39;s not like I&#39;m waiting around with a<br/>
&quot;teachign trap&quot; read to ensare the little guys....But I want them to<br/>
easily find things to be curious about and get answers.  I&#39;m not seeing<br/>
what&#39;s wrong with that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885714288">Sounds good to me, Tia.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m MORE direct with my youngest daughter - the poster child for <br/>
unschooling that she is. If something occurs to me that I think she <br/>
might be interested in - I just ask her straight out. No &quot;strewing&quot; - <br/>
even that is sort of devious and artificial, in a way - although a huge <br/>
step forward and a good thing for those who need to learn to create a <br/>
rich stimulating interesting unschooling environment and who need still <br/>
to figure out what does turn their kids on and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - I have no schoolishness left in me anymore and she never had any. <br/>
She knows I&#39;m just asking because it occurred to me she might be <br/>
interested and that I might have something to offer in that direction.  <br/>
I&#39;m not unschooling with the hope that she&#39;ll &quot;cover&quot; what she is <br/>
&quot;supposed to cover&quot; this year. I don&#39;t have some specific &quot;material&quot; in <br/>
mind. I&#39;m just honestly thinking this is something she&#39;d enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s interested in lots of things - in fact, you never know what she <br/>
might be interested in, so I ask.<br/>
<br/>
I ask her if she&#39;s interested in going to an art museum or a space <br/>
shuttle simulation activity, for example. Or - if she wants me to help <br/>
her find books about horse anatomy. Or if she wants to learn how to sew <br/>
or make a pie. I might say, &quot;Is that something you want to learn more <br/>
about?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t overload her - I don&#39;t worry if she&#39;s doing enough. I don&#39;t <br/>
&quot;assess&quot; her. I just enjoy her.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky younger kids whose older siblings have already been the guinea <br/>
pigs and whose now-older parents are calm and confident, huh?<br/>
