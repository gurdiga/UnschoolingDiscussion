I  really love the headphone idea! I hope DH will go for  that<br/>
<br/>

They have wireless headphones now, that would make it easy for him to sit  <br/>
anywhere in the room, get up to pee, get up to get the kids a snack, whatever,  <br/>
and still hear his show.  <br/>
 <br/>
If I were buying those for my husband, I&#39;d try to get the kind with  earbuds, <br/>
not necessarily big radio-dj style headphones.  The kinds of  headphones that <br/>
cover your ears are anti-social.  Earbuds at least allow  you to hear what&#39;s <br/>
going on around you.  Maybe he could listen with one  ear, only.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t see anything wrong with wanting to watch a little TV, but it seems  <br/>
to me that he&#39;s shutting you guys out by turning it up so loud.  My dad was  <br/>
losing his hearing a little, and when the grandkids would come over, he&#39;d keep  <br/>
turning up the volume so he could hear over them.  (TV watching is a social  <br/>
activity in our family.)  Pretty soon no one could say a word and be heard  and <br/>
the TV was blaring as loud as it could go.  Eventually everyone would  leave <br/>
and he&#39;d be surprised about it.  He thought we were all sitting  watching and <br/>
enjoying TV with him.  Somehow he got the idea to use the  captioning and <br/>
that&#39;s helped.  For awhile there, it seemed like he *wanted*  them to leave (I was <br/>
rarely there, then, because I lived far away).  <br/>
 <br/>
I do wonder sometimes if it was intentional.  I think in your  husband&#39;s <br/>
case, it might not be intentionally shutting the kids out, but more  about not <br/>
thinking clearly.  He&#39;s tired after a day&#39;s work and he&#39;s coming  home to noise <br/>
that he can&#39;t control and he&#39;s having trouble seeing the joy in  his kids.  So <br/>
maybe he zones out with the TV because he can&#39;t think of  anything else to do. <br/>
 I&#39;d certainly have a talk with him about it, find out  what his needs are <br/>
and how he&#39;s feeling at the end of the day.  Don&#39;t  assume you know how he&#39;s <br/>
feeling.  Maybe just adjusting something simple  earlier in your day could change <br/>
the flavor of the house when he gets home, and  that could make all the <br/>
difference.  Or just knowing that he&#39;s heard and  understood could change his <br/>
attitude.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d have this conversation before I bought wireless headphones, for sure,  <br/>
because that could be a happy solution to a productive and peaceful  <br/>
problem-solving session.  The headphones might turn out to be  irrelavent.<br/>
