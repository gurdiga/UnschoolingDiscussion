&lt;&lt; My grandparents tell a similar story about my Mom.  For her Yellow was <br/>
Lellow, but if you said Lel-low to her she would shout....Not Lellow, Momma, <br/>
LEL-LOW! like you were a complete idiot.  I can just imagine.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Hello from a longtime lurker. I have been enjoying this<br/>
thread immensely. Seems like every post reminds me of<br/>
a funny story about my own kids which I&#39;d forgotten.<br/>
This one in particular--I&#39;m laughing out loud remembering<br/>
one of my favorite word-moments from when my oldest,<br/>
now 8 yrs, was 2. She had leukemia (all better now, hooray)<br/>
and we had many long stints in the hospital. Her word for<br/>
hospital was &quot;hoffa.&quot; Once I was buckling her into her<br/>
carseat and said, &quot;All right, off we go to the hoffa,&quot;<br/>
and she looked at me with fierce indignation and said,<br/>
&quot;NO, Mommy, ME say hoffa. YOU say--&quot; and here she<br/>
paused, working her mouth to try to get the word out<br/>
right--&quot;hoffa-BULL!&quot;<br/>
<br/>

by our 2 yr old neighbor, as in: &quot;Hi, Saucy! I come play!&quot;)</div>
