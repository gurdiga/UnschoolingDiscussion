&gt;<br/>
&gt;And now we have Dubya, PhD from the U of Quayle, who wants to be our<br/>
&gt;education president.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lynda<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;===========<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;THE WIT & WISDOM OF GEORGE W. BUSH, All Quotes 100% Real:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Laura & I really don&#39;t realize how bright our children is.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I think we can agree. The past is over&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I have learned from mistakes I may or may not have made.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It was just inebriating what Midland was all about then.&quot; [An alky&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Freudian slip for Exhilerating]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It&#39;s clearly the budget. It has a lot of numbers on it.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;The most important job is not to be governor, or first lady in my case.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Will the highways on the Internet become more few?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I was raised in the West. The west of Texas. It&#39;s pretty close to<br/>
&gt;California. In more ways than Washington, D.C., is close to California.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;This is Preservation Month. I appreciate preservation. It&#39;s what you do<br/>
&gt;when you run for president. You gotta preserve.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It&#39;s evolutionary, going from governor to president, and this is a<br/>
&gt;significant step, to be able to vote for yourself on the ballot, and I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;be able to do so next fall, I hope.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I propose that every city have a telephone number 119 -- for dyslexics who<br/>
&gt;have an emergency.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;There ought to be limits to freedom.&quot; [said in support of his handlers&#39;<br/>
&gt;legal efforts to shut down parody websites]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t -- I swear I didn&#39;t -- get into politics to feather my nest.&quot;<br/>
&gt;But: &quot;When it is all said and done, I will have made more money than I ever<br/>
&gt;dreamed I would make.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;The Clinton administration has done practically nothing to protect our<br/>
&gt;country. They&#39;ve turned our country into a rodeo clown.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;You know, hopefully, condoms will work, but it hasn&#39;t worked.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I understand small business growth. I was one.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not the governor&#39;s role to decide who goes to heaven. I believe that<br/>
&gt;God decides who goes to heaven, not George W. Bush.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot; You can&#39;t take the high horse and then claim the low road.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re sick & tired of the politics of cynicism and polls and<br/>
&gt;principles, come and join this campaign.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot; We ought to make the pie higher.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;[during a 2/15/00 speech where he appeared to have had a 3 martini lunch]<br/>
&gt;&quot;I know how proud I am to be standing up.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t kill me!&quot; [Bush on Larry King Show making light of the then-119 men<br/>
&gt;executed in Texas under his governorship]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I pontificate less, although it may be hard to tell.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;If the East Timorians decide to revolt, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have a statement.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I&#39;m a uniter not a divider. That means when it comes time to sew up your<br/>
&gt;chest cavity, we use stitches as opposed to opening it up.&quot;  [said on<br/>
&gt;Letterman; audience booed]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;This is still a dangerous world. It&#39;s a world of madmen and uncertainty<br/>
&gt;and potential mential losses.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;The important question is, How many hands have I shaked?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only thing I know about Slovakia is what I learned first-hand from your<br/>
&gt;foreign minister, who came to Texas.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Reading is the basis for all learning.&quot; Then lying big-time: &quot;I read books<br/>
&gt;all the time.&quot; While promoting a Texas state-wide reading initiative, Bush<br/>
&gt;searched unsuccessfully for an answer to a child&#39;s query regarding any book<br/>
&gt;he may actually have read; Bush finally replied, &quot;uh...uh...Willie Mays.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Due to several similar moments when he could not give evidence of any book<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s ever read, it has become clear that Bush may never have read any book<br/>
&gt;clear through in his whole life, probably not even his ghost-written<br/>
&gt;egregiously bad autobiography, so he now claims to have read only the Bible<br/>
&gt;clear through &quot;once every two years&quot;. An &quot;education president&quot; in the<br/>
&gt;making, right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;We require that every child read by the third grade.&quot; [Texas is<br/>
&gt;academically on the low end of the scale; & other states do tend to produce<br/>
&gt;first-grade readers]<br/>
