<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402873103">anyone ever hear of this book? It is featured in Reader&#39;s Digest this <br/>
month (June issue) about a child who has been labelled as Learning <br/>
Disabled, who found herself in ice skating, when she was (???) five I <br/>
think. Quite young, at any rate.<br/>
<br/>
I found it an intriguing story, how the poor mother saw the <br/>
difficulty the little girl had sitting still and listening in her <br/>
(get this) second year in NURSERY SCHOOL????? gag By the time this <br/>
poor kid was five, she had been rejected by every kindergarten, <br/>
special ed school, and some of them because she wasn&#39;t disabled <br/>
ENOUGH (i.e. no physical probs, no obvious mental/intelligence probs. <br/>
Just inability to learn what was appropriate from what wasn&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>
And then a friend of her mom&#39;s says &quot;Take her ice skating&quot; and the <br/>
kid blossoms. the website shows a confident and beautiful teenaged <br/>
girl wearing jeans and a jacket, holding skates in her hand. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
anyway. I&#39;d love to know how the story ends. Guess I better hie me <br/>
off to the library.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577004994">My grandmother was just telling me about this story this morning.  She said <br/>
the girl was mildly retarded and her mom noticed that her daughter would <br/>
stop dead in her tracks when she saw someone ice skating.  She&#39;s old &lt;g&gt; so <br/>
maybe she read it wrong! LOL  Anyway, either way, it sounded like a <br/>
beautiful story!<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the website addy???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071589533">One of her doctors diagnosed mild retardation, but later she got a <br/>
diagnosis of learning disabled, accdg to the Reader&#39;s Digest article.<br/>
<br/>
the website URL is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.laughingallegra.com">http://www.laughingallegra.com</a> at &quot;allegra&#39;s page&quot; <br/>
you can find a pic of her, looking happy and very pretty, holding <br/>
skates in her hand.<br/>
<br/>
I really want to read the whole book, but can&#39;t buy it new, and our <br/>
library doesn&#39;t get new release books until they&#39;ve been out for <br/>
quite some time. Maybe the library in the bigger town has it.<br/>
