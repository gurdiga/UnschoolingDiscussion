&lt;&lt; Do people on this list feel they always must<br/>
address parents as if they are the sicko types? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is rhetorically equivalent to &quot;Are you still beating your wife?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any answer to &quot;Do people on this list feel they always must<br/>
address parents as if they are the sicko types?&quot; would be like a confession <br/>
of something that it seems YOU created as a defense of a statement you made <br/>
carelessly and would like to get out of without actually saying &quot;I didn&#39;t <br/>
mean that sorry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When someone suggests they think spanking is good, or that they don&#39;t care <br/>
what their children think, or that they don&#39;t feel responsible for their <br/>
children&#39;s happiness (just to use a little batch of recent examples), then <br/>
people respond as though they believe someone thinks spanking is good, or <br/>
that someone has said in public that she doesn&#39;t care what her children <br/>
think, or that someone has typed very plainly that she&#39;s not responsible for <br/>
her children&#39;s happiness.<br/>
<br/>
If people on this list are unwilling to share, the list is a waste of light <br/>
and electricity.  <br/>
