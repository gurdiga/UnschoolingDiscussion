<div id="ygrps-yiv-597020423">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the resources.  I&#39;m gradually becoming an &quot;unschooling<br/>
leader&quot; in this community.  I guess what is really happening is folks<br/>
are starting to notice more where their child is at and not be as afraid<br/>
to veer from their curriculum.   I think what schooling our children is<br/>
all about is just an extension of parenting and noticing what our<br/>
children want to find out and facilitating it.<br/>
<br/>
My son, who will be 7 the end of May has never had &quot;reading lessons&quot;.<br/>
However, on his own he does a lot of things that they try and drill<br/>
children on or have repetitive workbook sheets.  The other day he came<br/>
up to me and said, &quot;Harry Potter is 4 words.&quot;  I paused a second, &quot;Oh<br/>
your right, it does sound like Harry Potter is 4 words that&#39;s because it<br/>
is 4 syllables.&quot;  Now he&#39;s noticing the syllable in words and pointing<br/>
it out.  One of my friends had worksheets where the child had to divide<br/>
the syllables at the double consents.  It was a whole page of them,<br/>
why?  I think when the brain is ready it will start noticing and reading<br/>
will naturally occur.  I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not using a curriculum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941415897">I have been taking my kids (ages 8, 6 & 4) to a science class each week.  The<br/>
teacher is wonderful!!  I especially love how no one is ever wrong!  She<br/>
finds a way to make each statement or offered answer &quot;right&quot;.  She is<br/>
exceptionally good at it, and I know from trying that is is very hard!  What<br/>
an interesting point this is...<br/>

Hugs to Karen.    My oldest (born in &#39;79)  seems to have finally moved past this<br/>
particular part of his personality.<br/>
But I definitely remember wondering about the ways language seem to process for<br/>
different folks.<br/>
BTW,   I seem to remember thinking his view of the answer &quot;yes, later&quot; meaning<br/>
&quot;no, never, not in your lifetime&quot;  went on to include &quot;beyond this lifetime&quot;<br/>
LOL.<br/>
<br/>
This trait of his also carried over to hie view of &quot;practicing&quot;  and &quot;learning&quot;.<br/>
Whether it was sports, speaking English aloud,  writing anything on paper,<br/>
spelling...................if he did not perform perfectly  (in HIS<br/>
perfectionist view)  the very first attempt   then he was sure that  never, ever<br/>
would he be able to achieve whatever task was set before him---by self or<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely makes for a frustrating time both for children and those who love<br/>
them.    Just another instance of no one size fits all!    Keep trying to find<br/>
what works for both of you.........it gets better.<br/>

It&#39;s something I am trying to pay attention to as<br/>

No, they aren&#39;t always happy to wait, but this does at <br/>
least allow discussion about why the cookies need to be <br/>
left for after dinner, or even if they do.  &#39;No&#39; in our <br/>
house tends to generate squabbling and &#39;tantrums.&#39;  <br/>
Sometimes, I can get away with &#39;no, because...&#39;  but <br/>
that&#39;s unusual (though less unusual recently, but only <br/>
because I simply haven&#39;t had the energy to do stuff <br/>
with &#39;em.)<br/>

<br>
<br>If you say &quot;NO&quot; there&#39;s nothing to wait for. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>At my house, they can have cookies when they want to, so it was more a 
<br>theoretical example.
<br>
<br>But about other waiting situations, they&#39;re usually willing to wait.
<br>
<br>If I say &quot;yes&quot; and then don&#39;t deliver, pretty soon they won&#39;t trust me and 
<br>I&#39;ll be in the life-ruining range of &quot;Mom doesn&#39;t do what she says she&#39;ll do&quot; 
<br>and they&#39;ll quit asking. &nbsp;I have to be careful only to say &quot;yes&quot; when I mean 
<br>yes--and to hold myself to my word.
<br>
<br>But when the answer is &quot;later&quot; then it can be worded in a positive way 
<br>instead of a negative one.
