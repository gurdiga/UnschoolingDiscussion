<div id="ygrps-yiv-600137150">We recently got a graduation announcement for my neice, complete with <br/>
beautiful picture, etc.  My daughter who will be going to college in the fall (and <br/>
who chronologially would be a graduate this year, although she &quot;finished&quot; a <br/>
while back) looked a little sad, and asked if we could do something like this for <br/>
her.  <br/>
<br/>
We can swing some nice pictures, but does anyone have frugal ideas for <br/>
announcements...I had thought of something like instead of showing the school <br/>
emblem, maybe some cool statement about the world being her classroom?  Something <br/>
also to the effect that she accomplished it herself, on her terms?  <br/>
<br/>
Any good print programs or sites to help?  I did a search but only came up <br/>
with printing companies with expensive pre-made homeschool designs.  <br/>

Stickers. Go to one of the parent/teacher stores or a scrapbooking store and <br/>
buy little &quot;worlds&quot;----globes and stick them on cards. Put a witty statement <br/>
or quote on at the top and the info below.<br/>

Card stock, vellum, ribbons, all cheap at the paper supply store.  If you <br/>
want clip art, you can find that all over the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
You really wouldn&#39;t need any special printing program I don&#39;t think.  We did <br/>
some very nice Sweet Sixteen invitations for my daughter Cait a few months <br/>
back, and no one could believe they were done at home.<br/>
<br/>
I did use regular sized card stock and printed two invitations/announcements <br/>
on one card and while they could have been cut at home, I just took the stack <br/>
of 100 to the printer and they measured and cut them perfectly for me for 2.50.<br/>
<br/>
If you find a theme with &quot;words&quot; or a theme with a graphic that should get <br/>
you started and you&#39;ll have endless possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I did some announcements for my niece three years ago when she graduated from <br/>
a private Christian school.  We used a Jimmy Buffett graphic and a line from <br/>
one of his songs to sorta intro the announcement.  It was perfect for Kara&#39;s <br/>
personality.<br/>
<br/>
You could do something similar that reflects your daughter and her journey.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
