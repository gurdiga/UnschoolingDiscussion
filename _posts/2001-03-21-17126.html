Teenagers Find Health Answers With a Click<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS<br/>
<br/>
Emily Davison, a 12-year-old seventh grader at the Trinity School in<br/>
Manhattan, used to think she was overweight. Recently, she changed<br/>
her mind. Emily didn&#39;t lose a single pound to change her attitude.<br/>
<br/>
 She went online and consulted iEmily, a new site devoted to<br/>
helping teenage girls - and not just ones named Emily - get answers<br/>
to questions about physical and mental health. After reading<br/>
articles on the site about healthy weight and body image, Emily<br/>
realized she wasn&#39;t fat after all.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;I read some of the articles about how a lot of girls who think<br/>
they&#39;re overweight aren&#39;t. Now I feel more comfortable about my<br/>
weight,&quot; said Emily, who said she visited the site (www.iEmily.com)<br/>
for at least 30 minutes daily to get information about nutrition<br/>
and fitness and to find solace from the stress she says she feels<br/>
at school. A private company, iEmily is based in Boston and carries<br/>
no advertising.<br/>
<br/>
 Emily said that, up to now, she had not had any health education<br/>
at school and, she admits, she has a lot of questions that need<br/>
answering. She said she could ask her mother about &quot;lot of things,&quot;<br/>
but there are some things she is too embarrassed to ask. Emily is<br/>
not unlike thousands of other adolescents, both boys and girls, who<br/>
are turning for answers to their health questions to Web sites<br/>
focused on teenage health and written by medical professionals with<br/>
a view to providing balanced, factual information.<br/>
<br/>
 In addition to the for-girls-only iEmily, the most comprehensive<br/>
of these sites are TeenGrowth (www.teengrowth.com), the Web site<br/>
for the Pediatric Health Alliance, a group practice in Florida; the<br/>
teenager section of KidsHealth site (www.kidshealth.org), which is<br/>
underwritten by the Nemours Foundation; and ZapHealth<br/>
(www.zaphealth.com), a company based in Manhattan, the only site<br/>
among these that carries advertising.<br/>
<br/>
 Organized like interactive magazines, the sites include articles<br/>
on general, sexual and emotional health, as well as fitness,<br/>
sports, family and safety issues, links to resources for more help,<br/>
forums and, on two sites, chat rooms. The sites cover almost every<br/>
health and wellness subject that occupies adolescents, from breast<br/>
and penis size to pimples and dandruff, from crushes and French<br/>
kissing to more serious issues like depression, drug abuse and<br/>
pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
 For teenagers, turning to the Web for health information is<br/>
natural since they are online anyway, playing games, sending e-<br/>
mail and learning, according to a recent survey conducted by<br/>
Jupiter Communications and Media Metrix. That they spend an average<br/>
of 15 minutes per visit to these health sites is no surprise to the<br/>
executives who run them. &quot;It is blatantly obvious that teenagers<br/>
were an ignored population medically speaking,&quot; said Dr. F. Lane<br/>
France, medical adviser to TeenGrowth. <br/>
<br/>
 Teenagers have &quot;an insatiable curiosity about `me,&#39; &quot; said Kate<br/>
Kelly, author of &quot;The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to Parenting a<br/>
Teenager.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Just a few years ago, most teenagers would get the basics in<br/>
health class and the rest of their health information (or<br/>
misinformation) from hurried conversations in school bathrooms.<br/>
Sometimes, they may have even asked their doctors. But, since many<br/>
adolescents still see a pediatrician, who has a relationship with<br/>
the parent, not the patient, asking intimate questions is tricky,<br/>
Ms. Kelly said. For adolescents who wish to satisfy that insatiable<br/>
curiosity, the Web offers something a visit to the doctor&#39;s office<br/>
doesn&#39;t: privacy.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;If you have questions about stuff you can just go on and no one<br/>
knows about it,&quot; said Elizabeth Anderson, 12, a seventh grader in<br/>
Brookline, Mass., and an iEmily visitor. &quot;It&#39;s secret and has lots<br/>
of information.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Articles about issues of pressing interest to a teenage audience<br/>
are abundant. ZapHealth, for instance, offers: &quot;Body Odor, a k a<br/>
B.O.&quot; &quot;Am I Still a Virgin If I Use a Tampon?&quot; is on KidsHealth.<br/>
Features on body piercing and tattoos are included on iEmily. <br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Before I would go to girl magazines, which would have a page<br/>
dedicated to specific questions, but of course these weren&#39;t my<br/>
questions, there were matters that didn&#39;t affect me,&quot; said Bhavi<br/>
Hansoty, 20, a sophomore at Vassar and a frequent visitor to<br/>
ZapHealth.com. She also serves on a panel the site consults when<br/>
developing material.<br/>
<br/>
 Recently, Ms. Hansoty was considering getting her navel pierced.<br/>
After reading the articles on body piercing on the site, she<br/>
consulted the feedback page where she read grueling accounts of the<br/>
pain, inflammation and infection experienced by others with pierced<br/>
belly buttons. Ms. Hansoty decided against the piercing. <br/>
<br/>
 She said the real stories from real people that she found on the<br/>
site persuaded her to change her plans. In fact, the real action on<br/>
these sites happens in the interaction. At ZapHealth and iEmily,<br/>
teenagers can talk to one another, offering advice in chat rooms on<br/>
topics as diverse as curing the frizzies and masturbation as a sin.<br/>
Rina Spence, who founded iEmily, said the site moderated all chats.<br/>
ZapHealth&#39;s chats are unmoderated, said Chelsea Farley, the site&#39;s<br/>
founder. There are no chat rooms on TeenGrowth .com or on<br/>
KidsHealth.org/teen. <br/>
<br/>
 While chatting is like being in a virtual school bathroom,<br/>
bulletin boards and forums on the sites are places where teenagers<br/>
ask their most personal questions and have them answered by medical<br/>
professionals. The questions are then posted, with all identifying<br/>
details removed, for others to consult. Though each Web site urges<br/>
visitors with serious problems to get immediate help from a<br/>
counselor or physician, some teenagers - suicidal, drug-abusing or<br/>
pregnant - send S O S&#39;s to the site anyway. They are immediately<br/>
and privately answered.<br/>
<br/>
 Desperate e-mail messages are rare, though. Mostly, questions for<br/>
the site&#39;s medical professionals are of less urgent, though no less<br/>
pressing, matters. Often, teenagers just want reassurance that they<br/>
are normal.<br/>
<br/>
 And, as the letters come in, the sites continue to stockpile the<br/>
answers and make them available through searchable indexes.<br/>
<br/>
 Carol Weston, who runs the GirlsTalk forum on iEmily and who is an<br/>
author of seven books for teenage girls, has been answering letters<br/>
from teenagers for 15 years. Mostly, the questions she receives<br/>
stay the same from year to year. Her most enduring one: &quot;Does he<br/>
like me?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 When Emily Davison was hurt to discover that a boy she had a crush<br/>
on started going out with her best friend, she consulted iEmily.<br/>
What she found helped a little, she said, but since she still felt<br/>
betrayed, she went to her mother. Talking to her mom, Emily said,<br/>
was the one thing that really helped.<br/>
