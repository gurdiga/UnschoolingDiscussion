<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023074967">&lt;&lt;  I decided I REALLY didn&#39;t want them <br/>
thinking that sex is only for young single beautiful people OR criminal <br/>
deviants, which is the message of most of popular culture.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deborah, you forgot to put in the subject line and those of us not on digest <br/>
can&#39;t follow those secret numbers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help but to have thought of the wild sex that must occasionally be <br/>
generated by young, single, beautiful criminal deviants.  I hope they use <br/>
birth control.<br/>
<br/>
My kids know and they&#39;re really nice about giving us privacy, now that <br/>
they&#39;re old enough to be really nice.   I&#39;m the way you are about not being <br/>
sneaky, yet not saying &quot;I&#39;m going in the back now to have sex for at least a <br/>
half an hour, so picture THAT and don&#39;t come back there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Poor kids!! &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
But sometimes, now that they&#39;re older, they will ALL be gone at the same time <br/>
and we don&#39;t have to tell anybody ANYthing!!<br/>
<br/>
