<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371131214">Considering all the ghost talk, I thought I would<br/>
share what happened here yesterday, though it&#39;s not<br/>
really a ghost story.<br/>
<br/>
Ds came running into the house in a panic after his<br/>
paper route. Turns out there was an ambulance and<br/>
police cars in our side yard and he was worried<br/>
something had happened to me or dd. We didn&#39;t hear<br/>
anything at all! We looked out the window and saw that<br/>
the neighbors (whose house is only the width of a<br/>
driveway from ours) had a stretcher in front of their<br/>
porch. We watched for a while, nosy, you know how it<br/>
is, and started to feel relieved, thinking that they<br/>
must be ok, since the ambulance people weren&#39;t in a<br/>
hurry to bring them out to the stretcher.<br/>
<br/>
But no. Out came a body bag.<br/>
<br/>
Well, ds, who is 10, saw this. His first body bag. MY<br/>
first body bag! The house is a duplex, so we weren&#39;t<br/>
sure if it was the upstairs people, whom we know, or<br/>
the downstairs guy, who owns the house. We called<br/>
another neighbor, who said she, too, had been freaked<br/>
out thinking it was for our house. She said she saw<br/>
the upstairs people looking out the window, so she was<br/>
sure it wasn&#39;t them. So she called them (she has their<br/>
number because they shovel her driveway)and they told<br/>
her it was their landlord downstairs.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a corner store here, and the dead man used to<br/>
go there every day. When he didn&#39;t come in for a few<br/>
days and his car didn&#39;t move, the corner store people<br/>
asked the upstairs people (when they were out walking<br/>
their dog) if they knew what was up. So the upstairs<br/>
people knocked, waited a day, knocked again, and then<br/>
called the police, who, of course, found him dead.<br/>
<br/>
The ghostly part of this story is that dd and I have<br/>
had insomnia all week. Very bad insomnia. And every<br/>
time we&#39;d fall asleep, the cat, who also seemed to<br/>
have insomnia, would come along and yowl us awake,<br/>
which is unusual for him. Ds wasn&#39;t affected, but his<br/>
room is not in that part of the house, and dh was out<br/>
of town. Dd was sleeping with me, as she does when dh<br/>
is out of town, and my bedroom is, like I say, a<br/>
driveway width from his bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
We still don&#39;t know how he died, but a little while<br/>
afterwards, I remembered he had a cat. So I called the<br/>
animal control officer and let him know. He said an<br/>
officer was going back to the house right then, so he<br/>
would look for the cat. A while later, the neighbor<br/>
I&#39;d talked to on the phone called to say a cat was<br/>
carried out, so we stopped worrying about the cat.<br/>
Well, except for thinking about it being locked up in<br/>
the house for a week with its dead/dying person.<br/>
<br/>
Ds had a sleepover last night, so I don&#39;t know yet if<br/>
he had bad dreams or other problems after seeing the<br/>
body bag. But he seemed ok, more disturbed from the<br/>
shock of thinking it was us than from seeing the<br/>
closed body bag of someone he didn&#39;t know. Actually,<br/>
his only contact with the man was when he yelled at ds<br/>
for playing on what&#39;s technically his property, though<br/>
three yards merge there.<br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s my contribution to the ghostliness. Am I<br/>
being melodramatic to think our insomnia and the cat&#39;s<br/>
yowling had to do with this? Juli<br/>

We have a family history of dreams of picking <br/>
blackberries when we know someone who is dying/has <br/>
died.  The bigger and juicier the blackberries, the <br/>
closer the person...  Grandma used to dream this, and <br/>
Mum did when Grandma died...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why would you think so?  We are so out of touch with our hearts and souls and everyone forgets to rely on or trust their intuition.  Instinct is often the most reliable sense in such situations, and I rely on mine.  I believe you, your daughter, and your cat knew something was wrong next door.  Maybe there was a restless energy there from the undiscovered deceased.  Or perhaps it was the poor cat that was emenating nervous and unhappy energy which made you all so antsy.  Perhaps it was merely a sense that something was not right over there.  You can make the best determination, since you were there.  Don&#39;t rely on other people to tell you what to feel.<br/>
