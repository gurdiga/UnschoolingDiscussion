<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834681343">I&#39;ve read mention of other unschooling forums(?)  (e-mail lists?) (not sure <br/>
of proper terms!)  in people&#39;s posts here.  What other forums have people <br/>

AlwaysUnschooled for those unschooling younger kids<br/>
AlwaysLearning for &quot;advanced&quot; unschoolers ;-) It&#39;s more for people who <br/>
already understand unschooling.<br/>
ShineWithUnschooling for unschoolers with kids with special needs<br/>
<br/>
The HEM lists:<br/>
<br/>
HEM-Unschooling<br/>
Unschooling-dotcom<br/>
<br/>
tend to be more &quot;Here&#39;s what works for us&quot; rather than &quot;Here&#39;s what <br/>
unschooling is and here&#39;s what might help you get closer to it&quot; like <br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
The Unschooling list used to have everyone moderated and it would take <br/>
days for replies to get through. And though it was a huge list, it <br/>
wasn&#39;t very active. And their definition of unschooling sounds more <br/>
like relaxed homeschooling to me and that was my experience there years <br/>
ago: &quot;Unschooling is the art of using a child&#39;s natural curiosity to <br/>
guide learning.&quot;<br/>
