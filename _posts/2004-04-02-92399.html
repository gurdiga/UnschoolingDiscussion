<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146971770">I don&#39;t know if any formattingwill remain, but I think this should be printed <br/>
out and put in unschooling bathrooms everywhere.<br/>
The website has a black background, so you might have to lift and reformat if <br/>
you would rather print it from there.  It&#39;s here:<br/>

Reading it aloud would be just as good practice at reading Shakespeare as <br/>
reading real Shakespeare, but this one could be a first for some kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This recently discovered folio edition of &quot;Hamlet&quot; follows other known <br/>
versions closely until Act V, Scene II, where it begins to diverge at line 232, as <br/>
will be seen:<br/>
<br/>
KING            ...`Now the king drinks to Hamlet.&#39; Come, begin,<br/>
                And you the judges, bear a wary eye<br/>
<br/>
Trumpets sound.  HAMLET and LAERTES take their stations<br/>
<br/>
HAMLET:         Come on, sir.<br/>
LAERTES:        Come, my lord.<br/>
<br/>
Enter FRED, DAPHNE, VELMA, SHAGGY, AND SCOOBY<br/>
<br/>
DAPHNE:         Wait!<br/>
SHAGGY:         Stop the fight!<br/>
<br/>
HAMLET and LAERTES put up their foils<br/>
<br/>
KING:           I like this not.  Say wherefore you do speak?<br/>
FRED:           Good lord, I pray thee, let thy anger wait.<br/>
                For we, in seeking clues, have found the truth<br/>
                Behind the strange events of latter days.<br/>
<br/>
VELMA:          The first clue came from Elsinore&#39;s high walls,<br/>
                Where, so said Hamlet, Hamlet&#39;s ghost did walk.<br/>
                Yet though the elder Hamlet met his death,<br/>
                And perforce hath been buried in the ground,<br/>
                &#39;Tis yet true one would not expect a ghost<br/>
                To carry mud upon his spectral boots.<br/>
                Yet mud didst Shaggy and his faithful hound<br/>
                Espy, with footprints leading to a drop.<br/>
                This might, at first, indeed bespeak a ghost...<br/>
                Until, when I did seek for other answers,<br/>
                I found a great, wide cloth of deepest black<br/>
                Discarded in the moat of Elsinore.<br/>
                &#39;Tis clear, the &quot;ghost&quot; used this to slow his fall<br/>
                While darkness rendered him invisible.<br/>
<br/>
FRED:           The second clue we found, my lord, was this.<br/>
<br/>
KING:           It seems to me a portrait of my brother<br/>
                In staine&#39;d glass, that sunlight may shine through.<br/>
<br/>
FRED:           But see, my lord, when placed before a lanternâ€”<br/>
<br/>
KING:           My brother&#39;s ghost!<br/>
<br/>
HAMLET:         My father!<br/>
<br/>
VELMA:          Nay, his image.<br/>
<br/>
FRED:           In sooth, that image caught the Prince&#39;s eye<br/>
                When he went to confront his lady mother.<br/>
                Nor did his sword pierce poor Polonius.<br/>
                For Hamlet&#39;s blade did mark the castle wall<br/>
                Behind the rent made in the tapestry.<br/>
                Polonius was murdered by another.<br/>
                The knife which killed him entered from behind.<br/>
<br/>
LAERTES:        But who?<br/>
<br/>
FRED:           Indeed my lords, that you shall see.<br/>
<br/>
HAMLET:         And if this ghost was naught but light and air,<br/>
                Then what of that which I did touch and speak to?<br/>
<br/>
The GHOST enters.<br/>
<br/>
GHOST:          Indeed, my son.<br/>
<br/>
SHAGGY:         Zoinks!<br/>
<br/>
DAPHNE:         Jenkies!<br/>
<br/>
GHOST:          Mark them not.<br/>
                Thou hast neglected duty far too long.<br/>
                Shall this, my murderer, live on unharmed?<br/>
                Must I remain forever unavenged?<br/>
<br/>
SCOOBY and SHAGGY run away from the GHOST.  SCOOBY, looking backward, runs <br/>
into a tapestry, tearing it down.  As a result, tapestries around the walls <br/>
collapse, one surrounding the GHOST.<br/>
<br/>
GHOST:          What?<br/>
<br/>
FRED:           Good Osric, pray restrain that &quot;ghost&quot;,<br/>
                That we may reach the bottom of the matter.<br/>
                Now let us see who truly walked tonight.<br/>
<br/>
FRED removes the helm and the disguise from the GHOST&#39;S face.<br/>
<br/>
ALL:            Tis Fortinbras!<br/>
<br/>
FRED:           The valiant prince of Norway!<br/>
<br/>
FORTINBRAS:     Indeed it is, and curses on you all!<br/>
                This Hamlet&#39;s father brought my own to death,<br/>
                And cost me all my rightful heritage.<br/>
                And so I killed this king, and hoped his son<br/>
                Would prove no obstacle to Norway&#39;s crown.<br/>
                Then Claudius bethought himself the killer<br/>
                (As if one might be poisoned through the ear!)<br/>
                The brother, not the son, took Denmark&#39;s throne,<br/>
                And held to Norway with a tighter grip.<br/>
                I swore an end to Denmark&#39;s royal house.<br/>
                I spoke to Hamlet of his uncle&#39;s crimes.<br/>
                Then killed Polonius to spark Laertes.<br/>
                This day, with poison&#39;s aid, all might have died,<br/>
                And Denmark might have come to me as well<br/>
                As my beloved Norway and revenge.<br/>
                My scheme blinded them all, as if by fog<br/>
                But for these medd&#39;ling kids and this their dog.<br/>
<br/>
KING:           The villain stands confessed.  Now let us go.<br/>
                For much remains to us to be discussed.<br/>
                And suitable reward must needs be found<br/>
                For these, our young detectives and their hound.<br/>
