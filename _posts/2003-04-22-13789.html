<br/>
An interesting note:<br/>
<br/>
The song Kira wrote for the Mad Hatter&#39;s tea party scene, also the <br/>
show&#39;s theme song, has a rather unschooly chorus! It goes like this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pay no heed to your head.<br/>
Never mind your mind.<br/>
For if you&#39;re overly concerned<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655078610">Well,   I forwarded this onto the Minnesota unschooling list, but I didn&#39;t think there were other close enough people here, besides me and Susan!   I wonder why she has been unable to post?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone want to go?      Susan,  I&#39;m playing with driving on down,  its about 4 hours.   Just trying to figure out the dates.   And where I&#39;m staying and all that.    I think my Kyra would like the play.   As well as the rest of my fam.<br/>
