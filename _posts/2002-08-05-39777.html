&lt;&lt; In fairness to all, I think that because of usage (or evolution, if you<br/>
will), dove has come to be an acceptable (or accepted) form for the past<br/>
tense of dive.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I would like to say &quot;invariably,&quot; but there might be a VERY few exceptions.  <br/>
Almost invariably, when there&#39;s a useage in American English which is not in <br/>
England, it is because it has fallen out of use in England, but WAS standard, <br/>
common English three or four hundred years ago.<br/>

<br/>
American use the past participles &quot;gotten&quot; and &quot;forgotten&quot; in verb forms such <br/>

backpacks.&quot;  In England they don&#39;t.<br/>

I think it&#39;s cool.  Like an antique shop.<br/>
