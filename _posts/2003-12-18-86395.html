<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722453740">I am a former preschool & primary grades special education teacher who is now <br/>
staying at home with my 2 children.  I just wanted to mention that all <br/>
children develop at their own rates and although evaluators <br/>
(teachers,therapists,etc) do their best to put an &quot;age equivalent&quot; on a child&#39;s progress...they are <br/>
comparing to the &quot;average&quot; which means some children are above that age range <br/>
and some below.  <br/>
Early intervention services are certainly helpful if they are well done and <br/>
preferably in your own home so that the parents can learn the techniques used <br/>
as well. <br/>
My son is getting preschool spec ed services this year which seems to be <br/>
helpful so far and has none of the stigma of school-age services.  I&#39;ve just <br/>
recently been really considering hs him and reconsidering my former chosen career.  <br/>
The school system really does a disservice to kids in special ed programs as <br/>
most children do not fit into a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach.<br/>
Best of luck with all of your children.  I do suggest accepting early <br/>
intervention services if they are approved b/c it is the best time to help many <br/>
children with developmental delays...but don&#39;t feel bad about it.  Just spending <br/>
time playing with 2 year olds is what most of the therapy consists of.  Good <br/>
luck.  <br/>
