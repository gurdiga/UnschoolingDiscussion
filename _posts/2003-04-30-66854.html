 </span></blockquote>You should check out the Lunch Bunch Learners.  They are a secular group.  I <br/>
believe unschooling.  I think Greensboro is where they are located.  There <br/>
are a couple of NC lists.  NCSecular and NCLOOP both through yahoo.  You <br/>
could post there for more specifics.  We live in Valdese, near Hickory.  I <br/>
was thinking NCSecular had at least one person from the Lunch Bunch on it.  <br/>
All I know about them is that they do have a play group that meets regularly.<br/>

I&#39;m Tracy and I&#39;m in NC {and I do happen to be non-Christian  - but that&#39;s beside the point &lt;g&gt;} near the Durham area, but my kids are younger {oldest being almost 10}. So your not alone in NC. There are many in the same boat as you are. Which is why we just started a new statewide group in January, that is a bit in contrast to NCHE and we welcome everyone from all walks. No statement of faith to join. We encourage diversity so you may find some homeschoolers around you. {Check out my signature - LOL) <br/>

I was raised Southern Baptist, and we&#39;re atheist or something. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m agnostic. Holly&#39;s atheist.  The boys don&#39;t care.  <br/>
Keith is as Presbyterian as he&#39;s ever been, which means absolutely nothing to <br/>
him.</div>
