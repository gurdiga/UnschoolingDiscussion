 </span></blockquote>Karen, and anyone else with experience with kids with ADD an ADHD<br/>
diagnoses:  We are finally done with our Homestudy and our Case Worker has<br/>
advised us that we should begin networking through whatever resources that<br/>
we have to assist her in our search for a child.  I wanted to put a<br/>
question to you about some of the kids that we have seen in the listings.<br/>
We are looking to adopt a girl from foster care between the ages of 3 and<br/>
9, and we have seen a LOT of ADD or ADHD labeled kids who are being<br/>
&quot;medicated&quot; for that.  What are some opinions about the probability of many<br/>
of these children having been misdiagnosed, medicated without need,<br/>
possibly having emotional issues stemming from foster care or previous<br/>
problems that &quot;look&quot; like ADD symptoms, etc.??  How difficult is it to take<br/>
a child off medication?  How would you assess the true nature of a child&#39;s<br/>
condition, abilities and needs when they are already on medication?  How do<br/>
you approach this issue in a way that is healthy and non-threatening to the<br/>
child?  <br/>
<br/>
We have to be careful about what we do also, as this child will not be<br/>
considered &quot;ours&quot; until the adoption is finalized (possibly up to a year<br/>
after they enter our family) and social workers could attempt to block the<br/>
process if they think we are not doing what is in the &quot;best interests of<br/>
the child.&quot;  We have to make a decision about which children to persue<br/>
based on limited information that is available to the Case Worker, which<br/>
may include an ADD diagnosis and the presence of medication.  We can meet a<br/>
child, talk with Foster Families, etc, but not without investing time and<br/>
money in traveling to the child&#39;s state/area, so we want to be fairly<br/>
certain of the likelihood of a child being a good match for us before that<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
Should I avoid children who are being medicated as a matter of course?<br/>
Would the situation be too sticky to embroil ourselves in if there is<br/>
psychological drugs present?  Anyone have any info to share?  Anyone also<br/>
have any leads or suggestions of areas/agencies for us to check into for kids?<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Nanci,</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I just read your e-mail and I just thought you 
needed a word or two of encouragement and support. (And an hug too!) My son Nick 
sounds a lot like your son Thomas.&nbsp; Nick is 5.5 years old and has extreme 
sensetivities to sound, touch, textures, smell...and it impacts our life in so 
many ways.&nbsp;One of the biggest&nbsp;ways that&nbsp;effects our family is 
that his hypersensitivity causes him to have many more meltdowns than the 
average child his age. I have no pearls of wisdom about how to handle your son 
when he tantrums except to say that I too have been where you are at and the 
best advice I can give you is this time will pass and better moments lay 
ahead.&nbsp; What I find helps me in those very trying moments is to try to 
grasp (this can be very difficult at times!) where your son is coming 
from.&nbsp; Was his day really stressful and stimulating, was he feeling unwell, 
did his sheets itch him...and so on.&nbsp; A book that has really helped us is 
the Out of Sync Child by Carol Kranowitz.&nbsp; If you haven&#39;t read it, it is 
really a great book for kids like ours.&nbsp; Another great resource has been 
the Sensory Integration e-group on One List.&nbsp; I have found many great 
insights and comfort in reading snippets from other people&#39;s lives.&nbsp; 
Knowing that I am not the only one experiencing a child that responds like 
mine&nbsp;has been very helpful.&nbsp; </font></div>
