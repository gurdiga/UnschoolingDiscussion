<br/>
Thank you for pointing this out. It was encouraging for me.<br/>
<br/>
My 20-year old son is *totally* unmotivated about anything in life,<br/>
especially things which involve responsibility. He and I had tea<br/>
together last week (he was doing the good son bit because of my<br/>
birthday) and he mentioned that he wants to move to another part of the<br/>
country. I said, &quot;Go for it!&quot; My instinct immediately told me that would<br/>
be a good thing for him.<br/>
<br/>
He was born here in the South, raised in a small town, and -- other than<br/>
3 years when we lived in the Aleutians when he was in second grade --<br/>
has never traveled more than a few hundred miles away.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t like the summers down here (I don&#39;t either; I&#39;m originally<br/>
from Illinois) and is talking about moving to Seattle or somewhere like<br/>
that. He&#39;s a waiter and feels like he could always find work. Of course,<br/>
I wonder if he realizes that he&#39;ll need *money* for this little<br/>
adventure. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to encourage him to go! He needs a wake-up call to life.<br/>

&lt;I wanted to say that I was one of those unmotivating thoroughly<br/>
fruistrating teenagers, and the trick was travel.  Once I traveled I<br/>
realized how much I hadnt done yet.  Out local college ahs stuff that<br/>
give kids opportunities to go almost everywhere. Rachael&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good for you!  It is refreshing to hear about someone with a son whom they<br/>
encourage to be independent.  In my family the boys were SOOOOOO spoiled.<br/>
My brother (27) lives with my parents still (along with his wife and two<br/>
children) because he does not know what he wants to be when he grows up and<br/>
does not make enough money right now to support his family.  I keep telling<br/>
them that he needs to get a different job and move away (far away) from our<br/>
parents so he can learn how to be responsible for himself and be truly &quot;on<br/>
his own.&quot;  His wife could not agree more.  She is in school full time, has<br/>
finished her degree and has another year to complete her certification to<br/>
teach High School.  She is absolutely sick to death of being nagged and<br/>
&quot;mothered&quot; by my/his mom, who is definately the intrusive type.  I think he<br/>
would live there happily forever if nobody pushes him.  Getting meals<br/>
cooked for him most days no matter WHAT his varying schedule might be,<br/>
having free babysitters any night of the week, Not worrying about bills or<br/>
house maintenance, etc.</div>

The way I did it was that I hitchhiked, but I dont reccomend it, it isnt a <br/>
safe way to go about it.  Its a long story of why I did it that way, but I <br/>
wanted to suggest to you that there are cruises that are looking for waiters, <br/>
and you live on the ship for a summer or a semester, you make a lot of money <br/>
because all your expenses are paid, and you get to go somewhere like Mexico, <br/>
Costa Rica, etc.  maybe this would be a good option for him, at least to save <br/>
up the money to move wehre he wants.  Also he could try youth hostils, which <br/>
are supposed to be fairly cheap, and I know in Seattle there are resteraunts <br/>
that provide housing in trade for no paycheck (although you do get tips, and <br/>
I am told this is a pretty good deal).  The maint hing is that he get out <br/>
there, and you get a 1800 number!!  (ITs cheapest that way!)<br/>
<br/>
I think you sound like you are doing all you can.  how about leaving the <br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook somewhere where he will find it?  Its excellent <br/>
and I wish I had it when I was that age, just so I would have known that what <br/>
I was doing was great!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck-- you are brave to encourage him to move away from you, because I <br/>
am a mother now and can imagine that would make you sad.  But if hes doing <br/>
whats best for him, you are doing the right thing by encouraging him.<br/>
PLease ask if you need any mroe ideas-- these are just a few that my fellow <br/>
travelers have found-- <br/>
