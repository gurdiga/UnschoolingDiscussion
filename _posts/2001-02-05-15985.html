<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527659153">Ya know, we have had lots of heated dialog on this list.  We have all<br/>
disagreed and sometimes with great energy.  BUT, even when Sandra has<br/>
strongly disagreed with what I have said, she has never attacked me<br/>
personally, nor anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
This is really too sad and, IMHO, juvenile!  The whole concept of off-list<br/>
attacks shows a real lack of maturity!<br/>

&gt; Anyone who wants to skip this can.  It&#39;s off topic, and more about the<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; and about ethics than about unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Tina, as an adult mother of 4, is PRO-LIFE based on experience and<br/>
&gt; life-circumstances.  Tina happens to be me...&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When you wrote the long letter to me last week, your name was Chris.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s okay.<br/>
&gt; ====================================<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Sandra,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Before I unsubscribe to this group, I wanted to take a few minutes<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and email you personally.  First, I didn&#39;t realize that this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; particular group was open to flaming and derogatory statements to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; other members; you have made me see that it is perfectly fine (at<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; least in your eyes).  What a shame!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Second, I don&#39;t know where you get your misinformation about other<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; religious groups or all of their member&#39;s beliefs, but it is<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; definitely that: MISINFORMATION!!  I also don&#39;t know what tragic<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; experiences you&#39;ve had with any of the mentioned groups that would<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; make you so malicious and unkind to others, or what would make you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; think that you are some kind of spokesperson for groups that you<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; obviously don&#39;t belong to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;And last, your statements and opinions seem to reflect those of an<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; intolerant and unstable mind (much like the abortion clinic<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; terrorists).  Your vehement reaction to my personal beliefs was<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; entirely uncalled for and have forced myself and others off of this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; message board.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Remember how this all got started?  You seem to have no qualms about<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; letting others know how you feel about them or their beliefs but seem<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; very intolerant to anyone who&#39;s belief is different than yours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, what a shame.  I do believe that there is therapy and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; medications out there that may help you work some of this out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Chris<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;P.S.  There is no such word as &quot;badillion&quot;.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Did you look it up?  It was intended for humorous effect---&quot;a very huge<br/>
&gt; number.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I really DO remember how it all got started; I wasn&#39;t even involved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Next time you want to be really insulting, please own up to it honestly.<br/>
&gt; Better in pubilc (as I did, with my own regular name) than under the table<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; secret.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; There once was a young girl named, Tina, who was born to an 18 yo<br/>
&gt; mother and a 21 yo father.  The mother came from a Catholic family<br/>
&gt; with 8 children and the father was adopted by two Catholic parents.<br/>
&gt; Tina&#39;s mother grew up poor and Tina&#39;s grandfather was an an<br/>
&gt; alcoholic.  Tina&#39;s father grew up rich, yet physically abused.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After dating for a year or so, Tina was concieved and Tina&#39;s parents<br/>
&gt; decided to get married and Tina was born in 1968.  The marriage was a<br/>
&gt; horrible one; Tina&#39;s father turned out to be a physically, mentally,<br/>
&gt; emotionally and sexually abusive man.  Tina and her mother lived with<br/>
&gt; the abuse and alcoholism for 10 years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tina&#39;s mom remarried later and her dad, well he ended up dying in a<br/>
&gt; barroom fight when she was 13.  Tina turned to drugs & alcohol and<br/>
&gt; much promiscuity.  At the end of high school she met someone special<br/>
&gt; and spent 5 years with him.  Tina called off their engagement by<br/>
&gt; spending the night with someone else and very high off of her alcohol<br/>
&gt; and drugs.  She dated this guy for a couple of months then found out<br/>
&gt; that she was pregnant by him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tina had a good job, medical insurance and a place of her own and<br/>
&gt; turned to her mother and friend for support.  Well, it was understood<br/>
&gt; that she should just have an abortion.  After all, she was on the<br/>
&gt; pill since age 14 and had had many lovers over the course of her<br/>
&gt; teens and early 20&#39;s.  Everything she had learned in school, from her<br/>
&gt; friends, and from her family all pointed to the practicality of an<br/>
&gt; abortion.  Nobody even asked her if she wanted to keep the baby.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Counselling at the abortion clinic was the equivolent of &quot;Are you<br/>
&gt; sure you want an abortion?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Okay&quot;.  And at 6 weeks the baby<br/>
&gt; was terminated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Time goes on and Tina gets back with her boyfriend from high school<br/>
&gt; and she decides, at age 23, after her abortion, that it&#39;s time to<br/>
&gt; shape herself up.  Her and Jim get married and after 10 years of<br/>
&gt; marriage have 4 children.  Life is good for her and her family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tina looks back at her life and says, &quot;Thank God my grandmother<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t abort any of her 8 children.&quot;, &quot;Thank God that, no matter how<br/>
&gt; mentally ill my father was that he was adopted and wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; aborted.&quot;  &quot;Thank God for my life, my love of life and the wisdom and<br/>
&gt; knowledge to choose life, always.&quot;  &quot;Dear God, why are there people<br/>
&gt; out their that would judge, condemn and terminate our lives just<br/>
&gt; because of the extremely unfortunate circumstances many of us have?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The moral of the above story is that this young lady was born into<br/>
&gt; the &quot;undesireable life&quot; many have described.  Many of the posts would<br/>
&gt; have had Tina and her parents terminated based on genetics or life-<br/>
&gt; circumstances.  Tina herself chose to terminate life based on life-<br/>
&gt; circumstances.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tina, as an adult mother of 4, is PRO-LIFE based on experience and<br/>
&gt; life-circumstances.  Tina happens to be me...<br/>
