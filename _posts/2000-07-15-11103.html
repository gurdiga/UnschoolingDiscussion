<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857002963">&lt;&lt;Please share <br/>
what you have eaten in, say the last 2-3 days, just to give us hopefulls some<br/>
ideas.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You weren&#39;t askin me, Julie, but I&#39;ll jump right in anyway!  :)  We&#39;ve been vegetarian for almost 18 years (dh mostly, two girls and I completely, with oldest dd vegan).<br/>
<br/>
One recipe we really enjoy in the summer (not my vegan dd, obviously!) is CLT or PLT sandwiches, a substitute for the beloved BLT. The bacon is replaced by fried provolone cheese, which sounds strange but really works well.<br/>
<br/>
Kraft makes sliced rounds of smoked provolone cheese, as does Sargento. Actually, I prefer Sargento&#39;s because the are sliced thinner.<br/>
<br/>
I put the rounds in a non-stick pan (VERY important--using a regular pan will cause a big mess) and fry them over medium heat, then drain them on a paper towel. The cheese loses most of it&#39;s fat, leaving behind crispy slices that can be broken apart and put onto sandwiches with tomatoes, lettuce and mayonnaise. In between batches of cheese, I pour off the oil and wipe the pan. My dd likes hers fried just to brown, but I like mine done really well--the crisper the cheese, the more it tastes like bacon. She&#39;s never had real bacon, so she probably isn&#39;t after a particular taste/texture.<br/>
<br/>
Another product to look for is TVP (texturized vegetable protein--soy) chunks--large hunks of tvp that work really well in soups and stews and are very reminiscent of chicken. Co-ops either carry these or can probably order them.<br/>
<br/>
Summertime salads can be meals in themselves if they include garbanzo beans (chickpeas), toasted sunflower seeds, frozen green soybeans and, for non-vegans, hard-boiled eggs in addition to myriad veggies/fruits we put in: different kinds of lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, radishes, carrots, jicama, avocado and tomato.<br/>
<br/>
More later!<br/>
