<div id="ygrps-yiv-979425063">Thank you Sandra, Angela and Kristen for your help, information and empathy regarding our issue with fighting. I hope I didn&#39;t make my kids out to be overly abusive, they aren&#39;t, just a  impulsive in an agressive way. This list, though overwhelming at times, has been so helpful to get me to confront what I model for my children. I have always considered myself an attachment parenting, warm, loving mother(which I am) but I don&#39;t think I ever noticed the subtle ways that I would show my impatience and frustrations. This list has somehow illuminated some important things that I can now change...and the truth shall set you free!!!<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that I originally joined with some basic questions about my 10 ds. We have always homeschooled and from the beginning he wouldn&#39;t accept instruction of any kind. I listened to him and backed off though now and again I would borrow something and try it on him always to be rejected. So here I have an incredibly creative, open minded, intelligent and busy 10 year old who is extremely nonacademic. He loves being read to and we read a lot(even with the difficulties of 3 younger siblings). But he is a non reader, non writer, has difficulty with numbers past 20, can&#39;t count money and can barely tell time. This is difficult for me. He says he wants to read but won&#39;t try. What does this mean? I have tried to share some different ways he could learn how: trying to read books alone, doing some kind of program to learn some basic rules etc. What should I do at this point? He is a perfectionist and I think that gets in the way. He doesn&#39;t want to start with &quot;baby&quot; books but he can&#39;t just pick up Harry Potter and read it even though it has been read to him number of times. Do I wait for him to show interest in adding and subtracting? Will he? Do I just let him do whatever and not learn to add, multiply, read on his own? Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again. -Christine<br/>

<br/>
What about magazines with lots of captions, not mostly text.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know his interests, but video gaming magazines?  Games Magazine?  MAD?<br/>
<br/>
Money (allowance, or send him on errands if you&#39;re near a store?), games like <br/>
rummy, poker (if he&#39;s interested) involving scoring, counting...   Do you <br/>
have Five Crowns?  It&#39;s a very cool game.  And if you don&#39;t advertise it as <br/>
math, but just as a game, the scoring&#39;s lots of math, and the strategy <br/>
eventually is too.<br/>

do it. If he loves the stories eventually he will realize that he needs to <br/>
learn to read them on his own before he moves out of the house :-) If it <br/>
helps, I know several unschooled kids who were similar and did read on <br/>
their own later.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest loved the Tintin books and Calvin and Hobbes before he was ready <br/>
for few- or no- picture books. My middle son (Eric) is almost eight and <br/>
much quicker at numbers/math than my ten-year-old (William), but at seven <br/>
William would read long books on his own, while Eric will read almost no <br/>
books on his own.<br/>

said, so it was pretty much a matter of matching up the words he knew with<br/>
what they looked like.  I used to try to get him to read out loud to me, but<br/>
it was a huge battle.  A while after I gave up he discovered Calvin and<br/>
Hobbs and Sherman&#39;s Lagoon comic books.  He followed me around the house for<br/>
hours while I was cleaning or cooking and read to me!  They also brought up<br/>
a lot of interesting subjects for discussion; aliens, reality T.V., who is<br/>
Martha Stewart? what is Zen? etc.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea is that if he has younger siblings, you could ask him to read<br/>
&quot;baby&quot; books to them.  It&#39;s good practice for him, but the book is for the<br/>
baby, so it&#39;s not embarassing for him.<br/>
<br/>
YMMV,<br/>

First, it was one of the few books ANYone owned. But also most folks had <br/>
already memorized LONG passages, and when they &quot;matched up the words they <br/>
knew with what they looked like&quot;, they could then READ. After so much <br/>
&quot;matching&quot;, it made sense.<br/>

much easier his video games were when he could read the clues!  He also spent <br/>
and spends a lot of time reading comics - particularly the old Superman <br/>
comics (his uncle shares his collection)! <br/>
<br/>
When he finds something he wants to read, he&#39;ll read!  Trust me - I didn&#39;t <br/>
believe it either but he&#39;s living proof! ;)<br/>

Monopoly, Yatzee, and a card game called War. We don&#39;t have Five Crowns.<br/>

<br/>
My son, and other boys that I have heard of, liked to read cartoon books<br/>
long before they were ready to read big chapter books like Harry Potter.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Foxtrot is pretty funny and has snarky sibling interaction.  Garfield<br/>
was also popular here, but it may seem too juvenile to your son.  Calvin<br/>
and Hobbes is great, but I wouldn&#39;t start there as it uses sophisticated<br/>
vocabulary and might be frustrating.<br/>

reading it on his own? and a new reader?<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading Calvin and Hobbes  to my 7 and 4 year old and  they <br/>
are both enjoying it.<br/>
<br/>
The 4 yo loves the space man spiff stuff and 7 yo asks about why does <br/>
he have to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Why does his mom always wake him up in the morning etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think Calvin and Hobbes is great unschooling propaganda. (hee hee)<br/>

Hi, Samantha --<br/>
<br/>
I agree, I actually love it.  I just wasn&#39;t sure it was the right place<br/>
for a reluctant reader to dive in (or to be pushed in.)<br/>
<br/>
And I think I forgot to advise against &quot;pushing&quot;.<br/>
