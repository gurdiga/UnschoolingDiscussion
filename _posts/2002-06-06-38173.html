<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253455615">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who know a lot about shots, can you please let me know about <br/>
the tetnus shot.  My son has not had immunizations and had a bike accident <br/>
today where he needed about 6 stiches in is leg.  They told me to give him a <br/>
tetnus shot tommorow.  I don&#39;t know what the ingredients are or if it is <br/>
really necessary.  The hospital cleaned the wound very well and put medicine <br/>
in it.  Please let me know what you know about this shot.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343071662">Hi,<br/>
My daughter suffered an infection in her foot from a cut and I was advised<br/>
to give her a tetanus shot. However, a naturopath and the doctor that I took<br/>
her too (I like to get two opinions from each field) more or less said the<br/>
same thing that tetanus was prevelant in the days that horses were used -<br/>
precar days - and since we don&#39;t use or are around horses then tetanus isn&#39;t<br/>
the problem anymore.<br/>
<br/>
What I did instead was made up a paste with slippery elm powder, MSM powder<br/>
(drawing agent to draw out the infection) add a couple of drops(10) of tea<br/>
tree oil (natural antiseptic) and a tea spoon of manuka honey (natural<br/>
healing agent in the manuka from New Zealand).<br/>
<br/>
I put the paste on her foot and covered it for half an hour, then gave it a<br/>
breather for half an hour then redid it again. Well I was meant to do that a<br/>
few times over the next 24hours however I only did it once over night and in<br/>
the morning the infection was gone (no need for shots or antibiotics)<br/>
however her foot was shriveled up like it does when you have been in water<br/>
for ages.<br/>
<br/>
I know that this is different form having stitches and you may not be able<br/>
to apply it over the stitches and I don&#39;t know the ingredients of the<br/>
tetanus shot but we had no problem with avoiding it even though she had a<br/>
bad infection in her foot and she too has not been vaccinated.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck and I hope your boy is well, pretty traumatic for him I can<br/>
imagine and probably for you too - I hate seeing my kids hurt.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
it is the Austalian Vaccination Network and provides info on ingredients in<br/>
vaccinations - it is prochoice but very on the side of avoiding<br/>
vaccinations - very good info though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927579312">Thanks for replying.  My son went into the children&#39;s emergency room for <br/>
stiches.  They were acting almost like they would call children&#39;s services if <br/>
I did not have the shot given.  I don&#39;t want anything to happen to my son and <br/>
tetanus is extremely scary.  I just know they cleaned it within about an hour <br/>
and a half and cleaned it better then I could at home.  It was the spikes on <br/>
his pedals of his bike that made about a 4 inch long open wound.  They wrote <br/>
on the form they strongly recommended the shot tomorrow and I have a feeling <br/>
they are going to call the doctor.  I know the doctor is going to tell me to <br/>
get it if I go tomorrow.  I went to the page you gave me, thank you, but <br/>
still am not sure about the ingredients or the risks.  Do you know any place <br/>
else I can go for information quickly.<br/>

<br/>
also for your interest<br/>
<br/>
There are three exemption possibilities in most U.S. states:<br/>
<br/>
  1.. Medical Exemption: All 50 states in the U.S. allow for a medical<br/>
exemption. A few states allow licensed naturopathic or chiropractic doctors<br/>
to issue medical exemptions in addition to medical doctors. However, few<br/>
pediatricians check for indications of increased risk before administering<br/>
vaccines, so it is advisable for parents to research this matter for<br/>
themselves. Epilepsy, severe allergies, and siblings&#39; previous adverse<br/>
reactions are but a few of the many conditions in child or family history<br/>
which may qualify for a medical exemption;<br/>
  2.. Religious Exemption: Nearly all states allow for a religious<br/>
exemption; this may not require membership in an established religious<br/>
organization (individual state laws vary); and<br/>
  3.. Philosophical Exemption: An increasing number of states allow<br/>
philosophical exemptions, in recognition of the controversy and/or violation<br/>
of freedom that mandated vaccination laws impose<br/>
If you need a religious reason even if your not religious well this article<br/>
might help (as in regards to abortion - you can always say you don&#39;t believe<br/>
in the use of aborted human fetuses for vaccines!!)<br/>
<br/>
These viruses have been cross-mutated in animals, contain animal DNA &<br/>
RNA, have more than just diptheria,tetanus, polio, hepatitis, measles,<br/>
mumps, rubella etc. etc...in fact, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and rubella<br/>
are made from aborted human fetal tissue.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your decision making and bleesings to your son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444264036">Tetanus is the only shot my youngest has had. I got it for him since at 1 he<br/>
might not necessarily let me know if he stepped on something. Puncture<br/>
wounds are the problem usually because The bacteria goes in very deep. I<br/>
won&#39;t get a booster shot because now he can alert me and as long as a<br/>
tetanus shot is given within 72 hours it&#39;s ok.<br/>
For my own child, I would probably get one, although I would call my<br/>
personal physician and ask for a Tetanus only rather than DT which contains<br/>
diptheria immunization. If s/he doesn&#39;t have it, call around for a doctor<br/>
who does. It may be hard to find one that is just Tetanus.<br/>

Just to clarify, &quot;aborted&quot; means miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) also,<br/>
not just from a elective abortion. (The medical procedure to terminate a<br/>

       Yes, Tetanus does still exist, and you don&#39;t have to live around <br/>
horses to be at risk. I have seen a few cases in my years working in <br/>
emergency departments. Tetanus can be lethal. We give boosters dependent on <br/>
the severity and cleanliness of the wound and length of time since the last <br/>
immunization (a case-by-case evaluation). Please take that into consideration <br/>
along with all your other research. Yes, I agree that you should know what <br/>
you&#39;re being given. I&#39;ve seen too many people blindly accept what a <br/>
healthcare provider recommended. I am all for informed consumers. The <br/>
flip-side is not to be so prejudiced against immunizations/medications that <br/>
you don&#39;t realize when the benefit outweighs the risk.<br/>
       I hope this helps,<br/>
