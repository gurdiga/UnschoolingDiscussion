&gt; you&#39;ll get it together and it will be great too. :-)<br/>

Without too much drama, you can get public transportation into Boston so you <br/>
don&#39;t have drive there, and it&#39;s a lot less expensive than staying in the city. <br/>
And if you want, you can get into Southern Maine in less than two hours.<br/>

I am so excited about this.  I grew up in Back Bay in Boston, and in Newton.  We went to the North Shore a few times but never to your area.  I always wanted to go there.  Plus, we never want to spend the money to go back to MA but now we have a great excuse.  I think dh has also known that if we go back up, I won&#39;t want to leave.  It&#39;s prob. a good thing the conference isn&#39;t happening in the fall.  <br/>
