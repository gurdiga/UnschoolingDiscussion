<div id="ygrps-yiv-673493861">***But speaking of doors, I hope others are benefiting from this discussion,<br/>

think.***<br/>
<br/>
So many of the posts over the last week have helped me enormously. It<br/>
occurred to me yesterday that the process of unschooling in my life is like<br/>
the life cycle of an insect. The egg hatches and the nymph changes slightly<br/>
with each moult until it becomes the adult insect.<br/>
<br/>
 Life over the last couple of years has been one of slow, but constant<br/>
change. I reach a place in my growth where I am able to shed an old habit or<br/>
mindset completely and start afresh with a new concept until that too<br/>
becomes a part of who I am rather than something I am putting into practice<br/>
and slowly I am becoming a new person and yet I&#39;m still me. I know my kids<br/>
are benefiting from this and they are the reason I began this journey but<br/>
along the way I found myself. so thanks guys! It&#39;s kinda cool to be able to<br/>
be free  to be me.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Mia had her breakfast for lunch and her lunch for breakfast and<br/>
she wore her pyjamas all day. We went to my Mum&#39;s briefly at 1pm and on the<br/>
way she turned to me (shoeless, wearing her nightie and weighed down by<br/>
pencils and paper) and said, &quot;Mummy, I&#39;m having a happy day.&quot; And I thought,<br/>
me too.<br/>
<br/>
This week I&#39;ve been able to see I have still been quite controlling with<br/>
what she wears and I have realized I could relax a little more with the food<br/>
and I posted a positive affirmation in my kitchen above the workbench. It&#39;s<br/>
&quot;I choose this moment to be patient with others.&quot; It&#39;s almost miraculous how<br/>
easy it has made it for me to be patient. Maybe it is just knowing that it<br/>
is my choice not a have to.<br/>
<br/>
There were moments, many of them, last year when I thought I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
able to do it. I found the TV irritating and would be upset if the kids<br/>
wanted to watch it rather than do something with me. I really made it a<br/>
competition in my head between me and the box. I realized I was being<br/>
unreasonable and just accepted the choices they were making and now I don&#39;t<br/>
really notice how much it&#39;s on.<br/>
<br/>
The house is noisier but more peaceful and there is so much understanding<br/>
between us. I think it&#39;s trust.<br/>
<br/>
Life is glorious!!<br/>

That&#39;s really sweet.   It&#39;s hard because people say and hear &quot;peace and <br/>
quiet&quot; so often to get them to consider that quiet isn&#39;t always peaceful and sound <br/>
doesn&#39;t equal chaos.  There are happy, contented noises!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that.<br/>
<br/>
I have the &quot;I think I&#39;m metamorphizing&quot; feelings every few years, and I used <br/>
to be uncomfortable and afraid when I was in my 20s and things went all still <br/>
inside me, but now I welcome it because I recognize it as &quot;something&#39;s going <br/>
to change!  COOL!&quot;<br/>
