<div id="ygrps-yiv-677256953">I woke up in the middle of the night last night and spent an hour<br/>
worrying about if I&#39;m doing the &quot;right thing&quot; by taking him out of<br/>

I still think I want one.  One that says &quot;yes you are absolutely doing<br/>
the right thing&quot;  But who would this person be to say &quot;everything is<br/>
going to be all right&quot;?  I guess that person would be me.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Definitely limiting my time with my mother, who has an extremely<br/>
negative view of not only homeschooling but me is probably the first<br/>
step towards second guessing myself and what I know intuitively is right<br/>
for us.<br/>

Just wanted to ramble as I listen to Zak and Max alternating between<br/>
playing soccer in the back garden and digging for treasure.  I think<br/>
they are going to be ok.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720670637">Dawn, I get those nagging &quot;middle of the night&quot; fears, too.  I think <br/>
it&#39;s just part of the process of freeing ourselves, and deschooling.  <br/>
Unschooling &quot;feels&quot; right, to me, but when Zena says, &quot;I&#39;m so bored&quot; <br/>
or when she does nothing but sleep all day, waking up in time to do <br/>
her paper route and watch Yu-Gi-Oh, followed by hours of video games <br/>
or online role playing, those fears creep back in.  I know we are <br/>
still deschooling, as it has only been 6 months since I pulled her <br/>
out.  Part of me (the schooled part) just expects her to &#39;magically&#39; <br/>
wake up one morning and ask me how to do &#39;this&#39; or tell me she wants <br/>
to know &#39;that&#39;, but the unschooling part of me knows that she is <br/>
finding her own way, and when she needs help, she&#39;ll ask for it.  <br/>
Part of me (the schooled part) thinks &quot;How in the world is she ever <br/>
going to make it through? No dances? No band? No teachers to inspire <br/>
her?  What the heck am I thinking?  It&#39;s too much responsibility to <br/>
put on a child, to be responsible for their own education..&quot;   But <br/>
then I read these boards, and read some more, and think about how <br/>
liberated she is and will be, and I know that she will grow and she <br/>
will learn...without school, without imposed limitations on her <br/>
precious time, her precious mind.  If only my mother had known of <br/>
unschooling.  Then that awful, nagging voice in my head wouldn&#39;t even <br/>
be bothering me, and my life will have been led out of pure interest <br/>
and joy...Wow..it&#39;s an awesome concept.  I&#39;m just glad that I found <br/>
it in time, thanks to Sandra and the others here and on &quot;the other <br/>
list&quot; that give me the confidence to pull this off.  I know that I am <br/>
not the only one experiencing this uncertainty, and, along with you <br/>
and thousands of others, I can handle these little annoying voices.  <br/>
I know this is right for my kids, even if not everyone else sees <br/>
that.  WE CAN DO THIS!<br/>
<br/>

*sending you strength to ignore those midnight voices*<br/>

Give yourself 185 days of that every year!  <br/>
School has kids a small part of 180 days.  You don&#39;t have to justify learning <br/>
every day.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get past the panicky nervousness, you will see learning every day, <br/>
but until that time, allow yourself 185 &quot;off&quot; per year.  And it&#39;s okay if you <br/>
take them all in one lump up front!<br/>

Another trick is to try to go a week in which nobody at your house learns <br/>
anything.  If something looks like learning might be imminent, just casually <br/>
switch back to something from which nobody could possibly learn anything.<br/>

Good luck with THAT one! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 Unschooling &quot;feels&quot; right, to me, but when Zena says, &quot;I&#39;m so bored&quot; <br/>

 or online role playing, those fears creep back in.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you can recognize that the fears are part of the brainwashing we <br/>
recieved at the hands of an institution that did not have the individuals <br/>
needs as a priority.<br/>
Drown those fears!! Or at least send them packing by listening to your heart, <br/>
reading stories of happy unschoolers and following your passions.<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling for 2+ years now, I was what I&#39;d consider and <br/>
eclectic/relaxed school at homer prior to total unschooling. (the math fears <br/>
thing would surface here and there)<br/>
It is only in the last couple of months that Trevor (now 13) has begun to <br/>
really blossom as far as interests. He has always had strong interests in tv <br/>
and video games, but my fears would surface every now and again when he <br/>
seemed to not be interested in anything else.<br/>
I took the advice here and go into his world. I watched his shows and learned <br/>
about them. I played some of his games with him, took him to Yugio leagues <br/>
etc....<br/>
He wanted an electric guitar for Christmas, got one and has bugged the heck <br/>
out of me for lessons. He starts Wed. and is very excited. He&#39;s also been <br/>
begging for some type of martial arts training, so we&#39;re planning to start <br/>
that soon too.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, I was working all day and dh was lost in pre-Superbowl land. <br/>
Trevor not only watched two of his younger siblings (ages 5 and 2) he also <br/>
got ambitious and cleaned the entire kitchen (we have no dishwasher, so it&#39;s <br/>
a major feat in my opinion) did laundry including folding his brothers <br/>
laundry (he&#39;s over at a friends house) organized his dresser and straightened <br/>
the living room.<br/>
He had to ask his Dad what temperature to set the load of laundry on, since <br/>
he couldn&#39;t remember. Other than that, he had NO outside input and was never <br/>
asked to do one of the things he did.<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to say that all children will do this type of thing when you <br/>
embrace unschooling. But I believe that you let their natural abilities shine.<br/>
When Trevor was being coerced, he had no reason to be inspired or to take <br/>
ownership of anything. Once I backed off, his true nature could shine so much <br/>
better.<br/>
I believe he has always craved order and cleanliness, but was certainly not <br/>
going to take ownership of his needs when I was being pushy and controlling.<br/>
I think that&#39;s true in many areas of life.<br/>
Give them ownership and they blossom.<br/>
All in a different way, all in their own time, but it DOES happen. Trust that <br/>
it does.<br/>
On those days that they seem to be vegging on tv and video games, join them.<br/>
Be a part of their world and they&#39;ll be more willing to be part of yours.....<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

parental unit suggests a board game.<br/>
<br/>
The video games are another story; I am *so* lame at them I can&#39;t even begin<br/>
to participate.  They tried to teach me to play Super Monkey Ball, once.  (I<br/>
dont&#39; even play computer games with moving objects, as I&#39;m<br/>
Tetris-challenged; I can do Solitaire and Scrabble.)  Dear son thinks it&#39;s<br/>
funny to make fun of mommy.  I use this as a teachable moment for<br/>
Unschooling Philosophy:  I ask him if he&#39;d like to try riding a horse over a<br/>
jump or two.  He&#39;ll say something like, &quot;I&#39;m not interested in horses.  Oh.<br/>
You&#39;re not interested in video games so you haven&#39;t learned how to play<br/>
them?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055378351">Ren, this is so true and very nice to read. I have also been letting go of coercion and embracing autonomy. It has been a long road, and I don&#39;t think my 2 adult daughters would recognise my parenting! <br/>
<br/>
We began Home educating almost 3 years ago. As soon as I found out about unschooling I knew that was what was best for my family. I read John Holt and bought my daughter Grace Lilly&#39;s &quot;Teenage Liberation handbook&quot;. She never read much of it, but I got heaps out of it! My husband was less convinced, but having little time to *teach* the *basics* he considered important, things were left mostly to me. He has since changed his mind, thank goodness!<br/>
<br/>
As time has gone by, I have gained confidence and don&#39;t suffer from many HE related fears. I was absolutely terrified when we were notified of our first ERO (Educational Review Office) visit. In New Zealand one of these govt review officers comes to make sure your children are &quot;being taught as regularly and as well as in a registered school&quot;. This is the only legal requirement for home educating here. My children had been doing *nothing* for 2 years by most people&#39;s standards. It sounds scary, but once armed with information, a sound educational philosophy and confidence, it is OK. That doesn&#39;t make it any less intrusive or offensive, but there is no need to fear it. On this first occasion though I had not reached that point and I coerced my children into producing some *work* for the reviewer. I will never ever do this again.  <br/>
<br/>
My children have also blossomed. My boys are still more interested in playing strategy games on the computer that anything else, but I have come to accept this and no longer place judgements on their interests. (Jan Fortune-Wood in her book &quot;Doing it their way&quot; really helped here). As you say, Ren, they really enjoy it when I join in and have a game. It&#39;s more fun than I thought, and I am amazed at the skill my boys have developed.<br/>
<br/>
Something has happened that I thought impossible....I have stopped trying to force my kids to do chores (almost all the time, not perfect yet &lt;g&gt;) and have cheerfully done these things myself instead. Now I have a tidier house, I seem to have more time now that I am not nagging anyone else to do things that *I* want done and, wonder of wonders, the children have started helping spontaneously and happily agreeing to polite requests for help (I am willing to accept a &quot;no&quot; when I ask). Now that I am treating them with true respect, I am getting it back.<br/>

<br/>
Please keep in mind that at least some of us feel that plentiful sleep is<br/>
essential to the healthy growth of a young person. And that watching TV,<br/>
playing video games and role playing games are great learning opportunities<br/>
that should be supported like any other activity. Being bored is not a crime<br/>
nor is it indicative of some failure on your part. Saying &quot;I&#39;m so bored&quot; is<br/>
an expression of being uneasy and is a way of asking for advice.<br/>
