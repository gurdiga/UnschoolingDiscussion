&gt; This cracked me up!!!!   It reminds me of when I was in the hospital after<br/>
&gt; having  both kids. Everyone wanted to know  whether or not I&#39;d had a &quot;BM&quot;. I<br/>
&gt; would take a walk up the hall and the cleaning gal would ask me for crying<br/>
&gt; out loud! I was a slow learner but finally figured out they weren&#39;t going to<br/>
&gt; let me go home until I had.<br/>

it. And don&#39;t even *think* about being slightly abnormal and not have one but <br/>
once every three days or so. The nurse I had with Moly just wouldn&#39;t accept <br/>
the fact that I had one the day before and wasn&#39;t *due* another for one more <br/>
day. <br/>

if needed.<br/>
