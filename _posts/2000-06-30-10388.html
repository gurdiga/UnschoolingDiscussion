<div id="ygrps-yiv-756140839">Can anyone recommend educational software that would appeal to a 7yo who is <br/>
just starting to read? I&#39;d also like to find some good, fun math software <br/>
for him. He has a MacIntosh that he knows more about than I do, but I am <br/>
totally unfamiliar with educational software. All we have right now is <br/>
&quot;Jumpstart 2nd Grade&quot; which he seems to be bored with.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Annette<br/>
