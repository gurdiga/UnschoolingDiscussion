Have you read The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith?<br/>
I can&#39;t give you any curriculum suggestions for him since I am an unschooler<br/>
and don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot;, sorry.<br/>
I can recommend a few things from an unschooling point of view.<br/>
Start by bringing him home and allowing the two boys to just hang out, talk,<br/>
play video games, toss a ball around together and also go on some FUN<br/>
outings, get to a lake and explore, go to museums, ride bikes around the<br/>
neighborhood. Give them both some time to decompress and reignite their<br/>
natural curiosity. Buy them &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; and take turns<br/>
reading to each other. Play games and cards with them. Just spend some time<br/>
BEing together. While this is happening, read John Holt, old issues of GWS<br/>
(Growing Without Schooling) you&#39;ve managed to beg or borrow. Read the<br/>
message boards at the site ( www.unschooling.com )<br/>
and most important, ask questions here. Lots and lots of questions. Print<br/>
out the answers and posts that ring a bell within you, especially the<br/>
answers to your question that you find irritating or downright *wrong*. read<br/>
them a couple times throughout the day and think deeply about how and why it<br/>
is affecting you, for those are the answers you may truly need to hear.<br/>
Have fun, and keep your eyes open!<br/>

The most helpful thing you can do is take the focus off reading for a while<br/>
and help him to see the ways that he is smart. The best way to learn to read<br/>
is by finding a reason to read and being in an environment where reading is<br/>
useful and enjoyable. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard for kids to learn to read in<br/>
school. It&#39;s sort of like forcing a not-yet-walking child to walk. They<br/>
wouldn&#39;t see the point, they would resent being forced to do something they<br/>
are neither ready for nor see a point in.<br/>

that he&#39;s not good enough. He is. He&#39;s just on a different schedule and<br/>
learns better another way. You *can* help him.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read The Gift of Dyslexia? I know that and some other books have<br/>
been recommended on Unschooling.com<br/>

Hi, Michele --<br/>
<br/>
I think you can do it.  I really think the school system is unlikely to<br/>
be able to give your 14 year old what he needs.  If reading is a big<br/>
difficulty for him, he can learn a lot (at home) from books on tape,<br/>
videos, or things you read to him. And, of course, he can learn a lot<br/>
from going places and doing things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just been reading a book called The First Year Homeschooling Your<br/>
Child, by Linda Dobson.  I think it&#39;s a very reassuring book.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that Lenore Colacion Hayes has written a book about<br/>
homeschooling kids with special needs.  I haven&#39;t had a reason to read<br/>
this book, and I don&#39;t know the exact title, but Lenore is very<br/>
knowledgeable and experienced and a cool unschooler, so I have to figure<br/>
this is a cool book.  (I think it&#39;s the very first book ever written<br/>
about homeschooling kids with special needs.  It&#39;s certainly the only<br/>
one I have ever seen, so it fills a real need.)<br/>
<br/>
If you go to the unschooling.com message boards there&#39;s lots of good<br/>
advice archived there, and  you can search by keyword to focus on the<br/>
information you want.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Betsy</div>

&gt; My 14 year old son has dyslexia - phonically aware and fluency at 4th<br/>
&gt; grade level. Public school has basically taught him nothing for years.<br/>
&gt; He feels very stupid and it has become an emotional block. He is<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Michele,<br/>
<br/>
Well, first, I don&#39;t see how you could possibly do worse than the public<br/>
schools have with the young man, even if you were TRYING to do worse, so I<br/>
think you can relax on that. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not very well versed on dyslexia problems and solutions (others here may<br/>
be of much more help to you on that) but I&#39;d say you probably know some<br/>
about it already and can do more research and get some creative ideas,<br/>
opinions on how to approach or not-approach it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re doing that, pull your 14 year old and let him sit home and<br/>
unwind and de-stress. Let him watch TV, go for walks, and look out the<br/>
window. Let him plant a garden or cook something or walk the neighbor&#39;s<br/>
dogs.<br/>
<br/>
As this is an unschooling list, the advice you&#39;re likely to get on<br/>
curriculum is &quot;none&quot;. :) Let him (and your 11 year old, for that matter)<br/>
decide what to do with their days. Offer interesting ideas of places to go<br/>
and videos to watch and be willing to take no for an answer.<br/>
<br/>
What they will come up with, with your willingness to support them in what<br/>
they choose to do and your willingness to bring choices to them, will be the<br/>
best for them. Nobody knows your child as well as your child.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Michele - bring him home! It sounds like he has endured a lot of hardship<br/>
and pain in his school experience. Poor guy. Let him know over and over how<br/>
proud you are of him for anything he&#39;s good at or likes to do, or just for<br/>
being who he is right now. Don&#39;t focus on any negativity that he has come to<br/>
feel from school or what has been said to him there. Pretend it is a weekend<br/>
or summer vacation every day and let go of the acadamics and expectations.<br/>

&gt; Any helpful ideas welcome. Thank you. Michele<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My suggestion would be to say YES to his request to teach him at home. You<br/>
will only do him a disservice if you leave him in school. A loving,<br/>
understanding mother/father is what he needs most right now. Ask him what he<br/>
wants to learn about or what he&#39;s interested in and go from there. Watch<br/>
movies together from the library or video store. Visit any museums or cool<br/>
places to go in your area. Go out to eat in a new or different restaurant -<br/>
or experiment with some different meals at home Pretend you are a tourist!<br/>
See all the touristy sights that you may not have seen yet. Never mind<br/>
getting any curriculum - you should stay far away from that right now.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you and your son.<br/>

&gt;&gt;grade level.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son also got all sorts of reading disablity labels while he was still in <br/>
school. What helped him most was for me to take him out of school and all <br/>
those special programs and to stop focusing on his learning to read for <br/>
awhile. I took off all the pressure when he came home from school and just <br/>
let him be. I did still continue reading to him, though, because he enjoyed <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Once he realized we weren&#39;t going to force anymore reading lessons or check <br/>
is fluency or grade level anymore, he was able to relax. Eventually he <br/>
started casually looking through stuff to read around the house, magazines, <br/>
old children&#39;s books, game cards, newspapers and LOTS of comics. He is 13 <br/>
now and reads just fine for purpose or pleasure. I couldn&#39;t tell you what <br/>
grade level he&#39;s at because I no longer check such things. But I can tell <br/>
you that he likes to read and no longer has a fear of it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Public school has basically taught him nothing for years. He feels very <br/>
&gt;&gt;stupid and it has become an emotional block.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like he needs to come home and deschool for awhile. There are so many <br/>
things a 14 year old can be doing and learning that don&#39;t require him to <br/>
read. He has plenty of time to get the rest of those reading skills in <br/>
place. What he needs now is time to heal from the damage all those labels <br/>
have done to his sense of Who He Is and what he&#39;s capable of doing and <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am afraid I will do him a disservice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve said he already feels stupid and hasn&#39;t been learning anything in <br/>
public school. How could you possibly do worse than that? He wants to come <br/>
home to learn. He wants you, who understands how smart he really is, to help <br/>
him. That&#39;s not a disservice. It&#39;s throwing him a lifeline.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Does anyone have suggestions on curriculum?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, we&#39;re unschoolers here so we don&#39;t use curriculums. :o) But we do use <br/>
life and that&#39;s the biggest curriculum there is.<br/>
<br/>
My best advice is to bring him home and let him decompress and deschool. You <br/>
can keep reading here and at unschooling.com for ideas on how to help him <br/>
ease out of school and back into real life.<br/>
The book Right Brained Children in a Left Brained World by Jeffrey Freed <br/>
might also shed some different light on his learning style and reading <br/>
abilities.<br/>
<br/>
You can do this. You can help him regain his sense of self and his natural <br/>
love of learning. Many of us have been right where you are now and have seen <br/>
what a difference unschooling can make. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is one of the problems with public school. The focus can so easily go <br/>
towards what a person is not good at, rather than their strengths.<br/>
The school system decides what and how a person should learn, and when it <br/>
doesn&#39;t match up with that persons interests, learning ability or style they <br/>
slap a &quot;disabled&quot; label on them.<br/>
All of the energy and focus is on the failing grades, the inability to <br/>
complete homework and such.<br/>
The poor child has been brainwashed to believe that he is not intelligent and <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
You can change that, but it&#39;s going to take a long time to recover his love <br/>
for learning.<br/>
Focus on the things he&#39;s good at. Focus on what a wonderful person he is and <br/>
how much you love him.<br/>
Show him that what other people want him to learn isn&#39;t important, but that <br/>
his own interests are.<br/>
Play together and find opportunities to learn about things that fascinate him <br/>
so you can share some of his interests.  If it seems that he doesn&#39;t have <br/>
interests, give it time. That spark for life, that passion for learning has <br/>
been damaged....but it will come back, I&#39;m sure of it.<br/>
