<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492606296">&lt;&lt; So I guess <br/>
 we are trying to set up some schedule that does allow for some flexibility.  <br/>
 If we all sleep till 10:00 AM, I guess it is OK... but we will just have to <br/>
 make sure we try to keep up with scheduled events.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL! Isn&#39;t this what homeschooling is all about? I also found that if I tried <br/>
to get us all up early and start school, we lost steam until afternoon. So <br/>
now we all wake according to our body&#39;s clock (unless we have a scheduled <br/>
appointment) and we allow ourselves to wake up before we try to jump in and <br/>
get going!<br/>
 My partner works shiftwork and homeschooling around that schedule has been <br/>
wonderful! It&#39;s a 4-day-on, 4-day-off schedule so it allows for a lot of <br/>
flexibility...it&#39;s nice that the kids can be here on the off days!<br/>
  To sum up, I&#39;ll quote my son &quot;hey, the principal doesn&#39;t care if we wear <br/>
our &#39;jamas to school,&quot;!<br/>
