&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve never actually seen anything with Alan Rickman, I just know how much <br/>
 Shyrley loves him.  We arent&#39; really movie people... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ACK! Not movie people?  I can&#39;t imagine life without all the great history, <br/>
fantasy and drama brought to life as it is in movies. I&#39;ve learned more from <br/>
movies than any other single medium.<br/>

<br/>
I learned typing there.  I learned to type so well, that yesterday I typed<br/>
my name 4 times in one of my emails before I spelled it right.  Now that is<br/>
bad! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, maybe I should qualify a bit.  We dont&#39; like movie theatres.  But we <br/>
love watching things.  American Experience and Ken Burns are things we stay <br/>
up late for.  And we have a lot of movies here, mostly kids stuff, though.  <br/>
I&#39;m not good with gore or violence, either, so that&#39;s kind of limiting with <br/>
popular movies.  Aren&#39;t I a whiner???<br/>
