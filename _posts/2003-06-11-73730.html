&lt;I ask you to consider what your goal is in making a child <br/>
acknowledge and <br/>
thank a hostess for a meal but not needing an adult to do so.  <br/>
Personally, I <br/>
would be more shocked if an adult chose not to do so, rather than an <br/>
inexperienced child.&gt;<br/>

I completely agree here.  If you expect kids to say excuse me, then <br/>
Mom & Dad should do that too.   You will never have to *teach* them, <br/>
they will do it on their own.  Also, bad manners are much more <br/>
unforgivable from an adult than a child.  Kids who have bad manners <br/>
will usually have parents that are similar.<br/>

<br/>
thank you. I really am trying to learn. Going through a huge paradigm <br/>
shift here, and that&#39;s scary. Feeling clueless and feeling like I <br/>
really messed up my oldest boy (23, &quot;victim&quot; of my cluelessness, <br/>
immaturity, harshness, what have you) But this list helps so much.<br/>
<br/>
SO MUCH to think about. SO MUCH inner work to do.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again, Lee-Ann in Australia.<br/>

I agree with Lee-Ann, Heidi.  I am still starting out so I am often <br/>
still confused about things.  Today was one of those doubting days.  <br/>
Those &quot;I am not doing enough with them&quot; days.  Although, I know they <br/>
get alot of attention, I always worry they do not get enough &quot;great <br/>
adult example to inspire them&quot; time.  I don&#39;t even know if that makes <br/>
sense..LOL!  For me, it has not been as much of a paradigm shift in <br/>
*discipline* or the manner of raising them.  Although there is <br/>
certainly alot of that too.   More of letting go of the teaching <br/>
stuff and not worrying about the writing and reading.  <br/>
Congratulations on your journey :)<br/>
