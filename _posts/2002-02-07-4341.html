<div id="ygrps-yiv-844973729"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;The California Story is a fun filled, two hour walking tour with a specially<br/>
 </span></blockquote>trained Disney guide. Students will learn about California history in a<br/>
unique way- by discovering how it is built into the newest addition to the<br/>
Disneyland Resort, Disney&#39;s California Adventure Park. The tour is scheduled<br/>
to include a few shows that compliment the content of the tour, and our<br/>
group will visit each of the four geographical regions of California located <br/>
in<br/>
the three districts of the park.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay, this is surreal. Hey, remember Disney wanted to do a history park in <br/>
Viginia, I think, around one of the Civil War battlefields?  Folk singer Hugh <br/>
Blumenfeld wrote this great song making fun of it: <br/>
<br/>
(when hiroshima comes to disneyland)<br/>
<br/>
the kids will all get crayons to trace their shadows on the walls<br/>
& paper cranes inscribed with names<br/>
there&#39;ll be cranes, cranes flying overhead on wires<br/>
& on banners from the parking lots on in<br/>
& there&#39;ll be origami lessons on demand<br/>
when hiroshima comes to disneyland<br/>
the gates will open at 8:15 for the fireball & the omnimax<br/>
we&#39;ll watch oppie reading sanskrit & einstein playing violin<br/>
& the twenty-five mangled maidens <br/>
will all be made beautiful again (with our american medicine) kabuki players <br/>
whiter than a thousand suns will fold their fans<br/>
when hiroshima comes to disneyland<br/>
every night at sunset poli-sci majors paying off student loans<br/>
will stage re-enactments of V-J Day in period clothes--<br/>
sailors will go around kissing all the girls in the street<br/>
how we&#39;ll praise the lives we saved<br/>
so we could go to Viet Nam<br/>
when hiroshima comes to disneyland<br/>
wave to hirohito <br/>
& the fish-bellied samurai<br/>
(hai hai hai)<br/>
goodbye goodbye goodbye<br/>
I&#39;m gonna get myself a little boy action doll before I head back to the hotel<br/>
enola gay glider kits for the kids & some fused los alamos glass<br/>
and when the fireworks flash<br/>
I bet they get the smoke to blow 8 miles to the top<br/>
& we&#39;ll shield our eyes with our transparent hands<br/>
when hiroshima comes to disneyland <br/>
    <br/>
from his album Mozart&#39;s Money<br/>
