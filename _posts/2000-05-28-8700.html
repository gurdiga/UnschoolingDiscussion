<div id="ygrps-yiv-632441272">Hi Nicoletta,<br/>
I have 3 daughters ages 7, 4, and 2. We pulled our oldest out of school in<br/>
December. She still keeps in touch with her friends. I think I had a harder<br/>
time with it than she did. I am a very loyal person and still feel a sense<br/>
of loss from not being at her school. However, we are thoroghly enjoying our<br/>
unschooling experience and I don&#39;t regret our choice. It&#39;s also important to<br/>
remember thar a)it&#39;s not carved in stone and b) there are plenty of families<br/>
that homeschool some of their kids and send some to school. So whatever<br/>
choice you make can be flexible enough to fit your family&#39;s needs. Good Luck<br/>
to all of you in your quest for the ultimate homeschool life.<br/>
Amy<br/>
