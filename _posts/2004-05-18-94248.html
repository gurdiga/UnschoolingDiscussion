<div id="ygrps-yiv-135031148">With summer approaching and the possibility of more traveling in the <br/>
car, I offer a book I stumbled on at the Scholastic sale.  It&#39;s <br/>
called &quot;Carschooling&quot; by Diane Flynn Keith.  This is a terrific book <br/>
full of ideas for unschooling on the road (and lots of facts I didn&#39;t <br/>
know, either).  Look for it at any bookstore or amazon.com or <br/>
