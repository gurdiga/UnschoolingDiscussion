I clean the house, it is because I want to, if I don&#39;t want to, it stay<br/>
dirty.  I don&#39;t believe you have to do things you don&#39;t want to do.  I know<br/>

It&#39;s funny because I tend to think I usually live my life  from a place of choice.  However, I do understand <br/>
that is not always the case.  Example.  I live in a two story split level house.  Four floors.  Three sets of stairs.  <br/>
I do not want to walk up and down the damn stairs all day.  However, the office is downstairs, kitchen is second floor,<br/>
Marks bedroom is on third and I am on the fourth.  I guess my choice is to lay in bed on the fourth floor and not eat <br/>
all day.  Sometimes I trick myself and pretend I actually enjoy the exercise.  Attitude does make a difference.  I choose<br/>
to have a clean sink more often than not but I do not like washing dishes.  I choose to be a SAHM but I do not like<br/>
not having several hundred dollars to drop in the bank account every week.  I guess in my case it is both.  I choose to<br/>
live my life and compromise probably at least once a day in regard to what I want.  I often want to stay in my pajamas all<br/>
day and I do that.  I choose to not care what the neighbors think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248474029">Infinite possibilities: you could move to another house, you could <br/>
have your husband work elsewhere, you could remodel the space to have <br/>
a mini-kitchen or refrigerator more convient, you could have an <br/>
elevator installed. Yes, you might need to choose to go back to work <br/>
or might choose not to use all your retirement money, etc. But we <br/>
always have choices.<br/>
<br/>
Children however, do not always have choices in our culture because <br/>
we obstruct their liberties by using coercion. No one is obstructing <br/>
your liberties, except the tax man and the law, as Sandra pointed <br/>
out. Children&#39;s choices are often unheard or not advocated for. <br/>
Knowingly &quot;making them&quot; do something they don&#39;t want to do is <br/>
coercion.  Someone wins and someone loses. Explaining why you want <br/>
something and then they change their mind to wanting to do it is <br/>
using persuasion. Discussiing ways to each get what you want is <br/>
negotiating for a win-win solution. <br/>
<br/>
The use of rewards and punishments to persuade is manipulation, just <br/>
another tool of coercion. Making something enjoyable so that you both <br/>
want to do it is an art. It takes practice and trial and error. do <br/>
not expect yourself to know how to come to common preferences without <br/>
practice. Do not expect to be able to do it perfectly all the time. <br/>
Common preferences do exist but can not always be found immediately. <br/>
<br/>
But next time we can be more creative based on our experience. I <br/>
don&#39;t believe a pattern of coercion exists with isolated coercive <br/>
events. But I do appologize when I can not find a common preference. <br/>
I acknowledge that it isn&#39;t the way that I want to interact and I <br/>
will work VERY hard not to have a pattern created. If a problem <br/>
repeats itself, it requires work to resolve. It is not easy. <br/>
Consensual living is its own reward. Liberty for all is worth working <br/>
for.<br/>

The use of reward could be persuasion.<br/>

People persuade people to work by promising them money.  That&#39;s not coercion.<br/>
