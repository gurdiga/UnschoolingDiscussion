<div id="ygrps-yiv-183533782">Hi all!<br/>
    I wanted to follow up my intro with an info request, so thought I&#39;d put<br/>
this in a seperate e-mail:)<br/>
       I&#39;m on a quest. The guys have been asking all these interesting<br/>
questions about Granddaddy Longlegs (eight-legged harvesters, not the<br/>
cranefly type) and I have been having an awful time finding any info. Most<br/>
of the library books on spiders we&#39;ve read in the last couple of years, or<br/>
at least skimmed, and few even mention them. I checked our central library<br/>
childrens department, and the librarian and I ended up using an encyclopedia<br/>
to get any info at all!:p     I don&#39;t mind, but the guys thought it kinda<br/>
dry...<br/>
    Does anyone have any favorite books or web-sites (or videos, or<br/>
what-ever) that they could recommend??<br/>
TIA!<br/>
Tamara<br/>
ps - please forgive me if this is a duplicate for anyone....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I would be most happy if my children grew up to be the<br/>
kind of people who think decorating consists of building<br/>
enough bookshelves.&quot; -- Anna Quindlen</div>
