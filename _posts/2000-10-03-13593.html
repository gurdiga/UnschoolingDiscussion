<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088210264">Oh geez, that was a tease wasn&#39;t it?  Ha, Ha....sorry about that!<br/>
The book is Discover Your Child&#39;s Learning Style<br/>
Here is the web site at Amazon about it....<br/>

<br/>
I loved it!!  It really helped me with my son.  There is recommendations<br/>
about materials in there too.  You can copy the assessments and do one for<br/>
each family member.  It really helped me see my children and their<br/>
personalities more clearly.  I will probably buy it to have around all the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for leaving you hanging!<br/>

A friend let me borrow a CD of theirs, I thought it was way boring, but when I<br/>
asked him if I should tape it, he said yes.....  It is nice to have a clue.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28794858">I&#39;ve also heard of Singin&#39; Smart tapes, which used to be available through Learning Home, $12, phone 410-536-5990.  Item TPZ001 - government, US, europe, planets, composers, bones, myths, etiquette, seasons.  Item TPZ002 - body systems, muscles, central/south american countries, africa, continents and seas, major mountains, preamble to constitution, famous writers, inventors, explorers, fun with puns, dewey decimals, and 41 common elements.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoy Jim Weiss tapes/CDs also.  Recently have been listening to his _Galileo and the Stargazers_, which touches on a LOT of interesting tidbits that can branch out in many directions.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it&#39;s a good idea to request that your library subscr*be to Boomerang.  Our library system here has been very receptive to customer requested purchases, often getting things I ask for within a couple of weeks!         Peace -- Debbie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210991032">Thanks for the info.<br/>
We have been listening to Jim Weiss too, I will look for the one you suggested.<br/>
We also love Odds Bodkin.  Rip Roarin Paul Bunyan Tales had us all laughing like crazy!!<br/>
Does anyone know if Boomerang has a web site.  I&#39;d like to print something out to take to the library.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868065234">Hi Ann-<br/>
I&#39;m a lurker on this list, but you wrote about your<br/>
son being an auditory learner and wondered about<br/>
tapes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My 11yob is an auditory learner, too and I get every<br/>
kind of tape I can think of.  He loves books on tape<br/>
from the library...even ones that might seem boring to<br/>
others.  He loves to listen to the radio.  We have a<br/>
public radio station that plays old time radio plays<br/>
on Sunday evenings and he just loves those. <br/>
I also read aloud to him just as much as I possibly<br/>
can and I&#39;m always amazed at how much he remembers and<br/>
knows about the stories and characters.<br/>
I bought him his own CD Walkman for Christmas and he<br/>
just loves to wear his earphones and listen to books<br/>
on CD.  He goes to sleep that way, in fact.  <br/>
I would just encourage you to find ways to aid your<br/>
son in this style, because helping my son find<br/>
auditory ways to learn has just really helped him. <br/>
He&#39;s very non-verbal and has a hard time writing, so<br/>
he had a tendency to feel insecure in groups where<br/>
those skills are valued (namely, school!)  But,<br/>
showing him that there is a way that he can learn<br/>
easily has really encouraged him.  <br/>
Boomerang is great, I have to say.  We&#39;re lucky to<br/>
have it at our library.  Maybe you could suggest the<br/>
purchase to the library?  I know our system is open to<br/>
suggestions from readers.  Or maybe somebody out there<br/>
could buy it for him for a birthday/Christmas gift? <br/>
My daughter wanted it so badly that she saved up money<br/>
from babysitting, etc. to buy it for herself, so now<br/>
we don&#39;t even check it out from the library!<br/>
Keep looking...sound like you&#39;re on the right track!<br/>
Carol B.</div>
