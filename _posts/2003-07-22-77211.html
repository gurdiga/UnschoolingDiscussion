<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545057094">&lt;&lt;Punch holes and put them in a three ring notebook. You can double print if <br/>
it <br/>
covers two topics. At least the move would be smoother!  &lt;g&gt; Then you could <br/>
hang them all over the house when you&#39;re settled! Unschooling wallpaper!&gt;&gt;<br/>

Thanks Kelly, now I know what to do will all those 3 ring notebooks I have <br/>
that I was just about to toss. Cool. I really like that idea about the <br/>
unschooling wallpaper though, seriously, I think it would be different and unusual, <br/>
sort of like me! LOL I really think I&#39;m going to figure out a way to take all the <br/>
tips and quotes and make some type of wallpaper out of them for one of the <br/>
rooms in our house.<br/>
