<div id="ygrps-yiv-625574311">The deschooling ourselves is such a challenge! My oldest son and I were<br/>
doing some research on snakes. With my school mindset, I asked him what<br/>
questions we need to answer to put together on snakes, thinking of stuff<br/>
like what they look like, where they live, etc. HIS questions though, were<br/>
why do they have forked tongues, why do they shed their skins, and my<br/>
favourite, will they evolve into something else. I love it when he forces me<br/>
to think outside of my sometimes narrow framework!<br/>
About the siblings - that is a struggle around here sometimes too, although<br/>
today when they couldn&#39;t seem to get along I separated them into their own<br/>
rooms, and told them I was angry because they weren&#39;t being good friends to<br/>
each other. Within a few minutes, my five year old had crept into the three<br/>
year old&#39;s room to ask him to play again, then they shouted down the stairs<br/>
to me that they were being kind to &quot;our ch&#39;other&quot;<br/>
Separation seems a fate worse than any, I guess.<br/>
I was just at the Oak meadow site, inspired by what I&#39;ve read on the list,<br/>
and if it ever becomes necessary for me to register with a private school<br/>
like that, that&#39;s sure the way I &#39;d go. I put in a subscription to the<br/>
magazine too - it looks wonderful.<br/>
Sorry, too long again - I seem to save up my thoughts then dump them at<br/>
once!<br/>
