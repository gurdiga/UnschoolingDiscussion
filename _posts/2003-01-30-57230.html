<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784002452">You wake up after 10am and it&#39;s no big deal.....and you&#39;re in your jammies at <br/>
noon more often than not.<br/>
<br/>
Your five y.o. learns to read before your 9 y.o.<br/>
<br/>
When your kids find squirrel skeletons you don&#39;t shout &quot;get that gross thing <br/>
outta here&quot; but instead offer to help them glue it onto a display board.<br/>
<br/>
You actually find the mold in your refrigerator fascinating and a great topic <br/>
for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
When your kids want to have a jello or popcorn bath, you actually try it.<br/>
<br/>
If your children want to have a Birthday party for an invisible friend, you <br/>
actually bake a cake and decorate your house and have a PARTY!<br/>
<br/>
Going to the beach at midnight and listening to reggae is considered <br/>
reasonable and a great opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Your 13 y.o. thinks you&#39;re cool, asks your opinion on things and wants to <br/>
take classes with you.<br/>
<br/>
When people talk about teen rebellion you honestly have no idea what they <br/>
mean.<br/>
<br/>
Your children quote Austin Powers and Monty Python movies with ease.<br/>
<br/>
Your son stands over your shoulder while you&#39;re on the unschooling.com email <br/>
list and gives you ideas for your post!! :)<br/>
<br/>
OH, and you make fundamentalist Christians squirm in discomfort if you are <br/>
even in the vicinity!! hehe Just kidding...couldn&#39;t help myself.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

Some people would read this and say it wasn&#39;t healthy.<br/>
By &quot;healthy&quot; they mean normal.<br/>
By &quot;normal&quot; they mean they would like to believe that such a think is not <br/>
possible, so that their relationship with their kid isn&#39;t shown to be already <br/>
pretty much ruined, and so they say anything to the contrary is unhealthy.<br/>

Sometimes I&#39;ll close a file and Holly will say &quot;HEY, I was READING that!&quot;<br/>
The other night I took Marty to Kinko&#39;s at 11:20 at night, and we talked <br/>
about some of what was at www.unschooling.com on the drive.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;OH, and you make fundamentalist Christians squirm in discomfort if you are <br/>
even in the vicinity!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HEY, they&#39;ve been doing that to me for years.<br/>
