John Taylor Gatto :The Most Famous Teacher in the World<br/>
by Diane M. Cooper<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If John Taylor Gatto had your ear - especially if you are a parent - <br/>
he<br/>
might ask you some pretty strange questions:<br/>
<br/>
* What if it could be absolutely proved to you that the American <br/>
educational<br/>
system was designed by financiers who felt that self-reliant, self-<br/>
educated<br/>
American citizens made poor factory workers and rotten consumers?<br/>
<br/>
* What if you could become convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that<br/>
literacy in the United States was at its highest point just before<br/>
compulsory education was signed into law?<br/>
<br/>
* What if there is a really scarey parallel between school bells and <br/>
bugle<br/>
calls, and it&#39;s not accidental?<br/>
<br/>
* Could any of this make even a little dent in the beliefs we have <br/>
been<br/>
spoonfed by our media about &#39;&#39;Why Johnny Can&#39;t Read&#39;&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
Forty years ago, Gatto was an advertising copywriter who became bored <br/>
with<br/>
the ad business and needed a place to &#39;&#39;mark time&#39;&#39; while he thought <br/>
things<br/>
through. His roommate at that time had a teaching license but wasn&#39;t <br/>
using<br/>
it. &#39;&#39;It was sitting in a drawer,&#39;&#39; Gatto says. &#39;&#39;He taught for one <br/>
day,<br/>
tossed his license in a drawer, and said you&#39;d have to be crazy to do <br/>
that<br/>
for a living.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
So using his roommate&#39;s license, Gatto started substitute <br/>
teaching &#39;&#39;just to<br/>
see what it was like.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
He soon became intrigued by the responsibility the job offered. &#39;&#39;If <br/>
you<br/>
dropped dead,&#39;&#39; he told us, &#39;&#39;there aren&#39;t many businesses that would <br/>
miss<br/>
you, not even if you were the CEO. But teaching school was <br/>
different.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
He ended up teaching for 30 years, as what he calls a &#39;&#39;saboteur&#39;&#39; - <br/>
someone<br/>
who tries to change the system simply by refusing to follow it. Along <br/>
the<br/>
way, he learned some sobering, basically frightening, facts about the <br/>
true<br/>
intent of &#39;&#39;government&#39;&#39; education in our public schools.<br/>
<br/>
Today, he says, he is &#39;&#39;in constant motion, in every one of the fifty <br/>
states<br/>
and seven or eight foreign countries, bearing witness to what I saw <br/>
in that<br/>
30-year period.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Here, the Spirit of Ma&#39;at interviews this amazing man whose insight <br/>
and<br/>
knowledge have brought a new breath of healing air into the closed<br/>
classroom. Author of Dumbing Us Down and The Underground History of <br/>
American<br/>
Education, John Taylor Gatto, although he&#39;s no longer operating from <br/>
within<br/>
the system, is still &#39;&#39;the most famous teacher in the United States.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Diane: How did you happen to get so completely sidetracked from the<br/>
advertising business?<br/>
<br/>
John: What I think happened was a series of events which occurred <br/>
when I was<br/>
substitute teaching, where I seemed to run into a densely compacted <br/>
mass of<br/>
perversion on the part of nominal authorities. In challenging or <br/>
testing<br/>
myself against these authorities, I became genuinely intrigued by what<br/>
appeared to be massive stupidity. It seemed that things that were <br/>
very easy<br/>
to accomplish were being made impossible to accomplish by the very <br/>
structure<br/>
of the system itself, and its guardians.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to take a year or two out of the advertising business and <br/>
teach. I<br/>
thought I&#39;d go back, eventually, and make a fortune in advertising. <br/>
But each<br/>
week I stayed in teaching, I became more enthralled by the political<br/>
challenges.<br/>
<br/>
Today, after 40 years of thinking about this business, I see that the<br/>
obstacles that are generated structurally have nothing to do with <br/>
stupidity.<br/>
And that they are virtually insuperable unless somebody&#39;s ready to <br/>
play the<br/>
saboteur.<br/>
<br/>
A couple years ago, Mort Zukerman, the publisher of US News and World <br/>
Report<br/>
and the Atlantic Monthly, said that our wonderful economy is<br/>
self-maintaining because our people are not like any other people in <br/>
the<br/>
world. They are interested only in their paycheck. They don&#39;t mess <br/>
around<br/>
with management. They define themselves by what they buy, and they <br/>
throw<br/>
away what they buy as soon as they buy it. They mortgage their <br/>
futures.<br/>
<br/>
As I read that article, I said to myself, How do people get this way?<br/>
<br/>
Well, they get this way by being schooled to be that way.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: So how did our schools get to be that way.<br/>
<br/>
John: Look at our school system as a laboratory, and then you can see <br/>
that<br/>
the physical habits that are trained into our children quite <br/>
purposefully<br/>
limit and defeat them. You have to ask someone&#39;s permission to go to <br/>
the<br/>
toilet. You have to sit in a cramped seat from nine to three with <br/>
virtually<br/>
no ability to get up and move around. These things would be deadly <br/>
even for<br/>
adults. For children it&#39;s a colossal perversion.<br/>
<br/>
Nor are there any known intellectual explanations, based on academic<br/>
results, for any of this behavior.<br/>
<br/>
And the people who stand before these children - the teachers - are <br/>
the<br/>
single worst-performing group in American colleges. If that&#39;s not <br/>
radical<br/>
enough, the people who manage the people who stand before the <br/>
children -<br/>
that is, the superintendents - are considerably more ignorant than <br/>
the most<br/>
ignorant subgroup among the teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I believe you&#39;d have to be terminally innocent to believe that <br/>
this<br/>
inverted pyramid could have occurred by accident. But it is the only <br/>
way to<br/>
keep the system intact. You put the worst people in charge, and the<br/>
second-worst people in charge of the kids. And you do this in second, <br/>
third,<br/>
and fourth grades. Kids either learn to think critically at that age, <br/>
or 95<br/>
percent of the time, they never do.<br/>
<br/>
And, starting out in kindergarten, sitting in our schools makes people<br/>
restless - with each other, with themselves, with their families, <br/>
with their<br/>
possessions. When you can make people generally discontented with<br/>
everything, you have the perfect climate for a successful mass-<br/>
production<br/>
economy. And when you have people who don&#39;t understand anything <br/>
except some<br/>
little specialty - like how to drill a tooth, how to argue a case in <br/>
court,<br/>
some little thing - you have the perfect climate for running <br/>
everything<br/>
centrally. Specialists don&#39;t see themselves as citizens.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: So how did this happen, if it wasn&#39;t an accident?<br/>
<br/>
John: If you look at the annual reports of the Carnegie Foundation <br/>
beginning<br/>
about 1906, you&#39;ll find out where schooling and its structure came <br/>
from.<br/>
You&#39;ll find out what its goals are. And it is nothing to do with any <br/>
debate<br/>
being conducted in any press or any forum in the United States, today <br/>
or any<br/>
other year that I&#39;m aware of.<br/>
<br/>
If you take the window of 1890 to 1910, what was traditionally <br/>
thought of as<br/>
&#39;&#39;schooling&#39;&#39; began to vanish. It was replaced by a kind of global<br/>
experiment in human behavior, in human obedience, tractability, and<br/>
conditioning. Our schools today are a laboratory of human behavior.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of this you can deduce logically. If you&#39;ve got a small-farm,<br/>
agricultural economy, it&#39;s easy to see the qualities people will <br/>
need: the<br/>
ability to be alone with themselves for long periods of time, to be <br/>
utterly<br/>
resourceful, to be able to fix anything that broke.<br/>
<br/>
So what if you&#39;ve suddenly got a mass production economy where the <br/>
machinery<br/>
has to run night and day in order to pay for itself. How could you <br/>
train<br/>
these self-sufficient, resourceful kids to support such an economy? <br/>
That was<br/>
the question.<br/>
<br/>
How it happened was not a secret. Between 1890 and 1910, there were <br/>
masses<br/>
of public statements made by the owners of the new economy, <br/>
statements that<br/>
were extremely anti-intellectual, extremely demanding of what they <br/>
wanted<br/>
schools to produce. And on higher levels, such as the Harvard Ed. <br/>
Journal,<br/>
there were actually bald statements of what these demands were all <br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t accuse these people of being conspiratorial. They were very <br/>
open<br/>
about what they were bringing about - which was, in part, the death of<br/>
capitalism.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: So how did they mean to accomplish this?<br/>
<br/>
John: Their method was to model our schools after the Prussians. The<br/>
Prussians had figured out in the early part of the 19th century, long <br/>
before<br/>
we had forced schooling ourselves, that if you lock all the kids up <br/>
and keep<br/>
them amused with colors, games, music, and balloons until they&#39;re <br/>
about ten<br/>
or eleven, then all of a sudden you crack down and say, Okay, the fun <br/>
is<br/>
over, those children will never recover their volition, their <br/>
independence -<br/>
their minds. They will become wonderful soldiers and workers. Even if <br/>
they<br/>
can conceive of opposition, they won&#39;t be able to sustain it.<br/>
<br/>
This is how Germany produced the most successful armies that have <br/>
ever been<br/>
seen in history. Even in its lost wars, even when outnumbered two to <br/>
one and<br/>
more, Germany regularly inflicted thirty to forty percent more <br/>
casualties<br/>
than those it fought against. The army worked like a well-tuned <br/>
machine<br/>
because no one ever argued with orders.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: So the developers of our compulsory education system adopted <br/>
that<br/>
system?<br/>
<br/>
John: Yes. People went to Germany in the late 19th and early 20th <br/>
century<br/>
and came back with these coveted German PhDs - we didn&#39;t have our own <br/>
PhDs<br/>
yet - and they took over the presidencies and the heads of key <br/>
departments<br/>
in every major American university.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: I was looking at the word &#39;&#39;kindergarten&#39;&#39; and it dawned on me <br/>
that<br/>
that, too, is a German phrase.<br/>
<br/>
John: Yes, and it doesn&#39;t mean &#39;&#39;a garden for children.&#39;&#39; It means a <br/>
garden<br/>
where teachers cultivate children like vegetables. Frederick Frobel - <br/>
the<br/>
guy who invented kindergarten - had a life-long dream to be a member <br/>
of the<br/>
Prussian Army, but they wouldn&#39;t take him because he was born in <br/>
Austria.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: So the system is about our economy?<br/>
<br/>
John: People who believe that organized schooling can be about <br/>
anything else<br/>
than serving the existing economy are out of their minds. I feel a <br/>
great<br/>
deal of sympathy for these people, the huggy kind, because they don&#39;t<br/>
deserve what they get, and they certainly don&#39;t deserve to waste their<br/>
life&#39;s energy and their heart&#39;s blood fighting imaginary battles on<br/>
imaginary battlefields.<br/>
<br/>
But there isn&#39;t any way for a centralized school operation not to be <br/>
about<br/>
the dominant economy. You can argue till you&#39;re blue in the face. And <br/>
if<br/>
you&#39;re a mother, you&#39;ll be arguing with a school teacher, or a <br/>
principal, or<br/>
a superintendant. And when you do, you&#39;re arguing with someone who <br/>
has no<br/>
power at all. None of those roles has any power at all. The only way <br/>
they<br/>
can step out of their powerless role is to play the role of saboteur.<br/>
Because the system, by definition, has no room for debate. It may <br/>
feign<br/>
debate as a way to bleed away public discontent, but by definition, <br/>
there is<br/>
no room for real debate. The system is systematic - if it&#39;s not <br/>
systematic,<br/>
it&#39;s not a system anymore. It collapses. There is no wiggle room at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: A while ago, you said the change to our school system was in <br/>
order to<br/>
bring about an end to capitalism. Could you say more about that? I <br/>
thought<br/>
we still had capitalism.<br/>
<br/>
John: It&#39;s true that we are all racing around screaming at each other <br/>
about<br/>
who&#39;s the greatest capitalist. But it&#39;s impossible any longer to be a<br/>
capitalist - there is no competition left that matters at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you a few pieces of evidence: Lockheed and Boeing should <br/>
have gone<br/>
out of business years ago. They weren&#39;t allowed to go bankrupt <br/>
because your<br/>
tax dollars were used to buoy them up until they could sustain <br/>
themselves<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Chrysler is another corporation that should have gone bankrupt a long <br/>
time<br/>
ago. There is no reason for Chrysler to be in business except for <br/>
massive<br/>
injections of federal tax money.<br/>
<br/>
The government issues bogus contracts, and simply buys things that are<br/>
junked instantly, all in order to keep these few central corporations <br/>
in<br/>
business. Chrysler is just one of the most flagrant examples.<br/>
<br/>
In my later life I&#39;ve been dumbfounded that otherwise intelligent <br/>
people -<br/>
certainly my intellectual peers - can look at the words and the story <br/>
and<br/>
are unable to see the meaning. Some of them could pass a quiz about <br/>
when<br/>
Chrysler went bankrupt, and what year the government bail-out <br/>
occurred, and<br/>
what size it was - but they have no idea of the significance of this. <br/>
<br/>
Our economy is basically centralized in 200 corporations who are <br/>
totally<br/>
dependent on government privilege. These corporations require the <br/>
government<br/>
to stamp out any competition that emerges, and they require the <br/>
government<br/>
to pick them up when they stumble and fall, and bail them out with <br/>
public<br/>
funds.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no competition. There hasn&#39;t been since the end of the second <br/>
World<br/>
War. And as I implied earlier, the plan to destroy capitalism was <br/>
announced<br/>
by Carnegie and company back in the 1890s. They said that only stupid <br/>
people<br/>
and fools competed. That competition was a huge waste of energy and <br/>
profit,<br/>
and that there was room for anyone who wanted to play ball. They said <br/>
that<br/>
the democratic populace of the country was getting in the way, so the<br/>
populace was going to have to be put out of commission. These <br/>
statements<br/>
were made quite openly. But no one paid any attention.<br/>
<br/>
Then these ideas were written into legislation.<br/>
<br/>
In Silicon Valley, for example, they succeeded in outdistancing their<br/>
competition through government intercession, guaranteed contracts, <br/>
protected<br/>
markets, and guaranteed profits. Then, with that giant stream of <br/>
revenue<br/>
from the government, they could hire away the creative personnel that <br/>
had<br/>
developed in places you&#39;ve never heard of - like someone&#39;s garage.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: You call yourself a saboteur. How did you get &#39;&#39;found out&#39;&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
John: Saboteurs identify themselves by their radically different <br/>
numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: What if the numbers are positive?<br/>
<br/>
John: It doesn&#39;t matter. The public perception that good school-<br/>
teaching is<br/>
desired or rewarded is naive. Teaching is a &#39;&#39;guild&#39;&#39; system, and <br/>
unlike<br/>
what we were taught in school, guilds were not about ensuring <br/>
quality. In a<br/>
guild, the idea was to ensure that nobody used a technology or method <br/>
unless<br/>
everyone else was using it. There is no innovation in a guild.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: Well, we can see that schoolteachers aren&#39;t necessarily honored<br/>
guildmembers, either. Not if you gauge it by the pay rate.<br/>
<br/>
John: I would dispute that. The national average for teachers right <br/>
now is<br/>
about $41,000 for a nine-month year - comparable to about $55,000. <br/>
That&#39;s<br/>
the average. The upper end of the scale, in most places, is around <br/>
$70,000.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t match the range of a doctor or a lawyer, of course...<br/>
<br/>
Diane: Most of the teachers I&#39;ve heard of are not making that kind of<br/>
money...<br/>
<br/>
John: You believe that because that&#39;s the stuff that&#39;s pumped out by <br/>
the<br/>
teachers&#39; unions. The reality is quite different.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers need only a very indifferent education, and in return, they <br/>
get a<br/>
guaranteed pension, medical plan, and income that is certainly <br/>
adequate, if<br/>
not munificent. It seems to me that American teaching as a career is <br/>
one of<br/>
the great deals in human history, especially for people who, by and <br/>
large,<br/>
are not very accomplished themselves. Many teachers&#39; hearts could <br/>
bear a<br/>
very close scrutiny - but not their intellects or their <br/>
accomplishments, or<br/>
even their understanding.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, you can take five-year-olds off the street, and teach <br/>
them in<br/>
about two weeks to do all the arithmetic operations mentally - <br/>
really, up to<br/>
multiplying four or five figures! That&#39;s all it would take, two <br/>
weeks. Even<br/>
accomplished mathematicians say that the entire mathematics curriculum<br/>
through calculus and trig takes about 50 contact hours to deliver.<br/>
<br/>
The consensus is that it takes 30 contact hours to bring someone to <br/>
the<br/>
point where they can be a self-teacher in reading for the rest of <br/>
their<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
When we see kids who can&#39;t read, we&#39;re seeing the results of a radical<br/>
dysfunction that is transmitted by schooling. We&#39;re talking about <br/>
things<br/>
that are very, very easy to learn.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is, it&#39;s very, very easy to put children back on <br/>
track to<br/>
where they can self-teach. But that&#39;s not allowed! That sort of thing <br/>
really<br/>
is severely punished by structured schooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting that teachers, principals, or even superintendents<br/>
understand that this is what&#39;s going on. They do what they are <br/>
instructed to<br/>
do by the orders that are passed down - from where, they don&#39;t know, <br/>
but<br/>
they do know that if those orders aren&#39;t followed, some people are <br/>
going to<br/>
get in a lot of trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: Do you think the rebellion that we are seeing within our <br/>
children<br/>
today - the murders, the drugs, the high crime, and so on - is the <br/>
American<br/>
psyche saying that they&#39;ve had enough?<br/>
<br/>
John: Yes. Plato said that before you can make a new society you have <br/>
to<br/>
wipe the slate clean. One way to do that was to wipe our children&#39;s <br/>
minds<br/>
clean of history, philosophy, literature - all the things that used to<br/>
provide models of human behavior and the range of human choice.<br/>
<br/>
What was also required to reach the path we are in now was for four <br/>
or five<br/>
generations of parents to become progressively weaker, more isolated <br/>
from<br/>
reality, more specialized, dependent, addicted to purchasing - so <br/>
that each<br/>
succeeding generation of parents, from somewhere around 1910 on, has <br/>
had<br/>
less to teach its own children. The consequence is that children are<br/>
learning very early on to disrespect their parents. They are learning <br/>
to<br/>
keep two sets of books... to lie with an easy heart...<br/>
<br/>
So now, with the existing adult generation providing no models to <br/>
follow at<br/>
all, you see children casting their lot with a basketball player or a <br/>
singer<br/>
or a comedian - or God knows what. Television actors. Commercial <br/>
musicians.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: So how are we going to change this?<br/>
<br/>
John: We&#39;re not going to change it. This system will overthrow itself.<br/>
There&#39;s not the slightest doubt in my mind that that is happening <br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
But it isn&#39;t going to happen in the halls of Congress. I think it&#39;s <br/>
useful<br/>
to argue in the streets, but that also has limited utility, and it&#39;s <br/>
too<br/>
easy to cripple the few leaders.<br/>
<br/>
The system will come apart because it has become so anti-life that it <br/>
now<br/>
has to spend huge amounts of its energy watching out for people like <br/>
me. The<br/>
saboteurs.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to accelerate the procedure, you absolutely have to do it<br/>
individually, on a family-by-family basis. And maybe in little <br/>
neighborhoods<br/>
or private associations, but not by linking together in a big <br/>
countersystem.<br/>
That can be self-defeating.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: And you say it&#39;s already happening.<br/>
<br/>
John: Yes. There is already quite a snowball effect happening.<br/>
<br/>
For example, there can&#39;t really be anyone who thinks standardized <br/>
tests<br/>
measure what they purport to measure. Not the people who make the <br/>
tests, and<br/>
not the people who administer them. Bill Bradley - who&#39;s considered <br/>
the<br/>
intellectual of the Democratic Party and graduated from Princeton - <br/>
had a<br/>
480 on the language SAT. That&#39;s a moron&#39;s score. Senator Paul <br/>
Wellstone had<br/>
a combined total score in math and language of 800, an astonishingly <br/>
low<br/>
score. I could go on and on with examples like that. Bush had a 550, <br/>
and he<br/>
graduated from Yale! If you can be a Senator, a Governor, or the <br/>
President<br/>
with these numbers, why not anything else? Why the atmosphere of <br/>
threat and<br/>
fear schools use as &#39;&#39;motivation&#39;&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
And there have been regular &#39;&#39;test revolts&#39;&#39; for the past ten years. <br/>
But the<br/>
papers, which are owned by those few corporations we talked about, <br/>
were not<br/>
allowed to report them for fear that it would give other people ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Then recently, a hundred mothers in Scarsdale, the richest community <br/>
in the<br/>
United States, have refused to allow their kids to take standardized <br/>
tests.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: And that&#39;s having an effect?<br/>
<br/>
John: That&#39;s made the front page. When a hundred mothers in <br/>
Scarsdale -<br/>
every one of them in a $2 million home or better - make a stand, then <br/>
the<br/>
papers can no longer refuse to cover it. Because now the decay has <br/>
reached<br/>
the very group that supposedly protects the system.<br/>
<br/>
So a lot has happened. I cast my own lot 40 years ago as a saboteur, <br/>
and it<br/>
would be difficult to quantify the damage I&#39;ve done, but I know that <br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
been considerable.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s more to come. As I travel around the country I find <br/>
people of<br/>
every persuasion who are doing it - they probably don&#39;t think they are<br/>
sabotaging, but that&#39;s what it is. When you react against a system&#39;s<br/>
directives, you&#39;re sabotaging the system. That system may be a <br/>
million times<br/>
stronger than you. But it&#39;s not unlimited. It doesn&#39;t have an <br/>
unlimited<br/>
ability to suppress all these reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Diane: So it will be family by family making a stand?<br/>
<br/>
John: It&#39;s going to be conversations like you and I are having right <br/>
now.<br/>
And passing that on.<br/>
