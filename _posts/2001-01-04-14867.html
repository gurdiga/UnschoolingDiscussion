<div id="ygrps-yiv-530805247">Thanks for all the advice. It has been so helpful. He is eating more and<br/>
I noticed he is teething. Not just one tooth but all 4 molars at once. I<br/>
would be cranky too. He did a similar thing but much shorter when he got<br/>
some other teeth awhile back. I think he is just not good with teething<br/>
honestly. Poor little guy.<br/>
<br/>
So I broke out him hylands homeopathic book and looked up teething and<br/>
found a discription that fit him to a tee (my 11 year old said &quot;Mom that<br/>
is so HIM!) . So I started giving him some Chamomile and he is actually<br/>
less grumpy and playing at the moment.  He will nurse is he is half<br/>
asleep so I feel better he isn&#39;t weaning like I thought. I was so<br/>
heartbroken to think he might be.<br/>
<br/>
So we have cancelled a lot of things and told some friends it isn&#39;t a<br/>
good time to visit and are taking it slow and letting him go at his own<br/>
pace.<br/>
<br/>
I am so thankful we are unschooling at this time. I over heard my<br/>
youngest daughter and her little brother playing house and taking care<br/>
of thier sick babies. Was to cute. So here is another one of those life<br/>
lessons we can learn from.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your help!<br/>
<br/>
Namaste,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189554455">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to hear things are coming along and <br/>
you&#39;re allowing your baby to heal/recover.  It really bugs<br/>
me how some in this world go, go, go even with sick kids in tow!  So<br/>
many parents seem to be in complete denial of their children and<br/>
underestimate their need for safety, security, quiet and CALM.  You&#39;re<br/>
smart at this point to keep a low profile.<br/>
Baby will be back to himself in no time and I wish you continued success<br/>
with the nursing!<br/>
<br/>
