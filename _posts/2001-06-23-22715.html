<br/>
&gt;My response goes something like this with those kind of people...<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ve been doing some research and also evaluating our own personal <br/>
&gt;experiences with coercive learning and have realized that it&#39;s not the best <br/>
&gt;match for our children or for most children for that matter.  We are giving <br/>
&gt;our children more freedom to learn about the things they are most <br/>
&gt;passionate about so that they actually retain what they learn rather than <br/>
&gt;just cramming through it for a grade or to avoid getting in trouble.  <br/>
&gt;...... &lt;clip&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great response, but I&#39;d have to type this out and read it to her... and then <br/>
she&#39;d ask me to explain it all to her again...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Then you can refer her to John Holt&#39;s books,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great idea!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll start carrying a list of books in my purse - I can just start <br/>
passing them out!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
