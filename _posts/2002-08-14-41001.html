<br/>
Thank you , thank you, thank you for the definition of metadiscussion (this <br/>
is a new concept to me and I love it). Adopting the ban on metadiscussions as <br/>
described in your post would be very good for the list. You have my vote.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m a list newbie who&#39;s been lurking for a few weeks and I agree<br/>
&gt; with the above, particularly #2.  There is a concept called<br/>
&gt; &quot;metadiscussion&quot;, i.e. talking about how people are talking.  I am on<br/>
&gt; many lists where there is a strict ban on metadiscussion, because<br/>
&gt; (as everyone here has seen) once people start criticizing the WAY<br/>
&gt; someone posted or the SUBJECT someone posted about rather than<br/>
&gt; discussing issues and topics, things generally devolve into acrimony<br/>
&gt; and name-calling.  Here is a sample of the metadiscussion policy from<br/>
&gt; one list:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Posting styles are not up for discussion on [this list]. Keep in mind it <br/>
&gt; is not possible for any one person on the [x] list to post in a way which <br/>
&gt; takes into account everyone&#39;s feelings. It is not OK to challenge or <br/>
&gt; criticize someone else&#39;s posting style On List. If you feel offended by a <br/>
&gt; post someone sent to the list and you feel a need to let that person know <br/>
&gt; how offended you are, please do it Off List. If you are offended by the <br/>
&gt; &#39;tone&#39; of the list and you feel you must address this, please address it <br/>
&gt; off list with those who you feel are setting the overall &#39;tone&#39; you <br/>
&gt; perceive. It is not your job to moderate the [x] list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please do not discuss which [listname] Posts or Topics are Off Topic for <br/>
&gt; the [x] List on the [x] List. If anyone wants to conduct an email <br/>
&gt; discussion of which Posts or Topics are suitable for [this list], how often <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; these Posts or Topics should come up, and the number of Posts that should <br/>
&gt; be assigned to a Topic in any given period of time, please take it to <br/>
&gt; private email. Please remember that not all Posts or Topics are going to <br/>
&gt; interest everyone on the [x] List. If you don&#39;t like a Post or Topic or if <br/>
&gt; you are not interested in a Post or Topic, or if you find the Post or Topic <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; distasteful, or if you believe the Post or Topic to be Off Topic, or if you <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; believe the Post or Topic is too boring, simply make it disappear with the <br/>
&gt; Delete Key. If you are sick and tired of reading Posts or topics which <br/>
&gt; appear to dominate the list, feel free to introduce a new Post containing a <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; New Topic. If the New Topic doesn&#39;t take off, feel free to keep introducing <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; New Topics.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been skimming and deleting Ned&#39;s posts, because I&#39;m mostly less<br/>
&gt; than interested in what he&#39;s been writing about.  But I&#39;ve also been<br/>
&gt; using the delete key liberally on all the posts DISCUSSING Ned&#39;s<br/>
&gt; posts, because they&#39;re virtually content-free, at least as relates to<br/>
&gt; my reason for coming to this list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And here I am, metadiscussing.  ;)<br/>
