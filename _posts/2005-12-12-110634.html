<div id="ygrps-yiv-370028401">A new situation is arising more often, where Sarah (16) is beginning<br/>
to find herself in situations where other teens/young 20s are driving.<br/>
<br/>
About a month ago I was in a car following one driven by a teenage<br/>
friend who had Sarah and his own sister in his car, and saw him<br/>
driving rather aggressively and almost hit someone as he changed lanes<br/>
without looking carefully first.<br/>
<br/>
Last night her shift supervisor (a young woman in her late teens)<br/>
offered to give her a ride home from work so that we didn&#39;t have to go<br/>
pick her up.  She called to let me know, and I said it was fine, and<br/>
about 12 minutes later she was home safe and sound.  No problem, but I<br/>
do realize I don&#39;t know this young woman yet, and about a week ago<br/>
Sarah got a ride with another co-worker to the store&#39;s Christmas<br/>
dinner party.  Again, not a problem, I just don&#39;t know these people yet.<br/>
<br/>
How have other people broached this subject with their teens? <br/>
<br/>
I do NOT want to create a bunch of rules, but instead give her<br/>
information and guidelines that apply to any situation so she can<br/>
evaluate it and make good choices herself.<br/>
<br/>
I know and she knows the obvious one of not driving with someone she<br/>
knows is chemically impaired, but are there other things I should<br/>
bring up with her?<br/>
<br/>
I do trust Sarah&#39;s judgement, but want to make sure she has the<br/>
information she needs to make those choices fully informed.  I also<br/>
don&#39;t want to sound like I am judging her friends harshly or anything<br/>
like that either, though, and I know how such converations can sound<br/>
that way without some amount of caution as to how I word things.  <br/>
<br/>
So do I even need to bring it up?  She is a smart girl, and I do think<br/>
she has no weird desire to be in a dangerous situation.  Maybe I am<br/>
feeling anxious unecessarily.<br/>
<br/>
Should I give her the standard line, &quot;If you find yourself in a<br/>
situation where you or your companions are intoxicated, call home and<br/>
we will come get you, no questions asked&quot;?  It always sounded so<br/>
phoney to me, because I couldn&#39;t imagine a parent not talking to their<br/>
child about the situation afterwards (even if it is a week afterwards).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insights any of you can share,<br/>

I think the crucial point is not to punish a teen for calling for a <br/>
safer ride.  And lectures CAN be punishment.  But I don&#39;t necessarily <br/>

I was told that after two drinks I was supposed to call home and my parents would come get me. No questions.<br/>
Unfortunately, my father *often* drank more than two drinks and would STILL drive home. He set a bad <br/>
example. HIS bad!<br/>
 <br/>
I never called. At college, hell---I have NO idea *how* I got home some nights!<br/>
 <br/>
So, with Cameron, we said it, and we meant it. We&#39;ve picked him up four-five times, maybe? A couple of <br/>
times, he&#39;s opted to spend the night or leave his car there, get a ride with a friend, and have us take him <br/>
to his car the next morning. <br/>
 <br/>
He KNOWS his safety is much more important to us than anything else. And he TRUSTS us. We ALWAYS thank him <br/>
for calling us to pick him up or for letting us know that he&#39;s spending the night out.<br/>
 <br/>
That trust thang again---it&#39;s POWERFUL stuff!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>======================================<br/>
<br/>
Why recite a line?<br/>
Why add &quot;no questions asked?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Better to say &quot;Anytime you don&#39;t feel safe getting in the car with  <br/>
someone, call and I&#39;ll come and get you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That puts it more in the realm of principle than rule.  The first  <br/>
speech (&quot;standard line&quot;) requires her to judge intoxication, and it  <br/>
applies only to intoxication.  If the principle is safety, she might  <br/>
not want to get into a bald-tired little car on a snowy night, or  <br/>
might not want to get in with someone who has been too flirty and  <br/>
suggestive, or who&#39;s saying &quot;I have a couple of stops to make&quot; or  <br/>
anything.  Could be anything.<br/>
<br/>
I think encouraging her to say &quot;there&#39;s a pedestrian&quot; or &quot;Please  <br/>
don&#39;t go so fast&quot; or &quot;Your turn signal&#39;s still on&quot; or whatever is  <br/>
good too.  If parents don&#39;t give the standard speech about back seat  <br/>
driving, but they accept the critique of the passenger, that will  <br/>
make them feel more like helping new drivers remember things.  Marty  <br/>
is great at reminding me I need to be in a different lane so that I&#39;m  <br/>
not trying to squeeze in at the last moment.  I LIKE for him to tell  <br/>
me &quot;You need to be in the left lane.&quot;   Training a kid not to be &quot;a  <br/>
backseat driver&quot; isn&#39;t good.  It makes them powerless and voiceless.<br/>
<br/>
Some young drivers are better than some long-experienced drivers, too.<br/>

Instead of saying &quot;no questions&quot; maybe you could substitute the words &quot; no  <br/>
lectures&quot; nor &quot;punishments&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
It isn&#39;t phony if you mean it, and we did and are on child number 4 that  <br/>
we&#39;ve picked up at whatever time they called for whatever reason and there were  <br/>
no lectures and no punishments, sometimes no discussion other than where we  <br/>
needed to go to pick up a car or take another teen home that we also picked  up.<br/>
 <br/>
We didn&#39;t have some false sense that our children would never be drinking  or <br/>
impaired and so there was no need for long lectures or even much of a  <br/>
discussion about it, we just did it because we love them and want to help keep  them <br/>
safe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406847625">We did not say &quot;no questions asked&quot;.   But did assure our children (and even<br/>
sometimes their friends!?!)  that we did not need all the explanations right<br/>
that minute.....neither during the phone call NOR  during the ride home.<br/>
We talked of possible situations that could arise and that there were<br/>
probably many that I didn&#39;t think of (although in our household I am known<br/>
as the person who can imagine really, really farfetched scenarios :-)  ).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also spoke of (and were able to actually carry through on)  the common<br/>
possibility that when a child managed to get drunk when they were driving<br/>
themselves OR when a designated driver became impaired,    that the child<br/>
already feels bad about the situation and maybe just wants some space to<br/>
chill out, cool off, sleep it off, veg out, or whatever vernacular is used<br/>
these days. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Although we asked to be kept informed of where our children were when they<br/>
were in their teens,  we also said that if EVER  they were in a situation<br/>
where they felt uncomfortable they should call for a ride home even if it<br/>
meant we were coming to pick them up at a different place than they were<br/>
supposed to be or even a place we had suggested they NOT  be.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As my night vision got worse I also made it clear that I would gladly<br/>
reimburse them for cab fare.   Their safety and comfort is worth way more<br/>
than $20!  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Actually, intoxication was not always my biggest concern.   One of my sons<br/>
did most of the driving in his group because even HE  did not want to be in<br/>
some of his friends&#39; cars or any car driven by some of them!   So &quot;catching<br/>
a ride&quot; with someone else was not always a viable option. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids (and their friends)  considered that we were indeed rescuers and not<br/>
&quot;punishers&quot;   the few times over the years that we actually needed to go<br/>
out.   And we usually heard  the full story with all the gory  or sordid<br/>
details  later.    Along with discussions of  &quot;I can&#39;t believe I  got into<br/>
that situation!&quot;   and &quot;I think I can avoid the problem next time by doing<br/>
.....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Short version:  &quot;No questions&quot;   can mean &quot;no questions for the next 24<br/>
hours&quot; :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 18 yo calls me all the time to pick her up from parties (she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t drive yet). She goes to lots of parties - almost every  <br/>
weekend there is one - with the community college theater crowd. They  <br/>
go AFTER shows or late-night rehearsals - so the parties don&#39;t even  <br/>
get going until after 11 pm - she often calls me around 2 am. I go  <br/>
get her and sometimes she asks me to give someone else a ride home,  <br/>
too. We never talk about whether or not anybody was intoxicated - I  <br/>
KNOW they are drinking there, so what&#39;s to talk about? My daughter  <br/>
doesn&#39;t drink - and she usually comes home early from parties where  <br/>
everybody is drinking a lot and stays longer at parties where there  <br/>
is a group of non-drinkers or those who are drinking very little -  <br/>
just because it isn&#39;t that much fun to be with people who are  <br/>
drinking, when you&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
Teens riding in cars with other teens driving is a huge concern here  <br/>
- so much traffic (Southern California) - what we&#39;ve talked about is  <br/>
&quot;experience&quot; and &quot;good sense.&quot; I have to trust my kids to make the  <br/>
call - I can&#39;t judge. But the main thing I ask is that they try not  <br/>
to ride with inexperienced drivers, kids who seem easily distracted,  <br/>
or those who don&#39;t seem to have good sense, in general.<br/>
<br/>
Again - I&#39;m always VERY willing and eager to drive kids around. My  <br/>
willingness to spend my time driving here and there and picking up  <br/>
their friends, etc., means that they ride with other teens less  <br/>
often, but still......I admit it makes me very nervous, too.<br/>
