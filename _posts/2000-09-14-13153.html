<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391712517">We just returned from the fabric store.  It didn&#39;t even cross my mind that we <br/>
were out during school hours, because it&#39;s not an issue to me.  I got a good <br/>
(self-righteous?) chuckle over the grandmotherly types that were there making <br/>
their fabric purchases.  They knew it was school hours and here I was in a <br/>
store with a perfectly healthy looking 12 yr old boy!  Gasp!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Once I figured out why everyone was looking at us, I had no trouble ignoring <br/>
them.  Eventually, while we were looking at patterns with said 12 yr old boy, <br/>
one of the grandma-types started leaning across the table and talking with <br/>
us.  No one actually asked why we were there at that hour (okay by me), but <br/>
she was one of the women that looked shocked when we walked in.  She was <br/>
probably even more startled as we were talking about patterns because the <br/>
reason for our visit was to choose ds first sewing project.<br/>
<br/>
It was great.  I know you can all relate.  It&#39;s just my first school hours <br/>
&#39;exposure&#39; of the year (one car family and dh works out of town, I get out <br/>
when I can get a ride, so it took longer this year).  I always forget it may <br/>
be an &#39;issue&#39; for others.  We go out anyway and don&#39;t let the public school <br/>
schedule determine our plans.<br/>
