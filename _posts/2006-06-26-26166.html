<br/>
On the bitter cold night of January 30th, 1945, the former KdF Cruise  <br/>
Liner Wilhelm Gustloff, at the time serving as a barracks ship for  <br/>
the Kriegsmarine, left from the Baltic port of Gotenhafen and set  <br/>
sail for the relative safety of the west, away from the advance of  <br/>
Soviet forces that were converging on the region. The Gustloff,  <br/>
designed to carry a maximum of 1,865 people total, was transporting  <br/>
10,582 refugees, soldiers, sailors, and crew - including scores of  <br/>
sick and injured, as well as women, children and the elderly. All  <br/>
were fleeing from the terrible fate that awaited most of those left  <br/>
in the wake of the Soviet advance, including Germans and non-Germans  <br/>
alike.<br/>
<br/>
Every once in a while there&#39;s a new wave of interest among kids about  <br/>
shipwrecks.  The release of the new version of The Poseidon Adventure  <br/>
will likely spark that interest in some people, so I thought I&#39;d  <br/>
share this site I&#39;ve just come across in one of those random webcrawl  <br/>
ways.<br/>
