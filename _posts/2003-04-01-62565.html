<div id="ygrps-yiv-630782527">My mom was cleaning out her attic today and found some issues of <br/>
Child Life magazine from the 1940&#39;s.  In it was an advertisement for <br/>
Calvert curriculum, and it said something like, &quot;You can teach your <br/>
child at home by yourself without any training&quot;.  It also claimed <br/>
that thousands were already doing it.  <br/>
<br/>
She asked me if I knew anything about homeschooling in the 40s, and I <br/>
said that I really didn&#39;t but I am very curious.  I know John holt <br/>
was 60s/70s.  I&#39;m wondering if there was an already existing <br/>
homeschooling or even unschooling movement before John Holt?  <br/>
<br/>
I figured someone on this list might know.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>John Holt came to the conclusion that schools couldn&#39;t be fixed and that<br/>
homeschooling was better. So who were the homeschoolers he was using as a<br/>
reference and where did they get their ideas from?<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it Calvert was originally for missionaries and anyone else<br/>
who couldn&#39;t go to school. It&#39;s school in a box with *everything* (pencils,<br/>
paper, erasers, a programmed book of what to say to the child) someone who<br/>
has no access to stores would need to do the program.<br/>
<br/>
Back before public school -- for the privileged who had choices -- there<br/>
were a variety of choices: private school, tutors, apprentiships. People<br/>
were mostly limited by their station in life so if they did have choices,<br/>
parents based their choice on it&#39;s ability to get their child into the<br/>
position the parent chose for the child.<br/>
<br/>
In modern times, there have always been people who would choose school but<br/>
couldn&#39;t. And there have always been people who disdained learning so school<br/>
had no meaning for them. And there have been pockets and closed societies of<br/>
people who didn&#39;t want society&#39;s influence on their children and wanted to<br/>
control their children&#39;s learning themselves (Amish, utopian societies and<br/>
so forth).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some articles that Ann Zeise has collected: History of Homeschooling<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/weblinks/historyHS.htm">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/weblinks/historyHS.htm</a> The article<br/>
by Cheryl Seelhoff looks like a pretty good beginning.<br/>

<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a movement to encourage people to do it, but Calvert always <br/>
advertised in the back of National Geographic when I was a kid.  I&#39;d always <br/>
look at the ad and imagine who might be homescooled.  My whole list was this:<br/>
missionaries&#39; kids<br/>
delicate Victorian shut-ins like the girl in the movie version of Heidi (so I <br/>
had a visual)<br/>
hideously deformed elephant-man children<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t imagine others.  And the ads never made any suggestions.  They <br/>
were plain little heraldic looking things without any &quot;buy! BUY!&quot; copy.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was someone, Winifred someone (maybe someone here will know) who <br/>
was an eccentric genius who was homeschooled so that got some publicity <br/>
(1930&#39;s?) but not the best kind.  And it was more along the lines, I think, <br/>
of parents who press an early reader to go to college at the age of eight or <br/>
ten (which still occasionally happens).<br/>
<br/>
What is really certain is that the Christian homeschoolers&#39; version of the <br/>
history of homeschooling is of a kind of history with their reconstructed <br/>
American history, their villification of all native Americans, and [live with <br/>
it, don&#39;t go crazy] creationist science.  All of them are designed to further <br/>
their political agenda and to promote their own type of beliefs in other ways.<br/>

Stoner, W. S. (1914). Natural Education. Indianapolis: Bobbs Merrill.<br/>
<br/>
Stoner&#39;s early book describes in minute detail the homeschooling program of <br/>
her daughter, Winifred, from babyhood through middle childhood. Stoner&#39;s book <br/>
features the &quot;progressive thinking&quot; of the day, including chapters on <br/>
discipline, eugenics, world peace, and Esperanto. Stoner&#39;s philosophy was <br/>
very different from Berle&#39;s, though their books appeared the same year.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Tutored&quot; is what they used to call it.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there were English families who hired tutors instead of sending their <br/>
kids to schools even maybe early 20th century.  So they were &quot;schooled&quot; and <br/>
they were home, but it wasn&#39;t parental doing.  <br/>
<br/>
But I think Winifred was tutored by her mother.  (Maybe not.)<br/>
<br/>
Again we&#39;re back to the idea of teaching vs. learning, and the beliefs of the <br/>
parent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45837443">In one of the articles Joyce posted (Thanks Joyce!) it said the <br/>
Moores started homeschooling in 1944.  Theirs was the first <br/>
homeschooling book I ever read, back when my first child was 2 years <br/>
old.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right, they did push delayed academics and a relaxed <br/>
approach.  Not unschooling, but a lot closer to it (academically) <br/>
than Calvert.  <br/>
<br/>
I bet the total radical unschoolers back then were REALLY cool <br/>
people, because they didn&#39;t have anyone else to rely on, any books to <br/>
read.  It would have had to have been their own &quot;original&quot; idea to do <br/>
such a thing and they were willing to buck the law to do it.  <br/>

now and doing very well.  When the mother was at university, she decided to<br/>
get a teaching certificate *in case* she had kids and *in case* it might be<br/>
illegal to homeschool them with a certificate.  Most of the time she was<br/>
unschooling, the law here was vague, not illegal but not specifically legal.<br/>
