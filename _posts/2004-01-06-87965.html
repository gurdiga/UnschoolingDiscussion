<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785885897">This is a story of a boy...and a science fiction novel...and a computer game. <br/>
 And of a mother who is quietly doing handstands in her head (and planning a <br/>
vacation).<br/>
<br/>
Liam  had a busy end-of-week last week.  Over 5 days, he did *nothing* but go <br/>
to 3 New Year&#39;s Eve parties, go to a 12 hour interactive military strategy <br/>
computer game party, devour a 300 page science fiction book called _Ender&#39;s <br/>
Game_, all interespersed with constant D&D playing to fill in whatever cracks were <br/>
left after eating and sleeping a couple of hours a night wherever he and his <br/>
friends happened to collapse.  That&#39;s one heckuva wonderful, long holiday <br/>
weekend for a 15 year old.  (Ah, for the days when I had that much energy!)<br/>
<br/>
On his way home last night from this awesome weekend, all he could talk about <br/>
was the military strategy he&#39;d been struck by in the novel he&#39;d read, and how <br/>
he&#39;d found ways to apply what he&#39;d learned there to the computer strategy <br/>
game he&#39;d played.  He was fascinated, and insisted that I needed to read the <br/>
book, too.  I&#39;m not a fan of science fiction, but he was so enthused -- how could <br/>
I say no?  So, I began reading it right away.<br/>
<br/>
In the author&#39;s introduction, I found repeated references to Bruce Catton&#39;s <br/>
Civil War trilogy _The Army of the Potomac_, which apparently had had quite <br/>
some impact on the writer.  I happened to have the trilogy in my library, so <br/>
while Liam was taking a shower, I *strewed* the books in front of his computer.  <br/>
Soon, he was out, all excited, wondering where in the world I&#39;d gotten these?  <br/>
I&#39;ve had them since I was your age, I explained.  Round eyed wonder.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He began to read the first book before going to sleep.  (This being a boy who <br/>
was terribly damaged by ps, who has been actively deschooling in one way or <br/>
another for over 2 years, and who steadfastly refuses to read for information <br/>
-- as opposed to reading for pleasure.)<br/>
<br/>
This morning, we were headed off to an activity, and he bubbled all the way <br/>
about military strategy again, wishing that Catton&#39;s book had diagrams of the <br/>
battles depicted.  I offered to stop at the used bookstore on the way home to <br/>
look through their extensive military history section.  Cool!  (This from a boy <br/>
who hates, still, to go to the library, and spends his time at the bookstore <br/>
looking at graphic novels, comic books, and gaming manuals.)<br/>
<br/>
So, shop we did.  And hit the jackpot.  A book of the history of US land <br/>
battles from the Civil War to the Gulf War, complete with diagrams, and a copy of <br/>
Sun Tzu&#39;s _The Art of War_, a centuries-old Chinese classic on military <br/>
strategy and philosophy that is still taught at West Point today.  Liam was walking <br/>
on air as we left the store, and read snatches of Sun&#39;s book to me on the way <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
He also borught up an old idea we&#39;ve tossed around before about taking a <br/>
driving tour of Civil War battlefields, now expressing that he wanted to walk the <br/>
diagrams in the battle book.  Accordingly, when I got on the computer at home <br/>
I found him some links and forwarded them.  He&#39;s already working on a dream <br/>
sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Me?  I&#39;m absolutely dizzy.  From a science fiction novel to a computer <br/>
strategy game to a Civil War history classic to books on military strategy and <br/>
philosophy, to plans for a vacation to Civil War battlefields.<br/>
<br/>
What a trip!  Today...and to come.<br/>
<br/>
(Have I told y&#39;all lately how much I love unschooling?)<br/>

Raising my hand, over here, over here!! We have fantastic battlefields and <br/>
encampments and re-creations of the battles in our area all the time.  If you <br/>
need any information or help planning let me know.  I live just north of <br/>
Fredericksburg, just east of Manassas, just north east of New Market, just south of <br/>
Gettysburg (well a little more than &quot;just&quot; south, a couple hours).  LOTS of <br/>
civil war history all around and we really enjoy it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The sequels are different - not quite as action-oriented, for the most <br/>
part. I still REALLY liked them - but they might not appeal to younger <br/>
kids as much. The other related series - the &quot;shadow&quot; books - starting <br/>
with &quot;Ender&#39;s Shadow&quot; is the same way - the first one more <br/>
action-oriented. I REALLY liked all of these too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just finished reading this one and found it really compelling. I <br/>
liked it very very much. VERY different kind of book from the Enders <br/>
series.<br/>
<br/>
I also recently read his book called &quot;Treasure Box&quot; and it was again <br/>
very very different from any of the others. It is a ghost story - and <br/>
again very compelling characters and just a really different kind of <br/>
book!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if any of you have read the Alvin Maker series? How is it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten lots of the young teens in our homeschool group into <br/>
reading the Ender books recently - and some of their parents, too &lt;G&gt;. <br/>
Some great discussions happening based on them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-587400053">I&#39;ve read all of Orson Scott Card&#39;s books.  I found the single (non series)<br/>
book &quot;Enhantment&quot; the best.  He is a fabulous storyteller and even his women<br/>
from the Bible books are great stories.  If you liked &quot;Ender&#39;s Game&quot;, then<br/>
you really have to check out &quot;Ender&#39;s Shadow&quot;.  It is set at the exact same<br/>
time, same story, different person&#39;s (Bean&#39;s) perspective.  I enjoyed all of<br/>
the Ender and Bean books, but the first ones are the best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828426058">Laura,  The Enders Game series (4 books)is a favourite around here and Orson Scot Cards other books are as well.   Enchanted is a good take on sleeping beauty that even a guy could read and enjoy, the Alvin series Dh has only read the first book but said it&#39;s absolutely top notch (neither has anything to do with war strategy though).  The Air to the empire by Timothy Zahn is the only other fiction he can think of with war strategy, it&#39;s part of the Star Wars series.  He said The Art of War as well but you have that.<br/>
