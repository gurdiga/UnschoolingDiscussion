<div id="ygrps-yiv-296478033"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Nanci, it takes real courage to go against the norm and form your own<br/>
&gt;path.  With all due respect,  YOU, are the successful one in your<br/>
&gt;family!  Where does failure even enter the picture?   You have the<br/>
&gt;strength to not fail your children!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you so much.  I didn&#39;t mean to imply that &quot;I&quot; thought I was a failure, just that my parents and some of my siblings act dissappointed, as if I didn&#39;t &quot;live up to my potential.&quot;  That kind of BS.  I don&#39;t buy into it one bit, and I am happy and proud to have made the decisions that I did.  I feel no quilt for not fulfilling my parents agenda.  They had their lives, this one is mine.<br/>
