<div id="ygrps-yiv-754619657">Greetings!<br/>
<br/>
I am also in NJ...Atlantic County (near Atlantic City). We have been hs&#39;ing<br/>
about a year now. We tried &quot;school at home&quot; first...but realized fairly<br/>
quickly that it wasn&#39;t for us. I didn&#39;t have any real knowledge of<br/>
unschooling and no examples of it, so we stayed somewhat in &quot;limbo&quot; for a<br/>
little while, as I tried to figure things out. Meanwhile, my oldest started<br/>
doing a few things on her own, and so--here we are--unschooling (although dh<br/>
is still a bit concerned over it).<br/>
<br/>
