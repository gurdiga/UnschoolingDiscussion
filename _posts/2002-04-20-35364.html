A is for Arabs...<br/>
From algebra and coffee to guitars, optics and universities -- an<br/>
alphabetical reminder of what the West owes to the People of the Crescent<br/>
Moon; the much maligned Muslims.<br/>
<br/>
By George Rafael<br/>
<br/>
Jan. 8, 2002 | Even before Sept. 11 forced the West to face the cultural<br/>
friction between it and the Arab/Islamic world, there was an unwarranted<br/>
sense of superiority. The renowned Italian journalist and interviewer Oriana<br/>
Fallaci wrote Arab culture off as a few interesting architectural flourishes<br/>
and the Quran. Apparently, it&#39;s easy to forget that history is cyclical and<br/>
the roles were once reversed. A millennium ago, while the West was shrouded<br/>
in darkness, Islam enjoyed a golden age. Lighting in the streets of Cordoba<br/>
when London was a barbarous pit; religious tolerance in Toledo while<br/>
pogroms raged from York to Vienna. As custodians of our classical legacy,<br/>
Arabs were midwives to our Renaissance. Their influence, however alien it<br/>
might seem, has always been with us, whether it&#39;s a cup of steaming hot Joe<br/>
or the algorithms in computer programs. A little magnanimity is called for.<br/>
<br/>
A is for algebra<br/>
From &quot;al-jabr,&quot; Arabic for &quot;restoration,&quot; itself a transliteration of a<br/>
Latin term, and just one of many contributions Arab mathematicians have made<br/>
to the &quot;Queen of Sciences.&quot; Al-Khwarizmi (c.780-c.850), the chief librarian<br/>
of the observatory, research center and library called the House of Wisdom<br/>
in Baghdad, was the man responsible for making my life miserable at school.<br/>
The motivation behind his treatise, &quot;Hisab al-jabr w&#39;al-muqabala&quot;<br/>
(&quot;Calculation by Restoration and Reduction&quot;: widely used up to the 17th<br/>
century), which covers linear and quadratic equations, was to solve trade<br/>
imbalances, inheritance questions and problems arising from land surveyance<br/>
and allocation. In passing, he also introduced into common usage our present<br/>
numerical system, which replaced the old, cumbersome Roman one. Al-Karaji of<br/>
Baghdad (953-c.1029), founder of a highly influential school of algebraic<br/>
thought, defined higher powers and their reciprocals in his &quot;al-Fakhri&quot; and<br/>
showed how to find their products. He also looked at polynomials and gave<br/>
the rule for expanding a binomial, anticipating Pascal&#39;s triangle by more<br/>
than six centuries. Arab syntheses of Babylonian, Indian and Greek concepts<br/>
also led to important developments in arithmetic, trigonometry (the<br/>
algorithm, for instance, thanks to al-Khwarizmi) and spherical geometry.<br/>
<br/>
B is for backgammon<br/>
Sheshbesh is what it&#39;s called in Beirut and Cairo, whence the savviest<br/>
players hail. Although this beautiful waste of time dates back to the<br/>
pharaohs, the form we enjoy today came to us via Moorish Spain in the 10th<br/>
century. Ghioul and moultezim are two other variants of &quot;the game of<br/>
kings,&quot; popular wherever the happy hookah is indulged.<br/>
<br/>
C is for cough medicine<br/>
Necessity being the mother of invention, the Arabs were the first to distill<br/>
water, for long journeys across areas (such as the Sahara) where supplies<br/>
were uncertain. Their experiments with various chemical compounds also gave<br/>
us ethanol alcohol, sulfuric acid, ammonia (have you ever noticed the<br/>
uncanny resemblance between Mr. Clean and the genie in &quot;Thief of Baghdad&quot;?)<br/>
and mercury. In applied chemistry they discovered better and more efficient<br/>
ways for tanning leather and forging metals. Messing around with mortars and<br/>
pestles produced camphor, pomades and syrups.<br/>
<br/>
D is for Dante<br/>
Her countryman Silvio Berlusconi echoed Fallaci&#39;s ill-spoken sentiments<br/>
that, on the whole, Western civilization was superior to that of Islam. She<br/>
said she was quite happy with Dante, thank you very much. She spoke too<br/>
soon. Though the theory has long incited fierce debate, Dante may have been<br/>
acquainted with &quot;ascension literature,&quot; a fantastical literary genre that<br/>
deals with Mohammed&#39;s ascent to Heaven (using a spiraling, magical ladder;<br/>
ascension literature is still popular in the Middle East and Africa). Dante<br/>
was undoubtedly acquainted with Avicenna and Averroes (&quot;who made the great<br/>
commentary&quot;), assigned as they are to that benign circle of the Inferno<br/>
reserved for pagan and non-Christian worthies known as Limbo.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, according to the dean of Arabic literary studies, the formidable<br/>
Robert Irwin, &quot;a full understanding of the writings of Voltaire, Dickens,<br/>
Melville, Proust and Borges, or indeed of the origins of science fiction,<br/>
is impossible without some familiarity with the stories of the Arabian<br/>
Nights.&quot;  Aladdin, Sinbad the Sailor, Ali Baba and Scheherazade, archetypes<br/>
each and every one, are honorary members of the Western canon. The mock,<br/>
allegorical travelogues and cautionary tales of  Montesquieu, Voltaire,<br/>
Johnson and other18th-century writers and philosophes, are inconceivable<br/>
without the garrulous, wayward conceits of &quot;The Arabian Nights.&quot; They&#39;re<br/>
detectable as well in the parodic chivalry of Don Quixote and in Calvino&#39;s<br/>
postmodern children&#39;s fable &quot;Marcovaldo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
E is for equestrian<br/>
Although the ancestors of Mr. Ed and Secretariat probably originated in<br/>
Central Asia (with the &quot;Heavenly Horses&quot; of the King of Ferghana), our<br/>
equine friends were first bred for speed in the desert sands of the Empty<br/>
Quarter. Arab historian al-Kelbi (c. 786) traced the Arabian to the<br/>
pedigreed horses of Bax, great-great-great grandson of Noah. The conquest of<br/>
the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa and Spain was due in no small part to<br/>
the aptly named beast (and the indefatigable camel), mount of choice for<br/>
the tribesmen who swept all in their path. The descendents of these terrible<br/>
swift steeds were brought to the New World by the Conquistadors, to<br/>
devastating effect,  particularly in ancient Peru where the Incas mistook<br/>
the horsemen for gods. (By the time they learned the truth it was too late.)<br/>
Appropriately enough, the largest and most successful stable today belongs<br/>
to Sheikh Maktoum of Dubai.<br/>
<br/>
F is for Fitzgerald<br/>
Edward, translator of that beloved chestnut of yore, &quot;The Rubáiyát of Omar<br/>
Khayyám&quot; (a jug of wine, a loaf of bread -- and thou). My concern here, of<br/>
course, is not with Fitzgerald, nice duffer though he was, but with Khayyám<br/>
himself (1048-1131) -- gifted physician, Persian bard and geometer<br/>
extraordinaire. In his seminal &quot;Algebra&quot; he attempted a fusion of algebraic<br/>
and geometric methods, discussing the solution of cubic equations by<br/>
geometric means, anticipating analytical geometry. (Descartes took up this<br/>
thread 500 years later, though it&#39;s unlikely he knew Khayyám&#39;s work.)<br/>
Khayyám also dabbled in astronomy, his lunar calculations leading him to<br/>
reform the calendar in 1079 (there are references to this throughout the<br/>
Rubáiyát). Furthermore, Islamic astronomers invented the pendulum, improved<br/>
upon the sundial, prognosticated the existence of sunspots and studied<br/>
eclipses and comets. And al-Biruni calculated the length of the solar year<br/>
to within 24 seconds and discussed the earth&#39;s rotation on its axis -- 500<br/>
years before Galileo. Arabian and Islamic astronomers also constructed the<br/>
first observatories, in Toledo, Cordoba, Baghdad and Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
G is for guitar<br/>
If the Moors had known they would be responsible for the spectacle of Mick<br/>
Jagger shaking his scrawny ass onstage into his late 50s, they might have<br/>
thought twice about schlepping the early prototypes of the instruments that<br/>
make up the typical rock band to Spain and Southern Italy. Percussion in the<br/>
form of cymbals and timpani, bowed instruments, the lute (from &quot;al-ud,&quot; the<br/>
wood; see &quot;The Buena Vista Social Club&quot; for more), the Spanish guitar (or<br/>
guitarra morisca as it was originally called 800 years ago), the zither<br/>
(brought west from Greece), the dulcimer began keeping the neighbors awake<br/>
as early as the 9th century. There&#39;s also that unique Near Eastern sound and<br/>
rhythm, which, aside from early Spanish music, made itself felt in<br/>
18th-century classical music, most famously in Mozart&#39;s &quot;The Abduction from<br/>
the Seraglio.&quot; (Turkish things were so &quot;in&quot; then. Witness all those<br/>
wonderfully exotic 18th-century Venetian scenes by Longhi and Reynolds&#39;<br/>
costumed, turbaned toffs.) Miles Davis accented the &quot;Oriental,&quot; Near Eastern<br/>
strain in his &quot;Sketches of Spain.&quot; The godfather of world music, Davis<br/>
incorporated Middle Eastern elements into his fusion of jazz and rock in the<br/>
late &#39;60s and &#39;70s. Nowadays nobody thinks twice about such hybridization.<br/>
<br/>
H is for &quot;Havi&quot;<br/>
Expanding on the legacy of the Greek physician and philosopher Galen was<br/>
Rhazes (c. 865-c. 930), the greatest doctor of the Middle Ages. His<br/>
extensive medical treatise in nine volumes, &quot;Havi&quot; (&quot;The Virtuous Life&quot;),<br/>
was used as a textbook in the Sorbonne as late as 1395. In addition to case<br/>
studies and clinical reports that still have anecdotal interest, Rhazes<br/>
also wrote a celebrated monograph on smallpox. (Knock wood.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Book of Healing,&quot; by the Persian physician and philosopher Avicenna<br/>
(980-1037), is a masterwork on hygiene and therapeutics that was used as a<br/>
reference well into the 16th century. With Averroes (1126-1198), the<br/>
Andalusian physician and philosopher, Arabian medicine attained its peak.<br/>
Muslim surgeons in the 11th century knew how to treat cataracts and internal<br/>
hemorrhaging, and they pioneered the usage of anesthetics, which they<br/>
derived from herbs. Arabian hospitals anticipated our modern ones in<br/>
combining teaching facilities and libraries, and in offering<br/>
specializations such as internal medicine, opthamology, orthopedics and<br/>
pharmacology (on the last, Ibn al-Bayter, who died in 1248, described 1,400<br/>
different medicines of vegetable and mineral origin alone). They also set<br/>
standards for cleanliness and hygiene that in the West shamefully weren&#39;t<br/>
met till the 19th century.<br/>
<br/>
I is for Ibn Khaldun of Tunis (1332-1406)<br/>
He invented the scientific study of history (and, indirectly it could be<br/>
argued, sociology) centuries before the French Enlightenment, Hegel, Weber<br/>
and Braudel. His &quot;Muqaddimah&quot; (&quot;The Prolegomena&quot;), the introduction to a<br/>
general survey of Islamic history with a specific focus on North Africa, was<br/>
begun in 1377 and updated several times to account for sociopolitical<br/>
changes. In it, he attempts to order the raw material and outward phenomena<br/>
of history under basic principles.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wise and ignorant are at one in appreciating history, since in its external<br/>
aspect it is no more than narratives telling us how circumstances<br/>
revolutionize the affairs of men, but in its internal aspect it involves an<br/>
accurate perception of the causes and origins of phenomena. For this reason<br/>
it is based on and deeply rooted in philosophy, worthy to be reckoned among<br/>
its branches.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Human society in its various manifestations shows certain inherent features<br/>
by which all narratives must be controlled ... The historian who relies<br/>
solely upon tradition and who has no thorough understanding of the<br/>
principles governing the normal course of events, the fundamental rules of<br/>
the art of government, the nature of civilization and the characteristics of<br/>
human society is seldom secure against straying from the highway of truth<br/>
... All traditional narratives must invariably be referred back to general<br/>
principles and controlled by reference to fundamental rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of Olympian detachment, Ibn Khaldun was less prone than most historians,<br/>
then and now, to fiddle the books and force facts to fit preconceived<br/>
theories. He saw that the course of history is governed by the balance of<br/>
two forces, which for him were the nomadic and the settled life. He<br/>
identified history with civilization and, having established this theory,<br/>
expounded in minute detail upon civilization in all its religious,<br/>
administrative, economic, artistic and scientific layers.<br/>
<br/>
Ibn Khaldun briefly made headlines in the early 1980s, when President Reagan<br/>
quoted him in a speech. His name mystified the White House press corps,<br/>
driving them to their encyclopedias to bone up on this Ibn guy; within hours<br/>
they were speaking knowledgeably of him. As an undergraduate at the time, I<br/>
was taking a yearlong seminar entitled &quot;Oriental Humanities.&quot; One of our<br/>
assigned texts in the Arabian section was &quot;Muqqadimah.&quot; Professor Meskill,<br/>
an old China hand, informed us of the Great Communicator&#39;s &quot;erudition.&quot; We<br/>
all had a good laugh.<br/>
<br/>
J is for jihad<br/>
This word, which has been misinterpreted as &quot;religious war&quot; but really means<br/>
&quot;an effort&quot; or &quot;striving,&quot; is one of many Arabic words that have entered the<br/>
English language. Besides mullah and ayatollah, which have also acquired<br/>
pejorative connotations, a partial list of Arabic words or derivatives<br/>
thereof includes: alcohol, orange, coffee, sofa, caravan, tariff (from<br/>
Tarifa -- the village through which the Moors invaded Spain, near<br/>
Gibraltar), citrus, lemon, alembic, algebra, chess, sugar, cataract,<br/>
magazine, seraphim, arsenal (also the name of a London soccer club, Osama<br/>
bin Laden&#39;s favorite, appropriately enough), apricot, sandal, Satan (from<br/>
&quot;Shaitan,&quot; the Evil One), rice (from &quot;al-ruzz&quot;), sherbet and sorbet,<br/>
talisman, artichoke, rack (from &quot;arrack,&quot; perspiration, also the name of<br/>
the fiery spirit, raqi; wrack your brains on that one), almanac, alcove,<br/>
albatross (from &quot;al-kadas,&quot; which the Portuguese corrupted into &quot;alcatraz&quot;;<br/>
now what would the author of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; make of that?), castle (from<br/>
&quot;alcazar&quot;), albacore, Abyssinia, ginger, ghoul, zircon (from which we derive<br/>
&quot;jargon,&quot; one being a mixture of stones, the other of tongues), banana (from<br/>
&quot;banan,&quot; finger or toes), nadir, zenith, cipher, zero and monsoon (from<br/>
&quot;mausim,&quot; or season).<br/>
<br/>
K is for kebab<br/>
Next time you&#39;re munching on a Nathans, or, in my case, disputing the<br/>
nutritional value of chorizo with the missus, you have the Moor to thank.<br/>
Cured meats and sausages and the humble kebab, usually lamb or beef (never<br/>
pork), were among the culinary delights that came to Europe via Islamic<br/>
Spain. Likewise the hotter spices and spicier condiments. The Moors were<br/>
also the first to crystallize sugar (which they also brought to Europe).<br/>
<br/>
L is for latte<br/>
As you sip one of those wimpy, froufrou confections in Starbucks, think<br/>
about this: Arabica. Yes, the humble coffee bean. First cultivated and<br/>
brewed as rocket fuel by Yemeni tribesman way back when -- though it&#39;s<br/>
disputed whether the beans were transplanted from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to<br/>
the Arabian Peninsula or whether it was the other way around. As an<br/>
afterthought, we might not now have this plague of Starbucks and chi-chi<br/>
cafes were it not for the Ottoman Turks, the Viennese getting the clever<br/>
idea of the coffeehouse from them in the late 17th century.<br/>
<br/>
M is for mosque<br/>
Funny, thinking about what Oriana Fallaci said earlier, the architectural<br/>
flourish commonly attributed to the Moors, the curved arch, was actually<br/>
copied from the Visigoths in Spain. Byzantine art and architecture, above<br/>
all the Hagia Sophia in what was then Constantinople, had a profound<br/>
influence on Islamic builders and artisans. However, it&#39;s the humble church<br/>
steeple (via the mighty cathedral tower) that has an Islamic antecedent,<br/>
the minaret.<br/>
<br/>
N is for navigation<br/>
Without Arabian improvements upon the compass, the astrolabe, nautical maps<br/>
and seaworthy lanterns, Magellan, Cabot, Vasco da Gama, Columbus, et al.,<br/>
might have had trouble pulling anchor and leaving port. The Arabs also<br/>
pioneered the usage of hydraulic presses and water clocks, which tracked<br/>
the passage of time and phases of the moon.<br/>
<br/>
O is for optics<br/>
The concept of camera obscura, which is indispensable to the later<br/>
development of photography, was first suggested in &quot;The Treatise on<br/>
Optics,&quot; by Hassan Ali Aitan (963-1009).<br/>
<br/>
P is for paradise<br/>
Consider the varieties of roses -- the damask and the gallica, to name the<br/>
two most common -- brought to Europe through Spain and Southern Italy by the<br/>
Moor. Perhaps a rose is a rose is a rose, but what signifies here is where<br/>
they&#39;re planted, and to Islamic sages and poets, gardens were symbolic of<br/>
the paradise to come, a &quot;blue green&quot; paradise, blue for water, naturally,<br/>
and green for greenery. The word &quot;paradise&quot; is of Persian origin<br/>
(&quot;paradaeza&quot;); it literally means garden. Paradise as a garden or pleasure<br/>
ground with swaying houris (heavenly handmaidens), the one that&#39;s promised<br/>
to good male Muslims, figures heavily in the Quran, in contrast to Genesis<br/>
where the Garden of Eden is a paradise lost. (And there are no houris in the<br/>
Old Testament and definitely none in the New; is it any wonder Islam won so<br/>
many converts?)<br/>
<br/>
Q is for Qasim<br/>
Can you name the mystical Sufi poet who inspired Spiritual Girl Madonna to<br/>
whirl like a dervish in &quot;Speed of Light&quot;? The one who is beloved by Demi<br/>
Moore, quoted by Deepak Chopra and read by New Age ninnies from Beverly<br/>
Hills to Notting Hill? (None of this, incidentally, should be held against<br/>
him.) A Persian of Greek descent, who&#39;s up there in the Persian pantheon<br/>
with Attar, Firdausi, Hafiz, Khayyam and Sadi? OK, OK, you know already:<br/>
It&#39;s Jalad&#39;din , but actually before him there was another, more carnal<br/>
Rumi. Ibn al-Rumi (836-896) was an expansive, unforgettable, larger than<br/>
life figure, Walt Whitman and Dylan Thomas rolled into one. He was<br/>
magnificently ugly, unkempt and unwashed, pugnacious and ferociously<br/>
sarcastic (&quot;Those who kiss ass shouldn&#39;t complain of wind&quot;), promiscuous,<br/>
gluttonous, bibulous, blasphemous and irredeemably bohemian -- and he<br/>
wondered why he couldn&#39;t get a position at court. And Qasim, you ask? He<br/>
was the Caliph&#39;s vizier, who, fearful of the poet&#39;s wicked tongue,<br/>
graciously poisoned him at supper. Rumi, though, had the last laugh. Upon<br/>
quaffing the fatal potion and having a good burp, Rumi rose to leave. Qasim<br/>
asked where he was off to, and Rumi replied he was going where the vizier<br/>
had sent him. &quot;In that case, convey my greetings to my father,&quot; Qasim said,<br/>
thinking himself very witty. &quot;I am not going to the fires of hell,&quot; Rumi<br/>
replied. (Well, I needed something for Q.)<br/>
<br/>
R is for religious tolerance and racial equality<br/>
Yes, hard as that might be for some to believe, Islam was the first major<br/>
religion, certainly the first monotheistic one, to practice religious<br/>
tolerance. Not that Muslim tribesmen didn&#39;t put to the sword those who<br/>
refused to convert -- they committed their fair share of well-documented<br/>
massacres early on -- but military success came so swiftly to them and on<br/>
such a vast scale, that they found themselves burdened with an empire, and<br/>
needed all the help they could get from their cleverer subjects to run it.<br/>
They were, after all, warriors, not administrators. As rulers they were<br/>
lenient, even generous (unlike the Germanic tribes that ravaged the late<br/>
Roman Empire). Besides, Jews and Christians were &quot;People of the Book&quot; --<br/>
Islam borrowed much from its elders; Abraham, Moses and Christ are<br/>
recognized prophets in the Koran -- and as long as they paid their tithe to<br/>
the Caliph and kept out of trouble, they were free to do as they wished (the<br/>
Zoroastrians in Persia were treated in similar fashion). &quot;Holy Toledo,&quot; the<br/>
meeting point of the three great religions, became a model of religious<br/>
tolerance and harmony -- an idyll that ended when the Christian kings of the<br/>
north recaptured it in 1085. (Until the rise of Holland in the 17th century,<br/>
if you were Jewish it was generally better for your overall health and<br/>
well-being to live in Muslim lands such as North Africa, the Levant or<br/>
Turkey than almost anywhere in Christendom, particularly those places where<br/>
Catholicism prevailed. French missionaries are to blame for introducing the<br/>
virus of anti-Semitism to the Middle East in the 19th century.) Of the three<br/>
great thinkers who flourished under Islamic rule, one was non-Muslim,<br/>
Maimonides of Cordoba (1135-1204), author of &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed,&quot;<br/>
who was Jewish. Like Avicenna and his fellow Cordoban, Averroes, Maimonides<br/>
attempted to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with religious belief. He<br/>
died in Alexandria, where he founded the great synagogue.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding race, Islam is colorblind, which came as a surprise to Malcolm X<br/>
on his pilgrimage to Mecca, where he found himself worshipping alongside<br/>
blond-haired, blue-eyed white devils. Unlike Christianity, which justified<br/>
racial slavery (blacks were inferior, less than human and so forth) by<br/>
citing Ham in the Old Testament, Islam emphasized the equality of man before<br/>
the eyes of God, whether black or white, rich or poor, man or woman. But,<br/>
as we all know, what is preached isn&#39;t necessarily what is practiced. The<br/>
cruel irony of Malcolm X&#39;s revelation, which challenged his ideas and<br/>
changed the course of his life, was that he had it in a country that didn&#39;t<br/>
abolish slavery until 1973. (Slavery exists today, despite claims to the<br/>
contrary, in Mauritania and in the Sudan, both Muslim nations, the latter a<br/>
fundamentalist state that has prosecuted a genocidal war against its<br/>
southern, African half for more than 20 years. None of this, of course, was<br/>
brought up at the United Nations conference on slavery in September.) And<br/>
although the British, Dutch and Portuguese dominated the Atlantic slave<br/>
trade in Caryl Philips&#39; &quot;Atlantic Sound,&quot; the Arabs held a firm whip hand in<br/>
East Africa, built entire ports and cities devoted solely to that very<br/>
profitable end, and played a significant role as middlemen throughout the<br/>
continent. Still, it is good to know that Islam is colorblind.<br/>
<br/>
S is for shatranj<br/>
Although modern chess originated in Northern India in the 7th century A.D.,<br/>
where it was called chaturanga, it was introduced to Spain and Sicily a<br/>
century later by Moorish invaders and Saracen traders. Shatranj, which<br/>
means &quot;king&#39;s game&quot; (shah tranj), differs slightly from the game we know<br/>
today,  in that instead of a queen there was a firzan, and in place of the<br/>
bishop there was a fil (of course). The game was slower, with pawns allowed<br/>
to advance but one square in the opening and no castling allowed. Victory<br/>
came from checkmate (from the Persian, &quot;Shah mat,&quot; the King is lost or<br/>
helpless), stalemate or a &quot;bare king&quot; (the king alone, like Richard III at<br/>
Bosworth Field). Some caliphs played &quot;living chess&quot; -- human pieces, slaves<br/>
or prisoners -- the downside for the participants being possible<br/>
decapitation if one was captured. As depicted by the Elizabethan playwright<br/>
Christopher Marlowe, Tamburlaine -- in real life infamous for the Sack of<br/>
Baghdad in which a million people died -- was fond of this pastime.<br/>
<br/>
T is for turban<br/>
Let&#39;s face it, the turban, the burnoose, that wild and crazy Arafat thingy<br/>
the college kids love to wear, whatever you wish to call it, is a brilliant<br/>
fashion accessory. Imagine Edith Sitwell, Audrey Hepburn or David Hume<br/>
without theirs; you can&#39;t, can you? With a little bit of water moistened<br/>
about the inside you have a portable air conditioner. The turban was an<br/>
early instance of form following function, though I have a feeling Sitwell,<br/>
Hepburn and Hume were unaware of all this. Speaking of turbans, you need the<br/>
right setting for one, too, something out of an odalisque by Ingres or<br/>
Matisse: muslin, damask, chintz to cover sofas and pillows -- Moorish<br/>
appurtenances on which to seat your little keester and to rest your weary<br/>
head -- while being fanned by eunuchs, of course.<br/>
<br/>
U is for university<br/>
The concept of the university originated with the madrassas, which were<br/>
centers devoted to religious instruction, as they are in considerably less<br/>
cosmopolitan forms in Muslim nations today. The first madrassas in Spain,<br/>
in Malaga, Zaragoza and Cordoba, which later evolved into universities,<br/>
started in the 11th century. The foundation of Damascus University dates<br/>
back to the 8th century.<br/>
<br/>
V is for venetian glass<br/>
Venetian glass blowers, famed for their miraculously intricate and delicate<br/>
creations, learned their secrets from the Arabs (and went on to monopolize<br/>
the glass trade for centuries). Islamic artisans and craftsmen, renowned for<br/>
their ceramics, armory and masonry, made a deep impression on their<br/>
Spanish, French and Italian counterparts. One could easily compose an<br/>
alphabet of objects, decorative and otherwise, from Aubusson tapestries to<br/>
the engravings on Zildjian cymbals, that bear traces of Arabic and Islamic<br/>
design and calligraphy.<br/>
<br/>
W is for watermelon<br/>
This is just one of the many crops the Arabs introduced to the West. Others<br/>
include artichokes, rice, cotton, asparagus, oranges (from &quot;naranj&quot;),<br/>
lemons, limes, figs, dates, spinach and eggplants. Arab methods of<br/>
irrigation, which made the desert bloom, are still utilized today in North<br/>
Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, as are the wells and aqueducts they built.<br/>
<br/>
X is for Xenophon<br/>
Have you heard of him? Friend of Socrates and Plato, guest at the Symposium,<br/>
author of a treatise on horses (the Hippike), Xenophon, in truth, was a bit<br/>
of bore. Nevertheless, we&#39;re better off for knowing him because of the<br/>
company he kept. Aristotle was a special favorite of Islamic scholars and<br/>
thinkers such as Avicenna and Averroes, particularly for his &quot;Ethics.&quot; Much<br/>
of what remains of the Greek classics was salvaged, translated -- into<br/>
classical Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, Persian and vernacular languages such as<br/>
Castillian -- and interpreted under the aegis of the Arabs, with<br/>
non-Muslims, anonymous scribes and great thinkers alike playing their parts<br/>
(Maimonides comes to mind). Contrary to popular belief, it was Christian<br/>
fanatics who sacked the Great Library of Alexandria (they followed up with a<br/>
pogrom), decades before Muhammad was born.<br/>
<br/>
Y is for the yearning one (el taleb)<br/>
Like Scotsmen and their kilts, there&#39;s more going on under those burqas than<br/>
you might think. El taleb, or &quot;the yearning one,&quot; is one of the 46 different<br/>
kinds of vulvae described in the ninth chapter of the Arabian equivalent of<br/>
&quot;The Kama Sutra,&quot; &quot;The Perfumed Garden of the Shaykh Nefzawi,&quot; translated by<br/>
my favorite roaming Brit (a very short list, that), the randy Sir Richard<br/>
Burton. &quot;This vagina is met with in a few women only. With some it is<br/>
natural; with others it becomes what it is by long abstinence. It is burning<br/>
for a member, and having got one in its embrace, it refuses to part with it<br/>
until its fire is completely extinguished&quot;; talk about vagina monologues.<br/>
(Note, fair ladies, there&#39;s a similar chapter on male equipment.) Other<br/>
chapters deal with the act of generation, with praiseworthy men and women,<br/>
with contemptible men and women, with positions other than the missionary<br/>
(mullah position, anyone?), with arousal techniques, with impotence and<br/>
sterility, with pregnancy, and so on and so forth. In contrast to the early<br/>
Christians, the Arabs had a refreshing view of sex -- it was for pleasure,<br/>
too, not just procreation.<br/>
<br/>
Z is for zero<br/>
From &quot;zefira,&quot; or cipher. Nought, nothing, nil. What a concept. Carried over<br/>
from India to the West by the Arabs. Less than zero? Well, you&#39;re getting<br/>
into negative numbers there ...<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hi! I&#39;m new<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hi! I&#39;m Valerie<br/>
&gt; We are new to unschooling but have been homeschooling for 7 years. One<br/>
&gt; year I lost my head and taught at a private school for tuition so my<br/>
&gt; children could attend. Anyway, I won&#39;t go into that.<br/>
&gt; We live in Camp LeJeune, NC. My DH is a Navy man of 14 years.<br/>
&gt; I have 3 kids, dd 14, dd 11, ds 9.<br/>
&gt; I have always tried to get around NOT doing some of our workbooks and I<br/>
&gt; never felt good about going over the same material over and over again.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I know you have heard the same thing from others. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; quite typical.<br/>
&gt; I have been lurking for most of the day.<br/>
&gt; I have a little opinion on the TV issue. Well, there are many rabbit<br/>
&gt; trails on here about them. :O)<br/>
&gt; I just wanted to introduce myself before I jumped in! :O)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about suicide bombers lately and I<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to wonder what happens to make them willing to do that?  How desperate<br/>
&gt; &gt; do their lives have to be?  How much have they lost hope that things<br/>
&gt; &gt; can improve?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From what we have learned the bombers don&#39;t believe that their lives are<br/>
&gt; desperate, bad or lacking in any way. They find that the Western culture<br/>
&gt; with all of it&#39;s modernization and frills is very evil, as well as any<br/>
&gt; modernization on that side of the world.<br/>
&gt; Starvation is considered the norm and violence is a part of their<br/>
&gt; religion.<br/>
&gt; They kill themselves because they are taught that this life has no value<br/>
&gt; whatsoever and paradise awaits them when they discard their earthly<br/>
&gt; flesh. When they murder innocent people they believe that they are being<br/>
&gt; merciful to those people by ending their corrupted lives. These bombers<br/>
&gt; are taught from their earliest youth that the only reason they are alive<br/>
&gt; is to die in &quot;Holy Jihad&quot; and to be with Allah very soon.<br/>
&gt; Notice that the bombers are very young, most not even in their 30&#39;s. I<br/>
&gt; think that their government has intensified it&#39;s teachings of Holy Jihad<br/>
&gt; in the last couple of decades.<br/>
&gt; The Navy is serving the Detainees and POW&#39;s in Camp X-Ray. My husband is<br/>
&gt; attached to the fleet hospital down there. He didn&#39;t have to go as he<br/>
&gt; was with Division at the time the hospital moved down there and he was<br/>
&gt; &quot;left behind&quot; (though he stands a 50/50 right now of having to deploy in<br/>
&gt; September for the change over.) The docs that come back are telling us<br/>
&gt; how young the detainees are. The average age is 15. Their lives were so<br/>
&gt; rugged that they can&#39;t believe the excellent treatment they are getting<br/>
&gt; in Camp X-ray!<br/>
&gt; They have never known what medical care really is! Needless to say,<br/>
&gt; quite a few claim to defect. But I don&#39;t believe it. They are so<br/>
&gt; brainwashed into the Jihad thing, it will take a lot to turn around that<br/>
&gt; powerfully evil teaching.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, don&#39;t want to get off on a tangent. :O) But this is an<br/>
&gt; interesting subject and my children and I have been following since<br/>
&gt; Sept. 11 as closely as possible.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for letting me share.<br/>

&gt; I have put a lot lot lot of thought into that also and I really can not<br/>
&gt; come<br/>
&gt; up with anything.  Are they doing this from loyalty, from fear of some<br/>
&gt; kind<br/>

&gt; brainwashed, are they mind controlled by maybe drugs and other things?<br/>

<br/>
This is way off topic, and I apologize for prolonging it, but if you read <br/>
what people hope to gain for their own people by defying what they consider <br/>
to be evil, then the motivation seems clear.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not being hopeless.  It&#39;s being hopeFUL that the defiance of even <br/>
everyday people can defend their homes and relatives from what they see as <br/>
ungodly cruelty.<br/>
<br/>
In the Middle Ages, Christian crusaders did some horrible things.  But they <br/>
had been assured that if they died on crusade they would go straight to <br/>
heaven regardless of other sins.  And even pilgrims, travelling to religious <br/>
shrines (Jerusalem, Rome, or just local stuff) were guaranteed immunity from <br/>
hell while they were on pilgrimage.<br/>
<br/>
Japanese kamikazi pilots.  Martyred saints.  Buddhist priests who have <br/>
protested with self-immolation.   They weren&#39;t stupid people.  There was much <br/>
thought and hope behind their actions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614883085">The motivation is that the land has been illegally occupied since the israeli state was chartered and sanctioned by the UN.<br/>
All Palestinians were displaced unjustly.  It had nothing to do with religion, it still doesn&#39;t.  This is a land issue.<br/>
<br/>
If I moved into your house and despite the police telling me that I can&#39;t stay there, I remain and then I invite everyone I know to move in as well, wouldn&#39;t that upset you just a tad?  This has been going on for  50 years.  The camps have been set up for 45 years.  Palestinians have been displaced.  The Israelis are considered &quot;occupying forces&quot;.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044015432">The history of that region was stable until the UK and US came up with a<br/>
brain fart that resulted in the UN carving out a chunk of land to be given<br/>
to the Jews as Israel.  Israel has been at war with its neighbors since that<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
The main problem is the same as it would be if a segment of the population<br/>
in the town you live in was suddenly given rights to a section of the town<br/>
and then started &quot;expanding&quot; their land holdings and wanting more and more<br/>
of your town.<br/>
<br/>
right now you have the Israelis taking over parts of Palestine, they have<br/>
stationed troups in the homes of Palestinians, they have shelled hospitals,<br/>
schools and residential neighborhoods.  This has been going on since 1999<br/>
and is getting worse by the day.  last week they shelled a refugee camp.<br/>
<br/>
The US is seen as a bad guy because they provide money and weapons to the<br/>
Israelis.  The &quot;war&quot; is rather lopsided because the Israelis have tanks,<br/>
jets, helicopters and other weapons either provided by the US or bought with<br/>
US funds, about $5 BILLION per year to be exact.  The Palestinians who are<br/>
only trying to take back their own land are fighting with old rifles,<br/>
PERIOD!<br/>
<br/>
they have spent years petitioning the US, the UK and the UN to no avail.<br/>
The only relief they see is in the form of the Hamas and the suicide<br/>

This is not to say that it is right or an excuse, it is an explanation of<br/>
why things are the way they are.<br/>

&gt; &gt; No, not all are muslim, there are arab christians and jews as well.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Indonesia and Asia.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But why would an Arab Jew or Christian become a suicide bomber to kill<br/>
&gt; Isreali Jews? I don&#39;t understand the motivation...?<br/>

I&#39;d be very interested in hearingmore of your thoughts on the middle <br/>
east conflict.  I&#39;d also like to know where you are from - do you <br/>
have a connection to that area?  But if you don&#39;t want to answer I <br/>
will understand.<br/>

&gt; The motivation is that the land has been illegally occupied since <br/>
the israeli state was chartered and sanctioned by the UN.<br/>
&gt; All Palestinians were displaced unjustly.  It had nothing to do with <br/>
religion, it still doesn&#39;t.  This is a land issue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I moved into your house and despite the police telling me that I <br/>
can&#39;t stay there, I remain and then I invite everyone I know to move <br/>
in as well, wouldn&#39;t that upset you just a tad?  This has been going <br/>
on for  50 years.  The camps have been set up for 45 years.  <br/>
Palestinians have been displaced.  The Israelis are considered <br/>
&quot;occupying forces&quot;.  They won&#39;t leave.<br/>

Sure, which thoughts?  The ones that condemn Israel or the ones that condemn muslim majority countries for thinking more about personal wealth and status than Islam?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m from the US, have lived here all my life.<br/>
<br/>
Tanz food is good, I prefer greek and indian food (and occassionaly chinese food)...  Anything with curry has my vote.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319446975">Both actually.  I think Isreal is wrong.  I think the money grubbing <br/>
oil sheiks are wrong.  But I&#39;m not sure I know enough about the <br/>
everyday common people in the region to understand their feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Something in a book I read last night strikes me as appropriate inthis <br/>
thread.<br/>
If you are in power over someone, you don&#39;t just have the priveledges <br/>
to lead them.  You also have the responsibity to protect them from <br/>
harm.  If you aren&#39;t doing both, you aren&#39;t truly a leader.<br/>
