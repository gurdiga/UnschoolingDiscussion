<div id="ygrps-yiv-6059880">Ya know, you aren&#39;t suppose to pull complete articles onto lists, it is<br/>
called infringement of copyright laws.  You are suppose to provide a link<br/>

who use thinly veiled racism to make their points.  Also, I thought this<br/>
was an inclusive list, not a Christian list.  Did I get this wrong???<br/>

And, how about a reality check here.  This game isn&#39;t about getting kids<br/>
interested in the occult.  Give me a break.  It is a marketing strategy<br/>

&gt; As Christian parents/grandparents we should be especially aware of what<br/>
&gt; influences our children.  We homeschool them for various reasons - for<br/>
&gt; me, it is primarily to shield him from a world going in the wrong<br/>
&gt; direction!<br/>
&gt; And to give him a Christian outlook on his world and life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With that in mind, I wish to share the following article that I<br/>
&gt; recently read on the Internet.  It made me very glad that I had made the<br/>
&gt; decision to NOT allow our 6 year old to view/collect Pokemon.  Read, and<br/>
&gt; decide for yourselves what you think....<br/>

&gt; Pokemon-Introduction<br/>
&gt;  by David L. Brown, Th.M.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  My son called me on the phone recently and asked, &quot;Dad, do you know<br/>
&gt; anything about the kids&#39; collector card game Pokemon?&quot; The reason he<br/>
&gt; asked<br/>
&gt; was because my oldest grandson, who is 7 years old, came home with<br/>
&gt; several<br/>
&gt; of the cards he got from a friend at church. He showed them to his dad<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; said his friends thought &quot;they were really cool.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After looking at the few cards, his dad had a different opinion. Though<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; could not put his finger on exactly what the problem was by looking at<br/>
&gt; those few cards, he definitely had an uneasy feeling about them While he<br/>
&gt; neither saw nor read anything overtly evil on the cards, there were a <br/>
&gt; couple of hints on them that made him suspicious. He decided not to<br/>
&gt; allow his son to get involved with Pokemon until he looked into it<br/>
&gt; further.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This proved to be a wise decision. Here&#39;s what I discovered.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The History of Pokemon<br/>
&gt; The name Pokemon is derived from pocket monster. Pokemon has entertained<br/>
&gt; Japanese youth since 1995. While it is rare for a Japanese cultural<br/>
&gt; phenomena to be duplicated in the Western world, Pokemon has proved to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; the exception. Pokemon has moved into the United States &quot;BIG TIME&quot; and<br/>
&gt; captured the minds of elementary aged children all over this country.<br/>
&gt; Pokemon is everywhere. Nintendo video games, cartoon shows on<br/>
&gt; television, a movie, comic books, toys, clothing, VHS videos, DVD&#39;s, and<br/>
&gt; the wildly<br/>
&gt; popular collector card game. The Pokemon &quot;virus&quot; has infected virtually<br/>
&gt; every media outlet imaginable, and by plan, the &quot;virus&quot; has become an<br/>
&gt; epidemic among elementary aged children causing them to crave and beg<br/>
&gt; for more Pokemon paraphernalia. Countless elementary aged children are<br/>
&gt; obsessed with  Pokemon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Measuring Pokemon By The Bible Without apology, I acknowledge that I am<br/>
&gt; writing this pamphlet from a biblical perspective. And, I believe there<br/>
&gt; ia a battle going on for the minds of our children and grandchildren.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In fact, Satan and his diabolical hordes want to corrupt the minds of<br/>
&gt; children and adults as well! One of the problems is that Satan is<br/>
&gt; getting<br/>
&gt; the upper hand because Christians are oblivious to the tactics the<br/>
&gt; adversary is using to pollute the minds of men, women, boys and girls.<br/>
&gt; While many Christian adults would catch blatant demonic doctrines, the<br/>
&gt; truth is, Satan seldom mounts a direct assault. Rather, he, through his<br/>
&gt; human helpers, uses subtle, clandestine and deceptive methods to advance<br/>
&gt; his evil doctrines. So, how can we detect these deceptive methods and<br/>
&gt; evil doctrines? How can we protect our children and ourselves?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Bible says, &quot;Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.&quot;<br/>
&gt; 1 Thessalonians 5:21. The Bible says, &quot;Whatsoever ye do, do all to the<br/>
&gt; glory of God&quot; 1 Corinthians 10:31. The Bible says, &quot;.Abhor that which is<br/>
&gt; evil; cleave to that which is good.&quot; Romans 12:9. Therefore, we must<br/>
&gt; measure Pokemon paraphernalia by the principles of the Bible to<br/>
&gt; determine if it is acceptable. Let&#39;s do that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  What values, beliefs, and philosophies do the game promote?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  One of the first things I did was to find out who produced the trading<br/>
&gt; card game. Here is an exact quote right from the Web page of the<br/>
&gt; producer - &quot;The Pokemon Trading Card Game is a new collectable Card Game<br/>
&gt; that is made and distributed by Wizards of the Coast. The same company<br/>
&gt; that made the best selling game ... Magic: The Gathering.&quot; Magic:  The<br/>
&gt; Gathering is a heavily occult laced trading card game very popular  in<br/>
&gt; the 1990&#39;s. I have a research report titled Beware of Magic:The<br/>
&gt; Gathering that can be viewed on the Logos Web page at. <br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.execpc.com/logos/magic-g.html">http://www.execpc.com/logos/magic-g.html</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh yes, I should mention that Wizards of the Coast also owns TSR, the<br/>
&gt; producers of all the Dungeons & Dragons materials. When I discovered who<br/>
&gt; owned the American Pokemon Trading Card Game rights, I knew the game was<br/>
&gt; not just an innocent card game for elementary school children.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Next, I looked into the characters in the Pokemon video games, comics,<br/>
&gt; cartoons, movies, etc. What kind of values do they have? Ash Ketchum (a<br/>
&gt; boy) is one of the main characters.. He is described as  &quot;an energetic<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; determined 10-year-old.a little too competitive.&quot; He is obsessed with<br/>
&gt; catching all Pokemon and driven &quot;to become the world&#39;s foremost Pokemon<br/>
&gt; Master.&quot; Oh yes, you can be sure that the Pokemon Rap song and mantra<br/>
&gt; will be included in the materials --  &quot;I will travel across the land   <br/>
&gt; Searching far and wide   Each Pokemon to understand the power that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; inside.          Gotta catch them all!&quot;      The last line<br/>
&gt; of the Pokemon mantra, &quot;Gotta catch them all!&quot; is used over and over<br/>
&gt; again<br/>
&gt; in Pokemon paraphernalia because it fuels the craving for more cards,<br/>
&gt; games, toys, gadgets, and comic books.  Let&#39;s look at another character,<br/>
&gt; Ash&#39;s companion Misty. She is described  as &quot;headstrong and stubborn.<br/>
&gt; constantly quibbling with Ash and seems to  harbor deeper feelings for<br/>
&gt; Ash.&quot; Then there is the third member of the  trio, Brock who is &quot;by far<br/>
&gt; the most hormonal. Brock&#39;s fascination with the opposite sex many times<br/>
&gt; gets him or the group into trouble, although he&#39;s yet to have anything<br/>
&gt; resembling a score.&quot; Let&#39;s take  a look at Pokemon trainer Gary. He is<br/>
&gt; &quot;a real jerk, self-centered,  vindictive and obnoxious. Then there are<br/>
&gt; Jessie & James. Here is how they are described:   -- &quot;Prepare for<br/>
&gt; trouble, make it double.... Jessie, James are a  mysterious and evil<br/>
&gt; gang looking to steal rare Pokemon. Jessie and  James are stuck up,<br/>
&gt; fashion conscious, and prone to cross-dressing.&quot; Headstrong, stubborn,<br/>
&gt; quibbling, self-centered, vindictive, obnoxious, hormonal, sexually<br/>
&gt; preoccupied, evil, thieving, cross-dressing jerks  are most definitely<br/>
&gt; not biblical role models! These characters do not portray biblical<br/>
&gt; values. Pokemon does not measure up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Are supernatural powers portrayed, and if so, what is the source or<br/>
&gt; origin of those powers? Are occult, New Age characteristics or symbols<br/>
&gt; included?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Pokemon has supernatural powers. &quot;Some Pokemon grow, or evolve.&quot;  This<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; facilitated by the &quot;Energy cards&quot; that &quot;make your Pokemon bigger  and<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; powerful.&quot;  And what is the source of this power? It is the  pantheistic<br/>
&gt; power of the occult, not the supernatural power of God. I have found two<br/>
&gt; cards that make this very clear (there are likely more). They are Abra<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; Kadabra. Yes, these are their actual names. &quot;Abrakadabra&quot;  (or <br/>
&gt; abracadabra) has been a word long associated with occult magic. <br/>
&gt; Webster&#39;s dictionary defines it this way - 1) a word supposed to have <br/>
&gt; magic powers and hence used in incantations, on amulets, etc. 2) a magic<br/>
&gt; spell or formula. It is no accident that the two PokEmon called  Abra<br/>
&gt; and Kadabra are psychic cards with magical powers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  On the Abra card we read &quot;Using its ability to read minds, it will<br/>
&gt; identify impending danger and teleport to safety.&quot; Then there are the<br/>
&gt; occult symbols on Kadabra. He has a pentagram on his forehead, SSS  on<br/>
&gt; his chest and he is giving the Satanic salute with his left hand. All of<br/>
&gt; the above have strong occult significance. It is clear from the Bible<br/>
&gt; (Deuteronomy 18:10-12) that we are neither to participate in nor<br/>
&gt; associate<br/>
&gt; with activities related to the occult.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Some of the readers will no doubt protest, &quot;it&#39;s only a game!&quot; To be<br/>
&gt; sure<br/>
&gt; it is a game, but a game that does not glorify God! When God says<br/>
&gt; something is wrong, it is wrong regardless of what form it is in. Not<br/>
&gt; only that, but many of the kids who play this game are seduced into<br/>
&gt; believing the principles that the game subtly teaches. Here is but one<br/>
&gt; example. In the booklet that comes with PokEmon, note what is <br/>
&gt; stated--   &quot;Welcome to the world of Pokemon, a special place where<br/>
&gt; people just  like you train to<br/>
&gt; become the number-one Pokemon Master in the World!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  But what is a Pokemon, you ask. &#39; Pokemon are incredible creatures that<br/>
&gt; share the world with humans,&#39; says Professor Oak, the leading authority<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; these monsters. There are currently 150 documented species of Pokemon.<br/>
&gt; Each Pokemon has its own special fighting abilities. . . . Some grow, or<br/>
&gt; evolve, into even more powerful creatures.. . . Carry your<br/>
&gt; pokemon with you, and you&#39;re ready for anything! You&#39;ve got the power in<br/>
&gt; your hands, so use it!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Listen, kids are carrying around their Pokemon like a magic talisman.<br/>
&gt; Author and researcher Berit Kjos tells of a mom who overheard two boys<br/>
&gt; discussing their little pocket monsters. As the conversation developed<br/>
&gt; one<br/>
&gt; boy said, &quot;I&#39;ll just use my psychic powers.&quot; It was clear that the so<br/>
&gt; called fantasy world of Pokemon had already conditioned this boys<br/>
&gt; thinking to be receptive to a key occult doctrine - psychic powers!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pokemon promotes occult values, not biblical values and therefore should<br/>
&gt; be rejected!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where are the player&#39;s thoughts and imagination being directed?<br/>
&gt; I pointed out earlier that Pokemon originated in Japan. What I did not<br/>
&gt; draw to your attention was that a Pokemon Master is a spin off of a<br/>
&gt; martial arts master in Japan. Pokemon Masters are the leaders of<br/>
&gt; fighting schools or battling gangs that solve their problems by beating<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; opponents. And how do they do this? Their little booklet says, &quot;Some<br/>
&gt; attacks cause the  Defending Pokemon to be Asleep, Confused, Paralyzed,<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; Poisoned.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Bible warns us to be cautious about what we occupy our minds with<br/>
&gt; (Proverbs 4:23). The games a child plays, the television programs he<br/>
&gt; watches, and the things that he listens to have a powerful mind shaping<br/>
&gt; influence over that child. Mental health professionals are finally<br/>
&gt; coming to understand what the Bible has said all along -- the things you<br/>
&gt; let into you mind shape your thinking and your thinking directs your<br/>
&gt; actions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This truth was acted out at the Columbine High school slaughter. The<br/>
&gt; shooters had saturated their minds with violent video games, Gothic<br/>
&gt; death<br/>
&gt; music, and violent reading material. The result was on April 20, 1999,<br/>
&gt; twelve students and one teacher were murdered. Could  Pokemon influence<br/>
&gt; the children who play it? I pray that it does not happen, but I wonder<br/>
&gt; how long it will be before a grade school child, tries to do what is<br/>
&gt; written on the Weepingbell - Razor Leaf Pokemon card. It says, &quot;It spits<br/>
&gt; out poisonpowder to immobilize the enemy, and then finishes the enemy<br/>
&gt; with a spray of acid.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does this line up with what the Bible has to say about how to handle our<br/>
&gt; enemies in Romans 12:14-22? I think not! It is clear that Pokemon leads<br/>
&gt; the player&#39;s imagination down the wrong path.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Bible says that we are to abhor that which is evil, and cleave to<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; which is good  Romans 12:9). Poisoning, paralyzing, etc. your enemies is<br/>
&gt; clearly evil and no one should occupy their minds with such thoughts,<br/>
&gt; game<br/>
&gt; or no game. Our every thought is to be screened to be sure Christ<br/>
&gt; approves<br/>
&gt; of it (2 Corinthians 10:4-5). If it does not line up, it is to be<br/>
&gt; rejected. So, what&#39;s the problem with Pokemon? Its subtle suggestions,<br/>
&gt; images and values are manipulating the minds and feelings of the<br/>
&gt; children who are into it. Pokemon conditions them to accept humanistic<br/>
&gt; wisdom and occult spirituality. Heavy involvement in Pokemon blurs the<br/>
&gt; player&#39;s ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality and sears<br/>
&gt; the conscience of the player as well. Pokemon is designed to be a<br/>
&gt; stepping stone to harder occult oriented games like: Magic, The<br/>
&gt; Gathering, and Dungeons and Dragons. God wants his children to have a<br/>
&gt; completely different focus. We are even told where our thoughts should<br/>
&gt; be directed in Philippians 4:8 &quot;Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are<br/>
&gt; true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,<br/>
&gt; whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever<br/>
&gt; things are of good  report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any<br/>
&gt; praise, think on these things.&quot;<br/>

values. Pokemon does not measure up!<br/>
<br/>
 Are supernatural powers portrayed, and if so, what is the source or<br/>
origin of those powers? Are occult, New Age characteristics or symbols<br/>
included?<br/>
<br/>
 Pokemon has supernatural powers. &quot;Some Pokemon grow, or evolve.&quot;  This<br/>
is<br/>
facilitated by the &quot;Energy cards&quot; that &quot;make your Pokemon bigger  and<br/>
more<br/>
powerful.&quot;  And what is the source of this power? It is the  pantheistic<br/>
power of the occult, not the supernatural power of God. I have found two<br/>
cards that make this very clear (there are likely more). They are Abra<br/>
and<br/>
Kadabra. Yes, these are their actual names. &quot;Abrakadabra&quot;  (or <br/>
abracadabra) has been a word long associated with occult magic. <br/>
Webster&#39;s dictionary defines it this way - 1) a word supposed to have <br/>
magic powers and hence used in incantations, on amulets, etc. 2) a magic<br/>
spell or formula. It is no accident that the two PokEmon called  Abra<br/>
and Kadabra are psychic cards with magical powers.<br/>
<br/>
 On the Abra card we read &quot;Using its ability to read minds, it will<br/>
identify impending danger and teleport to safety.&quot; Then there are the<br/>
occult symbols on Kadabra. He has a pentagram on his forehead, SSS  on<br/>
his chest and he is giving the Satanic salute with his left hand. All of<br/>
the above have strong occult significance. It is clear from the Bible<br/>
(Deuteronomy 18:10-12) that we are neither to participate in nor<br/>
associate<br/>
with activities related to the occult.<br/>
<br/>
 Some of the readers will no doubt protest, &quot;it&#39;s only a game!&quot; To be<br/>
sure<br/>
it is a game, but a game that does not glorify God! When God says<br/>
something is wrong, it is wrong regardless of what form it is in. Not<br/>
only that, but many of the kids who play this game are seduced into<br/>
believing the principles that the game subtly teaches. Here is but one<br/>
example. In the booklet that comes with PokEmon, note what is <br/>
stated--   &quot;Welcome to the world of Pokemon, a special place where<br/>
people just  like you train to<br/>
become the number-one Pokemon Master in the World!<br/>
<br/>
 But what is a Pokemon, you ask. &#39; Pokemon are incredible creatures that<br/>
share the world with humans,&#39; says Professor Oak, the leading authority<br/>
on<br/>
these monsters. There are currently 150 documented species of Pokemon.<br/>
Each Pokemon has its own special fighting abilities. . . . Some grow, or<br/>
evolve, into even more powerful creatures.. . . Carry your<br/>
pokemon with you, and you&#39;re ready for anything! You&#39;ve got the power in<br/>
your hands, so use it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, kids are carrying around their Pokemon like a magic talisman.<br/>
Author and researcher Berit Kjos tells of a mom who overheard two boys<br/>
discussing their little pocket monsters. As the conversation developed<br/>
one<br/>
boy said, &quot;I&#39;ll just use my psychic powers.&quot; It was clear that the so<br/>
called fantasy world of Pokemon had already conditioned this boys<br/>
thinking to be receptive to a key occult doctrine - psychic powers!<br/>
<br/>
Pokemon promotes occult values, not biblical values and therefore should<br/>
be rejected!<br/>
<br/>
Where are the player&#39;s thoughts and imagination being directed?<br/>
I pointed out earlier that Pokemon originated in Japan. What I did not<br/>
draw to your attention was that a Pokemon Master is a spin off of a<br/>
martial arts master in Japan. Pokemon Masters are the leaders of<br/>
fighting schools or battling gangs that solve their problems by beating<br/>
their<br/>
opponents. And how do they do this? Their little booklet says, &quot;Some<br/>
attacks cause the  Defending Pokemon to be Asleep, Confused, Paralyzed,<br/>
or<br/>
Poisoned.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Bible warns us to be cautious about what we occupy our minds with<br/>
(Proverbs 4:23). The games a child plays, the television programs he<br/>
watches, and the things that he listens to have a powerful mind shaping<br/>
influence over that child. Mental health professionals are finally<br/>
coming to understand what the Bible has said all along -- the things you<br/>
let into you mind shape your thinking and your thinking directs your<br/>
actions.<br/>
<br/>
This truth was acted out at the Columbine High school slaughter. The<br/>
shooters had saturated their minds with violent video games, Gothic<br/>
death<br/>
music, and violent reading material. The result was on April 20, 1999,<br/>
twelve students and one teacher were murdered. Could  Pokemon influence<br/>
the children who play it? I pray that it does not happen, but I wonder<br/>
how long it will be before a grade school child, tries to do what is<br/>
written on the Weepingbell - Razor Leaf Pokemon card. It says, &quot;It spits<br/>
out poisonpowder to immobilize the enemy, and then finishes the enemy<br/>
with a spray of acid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Does this line up with what the Bible has to say about how to handle our<br/>
enemies in Romans 12:14-22? I think not! It is clear that Pokemon leads<br/>
the player&#39;s imagination down the wrong path.<br/>
<br/>
The Bible says that we are to abhor that which is evil, and cleave to<br/>
that<br/>
which is good  Romans 12:9). Poisoning, paralyzing, etc. your enemies is<br/>
clearly evil and no one should occupy their minds with such thoughts,<br/>
game<br/>
or no game. Our every thought is to be screened to be sure Christ<br/>
approves<br/>
of it (2 Corinthians 10:4-5). If it does not line up, it is to be<br/>
rejected. So, what&#39;s the problem with Pokemon? Its subtle suggestions,<br/>
images and values are manipulating the minds and feelings of the<br/>
children who are into it. Pokemon conditions them to accept humanistic<br/>
wisdom and occult spirituality. Heavy involvement in Pokemon blurs the<br/>
player&#39;s ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality and sears<br/>
the conscience of the player as well. Pokemon is designed to be a<br/>
stepping stone to harder occult oriented games like: Magic, The<br/>
Gathering, and Dungeons and Dragons. God wants his children to have a<br/>
completely different focus. We are even told where our thoughts should<br/>
be directed in Philippians 4:8 &quot;Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are<br/>
true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,<br/>
whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever<br/>
things are of good  report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any<br/>
praise, think on these things.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
hi,<br/>
<br/>
first i would like to say that you have the right to your view and i&#39;m not<br/>
a huge fan of pokemon especially the marketing aspect.  but the letter you<br/>
forwarded does not do what it says it must do:<br/>
The Bible says, &quot;Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.&quot; 1<br/>
Thessalonians 5:21.<br/>
the beliefs expressed in this show may reflect that of shinto ( the oldest<br/>
religion of japan and is basically animistic).   shinto far pre-dates<br/>
christianity and if it&#39;s beliefs ( humanistic wisdom) are offensive to you<br/>
then by all means turn it off, unfortunately for christians not everyone is<br/>
christian but others do have the right to express their beliefs.<br/>
historically much of the worlds literature, especially tales told to<br/>
children, have contained  magic and fantasy (perhaps this from our<br/>
animistic spiritual roots).<br/>
<br/>
pokemon is a marketing scam but to &#39;hold fast to the good&#39;, it also shows<br/>
respect and consideration for those in your care (the pokemon themselves),<br/>
conflict and resolution (ash and misty&#39;s relationship), putting your needs<br/>
and desires aside (the acquisition of badges) to help those in need (those<br/>
being victimized by team rocket), discipline and practice as the basis for<br/>
achievement, as well as other values.  so where is the proof that this is<br/>
evil:<br/>
Poisoning, paralyzing, etc. your enemies is clearly evil and no one should<br/>
occupy their minds with such thoughts,<br/>
yes this is evil but this does not happen.   the pokemon are not enemy, the<br/>
battles are sport and certainly not to the death.  the various attacks are<br/>
nearly all found in nature and no pokemon are every killed - certainly<br/>
nothing worse than watching a football game.   there is a basic good<br/>
(represented by  ash et al) vs. evil (represented by team rocket) component<br/>
and good always triumphs.<br/>
<br/>
for me the big problem lies with the marketing/consumerism, though this is<br/>
hardly exclusive to pokemon.   we all must choose the values we want to<br/>
model for our children, as well as allow our children to understand  we<br/>
live in a very diverse world.   not all things are to our families liking,<br/>
but it is good to respect the right of others in the context of modeling<br/>
our own values.<br/>

 Pokemon-Introduction<br/>
  by David L. Brown, Th.M.<br/>
 <br/>
  My son called me on the phone recently and asked, &quot;Dad, do you know<br/>
 anything about the kids&#39; collector card game Pokemon?&quot; The reason he<br/>
 asked<br/>
 was because my oldest grandson, who is 7 years old, came home with<br/>
 several<br/>
 of the cards he got from a friend at church. He showed them to his dad<br/>
 and<br/>
 said his friends thought &quot;they were really cool.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 After looking at the few cards, his dad had a different opinion. Though<br/>
 he<br/>
 could not put his finger on exactly what the problem was by looking at<br/>
 those few cards, he definitely had an uneasy feeling about them While he<br/>
 neither saw nor read anything overtly evil on the cards, there were a <br/>
 couple of hints on them that made him suspicious. He decided not to<br/>
 allow his son to get involved with Pokemon until he looked into it<br/>
 further.<br/>
 <br/>
 This proved to be a wise decision. Here&#39;s what I discovered.<br/>
 <br/>
 The History of Pokemon<br/>
 The name Pokemon is derived from pocket monster. Pokemon has entertained<br/>
 Japanese youth since 1995. While it is rare for a Japanese cultural<br/>
 phenomena to be duplicated in the Western world, Pokemon has proved to<br/>
 be<br/>
 the exception. Pokemon has moved into the United States &quot;BIG TIME&quot; and<br/>
 captured the minds of elementary aged children all over this country.<br/>
 Pokemon is everywhere. Nintendo video games, cartoon shows on<br/>
 television, a movie, comic books, toys, clothing, VHS videos, DVD&#39;s, and<br/>
 the wildly<br/>
 popular collector card game. The Pokemon &quot;virus&quot; has infected virtually<br/>
 every media outlet imaginable, and by plan, the &quot;virus&quot; has become an<br/>
 epidemic among elementary aged children causing them to crave and beg<br/>
 for more Pokemon paraphernalia. Countless elementary aged children are<br/>
 obsessed with  Pokemon.<br/>
 <br/>
  Measuring Pokemon By The Bible Without apology, I acknowledge that I am<br/>
 writing this pamphlet from a biblical perspective. And, I believe there<br/>
 ia a battle going on for the minds of our children and grandchildren.<br/>
 <br/>
 In fact, Satan and his diabolical hordes want to corrupt the minds of<br/>
 children and adults as well! One of the problems is that Satan is<br/>
 getting<br/>
 the upper hand because Christians are oblivious to the tactics the<br/>
 adversary is using to pollute the minds of men, women, boys and girls.<br/>
 While many Christian adults would catch blatant demonic doctrines, the<br/>
 truth is, Satan seldom mounts a direct assault. Rather, he, through his<br/>
 human helpers, uses subtle, clandestine and deceptive methods to advance<br/>
 his evil doctrines. So, how can we detect these deceptive methods and<br/>
 evil doctrines? How can we protect our children and ourselves? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
#1:  We are not Christians.<br/>
<br/>
#2:  I don&#39;t feel this sort of propaganda is appropriate to this list.<br/>
<br/>
#3:  I do not feel that seeing &quot;Satan&quot; in Pokemon lends the Christian point <br/>
of view very much credibility.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690967487">hi,<br/>
<br/>
basically i agree  except that pokemon is not the real issue- it&#39;s the fear and<br/>
judgment expressed in the letter that presented the greatest problem.   also i<br/>
would add two things: 1) we must not take what people say too personal even if<br/>
it is in direct response to what we sent.  to me it&#39;s the nature of the beast<br/>
(email groups) people have the right to disagree.  2) for those of us who are<br/>
not christian it&#39;s a relief to find a group where christian doctrine does not<br/>
dominate and personally i&#39;ve struggled against knee jerk reactions when strong<br/>
christian views have been expressed (in any group i&#39;ve been in) but i try not<br/>
to be too hypocritical.    in this instance the letter was very aggressive and<br/>
begged to be addressed.  in other groups i&#39;ve been slammed for being too<br/>
secular- like i said -nature of the beast -you want to express yourself then<br/>
people will respond.<br/>
<br/>
i feel the most important thing  is honesty.   if you have an honest response<br/>
then pass it on.  what the letter said was an act of censorship and the<br/>
reaction to it is not personal to the sender but to the content of the<br/>
letter.   if this group is not christian enough for karol that&#39;s her choice but<br/>
she should know she and her views are welcome.  this is an unschooling group<br/>
and is therefore very diverse particularly in terms of spiritual orientation<br/>
and this is not the place to &#39;preach&#39;.   people who do hold &#39;humanistic wisdom&#39;<br/>
or magic has highly spiritual do not need to hear their beliefs being slammed<br/>
either, so karol is not the only person who may have her feelings hurt.   in my<br/>
opinion the letter was rude and judgmental and of no real educational value but<br/>
i do understand why she sent it.  it&#39;s just that this is not the right group<br/>
for the kind of discussion i&#39;m guessing she was looking for - now she knows<br/>
that - no shame no blame.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for the information you posted.  Despite some negative comments<br/>
made from this group, I see that it is your desire to help all of us as<br/>
homeschoolers and parents do our best job.  You already know you&#39;re blessed<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
To everyone who slammed Karol:  You really oughta be ashamed of yourselves.<br/>
That&#39;s not what this group is about.  You&#39;re not helping anyone be better<br/>
parents or homeschoolers.  Her email clearly acknowledges that we all<br/>
homeschool for various and diverse reasons.  It then goes on to state:<br/>
&quot;Read, and decide for yourselves what you think.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not force-feeding anyone anything.  Maybe you personally didn&#39;t<br/>
appreciate her post, but some of us did.  Speak for yourself and yourself<br/>
only.  You are one among many.<br/>
<br/>
Slamming a fellow homeschooler is NOT productive and does very little to<br/>
further our cause.  We need to be looking at the bigger picture here.  How<br/>
does it look when we, as homeschoolers, can&#39;t even get along amongst<br/>
ourselves?  United we stand, divided we fall.<br/>
<br/>
I also do not like the religious prejudices or stereotyping I have seen<br/>
today.  One of the reasons I&#39;m glad I live in America is because I know I<br/>
have religious freedom and the right to talk about it.  With that in mind,<br/>
I&#39;m going to let you know that I will be keeping all homeschoolers and the<br/>
homeschooling movement in my prayers.  As long as I&#39;m not hurting you, you<br/>
can&#39;t stop me from practicing my religion, and therein lies the beauty of<br/>
this great nation.<br/>
<br/>
Besides all that, this is not the first time I&#39;ve heard bad things about<br/>
PokEmon.  I didn&#39;t like PokEmon the minute I got a description of it from<br/>
one the neighbor kids.  Just what we need, another toy that promotes<br/>
violence.<br/>
<br/>
God Bless. (If that offends anyone, TOUGH!)<br/>

&gt; Hi to all the listmembers,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I truly hope I did not offend anybody by the article I forwarded on<br/>
&gt; Pokemon.  It was not meant to offend, preach, or to find fault with<br/>
&gt; anyone - I simply wished to share information that had confirmed to<br/>
&gt; me that I had made a correct choice. I viewed it as an &quot;eye-opener&quot;.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only defense I would present to you is that the gentleman who <br/>
&gt; wrote the article did do his research - it was not just a blind<br/>
&gt; presentation.  And that often times it is the truth that gets under<br/>
&gt; our skin!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not offended, nor do I have my feelings hurt, by any of your<br/>
&gt; comments.  I do, however, appreciate those who had kind words to<br/>
&gt; say in my defense!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to all who expressed so freely your feelings and opinions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now.....on to the real reason for this list.........<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am struggling with feeling like I am not doing the best job that<br/>

Have you read anything about delayed academics by Dr. Robert Moore?<br/>
My dd is 7.  I let her play as much as she wants to.<br/>
I read to her and she reads on her own.  When she was 6, I introduced<br/>
phonics, but it was clear she didn&#39;t get it, so I let it go and just kept<br/>
reading to her.  I read her everything from board books to pre-teen<br/>
level.  One day it clicked and she was reading.  We love historical<br/>
fiction, including American Girls series.  There are some Dear Diary<br/>
historical fiction for boys too (through Scholastic Publishers)<br/>
I do limit TV, but have explained my reasons to them.  (We sometimes<br/>
threaten Daddy with a no TV week!)<br/>
We listen to music.  She has learned to replay favorite songs on the CD<br/>
player and once replayed and sang the same song for an hour!  We borrow<br/>
CD&#39;s from the library.<br/>
She loves to play with others, so I make sure to arrange time for her to<br/>
play with homeschooled friends and neighborhood friends.<br/>
We play games -- Monopoly Jr. and Uno are two current favorites.  Last<br/>
year she enjoyed Brain Quest game for kindergarten and preschoolers.  We<br/>
have some computer games too.<br/>
We have some schoolish workbooks - it is totally up to her when she wants<br/>
to use them.  They sit unopened for weeks at a time, then she will pull<br/>
one out and do many pages at one sitting.  We go over it together when<br/>
she is done (her choice).  If I can see that an answer is &quot;wrong&quot;, I&#39;ll<br/>
ask her how she came up with it.  Nine times out of 10 her answer is<br/>
accurate, just not what the book may have been looking for.  I never tell<br/>
her her answer is &quot;wrong&quot;, I just discuss other possible solutions with<br/>
her.<br/>
We just started a gym class for homeschoolers.  I&#39;m giving it some time<br/>
to see if we all like it (also have a 4 year old.)<br/>
Good luck.  I am having a wonderful time homeschooling!<br/>
Mary Ellen<br/>
The darn trouble with cleaning the house is it gets dirty the next day<br/>
anyway,<br/>
so skip a week if you have to.  The children are the most important<br/>
thing.<br/>

6 is awfully young to settle down and do formal learning anyway. He&#39;s bright<br/>
and he&#39;s learning all the time, right? Why try to fix what&#39;s not broken?<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things is he interested in and what would he like to learn?<br/>
Maybe if you name a few things we could come up with some suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I find it very admirable that you are willing to raise and<br/>
homeschool your grandson! That&#39;s really awesome!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876707875">My youngest is very much an &quot;audio-kinesthetic learner&quot;(I put it in<br/>
quotes--don&#39;t anyone yell at me for labelling please!!!)  She truly learns<br/>
with her butt wiggling in the air while she sings a song! We play all sorts<br/>
of games--we now have hopskotch masking taped on the living room floor, and<br/>
a grid of numbers (kind of like tic-tac-toe with 1-0 in the spaces) masking<br/>
taped on the family room rug. We roll a die and add  whatever number shows<br/>
up to the number it lands on.  We play word games with note cards laid all<br/>
over the house in a serpentine fashion--she likes to read the words she<br/>
lands on. She&#39;s made note cards with words on them and labeled many things<br/>
in the house(including us!). The more you suggest she sit quietly the more<br/>
she needs to move!When she is intersted in something she focusses for hours.<br/>
She loves me to read biographies to her--she likes to point out the<br/>
peacemakers. Right now she&#39;s fascinated with the Cartoon History of the<br/>
United States.<br/>
 This is the kid who climbed before she could talk (and she talked in<br/>
sentences at 15 months).She brings joy and golden laughter to our hearts.<br/>

<br/>
So....now I will be waiting for input from the rest of you on this<br/>
subject!!!  *grin*<br/>
i thought i would pass on some exerts from and article &quot;an unschooler&#39;s<br/>
lament:  what&#39;s so hard to understand&quot; by mary griffith (the author of two<br/>
handbooks for homeschooling and unschooling).  the article was published in<br/>
the mag paths of learning.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;i discovered three elements common to unschooling families:<br/>
<br/>
an environment conducive to exploration and experimentation.  to put the<br/>
matter bluntly, we unschoolers have lots of stuff around to play with.<br/>
the nature of that stuff varies with the interests and needs of each<br/>
family; from books overflowing their shelves, to pots and pans to stack and<br/>
bang, to backyard garden to cultivate, to a screaming fast computer, our<br/>
homes have lots of easily accessible materials around for children to<br/>
investigate.   if we want our kids to learn by following their own<br/>
interests, we need to offer them plenty to catch those interests.<br/>
<br/>
adults as models and facilitators.  unschooling parents, like most other<br/>
parents, learn rapidly that &quot;do as i say, not as i do&quot; does not work very<br/>
well with children.   unschooling kids need people around them who provide<br/>
models of learning by the way they live and in activities they pursue.   if<br/>
we parents are not obviously curious about and interested in the world<br/>
around us, if we ourselves never ask questions and search for answers, if<br/>
we never just try things and see what happens, it&#39;s unlikely that our kids<br/>
will do so, either.<br/>
<br/>
trust that children will learn.   for most people, this is the big obstacle<br/>
to understanding unschooling and allowing it to work.   perhaps the<br/>
conventional school education that created our own model of learning<br/>
creates an impression that learning is supposed to be difficult or boring,<br/>
or that learning cannot and will not occur unless someone is explicitly<br/>
teaching, providing information in little age-appro[riate packets, giving<br/>
quizzes on wednesdays and tests on fridays.   eventually, once we&#39;ve bitten<br/>
our tongues and sat on our hands and held our breaths long enough to let<br/>
our kids learn to trust their own abilities, we discover that we can trust<br/>
their abilities as well.   in fact, we discover that it&#39;s almost impossible<br/>
to stop our kids from learning, that kids, already intensely curious, are<br/>
eager to indulge their curiosity.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
she goes on to say:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;of course,  even better than applying manufacturing models of more recent<br/>
vintage than the industrial revolution to education and learning would be<br/>
to drop the dehumanizing industrial models entirely and start treating both<br/>
children and adult learners as full, active participants in the educational<br/>
process.   in other words, instead of looking at improving instructional<br/>
delivery systems or accountability procedures, shouldn&#39;t we talk seriously<br/>
with our kids about their particular educational paths, learning from them<br/>
how they learn best and what they find helpful or obstructive to their<br/>
learning processes?   aren&#39;t our kids entitled to direct a process that<br/>
prepares them for their own future?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
she concludes by saying:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;however, let me be clear: &quot;because it works&quot; isn&#39;t a sound enough reason<br/>
for me to advocate unschooling in particular and, more generally, treating<br/>
our children as full partners in our lives.   our children are fellow human<br/>
beings - they are our colleagues in the making of the world, in the<br/>
creation of our joint future.   treating them as fully human, with respect<br/>
and decency, recognizing them as people just like us, is what we owe them<br/>
and what we owe ourselves.   it&#39;s simply the right thing to do.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
though this is purely philosophical  i hope it will be of some use to you.<br/>
for me having a strong grasp of the underlining concept helps me work with<br/>
all the many of variables we face each day.<br/>
