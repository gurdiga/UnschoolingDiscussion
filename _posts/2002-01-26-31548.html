As I&#39;ve watched these past couple of days with amazement, I&#39;ve been thinking<br/>
something similar....you put it into words beautifully.  Thanks.  After the<br/>
&quot;thump on the head&quot; vs. &quot;stab in the gut&quot; comment I got to thinking why be<br/>
violent in discussions like this at all?  I neither want to be &quot;whacked&quot; on<br/>
the head (which I think was the original comment?) NOR stabbed in the gut.<br/>
I&#39;d just rather talk...share ideas gently.  I don&#39;t hang out at<br/>
Unschooling.com for several reasons, but one of them is that I always see<br/>
lots of whacking and stabbing going on there.  I&#39;m really saddened by it,<br/>
too.  I only joined this list a couple weeks ago, so I&#39;m sad to see this all<br/>
get out of hand.<br/>

I read that post to mean that we had two choices:  Whack on the head or stab<br/>
in the gut.  I reject both choices.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree overwhelmingly that &quot;perception&quot; is a BIG part of communication,<br/>
but I disagree that it is the sum total.  A conversation takes at least TWO<br/>
people....one to transmit; one to receive.  Yes--two people mean the<br/>
variations of what will be heard can vary....but what I have objected to is<br/>
the idea that the receiver is the ONLY one who is responsible for the<br/>
message&#39;s understanding.<br/>

Karin, do you think you could have come to an understanding in any different<br/>
way?  If people conveyed the exact same ideas, but in a way that validated<br/>
you as a human being worthy of respect?  Would the same ideas--without the<br/>
whacking and stabbing--been the same ideas in the end?<br/>
<br/>
I know the answer for me, because no one whacked or stabbed me for me to<br/>
understand unschooling.  John Holts books have no &quot;whacks&quot; or &quot;stabs&quot; in<br/>
them; Mary Griffith&#39;s books don&#39;t either; neither does HEM or GWS.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t think it is necessary.  Just because you got through it OK<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good environment for all people to grow.  Most of us<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good environment for our *children* to grow...why would<br/>
it be any better for adults?  I think you are the exception, not the rule.<br/>

But I stuck it out and stayed and I&#39;m so glad I did. It took a few times of painful questioning and reexamination for me to grow in the direction I needed to. I had to swallow my pride or whatever was getting hurt and look at things from a different angle. This is coming from someone who gets hurt feelings very easily and takes things too personally. But unschooling.com got my feet firmly planted in the right direction and there is no turning back now, for me. :o)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s taking the analogy a bit far! Even adults who say they like a whack<br/>
up side the head don&#39;t litterally want a whack up side the head ;-) What<br/>
they are seeking is what they feel they need.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer to the question is, no, I wouldn&#39;t whack a child upside the<br/>
head so she gets what I&#39;m saying. I would provide what the *child* felt she<br/>
needed, not what *I* felt the child needed.<br/>
<br/>
*But* a group/list/institutuion isn&#39;t a child&#39;s mother or mentor. It can&#39;t<br/>
provide what everyone who shows up needs. It can&#39;t even provide what people<br/>
need in general. If we believe it can, then we can believe public schools<br/>
can provide what every child needs. Trying to be what &quot;everyone&quot; needs turns<br/>
the offerings into pablum.<br/>
<br/>
We *can&#39;t* expect a group to be what we need. The most productive groups are<br/>
specialized. (As a mother is specialized to her child.) So our<br/>
responsibility isn&#39;t to demand that the group change when a group is meeting<br/>
it&#39;s own internal needs and not ours but to find a group that already meets<br/>
our own specialized needs.<br/>
<br/>
If we expect any group to be other than what it is trying to be, who&#39;s at<br/>
fault, us or the group?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does it need to be so black and white? Can&#39;t a person come to a list with<br/>
&gt; the naivety of a child and get another viewpoint on their beliefs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone&#39;s goal is to provide a place where specialized needs are met,<br/>
should they compromise meeting those needs for the sake of meeting the needs<br/>
of more people *just* because people arrive expecting their own needs to be<br/>
met?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s our expectations of everything being for everyone that are at<br/>
fault not what one particular list or person provides. Even this list where<br/>
parenting and unschooling ideas are examined isn&#39;t for everyone. Some people<br/>
*are* just looking for support and &quot;good job&quot; pats on the back for how far<br/>
they&#39;re progressing. They want to share without it being held up to public<br/>
scrutiny.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve seen someone like Pat C, who has asked questions and put herself<br/>
&gt; &#39;out there&#39;, come full circle with the ideas presented to her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if someone wanted help questioning herself and wanted to reach a certain<br/>
point through examining her ideas, how far would she get on a purely<br/>
supportive list that told her she was doing great?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would a thump on the head have caused her to feel it was a stab in the<br/>
&gt; gut? Who knows... but a certain amount of diplomacy and patience for<br/>
&gt; those that take time to pull it all together seems to work better in a<br/>
&gt; group setting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For *some* people that works. Some people need something different. Assuming<br/>
there&#39;s one best way for a list for all unschoolers to be is supporting the<br/>
same certainty that public schools can be everything to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
*Some* people like a whack up side the head. *Some* will feel it&#39;s a stab in<br/>
the gut. But there&#39;s a whole world of other people outside that &quot;some&quot;.<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t like being whacked ;-). Though I do learn by watching<br/>
others *voluntarily* getting what they&#39;d describe as whacked up side the<br/>
head and then figuring out what pressures and thought processes brought them<br/>
to that point where they were trapped by their own thinking and needed the<br/>
proverbial whack.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I figure I was ultra sensitive to any online comments because that environment was so new to me. I was never part of any other &quot;groups&quot; or message boards of any kind. I had a lot of learning to do just regarding that aspect of different online communication. About understanding, I think I needed a very strong wake up call kind of message, very blunt and to the point, and that is what you get at unschooling.com a lot of the time. I have since come to really value this bluntness because unschooling was spelled out so clearly for me. I was convinced of what I needed to do and started almost immediately when it became clear to me. BTW, for all the bluntness at unschooling.com, there are many, many people there who all have their own unique styles of posting which come across friendlier, respectful and that treat the poster as a human being. Whenever I post, that is how I try to be. But sometimes a poster comes along and asks the most ridiculous questions relating to unschooling and I don&#39;t even have a clue how to answer so I don&#39;t even try. Sometimes these people may get a blunt response.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know the answer for me, because no one whacked or stabbed me for me to<br/>

&gt;them; Mary Griffith&#39;s books don&#39;t either; neither does HEM or GWS.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read John Holt when I first started homeschooling 5 years ago. Although I really agreed with his philosophy I never made the connection to try unschooling, or maybe never had the courage back then. No, his books where not enough to make me realize I should try this in my house. Mabye I was naive and insecure back then. I really appreciate the unschooling support I have found online and I don&#39;t know if I could have started unschooling without it. And like I said, unschooling.com was my first real exposure to unschooling and I will always be grateful for the place.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From what I can tell, there are still many people who run across unschooling.com and *get it* and stay and post regularly and are helped. I really think it is how you perceive posts and how you let them affect you. I have learned they are just words about ideas, not personal attacks. That in itself has been a great &quot;education&quot; for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307138147">And therein lies the problem IMHO.  <br/>
There have been times when I was accused of attacking someone who <br/>

No, it&#39;s not. But when the obvious division became apparent, one sector of the list opted to start another list (note: they were not made to leave.. they opted to do so). It&#39;s my understanding that those on that list are happy and the list is thriving. So why come back to this one and ask (again) for it to change to a more blunt-type list? If this is the list that is being exposed as a connection for newbies to come to for help, advice and so on, it&#39;s a given that these people are mostly unsure of what they&#39;re undertaking. It&#39;s in peoples&#39; nature to gravitate toward the &#39;nice&#39; and move away from the &#39;not nice&#39; (maybe that&#39;s a wrong choice of words... maybe I should say ...to gravitate toward a warm fuzzy blanket instead of a cold block of ice?). Anyway, you get my point I think.<br/>

But that&#39;s assuming that is all one finds now at unschooling-dotcom and imo, it&#39;s not! The tv thread is an example of views being scrutinized (oldies as well as newbies). <br/>

<br/>
Maybe a lot further than if she was blasted away the minute she arrived and feeling wounded. Look at the number of people who leave because of that. Granted, not all do, but there are lots that do and lots that go into the lurkdom stage and never come out! I mean, seriously... this is a big list of over 600 people. LOOK at how many post on a regular basis. WHERE are all the other 500 or so??? Do they worry that what they ask or post will be ripped to shreds? <br/>

<br/>
Yes, that is true. But again.. when it became obvious that there were two distinct groups with opposing views to this issue, the one group opted to leave and start a list more to their liking. It&#39;s free... anyone can join if they like the thump/whacking type list. It&#39;s probably even &#39;advertised&#39; (as in this one is advertised) as a place to get more unschooling information.

&gt; &gt;way?  If people conveyed the exact same ideas, but in a way that <br/>
validated<br/>
&gt; &gt;you as a human being worthy of respect?  Would the same ideas--<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I figure I was ultra sensitive to any online comments because that <br/>
environment was so new to me. I was never part of any other &quot;groups&quot; <br/>
or message boards of any kind. I had a lot of learning to do just <br/>
regarding that aspect of different online communication. About <br/>
understanding, I think I needed a very strong wake up call kind of <br/>
message, very blunt and to the point, and that is what you get at <br/>
unschooling.com a lot of the time. I have since come to really value <br/>
this bluntness because unschooling was spelled out so clearly for me. <br/>
I was convinced of what I needed to do and started almost immediately <br/>
when it became clear to me. BTW, for all the bluntness at <br/>
unschooling.com, there are many, many people there who all have their <br/>
own unique styles of posting which come across friendlier, respectful <br/>
and that treat the poster as a human being. Whenever I post, that is <br/>
how I try to be. But sometimes a poster comes along and asks the most <br/>
ridiculous questions relating to unschooling and I don&#39;t even have a <br/>
clue how to answer so I don&#39;t even try. Sometimes these people may <br/>
get a blunt response. </span></blockquote></div>

There is no thumping and whacking going on, except in the mind of the <br/>
learner.  I don&#39;t think anyone sets out to purposely &quot;whack&quot;.  They <br/>
are just stating strongly held beliefs.  If someone gets &quot;whacked&quot;, <br/>
it is because of the process THEY are going through.<br/>
Those who left here were ones willing to challenge and provoke real <br/>
thought.  <br/>
If you can&#39;t handle that, unschooling will probably be near <br/>

<br/>
I suspect if you took an *unbiased* look at relationships and how one likes<br/>
to learn you wouldn&#39;t see such a strong correlation.<br/>

sensitive to being questioned will perceive the whole group as an attacking<br/>
one, even if it&#39;s just one or two asking probing questions and the others<br/>
are supportive. :-/<br/>
<br/>
I think both are necessary for newbies wandering in to a general forum when<br/>
the subject is as far from the comfortable mainstream as unschooling is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965200686">That is fine with me. This particular discussion relates to whether unschooling.com is a helpful unschooling community. I happen to think it is. Some others here do not agree. I was just offering my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you just hang on for a while you may get the unschooling community you are looking for. Between these groups and unschooling.com, I am quite satisfied.<br/>

  I was on another moderated list and there was a rule about no META discussions- <br/>
<br/>
  you know, no discussions about the discussion-  the moment someone posted something of that nature, they would receive either a personal e-mail or a general public reminder would be sent.<br/>
<br/>
  It was good- we stuck to helping each other-  <br/>
<br/>
  I keep subbing to this list hoping to get some unschooling community<br/>
<br/>
  WHat do you think?  <br/>

    Everyone is entitled to their opinion, of course. My opinion is that I have not seen what you describe as the pros making fun of newbies. Every post and question is treated in a serious manner, especially when the question relates to the specifics of unschooling and how it works best. That is how I have perceived it. I have not seen the old pros swapping stories. And I truly respect those old pros.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, *would you*?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I answered that *right* below the part you quoted. Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; So the answer to the question is, no, I wouldn&#39;t whack a child upside the<br/>
&gt;&gt; head so she gets what I&#39;m saying. I would provide what the *child* felt she<br/>
&gt;&gt; needed, not what *I* felt the child needed.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So why come back to this one and ask (again) for it to change to a more<br/>
&gt; blunt-type list?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then you&#39;ve mistaken the concerns expressed. The concern was over letting<br/>
ideas that were counter to unschooling philosophy pass by unexamined.<br/>
Perhaps some can&#39;t imagine those ideas being examined without being blunt.<br/>
But they can if phrased carefully.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that the list has felt &quot;kinder and gentler&quot; recently *solely*<br/>
because people have been more attentive to how they respond. (Though I think<br/>
that&#39;s a factor.) I think that there just hasn&#39;t been anything posted that<br/>
rose above people&#39;s comfort level. (Until the past few days of course!)<br/>
<br/>
Some people have a higher comfort level than others. Ren&#39;s was at the level<br/>
of the concept of being behind. (Whether that was what the poster meant or<br/>
not is irrelevant if Ren was certain she understood because if it *was*<br/>
true, she would still have asked the question.)<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think -- even banning the &quot;blunt&quot; folk from posting -- that<br/>
the newly reformed kinder, gentler folk would have been uniformly kind and<br/>
gentle if someone had said she had to spank because she knew her kids would<br/>
run wild if she didn&#39;t? I don&#39;t think so because I think that idea exceeds<br/>
the comfort level of most of the posters here. And the more it exceeds it,<br/>
the more &quot;not gentle&quot; their response would be.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a function of comfort level.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *also* a function of the style of people&#39;s posts. No one can control<br/>
that, though Mary and Cindy can send out reminders and talk to people.<br/>
<br/>
Me:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some people *are* just looking for support and &quot;good job&quot; pats on  the back<br/>
&gt; for how far they&#39;re progressing. They want to share without it being  held up<br/>
&gt; to public scrutiny.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sarah:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But that&#39;s assuming that is all one finds now at unschooling-dotcom<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I made no assumptions. I was describing what *some* people come to<br/>
unschooling.com to find. I said in the sentence *right before* the one you<br/>
pulled out to quote: &quot;Even this list where parenting and unschooling ideas<br/>
are examined isn&#39;t for everyone.&quot; I said it right there that people here<br/>
were questioning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe a lot further than if she was blasted away the minute she arrived and<br/>
&gt; feeling wounded. Look at the number of people who leave because of that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I *do* see people leaving because they felt attacked a problem. I&#39;m sad<br/>
every time that happens.<br/>
<br/>
*But* I also suspect it&#39;s because unschooling is on the edge of people&#39;s<br/>
comfort level. For people who aren&#39;t there yet, it *does* take<br/>
self-examination to get it because society has filled us full of unexamined<br/>
&quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;musts&quot;. There isn&#39;t anyway to shed those that isn&#39;t<br/>
uncomfortable. (It doesn&#39;t mean it must be painful, but it won&#39;t be a<br/>
party.)<br/>
<br/>
But a forum where someone can be supported for doing the best they can and<br/>
expecting their (nonunschooling) solutions to problems to be received<br/>
without comment *can&#39;t* be a forum about unschooling. It might be a nice,<br/>
gentle, supportive place! But it *wouldn&#39;t* be unschooling. People don&#39;t<br/>
need to be attacked because they suggest Saxon as a good way to do math, but<br/>
*if* they expect to be able to suggest it without it being commented on<br/>
because &quot;whatever works for your family is best&quot;, then they aren&#39;t going to<br/>
feel comfortable in an *unschooling* forum. They need a &quot;whatever works best<br/>
for you family&quot; homeschooling forum! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I mean, seriously... this is a big list of over 600 people. LOOK at how many<br/>
&gt; post on a regular basis. WHERE are all the other 500 or so???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From what others have said, that isn&#39;t unusual. Most lists, even the gentle<br/>
lists, have more readers than participants. Maybe it&#39;s a school thing<br/>
because most people feel more confident in their ability to read than in<br/>
their ability to write.<br/>
