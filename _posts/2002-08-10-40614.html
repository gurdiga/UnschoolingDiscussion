The government is failing to educate our children. In (name your state), the<br/>
failure follows the national pattern. The school system is not doing its<br/>
job. Taxpayers¹ money is being wasted while the children are being denied an<br/>
education. More money will not change it. Sending kids to suburban schools<br/>
won¹t change it because all the public schools in the state are run by the<br/>
state Department of Education by the same rules, methods and mandates and<br/>
all offer the same poor quality schooling. It&#39;s bad by design.<br/>
<br/>
   The public schools are failing everywhere because they don¹t have<br/>
effective programs; they have no standards and no goals; they use inferior<br/>
methods for instruction  (i.e., ³Whole Language² a proven failure instead of<br/>
Phonics a proven success); their bad teachers are virtually impossible to<br/>
fire thanks to the power of the teachers¹ union; the system has a captive<br/>
audience of consumers instead of parents with choices. The situation allows<br/>
the schools to fail without losing any customers or funding. In fact, the<br/>
worse the schools perform, the higher their funding gets. The Hartford CT<br/>
schools prove that -- they are among the nation¹s worst, and yet their per<br/>
pupil cost is among the nation¹s highest.<br/>
<br/>
   Government school systems are bureaucratic monopolies with one constant<br/>
objective: to enlarge their budgets. Their structure and practices guarantee<br/>
poor performance. There are no incentives to improve the schools; no rewards<br/>
for good teaching and no penalties for incompetence. The system can blame<br/>
its customers and ³society² for its own failures -- that¹s convenient but<br/>
dishonest -- while its cry remains, ³Give us more money.² Taxpayers are its<br/>
captives; the children are its victims.<br/>
