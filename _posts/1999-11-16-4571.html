<div id="ygrps-yiv-351968821">Hello!!<br/>
We are clearing out the closets in anticipation of the holidays.  We are also <br/>
hoping to make a little shopping money since the budget isn&#39;t allowing for <br/>
much this year.  I have not included prices on the following.  Check the list <br/>
over.  If you find something you like, email me and make an offer.  I am <br/>
willing to negotiate and bargain to get some of this out of my house!!<br/>
Take Care!<br/>
