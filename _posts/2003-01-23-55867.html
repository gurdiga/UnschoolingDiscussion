<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It has become almost chaos at the house.  I can never find my stuff, or<br/>
&gt; stuff is broken and we can&#39;t afford to replace it, kids not respecting the<br/>
&gt; boundaries of anyone, not just me.  They do exactly what they want, treat<br/>
&gt; people however they want, until I must put limits on them.  I don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; but I can&#39;t have boundaries being so disrespected.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry about the chaos.  I&#39;m sure that gets frustrating to you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read all the posts in the digests so far, and you&#39;ve gotten lots of<br/>
good suggestions.  I know that you&#39;ve made major changes with your family in<br/>
the last month or so, and as I recall, that happened as a take the kids out<br/>
to breakfast family meeting.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like perhaps what you need is another family meeting to talk about<br/>
how things are going and discuss the respect for each other you find<br/>
lacking.  Talk about your feeling of chaos, the breaking of things, and so<br/>
on.  Use those great &quot;I statements&quot; and tell them how you feel.  Have them<br/>
tell you how they feel, and how you can help each other.<br/>
<br/>
I have boundries.  Some of them are personal boundries, such as I cannot<br/>
stand being tickled.  Other boundries here are family-size boundries.  We<br/>
don&#39;t climb on the sofa.  The sofa is new, it&#39;s the first piece of nice<br/>
livingroom furniture we&#39;ve ever had.  My son understands.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think boundries are wrong, they just need to not be arbitrary.  To<br/>
me, that means that the boundries don&#39;t change based on time of day or<br/>
behaviour of child.  As far as your stuff getting broken, why is it out<br/>
where it can be broken?  One of our boundries is that my son is welcome in<br/>
my studio if I&#39;m in there, but not if I&#39;m not.  I have major investments of<br/>
musical instruments in there.  The same goes with our bedrooms.  Everybodys.<br/>
I don&#39;t go in Tim&#39;s room without him, and he respects my room the same way.<br/>
It gives me a space to put things I don&#39;t want moved, broken, etc.  With a<br/>
number of children, I think perhaps that&#39;s multiplied.  It&#39;s certainly fair<br/>
for someone (you or anyone else) to say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s mine and I<br/>
would like you to not play with it&quot;.  Yes?<br/>
<br/>
My 6 year old is suffering from similar forgetfulness as your daughter.  I&#39;m<br/>
starting to think that it&#39;s not that he forgets what I&#39;ve asked, but that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t think about that before he starts something that looks fun.  When<br/>
confronted, he remembers, of course, but he wasn&#39;t thinking ahead, so he<br/>
forgot to remember, if that makes sense.  I think it&#39;s an age thing.  It<br/>
seems to help if I don&#39;t lose my cool, but merely tell him that I really do<br/>
need him to remember.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you can</div>

I agree.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;To me, that means that the boundries don&#39;t change based on time of day or<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not arbitrary, that&#39;s inconsistent.<br/>
<br/>
Arbitrary means just chosen for a kind of random or unbased reason.  Like no <br/>
eating after 7:30.  Bedtime at 8:30.  Toothbrushes lined up in order of <br/>
color.  Towels folded with edges toward the east.<br/>

<br/>
This sounds great but please don&#39;t make it a &quot;we could go back to the way <br/>
things were, missy, if you don&#39;t shape up.&quot;   Because if freedoms are <br/>
conditional on kids behaving the same way they did before, then they will <br/>
keep acting like it&#39;s a temporary holiday soon to be retracted.<br/>
<br/>
Same with unschooling.  When a family doesn&#39;t commit to natural learning, but <br/>
they &quot;try it for a while,&quot; and the kids KNOW it&#39;s temporary, sometimes it <br/>
fails, because the kids fully expect that the curriculum will come back out <br/>
at some point, they just don&#39;t know when.  So they keep on as they did during <br/>
breaks from curriculum before.  And if the parents reinforce their belief <br/>
with threats of same, the break gets longer, but the spectre of the <br/>
curriculum doesn&#39;t go away.<br/>
