<div id="ygrps-yiv-692850169">Interesting conversations going on here. I need a break from the current<br/>
events, so here I go with my opinions.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in democracy, I believe capitalism has it&#39;s faults but overall is<br/>
the better choice. Now let me explain. Every concept is born out of<br/>
idealism, what &quot;could be&quot;. It often does not properly account for human<br/>
nature. People are greedy and selfish by nature and it is wrong (in my<br/>
opinion) to try and deny it individuals and society. That greed can be used<br/>
to help fuel the whole. On the other hand we are also generous and selfless,<br/>
and that can be used to help the whole.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; We do<br/>
know that communism works in small groups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is very true, a small example is even in the Bible, with the early<br/>
church. However, I believe it breaks down in larger groups because we can<br/>
not eliminate the eliment of greed and those who desire power in all.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The basic premise of communism is give by commitment, take by need.  To<br/>
give<br/>
by commitment, people must believe that their society, commune, family,<br/>
whatever the group is important to them and they are important to it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which is why it can work in small groups, but begins to fall apart in larger<br/>
groups. Not all people hold the same beliefs and cna not be forced to.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In communism, the society must meet the needs of the people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even in communism there must be a group of people &quot;in charge&quot; who must<br/>
decide the needs of the many....so the choices of the individual are taken<br/>
away and a small group of individuals can not meet the needs of the masses.<br/>
Much the same way a teacher can not meet all the needs of her students in a<br/>
large classroom.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;It cannot be<br/>
dictated by the few or the powerful or the entire society would fall apart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This makes no sense to me, who decides where the resources go? Even the most<br/>
kind hearted person can turn greedy when faced with shortage. They people<br/>
deemed most needed by the society will get fed, clothed, medical attention,<br/>
ect. before those that deemed less needed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That is why it cannot move through socialism and that is why<br/>
&quot;communism-lite&quot;, as I think of the common perception in the U.S. of<br/>
communism, is unworkable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To me communism on a large scale is unworkable even in it&#39;s pure form. Human<br/>
kind is fallable.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Also, communism isn&#39;t about &quot;social programs&quot;.  It is about getting rid of<br/>
wages all together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Aah...much like Star Trek NG, haha, I am a scifi nut. The big problem with<br/>
this is that no one desires to clean the toilets. No one wants to do the<br/>
ugly jobs. In our society we do it to earn the money. However take the money<br/>
equation out and who does the nasty jobs? If you can not get people to scrub<br/>
toilets or whatever then how is it handled? Do you force people into<br/>
undesirable jobs? Even more freedom would be taken from the individual. Do<br/>
you entice with &quot;extra benefits&quot;? This could cause serious problems with the<br/>
theory of equality for all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;do and be more....what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Whatever they strive to be... in this country an out of work maid can become<br/>
the owner of her own company. (my mother) I am a housewife and mother, which<br/>
in my readings  isn&#39;t desirable in communism because it isn&#39;t for the<br/>
greater good. I desire to be more and plan to open my own business. I am<br/>
striving to be more than I am, but enjoying being all that I am, too.<br/>
<br/>
Well, there you have it, my thoughts. Communism is idealistic and works on<br/>
small scales, but can not work on larger scales because it doesn&#39;t account<br/>
for the way we humans really are. Socialism is another issue, I might<br/>
comment on later...but this is too long as it is. :)<br/>
