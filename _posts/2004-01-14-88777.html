<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271289350">&quot;he&#39;s not ready.  I just am.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I SO understand that feeling. I felt absolutely huge with Jalen, and I was typically very small with all my babies. I measured so far under that I appeared to be about 34 weeks when they were born...and they were BIG. But with Jalen I was bigger, and slower, and more tired. Number four was hard, and then dh and I were separated and...ugh, I hate even thinking about it!<br/>
But, you will never, ever have your child living in your body again. It is a most sacred time and it is so much better to just enjoy that brief period. It will be over with soon.<br/>

Raspberry and Nettle tea do not induce labor, just assist with the process (Raspberry strengthens the uterus and nettle gives you needed vit. K)<br/>
The cohoshes will speed things up sometimes (didn&#39;t work for me) and either primrose or flax seed oil on the cervix can help (didn&#39;t work for me). I would opt for the homeopathic version if I had an animal I was trying to induce. Just because it&#39;s easier and most definitely safe on animals and humans. I&#39;m not sure about how the herbs would affect a goat!:)<br/>
Try googling it and see if you can find something. I can&#39;t remember the two she gave me, but I had to take them every two hours until I went into labor. It took about six hours to work!<br/>

<br/>
We have primarily La Manchas, with a couple of Alpines and Boer/Nubian<br/>
crosses in the mix.  This doe has never drug things out so long before and<br/>
I&#39;m just a little concerned since we are headed out of town.  I gave her<br/>
some raspberry leaves on her ration today and she gobbled it up.  We will<br/>
see.<br/>

Do you mind me asking where you learned so much about herbals and<br/>
homeopathics?  I read a lot and talk with people and know more than most<br/>
people in general about them, but the amount of information is formidable.<br/>

It&#39;s something you could study your whole life and still just be starting to learn! I&#39;m self taught...started in High School by checking books out of the library, drawing the herbs and writing down the information. I tried growing herbs in my window (imagine a daylight basement, under a deck in the middle of winter and you&#39;ll know just how well they grew) which was a miserable failure, but enjoyable while they lasted. Poor plants.<br/>
I&#39;ve always adored the smell of fresh herbs from the garden, cooking and healing with them. Once you have a basic understanding of how they work and your most common herbs/homeopathics, it&#39;s just a matter of referencing information when something comes up.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t possibly remember the remedy for every ailment, but I keep books that help and the internet has some great sources too.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen amazing healing take place with the use of herbs and homeopathy...so that&#39;s pretty much all we use.<br/>
Out of four children, only one has been to the Doctor for ear infections and such when he was little (and he wasn&#39;t breastfed long enough and he received vax), the rest have had exactly two Doctor visits for being ill, between the three of them. My almost 3y.o. has never, ever been medicated and my 6 and 10y.o. have had antibiotics ONCE in their entire lives (and that was too much, had I known more at the time I could have avoided it).<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t trust a system in which pharmaceuticals have so much to gain from people being ill. There is a time and place for modern medicine, it just should not be the first line of defense...especially where children are concerned. There is long term damage to the liver and kidneys from most medications and the anti-depressants and ADD/ADHD type meds actually stimulate the same center of the brain as cocaine. Not a good idea for a developing brain. I can see why an adult would choose it in some cases, but I would do most anything to avoid that for my child unless it were absolutely necessary.<br/>
