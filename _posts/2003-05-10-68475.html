WE FOUND IT, WE FOUND IT!!!!!!! Doin&#39; the happy dance!  Actually, Nicholette <br/>
found it!  She was looking for her bathing suit so she could play in the <br/>
rain and it was under some clothes in a laundry basket in the laundry room!<br/>
<br/>
So, THAT&#39;S where I put it!  It&#39;s all coming flooding in now...the doorbell <br/>
rang and Ethan had just spilled the milk on th kitchen floor...I set my cell <br/>
phone and the envelope of money down to clean up the milk....grrrrr...why <br/>
couldn&#39;t my brain do this YESTERDAY?????<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, feeling OH so much better.  Now I don&#39;t have to tell hubby. &lt;beg&gt; <br/>
Wheeeeee! (I like that!)<br/>

Jayn&#39;s birth certificate, although my &quot;papers&quot; are where I thought I<br/>
left them. I remember deciding months ago to take them out of the<br/>
stationery storage box and put them ????? for safe keeping..but what did<br/>
I then do?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854772794">Oh, geez.  Everybody is losing important stuff, huh?  My husband <br/>
called to say he lost his jacket, possibly in a truck stop in Canada <br/>
but he&#39;s not sure, and it had his keys in it.  All of them can be <br/>
replaced by copying my keys except the freaking ignition key.  We <br/>
just got the van (used of course so the dealership can&#39;t help us) and <br/>
my door key was right but my ignition key was the wrong one.  What is <br/>
going on?  Some huge cosmic joke?  The curriculum gods are hiding the <br/>
personal belongings of the unschoolers until we convert.  Aaaaah!<br/>
