***I used to do this (even make whole families) using Sears and Roebuck <br/>
catalogues. Very absorbing, with backstories for all of them. And it<br/>
never <br/>
occurred to me to &quot;play&quot; it with anyone. I was relating to the paper<br/>
people <br/>
directly, like some omniscient being.  &lt;G&gt;  ***<br/>

People in the Sears catalog were my victims. My brother and I used to<br/>
&quot;tie&quot; them to the rail road tracks ( he had a Lionel train)  and we&#39;d see<br/>
how many times the train could run them over before they were cut into<br/>
pieces.   I don&#39;t think any of them were married first but I would have<br/>
loved the idea of hysterical loved ones watching the approaching train in<br/>
horror. <br/>

It&#39;s called ODD (obsessive dismemberment disorder) and it&#39;s not my fault.<br/>

I&#39;m getting better.  I have three pictures of my mother in law and only<br/>
one has the slightest parallel creases. &lt;g&gt;  I still dream about having a<br/>
nice clear photo of my fourth grade teacher, Miss Boyce, though. <br/>

Teresa/Goia -- to be honest, now that we know your real name, why don&#39;t <br/>
you just be Teresa? We don&#39;t find it hard to keep track of people - <br/>
heck, we have a bunch of &quot;Pams&quot; and even two of us are moderators and <br/>
both from California. We seem to manage to avoid confusion. Where are <br/>
you from? We can call you Teresa from ......., if we need to avoid <br/>
confusion.<br/>

&gt; I am from Texas..It&#39;s kind of funny, in Mexico, every time I told<br/>
&gt; folks my name (on vacations) they would reply.. OH, my mother&#39;s name<br/>
&gt; is Teresa!.. lol.  Teresa is one of the most common names in the<br/>
&gt; world!.    I can be Teresa from Texas, and give up my fantasy of<br/>
&gt; being the exotic Goia.. LOL.. I will have to change my name on my<br/>
&gt; yahoo profile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Teresa from TX.<br/>
