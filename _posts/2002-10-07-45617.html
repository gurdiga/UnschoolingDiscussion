&lt;&lt; All it means is that Andrea Yates was wrong to kill her kids.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
IF (I didn&#39;t read all the gory details) a woman did not want to have children <br/>
but was told (and believed) that GOD wanted her to have children...<br/>
<br/>
IF a woman doesn&#39;t want to have children but a man pressures her and gets her <br/>
pregnant against her will (with or without blaming God...<br/>
<br/>
IF a woman isn&#39;t taking good care fo the children she has...<br/>
<br/>
THEN that woman should not have more children.<br/>
<br/>
For some women, one is too many.  Either their mothering instinct never kicks <br/>
in, or they&#39;re more interested in going out than taking care of their child <br/>
or something, but some women are not good moms.<br/>
<br/>
I wish every woman who ever wanted a child and was unable to have one (or <br/>
another one) could magically have had one and every woman who accidently got <br/>
pregnant could have NOT done so.  I wish every woman who ever had a baby to <br/>
entrap a man or to get more welfare or to have another person to love her <br/>
would have had the simple positive regard and love it would have taken for <br/>
her to be content without creating a life for her immediate selfish reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Had I started sooner, I might have had more children.  We were undecided for <br/>
years about whether to have children or not, and Kirby was an oops, but we <br/>
really liked being parents.  I decided not to have any more after three <br/>
cesareans and not to have any in my 40&#39;s.  I know people do it and live to go <br/>
to graduations and marriages.  I chose not to risk it for various personal <br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
To say it&#39;s not okay to blame Andrea Yates for being Christian is unfair in a <br/>
conversation in which God&#39;s &quot;law&quot; is being invoked.  She homeschooled because <br/>
she was Christian, as I understand it--not from any belief about cognition or <br/>
child development.   I could be wrong, but if she had children and <br/>
homeschooled them because she was Christian then it&#39;s a Christianity issue, <br/>
not a homeschooling issue.<br/>
