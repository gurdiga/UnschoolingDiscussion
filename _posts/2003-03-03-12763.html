<div id="ygrps-yiv-695314445">Brenda, All I can say is a very facetious, &quot;Amen Sister!!&quot;:):) I have <br/>
felt that way for a long time. My one long time friend and I are <br/>
Christians and unschoolers, all the other homeschoolers we know are <br/>
Christian Structured Curriculum types. They are wonderful people, <br/>
they think we are nuts, wrong, worldly, lazy a bad example for the <br/>
public as to what homeschooling is about.<br/>
<br/>
 I have another very close friend who is on the board of  &#39;Christian <br/>
Home Educators of Ohio&#39; I love this woman, our children are of <br/>
similar ages, our belief in God is the same and we even have a <br/>
similar &quot;routine&quot;. We both have the habit of getting up in the <br/>
morning, doing some chores, eating breakfast, reading out loud to <br/>
children for awhile and then getting on with the day. The difference <br/>
is what we do next (and that I do not follow the routine when nobody <br/>
feels like it!), her family goes off to various quiet places and <br/>
works on academics while mine goes off wherever and does whatever and <br/>
it is seldom quiet or academic. She and I put on a seminar every <br/>
spring for parents of high school student. I volunteer to help her <br/>
every year because she lets me talk. I want people to know that when <br/>
(not if!) they get burned out with the traditional high school <br/>
nonsense, there IS another way!! They think I am a little weird, I&#39;ve <br/>
been made fun of some but I just tease them back. <br/>
<br/>
I am a member of this group because I truly love the people and my <br/>
children have friends there, especially among the long time members. <br/>
I feel a need to be available to people who are just starting out. My <br/>
oldest is &#39;graduating&#39; this Spring and everyone is asking me why he <br/>
isn&#39;t participating in the group&#39;s graduation ceremony. When I tell <br/>
them it is because he doesn&#39;t want to spent money to rent a stupid <br/>
looking blue gown I get some funny looks but I think it is good for <br/>
them to see that there really is another way to think about <br/>
homeschooling and that one CAN be an unschooler and a Christian at <br/>
the same time. Although I admit, sometimes I do get sucked into peer <br/>
pressure and care too much about what people think about me but I am <br/>
finally feeling comfortable discussing unschooling with those who <br/>
disagree. It feels good and actually, I am more comfortable in the <br/>
group now that I have &quot;come out of the closet&quot; so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
The sad thing is that Christians seem to think that following <br/>
a &quot;rigorous&quot; academic program has something to do with being <br/>
righteous. From what I have read in my Bible, that isn&#39;t in there. <br/>
Also, Proverbs6 about Train up a child in the way he should go... <br/>
means encourage him according to his natural bent, not beat the sin <br/>
out of him. There is some misunderstanding about that. I think Jesus <br/>
was an Unschooler! He and his disciples went around doing life and <br/>
talked about it, there was no classroom. I don&#39;t mean to get on a <br/>
soapbox but it just frustrates me to no end that so few people get <br/>
that Christianity is about freedom!!!<br/>
<br/>
To end on a humorous note... once I was at a home birth meeting, <br/>
expecting baby#4, and another pregnant lady who was a pagan also <br/>
expecting her 4th child told me that her friends were teasing her <br/>
that if she had any  more babies, people would start to think she was <br/>
a Christian! I couldn&#39;t stop laughing...<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day        -Elissa</div>

<br/>
Thank you very much..... I really don&#39;t think I could share that with <br/>
some of the people I know ....too bad.....It just goes to show that <br/>
it really is important to learn the language when you open a <br/>
restaurant in another country...I wonder if any English words sound <br/>
like Japanese *bad words*?<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve had lots of discussion in our house about bad words and what makes them bad.  We recently watched Hair.  I&#39;d forgotten about the song &quot;Sodomy&quot;.  Later, Lisa asked my why the word felletio (sp?) sounded familiar.  I said maybe because of the name Felicia?  She said why would someone want to name their child something that sounded like a bad word?<br/>

&lt;&lt; I wonder if any English words sound <br/>

<br/>
Probably.<br/>
<br/>
And within languages there&#39;s always that danger that a particular accent will <br/>
cause words to sound really bad.  Like the many little children who can&#39;t say <br/>
&quot;tr&quot; yet and so call trucks &quot;fucks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A Mormon family we know had a daughter who went on a student exchange trip to <br/>
Japan.  First she attended the language school in SLC which trains the <br/>
missionaries.  I think she was 14 or 15 when she went.  She went to Japan and <br/>
the school assembled, standing in lines in the assembly room, while the <br/>
principal introduced her formally and then she made a speech herself, in <br/>
Japanese!   She told us she said that she was glad to be there, hoped to make <br/>
friends, and would study hard.   Everyone stayed very polite and quiet, and <br/>
when the assembly was dismissed, she said a small group of girls came over to <br/>
her, and said that her Japanese had been very good, but that she should know <br/>
a certain difference in a phrase, which they told her, and the other VERY <br/>
close phrase, which she had said, and they told her how she had said it, <br/>
which meant that she was on her period.<br/>
<br/>
So even though she stood up and told all these kids she was on her period, <br/>
they didn&#39;t laugh and they weren&#39;t mean to her.<br/>
<br/>
She had a great time there and learned to play koto and sing, and did art and <br/>
calligraphy.<br/>

<br/>
The name &quot;Enco&quot; meant something bad somewhere, so when the company went <br/>
international they searched for a set of phonemes that meant nothing in any <br/>
known language, and that&#39;s where Exxon came from.  It was chosen for being <br/>
multi-lingually meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
They couldn&#39;t sell &quot;Novas&quot; in anyplace south of the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
In Europe, cars tend to be numbered instead of named, because of the European <br/>
multi-lingual situation.   So you get Mercedes XL900 or whatever (I don&#39;t <br/>
know the real numbers).  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know whether Japanese cars in Japan have spiffy names in <br/>
Japanese?  or just numbers?<br/>

<br/>
A quote from the snopes page: &quot;First of all, the phrase &quot;no va&quot;<br/>
(literally &quot;doesn&#39;t go&quot;) and the word &quot;nova&quot; are distinct entities with<br/>
different pronunciations in Spanish: the former is two words and is<br/>
pronounced with the accent on the second word; the latter is one word<br/>
with the accent on the first syllable. Assuming that Spanish speakers<br/>
would naturally see the word &quot;nova&quot; as equivalent to the phrase &quot;no va&quot;<br/>
and think &quot;Hey, this car doesn&#39;t go!&quot; is akin to assuming that English<br/>
speakers woud spurn a dinette set sold under the name Notable because<br/>
nobody wants a dinette set that doesn&#39;t include a table. &quot;<br/>

<br/>
I wrote a long post and the ruined it trying to paste something in.  <br/>
I feel particularly stupid since I did that YESTERDAY too.<br/>
<br/>
A teenaged Mormon friend from SLC was an exchange student in Japan.  Having <br/>
the advantage of being from a prominent Mormon family, she went to the <br/>
language school there which Missionaries use.  So she had Japanese, and off <br/>
she went.<br/>
<br/>
She told us that first there was a school assembly, where the kids stood in <br/>
lines by grade and she was introduced formally.  I think she was 14 or 15 at <br/>
the time.  <br/>
<br/>
The principal made a speech introducing her, and then our American friend <br/>
made her own speech in Japanese.  She said it was just a formal sort of &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
glad to be here, thank you, I hope to make friend and I will study hard&quot; or <br/>
some such.  <br/>
<br/>
When the assembly was dismissed, a small group of girls came up to her and <br/>
she said very politely said her Japanese was very good, but that there was <br/>
one small error, understandable, because two phrases were nearly the same.  <br/>
So they showed her the difference, and told her without being mean or making <br/>
fun of her that what she had actually said was that she was on her period.<br/>
<br/>
So an American teenager stood up and told a whole school, girls and boys, <br/>
that she was on her period, and nobody laughed or pointed.   I thought that <br/>
was cool.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Names. From a couple of webpages, apparently the Japanese started the trend<br/>
of interesting sounding but meaningless names. I see lots of US model names<br/>
and the Japanese students we hosted recognized what cars we were talking<br/>
about when we said we had a Camry and a Civic.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a really long list at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://crossroads.net/honyaku/nihonsha.html.">http://crossroads.net/honyaku/nihonsha.html.</a><br/>
It says they were translated from katakana (the Japanese syllabary (sp? I<br/>
can spell the Japanese word, not so sure about the English word ;-)) but I<br/>
don&#39;t know if they&#39;re all written in katakana or if some are written in<br/>
kanji (the Japanese symbols) So is the Dihatsu Applause written with the<br/>
symbol for Applause or is it written out to sound sort of like the English<br/>
word for Applause? (Which might be something like a-pa-ra-s(u). (The &quot;u&quot;<br/>
part of they &quot;su&quot; syllable isn&#39;t usually pronounced at the end.))<br/>
<br/>
Is Hikaru on this list?<br/>
<br/>
And also apparently the Japanese have the reputation of coming up with some<br/>
of the weirdest names. These don&#39;t all appear on the long list but some<br/>
appeared on other lists of odd names.<br/>
<br/>
*    Daihatsu Atrai Aero Down Billet<br/>
*    Daihatsu Kid Aero Down Custom<br/>
*    Daihatsu Naked<br/>
*    Honda Life Dunk<br/>
*    Mazda Bongo Friendee<br/>
*    Mitsubishi Chariot Grandis Royal<br/>
*    Nissan Bluebird Sylphy<br/>
*    Subaru Pleo Nesta<br/>
*    Suzuki Every Landy<br/>
*    Toyota Avensis Versa<br/>
*    Toyota Corolla Runx<br/>
*    Toyota Townace Noach<br/>
