<div id="ygrps-yiv-326803529">Thanks Ang. That is how I want to be soon. It is hard because my mother is a teacher and at first was like yeah you can do this. But as of late has been like do you know what you are doing? Why are they not learning this or that. Your son is not reading yet. I have five children - four girls and one boy in age range from 2 to 11. So It has not been quite that easy. And THOUGH it is my right to homeschool my children, here, it is frowned upon. I mean they even try to throw you in jail and take the kids away if they can. And to think I live in the territory of the US! There has been some strides made here, but for the most part you only find out about other homeschoolers by accident. I am lucky to have found the founder of the homeschool association here, but My GOSH is this work. But in a good way. I know what I want to teach them, but it is putting it all together so that they can understand what I want. For the most part I let them have a go at what they want to study for the day.<br/>
<br/>
I am finding that I am learning new things to so that is what is making this venture fun for me as well.<br/>

  &gt; . I have just recently decided to home school my children and finding it <br/>
  &gt; some what of a challenge. But I am jumping in here because of the food and <br/>
  &gt; eating issue. <br/>
<br/>
  I think it all kind of goes together. Following your instincts, your <br/>
  intuition, not listening to all the popular advice and experts as far as <br/>
  diet, education, and parenting. That&#39;s why we are all here, right? I was once <br/>
  a schooling, dieting, detachment parent, never trusting myself or my <br/>
  children. Now I glad to be an unschooler, attachment parent, diet rebel LOL. <br/>
