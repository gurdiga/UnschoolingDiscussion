<div id="ygrps-yiv-184380231">Last night Dylan said &quot;Does anyone care if I go on-line?&quot;  He was<br/>
checking to see if anyone else was just then planning to use the computer<br/>
or if one of us was expecting a phone call. <br/>
<br/>
In his most fatherly voice dh, David, said, &quot;That depends, are you going<br/>
to be looking at pornography?&quot; <br/>
Witty son, not missing a beat replied, &quot;Almost certainly.&quot;   <br/>
Dh, &quot;By all means, then.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He did go on-line but he read book reviews at Amazon and went to the<br/>
website for the H.P. Lovecraft film festival (I know because he called me<br/>
in to look at the Cthulhu fish car emblem.)   And then he came and<br/>
watched &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; with us. <br/>
<br/>
And in light of Robyn&#39;s great post about TV content I thought I&#39;d tell<br/>
you what an always unschooled, no TV limits, thirteen year old checked<br/>
out at the library. <br/>
<br/>
One book, Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlen.  Three documentaries,<br/>
&quot;World War II,&quot;  The History Channel&#39;s &quot;The Nazis Helped Into Power,&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Prehistoric Life.&quot;   Four movies: The Marx Brother&#39;s &quot;Room Service,&quot; <br/>
&quot;Battlestar Galactic,&quot;  &quot;Malcolm X,&quot; and &quot;Vertigo.&quot;   And four episodes<br/>
of Monty Python&#39;s Flying Circus. <br/>
<br/>
Deb L<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For yesterday is already a memory and tomorrow is only a vision, <br/>
but today well lived makes every yesterday a memory of happiness <br/>
and every tomorrow a vision of hope.  <br/>
Look well, therefore, to this day.&quot;<br/>

Holly has made a website of her own, first time.   Her &quot;real one&quot; is one I&#39;ve <br/>
kept for years, and I have offered several times to let her take it over, but <br/>
she doesn&#39;t want to mess with HTML.     So she made another one.   She asked <br/>
me how to spell &quot;mesmerize&quot; but otherwise I didn&#39;t even KNOW about it until it <br/>
had four pages.   Other kids she knows from XBox live showed her the site, I <br/>
guess.    She links to a thing called &quot;falling woman&quot; that her friend in <br/>
England showed her.   It IS mesmerizing (and a fun thing for anyone interested in <br/>
programming or art to look at).   So Holly did NOT do that page. &lt;g&gt;   (If the <br/>
woman gets stuck, you can lift/guide/pull her with the mouse.<br/>

Some people are afraid of the internet.<br/>
It still stuns me, the fear some parents have.<br/>
<br/>
MILLIONS of parents who will send their kids to school (whatever all and <br/>
wherever all THAT might entail, once the kids walk away from the mom&#39;s sight), but <br/>
won&#39;t let them sit in their own homes and look at different sites on the <br/>
internet.    <br/>
<br/>
The DVDs   and videos that have been watched by kids in the absence of adults <br/>
(sometimes with, but not at the instigation of adults, I guess I mean) in our <br/>
house lately:<br/>
<br/>
Weird Al videos<br/>
The Wiz<br/>
Sin City<br/>
The Little Mermaid (remember my youngest is 13, and the boys can sing all <br/>
those songs &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
a trivial pursuit popular culture game involving a DVD was played for HOURS <br/>
the other night by over a dozen teens, half a dozen or more of whom ended up <br/>
spending the night because of it.<br/>
<br/>
The same weekend, the night before that, Holly was invited and then prevented <br/>
from spending the night because she was a girl.   Invited by the boy and <br/>
encouraged by the mom of the other boys (whom she&#39;s known for five years or so) <br/>
but the mom called me before it all really started and said they would bring <br/>
Holly home when it was time.    &quot;What it was time&quot; meant, to her, before bedtime. <br/>
  I poked at her a little to get her to say exactly what the deal was, and <br/>
she said &quot;Because she&#39;s a girl.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First time in 19 years of parenting that there&#39;s been such a blatant bit of <br/>
discrimination.   I was more amused than offended.   There&#39;s more to the story. <br/>
  I should tell it somewhere.    unschooling.info maybe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, that&#39;s intense.  It&#39;s both peaceful and horrifying at the same <br/>
time.  I just heard news this morning of a friend from college who died <br/>
last week in Namibia.  He drowned in the rapids of a river.  He was <br/>
doing what he loves most--exploring the world--and I like to imagine <br/>
that he was peaceful in his last moments.  This computer graphic made me <br/>
think of him in his total surrender to the river.<br/>
<br/>
In case anyone&#39;s interested, here&#39;s a short article about him. <br/>

<br/>
He was a world renowned obsidian knapper and he named his own species of <br/>
fossil invertebrate after Frank Zappa.  He used to climb trees in the <br/>
quadrangle and wedge bowling balls firmly into them.  The next day there <br/>
would be a crowd of students looking up into the tree and wondering how <br/>
on earth a bowling ball got up there.  My roommate and I always called <br/>
campus police on him every time he did it for fear that a ball would <br/>
fall down and kill someone.  In fact it was pretty unlikely that one <br/>
would fall--he really wedged them in there!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I don&#39;t know why I just shared all this here--I guess I&#39;m still <br/>
reeling from the news. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Kelly.  Yes, he really was.  He named his cat &quot;Pancreas&quot; just so <br/>
he could run around his suburban neighborhood yelling &quot;Pancreas!  Pancreas!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I will be thinking of him when I visit the Quad at Wash U while I&#39;m <br/>
attending the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in St. Louis, <br/>
October 6-9, 2005!<br/>
There we go--back on topic ;)<br/>
