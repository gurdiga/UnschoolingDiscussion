<div id="ygrps-yiv-335670776">A Letter from His Holiness, XIVth Dalai Lama        12<br/>
September<br/>
01<br/>
<br/>
Dear friends around the world;<br/>
<br/>
       The events of this day cause every thinking<br/>
person to stop their <br/>
daily lives, whatever is going on in them, and to<br/>
ponder deeply the larger <br/>
questions of life. We search again for not only the<br/>
meaning of life, but the <br/>
purpose of our individual and collective experience as<br/>
we have created <br/>
it-and we look earnestly for ways in which we might<br/>
recreate ourselves anew <br/>
as a human species, so that we will never treat each<br/>
other this way again.<br/>
<br/>
       The hour has come for us to demonstrate at the<br/>
highest level our most <br/>
extraordinary thought about Who We Really Are.<br/>
<br/>
       There are two possible responses to what has<br/>
occurred today.<br/>
The first comes from love, the second from fear.<br/>
<br/>
       If we come from fear we may panic and do<br/>
things-as individuals and as <br/>
nations-that could only cause further damage. If we<br/>
come from love we will <br/>
find refuge and strength, even as we provide it to<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
       This is the moment of your ministry. This is<br/>
the time of teaching.<br/>
What you teach at this time, through your every word<br/>
and action right now,<br/>
will remain as indelible lessons in the hearts and<br/>
minds of those<br/>
whose lives you touch, both now, and for years to<br/>
come.<br/>
<br/>
       We will set the course for tomorrow, today. At<br/>
this hour.<br/>
In this moment.  Let us seek not to pinpoint blame,<br/>
but to pinpoint cause.<br/>
<br/>
       Unless we take this time to look at the cause<br/>
of our experience, we <br/>
will never remove ourselves from the experiences it<br/>
creates.<br/>
Instead, we will forever live in fear of retribution<br/>
from those within the <br/>
human family<br/>
who feel aggrieved, and, likewise, seek retribution<br/>
from them.<br/>
<br/>
       To us the reasons are clear. We have not<br/>
learned the most basic human <br/>
lessons.<br/>
We have not remembered the most basic human truths.<br/>
We have not understood the most basic spiritual<br/>
wisdom.<br/>
In short, we have not been listening to God, and<br/>
because we have not,<br/>
we watch ourselves do ungodly things.<br/>
<br/>
       The message we hear from all sources of truth<br/>
is clear: We are all <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
       That is a message the human race has largely<br/>
ignored.  Forgetting <br/>
this truth is the only cause of hatred and war, and<br/>
the way to remember is <br/>
simple:<br/>
<br/>
       Love, this and every moment.<br/>
<br/>
       If we could love even those who have attacked<br/>
us, and seek to <br/>
understand why they have done so, what then would be<br/>
our response? Yet if we <br/>
meet negativity with negativity,<br/>
rage with rage, attack with attack, what then will be<br/>
the outcome?<br/>
<br/>
       These are the questions that are placed before<br/>
the human race today. <br/>
They are questions that we have failed to answer for<br/>
thousands of years. <br/>
Failure to answer them now could eliminate the need to<br/>
answer them at all.<br/>
<br/>
       If we want the beauty of the world that we have<br/>
co-created to be <br/>
experienced by our children and our children&#39;s<br/>
children, we will have to <br/>
become spiritual activists right here, right now, and<br/>
cause that to happen. <br/>
We must choose to be at cause in the matter.<br/>
<br/>
       So, talk with God today. Ask God for help, for<br/>
counsel and advice, <br/>
for insight and for strength and for inner peace and<br/>
for deep wisdom.<br/>
Ask God on this day to show us how to show up in the<br/>
world in away that will <br/>
cause the world itself to change. And join all those<br/>
people around the world <br/>
who are praying right now, adding your Light to the<br/>
Light that dispels all <br/>
fear.<br/>
<br/>
       That is the challenge that is placed before<br/>
every thinking person <br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
       Today the human soul asks the question: What<br/>
can I do to preserve the <br/>
beauty and the wonder of our world and to eliminate<br/>
the anger and hatred and <br/>
the disparity that inevitably causes it - in that part<br/>
of the world which I <br/>
touch?<br/>
<br/>
       Please seek to answer that question today, with<br/>
all the magnificence <br/>
that is You. What can you do TODAY...this very moment?<br/>
<br/>
       A central teaching in most spiritual traditions<br/>
is: What you wish to <br/>
experience,<br/>
provide for another.<br/>
<br/>
       Look to see, now, what it is you wish to<br/>
experience-in your own life, <br/>
and in the world. Then see if there is another for<br/>
whom you maybe the source <br/>
of that. If you wish to experience peace, provide<br/>
peace for another.<br/>
<br/>
       If you wish to know that you are safe, cause<br/>
another to know that <br/>
they are safe.<br/>
<br/>
       If you wish to better understand seemingly<br/>
incomprehensible things, <br/>
help another to better understand.<br/>
<br/>
       If you wish to heal your own sadness or anger,<br/>
seek to heal the <br/>
sadness<br/>
or anger of another.<br/>
<br/>
       Those others are waiting for you now. They are<br/>
looking to you for <br/>
guidance, for help, for courage, for strength, for<br/>
understanding, and for <br/>
assurance at this hour. Most of all, they are looking<br/>
to you for love.<br/>
<br/>
       My religion is very simple. My religion is<br/>
kindness.<br/>
<br/>
