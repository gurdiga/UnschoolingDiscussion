Maybe you could think of all those repeated questions as training <br/>
for new &quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers.  It gives someone else to get <br/>
their feet wet. And the &quot;big guns&quot; can handle the tough ones.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
Good point! &lt;BWG&gt; VERY good point! Doesn&#39;t make it any less tiring, but <br/>
excellent point! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ve also noticed recently that a few of the oldies are MIA, but then I&#39;ve <br/>
seen Susan and Sylvia and Sheila and a few others hitting the questions with <br/>
excellent responses!<br/>
<br/>
OK, you&#39;ve made me feel better! <br/>

Nobody is doing that, Rachel, are they? This was somebody wondering <br/>
about how people learn - noticing the phenomenon of people saying <br/>
they&#39;d read a lot and yet asking basic questions that it seems they <br/>
would have learned from their reading. It happens frequently. It is <br/>
interesting to think about why it happens. It doesn&#39;t mean that us <br/>
&quot;oldtimers&quot; are burned out and resentful and sending newbies away.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That was probably MY post! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I DID burn out and go away!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m back! &lt;G&gt; Maybe I should have waited! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen others come and go these last few years. We have a lot of &quot;new <br/>
experienced&quot; unschoolers right now giving out good advice. I&#39;m glad. I enjoyed <br/>
watching them as I shut up for a while.<br/>
<br/>
The original letter that Sandra posted WAS saying that it can be frustrating <br/>
to watch the same questions be asked again and again after the newbies have <br/>
already said they&#39;ve read and read. Then I went on *my* tirade! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It IS an interesting phenomenon: why do people feel that they need to repeat <br/>
a common question? The original thoughts were laziness and ....what? I can&#39;t <br/>
remember. <br/>
<br/>
Looked it up:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some claim to have done LOTS of reading, but then still ask a repeat <br/>
question.  So, do you think this is due to laziness and they were lying about <br/>
doing a <br/>
lot of reading, or are some people simply unable to relate to what&#39;s being <br/>
said unless it&#39;s said directly to them?  I know these aren&#39;t the only two <br/>
possibilities, but they seem the most likely to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;re just products of the school system and can&#39;t seem to gather the <br/>
info any other way. Direct questioning.<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler, I prefer to go straight to the source. So I understand that <br/>
part. And like many of my school classmates, I didn&#39;t want to be laughed at <br/>
if I asked a &quot;stupid question&quot;. So maybe *I* had no problem reading the entire <br/>
unschooling.comedy message boards for three months (and keeping up on all new <br/>
messages) before I posted my first word! (I remember what it was, too! It <br/>
wasn&#39;t all that bright! &lt;G&gt; But I understood it by then!) <br/>
<br/>
I was always in awe of my friend, George, who would ask *anything*---no <br/>
matter HOW stupid----if he didn&#39;t understand it! Frequently, it was the same <br/>
question I was thinking about but was afraid to ask. But I just figured I could look <br/>
it up later. George had the balls (well, yeah!) to ask then and there.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe it has to do with (yikes!) school and how we felt about asking for <br/>
help---or with our personalities. It takes a lot for me to ask a question that <br/>
I could look up on my own. So if I ask something---just know I&#39;m SWEATING it <br/>
out as I type! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

As for &quot;why&quot; we ask the questions even though we&#39;ve read, it&#39;s human <br/>
nature.  We need to feel special.  Like &quot;our&quot; situation is <br/>
different.  Also, even though I&#39;ve read several unschooling books and <br/>
devoured the websites, they still don&#39;t replace &quot;personal&quot; <br/>
information.  When I read about someone&#39;s experience in a book they <br/>
seem distant, less believable. It&#39;s different to come on a site or <br/>
hear a voice tell you the same thing. You KNOW they exist because you <br/>
can see or hear them.  But since almost anyone can write a book about <br/>
anything, it seems less believable. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like the *perfect* time to remind people to be sure to be at the Live <br/>
& Learn Unschooling Conference this August in Peabody, MA. You&#39;ll get to SEE <br/>
these people in action with their children and actually ask direct questions. <br/>
They&#39;ll be even MORE real IRL! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-966399122">Personally, I just like to talk about new ideas with anyone who will listen, <br/>
well let me restate that, I want to talk about it with someone who understands <br/>
what I am talking about and will help me talk it through. Sometimes that is <br/>
on a list and sometimes it is in person or on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
I just need it, I do read whatever I can on whatever I am interested in but <br/>
then I need real life application so to speak. When we first started hsing I <br/>
read everything I could find on the subject. I have since found out that not <br/>
everyone goes that route but that is the way I always do it. The Internet has <br/>
been a blessing to me, I always used the library and bookstores before but the <br/>
Internet is like brain ice-cream.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I read the books but hsing at our house at first did not resemble any <br/>
of the books or not that I could see. I had pulled kids out of school and <br/>
they were not wide eyed and eager to learn. I felt like a failure and I was <br/>
terrified my DH would make me put them back in school. I needed someone to reassure <br/>
me that we would be OK. <br/>
Our hsing life still does not resemble any picture I had in my mind when I <br/>
first started and had read all about hsing. Maybe people just need help <br/>
translating what they read into their real life family, I know I did.<br/>

I know, but that was the point. People say that they&#39;ve read here or on the <br/>
message boards and STILL ask the same questions. <br/>
<br/>
The question Sandra asked was WHY?<br/>
<br/>
The same &quot;old-timers&quot; will answer the same questions again----just from <br/>
different newbies.<br/>
<br/>
What causes that? Is it laziness? or are they lying? Those were the two <br/>
original thoughts.Or is it a need for it to be specific to a certain situation? a <br/>
certain person? the personal touch?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see the same thing happen on many lists. Just this week on our Ohio list we <br/>
got the same question about where to find activities from two different <br/>
people. (Same sex, same age kids, etc.) I do understand because I get tired of <br/>
that, I wish they would at least read back a week in the archives but many don&#39;t. <br/>
Maybe they don&#39;t know how, I don&#39;t know, I answered again. <br/>
<br/>
We also get people all of the time who join the list and want from step one <br/>
how to hs. I finally put together a form email I send them and tell them to <br/>
read what&#39;s at the links I am sending and then come back with their more detailed <br/>
questions. I have noticed that not a lot of people answer anymore, I figure <br/>
it is answering burnout. I will sometimes wait to see if someone else will <br/>
answer but if no one does I do. <br/>

&lt;&lt; The question Sandra asked was WHY? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I passed on someone else&#39;s question.<br/>
My first guess was &quot;they&#39;re used to being spoonfed.&quot;  <br/>
But I hoped others would have nicer answers and they did!<br/>
<br/>
One thing I truly think is that what we some people call &quot;reading&quot; is not <br/>
what other people consider to be reading.   I&#39;m reading &quot;What&#39;s Eating Gilbert <br/>
Grape.&quot;  If someone asks me a question, I might not know the answer, like which <br/>
scene came before another or what a character&#39;s name is, or how old one or the <br/>
other was when the dad died, etc.   But if I were going to go to a Gilbert <br/>
Grape discussion board I would maybe read it again, and more carefully, before I <br/>
said &quot;I&#39;ve read the book and I thought...&quot;   Or I would be folding down more <br/>
corners and putting stars by more passages.<br/>
<br/>
But in school if a teacher &quot;makes you read&quot; a book, don&#39;t lots of people just <br/>
kind of scan it line by line, turn the page, scan kind of sounding out the <br/>
words in your head like you&#39;re reading aloud to yourself without even TRYING to <br/>
think about what the important parts are or what the author was trying to <br/>
convey?<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a school-kind of reading which is &quot;read the chapter and <br/>
answer the questions.&quot;  The really bright kids tended to read the questions first <br/>
and then scan for the answers.  I liked to read it first and see if I could <br/>
answer the questions without looking back (as if it were a test) but I rarely <br/>
could.  I would have never denied having &quot;read it&quot; though, because as schools had <br/>
defined reading, if I dragged my eyes over every line without skipping a <br/>
line, I had &quot;read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Comprehension,&quot; now, that was a whole different skill (at school).<br/>
<br/>
And maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m so calm about my (weird?) idea that phonetic <br/>
sounding out isn&#39;t reading, ONLY comprehension is reading.<br/>

but it was probably somewhat true in my case.  <br/>
<br/>
It IS frustrating. I see it on other boards even more than I see it <br/>
here.  But once someone has been &quot;school damaged&quot; to the point where <br/>
she can only learn if she&#39;s spoon fed, will she ever get on the path <br/>
of good unschooling if someone doesn&#39;t start her out by spoonfeeding <br/>
her?  <br/>
<br/>
The person who needs to be spoonfed doesn&#39;t think she has a problem.  <br/>
She likely went to school and got very good grades and thinks of <br/>
herself as an intelligent person.  Maybe she wants to learn about <br/>
unschooling but doesn&#39;t know how if someone doesn&#39;t spoonfeed her.  <br/>

I love to read and always have.  I will read anything that strikes <br/>
my interest, from romantic fiction to non-fiction.  I have shelves <br/>
of books that I have yet to get to but know that I will love, when I <br/>
get the chance to read them.  Having those shelves doesn&#39;t stop me <br/>
from buying any other book that I think I&#39;ll like to read at some <br/>
time.  Right now I am reading 3 books....Dumbing Us Down, Who&#39;s <br/>
Looking Out For You, and People of the Earth (thank you to whom ever <br/>
on this list suggested that series, I&#39;m loving them).<br/>
<br/>
My reason for posting is this point.  I was in the advanced classes <br/>
in HS.  In my english classes, we had to read 3 books during the <br/>
summer and write reports on them.  Most of the kids would skim the <br/>
books and turn in a basic report.  Not me, I loved to read anyway <br/>
so, I read the books, enjoyed them, and would turn in these really <br/>
detailed long reports.  I would stay after school or class and <br/>
discuss my thoughts about the books with my teachers.  When I was in <br/>
the 11th grade, we were assigned a book that I had already read.  <br/>
When I told my teacher that I had already read it, he told me to <br/>
pick any other book by that same author and do the report on that <br/>
one.  He even let me leave class and read the book while they were <br/>
discussing the one that I had already read.  I did the report, <br/>
turned it in and discussed it with him after class.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m not really sure what my point was.  :)  Except that my <br/>
teachers tended to leave me alone and lot (knowing that I would get <br/>
the work done).  As a result, I really learned the subject instead <br/>
of learing for the test and then forgetting it (like most the kids <br/>
in my classes did).<br/>
