<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610156129">We have the same situation.  I handle paying the bills, but I also hate<br/>
checkbooks (and mailing things - it&#39;s almost a phobia or something).  We&#39;ve<br/>
had  checking accounts for almost thirty years, but I finally got tired of<br/>
giving the bank all our &quot;extra&quot; money when either of us bounced something,<br/>
so about four years ago I just didn&#39;t order any more checks for the<br/>
checkbook.  I either pay bills in cash at the store, use a credit card (then<br/>
use my bank debit card to pay that off), and just recently I have begun<br/>
paying things on-line.  I keep the checkbook by the phone because there are<br/>
a couple of bills I pay by &quot;check&quot; over the phone, so I have to have the<br/>
numbers.  It&#39;s always funny when they tell me, &quot;What is the check #?  Be<br/>
sure you void that check!&quot;  I just go by the list in there where I write it<br/>
down and tell them the next number.  But I haven&#39;t used any $ on checks in a<br/>
long time, and I haven&#39;t paid the bank anything for bounced ones, either!<br/>

 we&#39;ve made a choice that is worth it to us. I want my kids to make <br/>

 don&#39;t want them to pay up for something they care nothing for. <br/>

&lt;&lt; And I would also say that, in the midst of our training them to be <br/>
 obedient, and giving them chores that they DON&#39;T WANT TO DO, my <br/>

<br/>
I disagree completely.<br/>
Although there was a time I would have nodded my head in agreement at your <br/>
entire post.<br/>
I am not &quot;training&quot; anyone. I am modeling and guiding. But to train obedience <br/>
is dangerous in my opinion, because you get people that don&#39;t question things.<br/>
I want my children to be thinkers, if that means being &quot;disobedient&quot; then at <br/>
least I know their will is intact!!<br/>
And I think happy people are the best equipped to help others. I believe we <br/>
are born with a sense of justice and empathy. If we are given empathy, we <br/>
want to give it to others.<br/>
If we are given fair treatment, we want others to be treated fairly. If we <br/>
are given love, we can share love. If we are given peaceful, joyful <br/>
childhoods we can carry that for the rest of our lives.<br/>
The more I live this lifestyle and the less I try to coerce anyone, the more <br/>
I see the inherent goodness shine forth.<br/>

<br/>
My  husband does all of ours.<br/>
When I was doing my own, years ago, my method of &quot;balancing&quot; if I got <br/>
confused was letting one account settle while using another one for a few <br/>
months.  Then I would go back to the first, see if there were any outstanding <br/>
checks likely to be out there (like checks to small clubs, or personal <br/>
friends who might not have deposited them) and then start over with the <br/>
bank&#39;s balance.  <br/>
Meanwhile, the other account was settling out.  <br/>
<br/>
But Keith really likes to mess with bills and makes charts on the computer of <br/>
what the curve looks like, and how much we paid for gas and electricity in <br/>
other Januaries in years past, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a math patterns puzzle for him and I thank him sweetly and warmly and <br/>
sincerely and often, because while he&#39;s doing it, I don&#39;t have to.   Someday <br/>
if he can&#39;t or isn&#39;t around, I&#39;ll have to go back to two accounts, maybe! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 Or I&#39;ll take boarders in exchange for checkbook balancing and bathroom <br/>
cleaning and cooking.   Maybe college of education students, who can be <br/>
radicalized by hanging around my house even if my kids are all gone. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

and if you already subscribe you should consider going to the newsstand to <br/>
buy another one just so their sales numbers will go up, and the next time <br/>
someone asks you about homeschooling you can gift them with that extra copy.  <br/>

<br/>
My husband and I HATE housework. I cook because I love it. So we have <br/>
made it a point --even way before having kids-- to clean as a team. <br/>
Misery needs company. Well, the kids get all excited and actually have <br/>
fun :-P They take turns vacuuming and mopping. They love squirting and <br/>
wiping things.<br/>
<br/>
We had 12 loads of laundry (if you do not live in NYC, you may not <br/>
understand why people don&#39;t run out to do the laundry). It&#39;s been icky <br/>
cold so I did 4 yesterday with them and 4 today. The last 4 are Mark&#39;s <br/>
:-) We played soccer in the laundry, cracked ourselves silly with <br/>
static electricity and balloons and ThingOne actually asked, no <br/>
--BEGGED!-- to be taught how to fold towels and bed linens.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just not going to happen if I made them do it. And anyway, I have <br/>
a problem making a 5 year old do things; especially if they are chores <br/>
that I HATE DOING. Let&#39;s not even get into the ethics of that, <br/>
karmically, it&#39;s just bleah!<br/>
