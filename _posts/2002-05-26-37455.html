&lt;&lt;  Sandra may always be RIGHT, as you said, but Sandra is also downright <br/>
RUDE in her comments sometimes.  Nomatter how RIGHT someone is, that is hard <br/>
to digest.  Especially when it seems the moderator supports and encourages <br/>
her.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
    <br/>
I tried to stay out of this, but I just can&#39;t let that one slide.<br/>
Just because SOME people take certain posts as rude, does not make them so. <br/>
How a person percieves things has a lot to do with whether or not you feel <br/>
it&#39;s rude or just plain truthful and blunt.<br/>
I prefer truthful, clear and blunt because it saves time.  You know where the <br/>
person is coming from and exactly what they think. It&#39;s much more economical <br/>
use of my time than beating around the bush to try and make EVERYONE feel <br/>
good (which is not possible imo).<br/>
I think the very fact that a person is RIGHT all the time is what pisses <br/>
people off.<br/>
It&#39;s tough to have your narrow views picked apart only to find out that the <br/>
person questioning you is quite possibly right once again!!!<br/>
That&#39;s what ruffled my feathers about Sandra when I first got online, I don&#39;t <br/>
like being wrong so often.<br/>
That&#39;s why the &quot;damn she&#39;s good&quot; really hit me between the eyes and made me <br/>
laugh.  I&#39;ve felt the same way before.<br/>
Pulling up old posts can simply prove correctness or show innaccuracies.  I <br/>
guess if the same person is right a LOT, it&#39;s just going to bug people. <br/>
Bummer.  There&#39;s so much to be learned from a person that is very accurate <br/>
and RIGHT.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Everyone is not right all of the time! We would like to believe that we <br/>
possess the powers to be ever so righteous, but we aren&#39;t. Being right all of <br/>
the time means that we have arrived at some level of perfection, that none of <br/>
us are.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you that sometimes people can have narrow minds. Yet, their <br/>
pattern of thought belongs strictly to them. It does not allow someone else <br/>
to try to reconfigure there thought process to prove that they are right <br/>
about a particular situation.<br/>
<br/>
Life is full of ups and downs, life is full of opinions...some or most of <br/>
them stink. Especially when they don&#39;t line up with our own personal beliefs. <br/>
I said earlier in a post, that we are all different. We should all be happy <br/>
with ourselves, not try to change anyone else, don&#39;t try to drive the point <br/>
home by being rude to someone else or by knocking down someone elses ideas. <br/>
&quot;I believe&quot; that we should all except who and what we are and LEARN that we <br/>
are all different. We all play a little bitty part in this big ol&#39; world yet <br/>
we all fit together when the puzzle is complete. <br/>
<br/>
What are we teaching our children if we believe that we ARE ALWAYS RIGHT !  I <br/>
am sorry, It is hard to hold a conversation with someone who always tries to <br/>
prove that you are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know any of you on this board, but I know that y0u are all beautiful <br/>
people and you all have different ideals about given situations.  Why can I <br/>
say that you are all beautiful people? I tell my children all of the time, <br/>
people come in all different shapes and colors and most of the time they come <br/>
with hidden packages that can make YOU blow up... their opinions!<br/>
<br/>
 CAN&#39;T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG!!<br/>

was that when she&#39;s gone back to check the accuracy of statements, she&#39;s been <br/>
surprized - repeatedly - to find that, indeed, Sandra is dead on.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has never claimed to be always right. And I&#39;ve seen her apologize <br/>
openly for making a mistake. Some people just don&#39;t like Sandra&#39;s style - but <br/>
some of us appreciate it hugely.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I understand the accuracy part. I was referring to another post and was <br/>
trying to come across with my own idea of my personal experiences of having <br/>
to deal with people who thought they were always right. In no way was I <br/>
trying to post in regards to Sandra being &quot;always right&quot; Sheesh...I don&#39;t <br/>
even know the lady. But as far as accuracy goes, if you are right, then you a<br/>
re right and there is no doubting it. The proof is in the pudding, right?!<br/>
<br/>
EXPRESSION IS WONDERFUL! <br/>
<br/>
This is why I don&#39;t like copying and replying to a text. I would just rather <br/>
post. I don&#39;t want to be pin-pointed as the person who is starting &quot;crap&quot; I <br/>
just want to be a part of the discussion here. I was merely copying and <br/>
posting at the moderators request. Hey, I am not a member of too many message <br/>
boards, and those that I am a member of I just go right on in and post. If <br/>
someone doesn&#39;t understand they reply with that response and offer  me the <br/>
opportunity to explain myself. <br/>
<br/>
Posting can get a bit tricky. PLEASE DON&#39;T BE OFFENDED BY MY <br/>
POSTING...EXPRESSION IS WONDERFUL :)<br/>
