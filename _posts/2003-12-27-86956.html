<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434667315">I am trying to get a new swapping group (for kids and mamas) going and <br/>
thought I would share it with all of you.  I am excited and so are my kids so I am <br/>
hoping we can hurry up and get some people to join.  This is not spam, I am a <br/>
member of your group just trying to do something fun for us and the kiddos.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654946158">Items such as journals, stationary, state t shirts, games, puzzles, <br/>
windchimes, posters...we can set up just about any swap.  I have a <br/>
place in the database for people to list items they would like to see <br/>
as swaps.  I also have a pen pal list for kids, secret sister, <br/>
birthday swap.  I belong to another group like this and it is so much <br/>
fun.  <br/>
