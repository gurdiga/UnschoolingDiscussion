<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140511364">&lt;&lt;Julie--with 4 dogs, 6 goats, 30 chickens, 10 rabbits, 1 cat and 1<br/>
newborn<br/>
rat&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Julie, how did you come by the newborn rat?  We have three right now and<br/>
are planning on getting 4 more, two boy and two girls so we can have a<br/>
litter of pups (once we are sure we have good home for them first).<br/>
<br/>
Have you had rats before?  I highly recommend getting your rat a same sex<br/>
friend, they are very social and being alone is hard for them.  We are<br/>
crazy-in-love with ratties in this house!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where do you live? We have two male rats who really need a new home - we<br/>
got a female as a companion for our first rat and she turned out to be<br/>
about 3 days pregnant. We put her daughter in our lovely 3 level cage<br/>
with her mom and Mary (rat #1) but the two boys are sharing a cage that&#39;s<br/>
really too small for them, and 5 rats is really too much for us. We<br/>
thought they had a new home when they were younger but the person sort of<br/>
flaked.<br/>
<br/>
They are very nice...one is a hooded rat named Robin Hood, and the other<br/>
has buff-colored fur with a barely visible white mark on his forehead and<br/>
red eyes. His name is Tortoise, because he&#39;s always been slower and less<br/>
daring than his brother.<br/>
<br/>
Nana, BTW, loves watching the rats. She was jumping on the coffee table<br/>
during the night and then putting her paws up on the cage, but we were<br/>
worried that the whole thing would fall over so we put the keyboard on<br/>
the coffee table last night and left it on (on the Dog Pianist setting,<br/>
of course) and in the middle of the night we heard music and then running<br/>
feet... so I think it worked.<br/>

Mary, I&#39;ve had a snake and fed it mice too, which is why I no longer have<br/>
a snake.  Our little girls are the best pets ever will never see the<br/>
inside of a reptile.<br/>
<br/>
A word of warning though, saying something like that to an avid fancy rat<br/>
breeder or keeper might be &quot;fightin words&quot;.  The condition of getting a<br/>
rat from a good breeder is that they or their offspring will never be<br/>
&quot;feeders&quot;.  I don&#39;t think most snake owners would want to pay $20 to $30<br/>
for a feeder anyway.<br/>

<br/>
Hi Dar<br/>
<br/>
We are all the way in Lake Oswego, OR, about 15 min south of Portland.  I<br/>
wish we were close enough, we would probably take in every rat in need of<br/>
a home if it was in our power.  We are limited in space too and part of<br/>
the deal in getting the rats to breed is that we have enough large cages<br/>
for all of them.<br/>
<br/>
We just scored a very nice ferret cage from PetSmart, it was marked half<br/>
off because of some minor dents and it even included a hammock!  Now we<br/>
need to buy or build one about the same size for our intended boys.<br/>
<br/>
Average rat litters are about 12 so we have to line up enough homes for<br/>
most of them, we will be keeping 4 ourselves.  Lanora is very committed<br/>
to this endeavor and has been researching rat care, homemade cages and<br/>
breeding.  She has even begun a recycling business to generate money for<br/>
vet costs.  I&#39;m impressed by her dedication.<br/>
<br/>

Oops, sorry, I was just trying to make a joke. I would never buy a &quot;pet&quot; to <br/>
become a feeder. And no I wouldn&#39;t pay even 10 dollars for snake food. In <br/>
fact, 2 weeks ago, there was a rat by our garbage cans and my husband was <br/>
yelling for me to get him something so he could cathc free food for Rocky. <br/>
(the snake) Now what am I suppose to get to catch a wild rat that is running <br/>
along our fence???<br/>

I knew you were joking.  I&#39;ve been researching rat breeders lately and<br/>
have noted how serious they are about some subjects, snakes being one of<br/>
them.  LOL  I love snakes and would like to have one that doesn&#39;t eat<br/>
rodents, just a hard thing for me to watch.<br/>
<br/>
There is a site where you can order feeder mice and rats that are already<br/>
dead and they will ship them.  The snake fanciers I know say it&#39;s<br/>
dangerous to feed them live rodents because they get injured by bites and<br/>
clawing.<br/>
<br/>
What I really want is just a dog, no particular breed, just a dog. <br/>
Finances don&#39;t permit that just now but someday soon.<br/>

There is an excellent book on rat care written by &quot;The Rat Lady&quot;, I will<br/>
have to check on the title and her actual name (Lanora is asleep and I<br/>
don&#39;t know where the book is).<br/>
<br/>
However, if you are patient you can get most, if not all, of the same<br/>
information from web sites.  Rat breeders usually have web sites and will<br/>
share any information they have.<br/>
<br/>
Did your ratty bite when he was being held or just when a finger was<br/>
stuck in the cage?  Usually they will learn to bite at fingers stuck in<br/>
the cage if treats are offered to them this way.  This is why it&#39;s best<br/>
to never stick food through the cage bars, always open the door and offer<br/>
it that way.  That way they know that a finger through the bars if for<br/>
petting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, was it real biting or just testing?  Our girls will &quot;test&quot; our<br/>
fingers but NEVER actually bite down.  I can feel their teeth but it&#39;s a<br/>
very gentle pressure, I think they figure out it&#39;s skin, not food and<br/>
don&#39;t bite.  Jonathan freaked out the first couple of times they did this<br/>
and pulled his finger away too fast, this caused a tiny scrape.  Now he<br/>
knows they aren&#39;t going to bite and doesn&#39;t pull away, he thinks it&#39;s<br/>
hysterical to feel their little teeth on his skin.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I just thought of two web sites off the top of my head:<br/>
<br/>
www. fuzzbutts.com<br/>
<br/>
www.cheesyacres.com<br/>
<br/>
You can also go to google and enter: fancy rat breeders<br/>

I have encountered two people who were allergic to rats but other than<br/>
that I don&#39;t know of any.  Do as much research as you can on rat<br/>
healthcare because usually the ones with health concerns are the rats.<br/>
<br/>
If you get your rats from a good breeder rather than the pet shop you&#39;ll<br/>
have better chances of getting healthier and friendlier rats.<br/>
