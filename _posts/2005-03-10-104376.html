<div id="ygrps-yiv-564431166">-=-=-=- My dd was in the show &quot;Oliver&quot;, so we all watched the movie one night together and my two youngest ended up crying.  I think I showed a little lack of judgement, but I hadn&#39;t really thought about the abuse/neglect/nasty parenting factor till after these experiences. -=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the songs I sing to Duncan (well, *used* to sing!) is &quot;Where is Love&quot; from Oliver! One day when he was four-or-five he asked where I learned it and what it meant. After I told him, he cried and asked that I not sing that one any more. It made him very sad to know this little boy was looking for his mom, who was dead.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s seen the movie and the stage production. He perked up when he heard &#39;his song&#39;. &lt;g&gt; I can now sing it to him, but only when he asks. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
