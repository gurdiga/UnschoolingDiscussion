<br/>
That was in a side conversation about my etymology page, whic now has  <br/>
the days of the week in Catalan (thanks, Liz)...<br/>
And I thought it might be useful here.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian and I were talking about there being some problems  <br/>
because of the language itself.  Teacher and teaching and learning  <br/>
and the problems with sorting all that have to do with English, not  <br/>
with how cognition really works.  On the other hand, cognition works  <br/>
with language in very many ways and cases, and so if someone has come  <br/>
to believe something, it can take a lot of words and some conscious  <br/>
desire and effort to build a new internal model.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So, if in Spanish you say:<br/>
<br/>
once, doce, trece, catorce, quince, dieciseis, diecisiete, dieciocho,<br/>
diecinueve<br/>
<br/>
basically:<br/>
<br/>
eleven, twelve, threlve, forelve, fifelve, sixteen, seventeen, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are no &quot;teenagers&quot; until sixteen!<br/>
<br/>
In Catalan and French it goes:<br/>
<br/>
onze, dotze, tretze, catorze, quinze, setze, disset, divuit, dinou<br/>
onze, douze, treize, quatorze, quinze, seize, dix-sept, dix-huit, dix-neuf<br/>
<br/>
which means there are no teenagers until seventeen!<br/>
<br/>
At least in Barcelona, they don&#39;t have a word for teenager, except for<br/>
&quot;adolescent&quot; which is not so age based.<br/>
<br/>
I think I like thinking about this because my mother always said that<br/>
&quot;teenagers do this&quot; and &quot;teenagers do that&quot; and when I got to be a<br/>
teenager (that magic day when I turned 13, since I was an English<br/>
speaker), I refused to do the things my mother said I would do. (Well,<br/>
most of them &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember reading a self-help book about ten years ago (when I was<br/>
more into self-help books) and it recommended &quot;Would you do xyz?&quot; over<br/>
&quot;Could you do xyz?&quot; since the &quot;could&quot; implied a doubt about the<br/>
person&#39;s ability and might be offensive. But I lived in Barcelona at<br/>
the time and the first thing I thought of was that both could and<br/>
would are said the same way in Catalan (and in Spanish and French for<br/>
that matter). So, was the problem of getting your needs met just one<br/>
that affected English speakers? Or was the solution one that would<br/>
only help English speakers? (Or was it all just a bogus theory?)<br/>
<br/>
I think words are really important, but I also think that the ideas<br/>
behind them can get lost if we only focus on the words. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be curious to hear more about the teach/teacher question. Teacher<br/>
in most Romance languages is &quot;master&quot;...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And then &quot;Can you&quot; has other meanings, and 200 years ago, if someone  <br/>
said &quot;You shall&quot; it was a VERY strong statement which could only be   <br/>
made by someone who had authority to really tell you what to do.  Now  <br/>
people don&#39;t even use it of themselves, though they were still  <br/>
teaching us to use it, 40 years ago.  It&#39;s too strong a statement for  <br/>
most people to want to make.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In English we only have one being, and French has two; the temporary  <br/>
state, and the permanent beingness are two different verbs.  That&#39;s  <br/>
probably part of what has caused us confusion in discussions about  <br/>
labelling children or whether one *IS* an unschooler or not.  If we  <br/>
had more than one level of isness, that would help.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard stories of multi-lingual societies changing languages for  <br/>
various purposes.  Spanish is good for mushy moments and bedrooms,  <br/>
I&#39;ve heard.  I wonder if another language than English might be best  <br/>
for discussing learning.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s some of the business of teaching/learning.<br/>
In the &quot;maestra&quot; languages, just because someone is the master of a  <br/>
subject doesn&#39;t mean that in itself causes learning in anyone else.   <br/>
In English people are baffled, and blame people for being bad and  <br/>
wrong and defective, when the presence of a teacher produces no  <br/>
&quot;teaching,&quot; because &quot;teach&quot; seems to imply there is a substance which  <br/>
can be transferred from one person to another.<br/>
