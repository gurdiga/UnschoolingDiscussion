<div id="ygrps-yiv-322000002">My 4 yo fashions guns and goes on shooting fantasies.  I&#39;ve told him they<br/>
made me uncomfortable but if he wanted to play w/ them he could.  ( How do<br/>
they know how to get all these noises, cars included down so well??)  The<br/>
one thing I don&#39;t like is for him to point the gun at my face.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
tell him I have had that happen as yet but I need to separate my stuff from<br/>
his play.  that would be a burden at this place.    My fear resonating from<br/>
a past experience is not going to help him along w/ his play.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, once when he was pointing at my face and I asked him not to, he<br/>
responded, But I&#39;m shooting love&quot;.  He knows how to get his mom. .<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This whole thread is amazing to me right now--pretty uncanny.  I&#39;m <br/>
dealing with the same subject on my local state unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
I just got done writing a post trying to explain the same thing as <br/>
above.   How, if we can get over our own fears and experiences its <br/>
so much more beneficial for our kids.  If we can get into our kids <br/>
skins and see the world through their eyes; we can see the <br/>
wonderfulness all around us.  Not just the violence.  Which is what <br/>
some people see when kids want to do certain things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve been trying to explain how to see their children&#39;s play as <br/>
that, play.  If you stop one line of interest you are really <br/>
putting up a road block in the your kids&#39; learning.  And I&#39;m pretty <br/>
sure its probably happening in other places of their lives too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also trying to explain that we really aren&#39;t respecting a <br/>
child&#39;s POV if we only see our our own.  <br/>
<br/>
When the discussion started, I began reflecting back. When and how <br/>
did my perspective change?  I used to be really uncomfortable with <br/>
those things too, all violent play.  Now I&#39;m not? Hmm,  How can I <br/>
get my point across? What can I say to get them to stop being so <br/>
fearful?<br/>
<br/>
And I guess I decided that it was when some of the moms here said to <br/>
sit down with your kids.  Do stuff with your kids and see what they <br/>
are doing.  Why are they enjoying what they are doing?   I think I <br/>
then was able to see past my own fears and prejudices.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
even want my son playing Dragonball Z video games because they were <br/>
fighting.  I couldn&#39;t see the fact that it was total strategy. Which <br/>
combination will beat the other combinations,  and the situations <br/>
are always changing. <br/>
<br/>
Its a real shift in perspective-- from our own to theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have any suggestions on this?  How did you make a <br/>
shift?  What else could I say to help bring this home?<br/>

I probably don&#39;t have the best piece to your puzzle, but you&#39;ll find it.  And <br/>
if you write something up, would you consider letting me put it on my <br/>
website?  &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
Whatever that element is, it&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get at with people when I <br/>
ask them what their priorities are.<br/>
<br/>
If the children aren&#39;t one of their top three, unschooling won&#39;t be easy.  <br/>
Some people&#39;s houses (resale value, show-place status) are in their top three.  <br/>
Some people are so religious that it&#39;s not within their options to give their <br/>
kids too much freedom.  And when those things are true that&#39;s fine, but the <br/>
parents should really think about the question &quot;What are your priorities?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If their children&#39;s &quot;successful futures&quot; outweigh happy childhoods, that&#39;s <br/>
important for them to know.<br/>
<br/>
If their children&#39;s eternal souls are more important than their current <br/>
happiness, then unschooling won&#39;t be easy.  Too much of it might seem like sloth <br/>
and pride and not honoring parents.<br/>
<br/>
If parental privacy and personal &quot;time with spouse&quot; and all that is such a <br/>
priority that they want vacations without their kids, and they want their kids <br/>
to be with nannies and all that, it could still work, but the limitations to <br/>
the relationships by maintaining that us vs. them separation will be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Problem&quot; has to do with what the parents wanted to achieve.  If they want a <br/>
kid-free vacation each year and a house that could be photographed by Sunset, <br/>
House Beautiful or whatever regional equivalent, and they have white couches <br/>
and white carpet,  unschooling could be an insurmountable thing they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even beging to consider.<br/>
<br/>
Priorities. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my suggestion for the direction to look for that missing piece.<br/>

<br/>
You could&#39;ve just said &quot;hugs are warmer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like guns being pointed at me, not even toy guns, if I&#39;m trying to <br/>
mind my own business.  If I&#39;m playing, that&#39;s different.  I used to say &quot;Go <br/>
shoot targets,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not playing.&quot;  I told them some people really don&#39;t like <br/>
toy guns, so they need to keep the guns among people who are wanting to play.<br/>

Sure,  don&#39;t know if it will happen in the near future,(we&#39;re <br/>

Thanks Sandra,  I hadn&#39;t thought of that!<br/>
<br/>
I think that may have come up in one other discussion I was in, a <br/>
few months ago,  same list but different poster.   I totally forgot <br/>
about it this time.  I need to make some notes or keep some posts.  <br/>
Ahhhh, organizational skills, &lt;g&gt;  not my stong point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007177364">I was approached by a reporter after he saw my family at two different <br/>
rallys on two consecutive days.  He assumed I was a peacenik and asked about <br/>
doing a story on a family who doesn&#39;t let the kids play with guns.  I did a <br/>
quick mental inventory and decided that we really *didn&#39;t* have any guns.  <br/>
News day came and Hayden&#39;s picked out toys to showcase: the FP Star Wars set <br/>
(with heavily armed droids and Obi Wan has *The Force*), squirt*guns* (why <br/>
did I never think of them that way before this day), and this really cool <br/>
lego gun he spent the morning making!!!  EEK!<br/>
<br/>
I was not quite what the reporter was looking for, and I&#39;m glad for it.<br/>
He did think it was cool to see Queensryche and Elton in the same cd library <br/>
;)<br/>
