<div id="ygrps-yiv-551398930">Thanks to everyone that posted to my question and guidance on my in <br/>
law. I&#39;ve discussed the posts with my husband and we&#39;ve decided that <br/>
unschooling is not for this particular child (there are 5 of them in <br/>
the house; 2 of which are my own). I believe that the unschooling is <br/>
definitely working with my 6 year old. She&#39;s in to everything and I <br/>
simply assist her where she needs assistance. She wanted to play <br/>
piano - lessons it is. She wanted to <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not going to supply everything fun for him because of the <br/>
history of running away, slashing teaher&#39;s tires, and stealing - and <br/>
2005 hasn&#39;t gotten underway yet. I compared him to a 3rd grade level <br/>
because that&#39;s how I relate to it. I definitely don&#39;t like the way <br/>
the school system is set up. I would like for him to follow in my <br/>
child&#39;s footsteps, however, they have 2 different paths from which <br/>
they come. <br/>
<br/>
James (is his name, by the way) cannot move on to the fun things <br/>
because he can&#39;t read/comprehend the fun things. He did not get the <br/>
basics from school and we are having to do those things now. We <br/>
don&#39;t care about the grade level issue because that would be crazy <br/>
trying to make up 4 or 5 years in 1 year or a summer. We have to <br/>
find a way to make him see that its not just memorization; learning <br/>
will start to click (hell, it happens all the time), however, he has <br/>
to take some steps toward more positive living and learning.<br/>
<br/>
I posted because I wanted to get a variety of ways that we/he could <br/>
approach learning.  I do appreciate the posts because I found a new <br/>
spirit within them to keep it happy and not all stuffy overall. <br/>
That&#39;s definitely important. <br/>

Gotta help him to find a niche,<br/>

 <br/>
Has he run away from a home wher people were willing to let him have  some <br/>
things that were fun?<br/>

As he has slashed teachers&#39; tires, I&#39;m even more surprised that you  want to <br/>
refer to him as &quot;a student.&quot;  That makes you the teacher.<br/>

School has harmed him.  The more you drop of it, the less harm you  continue <br/>
to do yourself, in school&#39;s stead.<br/>

 <br/>
&quot;Follow&quot; in your very young child&#39;s footsteps?  Yikes.<br/>
If you figure out how to appreciate the good parts of him, that will be  way <br/>
better.  Don&#39;t define him as less than your child, or on a wrong path  or <br/>
worse path.  <br/>
It won&#39;t help him, or you, or your child, or your family for you to do  that.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-James (is his name, by the way) cannot move on to the fun things  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
That is flawed reasoning.  Look:  <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd_">http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd)">http://sandradodd.com/r/hollydodd)</a>  <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/holly)">http://sandradodd.com/r/holly)</a> <br/>
When Holly couldn&#39;t read, she was WAY better at some things than the others  <br/>
around her, because she couldn&#39;t read.  It surprised me, but it was  true.  <br/>
She wasn&#39;t a really little kid, either.<br/>
 <br/>
In case you&#39;re not following the links people are providing, here&#39;s what  <br/>
that says:<br/>
 <br/>
  <br/>
Advantages Discovered from Later Reading<br/>
[Holly Dodd read  late, and though it was frustrating a time or two, she read <br/>
when she read.  Before then, there were instances when it showed an <br/>
advantageous side.]   <br/>
____________________________________<br/>
 <br/>
When Holly was nine she was in a play, and she wasn&#39;t reading yet. She was  <br/>
afraid she would not know her lines, so every day she got me to read through <br/>
her  scene, and she paid careful attention at rehearsals, and rehearsed with <br/>
another  family&#39;s kids. As it turned out, her inability to read along during <br/>
rehearsals  ended up being a boon. The following was posted on  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com">unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a> in April 2003:  <br/>
&lt;&lt; If the homeschooler&#39;s theater has its performance set for May 10,  and <br/>
first rehearsal is April 1, an unschooler can see that it would be best to  know <br/>
their lines by then. &gt;&gt;  <br/>
Oh right! That&#39;s an example I forgot to give. Holly was in a play, put on by  <br/>
the city&#39;s theatre, but an all-homeschoolers&#39; session with daytime <br/>
rehearsals.  <br/>
Holly learned all her lines early, since she couldn&#39;t read and needed help.  <br/>
As rehearsals went on, she learned everyone else&#39;s lines too. Since they were  <br/>
leaning on being able to read from scripts during rehearsals, they weren&#39;t  <br/>
memorizing their lines.  <br/>
When the performance came two of the three main characters were Holly and her <br/>
 best friend, who knew their lines. The third didn&#39;t know his. A couple of <br/>
times  when it didn&#39;t matter, one of them said his line, and left the response <br/>
to him.  If he didn&#39;t catch it, the other of the girls would say the response. <br/>
(Most of  what they were doing was exposition or dialog that wasn&#39;t at all <br/>
character  specific.) If it made him mad, he didn&#39;t dare say so, because he <br/>
didn&#39;t know his  part.  <br/>
But Holly was so disgusted with the others, she had no interest in the next  <br/>
play they offered.  <br/>
That&#39;s too bad. Somehow she met deadlines TOO well?  <br/>

You don&#39;t have to.  You&#39;re choosing to.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to.  Kirby never had &quot;the basics&quot; from school or  anywhere <br/>
else, but he figured out a lot of stuff on his own.  He didn&#39;t  figure out <br/>
notation, but it doesn&#39;t take long.  <br/>
 <br/>
Less than an hour ago he came home with his final math class  results.  He&#39;s <br/>
18 and took his first ever math class.  His test  score was 96, highest in the <br/>
class.  His final score was third in the  class (over 20 in the class, all <br/>
others had been to school and &quot;had the  basics&quot;).  It&#39;s a CR/NC class.  It <br/>
would&#39;ve been an A, but it&#39;s CR,  just as the others.<br/>
 <br/>
You don&#39;t have to &quot;do those things now&quot; that you&#39;re doing with your  brother <br/>
in law.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Yes, it would.  But you do care about the grade level issue because  you <br/>
wrote it down and sent it to strangers.  You think of him as a third  grader (or <br/>
whichever grade you thought about, and chose to write down).   You defined him <br/>
as an X-grader.  Now we know his name is James, but that  is entirely <br/>
secondary in the way you presented him.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- We have to <br/>

 <br/>
Maybe if you leave it alone a while, he will figure out that it&#39;s not  just <br/>
memorization.  My kids all did.<br/>
 <br/>
More teaching is not the cure for damage-from-teaching.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I do appreciate the posts because I found a new <br/>

That&#39;s definitely  important.=-<br/>
 <br/>
Happier school at home is still school, still teaching.<br/>
 <br/>
Schools try all the time to make the experience &quot;happier&quot; for kids, not  so <br/>
stuffy.  They paint grey walls blue.  They get textbooks with  more colorful <br/>
colors.  They get a prettier clock. Teachers are told  that humor helps, and so <br/>
they come in, make a joke, and then present the same  dull lesson.  Cosmetic <br/>
token changes don&#39;t make the big difference.   Less stuffy is still stuffy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This really stands out to me.  Just because someone is interested in <br/>
something doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they want and/or &quot;need&quot; lessons <br/>
on it.  My 8.5 yo has been interested in the piano for a couple of years <br/>
now.  We got her a keyboard, we take her around full sized pianos and <br/>
let her play until she is tired of it (or we have to leave that place), <br/>
we started showing her sheet music, etc.  We offered lessons so that she <br/>
knew that they existed, but she isn&#39;t interested and she plays quite <br/>
well by ear.  She doesn&#39;t even need sheet music.<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of when I wanted to learn more about Feng Shui.  I had read <br/>
about 30 books on the subject and countless websites.  I saw that a <br/>
class was being offered locally and I signed up.  What a waste of money. <br/>
  I knew more than the instructor.<br/>
<br/>
Kids need to know that their parents/guardians have faith and trust in <br/>
them, not that we&#39;ll sign them up for lessons at their first spark of <br/>
interest in something.<br/>

<br/>
I hope you will stick around this list and read, read, read.  What you said above gives me the impression that you don&#39;t really understand what unschooling means.<br/>
<br/>
Although you will hear stories of unschooled children who decided to learn a particular thing (algebra or a foreign language, maybe) and asked for the curriculum materials and sat down and studied it until it was finished, those stories are NOT what unschooling is all about.  It is NOT about waiting for the child to &quot;get motivated&quot; to do school work.<br/>
<br/>
It is about appreciating what the child IS interested in and helping him find a variety of ways to follow that interest.  It is more than that, as well, but that is a good place to start.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;James (is his name, by the way) cannot move on to the fun things <br/>

<br/>
I can think of plenty of fun things that do not require reading.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 9 year old dd, Jackie, who is not yet an independent reader.  She has fun all the time.  In fact, she sometimes makes herself laugh by pretending to laugh, then it turns into a real laugh and we can&#39;t help but join in.  It makes me feel good inside just thinking about her doing that and the day she told me that she does it on purpose because she likes to make us laugh.  She listens to music, dances, draws, paints, sculpts, plays on the computer, computes arithmetic problems in her head, counts her money, dreams about ways to spend her money, listens to audio books, asks me or her dad to read to her, watches movies, has many friends, and much much more.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean that you will not ALLOW him to do fun things until he accomplishes some task that YOU have set for him, well, that just plain sounds mean to me and I hope you can come to understand that unschooling will not happen in that atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You just wrote that learning happens all the time.  Why would he need to take a step toward it?  Why will it &quot;start&quot; to click?  It already is clicking for him.  He just needs someone who will accept that what he learns is worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
YOU have to take some steps toward being positive towards him, being loving, letting him be who he is - not who you think he should be.<br/>

Hi, Latoya --<br/>

I just wanted to mention that I have found that kids will try harder to read things that they think are fun.<br/>

interested in piano and that is deemed &quot;acceptable&quot; by you.  <br/>
However, James is into rap and drums and that is not &quot;acceptable&quot; to <br/>
you.  Why should you be the one that decides his interests are not <br/>
worthwhile.  My MIL sees my dd as &quot;loving to learn&quot; only because she <br/>
is interested in &quot;schoolish&quot; looking things, reading, writing, <br/>
drawing, etc.  My ds loves to learn too!  He loves video games, <br/>
magic tricks, Legos, and Star Wars.  It just isn&#39;t &quot;acceptable&quot; to <br/>
learn from those things.  Why should an individual&#39;s development not <br/>
be enjoyable?  I haven&#39;t figured that one out yet!  Not only that, <br/>
but does it really mean you are educated if you learn &quot;the basics&quot; <br/>
but can&#39;t apply them?  Maybe you are truly educated if you learn a <br/>
set of facts and dates for a test and then proceed to forget them a <br/>
day later.<br/>
