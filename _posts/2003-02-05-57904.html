<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056144416">We are going back to babies after 13 years so equipment has changed <br/>
alot since then plus the fact that we were in England & now we are <br/>
here in the US. Does anyone know if they manufacture an umbrella <br/>
stroller over here that has two adjsutable knobs on the side that <br/>
allows the whole seat part to be inclined at whatever angle you <br/>
choose? I had a double one of these when my first two were little & <br/>
it was awesome as you could lay them flat or any degree of <br/>
uprightness you wanted. <br/>
We recently purchased a Jogger, via the internet, thinking that we <br/>
had done our research pretty thoroughly. This jogger, which is really <br/>
nice, was supposed to be fully reclinable. We thought &quot;Fully <br/>
reclinable&quot; meant just that, but obviously not as this thing only <br/>
reclines so far & is absolutely unsuitable for a newborn. I really <br/>
don&#39;t want to spend a huge amount of money on another stroller as the <br/>
jogger will be great once he is 2-3mths old. Can&#39;t use a sling or <br/>
Snugli for a long period of time due to back problems & because we <br/>
live out in the &quot;boonies&quot; of WV probably won&#39;t use it a great deal. <br/>
Just want something that we can take to the park or mall etc.<br/>
Any ideas or suggestions would be welcome.<br/>
Thanks <br/>
Liz</div>
