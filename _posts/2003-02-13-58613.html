<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041544321">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am a lurker here most of the time...<br/>
But I&#39;ve got to say, I so resonate with you all that it cracks me up!!!<br/>
For every one of us on this list that posts a message I bet there are<br/>
dozens more who hang out at home, like me, reading the posts and laughing<br/>
or crying or yelling out &quot;Right On, Girl!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe the wonderful things that you are all doing for your<br/>
families in your own little place in the world. Sometimes I think I&#39;m the<br/>
only one out here doing what needs to be done against great odds. Thank<br/>
you for your inspiration.<br/>
And I can&#39;t believe some of the incredibly closed minded society we live<br/>
in that only sees life as their blinders permit. Who the heck heard of<br/>
weaning on any set day???? Preposterous!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo...just had ta speak up!!<br/>
Have a great day and I look forward to more of Unschooling-dotcomedy!!<br/>
<br/>

Unschooling (on nights, weekends, holidays, vacations) divorced mom to<br/>
two public schooled boys, David 11 and Matthew 7, because their closed<br/>
minded dad got a fancy lawyer (instead of paying his child support) and<br/>
took me to court and forced our &quot;attention challenged&quot; (read: normal)<br/>
boys back into public school...and this fight is not over (I&#39;m regrouping<br/>
to take a different approach...send me your good energies).<br/>

Are the boys living with you, though?<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen this bit (written about the adventures of my sister &lt;g&gt;):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>

and her oldest of three stayed out of school after third grade (Gina, who&#39;s <br/>
18 now), and has a website which is linked from here (by the <br/>
Sonic/anime-looking art)<br/>

<br/>
Her two boys went back to school to play basketball.  The middle kid, 16,  <br/>
has dropped out.  The younger, 15, is still going, but hardly does any scho<br/>
olwork.  He uses school for socialization.<br/>

<br/>
And now, I&#39;m back atcha:<br/>
Yes, my kids live with me and have visitation with their dad several<br/>
afternoons a week.<br/>
They totally want to be homeschooled and I will continue to fight the<br/>
good fight for them.<br/>
They are currently in the process of a psycho-educational eval for<br/>
learning disabilities. It is court ordered.<br/>
I hope that whatever they find out I can use it to show that they will do<br/>
better with one-on-one attention, like I know they need.<br/>
I&#39;ll be entering mediation with their father soon to discuss the child<br/>
support and education issues.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check out your sister&#39;s story next time I get a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Christy<br/>
