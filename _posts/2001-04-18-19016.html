Why?  And no, this is not an abortion question; it&#39;s a question about Down Syndrome.  What is so bad about people with Downs?  I used to work with several children and young people in aquatic therapy and they were all wonderful.  The functioned quite well and were very sociable.  Why would this condition be the reason for abortion?  Am I missing something?  They are not horribly disfigured; they won&#39;t suffer and die in agony; and although they may not aspire to be brain surgeons, a lot do have jobs and do care for their personal needs.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670802393">Kandi: I agree with you. I would never abort a Downs Syndrome baby. <br/>
They can lead good lives, just not what we consider &quot;normal.&quot; The only <br/>
thing that would concern me, maybe, is that who would care for them <br/>
after I pass away? I would love and accept a Downs baby, just like my <br/>
other children, but I know I would be concerned about what would <br/>
happen to him/her after I&#39;m gone.  <br/>

[probably because we planned a late in life baby and to my way of thinking it 
would have&nbsp;been &quot;my fault&quot;if she had problems] has some of the magical 
qualities of DS people, she is very loving and generally sees the good in people

parents were from India, Dad a MD and Mom some kind of scientist, they rejected 
him at birth even though he didn&#39;t have a lot of the medical problems associated 
with DS.&nbsp;&nbsp; In England they would have had the right to starve him to 
death, which is what they would have preferred, but in Australia they didn&#39;t so 
he was given up for adoption.&nbsp; Mark is an unusual DS person in that he has 
an IQ of around 120, and goes to &quot;normal&quot; school and is toward the top of the 
class in most subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp; His adopted Mother spent many hours in 
activities to stimulate his brain development when he was a baby, that plus 
being from a &quot;brainy&quot; biological family made him what he is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

totally agree with you there. However, there are those who dream/wish for a

that they are NOT capable of raising a child with downs. Myself, I feel that if 
the Lord had given me a child with downs, then He would also equip me to learn 
from and with that child and pour out HIS love for/with/through that child. I 
love all kids...no matter what...always been that way. To me abortion has always 
been murder and I will always feel and think that way. Doesn&#39;t mean I impose my 
feelings or thoughts on others who do have abortions. I feel sorry for the child

<br>I agree with this.
<br>
<br>There, are, however other options, besides abortion (which I have my own 
<br>opinion on and won&#39;t go into....I never mix abortion and politics views with 
<br>friendship). I had a friend (pen pal) who had no testing done (she was in her 
<br>early 20&#39;s) while pregnant and her 3rd child was born with DS. Had she known 
<br>before he was born, she would have aborted. Since she didn&#39;t know she and her 
<br>husband opted to place their child up for adoption. It was a hard choice but 
<br>his adopted parents only &nbsp;adopt DS babies and they provide wonderful care for 
<br>them (lots of love and attention a well as medical care) and have extended 
<br>family and friends who will care for these children if their parents should 
<br>die/when they die.
