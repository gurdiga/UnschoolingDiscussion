<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880080585">I do not believe that college is essential to success in today&#39;s society, but this article wasn&#39;t what I expected.<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Professors have convinced society that this culture is essential for higher learning, and have thus been able to protect their own status and independence by cheating students, parents, taxpayers, and employers, and polluting the intellectual inheritance of society.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is more likely the people who have the degrees and certifications who are insisting that degrees and certifications are necessary, not the professors.<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So, they send their children into alien territory, at great expense, only to see their children indoctrinated with ideas that the parents had warned against.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Should the college experience not expose the student to new ideas?  <br/>

I clicked the link, saw the name, rolled my eyes, skimmed a little and x&#39;d it <br/>
off.  Same old same old from the Reconstructionist extreme right.  Don&#39;t even <br/>
know why it was posted here.<br/>
