<br/>
With two babies at home, the youngest still trying to learn that he really<br/>
can sleep through the night, I can&#39;t even go to the bathroom by myself.  I<br/>
answer my email in fits and starts as I referee the sometimes chaotic, and<br/>
often messy, circus around here.  With kids who are still in diapers, can&#39;t<br/>
feed or clothe themselves, and are still learning how to play alone<br/>
themselves my only hope for a few minutes to myself is when they are taking<br/>
their nap (like now.)  Thank goodness for that!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106595366">I really think this is funny...my kids are in their teens and I watch<br/>
my 2yr old grandson..hubby works 3rd trick so I&#39;m alone at night with a<br/>
house of teens that think my bedroom is a sitting room for them ,in the<br/>
a.m the grandson thinks he has to sleep with grand dad right next to<br/>
him...forget us talking then with him and 2 homeschooling and not<br/>
including boyfriends ,girlfriends, just friends......then another comes<br/>
home at 3 and grandson&#39;s dadda stops by to see little one before he<br/>
goes to work(3pm to 3 am shift)little ones &quot;momma&quot; picks him up at 5:30<br/>
except on Fri then its 7pm ...But it never fails ...Wed all the kids<br/>
are out of here by 5:30pm...we try to have that our date<br/>
night...&quot;momma&quot; always calls for something and usually within an hr of<br/>
leaving here...We decided that maybe we will get time alone when they<br/>
all move out and we move somewhere with no phone or maybe not even a<br/>
road<br/>
<br/>
