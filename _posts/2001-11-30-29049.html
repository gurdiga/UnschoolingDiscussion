I have this problem to a lesser degree. My ex (who<br/>
lives in the UK - so is not underfoot :-)) was totally<br/>
paranoid about the whole homeschooling thing (He&#39;s<br/>
even in denial of the term unschooling!). This year I<br/>
*enrolled* dd in a ps charter homeschool program for<br/>
financial reasons. I know that she will not be<br/>
enrolled next year because as she gets older it will<br/>
be too hard to unschool (she&#39;s enrolled in first grade<br/>
now and it&#39;s no prob). Ex was overjoyed at her being<br/>
in the ps system (&quot;so we&#39;ll know what she&#39;s supposed<br/>
to be doing&quot; - GAG! I&#39;ve tried to explain my<br/>
philosophies and recommended books (so he&#39;ll know I&#39;m<br/>
not the ONLY one who thinks like this), but he has yet<br/>
- in 3 years -to read a single book on the subject.<br/>
Both his parents were (now retired) in the private<br/>
education sector in the UK - very stiff upper lip<br/>
stuff. At the moment it&#39;s not too much of an issue<br/>
because dd loves to read and they seem to be measuring<br/>
how well she&#39;s doing on her reading skills (thank god<br/>
they haven&#39;t a clue about her math &#39;abilities&#39;). What<br/>
I&#39;m worried about is as she gets older and there&#39;s<br/>
more pressure put on her from that side of the family<br/>
(she goes to the UK 2x a year for a month at a time)<br/>
is how she&#39;s going to hold up under it. She has<br/>
confidence and self esteem issues as it is and I worry<br/>
about how being in that enviroment will affect her. If<br/>
anyone has any insight  or advice regarding my<br/>
situation I would love to hear it. TIA<br/>
<br/>
Meghan<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  She loves her dad and likes to go and see him,<br/>
it&#39;s just he parents SO differently than I do that<br/>
sometimes dd has a hard time of it. She&#39;s used to her<br/>
opinions being listened to and being respected as a<br/>
fully functioning human being and she doesn&#39;t get that there.<br/>
