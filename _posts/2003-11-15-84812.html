I certainly feel your pain.  If you were near by I&#39;d want to give you a hug, <br/>
but since I can&#39;t, mentally give yourself one.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve noticed, not just with unschoolers but with homeschoolers as <br/>
well, when we are new to this environment, quite a few of us find out about <br/>
boundaries that have never been set with our families.  This uncle should never <br/>
have the feeling that he can approach a subject like this with your children.  <br/>
I welcome any inquiries my family has, as long as they ask ME, in a respectful <br/>
way.  Casual questions they would ask my chidren anyway, like how&#39;s school <br/>
going, etc., I don&#39;t address because that is &quot;normal&quot; and respectful.  My <br/>
grandparents (my children&#39;s great-grandparents) started out from day one encouraging <br/>
me and my son in our homeschooling quest.  Unfortunately, my grandmother died <br/>
before I started unschooling, but their tone set the tone for the whole <br/>
family.  Maybe there is one person in the family this uncle respects that can give <br/>
you encouragement and support when he is around, and maybe you can set some <br/>
boundaries and let him know it is NOT alright to address such an issue with your <br/>
children.  That is a passive aggressive way of trying to undermine your <br/>
children&#39;s confidence in decisions you make regarding them, and really, in my <br/>
opinion, should not be tolerated.  I am constantly suprised at the gall family <br/>
members have in their approaching the subject of homeschooling and unschooling.  <br/>
While I understand the concept that was recently addressed, I think by Sandra, <br/>
about how these family members are scared because they don&#39;t know what to <br/>
expect, have you gone out and joined some cult, etc., the information is readily <br/>
available on the internet, the library, and whatever happened to lovingly <br/>
questioning with the pretense of supporting and encouraging your adult child in <br/>
whatever they want to pursue?  We aren&#39;t talking about radical religion or abuse. <br/>
 Syndi, you are doing what you as the parent have decided is the best choice <br/>
for your children.  You have said how wonderful you already feel.  Trust your <br/>
feelings.  The only times I&#39;ve made mistakes I&#39;ve regretted is when I did not <br/>
trust my own gut feelings about my children.  Only you in your heart know <br/>
whether this is the right decision for you and your children.  From what you&#39;ve <br/>
indicated, you are following your heart.  How blessed your children are!  Does <br/>
uncle have any children?  It makes me wonder what kind of parent he is or might <br/>
be.  My sister thinks homeschooling is something I&#39;ve &quot;done&quot; to my son, yet <br/>
she and her husband both work and have shipped their kids off to day care and <br/>
school since day one.  Bullies beat my nephew up on an almost daily basis, and <br/>
she does nothing.  And I&#39;m going to let HER opinion of <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling influence ME?  I don&#39;t think so.  I know this is long, and I&#39;m sorry.  To <br/>
sum it up, be at peace with yourself and your decisions, and establish some <br/>
boundaries.  If family members want to discuss in a respectful way, by all means, <br/>
educate them.  If not, they need to shut up.  Hang in there, we are all here <br/>
with you.<br/>
