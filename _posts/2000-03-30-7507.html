<div id="ygrps-yiv-624474165">Hello all,<br/>
       Does anyone out there homeschool foster children? I am very open to <br/>
being a foster parent, but don&#39;t know how I would handle schooling. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to send some to school and keep others at home, but I don&#39;t <br/>
know if I&#39;d be allowed to hs foster kids. I won&#39;t send my son to school and <br/>
I&#39;m afraid it would cause conflicts if we had other children who had to go. <br/>
The foster children might resent my son for not having to go, and even my <br/>
son might think he was missing something. Has anyone had any experience with <br/>
this? Any ideas?<br/>
                                                 Trisha<br/>
