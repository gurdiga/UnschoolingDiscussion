<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067630758"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I know of a site where folks post rebate info, special deals<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my sister has a great site at www.clevermoms.com - lots of coupon codes <br/>
(6 or 7 of them are book stores!) separated by category  - children, <br/>
software, toys, pets and so on - plus she will be opening a resale side <br/>
of the site very soon where you can buy/sell gently used items - she has <br/>
a homeschool/unschool section there -  <br/>
I enjoy it - think you all might, too<br/>
