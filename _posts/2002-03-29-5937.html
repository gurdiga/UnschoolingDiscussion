the train?  Can&#39;t they see that in an hour it will have been 12 hours on <br/>
the job and they will be 30 minutes outside of Alphabet, and maybe they <br/>
should call ahead and tell the crew where to meet them?  I mean, <br/>
sheesh...How about a little planning?<br/>

&gt;And there are Girl Scout and Boy Scout troops and 4H <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And Camp Fire Kids!  Their programs include the traditional <br/>
scouting-type club (both boys and girls), the Community Family Club (the <br/>
whole family is involved), child-care, Special Sitters (respite for <br/>
those who care for special needs), Teens in Action (service and <br/>
leadership program for teens).  <br/>

If a kid just did Camp Fire and nothing else, they&#39;d get a pretty <br/>
well-rounded education.  I just spent the last 2 hours fitting certain <br/>
kids&#39; daily lives and activities into the Camp Fire awards program. <br/>
 They&#39;re going to be the most decorated kids in the council!  I have Pam <br/>
S to thank for showing me how do that with educationese.  ;)  A skill <br/>
that easily transfers to other venues.  lol.<br/>

whole sash was filled with badges, (Scouts Canada doesn&#39;t have the same <br/>
religious and anti-gay bias as the US bunch.) and he won most points at the <br/>
fair for 3 or 4 years in a row before he lost interest in both.  He entered <br/>
vegies he&#39;d grown, baking, canning, eggs, flower arrangements, woodworking <br/>
and other crafts, sewing (He made a simple quilt for his newborn niece when <br/>
he was 6.)<br/>
