<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593918033">Well,<br/>
<br/>
In an effort to figure out what all of our interests really were, and what we&#39;d all like to *do* about them... we made lists of things we&#39;d really like to do (including me :o)). Now I&#39;m in the process of trying to find ways to realize these things.<br/>
<br/>
Today I found an animal rescue about 45 minutes away.  We are going to start volunteering there.  Its all cats and dogs, but we LOVE cats and dogs.  THey need volunteers to clean litter boxes and pens, but they also need volunteers just to spend time with the animals, take them for walks, groom them etc.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t take them in, but if we can&#39;t bring them here, then we can at least go to them!!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m REALLY looking forward to this.  I love animals and have been longing to spend some time at a rescue.  They are a &quot;no kill&quot; rescue too, which I&#39;m so happy about.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter wants to ride horse, so I have to find a stable where they would be willing to let her volunteer in exchange for lessons.  In the meantime, her GS troop is going to work on a badge that involves horses.<br/>
<br/>
I got the info for 4H and the meeting is in March.  My daughter decided to try photography instead of sewing.  My son is planning on attending Camp Woodward this year for skateboarding.<br/>
<br/>
We are set with Girl Scouts and gymnastics for the girls.  My son will probably swim again this summer.  And he&#39;s planning on working again this summer too.<br/>
<br/>
The DarkBASIC software finally arrived and its harder than we thought (wow, talk about MATH!), but 3D Gamemaker is fun.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been playing with Cuisenaire Rods and Math Made Meaningful cards (which are just like a bunch of puzzles...they are FUN).  LOL I just sit down and start playing with them and before I know it, everybody else sits down to watch and try what I&#39;m doing.<br/>
<br/>
And I got my replacement book of Math Wizardry for Kids (We LOVE that book!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m checking out JoAnne Fabrics to see if they have any sewing classes for my daughter (and maybe me LOL). I also have a craft book that lists all kinds of places to get craft supplies (like scraps of material or paper, etc.) for FREE.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;d like to try some backpacking, just for a weekend this spring or summer.<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
