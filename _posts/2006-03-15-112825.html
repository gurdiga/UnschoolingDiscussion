<div id="ygrps-yiv-247234821">My older children just attended aprogram called &quot;life in a jar&quot;.  This is an<br/>
amazing story of some teens from Kansas working on a history day project.<br/>
Now (for about 6 years or so) they continue to tell the story of a Polish <br/>
catholic social worker who helped save 2500 children during the holocaust.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, while working on the project, they looked for the woman&#39;s <br/>
gravesite, and found out she was still alive (still is - 96 yrs old).  They <br/>
began a correspondence through a translator, and have been able to visit the <br/>
woman several times.  They do not accept payment for their presentation, but <br/>
they leave out a &#39;jar&#39; and all donations go to supporting this woman in her <br/>
care needs.<br/>
