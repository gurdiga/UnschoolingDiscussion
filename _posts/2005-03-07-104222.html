<div id="ygrps-yiv-14701055">Just a little brag.<br/>
<br/>
My almost 10.5 yr old daughter has been taking riding lessons for about 8 months.  She&#39;s head-over-heels in love with horses (like many girls her age) and has been begging for more riding time.  Well, finances are tight just to pay for the lessons she&#39;s getting.  So...<br/>
<br/>
She asked at the barn if she could volunteer to work so that she could ride more, and they said yes!  So she spent 6 hours there on Saturday, working a lot and then riding, and yesterday after her lesson she spent 3 hours working, mucking stalls, washing food bowls, and sweeping.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to see if she can go on a weekday as well.<br/>

That&#39;s so exciting.  Congratulations to your daughter.  Sometimes if you are<br/>
just willing to ask, people are willing to work with you.  My girls and I<br/>
work together at the barn where we board our horse in exchange for boarding<br/>
costs.  It is so worth it and we just love the work.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My 8 yo dd who had had a riding accident (badly sprained hand and loss of<br/>
confidence) about a year and a half ago, is once again confident in her<br/>
riding.  It is so great to see her come back and exceed where she was before<br/>
her fall.  She is now beginning to canter on our horse and you can see her<br/>
renewed confidence in her whole posture and seat.  It is so rewarding.  Now<br/>
that the girls can ride so much more frequently than they used to, they are<br/>
progressing quickly in their abilities and it is so much fun to watch them.<br/>
It&#39;s almost like you can see the differences from day to day.<br/>
