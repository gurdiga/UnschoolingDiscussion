<div id="ygrps-yiv-78192723">According to the state of CA there were no charters before 1992.  Therefore,<br/>
there<br/>
couldn&#39;t have been a charter in 1989.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;California&#39;s Charter School Act of 1992 established charters schools as an<br/>
option . . .&quot;  and &quot;In 1991, Minnesota passed the first charter school law,<br/>
with California following suit in 1992.&quot;  Innovations for Excellence, The<br/>
California Charter School Story, published by the State of California.<br/>
<br/>
Although the law was passed in 1992, no schools were chartered before 1993.<br/>
<br/>
The charter schools are all numbered and school number 1 was San Carlos<br/>
Charter Learning Center and they were chartered February 11, 1993.  Their<br/>
charter was revoked.  Nor is school #2 (Magna Carta in Rohnert Park/Cotati)<br/>
closed.  School #3 (Creek Side Oaks in Lincoln) is still &quot;active&quot; and it did<br/>
not open until July 1993.<br/>

&gt; Could you please tell me when charter schools were first sanctioned by the<br/>
&gt; State of California?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, what schools were chartered in 1989.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>

&gt; &gt; The first charters were in 93 so in less than 10 years.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; The charter I use was started in 1989.  I think it has been a<br/>
&gt; charter school for that length of time - I know the program<br/>
&gt; has been in existence since then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533528764">They are probably using the limited number rule.  The law was set up to<br/>
allow only so many charter school.  The original law, which has been<br/>
amended, only allowed 100 charter schools.  They have dozens, if not<br/>
hundreds of aps that they are refusing using the number limit.<br/>

&gt; That must be why it&#39;s called charter 25 then.  Like I said I know the<br/>
&gt; program has been going since 1989 since they have notebooks of activities<br/>
&gt; and photos from then.  They became a charter when that was available.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW the entire district wanted to turn charter - as in all the schools<br/>
&gt; would be charter schools serving different needs of the community.  The<br/>
&gt; State Board of Education refused to let them do it last school year.<br/>
