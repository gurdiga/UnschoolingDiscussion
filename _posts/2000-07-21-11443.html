<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457743857">Because of lack of time I skip over a lot of posts on the digest. I noticed lately that there has been a lot of talk about children and croup and asthma.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to mention that homeopathy, under the care of a real homeopath, can work wonders for asthma and allergies. We&#39;ve used homeopathy for years for other things and I&#39;ve run into many peolpe who say it&#39;s been a godsend.<br/>
