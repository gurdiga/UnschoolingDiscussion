<div id="ygrps-yiv-10478235">Sorry but I still don&#39;t believe the crime rate is down.  I also don&#39;t<br/>
believe the majority of what I read in newspapers.  I only say that because<br/>
on several separate occassions I have read articles about myself in<br/>
newspapers that did not even slightly resemble the real story.  Freedom of<br/>
the press pretty much covers it all and lets you slant things they way you<br/>
want.<br/>

&gt; People feel like violence is up - but, in fact, the violent crime rate is<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Monday, January 1, 2001<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Urban areas throughout the nation have recorded similar decreases in their<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is the fourth consecutive year that homicides have declined by double<br/>
