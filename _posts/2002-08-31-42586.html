&lt;&lt; How have others answered relatives this thick-skinned? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a letter to my sil telling her that in order for her to have contact <br/>
with her nephews and niece, she needed to respect our boundaries. The <br/>
boundaries that I am comfortable with, which include my dh and I being the <br/>
parents, not her.<br/>
Her advice on parenting/unschooling or anything else regarding the raising of <br/>
our children was not welcome, period.<br/>
We have had zero contact with her since....her choice.<br/>

&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>

Where is your husband in all this?  I have a hard time taking up issues with<br/>
my in-laws, but my dh has a loving, caring past with his parents, so we try<br/>
to have him sit down and talk with them when it needs to be done.  Would it<br/>
be possible for him to kindly, lovingly, and firmly tell his Mum that at<br/>
your house, you do things your way and while she is welcome, she&#39;s not there<br/>
to change you but enjoy you.<br/>
<br/>
She may not like it, or even hear it, but it gives you a basis from which to<br/>
stop her.  (&quot;I know, Mom, but remember what Joe said?  We are doing what WE<br/>
think is right.&quot;)  Just a thought.<br/>

math and science so he became a mathematician/physicist. Now <br/>
she&#39;s trying to do the same to DD (and was so pleased when the <br/>
school rated DD as &#39;extremely gifted&#39; at maths and couldn&#39;t <br/>
understand why I was ticked off with labelling)<br/>
