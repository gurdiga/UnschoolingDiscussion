<div id="ygrps-yiv-682960124">I was reading this thread and got to the point about<br/>
the &quot;consequence&quot; of cleaning up something you break. <br/>
I was reminded of the other night here at home.  The<br/>
three adults in the house had just finished playing a<br/>
board game.  We were picking up, rising from the table<br/>
to get ready for bed.  I took a small glass dish on<br/>
the table and slid it closer to the edge, thinking I<br/>
would pick it up when I got up to take it to the sink.<br/>
 The table it seems was exceptionally slick however,<br/>
maybe because Tom had made bread on it that day, and<br/>
the dish instead sailed clean off the table and had a<br/>
mini explosion on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
It was somewhat late and we were all pretty tired.  I<br/>
was staring stupidly at the reamins of the dish for a<br/>
few seconds, and then we all just looked at each other<br/>
and started laughing.  Thomas (9), coming to<br/>
investigate the noise, took the kittens out of the<br/>
room so they would not cut their feet on glass shards.<br/>
 Nicole and I moved the chairs and things out of the<br/>
way and Tom went to fetch broom and dustpan to sweept<br/>
up, all without discussing it or doing more than<br/>
laughing and my recieving a bit of gentle ribbing for<br/>
launching the dish to it&#39;s demise.<br/>
<br/>
Being that we were all tired, my potentially being<br/>
able to have a cranky response at that time and having<br/>
been a bit stunned by what happened at first, if they<br/>
had instead reminded me to clean it up, not moved to<br/>
help me and been less congenial overall, I think it<br/>
would have been a much bigger deal than it needed to<br/>
be and I would have felt overall a lot worse about<br/>
something ultimately pretty stupid and minor.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure glad no one informed me of the consequences of my<br/>
actions or directed me to see to it.<br/>
