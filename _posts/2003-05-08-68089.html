<div id="ygrps-yiv-124327075">It sounds to me like unschooling teaches kids to think, while school teaches <br/>
them to conform and obey.<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that *special*, *different* people have movies made <br/>
about them, ie, Dr. Patch Adams, but when kids try to emulate him, they are <br/>
shot down.<br/>
<br/>
Or is it just me?   : )<br/>

PS: I don&#39;t understand what some of the abbreviations you use mean.  What is <br/>
dh?  I think it has to do with husbands, but I can&#39;t figure out the d!<br/>

<br/>
the d,  which I also had a hard time figuring out,  can be darling,<br/>
dedicated, darn,   which ever adjective you have in mind!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its not just you,  its the truth.   I think its the whole respect thing.<br/>
That children get so little of it in most circles.<br/>
<br/>
Its like the saying, &quot;do as I say not as I do&quot;   so hypocritical.   I had a<br/>
teacher who would say that,  in certain ways it was funny because he was<br/>
admitting that he couldn&#39;t live up to his standards.  Yet on the other hand,<br/>
I think of it now and its sad because so many people do believe this way.<br/>
And they don&#39;t believe there is any other way!<br/>
<br/>
Well,  us unschoolers will show them,  huh!<br/>
