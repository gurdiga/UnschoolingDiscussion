&lt;&lt; Could you give me some kind of idea what mainly changed in your diet.  You <br/>
 sound like me, although I&#39;ve never had &quot;problems&quot; digesting these things, I <br/>
 have had bouts of depression since my kids were born and your old favorites <br/>
 sound like mine...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Bonnie,  For as long as I can remember, I have been a chocolate lover.  As <br/>
I grew up, I became Pepsi&#39;s #1 fan.  :)  I also have always been  the type of <br/>
person who gets nervous easily, and as I grew up became more phobic about <br/>
things.  I would worry about things excessively, and fear things needlessly.  <br/>
Pregnancy made things enhanced the first time around... I had a sense of <br/>
depression throughout the pregnancy, which lifted almost immediately at <br/>
delivery.  The next time around, the digestion trouble started in conjunction <br/>
with eating corn, or with corn as an ingredient, and sometimes dairy.  The <br/>
gas was painful.  When I was a teen, the allergy symptoms started, which <br/>
seemed like seasonal allergies-- hayfever, itchy red eyes, sneezing.  In my <br/>
20&#39;s I began getting headaches which made me feel sick.  I left work a few <br/>
times feeling so bad-- I&#39;d go home, get sick, and go to bed-- to wake up <br/>
later feeling fine.  The headaches got so much worse during pregnancy the <br/>
first time around, so when I got pregnant again, the doc had me go on a diet <br/>
to eliminate foods that triggered migraines.  It was here I began noticing <br/>
that what I ate affected how I felt. After my second pregnancy, what seemed <br/>
like post partum symptoms kept getting worse, as the months went by.  I began <br/>
having more anxiety and worry, and by the time the baby was 7 mos I had had <br/>
enough.  I was having a terrible time  digesting some foods, but was unsure <br/>
exactly what was setting it all off.  I once thought I was having <br/>
appendicitis, b/c of the pain; then it felt like my gall bladder was acting <br/>
up, then it seemed like I might have an ulcer.  I was also having a lot of <br/>
trouble sleeping at night, so I was feeling a lot of fatigue, which fueled <br/>
more worrying.  As it turns out, white flour products such as white bread, <br/>
and other refined foods are a part of the problem.  Eating fruits that have a <br/>
high natural level of sugar are also a problem for me, as are starchy <br/>
carbohydrates, such as potatoes and corn.  I have cut out all refined sugars, <br/>
white flour products, potatoes and corn from my diet at this time.  I do <br/>
still eat dairy products, but use  lactose supplements, which has made a <br/>
tremendous difference.  I eat whole wheat flour or oat flour bread products, <br/>
like pancakes and tortillas.  I use a low glycemic sweetener called &quot;Sweet <br/>
Balance&quot; in my cooking, as it is proven not to affect blood sugar levels.    <br/>
In addition, I take a multi-vitamin (my Prenatal, as my baby is still <br/>
nursing), and a B-complex and calcium supplement.  The goal is to keep the <br/>
blood sugar level in check, so I eat a snack usually every couple of hours, <br/>
and before bed I eat yogurt or have a homemade yogurt shake.  The b-complex <br/>
helps  to stabilize the nervous system, which is hit the hardest when blood <br/>
sugar levels are out of balance, and the calcium supp. and snack before bed <br/>
is to help keep the level in check during the night, which will help me sleep <br/>
better, and helps prevent muscle cramps, which occur when blood sugar levels <br/>
drop off.   I would be happy to talk further with you if you would like to.  <br/>
:)  Take care.  ~Karen</div>
