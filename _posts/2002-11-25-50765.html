<div id="ygrps-yiv-291274939">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just finished Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves,<br/>
<br/>
great book for people who are having a hard time making the jump from curriculum to no curriculum!    She was a teacher.  I&#39;m going to tie up my husband and read this to him!   Although he might like that&lt;gg&gt;, just kidding.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I especially like the fact that her son went to The Language Villages here in Bemidji, MN.   Christian, the son, went to Waldsee, German Village.  A good friend of mine is one of the directors out there.   The Villages are just up the road from me, about 5 miles and my father-in-law was the director of those for about 20 years.  I have alot of connections there,  I love Skogfjorden, Norwegian Village.  Because of my Norwegian blood.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Actually, immersion learning is very unschoolish,  immersion is how they learn at the villages.  No books, just activities.  So my fil is really understanding our unschooling approach.      He came to me a few weeks ago and asked why he saw the light go out in kids eyes around 3rd grade.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is what he saw when he was a teacher,  30 years ago.  I informed him the light went out in his grandson&#39;s eyes in preschool!   Hmmmmmm..<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  thought I&#39;d share,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is wondering about the language villages,   I&#39;ll ramble more if you want.   They are a great experience for kids.  And of course, our house is close to it so,,unschooling party, my house!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For my boys, that was about the time the &quot;light went out&quot; for them.. Well,  <br/>
my son youngest is in 2nd grade, but I can see it fading.  My daughter never <br/>
lost that light, that bright burning interest in school and learning.. But, <br/>
she been the exception, and not the rule in my family.  Hopefully, that light <br/>
will come back as soon as they are FREE from the grips of public education.  <br/>
Gosh, I feel liberated myself. :-)<br/>

The college that runs the villages is Concordia College, out of Moorhead, MN.  But the villages have different locations around rural Minnesota.  There are about 6 different ones in/around Bemidji,  (I&#39;m guessing on the number, it keeps growing).      The sites are beautiful,  the new French, Spanish and Finish ones are amazing,  but my heart still goes out to old Skogfjorden,       Norsk.<br/>
 <br/>
God dag!  (Good day)<br/>
