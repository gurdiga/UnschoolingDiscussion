The Army looked into Clonlara and decided that it wasn&#39;t &#39;real school&#39; <br/>
because he never went to classes.  All our arguments, including faxes from <br/>
Clonlara showing their accredidation, went for naught.  Eventually Chris was <br/>
&#39;allowed&#39; to enlist during one of the windows in which the Army &#39;temporarily&#39; <br/>
lowers its standards in order to meet quotas :)  So he could enlist as a <br/>
non-highschool grad.<br/>
<br/>
I was told that the Air Force is not so stinky; I don&#39;t know about the <br/>
Navy/Marines.  But I suspect all the services have those windows, because <br/>
they all have quotas to meet.  And if your child can do well on the testing <br/>
the services give, they will find a way to enlist the child.<br/>
