<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091920284">I think the TV issue is a touchy one.  What you have to remember is <br/>
that given unlimited Television as one option in a houseful of <br/>
options, many kids will watch a lot and get bored with it and move on <br/>
to other things.  That is exactly what happened with my girls.  My son <br/>
however, has a problem with it.  (Well, it&#39;s one of many problems for <br/>
him.)  He will sit and do nothing else for hours on end and no, it is <br/>
not all educational television.  And some of it is stuff he knows <br/>
byheart he has seen it so much.  With him, it became a health issue in <br/>
more than one way so we stepped in and did something.  We worked out <br/>
exactly which shows he REALLY wanted to watch and which times he would <br/>
go do something else.  Now his life revolves around the TV schedule <br/>
but at least he gets a little exercise from time to time now.<br/>
<br/>
But it souds to me like you think all children would be like Wyndham. <br/>
 That&#39;s not true.  I know many children who have self-regulated and <br/>
now watch very little TV (my girls included.)  I think there are a lot <br/>
of kids out there like Wyndham, but it is important to be certain that <br/>
the child has a real problem before you take action.<br/>
<br/>
I think I understand why you disagree with the TV thing as presented <br/>
here, but please give it a little thought.  Maybe yours just need a <br/>
little time to come to terms with it on there own.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Is there any *graduates* of unschooling with success stories to tell??  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There used to be lots of such stories in Growing Without Schooling, and back <br/>
issues of that are still available.  HEM has a column by/about grown <br/>
homeschoolers (leans toward unschooling usually).  I know several grown and <br/>
late-teens unschoolers myself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You see I still have this FEAR that my child is missing something from this <br/>
that I will regret years down the road.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody learns everything.<br/>
Honors students in the best schools don&#39;t even get everything that school <br/>
offered.<br/>
<br/>
Try to think what your child is missing getting in school that, if he had <br/>
gotten that you would regret THAT for years and years.  (Think shame, <br/>
bullying, pressure, nonsense, friends you would never have met who might not <br/>
be good friends in some dangerous ways--think all the worst things you know <br/>
about school, and be glad they&#39;re missing THAT.)<br/>
<br/>
Think of what you yourself missed.  (I don&#39;t know what it might be, but I bet <br/>
there&#39;s some &quot;school thing&quot; you never understood as a kid, or you were just <br/>
sick and missed it, or your teachers all happened to skip it, while another <br/>
friend in the same school with different teachers had it presented three <br/>
times over the years.)   When you DID come across a need to know, or the <br/>
information suddenly appeared and clicked, how long did it take you to learn <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
What it takes a seven year old a year to learn will take a fifteen year old <br/>
half an hour or so.  Waiting can save LOTS of time and frustration.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; NO CHILD, unschooled, homeschooled, public schooled, or anything else can <br/>
benefit from watching ALL the TV they want!!  Sorry folks, but that&#39;s just my <br/>
opinion.  There&#39;s far too much GARBAGE on TV to have a positive influence. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Who will decide what they should watch?  My parents liked what they liked, <br/>
and had not one clue about what they had never seen.  My mom used to turn off <br/>
PBS stuff because she didn&#39;t want to hear &quot;that noise&quot; (music usually), but <br/>
loved dramas about the WWII, and westerns.   Her decisions were bad for what <br/>
I needed to see and hear.  Our tastes and our needs were different.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;THere is no requirement of thinking for a child when they watch hours of <br/>
TV.  I don&#39;t care how *Good* the programs are.  Children develop mentally by <br/>
THINKING, using their imagination, creativity!!!!!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Children think when they watch moments of TV.  I don&#39;t care how bad the <br/>
programs are, they think.  But then my kids don&#39;t choose to watch bad TV when <br/>
there&#39;s anything in the world better to do, and I&#39;m sure yours wouldn&#39;t <br/>
either.  They&#39;ll turn off GREAT TV if there&#39;s something better to do.  And <br/>
video is the simplest of all to turn off, because they can pick it up again <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Children develop mentally by THINKING&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Children think all the time.  Children develop mentally by incorporating new <br/>
information into what they already know.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  How can people think  that PS is a bad influence but then can let the <br/>
child sit in front of the TV hours on end???&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are some homeschoolers (Christian homeschooling writings lean heavily <br/>
on this) who don&#39;t like school because their children will be exposed to <br/>
unGodly people and to &quot;humanist lies&quot; and to multiculturalism which they <br/>
consider non Biblical.  Others just don&#39;t think the school&#39;s methods lead to <br/>
longterm, useful, happy learning.  Many of school&#39;s methods harm children&#39;s <br/>
abilities and desires to learn naturally.  <br/>
<br/>
From unschoolers, I hear them say that when removed from the school <br/>
environment, children can learn in their own best ways, at their own natural <br/>
pace, from things that really interest them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I don&#39;t believe they are watching *EDUCATIONAL* programs all this time. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you divide the world into &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;not educational,&quot; unschooling <br/>
will be defeated.  An &quot;educational&quot; program will not reach someone who <br/>
doesn&#39;t care, already fully  knows, isn&#39;t paying attention, or whatever.  <br/>
Children learn from what sparks their curiosity, from new phrases and <br/>
accents, from mysteries and watching Jeopardy, from old Twilight Zone or <br/>
Gilligan&#39;s Island shows, if they find the material interesting and there&#39;s <br/>
something they had never thought of before.   I wouldn&#39;t &quot;assign&quot; or press <br/>
ANY of that on anyone, but neither would I snatch it away.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Who will decide what they should watch?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I decide that I have to draw the line somewhere. I &quot;censor&quot; all the programs <br/>
in my home, including what I&#39;ll watch. I hardly ever watch anything that I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want my daughter walking in on. I don&#39;t get much out of programming <br/>
that is supposedly for adults, but seems increasingly luring to younger and <br/>
younger audiences. I despise and will not permit in my home:<br/>
<br/>
-Jerry Springer and other garbage talk shows<br/>
-Professional Wrestling<br/>
-most soap operas<br/>
-the Clairol Herbal Essence commercials and similar commercials irritate me <br/>
also, so I avoid channels/airtimes that they constanly air on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We used to have the TV on a lot for background noise, not as a choice, just a <br/>
mindless habit. That hardly occurs anymore, especially now that we are <br/>
unschooling. I prefer that if my daughter wants to watch something, she come <br/>
and ask me, not just sit and surf. Mostly she enjoys the Game Show Channel, <br/>
channels like History, Discovery, Food TV, PBS, etc. I am easily annoyed by <br/>
the Cartoon Network and most Nickelodean programming, but I still allow her <br/>
to watch it occasionally. We keep the computer and televisions in family <br/>
rooms only. I don&#39;t believe in TVs and VCRs in childrens&#39; rooms, or <br/>
unsupervised internet access. I have a TV in my bedroom, and would leave it <br/>
on all night like a night light for years (my husband&#39;s preference more than <br/>
mine), but in the past few months of not bothering to find the remote <br/>
control, I have enjoyed not using the TV much at all anymore. I find I have <br/>
more time to read, get projects done, and my time doesn&#39;t evaporate as <br/>
quickly as it used to. My quality of life has improved, and I assume it has <br/>
for my kids as well. TV time has become more of a treat, when we plan and pop <br/>
popcorn it becomes special time to reflect together, not just a big &#39;ole <br/>
distraction. That&#39;s my experience! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920142152">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
two things here I&#39;d like to respond to--<br/>
<br/>
first, re television. I let them watch what they want, but, we discuss <br/>
what they watch  A LOT. This is sort of like the book discussion thing. <br/>
We realized, in our discussing, that we watch tv two ways - sometimes we <br/>
sit and watch the show, and sometimes we just want the background noise <br/>
while we are doing something else, like ironing or folding laundry or <br/>
cleaning our room or cooking or whatever. My 8 yo dd complained that <br/>
during a certain time when she like the tv on for background noise, <br/>
there was nothing on worth watching (inc. pbs, nick, cartoon, etc.) I <br/>
suggested History, Discovery, or Animal Planet. As an example, we put on <br/>
History channel to see what was on, and there was one of those <br/>
archaeology type programs and they were trying to find some ancient <br/>
civilization. She found that very interesting. My other dd will <br/>
generally go with animal planet.  Yeah, there&#39;s junk on tv, but there&#39;s <br/>
an awful lot of good stuff too. First, you have to know where it is, and <br/>
second, discuss with them how to discern what is and isn&#39;t good tv. The <br/>
girls got in a discussion one time about some show or other, and they <br/>
were disagreeing whether or not it was a worthwhile show. They <br/>
eventually concluded that the show glorified the type of girl-cliques in <br/>
schools that decide who is in and who is not. So they chose not to watch <br/>
it anymore. I just listened, and was not involved in the discussion at <br/>
all. For myself, A&E or CNN are my &quot;noise&quot; channels, and as for other <br/>
stuff, we tape what interests us and watch it later. We are currently <br/>
watching shows from Feb. We only watch one at night, if that, so it <br/>
takes a while to see the ones that interest us.<br/>
<br/>
An ongoing discussion we have is to find &quot;pro-homeschooling&quot; kid shows. <br/>
This began when older dd complained that there were never any <br/>
homeschoolers on tv. So we have started an informal list of shows and <br/>
movies that are homeschool-friendly. So far we have the Wild <br/>
Thornberrys, Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang (his kids do go to school, when <br/>
they feel like it, and this is just fine with him). There&#39;s any show <br/>
that takes place before the advent of public schools, Swiss Family <br/>
Robinson, and others (can&#39;t think of them just now, but you get the <br/>
idea).<br/>
<br/>
second, although I went to ps, I think I&#39;ve always been an unschooler at <br/>
heart. In second grade, I was allowed to read ahead, read tons on my <br/>
own, was reading Nancy Drew books by then. I spent a lot of time in the <br/>
woods near our home investigating and learning. My grades almost always <br/>
reflected my level of interest - I never could do busy work, and tended <br/>
to ignore stuff that was a waste of my time (this drove mom and many <br/>
teachers nuts). I remember reading John Holt in college and thinking it <br/>
was good stuff. As a teacher, I had a very student-centered, busy, noisy <br/>
classroom - this drove other teachers nuts - and this was math and <br/>
computer courses in high school. In college I took classes that <br/>
interested me, sometimes taking senior level classes to meet group <br/>
requirements instead of the easy entry level ones. I know that the stuff <br/>
from my education/unedcuation that was worthwhile was not the <br/>
workbook/tests/follow the herd stuff, but the unschooling kind of things.<br/>
<br/>
I would think that many of us who are unschooler parents would have <br/>
similar stories and experiences of never quite buying into the whole ps <br/>
follow the herd, do what you&#39;re told, think what you&#39;re told. Now we <br/>
just get to do it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

wear off.  Any one else go through this?  I love some of the cable channels<br/>
Discovery, CNN, History and etc, but he is choosing Cartoon and Nick? Of<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They are out there. It&#39;s just tough to find the people and their stories<br/>
because when people are living contented lives, they generally don&#39;t have a<br/>
burning need to go out and tell everyone how they did it. Whereas if they<br/>
have complaints, then they have a powerful need to vent to whoever will<br/>
listen ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Peter Kowalke is one grown unschooler. He has a webpage at<br/>
http://www.peterkowalke.com/<br/>
<br/>
Grace Llewellyn runs the Not Back to School Camp (http://www.nbtsc.org) and<br/>
they have a message board. I&#39;d bet many of the kids keep in touch after<br/>
they&#39;ve moved on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You see I still have this FEAR that my child is missing something from this<br/>
&gt; that I will regret years down the road.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helps if you can try to identify what exactly you&#39;re afraid he&#39;ll miss.<br/>
Too often we end up choosing the path laid out by &quot;experts&quot; because we&#39;re<br/>
certain there are things we&#39;d never think to ask about but that the experts<br/>
have already asked all possible questions and found answers to them.<br/>
<br/>
School-type learning (eg, making sure they cover &quot;the essentials&quot;) is *one*<br/>
solution. But it&#39;s a solution with it&#39;s own flaws. Learning &quot;because it&#39;s<br/>
important to your future&quot; is hard and time consuming and is designed more to<br/>
provide feedback that the things were taught not that they were learned.<br/>
<br/>
So what is it you&#39;re afraid he&#39;ll miss? If you can pinpoint your worries,<br/>
they can be dealt with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling sounds good and seems to<br/>

&gt; doubts that HE is learning all he will need later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If we assume there&#39;s a body of learning that is unconnected to what it would<br/>
be used for, then that&#39;s a legitimate worry.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately school gives us the impression that there&#39;s a *huge* body of<br/>
knowledge that&#39;s unconnected to its use. Mainly because schools teach it<br/>
that way: isolated and out of context. The only way to learn math seems to<br/>
be to do a gazillion math problems. The only way to learn science seems to<br/>
be to memorize all the answers scientists have discovered. The only way to<br/>
learn history is to start at the beginning and go through all the<br/>
&quot;important&quot; events to present day.<br/>
<br/>
But when we learn by living life, all that stuff becomes tools that we pick<br/>
up and use for the purpose intended. There&#39;s no reason not to use (and learn<br/>
as a side effect) math when there are games and stuff to spend allowance on<br/>
and things to figure out. There&#39;s no reason not to use science when the<br/>
world is full of wonderous things and a child is filled with curiosity. (It<br/>
won&#39;t look like school science. It will look like -- and *be* -- real<br/>
science: observing and asking questions and theorizing what could be the<br/>
cause.) There&#39;s no reason to not use history when the past is full of<br/>
stories of interesting people and places and events.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also have to disagree with the TV watching.  NO CHILD, unschooled,<br/>
&gt; homeschooled, public schooled, or anything else can benefit from watching ALL<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if you said &quot;NO CHILD can benefit from reading ALL the books they<br/>
want!!&quot; or &quot;NO CHILD can benefit from playing ALL the games they want!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s assuming (or extrapolating from some different situation) that when<br/>
children are allowed all the TV they want, they&#39;ll do little else, that<br/>
they&#39;ll spend years watching indescriminately.<br/>
<br/>
Why would they?<br/>
<br/>
*If* TV is controlled and doled out like a prize, then they&#39;ll watch garbage<br/>
just because TV is so precious. *If* they are in school, they&#39;ll often watch<br/>
TV as a way of depressurizing after school.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids, given free access to TV have neither of those reasons for<br/>
watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sorry folks, but that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But are you basing what you say on your opinion of what will happen or on<br/>
personal knowledge of allowing your kids for many months to watch as much TV<br/>
as they want?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There&#39;s far too much GARBAGE on TV to have a positive influence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you think children would choose deliberately to watch garbage? Do our<br/>
tastes need to be molded by experts in what is good in order to choose what<br/>
is good? Or can our kids develop their own sense of what is good and bad by<br/>
experiencing good and bad and deciding from their experience what is useful<br/>
to them and what is not?<br/>
<br/>
Or are children such slaves to a need to be entertained that they&#39;d choose<br/>
garbge over going somewhere or doing something they enjoy with mom?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; THere is no requirement of<br/>
&gt; thinking for a child when they watch hours of TV.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe if children feel overloaded and are choosing TV as a way to turn off<br/>
the pressures they have no control over. (As schooled kids might.)<br/>
<br/>
But since my daughter absorbes tons of stuff -- things that relate to her<br/>
world as well as the adult world -- then I&#39;d say she&#39;s doing a great deal of<br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t care how *Good* the<br/>
&gt; programs are.  Children develop mentally by THINKING, using their imagination,<br/>
&gt; creativity!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And many children find TV a great fodder for thinking, imagination and<br/>
creativity. Pokemon has branched off into a huge number of things that<br/>
relate to adult knowledge and adult skills.<br/>
<br/>
But I think we also need to recognize the value of their needs as the people<br/>
they are right now. Memorizing all 251 Pokemon isn&#39;t something she&#39;ll use<br/>
much as an adult -- though it exercises skills she&#39;ll use as an adult -- but<br/>
it&#39;s something that&#39;s important to the person she is right now. And feeding<br/>
what&#39;s important to her right now is what will help her become the person<br/>
she will be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can people think  that PS is a bad influence but then can let the child<br/>
&gt; sit in front of the TV hours on end???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because there&#39;s more than passively watching involved in PS. There&#39;s being<br/>
there by force, listening to and doing something they don&#39;t care to learn.<br/>
<br/>
A child watching TV is choosing what appeals to him, what *he* finds useful.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I don&#39;t believe they are watching<br/>
&gt; *EDUCATIONAL* programs all this time.  Children learn from TV good and bad.<br/>
&gt; Are these parents who allow unlimited TV being selective about what they<br/>
&gt; watch?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t a need to. Children are self-selective. My daughter may choose<br/>
things that I wouldn&#39;t choose for her, but she has needs that are different<br/>
than mine. I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;s getting out of Squarebob Spongepants, but<br/>
the enthusiasm with which she watches it and then replays verbally for me<br/>
all the episodes, means there&#39;s something important to her.<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t watch anything that&#39;s scary or sexual any more than she&#39;d watch a<br/>
political talk show. Her world is divided into useful to her and not useful<br/>
to her rather than good and forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
I am selective about what *I* watch. There are R movies that we choose to<br/>
watch when she isn&#39;t there or has other things to occupy her. We don&#39;t force<br/>
her to choose between watching an adult movie with us vs being alone. But<br/>
given full freedom to choose anything she wants, she doesn&#39;t choose the<br/>
things I would protect her from anyway.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;The only way to learn science seems to<br/>
be to memorize all the answers scientists have discovered.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Only the easy ones, at reading level.  Second grade science isn&#39;t the coolest <br/>
science second graders could possibly understand, but is stuff they can read <br/>
about in very short words and very short sentences.  That&#39;s why they read <br/>
about bugs and trees, because the words are small.   &quot;In fall the leaves turn <br/>
red and brown.&quot;  That&#39;s about as long a sentence as a first or second grade <br/>
science book might have.  They might teach them &quot;photosynthesis&quot; and then <br/>
rest for a week from the effort of so huge a concept!  Meanwhile, unschooled <br/>
kids who can&#39;t read don&#39;t even notice the lengths of words or the <br/>
&quot;difficulty&quot; of concepts because each kid is at his own cutting edge.<br/>
<br/>
And for high school science, unless the school can afford subscriptions to <br/>
Science News or some Scholastic newsletter (which will be weeks old by the <br/>
time it arrives), they&#39;ll be dependent on texbooks.  IF the&#39;re brand new, <br/>
they&#39;re probably two or three years old in content.  If they&#39;re not new to <br/>
the school, that&#39;s however many years (up to five or six) the school has <br/>
owned them plus that two or three years of writing, editorial, sales, <br/>
publication, deliver.  Seven year old science &quot;news&quot; is not uncommon in <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The only way to<br/>
learn history is to start at the beginning and go through all the<br/>
&quot;important&quot; events to present day.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Present day&quot; meaning, often, t. Understandings and interpretations change.  <br/>
Public sentiment and political correctness change.  The version of the <br/>
Vietnamese war told to kids in school now will not match what was learned <br/>
twenty years ago.  But parents sometimes have a simplified idea that there IS <br/>
a static, simple, chronological body of knowledge and there isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
At home with movies, video, magazines, TV and the internet your kids can <br/>
learn more about ANY period of history or any historical figure than they <br/>
would ever be taught in school.  <br/>

To your first question -- I have a 17 yo unschooled kid who has already <br/>
finished her first two years of college with nearly an A average. And I know <br/>
a LOT of other unschooled kids who are in universities now - they&#39;re not <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids benefit from watching exactly that: &quot;All the TV they want.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
You must be assuming that &quot;all the TV they want&quot; is always excessive amounts <br/>
AND that kids always choose to watch garbage.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like such an odd assumption.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have too many other things going on in their lives to want to spend <br/>
excessive time watching garbage tv shows. They have unlimited access to tv, <br/>
but they don&#39;t normally sit and watch it for hours and hours - they turn it <br/>
on and off selectively, watching programming that they choose for their own <br/>
reasons, even if it is not always immediately apparent to me why they choose <br/>
what they choose.<br/>
<br/>
People often assume that kids with no tv limits will watch excessive amounts <br/>
and will watch inappropriate stuff or garbage -- but it is not at all my <br/>
experience. If I put limits - if I said, &quot;Two hours per day is your limit and <br/>
you can&#39;t watch anything on Channel 11,&quot; for example, then they&#39;d probably a<br/>
lways make sure to WATCH their two hours a day whether they really wanted to <br/>
or not and they&#39;d be real real interested in what was on Channel 11. <br/>

do? And, you decide what to watch, too, based on getting the most value from <br/>
the time you do spend watching?<br/>
<br/>
My kids do that too. Themselves. Just like you.<br/>
<br/>
My kids also always ask, &quot;Is it okay if I turn on the tv?&quot; because it is in <br/>
the main room of our house where we all are, most of the time, and they&#39;re <br/>
asking to be courteous, not because they need permission.<br/>
<br/>
We have two pairs of infrared headphones, so that people can watch tv without <br/>
the rest of us hearing the sound. We also have headphones on the computer <br/>
which is in the same room, so the person on the computer can have the sound <br/>
up without the rest of us having to hear it.<br/>

Hi, Sandra --<br/>
<br/>
Do you think this is true of timid children?  I sometimes think my son<br/>
clings to TV like a large, blocky, not-portable security blanket.  He&#39;s<br/>
turned down offers to go swimming and to the park in order to continue<br/>
watching TV.  Television is really a risk-free activity.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t watch every single hour that he&#39;s awake, as some people<br/>
fear.  He intersperses TV watching with other play.  However, when we<br/>
*purchased* Rush Hour II, he did watch it three times in one day.<br/>
(Maybe he was thinking that he had a limited time with it, even though<br/>
that wasn&#39;t true.)  He does try to be near the TV every afternoon for<br/>
Pokemon and Jackie Chan adventures.  (I tape it for him on park days.)<br/>
<br/>
How many hours of TV per day or per week would people find alarming?<br/>
Anyone want to quantify?  I don&#39;t limit TV viewing here, and I&#39;m not<br/>
completely comfortable with the amount we have.  (Which I would have to<br/>
guess at, but I&#39;ll bet it averages close to 3 hours, out of the 14 he is<br/>
awake.)<br/>

person and one who IS getting out and doing other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be perfectly comfortable with watching the video three times in a row -- <br/>
it is called: &quot;STUDYING&quot; &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be comfortable with the  wanting to be there to see &quot;his shows&quot; too. They <br/>
seem sort of &quot;trivial&quot; by adult standards - but they are a BIG DEAL to him. <br/>
<br/>
I want you to know that I honored my three daughters&#39; obsession with Sailor <br/>
Moon for months, maybe years. Life seemed to revolve around making sure we <br/>
didn&#39;t miss recording any episodes. I think the show is pretty stinky - I get <br/>
NOTHING out of it at all, really. Just annoyed &lt;G&gt;. But I totally supported <br/>
it and encouraged it -- first, I KNEW there was stuff they were getting out <br/>
of it that I didn&#39;t understand (my limitation - not their fault) and second, <br/>
it WAS bringing three sisters together, bonding around a common interest. <br/>
They&#39;ve lost interest. But there are a lot of nice memories for them and a <br/>
special interest in Japanese has perservered - encouraged also by Pokeman.<br/>

I haven&#39;t read that, but when I was in high school I heard rumor that one <br/>
company had been chosen over another because the superintendent had been <br/>
offered an RV if he chose that one.  <br/>
<br/>
My friend&#39;s dad was superintendent.  <br/>

Do you have my son?  Nope, he&#39;s still here.  Boy does yours sound like <br/>
mine taste-wise anyway.  Pokemon, Jacki Chan and now Scoobie are on <br/>
the must see list of his.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t quantify and amount that I find alarming because that isn&#39;t <br/>
how I looked at it.  During the winter it is not unusual for ME to <br/>
watch 8 or more hours a day while I&#39;m crafting.  During the summer, I <br/>
might watch an average of an hour a day.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that I notice in what you wrote is where you said, &quot;He&#39;s <br/>
turned down offers to go swimming and to the park in order to continue<br/>
 watching TV.&quot;  That would concern me.  Does he WANT to go and doesn&#39;t <br/>
feel safe going?  Or is he afraid he&#39;ll miss something good on TV?  <br/>
How old is he BTW?<br/>
<br/>
If he is just afraid of missing something good, use the TV listings <br/>
and a VCR to help him overcome that.  Having a watch and an <br/>
understanding of what was on at what times helped Wyndham some.  The <br/>
not feeling safe thing is something I am only just starting to <br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
Wyndham has some serious problems and is seeing a therapist.  She <br/>
recommended a medical psychiatrist ASAP . . . preferable one who <br/>
specializes in Pediatric Neuro-Psych.  Currently, we are think ing it <br/>
is OCD mixed with Asperger&#39;s.  But the possibilities of Anxiety <br/>
Disorder and Tourettes are still there too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to say your son sounds like mine therefore he must have <br/>
those same disorders but I think I can give you a bit of advice about <br/>
the TV thing.  And the most important piece of advice I can give you <br/>
is to follow your heart and instincts not your brain and the research <br/>
you&#39;ve read.  You are there with him and are his mother.  You will be <br/>
the first to notice a problem, but you have to be sure you are looking <br/>
at it from your heart and not from some societal norm.<br/>

I know also that each book must reflect different cultures, sexes etc.  There <br/>
are people whose job it is to count how many pictures of women, people of <br/>
color, disabled, etc., are in each book to make sure the book is well <br/>
&quot;balanced.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Joy Hakim&#39;s wonderful History of US series is not yet an approved textbook <br/>
because it doesn&#39;t have all the instructor&#39;s materials -- test banks, <br/>
overhead projector pages, etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think her book is too good to be an approved text, it wasn&#39;t written with <br/>
the idea of having to please various special interest groups.<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, the K-12 textbook market is really cutthroat in these two <br/>
states!<br/>

Another problem is they&#39;re not laid out to correspond to a school year.  They <br/>
would need to have chapters which were &quot;lesson&quot; length, with matching sets of <br/>
questions, and units which would take two weeks to complete.  It would help <br/>
if each book divided into semesters easily.  That would involve stretching <br/>
out some time periods and incidents and glossing over others. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re just altogether too real and good to be textbooks.<br/>
