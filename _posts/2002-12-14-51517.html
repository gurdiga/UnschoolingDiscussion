<h4>Yol, Vishnu & Shanti</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-48554610"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; This is what I think.   I think it&#39;s possible posters who are quick to<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel injured and claim they have been attacked are probably suffering<br/>
&gt; &gt; from low self esteem.   I have noticed a connection between those who are<br/>
&gt; &gt; afraid their children will take advantage of them or make them<br/>
&gt; &gt; subservient and those who yell they&#39;ve been hurt when ever someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; disagrees with them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d bet my life (or not) that many who feel attacked here, feel attacked<br/>
&gt; &gt; frequently other times and places as well and by all kinds of people, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a long list of injuries in their lifetime. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Deb wrote that and Yol wrote:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-This kind of statement is plainly aggressive and judgmental, but of course<br/>
&gt; later on you&#39;re going to say that you didn&#39;t mean anything by it... In my<br/>
&gt; dictionary, that&#39;s simply not taking responsibility-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yol, some of us have been involved in these kinds of discussions for a long<br/>
&gt; time.  This list is relatively new.  The discussions about unschooling<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t.   Three or four times a year someone will show up and be a bundle of<br/>
&gt; defensive anger.  Deb&#39;s seen it often.  If you haven&#39;t seen it much, please<br/>
&gt; withhold judgment on Deb&#39;s voluntary, free (you said &quot;cheap) summary theories.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find it very interesting that when someone who&#39;s been here for &quot;a long time&quot; says something words don&#39;t hold the same significance and meaning as when &quot;new&quot; people express their views. So, Deb is okay and shouldn&#39;t be &quot;judged&quot; by her comments, but again<br/>
the rest of us mortals can be judged as much as the-people-who&#39;s-been-on-this-list-for-a-long-time want? Let me quote you here:<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not just words, it&#39;s the thoughts we have that go with those words.&quot; I agre with that statement 100% but I think it applies to EVERYONE on this list, not just to those who haven&#39;t been-on-this-list-for-a-long-time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind a heated discussion. I am very passionate about what I believe in and have been in many heated discussions. It&#39;s the attitude some of you guys have that IMO needs a check. It&#39;s a bit hollier-than-thou, if you know what I mean, like you<br/>
invented unschooling or something.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you will save your post and re-read it in a couple of years, I think<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll see that Deb had a legitimate point.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t save these posts. I simply read and move on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is another pattern.  Those who are often so disruptive and defensive<br/>
&gt; sometimes aren&#39;t committed to unschooling and end up going to eclectic or<br/>
&gt; unit studies or something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not sure what you&#39;re talking about. Who is &quot;defensive&quot; and &quot;disruptive&quot;? For being so UN-schooling you guys sure like to label things and people. Is this also part of your unschooling approach?<br/>
I am an observer and I express what I&#39;ve been observing. This list actually smells too much like a clique to me.<br/>

You&#39;re free to question anything at all.   There are no gods here though<br/>
you&#39;ve been trying to draw a picture of some conflict between gods and<br/>
mortals.  That conflict doesn&#39;t exist because we&#39;re all just moms and<br/>
dads<br/>
with ideas about a better life for our kids.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re free to judge my comments, anyone can,  but it means little to me<br/>
because like everyone else here, my parenting choices have  been held up<br/>
to much criticism and scrutiny over the years.   Theres very little I<br/>
haven&#39;t already heard, although I know I still have much to consider.<br/>
<br/>
***I am an observer and I express what I&#39;ve been observing.***<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t this what I did and what you are now so angry about?<br/>
It&#39;s what happens here.  We read, we consider,  we learn, we question, we<br/>
make observations.   Is there some part of that seems contrary to what<br/>
this list is for? <br/>

<br/>
I was talking about YOUR OWN e-mails.<br/>
Not about saving anyone else&#39;s.  About saving the one in which you had <br/>
summarized your feelings.  I believe your feelings will change in two years.  <br/>
If you don&#39;t want to save that, you certainly don&#39;t have to, but if seeing <br/>
how far you&#39;ve come might make you feel good (as it makes lots of other <br/>
people feel good, me certainly and always) it might be a good thing to save.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s a question of self-awareness, but of course that&#39;s an individual <br/>
thing. I cannot make you se what you don&#39;t want to see. You guys are perhaps <br/>
a little too defensive about YOUR concept of unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m confident that what my kids have experienced has not hurt them and has <br/>
been good for them.  They&#39;re really open and reasonable and thoughtful <br/>
people.  More than I expected or could have predicted.   So when people come <br/>
and suggest neglect or suggest that people here are exaggerating, or that we <br/>
just happened to have good kids and what we did didn&#39;t affect them, SEVERAL <br/>
people are going to object to those glib summaries.<br/>
<br/>
It is because my kids had freedom to make choices early that they don&#39;t <br/>
agitate about decisions now.  It&#39;s because they&#39;ve been able to choose foods <br/>
that they don&#39;t eat a bunch of junk even though it&#39;s readily available.   <br/>
It&#39;s because they don&#39;t see history as something to be avoided that they can <br/>
discuss history in the same tone and with the same enthusiasm as they discuss <br/>
video games.   So if someone says &quot;Kids will learn to make decisions because <br/>
we&#39;ll tell them what good decisions look like,&quot; and &quot;unschooling works <br/>
differently in different families; my kids have to do math and write,&quot; or &quot;My <br/>
kids are just kids so I&#39;ll make decisions for them  until they&#39;re old enough <br/>
to make decisions,&quot; those statements will be held up to experiences of <br/>
families who have with many years&#39; experience found that those &quot;management <br/>
decisions&quot; by parents will serve to hold kid back, not to give them wings.<br/>
<br/>

Doesn&#39;t coming here and saying we suck and you&#39;re leaving violate your <br/>
principles?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is a good example of one of the types of misunderstandings that<br/>
goes on here. It&#39;s all about miscommunication and hearing something other<br/>
than what was written.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one of the things that happens:<br/>
<br/>
Person A says &quot;I do such and such.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Person B says &quot;People who do such and such can have this problem.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Person A reads Person B&#39;s statement as &quot;Such and such is wrong. You&#39;re bad<br/>
for doing such and such. You should change to do it my way,&quot; and responds<br/>
defensively.<br/>
<br/>
This is the result of the different ways we use language. It can be a result<br/>
of how we&#39;ve heard sentence structures used in real life. The above may have<br/>
been the sentence structure we heard as a child that was used as an insult<br/>
so we &quot;hear&quot; that insulting tone when the writer obviously used no tone at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
And the above could be taken personally. You could respond with &quot;I didn&#39;t do<br/>
that&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s not what happened.&quot; But that would be taking it personally<br/>
and not talking about the *idea* of miscommunication.<br/>
<br/>
The first quote is about the *idea* of being able to look back and compare<br/>
years ago thinking with today&#39;s thinking.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the idea and don&#39;t see it as a personal comment, is there<br/>
something untrue about &quot;If people never keep journals or re-read their old<br/>
letters, it&#39;s harder for them to have a good perspective on their own<br/>
progress&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
(Though come to think of it, I *think* (though perhaps I&#39;m deluding myself!<br/>
;-) I&#39;ve got a good memory of my past thinking to compare to present<br/>
thinking. I keep drawing on it to explain to people why they believe<br/>
something is true (for example, math needs hours of practice) and why that<br/>
isn&#39;t right and what is right and why it&#39;s right.)<br/>
<br/>
But what it *doesn&#39;t* say is &quot;You&#39;re a bad person if you don&#39;t keep a<br/>
journal.&quot;<br/>

Funny how people at other lists spend time and energy talking about <br/>
this  one, but nobody here seems to focus on what the other lists are <br/>
doing or saying....<br/>
hmmmm?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286408236">***What I&#39;m saying is that you guys need to check your hollier-than-thou<br/>
attitude. In other words, it seems that you&#39;re trying to *teach*<br/>
newcomers how to<br/>
unschool, but you can have a different attitude with the people<br/>
who-have-been-here-long-enough. It&#39;s a question of self-awareness, but of<br/>
course that&#39;s an individual thing. I cannot make you se what you<br/>
don&#39;t want to see. You guys are perhaps a little too defensive about YOUR<br/>
concept of unschooling.***<br/>
<br/>
Yol, If I said to you, I love yoga, and I&#39;ve learned a lot and I really,<br/>
really think it&#39;s the right thing for me, and I told you I practiced it<br/>
by sitting in a half lotus at a cock fight while shooting up, (why do I<br/>
persist in these horrible analogies?)  don&#39;t you think you would feel<br/>
inclined to tell me I might not have the best understanding of yoga?<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you want to let me know that yoga can be so much more than a<br/>
sitting posture, that it could in fact, be a life changing experience if<br/>
only I&#39;d open my mind to all the possibilities? <br/>
If you and I have such a different concept of yoga, would you be silent<br/>
while I helped others find yoga the way I know it? Would that be the best<br/>
yoga help they could get?   Or would it be better to hear more, and think<br/>
of more possibilities?<br/>
<br/>
Because someone knows more possibilities of unschooling doesn&#39;t make them<br/>
better people.   I&#39;ve never gotten the impression here that anyone thinks<br/>
of themselves as better human beings than others.   But like all things<br/>
some can have more experience, some can have broader understanding, some<br/>
can have better ideas.   No one here is looking down on you.  You don&#39;t<br/>
want my cheap (free!) psychoanalyses so I won&#39;t give it (but just barely)<br/>
but no one thinks they are better than you are.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you have felt picked on.   I really think we would miss your<br/>
contribution if you left.  <br/>

I am not on either side. Sometimes the best defense is no defense....one can choose to not take offense/defense (no matter how &quot;appealingly&quot; it is dished ouit!).  Ignore some of those voices and put some on &quot;the back burner&quot; to consider in time (your choice) on the way to refining your own truth...and that can change with time and experience (for everyone)...that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>

 <br/>
I thought this analogy was great,  <br/>
 <br/>
I am just beginning my journey with yoga, so I&#39;m not trying to pass judgement.   I am only relaying some of my thoughts.   <br/>
 <br/>
Alot of what I&#39;ve been reading on yoga doesn&#39;t jive with negativity,       I guess when I get caught up in negative or critical thinking,   I think--is this the way Patanjali (a great yogi)  would have acted or spoke?<br/>
 <br/>
Its very hard to see past our own internal feelings and see what is actually happening.  I would guess that it is especially hard to see actuality on a computer screen.<br/>
 <br/>
Kind-of off the topic of unschooling, yet it has enabled me to stop and see my kids for who they are, not for who I want them to be.<br/>

<h4>Yol, Vishnu & Shanti</h4>
<time>17 Dec 2002, at  7:13pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219998324">Deb,<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I want to thank you for your reply. It seems that you do want to come to a mutual understanding, instead of just writing me off, labeling, of treating me like a kid who knows nothing about unschooling or this list, etc. I consider this a much more mature reaction than all the previous ones (yours and others&#39;) to my posts. And I truly appreciate that.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I never felt *I* was picked on. But I have observed the attitude I was criticizing since I joined this list. So, no apology needed there. It was a general observation on the dynamics of this list, not a personal defense in particular. I do not take things so personally when it comes to e-lists, because to be totally honest with you, I don&#39;t care much about what others think of me. I&#39;ve always been what you may call *unconventional*<br/>
and I tend to have very strong opinions about things.<br/>
<br/>
To follow on your example of yoga, there is so much so-called yoga out there it&#39;s pretty amazing. It&#39;s become one of the best business in this country. have you noticed they use yoga postures to advertise everything now? Do I consider *that* to be yoga? No, of course. I am part of an ancient lineage where yoga still means &quot;union with God,&quot; where yoga is a series of sacred practices that lead to meditation and liberation, not the latest fad<br/>
to to get a *sexy body* or *be cool* or things like that. We call that bhoga (or &quot;experience of the world&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Yet I know it&#39;s human nature to bend and distort and use and misuse everything we find. So, who am I to say &quot;This is yoga and this is not. You&#39;re wrong.&quot; It would just be my ego talking, and that would not be very yogic, right? We host a meditation center here in NC. Am I going to say, &quot;What you have been doing so far is not meditation!&quot;? NO, I take people from where they&#39;re at and move forward WITH them, sharing practices, tricks,<br/>
experiences, whatever. Otherwise they would leave and never come back, right?<br/>
<br/>
What I mean here is that if you follow an *unschooling* philosophy (which I think I do, regardless of what the &quot;experts&quot; may say), then it must be a philosophy of your whole life, of how you talk and relate to your kids, to your spouses, to your fellow homeschoolers, to your fellow list participants, and to life. That&#39;s what made me wonder if it was worth being on this list. I truly believe that if you want to unschool you need<br/>
self-awareness: self-awarenes of your own school-trained mind, of the tendencies you grew up and were raised with, of all the crap you absorbed from your parents, siblings, teachers, partners, etc., that creeps up on you when you are faced with the responsibility of being a conscious parent and an unschooler. The way I see it, you have to constantly keep an eye on yourself because that&#39;s an important part of what your kids are learning.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I expected more self-awareness from this list. My mistake, I suppose. And my mistake again to try to bring it to the attention of its participants.<br/>
<br/>
I am a conscious parent, and I believe in unschooling as much as I believe in Rousseau&#39;s or Holt&#39;s ideas, the continuum concept, breastfeeding my daughter on demand til she was 4, having a family bed, and respecting her needs, her inner intelligence and her choices. And yes, I interrupt my conversations when she needs to tell me something because I consider she has less control over her impulses and I want her to feel heard and respected<br/>
like any adult. Or else, I ask her politely to wait a minute. I&#39;ve seen mothers almost spank their kids because they want to stop their dance class and go pee! I take my daughter seriously, her needs, her desires, her thoughts, her imaginations, her feelings, you name it. To me, that&#39;s unschooling. I would never say to her, listen, you haven&#39;t been on Earth long enough to understand what this is all about. I thrive on watching her unfold<br/>
and discover for herself. So, I don&#39;t like it when someone here says that to me or someone else either. I hope you can understand that.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate you wanting me to stay and participate. I am still here. I think it&#39;s important to have a place where we can share, learn and support each other in the choices we&#39;ve made for ourselves and our children.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ***What I&#39;m saying is that you guys need to check your hollier-than-thou<br/>
&gt; attitude. In other words, it seems that you&#39;re trying to *teach*<br/>
&gt; newcomers how to<br/>
&gt; unschool, but you can have a different attitude with the people<br/>
&gt; who-have-been-here-long-enough. It&#39;s a question of self-awareness, but of<br/>
&gt; course that&#39;s an individual thing. I cannot make you se what you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to see. You guys are perhaps a little too defensive about YOUR<br/>
&gt; concept of unschooling.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yol, If I said to you, I love yoga, and I&#39;ve learned a lot and I really,<br/>
&gt; really think it&#39;s the right thing for me, and I told you I practiced it<br/>
&gt; by sitting in a half lotus at a cock fight while shooting up, (why do I<br/>
&gt; persist in these horrible analogies?)  don&#39;t you think you would feel<br/>
&gt; inclined to tell me I might not have the best understanding of yoga?<br/>
&gt; Wouldn&#39;t you want to let me know that yoga can be so much more than a<br/>
&gt; sitting posture, that it could in fact, be a life changing experience if<br/>
&gt; only I&#39;d open my mind to all the possibilities?<br/>
&gt; If you and I have such a different concept of yoga, would you be silent<br/>
&gt; while I helped others find yoga the way I know it? Would that be the best<br/>
&gt; yoga help they could get?   Or would it be better to hear more, and think<br/>
&gt; of more possibilities?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because someone knows more possibilities of unschooling doesn&#39;t make them<br/>
&gt; better people.   I&#39;ve never gotten the impression here that anyone thinks<br/>
&gt; of themselves as better human beings than others.   But like all things<br/>
&gt; some can have more experience, some can have broader understanding, some<br/>
&gt; can have better ideas.   No one here is looking down on you.  You don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want my cheap (free!) psychoanalyses so I won&#39;t give it (but just barely)<br/>
&gt; but no one thinks they are better than you are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry you have felt picked on.   I really think we would miss your<br/>
&gt; contribution if you left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921640734"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Again, lack of self-awareness... Never mind... I hardly doubt I will stick<br/>
&gt; &gt; much longer in this clique. I&#39;ve heard people on other lists express the<br/>
&gt; &gt; same things about you guys I see for<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself. Except that I call it lack of self-awareness and they have much<br/>
&gt; &gt; harsher words for it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; OH!!!! Now I see! Did you actually come here with a notion of what you&#39;d<br/>
&gt; find? Did you come here because you wanted to see what &quot;the others&#39;&quot; were<br/>
&gt; talking about?<br/>
&gt; You came here looking for trouble. You stirred stuff up.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Go back to your other lists and talk all you want.<br/>
&gt; If you come to an email list  looking for a &quot;fight&quot; you&#39;ll find one. At ANY<br/>
&gt; list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, that is a wrong assumption. I happen to be on several lists and some people on other lists are or have been here as well. Someone  mentioned this one, and so on... I was already here. And no, I didn&#39;t come looking for trouble. And no, I am not fighting, I was simply expressing my opinion, just like everyone else in here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;  You are what is known on email lists and newsgroups as a Troll<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so. You are making wrong assumptions. And if calling me a troll is meant to be an insult (it&#39;s the first time I hear that word), well... that&#39;s your choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988973782">Yol,<br/>
I&#39;m glad you stayed.<br/>
We may not come to full agreement here but that&#39;s alright.  <br/>
I realize you thought my comment about low self esteem was meant to be<br/>
insulting.<br/>
That wasn&#39;t my intention.  It has been my observation that people, women<br/>
friends of mine, who suffer from low self esteem feel insulted easily,<br/>
and when no insult was given.  Similar to the way a woman who is abused<br/>
flinches when someone raises a hand quickly.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t making a crack about it, I was thinking out loud and trying to<br/>
understand.   <br/>
I was considering the possibility.   You don&#39;t have to agree.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can imaging me sounding gentle here, calm and interested and<br/>
not snarky.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I understand your point about meditation, that you wouldn&#39;t tell<br/>
someone they had been doing it wrong when they come to you.   I<br/>
understand keeping someone on the path, even if there isn&#39;t full<br/>
understanding, because the path itself will eventually lead there.   But<br/>
what if, once they&#39;re at your clinic they continued to practice in a way<br/>
that won&#39;t  move them forward?    Would you tell them then that they<br/>
might have to give up some old practices to understand the new ones?  <br/>
How would you encourage them to stretch beyond what they are comfortable<br/>
with?    And how would you translate that to helping someone make a<br/>
stretch in unschooling?   If a mother was here trying to understand<br/>
unschooling philosophies, but posting about spanking, how would you tell<br/>
her she should stop spanking, or would you tell her at all?<br/>
<br/>
One thing about the people offering advice here is that they don&#39;t want<br/>
one more child to have one more spanking.  If there is a good time to<br/>
stop it&#39;s right now, this very minute, not in two months when the mother<br/>
is finally beginning to understand, so many don&#39;t waste one minute saying<br/>
&quot;STOP!   There&#39;s a better way and you can change everything right now.&quot;  <br/>
Of course it&#39;s not all about spanking, but it&#39;s the same idea.  Do you<br/>
see that?   Maybe I&#39;m not being very clear. <br/>
<br/>
And as you said you wouldn&#39;t tell people who come to your meditation<br/>
center that their previous experience wasn&#39;t really meditation  how do<br/>
you reconcile that with telling those here offering help, that they are<br/>
not really helpful?    Maybe you&#39;ll think this is a stretch on my part.<br/>
You might be right. &lt;g&gt;   My brain is not functioning at its highest<br/>
level today.  <br/>
<br/>
I like the way you talk about your daughter.&lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m the only unschooler<br/>
in my little town, and most of the talk I hear about and to children is<br/>
not nearly so loving and thoughtful.   <br/>
I understand you&#39;re sensitivity.  I am the same way I think.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
like to hear someone tell me I&#39;m not conscious parent.   I guess we<br/>
differ in our understanding though, of what people here are really saying<br/>
when they suggest we make a stretch.   I don&#39;t hear them saying &quot;you&#39;re<br/>
doing it all wrong&quot;   I hear, &quot;it could be even better.&quot;    What is the<br/>
difference in us, do you think, that you feel it&#39;s personal and I don&#39;t? <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some things I have changed about my parenting HAVE been very personal. <br/>
Some understandings I have come to have been painful.   I suppose there<br/>
is no way to look closely at ourselves and not be ashamed of some of the<br/>
things we find.    I have had my parenting criticized and it&#39;s not nice. <br/>
But I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s the same thing as what happens here.   I<br/>
think some of the discussions can inspire us to look more deeply at<br/>
ourselves and maybe find those things we&#39;re not proud of, but I don&#39;t<br/>
think the other parents here are telling anyone they are bad.    This may<br/>
be that place where we can&#39;t agree. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
I really am glad you&#39;re still here.  I have enjoyed your posts, I have<br/>
found your point of view on many things to be very interesting and I have<br/>
appreciated your knowledge.   <br/>
