<br/>
I DO &quot;shout it from the roof-tops&quot; that we UNschool. Because I figure that <br/>
there&#39;s got to be another----just ONE other!---parent out there like me, who <br/>
was turned off from homeschooling by the far right, conservative, <br/>
fundamentalist homeschoolers around here. I figure that maybe, just maybe, I <br/>
can change a life, or a few lives, by explaining unschooling. I explain in <br/>
grocery store lines, at the park, at the dentist&#39;s, anywhere. <br/>
<br/>
I SO wish I&#39;d met someone somewhere who had explained unschooling to me when <br/>
my boys were younger. My life and my children&#39;s lives could have been so much <br/>
happier so much sooner. <br/>
<br/>
My minivan shouts out &quot;Unschooler!&quot;. I have bumper stickers: &quot;Unschoolers <br/>
Live & Learn&quot;, &quot;Free to learn, do, and be. Unschooling Naturally&quot;, <br/>
&quot;Imagination is more important than knowledge&quot;, and &quot;Why be Normal?&quot;. My <br/>
license plate reads: UNSKULN. I carry my SOS bag everywhere: &quot;Never let <br/>
schooling get in  the way of your education.&quot; Because of these, I have been <br/>
asked often about unschooling; I am more than happy to explain and send folks <br/>
to unschooling.com & SandraDodd.com. <br/>
<br/>
Most folks are intrigued---a little. &lt;g&gt; They may not change today, but at <br/>
least they&#39;re aware of the possibility. The more people are aware of <br/>
unschooling, the more accepted it will become. NOT telling people just keeps <br/>
us &quot;in the closet&quot;. I &quot;out&quot; myself all the time! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It has truly changed my life---in many ways. I shout it from the rooftops: It <br/>
could change another life.<br/>

had unschooled all along, especially while my kids were younger, although <br/>
often, because &#39;life got in the way&quot; we actually did unschool.  I am hoping <br/>
to homeschool our adopted and foster sons next year,...I KNOW they will <br/>
thrive with unschooling...<br/>

has a nice sound to it &quot;those who&quot; is a little less pleasing to the <br/>
ear, IMO. Sometimes, it is better writing to be pleasing, than <br/>
grammatically correct.<br/>

&lt;&lt;My concern is having a t-shirt with questionable grammar (quote or not)<br/>
representing homeschooling.   I have a slight paranoia about people being<br/>

Like the wonderful shirts that were going around that read  &quot;We homeskool<br/>
are kids&quot;<br/>
