With great respect and admiration for Joylyn (and for Lexy and Jeanine).<br/>
This has not been our experience with floaties.  When they were very little,<br/>
each of our kids was thrilled to be in the water without floaties as long as<br/>
there was a grown up right beside them (which was, say, half the time).  If<br/>
the grown up was helping another child, though, or &quot;life-gaurding&quot; from the<br/>
side, they would wear a floaty- suit.  As they grew, they gradually gave up<br/>
the float suits because as they say &quot;you can&#39;t sink down in them!&quot; (duh,<br/>
mom).  My youngest dd 3 1/2 still likes to wear hers b/c it gives her more<br/>
independence in the water.  We still watch her like a hawk *all the time she<br/>
is in the pool* and she still likes her &quot;sink down&quot; suit when mom or dad is<br/>
with her.  She swims great but cannot stand with her head above the water in<br/>
the shallow end yet.  So being without the float suit tires her out pretty<br/>
fast and she really would rather be in the pool much longer than that.  In<br/>
our case, all of our children were capable of swimming well before they<br/>
wanted to give up floaties altogether.<br/>
<br/>
I can remember the first time each child fell into the pool accidentally (at<br/>
about 2yo for the older 2 and about 18 mo for the younger)  In all three<br/>
cases, they were able to kick themselves up to the surface and get to the<br/>
wall.  I was right next to them but did not interfere while they were doing<br/>
ok.  Anika loved this so much that from 12 months she would jump to me.  I<br/>
would not catch her but would guide her to the surface after.  She would<br/>
jump again and again and I never once &quot;caught&quot; her.  And she didn&#39;t want me<br/>
to.  It was her game.  &quot;do again!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As I write this the kids aree in the pool with dad for a little before<br/>
bedtime swim.<br/>
