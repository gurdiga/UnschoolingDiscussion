<div id="ygrps-yiv-407606009">Re the current topic of conversation regarding unschooling high<br/>
schoolers, transcripts, diplomas, etc. ~ I would highly recommend<br/>
reading Grace Llewellyn&#39;s &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit<br/>
School and Get a Real Life and Education.&quot; Before I read this book, I,<br/>
too, was &quot;worried&quot; about my unschooled high schooler&#39;s subjects, grades,<br/>
transcripts, and diploma; by the time I finished reading it, none of<br/>
that stuff mattered. A very powerful and *empowering* read.<br/>

<br/>
Llewellyn&#39;s other book real Lives is worth reading and Cafi Cohen&#39;s And What <br/>
About College is Very Informative.  Kimme</div>
