Hi,
<p>I tend to lurk for discussions like this, but your questions prompt
me to respond. YOu do make sense. I do not generally watch TV, but I am
learning to do since we pulled our son out of school a few months ago.
It is a way I can connect with him. He and my husband enjoy cooking as
a hobby. When he discovered the Food Channel a couple of months ago I was
the one who was in for an education even more than him. I have seen him
learn chemistry, cooking, social studies, fractions and all sorts of things
from a couple of programs. Of course, we supplement this, but, it does&nbsp;
spark his interest in lots of topics and leads to learning.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We sure do limit TV content in this house. We have
certain programs that are not allowed. Those are ones that we deem too
violent or that contain inappropriate content. We talk about our reasons
for not allowing them. It leads to lots of value teaching.&nbsp; I respect
his right and need to watch some TV, but as a parent I have the ultimate
responsiblity to take charge of what he sees. We also have our share of
acceptable videos he is allowed to watch at almost any time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also concerned about the advertising that occurs
with TV. We talk about it now that he is older. It was hard to do when
he was a lot younger. Our strategy was to buy videos, like Barney, Winnie
the Pooh and others.
<br>I will get off my soap box.

<pre>I am more concerned about limiting the &quot;content&quot;.&nbsp; TV is
not the same as it&nbsp;
used to be. I am more concerned with all the advertising
and the messages in&nbsp;
the shows themselves. Do any of you who do not limit &quot;TV
time&quot; limit &quot;TV&nbsp;
Content&quot;?? I am babbling--hope this makes sense, I&#39;m
tired:) Thanks so much!</pre>
