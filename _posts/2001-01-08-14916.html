<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388670153">I have always read to all my 5 children at bed time. Everything from <br/>
Fairy tales to Aesop.  There have ben the favourites that were read <br/>
so many times we knew the whole story off by heart.<br/>
My youngest (12yrs) gave up wanting to be read to about 12 months <br/>
ago.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817868646">We read in the morning, and at bedtime as a family. We<br/>
just started the Harry Potter series, and I really<br/>
love it. My 4 year old doesnt sit still, but he knows<br/>
whats going on in the story. The baby doesnt even seem<br/>
to notice theres a story being read, except for trying<br/>
to take the book out of Dad&#39;s hands once in a while. <br/>
Also, my oldest reads to the other 2 boys alot, if<br/>
they&#39;ll listen. He gets really upset when they dont<br/>
listen to him :)<br/>
