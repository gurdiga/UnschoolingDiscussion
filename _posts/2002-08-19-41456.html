<div id="ygrps-yiv-743123637">Here in IN, kids have to take a comprehensive graduation test.  How <br/>
ricidulous!  This is required even with good grade averages.<br/>
<br/>
But the stupidest thing is they have 4 tries, from their sophmore <br/>
year to senior.  <br/>
<br/>
My question: if they pass the thing in their sophmore year shouldn&#39;t <br/>
they be allowed to graduate?  Watch that one be shot down by the <br/>
board.<br/>
