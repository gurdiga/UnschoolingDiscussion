I have a 11 year old granddaughter who loves to write.  She writes all day<br/>
talking to herself and putting some stories down on paper.<br/>
I gave her 3 hours of writing coaching with Susanah Shaeffer (pas editor of<br/>
Growing Without Schooling) as a christmas present.  She has not completed<br/>
her first 20 chater novel.  It&#39;s great.  Refining and publishing isn&#39;t her<br/>
goal. But she does apprediate praise and comment on what she writes and is<br/>
not on her second and third novels.<br/>
I&#39;m now urging her to learn enough computer expertise to self-publish.<br/>
You are blessed to have such a daughter.  She will never be hurt by TV.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125926637">I wanted to thank everyone for all the wonderfull ideas. We are <br/>
going to try and get to the library this week-end and get some of <br/>
those books suggested.<br/>
<br/>
 She REALLY wants to be a novelist. But she understands that if she <br/>
wants to eat than she needs a job. Hubby&#39;s bosses wife is a freelance <br/>
writer and Amanda thought that would be a REALLY cool thing to do <br/>
until she publishes the next &quot;must read&quot; novel. She has already <br/>
written her first script and her play group will be preforming it <br/>
soon. She has also written an 80 pg book. It was VERY cute, and of <br/>
course THAT comes from me a completely unbias source. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>

daughter is... my daughter - another novelist in the making - gets a <br/>
magazine called TeenInk that she LOVES.  For what it&#39;s worth.<br/>

Minor but maybe really important point:<br/>
<br/>
Try to nudge the thinking toward &quot;I&#39;d really like to write a novel,&quot; or &quot;I <br/>
would like to get a novel published&quot; instead of using the &quot;to be&quot; verb.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of novelists are also other things.  Doctors, gardeners, teachers, <br/>
mothers, travellers, researchers, cops, robbers, lawyers.    <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;what do you want to be?&quot; questions are not as nurturing as the &quot;what do <br/>
you want to do?&quot; questions.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she will &quot;be&quot; a novelist if she has dozens of novels published.  But <br/>
maybe she won&#39;t.  And if someone becomes something naturally in the course of <br/>
doing what they love, that&#39;s great.  But if someone declares a goal that <br/>
involves &quot;being&quot; a thing, their odds of failure are way higher.   Someone with one <br/>
published novel might not &quot;BE a novelist&quot; if they didn&#39;t do another, but someone <br/>
who said she wanted to write for fun would be way ahead of the curve if she <br/>
had one successful novel.<br/>

<br/>
See even as a child I would rather be asked what I want to be rather <br/>
than what I want to do. But this is why  A VERY old nun asked me what <br/>
I wanted to do when I grew up. I looked at her and (in a very serious <br/>
tone and meant no disrespect) said &quot;Breathe&quot; I think I saw hell that <br/>
day. LOL She was not amused. LOL<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Not minor at all. We even talked about it. It just seems more <br/>
positive. I told her if you write you ARE a writer, you are not GOING <br/>
to be you are one. Does that make sense?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that is the most important thing. We have always talked to <br/>
the kids about picking a career that they love. Money is secondary if <br/>
not lower down. We ahve so many freinds who work at jobs they hate <br/>
just to keep up with the Jones. I would rather be dirt poor and love <br/>
my life than be rich and miserable. <br/>
<br/>
I am just glad they have the opportunaty to explore all that is out <br/>
there.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can do both. In fact, most novelists do both, by necessity. Most <br/>
novels, especially first-time novels either don&#39;t sell, or don&#39;t sell <br/>
well enough to pay the rent. Even most well-established novelists <br/>
started out through their first few books working at other jobs <br/>
(Stephen King was working at a laundromat, for instance). Actually <br/>
King&#39;s book &quot;On Writing&quot; is a really fascinating look at the craft of <br/>
writing and the kind of life one has as an emerging writer. He wrote <br/>
prolifically as a child, too (and accumulated a stack of rejection <br/>
slips, another thing that one has to get used to as a writer).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a novelist, working on my second novel. Even though I have a very <br/>
good agent, it&#39;s still a very tough row to hoe getting published <br/>
these days. 80% of first-time novels don&#39;t break even. Publishing <br/>
houses are being consolidated and taking less chances on new fiction <br/>
(you&#39;d be way better off writing &quot;The Low Carb Diet for your Pet&quot; of <br/>
course, non-fiction is selling like hotcakes). This can be gloomy, <br/>
but is also part of the reality of writing. You have to love it and <br/>
do it for love to do it at all. Fame and fortune are possible, but <br/>
not likely outcomes of writing.<br/>
<br/>
She might look for a local writer&#39;s group. Ours sponsors lectures, <br/>
reading, signings, conferences, how-to sessions, and critique groups. <br/>
All of these things can be great for someone entering the world of <br/>
writing. The writer&#39;s critique group I go to has been a wonderful <br/>
support and has really increased the quality of my writing. My son <br/>
started a kid&#39;s writer&#39;s group in our local homeschooling group, and <br/>
that&#39;s a great way to get together with other kids who have the <br/>
writing bug.<br/>
