<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853397622"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;For those of you who have deeply-held religious or philosophical<br/>
 </span></blockquote>beliefs, how do you approach a situation in which your child expresses a <br/>
desire to engage in an activity that runs counter to those beliefs?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since this thread originally referred to books and movies, I didn&#39;t pay too <br/>
much attention to it. We seem to have found a natural balance in our house <br/>
and my kids haven&#39;t brought home anything too shocking. Yet. When and if <br/>
they do, my dh and I are very open to letting them explore or exploring with <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
In looking at this quote again this morning, though, I realized that we <br/>
*are* dealing with this very thing right now. Conor has always been <br/>
fascinated with guns. He&#39;s NOT violent. He&#39;s NOT aggressive. He cries if he <br/>
accidentally kills a bug. But he has always wanted to play shooting games, <br/>
whether it&#39;s water guns, nerf guns, video games, whatever. He can tell you <br/>
how they work, all the different types, when they were used in which war, <br/>
etc. He&#39;s done his &quot;homework&quot;. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Now that he&#39;s getting older, though, his interests are getting older too. <br/>
Nerf guns ain&#39;t cutting it anymore and he wants a BB gun or a paintball gun. <br/>
Dh and I are HUGE pacifists and have been really pushing ourselves to help <br/>
him with this interest, but it&#39;s getting harder. :-/ Right now we&#39;re all <br/>
discussing the paintball gun idea and how safe those paintball arenas are. I <br/>
also want him to get a gun safety course and shoot a real gun to feel the <br/>
power, and danger, it holds.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that I could have denied him any access to any of this. <br/>
But I didn&#39;t. I DO trust him. I DO trust his intent. But in the meantime, as <br/>
his parent, I WILL make sure he&#39;s approaching this safely and I will <br/>
continue to discuss it all with his every step of the way.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Predestination is the belief that ones destiny is predetermined by God (or<br/>
&gt; some divine being).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** Which dictionary states that the term &quot;Predestination&quot; has anything to do <br/>
with &quot;God&quot;? I ask because I have never seen the term &quot;God&quot; used in it&#39;s <br/>
definition. Judie also said she believes in such a being. But that is only one <br/>
school of thought, there are those who even go so far as to believe we are all <br/>
God. My point being, that just because we may not recognize a school of thought, <br/>
belief system, philosophy or religion does not negate its validity to whomever <br/>
it serves. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Judie&#39;s belief is that people are choosing before being born the <br/>
&gt; experiences<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll have on Earth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** You asked Judie specifically how far that belief extends? Because <br/>
although I do not know Judie&#39;s belief specifically, there are those who believe that <br/>
we are each &quot;God&quot;, or an extension of the &quot;Universal Soul&quot; in which case if <br/>
that is what Judie believes she then fits your criteria of what predestination <br/>
is. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve never heard of that before in any traditional religions I&#39;m familiar<br/>
&gt; with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** But that is my point, you, me, Sandra, Judie or any other being not <br/>
&quot;hearing of&quot; or &quot;knowing about&quot; any religion or such does not make it invalid, it <br/>
simply means we don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Validity is based on fact or (keyword being OR) evidence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra said it &quot;doesn&#39;t have any historical or moral validity as far as I<br/>
&gt; know or can imagine.&quot; She&#39;s not saying what you think she&#39;s saying.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*** Then maybe you can tell me what I think or what she meant?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The way you&#39;re using &quot;valididity&quot; and &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot; are the way<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re used in scientific reasoning. They have precise definitions because<br/>
&gt; science needs to be cautious about what it stamps as &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But spiritual beliefs are beyond the realm of science. Why be defensive that<br/>
&gt; words can&#39;t be applied to something they aren&#39;t intended to apply to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually that is your perspective, which may very well be a majority <br/>
perspective, but it remains true that it is not everyones perspective. I used the <br/>
terms evidence and fact, because Sandra used the word validity. The fact that <br/>
those are scientific terms is also about perspective, along with the separating <br/>
spirituality from science. Not everyone sees them as separate. Not everyone <br/>
believes the same facts or the same evidence, if that were true, no one would <br/>
wonder if O.J. did it. There would be no need to defend anything if those who were <br/>
using inapplicable words would be clear about their intent and didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
intend on offending.<br/>

If you say something exists, show me.  Don&#39;t just say &quot;Your not knowing <br/>

<br/>
There are a lot of things I don&#39;t know.  There are some things I DO know, <br/>
though, and one is quite a bit of history of &quot;Earth religions.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I know nothing of religions on other planets except some of the new age seven <br/>
planes stuff (which I consider to be nonsense, though I&#39;ve been hearing about <br/>
it since 1968, courtesy of Jacqui Littlejohn) and the Mormon&#39;s ideas of other <br/>
worlds.  <br/>
<br/>
Those are both Earth religions, though, by today&#39;s definition of &quot;Earth <br/>
religion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is there a religion that says that people themselves cut deals with others <br/>
before birth to decide what relationships they will act out in the coming <br/>
lifetime?  It&#39;s not Buddhist nor Hindu belief, and they&#39;re the two major <br/>
reincarnation-believing religions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps this is where the real problem lies, you don&#39;t want me to tell you <br/>
anything, you want me to prove it to you. If that were so easy and so possible, <br/>
we would all have the same beliefs. However that is not how we exist today in <br/>
this plane. There is no way for me to prove what is truth to you, that is each <br/>
of our responsibilities to ourselves. I can&#39;t say, &quot;hey Sandra, last night i <br/>
met you when I astrally traveled to New Mexico&quot; and have that be your truth. <br/>
It could be mine, it could be both of ours where I recall it and you don&#39;t, it <br/>
could be we both recall it, in which case the truths would match and we could <br/>
easily agree. Then there are the times when both parties participate in the <br/>
same existence and yet one recognizes it as truth, while the other party <br/>
recognizes it and still wants to deny it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you an example:<br/>
<br/>
I have been able to leave my body since I was a very small child. I could go <br/>
places, see people and completely experience what they were. I learned quickly <br/>
to keep those times to myself, why? For no other reason than it makes people <br/>
uncomfortable about something they do not believe can happen or are afraid of <br/>
the consequences of believing in such things. People who are extremely close <br/>
to me know that I have that ability and some have even &quot;tested&quot; me. Then when I <br/>
am able to explain exactly what I saw and what they experienced I have gotten <br/>
the gamut of responses. Everything from &quot;Did you have a hidden camera?&quot;, to <br/>
&quot;Are you doing witchcraft? to &quot;Wow that was cool can you do it again?&quot; Each and <br/>
every time there was no question about what I experienced with them, but <br/>
there was a question as to their ability to accept it. <br/>
<br/>
So while I can&#39;t believe that I just shared my flights with this list and I&#39;m <br/>
sure freaked some out, I see this argument about Judies beliefs much the same <br/>
way. No one can make each of our &quot;truths&quot;. So for people like me there can be <br/>
many truths, not everything has to be black and white. <br/>

part of their belief systems, what I said in my post was that there are &quot;sects&quot; <br/>
of many religions that do accept predestination as a part of their system. <br/>
There would be no way to dissect all the religions of the world (or any other <br/>
;-) ). There&#39;s something like 40 thousand different sects to Christianity, so <br/>
who knows what religion solely believes in one way and only one way. Some are <br/>
far more fundamental than others, but there will always be dissenters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-976660244">I&#39;m asking for the origin of the belief that was being described.<br/>
<br/>
*** Can anyone give the origin of any belief system and have that be the tell <br/>
all end all? Many people believe the Earth was created in seven days <br/>
according to a book they read, does that make it true. What is the origin of the bible <br/>
and does knowing it&#39;s origin make it true or not? I don&#39;t claim to know the <br/>
origins of all my beliefs, only that I recognize what I know to be true, to me <br/>
and don&#39;t require it to be validated by someone&#39;s writing about it somewhere. <br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t invent the idea of astral travel, and it doesn&#39;t hurt anybody.<br/>
<br/>
*** I neither claimed to invent astral travel nor imply that it harms anyone. <br/>
Only that for me, I know it to exist and to be able to utilize it. <br/>
<br/>
The idea that one shouldn&#39;t have to feel sorry for someone who&#39;s been raped <br/>
or otherwise abused because they chose that, and that those who are violent <br/>
are <br/>
doing what they&#39;re SUPPOSED to do is NOT something I had heard, and I&#39;ve <br/>
asked repeatedly for any origin or justification, but am given generalized <br/>
defensiveness.<br/>
<br/>
*** No, I have repeatedly responded that your not &quot;hearing&quot; of such does not <br/>
negate the existence of such beliefs. As for defensiveness, perhaps if your <br/>
posts came across less offensive, the responses would seem less defensive. I&#39;m <br/>
not really sure. Each of us has to determine what to offend and defend. It&#39;s <br/>
odd though when the word defense is used as though it alone were a bad thing. <br/>
For defense can only exist in the realm where offense has occured.<br/>
<br/>
The person who claimed those beliefs has left the list rather than defend <br/>
herself.<br/>
<br/>
** That&#39;s unfortunate, but perhaps that was the extent of her lesson. She <br/>
came here and learned what she needed and left. <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of beliefs, but some have more validity than others.  If <br/>
someone&#39;s entirely schizophrenic and hears God telling her to kill someone, <br/>
her <br/>
&quot;belief&quot; isn&#39;t as valid as she might like to think.<br/>
<br/>
*** This is where we disagree. So the schizophrenic has as much validity as <br/>
the person in the white coat. They just don&#39;t agree which belief is the &quot;right&quot; <br/>
one, but then again there is the belief that there doesn&#39;t have to be a right <br/>
one. <br/>
<br/>
Some people&#39;s &quot;beliefs&quot; seem made up on the spot, or based on a <br/>
misunderstanding of something they think they heard or read.  Spurious.  <br/>
Shaky.<br/>
<br/>

refusal to accept any way other than their own way as &quot;the&quot; way. Equally sad to me <br/>
who says to each their own way.<br/>

this. Not just that there must be some sect of some religion somewhere <br/>
that does - but what IS it? What IS the religion that believes that <br/>
both the rapist and his victim chose to do that - before they were born <br/>
- and that we should not feel bad for someone who has been victimized <br/>
because they CHOSE that themselves?<br/>
<br/>
You said there are lots of religions or sects of religions that believe <br/>
this - is that where you got the idea? Can you clue us in on the origin <br/>
of this belief? Give us somewhere we can read about the historical <br/>
origins of it?<br/>
<br/>
If there isn&#39;t one you can name, if you came up with it yourself, <br/>
that&#39;s an answer, too, so say that. Nothing says that you&#39;re wrong, <br/>
just because you are the origin, but all that Sandra is saying is that <br/>
to the best of her knowledge there is no religion that teaches that <br/>
particular belief.<br/>

<br/>
The very first paragraph from my last post addressed my own beliefs. <br/>
<br/>
As for needing evidence that such a theory exists, if one were to google: <br/>
theory of predestination, predestination or predestination in religions, a vrtual <br/>
plethera of sites come up.<br/>
<br/>
If this belief were non-existant and only lived in the world of Judie (whom I <br/>
don&#39;t know by the way) and Rhonda, then why are there so many sites of debate <br/>
on the matter? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve understood Sandra, we simply don&#39;t agree. I also stated I don&#39;t require <br/>
written evidence to know what I know to be true for me. If Sandra can&#39;t accept <br/>
that, then so be it. But if Sandra truly wishes to know more than I have <br/>
written, she can look it up.<br/>
Maybe since you seem to know what she means, you can tell me why she is so <br/>
stuck on this topic, afterall, is it unschooling? Why can&#39;t we let it go that we <br/>
disagree and each move on? For everyone&#39;s sake we really should. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600437044">&lt;&lt;Rhonda - she&#39;s asking you to say what religion it is that believes <br/>
this. Not just that there must be some sect of some religion somewhere <br/>
that does - but what IS it? What IS the religion that believes that <br/>
both the rapist and his victim chose to do that - before they were born <br/>
- and that we should not feel bad for someone who has been victimized <br/>
because they CHOSE that themselves?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I first read Judie&#39;s philosophy, it sounded strikingly like that<br/>
expounded by author Sylvia Browne, in her book &quot;Life on the Other Side:<br/>
A Psychic&#39;s Tour of the Afterlife&quot;. I think she talks about it in other<br/>
books also, but this is the only one that I have read. It was given to<br/>
me by my recently widowed mother-in-law, and was undoubtedly of great<br/>
comfort to her. Browne presents her beliefs as information from a spirit<br/>
guide, and explains that there are souls who are inherently dark and<br/>
evil, who at death are immediately returned through a portal to this<br/>
plane of existence to continue their evil in the world - lost souls who<br/>
are also searched for by the higher evolved beings who strive what may<br/>
be an eternal battle for these individuals&#39; enlightenment. Evidently<br/>
they (ie the dark souls) act without the benefit of determining which<br/>
spiritual lessons they will seeking to learn this time around. I guess<br/>
they are the rapists etc. Browne also believes that we each have three<br/>
predetermined exit points and may choose to leave at any of them on the<br/>
spur of the moment - other than the final one of course. She asserts<br/>
that only the most enlightened of spirits choose to have what seem<br/>
horrendous fates, because they have a higher purpose for other folk in<br/>
their spiritual journeys. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t wish to argue with anyone about their spiritual beliefs. I only<br/>
mention this author to suggest that it is not a religion, per se, but<br/>
more of a conglomeration of some New Age philosophies.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a good description of Calvinism at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/calvinism.htm">http://www.religioustolerance.org/calvinism.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what other Christian denominations hold that belief but one<br/>
page said &quot;While retained in the creeds of several denominations, in the<br/>
public teaching of the churches the doctrine of predestination. has lost its<br/>
place and power.&quot; I know many fundamentalists hold Calvinistic beliefs. I&#39;ve<br/>
heard some mention predestination and Google turns up pages that make it<br/>
seem like the belief is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Judie also said she believes in such a being.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But no divine being was involved in Judie&#39;s definition of predestination.<br/>
Here&#39;s what she said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; My personal belief is that before we are born into this life, we<br/>
&gt;&gt; choose the kind of life we will live.  We choose our parents, choose<br/>
&gt;&gt; the circumstances of our lives, etc. based upon the lessons we need<br/>
&gt;&gt; to learn to perfect our souls.  Sometimes we choose really hard<br/>
&gt;&gt; subject matter because it involves a lesson we need to learn.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Sometimes we choose to be mugged, sometimes we choose to be the<br/>
&gt;&gt; mugger.  Either way, an important lesson went along with that<br/>
&gt;&gt; experience.  Every earthly experience involves learning a spiritual<br/>
&gt;&gt; lesson.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But that is my point, you, me, Sandra, Judie or any other being not &quot;hearing<br/>
&gt; of&quot; or &quot;knowing about&quot; any religion or such does not make it invalid, it<br/>
&gt; simply means we don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you implied that you *did* know here:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I ask because I am somewhat shocked that you don&#39;t realize that there is both<br/>
&gt; historical and moral validity to this belief system.  While one may not agree<br/>
&gt; with the premise of such a system, to state that it lacks any historic premise<br/>
&gt; is not only an invalid statement, but shows complete ignorance of belief<br/>
&gt; systems shared by many. The fact that you seem to be stating there is lack of<br/>
&gt; evidence for such a system to exist, as opposed to asking for sources or<br/>
&gt; simply stating you disagree, seems to make it read as though your statements<br/>
&gt; are factual when in actuality they are opinion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A belief doesn&#39;t need to have historial or moral validity to be true. (Nor<br/>
does historical validity make something true.) But you claimed Judie&#39;s did<br/>
have historical and moral validity. So what religions or belief systems is<br/>
it based on?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You asked Judie specifically how far that belief extends? Because although I<br/>
&gt; do not know Judie&#39;s belief specifically, there are those who believe that we<br/>
&gt; are each &quot;God&quot;, or an extension of the &quot;Universal Soul&quot; in which case if that<br/>
&gt; is what Judie believes she then fits your criteria of what predestination is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So this religion or religions you know of believes we&#39;re each God and before<br/>
birth we determine our path on Earth? What religion is that?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The fact that those are scientific terms is also about perspective, along with<br/>
&gt; the separating spirituality from science. Not everyone sees them as separate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, what I&#39;m saying is you can&#39;t stretch the meaning of scientific terms<br/>
beyond their definition and still expect them to have the same worth.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t use the word evidence and fact to mean belief in something and<br/>
then expect it to hold the same power of &quot;proof&quot; as the stricter scientific<br/>
defintions of those words. Soft definitions of evidence and fact will yield<br/>
soft proofs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not everyone believes the same facts or the same evidence, if that were true,<br/>
&gt; no one would wonder if O.J. did it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re confusing evidence and facts with the conclusions based on those.<br/>
Facts are not something one believes or not believes in. They&#39;re bits of<br/>
reality. A fact can be a list from the phone company of phone numbers dialed<br/>
from a particular phone number. It can be the bullet recovered from a body.<br/>
<br/>
Evidence is bits of reality that suggest a conclusion. From the dictionary<br/>
at Lawyers.com: Evidence is &quot;something (as testimony, writings, or objects)<br/>
presented at a judicial or administrative proceeding for the purpose of<br/>
establishing the truth or falsity of an alleged matter of fact.&quot; From the<br/>
facts and evidence, people will identify patterns. Then they will come up<br/>
with a theory (conclusion) that explains why those patterns exist. But a<br/>
good theory has to explain *all* the data, not just the supporting pieces<br/>
someone picks out of it.<br/>
<br/>
In trials it&#39;s expected that theories won&#39;t explain everything and that<br/>
there will be some contradictory evidence. That&#39;s why juries are instructed<br/>
to reach a verdict that is free from *reasonable* doubt.<br/>
<br/>
In science scientists -- and the peers who review their data and theories --<br/>
are well aware of where their theories don&#39;t cover all the data. But they<br/>
can&#39;t throw away data they can&#39;t explain or data that refutes their theory.<br/>
They work to refine their theories with the goal of explaining all the data<br/>
and work on better ways to gather more accurate data so their theory can<br/>
explain it all. They aren&#39;t under the same time constraints that juries are.<br/>
They can spend years gathering data to support or refute a theory.<br/>
<br/>
The things you&#39;re discussing: religion, predestination, astral projection<br/>
are beyond what science can investigate. That doesn&#39;t mean they are untrue.<br/>
It&#39;s just that the words &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;proof&quot; don&#39;t accurately<br/>
describe what people are using to support the theories that these things<br/>
exist.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There would be no need to defend anything<br/>
&gt; if those who were using inapplicable words would be clear about their intent<br/>
&gt; and didn&#39;t seem to intend on offending.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra used the words correctly. She was just asking *where* that belief<br/>
came from. Is it based in some historical religion? Is it totally Judie&#39;s<br/>
idea?<br/>
<br/>
Neither makes an idea more true but a belief system held by millions over<br/>
hundreds of years at least has lots of people examining and experiencing it<br/>
from many perspectives. The parts that conflict with reality are going to<br/>
get weeded out. Most people now adays don&#39;t believe in the Egyptian gods but<br/>
the Egyptian system of belief explained the observations they had of their<br/>
lives in that time and place. It is elaborate beyond their reality --<br/>
nothing told them a god was named Osiris -- but the elaborations didn&#39;t<br/>
conflict with reality -- nothing in reality said it wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
A belief system held by one person only has one person examining it from one<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Something can actually be valid without it being true. As long as it&#39;s<br/>
consistent with a belief system, then something is valid *within that belief<br/>
system*. A schizophrenic&#39;s view of the world is &quot;valid&quot; within themselves<br/>
but they&#39;re residing in a world of people who don&#39;t see what they see.<br/>
<br/>
People can get philosophical about what is reality but if someone sees a<br/>
child being beaten and their &quot;vision of reality&quot; leads them to believe<br/>
that&#39;s the child&#39;s chosen path, then they&#39;re having a negative effect on<br/>
society. Their &quot;valid&quot; belief is harmful to others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ooops, I forgot to reply that while it may not be foundationally known as a<br/>
&gt; part of their belief systems, what I said in my post was that there are<br/>
&gt; &quot;sects&quot; <br/>
&gt; of many religions that do accept predestination as a part of their system.<br/>
&gt; There would be no way to dissect all the religions of the world (or any other<br/>
&gt; ;-) ). There&#39;s something like 40 thousand different sects to Christianity, so<br/>
&gt; who knows what religion solely believes in one way and only one way. Some are<br/>
&gt; far more fundamental than others, but there will always be dissenters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No need to name them all. Just point us towards the ones you know about. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad she held it up to examine it because Judie was here offering advice<br/>
to others. She has a belief system that could justify ignoring the hurt<br/>
someone else is going through. It could justify a mom not changing because<br/>
her child&#39;s pain is the pain the child chose to have.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of conventional parenting practices seem to make sense from an adult<br/>
point of view. But not when we look at them from the child&#39;s understanding<br/>
of the world. If someone&#39;s belief system is that the child chose to be<br/>
dominated by adults, what reason is there to try something better?<br/>

Sandra, I can only compare your attitude towards them as to those who <br/>
come to unschooling with their school thoughts, and start arguing <br/>
against it.<br/>
No one has said compassion is lacking in these beliefs.<br/>
But compassion can be for all.  Yes, even the rapist.<br/>
Just because someone accepts pedestination, doesn&#39;t mean they would <br/>
turn an abused spouse away, or any of the other example you have <br/>
given.  From what I have read of these beliefs,growth of the soul <br/>
happens by learning how to make yourself and the world around you <br/>
better.  <br/>
Unschooling is a truth we have all found.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I believe it was something we all chose before we <br/>
were born.  It&#39;s an interesting thought to me though.<br/>
Sometimes I feel we are on a higher spiritual level than the masses.<br/>
We (unschoolers) see &quot;truth&quot; easier than others.  <br/>
Those are my rambling thoughts at times.  Not a huge belief system. <br/>
There are those who do accpet these thoughts as their truth.  I&#39;ve <br/>
met some (my cousin and others).  They are very compassionate and <br/>
very much into bettering themselves and their world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152406193">The idea that one shouldn&#39;t have to feel sorry for someone who&#39;s been raped <br/>
or otherwise abused because they chose that, and that those who are violent<br/>
are <br/>
doing what they&#39;re SUPPOSED to do is NOT something I had heard, and I&#39;ve <br/>
asked repeatedly for any origin or justification, but am given generalized<br/>
ee i<br/>
defensiveness.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*i think that this is based on the belief that we create our own reality and<br/>
that what our dominant vibration is attracts that into our reality. if you<br/>
are vibrating negatively, you are going to attract into your life negative<br/>
events. you know, the idea that life is a mirror - what you see is a<br/>
reflection of what&#39;s going on inside.<br/>
<br/>
as far as i know, the Bible speaks of contracts and of the power we have to<br/>
create . also, i think that many of the christian mystics had similar<br/>
beliefs, as do the eastern religions. of course, this is based on what i<br/>
have read, and do not consider myself an expert in religion by any means.<br/>
<br/>
you can also find these beliefs in the channelings like for example abraham<br/>
orin and seth. channeling is also not a new age belief either as it is seen<br/>
in the hindu religion and i&#39;m certainly guessing others too. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
on the subject of contracts, you may want to read caroline myss&#39; sacred<br/>
contracts where she gives a fair bit of background about moses, abraham,<br/>
jesus, buddha and mohammed and how they fulfilled their own Divine contracts<br/>
 the notion of contracts is also seen widely in many of the myths.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of beliefs, but some have more validity than others.  If <br/>
someone&#39;s entirely schizophrenic and hears God telling her to kill someone,<br/>
her <br/>
&quot;belief&quot; isn&#39;t as valid as she might like to think.<br/>
<br/>
*i don&#39;t know about this. who is going to determine which belief is more<br/>
valid? how do you know that your belief or my belief is more valid? they<br/>
just are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some people&#39;s &quot;beliefs&quot; seem made up on the spot, or based on a <br/>
misunderstanding of something they think they heard or read.  Spurious. <br/>
Shaky.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*one thing i&#39;ve learned is that unless we are that person walking in their<br/>
shoes we can never know where they come from or why.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001432368">My understanding of this belief is that while some soul may agree to <br/>
undergo something horrible (like being raped), it might be for a &quot;higher <br/>
cause&quot; - to fight the injustice, bring awareness, something like that. <br/>
An example might be John Walsh, who took a personal tragedy and has gone <br/>
from there to help others. Who knows? To oversimplify a belief can water <br/>
it down so much it doesn&#39;t make sense anymore. Dr. Brian Weiss has <br/>
written an interesting book on this - (I think) it&#39;s called &quot;Many Lives, <br/>
Many Masters&quot;. I also don&#39;t think we can really judge or understand, <br/>
from the outside, what another person is going through. We can, however, <br/>
care, help, be there - whatever we have to give, whatever the other <br/>
person needs or can accept. When I was teaching, I interacted with lots <br/>
of teens. A couple of times, kids would come back a few years later to <br/>
thank me for something I did, something that made a difference. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t always such a big thing I did, but it was the right thing at the <br/>
right time. Sometimes it was nothing more than just listening to them. <br/>
Maybe I was just in the right place at the right time. We are in the <br/>
lives of each other for a reason. But we don&#39;t always know what that is, <br/>
sometimes we know, sometimes we know but much later.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I have a great relationship, and it is a second marriage for <br/>
both of us. Our first marriages were pretty awful (but short for both of <br/>
us). I had said the other day, I wish we had met each other first. He <br/>
agreed, but added that maybe having gone through an awful marriage, we <br/>
were better able to appreciate each other. So maybe that horrid first <br/>
marriage had some good to it afterall! Looking back, having left an <br/>
abusive situation and with no home, I had the support of family. Not <br/>
everyone has that, and I am now aware of the issues that face women who <br/>
are in an abusive situation and unlike me, have no where to go. I do <br/>
what I can to help. Did I somehow choose that life lesson? don&#39;t know, <br/>
but I do know I learned a lot, and I hope, am more compassionate because <br/>
of it. And there were people in my life at that time who made such a <br/>
difference, simply by being there. The right words, the right hug, some <br/>
little thing that made a difference.<br/>
<br/>
However, to say that because a soul chose a difficult path, or a <br/>
difficult time, others should not feel compassion is, imho, an incorrect <br/>
understanding of this idea or belief. Of course we should feel <br/>
compassion, of course we should help if we can. Perhaps our compassion <br/>
is the next act, the next necessary thing to change something - how many <br/>
people&#39;s lives has John Walsh touched? Everything is so intricately <br/>
intertwined, who&#39;s to know always the &quot;whats&quot; or &quot;whys&quot;. All we can do <br/>
is our best, and compassion is, to me, always part of our best. Are <br/>
things preordained? We can believe or not, but we can&#39;t know. And, to <br/>
me, it doesn&#39;t really matter. What matters is doing our best, caring <br/>
about each other. Sometimes our best is pretty good, and sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
long ramble..<br/>
(btw, joanna, I liked what you had to say on this topic..  :-).. this <br/>
post, and the previous one esp., and the thoughts on unschooling as a <br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
guess I got a little gabby here.. sorry..<br/>
have a good saturday folks,<br/>
peace,<br/>

inclined to believe the stuff about our vibrations or thoughts or whatever<br/>

and I also think the theory of karma and reincarnation explains why things<br/>
happen at least as well as any other theory.  But that&#39;s not what Judie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069646450">Hi - this is my first post here. I&#39;ve been reading along a few weeks. <br/>
You guys are fascinating! :)<br/>
<br/>
       I felt moved to comment about how illuminating the Beliefs thread is <br/>
becoming, after first striking me as annoying. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
      I perked up when the thread turned toward Joanne&#39;s post about  truly <br/>
personal beliefs applied only in one&#39;s own life, not to opinions (even positive <br/>
ones) about others. <br/>
<br/>
       What I mean is that if a belief is used as a way to decide what others <br/>
should do or to judge others as right or wrong, then it&#39;s not really <br/>
&quot;personal,&quot; at least not in the same sense of beliefs that are really only about my <br/>
own life.  <br/>
<br/>
   To me any truly personal belief in personal choice or self-determination <br/>
-- like unschooling for example -- cannot rest on religious doctrine or <br/>
political proclamations of what all children and parents should believe or do, or <br/>
even what all unschoolers should believe or do. <br/>
<br/>
       I don&#39;t see how there can possibly be true &quot;self-determination&quot; that <br/>
is controlled by anyone other than the self -- not the congregation or support <br/>
group, nor the government or neighborhood, nor anyone else, from <br/>
mothers-in-law to bullies masquerading as friends to criminals like rapists and terrorists. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      And I think I hear many on this list who seem to share a personal <br/>
belief about that. :)  JJ<br/>
<br/>
p.s. I didn&#39;t introduce myself. I am mom of two always-unschooled, extremely <br/>
individual, self-determining children charging through middle childhood with <br/>
gusto. <br/>

That means I think that it is generally wrong - for anybody. It has <br/>
personal application, in that I won&#39;t do it to my kids, but I do think <br/>
it is wrong for others too.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking it is wrong doesn&#39;t mean I necessarily have any intention of <br/>
insisting on anybody else acting on my belief, of course. On the other <br/>
hand, there are some things I think are wrong enough that I&#39;ll try to <br/>
persuade people to come around to seeing it my way and there are other <br/>
beliefs that I hold strongly enough that I want to see them imposed on <br/>
everybody. (Like not blasting their music at high volumes at <br/>

So - I&#39;m clearly not following your point, JJ. The kinds of statements <br/>
I&#39;m thinking of, about unschooling, are not religious or political. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know it all, but I do know this.  There are SOME universal <br/>
truths.  It is a universal truth that human bodies need food.  One can <br/>
say that food is not necessary, that a person can live without food, but <br/>
the reality is--if you don&#39;t get food, you will eventually die.  Water <br/>
is the same thing.  The function of the heart is to move blood through <br/>
the body, the function of the lungs is to populate that blood with <br/>
oxygen, and the function of the breast is to provide Human Milk to the <br/>
human infant and child.  Man can develop and has developed an artifical <br/>
heart and one day they may even have one that allows a person with a bad <br/>
or malformed heart to live a long full life, but I don&#39;t see people <br/>
lining up to get one simply because it MUST be better than the heart <br/>
they were born with, after all it&#39;s more scientific, you can measure how <br/>
often and well it beats, etc.  Regardless of your beliefs, if you <br/>
believe in God, or Budha or in nothing, one cannot deny that breasts <br/>
were MADE to create milk.  Not for sex, not for billboards, not for <br/>
topless dancing.  Therefore it is common sense that regardless of what <br/>
our society says, human milk is the food for humans and that the <br/>
container that comes with human milk should not be hidden away.  Do I <br/>
think women should walk around topless, no, but I also don&#39;t think men <br/>
should walk around topless.  But women should feel free to breastfeed <br/>
their children wherever and however THEY choose to do so and other <br/>
people&#39;s opinion should not come into play at all. <br/>
