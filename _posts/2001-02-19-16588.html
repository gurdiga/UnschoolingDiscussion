might find this interesting. Parent are telling their views<br>about the recent 
ER show that a child died from not being vaccinated.<br><br><br><br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Dear 
 </span></blockquote>PROVE Members,<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As you know, on February 15th, 2001, NBC&#39;s television 
 </span></blockquote>drama ER contained a<br>highly controversial story line about a family who chose 
not to<br>vaccinate<br>their children, and one of the children contracts measles 
and dies from<br>complications while the doctors on the show lash out at the 
mother and<br>categorically deny any risks posed by the 
vaccine.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;NBC&#39;s lack of responsibility, compassion and sensitivity 
 </span></blockquote>about a very real<br>problem is highly disturbing.&nbsp; Measles containing 
vaccines do sometimes<br>injure and kill children.&nbsp; A death or injury from 
a vaccine is just as<br>awful<br>as a death or injury from a 
disease.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Anyone wanting to read some of the MMR vaccine adverse 
 </span></blockquote>event reports can do<br>so at&nbsp;&nbsp; <a rel="nofollow"

 </span></blockquote>across the country are lashing back in their letters to NBC.&nbsp; I 
am<br>forwarding just a small sampling to our readers. As these 
letters<br>demonstrate, parents concerned about vaccine safety are hardly 
the<br>blubbering idiots portrayed by NBC&#39;s ER (which is supported with 
vaccine<br>manufacturers&#39; advertising money).<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Pass this on to 
 </span></blockquote>anyone asking you questions about this latest<br>pharmaceutical stunt so the 
truth can shine.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Also, it is not too late to send your letters to 
 </span></blockquote>NBC.&nbsp; Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nbc.com">www.nbc.com</a>,<br>and on the 
right side there is a scroll box where you can select &quot;your<br>favorite 
show&quot;.&nbsp; Click on &quot;ER&quot; and then scroll to the bottom section<br>entitled 
&quot;Contact Us&quot;, and click on &quot;Email ER&quot;.&nbsp; There is an online form<br>where 
you can let the producers know what you think about this 
episode.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;___________<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I&#39;ve been a faithful ER fan for 
 </span></blockquote>years. It&#39;s the ONLY show I have ever been<br>able to say that about. Last night 
was my last viewing. I was actually<br>watching the show in my daughter&#39;s 
hospital room. She was admitted<br>suffering<br>from yet another side effect 
from one of the horrible treatments she<br>received for her autoimmune disease. 
An autoimmune disease caused by the<br>MMR<br>vaccine. I&#39;m thankful she was so 
sedated from her pain medication that<br>she<br>missed the whole show. We 
usually watch it together.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;I found it sadly ironic that in the 
 </span></blockquote>same show you showed such compassion<br>for the man suffering from lupus, the 
disease that my daughter&#39;s<br>hemotologist believes she is developing. Are you 
even remotely aware of<br>the<br>connection between the vaccine and autoimmune 
diseases? You could have<br>at<br>least had the sensibility to catch that sad 
insult. After your<br>condescending<br>and reprehensible treatment of the 
parents, you cut immediately to a<br>vaccine<br>commercial. You left me spinning 
with nausea. Now I leave your viewing<br>audience.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Shame on 
 </span></blockquote>you.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Sara Smith<br>&gt;__________<br>&gt;As a pediatric physician 
 </span></blockquote>in the alternative health care field, I am<br>becoming increasingly alarmed by 
the growing incidence of chronic,<br>debilitating auto-immune and 
immunodeficiency diseases in my pediatric<br>patients. It is not merely 
coincidental that the disease symptoms<br>presented<br>by these helpless 
children, whose ages vary from six months to seventeen<br>years old, either 
started or became severely aggravated shortly after a<br>vaccination or series 
of vaccinations.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;It is very frustrating, if not infuriating, to 
 </span></blockquote>witness such a biased and<br>obviously unethically promoted view of vaccination 
in a recent ER. You<br>people have not done your homework. If, at a minimum, 
this promotion was<br>a<br>public service message courtesy of a government 
regulatory agency in<br>need of<br>more regulatory control over the lives of its 
people, your message is<br>little<br>more than propaganda for the sake of &quot;the 
end justifies the means&quot;. If,<br>on<br>the other hand, this advertisment was an 
attempt to educate your<br>audience<br>about the benefits of vaccination, your 
message will end up benefiting<br>the<br>pharmaceutical industry far more than 
it will the millions of children<br>who<br>are at high risk for adverse 
reactions and/or long term consequences<br>from<br>our<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;very reckless 
 </span></blockquote>mandated vaccine policy.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;For your information, there is not only 
 </span></blockquote>plenty of measurable scientific<br>evidence to suggest that our reckless vaccine 
policy is dangerous; there<br>also exists a number of ethical premises upon 
which the very notion of<br>health is predicated (such as: &quot;Doctor, do no harm&quot;) 
that lead<br>intelligent<br>people to question whether the application of our 
reckless vaccine<br>policy is<br>flawed.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Without considering or 
 </span></blockquote>weighing the pros and cons of vaccination, one need<br>only understand that the 
fundamental issue of importance in this vaccine<br>controversy is the right of 
consent. You have not only done a disservice<br>to<br>people by insulting our 
collective intelligence with your biased view<br>(and<br>incomplete facts) of 
this controversial medical procedure, you have<br>succeeded in leading us 
further down the slippery slope towards<br>political<br>expedience and moral 
decay by condoning the repression of 
our<br>constitutional<br>freedoms.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;This particular ER program was 
 </span></blockquote>another example of ignorance on display in<br>the media and another reason why 
more and more rational people are<br>turning<br>television off and looking for 
news in other places.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Toni 
 </span></blockquote>Krehel<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;__________<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I am a long time fan of ER but I was 
 </span></blockquote>shocked last night by the inaccuracy<br>of the measles story line. First of all 
to portray the parents in the<br>light<br>that you did is unconscionable. This 
is 2001. Not only do parents have a<br>right to make an informed decision for 
their child it is their<br>responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the people who wrote 
this story&nbsp; have any idea<br>that<br>there are children being injured every 
day in the United States from<br>vaccine<br>reactions. In 1986 Congress passed a 
law to compensate these<br>individuals.<br>This government program has paid out 
over $1 billion to children who<br>have<br>been injured and killed by mandated 
childhood vaccines, including the<br>measles vaccine.&nbsp; To flat out say 
there is no connection between autism<br>and<br>vaccination is a lie and 
disservice to your audience.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;There is evidence and studies are 
 </span></blockquote>ongoing at the National Institutes of<br>Health, the Institute of Medicine and 
the M.I.N.D. Institute to name a<br>few.<br>You have done a great disservice to 
your viewers by presenting such a<br>biased<br>story.&nbsp;&nbsp; About the only 
thing that was accurate were the way doctors<br>treat<br>parents on this issue. 
Many parents are berated by health care providers<br>for<br>exercising their 
informed consent rights on the vaccination issue which<br>pushes parents away 
from their health care providers.&nbsp; I would like to<br>know<br>why your 
producers would think that the life of a child that dies from a<br>disease is 
more valuable than the life of a child who dies<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;or is permanently injured 
 </span></blockquote>by a vaccine?<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;As a viewer I have to wonder who brought this 
 </span></blockquote>storyline to ER. I&#39;m sure it<br>was only a coincidence that the first 
advertisement was for a new<br>childhood<br>vaccine, Prevnar. You sold out and 
you should be ashamed of yourselves.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Kathi 
 </span></blockquote>Williams<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Co-Founder and Director National Vaccine Information Center 
 </span></blockquote>Vienna, VA<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;__________<br>&gt;You&#39;ve gone too far. As a registered

severe peripheral<br>sensory<br>neuron disease because of multiple vaccines 
including: influenza, DPT,<br>hepatitis B and MMR series - mandated as a 
condition for clinical<br>practice -<br>I have a &quot;desk job&quot; which affords me the 
option of working flexible<br>shifts.<br>Uncharacteristically, I was home to see 
the &#39;ER&#39; episode February 8,<br>2001,<br>including previews for February 15th 
promising something outrageous in<br>the<br>way of infectious 
diseases.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;&#39;Lordie, what now?&#39; I pondered. &#39;Small pox?&#39; It was 
 </span></blockquote>obvious that the<br>Vaccine Machine had reached into their deep pockets and 
bought an<br>episode of<br>&#39;ER.&#39; I chose to work my usual preferred evening 
shift and avoid<br>watching<br>the exaggerated infectious disease scenario, to 
miss this episode that<br>promised further insult and condescension to vaccine 
casualties like<br>myself.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;It was my responsibility to do 
 </span></blockquote>professional fee abstraction for the ER at<br>Children&#39;s Hospital of 
Philadelphia in 1997, and for 15 months reviewed<br>an<br>average of 150 
pediatric&#39; ER medical records per day, 5 days a week. I<br>never<br>read of one 
incident of death from wild measles virus presenting to<br>Children&#39;s Hospital 
of Philadelphia&#39;s Emergency Room.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;On the other hand, there were 
 </span></blockquote>countless, daily reminders of the<br>pervasiveness of Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism,<br>Asthma,<br>Diabetes, metabolic and other 
chronic disorders in this generation of<br>vaccine mutated children. Are we 
going to tamper and promote chronic<br>disabling conditions in our society by 
terrifying them with horror<br>stories<br>of infectious disease epidemics when 
we&#39;ve barely shaken hands with<br>human<br>genome prototypes?&nbsp; Your ties to 
your sponsors, the promoters of<br>Prevnar,<br>were shamelessly 
transparent.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;May I suggest, as a way of making amends with the 
 </span></blockquote>increasingly large<br>autoimmunity and otherwise vaccine-injured community - how 
about a story<br>line about Dr. Green&#39;s pathology report, owning up to the fact 
that his<br>malignancy is seeded with SV40? That Dr. Green was one of the 
hundreds<br>of<br>millions of citizens, 100 million in the U.S. alone, infected 
+/- 40<br>years<br>ago from the polio vaccine that was contaminated by Simian 
Virus 40. You<br>might win back a few of us, your Former Fans that you&#39;ve 
offended.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;If it is sensationalism you&#39;re after. Give credit that 
 </span></blockquote>a few of us out here<br>can still appreciate subtlety in ethical 
issues.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Disappointed RN, CPC<br>&gt;_________<br>&gt;I have been 
 </span></blockquote>wondering over the years why ER and other medical shows haven&#39;t<br>gone near 
this issue regarding the vaccination controversy.&nbsp; You have<br>chosen<br>to 
air one side of the controversy.&nbsp; Why not go to the Vaccine 
Adverse<br>Events Reporting System and select 1 of the thousands of reports 
of<br>children<br>who have reacted to a vaccination, been rushed to the ER in 
full blown<br>tonic/clonic seizures, brain swelling, projectile vomiting, edema, 
rash<br>all<br>over the body, fever, etc.&nbsp; Have the ER crew valiantly try 
to save the<br>child<br>but fail.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Then {the doctors would} 
 </span></blockquote>console the parents saying that most children that<br>survive this sort of 
vaccine reaction are left severely damaged and<br>maybe<br>this outcome was best 
for all. And as the parents slowly leave the<br>hospital,<br>Elizabeth Corday 
does a little research and finds that same lot of<br>vaccine<br>given to the 
child that died had 136 other reports of vaccine reactions,<br>of<br>which: 68 
were rushed to the ER, 2 had life threatening conditions, 
19<br>were<br>hospitalized, 1 was immediately and permanently disabled, 19 had 
unknown<br>recovery, 3 had no recovery, and 5 died, and the FDA new this, 
but<br>didn&#39;t<br>recall the vaccine.&nbsp; Then Elizabeth Corday would throw 
down her<br>stethescope<br>in outrage and say &quot;those 
bastards&quot;.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Barabara Loe Fisher of the National Vaccine 
 </span></blockquote>Information Center could be<br>your medical 
consultant/expert.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Michael Framson<br>&gt;__________<br>&gt;I am 
 </span></blockquote>writing to you today because of the ER episode in which a<br>non-vaccinated 
child died on your show.&nbsp; My suggestion to you is that<br>you do<br>your 
homework on vaccines.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;You see, my son is vaccine injured.&nbsp; 
 </span></blockquote>He is one of the victims of<br>vaccination. We should all be allowed to do our 
homework and decide what<br>is<br>best for our children and protect them the 
best way we know how.&nbsp; The<br>way<br>you portrayed the family was wrong. I 
am an educated person from the<br>medical<br>field. The condescending tone you 
used to the family was disgusting.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;My son is severely and 
 </span></blockquote>permanently brain injured. He had many complications<br>following his 
vaccinations.&nbsp; He eventually had an aneurysm rupture in<br>his<br>brain, he 
died three times and was resuscitated, his aneurysm ruptured a<br>2nd<br>time 10 
days later. He was only 4 months old.&nbsp; He was hospitalized for<br>over<br>4 
months and he was not expected to live many, many times during 
this<br>stay.<br>No one can understand the pain that this can cause.&nbsp; Since 
this happened<br>to<br>my son I have done extensive research and have been 
sickened by what I<br>have<br>uncovered.&nbsp; My son will never receive another 
vaccine.&nbsp; I will not play<br>Russian Roulette with his life 
again.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;I suggest that you do your homework, read the package 
 </span></blockquote>inserts, and<br>hopefully you will never need to deal with vaccine injury 
personally.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I also noticed that you ran an ad for Prevnar during this 
 </span></blockquote>show. You can<br>view a 33 page research paper on this which shows all the 
conflicts of<br>interest in getting this vaccine approved. I would be happy to 
supply<br>you<br>with this research paper. It has killed children already. No 
child<br>should be<br>expendable in the name of the public 
good.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;When one child died from getting locked inside a trunk of a 
 </span></blockquote>car the world<br>was mortified and made changes in automobile manufacturing. The 
result<br>was a<br>release latch inside the trunk. One child&#39;s death was one too 
many.&nbsp; Why<br>does this rule not apply to my child?&nbsp; To the millions 
of vaccine<br>injured<br>children?<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Because shows like yours 
 </span></blockquote>mislead people about the truth.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;I am shocked that you would run 
 </span></blockquote>something like this and I am never going to<br>watch your show again. I truly 
believe that you owe the entire vaccine<br>injured community (there are millions 
of them out there) an apology.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Tammy 
 </span></blockquote>Carrington<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;__________<br>&gt;<br>&gt;How much research did the writers 
 </span></blockquote>for this script do on MMR&#39;s &amp; Autism?<br>The actor, Anthony Edwards who 
plays Dr. Mark Green - (CAN - Cure Autism<br>Now<br>Board Member) was he ever 
asked about Autism?&nbsp; Does anyone on one&#39;s<br>staff<br>have a child who has 
suffered from receiving a vaccination or even died<br>from<br>receiving 
one?<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;I have a child who was born without traces of Autism.&nbsp; 
 </span></blockquote>He developed<br>&quot;normally&quot;; however, after receiving his MMR shot at 14-15 
months of age<br>-<br>within a few amount of weeks, he started to lose speech 
and as time went<br>on - he developed Autistic Traits.&nbsp; Fortunately, today 
(3 1/2 years<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;later), he still is weak in the speech area but has 
 </span></blockquote>dramatically improved<br>in other areas due to&nbsp; our intense therapy 
approaches, supplementations,<br>testing, gluten/free - casein/free diet and 
other approaches as well.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;He has had a colonoscopy and an 
 </span></blockquote>endoscopy - he is currently having tests<br>run in Ireland which is a Measles 
Virus Detection Analysis Report.&nbsp; He<br>has<br>had DMSA (heavy metals 
detoxification) treatments to remove the vaccine<br>parts of Mercury that is in 
the MMR shot.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;I understand that TV scripts cover only a short 
 </span></blockquote>version of the truths.<br>However, though my thoughts will more than likely be 
overlooked - I do<br>feel<br>that how one portrayed the family on 
the<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;show which aired (Feb. 15, 2001) regarding MMR vaccination truly did 
 </span></blockquote>an<br>injustice to families regarding their decisions not to vaccinate.&nbsp; 
If<br>one<br>really wants to pass judgement - then I suggest that one does an 
episode<br>on<br>Merck Industries the makers of vaccines and other 
drugs.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Check on the legal levels of Mercury and other toxins that 
 </span></blockquote>go into vaccines<br>(aborted fetus tissue is in some vaccines).<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;I 
 </span></blockquote>assure NBC that the network will be receiving numerous comments regarding<br>the 
airing of ER and MMR-Vaccines. Anthony Edwards - please help to<br>educate<br>in 
this area.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure you are aware of the effects and 
possibilities<br>regarding vaccines.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Though I&#39;m not totally 
 </span></blockquote>against vaccines, I&#39;m against all of the additives<br>that are going into them 
and the increasing amount of vaccines that one<br>feels forced to give to such 
small children.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;To let one know, I felt somewhat offended due to 
 </span></blockquote>one&#39;s true lack of<br>knowledge regarding vaccines - today.&nbsp; The toxin 
levels of heavy metal<br>incased in a vial and injected into an innocent child 
who doesn&#39;t<br>understand<br>what is happening.&nbsp; As days go by this child 
could develop high fevers,<br>seizures, lose speech, or begin living a life of 
dazed looks and<br>withdrawing<br>from the world.&nbsp; This is AUTISM.&nbsp; My 
son lives it and so does his<br>family. We<br>are doing everything in the world 
to make his world a better reality. <br>He<br>will not ever receive another MMR 
vaccine.&nbsp; His levels of MMR in his<br>blood<br>system (Titer&#39;s Test) are 
extremely above normal - meaning that his body<br>had<br>a reaction to that 
vaccine - the tainted MMR shot.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Please ask one&#39;s self this 
 </span></blockquote>question, what if this were my child?&nbsp; What<br>would I do to make a 
difference in his world?&nbsp; Educate people about<br>vaccines<br>and the 
effects that vaccines could cause.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Contact me for info.&nbsp; I 
 </span></blockquote>am an advocate, consultant, and an educator<br>regarding Autism, vaccines, and 
disabilities.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Darlene Carl<br>&gt;__________<br>&gt;Above, the 
 </span></blockquote>preamble says the you value opinion and feedback.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;I would like to 
 </span></blockquote>think that that is not some sort of platitudinous garbage<br>put in as corporate 
weasel-speak.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;No doubt in your intent as executive producer and 
 </span></blockquote>creator of ER - and as a<br>person who can do what you want, was to do your 
paediatrician a favour. <br>The<br>programme, about which I am sure you are 
heartily sick of hearing about,<br>concerns a boy who dies as a result of 
measles, because his mother makes<br>an<br>informed choice not to vaccinate 
him.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;The problem with this program is that it misrespresents the 
 </span></blockquote>truth in two<br>ways.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt; Firstly, to my knowledge there has never 
 </span></blockquote>been a death of a child, by<br>measles, to a parent who has conscientiously 
chosen not to vaccinate. <br>That<br>is borne out by statements issued in the 
past by the FDA and CDC saying<br>that<br>the problem of vaccine uptake has 
nothing to do with choice, but<br>everything<br>to do with delivery of 
service.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;While children who are not vaccinated do get 
 </span></blockquote>measles, recent medical<br>articles facilely suggest&nbsp; that we should not 
have exemptions, because<br>the<br>vaccinated children get it to.&nbsp; What is 
a vaccine supposed to do? <br>Prevent<br>you getting &quot;IT&quot;.&nbsp; So why are 
fully vaccinated children getting measles?<br>Could it perhaps be.... that is 
doesn&#39;t work?<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;In New Zealand, we recently had an interesting 
 </span></blockquote>double lesson.&nbsp; Firstly, a<br>huge measles vaccination campaign using MMR 
to pre-empt a measles<br>outbreak.<br>Of the 150,000 children revaccinated, I 
have documented evidence of 8<br>children who landed up in ICU with 
encephalopathy between 8 - 14 days<br>after<br>the vaccine. One child 
died.&nbsp; Every parent tells me that the medical<br>personnel tested for every 
&quot;OTHER&quot; thing that could have caused<br>encephalopathy and got a 
blank<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sheet.&nbsp; Interestingly, not one child was tested for MMR 
 </span></blockquote>viral<br>encephalopathy.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Such good science - good medicine, don&#39;t 
 </span></blockquote>you think? So naturally, my<br>documented evidence is classified as &quot;anecdotal&quot; 
and proves nothing. <br>Now,<br>why do you think that might be, Mr Wells?&nbsp; 
That is real life - and would<br>portay reality far more accurately than your 
programme.&nbsp; But ER is about<br>glorifying everything medical theory stands 
for, not showing another<br>reality, John,<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;isn&#39;t 
 </span></blockquote>it.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Shortly after this MMR campaign, I got involved with a family 
 </span></blockquote>near me,<br>whose 10 month boy got encephalopathy after MMR, and they did all 
the<br>right<br>things. But did they get a correct diagnosis?&nbsp; No. He was 
misdiagnosed<br>as<br>microcephaly.&nbsp; Fortunately I knew a thing or three, 
and the child, after<br>evaluation by a knowledgeable doctor,was correctly 
diagnosed.&nbsp; Not only<br>that, the child now has government compensation, 
and is state supported.<br>That that child, also subsequently developed 
autism.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;But lets also talk about this measles epidemic that was 
 </span></blockquote>supposed to be<br>forestalled by this campaign - during which some children 
received their<br>third MMR.&nbsp; The Health Department said the campaign 
prevented an<br>estimated<br>90% of cases that COULD HAVE HAPPENED.&nbsp; They 
of course tell the future<br>and<br>have crystal balls which mere mortals 
don&#39;t...&nbsp; But what they don&#39;t tell<br>you, is<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that of the thousands 
 </span></blockquote>of children who did happen to get measles, most were<br>appropriately 
vaccinated, and some had had 3 MMR shots.&nbsp; And that some<br>of<br>the 
children hospitalised had severe measles. What they also don&#39;t tell<br>you<br>is 
that of the unvaccinated pre-school children, very few landed in<br>hospital, 
none had serious complication - and.... wait for it... most of<br>them caught it 
from the vaccinated children. That is actually the most<br>inter<br>esting thing 
about this epidemic - that the early notifications were all<br>in<br>vaccinated 
children.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Right now, we are in the midst of a whooping cough 
 </span></blockquote>epidemic.&nbsp; And guess<br>what.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Nearly all the cases are in 
 </span></blockquote>fully vaccinated children.&nbsp; Who by our<br>regulations, are allowed to stay 
at school, since according to school<br>records, they are protected.&nbsp; This 
situation is compounded, because many<br>cases are diagnosed incorrectly, so 
that these vaccinated infectious<br>children, are erroneously at school with 
whooping cough, because idiotic<br>doctors who believe vaccinated children can&#39;t 
get it, won&#39;t test for it<br>-<br>they just prescribe steroids for 
asthma.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;And these vaccinated infection spreading children, whose 
 </span></blockquote>parents haven&#39;t a<br>clue that they have whooping cough, are spreading it to all 
the other<br>vaccinated - and a few unvaccinated children.&nbsp; The Health 
Department is<br>aware of this.&nbsp; Are they doing anything?&nbsp; Yes, 
Showing an advertisement<br>of a<br>6 month old child with whooping cough and 
saying &quot;Vaccination prevents<br>this...&quot;<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;My hope for you, and

I&nbsp; hope that circumstances in the future will bring<br>home<br>to you the 
reality of what hundreds of thousands of parents in USA

 </span></blockquote>disappointed in the handling of the measles case in last night&#39;s ER<br>episode 
(2/15/2001).&nbsp; It included distortions that can mislead 
the<br>public<br>and, ultimately, affect the health of 
children.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;The incidence of autism as well as other chronic, 
 </span></blockquote>auto-immune diseases<br>(asthma, diabetes, etc.) among children is growing at an 
alarming rate,<br>and<br>coincides with the increase in the number of 
vaccinations routinely<br>given to<br>children.&nbsp; The possible relationship 
between these diseases and various<br>vaccines has been recognized for a 
generation.&nbsp; Some physicians have<br>offered<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the explanation that 
 </span></blockquote>the chemicals included in vaccines tamper with the<br>body&#39;s immune system, both 
suppressing and over-stimulating, until the<br>immune system finally starts 
attacking itself.&nbsp; New vaccines put forth<br>by<br>drug companies are being 
accepted by pediatricians and, in many cases,<br>mandated by state laws, without 
the necessary long-term studies to<br>guarantee<br>safety.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;In 
 </span></blockquote>last night&#39;s episode, the ER doctor dismisses these concerns with<br>statements 
that there is &quot;no relationship&quot; between vaccines and autism,<br>and<br>that 
&quot;vaccines improve the immune system.&quot;&nbsp; Parents who take the time 
to<br>study the risks and benefits, and make their own choice 
against<br>vaccination,<br>rather than leaving it up to the experts, are 
dismissed as &quot;fringe<br>lunatics.&quot;&nbsp; The statistic of &quot;1 in 500 children die 
from measles&quot; does<br>not<br>take into account the previous health of the child, 
management of the<br>disease, other complications, etc.&nbsp; In fact, this type 
of statement is<br>often<br>used by doctors to scare parents who question 
vaccine safety and make<br>them<br>fall into line.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;I would 
 </span></blockquote>encourage you to balance the scales by presenting the other side of<br>the 
issue.&nbsp; You might present an episode where a child dies or 
becomes<br>severely retarded following a vaccination.&nbsp; The parents then 
decide not<br>to<br>give that vaccine to their younger child but are hounded by 
health and<br>child<br>welfare authorities because of state vaccination 
laws.&nbsp; If you want to<br>study<br>some real-life cases for background

child dying of measles.)<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Martha

I&#39;ll ever watch. And,<br>unfortunately, I&#39;ll most likely give up Will and Grace 
as well as the<br>West<br>Wing and Law and Order and Law and Order 
SVU.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;In your thinly disguised propaganda piece for vaccine 
 </span></blockquote>manufacturers ER just<br>goes beyond anything a reasonable, fair-minded 
production should do. You<br>vacated the principle I wrongly believed was one of 
the tenets for ER.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;I have not always agreed with the story lines 
 </span></blockquote>of certain characters and,<br>frankly, this is the last<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;straw.&nbsp; When

that pass, when you have had highly medicated,<br>technical,<br>overly 
complicated births, I&#39;ve let those pass. I mean after all, I<br>expect<br>you to 
portray the allopathic opinion as this is an &quot;ER&quot; docu-drama. 
But<br>the<br>vaccine episode was the end. The only accurate part of this story 
line<br>was<br>the condecension and pretentiousness as well as the 
closemindedness and<br>parroting of the physicians.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;This wasn&#39;t a 
 </span></blockquote>case of strong arguments on both sides where a doctor<br>disagrees with a 
patients desires or doctors differ about treatments --<br>those story lines 
catch you and make you think -- that is one thing I&#39;ve<br>always admired about 
the show, it&#39;s ability to put people between a rock<br>and<br>hard place with no 
definitive answer.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;Not only was the vaccine information presented 
 </span></blockquote>inaccurate and highly<br>inflammatory, but it was<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;delivered so 
 </span></blockquote>condesending and patronizing as to make me feel 
physically<br>ill.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;It only takes a short look to determine that 
 </span></blockquote>physicians are not always<br>correct in what they believe and do -- vaccine 
doses, administration<br>schedules and formulas are as different around the 
globe as the<br>languages<br>and colors of the people who inhabit this planet. 
This is not the<br>proven,<br>safe, effective treatment physicians would have us 
believe it is.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;In addition, your portrayal of this woman as a 
 </span></blockquote>blabbering ninny is<br>uncomprehensible and unforgivable.&nbsp; In the time I 
have been researching<br>this<br>subject and making decisions (going on 11 years 
now), I have found<br>people<br>who opt out of the vaccine roulette game to be 
intelligent, educated and<br>VERY concerned about their children. They know and 
understand concepts<br>and<br>information that would make you shrink and hide in 
the closet. For most<br>of<br>us this has come at a dear 
price.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;For me, my first son became quite ill the day after his 
 </span></blockquote>first shot. I<br>thought he was going to die. From that day, until the time I 
quit doing<br>what<br>our pediatrician told us to do,he was one sick 
child.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;For many of us parents, this can be categorized under the 
 </span></blockquote>heading &quot;More<br>than We Wanted to Know.&quot; I was brought up in a midwestern state 
by a<br>highly-educated mom who was a physical therapist and convinced me 
that<br>any<br>other approach was just quackery. I did not come to CHANGE my 
beliefs<br>easily<br>or quickly. (Which BTW, I think most of us conscientious 
objectors are<br>converts)<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;It was only after much agony and 
 </span></blockquote>strenuous research I discovered the<br>dangers and issues associated with this 
process.&nbsp; (11 years ago there<br>WAS NO<br>internet for us, just a few 
books and a couple of people willing to<br>question<br>this). Just like the 
woman in your story line I was LIED to! I live in<br>Minnesota where it is a 
parents&#39; free choice to opt out of this<br>dangerous<br>and untested practice. 
Guess what?!?!? NO ONE, not one single person<br>advised<br>me I had the right 
to opt out of this. Why would the doctors and others<br>have<br>to lie if this 
was such a great, safe, effective thing?<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;It is this dissociative, 
 </span></blockquote>mechanistic view of the world that causes the<br>problems. I too have been 
patronized by the John Carters, Deb Chens and<br>Cleo<br>Finch&#39;s of the world. 
In most cases I was well into adulthood before<br>these<br>children were out of 
their diapers!<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;In this case, I have a free choice to discontinue

 </span></blockquote>Episode<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Commentary and Letters<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
 </span></blockquote>is perhaps, the most overused cliché in medical television drama.<br>The patient 
lies motionless on a platform in surgery or the emergency<br>room<br>surrounded 
by medical types in high drama. Everyone is racing to<br>resuscitate<br>a 
cardiac arrest.&nbsp; &quot;Clear!&quot; shouts the rescuer.&nbsp; Paddles are 
slapped<br>down on<br>the victim&#39;s chest.&nbsp; The lifeless body arch in 
response to the thumping<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sound of electricity supplied with a jolt.&nbsp; 
 </span></blockquote>The pulse is checked.&nbsp; Nothing.<br>Again, &quot;Clear&quot; is shouted and another 
jolt is hopefully applied, this<br>time<br>with some success. &quot;I&#39;m getting a 
pulse!&quot; shouts a tech or nurse. <br>Cautious<br>sighs of relief are passed 
around to everyone in room, and also to the<br>loved<br>ones observing from a 
distance.&nbsp; Most of the time the viewer can guess<br>whether the patient is 
going to make it or not depending on the context<br>of<br>the 
plot.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On last night&#39;s episode of NBC&#39;s 
 </span></blockquote>ER, this cliché played out again with<br>a handsome blond-hair, blue-eyed, 
nourished, four year old boy with<br>morbid<br>complications from 
measles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mother explains that she intentionally<br>did<br>not 
have her children inoculated out of her concern over possible<br>vaccine<br>side 
effects.&nbsp; Autism is specifically mentioned.&nbsp; The boy gets his 
heart<br>restarted, but he remains unconscious and 
motionless.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Is he ok?&quot; asks the 
 </span></blockquote>frightened mother.&nbsp; &quot;Yea, he&#39;s doing fine,&quot; the<br>doctor sarcastically 
sneers back without looking at her.&nbsp; Portraying the<br>mother as suburban 
and articulate highlights the contempt.&nbsp; This is not<br>white trash 
operating from ignorance.&nbsp; No sir, this is one of those<br>educated<br>moms 
who gets her information on vaccines and autism from questionable<br>sources on 
the Internet and not the family pediatrician. Every word of<br>dialog that 
addresses the mother from that point on is expressed 
with<br>utter<br>contempt.&nbsp; The writers could have added the phrase &quot;you 
stupid,<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;irresponsible twit&quot; to end of every sentence spoken to her.&nbsp; 
 </span></blockquote>The boy dies<br>shortly thereafter. You couldn&#39;t make it any more heavy handed

event.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that this

implication.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mean spiritedness of NBC&#39;s ER 
 </span></blockquote>message can only add heat, not light<br>to the public conversation now going on 
about the safety of vaccines. <br>The<br>desire for parents to make informed 
decisions about their children&#39;s<br>health<br>should be encourage, and not 
vilified with comic book theatrics like 
the<br>ER<br>production.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The autism community

family of an ER writer or<br>producer has an autistic child.&nbsp; It is only a 
matter of time before<br>someone<br>in the family of a programming executive at 
NBC gets autism.&nbsp; And when<br>that<br>happens we suggest that you avoid 
your own spin and theatrical<br>productions;<br>it won&#39;t help you much.&nbsp; We

themselves with disasters like autism or any of the other<br>possible side

Edwards and character Dr. Green, being connected<br>to<br>this production.&nbsp; 
Edwards is a high-profile supporter of autism research<br>and<br>works closely 
with Cure Autism Now (CAN).&nbsp; Often it is asked, &quot;Why<br>didn&#39;t he<br>say 
something to someone about this awful presentation of 
parents<br>concerned<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;about autism?&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Jon Shestack of CAN

participate in that story.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea for

creator of the show and who basically gets to do<br>what<br>he wants. That he 
was influenced by his pediatrician, the American<br>Academy<br>of Pediatricians, 
the National Institute of Child Health, and vaccine<br>manufacturers is possible 
and even likely but totally beyond Tony&#39;s<br>sphere<br>of

TV. ER and those associated with that program should<br>be<br>ashamed of 
themselves. Bought and paid for to the highest bidder. At the<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;very least

who wrote this fiction.<br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Hollywood

character the story is based in part, on someone who is<br>not<br>even 
autistic!&nbsp; Now tonight Hollywood does it again, this time 
serving<br>as<br>the mouthpiece of the vaccine manufacturers and their cronies 
in the<br>public<br>health department telling us about autism and MMR, nothing
