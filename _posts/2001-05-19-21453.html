<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503456495">BlankHi All<br/>
<br/>
Someone pointed me to this list of skills to be mastered by 2, 3 and 4 year olds. I would love to hear other people&#39;s opinion on it. Personally I think the Phonics, Writing and ARithmetic skills lists are a bit too advanced for my liking. My almost four year old is not even close to mastering it.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the lists<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997639086">I don&#39;t think these lists were meant to be absolutes.  Two of my <br/>
children have &quot;met&quot; these goals, one is too young (just 2) though <br/>
probably not far off from meeting the two year list, and one who was <br/>
a &quot;late bloomer&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
With any list you will have to take into account the maturity level <br/>
(and I don&#39;t mean this snidely), hand/eye coordination level, and <br/>
physical maturity of each individual child.  Some kids are late <br/>
walkers (or the reverse), some kids are late talkers (or the <br/>
reverse), and some kids just don&#39;t work on the same schedule as your <br/>
average list of base &quot;norms.&quot;  Look at the childhood of such figures <br/>
as Einstein and Thomas Edison.  They were both, without a doubt, <br/>
genuises in their fields but at the same time were late bloomers in <br/>
that their school teachers and others in general considered their <br/>
intelligence to be substandard.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t consider there to be a problem unless you child has met <br/>
NONE of these basic steps by the age of about four or five.  Then I <br/>
would look to see if they have a learning challenge or their learning <br/>
style is conflicting with your method of educating them.<br/>
<br/>
While I know this is a unschooling list and some people are really <br/>
hot for this .... their are children with whom this method/lifestyle <br/>
is not maximumly effective.  A parent may be a complete unschooler in <br/>
approach to life and education, but that does not necessarily follow <br/>
that their child will be.<br/>
<br/>
If you little one is only 4, I would just give them some time.  My <br/>
son was a reluctant reader and it took some real work on both our <br/>
parts to get him past this absolutely necesary hurdle and help him to <br/>
develop the must-have skill of reading.  He enjoys it now, but he <br/>
didn&#39;t when he first started.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone once said &quot;timing is everything&quot; and you can&#39;t &quot;rush the <br/>
cook.&quot;  Same is true with kids, things will eventually click in ... <br/>
but maybe not &quot;on schedule.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348493633">Now that I have more time. Here are my thoughts<br/>
<br/>
I find these skills checklists a little restrictive. In particular <br/>
what&#39;s listed under Phonetics, Writing and Arithmetic. For a child a <br/>
three to be able to count to 50 would mean that child has been taught <br/>
to count to 50 - rote learning. It would only be the exceptional <br/>
child that would have discovered 1 - 50 by himself. Most three to <br/>
four year olds only understand numbers 1 - 5. That&#39;s all they need to <br/>
understand.<br/>
 <br/>
BTW who is Michelle Lewis?? <br/>
 <br/>
The same goes with reading. To be able to recognise letters, they had <br/>
to be taught that. My three-year old has no need to know the letters. <br/>
He is still perfectly happy for me reading to him. Once he shows the <br/>
desire to read to himself - he tells stories at the moment - we will <br/>
move on to phonics.<br/>
 <br/>
I find this list to be very un-unschooling. This list is grounded in <br/>
one school of though, but there are many others. Rudolf Steiner&#39;s <br/>
view on reading and writing is quite different.<br/>
 <br/>
Schooling only starts at age seven - the first year the children <br/>
learn to write - a natural extension of their artistic skills and it <br/>
is only in the second grade - would be age eight - that they start to <br/>
read.<br/>

learning things on your own timetable, not someone elses.  Who cares what<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457610828">I found this under the two year old section<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Holds a crayon correctly when coloring.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sort of hoping Michele Lewis is not on our list, because this is pure<br/>
bs.  I have had 4  2yr olds pass through my home and there&#39;s no way you can<br/>
say a *2* year old needs to be able to do this.  And who gets to define<br/>
correctly?  When in that second year is this a supposed need?  3 days after<br/>
the birthday when they are still babies? OR the day before they turn 3 and<br/>
you&#39;re missing that baby face you knew so well?   We won&#39;t even go into the<br/>
wide maturation differences inherent in boys and girls.  I had one son that<br/>
was a &quot;baby&quot; until shortly after his 4th birthday.  He didn&#39;t lose his baby<br/>
face, nor his baby ways until then.  He wasn&#39;t and isn&#39;t &#39;slow&#39;, he&#39;s just<br/>
himself..  He didn&#39;t speak until 4ish either, and then he spoke in complete,<br/>
complicated sentences.  He hated to color or draw until about the age of 8<br/>
and just last week, at now 11,  he asked me for a drawing class.<br/>
<br/>
I read through the rest of the list and realized that what I disliked most<br/>
about the infomation there was the tone in which things were presented.  I<br/>
offered the children all of these things and more, I just didn&#39;t fret over<br/>
the idea of having them master or prove the skills.  I trusted that they<br/>
would want to write and color and sing and waxh hands and learn to read.  I<br/>
trusted their inate ability to love me and trust me and talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
She also thinks 4 year olds shoud understand the concept of sin and<br/>
forgivness. I know learned adults who disagree on these concepts. I know<br/>
Christians and Jews who hold diametrically opposed definitions of these<br/>
concepts.   4 year olds shouldn&#39;t even know the word sin, IMNSHO.<br/>
<br/>
i didn&#39;t think much of the site to tell you the truth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592751917">Dalene,<br/>
Occasionally I have a 5 minute worry spell( every few months), esp after<br/>
listening to some public school kids talk about what they are learning.  But<br/>
MOST days and Most of the time I am completely confident in unschooling.  Of<br/>
course it does help that my kids love to draw, write, be read to, ask a<br/>
million questions, etc.  I would like to think though that all kids are<br/>
inquisitive in at least one area where you could see that they are learning.<br/>
I can&#39;t know as I have only ever had my own kids.  I think by answering<br/>
their questions all the time, I am encouraging them to ask more.  Does that<br/>
make sense?  Some parents I see do not really answer their kids questions,<br/>
they just blow them off esp. if they don&#39;t know the answer.  In finding the<br/>
answer to one question we often go off on tangents about something related<br/>
by the children&#39;s choice.....<br/>

<br/>
It took no real work on anyone&#39;s part for Kirby and Marty to be reading <br/>
fluently.  What it took was waiting, which is harder for some people than <br/>
hard work!  <br/>
<br/>
If your little one is only four, I&#39;d give him five or six years before <br/>
worrying.  Meantime, fill your house and his life with input of all <br/>
sorts--sound, light, stories, materials for art and science, textures, <br/>
toys... and he will learn.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty enjoyed reading when they first started.  They were calm <br/>
about not reading.  Because they had never been branded failures or &quot;behind&quot; <br/>
they were very matter of fact about needing to ask others (even younger kids) <br/>
to read things when they were playing games or following instructions to make <br/>
something.  They&#39;re still calm now when they help others read, and they&#39;re <br/>
VERY patient with others&#39; learning to spell and write.  Marty was flamed by <br/>
someone online once when he was younger and was spelling horribly.  The guy <br/>
had written something like &quot;You spell like you&#39;ve never been to school&quot; or <br/>
&quot;You spell like a kid&quot; (or both) and Marty showed it to me and laughed.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s nine.  I had thought, in my school-earned prejudice, that because <br/>
she&#39;s a girl she would have read sooner.  Nope.  I&#39;m surprised, but it&#39;s <br/>
nothing to make a big deal about.  She reads easy stuff, and signs, but she <br/>
doesn&#39;t read fluently in all-text situations.  I have no doubt at all that <br/>
she will.  And she&#39;s never cried in frustration about it, nor had anyone <br/>
saying &quot;You should know that word&quot; or any of the things so many of us (and <br/>
some of our kids) went through with reading lessons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737152796">I think this is every mother&#39;s worry -- I imagine I&#39;ll be having these <br/>
thoughts as they go off to college or Spain (I always think Spain sounds <br/>
romantic!).<br/>
<br/>
And this reminds me of the mom I sat next to the other day. She was intent on <br/>
reading/teaching her son how to count from one of those pretty picture books <br/>
with, you know, 1 car, 2 balls, 3 trees, etc.  He was NOT interested.  He <br/>
wanted to play with the pretzels he had brought -- they were these cool <br/>
square/waffle ones.<br/>
<br/>
But she didn&#39;t pick up on his clues.  He couldn&#39;t very well tell her, <br/>
&quot;Mother, at this time, I am going to focus on chewing and playing with these <br/>
pretzels and will address counting later.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a nice mom.  I have talked with her.  She cares.  She&#39;s trying.  But <br/>
she has a set notion of what her son should be doing and that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me (fwiw) like you are doing fine and all of these &quot;academic&quot; <br/>
(coloring is academic?) things will come when they need to.<br/>

We used to play with numbers with kid-food, like cheerios or little crackers. <br/>
Pretzels would be perfect for it.  I would ask the kid for two crackers.  <br/>
&quot;May I have two crackers please?&quot; and if they counted wrong it didn&#39;t matter. <br/>
 Then I&#39;d ask them how many they wanted and they&#39;d say a number (this for <br/>
really little kids who might not yet know number names) and we&#39;d just go back <br/>
and forth until one of us was tired.<br/>
<br/>
Or making patterns with dry food and then eating it.<br/>
Or M&Ms. <br/>
Or carrot sticks.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing how book-worshiping some people are.  I probably used to be <br/>
myself.  I think I gather books because I felt book deprived as a child.  <br/>
Seriously.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792556932">the whole issue of &quot;coloring&quot; really amuses me.  My boyz HATE to color and<br/>
really don&#39;t do much drawing.  Now, in school, this would be a major<br/>
issue, yk?  But in real life, honestly?  I can&#39;t think of the last time I<br/>
colored or drew something that wasn&#39;t prompted by one of them.....lets<br/>
see......two years ago, I colored in a coloring book while sitting bored<br/>
at a bake sale table.......i&#39;ve drawn a few pokeballs for birthday<br/>
decorations.......uh.......i draw diagrams for my composition students on<br/>
occassion to convey a specific concept........uh........when i need things<br/>
drawn, i ask my friend the artist who enjoys doing it.  Guess I&#39;d be a<br/>
preschool failure.  Oh, and I have never ever held my pencil or crayon<br/>
&quot;right&quot;, and it was made veryclear to me that I was doing it wrong many<br/>
times in my childhood, but......well......it hasn&#39;t held me back at<br/>
all.  I have managed to acquire several college degrees and more than<br/>
enough extraneous credits for a PhD, all without much effort, eventhough i<br/>
hold my pencil wrong, don&#39;t spell well, (never use caps if i have a baby<br/>
on my lap), and don&#39;t like to color or draw.<br/>

<br/>
My 7yob reads fluently and doesn&#39;t write a lick.  I mean if you had taken<br/>
all the letters and words he has ever written it would be about as long as<br/>
my first sentence, definitely shorter than this second sentence.<br/>
<br/>
I accept this as normal for him and focus on what he is enthusiastic about.<br/>
 I&#39;m pretty confident that he will grow out of it.  (or learn to type) My<br/>
husband has torturous handwriting.  I know he suffered and struggled in<br/>
school with this.  That helps me understand that pushing my son in this<br/>
area isn&#39;t likely to have a happy outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Schools make kids write so that their learning can be shown on paper,<br/>
collected and batch-processed for grading.  The age that writing is taught<br/>
in schools is probably selected for the school&#39;s convenience, not<br/>
necessarily scheduled at the best age for kids to learn.<br/>
<br/>
End of rant,<br/>

P.S.  My son also almost never draws, which reinforces my belief that<br/>
holding the pencil/crayon is the problem.</div>

Small motor skills.<br/>
<br/>
Large motor skill involves balancing on a beam, balancing on one foot, <br/>
walking in a straight line, picking things up and carrying them, jumping--the <br/>
things most primates can learn to do on their own, but that preschool <br/>
teachers TEACH (and grade).<br/>
<br/>
Small motor skills are taught and graded with the aid of scissors, <br/>
sorting-stuff, glueing crafts junk, working klunky wooden jigsaw puzzles that <br/>
schools pay $15 or $20 apiece for, stacking things up, nesting things.  <br/>
<br/>
Few of us are qualified to develop a curriculum to assure that those skills <br/>
are learned in the proper order and thoroughly within the proper window of <br/>
opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
[Yes, I know this is bullshit, but shhhhhhh.....<br/>
apparently lots of people with Master&#39;s degrees and PhDs think the emperor <br/>
could not have put on those new clothes and walked around without having <br/>
learned small and large motor skills in school.]<br/>

<br/>
AMEN.<br/>
Same with reading.  Kids read in school so they can read the directions, so <br/>
they can do busy work, so they can read-the-chapter-and-answer-the-questions <br/>
and it can be called science or social studies.  It&#39;s gross.  It&#39;s not <br/>
learning so much as it is something time-consuming to do while they&#39;re <br/>
sitting in rows waiting for the bell to ring, so parents can go to work and <br/>
teachers can get paychecks.<br/>
<br/>
If kids were left to learn to read late, teachers would have to really <br/>
communicate with them a lot, and read to them, and tell them how to do <br/>
things.  GROSS (for teachers).<br/>
<br/>
So they are herded through the read-now chute, and those who balk are branded <br/>
&quot;slow&quot; and &quot;non-reader&quot; and eventually a goodly number of them end up held <br/>
back or in special ed, and because of reading.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a horror show paid for by taxpayers.<br/>
<br/>
I was afraid and embarrassed (afraid of in-laws) when my first child wasn&#39;t <br/>
reading at seven, and so he had two and a half reading-sessions (with me) <br/>
which traumatized us both, and I never ever did that again.   Now my in-laws <br/>
are afraid of me, and my two older kids read.  Kirby was nine when it kicked <br/>
in, and I credit Nintendo Power magazine and the player&#39;s guide for Super <br/>
Mario above all else.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was ten, and his epiphany came with the player&#39;s guide to <br/>
Something-of-Fire (he&#39;s not here to ask), which he took apart and put into <br/>
plastic sheet-protectors in an old cloth-covered three ring binder and he <br/>
decorated with markers.  He was totally enamored of that home-bound player&#39;s <br/>
guide and of his map-reading (and eventually word-reading) concerning that <br/>
game.  <br/>
<br/>
Now Kirby and Marty are online for hours most days, doing role-playing games, <br/>
writing in real-time (no edits, no corrections) to people older than they <br/>
are, same age, younger, it doesn&#39;t matter.  What they&#39;re writing is responded <br/>
to by real people, in real time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s COOL!<br/>
<br/>
Holly gets frustrated sometimes and will read to me and spell words she <br/>
doesn&#39;t know, and I&#39;ll tell her why a word is weird or whatever, but she <br/>
loses interest quickly, which is fine.  I think one of these days before long <br/>
it will kick in and she&#39;ll be fluent enough to to notice as she learns other <br/>
stuff gradually and perfects it all.<br/>

  i asked my male college students last year if they liked or disliked or<br/>
  felt neutral about the physical act of writing when they were young.  In<br/>
  each class, only the poet and artist said they felt neutral or positive<br/>
  about it.  All the rest said it was a negative experience and several said<br/>
  that now that no one can MAKE them write, they were failing classes<br/>
  because tehy were NOT taking notes.  They weren&#39;t talking about<br/>
  composing...just the physical act of making marks on paper.<br/>

classes do so intentionally, even if it is on a subconscious level, I<br/>
suspect.  But what message I was getting from them wrt writing is that for<br/>
so many YEARS they had been hounded to write, practice writing, do<br/>
needless writing, made to feel badly if they didn&#39;t do it well, that they<br/>
would rather fail (or risk failing) a college class than take notes now<br/>
that no one is forcing them to write.  They were also jealous that I would<br/>
xrox the math book my son was working out of at the time so he didn&#39;t have<br/>
to recopy problems.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951143736">Hi...<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve learned a little about Waldorf<br/>
education...there is a large Waldorf community near<br/>
me, and I have a number of friends involved in their<br/>
school. I have to ask, though, because I have been<br/>
wondering, based on the little I&#39;ve read, and the<br/>
comments made in your post...(and based on my own<br/>
experience)...what if they express interest and<br/>
ability in learning academics before they are<br/>
&quot;supposed to&quot; at age 7? Would the Waldorf philosophy<br/>
advise discouraging this interest? My first, and<br/>
especially my third sons, seemed to want to things<br/>
like read and write, (and math, in my 5 yr olds case)<br/>
at an early age...without any incentive from me, that<br/>
I can remember. I have just been curious about this. <br/>
<br/>
I have enjoyed some of the gentle parenting methods<br/>
that the Waldorf philosphy espouses, but some is also<br/>
too rigid for me. I am, however, an advocate of the<br/>
&quot;continuum concept&quot; philosophy, which believes that<br/>
children learn by mimicing....and will pick up the<br/>
skills they need when it becomes relavant to them. I<br/>
have to admit, I have occasionally lost my trust in<br/>
that innate ability, but, I&#39;m back to it...ready to<br/>
take that leap of faith into &quot;unscooling&quot;, which is<br/>
why I&#39;m here!<br/>
<br/>
Peace, <br/>
Gina<br/>
