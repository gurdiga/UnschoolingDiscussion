<div id="ygrps-yiv-205909616">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have recently decided to &quot;home-school&quot; my kids.  I am having a <br/>
difficult time deciding about my curriculum.  I have evaluated the <br/>
unschooling, but I am not sure that I understand it even yet.  It <br/>
seems like a very relaxed home atmosphere, and learning about life <br/>
experiences instead of directly from textbooks.  I think this would <br/>
be a good route to take for my children, I&#39;d like to include some <br/>
Bible study, and allow my oldest child to move at a pace desirable <br/>
for him (he is interested in computers and electronics).  However, <br/>
like I said, I&#39;m not sure I really understand it, and what does the <br/>
law say about this kind of schooling....(ie)what are the &quot;rules&quot;?  I <br/>
see that most people here are from PA?  I am from Arkansas...is there <br/>
anyone else from here that understands our state law on the subject?<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much I read on different types of homeschooling, I <br/>
suppose I&#39;ll just have to grasp it myself to fully understand it, and <br/>
what my obligations and regulations are....I have to keep records and <br/>
such?  Anyone that can help, please feel free....although I must warn <br/>
you, I may drive you crazy until I understand what I am doing  =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
