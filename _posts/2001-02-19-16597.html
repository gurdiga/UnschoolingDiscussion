<div id="ygrps-yiv-321053112">Hey all!  I want to share a NEW situation I was in today and would like <br/>
feedback on how to handle this in the future...I&#39;m very open to any <br/>
ideas...thanks in advance:<br/>
<br/>
My dh, son (1yo) and 3 yo dd were standing in line at a restaurant waiting to <br/>
be seated for lunch.  The door opened and a woman was helping her teenaged <br/>
daughter get in the door -- the daughter had some type of disorder/disease <br/>
that prevented her from walking &quot;normal&quot; and her mouth was sorta tight so <br/>
when she spoke it was obvious somethig was wrong with her.  Needless to say <br/>
my daughter was GAWKING like I&#39;ve never seen her do before.  I glanced in the <br/>
direction of the mom/daughter, smiled and said hello.  I looked at my <br/>
daughter and said &quot;would you like to say &quot;hi&quot; and she sorta hid behind me <br/>
(still gawking) and shook her head no.<br/>
<br/>
When we left the restaurant I explained to my daughter that not all people <br/>
walk and talk like us but they are still like us -- they like to eat out with <br/>
their family, talk with new people, eat fun food, etc.  I guess my question <br/>
is should I do more to get her to stop staring?  I assume this young woman <br/>
was probably used to young children staring but it seems as though she (and <br/>
others) would get tired of it.  I have successfully (I think!) explained <br/>
walkers, cains, and wheelchairs and why people use them and my daughter <br/>
understands and will easily greet people who use them.  This situation was <br/>
very different...I was especially worried because my daughter did NOT ask me <br/>
a ton of questions like normal.  Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m starting to ramble...I just don&#39;t know what I should do (if <br/>
anything) differently the next time something like this takes place.  <br/>
<br/>
Would love to hear what others have to say on this.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55481770">I&#39;ve talked to my kids and said &quot;It would make you feel bad if people just <br/>
stared at you, wouldn&#39;t it?  <br/>
<br/>
Each of these came up as they came up--as we&#39;d see someone who was <br/>
handicapped and they&#39;d ask questions.   The whole etiquette of not pointing <br/>
and not talking loud enough for others to hear you ties in.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine who&#39;s a quadraplegic doesn&#39;t mind if kids ask her why she&#39;s <br/>
in a wheelchair.  She said she&#39;d rather them ask than to just ignore her or <br/>
act really weird.  But then she&#39;s talkative and neither a bitter person, nor <br/>
mean, and she&#39;s able to respond.  Some people can&#39;t carry on a conversation, <br/>
or wouldn&#39;t want to.  It&#39;s hard to guess.<br/>
<br/>
I volunteer information to my kids even when they haven&#39;t notices someone.  I <br/>
pointed out an anacephalic teen or young adult at the hardware store.  They <br/>
were looking at something else.  But I figured to describe the condition and <br/>
tell them they&#39;d see more in their lives (which they have) and to say that <br/>
some babies are born with heads too big, and some with heads too small, and <br/>
that could have happened when I had babies but I was glad it didn&#39;t.  I <br/>
hugged them and made it an opportunity for learning AND reassurance and <br/>
social advisement.<br/>

<br>Well, that&#39;s what I would expect a 3 yo to do. &nbsp;She hasn&#39;t ever seen this 
<br>before. &nbsp;If it was anything new she would gawk. &nbsp;And it&#39;s kind of scary. &nbsp;
<br>Then you had a few good comments for her to store away and now when this 
<br>happens again, with you there to guide her, maybe her composure will be a 
<br>little better. &nbsp;But I think it takes a few times -- thinking here about the 
<br>MANY elderly people we see in wheelchairs and having to ride the motorized 
<br>carts shopping and needing assistance (can you tell I live in Florida?? :) ) 
<br>. &nbsp;At 6 and 7, my 2 kids are pretty unfazed by the whole thing but it was NEW 
<br>at one point and needed to be talked about. &nbsp;I&#39;m sure we will continue to 
<br>fine-tune our manners and widen our worldview as the kids and I see more and 
<br>different kinds of people.

<br/>
Microcephalic.  SORRY.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
We had a neighbor at the old house, before we had kids, and their baby was <br/>
anecephalic--born with just a brainstem, basically.  Poor folks.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a group here of several adults who are all microcephalic and I see <br/>
them being taken out and about a fair amount--to the amusement park and the <br/>
dollar flicks.  So my kids have since had other occasions to see them since <br/>
they saw the first with his family. <br/>

<div><font face="Century Gothic">I&#39;ll take a stab at this one!&nbsp; I have 
health problems which are causing an increased need for me to use a wheelchair 
in my day to day activities.&nbsp; It has been a major hurdle to get used to my 
new abilities (or lack of same).&nbsp; And don&#39;t even get me started on how the 
insurance and medical establishment treats me!&nbsp; But that&#39;s not the 
topic...back to the topic.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">I think you handled it great!&nbsp; You have 
your DD an opportunity to say &#39;hello&#39;, after giving a greeting yourself.&nbsp; 
This is the absolute best example you could have set (IMO).&nbsp; It was 
courteous, but not overbearing, it helped your children know how to act when 
confronted with this situation in the future and was a kind response to the 
other people, showing general courtesy and patience.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">A couple of tips from someone new to using a 
wheelchair.&nbsp; <font face="Century Gothic">For starters, loneliness can be a 
devastating condition to cope with.&nbsp; I have noticed that some people are 
not at all sure how to approach me or whether I want to be bothered by their 
presence.&nbsp; I am sooo appreciative of the people who are able to greet ME, 
rather than worry about my chair.&nbsp; It is physically very difficult for me 
to &#39;work&#39; a room and get around to meet other people.&nbsp; However, that 
doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t want to know them.</font></font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">I know it is frustrating for others who are 
hurrying on their way when they have to wait for me to cross a street or get 
through a doorway.&nbsp; A smile and a small greeting goes a long way to let me 
know not to take it personally.&nbsp; (By the same token, I try to make eye 
contact and greet others when they have wait around for me.)</font></div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">Holding doors open or other small gestures of 
assistance are welcome.&nbsp; At least for me, so are the questions asked by 
young children.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had a couple of situations where the parents were 
mortified because their young child was &#39;getting in my way&#39;.&nbsp; While I 
appreciate their consideration, I also love children and welcome their open 
curiosity.&nbsp; I would rather that the parent get down closer to the child&#39;s 
level and assist the child in talking with me or asking questions outright about 
my chair and/or my circumstances than to have them pulled away and have the 
parents wrestling to keep the young child under control.&nbsp; It amazes me what 
interests the children about my chair...judging from the curiosity of children, 
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve met a lot of budding engineers!&nbsp; Sure, it takes a few extra 
minutes to teach your children, but I think it&#39;s worth it.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">Of&nbsp; course, it would not be appropriate to 
stop every handicapped/blind/less-abled person on the street and burden them 
with a lot of questions!&nbsp; But to take a moment to allow your child to 
become more comfortable with the situation.&nbsp; I say, way to go, 
mom!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">I have an aunt who has down&#39;s syndrome.&nbsp; 
We get some of the same reactions when we are out with her.&nbsp; It is obvious 
she has a disability of some sort and people are not sure how to react, often 
choosing to ignore her/us, rather than be bothered with 
conversation.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">Now I&#39;m starting to ramble and that was not my 
point.&nbsp; I think you did a good job in this situation.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">FWIW,</font></div>

<br/>
Hi --<br/>
<br/>
If you have time, one pleasant way to cover some requirements (for your<br/>
particular district) is to find some good books and read them aloud to him<br/>
while he is resting.  You can find books with a historical setting and<br/>
count this relaxed time as a history &quot;lesson&quot;.  There are also interesting<br/>
books available about nature and science topics.  I retain everything<br/>
better when it&#39;s told like a story, so I assume this works for other<br/>
people, too.  If your time is tight, you could get books on tape and<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; videos from your library.<br/>
<br/>
I like playing games like Yahtzee and computer games if I want to put a<br/>
little math into their schedule.<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, I know this isn&#39;t strictly unschooling.)<br/>

Why not?  If a child enjoys playing a game, and happens to be picking up<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-423635682">For us unschooling is letting go of thinking about things in terms of math,<br/>
or science, or history, or whatever other subject.  This is one of the<br/>
things that makes it so difficult (morally and actually) to fill out<br/>
progress reports for the school system.  When we play a game, it&#39;s only<br/>
because we feel like playing a game.  I can honestly say I never think about<br/>
whether the kids have done enough math this week, or this year, or ever.<br/>
So, from our point of view, it is not &quot;strictly unschooling&quot; to put math<br/>
into our child&#39;s schedule.  For me it would feel like a violation of trust<br/>
to let my child think I am just playing with them, while really I was hoping<br/>
to teach them something without their noticing.  And to combat the inherent<br/>
email communication problems, I&#39;ll just tell you now that I&#39;m not judging<br/>
anyone, I&#39;m just sharing our viewpoint, and what unschooling means to<br/>
s:).  -Rue<br/>

<br/>
We play lots of games that are educational, and we go places where kids learn <br/>
about history.  But if I scheduled a yahtzee game because somewhere I had a <br/>
chart that said &quot;Math, 2/21/2001, 45 minutes&quot; I think I&#39;d be going out of <br/>
bounds (for me) of trusting that learning comes.   But it would be <br/>
reactionary if the kids said &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; and I thought &quot;We could play <br/>
yahtzee&quot; but then checked myself and said &quot;No, that is educational and <br/>
therefor manipulative, so let&#39;s play something which I believe is LESS <br/>
valuable, intellectually.&quot;  Reaction to and avoidance of educational <br/>
activities would be as wrong, to me, as requirement and scheduling of them.<br/>
<br/>
We have Zoombinis and Treasure Math Storm and Holly plays them a fair amount. <br/>
 if she wanted to turn one off and play with a  stuffed animal instead, or <br/>
play a game the skills of which are too easy for her (she still enjoys some <br/>
of the baby games which are not much more than practice with a mouse), I <br/>
won&#39;t look at the clock or say, &quot;Can&#39;t you play Treasure Math Storm maybe <br/>
fifteen more minutes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly and I played Mastermind Jr. for a long time.  This morning <br/>
it was still on the table and her brother played it with her.  Nobody said <br/>
&quot;This is deductive reasoning, an important skill useful in mathematics, <br/>
science, engineering, police work and in critical thinking of all sorts.&quot;  <br/>
It&#39;s Mastermind!  It&#39;s fun!<br/>
