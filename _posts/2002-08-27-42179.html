 Leslie, you are another mother who sees that schools damage children. This<br/>
 list seems to be made up of people who realize that, while the &quot;leaders&quot;<br/>
 seem in denial about it and don&#39;t want us to talk about it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is just too much for me to stomache Ned! Do you think we&#39;re all unaware <br/>
of the damage of school REALLY!! HOLY SH**!!  Why the hell do ya think we are <br/>
unschoolers?<br/>
Of course we&#39;re all completely, totally, 100% aware of the damage schools <br/>
cause. We are all fully aware of politics too. Some of us are politically <br/>
active, others (like myself) are too busy with young at-the-breast babies to <br/>
spend time and energy with that type of activity....and others may not be the <br/>
politically active type. We all contribute in our OWN way!! What a concept!!<br/>
Kind of like respecting our childrens various gifts and talents. We all have <br/>
different things to contribute to unschoolers and the world in general.<br/>
Some speak at conferences and spend oodles of time on frustrating email lists <br/>
to try and help other people.<br/>
Just because being politically active is YOUR  calling does not make the rest <br/>
of us idiots that don&#39;t know what the hell is going on out there.<br/>
Our wish to keep the focus of the list in line with the list OWNER is <br/>
respectful!!!<br/>
Get a load of respect for the purpose of the list, would you!<br/>
<br/>
Ren, fed up and out of patience.</div>
