<div id="ygrps-yiv-803723268">My 12 YOD wants a thesaurus.  I&#39;ve checked Amazon, but find the choices <br/>
a little overwhelming. If you have a favorite edition please let me <br/>
know.  She wants a grown-up version that she can use right up until and <br/>
after she&#39;s a famous author. ;-)  Hardcover is fine.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Roget&#39;s is the classic, but there are also some online ones that make<br/>
following a search thread really fun.<br/>
<br/>
Example the Encarta thesaurus that is part of my Microsoft Outlook Email and<br/>
Word programs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561800186">I have a hardcover Roget&#39;s (I should leave that out sometime...) but it&#39;s not <br/>
the easiest thing in the world to use.   On the other hand, if she&#39;ll like <br/>
browsing and just poking around in it, it can be GREAT, because worlds are <br/>
grouped by similar meanings and it kinda flows from one to another.   <br/>
<br/>
Alphabetical listings, while &quot;easier&quot; aren&#39;t as likely to yield fun surprises <br/>
and ideas that go &quot;ping!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I use anymore is google.   Put the word in and either &quot;thesaurus&quot; or <br/>
&quot;synonyms&quot; but the thing is, synonyms are only single-word options, and a <br/>
thesaurus will have phrases.<br/>
<br/>
If you think she&#39;d be interested, maybe mention, when she gets one, that the <br/>
pile of words isn&#39;t because people just can&#39;t decide what words to chuck out <br/>
of English, but that they&#39;re from different languages and have different <br/>
connotations--do you want to say it nicely or not?   Are you being optimistic or <br/>
not?   What do you want to imply about the thing or the person&#39;s motivations?   <br/>
Maybe because English is such a book-worshipping, written language and <br/>
Brits-proper seem to be be able to speak without moving their lips or their bodies, <br/>
the subtleties of English are in word choice, not so much intonation or gesture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840571918">Thanks for all the suggestions.   I will suggest the online sources to<br/>
Chloe, which I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll use, but she was looking for something to take<br/>
with her in the car, to bed and on trips.  She takes pencil and paper nearly<br/>
everywhere she goes.  <br/>
<br/>
I had been thinking about a Roget&#39;s edition, but there are so many it really<br/>
is overwhelming.  Then I came across this one:<br/>
<br/>
Bartlett&#39;s Roget&#39;s Thesaurus<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316101389/qid=1123947415/sr=2-1/ref=">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316101389/qid=1123947415/sr=2-1/ref=</a><br/>
pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-4170986-3357449<br/>
<br/>
What do you thesaurus connoisseurs think of that one?  It sounds like a good<br/>
one for browsing and pondering.<br/>

<br/>
As long as it&#39;s not in dictionary form any of them will be great for  <br/>
browsing. (It makes it confusing when they have Roget&#39;s in dictionary  <br/>
form since I think Roget&#39;s contribution was to put it in conceptual  <br/>
form.)<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m picking something out I just read through all the reviews at  <br/>
Amazon and that gives a pretty good idea of what&#39;s great and not so  <br/>
great about something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517024523">Sorry to chime in late, but I have to recommend _The Synonym Finder_<br/>
by J.I. Rodale.  I&#39;m a thesaurus hound, and this is BY FAR my<br/>
favorite.  It&#39;s not new, but I think it&#39;s definitely the best.  I<br/>
opened to a random word: intact.  In _The Synonym Finder_, there are<br/>
51 synonyms.  In my only other thesaurus (Roget&#39;s College Thesaurus),<br/>
there are 4.  It&#39;s like this for every word, no matter what other<br/>
thesaurus I use.  <br/>
<br/>
For a poet who finds herself in the throes of writer&#39;s block time and<br/>
again, this has been my savior.  Here&#39;s the Amazon link (though you<br/>
can find them used almost anywhere): <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/c66k6">http://tinyurl.com/c66k6</a>   Lots<br/>
