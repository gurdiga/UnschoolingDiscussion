<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088775707">Thanks, Leslie! I don&#39;t know what our schedule will be, and now mil is po&#39;d<br/>
at us because somehow she thought we&#39;d be there today (but did she call<br/>
earlier to ask? Of course not.) so going off on a jaunt may not be in the<br/>
cards, as much as I&#39;d like to! I&#39;ll keep your address on file, though, in<br/>
case we&#39;d like to meet the breeder. I&#39;m an &#39;86 OSU grad, so I know where all<br/>
these places are. We live in the DFW Metroplex now.<br/>
<br/>
And Sarah: pictures are TOO cute! Kids and dogs included!<br/>

+ Hey, Leslie, do you mind if I ask which town north of Tulsa? For<br/>
+ example, as<br/>
+ I&#39;m wasting away in Bartlesville next weekend at the in-laws, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
+ be close by, would you? Havanese are just the cutest; did you get yours<br/>
+ around there? Just curious...<br/>
<br/>
Karen,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m quite close to Bartlesville--in Skiatook (about 30 minutes south of<br/>
B&#39;ville)--and would love meeting you.  We&#39;ll be around all weekend, I think.<br/>
My phone number is 918-396-0108 (it is long distance from B&#39;ville).  I&#39;m<br/>
trying to make plans with some (mostly) unschooling friends for a small<br/>
party, but not yet sure if we&#39;re going to try to do that New Year&#39;s Eve or<br/>
next weekend, but if you&#39;re here then you&#39;re welcome to come to that, too.<br/>
It&#39;s just 3 other families...  Either way--give me a call!  Beware,<br/>
though....if you meet Sparky in person it will be enough to push you over<br/>
the edge from &quot;considering&quot; into &quot;doing&quot;.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I did get my Havanese here--there is a small family breeder in Broken Arrow<br/>
(Tulsa suburb).  They are homeschoolers, too, in fact....and a<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling friend of mine bought the sibling of the puppy we<br/>
got.  There must be some sort of attraction there...  They don&#39;t have any<br/>
more pups from this litter, but I think they have two females, so may have<br/>
pups again soon-ish.  I know there&#39;s a breeder in Ardmore, too, who says she<br/>
will have pups mid-summer, but those are the only ones I know about in<br/>
Oklahoma so far.  Where do you live, Karen?  I&#39;m *considering* breeding,<br/>
too, but it will be at least 2 years before we had pups....probably more<br/>
like 3 years.<br/>
<br/>
I notice that Sarah said she was going to attach a photo but there was no<br/>
attachment.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because the list doesn&#39;t accept them or<br/>
if she forgot or had a problem, but I&#39;ll try attaching a (small) photo of<br/>
Sparky, too.<br/>
<br/>
I really will try participating in some of the more intellectual<br/>
conversation soon.  :-)  My daughter&#39;s birthday is today and she has 5 girls<br/>
over for a party right now, so I&#39;m a little distracted.  Enjoying the<br/>
conversation here, though....<br/>

<br/>
So Karen, have you been to the Rethinking Education conference then?  Going<br/>
this year?  I&#39;ve been to the last 3 (or 4?) and will be there this fall at<br/>
the cooperative conference.  Perhaps we&#39;ve met?  Anyone else here going to<br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll get my Sparky pictures up there soon and will post when I do.  I&#39;ve got<br/>
some family pictures up on the Internet from our trip to Germany last month.<br/>
You can find them here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://moyertrip.tripod.com">http://moyertrip.tripod.com</a>  Pictures of my<br/>
*family* start on page 2 of the photos.  (The first page is all landscape<br/>
stuff.)  There are links to two of my kids&#39; websites there, too, but Matt is<br/>
re-doing his and it&#39;s mostly empty right now.  He is also working on one for<br/>
his Boy Scout troop here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.troop89.org">http://www.troop89.org</a>  (Sarah C. and I talked a<br/>
bit about our kids&#39; interest in web design, so I thought I&#39;d pass it along.<br/>
And, no, Sarah, Matt doesn&#39;t do the &quot;blogg&quot;--is that what it&#39;s called?--he&#39;s<br/>
not really very verbal--though more so as he gets older--and really prefers<br/>
just the JAVA/HTML end of things.....he created the Flash graphic on the Boy<br/>
Scout site himself.)<br/>
<br/>
That party I mentioned?  It got thrown together late this afternoon and all<br/>
will arrive very soon.  It&#39;s so nice to have &quot;last minute&quot; kinds of<br/>
unschooling friends!!  :-)<br/>
