<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029268262">I apologize for being absent lately. I&#39;ve been trying to get the <br/>
registration page (and a few others) up on the conference website. <br/>
We&#39;re just about there.<br/>
<br/>
I was having computer problems and just got a new laptop (which I&#39;m <br/>
still learning to use!). But in the shuffle, I lost a lot of info. If <br/>
you are planning to put on a funshop, I need to get your information <br/>
again. Unless I received it within the last week or so,  I&#39;ll need the <br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
Your name<br/>
your address and phone number<br/>
a 4-5 line bio<br/>
a photo (sent snail mail to me or scanned and e-mailed)<br/>
title of your funshop(s)<br/>
description of your funshop(s)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also like to know whether there is a certain speaker that you <br/>
REALLY don&#39;t want to miss, so that I can best schedule around that.<br/>
<br/>
I will send you a contract as soon as I have this information from you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so mucjh for your understanding! This is going to be a wonderful <br/>
weekend!<br/>
