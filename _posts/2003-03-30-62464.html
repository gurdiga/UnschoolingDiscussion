 </span></blockquote>A couple of years ago, when we didnt have Internet access, I would go to the <br/>
library to use the Internet.  There was a older gentlemen, probalby 70ish who <br/>
was ALWAYS there..  Every single time we went to the library, there he was, <br/>
engrossed in the Internet.  A few times I was seated right beside of him.  I <br/>
was so curious.. what was this older fella doing online all the time.  He <br/>
was.. &quot;shifty&quot; looking.. ya know?   One day I got a good look at his screen <br/>
one day, and he was in a &quot; girls looking for older men&quot; chat room.  The <br/>
conversation that I read a few lines of was along the lines of: OH <br/>
granddaddy,  Yes yes..Thats it ( blah blah blah, cyber sex lingo).    I was <br/>
so creeped out by that old man sitting there in the freaking library having <br/>
cyber sex.   Ughghg.. There was also a kid around 11 or 12 who would sit <br/>
really close to the screen,  he was in a chat room, and he would type then <br/>
cover the screen up with his hand and look around in a panic.  A couple of <br/>
times I tried to engage him in conversation .. &quot;Hey, whats up, find anything <br/>
interesting?&quot;  He never answered me.. LOL.. They changed the policies at the <br/>
library to no longer allow chat room or IM&#39;s.  Personally, I think stuff like <br/>
that shouldnt be funded by taxpayers dollars.. Yeah, folks have a right to do <br/>
whatever they want to on the Internet, but not on the Govt&#39;s dime.<br/>

Is it not that man&#39;s and that teenage boy&#39;s tax money in use, as equally as <br/>
yours?<br/>
Should your morality prevail over theirs?<br/>

I guess I&#39;m wondering how the funding and morality aspects of it mesh (or <br/>
don&#39;t) in your viewpoint.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Well, I am assuming then, that you feel this kind of stuff is OK in a public <br/>
library.  Perhaps it not as much as &quot;who&quot; is paying for folks to have &quot;free&quot; <br/>
access to pornography, as the fact that I just feel having cyber sex and <br/>
looking at pornography are not what the Internet access is provided for a the <br/>
library.   Actually, there are laws now that prohibit displaying ANY thing <br/>
that can be construted as &quot;offensive&quot; on a &quot;public&quot; computer screen. <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www1.law.ucla.edu/~volokh/harass/cyberspa.htm)">http://www1.law.ucla.edu/~volokh/harass/cyberspa.htm)</a>  If someone can walk <br/>
by and see something on your PC screen and they find it offensive, then you <br/>
can be charged with harrassment.   Yeah, I think that is a bit extreme, but <br/>
it helps keep folks from looking at porn in the library where children should <br/>
not have to walk by and see &quot;Grand Daddy&quot; ooggling some teen chick in the <br/>
raw.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I try to keep my personal feelings separate from my civic <br/>
preferences.  My civic preferences say that so long as someone isn&#39;t <br/>
hurting someone else, their tax dollar is as worthy as mine.  Personal <br/>
feelings are irrelevant in this case.  It has nothing to do with me <br/>
*personally*, but everything to do with what is available in a public <br/>
space.  For instance, I feel upset when I read some textbooks and some <br/>
texts by religious-sounding persons, yet, both are available in <br/>
libraries.  Civically, even though they are offensive to a member of the <br/>
public, they should be there for the people for whom they may serve a <br/>
purpose.  Who am I to say what other people should be able to access?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right, and there are a Whole Bunch of value statements going on <br/>
there.  (It&#39;s time to play, &quot;Spot the Value Statement!&quot;) What one person <br/>
values is not necessarily that of another person, and what is valued by the <br/>
majority is not always best for society as a whole.  This is something <br/>
basic that&#39;s been shown time and again.  That young man mentioned earlier <br/>
is probably from a household where sexual feelings are probably repressed <br/>
and denied, or treated as &#39;naughty&#39;... so, he goes someplace safe to <br/>
explore them and is self-conscious enough to want to keep others from <br/>
prying.  Is it the healthiest thing for him to do?  Who is the person to <br/>
say it is or isn&#39;t for that particular young man?  Whomever says so, then <br/>
becomes responsible for the rest of his development as well, in my <br/>
opinion.  Once you&#39;ve said, &quot;No WAY!&quot;, you&#39;ve taken choice away.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is there really?  How very strange and odd.  How unfortunate.<br/>
...Which means I should hang out by the computers and every time something <br/>
rampantly-pro-war or pro-schoolist shows up on a computer screen, I should <br/>
holler harassment?  What a concept.  (chuckling)  ...new way to protest, <br/>
maybe?  (beg)  (same goes for those on the middle or other side of the <br/>
fence on ANY issue!!!)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really, your libraries on-line computers are in the children&#39;s <br/>
section?  Ours are up on the second floor, facing each other and near the <br/>
adult-level-books-on-tape.  (and that law seems a touch extreme to me <br/>
too...)  There&#39;s also a request that parents stay with their younger <br/>
children.  Most folks seem to.<br/>
<br/>
well, so far somebody&#39;s challenged my civic beliefs, but nobody&#39;s explained <br/>
to me why *they* think/feel it&#39;s okay to take computer-choice away from our <br/>
kids/us (ie, no IM or chat rooms and/or always-on filtering software), in a <br/>
public library, paid for by our tax dollars.  I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a true <br/>
right or wrong, but nothing convincing&#39;s come up so far.<br/>
...but maybe I&#39;m just cranky that way...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And when we give people the power to control and stop the things *we* think<br/>
are bad we give people the power to control and stop the things *others*<br/>
think are bad -- which might be things we think are good.<br/>
<br/>
It seems obvious that the KKK shouldn&#39;t march in public parades. But the<br/>
reasoning that allows them to stop the KKK would allow communities to stop<br/>
gay rights activists, Mormons, maybe even unschoolers from marching.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not comfortable with allowing the KKK to march, but I&#39;m *really*<br/>
uncomfortable with the thought of giving someone the ability to decide the<br/>
things I think are right are offensive enough to be removed from the public<br/>
eye.</div>
