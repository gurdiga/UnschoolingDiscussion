 <br/>
I have a question for you.<br/>
If one came across something scary (I don&#39;t know what... a photo of someone <br/>
having sex with a donkey?--example I read about in an article last week)  and <br/>
if they came to wake you up, what would you do?<br/>
<br/>
Would the child be in trouble?<br/>
Would you take away computer access after that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Without that answer I can&#39;t procede with my sterling advice. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988873109">My two children are 7 and 4 and have all the access they can do by themselves right now unsupervised.  I would just make sure your child knows not to give their name or location out to anyone and let them go.  When they get older and stay up later than me on the computer I&#39;m pretty sure they will ask me questions about anything weird they might come across.  I hope this helps you a little.<br/>

&gt; If one came across something scary (I don&#39;t know what... a photo <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; having sex with a donkey?--example I read about in an article last <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; if they came to wake you up, what would you do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Talk about it, I guess?  Seeing an image like that would really <br/>
bother me, and I&#39;m an adult, so I can&#39;t help but wonder how it would <br/>
affect a young child and their future sexuality to see such things <br/>
either inadvertently or not.<br/>
Here&#39;s a real life example I can give you.<br/>
My youngest brother (my children&#39;s uncle) has many tattoos. My 9yo <br/>
is fascinated with this, and after a recent visit with my brother he <br/>
wanted me to help him find some tattoo websites so he could look at <br/>
different unique tattoos out there.  As I was helping him I saw that <br/>
it was easily a segue into some pornographic body piercing stuff <br/>
complete with sadistic images.  That&#39;s how the internet goes with <br/>
one thing leading to another, oftentimes accidentally.   In that <br/>
sense the internet manages to strew some of the most perverse things <br/>
out there for our children.<br/>
People magazine had an article recently about children and internet <br/>
pornography, and apparently there are people who actively lure <br/>
children to pornographic websites by consciously misspelling <br/>
commonly searched names- for example bobthebiulder.com.  <br/>
 <br/>
So no, they wouldn&#39;t be in trouble.  But as of right now, I do like <br/>
to be present when one of them is online (remember my kids are under <br/>
11).  When I was present and involved with the tattoo searching I <br/>
could steer him away from questionable sites.  So far my presence <br/>
hasn&#39;t been much of an issue since we live in a little house, but my <br/>
11yo is really wanting internet access in his own bedroom of our new <br/>
home.  <br/>

<br/>
I read that.  But the solution of the family being quoted near the end was to <br/>
put the computer in the kitchen (or whichever public room, I forget) so the <br/>
kid was next to his mom.<br/>
<br/>
This is the electronic version of making boys sleep with their hands outside <br/>
the covers.<br/>
People used to tuck their kids in, literally---stick the covers under the <br/>
sides of the bed.  And boys were made to have their hands outside the covers in <br/>
lots of families so they couldn&#39;t touch themselves at night.    <br/>
<br/>
-=-So no, they wouldn&#39;t be in trouble. -=-<br/>
<br/>
They need to know that, I think.<br/>
If a child is afraid to tell a mom that he found something weird or creepy, <br/>
he will keep it to himself.   He will be alone with his weird and creepy <br/>
discovery and will have to try to make sense of it in some kid-way.  That&#39;s weirder <br/>
and creepier to me than any porn.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of families will reject a child nineteen ways if he admits to having <br/>
seen porn.  That teaches him to lie.  And once he&#39;s doing it secretly, why stop <br/>
at what&#39;s not too creepy?  If he can&#39;t talk to his mom about it, who WILL he <br/>
talk to?<br/>
<br/>
So I think being casual about it is safer and better than electrifying it <br/>
with all kinds of danger and import.<br/>
<br/>
I was opening e-mail one day and opened one that goes around, same text, <br/>
invitation to a website.   They put different subject lines on it, though, and I <br/>
can&#39;t just delete e-mail I don&#39;t recognize, because very often it&#39;s requests <br/>
for help from homeschoolers and they put subject lines exactly like this:<br/>
Hi<br/>
or<br/>
My friend said to write to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So rather than throw homeschool info requests away, I open stuff that&#39;s <br/>
usually crap and sometimes homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So I opened this one and it started off &quot;Hi, my name&#39;s Tiffany.  My friend <br/>
said you were really cool and...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of my kids were in the room.  I said right out loud, &quot;WHAT!?  I need <br/>
to write back to her and say &#39;Your name isn&#39;t Tiffany, it&#39;s JENNIFER.  You&#39;ve <br/>
written to me lots of times before, and your name is NOT Tiffany.&#39;&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
They just laughed because they&#39;ve gotten those e-mails too.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
they&#39;ve looked at the site. <br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty have looked at some stuff that they&#39;ve gotten to through <br/>
particular interests.  Fan art stuff, some other stuff.   I&#39;d rather know and <br/>
advise them on not thinking that&#39;s normal sex, and they laugh and say &quot;we know&quot; <br/>
than to have them being sneaky and me being mean or judgmental or anything less <br/>
than matter-of-fact.<br/>
<br/>
Matter of fact, there&#39;s been porn of one sort or another around forever.   <br/>
The humorous  bit about &quot;do you want to come up and see my etchings?&quot; is a <br/>
reference to that.  <br/>
<br/>
When we signed Holly online and were honest about her age, she couldn&#39;t even <br/>
access her own webpage.   We took the age restriction off, and she goes to  My <br/>
Little Pony sites, Neopets, movie schedules, but mostly she plays solitaire <br/>
and uses instant message.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My 4 yro son accidentally stumbled upon a pornographic site.  He was using <br/>
the pull down menu and someone at my house the night before had been looking <br/>
at some.  I just pulled it back down and got him where he was trying to go and <br/>
never said a word.  He didn&#39;t think anything of it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is one deal I did make with Marty.  One day I came in and the pulldown <br/>
of recent sites was not looking too wholesom, so I asked him to open a bunch of <br/>
Neopets addresses or something each night so the recent trail wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
gross stuff Holly didn&#39;t want to see.    He figured out how to erase the trail, <br/>
and now it slightly grosses me out some mornings to come in and find that there <br/>
is no trail whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
But the thought that Marty looked at something he wants to hide isn&#39;t as <br/>
gross as seeing the names of nasty sites.<br/>
<br/>
One morning last week I joked with him that I was having to put in all my <br/>
regular sites again because the trail was erased and I looked at him over my <br/>
glasses in a humorous way.  He looked really embarrassed and said &quot;I went to a <br/>
cheat code site for (some new x-box game I forget the name) and I&#39;m always saying <br/>
I&#39;ll never use cheat codes and I was afraid the other guys would see it.&quot;  <br/>
And he went on to tell me that he was just looking for one piece of information <br/>
and NOT a cheat, but that&#39;s the only place he could find it, and he just <br/>
didn&#39;t want them to come across it and razz him.<br/>

It sounds like you are trying to protect your children.  I think keeping my children safe is one of my most important functions as a mom.  But I&#39;m going about that task a little differently than you are.  I don&#39;t try to steer my kids away from stuff--that feels like I&#39;m trying to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist.  I want my kids to learn what their comfort level is and listen to themselves--their own feelings about things.  Not just pornography, but violence in movies, being around other people, all sorts of things.  I&#39;m not going to be around them every second of the day, and I expect them to slowly but surely assume responsibility for keeping themselves safe.  I have a daughter that refuses to watch &quot;tear-jerker&quot; type movies because she doesn&#39;t like that feeling.  My kids (11ds, 9dd) know what pornagraphy is and they know they don&#39;t want to look at it (this year, at least).  They figured out what spam looked like (all spam) and learned how to either avoid it or delete it without looking at it.   Partly because I know they don&#39;t want to see porn and warned them about it.   I think a lot of what was posted about violence in movies applies to the porn issue.  Deirdre<br/>

<br/>
I agree.  My mother is a worrier, squeamish, afraid of death.  I am not.  As<br/>
a kid, we were shielded from all sorts of things in the name of Christianity<br/>
(Jesus wouldn&#39;t approve sort of thing.  It&#39;s not a worthy activity, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Well, I love crime fiction.  Patricia Cornwell with her vivid descriptions<br/>
of decaying corpses, serial killers on the loose, violence, etc.  To meet me<br/>
in person, you&#39;d never know - I&#39;m quiet, relatively shy in crowds, etc.  But<br/>
that sort of thing has always fascinated me.  I always watched TV crime<br/>
dramas when I&#39;d go babysitting, after the kids were asleep, because I&#39;d<br/>
never be allowed to at home.  Today, CSI, Law and Order SVU, Cold Case, etc.<br/>
are some of my favorite shows, in addition to things like medical dramas<br/>
(ER, Chicago Hope when it was on, etc).<br/>
<br/>
As a kid I did get to read mysteries, but they were watered down kid<br/>
versions.<br/>
<br/>
And just because I like crime fiction doesn&#39;t mean I like crime in real<br/>
life.  The main reason I didn&#39;t go into forensic pathology was 1) the smell<br/>
and 2) I couldn&#39;t stand seeing in person the horror inflicted upon a human<br/>
being by another - in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Reading is an escape.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147944540">I&#39;ve been struggling for a few days to figure out what I want to say <br/>
about these various interconnected threads.  There&#39;s been a lot of <br/>
discussion about why some issues are more charged for some people <br/>
(familial history of alcohol and drug abuse for example) and how to not <br/>
make something charged by not restricting it.  It seems to me that not <br/>
restricting access to porn or alcohol is not about getting the desired <br/>
result of said item having no charge.  It&#39;s about really being <br/>
respectful of a family members&#39; interests and wants.  It&#39;s difficult for <br/>
all of us to get past our own fears (rational or not), but I don&#39;t think <br/>
you decide how to handle any given issue based on your family history.  <br/>
Either you respect your child&#39;s autonomy or you don&#39;t.  Certainly your <br/>
experience would be part of the information that you share with your <br/>
kids. But after that what? <br/>

&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t think <br/>
<br/>
you decide how to handle any given issue based on your family history.  <br/>
<br/>
Either you respect your child&#39;s autonomy or you don&#39;t.  Certainly your <br/>
<br/>
experience would be part of the information that you share with your <br/>
<br/>
kids. But after that what?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After that, I&#39;d let them drink if they wanted to, within reason.  That means <br/>
if Kirby started going through the liquor a bottle a week (we have dusty <br/>
various-things in a cabinet in the back), I&#39;d maybe start worrying about it pretty <br/>
hard. <br/>
<br/>
But honestly, those bottles aren&#39;t hidden and they&#39;re all dusty.  Several <br/>
gallons of stuff altogether.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had pear cider and beer and such easier, softer things here and the <br/>
kids have never asked for any.  I got hard cider in a restaurant one night.  <br/>
Marty and Holly tasted it but declared it disgusting.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who has been mugged or raped will probably give different advice and <br/>
vibes to their kids about going out at night or whatever triggers their <br/>
memories.  That&#39;s just how it goes.  And maybe learning from other people&#39;s mistakes <br/>
and having a checklist of things to have/do/take/consider even though the <br/>
problem hasn&#39;t happened to that person isn&#39;t a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
We went out of town the other day, overnight, three of us.    I insisted on <br/>
taking extra keys for the car because I have been locked out of a car before.  <br/>
Keith and I take a flyswatter camping, always, because we&#39;ve had wasps in <br/>
tents before.  So our kids just think extra keys and flyswatters are the way it <br/>
goes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  It seems to me that not <br/>
<br/>
restricting access to porn or alcohol is not about getting the desired <br/>
<br/>
result of said item having no charge.  It&#39;s about really being <br/>
<br/>
respectful of a family members&#39; interests and wants.-=-<br/>
<br/>
At a philosophical level is it. At a practical behavioral conditioning level, <br/>
it&#39;s news to people who are just considering really THINKING about parenting <br/>
instead of just limiting things as the handout the teacher sent home said to, <br/>
or as that article in Parent/Parents/Parenting magazine said to, or as their <br/>
parents did.   The justification that goes with those things is too often <br/>
simple-minded, untested or just plain fallacious.<br/>
<br/>
If we go by principles without details and say &quot;respect your child&#39;s decisons <br/>
and preferences,&quot; people will say &quot;We all decided to together at our house <br/>
that video games will be turned off after one hour, television is only watched <br/>
after 7:00 p.m. and bedtime is at 9:30.  Our children helped us decide this, <br/>
and preferred it to no TV or videos whatsoever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Respect as a large spectrum and some people are thrilled they even thought to <br/>
include their children in a decision.  Big step for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329876572">Last year my then 8 y.o. ds stumbled upon porn while looking for anime<br/>
websites (I had told him he would probably like other anime movies since<br/>
he was into Pokemon and Yu Gi Oh).  A couple weeks later I noticed that<br/>
when I would walk into the kitchen (where the computer was) latish at<br/>
night he would turn the computer off suddenly.  This happened a couple<br/>
times.  I checked the history and he was doing searches for things like<br/>
woman sucking man&#39;s penis, boobs, woman having sex with man, etc.  I<br/>
felt like I had exposed him to something inappropriate.  I had a very<br/>
calm conversation about it with him where I said that it was normal and<br/>
natural to want to look at porn but that it was really meant for older<br/>
people.  Inside I was a little freaked though.  My husband talked to him<br/>
and told him that if he wanted to look at it anymore, that he would look<br/>
at it with him so that he could help him understand it.  The next couple<br/>
weeks, I checked periodically and he was still doing the same searches.<br/>
So I put Cyber Sitter on all the computers.<br/>
I guess I&#39;m afraid.  My mom is a sex addict who left my dad to have sex<br/>
with lots of people, and attended Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous.  My<br/>
son&#39;s biological father is also a sex addict who is obsessed with porn.<br/>
Both these people were also drug addicts.  I know that porn can be<br/>
addictive and can ruin relationships (had nothing to do with the ruin of<br/>
ours since we were together all of two weeks).  I know that some girls<br/>
can&#39;t handle being with men who enjoy porn because they feel competitive<br/>
about it.  I personally don&#39;t have issues with porn and have enjoyed it<br/>
at different times in my life.  But it freaked me out to think of my 8<br/>
y.o. looking at it.<br/>
So what do you think?  Was it stupid to put Cyber Sitter on?  Is it<br/>
normal for an 8 y.o. to want to keep looking at it?  If it was just a<br/>
stumbled across it and then went on to something else it wouldn&#39;t be an<br/>
issue, but he felt the need to keep looking and search for more and hide<br/>
it from us.  It worries me.  Addiction runs rampant in my family.  Also<br/>
I teach junior high and the boys who obviously spend time looking at<br/>
porn are little perverts who think/talk about nothing else than female<br/>
body parts and the use of them and can&#39;t seem to think of the girls as<br/>
actual people.  Talk some sense to me someone!!<br/>

I read that.  But the solution of the family being quoted near the end<br/>
was to <br/>
put the computer in the kitchen (or whichever public room, I forget) so<br/>
the <br/>
kid was next to his mom.<br/>
<br/>
This is the electronic version of making boys sleep with their hands<br/>
outside <br/>
the covers.<br/>
People used to tuck their kids in, literally---stick the covers under<br/>
the <br/>
sides of the bed.  And boys were made to have their hands outside the<br/>
covers in <br/>
lots of families so they couldn&#39;t touch themselves at night.    <br/>
<br/>
-=-So no, they wouldn&#39;t be in trouble. -=-<br/>
<br/>
They need to know that, I think.<br/>
If a child is afraid to tell a mom that he found something weird or<br/>
creepy, <br/>
he will keep it to himself.   He will be alone with his weird and creepy<br/>
<br/>
discovery and will have to try to make sense of it in some kid-way.<br/>
That&#39;s weirder <br/>
and creepier to me than any porn.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of families will reject a child nineteen ways if he admits to<br/>
having <br/>
seen porn.  That teaches him to lie.  And once he&#39;s doing it secretly,<br/>
why stop <br/>
at what&#39;s not too creepy?  If he can&#39;t talk to his mom about it, who<br/>
WILL he <br/>
talk to?<br/>
<br/>
So I think being casual about it is safer and better than electrifying<br/>
it <br/>
with all kinds of danger and import.<br/>
<br/>
. <br/>

There are boys who think with their dicks even if they&#39;ve never had porn.<br/>
I taught Jr. High too.  There was no internet porn in those days, nor home <br/>
VCRs yet (just starting to be available, Betamax mostly!), but there were boys <br/>
who were constant streams of sexual innuendo and crass comments.    When I was <br/>
in school myself, there were nasty boys, encouraged byother boys, to never <br/>
shut up about it.<br/>

I have to come back to this.  It bothers me to think that you&#39;re labelling <br/>
data to support your argument.<br/>
<br/>
-=-the differences between the &quot;normal&quot; thoughts and actions and the<br/>
porn-influenced ones are huge and glaringly obvious. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think when you see an obvious interest you say &quot;must be porn influenced.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty went to a Junior Police Academy.  He did really well.  After the <br/>
closing ceremonies, I went to thank one of the directors.  He GUSHED about Marty&#39;s <br/>
behavior and maturity and how pleasant he was to be around.  He said &quot;You can <br/>
all ways tell when a child comes from a home with a lot of rules and <br/>
discipline.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was wrong!! Marty comes from a home with VERY few rules and no discipline <br/>
(in the way he was picturing it, I&#39;m sure).   I kinda laughed and said we <br/>
really didn&#39;t have many rules at all, but it wasn&#39;t the time to spill it all (nor <br/>
could I just agree with him).<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a professional.  He deals with families good and bad.  He works with <br/>
kids at the police academies (kind of summer camps for kids, the city sponsors <br/>
for those who apply and qualify).   He says as a professional that he can always <br/>
tell.<br/>
<br/>
So how could he be that wrong about Marty?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering, if you met Marty in the context of 9th graders (he turned 15 <br/>
in January) whether you would think he couldn&#39;t POSSIBLY have ever seen porn, <br/>
because he&#39;s so respectful of girls and so non pervert-like?<br/>

I am not at all anti-porn.  But I know it can be destructive.  I guess<br/>
the key word there is *can* be, it doesn&#39;t have to be.  But sex has been<br/>
used in many destructive ways in my family.  My 13 y.o., who is not mine<br/>
biologically, is not interested in porn yet.  Buy my 8 y.o. little boy<br/>
was, maybe still is.  It&#39;s very scary to me.  I have similar fears about<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suspect it&#39;s the other way around. Porn isn&#39;t causing the behavior. Their<br/>
biochemistries are causing them to be more interested in sex. And one outlet<br/>
for their particular body chemistry is looking at porn.<br/>
<br/>
(There may be kids with homelife problems too who lack the connections they<br/>
need with others and since sex (and pron as an outlet) is a form of<br/>
connection it may be where their needs lead.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a theory that explains more data (that is, what boys do) than the<br/>
theory that porn leads to seeing girls as objects of sex since some boys who<br/>
look at porn don&#39;t do that.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately they&#39;re probably going it alone with no adult to talk to. And<br/>
no one to give them a bigger picture. All they have is each other starting<br/>
from ignorance.<br/>

  if they do, it&#39;s understandable that they don&#39;t show it considering how<br/>
  hostile and competitive the school environment might be.)<br/>
<br/>
  It does feel surprising that an 8 year old is interested, but overall I<br/>
  would think calmness and seeing if you can understand why he&#39;s<br/>
  interested will be more effective than a strong reaction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-324129562">-=-  I just know that the ones who are obnoxious about their sexuality. . . <br/>
are also into porn. There are most likely those who use porn who do not behave <br/>
that way.<br/>
What causes it then I wonder? -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it has to do with wholeness and self esteem.<br/>
Those who are obsessed with attention-getting about a topic that seems itself <br/>
the ultimate in attention-getting are needy.  <br/>
<br/>
Children who have no void inside them don&#39;t need to fill their void.<br/>
<br/>
Children with a void cram any old crap in there.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids do not tend to be needy of attention or respect or positive <br/>
regard.<br/>
<br/>
A kid whose parents and teachers think he&#39;s irritating and bad might be made <br/>
to feel more soothed and good by porn, or being obnoxious, or cutting his desk <br/>
or his arm.  Why not do what he wants?  People hate him already.<br/>
<br/>
A kid whose parents show him REAL, honest regard and a kid who knows the <br/>
goodness in him because he gets chances to use it in real ways and be recognized <br/>
when he uses it won&#39;t feel that he&#39;ll be MORE real/honest/good if he sees porn <br/>
than if he doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of real people as I&#39;m writing this, and the worst nasty-mouth <br/>
boy we know has the greatest voids in his life.  His dad has been in prison <br/>
nearly all or all his life; his mom had another baby by someone else, and he&#39;s had <br/>
to take care of that boy more often than ANY brother should have to take care <br/>
of a child not much younger than himself, and his mom has a string of loser <br/>
boyfriends.  This is a friend of Marty&#39;s.  He&#39;s been in school and out, but he <br/>
prefers in, because he needs an audience, and he needs the thrill of <br/>
acceptance and rejection.  He needs bustle and input all the time.  They put him on <br/>
ritalin so his grades would be better.  He said it  makes his brain numb.  <br/>
<br/>
He has his dad&#39;s genetics and his mom&#39;s too.  He&#39;s been neglected.  Loved in <br/>
some real ways, but inconsistent ways.  <br/>
<br/>
He needs porn.  But the porn didn&#39;t come first.<br/>
The idea that someone would pay intimate total attention to him is really an <br/>
important fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve written two essays which don&#39;t touch on porn in any way whatsoever, but <br/>
I&#39;m going to list them here for anyone who&#39;s thinking maybe that I&#39;m full of <br/>
nonsense-beans.  I think they&#39;re magic beans, myself.<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps watching porn a lot causes an &quot;over-interest&quot; in sex....or perhaps<br/>
an overly active libido causes a person to be very interested in porn.<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps neither one causes anything and it is a simple correlation.  I&#39;m<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right that I&#39;m over generalizing.  I don&#39;t think a<br/>
&gt; single one of the teens I know has never seen porn.  I just know that<br/>
&gt; the ones who are obnoxious about their sexuality (as in, that&#39;s almost<br/>
&gt; all they ever talk about, other kids ask to be moved away from them so<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t have to hear the constant barrage, etc.) are also into porn.<br/>
&gt; There are most likely those who use porn who do not behave that way.<br/>
&gt; What causes it then I wonder?  Is it the extent maybe?  Those who become<br/>
&gt; absorbed in it and even addicted or obsessed versus those who can use it<br/>
&gt; to enjoy themselves and then forget about it.<br/>
&gt; I am not at all anti-porn.  But I know it can be destructive.  I guess<br/>
&gt; the key word there is *can* be, it doesn&#39;t have to be.  But sex has been<br/>
&gt; used in many destructive ways in my family.  My 13 y.o., who is not mine<br/>
&gt; biologically, is not interested in porn yet.  Buy my 8 y.o. little boy<br/>
&gt; was, maybe still is.  It&#39;s very scary to me.  I have similar fears about<br/>
&gt; drug use since that addiction is also rampant in my family.<br/>

&gt; I agree it is normal for junior age kids to be interested in sexual<br/>
&gt; stuff.  However, those who use porn regularly go far beyond this.<br/>
&gt; ===========<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to come back to this.  It bothers me to think that you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; labelling<br/>
&gt; data to support your argument.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-the differences between the &quot;normal&quot; thoughts and actions and the<br/>
&gt; porn-influenced ones are huge and glaringly obvious. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think when you see an obvious interest you say &quot;must be porn<br/>
&gt; influenced.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Marty went to a Junior Police Academy.  He did really well.  After the<br/>
&gt; closing ceremonies, I went to thank one of the directors.  He GUSHED<br/>
&gt; about Marty&#39;s<br/>
&gt; behavior and maturity and how pleasant he was to be around.  He said<br/>
&gt; &quot;You can<br/>
&gt; all ways tell when a child comes from a home with a lot of rules and<br/>
&gt; discipline.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He was wrong!! Marty comes from a home with VERY few rules and no<br/>
&gt; discipline<br/>
&gt; (in the way he was picturing it, I&#39;m sure).   I kinda laughed and said<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; really didn&#39;t have many rules at all, but it wasn&#39;t the time to spill it<br/>
&gt; all (nor<br/>
&gt; could I just agree with him).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s a professional.  He deals with families good and bad.  He works<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; kids at the police academies (kind of summer camps for kids, the city<br/>
&gt; sponsors<br/>
&gt; for those who apply and qualify).   He says as a professional that he<br/>
&gt; can always<br/>
&gt; tell.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So how could he be that wrong about Marty?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering, if you met Marty in the context of 9th graders (he turned<br/>
&gt; 15<br/>
&gt; in January) whether you would think he couldn&#39;t POSSIBLY have ever seen<br/>
&gt; porn,<br/>
&gt; because he&#39;s so respectful of girls and so non pervert-like?<br/>

Or maybe I need protein.  Probably.  And I&#39;d better get some now, because <br/>
we&#39;re babysitting this afternoon and I will be holding a baby for hours, because <br/>
that&#39;s the way it works with this baby.  <br/>
<br/>
Good to try NOT to have a headache then.<br/>
<br/>
I will let her sleep on me, though, and watch a movie!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something else I think about adults and porn:<br/>
Some people read it or look at it who never have real sex.<br/>
It&#39;s better than nothing.<br/>
Some people read it who DO have real sex, but their husband doesn&#39;t like to <br/>
do the same kinds of things the wife likes to think about.  Sometimes she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want him to, really.<br/>
Some people don&#39;t look at porn and maybe they should, because instead they&#39;re <br/>
out at bars trying to pick up every female.  Better they were home with a six <br/>
pack watching movies, I think.<br/>

I&#39;m a lurker and was planning on staying that way for awhile until I <br/>

my oppinion this time, which is:  I think all of you who keep <br/>
saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;  really do know in your heart what you should <br/>
do, but you want someone to tell you whether you are right or <br/>
wrong.  Because it is often easier to listen and follow others than <br/>
to listen to our own inner conscience. I think if your &quot;gut&quot; <br/>
reaction was to put cybersitter on then that was a good choice for <br/>
you and perhaps you needn&#39;t concern yourself with whether others <br/>
will think you did right.  But, I&#39;m not really trying to criticize.  <br/>
I think it is good learn other people&#39;s views about things, which is <br/>

<br/>

a family&#39;s life could be useful.<br/>

<br/>
People who have lived calm, thoughtful, peaceful lives for years probably <br/>
don&#39;t need to question themselves much at all.  People who are fresh from a <br/>
frustrating few years with school and loud pushy relatives, who were brought up <br/>
with a lot of rules and threats and arbitrary frameworks need to question all of <br/>
that before they can unschool at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a big &quot;Howard Gardner sez...&quot; month.<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences talk about intrapersonal (self <br/>
awareness) and interpersonal intelligences.   Some people have a lot of that, and <br/>
since childhood are reading other people&#39;s subtle clues, being calmly aware of <br/>
their own reactions, analyzing what they could have done better in a situation, <br/>
apeople aren&#39;t as good at that and some are just new to the idea of making <br/>
their own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of the &quot;don&#39;t question&quot; matters of this culture&#39;s past (children should <br/>
been seen but not heard, &quot;because I said so,&quot; etc. ) can be louder in a <br/>
person&#39;s head than her own voice.  In those cases, people need to question <br/>
themselves very much.<br/>
<br/>
It has to do with priorities and principles.  People question themselves in <br/>
light of their principles and priorities.  If it&#39;s high on someone&#39;s personal <br/>
list of priorities &quot;Act without questioning yourself so much,&quot; then she will do <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
For me, being mindful means questioning.<br/>
Yet within that mindfulness you come, with time and experience, to hours or <br/>
days where you act without questioning yourself because you&#39;ve become <br/>
accustomed to doing things in light of your principles.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have thought about the idea of &quot;brainwashing&quot; a lot recently.  <br/>
Mainly because the other day I was talking to my sister about <br/>
unschooling and she said that *I* was brainwashed by all the <br/>
material I&#39;ve been reading (thinking public school is bad and so <br/>
on.)  I disagree with her statement, though.  I think usually one <br/>
has to be psychologically vulnerable to be brainwashed.  Sometimes <br/>
groups can brainwash others using fear or guilt trips, but other <br/>
times there is more of a subtle brainwashing that can happen from <br/>
what we are exposed to throughout our life (such as the idea that <br/>
going to school is the only way to learn). I think learning about <br/>
other peoples perspectives is actually opening my mind rather than <br/>
brainwashing it. I agree that discussion is good as it opens peoples <br/>
minds to new ideas and ways of thinking, but I also think part of <br/>
keeping your mind open is realizing that once you have discussed and <br/>
thought about your choices, it is ultimately *you* who has to decide <br/>
what your going to do and to me that is listening to one&#39;s inner <br/>
conscience.  sometimes that inner voice will take you on new paths <br/>
and sometimes you might end up doing the &quot;conventional&quot; thing.<br/>
These are just my thoughts. <br/>
