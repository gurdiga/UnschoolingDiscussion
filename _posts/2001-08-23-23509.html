<div id="ygrps-yiv-391880229">I was wondering if you get that back to school feeling still?<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to my 11 year old son about back to school feelings.<br/>
We had driven past his old school today, school starts next Monday,<br/>
and I assume the teachers were there early to prepare for the school<br/>
season.<br/>
I felt alot of feelings just watching him gaze.<br/>
<br/>
Guilt was one and relief was another of the many. This back to school<br/>
&quot;feeling&quot; is a real grabber. And I mean it only in the terms of back to<br/>
public school. Who in the world of homeschool would think to put so<br/>
much pressure on children and their parents? Some kids are excited,<br/>
and some kids are really very sad. I thought the sad feelings were<br/>
just something spoiled kids pouted about, but now I think their feelings are <br/>
very<br/>
real. Almost depression like.<br/>
My parents used to say &quot; oh, you will get over it&quot; actually nope I never<br/>
did!<br/>
Feels like the whole world is going to school but us.<br/>
This of course is our first real year, yep, I am apprehensive, because I<br/>
am in charge. The only one I could hold a meeting regarding my sons<br/>
behavior is myself ! yikes. Sure beats those IEP meetings.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I think I am still pretty angry schools are what they are.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know how you feel.  School started here last Monday, and the Sunday before that, Wal-Mart was JAMMED with stressed out moms and jittery kids.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids were amazed that so many kids were buying paper!  hehehe  We picked up the school list for the school they would be attending and read over the supply list out of curiosity.  This last week, we drove by on our way to the Sam Davis Home to take pictures of the corn and there were kids outside running around.  I asked my oldest if he felt sad about not being with them and he said, &quot;No, I just feel sad that they have to go.  Mom?  Can we go to the park and ride bikes and look for bugs?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess he has no feelings about it, since he has never gone, but I found myself looking forward to the start of school.  There are less kids out and it seems the &#39;bullies&#39; are ALL mysteriously gone!  Now the kids can play on the playground and use the pool in our community without a kid twice their age and half their intellect bossing them around...<br/>
<br/>
It also seems that once school starts, we are able to get back on more of a schedule.  It seems everything child-related revolves around school hours anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe I don&#39;t get the same ones you do-but I DO have some back-to-school feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-553958299">I too have school related feelings.....complete and utter relief and joy!!!<br/>
The last couple weeks I have heard both Moms and Dads talking about how they<br/>
can&#39;t wait for the kids to go back to school...this seems to be an accepted<br/>
feeling.  I find it appalling.  There are even many commercials echoing<br/>
this(exploiting this).  It really makes me sick.<br/>
I am so very happy, and feel so very lucky to have my kids with me.  I am glad<br/>
we get to share the journey together.  Don&#39;t get me wrong there are plenty of<br/>
days I&#39;m stressed and need a break from my kids, but that isn&#39;t any different<br/>
than being married.  :)  Seems like a normal part of life...finding the balance.<br/>
<br/>
I also enjoy when all the kids go back and sort of &quot;get out of our way&quot;.  Most<br/>
place we go are more pleasant.<br/>

School doesn&#39;t start back here for another couple of <br/>
weeks, and I can&#39;t wait!  I do have a child who wants <br/>
to go to school, however I cannot make space for such a <br/>
time-consuming hobby in our lives right now ;-)  I am <br/>
expecting some fall-out because one child who my <br/>
children have spent quite a lot of time with this <br/>
Summer dumped my eldest like a hot rock when she went <br/>
back to school last year :-(  And a baby due in a few <br/>
weeks...  complicated times...<br/>
<br/>
No doubt we&#39;ll get through it :-)<br/>

 Otherwise, I love it when school starts also.We took our vacation last year in September. I picked hotels that had indoor pools & we usually had the pool to ourselves.<br/>
 Our community pool closes when school starts!<br/>

<br/>
I have mixed feelings about my relief that some are going back and getting <br/>
out of our house.  There were a few &quot;school kids&quot; who spent a lot of time <br/>
here in the summer, because it was summer, and as school approached they <br/>
intensified their visiting, knowing the days of &quot;no, you can&#39;t go to Kirby <br/>
and Marty&#39;s&quot; were nigh.  So it&#39;s nice for the house to be quieter, but also <br/>
kind of lonely.  <br/>

interest of their children, but children have the right to make decisions in <br/>
their own lives. As Parents we need to have our children look up to us and <br/>
respect us. To see us as examples for them, and to see us as people who love <br/>
them with our whole hearts. Not people who can&#39;t wait until they are gone, <br/>
are too dumb for our children to consider our suggestions, etc.<br/>

I don&#39;t remember what it is for but there is one where the mom is in tears<br/>

  I&#39;m appalled!!! I&#39;ve never seen that commercial!!!!! Then again, we dont&#39; <br/>
  watch much beyond PBS around here. What does it tell our children? It tells <br/>
  them we don&#39;t want them!!! That&#39;s horrible!!! Speaking of messages to our <br/>
  children from TV have you noticed these saturday morning cartoons and <br/>
  afterschool cartoons? They make parents out to be people to disobey, people <br/>
  who dont&#39; know anything, etc. What&#39;s that tell our children? That we DON&#39;T <br/>
  know what&#39;s best for them. Ugggg!!!!!!!!<br/>

thing? i mean i don&#39;t really know many moms right now with kids in school, <br/>
but after a few weeks don&#39;t they start to miss their kids?<br/>
i&#39;m a single at home mom with very little resources for child care for <br/>
anything, and my son doesn&#39;t nap. when i get a few hours to myself anytime my <br/>
first reaction is to say yippee! i certainly wouldn&#39;t say that around my son, <br/>
it&#39;s an internal thing. but i&#39;m always glad to pick him up again, i always <br/>
miss him. i don&#39;t feel guilty for being thrilled to have some &#39;me&#39; time, but <br/>
mine is few and far between.<br/>
i agree that the ads are negative, esp for children who see them. but are <br/>
these parents really glad to ship their kids off for an entire school year or <br/>
does the thrill of freedom fade and it&#39;s just yucky hearing so much of it at <br/>
once?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638632245">Or the Staples &quot;Most Wonderful Time of the Year..&quot;<br/>
Why do people have children and then can&#39;t wait to get rid of them? My<br/>
oldest is seventeen and doesn&#39;t spend a lot of time at home anymore and i<br/>
miss her. I enjoy seeing her become a woman of God and growing up, but I<br/>
will not hurry her and view her leaving as a bittersweet thing, a<br/>
celebration of her adulthood, not my selfish desire to be rid of her.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The commercials are awful!!  Not only the ones about the parents that<br/>
&gt; are thrilled the kids are going back (ie the Staples commercial), but<br/>
&gt; even the clothing ads are bad.  What about the JC Penney ad where a<br/>
&gt; pre-teen girl, dressed in junior slut clothes, asking her mom if she<br/>
&gt; can have a tattoo?  Or the young teen boy wanting to shave his<br/>
&gt; eyebrows?  The girl with half-pink hair?  We have all the latest<br/>
&gt; styles so your kids will fit in.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There was another commercial out earlier in the month (I haven&#39;t seen<br/>
&gt; it recently) with a teen explaining that it&#39;s not what you look like,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s what&#39;s inside that counts.  But she&#39;s going shopping to get all<br/>
&gt; of the latest, coolest stuff, &quot;just in case&quot;.  There was another one<br/>
&gt; with a teen girl trying on all of her newest clothes and admiring<br/>
&gt; herself, and her mom comes in and says, &quot;you&#39;re not going to school<br/>
&gt; like that!&quot; (the girl was wearing hip huggers), so the mom walks up<br/>
&gt; to her and pulls the pants down another inch!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My dh and I were just rolling our eyes.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127125830">&quot; Back to School &quot;  can still turn my stomach into knots!  <br/>
<br/>
This spring a family moved in across the street.  My son made friends<br/>
with their kids, one just older than him, one just younger and both in<br/>
public school.  Another neighbor is a special ed aid at the school.  She<br/>
made a point of telling me she had experience with the older boy and that<br/>
we should &quot;be careful&quot;.  She said he wasn&#39;t very smart, and she was sorry<br/>
to see &quot; that kind of family &quot; move in here.  <br/>
Well, I just love these kids.  But I was talking with the older boy ( ten<br/>
) and he&#39;s worried about going back to school.  He hates it, he knows the<br/>
teachers think he&#39;s stupid .  It breaks my heart to know he has to go. <br/>
What&#39;s going to happen to him? <br/>
I&#39;m not at all happy school is starting again.<br/>

I can see your point-my husband and I have been out one time in the past 2 years without the kids.  I get out one night a month with &#39;the girls&#39; and I am glad for the break!  But these moms that I am talking about had their kids in &quot;moms day out&quot; programs 2-3 days a week since they were 2...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-861708172">I am now reading the book, Affluenza, which looks at over-consumption.  I<br/>
found an interesting quote: <br/>
&quot;He believes that while people are born with intrinsic curiosity,<br/>
self-motivation, and playfulness, too often these qualities are squelched<br/>
by &#39;deadlines, regulations, threats, directives, pressured evaluations<br/>
and imposed goals&#39; that come from external sources of control rather than<br/>
self-motivated choices and goals.&quot; (page 110)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, he goes on to suggest that cold and controlling mothers<br/>
are the source of the problem.  I thought he was describing school!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130848563">I remember having nightmares a few days before school started.  Forgetting <br/>
things, getting lost, completely missing classes for a whole semester.  i <br/>
even had them in college and for a few months after graduating.<br/>
We&#39;re planning on a daytrip on the Friday the kids go back to ps.  We also <br/>
love having places to ourselves.<br/>
my older dds found a website (kiddonet.com) where you can put facial <br/>
expressions and dialouge with comic characters.  they both did one with a <br/>
girl on a scooter being yelled at by a bus driver to get on the bus, the <br/>
girl joyfully rode away yelling i&#39;ll never get on the bus I&#39;m homeschooled! <br/>
Yeah!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The back to school feeling I first thought of was the scared queasy <br/>
&gt;feeling I always got. I can still feel it when I observe most of the town <br/>
&gt;getting ready for school. I am so glad my boys don&#39;t have to feel that <br/>
&gt;helpless feel of no choice.<br/>
&gt;  Otherwise, I love it when school starts also.We took our vacation last <br/>
&gt;year in September. I picked hotels that had indoor pools & we usually had <br/>
&gt;the pool to ourselves.<br/>
&gt;  Our community pool closes when school starts!<br/>
