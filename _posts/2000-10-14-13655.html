<div id="ygrps-yiv-667630815">Hi Marianne,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,  I only have a long day with no planned other contact once or<br/>
twice a week.  I do have my own business but it can&#39;t be done much<br/>
during the day.  We volunteer at an animal shelter once a week (but that<br/>
is mostly for my son).  It&#39;s clear we need to structure time for me<br/>
during the day as well as my son.  I may figure out how I can structure<br/>
more time for my business.  I do have times that I need for day<br/>
appointments and I have a friend who could take him then.  I also enjoy<br/>
doing art which I may provide more time for.<br/>
<br/>
