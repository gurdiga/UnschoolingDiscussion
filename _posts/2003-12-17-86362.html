<div id="ygrps-yiv-2616670">My votes for best unschooling books go to E.Nesbitt for &#39;The Treasure Seekers&#39; and Arthur Ransome for &#39;Swallows and Amazons.&#39; Both kids fiction but will give people a real feel for what unschooling can be, or just what childhood can be, when you give kids their freedom. If I were deschooling, these would be on my must read list.<br/>

These were our family&#39;s inspiration and bane. (I actually wrote a short essay <br/>
about this that appears in Homeschooling the First Year.) I loved the images <br/>
of the kids creating and learning, and we had all of these wonderful ideas of <br/>
Julian writing operas and novels at eight, like Vita and Ishmael in these <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t happen. Apparently Julian didn&#39;t get the memo. He wanted to play with <br/>
his Playstation. <br/>
<br/>
These are really very lovely books, but could be intimidating for new <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

I agree with ya there Tia!<br/>

Maybe one of us will have to write a book about the adventures of our kids<br/>
and their game systems. I should be keeping a journal.  :)<br/>

My kids right now are downstairs figuring out the Bionical game for<br/>

I am sitting alone in my office cracking up.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re absolutely right. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that Ishmael picked his nose in public until he was 17, and <br/>
Vita might have been unable to make a peanut butter sandwich without smearing <br/>
jelly as far as the ceiling. What Nancy failed to portray in the book was <br/>
PERSPECTIVE.<br/>
<br/>
So here you are: Julian, at 14, is taking a difficult college level course at <br/>
Harvard Extension. He makes chain maille, and is a gifted singer. He can talk <br/>
easily and intelligently to adults, and is very kind to small children. He is <br/>
also a very sweet and funny boy.<br/>
<br/>
To put all that in perspective: Julian is math-phobic and doesn&#39;t know the <br/>
multiplication tables. He panics every time he has to write a paper, before he <br/>
settles in and handles it. There are sharp metal rings scattered about my house <br/>
often, and they hurt almost as bad as Legos when you step on them. When he <br/>
has headphones on and sings along with a cd, he is no longer a gifted singer, <br/>
but he&#39;s still loud. He is very wary of age-peers he doesn&#39;t know well, and they <br/>
have to prove themselves before he&#39;ll relax with them. Sometimes he quotes <br/>
Monty Python...at length.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what happened to Vita and Ishmael, and I came up with this: <br/>
The Orfeo Duo - Bio<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808892355">LOL!  Here&#39;s a blurb I worte for my newsletter that may explain why <br/>
unschooling success stories can seem intimadating:<br/>
<br/>
Ordinary People<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re like me, you roll your eyes every time you read about <br/>
another overachieving unschooler. You know the ones. They go to <br/>
Oxford, they start their own successful business, write their first <br/>
novel at 16 or travel to cool places. Where do they get these people? <br/>
The unschoolers you know are all so ordinary- maybe. <br/>
<br/>
As a long time unschooler, I&#39;ve watched many of the unschooled kids I <br/>
know grow to be adults. As they mature they all seem to become <br/>
overachievers. Is it because they&#39;re extraordinary people? I don&#39;t <br/>
think so. They are just the same as everyone else. The difference is <br/>
that they have been allowed to lead extraordinary lives. <br/>
<br/>
As these kids follow their interests and their passions, they take <br/>
their activities to new levels. They enjoy the freedom and the <br/>
support that so few young people in our culture are allowed. Most of <br/>
these kids will never make headlines or have books written about them <br/>
but they all seem to be moving ahead and enjoying their work to the <br/>
fullest even in the simplest pursuits. <br/>
<br/>
That is exactly what I had hoped for my children&#39;s education and I am <br/>
not disappointed. Unschooling works.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps.  But as a brand new homeschooler who didn&#39;t<br/>
have internet back in the early 1990s, I had to rely<br/>
on whatever I found at the public library.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt, the Moores, and Nancy Wallace were the only<br/>
books I could find at all.  <br/>
<br/>
I never expected my children to turn out like Vita and<br/>
Ishmael.  I did expect to be able to remove artificial<br/>
boundaries set by the school system and give them<br/>
freedom to become whatever they really desired.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been disappointed either.  My daughter is an<br/>
artist, my son loves cooking and building and painting<br/>
his LOTR figures.  My youngest is majoring in<br/>
cartoons, especially Ed Edd and Eddie.<br/>
<br/>
I guess Nancy Wallace just made me realize the<br/>
potential of homeschooling.  I re-read her books every<br/>
year or two to remind myself of that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting the link to Vita and Ishmael&#39;s bio.<br/>
 I&#39;m glad to see they are successful and enjoying the<br/>
things they love the most.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>David Albert&#39;s writings about his children intimidated me at first too.  They <br/>
seemed too super-achievement oriented for what we were doing all day - <br/>
playing with blocks, gluing, pushing around glitter piles with bulldozers.  Now I <br/>
can see that my children are extraordinary too, just in different ways.  I think <br/>
all children can achieve, succeed and be happy if they are so allowed.<br/>
<br/>
As a frightened and self-doubting unschooler, though, some of these stories <br/>
can be intimidating.<br/>
