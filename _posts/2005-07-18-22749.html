<div id="ygrps-yiv-452599235">My daughter and I have been homeschooling in central Mexico on a shoestring since April. We walk alot, go to the library, she comes with me when I work and helps if she can or reads if she can&#39;t. Since we began homeschooling she has become an avid reader. (She just turned 9.) We treat ourselves once a week to a visit to the swimming pool at a nearby hotel. We also cook together. I include her in the every day chores rather than think of her as a separate class of person because she is a kid.<br/>
 <br/>
It took a little while for us to get used to being together all the time. Luckily we actually have complimentary personalities and neither one of us minds spending time alone.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyone going to the Live and Learn conference?<br/>
 <br/>

It&#39;s summer vacation, after all!  (Then, when the rest of the <br/>
neighborhood thinks summer is over and goes back to school, don&#39;t.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have been going to local parks once a week, with friends.  We meet friends there and sometimes each of the kids brings along a neighborhood friend.  I pack snacks and beverages, so we don&#39;t need to buy the more expensive single serve stuff while out.  We vary the parks, as each has slightly different features.<br/>
<br/>
Our community has a free concert series in the park.  We were there Friday to listen to the music while the kids played/hung out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been more conscious of gas prices lately.  We took our annual trip to Moses Lake Family Aquatic center - an awesome water park with big slides, diving boards, sandy area, and more.  They allow food, so we always bring our own food and drink but the kids brought some money to buy a treat there too.  I spent $15 admission (for 3 people) and $12 gas.  Yikes!  Really cheap admission but not cheap gas...  It was a great day though.  We stayed for 5 hours and went as a group.  Five moms with their kids plus 5 more kids whose parents weren&#39;t able to come but between the other families we made room in our vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
I understand money being an issue, but most communities do have free or low cost things to do.  For instance, you can sometimes go at off hours for cheaper admission or find coupons for 2 for 1.  The park is free - you just have to get there.  Our local libraries have story and movie times for all ages, besides crafts and free movies and music (to check out), and, oh yeah, books :-)<br/>
<br/>
Water balloons are pretty inexpensive and can make for a fun afternoon.  Sleep out in your backyard and star gaze.  This time of year summer toys are on clearance, even though the hot weather will continue for another month or two.  Slip n slide, wading pools, squirt guns.  Make popsicles from juice or kool aid.  Go for walks, skates, bike rides.  Start a lettuce garden.<br/>

&quot;mommy mode&quot; all the time, and that&#39;s too much pressure?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling takes away that &quot;mommy has to be on top of everything all<br/>
the time&quot; kind of dynamic.  Talk to your kids.  What do they feel like<br/>
doing?  Better yet, if they&#39;re finding things to do already, just<br/>
watch them and be near them and soak it in.  And if there&#39;s something<br/>
*you* feel like doing, do it, and see if your kids would like to do it<br/>
with you.<br/>

sometimes have summer programs, too.  Both places can be fun to just<br/>
hang out at.  Check your paper for flea markets and garage sales, if<br/>
your kids would enjoy hitting some of those.  And while you&#39;re looking<br/>
in the paper, you might find a meeting of rock and gem lovers, or a<br/>
writer&#39;s club that one of you is interested in, or a Yu-gi-oh<br/>
duelist&#39;s league or something along those lines in the community<br/>
events section.<br/>

I&#39;ll be there, with my family.   My husband and my oldest haven&#39;t been to a <br/>
conference before.   <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a yahoolist for and about the conference, so if you do decide to go <br/>
(or if you&#39;re just curious about more details) you might join that list too.<br/>

My son and I like to hang out at our library and just read or look at all the books they have on whatever we are interested in at the time.  We also like to go to a local upscale grocery store that has a cafe and get a soft drink/cappacino and sit and read.  I think we both just like to read. lol  Read to your kids and let them see you reading and everything else just falls into place.<br/>

Swimming at the beach--includes sand castles, pirate<br/>
game, kelp wrestling, crab discovery, etc<br/>
<br/>
Playgrounds (many)<br/>
<br/>
Spray park/water guns (this is usually fun but this<br/>
week was innundated with a huge &quot;day camp&quot; group that<br/>
were rude and hurt the little kids....)<br/>
<br/>
Biking on the boardwalk<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter party<br/>

Petting the animals at the pet store (they are in<br/>
open-topped cages and many can be picked up with<br/>
supervision at this store)<br/>

Farmer&#39;s Market, twice<br/>
<br/>
Free ferry<br/>
<br/>
Picking berries<br/>
<br/>
local festivals (seems to be at least one every<br/>
weekend)<br/>

browsing antique stores<br/>
<br/>
browsing bookstores (3 times)<br/>
<br/>
walking around town<br/>

Walking through open-air sculpture park<br/>
<br/>
two garage sales<br/>
<br/>
aquarium (not really free--but we bought a year&#39;s pass<br/>
so it was free yesterday!)<br/>

Yes.  Sometimes a game is missing parts.  Dice are easy to replace.  If &quot;cards&quot; are missing, we make our own, which can be really fun.  (We added a T Rex and a helicopter to the Family Pastimes &quot;Princess&quot; game because the Flower card was missing.)  We keep intending to add crazy cards to our Munchkin game, but haven&#39;t done it yet.<br/>
