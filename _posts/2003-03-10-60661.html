<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460775256">I enjoyed the discussion (mine included) about negative dreams of high school <br/>
on this list. So of course I had an unschooling dream last night, never had <br/>
one of those before! <br/>
<br/>
My mother, my daughter, and I were at some convention with tables and <br/>
displays. There was a special room/display that you could add to the art with <br/>
your own personal contribution. <br/>
<br/>
I was trying my damnedest to write something on the wall. It was like a <br/>
chalkboard, but my writing wouldn&#39;t stay on and it was too light. So I tried <br/>
a crayon, and it wasn&#39;t legible. <br/>
<br/>
 I was trying to write &quot;Quit school and Get a Life. Unschooling.com&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 It was more frustrating than being naked at high school ROFL.......<br/>
