<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;People were saying that there are two great deschooling articles in the<br/>
&gt;current issue of HEM, Home Education Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of those, &quot;Unschooling is my Job,&quot; by Ruthe Freidner Matilsky, is <br/>
online with some other great selections from the current issue at our <br/>
website:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can order back issues (our annual Back Issue Sale is coming up <br/>
and it&#39;s always a fantastic time to stock up!), but right now I <br/>
believe you&#39;ll receive the current issue (Sept/Oct) if you ask for a <br/>
free sample copy. Just go to our home page <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com</a> and click on the &quot;Never seen a copy?&quot; <br/>
link below the cover image. I&#39;m not sure where the office is in the <br/>
process, though - at some point they&#39;ll roll over the request list <br/>
and include it with the subscriptions for the Nov/Dec issue. You <br/>
could find out by contacting Stacy, our office manager, at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HEM-Info@...">HEM-Info@...</a> or give her a call at 1-800-236-3278 <br/>
(she&#39;ll be back in the office Monday morning).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m still in Alaska, but getting ready to head back to Washington <br/>
state on Monday, so I&#39;ll be out of touch all next week. Been some <br/>
interesting reading here lately... wish I had time to do more than <br/>
just read.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1164478014">That is an incredible article!  Hats off to Ruthe...it hit home even <br/>
though I am just beginning.  Thanks for sending it Helen.  I should <br/>
hopefully be receiving my HEMs soon.  This is one of those pieces <br/>
I&#39;d like to print to life size, like Sandra&#39;s Certificate of <br/>
Empowerment and put it on my bedroom door, so that I am reminded at <br/>
the end of every single day.  It helps to put into perspective the <br/>
ludicrous guilt felt at the seemingly lack of work in unschooling.  <br/>
I would also like to put the following across the back of my <br/>
van....I am the proud parent of a child who is unschooled, <br/>
unfettered and unleashed ...on life!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175021760">Thanks Sandra, I got it this time.  What a wonderful article.  It is <br/>
much needed as my husband&#39;s stress is increasing and it does trickle <br/>
down.  He spent a day home with us (during the week)yesterday and <br/>
asked if &quot;this&quot; is what the kids do all day?  Even though I was not <br/>
feeling well with a nasty cold the kids shared with me we still made <br/>
some apple bread together (discussed fractions and subtracting) and <br/>
read together.  We read from our true/false interesting fact <br/>
cards...the kids think they are funny.  My son played Caesar II <br/>
(Build a better Rome) which he is obsessed with as is my husband.  <br/>
They played outside and watered their pumpkin seeds they had <br/>
planted.  We talked about greenhouses and the reasons why they might <br/>
not grow here in Okinawa.  I thought it was a good day considering I <br/>
slept off an on and fought off congestion and a fever. Even though I <br/>
would like to be deschooling more comfortably. Nevertheless, my <br/>
husband has been supportive, but it is wearing off.  I have given <br/>
him several articles and I will give him yours....he is just making <br/>
comments like &quot;she needs to be learning her letter sounds (5 yr.old <br/>
d)despite the fact that he listened to me dictate 3 sentences she <br/>
asked for and she wrote all the letters on her own...she couldn&#39;t do <br/>
that a week ago!  &quot;He needs to be doing his math ...he can&#39;t even <br/>
add 5 + 2! (son with LDs)...my husband says he can&#39;t handle it much <br/>
longer...I keep telling him he has got to look outside of the box.  <br/>
He is now trying to force my son to read i.e. with his Caesar game <br/>
he is struggling with stages and my husband tells him to read the <br/>
pop up boxes ...my son just says &quot;I did&quot; and doesn&#39;t ask for help <br/>
anymore (he did not read them).  He sat down with him last night to <br/>
read and made him read to him(dad)and it was labored and it upsets <br/>
me.  He is becoming more reluctant to read or do anything remotely <br/>
like schoolwork and I don&#39;t blame him...I expected it.  I am sorry <br/>
for such a long post, it just comes at a moment when my dh left to <br/>
run errands and I can tell he is about to blow in regards to the <br/>
childrens&#39; education.  I don&#39;t know what else to do to help him <br/>
understand.  I&#39;ll invite him to ask questions of the group, but I <br/>
don&#39;t know if he will and he is about to leave for a few weeks (we <br/>
will miss him yes, but it will offer some reprieve).  I should stop <br/>
rambling, I just know we are doing the right thing, but my dh&#39;s <br/>
support is wearing off.  Thanks again Sandra for the article.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119928944">You&#39;re welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I downloaded a free game from the internet (for a Mac, I don&#39;t know if they <br/>
had PC version) called &quot;Hangaroo,&quot; a kind of hangman game.  Turns out that&#39;s <br/>
where Marty came to know Canada has Prime Ministers (I asked him yesterday).  <br/>
And last night Holly was playing it, asked for some help, came closer to <br/>
winning than Marty or I ever had, and we wanted to see what happens if you DO <br/>
get ten games in a row.  <br/>
<br/>
So Marty came to help too.  The 9th question was some highest peak, and we <br/>
got Tajikistan, but could NOT guess enough of the name of the peak.  It was <br/>
in Russian.  We had only one guess left.<br/>
<br/>
So Holly signed on, Marty pulled up google, entered Tajikistan mountain peak, <br/>
and we got a list of the highest peaks in the world, and there, the third <br/>
Tajikistan listed (way down a long list) it was!!! So we won, saved a cartoon <br/>
kangaroo, and had fun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly was wanting to fill in the letters once one of us has identified the <br/>
word (If/when we had).  I&#39;m best at the phrases.  They&#39;re English idioms or <br/>
cliches, and I know more of them than the kids do.  So on those, I would say <br/>
what it was (his bark is worse than his bite, or whatever) and they were <br/>
usually simple words, and Holly would fill them in.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband might like playing Hangman with the kids online.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another Hangman we&#39;ve had for years.  Not totally free, but worth the <br/>
shareware fee.  <br/>

It has educational categories, but we just set it on random so we aren&#39;t JUST <br/>
doing presidents or states or whatever.<br/>

I went through a frustrating period w/my DD when she was about 3. The just <br/>
couldn&#39;t read the pages &quot;right&quot;, and I was getting as frustrated as she <br/>
was. But mine came from &quot;not being able to &#39;teach&#39; her to read&quot;. Later on I <br/>
figured out that she *refused* to read anything out loud to me because I <br/>
would critique every mispronunciation :( At that point, thank goodness for <br/>
e-lists, I asked &quot;why can&#39;t I teach a three yr. old to read?&quot;. That&#39;s when <br/>
I was told by an unschooler that I need to chill, don&#39;t stress, and leave <br/>
her be; which I did. She&#39;s now 9 going on 10 (next month) and reads like a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840740261">Michelle,  Does it help to show him examples of things you&#39;ve done that havn&#39;t worked?  For me, I have to say,You know, when I was reading all those notations to him and making him read all the descriptions on those games he really  closed up on me and he didn&#39;t even want to play them any more.  It really stopped him learning right in its tracks.  My husband then doesn&#39;t take it personal and he sees it differently.  My husband goes back and forth and I am really trying to be patient with him.<br/>
<br/>
We were just discussing Sandras article on spoiling children.  And we had some really good discussions.  Its so nice to have a different perspective to show him.  He is worried we are spoiling my son with the PS2. Its hard because I feel as tho&#39; its part of his life and learning.  And I am going to have him save his money to buy more games because I can&#39;t buy many of those!<br/>
<br/>
Michelle your day sounded great!  Keep up your good living and I think it will all work out!<br/>

Thanks Sandra, I got it this time.  What a wonderful article.  It is <br/>
much needed as my husband&#39;s stress is increasing and it does trickle <br/>
down.  He spent a day home with us (during the week)yesterday and <br/>
asked if &quot;this&quot; is what the kids do all day?  Even though I was not <br/>
feeling well with a nasty cold the kids shared with me we still made <br/>
some apple bread together (discussed fractions and subtracting) and <br/>
read together.  We read from our true/false interesting fact <br/>
cards...the kids think they are funny.  My son played Caesar II <br/>
(Build a better Rome) which he is obsessed with as is my husband.  <br/>
They played outside and watered their pumpkin seeds they had <br/>
planted.  We talked about greenhouses and the reasons why they might <br/>
not grow here in Okinawa.  I thought it was a good day considering I <br/>
slept off an on and fought off congestion and a fever. Even though I <br/>
would like to be deschooling more comfortably. Nevertheless, my <br/>
husband has been supportive, but it is wearing off.  I have given <br/>
him several articles and I will give him yours....he is just making <br/>
comments like &quot;she needs to be learning her letter sounds (5 yr.old <br/>
d)despite the fact that he listened to me dictate 3 sentences she <br/>
asked for and she wrote all the letters on her own...she couldn&#39;t do <br/>
that a week ago!  &quot;He needs to be doing his math ...he can&#39;t even <br/>
add 5 + 2! (son with LDs)...my husband says he can&#39;t handle it much <br/>
longer...I keep telling him he has got to look outside of the box.  <br/>
He is now trying to force my son to read i.e. with his Caesar game <br/>
he is struggling with stages and my husband tells him to read the <br/>
pop up boxes ...my son just says &quot;I did&quot; and doesn&#39;t ask for help <br/>
anymore (he did not read them).  He sat down with him last night to <br/>
read and made him read to him(dad)and it was labored and it upsets <br/>
me.  He is becoming more reluctant to read or do anything remotely <br/>
like schoolwork and I don&#39;t blame him...I expected it.  I am sorry <br/>
for such a long post, it just comes at a moment when my dh left to <br/>
run errands and I can tell he is about to blow in regards to the <br/>
childrens&#39; education.  I don&#39;t know what else to do to help him <br/>
understand.  I&#39;ll invite him to ask questions of the group, but I <br/>
don&#39;t know if he will and he is about to leave for a few weeks (we <br/>
will miss him yes, but it will offer some reprieve).  I should stop <br/>
rambling, I just know we are doing the right thing, but my dh&#39;s <br/>
support is wearing off.  Thanks again Sandra for the article.<br/>

still be dissapointed.  Deep seated issues...we talked about him <br/>
dealing with those.  Dh does know that homeschooling is right, but <br/>
unschooling is a different ballgame.  On another note, my ds has <br/>
been very emotional the past few days.  He is pulling away from any <br/>
reading (me reading to him!), etc.  He is having quite a few <br/>

How old is you ds? <br/>
Does he need you just to play a few games with him and have fun?  I know that&#39;s what helps with my kids.  Or just sitting and talking with them, individually.  My undivided attention for a little bit can go a long way.<br/>
I don&#39;t think you gave him too many freedoms too soon, could it just be him getting used to his new life.  You know..deschooling and all that?<br/>
I&#39;m glad you wrote, I&#39;m up in the middle of the night, wide awake and its nice to read an e-mail!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219127363">Hi Kelli,<br/>
My ds is 8.  my dd is 5.  Yes, unschooling is &quot;out there&quot; for him.  <br/>
It is a stretch for sure!  He is a military man to the bone and that <br/>
interferes with his mindset too much (in my opinion).  Up late huh?  <br/>
I will be tonight...dh left for Hawaii to get laser surgery on his <br/>
eyes and will be gone for about 2 weeks.  I don&#39;t like him going <br/>
alone, or him being gone, but it does give us a bit of freedom from <br/>
the stress and the same for him as well.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be attached <br/>
to the computer all night.  Games?  Matter of fact today I bought <br/>
3!  We are off to play either Green Eggs and Ham, Jr. Monopoly <br/>
Dinosaur version, or Payday (may be a little tough)...or paint and <br/>
erupt a volcano!!  Fun!!! <br/>
Thanks again Kelli<br/>
Michelle<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-213975606">Have fun!  My kids love Payday, I have mine from when I was little and they get into that,  we don&#39;t have the dinosaur monopoly but my ds would love it, he&#39;s 9.<br/>
I am starting yoga to try and relieve some stress, went and did that this morning, it really made me feel better.<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>

My ds is 8.  my dd is 5.  Yes, unschooling is &quot;out there&quot; for him.  <br/>
It is a stretch for sure!  He is a military man to the bone and that <br/>
interferes with his mindset too much (in my opinion).  Up late huh?  <br/>
I will be tonight...dh left for Hawaii to get laser surgery on his <br/>
eyes and will be gone for about 2 weeks.  I don&#39;t like him going <br/>
alone, or him being gone, but it does give us a bit of freedom from <br/>
the stress and the same for him as well.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be attached <br/>
to the computer all night.  Games?  Matter of fact today I bought <br/>
3!  We are off to play either Green Eggs and Ham, Jr. Monopoly <br/>
Dinosaur version, or Payday (may be a little tough)...or paint and <br/>
erupt a volcano!!  Fun!!! <br/>
Thanks again Kelli<br/>

The dinosaur monopoly is great!  You have to get a matching pair of <br/>
dino tracks and then you can buy them.  You also get the card <br/>
telling you all of the facts about that specific dinosaur...really <br/>
neat learning tool.  Yoga is really great!  I took it in a tai chi <br/>
blend.  Before we left the states, I took tai chi which really helps <br/>
to quiet my mind...still looking for it here :)<br/>
