<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409671512">After posting my reply to the food issues post, I&#39;d better preface this message <br/>
with the assurance that I do in fact want suggestions, not just empathy, BUT if <br/>
you want to give empathy too, it is welcome of course, but I am also needing <br/>
concrete advice and solutions, or maybe just a good pep talk, I&#39;m not sure, so <br/>
here goes:<br/>
<br/>
I have a 9 yo and a 5 yo.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I am doing this Unschooling thing right. I worry I may have gone <br/>
too far in the opposite direction and am bordering on neglect!<br/>
Here is a typical day for us:<br/>
We&#39;ll wake up around 9 or 10 am, usually the kids will get up first, and they&#39;ll <br/>
play or watch T.V or a video until they get hungry. Sometimes they&#39;ll grab <br/>
themselves something to eat, but more often than not, they want me to make <br/>
breakfast for them and so they&#39;ll drag me out of bed to make it (I&#39;m usually up <br/>
until 1 or 2am)  After breakfast and clean up, I usually read and answer e-<br/>
mails or search the internet for information for about an hour or an hour and a <br/>
half. By then they&#39;re usually ready for lunch or snack or whatever, we don&#39;t <br/>
really call it anything, just &quot;hungry&quot; and &quot;eat&quot;, so I make some more food, <br/>
clean up and pack food for our afternoon outing. 2 days a week we go to a <br/>
friend&#39;s house for playgroup, one or two days a week we go to the park with <br/>
another homeschool group or two and one day during the week we stay <br/>
home all day. (although lately my husband has been taking them to work that <br/>
day, so I can have the day off!)<br/>
We usually get to our destination by 2pm and stay until 5 or 6pm and come <br/>
home, eat again, and the kids watch T.V. or play with each other (with a LOT <br/>
of fighting!)<br/>
I usually spend any free time I have reading or on the computer, I run a food <br/>
buying club and that takes up my evenings as well as more e-mails and <br/>
internet searches.<br/>
I rarely watch T.V. with the kids. They mostly watch videos which don&#39;t interest <br/>
me at all and the only actual &quot;T.V.&quot; we have is PBS because we don&#39;t have <br/>
cable and either the shows interest them and not me (like cyberchase) or they <br/>
interest me and not them (like documentaries) and even then, I really can&#39;t <br/>
watch these because they&#39;re running around playing loudly, so I usually 99% <br/>
of the time opt to get on the computer in my room, with the door closed.<br/>
So, I don&#39;t interact with them as much as I&#39;d like to, but when I do, I am easily <br/>
bored by what they do, or I am yelling at them to stop fighting (I&#39;m working on <br/>
the yelling issue, so more and more, I&#39;m talking to them constructively about <br/>
they disputes!) when I try to discuss stuff that&#39;s interesting to me, they are <br/>
bored with that! So we usually go our own ways, them playing and watching <br/>
videos/PBS and me, preparing food, cleaning up and getting on my computer. <br/>
If they come to me saying they are bored, which often happens on the day we <br/>
stay home, I tell them boredom is wonderful, that it helps you to be creative <br/>
and I send them off to be bored elsewhere, so I can get some work done. It <br/>
never fails to get them to play something new or old always creative!<br/>
So, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much learning. I do interact with them <br/>
when they come to me, will answer questions about how to spell something or <br/>
where the scotch tape is, or what&#39;s the difference between a lion and a tiger <br/>
(we usually look it up on the internet together and find pictures etc...) but that&#39;s <br/>
it. I don&#39;t sit with them watching T.V. except on rare occasions when it sucks <br/>
me in, I don&#39;t go to the library with them very much (about once a month) <br/>
because they don&#39;t like it and say they don&#39;t want books! I don&#39;t take them to <br/>
theater shows because the homeschool groups (and the affordable tickets) <br/>
are in the mornings and they really resist getting up early and haven&#39;t enjoyed <br/>
the few we have gone to very much. I don&#39;t do any curriculum or workbooks <br/>
unless I&#39;m specificlly asked to buy such and such workbook, and then I don&#39;t <br/>
do the stuff in the workbook with them unless specifically asked.<br/>
We live 2&1/2 hours from the nearest zoo and I hate to drive, so we don&#39;t go <br/>
there, amusement parks and the county fair are not in our budget (they&#39;ve <br/>
asked to go to disneyworld or disneyland and the zoo lately.)<br/>
So am I doing enough? <br/>
Am I neglectful? I let them watch videos for hours, play video games for hours <br/>
too, as long as they want, but am I providing enough interesting alternatives <br/>
for them? Are they to learn almost everything from videos and video games?<br/>
I keep trying to let them be my guides, let them lead, but lately my daughter is <br/>
been asking to go back to school, so obviously I must not be providing what <br/>
she needs. I ask her why, what school offers that homeschooling doesn&#39;t and <br/>
she can&#39;t articulate it.<br/>
Any help would be appreciated!<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42369541">&lt;&lt;Am I neglectful? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, you asked.  <br/>
It sounds neglectful to me.  <br/>
<br/>
I think as an unschooling mom you have some hurdles to overcome.  My kids<br/>
have motivated me to do things that I am not comfortable with that I know<br/>
will benefit them.  How about driving more often so you are not<br/>
uncomfortable taking them to the zoo and other places.  Or just deciding<br/>
that you&#39;ll do it despite the fact that you feel uncomfortable.  Feeling<br/>
uncomfortable never killed anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
The county fair doesn&#39;t have to be expensive.  (and sending kids to school<br/>
isn&#39;t cheap either, between decent clothes, lunch money, school pictures,<br/>
sport uniforms, etc)  We often go for just the price of admission.  Bring<br/>
your own food and spend the day browsing the animal barn, watching the horse<br/>
shows, the horses on the track, or the demonstrations. They are all free.<br/>
<br/>
I watched Super Nanny with the kids the other day (not something I&#39;d choose<br/>
on my own, but it launches many good conversations) and the kids on that<br/>
show spend the day fighting while the mother hid out in her room with her<br/>
laptop.  It was the saddest thing I ever saw.  She didn&#39;t even like her kids<br/>
and spent time just trying to get away from them.  The kids had NEVER played<br/>
a game with their mother before, for goodness sakes.  Those poor kids were<br/>
starved for attention and would take any attention they could get, good or<br/>
bad.<br/>
<br/>
From the time my kids were big enough to hold cards, we&#39;ve played games with<br/>
them.  My kids love to be read to.  (they aren&#39;t crazy about going to the<br/>
library either but are always glad they went when we get home with a bunch<br/>
of books and movies.)  I read to them often and if they donâ€™t see a book<br/>
they think they would like, then I pick out books that I think they would<br/>
like and when we have some quiet time I read an excerpt from it and see if<br/>
they like it.  If they reject it, we move on.  No big deal.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like you all need to sit down and make a list of all the<br/>
things they would like to do (with your help on the idea end of course) and<br/>
then try to go through the list and do the things that are possible.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if the sleeping schedule you are all on isn&#39;t working then talk about<br/>
how the changes could affect you (benefit you all) and make the changes.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are present with the kids during the day and you help them to resolve<br/>
their differences before they are outright fights, you home will be a lot<br/>
more peaceful.  <br/>
<br/>
The last point I want to make is that unschooling isn&#39;t just about letting<br/>
the children lead, it&#39;s about providing a rich supportive environment and<br/>
interacting with your kids.  What have you done this week (or last or<br/>
whenever) to enrich their lives?  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re on a math kick here. I am pulling out the old Family Math book<br/>
and we&#39;re playing games and solving puzzles right and left. I am math<br/>
phobic so I&#39;ve been learning lots of coll things at the livingmath.net<br/>
site which is giving me tools for how to enrich our home environment<br/>
using fiction and other books (not workbooks) to help create a math<br/>
rich environment.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been much more fun than I expected and I&#39;m starting to feel smart<br/>
(where I&#39;ve always felt not smart) with numbers. Just in a short<br/>
period of time!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve started an unschooling blog for myself where I record what<br/>
I do with my kids. I do this so I can get a real picture of how much<br/>
time we spend together and doing what. This is helping me balance<br/>
work, grad school and time with kids.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve discovered is that if I am not actively seeking ways to<br/>
enrich the environment, the kids don&#39;t often know what to do that is<br/>
different than what they already know to do. So my job is back to<br/>
strewing... and being an active learner myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643849434">It is too bad that you raised this when so many of the experienced <br/>
unschoolers are probably on their way to the L&L conference, but I <br/>
will speak from my own experience. <br/>
<br/>
I have two children, as well, who are five years apart.  They love <br/>
each other and have a wonderful relationship, but they are not really <br/>
playmates for eachother right now at their life stages.  It is <br/>
extremely important to me that they have a respectful relationship,a <br/>
nd that means that I am involved in a lot of their playing.  I could <br/>
not have a closed door in my house with me on one side and them on <br/>
the other and not have a fight erupt after about 30 minutes.  They <br/>
would be crazed by the time I was on the computer for an hour or an <br/>
hour and 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds as if you are new to this, and so are your children.  They <br/>
may want to lead their lives, but they will need some ideas and <br/>
enthusiastic involvement.  We saw the SpongeBob movie and there is a <br/>
song with something about &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot;.  Most mornings, I <br/>
say, &quot;Okay!  Today is going to be the best day ever! Let&#39;s_____! <br/>
(sometimes, it is stay in our pjs and watch Hamtaro!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t sugar coat it, more often than not my enthusiasm is met with <br/>
rolling eyes from my tween :).  But, she does join in, and begins to <br/>
laugh and be connected.  <br/>
<br/>
My dd, especially, feels disconnected from me when she watches more <br/>
than a hour of tv at a time.  My ds won&#39;t eat breakfast unless he&#39;s <br/>
sitting in front of the tv.  So, I started leaving fun things in the <br/>
kitchen for when they wake up.  Sometimes it is coloring pages and <br/>
some cool markers, sometimes a big bowl of rice mixed with glitter, <br/>
or shells, or a cool book, or some neat fabric.  That way we have <br/>
something to talk about while the coffee kicks in for me, and that <br/>
may be something that they are drawn to that connects us together as <br/>
a family before we turn to the screens in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
We have no limits on tv and computer, but I do help my kids (since <br/>
they are so young and my dd is not Always Unschooled and has a harder <br/>
time with this than my always unschooled son).  I make sure that they <br/>
have had *enough* of other things in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Did they feed their souls some natural beauty?  Did their love of <br/>
books and art get fed today(and my kids DO happen to love books and <br/>
drawing~for you it may be legos or anime or video games)?  Where is <br/>
the balance in our lives?  Do they need balance today, or is today <br/>
just a computer game all day kind of day or read all day or park all <br/>
day?  Sometimes an imbalance is okay, too.<br/>
<br/>
And, lastly, I *do* watch Cyberchase, Foster&#39;s Home for Imaginary <br/>
Friends and Spiderman, because there is ***so much*** that my <br/>
children get out of those shows.  We raced home yesterday from the <br/>
park to catch a show, and watched it togther.  No, it is not <br/>
something I would choose to watch (I am more of a Lifetime Channel <br/>
movie gal myself), but for me, unschooling is all about CONNECTIONS.  <br/>
If you aren&#39;t connected to what your children are doing, you can&#39;t <br/>
expand those connections with things that will be meaningful to them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, you have to give first.  If you want them to get up <br/>
earlier to participate in some thins that you think might interest <br/>
them, you have to show that you know and care about what interests <br/>
them now.  If you are bored by their playing, and they know it, they <br/>
won&#39;t trust that you know what is fun in the outside world.<br/>
<br/>
And, here&#39;s a little dose of empathy, too....It would be nice if our <br/>
kids came out of school, loved life and plunged into passions like <br/>
saving the whales, but that&#39;s not real life.  Like it or not, <br/>
unschooling is all about Real Life. :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We are in love this week with these books called _Sir Cumference and <br/>
the First Round Table_ and _Sir Cumference and the Sword and the <br/>
Cone_.   When I got them from the library, I thought they&#39;d be <br/>
too &quot;hokey&quot;, but my dd (8) LOVES them.  She thinks it is hilarious <br/>
that Sir Cumference&#39;s wife is called Lady Di of Ameter and the <br/>
village carpenters are twims named Geo and Sym of Metry.<br/>
<br/>
Last night she said, &quot;Will you sneak me a little math before bed?&quot; <br/>
and held up these books.<br/>
<br/>
We got coloring pages from the internet of Spongebob and Patrick and <br/>
decorated the back of the outside of the turtle tank so he looks like <br/>
he lives in Bikini Bottom.<br/>
<br/>
We are a Halloween loving family, so we are completely into that, <br/>
too, making decorations, gathering dead leaves, planning costumes, <br/>
reading spooky stories.<br/>
<br/>
Also, from the library, we got a DK book on Batman.  Probably the <br/>
coolest cartoon encyclopedia type thing I have ever seen.  And now I <br/>
can keep up with my three year old&#39;s knowledge of Batman (can you <br/>
guess what he&#39;s going to be for Halloween?).<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308148006">**They mostly watch videos which don&#39;t interest<br/>
me at all and the only actual &quot;T.V.&quot; we have is PBS because we don&#39;t have<br/>
cable and either the shows interest them and not me (like cyberchase) or <br/>
they interest me and not them...**<br/>
<br/>
What about renting some great family movies from Netflix or the video <br/>
store?  (Or borrowing from friends or picking them up at garage sales?)  <br/>
You might find stuff that&#39;s of general interest.<br/>
<br/>
I think I can relate some to what you are saying, because when we first <br/>
got cable TV we also (without asking) were given a second TV.  My son <br/>
wanted to stay home a lot, we had just moved and didn&#39;t have local <br/>
friends.  It was easy for us to fall into a pattern where we were <br/>
watching TV in seperate rooms.  (There were lots of shows that I <br/>
prefered over his choices.)  During the same period, I also spent a lot <br/>
of time on this computer and on this and other lists.  But I really <br/>
don&#39;t think it these choices good for our relationship.  I think our <br/>
relationship got pretty thin in that time period. <br/>
<br/>
After the excitement of cable wore off, we both watch less TV most days, <br/>
but I now follow the advice here and spend some of my day sitting and <br/>
watching with him. We don&#39;t talk a lot during the shows, as he isn&#39;t <br/>
very talkative, but we do talk some, and I get clues about what he is <br/>
interested in.  If I don&#39;t find the beginning of the show very <br/>
interesting, I have been known to fold laundry or flip through a <br/>
magazine if I wasn&#39;t fascinated by his viewing choice.<br/>
<br/>
(I think it was key to me to recognize that my habits were choices, and <br/>
at any moment in the day I could chose something different or something <br/>
better.  And I had the same nagging feeling that you have that I wasn&#39;t <br/>
interacting with him enough.)<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are really loud inside and you are concerned that they are <br/>
watching too much TV, can you get them outside more for active play?  <br/>
(I&#39;d rather go to the park with a friend than alone, but I can slake my <br/>
need for entertainment with a magazine or with music on headphones.)  <br/>
Most places in the N. hemisphere the weather is only going to get worse, <br/>
so go while you still can.<br/>
<br/>
I am definitely have been guilty of letting my son entertain himself <br/>
while I pursue my own interests.  But I&#39;m trying to come to some more <br/>
reasonable balance.  (I think there was a period when I was completely <br/>
tapped out from the 24/7 mothering routine and all the interrupted <br/>
nights, but now I have more to give.)  In my case, he seemed engrossed <br/>
by the cable TV and was not telling me he was bored.  I think that if he <br/>
had told me that, I would have woken up sooner.<br/>
<br/>
** If they come to me saying they are bored, which often happens on the <br/>
day we stay home, I tell them boredom is wonderful, that it helps you to <br/>
be creative and I send them off to be bored elsewhere**<br/>
<br/>
No.  Take this as a sign that they want to interact with you, or with <br/>
someone or something new and interesting.  Make it your mission to be <br/>
responsive to these requests.<br/>
<br/>
** Am I neglectful?**<br/>
<br/>
I think you could improve your performance.  Are there ways you could <br/>
get quiet time for yourself *other times* in the week, when someone else <br/>
is with the kids?  Are you depressed or just frazzled?  Can you figure <br/>
out a more efficient way to meet your own needs so that there is more <br/>
time and strength left over for your kids?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244860729">What first struck me about your post was that you considered the time<br/>
your kids were watching TV to be your &quot;free time.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
While it can happen that kids are ok watching TV for a time while a<br/>
parent does something else if your kids are fighting this shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
your free time.  <br/>
<br/>
You might find free time when your kids are asleep or when your partner<br/>
can be with the kids or you might not get much or any free time until<br/>
your kids are older.   But the goal of unschooling is not to find<br/>
convenient free time for mom.  So maybe you need to reassess your<br/>
priorities and think about whether unschooling is a deeply held<br/>
belief/philosophy for you or just why you chose this path. <br/>
<br/>
If you have a like minded partner maybe your best hope for finding some<br/>
free time at this stage in your kids lives would be those times when your<br/>
partner can devote attention to the kids.   You won&#39;t ever get these same<br/>
kids at this same age again and if your priority is finding time for<br/>
yourself you&#39;ll be missing the joy of five and nine year olds and you&#39;ll<br/>
be cheating your kids.  I don&#39;t actually believe your priority is to find<br/>
free time.  <br/>
<br/>
***I rarely watch T.V. with the kids. They mostly watch videos which<br/>
don&#39;t interest <br/>
me at all and the only actual &quot;T.V.&quot; we have is PBS because we don&#39;t have<br/>
<br/>
cable and either the shows interest them and not me***<br/>
<br/>
Successful unschooling and a strong relationship with your kids will<br/>
absolutely require you to be interested in what they&#39;re doing.  You don&#39;t<br/>
have to like cyberchase but you can watch with them and talk to them and<br/>
discover why *they* like cyberchase.  That&#39;s the important thing here. <br/>
Not that *you* like their programs but that you like to be with your<br/>
kids, that you like to see their enthusiasm and enjoyment. <br/>
<br/>
One possible step toward finding shows you all enjoy would be more<br/>
options.  If you&#39;re limiting their options on purpose I don&#39;t think you<br/>
should complain that you don&#39;t enjoy the shows they&#39;re choosing. &lt;g&gt;   I<br/>
recommend getting more channels and then maybe another TV so that even<br/>
more options are available to all of you.   <br/>
<br/>
***I usually 99% of the time opt to get on the computer in my room, with<br/>
the door closed.***<br/>
<br/>
You are blocking your children out.  Are you depressed?  Are you in a<br/>
rut?   You need to be with them.  Children run around and play loudly,<br/>
that&#39;s what they do.  What&#39;s stopping you from playing with them?   <br/>
<br/>
***I don&#39;t interact with them as much as I&#39;d like to, but when I do, I am<br/>
easily <br/>
bored by what they do,***<br/>
<br/>
Get over it.  I know that sounds harsh but your children need you to be<br/>
involved with them.  You can suggest games and shows you might all enjoy.<br/>
 You can bake cookies, have a mashed potato fight, have a water balloon<br/>
fight, paint the sidewalk.   Do you need a list of fun things to offer<br/>
and do with your kids?  People here could brainstorm for you. <br/>
But you should be interacting with them when they are doing the things<br/>
they enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
***or I am yelling at them to stop fighting (I&#39;m working on <br/>
the yelling issue, so more and more, I&#39;m talking to them constructively<br/>
about <br/>
they disputes!)***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good that your working on the yelling.  I recommend you stop yelling<br/>
at once. &lt;g&gt;  As the great Yoda says &quot;Do or do not, there is no try.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Some constructive talk might be ok as long as constructive talk isn&#39;t<br/>
code for lecturing.  But at five and nine they need you mostly to fix the<br/>
problem.  What are the usual problems between them?  Is one invading the<br/>
space of the other?  What is going on with them? <br/>
<br/>
***when I try to discuss stuff that&#39;s interesting to me, they are <br/>
bored with that! ***<br/>
<br/>
Are they mirroring your boredom with their shows and games?   I don&#39;t<br/>
think you can expect them to show an interest in what you&#39;re doing and in<br/>
what you enjoy if you are not showing an interest in their activities. <br/>
You need to be an interested person for others to be interested in you.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are disconnected from your kids.  <br/>
<br/>
***If they come to me saying they are bored, which often happens on the<br/>
day we <br/>
stay home, I tell them boredom is wonderful, that it helps you to be<br/>
creative <br/>
and I send them off to be bored elsewhere, so I can get some work<br/>
done.***<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re asking you for help and you&#39;re refusing.   What are you there<br/>
for?  Seriously.  Anyone could come into your house and cook and clean,<br/>
so why are *you* there? <br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to be successful you will need to be involved with your<br/>
children.  That means helping them live and play happily, helping them<br/>
find things they love, helping them solve problems.   <br/>
<br/>
If you went to your partner and said you were bored how would you feel if<br/>
your partner said, essentially, &quot;go away and be bored somewhere else.&quot;  <br/>
How many times could someone you love do that to you before you started<br/>
to feel like you weren&#39;t important to them at all?  <br/>
<br/>
***So, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much learning.***<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to get your kids to do things they are not interested in.  If<br/>
they don&#39;t like the library don&#39;t offer to take them there.   (Library&#39;s<br/>
have more than books though.  They have music, videos, audio books)<br/>
<br/>
Go to the park, take a lunch, take a kite, a ball, a Frisbee.   Go for a<br/>
walk, collect leaves, rocks, bugs.  Go for a hike, take food, ford<br/>
streams, catch frogs, take pictures.   Go to the pool, take water toys,<br/>
play.  Get squirt guns and blast each other.  Make up a wavy dance or a<br/>
swishy dance or a &quot;bees are stinging my butt&quot; dance.  Play games.  Some<br/>
games that can be played with little kids are:  Mancalla, Set, Racko,<br/>
Target, Five Crowns, Checkers, Clue, Tic Tac Toe, Life, Survival or<br/>
Extinction (dinosaur game) Chinese Checkers, Flinch, Sorry.   Play Mad<br/>
Libs, ask your kids for silly word and then read them the resulting<br/>
story.    Have &quot;Monster Movie Night&quot; rent old monster movies and make<br/>
popcorn and stomp around like Godzilla.   Go out for french fries.  Go<br/>
out for ice cream.  Run races, ride bikes, go sledding, ice skating,<br/>
roller skating.  Go play miniature golf.  Go bowling. <br/>
<br/>
***We live 2&1/2 hours from the nearest zoo and I hate to drive, so we<br/>
don&#39;t go <br/>
there,***<br/>
<br/>
I live two and a half hours from the nearest anything. &lt;g&gt;  Not really<br/>
but most things require us to drive some distance, usually forty miles or<br/>
more.   Get over it.  Seriously.  In the big scheme of things giving your<br/>
kids a big life is more important than a bit of driving.   <br/>
<br/>
Do you want to unschool?  I guess that&#39;s an important question.  Do you<br/>
want to, and why, and when you can answer that then I think you&#39;ll know<br/>
if you can make the required adjustments to give your kids the best<br/>
unschooling life. <br/>
<br/>
***So am I doing enough? ***<br/>
<br/>
No.  Not even nearly.  Get up and do something now, even if you go hug<br/>
them and kiss them and tell them they&#39;re great.  But preferably go play<br/>
with them, go somewhere, be their best and most exciting friend.  <br/>
<br/>
***I let them watch videos for hours, play video games for hours <br/>
too, as long as they want, but am I providing enough interesting<br/>
alternatives <br/>
for them?***<br/>
<br/>
TV and movies and games should be some choices among many choices not<br/>
their only choice.  You need to be offering more.  They can accept or<br/>
decline but you need to be offering them the world.  <br/>
<br/>
***Are they to learn almost everything from videos and video games?***<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely not.   Those things should be one option among endless options<br/>
and you should be the most shining option of all.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is too bad that you raised this when so many of<br/>
&gt; the experienced <br/>
&gt; unschoolers are probably on their way to the L&L<br/>
&gt; conference, but I <br/>
&gt; will speak from my own experience. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have two children, as well, who are five years<br/>
&gt; apart.  They love <br/>
&gt; each other and have a wonderful relationship, but<br/>
&gt; they are not really <br/>
&gt; playmates for eachother right now at their life<br/>
&gt; stages.  It is <br/>
&gt; extremely important to me that they have a<br/>
&gt; respectful relationship,a <br/>
&gt; nd that means that I am involved in a lot of their<br/>
&gt; playing.  I could <br/>
&gt; not have a closed door in my house with me on one<br/>
&gt; side and them on <br/>
&gt; the other and not have a fight erupt after about 30<br/>
&gt; minutes.  They <br/>
&gt; would be crazed by the time I was on the computer<br/>
&gt; for an hour or an <br/>
&gt; hour and 1/2.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It sounds as if you are new to this, and so are your<br/>
&gt; children.  They <br/>
&gt; may want to lead their lives, but they will need<br/>
&gt; some ideas and <br/>
&gt; enthusiastic involvement.  We saw the SpongeBob<br/>
&gt; movie and there is a <br/>
&gt; song with something about &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot;.  Most<br/>
&gt; mornings, I <br/>
&gt; say, &quot;Okay!  Today is going to be the best day ever!<br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s_____! <br/>
&gt; (sometimes, it is stay in our pjs and watch<br/>
&gt; Hamtaro!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t sugar coat it, more often than not my<br/>
&gt; enthusiasm is met with <br/>
&gt; rolling eyes from my tween :).  But, she does join<br/>
&gt; in, and begins to <br/>
&gt; laugh and be connected.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dd, especially, feels disconnected from me when<br/>
&gt; she watches more <br/>
&gt; than a hour of tv at a time.  My ds won&#39;t eat<br/>
&gt; breakfast unless he&#39;s <br/>
&gt; sitting in front of the tv.  So, I started leaving<br/>
&gt; fun things in the <br/>
&gt; kitchen for when they wake up.  Sometimes it is<br/>
&gt; coloring pages and <br/>
&gt; some cool markers, sometimes a big bowl of rice<br/>
&gt; mixed with glitter, <br/>
&gt; or shells, or a cool book, or some neat fabric. <br/>
&gt; That way we have <br/>
&gt; something to talk about while the coffee kicks in<br/>
&gt; for me, and that <br/>
&gt; may be something that they are drawn to that<br/>
&gt; connects us together as <br/>
&gt; a family before we turn to the screens in our lives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have no limits on tv and computer, but I do help<br/>
&gt; my kids (since <br/>
&gt; they are so young and my dd is not Always Unschooled<br/>
&gt; and has a harder <br/>
&gt; time with this than my always unschooled son).  I<br/>
&gt; make sure that they <br/>
&gt; have had *enough* of other things in their lives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did they feed their souls some natural beauty?  Did<br/>
&gt; their love of <br/>
&gt; books and art get fed today(and my kids DO happen to<br/>
&gt; love books and <br/>
&gt; drawing~for you it may be legos or anime or video<br/>
&gt; games)?  Where is <br/>
&gt; the balance in our lives?  Do they need balance<br/>
&gt; today, or is today <br/>
&gt; just a computer game all day kind of day or read all<br/>
&gt; day or park all <br/>
&gt; day?  Sometimes an imbalance is okay, too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, lastly, I *do* watch Cyberchase, Foster&#39;s Home<br/>
&gt; for Imaginary <br/>
&gt; Friends and Spiderman, because there is ***so<br/>
&gt; much*** that my <br/>
&gt; children get out of those shows.  We raced home<br/>
&gt; yesterday from the <br/>
&gt; park to catch a show, and watched it togther.  No,<br/>
&gt; it is not <br/>
&gt; something I would choose to watch (I am more of a<br/>
&gt; Lifetime Channel <br/>
&gt; movie gal myself), but for me, unschooling is all<br/>
&gt; about CONNECTIONS.  <br/>
&gt; If you aren&#39;t connected to what your children are<br/>
&gt; doing, you can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; expand those connections with things that will be<br/>
&gt; meaningful to them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes, you have to give first.  If you want them<br/>
&gt; to get up <br/>
&gt; earlier to participate in some thins that you think<br/>
&gt; might interest <br/>
&gt; them, you have to show that you know and care about<br/>
&gt; what interests <br/>
&gt; them now.  If you are bored by their playing, and<br/>
&gt; they know it, they <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t trust that you know what is fun in the outside<br/>
&gt; world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, here&#39;s a little dose of empathy, too....It<br/>
&gt; would be nice if our <br/>
&gt; kids came out of school, loved life and plunged into<br/>
&gt; passions like <br/>
&gt; saving the whales, but that&#39;s not real life.  Like<br/>
&gt; it or not, <br/>
&gt; unschooling is all about Real Life. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>

If you want to be involved with your kids, and this is<br/>
what interests them, you need to be watching with<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so I usually 99% <br/>
&gt; of the time opt to get on the computer in my room,<br/>
&gt; with the door closed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, they are by themselves most of the evenings when<br/>
you do your food buying club/emailing/internet<br/>
searches, plus also by themselves for an hour to an<br/>
hour and a half each morning while you do email and<br/>
internet searching?  This seems like a lot of time<br/>
that you are on the computer, away from them.<br/>
<br/>
Can you work with the door open?  Can the computer be<br/>
in the main part of the house?  How much time do you<br/>
really NEED each day on the computer?  Does the<br/>
computer suck you in (such as you said about the TV)? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, I don&#39;t interact with them as much as I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt; to, but when I do, I am easily <br/>
&gt; bored by what they do, or I am yelling at them to<br/>
&gt; stop fighting <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you not able to come up with fun ideas they might<br/>
like (and might not bore you)?  And with the things<br/>
that they like, that just continue to bore you, get<br/>
over it!  It is a lot about perspective on things. <br/>
It&#39;s not like a girlfriend of yours who might invite<br/>
you to a play that you might think would be boring so<br/>
you decline the invitation...these are your children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when I try to discuss stuff that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; interesting to me, they are <br/>
&gt; bored with that! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you speaking about adult type stuff that lots of<br/>
kids don&#39;t have an interest in?  Or kid type ideas<br/>
that you think might be fun?  <br/>
<br/>
If it is adult type stuff, don&#39;t be surprised that<br/>
they don&#39;t have an interest in it.  If is kid type<br/>
stuff, try even more ideas.  Pay attention to your<br/>
children to REALLY get to know them, so that your<br/>
ideas will be more likely to click with them.<br/>
<br/>
What are you own interests?  It&#39;s good to share your<br/>
own interest with them and just because you are<br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have things that<br/>
you enjoy.  Here is a great article about how a mom<br/>
shares her interests with her kids:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strew/ren">http://sandradodd.com/strew/ren</a><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So we usually go our own ways, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a very HANDS ON approach to living.  To<br/>
unschool, you must be actively engaged with your<br/>
children.  I&#39;m not saying that every minute needs to<br/>
be together, but the fact that your family usually<br/>
goes their own way and your children are so young<br/>
still tells me that something might be missing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much<br/>
&gt; learning. I do interact with them <br/>
&gt; when they come to me, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to me that you might be viewing unschooling<br/>
soley as child-led.  While aspects of unschooling are<br/>
child-led, I really don&#39;t prefer that term, because it<br/>
makes it appear that unschooling is only about the<br/>
child coming to you, the child coming up with all the<br/>
ideas.  It&#39;s not just them coming to you, it&#39;s also<br/>
you going to them.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good that you interact with them, but you need to<br/>
interact even more.  Have you ever heard someone say<br/>
that parents who unschool are &quot;tour guides&quot;, rather<br/>
than teachers.  Are you being a good tour guide?  Are<br/>
you providing them everything they need to live a<br/>
rich, exciting, fullfilling life?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I let them watch videos for hours,<br/>
&gt; play video games for hours <br/>
&gt; too, as long as they want, but am I providing enough<br/>
&gt; interesting alternatives <br/>
&gt; for them? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, letting them play video games and watch their<br/>
videos as much as they like is wonderful.  BUT, if a<br/>
child doesn&#39;t have enough other choices and a parent<br/>
who doesn&#39;t keep things interesting and fun, then that<br/>
can be all that they will do, because they don&#39;t have<br/>
other options.  <br/>
<br/>
You tell us, are you providing enough other<br/>
alternatives?  Is there plenty of books, toys,<br/>
puzzles, games, arts &#39;n&#39; craft materials, coloring<br/>
books, outdoor items, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
By reading your post, I will say that I think there is<br/>
room for improvement on your part.  I think you could<br/>
be more involved with them.  But I also think that you<br/>
know that (by the tone of your post).  I think you are<br/>
on your way to getting it right, but that you might<br/>
need to learn more about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read about strewing?  If not, you will want<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What first struck me about your post was that you<br/>
&gt; considered the time<br/>
&gt; your kids were watching TV to be your &quot;free time.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While it can happen that kids are ok watching TV for<br/>
&gt; a time while a<br/>
&gt; parent does something else if your kids are fighting<br/>
&gt; this shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; your free time.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You might find free time when your kids are asleep<br/>
&gt; or when your partner<br/>
&gt; can be with the kids or you might not get much or<br/>
&gt; any free time until<br/>
&gt; your kids are older.   But the goal of unschooling<br/>
&gt; is not to find<br/>
&gt; convenient free time for mom.  So maybe you need to<br/>
&gt; reassess your<br/>
&gt; priorities and think about whether unschooling is a<br/>
&gt; deeply held<br/>
&gt; belief/philosophy for you or just why you chose this<br/>
&gt; path. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have a like minded partner maybe your best<br/>
&gt; hope for finding some<br/>
&gt; free time at this stage in your kids lives would be<br/>
&gt; those times when your<br/>
&gt; partner can devote attention to the kids.   You<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t ever get these same<br/>
&gt; kids at this same age again and if your priority is<br/>
&gt; finding time for<br/>
&gt; yourself you&#39;ll be missing the joy of five and nine<br/>
&gt; year olds and you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; be cheating your kids.  I don&#39;t actually believe<br/>
&gt; your priority is to find<br/>
&gt; free time.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***I rarely watch T.V. with the kids. They mostly<br/>
&gt; watch videos which<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t interest <br/>
&gt; me at all and the only actual &quot;T.V.&quot; we have is PBS<br/>
&gt; because we don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; cable and either the shows interest them and not<br/>
&gt; me***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Successful unschooling and a strong relationship<br/>
&gt; with your kids will<br/>
&gt; absolutely require you to be interested in what<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re doing.  You don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to like cyberchase but you can watch with them<br/>
&gt; and talk to them and<br/>
&gt; discover why *they* like cyberchase.  That&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; important thing here. <br/>
&gt; Not that *you* like their programs but that you like<br/>
&gt; to be with your<br/>
&gt; kids, that you like to see their enthusiasm and<br/>
&gt; enjoyment. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One possible step toward finding shows you all enjoy<br/>
&gt; would be more<br/>
&gt; options.  If you&#39;re limiting their options on<br/>
&gt; purpose I don&#39;t think you<br/>
&gt; should complain that you don&#39;t enjoy the shows<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re choosing. &lt;g&gt;   I<br/>
&gt; recommend getting more channels and then maybe<br/>
&gt; another TV so that even<br/>
&gt; more options are available to all of you.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***I usually 99% of the time opt to get on the<br/>
&gt; computer in my room, with<br/>
&gt; the door closed.***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are blocking your children out.  Are you<br/>
&gt; depressed?  Are you in a<br/>
&gt; rut?   You need to be with them.  Children run<br/>
&gt; around and play loudly,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s what they do.  What&#39;s stopping you from<br/>
&gt; playing with them?   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***I don&#39;t interact with them as much as I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt; to, but when I do, I am<br/>
&gt; easily <br/>
&gt; bored by what they do,***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Get over it.  I know that sounds harsh but your<br/>
&gt; children need you to be<br/>
&gt; involved with them.  You can suggest games and shows<br/>
&gt; you might all enjoy.<br/>
&gt;  You can bake cookies, have a mashed potato fight,<br/>
&gt; have a water balloon<br/>
&gt; fight, paint the sidewalk.   Do you need a list of<br/>
&gt; fun things to offer<br/>
&gt; and do with your kids?  People here could brainstorm<br/>
&gt; for you. <br/>
&gt; But you should be interacting with them when they<br/>
&gt; are doing the things<br/>
&gt; they enjoy.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***or I am yelling at them to stop fighting (I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; working on <br/>
&gt; the yelling issue, so more and more, I&#39;m talking to<br/>
&gt; them constructively<br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; they disputes!)***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s good that your working on the yelling.  I<br/>
&gt; recommend you stop yelling<br/>
&gt; at once. &lt;g&gt;  As the great Yoda says &quot;Do or do not,<br/>
&gt; there is no try.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some constructive talk might be ok as long as<br/>
&gt; constructive talk isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; code for lecturing.  But at five and nine they need<br/>
&gt; you mostly to fix the<br/>
&gt; problem.  What are the usual problems between them? <br/>
&gt; Is one invading the<br/>
&gt; space of the other?  What is going on with them? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***when I try to discuss stuff that&#39;s interesting to<br/>
&gt; me, they are <br/>
&gt; bored with that! ***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are they mirroring your boredom with their shows and<br/>
&gt; games?   I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think you can expect them to show an interest in<br/>
&gt; what you&#39;re doing and in<br/>
&gt; what you enjoy if you are not showing an interest in<br/>
&gt; their activities. <br/>
&gt; You need to be an interested person for others to be<br/>
&gt; interested in you.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It sounds like you are disconnected from your kids. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***If they come to me saying they are bored, which<br/>
&gt; often happens on the<br/>
&gt; day we <br/>
&gt; stay home, I tell them boredom is wonderful, that it<br/>
&gt; helps you to be<br/>
&gt; creative <br/>
&gt; and I send them off to be bored elsewhere, so I can<br/>
&gt; get some work<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; They&#39;re asking you for help and you&#39;re refusing.  <br/>
&gt; What are you there<br/>
&gt; for?  Seriously.  Anyone could come into your house<br/>
&gt; and cook and clean,<br/>
&gt; so why are *you* there? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For unschooling to be successful you will need to be<br/>
&gt; involved with your<br/>
&gt; children.  That means helping them live and play<br/>
&gt; happily, helping them<br/>
&gt; find things they love, helping them solve problems. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you went to your partner and said you were bored<br/>
&gt; how would you feel if<br/>
&gt; your partner said, essentially, &quot;go away and be<br/>
&gt; bored somewhere else.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; How many times could someone you love do that to you<br/>
&gt; before you started<br/>
&gt; to feel like you weren&#39;t important to them at all?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ***So, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much<br/>
&gt; learning.***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t try to get your kids to do things they are not<br/>
&gt; interested in.  If<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t like the library don&#39;t offer to take them<br/>
&gt; there.   (Library&#39;s<br/>
&gt; have more than books though.  They have music,<br/>
&gt; videos, audio books)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go to the park, take a lunch, take a kite, a ball, a<br/>
&gt; Frisbee.   Go for a<br/>
&gt; walk, collect leaves, rocks, bugs.  Go for a hike,<br/>
&gt; take food, ford<br/>
&gt; streams, catch frogs, take pictures.   Go to the<br/>
&gt; pool, take water toys,<br/>
&gt; play.  Get squirt guns and blast each other.  Make<br/>
&gt; up a wavy dance or a<br/>
&gt; swishy dance or a &quot;bees are stinging my butt&quot; dance.<br/>
&gt;  Play games.  Some<br/>
&gt; games that can be played with little kids are: <br/>
&gt; Mancalla, Set, Racko,<br/>
&gt; Target, Five Crowns, Checkers, Clue, Tic Tac Toe,<br/>
&gt; Life, Survival or<br/>
&gt; Extinction (dinosaur game) Chinese Checkers, Flinch,<br/>
&gt; Sorry.   Play Mad<br/>
&gt; Libs, ask your kids for silly word and then read<br/>
&gt; them the resulting<br/>
&gt; story.    Have &quot;Monster Movie Night&quot; rent old<br/>
&gt; monster movies and make<br/>
&gt; popcorn and stomp around like Godzilla.   Go out for<br/>
&gt; french fries.  Go<br/>
&gt; out for ice cream.  Run races, ride bikes, go<br/>
&gt; sledding, ice skating,<br/>
&gt; roller skating.  Go play miniature golf.  Go<br/>
&gt; bowling. <br/>

I agree with the responses you have already received, but wanted to <br/>
add that you might read Playful Parenting by Leonard Cohen. He has <br/>
many ideas that may help you get over the hump of not enjoying play or <br/>
not feeling like you know *how* to play with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t read it when you could be hanging out with them!<br/>

she went to ps in 2nd and asked to be homeschooled<br/>
again, so we unschooled last year and this is our 3rd<br/>
year, but 2nd in a row. My ds went to p/t preschool<br/>
for 1 year, the year my dd was in 2nd grade and hated<br/>
it, so other than that we&#39;ve unschooled/been at home<br/>
together since his birth.<br/>

&gt; laugh and be connected.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is your enthusiasm genuine? What if I don&#39;t feel that?<br/>
Should I just do it anyway? Will it just happen<br/>
eventually? Do you think I shouldn&#39;t homeschool if I<br/>
can&#39;t feel that kind of enthusiasm? Are they better<br/>
off in school?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; coloring pages and <br/>
&gt; some cool markers, sometimes a big bowl of rice<br/>
&gt; mixed with glitter, <br/>
&gt; or shells, or a cool book, or some neat fabric. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do your kids help you clean up after playing with all<br/>
that? I can barely do the regular housekeeping (and<br/>
what I do have time to do housekeeping-wise is very<br/>
minimal!) and whenever we do an art project, I can&#39;t<br/>
get the kids to help clean up. I&#39;ve explained to them<br/>
that we would do more of this sort of thing if we<br/>
could clean up together, as a team, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to motivate them. Am I expecting too much to ask<br/>
them for help?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What do you think is enough? If I spent one hour a day<br/>
with them on a project is that enough? Or does that<br/>
not even begin to be enough? 3 hours? more?<br/>
Can you give me an idea of how much time you spend?<br/>
What happens when your own soul hasn&#39;t been<br/>
replenished and you&#39;ve got nothing left to give?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, lastly, I *do* watch Cyberchase<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m happy to announce to you all that I&#39;ve been<br/>
watching some T.V. with them, including Cyberchase and<br/>
talking with them about it. Does it count if I bring<br/>
carrots to peel with me etc... to do while I watch?<br/>
Also, I played with them with a huge box of popscicle<br/>
sticks for a while and they had a blast with that. We<br/>
built a city on our dining room table. But eventually<br/>
I had to leave to cook dinner and they continued, I<br/>
only spent about 1/2 an hour.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Peace~Jessica <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Jessica, as you can see I have many more<br/>
questions, if you have time to respond, That would be<br/>
great! And btw, everyone&#39;s in bed now, so I&#39;m not at<br/>
my computer while the kids are needing me! ;oD<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What first struck me about your post was that you<br/>
&gt; considered the time<br/>
&gt; your kids were watching TV to be your &quot;free time.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While it can happen that kids are ok watching TV for<br/>
&gt; a time while a<br/>
&gt; parent does something else if your kids are fighting<br/>
&gt; this shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; your free time.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I need some time management tips from you<br/>
guys, because I am already struggling to fit in<br/>
everything that needs to get done like food prep,<br/>
picking up the house, occasionally but rarely cleaning<br/>
the house (seriously I am not a neat freak, I really<br/>
rarely clean!), laundry, dishes, food shopping, paying<br/>
bills, running the buying club etc...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You might find free time when your kids are asleep<br/>
&gt; or when your partner<br/>
&gt; can be with the kids or you might not get much or<br/>
&gt; any free time until<br/>
&gt; your kids are older.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband has been working a LOT lately, always has<br/>
been a workaholic, for not much pay either! He was<br/>
working 7 days a week for a while, 3 days at 14 hour<br/>
shift (2 diff. jobs) so the only way I could take care<br/>
of me and nurture myself was to do it with the kids<br/>
around. Not having ANY free time until they are older<br/>
doesn&#39;t sounf healthy to me, are you sure? I tend to<br/>
just get grumpier and grumpier until I get a break,<br/>
doesn&#39;t everyone need a break form being with other<br/>
people, kids or adults? I consider myself to be very<br/>
social, but even I need breaks!<br/>
Now that my husband has a more normal schedule, I<br/>
expect to not need so much &quot;free time&quot; while the kids<br/>
are around.<br/>
Also, I notice that if I don&#39;t get a certain amount of<br/>
time to myself to pursue my interests, I suffer from<br/>
insomnia. I lay in bed for hours thinking about what I<br/>
want to do, or I get up and write or read or get on<br/>
the computer and accomplish some of the stuff. But if<br/>
I don&#39;t do this, I still don&#39;t get to sleep until 3, 4<br/>
or sometimes even 5am!<br/>
<br/>
 But the goal of unschooling<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is not to find<br/>
&gt; convenient free time for mom.  So maybe you need to<br/>
&gt; reassess your<br/>
&gt; priorities and think about whether unschooling is a<br/>
&gt; deeply held<br/>
&gt; belief/philosophy for you or just why you chose this<br/>
&gt; path. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I chose this path because I believe it is the best way<br/>
to learn! I want the best for my kids as do we all,<br/>
and I truly believe that their needs are not met by<br/>
schools, especially public schools and when i tried<br/>
doing school-at-home it was a complete and utter<br/>
failure! Then I discovered unschooling, but even that<br/>
isn&#39;t quite working. I am lost and confused! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your priority is to find<br/>
&gt; free time.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, you&#39;re right, my priority is my kids, but how to<br/>
put that into practice? It&#39;s easier said than done.<br/>
But I want concrete suggestions on how to do it. I&#39;ll<br/>
try waht you guys suggest!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Successful unschooling and a strong relationship<br/>
&gt; with your kids will<br/>
&gt; absolutely require you to be interested in what<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re doing.  You don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to like cyberchase but you can watch with them<br/>
&gt; and talk to them and<br/>
&gt; discover why *they* like cyberchase.  That&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; important thing here. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, I&#39;ve started doing that, thank you for the<br/>
suggestion!<br/>
More suggestions are welcome and needed!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One possible step toward finding shows you all enjoy<br/>
&gt; would be more<br/>
&gt; options.  If you&#39;re limiting their options on<br/>
&gt; purpose I don&#39;t think you<br/>
&gt; should complain that you don&#39;t enjoy the shows<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re choosing. &lt;g&gt;   I<br/>
&gt; recommend getting more channels and then maybe<br/>
&gt; another TV so that even<br/>
&gt; more options are available to all of you.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have cable for 2 reasons:<br/>
1. to save money<br/>
2. We have noticed a direct corralation between the<br/>
violence on the shows that my son (5 yo) watches and<br/>
the violence he uses to vent his frustrations. So<br/>
after trying the radical unschooling idea of letting<br/>
them chose thir own shows for about 2 years, we<br/>
finally gave that up and started limiting what he<br/>
could watch.<br/>
We do however have a pass at blockbuster and get a lot<br/>
of videos.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You are blocking your children out.  Are you<br/>
&gt; depressed? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting that you ask this!<br/>
Yes, I do suffer on and off with depression and have<br/>
for years. I was on medication for years, I have<br/>
received and continue to receive counseling, have made<br/>
huge changes in my diet to improve this, but still<br/>
occasionally get really depressed.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you in a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rut?   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well that too! I&#39;ve had a lot of health challenges for<br/>
the past 2-3 years, my father died of cancer a year<br/>
ago this month and I&#39;ve been close to a divorce<br/>
several times in the past couple years, but continue<br/>
to take steps to try to save my marriage.<br/>
<br/>
You need to be with them.  Children run<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; around and play loudly,<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s what they do.  What&#39;s stopping you from<br/>
&gt; playing with them?   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a condition with my ears called Hyperacusis<br/>
which is abnormal sensitivity to everyday sound levels<br/>
or noises, I am especially very sensitivity to high<br/>
pitched sounds. But your bringing this up has<br/>
motivated me to look into this further to see if it<br/>
can be treated. When I was diagnosed with it, the<br/>
doctor said there wasn&#39;t anything that could be done,<br/>
but my faith in doctors is very shaky, so I will do<br/>
some research to see if there is a treatment!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; ***I don&#39;t interact with them as much as I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt; to, but when I do, I am<br/>
&gt; easily <br/>
&gt; bored by what they do,***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Do you need a list of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fun things to offer<br/>
&gt; and do with your kids?  People here could brainstorm<br/>
&gt; for you. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, yes yes! Please, could you all throw out<br/>
suggestions? I would LOVE that! I promise to try them!<br/>
You won&#39;t be wasting your time!<br/>
<br/>
As the great Yoda says &quot;Do or do not,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there is no try.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but did Yoda have kids??? ;oD Just kidding, I<br/>
know what you&#39;re saying, but the best I can manage<br/>
right now is to do less and less yelling and hope it<br/>
will eventually be easier.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Some constructive talk might be ok as long as<br/>
&gt; constructive talk isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; code for lecturing. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, not lecturing, we are learning Nonviolent<br/>
Communication!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It sounds like you are disconnected from your kids. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I am! How do I reconnect with them before it&#39;s<br/>
too late? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They&#39;re asking you for help and you&#39;re refusing.  <br/>
&gt; What are you there<br/>
&gt; for?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>O.K. the next time they say they are bored, I&#39;ll<br/>
surprise the hell out of them because I&#39;ll say &quot;O.K.<br/>
let&#39;s find something to do together!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Seriously.  Anyone could come into your house<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and cook and clean,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But nobody does!!!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so why are *you* there? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes I wonder that myself! It contributes to my<br/>
depression. I feel useless, easily replaced by someone<br/>
who could do a much better job than me. I sometimes<br/>
wonder if my family would do better without me. But<br/>
then I remember that  if I wasn&#39;t around, my husband<br/>
would have the kids in public school so fast their<br/>
heads would be spinning and their souls certainly<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be fed there! So I&#39; here!!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For unschooling to be successful you will need to be<br/>
&gt; involved with your<br/>
&gt; children.  That means helping them live and play<br/>
&gt; happily, helping them<br/>
&gt; find things they love, helping them solve problems. <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I was wondering if I might be doing it wrong!<br/>
:o)<br/>
Hence my e-mail to you guys, asking for help.<br/>
So here is the beginning of the attempt to do it<br/>
right!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you went to your partner and said you were bored<br/>
&gt; how would you feel if<br/>
&gt; your partner said, essentially, &quot;go away and be<br/>
&gt; bored somewhere else.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well that happens actually, I think he&#39;d rather do<br/>
stuff with the kids than spend time with me, but we&#39;re<br/>
working on that one...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How many times could someone you love do that to you<br/>
&gt; before you started<br/>
&gt; to feel like you weren&#39;t important to them at all?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see what you mean!<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ***So, as you can see, I am not facilitaing much<br/>
&gt; learning.***<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Play games.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for the long list of suggestions of things<br/>
to do, I will do some. Am I not a good candidate for<br/>
homeschooling if I rarely enjoy these things? I think<br/>
I would like them if there was another adult doing<br/>
them with me, but that is a problem in my life, always<br/>
needing other adults around, not really being with my<br/>
kids. I&#39;m wondering if they would actually be better<br/>
off in school?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any time you have to respond to some of my<br/>
questions, I really appreciate the thought provoking!<br/>
I am doing some deep deep self examining here.<br/>

this in and think that the only thing that can give is<br/>
computer time, but I&#39;m not sure what to cut out! I&#39;ll<br/>
do it though, for my kids!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you work with the door open?  Can the computer<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems to me that you might be viewing unschooling<br/>

&gt; are<br/>
&gt; child-led, I really don&#39;t prefer that term, because<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; makes it appear that unschooling is only about the<br/>
&gt; child coming to you, the child coming up with all<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; ideas.  It&#39;s not just them coming to you, it&#39;s also<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You hit the nail on the head! That&#39;s what I thought<br/>
unschooling was. Waiting until my kids come to me and<br/>
ask specifically for what they want me to do and meet<br/>
those needs as best I can. Is that not right!? It<br/>
certainly hasn&#39;t been working for us!  Wow, I can see<br/>
why my daughter wants to go back to school! So I&#39;ll<br/>
work on this!<br/>
<br/>
 Have you ever heard someone say<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that parents who unschool are &quot;tour guides&quot;, rather<br/>
&gt; than teachers.  Are you being a good tour guide? <br/>
&gt; Are<br/>

&gt; rich, exciting, fullfilling life?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No I hadn&#39;t heard the &quot;tour Guide&quot; analogy, thanks,<br/>
that helps!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You tell us, are you providing enough other<br/>

&gt; books, outdoor items, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, so I guess I&#39;ll do the rounds at the thrift<br/>
stores, but I hate shopping at thrift stores!!!<br/>
(Actually I hate shopping period!)<br/>
I know I know, it&#39;s not about ME, it&#39;s for the kids!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187913288">&lt;&lt;Do your kids help you clean up after playing with all<br/>
that? I can barely do the regular housekeeping (and<br/>
what I do have time to do housekeeping-wise is very<br/>
minimal!) and whenever we do an art project, I can&#39;t<br/>
get the kids to help clean up. I&#39;ve explained to them<br/>
that we would do more of this sort of thing if we<br/>
could clean up together, as a team, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to motivate them. Am I expecting too much to ask<br/>
them for help?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids make huge project messes, they help clean up some, but I also<br/>
help and I am able to do a larger share because I am faster and more<br/>
efficient at this point. I still ask them to do certain things like, &quot;please<br/>
put the marker tub back on the shelf.&quot;  I don&#39;t just leave them to clean it<br/>
up alone or to figure out what to clean.  Looking at big messes is<br/>
overwhelming to me so I know it must be for the kids too.  Giving specific<br/>
suggestions helps.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; make sure that they <br/>
&gt; have had *enough* of other things in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you think is enough? If I spent one hour a day<br/>
with them on a project is that enough? Or does that<br/>
not even begin to be enough? 3 hours? more?<br/>
Can you give me an idea of how much time you spend?<br/>
What happens when your own soul hasn&#39;t been<br/>
replenished and you&#39;ve got nothing left to give?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It really depends on the kids.  Have they gone a while not feeling like<br/>
they&#39;ve had enough?  If they have, they will be more needy for a while than<br/>
a child who has felt they have had enough.  I spend the bulk of my day doing<br/>
things with my kids.  We often eat a dinner that takes only minutes to cook<br/>
and the basics really don&#39;t take long.  My standards aren&#39;t very high when<br/>
it comes to a clean house anymore.  They used to be higher but I&#39;ve let them<br/>
slide in order to do more with the kids.  Some day they&#39;ll be gone and my<br/>
house will be neater then.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m happy to announce to you all that I&#39;ve been<br/>
watching some T.V. with them, including Cyberchase and<br/>
talking with them about it. Does it count if I bring<br/>
carrots to peel with me etc... to do while I watch?<br/>
Also, I played with them with a huge box of popscicle<br/>
sticks for a while and they had a blast with that. We<br/>
built a city on our dining room table. But eventually<br/>
I had to leave to cook dinner and they continued, I<br/>
only spent about 1/2 an hour.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you are on your way.  I don&#39;t see anything wrong with multi<br/>
tasking.  I occasionally knit while I watch TV, with or without the kids.  I<br/>
think playing something for half an hour is a great start.  But keep in mind<br/>
that you chose to go cook dinner, you didn&#39;t have to.  You could choose to<br/>
have cereal and raw carrots for supper or something else that is quick.<br/>
Often my kids would rather eat something fast and have more of my time.<br/>
People who feel like they *have to do something often feel like victims but<br/>
in reality they are making choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389064650">&lt;&lt;Do you mind sharing with me how much time you spend on<br/>
the computer each day? I am wondering how to fit all<br/>
this in and think that the only thing that can give is<br/>
computer time, but I&#39;m not sure what to cut out! I&#39;ll<br/>
do it though, for my kids!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It varies widely.  Probably from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on<br/>
the day.  This morning so far, I have spent 30 minutes and I am about done.<br/>
(turned into almost an hour before I finished this email)(I&#39;ll answer this<br/>
email then go exercise.)  I woke up at 6:45, made coffee and my 10 yo<br/>
watched Arthur (which I&#39;ve watched with her many times over the years but<br/>
don&#39;t regularly anymore) and I got on the computer and drank coffee.  I had<br/>
instructions from my 9 yo to wake her at 7:30.  I just did a few minutes ago<br/>
and we spent 10 minutes cuddling in her bed.  <br/>
<br/>
Now we are downstairs.  Dh is on his computer (with all of us gathered<br/>
around, mine is next to his-actually, we have 4 in a row, one for each of<br/>
us) showing us all a satellite site and you can see our house and all our<br/>
neighbors&#39; houses.  It is cool.  (now I am getting up to get dd a<br/>
poptart)(and while I was out there I put the rest of last night&#39;s dirty<br/>
dishes in the dishwasher and started it)(and this is getting long).  Younger<br/>
dd is now checking her email.  After I exercise, I&#39;ll help the kids get<br/>
dressed and hair brushed so we can go to the barn where we board our horses<br/>
and they will ride and we&#39;ll all shovel stalls, etc.  This afternoon we&#39;ll<br/>
grab a quick lunch and spend the rest of the afternoon getting ready for a<br/>
horse show they are going to be in tomorrow.  I have costumes to work on and<br/>
supplies to gather.  If I get another load of dishes put in the dishwasher<br/>
and the other load put away, I&#39;ll feel pretty good about my house today.<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get back on the computer this afternoon and evening too, as<br/>
well as watch some Tv with the kids and maybe fit in a game or two.  Also<br/>
we&#39;ll go back to the barn at feeding time and bring the horses in and feed<br/>
them and help out more.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know really, what is a reasonable, healthy<br/>
amount of time?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It depends.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How much time do you feel I should spend with the kids<br/>
each day on average to make unschooling an option for<br/>
us?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A lot.  Many hours at your kids ages. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You hit the nail on the head! That&#39;s what I thought<br/>
unschooling was. Waiting until my kids come to me and<br/>
ask specifically for what they want me to do and meet<br/>
those needs as best I can. Is that not right!? It<br/>
certainly hasn&#39;t been working for us!  Wow, I can see<br/>
why my daughter wants to go back to school! So I&#39;ll<br/>
work on this!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s about providing them with a rich environment and an interesting life.<br/>
Give them some jumping off points to discover new things. <br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;No I hadn&#39;t heard the &quot;tour Guide&quot; analogy, thanks,<br/>
that helps!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like the term facilitator.<br/>
<br/>
Got to run.<br/>

honest.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only you can tell that, but if unschooling is what you want to do and <br/>
you focus most of your energy on connecting with your children, you <br/>
will find your own answer to this question.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I have been finding that enthusiasm is &quot;catching&quot;, but some <br/>
one needs to start it.  Sometimes, I am faking, but usually only a <br/>
little and only for the beginning, because I can&#39;t fool my children.  <br/>
There are loads of things that I put out that they don&#39;t care for, <br/>
and I have to be a little thick-skinned about that, too, if *my* <br/>
enthusiasm was real.<br/>
<br/>
***Do your kids help you clean up after playing with all<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that? ***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No.  They are 8 and 3, and they don&#39;t help.  Actually, since my 3 <br/>
y.o. is a neat child by nature, he is more helpful than my 8 y.o., <br/>
but it is three year old help &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
My house is usually messy, since I am not as organized as I&#39;d like. I <br/>
actually have found flylady.net to be helpful with getting organized <br/>
and keeping house.  Since I was raised to be a career/thinking woman, <br/>
by a thinking/career woman who didn&#39;t value home making, I really <br/>
don&#39;t know how to clean or when or why or anything.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I do lose it and tell them I need some help because <br/>
the &quot;stuff&quot; everywhere is geting to me.  Sometimes I just tell my <br/>
husband this.  But those occurances are rare.  Mostly, we live in <br/>
house that looks like there are two active kids and dog and a cat and <br/>
a turtle and a fish and a mom and a dad and friends and family who <br/>
eat and create and play and live.<br/>
<br/>
I try to see the Joy of projects as a gift for my children, with no <br/>
strings attached.<br/>
<br/>
***What do you think is enough? ***<br/>
<br/>
For us, this varies day to day.  I will say, tho, that in the <br/>
beginning, it was most of the time my children were awake.  My <br/>
children really tested whether it was true that were going to play <br/>
together.  But, also, my kids will only spend 1/2 hour or so on any <br/>
one thing.  My daughter would be with me 24/7~never be alone playing, <br/>
literally.  Since she learned to tell time, this has been easier, <br/>
because I will say, &quot;After 15 minutes to check my email, I will get <br/>
out the sewing stuff&quot; or &quot;At 1 o&#39;clock, I&#39;ll try to give your brother <br/>
a nap, can we (do whatever) then when we have some time together?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
***Can you give me an idea of how much time you spend?***<br/>
<br/>
My daughter likes to play Barbies.  I didn&#39;t even have any growing <br/>
up, they don&#39;t interest me, and when I do play with them I am  <br/>
ridiculous in my play to keep myself entertained (for instance, <br/>
Barbie leaves Ken to start an anarchist revolution that frees all the <br/>
little Barbies, whatever they are called :D).<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t work for my daughter, who is much more traditional in <br/>
her story-telling. &lt;g&gt;. I told her that I love to *hear* her stories <br/>
with Barbie (which I *DO*), so most of the time, I will lie on her <br/>
bed (yay!) or put away laundry in her room (less yay~but still good!) <br/>
while she plays and tells her stories.  Sometimes, I can even go in <br/>
to the bathroom across the hall and clean it while I am listening.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, my kids don&#39;t see book reading as making me as <br/>
unavailable to them as the computer, and I can bring a book into <br/>
where they are playing.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents I know listen to a music tape on head phones while <br/>
sitting on the couch reading while their kids watch tv.  I can&#39;t have <br/>
that much input going on around me, but it might work for you.<br/>
<br/>
I find that the beginning of the day connection is the most <br/>
imnportant one for us.  If I really fully give time then, I can <br/>
be &quot;freed&quot; up a little later on. <br/>
<br/>
***What happens when your own soul hasn&#39;t been<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; replenished and you&#39;ve got nothing left to give?***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a real problem.  I am constantly trying to find this balance <br/>
for myself.  Last night~from 8:30-closing, I went to Borders <br/>
Bookstore (they are open until 10) with another mom and her <br/>
daughter.  The kids played and we chatted.  It was great, and the <br/>
other mom&#39;s idea, but I think I will suggest it again.<br/>
<br/>
If I fully commit to replenshing my own self, it doesn&#39;t take much <br/>
time or money.  If I am snatching time at the computer or on the <br/>
phone, or whatever, it doesn&#39;t work as well, and can waste hours. But <br/>
if I say to my husband, I am taking a bath, and go alone and sit in <br/>
hot water, I can feel better in minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I like to go to the bookstore alone, too, in the evening for a hour <br/>
and look at a huge stack of books (landscaping books are calling me <br/>
lately) and drink a &quot;special&quot; coffee drink.  I have only done that <br/>
twice in the last four months, but it was great, inexpensive, and I <br/>
know I *could* do it again if I needed to.<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m happy to announce to you all that I&#39;ve been<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; watching some T.V. with them, including Cyberchase and<br/>
&gt; talking with them about it. ***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yippee! Hooray!  You might even find you start to like some of this <br/>
stuff!!<br/>
<br/>
***Does it count if I bring<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; carrots to peel with me etc... to do while I watch?***<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think so.  When we go out somewhere, especially with other <br/>
families, or when we are home for a while and into our own things (my <br/>
daughter&#39;s on the computer and I am reading, for example). I check in <br/>
a lot.  I learned this from Anne Ohman, but I pat my children, touch <br/>
their shoulders, kiss their heads, and tell them I love them.  It <br/>
connects us even when we are persuing separate agendas.  Sometimes, <br/>
it feels a little contrived, but it is becoming a habit.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend _The Intentional Family_ by William Doherty, as it <br/>
is mostly about creating rituals to connect the family, although <br/>
maybe I should read it again with unschooly eyes before I recommend <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Denise, I think that you are being very brave to ask all these <br/>
questions and take some seriously critical responses and keep digging <br/>
deeper.  Your children are lucky to have you seeking out answers to <br/>
make you lives full of Joy and Wonder.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094214726">** As the great Yoda says &quot;Do or do not,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; there is no try.&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think he had kids, that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
And when it comes to proposing fun activities to our kids, there is only <br/>
&quot;try&quot; and &quot;try again&quot;.  (There is no &quot;make them do&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
I have only one kid, and he prefers TV and videogaming over most arts <br/>
and crafts things and most outings.  Sometimes I get discouraged, and <br/>
it&#39;s easy for me to just assume that he won&#39;t want to go on the latest <br/>
field trip that I get emails about.  Sometimes I don&#39;t even bother to <br/>
ask -- but that&#39;s probably not the best policy.  I need to try to ask <br/>
more, but selectively more, not an overwhelming bombardment.<br/>
<br/>
What about really looking closely about what is working for you.  What <br/>
are the things that your kids enjoy the most?  And the second most?  Can <br/>
you do those more?  What are the things that you like to do with them?  <br/>
It&#39;s okay to pick things that are easy to set up and clean up.  Start <br/>
small if you have to, but move forwards.  (I think you already are.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope having your husband work less will mean that the kids can get <br/>
more adult attention without having to have all of it come from you.  It <br/>
sounds like you have been being stressed and unhappy, and that has been <br/>
leading you to shut down.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t know really, what is a reasonable, healthy<br/>
&gt; amount of time?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whatever doesn&#39;t interfere with what is a higher priority! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The thing I find compelling about the computer is that the &quot;tasks&quot;  <br/>
are neatly laid out and have clear beginnings and ends. For instance  <br/>
email is all neatly organized and you can go through them one by one.  <br/>
Games have clearly defined beginning and ends and specific tasks in  <br/>
the middle.<br/>
<br/>
But I think often the computer is filling a need without actually  <br/>
solving it. It would be nice to have life organized so we could go  <br/>
through each item one by one. But fulfilling that need by being on  <br/>
the computer doesn&#39;t make life organized. It just saps time from the  <br/>
rest of life. :-/<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How much time do you feel I should spend with the kids<br/>
&gt; each day on average to make unschooling an option for<br/>
&gt; us?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As much as *they* need. Sometimes we will need to say &quot;I need to get  <br/>
this done now so that will have to wait until later,&quot; but the less we  <br/>
say that, the more we *do* get back to them and do what we had to put  <br/>
off, the less needy they&#39;ll be.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are of course more needful of one on one than others but we  <br/>
can&#39;t make them less needy by not being available. We will make them  <br/>
more needy. The more often we say no to their requests, the more  <br/>
often we don&#39;t follow up and help them when we have time, the more  <br/>
often they have to ask to see if now is the right time. Putting them  <br/>
off just makes them ask more. Unless we&#39;ve put them off so much that  <br/>
they give up and know that Mom has more important things to do than  <br/>
be with them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Waiting until my kids come to me and<br/>
&gt; ask specifically for what they want me to do and meet<br/>
&gt; those needs as best I can. Is that not right!?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s better expressed not as waiting for them but listening  <br/>
to them when they do ask.  And &quot;asking&quot; might be in body language or  <br/>
in being interested in something. If, for instance, they like cats  <br/>
and you stumble across a video on cats, bring it home :-)<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, between them asking for things, you take them fun  <br/>
places, do fun things with them, offer them opportunities. Whether or  <br/>
not they take up the opportunities is up to them. Depends entirely on  <br/>
their interest. You also listen to them when they&#39;re engaged and keep  <br/>
out of their way.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we have to tend to life, like shopping, but we can make it  <br/>
fun for them too by taking them some place afterwards, having new  <br/>
snacks, giving them tasks to do like getting an item that matches a  <br/>
coupon and so on -- and sometimes by going shopping when they can  <br/>
stay home with dad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174634013">** I spend 2 or 3 hours but...**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say I spent 2 hours, on days we are home all day and not at the park <br/>
or at playdates.  But I spend it in chunks much less than an hour, and <br/>
my kid (11) seems to enjoy having me NOT talking to him and playing with <br/>
him all the time.<br/>
<br/>
(He&#39;s in his room now reading the latest Star Wars Cross Sections book.)<br/>
<br/>
**How much time do you feel I should spend with the kids each day on <br/>
average to make unschooling an option for us?**<br/>
<br/>
When my son was a toddler I spent all my time with him, or near him, at <br/>
least until my husband came home in the evening.  He needed less of my <br/>
time as he got older, and became noticeably more independent around age <br/>
7 or 8.<br/>
<br/>
As a *really* general rule I would think one should expect to spend less <br/>
than half of the day on one&#39;s own pursuits.  (Kids interests should be <br/>
more important than our own interests.  If all the time goes to us, that <br/>
seems iffy.)  When my son was an infant and then a toddler, the only <br/>
time available for my own pursuits was naptime, and back then my <br/>
favorite &quot;pursuit&quot; was sleeping, with sometimes a little reading thrown <br/>
in.  When he was 5 or 6 I could have some half hour chunks of time, <br/>
maybe a couple a day.  And when he was 7 and 8 he played for longer <br/>
periods by himself.  (An only child doesn&#39;t start too many fights with <br/>
his siblings! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
In the past year, I&#39;ve probably been able to find 6 hours a day (I know <br/>
it sounds shocking!) to &quot;do my own thing&quot; by myself, including <br/>
housework, but my son is 11, and is heavily into TV and computer games.  <br/>
I don&#39;t recommend this as the optimal time usage for building <br/>
relationships or for having a really rich life.  I&#39;m actively trying to <br/>
figure out how to make our life richer (without forcibly dragging my son <br/>
to the banquet).  I also try to check in with him frequently, esp. if <br/>
I&#39;ve been &quot;checked out&quot; for as long as an hour.<br/>
<br/>
General rule: younger kids need more time.  Kids who are asking for your <br/>
attention need more time.  Also possibly kids who are repeating one <br/>
activity a big percentage of the time (as at my house) need more <br/>
parental face time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS (I am going out for 6+ hours tomorrow and living my kid with his dad, <br/>
who is one of the great dads of all time.)  (No, I&#39;m not just saying <br/>
this to torture you. &lt;g&gt;) (Or to torture anybody else. This is not <br/>
something I did when he was younger.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42164312">Someone commented that it was a shame that Denise asked her questions <br/>
just as so many of the experienced unschoolers on this list were off to <br/>
conference. Well, I&#39;ve been homeschooling / unschooling for 19 years, <br/>
but don&#39;t often post - Sandra and Pam and Joyce and and... seem to say <br/>
it all before I even get the e-mails! (different time zone - I&#39;m in New <br/>
Zealand) this time I&#39;ve just been not well enough to spend time on the <br/>
computer but......<br/>
<br/>
Just had to say WOW!<br/>
<br/>
So many wonderful responses despite all those missing regulars! Well <br/>
done all.<br/>

&gt; I have only one kid, and he prefers TV and videogaming over most arts<br/>
&gt; and crafts things and most outings.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My now 18yo prefered outdoor stuff, birds, nature, didn&#39;t read till he <br/>
was 12 1/2, refused outright to do any art/craft activities.<br/>
<br/>
He now spends his free time (he works part time) drawing on the <br/>
computer, painting and drawing and sculpting etc. considers himself an <br/>
artist and looks forward to the time when he can support himself from <br/>
his art. Wouldn&#39;t have got to this point if I hadn&#39;t had art and craft <br/>
supplies lying around unused except by myself for years.<br/>
Times change, kids, like all people, change. Don&#39;t shut off any <br/>
opportunities just because they didn&#39;t appeal this week - or even this <br/>
decade!  I&#39;m just so glad I find it impossible to throw away art and <br/>
craft stuff!<br/>

Personally most of the questions I answer are to clarify my own  <br/>
thinking. I may believe something but I haven&#39;t really thought it  <br/>
through. But explaining it to someone else I find helps me figure out  <br/>
why I believe what I do :-)<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about lists as opposed to someone&#39;s website is the  <br/>
variety of experiences and viewpoints, not because someone can ask a  <br/>
question and get the answer written some mythical &quot;right&quot; way. We&#39;re  <br/>
all trying to help people get a good picture of something specific --  <br/>
the unschooling philosophy -- so they can figure out how to get  <br/>
there, but all our journeys will be different and will help different  <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
Just because Sandra and I respond to 90% of the questions that come  <br/>
through here shouldn&#39;t stop others from working through and posting  <br/>
their own understanding of the unschooling philosophy :-) I&#39;d love to  <br/>
see more of what everyone is writing more often :-)<br/>

Yes, a list or message board is much more helpful to me  than a website because of all the different journeys and thoughts you encounter. <br/>

At least half of my website consists of writings of other unschoolers,  <br/>
mostly from discussions like these (greatest hits).  Some of Joyce&#39;s has  quotes <br/>
from others too.  <br/>

Yes they do, which is probably why they&#39;ve both been helpful to me as <br/>
opposed to a web site that is made up of one persons opinion....which <br/>

I was referring to the yelling the mom said she was trying to stop.  When<br/>
the goal is a more peaceful home life trying to stop yelling is not as<br/>
good as stopping.    <br/>
<br/>
When kids are deschooling and a parent gets anxious and pulls out a<br/>
workbook the deschooling process is halted and must be started again from<br/>
the beginning.   When parents yell the peace and trust is broken and the<br/>
process has to start again.  <br/>

Betsy, my youngest son is almost 12, and he&#39;s the last one at home, and  this <br/>
is similar to our life, too.  He&#39;s busy doing his things and I do mine  and <br/>
we do some together, and we have regular rituals of connecting during the  day <br/>
that just developed over time.  We do go out a lot, though, and we bike  <br/>
together and do stuff like that.<br/>
 <br/>
But there are long periods of time during the day where we don&#39;t even talk  <br/>
to each other, and I can take a nap and wake up and he&#39;d never even know it, <br/>
and  he could cook himself a meal and I would never even know it.  We&#39;re happy  <br/>
this way.  He&#39;s no longer a toddler.  I think it&#39;s okay.<br/>
