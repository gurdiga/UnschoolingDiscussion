 </span></blockquote>You know you are from Da U.P. (Upper Peninsula of Michigan) when:<br/>
You can&#39;t understand how someone can complain about &#39;too much&#39; snow.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t describe how much snow there is, since it covers everything you need for a reference.<br/>
<br/>
You see a picture of anything and say &quot;It needs more trees.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know what a rutabaga is used for.<br/>
<br/>
Mosquitos don&#39;t bite, they take you back to the swamp to feed the bears.<br/>
<br/>
If you sleep in on the 4th of July, you miss the snow. (yes, that&#39;s SNOW, not SHOW)<br/>
<br/>
When you go out on the lake, it&#39;s with your car and a fishing pole, boats are not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Note: Being a farmer, I have a view that winter is there to remind us to do all the things we said we couldn&#39;t do because of the summer work. After having been around the world in the Navy, and living in different climates, I remember the advice of my Dad: &quot;I think cold is better than hot because if you are working in the cold, you can always put on more clothes, but in the heat, you can only take off so much.&quot;<br/>

Re: The TV discussion.<br/>
<br/>
We generally let the 4yo and 7yo watch whatever movies they like most, and some PBS shows that we will tape for them to watch when they can (I don&#39;t like to let someone else dictate my schedule, so why should the kids?), but generally not much with commercials. When the 7yo was 5, and we let her watch even a half hour of Sat morning, the next 2 weeks were filled with &quot;I want this, I want that&quot;. But when the commercials are avoided, her desires became more related to what she was playing with, and usually with a useful purpose in mind (I need a bed for my barbie&#39;s baby, etc.).<br/>
