<div id="ygrps-yiv-779603358">Does anyone here know who Jeva is?  She described herself on another list as <br/>
&quot;a former victim of Sandra Dodd&quot; and now she&#39;s telling people she doubts I <br/>
write my own essays.  That&#39;s probably actionable stuff, and I&#39;d like to know who <br/>
she is.  Since she won&#39;t even tell this list whether she&#39;s an unschooler, I&#39;m <br/>
assuming she&#39;s someone who&#39;s been here before and came back under another name.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think anyone will believe the doubt she is trying to cast on my <br/>
integrity?  It&#39;s a shame, character assassination just for personal amusement.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the quotes about the writings:<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, you have the right to say what you feel, and so do we. I stated  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what I felt about the possibility of Sandra not being the true author  <br/>
&gt; and I meant it. My comments are not a personal attack, but an honest  <br/>
&gt; take on my experience with the assumed author&#39;s personality and the  <br/>
&gt; contents of the articles. It&#39;s an opinion, not an insult.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>. . . .<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My comments, are no different that anyone who would review an article  <br/>
&gt; or it&#39;s author. I was actually neutral on the contents and all I  <br/>
&gt; stated was that I don&#39;t feel Sandra is the actual author. I may be  <br/>
&gt; wrong or right, but I  do have the right to question.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jeva<br/>

If anyone knows her real name, could you e-mail me on the side?  Accusations <br/>
that I have passed someone else&#39;s words off as my own (plagiarism) or taken <br/>
money on false pretenses (fraud) are pretty serious accusations.  Baseless, and <br/>
reckless, and they serve NO useful purpose for the accuser.<br/>
<br/>
MY real name is Sandra Dodd.  I&#39;ve never hidden.  <br/>
I&#39;ve never avoided direct questions about my children or my unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty sad that I&#39;m being attacked by a troublemaker in a disguise.  <br/>
<br/>
