<div id="ygrps-yiv-10733152">&lt;&lt; **If we&#39;re taking a leisurely whimsical ramble through the woods and <br/>
realize<br/>
there are milestones for a &quot;proper&quot; walk, what would be the reason for<br/>
checking our &quot;progress&quot; on the milestones if our walk was suiting our <br/>
needs?** &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or the zoo.<br/>
<br/>
People go the zoo and they pace themselves so they can see everything, <br/>
instead of deciding in advance what people want to see most, and just having <br/>
their lunch right there, in front of one of someone&#39;s favorites, and then <br/>
hotfooting it straight over to another favorite, and staying THERE long <br/>
enough to really watch.<br/>
<br/>
(I know some people don&#39;t like zoos, and I didn&#39;t intend to stir that up, but <br/>
we&#39;ve come to the point that we can&#39;t see the Rio Grande Zoo all in one day <br/>
anymore, and it matters to me personally now.)<br/>
