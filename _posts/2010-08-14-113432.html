It frequently happens that in the case of divorce, though, neither  <br/>
parent has as much leeway as before, and never as much as they  <br/>
potentially had as a couple.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a homeschooling (single) mother of 3 whose husband had a long-term  <br/>
affair and was only interested in blame (after 1 year of me trying  <br/>
everything I could find to repair our marriage (not knowing about the  <br/>
affair), including MUCH self-reflection and changing of my ways) my  <br/>
biggest fear was exactly what you write (that divorce is an  <br/>
unchangeable decline on all fronts, for both the parents and the  <br/>
children).  I am 4 years in to a divorce, and have learned that  <br/>
children desperately want their parents to love each other, respect  <br/>
each other, and love them.  This can be easily done within a divorce.   <br/>
They want them together also, and this will always be a source of  <br/>
grief for them, as this is what definitely changes.<br/>
<br/>
However, all is not bleak, and I write this for those of you that read  <br/>
the links posted in Sandra&#39;s e-mail and feel despair.  In my case, I  <br/>
have embraced single motherhood, and after a couple of years in  <br/>
school, my children came back home to me and we all love it.  I work  <br/>
part-time, have lots of energy for the kids, have a wonderful partner,  <br/>
and the kids&#39; father and I are very respectful and co-operative when  <br/>
it comes to the kids.  We compliment each other in front of the kids,  <br/>
support each others&#39; decisions when it comes to child-rearing, and I  <br/>
see the kids blossom when they know that their parents still love each  <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
This does not negate the pressure the kids feel having to live in 2  <br/>
homes; with 2 sets of rules; 2 step-parents whom they will never  <br/>
accept as their own (nor should they); constantly feeling a need to be  <br/>
all-inclusive, feeling guilty if they enjoy their step-parents&#39;  <br/>
company when the natural same-sex parent is not around.  It is a lot  <br/>
of stress for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
For me, what I have taken from this, is that is does take 2 to make a  <br/>
relationship work.  That if only one is busting their butt to heal  <br/>
what they can&#39;t even know is wrong within a relationship, although it  <br/>
is heroic (many have complimented me on my perserverance in my  <br/>
marriage) and admirable, and many Christians remained my friend  <br/>
because I wasn&#39;t the one who &quot;left&quot;, I often wonder why I didn&#39;t leave  <br/>
earlier.  The writing was on the wall, and I&#39;m not sure how much my  <br/>
kids benefitted from an extra year of their father being miserable at  <br/>
home, the unsaid tension as we all wondered what was wrong, my misery  <br/>
at not being able to reach him and figure out a way through and back  <br/>
to each other.  This will always remain a question, however, as I did  <br/>
not leave and I am also grateful that the kids had an extra year under  <br/>
their belt before they had to endure the stresses of separation.<br/>
<br/>
During this time, a therapist once said to me:  &quot;Just because 2 people  <br/>
are married and stay together, doesn&#39;t mean that they are happy&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No easy answers.<br/>

<br/>
While going through a lengthy divorce (and schooI issues) I quit my job and <br/>
pulled my kids out of school to do what I had always wanted to do - unschool <br/>
them!  They also had been through enough and my purpose was two fold.  They <br/>
needed to be home, healing.  Unschooling  - even after a nasty legal battle to <br/>
continue it - is in itself healing.  It is a long process undoing a way of life <br/>
that was ingrained to be &quot;the right way&quot;.  I have found in this culture it takes <br/>
strength and courage to follow my instincts to let my children discover life in <br/>
a gentle way, to give them the space and time to sit back and discover <br/>
themselves.  For me it is a constant joy watching them emerge from the cocoon <br/>
they had been locked in and become the amazing people they are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224540479">I&#39;m suggesting that the idea of change and improvement of one&#39;s life,  <br/>
through divorce, is also within the realm of possibility.  And, that  <br/>
if one is headed down the road of divorce, it&#39;s very easy to hear  <br/>
about how bad this is and to worry and to want it to be different -  <br/>
but the &quot;how&quot; of making a divorce as good as possible for kids is hard  <br/>
to find.<br/>
<br/>
However, saying that divorce will cause overall decline or improvement  <br/>
seems to simplify a complex web of change that occurs when one  <br/>
divorces.  Some fronts are initially more difficult (finances,  <br/>
possessions, change), some fronts are easier (possible decrease in  <br/>
marital tension, staking out of one&#39;s space, time to reflect).   And  <br/>
these changes are so unique to each circumstance and person that it is  <br/>
difficult to broadstroke it with better or worse.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly statistics can make divorce look dire and overall &quot;bad&quot;.   <br/>
But many divorce statistics do not reflect life quality.  There is an  <br/>
assumption between variables that are made.  (is - income=happiness)    <br/>
My income went down.  I live below the poverty line (as far as my  <br/>
income taxes are concerned).  However - we have all we need -  <br/>
vacations, lessons, clothing, etc.  I am creative with money.  There  <br/>
is no sense of lack.  Their father&#39;s income went up.  His household  <br/>
has all they need and more!!   And I still hear about his angry fits  <br/>
and see him stressed out and watch his weight fluctuate with his  <br/>
stress.  On paper this income change for me looks &quot;bad&quot; - but it&#39;s  <br/>
not.    Not even a little bit bad.  And I&#39;m not sure that we can  <br/>
definitively say that his income going up is &quot;good&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Also, statistics on how children fare after a divorce look bad too.   <br/>
But, in my experience, it&#39;s not just the divorce that affects them -  <br/>
it&#39;s how the adults around them handle the divorce and each other. I&#39;m  <br/>
not sure if the research distinguishes between &quot;loving divorces&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;nasty divorces&quot;, or even whether it should.  I believe that if  <br/>
children are allowed to feel however they feel, are supported through  <br/>
this with contact and support from their parents, then what is  <br/>
happening around them is less of a defining factor in their life.   My  <br/>
children have access to either parent whenever they choose - as much  <br/>
as is reasonable for their age.  They speak with the non-access parent  <br/>
daily; often a couple times a day.  They can call either of us  <br/>
whenever; e-mail is used, and in many ways it&#39;s no different than  <br/>
staying in contact with a parent (or a partner) who travels a lot for  <br/>
work.  It&#39;s the staying connected part that I feel is really important  <br/>
for the kids through the divorce.  Not getting lost in the adult&#39;s  <br/>
business.<br/>
<br/>
If divorce is inevitable, then keep showing the kids you love their  <br/>
other parent (through words and kind deeds) even if you can&#39;t really  <br/>
feel it in the moment, accept and support the kids&#39; feelings, be  <br/>
accessible to the kids as much as possible, especially when they&#39;re  <br/>
visiting the other parent, and work to constantly find compromises  <br/>
with that parent so the children&#39;s needs come first.  Eg - rearranging  <br/>
schedules to accomodate playdates and sporting events of the kids  <br/>
etc., especially as they get older.<br/>

it was raising a kid in the ghetto but that yours turned out okay.  <br/>
Occasionally kids do but believing they&#39;ll turn out okay because  <br/>
others have isn&#39;t the key. It isn&#39;t even a secondary factor.<br/>
<br/>
You haven&#39;t passed on what you alone did that controlled how the  <br/>
divorce played out. You haven&#39;t given anyone solid information they  <br/>
can use regardless of their situation. If a good divorce depends on a  <br/>
husband&#39;s decision to focus on peace and the needs of the kids, that&#39;s  <br/>
not in a divorcing wife&#39;s control.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect the smoothly working parts of your divorce have to do with  <br/>
your husband feeling guilty for causing the breakup and his  <br/>
willingness to not hurt the family further if he can avoid it. A  <br/>
divorcing wife can&#39;t control that.<br/>

is that in her or his control? And if each partner remarries, there  <br/>
are even more factors beyond one person&#39;s control.<br/>
<br/>
Communication, partnership, putting the kids needs ahead of adult  <br/>
needs, affirmations of love ... Those are all skills that help a  <br/>
marriage with kids thrive. People who have those skills are less  <br/>
likely to divorce. Those that do divorce and who are able to minimize  <br/>
the stress of divorce using all those skills don&#39;t automatically  <br/>
transfer those abilities to others who want to have them too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much much easier to work on the skills and attitudes that makes a  <br/>
relationship work before divorce than after. Afterwards the other  <br/>
partner is far more likely to not want to put the effort into a  <br/>
relationship he or she feels isn&#39;t worth the time. It&#39;s far more  <br/>
likely they&#39;ll compartmentalize their relationship with the kids to  <br/>
the time they&#39;re in direct contact. Sometimes the other partner  <br/>
doesn&#39;t even want that for whatever reason.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that it&#39;s not possible that two divorced partners might find  <br/>
those skills after. It&#39;s that it takes more than someone saying it&#39;s  <br/>
possible it can work and why the &quot;&quot;how&quot; of making a divorce as good as  <br/>
possible for kids is hard to find.&quot;<br/>

made many angry choices towards me since the divorce (perhaps out of  <br/>
his own guilt as you mention) - however, I have a choice in response  <br/>
to his behavior.  And, for the children, I choose to find as much love  <br/>
as possible towards him (sometimes it&#39;s none and we have a fight).    <br/>

honoring their relationship with their father - abusiveness aside),  <br/>
choose love and understanding and compassion (eg. no bad mouthing the  <br/>
ex, no matter how tempting), drop your expectations, and this will  <br/>
make it easier for you and easier for the kids.  (and incidentally,  <br/>
easier for the ex, which is your goal if you&#39;re aiming for love)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804711232">So much food for thought. First of all, thank you for the variety of<br/>
perspectives. It helps to see things from all sides.<br/>
<br/>
In our circumstance, having Dad around was nothing something they were used<br/>
to (he worked between 60-120 hours a week) so having him gone isn&#39;t as much<br/>
of an adjustment as it would be for other children who are used to having a<br/>
father who is more involved.<br/>
<br/>
My children have very different relationships with their Dad. My son (11)<br/>
has exceptional needs and his Dad has openly said he doesn&#39;t like that he&#39;s<br/>
autistic and would gladly hand over the parenting reigns to me. My daughter<br/>
is &quot;neurotypical&quot; as they say and he finds her a joy to parent because he<br/>
says it&#39;s easier. That is his choice.<br/>
<br/>
I believe there will be more freedom for me to in our days because without<br/>
my husband in the house, there&#39;s peace. My kids feel more free to explore<br/>
the things that interest him because he is there not there to criticize.<br/>
<br/>
I agree wholeheartedly with Sandra that honesty is key. Without a foundation<br/>
of trust, anything you try to build on that will falter in some way. So I am<br/>
honest with my kids. They know that Mum and Dad are better as friends living<br/>
in two different houses than we are as husband and wife sharing the same<br/>
home. They know that I don&#39;t always agree with everything Dad does and that<br/>
is okay, as he doesn&#39;t always agree with everything I do. Again, that is<br/>
okay. However, what is *not* okay is to disrespect people, belittle them,<br/>
mock them or try to control them. I also nurture the relationship they have<br/>
as siblings, something my husband disagrees with (saying my daughter will be<br/>
harmed by having an autistic brother).<br/>
<br/>
I am extremely thankful that when the house is quiet and my kids are<br/>
immersed in whatever is currently sparking their interest, they start to<br/>
talk. Sometimes a lot, sometimes a little. But I&#39;ve made it very clear that<br/>
they&#39;re entitled to feel whatever they feel and no topic is off limits. I<br/>
would rather they come to me with their thoughts than to keep it inside and<br/>
it builds up to a point where it&#39;s beyond what they can cope with. That has<br/>
worked extremely well for us.<br/>
<br/>
I think mediation is key to keeping the anger at a minimum, and the<br/>
communication open. We mediated custody and it was by far the best decision<br/>
we made. It enabled me to have a voice, and a third party to keep things<br/>
calm.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best things for myself and for my kids will be to have some<br/>
control over finances again. I was never allowed access to the bank account<br/>
and had to ask permission for everything. Now, when I want to go and buy<br/>
finger paints, a huge roll of paper, and let them go crazy with their art<br/>
skills in the backyard? I can. And I can&#39;t tell you how thrilled I will be<br/>
when that happens.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re healing right now. We&#39;re learning a lot of from each other and we&#39;re<br/>
establishing new family &quot;rules&quot; for lack of a better word, about how to<br/>
treat one another. My husband hasn&#39;t moved out yet, but should be in the<br/>
fall. My kids are happier when it&#39;s just the three of us, more settled, more<br/>
comfortable in their own skin. That&#39;s healthy and vital.<br/>
<br/>
It is my job to nurture their relationship with their Dad no matter how<br/>
fractured and when they&#39;re of an age to decide for themselves whether or not<br/>
its a relationship they will continue or not, I will be there to love them<br/>
through whatever decision they make.<br/>
<br/>
Between now and then we&#39;re all finding our way.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And how can one parent ensure the other partner does any of that? How<br/>
&gt; &gt; is that in her or his control? And if each partner remarries, there<br/>
&gt; &gt; are even more factors beyond one person&#39;s control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t have any control over my ex-husband&#39;s behavior. (Nor do I<br/>
&gt; have any control over my current partner&#39;s behavior.) We can<br/>
&gt; communicate and negotiate, but there isn&#39;t any control. I only know<br/>
&gt; that what I&#39;ve done for my kids during the separation process<br/>
&gt; (mentioned previously) has helped. And I didn&#39;t say that their Dad<br/>
&gt; does that for them. Whether or not anyone else in my children&#39;s life<br/>
&gt; is doing it for them seems irrelevant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s much much easier to work on the skills and attitudes that makes a<br/>
&gt; &gt; relationship work before divorce than after. Afterwards the other<br/>
&gt; &gt; partner is far more likely to not want to put the effort into a<br/>
&gt; &gt; relationship he or she feels isn&#39;t worth the time. It&#39;s far more<br/>
&gt; &gt; likely they&#39;ll compartmentalize their relationship with the kids to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the time they&#39;re in direct contact. Sometimes the other partner<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t even want that for whatever reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For me, their is very little &quot;relationship&quot; left between my ex and I -<br/>
&gt; in a relationship sense, other than parenting the children. He has<br/>
&gt; made many angry choices towards me since the divorce (perhaps out of<br/>
&gt; his own guilt as you mention) - however, I have a choice in response<br/>
&gt; to his behavior. And, for the children, I choose to find as much love<br/>
&gt; as possible towards him (sometimes it&#39;s none and we have a fight).<br/>
&gt; Often, that means not responding in anger. Letting time pass.<br/>
&gt; Bringing the focus of our conversations back around to the children.<br/>
&gt; If he chooses to do this or not - not up to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, the &quot;nasty&quot; divorces seem to happen when the parents cannot<br/>
&gt; put the children first. I have several friends in this situation.<br/>
&gt; I also see, that for many of them, as much as they blame their &quot;ex&quot;,<br/>
&gt; and no matter how &quot;bad&quot; the ex it, they also contribute to the<br/>
&gt; continual anger between them with their own choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; t&#39;s that it takes more than someone saying it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible it can work and why the &quot;&quot;how&quot; of making a divorce as good as<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible for kids is hard to find.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before I went through my divorce, I would have agreed with you. And<br/>
&gt; now, I don&#39;t. Everyone has choice - even in divorce. No matter what<br/>
&gt; your ex does - you can choose to put your kids first (which includes<br/>
&gt; honoring their relationship with their father - abusiveness aside),<br/>
&gt; choose love and understanding and compassion (eg. no bad mouthing the<br/>
&gt; ex, no matter how tempting), drop your expectations, and this will<br/>
&gt; make it easier for you and easier for the kids. (and incidentally,<br/>
&gt; easier for the ex, which is your goal if you&#39;re aiming for love)<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  If a parent isn&#39;t compassionate and helpful about the problems  <br/>
of sharing (I&#39;m not agreeing with &quot;having to share,&quot; because I object  <br/>
to &quot;have to&quot; as a principle), though, then the parent adds to the  <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
If the parent causes the loss of a pet, then the parent has caused the  <br/>
problem--not the pet.<br/>
<br/>
If the parent causes a death on purpose (not likely), or through  <br/>
negligence (more likely), the the parent didn&#39;t do the best he could do.<br/>
<br/>
When there is a divorce, very often by walking back through the steps  <br/>
there are things the parents could have done differently earlier.  To  <br/>
treat it as an inevitable, accidental &quot;oops&quot; that kids will just &quot;have  <br/>
to&quot; deal with and get over can be very cold, in some cases.  Not in  <br/>
all.  Not all are equally avoidable.<br/>
<br/>
IF on this list we say &quot;Oh, sure, it happens; Sure you did the best  <br/>
you could; Yes, kids are resilient...&quot; and IF because of that one  <br/>
single reader here becomes more cavalier about his or her own  <br/>
relationship, that list has done damage to children.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is on the fence and soothing positive talk about &quot;loving  <br/>
divorce&quot; comes through and she divorces because of that, and children  <br/>
are harmed, I would rather not maintain the list anymore.<br/>
<br/>
When someone is divorced and it can&#39;t be undone, IF she can still  <br/>
unschool, then that is better for her children than not.<br/>
When someone divorces and seems surprised that the judge and her ex  <br/>
husband have a say in what happens with her children... then what?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been helping other people sort through their unschooling thoughts  <br/>
and feelings, successes and regrets, for nearly 19 years now, and  <br/>
there HAVE been people who divorced easily and regretted it horribly,  <br/>
who have said they wished they could go back and prevent that divorce,  <br/>
to have a &quot;re-do,&quot; to undo the damage.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not popular to talk about that.  It is the fashion for women to  <br/>
soothe other women&#39;s feelings, and to assure them their children will  <br/>
be fine.  No doubt anyone who wants that will find it in abundance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My best friend, incidentally, has cheated on her husband for over a<br/>

She &quot;deserves&quot; to be supported by the man she cheated on?<br/>
He doesn&#39;t &quot;deserve&quot; be be able to let people know why they&#39;re  <br/>
separated?<br/>
She did the best she could?<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;whatever&quot; is the best a parent can do, then why discuss better and  <br/>
worse?<br/>
If there is no direction that is better for children than others, and  <br/>
all things are equal, what&#39;s wrong with school?<br/>
Schools are doing the best they can in their situations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379857296">Much of what you are writing about is about you. A reasonable perspective when <br/>
talking about a divorce, which is the breakdown of the relationship between two <br/>
people, but it helps when discussing parenting to realise that what is true for <br/>
you isn&#39;t true for your children. So talking about divorce not being a situation <br/>
of decline may be true in your experience, but may absolutely not be the same <br/>
for your children. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;True enough.  However, many children express much sorrow and loss, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>grief and anger, in many ways and at different stages, about many of <br/>
life&#39;s uncertainties and unfairnesses.  Death.  Divorce. The loss of a <br/>

ability of these children to express their emotions in a safe <br/>
environment, NOT to hide them, that helps them through.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
On a sliding scale death, divorce and then having to share? Death is pretty <br/>
awful, divorce, yep bad too, sharing stuff, well, being forced to share is <br/>
pretty crap, but it isn&#39;t really comparable to death and divorce. And the death <br/>
of a pet, well Simon and Linnaea and I have watched one pet fish eat another pet <br/>
fish&#39;s babies, that was kind of fun, in a nature red in tooth and claw sort of <br/>
moment. On the other hand we&#39;ve cuddled around a cat as she died and I have <br/>
cried for days over a dog, but there is a difference between that death and the <br/>
lasting legacy that divorce can leave. All of those moments may go to <br/>
irrevocably change your children, but some will have more of an effect than <br/>
others. And I believe that on your sliding scale divorce is on the high end. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a very luxurious experience to have to believe that divorce can have a <br/>
nominal effect on the lives of your children. Among the Ache of Paraguay the <br/>
absence of a father leads to the increased risk of death of his children. Among <br/>
the Mayans of Belize the one divorce I heard about lead to the adoption by <br/>
others of all the children because the parents could no longer support a child <br/>
being at home. And while that might be something one could dismiss as a cultural <br/>
difference, given that all humans I know of are derived from hunter-gatherer <br/>
populations usually having moved through subsistence farming, biologically <br/>
children should get stressed by the termination of their parent&#39;s marriage. The <br/>
risks to their own well being, their own lives may be at stake. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Point well taken.  But, for those reading that would feel discouraged <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and badly about divorce, I still respectfully disagree that divorce is <br/>
a situation of decline.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope that everyone reading on this list feels discouraged and badly about <br/>
divorce and looks to ways to make their marriages better and stronger. I hope <br/>
that everyone who is reading here thinks that maybe they&#39;ll reach out with a bit <br/>
more affection or with a gentle gift of something special for their partner <br/>
today because they feel discouraged at the idea of their marriage spiralling <br/>
down to a divorce and they want to do all that they can to buoy it up. Divorce <br/>
is a state of declination from marriage. Divorce is not such a good state for <br/>
children. I have a book that I&#39;ve read some of about called The Legacy of <br/>
Divorce. It&#39;s a qualitative, long term study of the effects of divorce on <br/>
children. Turns out, mostly, that it isn&#39;t all that great. Turns out that <br/>
children are mostly unaware of the tension in the marriage before the divorce <br/>
but are desperately aware of it after. And that the effect doesn&#39;t necessarily <br/>
show up immediately.<br/>
<br/>
In my own legacy of divorce story I can truly state that I was more upset about <br/>
the disappearance of my cat than I was about the news of my parents getting <br/>
divorced. They didn&#39;t divorce until I was 18 and living outside of their home. I <br/>
was done and dusted, moved out, all grown up, it shouldn&#39;t really play that big <br/>
a role anymore. But I can get sour about it, get tense when I call and my <br/>
step-dad answers or hate having to chat at my step-mom. I can get sad that <br/>
nobody talks about me as a baby, as a toddler, as a child anymore. My dad forgot <br/>
how old I am.  Maybe he would have anyhow, maybe it was just a slip between <br/>
brain and tongue, but maybe it was because there is no turning towards their <br/>
children together, but a turning away from the evidence of their previous <br/>
relationships in a bid for loyalty to their newer relationships. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a list that goes out to lots of folks it is important to be clear about your <br/>
message. On a list about unschooling the message starts with supporting your <br/>
children. Arguing that divorce is simply a state change and not a level change <br/>
may be appropriate on a lisst about supporting a mother or a father, but on a <br/>
list where the focus is on improving the lives of our children and our <br/>
relationships with them it just seems an odd decision. <br/>

It&#39;s interesting that in arranged marriages, there&#39;s more happiness  <br/>
and less divorce.  When people choose their own partners as in the  <br/>
U.S. and Canada, it seems a frightening shame that they so easily  <br/>
change their minds.   So &quot;Change their mind?&quot; is an interesting  <br/>
question, because at one point the marriage was a choice the two  <br/>
people made.  Somewhere in there, negative, hurtful things were said  <br/>
or done.    Things started to decline.  Lots of little actions,  <br/>
inactions and choices were dragging it down.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Let others who would<br/>
tell you that you are now entering a state of decline drag you down<br/>
even further?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If someone from outside says &quot;You are now entering a state of  <br/>
decline,&quot; could that possibly be a surprise?<br/>
If others from outside have the ability and potential to drag you down  <br/>
even further, why would they do that?<br/>
Why would someone who had voluntarily entered a marriage let them do  <br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
I divorced many years ago, to be with Keith instead of my first  <br/>
husband.  There are lots of details, of course.    It was a childless  <br/>
marriage, and was not a marriage of love or romance.  We got married  <br/>
so his brother and sister wouldn&#39;t be taken away when their parents  <br/>
died.  He was 23, a little younger than Kirby is now.  I was 21;  <br/>
Marty&#39;s age.  I had known the family for six years, knew both parents  <br/>
and all six kids.  Two were still little when the mom died, just two  <br/>
years after the dad died.  The aunt (mom&#39;s twin) didn&#39;t want them,  <br/>
really; they REALLY didn&#39;t want to move five states away to be with  <br/>
her.   So I married him, because he was sad and afraid and I like him  <br/>
and his family.   It lasted three years, with a three year separation  <br/>
before the divorce was final.   It was the 1970&#39;s and things were  <br/>
fast, loose and people were getting divorced like crazy.    It was  <br/>
EASY to find people to say &quot;just leave,&quot; and almost impossible to find  <br/>
any advice about staying and making things good.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s possible for others to drag you down even further.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m unwilling to be one of those others, and have been unwilling for  <br/>
the past 30 years to stand by silently while anyone else casually  <br/>
drags anyone else down, even before I had children.  Way before I was  <br/>
unschooling.  Before I was spending so much energy helping people  <br/>
unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Because my focus, when I write (and my posts are my own writing from  <br/>
my own point of view) it&#39;s to help children have peaceful unschooling  <br/>
lives--not just the children of the poster to whom I might be  <br/>
responding, but the children of lurkers on the list, and the children  <br/>
of those who just joined and will have a first impression of the  <br/>
potential of unschooling from what they read the first day or two  <br/>
they&#39;re on a list.<br/>
<br/>
Some things are better for unschooling than others.  Sorting through  <br/>
what helps and what doesn&#39;t will assist families new to unschooling to  <br/>
decide which principles to live by to have peaceful unschooling lives  <br/>
for many years.   There are risky behaviors parents can engage in that  <br/>
endanger their children&#39;s peace and stability.  Skydiving.  Drug use.   <br/>
Promiscuity.  Not maintaining their marriages.<br/>
<br/>
That list isn&#39;t as large a spread as &quot;divorce, death, sharing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t about morality or marriage.  It&#39;s about creating and  <br/>
maintaining a nest for children to learn as fully and peacefully as  <br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone can unschool.  Not everyone can own a yacht.  Unschooling  <br/>
is BIG, like owning a yacht.  If a couple doesn&#39;t agree on owning a  <br/>
yacht, it&#39;s not happening.  If a couple gets divorced, the yacht  <br/>
probably ends up being sold.  But it&#39;s possible (legal and often  <br/>
advisable) for someone else to take care of the yacht part time or  <br/>
full time (another great expense that would need to be agreed upon).   <br/>
Unschooling can only be done within the family.  If others do it, it&#39;s  <br/>
tutoring, or school, not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
People come to this list to discuss unschooling, and that&#39;s why  <br/>
divorces shouldn&#39;t be encouraged here, or treated as just another  <br/>
option equal to any other factors.<br/>

<br/>
The very nature of divorce puts the adults first.  Divorce has very little to do <br/>
with kids at all.  Sure, parents going through a divorce can help the kids and <br/>
be there more than less, but the divorce itself is about adults and what adults <br/>
want and need, not about what kids want and need. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I disagree with that to a certain extent. Through our separation process, we<br/>
decided to mediate. The whole reason for that was because we wanted to make<br/>
sure the childrens needs were met. My husband doesn&#39;t want to parent a child<br/>
with autism full time. That is a decision he made and has been completely<br/>
unwilling to change. I spent years in counseling (he was unwilling to go)<br/>
before I came to the conclusion that staying in the marriage was doing more<br/>
damage to the kids than ending it. That advice came not only on from my<br/>
counselor put also the variety of medical teams treating my son.<br/>
<br/>
Mediation has been a huge blessing. Everything we discuss is centered around<br/>
the kids and their needs.  It has to be balanced so that the children can be<br/>
provided for in a way that meets their emotional, financial, and educational<br/>
needs in the best way possible given the situation that we&#39;re in. Is it<br/>
optimal? Given the situation that I/we are in? Yes I do believe it is. I<br/>
can&#39;t change another person. I can give him every opportunity to work with<br/>
me, together as a team, to work on the issues in our marriage. I can work on<br/>
myself, knowing I have my own flaws and try to better myself. But in the<br/>
end, if he is unwilling, and him staying is a danger to me and to our kids,<br/>
then you can bet I would high tail it out of there, taking every precaution<br/>
along the way to make sure my children are supported.<br/>
<br/>
I took my marriage vows and my marriage very very seriously.When I married<br/>
him, it was to be for life. I&#39;m saddened that it didn&#39;t turn out that way.<br/>
But I don&#39;t have any regret, because I know I did all I could to hold it<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
Now it&#39;s about moving forward and continuing to do what I do best. Parent my<br/>
children, create a safe, loving and peaceful home, and watch them thrive and<br/>
learn at their own pace and in their own ways. I will always be grateful<br/>
that they invite me into their world as much as they do. I don&#39;t intrude, I<br/>
am invited and nothing makes me smile more than that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-867474331">***One of the best things for myself and for my kids will be to have some<br/>
control over finances again. I was never allowed access to the bank account<br/>
and had to ask permission for everything.***<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like the key to the break down of the marriage... trust/control.  If <br/>
two people fell in love at one point, had children, and can work with a mediator <br/>
to deal with custody, it seems that other issues could have been resolved too. <br/>
 In my experience, a person who tries to control another, is a person who feels <br/>
out of control and needs to desperately find it.  The more desperate that person <br/>
is, the more they will seek to control others.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how divorce can make that better.  The person who felt the need for <br/>
control will only feel more out of control and possibly attempt to control more. <br/>
 It isn&#39;t necessarily the act of control that is so horrible for people to deal <br/>
with, it is the attempt that people use to try to control that feels so <br/>
horrible.  If the tiny shred of trust that existed within the marriage is gone, <br/>
the attempts to control will likely only get uglier.  It may be that way for <br/>
years.  There may be temporary peace for a while, but that issue isn&#39;t going to <br/>
go away.  The object of control may change to the children, and to me, that <br/>
seems far worse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457456652">***And while that might be something one could dismiss as a cultural <br/>
difference, given that all humans I know of are derived from hunter-gatherer <br/>
populations usually having moved through subsistence farming, biologically <br/>
children should get stressed by the termination of their parent&#39;s marriage. The <br/>
risks to their own well being, their own lives may be at stake.***<br/>
<br/>
When I have felt down about my own marriage, and I imagine what it would be like <br/>
to have a different partner, the first thing that comes to mind is my children. <br/>
 NOBODY will protect my children better than their biological parent, their <br/>
father.  It&#39;s a biological thing, passing on one&#39;s genetic code and making sure <br/>
it survives.  A step parent, even a really great one, isn&#39;t going to have that <br/>
drive.  (I&#39;ve wondered if that is why, in other times and places, if a husband <br/>
died, the woman would marry the brother.)  If I gave up my marriage, let it go, <br/>
stop working on making it better and making it survive, I&#39;m also making a step <br/>
towards disabling, even a little bit, my children&#39;s ability to survive.  I don&#39;t <br/>
want my children to merely survive though, I want them to thrive.  <br/>

You disagreed before you read clearly what had been written.<br/>
<br/>
It seems this whole discussion which SHOULD have been about music  <br/>
lessons is hijacked toward attempting to get people to say &quot;NO  <br/>
PROBLEM, good idea about that divorce.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What Jenny wrote was &quot;the very nature of divorce puts the adults  <br/>
first.&quot;  Speaking of divorce, that is true.  Speaking in general of  <br/>
the topic, Jenny can&#39;t be disagreed with to a certain extent.  Not by  <br/>
an example from one situation that&#39;s already past the divorce stage.<br/>
<br/>
What happens in a separation process happens after the marriage  <br/>
deterioriated.<br/>
<br/>
What we want to help people see is that preventing marriages from  <br/>
deteriorating earlier on can be crucial to the establishment and  <br/>
continuation of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to start a different thread, because I don&#39;t want to talk  <br/>
about this one single divorce.  I want to talk about trust and  <br/>
planning for the future by living in the moment.<br/>
