<br/>
I wanna go play tourist in NYC either before or after that, for about 4-5<br/>
days.  Is there anything I should know?  I&#39;d like to avoid things like large<br/>
festivals (St. Patty&#39;s day?), parades, etc, that bring huge numbers of extra<br/>
people to your fair city.  It&#39;s populated enough there without help.<br/>
<br/>
Liza, can you (or anybody else who&#39;s out that way) tell me anything?  (I<br/>
don&#39;t imagine the weather will be much different either way....)  Thanks in<br/>
advance for advice.<br/>

p.s. to anyone who remembers me stressing about childcare for my son with my<br/>
controlling, anti-vegetarian parents for this conference:<br/>
I told my parents to forget it, and figured I&#39;d cope.  And my in-laws just<br/>
decided this week that they&#39;d like to fly out and take care of Tim at the<br/>
hotel, with me.  Bingo!  Problem solved.  Happy brenda.</div>

After a quick trip to NYC this past summer two things:<br/>
<br/>
1. Staten Island Navy Lodge  http://www.navy-<br/>
lodge.com/united_states/new_york/staten_island.html  - we just <br/>
stopped in and weren&#39;t able to stay there as they were booked but <br/>
great location and a kind of &quot;oasis&quot; feel.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Half-price theater tickets available in Time Square  - we saw Les <br/>
Miserables and it was the best theater experience I&#39;ve ever had - <br/>
kids really loved it.  (17yods and 11yodd)<br/>
<br/>
Mercedes - LONG time lurker, daily reader of this list - thanks for <br/>
the GREAT insights. . . . .</div>

the city. Clean. Simple. Cheap. Typical military! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Cats, The Sound of Music, and Bring in da Noise, Bring in da Funk in three <br/>
days. We had a blast! We ate out every meal---his favorite was breakfast at <br/>
the diners! What great memories!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>St Pats is around the 17th so you won&#39;t have a problem. I&#39;d check <br/>
www.nyc.gov for that kind of information.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I need to know a few things:<br/>
<br/>
1) What are your kids ages?<br/>
2) Are you renting a car?<br/>
<br/>
NYC is probably on of the most car and kid unfriendly places in the <br/>
world --unless you know where to go. So, depending on the ages, I can <br/>
give you more information.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For general stuff, some rules of thumb:<br/>
<br/>
1. Never rent a car EVER unless you want to go out of NYC. It is not <br/>
only incredibly expensive but, if you do get a deal you will be screwed <br/>
with what it costs to pay for parking ($14-20/hour at most lots in <br/>
Midtown). Even downtown lots will cost you about $9 and hour. Unless <br/>
you want to spend 4-5 days looking for a parking space, good luck <br/>
trying to find one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. If you do not want to pay out the nose for lodging, stay away from <br/>
midtown Soho, Midtown and the Upper East and West sides (up to 95th <br/>
Streets). That is about most of Manhattan. Harlem may have affordable <br/>
bread and breakfasts. You certainly want to look into Brooklyn. At the <br/>
low end, expect to pay between $90 to $125 a night. You may find <br/>
something for $75 a night in Brooklyn or even Harlem.<br/>
<br/>
I would stay away from Staten Island, especially if you have small <br/>
children and do not have a car. It is as suburban as you can go in the <br/>
NYC area. There is not much to Staten Island unless you consider the <br/>
Fresh Kills Landfill a top sight-seeing place. Snug Harbor Cultural <br/>
Center does have some interesting things but it can be all done in <br/>
about 1 day (www.snug-harbor.com).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. If you are going to go whacked out traveling from one place to the <br/>
next, the best thing to do is to get an unlimited rides MetroCard. It <br/>
is $16 and it lasts for a week.<br/>
<br/>
I live in the East Village. It costs me $11.50 + tip to go to 86th & <br/>
Amsterdam. On any given day you could easily spend $30-50 just on <br/>
taxis. You certainly want to focus on mass transit. At the NYC website <br/>
you can get maps to the train and bus systems.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. Try not to eat in the Midtown area. Most places suck and are their <br/>
prices are ridiculous. Stay especially away from the delis with buffets <br/>
(big rip-offs). The place to look for decent food at affordable prices <br/>
is down here in the Village. From East to West you can find places <br/>
where you can spend anything from $5 to $50 per person. In midtown the <br/>
average is $20.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5. The AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY has an exhibit about <br/>
Einstein. I still have to go see it but I have been told it is good. <br/>
I&#39;m going next week.<br/>
<br/>
Most museums in NYC are private like the AMNH but THE METROPOLITAN <br/>
MUSEUM OF NEW YORK is actually publicly funded. Never, EVER pay the $10 <br/>
suggested entrance fee. That would be $40 for a family of four. No real <br/>
New Yorker ever does :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6. TKTS is a non-profit organization that &#39;harvests&#39; first class <br/>
tickets to Broadway and Off-Broadway shows and sells them half-priced. <br/>
Before you get excited, please note that to see a show like OKLAHOMA! <br/>
(which is fantastic and I highly recommend), it would cost you $100 for <br/>
orchestra tickets. So for a family of 4, instead of $400, we are <br/>
talking about $200. This is just the show --no food, no drinks, nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Most people make the like at Times Square. The other booth was at Tower <br/>
#1. After 9/11 they moved just off South Street Seaport. If you take <br/>
the M15 bus it leaves you a half a block away. You have to go and buy <br/>
tickets either for the 8pm show of that day or the 3pm (if there is any <br/>
matinee) of the next day. They only accept cash --no traveler&#39;s checks <br/>
of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Depending on your interests I can give you more specific information. <br/>
It would take at least a year to really see NYC. This is a small space <br/>
made huge with the diversity of activities you can find. Tell me what <br/>
you guys would like to do so I can help you better.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>
