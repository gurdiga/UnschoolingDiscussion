care center/Kindergarten. For the most part there weren&#39;t too many wierd <br/>
rules, but one of them was at snack time, you had to taste everything.<br/>
<br/>
Well, there was this one kid who ALWAYS resisted trying vegetables. He would <br/>
sit there, missing out on playing, not crying (we probably would have gotten <br/>
how stupid this rule was if he had), but just sitting there, FOREVER. <br/>
<br/>
Finally he would taste the thing, announce he LOVED it, and ask for more. <br/>
Then the next time the same thing would happen.<br/>
<br/>
I agree. Lame rule. I like Sandra&#39;s &quot;Marty doesn&#39;t like ____ yet.&quot;<br/>
