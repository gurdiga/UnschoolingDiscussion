recycle them because they couldn&#39;t get any money for them - there is <br/>
such a huge &quot;supply&quot; that the price is zero. So they go into landfills <br/>
with all the other trash.&lt;&lt;<br/>

Walmart has a cardboard bin thing at both entrances to the store to <br/>
recycle/collect used plastic grocery bags.  <br/>
<br/>
We save ours and use them over and over again, or I recycle them at Walmart.  <br/>

use are collected previously-used plastic bags from<br/>
other stores....<br/>
