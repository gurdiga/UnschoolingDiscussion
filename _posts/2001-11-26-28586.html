<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871602456">&lt;&lt;Why do kids act this way?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many different answers for many different kids.  Some is just temperament.<br/>
My 2 boys are very high spirited and impulsive.  They are either joyous or<br/>
in a snit.  Some kids are easily over-stimulated.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are never talked to and have little understanding of how to get<br/>
their needs met except by having a fit, hitting, whining, etc..<br/>

&gt; They throw a tantrum whenever they can&#39;t have their own way, their <br/>
&gt; parents can&#39;t stand to take them to the store with them because they <br/>
&gt; always whine that they want everything and misbehave in the store, <br/>
&gt; other parents don&#39;t want their kids to play with them because of <br/>
&gt; their behavior, etc.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So the question I&#39;ll throw out is--Why do some kids act this way? <br/>

it mom still says no,child escalates, mom is getting that peer pressure <br/>
feeling and finally to get Timmy to shut up she buys him the candy bar. If <br/>
there were none of this back and forth then it wouldn&#39;t be a whine fest. <br/>
Either the parent never sets a limit and the kid gets the candy bar upon <br/>
request or the kid knows mom means no when she says it and doesn&#39;t escalate <br/>
the scene.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK, Here is my question (Please be gentle with your answers! LOL)<br/>
Once the above has become a pattern - how does one change it? How does one<br/>
set the limit yet still maintain respect and teh child autonomy? I tend to<br/>
have good days (respecting their wishes, everyone cooperating, watching the<br/>
hunger/anger/lonely/tired thing, modeling behavior and then all of a sudden<br/>
I realize that there has been some yelling, disrespect etc and I&#39;m not sure<br/>
what got us there.<br/>
Also, the eating issue (I really wish S was here to answer this one) My two<br/>
year old is down to eating nothing until he gets junk. Would removing it<br/>
from the house for a period of time help? Might it give him the space to try<br/>
other healthier foods and realize he likes them? I don&#39;t want to be a food<br/>
controller yet I am starting to become concerned over his eating habits.<br/>
Yesterday he ate a bowl of rice crispies with milk and then nothing else! He<br/>
is still nursing so that eases my fear somewhat. I have also thought about<br/>
not arguing and letting him nurse as much as desired but I am at that<br/>
nursing stage where it is starting to get a little irritating physically as<br/>
my cycle ebbs and flows (pun intended LOL)<br/>

fructose corn syrup. Just let your kid eat what he feels his body needs.<br/>
<br/>
Organic, pesticide free foods is best for small bodies and you can get <br/>
just about anything these days for kids that the &#39;regular&#39; stores have. <br/>
(gone are the beansprout only days of health food stores like the 60s)<br/>
<br/>
Organic meat is difficult to find, but definately worth the work to track <br/>
it down. Otherwise your pumping your kid full of female hormones, <br/>
pesticides and antibiotics. At that point, Rice Crispys is definately <br/>
better!<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to have plenty of variety around to offer, leave out or keep <br/>
within reach.<br/>
<br/>
Popcorn and jelly beans for breakfast is great! So is pancakes for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Whey protein shakes are delicious and great on those &#39;busy&#39; days. They <br/>
also make great activities when you buy the vanilla or plain and put <br/>
stuff in and shake it up!<br/>
<br/>
Green Kamut mixed with orange juice is a great green drink and no need to <br/>
chase them around to eat their veggies.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you&#39;re not offering broccoli vs. white sugar addictive foods, <br/>
let your kid decide.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is what I keep in the house. I am a member of an organic CSA (community<br/>
supported agriculture - www.houseinthewoods.com) I use lots of grains,<br/>
veggies etc. I have not just one but THREE whole foods markets, one medium<br/>
size &quot;My Organic Market&quot; and two Trader Joe&#39;s . I thought the Rice Crispies<br/>
and Milk was wonderful.<br/>

I want to thank everyone for the fantastic answers to my post. I am feeling<br/>
so much better having just gotten my fears off my chest. Max will be fine.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82463801">There are also lots of super naturally sweet organic products that might<br/>
appeal until he gets past the refined white sugar withdrawal such as<br/>
dehydrated pears, raisins, fruit leather (recipe follows as I think I<br/>
promised it to someone before my computer crashed).<br/>
<br/>
Gingerbread waffles with honey cider sauce is a really good one for kidlets<br/>
that have a sweet tooth.<br/>
<br/>
We keep &quot;ready to munch&quot; bowls in the fridge-- one with veggies (baby<br/>
carrots, celery sticks, broccoli flowerettes, bell pepper slices, mushrooms,<br/>
etc.) and one with fruit (apple slices, orange slices, kiwi quarters, etc.).<br/>
In a bag we have string cheese and slices of cheese (organic, of course<br/>
&lt;g&gt;).  And then I make up a bunch of these little tiny glass bowls with<br/>
homemade dill dip, ranch dressing, peanut butter and peanut butter and honey<br/>
in them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve found that when they have helped fix do the shopping and then<br/>
helped fix them they are more inclined to eat them.  We make homemade<br/>
granola and healthy muffins and stuf and they devore them because, in part,<br/>
they are part of the process.  They&#39;ve been either sitting on the counter or<br/>
standing on stools to help since they were old enough to sit unaided.  So,<br/>
they &quot;own&quot; the foods and thus eat things other kids might not.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Fruit leather recipes:<br/>
<br/>
Pureed fruit can be dried on special, heavy plastic sheets in a dehydrator<br/>
or in your oven. To prepare apples or pears for leather making, wash fruit<br/>
thoroughly, peel and core removing all seeds, puree in a blender or food<br/>
processor until smooth. Mixture should be of pouring consistency. It is<br/>
important to add honey to help keep the leather pliable when dried. If the<br/>
puree is too thick, add liquid to thin. If too tart, add more honey or sugar<br/>
(stevia works, also). Heat apple or pear mixture to 190° F to prevent<br/>
oxidization, cool before pouring onto dehydrator trays. Coat trays with a<br/>
layer of fruit puree about 1/8 inch thick. Dry at 135° F until leathery (use<br/>
lowest oven setting and leave door propped open). Be careful there are no<br/>
moisture pockets. Roll up fruit leather while warm, wrap in plastic and<br/>
store.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also made strawberry, watermelon, peach, plum, fig and date fruit<br/>
leather.<br/>
