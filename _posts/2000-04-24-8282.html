We have always done a May Pole.&nbsp; It is pretty and fun even if it doesn&#39;t
quite go like it &quot;supposed&quot; to.
<br>Wreaths would be nice, but I don&#39;t have any daisies.&nbsp; Hmmmm.....
<br>I really like the idea of May Baskets too.&nbsp; We are going to make
Fairy Baskets.&nbsp; Should be a huge mess, but fun.&nbsp; I&nbsp; bought
seeds, but I think I&#39;m going to go out and get a few plants too.&nbsp;
It&#39;s hard to wait for seeds.
<br>Thanks for the ideas....
