<div id="ygrps-yiv-1406972356">I have not &quot;required&quot; chores from my kids for a long time, but I do ask for help when I need it.<br/>
<br/>
As of late, my 12 year old is constantly asking me to run here everywhere, asking to have friends over, wanting me to buy her hair dye, wanting her hair cut, asking me to pay for makeup, asking me for money at the pool, at swim meets, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Her requests seem to come several times a day, 10 requests in a day would not be an exagerration. <br/>
<br/>
She really does not seem aware of how much she asks for.  And she constantly complains like our family and our home are not good enough for her.<br/>

Now the time has come, she wants me to drive her to somewhere, and once again she has done absolutely NOTHING to help me out.<br/>
<br/>
I am feeling VERY taken advantage of and overwhelmed with the stuff that needs done in between running her everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
In addition I am broke, and I cannot afford to give her more money.  She has already gotten so much that I can&#39;t even give any to the other kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Should I drive her?  I&quot;m really inclined to say &quot;no&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already switched from using an ATM card to using cash, so that they can visually see that when its gone, its gone.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-334213155">What we have started doing here, with the money situation, is giving our son an allowance.  He is given $60 a month, of which $10 is put away for savings, and $10 is put away for a future large ticket item that may pop up.  So that leaves him with $40 for the month to purchase toys, video games, snacks and such.  We just started with this at the beginning of the month, but already I see a change.  He burned thru the money in the first 2 days.  I reminded him that when it was gone, he would have to wait till next month for more.  He did not want to save any, so it is all gone.  The first day, he wanted a snack when we were out.  He had just eaten lunch, so it was not that he was starving.  I told him that he was more than welcome to purchase anything he wanted with his money.  He informed me that he would rather wait till we got home, which was after we were don&#39;t at that store, because the food at home was free.  Smart kid!!  Also, when we are out and he asks for a toy, I tell him<br/>
 that he can buy it with his allowance.  He says it is all gone, and will have to wait till he gets it again.  And that is usually the end of it.  Now I must say that he has always been a pretty easy going child, and the discussions for me to purchase a toy were never a battle, but now I am no longer the BAD GUY for not buying it.  He owns the decision on what to get with his money.  Of course, I still do get him things when we are out, but he is learning that when the money is gone, it is gone.  So when I tell him I do not have any money to get what he wants, he understands the concept much better now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407586419">I have a suggestion resolving the asking to spend money issue.<br/>
<br/>
Give her money.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down together - figure out how much money you&#39;re spending on the <br/>
kinds of things she typically requests -- could be things like, <br/>
clothing, hair dye, hair cuts, jewelry, music, concerts, books, gifts <br/>
for friends, cute little knick-knacks, special shampoo, perfume, hair <br/>
ties, shoes, socks, photos, movie tickets, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Brainstorm a list like this for yourselves - think about what you&#39;ve <br/>
given her money for or bought or paid for, for her, in the past few <br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
Add it up and figure out a reasonably good estimate of an average month.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say you decide your list includes: clothes, hair dye, jewelry, <br/>
music, and gifts for friends and that it adds up to $50 average per <br/>
month (some months might be way higher and others lower).<br/>
<br/>
Then you give her $50 in cash on the first day of every month. This is <br/>
over and above any other allowance you may have already been giving.<br/>
<br/>
And she can spend it on whatever she wants. But the deal is that she <br/>
pays for the things on the list you made. If she asks you to buy her <br/>
hair dye, you remind her that is on the list of things she&#39;s paying <br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be surprised if she doesn&#39;t spend nearly as much on these things <br/>
and uses the money for other things. That&#39;s okay - that&#39;s sensible <br/>
decision making when faced with real trade-offs.<br/>
<br/>
This worked so well for my family - I think otherwise the kids  don&#39;t <br/>
have a good sense of how much is reasonable to ask for and they might <br/>
as well just keep asking for everything they could possibly want until <br/>
we have to say we can&#39;t afford it. Which is fine but it is annoying <br/>
when a kid is constantly asking for something and we have to keep <br/>
constantly deciding if we can afford it or not.<br/>
<br/>
And if I wanted to buy something for them that would normally be on <br/>
their list, it was  a gift and an extra and they appreciated it in that <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
It is really important that the list be created by both of you and that <br/>
you&#39;re clear about what is on it and what isn&#39;t so you don&#39;t have to <br/>
negotiate THAT in the future, although it might take a few months to <br/>
get absolutely clear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486896439">I have a 10 year old boy who reminds me of your daughter. Sometimes I <br/>
feel like the minute he wakes up he is only thinking of ways to get anything <br/>
he can from me. It is very draining. I feel like I have always been this <br/>
easygoing person and that used to be a good thing. Now I wish I was a strong <br/>
character and much more rigid. My son is smart and self confident. He is well liked <br/>
by most people who know him. When he is with me, he drives me nuts. I don&#39;t <br/>
feel comfortable being the kind of person I have to be to keep him from taking <br/>
over. I&#39;m not the kind of person who does everything by schedule and who is <br/>
orderly. I&#39;m more a roll with the punches kind of person. <br/>
       Anyway, I guess I&#39;m saying that I understand what you are going <br/>
through. It is not easy to do but you can&#39;t try to always keep her happy. I realized <br/>
that I was always worried that if he was not happy he would make everyone <br/>
miserable. I found my day being revolved around what he wanted to have or do. <br/>
Then I would be angry with myself and him because all the things I knew needed to <br/>
be accomplished were not. I found myself not liking him and that really <br/>
bothered me. <br/>
       I think it is a good idea to give her a certain amount of money per <br/>
month or week, but I don&#39;t think you should be too specific about what it is <br/>
for. What my son would do is instead of spending the money on other things, he <br/>
would keep asking for more money for other things not on the list and just say <br/>
that it needs to be added to the list. I&#39;m sure she is like many teens and they <br/>
all want the latest clothes and hair, etc. You cannot compete with kids who&#39;s <br/>
parents have an endless amount of money and just hand their kids all that <br/>
they ask for.  <br/>
       Also, about the jobs, when I grew up my mother never asked us to do <br/>
any jobs and she just tried to do everything herself. When I was on my own, I <br/>
had no idea what needed to be done to keep a house going. I still have trouble. <br/>
Having responsibility in the family to keep the house in order makes a child <br/>
feel needed. It gives them a sense of accomplishment. I just started to assign <br/>
jobs to my kids. I&#39;m working on how to &quot;encourage&#39; them to complete their jobs <br/>
each day. I should have started when my son was younger, but late is better <br/>
then never. The hardest part is getting them to complete them. I try to make <br/>
them see that if they do not complete their job for the week, it effects the <br/>
entire family. If the dishes are not done then we don&#39;t have any dishes to eat <br/>
off of. Also, I allow them to watch an hour of tv each day if they had done <br/>
their job the day before. I was just about to disconnect the cable because they <br/>
watch waaaaay too much tv and to save $. My son came up with an idea of tv for <br/>
jobs completed, so I said I&#39;d try it. So far it is not too bad. It is not <br/>
perfect but better then before. The kids are contributing with the work and they <br/>
are watching less tv.<br/>
       Sometimes when we love our children we want to give them all they <br/>
want. We think it makes them happy. I&#39;m always telling my kids that they have no <br/>
idea of all the things that they have and the things they do. I never had <br/>
anything like that when I was a kid. Sort of like walking 3 miles to school without <br/>
any shoes in the snow!! They just kind of laugh at me and ask for another <br/>
piece of candy. I&#39;ve learned to not try to make them happy all the time. When my <br/>
3 year old tells me that she doesn&#39;t like me I say &quot;that&#39;s OK, it&#39;s not my job <br/>
to make you like me. I still love you, though. Now, go feed the dog!&quot;<br/>
       Sorry this is so long. I got a little carried away. Hope things get a <br/>
little easier for you. <br/>

<br/>
Are you asking her to do things with you, things you can use the time to<br/>
connect with each other over? Like folding laundry and cooking so you can<br/>
talk about things?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have private times where you can connect with each other? Like just<br/>
the two of you at a cafe when the others are off with friends?<br/>
<br/>
Is this something new? It sounds not unlike my teen years when I didn&#39;t want<br/>
anyone to ask anything of me but wanted them to meet all my needs. I don&#39;t<br/>
know how much of that was hormones and how much was caused by school.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were needing things you couldn&#39;t get for yourself (if your leg were<br/>
broken for instance) and your husband started seeing your motivations as<br/>
trying to get anything you can from him, it would increase his resentment of<br/>
your requests and not improve the relationship between you.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you rather he talked to you about it and worked out a way to make<br/>
it easier on everyone?<br/>
<br/>
Have you talked to your son about it? What kind of things is he asking for?<br/>
Maybe people have some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Unless he *is* trying to get anything he can from you in which case that&#39;s a<br/>
symptom of something that&#39;s broken in the relationship between you. It isn&#39;t<br/>
because you aren&#39;t strong enough! Kids aren&#39;t born with the desire to grasp<br/>
whatever they can con others into giving them until we train it out of them<br/>
so if he is doing that, it&#39;s probably because there&#39;s something else he&#39;s<br/>
needing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is very draining.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People don&#39;t know they&#39;re draining us unless we let them know!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel like I have always been this<br/>
&gt; easygoing person and that used to be a good thing. Now I wish I was a strong<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those aren&#39;t the only choices!<br/>
<br/>
How about talking to him? How about being realistic about what can fit into<br/>
a day? How about not casting yourself in the role of his servant but as his<br/>
partner? <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s just asking for what he needs and you keep giving and giving until<br/>
you&#39;re drained, he&#39;s not going to know he&#39;s draining you until you reach<br/>
empty and collapse.<br/>
<br/>
I think moms especially have this feeling they need to fix every problem and<br/>
supply every need. So when kids ask for too much it seems the solution is to<br/>
get them to stop asking. And then we feel frustrated when kids keep asking,<br/>
as though they should just know that they&#39;re asking too much.<br/>
<br/>
I think honesty about what can be accomplished for *everyone* (including mom<br/>
and the home) is a better solution. If a child needs something that might<br/>
take an hour trip instead of feeling guilty about saying no, we can let them<br/>
know how it fits into the day and whether it will need to be put on the plan<br/>
for the next day.<br/>
<br/>
If we cast ourselves in the role of the granter and denier or wishes, then<br/>
the only tool we&#39;re giving kids to get their needs met is begging. If we let<br/>
reality (time, money, energy) be the factor, then kids can be involved in<br/>
the process of figuring out how to meet their needs given the limitations<br/>
that life imposes.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What kind of person are you being?<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things are happening between you?<br/>
<br/>
People might have some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
There are other choices besides saying yes to everything or saying no to<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, about the jobs, when I grew up my mother never asked us to do<br/>

&gt; trouble.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mother never asked either. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m good at running a home but<br/>
even if she had asked, had assigned chores, I doubt I&#39;d be any better. I<br/>
know *how* to do housework. It&#39;s not that hard! ;-) I could set up a<br/>
schedule. I could do Flylady. But there are things that are way more<br/>
interesting than housework.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s something that could have been learned in the past to improve<br/>
yourself today, it can be done now. If you can&#39;t fix it now, it&#39;s far more<br/>
likely to be personality than lack of skills.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Having responsibility in the family to keep the house in order makes a child<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or they can feel like they&#39;re being taken advantage of.<br/>
<br/>
*Real* responsiblity are things we *choose* to take on or not, *choose* the<br/>
standard to keep it at, *choose* to keep going or drop.<br/>
<br/>
None of that applies to assigned chores. Assigned chores are more akin to<br/>
the mayor knocking on your door and saying &quot;Since you live in this town, we<br/>
want you to feel needed and feel a sense of accomplishment. Here&#39;s a list of<br/>
things to do and how to do them and the standards expected of you. Pick<br/>
one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think what will make a child or anyone feel needed is working together to<br/>
accomplish something. Also being honestly thankful for help given. If<br/>
someone takes time away from doing something more meaningful to them to help<br/>
us out, we should be suitably thankful for it. Generally what kids get is<br/>
nothing for doing what&#39;s been assigned and attention for not doing it. It&#39;s<br/>
not what would make me want to help someone!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I try to make <br/>
&gt; them see that if they do not complete their job for the week, it effects the<br/>
&gt; entire family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter at 12 is seeing the world differently than she did at 10. She<br/>
can now comprehend how much time and what needs to be sacrificied to get<br/>
something. Not because I&#39;ve trained her but because her brain is changing<br/>
with puberty. I could have spent years &quot;making&quot; her understand, but she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have really understood until her brain chemistry changed.<br/>
<br/>
I think if we can paint an honest picture of what&#39;s involved in running a<br/>
home we can help kids get a better feel for what&#39;s involved in what they&#39;re<br/>
asking for, get a feeling of what needs sacrificed to get something else.<br/>
<br/>
If there are no dishes and the kids get the feeling we could have done them<br/>
(or bought paper plates last shopping trip ;-) it communicates more a sense<br/>
of feeling that it rocks to have the one with power (who gets to decide who<br/>
does what) and sucks to be the one with no power.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, I allow them to watch an hour of tv each day if they had done<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if your husband decided you couldn&#39;t watch TV the next day unless you<br/>
cooked dinner from scratch the night before? Would that make you want to<br/>
cook from scratch?<br/>
<br/>
What would make you want to cook? How about sincere appreciation and honest<br/>
compliments when you did cook from scratch?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;that&#39;s OK, it&#39;s not my job<br/>

<br/>
Kristen, this sounds like my summer last year. It was exhausting! I was surprised every <br/>
time my daughter (13) asked to go out and needed a ride. I&#39;d take her somewhere feeling <br/>
so good about helping her out and think (wrongly) that that would &quot;hold&quot; her for a few <br/>
days at least. Wrong. The next morning, another request.<br/>
<br/>
After a month of daily rides and negotiations, I was becoming resentful instead of happy <br/>
to help her. And she was so totally unconscious of the impact of this driving on the other <br/>
kids or my ability to keep up with other demands in the family.<br/>
<br/>
I finally took a two week break. I told her that it was summer and that while I love that <br/>
she&#39;s going out with friends so much, I needed to have a driving vacation where I could be <br/>
home with the other kids without the pressure of taking and picking up all the time (some <br/>
of these escapades would turn into driving to one place, picking up and taking to another <br/>
and then later picking up to bring home).<br/>
<br/>
I told her that she could arrange any rides she wanted or she could have the &quot;gang&quot; to our <br/>
house, but I just needed a two week break.<br/>
<br/>
She wasn&#39;t too happy at the time, but she did amazingly start finding other rides. And for <br/>
the first time, she invited this group of teens to our house (she had them over twice I think <br/>
and that snowballed into other times).<br/>
<br/>
After those two weeks, I actually felt better about making a true evaluation of each <br/>
request. I had forgotten that just because I am home doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m available. If I plan <br/>
to have a day at home with the younger kids, I can tell her that I&#39;m not available for driving <br/>
that day.<br/>
<br/>
I still drove her lots last summer, but I felt much more freedom to make decisions that <br/>
involved me as well as her. We got more creative about where she went and how often and <br/>
with whom.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; She really does not seem aware of how much she asks for.  And she constantly <br/>
 </span></blockquote>complains like our family and our home are not good enough for her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was true in our family too. We have Father&#39;s Day coming up and we are planning a big <br/>
breakfast for him. Her only thought is will it interferre with seeing her friends who will be <br/>
at her church that day...<br/>
<br/>
I do understand how consuming friends are at this age. What I had forgotten is that they <br/>
don&#39;t have to consume me too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Although I have asked if she could help me out (and in a nice way) she continually says <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;no, she doesn&#39;t feel like it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This is one thing I did find. I would say, &quot;I can drive you at 6:00 if I get the dishes cleaned <br/>
up and the living room straightened before then. If you&#39;d like to help me, great. If not, <br/>
that&#39;s fine, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be done in time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I would do it as I could. If she saw 6 approaching and I still hadn&#39;t gotten done what I <br/>
had planned, she was more likely to get in gear and help.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t threatening. The cleaning or other task has to be legitimate. But I think she had <br/>
stopped seeing that her life was impacted by her dirty dishes or messy couches (she leaves <br/>
her notebooks and writing stuff everywhere).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Once again, today, she said she would help out and do some stuff for me if.......<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now the time has come, she wants me to drive her to somewhere, and once again she <br/>
 </span></blockquote>has done absolutely NOTHING to help me out.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I am feeling VERY taken advantage of and overwhelmed with the stuff that needs done in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>between running her everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
You are being taken advantage of, but not consciously. Iow, she isn&#39;t being malicious. <br/>
She&#39;s just not aware of her impact. It helped me to make that distinction.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Should I drive her?  I&quot;m really inclined to say &quot;no&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just say &quot;no&quot; sometimes when you need to.<br/>
<br/>
One last little story.<br/>
<br/>
I knew I was not taking care of me (had lost the sense of being a real person in her eyes) <br/>
when one time I picked her up (after a very complicated driving scenario that involved <br/>
driving multiple kids multiple places) and she was appalled at my seventies rock station on <br/>
the radio. I explained that she was free to change it now, but she wasn&#39;t in the car before <br/>
and so I listened to what I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Her reply shocked me: &quot;But you shouldn&#39;t even listen to it then. It&#39;s a terrible station.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was the turning and breaking point for me. I didn&#39;t have enough gravitas in her life <br/>
for me to have my own radio station preferences when she wasn&#39;t around? I knew change <br/>
was in order.<br/>
<br/>
A year later (now) we are in a much better groove about driving - I&#39;m not resentful, she&#39;s <br/>
more careful about giving me notice and finding rides. She&#39;s been more helpful with the <br/>
house. And she is more conscious of me as a person, not just a ride-giver.<br/>
<br/>
And she still focuses primarily on friends over family. But there is peace and I do enjoy her <br/>
now again.<br/>

Maybe planning the night before, or keeping better notes on what&#39;s needed when would help.  &quot;Clean up before Friday&quot; could go on the list along with &quot;Movie with friends&quot; or &quot;dye hair&quot; and both could check the list as part of the day.<br/>

I have always been very honest with my three children 16, 13, and 9, about <br/>
our finances.  We have always made a practice of shopping clearance, yard sales, <br/>
thrift stores, and also freecycling. Since I have always worked in retail, <br/>
and very savvy about the cycle of seasonal transitions. Get to know when your <br/>
local retailers are transitioning each department, and you can save a lot of <br/>
money on clearance items that are discontinued. My children are also aware if <br/>
this practice, and know that they can probably wait a little longer for certain <br/>
items that will eventually be clearanced.  It&#39;s fun to watch their sense of <br/>
accomplishment when they get a bargain. <br/>
We do not pay them for regular household chores, because they are part of <br/>
their family responsibility. I keep a list of extra work around the house that <br/>
they can get paid for.  They also make their own money with a variety of <br/>
different jobs. My oldest daughter baby-sits, and will be starting a new job soon. <br/>
She&#39;s also great at recycling clothes, and making new creations out of them.<br/>
 My son collects golf balls from the golf course and resells them to the <br/>
golfers, does some pet sitting, and helps some of our elderly neighbors with heavy <br/>
chores. <br/>
My youngest daughter is still learning, and can be a bit needy at times, but <br/>
I have confidence that she will catch on too. <br/>
Even when finances are not so tight, I like for them to learn to save the <br/>
surplus and invest it for the future. <br/>
I have also heard the argument that our family and home aren&#39;t good enough <br/>
for my oldest dd. When it&#39;s just me, I would let it roll off of my back, and <br/>
don&#39;t take it personally. If the younger ones are around to overhear it, then we <br/>
will all sit down and discuss it, so that everyone has a chance to voice their <br/>
own opinion. It was more common when she was in school, and the fact that we <br/>
live in an upscale neighborhood didn&#39;t help. She has since grown and matured, <br/>
and has learned that life is so much more than make-up, hair, and material <br/>
things. <br/>

I&#39;ve already switched from using an ATM card to using cash, so that they can <br/>
visually see that when its gone, its gone. And in order to be able to afford <br/>
hair dye, SHE had to make the grocery list so that I had enough to buy <br/>
groceries and give her the money for the dye.  I also did this so that I would not <br/>
have to hear her complain about the lack of stuff to eat here.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>=============<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 6, 5 and 4, and here&#39;s what we do, which has been pretty<br/>
successful.<br/>
<br/>
A while back, we read an email called the sustainable earth--it&#39;s a book,<br/>
too, I think.<br/>
&quot;If the world were a village of 100 people...&quot;  Lots of the statistics are<br/>
exaggerated, I&#39;m told, but it&#39;s interesting nonetheless. The statistics say<br/>
things like most of the world lives on less than $2 a day, so we decided to<br/>
figure out how much money we live on per day, and our budget developed out<br/>
of this.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, we figured out our major expenses on an excel spreadsheet that I<br/>
use to track our monthly household expenses.  We just used the big<br/>
categories like mortgage, car (insurance and gas), groceries, utilities and<br/>
savings. We took the percentage of our entire household income that goes<br/>
towards each category, say 13% or 5%, whatever. Once we figured out that<br/>
percentage, the kids chose a dollar amount that they wanted as their monthly<br/>
income--we settled on $40 a month per child. I wanted something big enough<br/>
that they actually had a sense of what it was like to take care of monthly<br/>
expenses--what I do each month to keep the household running. The kids pay<br/>
out the same percentage from their monthly income that I do for each<br/>
category, and whatever is left over is theirs to spend.  So, for instance,<br/>
if our mortgage is 13% of our total household income, then the kids would<br/>
take 13% of their $40 to put in the mortgage envelope.<br/>
<br/>
We chose to do it this way because this is how we deal with money, and we<br/>
wanted our kids to see and understand that. A certain amount comes in; a<br/>
certain amount goes out. We try to put a percentage into savings each month,<br/>
and the rest is mine or dh&#39;s or the kids&#39; to play with--clothes, toys,<br/>
books, movies, whatever.  We don&#39;t tie the kids&#39; money to chores--it&#39;s just<br/>
their income. In the same way that I don&#39;t have to do certain chores each<br/>
month to get money from dh. I get money by being a member of the household<br/>
even though I don&#39;t actively bring money into the house.<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago, the kids each opened a savings account, and the $5 that is<br/>
budgeted<br/>
for savings will go into their account instead of the household account<br/>
where it used to go.<br/>
That way they&#39;ll get to see money accrue over time without have to take it<br/>
out of the $6.60<br/>
they get each month, which isn&#39;t a lot.<br/>
<br/>
The kids actually like paying the bills each month, and I think it really<br/>
gives them a clear sense of where the money goes. Even though they&#39;re young,<br/>
they understand that we have to pay for water and electricity and insurance<br/>
in the same way that we pay for groceries and toys. Doing the budget this<br/>
way takes the hidden expenses of a household and makes them real and<br/>
visible. The kids are very understanding when I pay bills twice each month,<br/>
and they&#39;re happy to give me the 15 or 20 minutes that it takes to get it<br/>
done because they know it&#39;s important. They also seem to understand more<br/>
clearly when I say that we can&#39;t afford to do something or buy something<br/>
because they *know* where our money is actually going. The older two,<br/>
anyway, get that there&#39;s only a limited amount of money coming in each month<br/>
and that it has to go specific places before we can spend any. I think the<br/>
biggest<br/>
thing is transparency--letting the kids see the money coming in and going<br/>
out and all<br/>
the things we do to keep track of it. The kids see me not only paying bills,<br/>
but entering<br/>
our receipts into an excel spreadsheet every month, keeping track of what<br/>
we&#39;ve spent<br/>
and where it&#39;s gone.<br/>

-=I&quot;m not sure I follow--are you saying that discussing differences in<br/>
family/country economics is damaging to the parent/child relationship?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did it sound like I said that?  <br/>
Discussing differences and discussing economics isn&#39;t the same as always telling them that they have cushy lives compared to parents or others.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;Your life is luxurious&quot; is often a backhanded way to say &quot;stop whining,&quot; or &quot;Be grateful&quot; or &quot;You are ignorant of realities and should be more appreciative.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those aren&#39;t nice things to say, really.<br/>
<br/>
And if someone &quot;ALWAYS&quot; says things like that, it&#39;s not indicative of a healthy attitude (on the part of the parent) nor will it create a better attitude in the child.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m always telling my child his life is WAY better than mine was&quot; does not equal &quot;We have discussed economics.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;telling them they should appreciate their lives as<br/>
compared to [yours as a kid?  children starving in China?] &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was a child my mother used to say, &quot;There are children starving in<br/>
India&quot;, entirely in order to guilt me into finishing the food on my plate. I<br/>
remember finally saying &quot;they can have this then&quot; and being sent to the<br/>
kitchen to finish eating standing up at the counter. I also remember<br/>
continuing to *think* &quot;send them this&quot; with resentment ever after when my<br/>
mother came out with her phrase. I guess she heard it when she was young. We<br/>
were both very overweight as pre-teens, and shoveled our food in FAST.<br/>
<br/>
It was hardly a discussion of economics, and completely damaging to our<br/>
already damaged relationship. At the time we lived in a place where hungry<br/>
and desperately poor hordes seemed all around us - Hong Kong in the 1960&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
My mother was born in 1934 - the height of the Depression - with &quot;Do not<br/>
waste&quot; anything being the mantra of her parents. My grandmother used to save<br/>
every leftover (from the pot - plates had to be cleaned remember!), wrapped<br/>
in aluminum foil in the fridge, intending to have it with an egg the next<br/>
day but rarely doing so. There were always numerous unidentified packages in<br/>
there that eventually had to be tossed. Yet they had no compost heap in<br/>
their garden, as I now recall. Only leaves and grass clippings were used as<br/>
mulch. <br/>
<br/>
I remember being either hungry - no snacks - and looking longingly at the<br/>
color pages of cookbooks, or feeling over-stuffed. I remember white linen<br/>
table cloths and napkins in each person&#39;s silver napkin ring engraved with<br/>
our names sitting in a basket on the table. Mine was small with etched<br/>
diamond shapes, my grandparents were wider oval shapes. Nan had a spare set<br/>
that were bamboo with some asian carving on them that might have been sent<br/>
from Hong Kong, and were used for guests.<br/>

My mother still does that. Look into her refrigerator: you&#39;ll find dozens  of <br/>
little plates and bowls, covered with saran wrap---maybe with 11 lima beans  <br/>
in it or one slice of a tomato or a spoonful of corn. <br/>
 <br/>
Crazy. Eat it, give it to the dog, or compost it.<br/>

<br/>
My point was missed.<br/>
I thought I wrote clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Telling someone something repeatedly (&quot;I tell them all the time&quot; or whatever) <br/>
is probably a mistake if the goal is a good relationship with that person.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe more parents should appreciate their lives in contrast to families in <br/>
which the parents have already totally botched the relationship with their <br/>
children.  If your kids are still talking to you freely, and care about what you <br/>
have to say, don&#39;t ruin it by mouthing platitudes.  Really TALK to them, about <br/>
themselves, your real feelings, not your theoretical feelings or statistical <br/>
feelings or statements about what you think they SHOULD appreciate.  What about <br/>
what you as a parent DO appreciate, and what your kids appreciate?   You <br/>
don&#39;t need to have stock dialogs, generic conversations.<br/>
<br/>
There are things I&#39;ve told my kids too many times.  I should have thought of <br/>
other ways to convey my concerns.  <br/>

&quot;I&#39;m always telling my child his life is WAY better than mine was&quot; does not <br/>
equal &quot;We have discussed economics.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
---------------------------------<br/>
Often in our family we&#39;ll all be sitting around talking (even more so when a <br/>
relative is here) and we will instead tell funny stories about our lives as <br/>
kids in the &quot;70&#39;s&quot; and how different things were.<br/>
<br/>
For example, we had one car, and if we wanted to go anywhere we&#39;d have to get <br/>
up at the crack of dawn and drive our dad to work, then pick him up.  My <br/>
sister and I would have to sit in the back of that hot, vinyl seated car and sweat <br/>
watching the airplane plant for our dad to walk out.  It always felt so good <br/>
when we&#39;d see him walking toward us with his lunch pail swinging!<br/>
<br/>
Or stuff like having one TV, with the dial knob, and only about 8 channels to <br/>
choose from.  My husband grew up with only 3 channels, and at one time they <br/>
had to use 2 TV&#39;s...one on the bottom had a picture and no sound, and the one <br/>
on top with sound but no picture!!  Or our one video game being &quot;Pong.&quot;  Woo <br/>
hoo!!  LOL...we&#39;d still spend hours playing it!!<br/>
<br/>
Telling interesting, funny stories from our childhood, not meant in the least <br/>
to shame or make our kids feel more thankful for what they have, stick with a <br/>
kid much more than lecturing, I think.  I know the stories I heard from my <br/>
mom really touched me and made me appreciate how hard her life was, and how well <br/>
she rose above it.<br/>

-------------------------------------<br/>
We get National Geographic, and our kids always look at it, so I know they <br/>
have to realize how much better off Americans are than the rest of the world.  <br/>
We&#39;d also sometimes pick up the free Maryknoll magazines after Church and look <br/>
at them.  I guess the key is to talk about them without telling the kids how <br/>
much better they have things.  That&#39;s easy enough to figure out by just looking <br/>
at the pictures!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s how it is here.<br/>
<br/>
My mom was in Carlsbad, NM, during the war.  She was a teenager.  She used to <br/>
tell us stories about ration stamps, and about blackouts when the air raid <br/>
sirens sounded, and about kids learning to identify planes (adults too, but it <br/>
was a &quot;war effort&quot; thing kids did).  I&#39;ve thought sometimes about the <br/>
differences it would mean in our lives if we HAD to sometimes do sudden <br/>
lights-out/silence, and if we had to eat beans and biscuits day after day.  I think about it, <br/>
but I don&#39;t use it to shame our kids.<br/>
<br/>
We have a refrigerator magnet that&#39;s been there for years.  It says &quot;When I <br/>
was young we didn&#39;t have MTV.  We had to take drugs and go to concerts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When parents say &quot;I wish I&#39;d had this when I was a kid!&quot; it still can move <br/>
kids to appreciate what they have, and to be aware of where they are on the <br/>
technological-advancement scale.    People can discuss differences without aiming <br/>
to make the kids feel unappreciative.<br/>

We used to do this to Benny Hill reruns LOL.<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
I watched Benny Hill just to hear him do an American accent, to see what he <br/>
would screw up.  The other humor was outdated or too British for me to fathom, <br/>
but sometimes he would do a country&western song, and I would listen to see <br/>
what he could pronounce &quot;wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ever since, I&#39;ve loved to hear Brits do American accents.   Kenneth Branagh <br/>
in &quot;Dead Again&quot; only made one mistake, and a very minor one.<br/>
<br/>
Lately there&#39;s a whole rash of Brits playing Americans, notably Colin <br/>
Farrell.  Marty heard him doing his own voice and thought he was an American doing an <br/>
Irish accent.  And Michael Caine, in Secondhand Lions, in the extras on the <br/>
DVD talks about how he was coached to do a Texas accent.  It wasn&#39;t perfect, <br/>
but in some bursts it was stunning.  And his character (as we had already <br/>
discussed as we watched it and as he pointed out too) was supposed to have been in <br/>
Europe and Africa for most of his life.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I would never have been able to turn the sound off on Benny Hill, <br/>
tacky-awful show that it was.  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one actor I can rarely understand at all is Robert Carlyle, but he <br/>
was on a James Bond movie doing a Russian accent, and I could understand him <br/>
perfectly well. <br/>
