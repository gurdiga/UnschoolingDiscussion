<div id="ygrps-yiv-380039103">I enjoy John&#39;s essays too.  Thank you for sharing them!  I can appreciate<br/>
the sentiment behind Buy Nothing Day and also agree that overall<br/>
consumption really is the main issue.  In the long run it doesn&#39;t make<br/>
any difference WHEN you buy stuff, if you continue to buy more than you<br/>
need!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing a lot of soul-searching in the past year on simplifying<br/>
and one of my major issues continues to be STUFF!  Although I and my<br/>
children have received many wonderful, thoughtful gifts from family and<br/>
friends, we have also received a lot of stuff that we never would have<br/>
chosen to bring into our house.  Dh and I are both genetically pack rats.<br/>
 It&#39;s very hard for us to get rid of something that someone special gave<br/>
to us (or to the kids).  We have boxes in the garage that dh actually<br/>
said &quot;we are saving so our kids can store it in their garages&quot;.  Our<br/>
decorating style is &quot;that used to be mom&#39;s and we will find somewhere to<br/>
stick it&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
Although I appreciate those who are motivated to hand-make or find the<br/>
right gift at a thrift shop, I would prefer to just plain NOT RECEIVE<br/>
more stuff that I don&#39;t need.  (Hope I don&#39;t sound too Grinchy.  It&#39;s not<br/>
the giving of gifts itself that bothers me.  It&#39;s the *mandatory* gift<br/>
giving that comes with this holiday season.)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of thrift shops, I found a pair of brand new GAP jeans, my size,<br/>
for $3.  Someone raised a good point about not buying things that support<br/>
poor labor practices.  Well, we can each only work on so many cause at a<br/>
time, but the whole &quot;gotta have the name brand issue&quot; is sure food for<br/>
thought.<br/>

<br/>
We have lots of the same issues over here.<br/>
we celebrate christmas with the whole family (so far 7 grandchildren) and<br/>
the other <br/>
family (already up to two great -grandchildren). Every year it is<br/>
completely insane!<br/>
In both families we have decided to exchange names for getting gifts for<br/>
the adults which isn&#39;t so bad because you get to really think about what<br/>
that person would want.<br/>
I have decided on things that can be used (pottery, candles, towels,<br/>
clothes,etc..) or consumables. You usually can not go wrong with<br/>
food...especially something they can freeze for later. Also, I started<br/>
two years ago making family calendars. I collect pictures throughout the<br/>
year and in december I make them into a calendar with a different picture<br/>
for every month. This is a big hit, esp. with the grandparents. This has<br/>
become a family tradition on both sides. It has even brought my family<br/>
together more and encouraged group photos at Thanksgiving. I don&#39;t like<br/>
to shop. I like to make things (and I hope to instill this in my children<br/>
as well).<br/>
<br/>
So, this year I suggested we let the children exchange names because they<br/>
always get entirely tooooooooo much stuff! And people are actually<br/>
counting gifts and paying attention to spend the same amount of $ on each<br/>
person. It&#39;s ridiculous! But, I got horrible looks and &quot;but it&#39;s for the<br/>
children.&quot;  Now really, Is it for the children? Because I would hope that<br/>
my children would not learn this holiday habit.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we&#39;re lost, my husband and I feel like the only one&#39;s in our<br/>
family that get it!<br/>
We are truly happy with not having so much stuff. My garage is out of<br/>
control and that&#39;s how I feel too.   <br/>
<br/>
Soory to ramble but the need was there<br/>
Kathy in Houston, but moving soon!<br/>

Kathy, we draw names for the adults and the kids on one side of the family,<br/>
because there&#39;s so many of us (16 adults and 21 children). It&#39;s the only way<br/>
to go in a large family, IMO. We set a $$ limit on the gifts, also. The kids<br/>
still get a haul.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358036122">Deirdre, I am applauding your passionate speech!<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I have to admit that I have not been as mindful as I <br/>
could have been in the past about consumer issues. (I was raised as a <br/>
shopaholic, bargain hunter.)  I have been trying to change that in the last <br/>
year and a half, but it is sometimes so very confusing and <br/>
difficult...especially ridding oneself of plastic stuff. It&#39;s everywhere! <br/>
Making changes in one&#39;s lifestyle requires a lot of research and <br/>
decision-making and I often feel overwhelmed with the information I have <br/>
gathered; the choices are often not clear. Sometimes I think I&#39;m making the <br/>
&quot;best&quot; choice but it turns out later that I was misinformed. Plus our <br/>
shopping choices are sometimes limited by selection (big stores are taking <br/>
over), or by what we can afford. You can&#39;t always find your size or fit in <br/>
a second-hand clothing store. My son needs new underwear every year; I <br/>
would love to buy organic cotton but that Hanes is on sale 2   3-packs for <br/>
$5.00. Do I take my organic vegetables home from the store in a plastic <br/>
bag? What can I substitute for polyester fleece (made from petrochemicals), <br/>
which is so warm, if I&#39;m allergic to wool and so much cotton is full of <br/>
pesticides?  I ordered a really good-quality pair of pants from a <br/>
mail-order place, thinking I will spend a little more to get a pair that <br/>
will fit right and last a long time so I only need to buy once, only to <br/>
find out that they are making most of their clothes overseas. You get the <br/>
idea... As an average person, bombarded with advertisements and inducements <br/>
to want more (as you said, even harder for kids who are assaulted with toy <br/>
ads and Happy Meals), trying to make ends meet, and trying to sort out <br/>
information that changes daily, I can see why a lot of people give up <br/>
trying to make a change. Of course, public confusion aids those big <br/>
companies trying to make the biggest profit.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like my one action isn&#39;t even a drop in the bucket. BUT I am still <br/>
going to try! It&#39;s just that it will take lots of little steps forward, <br/>
with the occasional slip backwards. Buy Nothing Day and similar campaigns, <br/>
to me, ask people to think twice about what they really need before making <br/>
a purchase, which lots of people on this list already do, but so many <br/>
people in America don&#39;t. I would always like to learn more. Is there a <br/>
discussion group on this topic that you could recommend?<br/>

&gt;    From: &quot;Deirdre Malfatto&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:yafael@...">yafael@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;Subject: RE: buy nothing day<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Did you know that the majority of the clothes made by Nike, The<br/>
&gt;Gap (which includes Old Navy and Banana Republic), Guess, and<br/>
&gt;Oshkosh are made in overseas sweatshops that treat, often<br/>
&gt;underaged, workers miserably?  When we buy clothes, toys,<br/>
&gt;housewares, gadgets, etc. that are made in China, Malaysia,<br/>
&gt;Vietnam, etc., etc., we are very often buying items made by workers<br/>
&gt;who are payed less in a month than we pay for a single Gap t-shirt<br/>
&gt;here?  Workers are made to work incredibly long hours, often<br/>
&gt;seven days a week, in terrible conditions, and then can afford only<br/>
&gt;to go home to their rat-infested shantytown without running water or<br/>
&gt;electricity? The Gap, for one, says they are doing something about<br/>
&gt;this, but a little research (try Coop America&#39;s site for a start --<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.coopamerica.org/)">http://www.coopamerica.org/)</a> shows that what they are saying is<br/>
&gt;mostly doublespeak.  Often even items that say they are made in<br/>
&gt;USA (and the Gap is a prime offender here) are made in Saipan,<br/>
&gt;which is under US rule, but still is home to many sweatshops.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And what happens to all the things we buy &quot;cheap&quot; in order to save<br/>
&gt;money? What happens to all the cheap plastic toys that break or<br/>
&gt;clothes that fall apart are too grungy after the kids have outgrown<br/>
&gt;them to pass on?  What happens to all the plastic shopping bags<br/>
&gt;that we bring things home in and all the plastic that pretty new things<br/>
&gt;are wrapped in?  We toss it all, and it adds to landfill and pollution.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And where does all this plastic come from?  And where does the<br/>
&gt;energy come from to run the factories these things are made in?<br/>
&gt;Most often from our waning petroleum stores.  And what about<br/>
&gt;wood toys and paper bags? Only a small percentage of that is<br/>
&gt;being taken from sustainably managed forests.  The rest comes<br/>
&gt;from old forests that are being chopped down so that we can have<br/>
&gt;things cheap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And why do we need all this stuff to begin with?  Often because we<br/>
&gt;are told we need it.  Commercials, advertisements, prominent<br/>
&gt;logos, peer pressure, etc. etc. all make us feel there is something<br/>
&gt;lacking in our lives if we don&#39;t have the latest this or enough that.<br/>
&gt;Our children are hit especially hard by this, and it wreaks havoc on<br/>
&gt;their self-esteem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When we make do without or buy things used or buy products<br/>
&gt;made with sustainably managed materials and support companies<br/>
&gt;that treat their workers well, we are doing our part to support human<br/>
&gt;rights and a clean environment and a better world (a world at all) for<br/>
&gt;our children and our grandchildren to grow up in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Buy Nothing Day reminds us of these things. If enough people<br/>
&gt;refuse to be coerced into buying new things on that day, it can send<br/>
&gt;a message to the big corporations that we don&#39;t want sweatshops<br/>
&gt;or child labor or so much waste and that we don&#39;t want them to<br/>
&gt;coopt our children.  But even if only one person participates in Buy<br/>
&gt;Nothing Day, it can remind that person that there are things we can<br/>
&gt;do on a personal level to remove ourselves from the cruelties being<br/>
&gt;inflicted on other human beings and our planet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252284679">&quot;Christmas is for the Children&quot;!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Kathy, you hit that nail on the head!  I struggle with wanting to<br/>
fulfill my children&#39;s wishes and use Christmas as an excuse to buy them<br/>
things (the way I was raised) - and keeping the whole gift thing very low<br/>
scale so that is not &quot;what the holiday means to them&quot; - and dealing with<br/>
relatives who agree on no adult gift exchanges but let&#39;s all still buy<br/>
for the kids because Christmas is for the Children!  So even if I only<br/>
got one gift for each of my kids they would still end up with a lot of<br/>
stuff (not necessarily stuff that we even need or want).  And I am stuck<br/>
with feeling guilty if I don&#39;t buy for nieces and nephews since their<br/>
folks are buying for mine.<br/>
<br/>
With dh&#39;s siblings and some cousins, we have an annual white elephant<br/>
party.  Each person brings one gift and leaves with one gift.  There are<br/>
variations, but we draw numbers and starting with #1 each person selects<br/>
and opens a gift.  #2 can choose a new gift or &quot;steal&quot; #1&#39;s.  Then #1<br/>
would get to choose again.  It is a blast and fulfills the need to<br/>
select, wrap, and open gifts.  The best part is that we all enjoy each<br/>
other&#39;s company for a day with a big potluck meal to boot.  We usually do<br/>
this a week or two before Christmas.  (In spite of this, they still buy<br/>
more for the children.)<br/>
<br/>
I think gifts that are edible are amongst the best, too!<br/>

<br/>
That is so cool.  I want to do that with my friends.  And it doesn&#39;t matter <br/>
in such a situation about the relative value or size of the gifts or anything.<br/>
<br/>
In the SCA we have tournaments sometimes (medievalish combat &lt;g&gt;) and each <br/>
person brings a prize and they&#39;re all laid out (visible).  When the <br/>
tournament&#39;s over, the person who scored highest picks first.  Prized <br/>
typically range from a helm or a pair of gauntlets on down to a roll of duct <br/>
tape (which they use to wrap the rattan swords) or a beer, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter.  A guy who makes gauntlets (or who donated those! &lt;g&gt;) won&#39;t want <br/>
that prize, and the guy who comes in last takes what&#39;s left.    It&#39;s a way to <br/>
get  some good prizes at no expense to the sponsoring group, and to <br/>
facilitate an exchange of artistry for those things which were handmade <br/>
(hoods, the beer, the dagger maybe) and people can still furnish a prize even <br/>
if he goes and buys a dozen candles.  No problem.<br/>
