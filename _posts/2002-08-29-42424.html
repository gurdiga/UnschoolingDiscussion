 </span></blockquote>My bestfriend, Penny, and I try to get together a few times a month to <br/>
scrapbook and let the kids play. Two weekends ago we were discussing her dd, <br/>
Alex, starting school the following Monday. I asked if Alex was ready, and <br/>
her reply was of course she is ready! She was ready last year, but since her <br/>
birthday falls later in September, she had to wait a year. She continued to <br/>
say that if Alex had been born just a few weeks earlier, she would have sent <br/>
her last year. I stepped off the cliff and informed her that Alex really <br/>
didn&#39;t *have* to go until she was 7, and there are opinions that delayed <br/>
schooling was good for children. I went on about reading readiness and other <br/>
things when she stopped me and said Alex was/is ready to read now. I made the <br/>
comment that it wasn&#39;t all that bad to delay reading until a child was older <br/>
and she stated that if a child read at a later date, the child would have <br/>
problems later in life. I offered that I doubted she could tell if a child at <br/>
16 had learned to read at 5 or 6 or if said child hadn&#39;t learned to read at <br/>
9, 10, or even 12. (she looked at me blankly and shrugged) I offered to loan <br/>
her my Holt or Gatto books. (I really think her kids would love to homeschool <br/>
and have told her so in the past.) She just can&#39;t get past the <br/>
have-to-go-to-school-at-5 attitude. Both Alex and her little brother have <br/>
been in daycare (if you can call it that, they were in my home) since birth <br/>
or preschool since the age of 3. She will never accept that what I do is <br/>
natural or right. She firmly believes the choice she has made (along with the <br/>
masses) is the superior choice. She never misses a chance to tell me all the <br/>
things Moly and Jack have missed out on by not going to school. She can&#39;t <br/>
accept that Jack&#39;s one year of school was enough. <br/>
<br/>
I was devastated the first day of school last year. And almost everyday after <br/>
that was a battle in my head and heart. I stayed in Jack&#39;s class that first <br/>
day until the teacher finally told the parents (who were there) it was time <br/>
to go. I was always on of the last to drop my child off every morning, and <br/>
one of the first to pick him up. I told that to Penny the other day and she <br/>
said, Yeah, there were parents at the school like that. She stated it didn&#39;t <br/>
have any effect on her to leave her daughter off at school, in fact it <br/>
excited her that the venture had *finally* started. I asked Alex the other <br/>
day how she was liking school (with warning looks from Penny) all I got was a <br/>
dull *fine* I asked whether or not she liked riding the bus and Alex shrugged <br/>
and said it was *okay, but very loud* later I told Penny I didn&#39;t think Alex <br/>
was liking school as much as she would have me believe. This is what she said <br/>
to me, *Alex likes school just fine, just because she isn&#39;t as excited about <br/>
it doesn&#39;t mean anything. School isn&#39;t new to Alex, she has been going since <br/>
she was 3 and I shouldn&#39;t read anything into her lackluster replies.* All I <br/>
could say was it is too bad for Alex that Penny feels that way. <br/>
<br/>
My point in this long post? I know that the decision I have made is the only <br/>
right and true way. I don&#39;t want my children to have *lackluster* lives. <br/>
Penny OTOH firmly believes that her choice is the only right way. She knows <br/>
the choices I have made will come back to *bite me in the ass* someday. She <br/>
thinks my homeschooling the kids is weird, she knows they will never learn <br/>
anything if I don&#39;t use a curriculum. The day I told her (years ago) that I <br/>
didn&#39;t plan on sending either of my kids to school she told me this. &quot;Nancy, <br/>
I know you, and I know you won&#39;t be able to pull this off. You better get a <br/>
damn good curriculum and force yourself to stick to it or your kids will <br/>
suffer the consequences!&quot; When I try to talk to her about homeschooling (I <br/>
don&#39;t know why I do, other than I love her kids like my own.) she puts up a <br/>
wall, she sees it as me criticizing her. So although we all know <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling is the right choice, we will always know people who <br/>
know that going to school is the right choice. <br/>
