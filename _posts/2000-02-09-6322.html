<div id="ygrps-yiv-461723370">Last night we went to see The Bejing Opera Theater.  It was a very<br/>
interesting experience.  It is not like western opera at all.  The stage was<br/>
set simply with a square carpet for the actors area to perform.  The<br/>
backdrop was a sort of silk screen with a large fabric grass plant, flower<br/>
and chinese letters on the screen.  The only props used were a table, chair<br/>
and a few martial arts weapons.  They performed 4 pieces from different<br/>
plays.  These pieces are very ancient...some being from the time of the<br/>
1400&#39;s!  The actors in chinese opera begin their training at the age of 10.<br/>
These young children are picked from thousands of applicants.  Their day<br/>
begins at 5am and ends at night after rehearsals.  At age 18 they finish<br/>
their training and some never become actors but perhaps stagehands, prop<br/>
designers, etc.  The description of their training by our friend and leading<br/>
chinese scholar in chinese theater was that it was akin to ballet, martial<br/>
arts, and singing.  It is a very ancient tradition and there are set pieces<br/>
that traditionally are performed.  We saw Kunju opera which is apparently<br/>
more sophisticated and refined than some other types of chinese opera.  The<br/>
costumes were gorgeous with bright colors of silk and many layered in some<br/>
cases.  They had an interesting way of walking...a quick sort of<br/>
running...which made the actors appear to almost float.  We sat with some<br/>
friends from the wushu center...they are chinese.  When we were done and<br/>
were all walking to the car we said we had wished we knew chinese to<br/>
understand the words.  They didn&#39;t understand it either apparently.  The way<br/>
that the words are spoken or sung are elongated and executed with many high<br/>
pitched sounds.  Some of it sounded almost screetchy.  But, it was beautiful<br/>
to watch and I admired the extensive training that these people had gone<br/>
through for their art form.<br/>

<br/>
A good place to read about what&#39;s involved in the training is Jackie Chan&#39;s <br/>
autobiography, I Am Jackie Chan - My Life in Action.  He was trained in <br/>
Chinese opera and gives vivid discriptions of what the life was like (very <br/>
difficult).  This book is a lot of fun if you are a Jackie Chan fan.  We LOVE <br/>
his movies at our house!  Lots of action, very little real violence.  They&#39;re <br/>
kind of silly instead of being really scary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259731096">My dd&#39;s teacher has been in movies with Jackie Chan and has talked about his<br/>
training at the wushu center.  Dd&#39;s teacher is Master Hu Jianjiang and has<br/>
been in Shogun, Shaolin Temple and many others.  I haven&#39;t read his<br/>
biography but it sounds like something we might like.  Thanks!<br/>
