<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110173240">Weaning from night nursing has always been one of the hardest for my kids.<br/>
One was bribed with toys. Another ... well, he was just told one night, &quot;I<br/>
can&#39;t do this anymore!&quot;  He was older than two and had a younger sibling who<br/>
was still nursing at night as well.  I just couldn&#39;t function anymore!  He<br/>
woke up for 4 nights.  The first night he fussed, didn&#39;t cry, for about 20<br/>
minutes the first time he woke up.  I was there with him, talking to him<br/>
about it.  I do wish I had talked to him about it a bit first.  I told him<br/>
that night, when we went to bed.  It wasn&#39;t really fair to him or the other<br/>
sleepers in my room!  They all would have appreciated some warning. :)<br/>
<br/>
With a 2 yo, I would suggest having help from another adult.  When I weaned<br/>
Michael from night nursing, I had just read a snippet from one of Dr. Sears&#39;<br/>
books that said they weaned from night time around 18 months as another baby<br/>
was on the way.  I thought, if he can do an 18 month old, I can certainly<br/>
wean Michael!  He still nursed during the day but we did stop through the<br/>
night.  It helped immensely!<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Sears recommends having someone else walk the halls with the one who is<br/>
being weaned for a few night to a couple of weeks.  My dh would not have<br/>
been capable of that.  He doesn&#39;t deal with crying and frustration easily<br/>
but if yours can and will ...<br/>
<br/>
I know when I weaned Maggie, she cried one night for awhile, poor Michael<br/>
sat up in bed and said, &quot;just nurse her mom so **I** can go back to sleep!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While I hate to see my kids cry, I could not take nursing her through the<br/>
night anymore. She was a few months past her 4th birthday.  Everytime I<br/>
rolled over, she would arouse to nurse.  I would lay there, afraid to move<br/>
at night. After a couple of nights, she was fine.<br/>
<br/>
A good tip, too, is to have dad and older child sleep in another room.  If<br/>
toddler wants to nurse, let him/her come to you and then put them back in<br/>
the other room.  After awhile, maybe he won&#39;t be waking anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you.  I know how hard it can be to tandem nurse.  I have done it a<br/>
total of 4 years and didn&#39;t particularly enjoy it but it was what my kids<br/>
needed.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Are you wanting to wean him or just stop or slow the night nursing?<br/>
Heather<br/>
&gt; &gt;isn&#39;t trying to wean Kaelin, just sleep a little more.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Tia<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m first off looking to slow/stop the night nursing, because of the 4 mo<br/>
&gt; old.  I just NEVER get a decent sleep since they never want to nurse at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; same time.  If I turn from one to the other, that&#39;s it.  And the 2 year<br/>
old<br/>
&gt; seems to want to sleep ON me, rather than with me.  So I&#39;m really trapped<br/>
&gt; between the kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d hate to make him stop all together, it&#39;s so important to him.  But<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; really hard on my system.  (Of course, I&#39;m losing a ton of weight.  I lost<br/>
5<br/>
&gt; lbs between Thanksgiving and Xmas.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-863888133"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My 3 year old grandson is like that. Heather just started trying something<br/>
&gt;that a bunch of women on a board she frequents have done. She talked to him<br/>
&gt;about it during the evening, then made a game of counting to ten and then<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s time for him to let go. Surprisingly, he was agreeable, but it&#39;s only<br/>
&gt;been one night so far. He only asked to nurse twice last night instead of<br/>
&gt;most of the night. (The 16 month old actually nurses less at night.)<br/>
&gt;Tia<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m in the same boat.  I have a 7 year old who slept in his bed for the<br/>
first time in YEARS last night.  He&#39;d been sleeping on the couch.  Mostly<br/>
with his dad who is escaping the 2.5 yr old and the 4 mos old.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done the same 1 to 10 thing with the 2 year old.  He&#39;s ok about it,<br/>
sometimes.  But he will tell me not to count!  We also do a &quot;just a slurp&quot;<br/>
routine.  I can pretty much get him to roll over at night, but he has really<br/>
upped his nursing since the little one was born.  I think it&#39;s partly stress<br/>
and partly &#39;cause it tastes better again.  -grin-<br/>
<br/>
If Heather has any other success, can you let me know?  I&#39;m open to anything<br/>
to wean him with as little trauma as possible.  He&#39;s very attached, which is<br/>
terrific, but I&#39;m exhausted.<br/>
