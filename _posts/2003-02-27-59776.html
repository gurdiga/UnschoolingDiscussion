<div id="ygrps-yiv-683416973">Hi! I am diana jenner, 34 year old super mom to Hannah, 6.5, and Hayden, 4.5. <br/>
 We live in Western South Dakota and have been unschooling since Hannah was <br/>
born :)  My husband, Mitch, died two years ago from a brain tumor & I&#39;m <br/>
fortunate to be at home, raising and teaching our babies.  The last year of <br/>
his life, Mitch was in charge of the *schooling* while at home undergoing <br/>
chemotherapy, it was the coolest year of my children&#39;s lives ~ even if he had <br/>
to *do* worksheets to feel like he was doing something ~ the Truth of the <br/>
matter is, they learned more just by being around him and his doctors <br/>
appointments than the could ever learn from a workbook page!!  We still have <br/>
all the workbooks laying around, but now they&#39;re used as a memorial to Mitch <br/>
;) definitely not my style.  <br/>
I&#39;d like to think we live in the coolest place on earth for unschooling and <br/>
inspiring all of us ~ the Black Hills.  This place is considered by many to <br/>
be the spiritual center of the universe... I certainly feel calmer and more <br/>
centered since moving here 7 months ago!  We are already planning our <br/>
expeditions for summer ~ lots of camping and hiking.  Hayden&#39;s excited to see <br/>
his very first snake!  We&#39;ve been doing lots of reading about the area and <br/>
what to expect while we&#39;re out ~ I&#39;ve learned more in the past 7 months than <br/>
I did living in this state (and attending public school) for 18 years!! (I <br/>
spent almost 8 years in CA and have been back to SD for 9 years)<br/>
We do lots of TV, too :) since this was brought up!  It&#39;s on all day, watched <br/>
minimally.  I&#39;d personally rather discuss things with my kids than shelter <br/>
them and create *forbidden fruit* where it doesn&#39;t need to be.  For example, <br/>
I was told the first Lord of the Rings was incredibly violent and we missed <br/>
our chance to see it on the big screen ~ I watched the video and kicked <br/>
myself!!  It is now one of our family&#39;s favorite DVDs and we went to Two <br/>
Towers on opening day!  I think it has a lot to do with my kids&#39; relationship <br/>
to daddy and the honesty required by us to deal with the children ~ they have <br/>
an incredible grasp on reality vs fantasy.  We saw the *Making of StarWars* ~ <br/>
Hayden was beside himself with excitement when he saw that George Lucas was <br/>
just a regular guy with an incredible imagination.  He&#39;s gone on to request <br/>
stories on Steven Speilberg and JRR Toliken.  <br/>
Right now, we are planning our family trip to Southern California in two <br/>
weeks.  We will be driving out ~ both a challenge and an adventure!  My <br/>
mother-in-law is really looking forward to our arrival, we&#39;re really looking <br/>
forward to Disneyland, hee hee.  It will be a bit of a whirlwind trip, <br/>
planning to drive the 20+ hours straight thru, but the anticipation of what <br/>
we&#39;ll see on our way, is making the plan much smoother. <br/>
My thoughts may be a bit scattered, I do tend to ramble and suffer the <br/>
consequences of my thoughts getting away from me!  I&#39;m glad to be part of a <br/>
group, after reading just one day&#39;s posts, I&#39;m feeling right at home :) <br/>

Welcome and I am so sorry for your loss.  I can&#39;t imagine raising my boys <br/>
without my DH. <br/>
 And I agree about the Black Hills.  <br/>
We live in North Carolina but my DH is from SD.  We have been to the Black <br/>
Hills and the Bad Lands several times and plan to go again with the boys in a <br/>
year or two.<br/>
<br/>
Your children are lucky to have a strong, cool Mom like you in their lives.  <br/>
I look forward to hearing about your adventure.<br/>

I know your trip will be whirlwind, but if you feel like visiting our <br/>
park day, we&#39;re right there - I live about 10 minutes from Disneyland. <br/>
We have lots of young kids, your kids&#39; ages, and it might be a nice <br/>
break for you. Let me know if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll give you times <br/>
and directions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290365388">Welcome Diana. Sorry for you loss. Sounds as if your husband left all of you <br/>
with wonderful memories and great kids that will always have him with you. <br/>
You sound like an awesome mom, seeing so much fun and opportunity in every <br/>
day. Your area sounds great and that&#39;s one place my husband and I speak <br/>
about going some day. Right now though we can&#39;t even get to Orlando!!!! <br/>
We&#39;ll all be looking forward to your upcoming adventures.<br/>
