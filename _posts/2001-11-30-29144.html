<div id="ygrps-yiv-440728747">Old math:   Bob has 2 Apple, Jane has 2 Apples.  How many Apples are <br/>
there total?<br/>
<br/>
New Math:  Bob went to the market and purchased 2 Apples for 50 cents.  <br/>
Jane went to the market and purchased 2 Apples for 78 cents.  How many <br/>
Apples did both Bob and Jane purchase at the market today?<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s Math:  Bob left San Jose on Saturday at 3:15 PM to ride a train <br/>
at 50 Mph heading west along the equator towards El Salvador.  After <br/>
visiting the currency exchange office on Mejuan Street across from the <br/>
St. Maria bakery owned by Enrico Sanchez, he left at 4:46 PM via <br/>
Handora&#39;s Taxi service heading south at 27 Mph to make it to the annual <br/>
weekend farmer&#39;s market.  After walking approximately 1 hour and 15 <br/>
minutes at 2 Mph through the farmer&#39;s market, his Russian copy of a Timex <br/>
digital watch beeped repeatedly when 6:01 PM had passed.  Bob approached <br/>
an open vendor and asked to purchase native 2 red apples, not imports, <br/>
with his recently exchanged currency.  Handing the farmer, Mr. Sojos, 37 <br/>
pesos in 4 bills and 3 coins, he received 2 native red apples that are <br/>
approximately 3 hours 27 minutes old from the time they were picked.<br/>
<br/>
Jane left New York on Monday at 1:52 PM on an American Airlines jet <br/>
airplane traveling at an altitude of 12,372 feet, a speed of 572 Mph, <br/>
with a headwind of 38 Mph east along the equator towards South Africa.  <br/>
After a grueling trip of 13 hours 7 minutes, she arrived at the Airport <br/>
of South Africa in terminal A-22.  At a speed of approximately 3 Mph, she <br/>
hurried to her expected limousine service owned and operated by Martin <br/>
Kalafent-Mefe, and arrived at 4:29 PM the next day.  After checking her <br/>
Rollex time piece she acquired as a gift from her great grandmother in <br/>
1947 right after the war, it read 4:37 PM with a  crescent moon dial <br/>
indicating the moon phase for the day.  After getting into her limousine <br/>
at 4:42 PM, she ordered to be driven to the local market in South <br/>
Kabul-Afe.  At an average speed of 37 Mph, it took her 28 minutes 52 <br/>
seconds to reach her destination.  Seeing that she already made a <br/>
currency exchange for $2.73, she exited the vehicle 5:14 PM and <br/>
approached a local apple vendor.  Jane asked to purchase 2 Washington <br/>
import apples at exactly 5:17 PM.  Mr. Obetafe, the owner of the apples, <br/>
sold her 2 Washington import apples for $2.52.  Jane received 21 cents in <br/>
the form of 2 dimes and 1 penny as her change, and placed it in her left <br/>
pocket approximately 36 inches from the ground.<br/>
<br/>
What was the inflation percentage on New Hampshire colonial currency <br/>
after the French & Indian war disrupted tobacco exports to London in the <br/>
18th century?<br/>
