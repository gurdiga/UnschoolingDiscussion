<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of eating disorders seem to trace back to too much parental control, <br/>
disapproval, criticism, pressure.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of my main reasons for NOT doing the traditional food controls.<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t required to taste anything they don&#39;t want to taste.  <br/>
They never have to clean their plates.<br/>
They can eat between meals.<br/>
They can always have something else and are never told &quot;If you don&#39;t like <br/>
this, you can go to bed hungry.&quot;<br/>
They have never been dessert-trained (eat this and you can have cake); never.<br/>
(My mother-in-law was surprised when she tried it and they ate a fair amount <br/>
of the regular food and then didn&#39;t want the dessert.  And another time, at <br/>
her house, she told Marty, who was three or four, that since he hadn&#39;t <br/>
finished his plate, he couldn&#39;t have the dessert, which was a tiny portion of <br/>
carrot pudding, and I said &quot;Marty, you can have mine,&quot; and pushed it right <br/>
over to him and he ate it.  I never even bothered to look at the mother in <br/>
law who criticizes us for buying whole milk instead of skim, for using butter <br/>
instead of margarine, and for not depriving our kids to teach them to endure <br/>
hardship.)<br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law&#39;s way did not work.  It didn&#39;t earn her her desired results, <br/>
and her sons have bad memories of food issues in that house.  They learned to <br/>
get jobs and eat elsewhere, and be dishonest about that fact, because she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t feed them between meals, she controlled portions, and shamed people <br/>
constantly.<br/>
<br/>
I read, years ago in Mothering Magazine, an article about a family that <br/>
allowed choices of foods.  It was a more limited situation than mine, but the <br/>
author&#39;s point was that children will come to their own balance.  That has <br/>
been true with my kids, and other families I&#39;ve talked to who have done the <br/>
same things.<br/>

soda pop. For a long time I thought it was an addiction. I go long periods <br/>
without it, but then start drinking it again, day and night. Yes caffeine is <br/>
addictive, but I never drink coffee or tea, and never just horde chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
Soda pop was &#39;for grown ups&#39; when I was a kid. It was rationed out, we had to <br/>
ask for it and were often refused, we had to prepare it for our parents.  Or <br/>
we&#39;d get it as a treat if we were ill (go figure) or had gotten hurt. My <br/>
sister also clings near to her pepsi at all times.<br/>
<br/>
Immature yes, but I still feel like I&#39;m exercising my freedom and autonomy <br/>
when I buy and drink pop.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can sure agree with this.  My older son was a sickly toddler, and even <br/>
though I had vowed never to control my kids&#39; eating, I sincerely believed <br/>
that he would be healthier if he ate better.  So I pushed and prodded and <br/>
even forced at one point.  (He didn&#39;t eat for 3 days once, rather than eat <br/>
something with vegetables.)  I finally wised up and left him to it.  Of all <br/>
the kids, Noah is the adult with the absolute worst eating habits.  I&#39;ve <br/>
learned my lesson well.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I&#39;d probably do things differently if there were serious <br/>
allergies in any of my kids.<br/>

animal has to be deprived of food enough to want it badly.<br/>

&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true in our house as well.  Though we have sweets and snacks<br/>
here, my son is more likely to eat fruit.   There have been days when he<br/>
snarfed a lot of  &quot;junk&quot; foods,  and more days when he turns it down.   <br/>
<br/>
Experts have been telling moms for years that kids &quot;need&quot; limits.  They<br/>
are can only feel truly safe and loved when they have limits.  That can<br/>
be hard to get past.<br/>
<br/>
I believe moms can know their kids very well.  I also have seen plenty of<br/>
moms who just think they do.  Maybe a kid gets grumpy if he watches TV<br/>
all day.  But maybe he&#39;s grumpy because he didn&#39;t get anything to eat. <br/>
Maybe he didn&#39;t feel good in the first place and that&#39;s why he chose to<br/>
sit and watch TV.  Maybe he chose TV because he couldn&#39;t think of<br/>
something else and he&#39;s grumpy because he&#39;s frustrated.  Maybe he&#39;s<br/>
grumpy because mom keeps saying &quot;are you just going to sit there all<br/>
day??&quot;    I think it&#39;s easy to assume it&#39;s the TV because after all, we<br/>
all  *know*  TV is bad for kids!( they need limits!)    On an unschooling<br/>
list, I don&#39;t see the harm in asking, - are you sure it was the TV--<br/>
maybe you didn&#39;t think of this other reason.   <br/>
<br/>
I also know,  when our decisions are questioned all the time, it&#39;s easy<br/>
to become defensive.  Many of us have friends, family members and even<br/>
partners who don&#39;t support our choice to unschool.  One more person<br/>
asking a question can feel like an attack,  when it was really just meant<br/>
to be a question,  something to consider.  <br/>
<br/>
No matter what anyone on this list, or anywhere else,  says or thinks or<br/>
implies,  we all still have the ability to make our own decisions.  <br/>
<br/>
Controlling kids is a huge issue.  Some people use their religion as an<br/>
excuse,  some people just like the power, some people just never think<br/>
about it.  Telling someone else what to do, what to think, what to eat,<br/>
what to wear, how to behave--these are control issues.  Questioning them<br/>
seems appropriate on an unschooling list.  <br/>
<br/>
I know this one true thing.  My own son is delighted to be alive.  He&#39;s<br/>
happy to be a kid. He has no issues, no problems.   He is free to make<br/>
his own choices.  <br/>
When someone says their child is unhappy or unhealthy,  I know there<br/>
could be a million reasons for it, but I&#39;ve seen so many examples of the<br/>
reason being control of the child&#39;s life by the parent.  <br/>

&gt; Deb L<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think there is a big different between unhappy and unhealthy.  I am <br/>
currently unhealthy but not unhappy.  My kids have lots of problems <br/>
from allergies to depression but they are happy.  Even when she is <br/>
having trouble with her depression meds, Rachel is not unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
I also think some of the problems here have been caused by people <br/>
assuming that unhealthy meant unhappy and answering questions and <br/>
responding to posts as if the two go hand in hand and can never <br/>
appear alone.<br/>
<br/>
I have met lots of kids who are being warped by a control freak <br/>
parent.  I&#39;ve met kids warped by neglect.  I would, however, never <br/>
dream of telling someone on this list that they are a bad parent.  <br/>
And I don&#39;t think anyone else should either, but they do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
As the daughter of an extremely controlling mother I can say that many<br/>
years of constipation can be a result for the child.  This is my<br/>
personal experience.  As an adult, my bowel movements are just fine<br/>
(LOL).  I have kept my distance from my mother for many years.  I find I<br/>
do much better emotionally and physically (in that order!).<br/>
<br/>
Please note:  In no way would I ever suggest that constipation is only<br/>
caused by parental control issues.  I&#39;m sure there are many different<br/>
medical reasons that would cause constipation.  One reason, I have<br/>
personal experience with.  One of my sons is a Juvenile Diabetic.<br/>
Constipation is a sign of dehydration which is a sympton of Juvenile<br/>
Diabetes.  Once the diagnosis was made, on his first birthday, and he<br/>
started his insulin injections, his constipation went away.  So, my<br/>
advice to any parent whose child suffers from constipation is to have<br/>
that child&#39;s blood sugar tested immediately.  Juvenile Diabetes is a<br/>
serious hereditary disease which should not be ignored.<br/>
