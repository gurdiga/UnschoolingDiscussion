In a nutshell, I don&#39;t :( . For several years, I remained distant <br/>
even though we&#39;re in the same town. Then, she had to undergo major <br/>
heart surgery and being the only sibling left in town, I jumped to <br/>
her &#39;rescue&#39;. She was much nicer and basically still is but I still <br/>
maintain a safe distance. <br/>
I was walking in the grocery store this afternoon and noticed a <br/>
mother/daughter couple nearby. They were chatting and smiling and <br/>
clearly enjoying each others&#39; company.  I was green with envy but I <br/>
also wanted to go up to them and tell them how lucky they are!  It&#39;s <br/>
just not meant to be for me (and you? :( ) but one thing is sure... <br/>
I&#39;m going to do all I can to not repeat the same mistakes with my own <br/>
girls.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981832978">Hi Sarah and Nicki,<br/>
<br/>
Just want to let you know I also have a very strained relationship with <br/>
my mother.  She only lives 15 minutes away, but I probably see her less <br/>
than 10 times per year.  My husband tried to bring us closer together <br/>
for years, but finally gave up.  Her abrasiveness and rudeness finally <br/>
got to him and now he refuses to invite her over for dinner anymore.  <br/>
She is very unpredictable and you never know what to expect when you see <br/>
her.  Sometimes she&#39;s sweet and pleasant and other times she&#39;s very rude <br/>
and insulting.<br/>
<br/>
My boys used to spend a couple of days a month with her when they were <br/>
younger.  They&#39;ll be 8 soon.  They now make it clear they don&#39;t want to <br/>
spend so much time with her anymore.  About 2 years ago she threw a <br/>
glass of water in Leroy&#39;s face because he was crying.  I had never seen <br/>
him so upset before, and it brought back memories of how angry, unhappy <br/>
and upset I used to be when I was her child.  I decided then that my <br/>
boys didn&#39;t need to be around her and we rarely see her now.<br/>
<br/>
I know I am a better mother than she was and I do everything I can to <br/>
make sure my relationships with my boys will remain loving ones forever.<br/>
<br/>
I feel sorry for her because she&#39;s all alone and I&#39;m the only child in <br/>
town.  My brother is in NYC and my sister is in Ohio.  Everyone, <br/>
including my 2 uncles (her brothers) are angry at me because I don&#39;t <br/>
spend more time with her.  But, I have decided, that my boys are more <br/>
important to me than she is.  She had her chance with me years ago.  I&#39;m <br/>
much too busy with my boys to worry about her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991811720">Thanks for your response, Mimi. I&#39;ve always felt guilty for thinking <br/>
I&#39;m a better mother than my own mother and in fact, when I first read <br/>
your statement to that effect the other day, it bugged me that you <br/>
said that. But then, when I re-read it again in this post (below) I <br/>
thought, ya know... she&#39;s exactly right!  I&#39;ve been trying to believe <br/>
that she (MY mom) did the best she could for us under her <br/>
circumstances. But ya know what? She *didn&#39;t* do the best she <br/>
could.... she took a part time job to get *away* from all of us <br/>
(there were five) because she never got any help from my dDad. We <br/>
were left to raise ourselves. Your mom threw water on your son. My <br/>
mom poured a glass of milk over my brother&#39;s head while he was <br/>
strapped in his high chair (this was ages ago... WHY do I so vividly <br/>
remember it!).<br/>
(pause)<br/>
<br/>
Damn... and although I haven&#39;t poured milk on anybody or thrown water <br/>
in the girls&#39; faces, I have done my fair share of poor-parenting. I&#39;m <br/>
outta here for tonight... gotta go mend some fences and work on my <br/>
parenting skills.<br/>
(*still* searching for the parenting manual that was supposed to be <br/>
given out at childbirth)<br/>
