<div id="ygrps-yiv-321496372">It wuldn&#39;t have come from the list<br/>
and you would have only &quot;caught it&quot; if you opened the file the haha sends<br/>
to you<br/>
<br/>
What happens is you send an email to someone with the virus<br/>
their email then sends you a copy of the virus hoping you will<br/>
catch it and keep it going<br/>
<br/>
I receive about 20 copies of it a week thanks to my autoresponder<br/>
sending a message to all who order our free cd ... so there are many on<br/>
these lists who<br/>
have it ... everyone just needs to go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.antivirus.com">http://www.antivirus.com</a> and do a<br/>
live scan with<br/>
their housecalls program ... see if they have it<br/>
<br/>
I do not open the file attachment, so cannot get it<br/>
(I also have anti virus software runnin but I still don&#39;t open files)<br/>
<br/>
It comes from a personal party not a list<br/>
<br/>
and is a well known wide spread virus<br/>
Just cuz you got the email dont think you automatically have it<br/>
<br/>
RULE OF THUMB never open attachments unless you KNOW they are coming.<br/>
especially if they end with vbs scr or pif<br/>
(they may say .jpg but will also end with something else after that<br/>
part)...<br/>

I&#39;m having No. 3 son&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s father come over in the morning to<br/>
&quot;dissect&quot; a virus I received about 10 o&#39;clock.  It is the Snow White/HaHaHa<br/>
thingy and from what I can tell, it came from this list.  Everyone might<br/>
want to check.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585653921">No, I don&#39;t have the virus.  I haven&#39;t the faintest about how those things<br/>
work.  It was &quot;caught&quot; before it infected my computer.  My computer expert<br/>
(I am definately not one of those) said that it came from someone on this<br/>
list just before he ran out the door.  Said he would give me the rest of the<br/>
info sometime today.<br/>
<br/>
He said it might be mascarading as Snow White as it didn&#39;t &quot;act like&quot; the<br/>
original.  He said it came as a regular post and then when it was deleted it<br/>
appeared in the deleted folder as the Snow White/HaHaHa with an attachment.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t the foggiest how these things work.  He does and keeps this thing<br/>
working.<br/>
