We vacation a few times a year in NC (parents&#39; beach house). Are you close <br/>
enough to attend the Homeschool conference in SC? Lots of unschoolers will be <br/>
there (with their skin on, presumably).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707861237">Rebecca,  I&#39;m in Kentucky.<br/>
Perhaps that conference in October would be a good idea.......though I&#39;m<br/>
sure I&#39;d have a letdown after when I have to get back to &#39;the real world&#39;!<br/>
Oh well,  I&#39;m sure it would strengthen me...<br/>
    What&#39;s hard sometimes is that I want to shout out how great unschooling<br/>
is and can&#39;t you see that these &#39;teaching methods&#39; usually have nothing to<br/>
do with how people learn and why is algebra so important if you don&#39;t<br/>
understand it yourself and have practical anxiety attacks over how you&#39;ll<br/>
feed it into your children&#39;s brains and........etc.<br/>
    I went to some local HS meeting the other night with a speaker on<br/>
&#39;classical education&#39;.  He believes children are like computers and the<br/>
educator&#39;s job is to &quot;load the data&quot;  up until they are twelve ( I suppose<br/>
then the litlle ones are allowed to think?).  The audience seemed entranced<br/>
by his tales of success and excellence (&quot;We get &#39;em reading by christmas of<br/>
the first grade year.&quot;;  &quot;We read and discuss the Illiad in fifth grade.&quot; ;<br/>
&quot;they learn Latin and Greek.&quot;)<br/>
he disagreed with the folks at Harvard who told him they want to have<br/>
student who can think,  and they want to have them grow in their ability to<br/>
think and problem-solve......and that rote teaching of facts is not useful<br/>
because&quot;facts&quot; change.    I had a strong urge to be  a little upstart and<br/>
ask questions like....on what do you base this idea tha children need to be<br/>
fed information?  At what age do children switch from amazing explorers and<br/>
learners to empty head that need to be filled?  What do you mean thay can&#39;t<br/>
learn what you don&#39;t know - if Einstein&#39;s (substitute almost any name here)<br/>
parents knew all the things he did,  they would have developed the theory of<br/>
relativity?<br/>
<br/>
    Well, looks like I needed to vent a bit!<br/>
hee hee<br/>
Gotta go,  Susan<br/>
