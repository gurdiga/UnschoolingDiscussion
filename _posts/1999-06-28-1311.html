<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806251042">Hi all!  I have been lurking on the list for almost two weeks now and figured <br/>
I had best get around to sending in my bio.  I read on the aol message boards <br/>
that some of the &quot;old&quot; regulars were hanging out here and thought I would <br/>
venture on over.  My name is Kathy, I have been married to Mike for 9 yrs <br/>
this August. We have Jessica who will be 6 in August, Zach 4, and Jared 2.  I <br/>
had planned to hs practically from birth.  My friends in LLL were hsing <br/>
(which is how I heard about it).  Reading info on hsing I found out about <br/>
unschooling.  I really couldn&#39;t imagine doing it any other way because of my <br/>
temperament and my childrens -  aahhh we would clash.  I find that whenever I <br/>
get &quot;teachy&quot; and expect my dd to &quot;understand&quot; and when she doesn&#39;t I get all <br/>
bent, I immediately back off.  Have done nothing official, we sing the abc <br/>
song, practice counting (this is all mostly through reading books), go lots <br/>
of interesting places, talk to interesting people, do crafts, play outside.  <br/>
My kids do a lot of stuff by themselves without my interaction or direction.  <br/>
When my dd wants to write a word (makes birthday cards for relatives and <br/>
friends) she asks me how to write it.  She doesn&#39;t recognize all her letters, <br/>
but she recognizes words.  I figure were doing whole word learning?  I told <br/>
her if she needs help when she is ready to learn to read more words that I <br/>
will help her (how I have no idea, but I&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to <br/>
it!)  A hsing child from our support group is teaching the younger children <br/>
french this summer and dd is going to try that!  I am rather excited to go so <br/>
I can learn too!  Well I could go on and on here, just wanted to come out of <br/>
lurkdom and say hi!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766607648">Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Jessica sounds like my Matt, he too learned a whole lot of words by sight<br/>
before he ever knew all the letters or even many letter sounds.  It&#39;s so<br/>
much fun to watch them figure things out.  My current 5 year old though,<br/>
she&#39;s gotten worried about dying and only having one life.  She was<br/>
despondent last night that she would only get to live this life one time.<br/>
She did say she was having fun being herself.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re glad you came out of lurkdom.  :)<br/>

Must be a five yr old thing, my dd is concerned about death also and I <br/>
distinctly remember talking to my dad about dying when I was that age <br/>
too.  My dd is more concerned with when I am going to die than herself<br/>

youngest who is five recently spent an hour crying his heart out about our<br/>
family dying. My older two didn&#39;t do this and my Jaron is the most<br/>
emotional/sensitive kid. It just crushed me hearing him cry, &quot;I don&#39;t want<br/>
you to die, I love you too much!&quot; :( Are your children very sensitive?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes and no... my more emotionally sensitive child didn&#39;t do this at 5, but<br/>
he had only started talking at 4, so at 5 philosophy wasn&#39;t where he was at.<br/>
&lt;G&gt;  Matter of fact my youngest is thicker skinned one of the bunch.  Kaela<br/>
is sensitive, but only in the pick up signals area, she understands<br/>
subtleties.   Now how she reacts to those subtleties varys, sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
like  bull in a china shop. &lt;<br/>
I have one child that is a complete realist.  He crossed his eyes at me when<br/>
I tried to explain Santa Claus at 3, bah humbug to that.  The youngest child<br/>
is definately a philosopher and the one who has strong intrapersonal skills.<br/>
<br/>
I love watching them....well, unless they are yelling at one another, like<br/>
they did most of yesterday. Sometimes I wish I could watch them from afar,<br/>
instead of from the middle. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of my favorite things is being able to observe my kids in action when <br/>
they don&#39;t know I&#39;m there, like when I come to pick them up from playing with <br/>
other kids, or at a distance in a park or something.  To see them move <br/>
without interaction with family is like a glimpse into their future.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also impressed that my kids act better when they&#39;re away from home than <br/>
when they&#39;re here.  I know, and grew up with, and have been related to some <br/>
kids who were well behaved only in the arm&#39;s-length presence of their parents <br/>
and horrible elsewhere.  I&#39;d much rather have the kids good elsewhere and <br/>
confident enough to express their frustration or (sometimes rude) humor with <br/>
me instead of when they&#39;re guests.<br/>

I would take that as a moment to explain that there are millions of people in <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835771159">Oh, I did explain reincarnation.... and other things.  What she was sad over<br/>
was knowing she was only going to get on go around being this person, with<br/>
this family as family.  She was aware that each day that past she had was<br/>
one less she could be herself.  Reincarnation was okay as a concept, but not<br/>
for dealing with the sadness.    At that point there was nothing to do but<br/>
hold her.<br/>
