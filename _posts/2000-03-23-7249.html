&lt;&lt; Whats really cool is that my dd tells <br/>
 people that we don&#39;t need to go to school to learn things, we just learn<br/>
 from going places and doing things.  Good luck!<br/>

I had to laugh as your post brought back a precious memory from my dd.<br/>
She spent hours in our small pond, catching newts, frog eggs, and whatever she<br/>
could find. Our back porch shelf was lined with jars and jars of her <br/>
discoveries.<br/>
Her remark was &quot;I don&#39;t need to go to school, I have a pond!&quot;.<br/>

Now I have a 10 year old who is also a nature girl.<br/>
