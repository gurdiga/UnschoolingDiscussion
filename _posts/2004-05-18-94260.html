<div id="ygrps-yiv-87353848">One thing that has helped me in uncomfortable situations is finding out why<br/>
it bothers me.  I&#39;ve seen that if, in the situation, people were bringing up<br/>
issues that I wasn&#39;t sensitive to, it wouldn&#39;t bother me.  If someone says<br/>
something about me that I know in my core is not true, it doesn&#39;t have any<br/>
resonance.  But if somebody says something that I&#39;ve got unresolved stuff<br/>
about, it effects me intensely.  So since I&#39;m kind of a control freak and I<br/>
realized this was an area I could actually have some control over, I&#39;ve<br/>
dived in.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember being in a class as an adult where everybody had been there for<br/>
about a year before I joined. There was a woman who was the queen bee and<br/>
kept everybody else around her.  There wasn&#39;t much room for me to form<br/>
relationships with others which was what I usually would do in a place like<br/>
that.  She would make plans with everybody in the class but not include me.<br/>
She wouldn&#39;t even look at me when talking to all of us at breaks.  If I said<br/>
something, she would ignore it. I didn&#39;t want to leave the class bc the<br/>
teacher was fantastic.  I tried to get in one of his other classes but they<br/>
were all full so I was stuck.<br/>
<br/>
Then I started thinking about what this all brought up for me.  And it was<br/>
how it was when I was a preteen.  I was lonely and didn&#39;t have good friends<br/>
and felt so awkward and ashamed.  Never mind that in HS I had lots of<br/>
wonderful friends, this is the time that informed lots of who I was.  Or who<br/>
I was afraid I was.  When I really let that sink in and feel all those lousy<br/>
things again with  my older and wiser and more compassionate self as the<br/>
vessel, I was able to be in that situation without that discomfort.  I was<br/>
able to get out of the class what I needed and leave the rest.<br/>
<br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do any of that without meditation helping<br/>
me to disconnect from the world.<br/>

Its interesting you should say this.  I&#39;ve been thinking back to so many instances where I made dumb mistakes, and I am STILL beating myself up for it!!! (and on a regular basis!)<br/>
<br/>
Its only been the last 2 weeks that I finally decided that its really ok; that I was really just young and inexperienced, and there was no way I could be held to the perfectionistic standards that certain people (including me) had.  I&#39;ve only just come to realize that most people *do* make stupid mistakes as they learn, not just when they&#39;re young, but at all ages.<br/>
I just didn&#39;t know.  <br/>
<br/>
For the first time in my life, I&#39;m actually forgiving myself for stupid mistakes I made 20 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I am beginning to think that perfectionists have an intense fear of failure.  In my experience, they often take pride in their perfectionism, and believe it makes them superior, but they don&#39;t realize how destructive it is to dismiss the value of mistakes and the growth that comes with them.  Their perfectionism is all they have to define themselves.<br/>
<br/>
When they hold others to their unrealistic standards, its because they believe that non-perfectionism (Realism) is a character flaw that reflects directly on them.  Its a threat to the quality of their personhood.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I&#39;m trying to set firm boundaries for myself so that I&#39;m done paying interest on mistakes I&#39;ve made in the past and prevent paying for today&#39;s mistakes for the next 20 years.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want anyone to suck me down while I climb out of this hole.<br/>
