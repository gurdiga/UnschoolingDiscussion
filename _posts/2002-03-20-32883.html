&gt; The question is whether a child--any child-- needs school-like or <br/>

&gt; Kathryn,<br/>

&gt; I believe that your belief is based on your experience (as most <br/>
&gt; beliefs are.) I also believe that not everyone experiences the same <br/>
&gt; response to unschooling, therefore your statement cannot apply to <br/>
&gt; everyone. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have had personal experience with a child who does need an <br/>
&gt; external structure.  Unschooling was my desire - I (the parent)did <br/>
&gt; not have the need for structure.  Unschooling was a disaster for my <br/>
&gt; daughter.  It made her edgy and upset.  She hated it.  She created <br/>
&gt; her own school plan and it was very harsh and demanding.  I had to <br/>
&gt; step in before she had a nervous breakdown.  She also hates open <br/>
&gt; ended questions.  She is a perfectionist and she has always been <br/>
&gt; hard on herself.  She has wonderful loving parents who have not done <br/>
&gt; anything to cause her to be this way.  It is just the way she has <br/>
&gt; always been.  She spilled a glass of milk when she was 2 and became <br/>
&gt; quite hysterical.  People watching probably erroneously assumed that <br/>
&gt; her parents had been overly harsh in the past when she spilled <br/>
&gt; things. The truth is that she had never accidently spilled anything <br/>
&gt; before.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She is now 14 and studying Classical Literature.  She is reading and <br/>
&gt; enjoying things that would put me to sleep.  She did fine from <br/>
&gt; September until January.  When she started showing signs of stress, <br/>
&gt; I stepped in and asked her to take some time off.  She refused <br/>
&gt; saying that she needed to finish what she had scheduled.  I found <br/>
&gt; some light, fun reading choices and put those on her schedule <br/>
&gt; instead.  She thanked me and hugged me with tears in her eyes.  I <br/>
&gt; have spent most of her homeschooling years running similar <br/>
&gt; interferences.  I also spend a great deal of time telling her how <br/>
&gt; wonderful she is as a human being and that studying hard does not <br/>
&gt; make me love her more.  I know that some will read what I have <br/>
&gt; written and choose not to believe me.  I can&#39;t help that; all I can <br/>
&gt; say is &quot;you have not walked in my shoes.&quot;  Please do not judge what <br/>
&gt; you have not experienced. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Alaura, from my perspective, you illustrated my point. I said &quot;externally <br/>
demanded structure&quot;  -- a parent or teacher requiring specific learning at a <br/>
specific time. You did not give her the highly structured stuff when she was <br/>
a little kid, OR, I assume, require the Classical Literature. SHE did. She <br/>
wanted structure, and she found it. As an aware parent, when you saw her <br/>
driving herself nuts, you gently helped her find ways to continue doing what <br/>
SHE wanted, in a form that was likely to help her feel better. (I am assuming <br/>
that you didn&#39;t tell her she HAD to do that.) <br/>
<br/>
My twelve year old son is teaching himself High School Chemistry with CD-ROMS <br/>
he asked me to buy him. He loves it, because he&#39;s fascinated. This is very <br/>
structured learning, which he has NOT been into until now. Is he unschooling? <br/>
Yup--I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass whether he masters chemistry at 12 (or ever, <br/>
really). <br/>
<br/>
On the other extreme, I give you -- Me. I am a Director of Religious <br/>
Education at a Unitarian Universalist church, and keep toying with becoming a <br/>
minister. So far, I have decided not to, because it would require my going to <br/>
Grad School for a Masters of Divinity. Going to a Hippy College and <br/>
unschooling have made me resent the idea of traditional grad school type <br/>
learning, so for now it doesn&#39;t seem worth it. If  could learn what I need <br/>
and want to learn in an unstructured way, I&#39;d do it. I don&#39;t want to sit and <br/>
listen to lectures and write meaningless, intellectual papers at this point, <br/>
though.<br/>

I can really relate to that.  I wanted to be a teacher, but I was <br/>
steered towards medicine by well meaning counselors.  I finally <br/>
decided that becoming a doctor could never mesh with my idea of a <br/>
family.  I dropped out and then almost finished a business degree.  <br/>
I got a job in accounting which I hated.  I still always planned on <br/>
returning to school and getting my teaching degree.  Now..... I am <br/>
way too independent to submit myself to education classes and I <br/>
don&#39;t believe in it anymore either.  LOL<br/>
I guess I need to rethink what I want to do when I grow up. :)<br/>

:) I can relate. I have a degree in Finance from WAY long ago, then when I <br/>
had Lelia (who is now 13) I went back to school and got a masters in <br/>
education while at the same time deciding to unschool. Suffice to say, I <br/>
never taught. Instead at that time, I started a landscape business and kept <br/>
Leila with me all the time. Thanks goodness for those neighbors I had who I <br/>
thought were TOTALLY nutzo who introduced me to the concept of homeschooling. <br/>
I love how the Universe puts us in the right place at the right time!<br/>
