&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1529<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do you ship by mail? What if the buyer is not satisfied? Do you accept<br/>
&gt; returns etc? I would really like to get into this. I love books and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been looking for a way to make some money but stay home with my kids. What<br/>
&gt; kind of places do you go to find books? Do you have your own web site? Do<br/>
&gt; you sell from your house at all, like a store front? How do you know what a<br/>
&gt; book is worth? Is there a good book about this that I should have to help<br/>
&gt; with pricing. Thanks for your help!!!  You may have saved me from having to<br/>
&gt; give up on unschooling for a while!!!! You can e-mail me privately if you<br/>
&gt; want. I don&#39;t want you to waste time on me but if there&#39;s a bit of advice<br/>
&gt; that you could share that is a must know etc...I would appreciate it sooooo<br/>
 </span></blockquote>much!!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind answering on the list, though if others get bored with the<br/>
not-unschooling of it I&#39;ll take it private.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we ship by USPS mail. If the buyer doesn&#39;t like the book, we refund<br/>
with no questions asked (we get less than one return per 800 or more sold).<br/>
<br/>
Finding books is not a problem: thrift stores, flea markets, garage sales,<br/>
used book stores, library book sales, rummage sales, church bazaars,<br/>
advertisements that you buy books in the local papers, etc., all will get<br/>
you more books than you know what to do with.<br/>
<br/>
We have a website, though it&#39;s just a gateway right now to our inventory on<br/>
other sites. My husband is the web page designer and it&#39;s &quot;in progress&quot;. We<br/>
don&#39;t sell books on a walk-in basis, only by mail.<br/>
<br/>
I know what books are worth by research -- other booksellers asking prices,<br/>
recent auction results, a multitude of books on the trade, gut feeling, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy. I have had dozens of people ask me &quot;how do I get started?&quot;<br/>
and I tell them and they try and give up in very short order. You have to be<br/>
prepared to put in the time to learn, and then put in the sweat (books are<br/>
heavy!).<br/>
<br/>
I learned what to buy by trial and a lot of error. My instincts and memory<br/>
are both good, and keep us fed. Dog training was easier, but I like being<br/>
able to work midnight to 2 a.m. (my peak hours &lt;g&gt;) and dealing with the<br/>
difficult people by e-mail is easier than dealing with difficult people in<br/>
person or even on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
I started by reading and cataloging and graphing (did anyone doubt it? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
closed eBay auctions in my specialty categories of choice. That sort of<br/>
activity helps me memorize, and I put in more than 200 hours just reading<br/>
and graphing and indexing on line before I bought a single book for resale.<br/>
<br/>
I spend one or two days a week buying, and the rest of the week on data<br/>
entry, shipping, cleaning, shelving, sorting, stacking, researching and<br/>
lugging.<br/>
<br/>
My children, when spying a new book, pick it up with great tenderness and<br/>
ask, &quot;Is this to sell, or do we get to keep it?&quot; The bonus for them is, they<br/>
own a lot of books since I&#39;m always buying for them, and my husband, and<br/>
myself, and our friends and family, as well as for the customers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021552749">Hi Pam,<br/>
I was at the library looking for books on the trade and I couldn&#39;t find anything. There were a few about particular books like comics etc.. Could you recomend something to get me started. Really I don&#39;t suppose antique books are going to comprise to much of my inventory anyway. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to check/find out about items sold/closed auctions on e-bay but I haven&#39;t been able to figure out where that info is and how to access it. Can you help me. There&#39;s an e-bay university coming to my area, do you recommend this program, did you take it? What&#39;s your specialty. I&#39;m into childrens lit, fiction and biographys I think. <br/>
Anything you can help with here? Your sure right that selling is not as easy a process as buying! I feel a little overwhelmed and anxious but I want to persist.<br/>
Thanks, Leslie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385884178">Hi Pam, <br/>
I&#39;ve figured out how to check the closed auctions now!!! But I still haven&#39;t found out how much e-bay charges for listing an item. Is it a flat fee and then if it sells they take a percentage? Where can I find this info? I&#39;m in Canada, do you know of any other venues for selling that I can access from here?<br/>
Thanks again for helping a stranger!!!<br/>

I&#39;ve got this page and I understand? most of the procedure but I can&#39;t find how much the seller is charged to use the service. Is it a flat fee? Are you only charged if the item sells? <br/>
Thanks, Leslie<br/>
