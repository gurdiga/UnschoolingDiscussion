&lt;&lt; We just moved to a farm from the city so we<br/>
 are very excited to experience everything in nature.  The wild turkey<br/>
 were in the compost yesterday and the dear have made great trails<br/>
 through the woods. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I am sooooo jealous!  That sounds do great to me.  Years ago, in my first <br/>
marriage, an aunt and uncle had a farm outside of Knoxville Tenn.  They had <br/>
acres and acres, a horse and a property that had a stream running thru it, <br/>
and as you crossed that stream, you gradually went up hill to a great wooded <br/>
area where you and the horse could rest.  I used to go out there and just <br/>
ride all day.  I wish my boys could have that experience.  Your family is <br/>
really going to have such fun, especially will all that wild life about.<br/>
