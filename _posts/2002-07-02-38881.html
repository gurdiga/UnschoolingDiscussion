<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534999598">&lt;&lt;The UU Church is not considered Christian by other Christians. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just looking into the UU church but the information the church sent to<br/>
me is that their roots are from pre-Constantinian Christianity.  When<br/>
Constantine declared Christianity the official religion they needed to<br/>
define it.  So the Nicene creed appeared and at this time the Trinity was<br/>
&quot;established&quot;, for lack of a better word.  Someone else may know better than<br/>
I, but this is the information I got.<br/>

<br/>
Though the words unitarian and universalist have very old histories,<br/>
apparently the churches that formed UU &quot;only&quot; go back to 1638 and 1785<br/>
respectively.<br/>
<br/>
The Unitarians (in America) were in response to the Trinitarians. As I heard<br/>
it, the churches in each New England town were the &quot;town church&quot; so to<br/>
speak. It was just where everyone went. At some point an intellectual debate<br/>
on theology broke out over the trinity or unity of God. There were more<br/>
wealthy, educated -- and, therefore, lawyerly -- types supporting the unity<br/>
theory so the Unitarians ended up &quot;winning&quot; the debate and kept the<br/>
churches. The Trinitarians had to move out and build their own churches.<br/>
(Which is why the UUs, though congregations are small, often have the<br/>
biggest oldest church in the center of New England towns.) (The Trinitarians<br/>
eventually became the United Church of Christ.)<br/>
<br/>
The Universalists (in America) were in response to the Calvinist teachings<br/>
that who was going to heaven was preordained. They emphasized universal<br/>
salvation. (Though it says Unitarian at the website.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how the Unitarian church ties into the Unitarian founded in<br/>
Transylvania but some how they did get together.<br/>
<br/>
It says they were both Christian until the 19th century when beliefs<br/>
gradually evolved into the &quot;multi-faith&quot; of today. And in 1961 the two<br/>
churches merged to form Unitarian Universalist Association.<br/>
<br/>
Though there are individual Unitarian and Universalist churches that<br/>
remained separate from the UUA. And each UU church has a different flavor.<br/>
In some churches &quot;God&quot; (the meaning of which is left up to individual<br/>
interpretation and may be nondietyish like &quot;interconnectedness of all<br/>
things&quot; or nothing at all.) And in some churches God doesn&#39;t get mentioned.<br/>
And some churches will have a particular religious bent like Christian or<br/>
Pagan or whatever though the majority of UU churches tend to be multi-faith.<br/>
<br/>
A good summary of the beliefs held is:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As a result, UUs hold diverse beliefs about deity. Within a single<br/>
&gt; congregation, there will be some individuals who are unsure of the existence<br/>
&gt; of god(s) and goddess(es). Others believe in no deity, a single deity or many<br/>
&gt; deities. They hold various views on life after death, including complete<br/>
&gt; annihilation of the person, some form of afterlife removed from earth, or<br/>
&gt; reincarnation. They are free to have beliefs that parallel those of<br/>
&gt; conservative Christians; but few do so. Approximately 10% of UUs consider<br/>
&gt; themselves to be Christians. These people typically share many beliefs about<br/>
&gt; Jesus with members of liberal Christian denominations<br/>
<br/>

really good set of questions and answers at:<br/>
