Legal and Legislative News<br/>
<br/>
New York: Codifying Regs into Law, bill introduced 2/19/03<br/>
Mike Ebbers summarizes at the NHEN Forum:<br/>
&quot;NY is beginning another round of controversy with the introduction <br/>
of S2060 (last year known as S4767). It proposes to codify Dept of Ed <br/>
regs into law.&quot;<br/>

WV Homeschoolers get a well deserved break!<br/>
Posted by Betsy at the NHEN Forum:<br/>
&quot;In the early morning hours of Sunday, March 9, the WV legislature <br/>
approved a bill that eliminates the 4-yr rule (a parent qualification <br/>
requirement) and removes the requirement that students who do not <br/>
meet the designated annual assessment standards be sent to public <br/>
school.&quot;<br/>
Way to go, West Virginia!<br/>

<br/>
Naturally, not everyone in West Virginia is thrilled. From the NEA <br/>
affiliate WVEA:<br/>
  &quot;SB 206 - Home School Bill - Perhaps the worst education policy <br/>
passed by the legislature was the home school bill, SB 206.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Big surprise, huh?<br/>

Interscholastic Sports Hopes Dashed<br/>
Washington Post, Washington, DC   Thursday, March 13, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Erika Tucker&#39;s dilemma is that she, a homeschooled Maryland <br/>
basketball player, has no access to the training and coaching <br/>
provided by public schools to other young athletes.  Maryland law <br/>
prohibits homeschooled students from participating in extracurricular <br/>
activities at public high schools.<br/>
A bill assigned to the Ways and Means Committee in the House of <br/>
Delegates would change that.<br/>
The bill, if passed, allows homeschooled students to try out or join <br/>
sports teams, drama programs and other student organizations at <br/>
public high schools as long as public school students are not <br/>
prevented from participation by their involvement. On Friday, the <br/>
bill was defeated in committee.<br/>
<br/>

The Specter of Educational Neglect<br/>
<br/>
You may have read about the Vermont homeschooling mother, Patricia <br/>
O&#39;Dell, who was jailed for contempt of court last fall and her four <br/>
children were placed in foster care.  The charge?  Educational <br/>
neglect.  The story continues to develop.<br/>
<br/>
ABC22, WVNY Burlington and Plattsburgh   March 12, 2003<br/>
&quot;Fighting the System: Update&quot;<br/>
The ABC story begins:  &quot;The pain and separation that one Vermont <br/>
family is experiencing is unbelievable. First her children were taken <br/>
away by the state, then she was locked up in jail. Now it&#39;s six <br/>
months later, and as ABC22&#39;s Ruth Dwyer reports there&#39;s still no <br/>
resolution to this family&#39;s ordeal.  [..] Six months ago Patricia <br/>
O&#39;Dell was in jail...and her four children are still in state <br/>
custody...because of educational neglect charges.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Whatever its merits, the case stirs controversy in homeschooling <br/>
discussions. Among the topics being mentioned: the broader <br/>
implications of NOT defending homeschooling parents who are charged <br/>
with educational neglect, even when there are other issues of <br/>
concern; the potential risks of NOT supporting homeschooling families <br/>
who are poor or who live alternative type lifestyles; and perhaps the <br/>
broadest topic, what is meant by educational neglect and how that <br/>
term can affect homeschoolers.<br/>

The Good News/Bad News Department<br/>
<br/>
The headline: Senate education leader rapped for letter urging <br/>
parents to flee schools<br/>
The Oregonian, Salem, Oregon  -  March 5, 2003<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/education/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/front_page/104686912642610.xml">http://www.oregonlive.com/education/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/front_page/104686912642610.xml</a><br/>
<br/>
The Good News:  &quot;I tell any parent who will listen to run -- not walk <br/>
-- to remove their children from public schools.&quot; These are the words <br/>
of State Senator Charles Starr, R, Chairman of the Senate Education <br/>
Committee. Strong words from an elected official, even in a private <br/>
letter.<br/>
<br/>
The Bad News: School and union representatives called for Starr&#39;s resignation.<br/>
<br/>
The Good News: Some Senate Leaders supported Starr as a sincere and <br/>
staunch advocate for improving the state&#39;s educational picture for <br/>
ALL students, despite his statement, above.<br/>
<br/>
More Bad News: An entire Letters to the Editor Section was dedicated <br/>
to responses the next week.<br/>
Oregonian Letters to the Editor, 3/11/03:<br/>

<br/>
More Good News: The letters were mixed - some called for Starr&#39;s <br/>
resignation while others supported his stand.<br/>
<br/>
The Big Question: Will the brouhaha affect the Homeschooling Freedom <br/>
Bill, a bill that proposes complete deregulation in Oregon? Read <br/>
about the bill here:<br/>

Where Do These Darned Stereotypes Come From?<br/>
<br/>
These days, entertainment is news, and one piece of entertainment <br/>
news has piqued the interest of many homeschoolers - a WB sitcom <br/>
about a homeschooling family, now postponed and scheduled for summer <br/>
showing.  Entitled &quot;The O&#39;Keefes,&quot; and starring Judge Reinhold and <br/>
Kirsten Nelson as loving but (stereo-typically) eccentric parents of <br/>
three (stereo-typically) brilliant children, the show apparently <br/>
casts the parents as the (stereo-typically) over-protective type of <br/>
homeschooling parents. When the teenagers (stereo-typically) grow <br/>
curious about the outside world and attend public school, they are <br/>
(stereo-typically) unable to converse with kids their own age.<br/>
<br/>
A show of hands, please  - who is surprised to find homeschoolers <br/>
stereotyped this way? More about that in a bit.<br/>
<br/>
On February 23, 2003, homeschooling author (The Homeschool <br/>
Revolution) Isabel Lyman took umbrage with the TV show&#39;s promotional <br/>
material in her sharply worded article, &quot;The Why of Homeschool,&quot;and <br/>
lambasts the stereotypes. Read her article at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=1167">http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=1167</a><br/>
<br/>
In response to Lyman&#39;s article, Cathy D. Henderson writes &quot;How do I <br/>
Stereotype? Let Me Count the Ways,&quot; claiming that Lyman&#39;s article <br/>
offers its own batch of stereotypes at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.educationalfreedom.com/pages/editorial.html">http://www.educationalfreedom.com/pages/editorial.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Now, back to those stereotypes.  The stereotypes in this proposed <br/>
show seem to me to derive either directly or indirectly from the very <br/>
reasons we love to cite when we promote homeschooling. Doesn&#39;t our <br/>
success practically guarantee that sometime, somewhere, somebody is <br/>
going to try to lampoon homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I figure that we win, no matter what happens.  If the show turns out <br/>
to be actually funny, we as homeschoolers can show that we have the <br/>
maturity to laugh at ourselves, all the while using the show as a <br/>
springboard to redirect the public eye to a more truthful view of <br/>
homeschooling. If the show is a dud, we&#39;ll only have to endure it for <br/>
a few weeks, all the while using the show as a springboard to <br/>
redirect the public eye to a more truthful view of homeschooling. And <br/>
perhaps the show won&#39;t air at all.<br/>
<br/>
Secretly, I hope the show turns out to be a hilarious send-up of <br/>
public school stereotypes through the eyes of three stereotyped <br/>
homeschooled kids - now THAT would be funny.  Have the producer call <br/>
me - I have some ideas.<br/>

A Homeschooler is a Homeschooler is...<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago, I innocently offered a simple definition of <br/>
&#39;homeschooling&#39; on a national e-mail list.  Big mistake!  Much fur <br/>
was destined to fly before the topic was dropped!  Some folks can <br/>
barely have a meaningful conversation because the situations and <br/>
definitions vary so much from one state to another.<br/>
<br/>
The topic resurfaces on lists from time to time, but a meeting of <br/>
diverse minds on which to build consensus is a rare bird.  Until now. <br/>
The latest discussion serves to clarify &#39;homeschooling&#39; in ways that <br/>
I&#39;ve not seen before.<br/>
<br/>
 From Pam Sorooshian on the HEM-Political Action list: &quot;My interest is <br/>
in how to describe homeschooling, at a national level, without being <br/>
confusing and without stepping on the toes of those who are in states <br/>
such as Washington and Ohio where the law defines homeschooling but <br/>
still being able to talk about there being any homeschoolers at all <br/>
in states where all are either enrolled in public or private schools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wish I&#39;d said that.<br/>
Join the list and read all about it or stir up the discussion anew:<br/>

The &quot;More Stereotypes&quot; Department<br/>
<br/>
Are You A &quot;Crunchy Con?&quot;<br/>
The Times-Picayune, New Orleans LA.   March 8, 2003<br/>
 From the article:<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s &#39;crunchy,&#39; as in crunchy granola. There&#39;s a whiff of the New <br/>
Age movement about them. They eat organic food and oppose suburban <br/>
sprawl. They rarely watch TV and question consumerism, value the arts <br/>
and read authors like J.R.R. Tolkien, media critics like Neil Postman <br/>
and eco-urban planners like James Howard Kunstler. But they&#39;re also <br/>
&#39;cons,&#39; as in conservative. They&#39;re religious, in an orthodox way, <br/>
and oppose abortion, euthanasia and same-sex blessings. They&#39;re <br/>
suspicious of big government. They value family and have big ones. To <br/>
protect their kids from salacious mass culture, they tend to <br/>
home-school.&quot; (Near as I can tell, the term was first coined last <br/>
fall in The National Review.)<br/>
<br/>
As if we needed another label.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
The &#39;Why We Homeschool&#39; Department<br/>
<br/>
St. Petersburg Times, St. Petersburg, FL   March 16, 2003<br/>
Headline:  Homework crunch: Is there time to just be a kid?<br/>
&quot;First-graders spend minutes on it. Seniors can take hours. Some <br/>
parents say free time is disappearing.&quot;<br/>
The article suggests that too much [home]work makes Jack and Jill <br/>
dull, dull, dull. I couldn&#39;t agree more.  There is more to life than <br/>
homework.<br/>
<br/>
Finally...<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know what is happening in YOUR part of the homeschool <br/>
world. Are there homeschooled kids and families in the news?  Do you <br/>
have legal/legislative challenges or successes?  Are homeschooling <br/>
issues being represented accurately in the media and in advertising? <br/>
Are there threats to homeschooling freedoms that deserve a wider <br/>
audience?  Is something happening today that will help assure that we <br/>
- and our children and grandchildren - can homeschool with the <br/>
greatest freedom possible? Please share so the rest of us can learn!<br/>
<br/>
News releases, links, discussion group hot topics - you name it, I <br/>
want to see it.  So go ahead -- jam my e-mail box. I&#39;ll be glad if <br/>
you do.<br/>
