<div id="ygrps-yiv-99294508">The easiest juice-pop-things we ever had or saw were the &quot;Boom-a-rings&quot; links <br/>
from Discovery Toys, set into ice trays filled with juice.  They make round <br/>
handles for youngest kids, they can just be thrown in the sink or set over two <br/>
posts in the diswasher,  and don&#39;t have to be stored any special or irritating <br/>
way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
