Call the pediatrian and ask how much Benadryl he can have, then get a good<br/>
meicated powder (Baby Gold Bond or Caldesene). If I were you, I&#39;d go off,<br/>
Dairy, eggs, chocolate, citrus (including tomatoes), nuts, fish, and corn.<br/>
Give them up for 2 weeks then reintoduce one at a time. Also, do an internet<br/>
search for food allergies. Lots of good sites out there. Food allergies are<br/>
a puzzle. My dd (4 yo) is allergic to nuts and tomatoes, lactose intolerant,<br/>
and severly asthmatic. My 2 yo has a life threatening nut allergy, is<br/>
allergic to eggs, (was allergic to milk and  wheat until 18 mos.), and is<br/>
asthmatic. Good Luck. Go call the pedi. Tehy may even be able to give you a<br/>
prescription diaper cream.<br/>

Does his bottom look scalded? That is a sign of an allergic reaction. I<br/>
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true for any allergen, but very true for a milk allergy.<br/>
Did you or he consume a lot of  milk products recently?<br/>

Try Aveno oatmeal bath or put some plain oatmeal in some old pantyhose tied<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227061235">Hi Julie.  My second son is very prone to rash-to the point where if I don&#39;t<br/>
change his diaper immediately after a bm he&#39;ll break out into a swollen,<br/>
weepie, bleeding rash.  Poor little guy-it always hurts him so much!  It&#39;s<br/>
always harder when they are younger, too, because they just cry and cry! I&#39;m<br/>
so sorry your baby is going through this.<br/>
<br/>
What I found, after lots of trial and error, is for my son&#39;s weepie rash<br/>
(open and leaking fluid) the best thing is Aveeno anti-itch cream.  One<br/>
desperate day I was frantically taking every anti-itch and healing ointment<br/>
and creme up to the pharmacist, and he recommended the Aveeno.  He said it<br/>
was usually used for chicken pox, that it was safe for kids. (He was nice<br/>
and patient with me!)  The oatmeal bath also sounds like a good idea-I&#39;m<br/>
going to keep that one in reserve.  I usually put my guy in the bathtub with<br/>
lots of baking soda.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146151059">Tomatoes are the most highly acid food there is.  If you are going to do<br/>
tomatoes in the future, buy organic and peel them.  We found this out from<br/>
hubby&#39;s doctor as he has IBS but loves, I mean LOVES his pasta with red<br/>
sauce.  If you make your own sauce it will also not include such fun things<br/>
as corn syrup which is also a culprit.  He can now eat his sauce with no<br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
Once the rash is cleared up, you might try Bag Balm to keep his tushy dry. <br/>
It works great!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362648914">You know, this is gonna sound crazy, but I&#39;ll bet it would work...try putting <br/>
honey on his hiney (LOL...sorry I couldn&#39;t resist...)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, honey will dry out the sores, is easy to apply and cheap.  It <br/>
works great for acne and other skin irritations, I don&#39;t know why it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
work for an allergy-reacting behind.<br/>
<br/>
For acne, we pulverize oatmeal in the blender, then mix with honey and apply. <br/>
 Works great...if you can get your teenager to use it.<br/>

Hi again.  My son seemed to have trouble with orange juice, and coffee when<br/>
I was nursing, so I did without for a couple of years.  The spaghetti sauce<br/>
could tie in here, the acid was obviously a problem for us.  His bottom also<br/>
turned bright red, and he never really even had a case of diaper rash.  It<br/>
took me a little while to figure it out as I wasn&#39;t doing oj or coffee on a<br/>
regular basis.  It did clear up in a day or two as I recall.  I probably<br/>
used a calendula ointment too.  Hope this helps.<br/>

draws out the impurities.  If I remember right, it also has a numbing <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The honey idea is great! I&#39;ve never thought of that one. But it might be a<br/>
&gt;  good idea to make sure the rash is not candida or yeast infection related.<br/>
&gt;  (It doesn&#39;t sound like it, but without me seeing it, my opinion isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  trustworthy.)   If it is, all that sugar is going to feed those microscopic<br/>
&gt;  beasties. You don&#39;t want to make beer or bread! ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for mentioning that!  I was just about to.  My kids both got yeast <br/>
infections when they were on antibiotics.  The antibiotics killed off the bad <br/>
bacteria and the bacteria that keeps the yeast in check.  With the yeast <br/>
running rampant, they had some really bad rashes.  But, Lotrimin or another <br/>
antifungal would help clear them right up.<br/>
