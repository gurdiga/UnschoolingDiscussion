<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032386844">Sorry everyone, this is completely OT, but for some reason my emails to<br/>
Elaine aren&#39;t going through.<br/>
<br/>
Elaine - Shipping to UK for 2 books is $6 economy (4-6 weeks) and $13 for<br/>
shipping that takes about a week.  You can change the shipping amount before<br/>
you confirm payment with Paypal.  I&#39;ll be at the conference until the 12th,<br/>
and won&#39;t have a chance to get to the post office before we leave, but if<br/>
you do place an order I&#39;ll try to get to it right away when we get back.<br/>
