<div id="ygrps-yiv-110236922">OK, I&#39;m on a roll now  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Zachary has been in Kindergarten this year.  He is learning and enjoying<br/>
- not having any kind of trouble in the classroom.  Many people close to<br/>
us had &quot;worried&quot; about how he would adapt to a classroom situation<br/>
because he is fairly high energy, and challenges adult authority often<br/>
and vehemently.  My dh and I have learned alternative ways of looking at<br/>
his &quot;challenging&quot; behavior(s), but of course, older relatives (old<br/>
school kinds), are sure that we are destined for problems by allowing<br/>
him so much freedom, and were sure that he would have difficulty<br/>
adjusting to the classroom situations.  There have been some outbursts<br/>
*at home* because of emotions being bottled up at school during the<br/>
day.  Going to school was completely his choice, and it seems that he is<br/>
willing to put up with all the garbage to be there.  When he comes home,<br/>
he is able to let loose.  Not really fun for us, but I think we have<br/>
done a decent job of supporting his outbursts at home.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway....I don&#39;t feel that Zachary has really been pushed to learn<br/>
very much while in Kindergarten, although he has been *told* what to do<br/>
and when.  He likes to do worksheet papers, he will do some on his own<br/>
at home.  He seemed ready to learn most of what was presented this year<br/>
so far.  I&#39;m hoping that he won&#39;t need much of a deschooling process<br/>
next year.<br/>
<br/>
Part of my relationship with my children in the past has been<br/>
&quot;quizzing&quot;, &quot;checking&quot;, asking them to perform.  I have done my best to<br/>
put this to rest.  When they ask me a question though, I am torn.<br/>
Sometimes I feel like I should just answer the question or do for them<br/>
what they have asked (for example: when they point to a word and ask<br/>
what it says).  Sometimes I feel like I should be asking &quot;well what do<br/>
you think?&quot;  or  &quot;how can we find an answer to that?&quot; but when I ask it,<br/>
it feels like I&#39;m almost back to &quot;quizzing&quot; them.  Do you know what I<br/>
mean?  Is there a better way of going about this that will encourage<br/>
them to do more of the learning on their own?  Is that part of<br/>
deschooling them from by schooled backround?  How do I deschool myself<br/>
to get to the point where I can unschool them?<br/>

<br/>
I think the deschooling process is the most exciting part from what I have<br/>
read from Betsy and others and my own summers with them as well as having<br/>
been a teacher myself.<br/>
I had taught first grade for 7 years in ps before becoming a mom and never<br/>
met a child who wasn&#39;t ready to learn the question is as I am now reading<br/>
John Holt do you believe they are empty vessels that need to be filled with<br/>
wasteful dittoes and facts? We can do that to them in school and at home or<br/>
we can learn a new way of observing and supporting them and letting them<br/>
learn naturally based on their interests and not on some stifling curriculum<br/>
dictated by a non democratic system. I would love to meet or hear more from<br/>
those of you who have successfully unschooled your kids who are now<br/>
teenagers and/or adults who have gone on to be successful at whatever they<br/>
set out to do.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My children have never had to deschool, so I don&#39;t know.  I tell my friends<br/>
who spend all their online time researching homeschool that I don&#39;t do that<br/>
anymore.  I immersed myself in my children, from homebirth, breastfeeding,<br/>
natural foods and alternative medicine, attachment parenting/now non-coercive<br/>
parenting and finally homeschooling/unschooling.  I am tired!  So you know<br/>
what I do?  I spend most of my time on the sshhh, dont&#39; tell anyone, an aol<br/>
creative scrapbooking board, where we talk about our hobby and a bunch of<br/>
other really silly stuff LOL!!!  This is my deschooling!!  And I have been <br/>
doing<br/>
it for almost two years now, uh oh &lt;gg&gt;....Now I know I am being  <br/>
light here, I have been into the unschooling lifestyle for several years now, <br/>
so<br/>
I can say oh go play, but as a new unschooler I am sure you have a lot on your<br/>
mind, or maybe still trying to make up your mind how you want to go about it.<br/>
So, ease your mind, read a lot!!  Go to HEM or unschooling.com. Their are <br/>
lists on onelist for deschooling, even deschooling adults.  Good luck and I <br/>
hope I have made some sense in all my ramblings this evening : )<br/>

Yes I think it does!  In fact my children scrapbook also and the two oldest<br/>
have their own scrapbooks!!  I give them my extra pictures and they have<br/>
many of their own supplies, they do their own thing and they dictate what<br/>
they want journaled in their scrapbooks.  I plan to make an ABC album<br/>
for my children with pics and stickers and words written around the border.<br/>
Like under &quot;A&quot; I have a pic of my dd dressed as an Angel in a Christmas<br/>
play, then I would put a sticker of an apple, anchor you get the idea.  Check<br/>
out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gracefulbee.com">http://www.gracefulbee.com</a> it is the best site for scrapbook beginners, <br/>

come back to haunt you?) but I am behind on my email, due to recent<br/>
exciting developments with our adoption process.  If anyone is onterested<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to share details.  ANYHOW....  I feel that we should answer<br/>
our children&#39;s questions without reservation, and share with them the<br/>
process for finding answers if they ask or if we need to find the answer to<br/>
a quesiton that they ask.<br/>
<br/>
I think that we are all in agreement that children should be treated with<br/>
the respect and decency that they deserve.  Someone else has already<br/>
mentioned in this thread that we would be insulted if someone were to tell<br/>
us as adults to &quot;go look it up&quot; even in so many polite words.  I also feel<br/>
that children learn best by example.  If children are cynical and rude,<br/>
chances are there is someone in their life treating them that way (usually<br/>
a parent.)  I am constantly amazed by how people talk to their children,<br/>
and more amazed by how aghast and surprised they are when their children<br/>
are rude to them or to others.  <br/>
<br/>
But also of equal importance to learning the skill of manners and social<br/>
interaction, is the skills of how to find information and answer their own<br/>
questions.  What better way to teach a child these skills then by modeling<br/>
them?  Being an unschooler, I believe that these skills are much better<br/>
learned by modeling and allowing them to practice these skills when they<br/>
feel ready and so inclined, rather than to lecture (even mini-lecture) lead<br/>
and coerce them into memorizing them.<br/>

Hi everyone!
<p>Thanks to all for your support and advice regarding my reservations
about deschooling/unschooling.&nbsp; Last night, I decided to quit obsessing
and stop trying to determine the outcome of all this, and, instead, to
go with it.&nbsp; This morning, I picked up <u>eleven</u> books on the
subject of homeschool/unschool that I had scattered around my bedside,
couch, dining table, etc., not counting any of the curricula/texts/workbooks
I also have acquired.&nbsp; Seven of the eleven books actually had bookmarks
in them!&nbsp; Can I obsess or what?!
<p>I&#39;ve decided to do as you have all been suggesting--let the girls have
time to adjust and trust them to come around to learning in their own ways.&nbsp;
In the meantime, I am going to learn something new--drawing.&nbsp; I&#39;ve
bought many books over the years to teach my children how to draw, figuring
I&#39;d get it by osmosis.&nbsp; This time is for me, and them, if they&#39;re
interested.&nbsp; And, I&#39;ll finish the nearly-done remodel of our house,
and spend time building Lego creations with the girls, and just being together.&nbsp;
I feel like that is enough for a while.
<p>In the meantime, I will likely be here, lurking--and looking for more
great ideas.&nbsp; Thanks, again. MGB.
<p>Ruth

follow.  They may pick different subjects, but they won&#39;t be able to remain <br/>
idle.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, be prepared to still have to wrestle with this decision again and <br/>
again.  That&#39;s okay.  Don&#39;t feel like you&#39;ve back tracked when it happens.  <br/>
Trust it as part of the process.  Evaluate where you were, where you are and <br/>
where you are headed.  Each re-evaluation will make the next one that much <br/>
easier.  With practice, you&#39;ll become more and more comfortable with your <br/>
decision and wonder why in the world it was ever an issue and how the rest of <br/>
world got where they are.  (But you won&#39;t wonder long because then you&#39;ll be <br/>
off doing something that is right for you and your family.)<br/>

He might be right.  He might be saying &quot;old enough&quot; but what he probably <br/>

it forever, to develop an aversion, or to be destructive of books.  Pressing <br/>
programming on a child who isn&#39;t ready could cause all those problems too.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t ride bikes who have never ever seen one.  They don&#39;t learn  in <br/>
the dark without knowing what it looks like.  Playing video games will give <br/>
him ideas about the range of options, and the tree diagram necessities.  Each <br/>
time he comes to a &quot;branch&quot; where he makes a choice, the program had to allow <br/>
for either choice, and it has to go on to the next routine, and change the <br/>
score, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you have <br/>
any sugestions on how to deprogram him of these ideas???&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Work on deprogramming yourself first.<br/>
<br/>
First place the mask over your own nose and mouth; then help your child.<br/>
<br/>
Being somewhat a-twitch yourself about unschooling still, you&#39;re not ready to <br/>
advise him.      The more you watch him without expectations and really truly <br/>
SEE what he is doing, not see what he&#39;s not doing (by holding the template of <br/>
learning up and squinting through it at him), the easier it will be for you <br/>
to see what he is doing.  What he is doing is learning.  What you are doing <br/>

 Just started to read the &quot;reading&quot; section in How Children Learn. WOW! JUst<br/>
what I am needing! I really feel like, after almost 3 years of unschooling,<br/>
I am finally &quot;getting it&quot;. and understanding deep down what the meaning of<br/>
unschooling is. and because I have this newly found philosophical/emotional<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144027953">--- I limit the video games...for he would sit in front of the T.V. <br/>
for 12 hours at a time (only to stop and go to the bathroom).  He <br/>
would do this everyday.  I don&#39;t know, I wanted him to get up and <br/>
move...go play.  We have a nintendo 64, and yes he has some guides.  <br/>
Usually ones that cover his favorite games.  He doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
problem reading them...for he loves to read and is very good at it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not for sure about the &quot;not being old enough&quot; as &quot;not being able <br/>
to understand.&quot;  For I honestly think....HE thinks he has to wait to <br/>
do things because he is not an adult.  It goes beyond just the video <br/>
games.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes and your right...I am a-twitch when it comes to unschooling...but <br/>
isn&#39;t that why I&#39;m here???  <br/>
<br/>
I will keep your advice and take a further step back.  Thank you<br/>

I have never told my children, &quot;Don&#39;t drink Clorox&quot;, but they don&#39;t. I have<br/>
never told them not to play on the freeway, and we live very close to one,<br/>

I&#39;d let them know why I wanted them to wash their hands afterward, but<br/>
that&#39;s a real-life, you-really-do-need-to-know-that-right-now thing, not a<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not remembering how old your daughter is, but if she&#39;s 8 or older<br/>
&gt; you could help her understand the drawbacks of mandatory school learning<br/>
&gt; by reading her the fable that&#39;s at the beginning of the Teenage<br/>

&gt; a girl who just wants to pick wild fruit and eat it, but instead, she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; sent to some kind of school where to &quot;prepare&quot; her for learning, she has<br/>
&gt; to eat big, unappetizing piles of cafeteria food as &quot;eating practice&quot;.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s an interesting way to start a discussion about different styles of<br/>
&gt; learning.  It demonstrates vividly how trying to force learning can<br/>
&gt; really kill the learning &quot;appetite&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A similar comparison is from Ivan Illych said a worksheet is like taking<br/>
