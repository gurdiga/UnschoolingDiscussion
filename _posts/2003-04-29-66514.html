<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459600291">Hey Sandra...and others participating in the conference.  I know a <br/>
wonderful tropical island out in the East China Sea that would be a <br/>
great location for the next unschooling conference &lt;big grins&gt;.  How <br/>
I would love to fly back and join the one in SC.  The flight isn&#39;t <br/>
really THAT long &lt;sheepish grin&gt;.  Really, I envy those able to <br/>
attend and wonder if tapes will be available?  (I could probably <br/>
arrange for free room & board :)<br/>
