<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831229079">i haven&#39;t been following this thread but i just wanted to make a comment; imo the<br/>
fact that you wanted to learn piano and the opportunity to acquire this skill was<br/>
not afforded to you would say to me that you were not unschooled because your<br/>
parents did not respect your desires and did not follow your led.  your parents may<br/>
have meant well and may have called themselves unschoolers but if a parent is<br/>
disregarding the wishes of a child, particularly in regards to subject matter, then<br/>
they are not unschooling - i think we (unschoolers) may disagree about how we<br/>
actually do this but the component of child-led must be predominate or it is not<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

&gt; &gt;     I was not home schooled and I have often wished I had &gt;learned to play<br/>
&gt; the piano when I was younger.  So, at the age &gt;of 40, I started taking piano<br/>
&gt; lessons!  I love it!  I usually &gt;practice about an hour a day and can hardly<br/>
&gt; walk by the piano &gt;without being drawn to it.  My unschooled daughter, on the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;other hand, has no interest at all AT THIS TIME.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always wanted to learn piano; my mother, on the other hand, didn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; much interest in it because she&#39;d had lessons foisted on her from the time she<br/>
&gt; was a little girl. I&#39;d played viola in elementary school, but there were no<br/>
&gt; more lessons afterwards. I started taking piano again when I was 17 and it was<br/>
&gt; available as a class in school. I loved it! I&#39;ve made plans to take it up again<br/>
&gt; shortly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My point is, learning isn&#39;t something to be accomplished while &gt;you are a child<br/>
&gt; and then you go live your &quot;real&quot; life.  We are &gt;all &quot;unschooling&quot; from the day<br/>
&gt; we are born until the day<br/>
&gt; &gt;we die.  First and foremost, I want my daughter to enjoy &gt;learning and to find<br/>
&gt; the things in life that bring her joy and &gt;passion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I totally agree!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834152960">Thanks so much for sharing your experience with us, Hafidha.<br/>
<br/>
I was just curious to know WHAT you did during those unschooling years?<br/>
Your parents did not take you anywhere?  You had no interests, hobbies,<br/>
or outside activities?<br/>
<br/>
If you could give a little more detail I&#39;d find it very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi there,<br/>

&gt; &gt; I only feel like I have a lot of catching up to do as an adult<br/>
&gt; &gt; because there are a lot of things I have an interest in that I wish I<br/>
&gt; &gt; already knew (e.g. Latin & piano) - and that I could have learned back<br/>
&gt; &gt; then if I&#39;d known how to be diligent.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, as a matter of interest, were you interested in these things back then?<br/>
&gt; I know that some of the things I was interested in at that age myself, I<br/>
&gt; have absolutely no interest in now, and the things I am interested in now,<br/>
&gt; held no attraction for me then.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My main suggestion to parents (and I don&#39;t intend this to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be AT ALL accusatory)  is to really fight the urge to be lazy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you mean by lazy? If things are important enough to us, we will do<br/>
&gt; them. If they aren&#39;t important enough to do them willingly, then are they<br/>
&gt; really worth doing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Make<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure your kids are really learning and engaged in life - taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; lessons, volunteering, getting outdoors, and developing skills;<br/>
&gt; &gt; whether they&#39;re playing an instrument, re-enacting history, sewing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; gardening, working on computers, fixing cars, or flying planes, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; should be experiencing things and trying things out. We don&#39;t always<br/>
&gt; &gt; have these opportunities as adults. (We should, but we don&#39;t.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No matter how many things we offer our kids, even if we have an endless<br/>
&gt; money supply and endless time and energy available, there will still be<br/>
&gt; things they don&#39;t get to experience. I think that for many children today<br/>
&gt; (adults too), who are incredibly busy, what they are really missing out on<br/>
&gt; is time to reflect, time to dream, time to simply &#39;be&#39;. I&#39;m not trying to be<br/>
&gt; critical, because I too have seen kids who have very narrow lives and who<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t get to experience a wide enough - IMO - variety in their lives, but I<br/>
&gt; do think it is important not to swing the other way and burden our kids with<br/>
&gt; so much &#39;opportunity&#39; that they never get to discover the world within<br/>
&gt; themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Unschooling is only an advantage, I believe, when kids are MORE<br/>
&gt; &gt; involved in life than they would be if they were in school. And when<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are more in touch with themselves. I was VERY in touch with<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself as an unschooling teen, but I wasn&#39;t immersed in life; that was<br/>
&gt; &gt; a very serious inbalance, and seven years later it&#39;s something I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; still trying to right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I&#39;d agree with you here, but finding that balance is hard, and it is easy<br/>
&gt; to react and swing the pendulum too far the other way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  There are so many things<br/>
&gt; &gt; I want to do, that if one thing doesn&#39;t work out it just points me in<br/>
&gt; &gt; another direction I was interested in anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cool! Go for it :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566052974"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Things are going to  be different around here from now on.<br/>
&gt; Amy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not picking on Amy :-) but I just wanted to comment. I&#39;m often<br/>
dismayed at people who change their whole way of parenting (hs-ing, etc)<br/>
because of an off hand remark or one person&#39;s story that they&#39;ve heard<br/>
on-line. I really appreciated Hafidha&#39;s story (tho, sadly, I saw some of<br/>
my childhood in what she described, and I was sent to school), but I<br/>
would urge everyone to not go against their instincts because of one<br/>
story, which, by the way, was over-all a positive one! Children are<br/>
different and so are parents. I don&#39;t think unschooling or parenting the<br/>
way someone else says to will work. You have to raise your kids the way<br/>
that works for you and your family. We can learn by other&#39;s successes<br/>
and mistakes, and the example of others certainly gives us something to<br/>
think about (which is one reason we&#39;re all on this list) but I don&#39;t<br/>
think we should let ourselves have knee-jerk reactions to other people&#39;s<br/>
experiences. Basically, we&#39;re all going to make mistakes. Whether you<br/>
send your kids to school, or homeschool, or unschool, there are always<br/>
going to be things you could have done better, and things you could have<br/>
done worse. I think we should learn as much as we can from the<br/>
experiences of others, take a good, hard look at our own families, and<br/>
then do what our instincts tell us to do. <br/>
<br/>
And Amy, I&#39;m really not singling you out. I did notice you said you&#39;ve<br/>
been worried about how it&#39;s going for your family so it&#39;s not just<br/>
Hafidha&#39;s story that is prompting you to make a change. But I have met<br/>
too many people online who read one story from one person and then panic<br/>
and run out and change everything. I just thought I&#39;d comment on that. <br/>
