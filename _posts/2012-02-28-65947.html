<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312871952">My family has access to an educational trust fund.  I&#39;d like to put together a budget for assistance with things like magazine subscriptions, books, excursions, computer hardware & software, etc, but without a curriculum I&#39;m not quite sure where to start.  I don&#39;t think I can ask for carte blanc even though unschooling the girls (4 & 6) will be less expensive than sending them to a private school.<br/>
<br/>
My mom recommends throwing every single line item I can think of into the budget and negotiating from there.  I worry doing so may dampen the very good relationship I&#39;ve developed with the fund&#39;s manager.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on how to phrase the funding request in an honest and clear way without having to discuss/defend unschooling in depth or sounding like I don&#39;t really know what I want?<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re finishing up the current school year at a small Montessori school so I have some time to prepare.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Aloha,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You might want to explore the unschooing curriculum page at Sandra&#39;s<br/>
website - it may give you some ideas for how to organize what you present<br/>
to the educational trust fund.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
On the right of that page you&#39;ll see links to &quot;Acme Academy.&quot; Where I live<br/>
(NH) I file an annual portfolio and narrative of what the kids have done<br/>
each school year to meet the state reporting requirements. I&#39;ve found the<br/>
Acme Academy resources to be *extremely* helpful in figuring out how to<br/>
translate our unschooling life into a form that makes sense to school<br/>
officials.<br/>
<br/>
Do you really need to explain, or even mention unschooling when submitting<br/>
your materials list? Especially since your children aren&#39;t school age?<br/>
Well, maybe the 6yo is school age, depending on what state you live in.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mention unschooling when writing our annual narratives - using the<br/>
word unschooling when communicating with teachers or educators can be akin<br/>
to waving a red flag in front of a bull. I just don&#39;t want the hassle.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I wrote at the top of Molly&#39;s 2010 - 2011 portfolio narrative.<br/>
It&#39;s adapted from the Acme curriculum statement on Sandra&#39;s page.<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Molly�s homeschooling program provided her with a natural learning<br/>
environment, extensive real-world experience, flexibility of schedule<br/>
designed to address her specific needs and inclinations. Her program was<br/>
developmentally appropriate, integrated, fully individualized, and<br/>
continually built upon her strengths and interests throughout the year.&quot;*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>
Anna (16), Molly (13)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261844192">I agree with Cara, present &quot;Educational Objectives&quot;  or something similarly named as if you were reporting to a school district. Perhaps even use phrases like,: &quot;Primary Text/Source for X subject&quot; for the more expensive items like museum memberships, video game systems/computers, microscope, plane tickets to wherever, etc.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll find more useful sample documents here:<br/>

<br/>
Instead of saying &quot;No Curriculum&quot; say &quot;Self-Designed Learning Plan&quot; or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me if you&#39;d like a copy of the objectives I submitted to our school district.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202051877">Thanks, Cara, for the link and especially for the sample of how you begin your narrative.<br/>
<br/>
I agree, it&#39;s unnecessary to mention unschooling unless I want to begin a discussion of it. But, when asking for things like a $500 microscope, it feels a little weird to think it&#39;s an item I will &quot;strew&quot; rather than ask them to use for a specific bit of learning (though I know they&#39;ll use it - last night they got their cheap microscope down and pretended to be moth scientists, sketching the moth in various positions and calling me Doctor Miliana). Or perhaps I don&#39;t think it&#39;s weird, I just worry the fund manager might ask for information on how the microscope will be used and I don&#39;t have a tidy answer. <br/>

<br/>
The tidy answer is &quot;for science.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t need to ask them to use a microscope for specific  &quot;bits of learning.&quot;    YOU use it!  Find things to look at, and YOU look at them.  If it&#39;s interesting enough, show one or two of your kids.  If it&#39;s not interesting enough, no big deal.  <br/>
<br/>
The microscope will last for years, too, so it&#39;s equipment not supplies.  That will make it seem more valuable, if it&#39;s an inventory item rather than an expense for a single year.  Maybe you should go for a more expensive microscope.  One of the binocular top and bottom lit ones.  (I need to get ours fixed; it was awesome to have it when it was working better.)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d look at what is in the area you live in.  What kind of museums are there?  I&#39;d get some memberships to things like the zoo or a children&#39;s museum.  Those are line item things that are also tax write offs.  How about the local bookstore?  Perhaps a card with money on it, so that you can buy books as you need them.  <br/>
<br/>
Extra computers are nice to have.  Can you add that to the list?  PC games are pretty inexpensive.<br/>
<br/>
What about local parks?  Can you get a year pass to all the state or federal parks for the area?  (I don&#39;t know how other countries are if you aren&#39;t from the US)<br/>
<br/>
Can you get punch cards or a pass card to the local recreation center?<br/>
<br/>
If the kids are in a Montessori school now, think about how you could phrase all the things you want to do within that.  Above, you have hands on nature and activities as well as books.  Do you have an educational store nearby that you can get a card for?  That can be used to purchase things like magnifying glasses for cool things you&#39;ve found in all those nature activities you are doing, or for buying coloring books and other &quot;workbooks&quot; that seem fun and relevant.<br/>
<br/>
The things we spend money on at my house are events and the gas to get there.  This week we are seeing a &quot;school&quot; viewing of Giselle done by the local ballet company.  The tickets were $3 each.  In 2 months we are doing a train trip, another &quot;school&quot; thing where the tickets are $12 each and we go to another city, a 4 hr ride there.  There are LOTS of things like that in my area that homeschoolers put together to get &quot;school&quot; discounts.<br/>
<br/>
If you look online for your area, you can find events for the year, or if you know of things that you like to do each year, add that.  Is there an annual Christmas production you like?  What about a tulip festival, or other Easter time activity?  You can also cross reference school type calendars to see what monthly activities are done.  Like black history month, what kind of local events happen where you live?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps go through each school month and think of one or two activities that cost money and add those to the line items, you can mark the dates and tack on a follow up project for them to buy cool crafty things with.<br/>
<br/>
That is what I would do and how I would present it.  Frame it with the free form ideas of Montessori and within a month to month activities with follow up, along with passes to local area things that are ongoing like zoos and museums, rec centers and parks.<br/>

<br/>
Your kids are 4 and 6.  Don&#39;t put expensive things like microscopes on you list.  Play microscopes are good enough for now.  Focus on little kid things, age relevant things.  If you ask for things like microscopes, you might appear to not know anything about child development.  Microscopes are fun, but usually are for older kids.<br/>
<br/>
If you think about a progressive style classroom for that age set, you&#39;d find things like dress up bins, building block sets, books, little nature objects, lots and lots of art supplies, pictures of interesting things on the walls, baby dolls, play jungle gyms, a computer with some cute games, etc.  You could set up a room in the house like that.  It doesn&#39;t mean that it needs to stay that way or be used that way, but this is for you to &quot;think&quot; that way so that you can present this to a funds manager.<br/>
<br/>
If you were to do line items on such a space, it could look like this:<br/>
<br/>
Storage bins, 3 sets, stackable<br/>
<br/>
Art supplies, paper, scissors, glue, stamps, markers, paints, glitter, beads, etc<br/>
<br/>
Craft table and chairs<br/>
<br/>
book shelf<br/>
<br/>
Hand manipulatives, blocks, nature objects, magnifying glass, touchables, sensory items<br/>
<br/>
Books<br/>
<br/>
Learning items, calendar, poster charts, computer lab with games<br/>
<br/>
Other items, yearly passes to museums<br/>
<br/>
Do you get the idea?  This is how someone might set up a school year and space for the ages of 4-6.  You can add odd things in there based on what your kids like to do.  If they like building things, add more of that.  If they like dress up, add more of that and maybe a little puppet theater to go with it.  If they like computer games, add more of that.<br/>
<br/>
 The big funds come later when your kids have big passions like acting and theater classes.  You have time to wait for those things.  Little kids equals little things, how to fill up your days with activities and outings that you all enjoy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262388480">Although at age 6 my DS would have loved a really good microscope even better if it hooked up to a computer screen. We went to an amzing museum and he spent nearly the whole time inspecting slides of insects, butterflies and allsorts of other bits and pieces via the great microscopes they had hooked up. My daughter who is just 6 now would also love it too. <br/>
The room you describe would most likely really suit my daughter but my son at that age would have rather had access to all sorts of information about science and chemicals and atomes and molecules and gadgets. A microscope isn&#39;t necessary for us to facilitate that but it is on our list of something we would like to purchase and at 6 my kids would both have gotten use out of it. Maybe the use would have been fleeting. We tried to to go to places where we could use stuff like that as we couldn&#39;t afford one. However he wasn&#39;t interested in a toy one at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37594148">Hi Jenny,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions and for bringing me back to earth re their ages.<br/>
<br/>
We have just about everything on your list of examples (and even a toy microscope that they love) and really, when I think about it, all I want the trust fund to cover are the iPads, the attendant internet connection, the art supplies and the field trip expenses.  Those four things would really open things up for the girls.  Even at 4 & 6 both girls are intensely curious and it would be great, particularly for Ella, the ever-independent 6 y.o., to be able to explore and follow tangents on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you just saved the trust fund some money and me some headache - putting together a proposal for those few things should be pretty easy.  As you said, bigger stuff will come later.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and the other responders for helping me clarify things.<br/>
<br/>
Aloha,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726614328">I have two microscopes. One you plug to the TV and the other is a regular one. Both are not super microscopes but good enough to have fun. I got both for very little at Goodwill.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Jenny with things like:<br/>
<br/>
Membership to Zoos, Museums,  <br/>
Annual passes to National and State and local parks<br/>
Money for gas, theater, movies and shows for the kids<br/>
Our health club is amazingly set up for children so that would be included, it has a huge area for winter and indoor<br/>
stuff and a nice pool with a big slide and a huge sand area with a couple playsets.<br/>
My list would include money for Gigi&#39;s horse back riding and ballet/dance<br/>
 Showing our cows<br/>
Skiing ( new for my kids who absolutely loved it)<br/>
We have a big and nice playset and I would love to add a trampoline to my backyard.<br/>
Some money for traveling to see things, parks, places and people!<br/>
Computers and gaming , plus high speed internet<br/>
Magazine subscription ( MD specially like history , World War II magazines)<br/>
 I do receive some collections on the mail like Wildlife Explorers and Ancient Civilizations DVD collection ( by History channel)<br/>
 I have  lots of puzzles, art supplies, craft supplies, notebooks, pens, paper,   manipulatives, plau dough, moon sand, and all those kind of things. <br/>
Books! ( we do use the library for books, magazines, audio books and even some games!)<br/>
