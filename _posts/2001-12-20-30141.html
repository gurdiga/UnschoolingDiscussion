<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071395581">My 5yo loves magic.  I got her a little magic kit for her birthday.  She was<br/>
bummed that it was &quot;just tricks&quot;.  She enjoys the wand and often uses it to<br/>
&quot;distapeeered people&quot;.  As long as we play along with her, even for just a<br/>
minute, she is quite happy, and I have to say the other kids have been real<br/>
troopers about being suddenly struck &quot;blind&quot;.  She now wants a top hat and<br/>
cape.<br/>
