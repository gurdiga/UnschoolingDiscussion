<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774005028">Here&#39;s a must see website for information about all of our national parks,<br/>
monuments, and historic sites.<br/>
<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nps.gov/">http://www.nps.gov/</a><br/>
<br/>
If you can swing it, a great time to visit many of these places is either<br/>
May or September  when they are less crowded.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some information about the Little Bighorn Battlefield:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nps.gov/libi/index.htm,">http://www.nps.gov/libi/index.htm,</a> a place we visited last month.<br/>
<br/>
One idea which intrigues me is that of choosing an historic site for which I<br/>
have an interest.  Then I would bone up on it for several months by reading<br/>
books, writing essays, discussing it with subject matter experts, exchanging<br/>
e-mails etc.  When I felt competent enough, I could go there and be a<br/>
volunteer tour guide for six months or so.  After that, I might choose<br/>
another perhaps unrelated site and start the process all over again.<br/>
<br/>
What a great way to become educated, meet people, and give something back to<br/>
the community all at the same time!  At least to me, this option blows the<br/>
socks off the more conventional way of &quot;getting educated&quot; (paying tuition,<br/>
listening to lectures, completing homework assignments, and taking tests).<br/>
