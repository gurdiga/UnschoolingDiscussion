<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066701022">I know this sounds strange, but when my 3yo objects to something, what often <br/>
works is to sympathize (&quot;I know it&#39;s really rotten that we have to leave <br/>
now, I wish we could stay...&quot; &quot;I would love to get some French fries! I wish <br/>
I had some now!&quot;). It seems to make him feel better than if I try to change <br/>
his mind about being unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
When he objects to something in a very loud and whiny way, I tell him right <br/>
away that he can cry as hard as he wants and it&#39;s not going to change my <br/>
mind. (Screaming for candy in the store is one example.) I actually urge <br/>
him, very sincerely, to scream and howl as loudly as he can. (Louder! <br/>
Louder!)<br/>
<br/>
That really seems to take the wind out of his sails for tantrums. It works <br/>
for my little guy ... maybe it will help someone else too.<br/>
<br/>
As far as not behaving civilly at home...I think we&#39;re pretty tolerant, but <br/>
if he completely disrupts dinner, or Tony and I can&#39;t read a book because <br/>
Nicky is yelling that he wants to read something else, I take him by the <br/>
hand and lead him to his room. I tell him he can rejoin us when he can be <br/>
quiet or stop spitting or stop throwing food or whatever (aren&#39;t toddlers <br/>
delightful? Well, yes, they can be....). That seems to leave the decision to <br/>
return in his control.<br/>
