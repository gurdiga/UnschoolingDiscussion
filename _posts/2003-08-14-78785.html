<br/>
Shakespeare is WAY more important than algebra and chemistry, unless one <br/>
works doing chemical research or nuclear physics or some weirdo thing like that.<br/>
<br/>
This week Marty, a macho 14 year old American boy, watched Othello with me.  <br/>
<br/>
I studied Othello in college, meaning it was one of the plays I had to read <br/>
and talk about and pass a test on.    Then I saw it when it came out with <br/>
Lawrence Fishburn and Kenneth Branagh.  I haven&#39;t watched the other two Othello <br/>
movies.<br/>
<br/>
So... I had read it once in the 70&#39;s, seen a movie in the early 80&#39;s, and <br/>
that was all. Seems like a lot.  (Plus all my familiarity with other Shakespeare <br/>
plays, and being raised reading the King James Bible, and the cherry on the <br/>
top of &quot;I have an English degree.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
So I asked Marty if he wanted to watch it with me since it has Lawrence <br/>
Fishburn.  Marty and I have been Lawrence Fishburn fans since he was Cowboy Curtis <br/>
on PeeWee&#39;s Playhouse, and we rooted for him in Searching for Bobby Fisher, <br/>
and so Marty said &quot;Sure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I warned him it wasn&#39;t a happy play.  Definitely a trajedy.<br/>
<br/>
Well.  Marty understood what was going on perfectly well.  He learned the <br/>
characters&#39; names as it went.  He was having NO trouble.  A couple of times when <br/>
it seemed least like English I&#39;d look at him or ask him if he got that, and he <br/>
had.  <br/>
<br/>
He made comments that were as good as anybody would have made.  He talked <br/>
about Iago being the main character, and I thought about saying &quot;antagonist&quot; and <br/>
&quot;protagonist,&quot; but decided not to.  We watched half and quit til the next day.<br/>
<br/>
I talked to Keith about it.  He said &quot;Well, it&#39;s because they&#39;ve been exposed <br/>
to Shakespeare their whole lives, and nobody&#39;s told them it&#39;s supposed to be <br/>
hard.&quot;  I told him I hadn&#39;t said &quot;antagonist,&quot; but maybe I should the next day.<br/>
<br/>
What I HAD said (I told him) was &quot;But if they called it &#39;Iago the Shit,&#39; it <br/>
would have given away the story.&quot;   He said it might be because they want to <br/>
focus on good guys instead of glorifying evil.   <br/>
<br/>
So the next day we made an especially good lunch and sat down with it to <br/>
watch the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  The night before, after we had quit, I put on the Reduced Shakespeare <br/>
Company, right to the Othello part, and showed Marty up to the part in the movie <br/>
we&#39;d seen.  It was funny, but I turned it off before they would give away <br/>
what Marty didn&#39;t know.  He had been about to go up and play video games, but <br/>
said he would stay to see that.  It was two minutes or less.<br/>
<br/>
Then he said &quot;Do they do ALL the plays?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not really.  They do all the histories as a football match, and they combine <br/>
the comedies into one big story.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do they do Hamlet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I want to see it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hamlet&#39;s the longest one, but he said yeah, he&#39;s rather see that and then go <br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Hamlet was over, Kirby was back and took over his own video game, <br/>
but Marty didn&#39;t really mind.<br/>
<br/>
That was a pretty great Shakespeare &quot;happening.&quot;   It was more fun for me to <br/>
see it with Marty than alone.   <br/>
<br/>
After we watched the second half, Marty watched quite a bit more of the <br/>
comedy disc.<br/>
<br/>
They were both rented and have been sent back, but I recommend if anyone has <br/>
Netflix getting that &quot;Complete Works of Shakespeare&quot; by the Reduced <br/>
Shakespeare Company.<br/>
<br/>
I saw them perform in Albuquerque the year before they went permanent in <br/>
England, but as explained on this DVD, they have three companies, one in London <br/>
and two touring.  The commentary track is interesting, and there&#39;s a video (one <br/>
camera home video) of one of their shows many years ago at a Renaissance fair <br/>
in California, where they used to do Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet separately <br/>
and then pass the hat.  One of the guys has been doing this for twenty years <br/>
now.  A Renaissance Fair skit became a lifelong career.   <br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in there I had a momentary flash of Marty becoming a Shakespeare <br/>
scholar or professor or actor.  WEIRD.  Marty is NOT the kind of guy I would <br/>
think would want to go academic, but DAMN he understood that effortlessly, and <br/>
discussed it intelligently.   <br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t hurt that the acting was good and the enunciation was clear.<br/>
