&#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me bows<br/>
to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones, our tired<br/>
feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a dimension that is<br/>
more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the &#39;trappings and the<br/>
suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39;<br/>
and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all that, a space for the<br/>
eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>7/8ths is a really odd size, and extremely uncommon in any string<br/>
instrument, but particularly cellos.  Most children under 5 feet use a 3/4th<br/>
size (or smaller).  You should be able to rent or buy one of those from any<br/>
music store, but you&#39;re likely to get a nicer sounding instrument from an<br/>
actual string instrument dealer.  These are the folks that sell, make,<br/>
repair string instruements and don&#39;t have shops full of synthasizers, band<br/>
instruments, etc.  (Music stores are great.  I&#39;ve worked for them, and buy<br/>
from them.  But they don&#39;t generally know strings very well.)  Check under<br/>
violin shops in the yellow pages, or visit www.stringsmagazine.com.  They<br/>
have a Buyer&#39;s Guide which includes a world-wide directory of shops and<br/>
makers.  <br/>
<br/>
The 7/8ths size was originally intended to be an instrument a little bigger<br/>
than a 3/4ths for a budding prodigy, so they could have more size and hence<br/>
more sound, without straining their body.  Generally they are violinists,<br/>
since the physical difference between 3/4 and 4/4 size is significantly more<br/>
strenuous on the neck of a child.  Because a cello rests on the floor, this<br/>
difference is irrelevant.  If a child can handle a full size, they play it.<br/>
Most 3/4 size cellos don&#39;t have the &quot;tinny&quot; tone associated with smaller<br/>
size violins, simply because cellos are bigger in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Please check with a teacher, instrument dealer or other professional before<br/>
you buy; there&#39;s a lot of difference between instruments, and it would be<br/>
sad to be dissappointed by what you get.  If your daughter doesn&#39;t play yet,<br/>
find a cellist who can play it for you so you can hear the instrument.<br/>
<br/>
This is my field; if you think that can help you in any other way, please<br/>
email me off list.<br/>
