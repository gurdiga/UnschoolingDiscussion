my garden loving uncles, my pretty white and yellow flowers that were doing so <br/>
well. Even though I dispise yellow flowers, the fact something was growing <br/>
had me elated. I was crushed when I showed them both and they looked at each <br/>
other, then at me, and one exclaimed, &quot;Rhonda, honey, those are weeds!!!&quot; and the <br/>
other followed with, &quot;Do you mean to tell me you have been tending these as <br/>

day I went out and ripped them all out of the ground, crying that I had loved <br/>
them when I &quot;thought&quot; they were flowers and now that I knew they were going to <br/>

had to be destroyed. Needless to say the other plants died soon thereafter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931607629">i always believed a weed is just a flower out of place. Sounds to me that that <br/>
flower had a place.<br/>
have some things that look great in my yard. that I retrieved in ditches and <br/>
so forth and many  people come get them from me like the staghorn fern. It <br/>
grows  every where in  ditches(funny looking trees with ugly brown cone <br/>
looking things) i keep em trimmed and my neibor and I built a wall around <br/>
them  many people come to get the new growth and are amazed they are in the <br/>
ditches. There are ferns that  they sell in walmart for 10.00 I giggle every <br/>
time i se people pay 10.00 for them as they are the same ones you see in most  <br/>
tree lines people would let you dig if you ask.<br/>
You want a plant hard to kill try yucca plant I have dug it up gave it away  <br/>
every year for 15 years finely gave up and lol it died the next year Finley <br/>
died.I have a lot of friens who have those homes   people tour for the flower <br/>
gardens (inc. my next door neibor) They tell me the secret is lots of hosta&#39;s <br/>
and getting the off spring plant from others. This helps me as I am dirt poor.<br/>

hey any one need  peonies? will be digging up around 100 plants this fall<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Barb!!!<br/>
<br/>
My very dear friend who gave me the aloe, was shocked when she came by and <br/>
saw it. We were looking thru several plant books for things that would do well <br/>
in my climate and would require little participation by me. The bummer to me <br/>
is, I really want to interact with the plants. Shockingly, the 3 new palms Phil <br/>
bought me for my birthday in March are actually thriving. We have decided they <br/>
must feel sorry for me and no one lets me near them unless I just want to <br/>
&quot;talk&quot; to the trees. <br/>
<br/>
Then the thought of cactus plants came up and they said if I go that route I <br/>
should remove the Palms!!! I understand from an artist landscape eye that <br/>
theory, but I refuse to move the palms that are actually living and growing, in <br/>
spite of belonging to me!!!<br/>

&quot;Greatness comes with recognizing that your potential<br/>
is limited only by how you choose, how you use your<br/>
freedom, how resolute you are, how persistent you are -<br/>
in short, by your attitude.&quot;<br/>

lived with them for five months waiting for our house to be built. :-(<br/>
<br/>
She wasn&#39;t mad though. She knows I have black thumbs, but she found it <br/>
amusing that I didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything to it and it still died.<br/>
