<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842413175">I&#39;d guess that there is a range of personality types that unschool. <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t assume that there is only one or two types that are <br/>
repesented. However, that said, the reasons each type is drawn <br/>
to unschooling will be slightly different and it&#39;s that difference that <br/>
is really interesting to me, the people-y NF.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear how the SJs think about unschooling. They <br/>
are the majority temprament in the school system and the <br/>
largest group of A students. (Read that in one of the Kiersy Bates <br/>
books). So it does intrigue me to think about why different types <br/>
choose unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve noticed that NTs don&#39;t think much of polls or quizzes... <br/>
They find them to have too many flaws to be relevant... so <br/>
Sandra... maybe an NT? &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

the poll more), I checked and posted. I generally don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; polls.<br/>

<br/>
Btw, sometimes answers vary not based on mood but <br/>
expectations. People will answer according to what they think is <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; answer but it may not necessarily be the &quot;true&quot; answer <br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen this happen a lot with the N/S and the P/J. And some <br/>
people are not as decidedly one characterisitic over the other <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
To get a better reading, it&#39;s always more helpful to do the long <br/>
form Myers Briggs under the guidance of a therapist. The short <br/>
forms are usually enjoyable and offer some insight, but if you <br/>
read the description at the end of the test and it doesn&#39;t sound <br/>
like you, it&#39;s likely that you answered the questions from your <br/>
mask or &quot;shoulds&quot; rather than your truth. Read through the other <br/>
profiles until one clicks. That usually helps.<br/>

LOL, I know I have done it three times and each time I was different. I catch <br/>
myself answering a question and swaying my thinking its awful. Couple of <br/>
questions on there are written in a way that tells me I should answer differently <br/>
cuz that&#39;s the way I want to be, lol. <br/>
