<div id="ygrps-yiv-706204357">My daughter Megan went back to ps this January. As much as I hated <br/>
to see her go she really wanted to and I respected her choice. Well <br/>
we went to parent teacher conference. Everyone said how pleasant she <br/>
was. Her art teacher said how she would rather flirt than do art. <br/>
Her math teacher said her homeschooling had really left her behind. <br/>
Everyone else had nice reports and really great grades. My hubby on <br/>
the drive home wanted to take her computer away until she got with <br/>
the program.. LOL.. For a minute that was my inclination.. She is a <br/>
very smart, talented girl. Then it dawned on me that was my schooled <br/>
mind talking. That if her goal of going to school was to be social <br/>
and have a good time she was accomplishing that goal and her grades <br/>
were her choice. I had to breath very deep on some of that. When she <br/>
got up that morning she asked what all of her teachers had said. It <br/>
was very important to her that we went to the conference. I told her <br/>
exactly. I also told her how proud I was of her and how I was glad <br/>
she was having fun at school. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julie, I&#39;m new here so if I&#39;m stepping on toes, feel free to ignore this.<br/>
However, if your children do decide to give school a try, you&#39;ll definitely<br/>
want to be on the lookout for the harm it can do. My twins (now 8yo) were<br/>
curious, secure, and very happy -- until they started school. Their love of<br/>
learning flew out the window when their teachers refused to let them do any<br/>
work beyond the class level and punished them (loss of recess) for asking<br/>
too many questions. Their self-esteem suffered when teachers belittled their<br/>
opinions. DS&#39;s self-esteem further suffered when his teacher berated his<br/>
sloppy handwriting in front of the entire class and punished him for being<br/>
bullied (yes, for BEING bullied, not bullying others). DS&#39;s teacher said he<br/>
had ADHD and insisted he be medicated; we later found out that more than 75%<br/>
of the boys in that class were on meds. My daughter&#39;s first grade teacher<br/>
confiscated books DD brought from home because she felt DD shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&quot;allowed&quot; to read beyond grade level. The twins were punished if they played<br/>
together during recess because the teachers felt it hindered their<br/>
socialization with others (even if they were playing in a group of other<br/>
children at the time). At the same time, they were constantly compared to<br/>
each other and told which one was better/worse at various activities. This<br/>
drove a wedge between them and taught them that their twin was competition<br/>
rather than a valued friend. The only thing the administration did when I<br/>
protested these problems was to label me a pushy, overprotective mother.<br/>
Both children became sad, surly, and lost all curiosity. My daughter stopped<br/>
reading for pleasure entirely. My son cried whenever he had to do anything<br/>
involving a pencil or crayons.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it took us until the middle of second grade (March 2003) to<br/>
stop banging our heads against the wall and pull the kids out of school. A<br/>
year later, we&#39;re still undoing the damage. My daughter now reads 3-4 hours<br/>
a day, by her own choosing. My son is starting to journal a bit, mostly<br/>
because he&#39;s discovered the fun of scrapbooking with me. But they don&#39;t<br/>
trust themselves to learn anymore, and they turn to me to direct and<br/>
dictate. It&#39;s only been the last month or so that they&#39;ve really started to<br/>
ask questions again, to voice opinions, and regain even a bit of the<br/>
curiosity they once had. I want to let them discover and explore their<br/>
passions, but they&#39;re afraid to become passionate about anything. They&#39;re<br/>
rediscovering their bond with each other, but it&#39;s much more tenuous than it<br/>
once was.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying your children will have the same experiences mine did, but it<br/>
CAN happen. If I had it to do over, my kids would have never entered a<br/>
school building. If yours decide to try school, you&#39;ll want to be extra<br/>
alert to changes in personality, motivation, and curiosity.<br/>

===========================================<br/>
<br/>
NOOOOOOOO!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now that I got that primal scream out, I guess I should mention that<br/>
my oldest went to 6 days of K in January of 2003--to a &quot;really good school&quot;<br/>
in the state.<br/>
<br/>
What she learned:<br/>
1) riding the school bus when she would rather be sleeping is not all it&#39;s<br/>
cracked up to be<br/>
2) she can&#39;t sit where she wants to sit<br/>
3) she can&#39;t play what she wants to play, when she wants to play it<br/>
4) yes, there are lots of friends around you, but most of the time, you<br/>
can&#39;t actually play with them<br/>
5) if you are the only one who follows directions, you get a lollypop (yes,<br/>
the unschooled child followed directions but not the rest of them--she<br/>
figured, &quot;why not?&quot; while the rest of them were probably busy rebelling<br/>
because they knew this went on every minute of every day!)<br/>
6) if you are the only one who sits on the bus, you get a lollypop<br/>
7) when you go to school, you can&#39;t play; when you come home, you still<br/>
can&#39;t play because you still have schoolwork to do<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm... yes she&#39;s decided for herself that school is not somewhere she<br/>
wants to be. Maybe the 6 days was worth that, I don&#39;t know. She&#39;s the same<br/>
child who just recently didn&#39;t want to write over a mistake because &quot;they&quot;<br/>
might see that she didn&#39;t do it right the first time (during a portfolio<br/>
review mandated by the state). Might just be the perfectionist in her; might<br/>
be the damage done by those 6 days of school. You make the call.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be the damage done by those 6 days of school. You make the call.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest 2 already went to school briefly.  One for a year and another for<br/>
3 months.  The older kids have been telling the younger ones what it was<br/>
like but they seem to be swayed by what they see on pre-school programming<br/>
on television.  Little Bill always has such a fun time with his super-cool<br/>
teacher &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
None of my younger kids are the quietly compliant type so I don&#39;t see this<br/>
being a good fit for them.  I talk with them about it but they are also the<br/>
&quot;gotta see for myself&quot; types.....so I figure we may just have to bite the<br/>
bullet.<br/>
<br/>
I feel bummed when I think about the school messing with schedules again.<br/>
Oh well, August is a long time off so perhaps their minds will collectively<br/>
change.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t see these things as parallels.  The first two are life<br/>
and death situations.  School isn&#39;t life and death.  My kids are sadly<br/>
exposed to &quot;school thought&quot; about children, etc. all the time.  We live in<br/>
the Bible belt after all  (Found out this morning that all I have to do to<br/>
get the Jehovah Witnesses to haul butt out of here is to say I&#39;m Pagan, go<br/>
figure.  &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
We know only one other unschooling family, period.  Most are school at<br/>
homers who, without realizing it, humiliate and coerce their children into<br/>
drivel spitters.<br/>
<br/>
We talk about it.  About the differences between our family and others,<br/>
about the differences between how we see education and how many others do.<br/>
<br/>
But if I do not trust my kids to make the &quot;correct for them&quot; choices about<br/>
their education....then I am certainly no unschooler.  I feel that I must<br/>
walk the walk.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do not think the examples given here are relevant.  I don&#39;t like <br/>
school, but here in New Zealand at least, school is not a life <br/>
threatening place.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that there is a vast difference in the effect of school on <br/>
a child who chooses to go to school compared to the one who is forced to <br/>
go to school.  My son chose to go to school knowing he could leave and <br/>
be homeschooled when he wanted to - he lasted 5 weeks.  My schooled <br/>
niece loved school and was sucessful there. When she had a major <br/>
personality conflict with a teacher, my sister told her that if she <br/>
wanted to, she could be homeschooled like her cousins.  She chose to <br/>
stay at school, because overall she enjoyed it, and the offer of <br/>
homeschooling, the knowledge of an escape route, made it bearable.  Once <br/>
the offer was made, she changed from being a very unhappy little girl, <br/>
to one whose attitude was, &#39;you gotta take to bad with the good&#39;.  But <br/>
it was HER attitude, not one my sister told her.  She felt validated, <br/>
and knew she had a true choice, so she was okay.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think school is a good place for human beings, but if the child <br/>
is in control of their presence there, I believe the damage is greatly <br/>
reduced.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would anyway.  Lots of things besides school can damage children so I<br/>
always keep an eye out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not particularly worried about school because the little guys have grown<br/>
up in an unschooling home.  It is what they know and they see it in sharp<br/>
contrast to most of their friends&#39; homes.  They know they will be free to<br/>
leave if they choose, or stay if they choose, or have a day off if they<br/>
choose.  Very different scenario than kids who think school is the only<br/>
choice they have for the next 12 years.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Julie, I&#39;m new here so if I&#39;m stepping on toes, feel free to ignore this.<br/>
&gt; However, if your children do decide to give school a try, you&#39;ll<br/>
definitely<br/>
&gt; want to be on the lookout for the harm it can do. My twins (now 8yo) were<br/>
&gt; curious, secure, and very happy -- until they started school. Their love<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; learning flew out the window when their teachers refused to let them do<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; work beyond the class level and punished them (loss of recess) for asking<br/>
&gt; too many questions. Their self-esteem suffered when teachers belittled<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; opinions. DS&#39;s self-esteem further suffered when his teacher berated his<br/>
&gt; sloppy handwriting in front of the entire class and punished him for being<br/>
&gt; bullied (yes, for BEING bullied, not bullying others). DS&#39;s teacher said<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; had ADHD and insisted he be medicated; we later found out that more than<br/>
75%<br/>
&gt; of the boys in that class were on meds. My daughter&#39;s first grade teacher<br/>
&gt; confiscated books DD brought from home because she felt DD shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; &quot;allowed&quot; to read beyond grade level. The twins were punished if they<br/>
played<br/>
&gt; together during recess because the teachers felt it hindered their<br/>
&gt; socialization with others (even if they were playing in a group of other<br/>
&gt; children at the time). At the same time, they were constantly compared to<br/>
&gt; each other and told which one was better/worse at various activities. This<br/>
&gt; drove a wedge between them and taught them that their twin was competition<br/>
&gt; rather than a valued friend. The only thing the administration did when I<br/>
&gt; protested these problems was to label me a pushy, overprotective mother.<br/>
&gt; Both children became sad, surly, and lost all curiosity. My daughter<br/>
stopped<br/>
&gt; reading for pleasure entirely. My son cried whenever he had to do anything<br/>
&gt; involving a pencil or crayons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, it took us until the middle of second grade (March 2003) to<br/>
&gt; stop banging our heads against the wall and pull the kids out of school. A<br/>
&gt; year later, we&#39;re still undoing the damage. My daughter now reads 3-4<br/>
hours<br/>
&gt; a day, by her own choosing. My son is starting to journal a bit, mostly<br/>
&gt; because he&#39;s discovered the fun of scrapbooking with me. But they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; trust themselves to learn anymore, and they turn to me to direct and<br/>
&gt; dictate. It&#39;s only been the last month or so that they&#39;ve really started<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; ask questions again, to voice opinions, and regain even a bit of the<br/>
&gt; curiosity they once had. I want to let them discover and explore their<br/>
&gt; passions, but they&#39;re afraid to become passionate about anything. They&#39;re<br/>
&gt; rediscovering their bond with each other, but it&#39;s much more tenuous than<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; once was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not saying your children will have the same experiences mine did, but<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; CAN happen. If I had it to do over, my kids would have never entered a<br/>
&gt; school building. If yours decide to try school, you&#39;ll want to be extra<br/>
&gt; alert to changes in personality, motivation, and curiosity.<br/>

&gt; &gt;What she learned:<br/>
&gt; &gt;1) riding the school bus when she would rather be sleeping is not all<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;cracked up to be<br/>
&gt; &gt;2) she can&#39;t sit where she wants to sit<br/>
&gt; &gt;3) she can&#39;t play what she wants to play, when she wants to play it<br/>
&gt; &gt;4) yes, there are lots of friends around you, but most of the time, you<br/>
&gt; &gt;can&#39;t actually play with them<br/>
&gt; &gt;5) if you are the only one who follows directions, you get a lollypop<br/>
(yes,<br/>
&gt; &gt;the unschooled child followed directions but not the rest of them--she<br/>
&gt; &gt;figured, &quot;why not?&quot; while the rest of them were probably busy rebelling<br/>
&gt; &gt;because they knew this went on every minute of every day!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;6) if you are the only one who sits on the bus, you get a lollypop<br/>
&gt; &gt;7) when you go to school, you can&#39;t play; when you come home, you still<br/>
&gt; &gt;can&#39;t play because you still have schoolwork to do<br/>

<br/>
But maybe if one thought she wanted a horse you could arrange to let her take <br/>

intent of the &quot;let them try it&quot; suggestion, and it did have &quot;wink wink.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly was surprised in a summer dance camp (one week of long days) that she <br/>
could only eat when and where they let her, that she HAD to do what the other <br/>
girls did.  She had expected it intellectually, but she hadn&#39;t really <br/>
experienced it.  She had fun, but it made it easier for her to imagine school.  <br/>
<br/>
The dance camp days were longer than school days.  I didn&#39;t tell her that.  I <br/>
wasn&#39;t trying to be dishonest.  But if I&#39;d said &quot;School&#39;s like this, but <br/>
you&#39;d get out at 3:00 instead of 5:00!&quot; it would&#39;ve seemed (maybe) like me trying <br/>
to encourage her to want school.  Had she asked what the differences were, <br/>
I&#39;d&#39;ve said school&#39;s less fun, but fewer hours too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879583164">I agree it&#39;s not necessarily life threatening, and knowing they have an escape route makes it much better for the individual child.  Even here in the States most schools aren&#39;t too bad.  My school experience for myself and my children was in Australia and from what I know of schools here the ones back Down Under are much better for the inmates.<br/>
<br/>
But, schools anywhere are a prison... where else but school do we lock people up and make them do someone else&#39;s bidding with little regard for the individuals freedom to do such basic things as go to the bathroom or have a drink when the needs arise.  <br/>
<br/>
Even the most enlightened school, if attendance is compulsory, is a place of torture for some of it&#39;s inmates... why risk it?  Even if your child isn&#39;t one of the tortured, they witness it on a daily basis, human nature being what it is many teachers have favorite and least favorite kids in their class.  The least favored know it, even if the teacher goes out of his/her way to not show his/her feelings.<br/>
<br/>
 I too have swum in shark infested waters, but I knew the way out, my children have done so too, but I wouldn&#39;t leave them alone there, so I guess the &quot;Shark infested waters&quot; was a bad example.   If your child is one left intact by school, they are lucky,  just watching the degrading treatment of others is a life changing experience... any &quot;grading&quot; of children at all harms the children, either they feel like failures or they feel superior.  Those who go through many years as top of the class, straight A students are often as badly harmed as the dunces, see suicide statistics for college age kids if you don&#39;t believe me.<br/>
<br/>
School hurts even the brightest kids, my oldest son was bored to death from first grade on and became very intolerant of people of even normal intelligence, he saw them as holding him back because the class had to progress at their rate not his.  It caused my friendly outgoing preschooler to become a different person.  Children change when they enter school, I always thought it was just something that happens at a certain age, but after sending 6 kids to school, and unschooling three I can tell you the change that happened with my older children was because of school, not a normal developmental thing.  <br/>
<br/>
School is toxic to many children.<br/>

<br/>
  My youngest child chose to go to school at 5.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;I would not allow my children to play on the freeway, I would not allow my children to swim in shark infested waters and I would not let them go to school before the age of about 15, when hopefully they could cope with the deprivation of liberty and seeing others degraded and humiliated because they aren&#39;t very bright.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I do not think the examples given here are relevant.  I don&#39;t like <br/>
  school, but here in New Zealand at least, school is not a life <br/>
  threatening place.<br/>
<br/>
  I also think that there is a vast difference in the effect of school on <br/>
  a child who chooses to go to school compared to the one who is forced to <br/>
  go to school.  My son chose to go to school knowing he could leave and <br/>
  be homeschooled when he wanted to - he lasted 5 weeks.  My schooled <br/>
  niece loved school and was sucessful there. When she had a major <br/>
  personality conflict with a teacher, my sister told her that if she <br/>
  wanted to, she could be homeschooled like her cousins.  She chose to <br/>
  stay at school, because overall she enjoyed it, and the offer of <br/>
  homeschooling, the knowledge of an escape route, made it bearable.  Once <br/>
  the offer was made, she changed from being a very unhappy little girl, <br/>
  to one whose attitude was, &#39;you gotta take to bad with the good&#39;.  But <br/>
  it was HER attitude, not one my sister told her.  She felt validated, <br/>
  and knew she had a true choice, so she was okay.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think school is a good place for human beings, but if the child <br/>
  is in control of their presence there, I believe the damage is greatly <br/>
  reduced.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is an older post but i just got back home to my computer today. <br/>
I wanted to respond. Maybe once upon a time K and 1st grade were fun, <br/>
and carefree, and consisted mainly of playing and learning the <br/>
alphabet. And maybe in some schools that is still true. It was not <br/>
true of my son&#39;s school. His K teacher was overly punitive and had <br/>
unrealistic expectations for behavior, and his 1st grade teacher was <br/>
spacey and forgetful and let the mean assistant run the classroom. <br/>
Recess was only 10 minutes long, and some of that time was taken away <br/>
for &quot;bad&quot; behavior. My son rarely got a full meal at lunch time, or <br/>
had time to eat it. The kids werent allowed to play with each other, <br/>
not really, not in class. <br/>
<br/>
The harm it can do....my son refuses to do any kind of &quot;school&quot; type <br/>
work now. The most he&#39;s been able to swallow is about three pages of <br/>
Highlights Magazine. Anything that remotely looks like school, he <br/>
(mentally)runs screaming in the other direction(figuratively)...while <br/>
i am glad he wasnt brainwashed into thinking school is the way you <br/>
learn, i think that sometimes he is turning his back on some stuff he <br/>
would enjoy (like reading and writing and doing puzzlebooks and stuff <br/>
like that)because he thinks its &quot;school.&quot; Unschoolers-from-birth <br/>
might look at these things as just &quot;more colors in the big palette of <br/>
life&quot; but my son sees it as &quot;schoolish&quot;.He rarely picks up or looks <br/>
at any of the books/magazines/etc we have. While i think much of that <br/>
is his natural inclination (reading for information not pleasure for <br/>
example), and is of course totally ok with me,  it makes me wonder <br/>
what kind of unschooler/&quot;learner&quot; he would have been without having <br/>
experienced school at all. I will never know....<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the other responses, so i don&#39;t know if this has been <br/>
said, but in your case i would point out that while the playground <br/>
looks like fun, the reality is not so fun. And if they want to play <br/>
with other kids (which seems to be their reason for wanting to go to <br/>
school?)i would suggest attending or starting a playgroup with other <br/>
homeschoolers. Playing on that playground with other HSers (esp other <br/>
unschoolers!)will be a totally different, and IMO better, experience <br/>
than going to school to do it. I wouldnt force them to HS next year, <br/>
of course, but i would do my best to try to meet whatever needs they <br/>
are expressing, outside of the school environment.<br/>

Sandra made a point about horses and i think thats perfect. If your <br/>
child says &quot;i want a horse&quot;, you might want to help her explore ways <br/>
to meet that need, without going and buying a horse, if thats <br/>
possible. Maybe at some point buying a horse might be appropriate, <br/>
but i would think alot more discussion would have to happen between <br/>
&quot;I want a horse!&quot; and &quot;ok lets go get one!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The original post said something about a K age and PreK age kids <br/>
seeing schoolkids playing on the playground and wanting therefore to <br/>
go to school. Sounds to me like they want to play with other kids on <br/>
a playground. THAT is not school. I would hope that they would be <br/>
given more info about what school is(and what it is not)before they <br/>
were *signed up.* Others have pointed out that school is not the same <br/>
experience if you arent *forced* to be there, and i guess thats true. <br/>
The parent just needs to be careful not to get caught up in it and <br/>
start requiring homework etc.<br/>
<br/>
I have another questions though....if my son chose to go to school, <br/>
it wouldnt just affect him, it would affect me too. I would have to <br/>
get up earlier, drive him to school, make sure i was there at 3pm to <br/>
pick him up, make sure he was wearing suitable clothing, make sure he <br/>
was wearing gym shoes on gym day and took his library books back on <br/>
the right day (i could never keep track of these things!)I would have <br/>
to make sure all his pants had zipper pockets otherwise he&#39;d lose his <br/>
lunch money (this from experience), i would have to attend parent <br/>
teacher conferences. All those things are annoying and would really <br/>
detract from my life, esp the getting up early part. It would only be <br/>
worse if i had other kids....our days might have to revolve around <br/>
the school schedule. With older kids(teenagers)who could get <br/>
themselves to and from school, that might work, but for younger <br/>
ones...it would really negatively impact the family i think. So i <br/>
would want to make sure that my child truly understood this, and <br/>
really truly wanted to make this choice. If my child&#39;s &quot;need for <br/>
school&quot; could be met by getting together to play with other HSers, i <br/>
would explore that first, instead signing my child up for school.<br/>

that my younger kids have. I agree about the negative impact on the entire family. Just <br/>
having my teens go to school part time (high school) which involves my taking one round <br/>
trip 30 minute ride in the car interrupts my day with the younger kids enough that it is <br/>
really irksome. <br/>
<br/>
One other time I sent my daughter on a school field trip with a friend (in third grade) and <br/>
that one experience put her off of school for another five years! :) The same daughter is <br/>
now part time enrolled in high school. She wanted to go full time but we discussed <br/>
starting with parttime to see how she likes it. One year has convinced her she never wants <br/>
to go full time. :) But she is glad that she now knows what school is really like from her <br/>
own experience.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is the story here.  My 11 year old wants to go to school for a week or<br/>
two to experience for herself what it is like.<br/>
<br/>
She plans to go at the beginning of next school year (Sep 2004).  She would<br/>
be 6th grade based on her birthdate, and that is the first year of middle<br/>
school in our area.  It was my idea to try it at the beginning of a school<br/>
year, rather than dropping in during the year.  Good idea?  Bad idea?<br/>
<br/>
Her previous school experience includes one half year of one day per week<br/>
preschool at age 3(we moved during the year) and one semester, two years<br/>
ago, of 45 minute art class once a week at the local elementary.  From the<br/>
art class, she learned that you get only a few minutes to talk with the<br/>
other kids, you spend a lot of time sitting and waiting for the other kids<br/>
to quiet down so the teacher can make sure everyone hears what she has to<br/>
say, and that you need to do things the teacher&#39;s way.<br/>
<br/>
But she still wants to go again to experience what life is like for kids at<br/>
school all day.<br/>
<br/>
I am nervous about it.  What if she likes it and wants to continue?  I will<br/>
feel that I&#39;ve failed at unschooling if she prefers to be at school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to know how best to support a child doing something that I&#39;d<br/>
rather she wouldn&#39;t do.  I could refuse to let her go, but that doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
right either.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In my initial post, i was responding to what you wrote, which is this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We live near the school and what they see are kids on the <br/>
playground. If figure K and First are usually still fun and it is <br/>
free and if the kids want to go have fun, what harm can it do? I <br/>
don&#39;t expect them to stay very long but we will see.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always keep the posters&#39; names here straight, so i didnt <br/>
assume that you had already done what was &quot;basic&quot;....what i read from <br/>
the above statement was that your kids see other (school)kids playing <br/>
on the playground, and they want to go have fun with those kids.My <br/>
interpretation of this was that they wanted to play with other kids. <br/>
IMO his is not a &quot;good&quot; reason for wanting to go to school, because <br/>
in most schools you *dont* get to play with other kids, except for a <br/>
few minutes at recess. Even in Kindergarten, many schools are <br/>
&quot;cracking down&quot; and starting in with academics. You wrote the word <br/>
&quot;fun&quot; twice in the above paragraph, and i guess i am still confused <br/>
about that. Why do your kids think school will be fun? I guess since <br/>
my son had some pretty negative experiences (mostly due to two <br/>
teachers&#39; crappy personalities)in K and 1st grade, we don&#39;t feel like <br/>
&quot;fun&quot; is the word that best describes school. I suppose i could see <br/>
how a never-schooled child might be curious about it. What do they <br/>
feel they are going to &quot;get&quot; from going to school? Or is it, for <br/>
them, just wanting to try something new?<br/>
<br/>
I also agree that it probably won&#39;t do much harm for them to go, as <br/>
long as they are free to immediately leave when they want. I would <br/>
let the teacher know that too. They might be nicer if they know the <br/>
kid has a choice. And maybe they would get a really nice teacher whom <br/>
they adored.<br/>
<br/>
Again, now that you&#39;ve explained i understand better, but from your <br/>
first few posts, the impression i got was &quot;my kids want to play, so <br/>
why shouldnt i send them to school, since its so much fun? I wouldnt <br/>
be a good unschooling mom if i said no....&quot; Sorry if i misunderstood.<br/>

Jack wanted to go to school when he was five. All the kids on our block who <br/>
were his age were going. They were getting all sorts of cool bookbags, colorful <br/>
crayons, new clothes... Against my feelings about school Darin and I signed <br/>
him up with the idea that if we were truly allowing our children the freedom to <br/>
explore and experience life on their terms we certainly couldn&#39;t hold them <br/>
back from this either. I don&#39;t know how much information you can impart on a <br/>
child that age, about school. Much like getting a pet and expecting a child that <br/>
age to totally care for it and understand it, you can&#39;t expect a child of five <br/>
to understand your moral, religious, political, mental reasons about school. <br/>
Nor can you expect a child of five to understand the implications of hours and <br/>
minutes and lines to stand in and lunch at 11:35 and recess at 1:15 and <br/>
sitting beside a bully on the bus. So while giving a child of five information on <br/>
what school is and isn&#39;t is all well and good you might as well try and explain <br/>
the quantum field theory. And while I am not advocating school, at the age of <br/>
five it is really something that has to be experienced to understand. At <br/>
other ages it would certainly be easier to explain. <br/>
<br/>
We explained all we could about school. Jack still wanted to go. So the day I <br/>
registered him I went to Sandra&#39;s site and reread her article about her <br/>
sister, mustered my courage and explained to his teacher and the principle that <br/>
while I was enrolling Jack, I understood his want to go to school most likely <br/>
stemmed from wanting to play with his friends, and that I had no expectations <br/>
other than I wanted Jack to be happy. I explained our educational &quot;philosophy&quot; <br/>
and that grades and meeting standards meant nothing to me. His teacher, bless <br/>
her, got it. The principal OTOH, didn&#39;t. No biggie. We made it to the end of the <br/>
year unscathed. Though I would have taken Jack home at any point in those 180 <br/>
days if he wanted me to do so. The only problem we had was at the end of the <br/>
year the principal wanted more than was required by Kansas law for me to take <br/>
him out. We worked that out too. I asked Jack if he had plans to go on to <br/>
first grade and here is a quote from my journal on what he said. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;In kindergarten we get to sit a tables and color and paint, and we get to <br/>
play popcorn bingo on the story carpet, and we have a bathroom in our room if we <br/>
need it. In kindergarten we get out of school ten minutes before the big kids <br/>
and we get to sit at the front in assemblies. In kindergarten we get to <br/>
listen to music quietly all day long unless someone else ruins it for us. I like <br/>
kindergarten.&quot; And I said yes Jack all that is true. Then Jack said; &quot;In first <br/>
grade we have to sit at desks right? And Mrs. Latimer wouldn&#39;t be my teacher <br/>
right? In first grade there isn&#39;t a bathroom in the room and there isn&#39;t a story <br/>
carpet either. And in first grade we don&#39;t get to eat lunch until 12:45. I <br/>
eat at 11:30 in kindergarten and I eat when I want at home, I don&#39;t think I want <br/>
to go to first grade.&quot; And I said but what about your friends Jack? And my <br/>
wise little man said &quot;I get to play with them more at home than at school anyway <br/>
Mom.&quot; <br/>
(Exactly what I told him the previous summer, but he had to experience it for <br/>
himself to really &quot;know&quot; it.)<br/>
###########<br/>
<br/>
I have another questions though....if my son chose to go to school, <br/>
it wouldnt just affect him, it would affect me too. I would have to <br/>
get up earlier, drive him to school, make sure i was there at 3pm to <br/>
pick him up, make sure he was wearing suitable clothing, make sure he <br/>
was wearing gym shoes on gym day and took his library books back on <br/>
the right day (i could never keep track of these things!)I would have <br/>
to make sure all his pants had zipper pockets otherwise he&#39;d lose his <br/>
lunch money (this from experience), i would have to attend parent <br/>

Yep all those things are true, but if a child does decide that school is <br/>
where they want to be those things don&#39;t have to be true or rather they don&#39;t have <br/>
to be true to the point of making your life miserable. If a child wanted <br/>
lessons in something or to play on a team you would have to make sure uniforms <br/>
were clean to wear and money paid to the association or coach or teacher and <br/>
arrange transportation to and from. Sorta-kinda the same as school. Be a duck! Let <br/>
it roll off your back like water does on a duck! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133349321">Hi there!  Well, I had planned to lurk a bit longer before introducing<br/>
myself, but because the schooling issue is the biggest Im struggling<br/>
with right now, I thought now would be a good time to jump in!<br/>
Im Kristi, semi-crunchy unschooling mama to Morgaine, 4 ½, Orion, two<br/>
next week, and Isaac, 1 month.  Were in the seacoast of New Hampshire. <br/>
Morgaine is academically reasonably precocious for her age, which helps<br/>
my homeschooling case with family at least (unsupportive mother lives<br/>
locally) since she is already reading a bit, writing, adding,<br/>
subtracting, etc. and wont be school age this year with her October 20<br/>
birthday.  That said, Ive had my mother, other family, and strangers<br/>
really pushing the school is  cool mantra with her, plus most of her<br/>
friends are in preschool.  She is really angry that she cant go to<br/>
preschool and public school  doesnt understand the age limitations,<br/>
really, since everyone keeps telling her she can go to school this year.<br/>
Also even if I *wanted* to send her to preschool, we probably couldnt<br/>
justify the expense right now anyway, and I certainly wouldnt send her<br/>
to head start.  <br/>
So weve also been having school issues.  There are times she gets<br/>
pretty upset, but shell ask me, if I want to go to public school when<br/>
Im 16, can I? and that settles things a bit. <br/>
Im wondering if part of the reason some people (like me) really balk at<br/>
the idea of sending kids to school is that we might be a little afraid<br/>
they wont want to come back home to stay?  Homeschooling is something I<br/>
have felt strongly about for years, which has led me to unschooling; if<br/>
she chooses school in my home it is still within the confines of the<br/>
choices I have made for her; if she chooses to leave home several hours<br/>
a day it is not, iykwim?  <br/>
Anyway, thats us, and thanks for all the great discussion to read!<br/>
This is the only list I actually receive into my inbox; the rest I am<br/>
always nomail, but there are several posts I have already put aside into<br/>
a references folder. <br/>

goodness that time is not being taken up with arbitrary homework!<br/>

***********<br/>
<br/>
My 12 year old used to want to go to school.  She would often feel that I<br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;doing my job&quot; of teaching her.  I&#39;ve decided its the age, bec. my<br/>
son went through the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
But now, she seems to have gone to the opposite extreme.  School SUCKS, etc<br/>
etc.  And last night she was telling a friend &quot;schools think you have to<br/>
have 180 days of school, WE don&#39;t do that&quot;, dissing school, but also it<br/>
seemed, dissing learning.<br/>
<br/>
I turned around and said, &quot;Well, WE have *365* days of attendance here&quot;. She<br/>
said &quot;We do?&quot;, with a quizzical look.<br/>
<br/>
And I looked at her and her friend and said &quot;We don&#39;t sit down with books<br/>
and assignments 180 days a year.  Instead, we live each day and we learn<br/>
because its fun and we enjoy it, and we squeeze learning out of every single<br/>
minute of every single day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if she gets it yet, but thats ok.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; That is the story here.  My 11 year old wants to go to school for a week or<br/>
&gt; two to experience for herself what it is like.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ever since we started homeschooling, my daughter has taken summer classes at a private school about 30 minutes away.  The classes only last two weeks, and she picks one that starts at 1:00 in the afternoon since she doesn&#39;t like getting up early.   The public school system does the same type of thing.  It gives her a chance to be part of a herd.  She&#39;s nine now, but still just loves packing her lunch, getting dropped off with a teacher, being part of a herd--all that stuff!  By the way, the first summer we were homeschoolers, she kept going on and on about how she wanted to go to school, but it was summer!  She was too young to understand that, so I offered a summer program at the local private school (one mile from our house).  The class started at 8:30.  She sat glaring at her breakfast on the third day and said, &quot;This is just like school!&quot;   Let me tell you, it was not a compliment!!  That was the last time I ever heard her say she wanted to go back to school!  Deirdre</div>

was still in first grade, i was picking him up from his afterschool <br/>
program, and when he told a little girl there he was quitting to <br/>
homeschool, she was horrified &quot;But if you don&#39;t go to school, you <br/>
can&#39;t learn anything! You&#39;ll be stupid!!&quot; Even my brilliant little <br/>
niece who is almost 9yo (who has decided she believes in the sun god <br/>
Ra)said that you really NEEDED to go to school, if you want to learn. <br/>
(My son just doesnt understand why everyone doesnt quit school, he <br/>
understands how parents force kids, but is baffled why kids <br/>
themselves would buy into the lie.) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yep, seamus too! When i think back to our former life, boy it sucked. <br/>
Forcing him awake at 8am (shouldve been earlier), fighting with him <br/>
to wake him up and get him dressed and out the door, always fast food <br/>
for breakfast, drop off at 9:15a. I got out of work about 5-5:30p if <br/>
i was lucky, pick him up from afterschool program, maybe go grocery <br/>
shopping or out to eat, home, maybe a movie or a bath, and then it <br/>
was bedtime. On the weekends it was running errands, trying to keep <br/>
the house from being a pigsty, going to the laundromat....then it <br/>
would be sunday night and the week would start all over again. I felt <br/>
like my life was being sucked from me and we were having almost no <br/>
fun at all. Luckily i completely gave up on having him do <br/>
homework...of course he promptly told the teacher &quot;My mom says i <br/>
don&#39;t HAVE to do homework!!&quot; in front of the other kids. She didnt <br/>
really appreciate that.;o)<br/>
