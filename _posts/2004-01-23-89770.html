&gt; Tee Hee I just thought that I would email you all what the two four  <br/>
&gt; yearolds in my living room are talking about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Character intro.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy 4 years old, older brother and sister don&#39;t go to school so he  <br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t heard it talked about that much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Girl 4 years old, has been in preschool since Oct.  When asked by me  <br/>
&gt; what she does in preschool she replied &quot;Well just what ever the  <br/>
&gt; teacher tells us to.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Scene girl at table with pen writing letters boy comes up and says...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy:  &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Girl: &quot;I&#39;m doing preschool.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy:  rather incredulously &quot;Pee School?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Girl: impatiently &quot;PRE school&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy:  &quot;Pee school?  Why do you need to go to Pee school?  Didn&#39;t your  <br/>
&gt; body know how to pee?&quot; rather sincerely concerned over his friend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Girl: Really mad by now and very loud &quot;I KNOW how to PEE!  It&#39;s PRE  <br/>
&gt; school I go to not PEE school!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy:  &quot;That sounds kind of rude for you.  Your too smart to waste time  <br/>
&gt; going to pee school.&quot; still very concerned<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Girl:  &quot;I go to PRE school.  I learn all kids of stuff like how to  <br/>
&gt; wash my hands and sing stuff&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy:  &quot;Maybe if your mom says you could come here instead.  My mom can  <br/>
&gt; teach you how to wash your hands and sings all sorts of stuff.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Girl:  &quot;Oh we do other fun stuff at school too, we paint and play and  <br/>
&gt; go outside...  umm.... and see friends and teacher knows funny  <br/>
&gt; stories, but with lots of rules so we can learn what makes us bad.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy:  &quot;But your good!  Oh my then you&#39;ll have to come here instead  <br/>
&gt; cause my mom knows all that stuff and nothing here makes us bad.  And  <br/>
&gt; we have plastercean and puzzles and music and we can jump on the couch  <br/>
&gt; and play in the Fort and nintendo and puter games.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Girl:  &quot;Well I have to go to school or I&#39;ll just be stupid.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy: gives girl a thorough looking over like he&#39;s not too sure what  <br/>
&gt; she is &quot;If you say so,  maybe when they see you know how to pee  <br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll let you go to homeschool.  I&#39;m in homeschool and I&#39;ve learned  <br/>
&gt; everything I know here.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Girl: shouts &quot;PREEEE SCHOOOOOOOOL!&quot; turning red in the face<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boy: exits stage left still not quite sure what&#39;s upsetting his friend  <br/>
&gt; so badly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; sorry for the poor writing style but I just had to share this as it is  <br/>
&gt; too funny.  I hope it reads through humour intact.<br/>
