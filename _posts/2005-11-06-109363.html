I found out that my daughter (14) sometimes says to people &quot;Do you know <br/>
what an autodidact is?&quot; and since they usually don&#39;t, she&#39;s been known <br/>
to say something cheeky like &quot;look it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then a few days ago she gleefully showed me the latest Dinosaur Comic:<br/>
