<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037429825">This thread was bouncing around here a while back. I thought I&#39;d add what <br/>
happened today.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan and I were watching Jesus Christ Superstar today. I had gotten the <br/>
soundtrack from the library last week. We&#39;d listened to it in the car. He LOVES <br/>
Herod&#39;s bit. I mentioned that it was a movie, so he asked that we get the movie <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
He had a BUNCH of questions about the story (we&#39;re atheists, so he&#39;s not <br/>
learning this stuff in Sunday school), and I was explaining what was happening. <br/>
The soundtrack started the conversation about the flogging. When the scene <br/>
approached in the movie, he asked to leave the room---he didn&#39;t want to see Jesus <br/>
whipped. Instead, I fast forwarded through it. He happily watched the rest of <br/>
the movie.<br/>
<br/>
He will probably eventually want to see the flogging scene, but he KNEW he <br/>
wasn&#39;t ready for it yet. We discussed that Ted Neely is an actor, that they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t actually injure their actor, that Judas wasn&#39;t really hanged (seeing him <br/>
step back on the bus was reassuring &lt;g&gt;), and that being aware of what you can <br/>
personally handle is important.<br/>
<br/>
Herod is his favorite character----but he likes Judas&#39;s music and songs the <br/>
best. Me too.<br/>

recent video, too.<br/>

and very talented man.  I will never forget the respect he showed Lexie.<br/>

I&#39;m very sorry for him and you all. Duncan will be disappointed. What a <br/>
wonderful treat to have seen him live and to have gotten to know him.<br/>
<br/>
Our local theatre is putting it on in May. I may go try out (I know every <br/>
damned line!)---or at least help back-stage, as I have such terrible stage-fright <br/>
and have no idea what &quot;on-key&quot; even means! As a 12 year old, I desperately <br/>
wanted to play the part of Jesus or Judas (like THAT would ever happen! &lt;g&gt;) and <br/>
I used to sing at the top of my lungs when no one was at home.  I got to see <br/>
the stage show in 1972 wheb they were touring. Their costumes had not arrived, <br/>
so they did the show without them----except for Herod, who had his tap shoes <br/>
(or maybe bought a new pair).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you got to know him. I&#39;m sorry for your loss.<br/>
