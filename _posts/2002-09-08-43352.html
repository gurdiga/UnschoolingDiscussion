Can you think of these two things as not contradicting each other?  I<br/>
believe that people are innately good.  No problem there.  Our sinful<br/>
nature, or &quot;original sin&quot; comes from doing things that seperate us from God<br/>
and others.  That was the original sin of Adam and Eve, that in trying to be<br/>
like God, they served their own interests, and and were seperated from the<br/>
constant presence of God in the Garden.  Being self-centered rather than<br/>
Christ-(or God-)centered.<br/>
<br/>
Babies are innately good -- but they are totally self-centered.  They don&#39;t<br/>
care if your hands are full or you&#39;re tired, they have needs that must be<br/>
met.  Fine for a baby, but not particularly attractive in a grown-up!  For<br/>
babies to grow into loving, caring, responsible people, they must learn to<br/>
look beyond that self-centered nature for the will of God in their lives.<br/>
They never stop being innately good, but learn to look beyond themselves<br/>
with that goodness.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?<br/>

know what his reasoning is.  <br/>
<br/>
My position on it is that babies are born in need of a Savior.  At <br/>
some point in their life they will have an opportunity to accept or <br/>
reject Christ.  Apart from Christ, all people are stuck in their <br/>
sinful nature.  Once saved, the sin nature is forgiven.  <br/>
<br/>
So the only one who can make my kids good is Christ.  The only one <br/>
who can choose Christ for my child is my child himself.  I can&#39;t <br/>
choose it for him.  My job is to point my kids to Christ, set an <br/>
example of a Christian life, and trust the Holy Spirit to lead my <br/>
kids in the direction He wants their lives to take.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t tell you about Ferber&#39;s thought process at ALL!  But I<br/>
can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever considered him someone I was &quot;like&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how your second and third sentences (above) address the same<br/>
issue.  Yes, I think people need to learn to look beyond themselves to see<br/>
God&#39;s will.  To me, that seems obvious; one isn&#39;t going to see the will of<br/>
God by naval gazing!  My original comment implied (I think!) that<br/>
self-centeredness is fine in a baby, but that a baby growing into childhood<br/>
and adulthood needs to grow up seeing other people&#39;s needs, too.  But what<br/>
does letting a baby &quot;cry it out&quot; have to do with seeing (and thereby<br/>
respecting) other people&#39;s needs?<br/>
<br/>
An example of respecting someone else&#39;s needs was given on this list<br/>
recently.  It involved a child who wanted to do something late at night, and<br/>
a Mom who was too tierd and offered to do the thing the next day.  Small,<br/>
yes.  But that involves a child learning to respect the Mother&#39;s need for<br/>
rest.  Given those terms, the parent in question (Joyce, perhaps?) said that<br/>
her daughter was able to respect that.  Children are naturally good, kind,<br/>
whatever.  They only need time and respect themselves to grow.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think that growth is limited to children, btw.  Adults grow, too, as<br/>
evidenced by the many people here, myself included, whose parenting has<br/>
evolved by what they read.  I also feel that by learning to parent/unschool<br/>
better and putting more trust in my son, I&#39;m moving closer to what God wants<br/>
of me, but that&#39;s profoundly affected by what I believe.  Your experience is<br/>
likely very different than mine.<br/>
<br/>
If the image of people as innately good yet also experiencing seperation<br/>
from God doesn&#39;t work for you, that&#39;s fine.  It was one that made sense to<br/>
me when I first heard it and I only wanted to share.  Faith is very<br/>
personal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675818739">We are all created in the image of God therefore we<br/>
are all good.  A sinful nature is one that is not<br/>
loving.  The opposite of love is sin.  If we are not<br/>
in a loving nature we are hurting ourselves and others<br/>
consequently we will have crying children and angry<br/>
children.  If we do not give love unconditionally we<br/>
will recieve that, if we control we will recieve that,<br/>
if we live in love that is what we will recieve. What<br/>
we sow that is what we reap.  The measuring stick I<br/>
use to measure others is what will be used to measure<br/>
me. <br/>
