<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424388856">I found Mulan refreshing from Disney for just this reason.  It was a twist<br/>
on the female role, as she pretends to be a man to spare her previously<br/>
wounded in battle father from having to serve in the Chinese army against<br/>
the Huns, and she ends up saving all of China but by being creative not by<br/>
being masculine.<br/>
