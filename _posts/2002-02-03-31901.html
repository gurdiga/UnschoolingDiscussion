<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086691627">My son cut his hair yesturday. He&#39;s almost 6 and wanted it to be just <br/>
like his cousins (the one with a buzz cut).<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t mind, after all it is his hair and his choice. He feels he <br/>
did a wonderful job.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to tell you what it looks like, but I find it quite <br/>
darling. Like the beauty one finds in the misits on the island.<br/>
<br/>
He showed me how he was careful with the scissor so not to cut himself <br/>
(he turned his head upside down so he could see what he was cutting). AND <br/>
he had the forethought to cut his hair into a &#39;box&#39; so it wouldn&#39;t be all <br/>
over the house.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I find this all quite endearing. Until his dad got home. One of my <br/>
other unschoolers who is having a hard time adjusting :-)<br/>
<br/>
The look on the kid&#39;s face when his father said &#39;that looks stupid, its <br/>
all uneven&#39; was enough to make a mother cry.<br/>
<br/>
why O&#39; why do people INSIST on judging and offering nothing but <br/>
negativity on issues that can be so full of learning and insight. . .<br/>
<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
