Last week the reason I was quick to say &quot;This is not a TCS list&quot; is that one <br/>
of the principles of the TCS people is that they refuse to share information <br/>
about their children.  They won&#39;t even tell you age and gender.   For me, <br/>
that&#39;s not helpful.  For me, that&#39;s suspect.<br/>
<br/>
Their justification for the policy is that it&#39;s disrespectful to the children <br/>
to share information about them when they&#39;re not old enough to consent (or <br/>
something like that).<br/>

I have general permission to share stories about julian from him, and I <br/>
always ask if I think there&#39;s a possibility he&#39;d rather not have it shared. <br/>
Recently in a post i mentioned a Very Bad Thing J did when he was younger, without <br/>
all the details. I knew that a story about General Naughtiness would be fine, <br/>
since it was making a point, but it wasn&#39;t important that the details be out <br/>
there and it might embarass him. If the details had been important, I&#39;d have <br/>
asked.<br/>
<br/>
It seems a kid can be a pretty young age to be able to give permission to be <br/>
talked about. <br/>
