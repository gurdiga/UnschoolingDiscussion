do. If not you fix it. Apologise sincerely and don&#39;t do it again.<br/>

Real, incessant honesty is a lot of effort and it can cause hard feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how you strike a balance between tact and honesty.<br/>
<br/>
I find there&#39;s no one more honest than a kid. Around here, I often <br/>
discourage raw honesty for the sake of sparing people&#39;s feelings (my 7yo <br/>
refusing to go along with the 3yo&#39;s pretending; blunt opinions of other <br/>
family members, etc) and preserving our privacy as a family (&quot;He&#39;s not home <br/>
right now&quot; &quot;Tony can&#39;t play today because he&#39;s tired.&quot;) I guess I feel we <br/>
ought to be able to project ourselves as we wish, which might not always be <br/>
bare reality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-314675453"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Real, incessant honesty is a lot of effort and it can cause hard feelings.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, especially when I reflect on my own behaviour and thoughts - I have<br/>
to be real diligent in demanding honesty from self. I think this comes<br/>
first, before we can ask it from others. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m not sure how you strike a balance between tact and honesty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I go quiet. If I can&#39;t be honest then don&#39;t open my mouth at all. I<br/>
also do the distraction thing too - change the subject. This isn&#39;t very<br/>
tactful, but everyone gets the message without us all having to go into the<br/>
why&#39;s an wherefors of difference. I never &#39;agree to disagree&#39;. YEp, it does<br/>
make for difficult social times. But most people who know me think I am<br/>
exceptionally tactful. I usually say what I think, but I think about what I<br/>
say first... I target what I say to my audience... I like to know my<br/>
audience beforehand. <br/>
<br/>
Demanding clarification seems to really irk people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I find there&#39;s no one more honest than a kid. Around here, I often <br/>
<br/>

&gt;ought to be able to project ourselves as we wish, which might not always be <br/>
&gt;bare reality.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dealing with this kind of thing honestly is extremely hard. What we are<br/>
doing is cultivating friendships with people who are willing to look at<br/>
this issue too.... finding support to keep growing with honesty in our<br/>
lives. This is really hard. <br/>
<br/>
But we don&#39;t demand perfection from ourselves either and realise that yep,<br/>
we fall from grace continuously. And that&#39;s okay too.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469704776">I had reached a point when if someone invited us somewhere or wanted to come<br/>
visit, and we weren&#39;t in the mood, I was able to say &#39;sorry, we have already<br/>
made arrangements for that day. Can I give you a ring when I can sort out a<br/>
suitable time.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Then a few weeks ago, a friend wanted to come visit on our first fine weekend<br/>
for about 2 months. She lives in the city - a drive to the country seemed like a<br/>
nice idea. We live on a newly acquired piece of land - we needed to work on our<br/>
land and house building. So i said this - and guess what? She wasn&#39;t insulted,<br/>
just came a couple of weeks later on a wet day, and we enjoyed hours of chatting<br/>
without me feeling begrudging.<br/>
<br/>
So often we do things we don&#39;t want to because we don&#39;t want to offend - and end<br/>
up feeling bad about the other person, and they end up confused and wondering<br/>
what on earth they have done wrong! And if they can&#39;t understand my explanation,<br/>
even if it is &quot;I just don&#39;t feel like that today&#39; then they probably shouldn&#39;t<br/>
be in my life.<br/>
<br/>
One of my sons said at 11yo about not wanting to go school (after trying it out<br/>
part time): &#39;If you want to get on at school, you have to pretend you are<br/>
interested in the same things as everybody else, you have to do the same things.<br/>
But if they don&#39;t know who you really are, what&#39;s the point of being friends?<br/>
They are really friends with you because they don&#39;t know who you are.&#39; And this<br/>
is from a kid who was pretty lonely at the time.<br/>
