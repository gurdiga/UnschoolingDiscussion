 </span></blockquote>I have a little bit to report regarding the idea of men being run over by <br/>
moms.   I&#39;ll quote it from an e-mail I wrote yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marty quit his job.  He told Mike on Thursday that he wanted to finish the <br/>
work that was there and then quit.  He said Mike did his &quot;depressed thing,&quot; but <br/>
otherwise was fine with it.  Earlier in the week Marty had talked to me about <br/>
what two weeks&#39; notice meant and how it would work with a four day a week job, <br/>
and I told him the tradition, but this isn&#39;t that formal a job.  He talked <br/>
about how he might quit, and said he might tell Mike he&#39;d saty until Mike found <br/>
someone else.  I said don&#39;t do that!  He might never even look.    <br/>
<br/>
I also cautioned Marty not to say it was about money or hours, or Mike might <br/>
offer him more.<br/>
<br/>
So he said he&#39;d finish current orders, and Mike said that might be enough <br/>
work to last until middle of next week, but Marty finished it Thursday and <br/>
Friday.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to have a week off before looking for something else.  We&#39;re *right* <br/>
by Raley&#39;s, Lowe&#39;s and a Twister&#39;s.  Toward Menaul there&#39;s a video game store <br/>
that really wanted to hire Kirby after he quit at Active Imagination, but <br/>
Kirby turned them down twice.  I&#39;m pressing Marty to go there and get a job so he <br/>
can get an employee discount on the new Playstation that&#39;s coming out.  I <br/>
said &quot;DO IT!  Do it right now!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t seem eager.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;You kids never do what I tell you to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty:  &quot;That&#39;s how we were raised.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Well it&#39;s going to bite you in the butt someday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty-without-a-pause:  &quot;That we were raised that way?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oooohh...   He won. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing wrong with the job, it&#39;s just that when Marty started there <br/>
were other people to talk to and he was learning lots of new things, but it <br/>
devolved into Marty working all alone and doing things he had done before.<br/>
=============================<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s quick. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And I can&#39;t &quot;make&quot; him do anything.   I can offer suggestions, but he rightly <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel he has no options.<br/>
