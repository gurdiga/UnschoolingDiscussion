  I am getting better at being more of a facilitator when it comes to my<br/>

We&#39;ve been hsing for about 7 mos. and, while I&#39;ve never done &quot;school at<br/>
home&quot;, I do waffle back and forth between some structure and unschooling.<br/>
As you were a teacher for 10 years, Karen, I&#39;d be very interested in<br/>
hearing what made you decide to go with unschooling.   <br/>

Thanks.<br/>
