<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135482288">Well, I *think* I have my hubby hog-tied into going to the SC conference, so <br/>
at least I won&#39;t be lonely for long....I guess...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been TRYING to get an unschooling group going here but have had a <br/>
whopping TWO responses.  We have those who *say* they unschool but it looks <br/>
to be far from any unschooling I&#39;ve ever seen.  Most people here, or at <br/>
least those I have met, think themselves unschoolers by way of no set <br/>
schedule to their schoolishness.<br/>
<br/>
Just call ME the Lone Star.  I just need to open my Texas-sized mouth and <br/>
start preaching the wonders of unschooling.<br/>

I&#39;m pretty much with you on this one. Although there are others from my<br/>
state here, I&#39;m the only one who unschools that I know of in my immediate<br/>
area. (county) I&#39;ve been trying to get together with other unschoolers at a<br/>
park for years and haven&#39;t found one real unschooling family yet here.<br/>

It&#39;s not really a conference.   I guess we could call it a conference.  <br/>
It&#39;ll be six or seven of us camping for a weekend and watching our kids<br/>
play.     Maybe we&#39;ll sing around the campfire.   Maybe we&#39;ll read aloud<br/>
from our favorite unschoolish books.  We&#39;ll talk about life.  We&#39;ll eat<br/>
together... Ok, it&#39;s a conference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006676028">Actually the area we live in is called Upcountry Maui (2200 ft <br/>
elevation) and is not usually above 80, cloudy every afternoon, rains <br/>
quite a bit and is green, green, green.  One of the reasons we chose <br/>
to move here is that it reminds me of Massachusetts in the summer.  <br/>
Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t have the rest of the seasons which I really <br/>
miss.  We also don&#39;t have sand everywhere. :)  BTW, I could never <br/>
live down at the ocean it&#39;s way to humid and hot for me.<br/>

  England!!!!!!!!!!!!1<br/>
<br/>
  You could come live in an unschooling community with me :-)<br/>

  Now THAT is a place I&#39;d cut off a leg to move to!  I have ALWAYS wanted to, <br/>
  at the very least, visit England.  I&#39;m trying to talk my husband into a 10th <br/>
  anniversary there.  That gives us a year and a half to save money and plan.  <br/>
  (Keeping my fingers crossed!!!)<br/>
<br/>
  We spent a month in Alaska in &#39;00 and I STILL cry when I think of it.  I&#39;m <br/>
  scared if I go to England I&#39;ll go insane after coming &#39;home&#39; to Texas.  (I <br/>
  think I&#39;ve whined about this before, right? LOL)<br/>

I&#39;m in Hurst, very near Arlington/Ft. Worth.  My dad&#39;s side of the family <br/>

<br/>
I think meeting sounds like fun.  Do you have any flexibility on the days of <br/>
the week you can come?  I was part of a group that started up a new <br/>
unschooling support group here in Houston last fall.  F.R.E.E. (Fun and <br/>
Relaxed -- the Essence of Education) meets on the second Wednesday of the <br/>
month from 11 am - 2 pm.  It would be fun to see you there, of course, but we <br/>
can set up anything, anytime.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have much of an unschooling support system up there?  And how old are <br/>
your child(ren)?<br/>
<br/>

ago and will not come back because she says it is very humid here. I have <br/>
spent the last seven telling her nah, you just remember it that way but it <br/>
really is not. lol Sadly she came in August of this year and reminded me of <br/>
what I had been saying to her. Darn......<br/>
