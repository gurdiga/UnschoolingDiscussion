<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636118603">If you are in the Maryland area, be sure to check out the MHEA <br/>
conference at Anne Arundel Community College on May 18. The keynote <br/>
speaker is Linda Dobson, author of several great homeschooling books <br/>
such as The Homeschooling Book of Answers, Homeschooling Success <br/>
Stories, and Homeschooling the Early Years. In addition, there will <br/>
be dozens of workshops for new homeschoolers as well as veteran <br/>
homeschoolers. A panel of homeschool graduates will share their <br/>
experiences with homeschooling, college, work, and life in general.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the workshops, there will be a resource fair with a <br/>
wide variety of vendors offering homeschooling materials (FUN Books <br/>
carrys lots of great unschooling materials), and there will be a used <br/>
curriculum sale/swap/give-away fair.<br/>
