<div id="ygrps-yiv-798571797">Hello there! I&#39;m Kitty Allie, aged 15 (16 tomorrow!) unschooler, and <br/>
I&#39;m looking for similar minded and aged unschoolers to correspond with. <br/>
I&#39;m a native of US (New York state!). I am a very artistic type of <br/>
person (opposed to other types), I love to draw, inks, pencil, <br/>
watercolour, oil, collage and charcoal are my favorite mediums. I also <br/>
love to look at art, contemporary and Renaissance are my favourite <br/>
periods, but I love it all! I&#39;m a writer of poetry, plays, and short <br/>
stories. I would love to hear from someone who likes to write (though <br/>
I&#39;d love to hear from everyone else too!), I like to discuss and share <br/>
writings. I also enjoy fashion, following contemporary through it&#39;s <br/>
crazy stages, and also historical fashion (particularly the 20th <br/>
century). I have a growing wardrobe of historical costume, mainly of <br/>
the 20s, my favourite decade.  I am a very comical person but I enjoy <br/>
having a good debate on political, religious, governmental, the media <br/>
(better watch out on that subject, you&#39;ll get me going ; ), anything! <br/>
When I have a chance I get in as much reading as possible, all kinds of <br/>
subjects. I love modern American history, short stories, poetry, <br/>
realistic-fiction, non fiction, whatever that come along my way that I <br/>
have an interest in. On my reading table now is: (along with my <br/>
journal) `An American Tragedy&#39; by Dreiser and the `Beak of the Finch&#39;- <br/>
that new book on evolution. Very good books I must say! I am also a <br/>
very outdoorsy person: skiing, biking, hiking, windsurfing, canoeing, <br/>
swimming I do in season (and sometimes out). I&#39;m big on traveling, <br/>
though I don&#39;t get nearly enough of it. (My most recent love is Paris. <br/>
Sigh.) I enjoy theater a lot, though I don&#39;t get to perform in it much, <br/>
I am wild about seeing it, I prefer it to movies. In my opinion there <br/>
are better points and cultural comics made in the theater form. In the <br/>
media (general TV and film) it is for a broader range, and are more set <br/>
on raking in the cash than making something worth viewing. I live on <br/>
music (and laughter), my favorite bands being Guster, Our Lady Peace, <br/>
and the Beatles... the list goes on, though I like all different kids <br/>
of music including hand drumming and piano (Keith Jarett is great!). If <br/>
you have a good sense of humor and anything in common with me- or if <br/>
you just want to say hi- write me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nord.sky@...">nord.sky@...</a>. Love ya <br/>
all, Kitty</div>
