<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040753759">&lt;I am not afraid of disagreements, or anyone expressing their opinion, but <br/>
when it starts to be accompanied by things like&quot;I&#39;m not  going  to deny my <br/>
religion for any one&quot;, which sounds defensive, or fails to aknowledge that <br/>
this is just one person&#39;s belief or opinion, which is offensive it often <br/>
leads to nastiness. <br/>
<br/>
candice&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unforunately that is so true. People take things very personally sometimes.<br/>

deserving of it!&quot;<br/>
