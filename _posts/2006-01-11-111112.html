I am unschooling a high schooler, or he is educating himself.... I hate to put the I in there since its his life.... and we live in a state (VT), where to be in compliance we need to submit a curriculum and assessment. How we have done this is through brainstorming at the beginning of the year about what he might like to be doing that fits with the states categories, books he wants to read, history he is curious about, etc... what he already does... He is in a band which which is a big part of our &quot;curriculum&quot; (writing, playing and listening to music, audio recording, managing the band...promotion, publicity, etc.) and does community service ( and mischief making). If anything end up being different than what we initially reported we just say that interests changed and list what he did do. There are things he wants to learn that I help him with, like how to use design programs and geometry. There are things that he wants to learn that I help him find resources for. We do things as a family, travel... I can be more specific if you&#39;d like.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>=======================<br/>
<br/>
There are differences in having a &quot;high schooler&quot; who was never in  <br/>
school, or who has been out a long time, and in beginning to unschool  <br/>
with someone who has been in school.   Tell us a little more.<br/>
<br/>
in the meantime, though, look here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/teens">http://sandradodd.com/teens</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/videogames">http://sandradodd.com/videogames</a><br/>
<br/>
just to get some ideas of what parents of teens have discussed before.<br/>
<br/>
Also, very important, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
At first, you do nothing.  And then nothing turns into curiosity and  <br/>
interest, but you should expect it to take several months.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &quot;count it for school&quot; in the way that you are &quot;getting high  <br/>
school credit,&quot; but there are other ways to look at it.  If the child  <br/>
is &quot;nearly through&quot; with high school, you might want to look at  <br/>
classes online or at a community college for a child who is  <br/>
academically leaning (who likes that sort of thing) and really avoid  <br/>
classes and textbooks if you have a child who does NOT like that sort  <br/>
of thing.<br/>
<br/>
After you&#39;ve read some of that, if you want feedback on your  <br/>
particular situation, give us a little more detail.  (Not lots, just  <br/>
some.)<br/>

I have a 17 year old (he&#39;ll be 18 in 11 days!!!!). But I have no &quot;high schooler&quot;---he&#39;s just 17! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
He&#39;s VERY busy. He has three parttime jobs. He drums mostly---with an African drumming troups, a Scottish <br/>
pipe and drum corps, his own band, and at local bars with the house bands. Drumming &quot;counts&quot; as art, music,<br/>
composition, reading, history, social studies, math---in fact it goes above and beyond what is required by <br/>
our state! And that&#39;s if he didn&#39;t do *anything* other than drum! <br/>
 <br/>
He plays with his brother, helps out around the house, takes care of his car, volunteers in the community, <br/>
is engaged in art. He&#39;s waaay more active in things than his schooled friends, who avoid anything other <br/>
than the tiny bit of schoolwork they can&#39;t avoid. <br/>
 <br/>
He travels a LOT: last year he went to Albuquerque to visit friends, Bonaroo music festival, Scotland <br/>
with my dad, Florida to see friends and to Disneyworld, West Virginia to Not Back To School Camp, St <br/>
Louis to the Live and Learn Conference, Kentucky to visit a friend---probably somewhere else I can&#39;t <br/>
recall right now. We have a VERY busy schedule this year too! There aren&#39;t many free weekends left!<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling means living a rich life---Doing Things, Being Present, Sucking that Marrow!<br/>
 <br/>
I can &quot;count&quot; everything!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*************************<br/>
My son is 16. Some of the things he&#39;s been doing lately:<br/>
*He has a part-time job as a Coordinator of Religious Education at a  <br/>
Unitarian Universalist church in our town. (It&#39;s actually a position, sort of,  that <br/>
I held most of his earlier years.)<br/>
*Last semester he took an online college course in Marine Biology. This  <br/>
semester he&#39;s taking one online course through the same college (University of  <br/>
Califonia at Dominguez Hill) on Theatre, Television, and Film, and another at  <br/>
Harvard University Extension in Bioethics.<br/>
*He spends many hours a week working on music, since he&#39;d like to be a  <br/>
professional musician. That means he takes guitar lessons and voice lessons each  <br/>
week, practices singing and playing, sometimes performs, writes songs, <br/>
practices  with two bands, etc.<br/>
*He spends lots of time online doing many, many things: chatting and  <br/>
e-mailing with unschooled friends all over the country, general &quot;discovering&quot;,  <br/>
reading ubersite, playing online games, perusing craigslist for music equipment,  <br/>
etc......<br/>
*He hangs out with his parents relaxing and watching tv most evenings for a  <br/>
few hours.<br/>
*He is starting a business doing sound for events with another unschooled  <br/>
friend. They started out last week putting together an impressive business  plan.<br/>
*He has an unschooled girlfriend who lives in Arkansas (They met at the  last <br/>
couple of Live and Learn Unschooling Conferences), so he spends lots of  late <br/>
nights on the phone with her.<br/>
*He reads a lot, plays a lot, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
Okay, reading this is overwhelming me...I&#39;m tired just looking at it.  <br/>
But....because he doesn&#39;t go to high school, he can do all this AND have lots of  <br/>
time to just laze around whenever he wants!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947610781">My daughter is 16 and my son is 12.  She was asked earlier tonight..&quot;so you have never been to any high school?&quot;  She said...&quot;I went to first grade.&quot;  She didn&#39;t elaborate about that but did start talking about some other things.  The guy asking is selling us his house and is probably 27 or so...went to an IB program for high school, B.S. from a major university, then a pilot in the military in Afganistan and now is starting to work on his Masters in Electrical Engineering.  I could tell he didn&#39;t  know what to think of this very articulate young women who only went to first grade and was quite comfortable holding her own in a conversation with him.<br/>
 <br/>
He asked what we do and I told him the condensed version....read, play games, go the library, go to museums and to the beach.  He didn&#39;t quite know what to make of us.  <br/>
 <br/>
 The more involved version would have been...We&#39;ve moved across the country twice in the past 2 months so top on our list would be travel! :-)  In addition to those 4000 miles, she also went to St. Louis for Live and Learn and to West Virginia for Not Back to School Camp.  She has both schooled and unschooled friends that she keeps in touch with through hanging out at the house, e-mails and late night IM&#39;s.  She  plays guitar and piano, sings and takes voice lessons, reads, does art projects, writes and even wrote a short novel a couple of months ago that she published, <br/>
watches &quot;House&quot; with me on TV, loves to photograph people,  bakes a perfect pie, makes bread, roasts chili, is almost ready to take her driver&#39;s test to get her license, makes lists and does everything on her list every day, laughs so hard telling a funny story that she falls on the floor.  Does any of that &quot;count&quot; for high school?  Probably not but our lives don&#39;t need anything to count for high school.<br/>
 <br/>
College is part of her future plans as well as more travel.  She is considering some community college courses this next year....and kickboxing and  learning how to develop her own pictures ......and going to Vermont for NBTSC and to Kentucky to visit friends.  Her life is busy and happy.  She isn&#39;t a high schooler...she is just Brenna living her life knowing that she can do anything she wants to do not only today but with her future.   <br/>
