<div id="ygrps-yiv-366891452">Welcome Nicole,<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on the Baby!<br/>
<br/>
I am Julie and I live in FL...I am not barefoot and pregnant at this moment, <br/>
but hope to be in a couple of years.. I have a 3yr girl and a 16month old <br/>
son, who are keeping me extremely busy.  I am an Attachment Parenting mother, <br/>
and and &quot;un-official &quot; unschooler....<br/>
<br/>
As far as a reading list....anything by Dr William Sears is great and will <br/>
probably suit your taste from what I have read about you.  He has tons of <br/>
parenting books, like 25 or so...<br/>
The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding by La Leche League <br/>
(LLLI)International...these are just a few of my favorites...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t read anything that has not been approved on the LLLI.  They have a <br/>
book list at their site.  If you can&#39;t find it, you can call them for a <br/>
catalog or a book list.  It saves me time having to read things that don&#39;t <br/>
click with my parenting philosophy....like letting the baby cry it out, or <br/>
scheduled feedings....<br/>
<br/>
check out the websites attached to my signature.  They are a great resource...<br/>
<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>

&quot;It helps me to remember that people are more important than ideas and that <br/>
being kind is more important than being right.&quot; <br/>
