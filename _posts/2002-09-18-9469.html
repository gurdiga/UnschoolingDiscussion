<div id="ygrps-yiv-54869283">Hi Heather:<br/>
<br/>
I finally got to read what you wrote even though you told me the whole<br/>
story at the park (LOL).... What I didn&#39;t tell others on this list was<br/>
the conversation that took place over the past 4 months with my mother<br/>
since I was off the list.<br/>
<br/>
My mother is an absolute control freak who has to be right about<br/>
everything.... She told me that not only does she not believe in home<br/>
schooling but that she has no intention of learning anything about it,<br/>
either my reading, talking or viewing anything on the topic.  She knows<br/>
she&#39;s right and that Zak (now 7) is going to be bored at home and needs<br/>
more discipline.  This from a mother that allowed me at 15 to start<br/>
traipsing around the world in a band and then work on a cruise ship all<br/>
over the Mediterranean!!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
She even told me a couple of weeks ago that the law states in Arizona<br/>
(where we live) that kids have to be tested at age 8.  When I probed her<br/>
for where she saw that info she fluffed it off with &quot;on some web<br/>
site&quot;... When I pushed the issue and said &quot;where so that I can write to<br/>
them and let them have the correct information&quot; she got pissed at me and<br/>
told me she didn&#39;t want to argue with me and hung up the phone on me.<br/>
Typical my mother behavior.  I contacted someone from our local home<br/>
schooling group to triple check on the law in AZ and she sent me the AZ<br/>
web site that says nothing about testing (which I already knew)...  I<br/>
then forwarded it to my mother but didn&#39;t tell her I was sending it.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know if she ever read it because she never said anything.<br/>
<br/>
I try not to give her the opportunity to say anything about what we are<br/>
doing because it&#39;s always her opinion that&#39;s the correct one and we are<br/>
somehow harming our children.  Sometimes it does feel like an uphill<br/>
battle.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading what everyone posted about this and (sorry don&#39;t remember<br/>
who it was) has the opposite problem where their mother talks to the<br/>
relatives and never says anything to the mother.  Sometimes I wish that<br/>
was my mother and she&#39;d just shut her mouth, mind her own business and<br/>
keep her opinions to herself......<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really important for me to talk about this stuff (I know you know<br/>
that Heather) because otherwise I start to doubt myself and what I&#39;m<br/>
doing.  I even looked into a school for Zak when this was all happening.<br/>
It&#39;s an unschooling school like Sudbury but as a friend of mine pointed<br/>
out &quot;So you are going to pay $640 per month for Zak to do what he&#39;s<br/>
doing at home?&quot;  HMMMMMMMM....<br/>
