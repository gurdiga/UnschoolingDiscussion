                                    Farilitos<br/>
and Luminarias<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Christmas Eve in New Mexico is a<br/>
picturesque event rich in tradition and<br/>
cultural heritage. The flickering lights of<br/>
farolitos<br/>
   line the streets and sidewalks of homes<br/>
and churches throughout the Land of<br/>
Enchantment to celebrate the birth of the<br/>
   Christ child. For me, the small paper<br/>
lanterns symbolically welcome Baby Jesus into<br/>
the world, and into our hearts on this<br/>
   most holy of all nights.<br/>
<br/>
   Farolitos is the Spanish word for little<br/>
lanterns. In the sixteenth century, small<br/>
bonfires called luminarias were burned<br/>
   alongside the roads and churchyards to<br/>
commemorate Christs birth and to guide<br/>
people to Midnight Mass the final night of<br/>
   Las Posadas.<br/>
<br/>
   By the early nineteenth century, US<br/>
settlers brought beautiful<br/>
   Chinese lanterns to hang from their<br/>
doorways instead of building<br/>
   bonfires. But the Chinese lanterns were<br/>
too expensive so people<br/>
   began to make small paper lanterns out of<br/>
paper sacks as an<br/>
   alternative.<br/>
<br/>
   The night of Las Posadas (Spanish word<br/>
meaning lodging or inn) is a<br/>
   festive celebration that was first<br/>
introduced to the Mexican Indians<br/>
   by European missionaries by reenacting the<br/>
story of Mary and<br/>
   Josephs search for lodging in Bethlehem<br/>
in a series of nine<br/>
   consecutive nights, beginning<br/>
<br/>
   December 16th. Each night a group of<br/>
carolers would go from house to house and<br/>
sing a song in Spanish pleading for food<br/>
   and shelter. Some homes would turn them<br/>
away, but others would invite them in and<br/>
offer posole, red and green chile<br/>
   stews, Christmas Eve tamales, biscoshitos,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
   These plays originally were conducted in<br/>
the churches but eventually moved into<br/>
peoples homes. Now Las Posadas is<br/>
   done in just one evening; Christmas Eve.<br/>
After the festivities are complete, everyone<br/>
then goes to Christmas Mass, and<br/>
   the luminarias and farolitos show the way.<br/>
<br/>
   Farolitos are easy to make and add beauty<br/>
and tradition to your Christmas celebration.<br/>
All you need are: paper sacks,<br/>
   sand, and votive candles. If the wind is<br/>
blowing hard the night you put them out,<br/>
place a small brick or rocks inside the bag<br/>
   to weight it down. Line the bags in a row<br/>
on the edges of your sidewalks and driveways.<br/>
<br/>
   A modern variation of these decorations<br/>
are electric lights in bags and you can find<br/>
them<br/>
   in many stores. However, personally I<br/>
think the homemade ones are the prettiest.<br/>
   Albuquerques Old Town has farolitos lined<br/>
all down its streets on Christmas Eve, as do<br/>
   other towns like Santa Fe, Taos and Las<br/>
Cruces. They even have bus tours so that the<br/>
   area isnt as congested with traffic.<br/>
<br/>
   You can of course get together with others<br/>
in your community and set up your own<br/>
   farolitos display in your neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
   There are ways to make your farolitos more<br/>
decorative. Stencil Christmas patterns onto<br/>
   the front of your bags, and using an<br/>
ex-acto knife, cut out the patterns, then<br/>
tape colored<br/>
   crepe paper inside the bags.<br/>
<br/>
   A final note. People in Albuquerque tend<br/>
to call the paper bag lanterns, luminarias,<br/>
but<br/>
   natives from Santa Fe insist the correct<br/>
term is farolitos. As I mentioned earlier, a<br/>
true<br/>
   luminaria is a series of small bonfires<br/>
lining the roads. Whatever you choose to call<br/>
them is up to you. But do think about<br/>
   setting some out this Christmas and add a<br/>
new tradition to your holidays no matter<br/>
where you live.<br/>
