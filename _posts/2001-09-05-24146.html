<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432592407">And some of you thought shouting or guns were controversial. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; By the way....the television is somewhat of a problem. My husband<br/>
&gt; will not let me take it out of the house, which is what I want to do!<br/>
&gt; My son CAN sit in front of that thing for hours if I were to let him<br/>
&gt; and I almost feel he has been doing just that for the past couple<br/>
&gt; days as a silent protest against my method of &quot;instruction.&quot; He did<br/>
&gt; not watch much television over the summer and now he cannot seem to<br/>
&gt; be able to shut it off. Of course, it may be that all of his<br/>
&gt; neighborhood friends have gone off to school. For the time being<br/>
&gt; should I plan lots of activity in the home...experiments, read<br/>
&gt; outloud time, playing games, etc...my car is broken down and won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; ready for a least a week. Some unschoolers believe that I should just<br/>
&gt; let boredom take it&#39;s toll and let the kids lead the activity when<br/>
&gt; they are ready.  Any thoughts on this??????<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. (Pauses to note no one is shocked that I have thoughts on this,<br/>
considers becoming less predictable. Nah. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
If he has options and he knows what they are specifically and in general<br/>
(plenty of games, art supplies, Mom willing to drop a lot of things to help<br/>
him with projects, websites, cooking, Legos, a fall garden, a small business<br/>
of walking the neighbors dogs at mid-day while they&#39;re at work, activities<br/>
with other homeschoolers, Scouts, karate, soccer (dependent on the car of<br/>
course), AND anything he might think up on his own -- he will be able to<br/>
make a good and valuable CHOICE: do I want to watch TV, or do I NOT want to<br/>
watch TV?<br/>
<br/>
At that point, whatever he decides is what&#39;s right for him. He may be one of<br/>
those people who gravitates to TV when bored (my husband is). He may be one<br/>
of those people who will ONLY watch TV when compelled by the program (I am<br/>
-- the LAST thing I&#39;m likely to do when bored is sit still, I am twitchy and<br/>
have to move around, usually vacuuming &lt;g&gt; See, it could be a lot worse,<br/>
your son could turn to some freakish hobby like cleaning, and what would the<br/>
neighbors think? ;)<br/>
<br/>
But really, if he is watching TV because he&#39;s interested, that&#39;s great,<br/>
that&#39;s unschooling. If he is watching TV because he&#39;s bored, make sure that<br/>
the boredom is &quot;not your fault&quot; (i.e, that there is plenty of<br/>
usually-interesting-to-him things to do if he wants to, and that he knows<br/>
this) and still let him decide. It&#39;s likely his way to unwind, let his brain<br/>
reorganize itself and just, well to be a Valley girl, veg.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689326283">Rachel, I think watching with is the best.  That way I can use it as a<br/>
springboard for conversation.  But one time my kids were watching the<br/>
Simpsons, I was in the room, and this man exploded, really violent and<br/>
bloody and degrading, and all my kids made a collective gasp, and turned<br/>
it off and discussed why it was wrong together.  I said a few things<br/>
about it, but realized that they were figuring all this out on their own.<br/>
 I really respect them and admire them for that.  I have not noticed them<br/>
wanting to watch the Simpsons since then.  They like the humor, but did<br/>
not find that funny.  The way I see it is, if I control my children&#39;s<br/>
television when I&#39;m there then when I&#39;m not they will just watch what<br/>
they want anyway, so it is better to let them set their boundaries now<br/>
rather than try and do it when they&#39;re adults on their own with no<br/>
knowledge of how to set their own boundaries.  Of course, even such a<br/>
sick display can be a springboard of, what kind of message is the<br/>
producer of this show sending, except to say, hey, this is funny because<br/>
we are mocking American culture which revels in blood and gore in film. <br/>
The only thing I said was, The reason I don&#39;t like watching the Simpsons<br/>
is because it is unpredictable, and you never know when they&#39;re going to<br/>
show something like this, and also because it is a cartoon with people<br/>
with baby-like facial features which  attracts children&#39;s attention, but<br/>
with adult-style sarcasm.  In the past, the kids would change the channel<br/>
when the Itchy and Scratchy show was coming on, which they also figured<br/>
out on their own that they didn&#39;t want to see.  Years ago, I refused to<br/>
let them watch the Simpsons, but my husband would watch it, so they would<br/>
too.  But now it is on daily on Fox.  I have relaxed a lot when it comes<br/>
to television, as on many things over the years that I once believed<br/>
strongly I should control, simply because I found myself in a losing<br/>
battle.  But now I am seeing this as a blessing, because it freed up my<br/>
family to make more choices and matured me into a less controlling<br/>
person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269438930">Thanks for all the responses, flox. I feel better when I have a plan,<br/>
and with  a bit of rearranging, the  living room now has a toy shelf<br/>
near the tv. It was great, today - he played with his toys, watched some<br/>
tv, then decided it was time to turn it off  and go ride his bike!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524910353">For years I tried to keep my kids from watching tv.  I thought tv was<br/>
bad.  Especially the shows that made me mad.  So, if my kids liked those<br/>
shows, they would watch behind my back.  Problem solved.=}<br/>
On a serious note, here are some things we did.  First, I accepted that I<br/>
could not change that they were going to watch things I did not want them<br/>
to.  Second, I quit enforcing rules.  Third, we all sat down and talked<br/>
about how we felt and what we all wanted.  As a family we agreed for the<br/>
kids to watch tv or videos only after 3pm on Mondays, Thursdays and<br/>
Fridays, but all day on the other days if they wanted.  (I won&#39;t go into<br/>
the reasons why I thought they were watching too much during the earlier<br/>
part of the day.)  We wrote it all down in a book and signed it. <br/>
Finally, if something comes on tv that I dislike, I say so and why and it<br/>
usually starts a discussion.<br/>
I think if I had a problem with my son watching too much, I would talk<br/>
with him to find out what his reasons are, what the thinking is behind<br/>
the behavior.  Then I would accept his reasoning as valid.  That in<br/>
itself might open up all sorts of possible solutions.  If it bothers you,<br/>
I would give information that describes why you think the behavior is<br/>
negative, and describe your feelings as to how the behavior affects you. <br/>
Then you could ask him to help you find a mutually agreeable solution. <br/>
Another thing you can do is, when he is watching a show, mention an<br/>
alternative thing that is available after the show.  That way he has time<br/>
to think about it and choose to do it in his own time.  I have a son who<br/>
fixates on things and the only way I can get through to him is if when I<br/>
interrupt him I say, &quot;Can I have five minutes of your time?&quot;   If after<br/>
talking, you still can&#39;t agree, then maybe acceptance is the answer.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some of the PBS kids&#39; shows are continuations.  Redwall, I&#39;m not sure about <br/>
others.  Arthur maybe, to some extent?   <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable, only broadcast (our TVs are mostly monitors for videos, <br/>
DVDs and video games), but it seems that some of the best stuff for kids is <br/>
on during  the day, and after 3:00 it goes downhill.<br/>
<br/>
Unless those three days are scheduled park days or there are <br/>
outside-the-house activities, that seems to me really arbitrary.  There&#39;s <br/>
nothing inherently different about a Tuesday.  If TV&#39;s bad one day it won&#39;t <br/>
be less bad on a different day, will it?  If TV is not inherently bad, why <br/>
have the TV-free hours?  <br/>
<br/>
If as a family kids agreed to limited TV viewing, was that a compromise <br/>
between a worse limitation to be imposed by parents?  A sacrifice to appease <br/>
the parents?<br/>
<br/>
When I need to talk to a TV-involved kid, I wait until the show&#39;s over or a <br/>
commercial, or I might ask quickly if it&#39;s something they&#39;ve already seen.  <br/>
More often, it&#39;s a game or video they can pause.   Interrupting a story is <br/>
like tearing some pages out of someone&#39;s book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408511931">&quot;If TV is not inherently bad, why <br/>
have the TV-free hours?&quot;  That&#39;s a good question.  I understand your<br/>
point, it does seem very restrictive.  It was a compromise we came to<br/>
since my husband didn&#39;t want the kids watching tv all day.  Regardless of<br/>
his reasons, it did cause us to feel like not everyone was happy. <br/>
Something that made us all happy was to ensure watching it after 3:00,<br/>
since that is when all the shows are on that the kids like best, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean watching it all day.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;was that a compromise <br/>
between a worse limitation to be imposed by parents?  A sacrifice to<br/>
appease <br/>
the parents?&quot;<br/>
I try to listen to why if they want to do something when I think they<br/>
should be doing something else, even tv at off times.  The truth is,<br/>
these problem-solving meetings we have help every one to feel listened to<br/>
because all feelings and thoughts are considered in the decision.  I<br/>
don&#39;t enforce it.  It is an agreement.  The children agreed to it because<br/>
they understand the reasons and think it is a fair agreement.  They<br/>
actually came up with it.  They don&#39;t always stick with it, but do for<br/>
the most part.  Even so, the reason is just that their dad thinks tv<br/>
during the day is a waste of time when they should be working on<br/>
something, and I don&#39;t agree with his mindset at all.  That&#39;s why we talk<br/>
about solutions, because we&#39;re not willing to kick my husband out:]<br/>
