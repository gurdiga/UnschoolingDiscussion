<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089754905">Just a little bit about the wonderful island that we live on: Corfu.<br/>
One of the seven Ionian islands between the Greek mainland and Italy.  It is a beautiful island covered with olive trees.<br/>
My family and I moved here a year ago, from South Africa, for a total change in lifestyle. My husband now runs holiday apartments (total of 48 beds). The summer season runs from May to October and in the winter months he does maintanence on the property and we take a visit back to SA.  A very simple and extremely pleasurable lifestyle.<br/>
You can see more about where we live at www.paradise-village.com<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all those that posted book lists - I have been very busy at ebay and half.com looking to purchase.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>

  &gt;Corfu sounds like an interesting place! Tell us about it?<br/>
<br/>
  Isn&#39;t that where Gerald Durrell (sp?) spent his childhood?<br/>
