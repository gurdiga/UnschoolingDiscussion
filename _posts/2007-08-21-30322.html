<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585527132">I gave Holly a dress last week that I&#39;ve had since I was a teen.   <br/>
It&#39;s very short, and she has worn it over jeans.<br/>
<br/>
While I was out of town she took a photo of herself in it, and then  <br/>
made it a kind of changing-colors show with photoshop.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not the expensive professional photoshop, it&#39;s Photoshop  <br/>
Elements 2.0 (they&#39;re up to 4. or 5. now), and it cost less than $100  <br/>
even when we got it a few years back.<br/>
<br/>
If it weren&#39;t for MySpace, Holly probably wouldn&#39;t have learned to do  <br/>
so many cool things with images and html.<br/>
Just playing around has given her lots of opportunity to learn things  <br/>
she&#39;ll be able to use real-life.<br/>

  That&#39;s really cool! I&#39;ll show it to Tamzin when she gets home (she&#39;s at a friend&#39;s house making fondue for dinner).<br/>
