 </span></blockquote>I had a couple of people ask about middle school age activities. Follow the kids is the best idea I can give you.<br/>
<br/>
Here were some things that we did back a few years.<br/>
<br/>
Listened to Gary Paulsen&#39;s book &quot;Hatchet&quot; on tape while traveling to a living history museum; after that, the kids were interested in getting other books by him for them to read.<br/>
<br/>
We use LOTS of books on tape --- they are great starting points for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Living history museums are great --- Saint Marie Among the Iroquois is up in Syracuse. Across from that is an old Salt Mine (that takes only about 10-15 minutes to go through).<br/>
<br/>
One of the kids loves creating games with playing pieces (made of Sculpey); both the kids went through a stage (after playing with the different board/playing piece settings on Chessmaster 5000) where they were working on their own chessboard/playing pieces tailored to their own interests/personalities.<br/>
<br/>
We use movies, live theater shows, different productions of the same show sometimes to enjoy and then make comparisons among the different performances. (We&#39;ve also done this same thing with books when they were younger. There are so many versions of &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; and &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; --- one of the &quot;Pigs&quot; ones is even told from the wolf&#39;s point of view. This is a fun thing to do as a family.)<br/>
<br/>
At one point, one of the kids was very into building machines --- a catapult, a trebochet, candy dispenser for m&ms, small race car; also designing/bulding forts and boats.<br/>
<br/>
Both kids have made artwork (using computer) for t-shirts.<br/>
<br/>
Astronomy (borrowing a telescope), rocketry, geology (exploration of creek bed), etc.<br/>
<br/>
Chemistry sets are fun.<br/>
<br/>
Theater makeup is great for exploration.<br/>
<br/>
Friendship bracelets, tie-dying, crochet, etc.<br/>
<br/>
HTH.<br/>
