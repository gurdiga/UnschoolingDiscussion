<div id="ygrps-yiv-503273561">(I thought it would be fun to start a thread called &quot;13 Things We Learned from...&quot; and then <br/>
choose a topic, offer one or two things - numbered - and let others contribute until we hit <br/>
13. Then someone can start another thread for another topic. I realized recently that we <br/>
are learning &quot;non-traditional&quot; stuff from &quot;non-traditional&quot; sources and it seems important <br/>
for me to keep track of the wonderful benefits our life is giving us... especially after that <br/>
trip to college admissions. &lt;beg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Playing cards with my kids:<br/>
<br/>
1. That the best games allow us to break/change/modify the rules for more complexity.<br/>
<br/>
2. There&#39;s a big difference between games that rely on chance and those that rely on <br/>
stratregy... and we all tend toward the strategy games as being more satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old now works to make up games that involve more than chance to make them <br/>
&quot;harder.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else?<br/>

3.  Math -- playing War requires you to know which numbers are larger and which are smaller.  He also quickly figured out that if I had two Aces, it meant he had two as well, or the one/three distribution.<br/>
 <br/>
4.  Also that it&#39;s really hard to &#39;throw&#39; a game of chance. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
