Children are people we should be spending a lot of time talking to,<br/>
listening to and helping because they&#39;re new here.  Instead it&#39;s standard<br/>
operating procedure to be short with them, shush them and limit them.  <br/>
We make them small.   <br/>
-------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve watched Mork and Mindy (the first season is on DVD now) and Henry <br/>
V, and this Deb&#39;s quote above reminded me of both.  Mork needs lots of <br/>
feedback about how to act, because he just got here (in the story, at that point, I <br/>
mean), and the feedback he gets from people who know he&#39;s alien is much kinder <br/>
than from those who have no idea.    And from Henry V, I&#39;m reminded that &quot;to <br/>
enlarge&quot; used to mean &quot;to set free,&quot; as from prison.  We still have &quot;at <br/>
large,&quot; but the king says &quot;We will yet enlarge that man who railed against our <br/>
person. . .&quot;  [WAIT.  Google will quote it for me]:<br/>
<br/>
. . .Uncle of Exeter, <br/>
Enlarge the man committed yesterday<br/>
    That railed against our person. We consider<br/>
    It was the heat of wine that set him on,<br/>
    And on his more advice we pardon him.. ..<br/>
                                    [. . .highest quality blah blah blah. . .]<br/>
We&#39;ll yet enlarge that man,<br/>
    Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care<br/>
    And tender preservation of our person<br/>
    Would have him punished.<br/>
<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
When we make our children small we also imprison them in an unhappy childhood.<br/>
We can enlarge them in more ways than one.<br/>
<br/>
The decisions Keith and I have made over the years have enlarged us too.  We <br/>
are free from the rule making and enforcing treadmill so many parents are on.  <br/>
We are free from the frustration and alienation the larger culture would <br/>
swear MUST come with teenagers, that they think is natural with teens.<br/>
<br/>
We are freer and we are bigger people, and our relationships are freer and <br/>
bigger two.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you commented on this.  When my kids were two years old, I <br/>
kept waiting for the &quot;terrible two&#39;s&quot; which everyone assured me were <br/>
just a forerunner of the &quot;terrible teens&quot;.  The &quot;terrible two&#39;s&quot; <br/>
never materialized, and neither did the &quot;terrible teens&quot;.  I loved <br/>
having a two-year old and I love having teens.<br/>
<br/>
My 19-year old will spontaneously hug me, and tell me I&#39;m her <br/>
favorite person in the world; my 15-year old asks me to go shopping <br/>
with her (which, I&#39;m told, is unheard of among parents of teen <br/>
girls...); and my 12-year old will tell me, with great enthusiasm <br/>
(picture a lanky pre-teen whirling and jumping around the kitchen) <br/>
and in great detail &lt;g&gt;, about his improving skills in playing <br/>
Budokai 3, before he calls his friends to give them the good news.<br/>

My story is not quite as all-out positive as yours, but it makes a good <br/>
cautionary tale.<br/>
<br/>
When my extra-cute son was 18 months old, my mom started telling me how <br/>
&quot;terrible&quot; I had been at that age.  So, being a worrier, I started to <br/>
worry about my son going through a terrible phase.  Right before he <br/>
turned three he had some symptoms that kind of matched the classic <br/>
&quot;terrible two&quot; stage.  These only lasted a few weeks.  I waited and <br/>
worried for 17 months before this happened.  It was SOOO ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
The teen years are a few years away for us.  I try not to worry.  :-)<br/>
