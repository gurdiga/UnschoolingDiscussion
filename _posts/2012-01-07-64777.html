<div id="ygrps-yiv-755172578">I have felt this way before, not necessarily in regards to my children, but rather certain situations in life. I found some relief with supplements. BACH remedies (start with Rescue Remedy and find two to three others that are YOU) were helpful for me as were B vitamins, magnesium and kava kava. What it boiled down to for me, was having too much stress in another area (husband usually, money issues etc) that crept into my relationship with my children. Make sure you are getting sunlight, exercise and plenty of sleep and destress your life as much as you can.  The reality  is, that your relationship with your daughter is  something you don&#39;t want to miss out on, and time flies by quickly!<br/>
