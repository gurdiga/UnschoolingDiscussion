<div id="ygrps-yiv-252295568">We&#39;ve been getting them for several months, now.  C-C (6yo) really likes the <br/>
find-a-word ones.  They have all different levels of puzzles, so the ones <br/>
she can&#39;t &quot;solve&quot; we save them for next year or so...( like the crosswords ) <br/>
   They do have hidden pictures in them, too.<br/>

 &gt; Wowser! We get them too.  They are conveniently delivered to our<br/>
 &gt; mailbox each month--like a book club subscription.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   Hi Diana!  thanks for posting this for everyone.  It doesn&#39;t appear<br/>
that they have a website which really surprises me.  How long have<br/>
you been getting them and how old are your kids that use them?  I was<br/>
hesitant to get them for Sterling since he&#39;s only 3 yo but figured i<br/>
can always cancel if there wasn&#39;t enough for his skill level yet.<br/>
He&#39;s always liked finding hidden pictures.  we&#39;ve gotten the &quot;I spy&quot;<br/>
series from the library a few times so figured he&#39;d like the<br/>
highlights hidden pictures.  i found there is quite a nice mix of<br/>
things he can do as well as many that are far too advanced for him<br/>
yet.  but that&#39;s okay, the challenge is there when he is ready and he<br/>
has already shocked me with some that i expected him to ignore...<br/>
like the &quot;find-a-word&quot;.<br/>
