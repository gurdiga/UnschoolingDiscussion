<div id="ygrps-yiv-754776415">But don&#39;t worry. It will be painless! :-)<br/>
<br/>
2 simple steps.<br/>
<br/>
1) Click on a link in a message. It will look like:<br/>
<br/>
Subject: Google Email Verification<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Welcome to Google Accounts.  To activate your account and verify  <br/>
&gt; your e-mail<br/>
&gt; address, please click on the following link:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>2) After you create your account, *IF* you don&#39;t want individual  <br/>
emails, if the account link doesn&#39;t take you to your groups page, you  <br/>
will need one more step. Go to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/">http://groups.google.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Click on Manage My Subscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s it!<br/>
<br/>
Why move?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has tried searching the archives of a Yahoo group knows  <br/>
what an enormous pain in the tuchus it can be. There may be over  <br/>
110,000 posts in the UnschoolingDiscussion archive, but it takes time  <br/>
and dedication to get anything out of them. :-/<br/>
<br/>
Google has created groups with actual searchable archives. Despite it  <br/>
being Beta it has some very nifty features and we&#39;re going to be  <br/>
moving the group there to take advantage of them.<br/>
<br/>
For those who never visit the posts at the web, the email delivery  <br/>
will be exactly the same. Just as with Yahoo, Google sends out  <br/>
individual emails, digests or you can opt for no mail and read at the  <br/>
website. Google also offers a summary as an option.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest changes are at the website.<br/>
<br/>
* No more picture ads :-) (Just Google text ads which won&#39;t slow down  <br/>
the loading of pages.)<br/>
<br/>
* Posts are displayed like a message board. (Either titles only or  <br/>
titles with the first few lines.) Replies appear beneath the original  <br/>
post so it&#39;s easy to skip topics that don&#39;t interest you.<br/>
<br/>
* Sort posts by original posting date or most recent reply.<br/>
<br/>
* Mark topics that interest you and display only those.<br/>
<br/>
* Rate posts up to 5 stars you think were especially helpful! :-)<br/>
<br/>
* Get an email alert when someone replies to a topic.<br/>
<br/>
* RSS feeds. Don&#39;t be scared! It&#39;s like a summary page of the most  <br/>
recent posts. Many newer browsers can keep track of your RSS  <br/>
subscriptions. You just click on the subscription name and it will  <br/>
display summaries of the most recent (15, 50, 100) posts. You can  <br/>
also have GoogleReader do that (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/reader/things/">http://www.google.com/reader/things/</a> <br/>
intro).<br/>

Also, when will this switch take place?<br/>

conversation will move over ss soon as Google approves the membership  <br/>
list. Adding 2000+ members all at once sent up some red flags and a  <br/>
live person needs to approve it.<br/>
