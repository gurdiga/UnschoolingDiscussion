    I&#39;ve read some on rabbits but I haven&#39;t come across how to litter train<br/>
them. Could you please give me some tips? Book recommendation for this?<br/>
We&#39;ve only had him for a few weeks. He had just been weaned. TIA!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889753208">Landon found all of the information on the web. Try google.com search engine <br/>
and you will find TONS of resources.  I googled &quot;Litter training a rabbit&quot; and <br/>
this is the first result that came back<br/>
