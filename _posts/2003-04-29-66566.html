<div id="ygrps-yiv-32337012">Robby was so pleased yesterday, when I came over and watched him play <br/>
some weird computer game starring Ed, Edd, and Eddie, and asking him <br/>
questions about it and being interested in what he was doing. It was <br/>
a new experience for both him and me: Mom? Not only letting him play, <br/>
but getting into it a bit? <br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do: ask him about what he&#39;s doing. What <br/>
does he like about it? How many levels has he mastered? <br/>
<br/>
I just got tired of being mildly irritated at my kids all the <br/>
time. &quot;No, you can&#39;t play computer right now. Read this book.&quot; The <br/>
irritating part being when he&#39;d roll his eyes, heave a sigh, and <br/>
settle in to read My Required Reading. Time to accept them and watch <br/>
them without judging. <br/>
<br/>
At one point last night, I got a little panicked. &quot;How will they <br/>
learn history?&quot; LOL isn&#39;t that stupid? Math isn&#39;t a fear for me <br/>
anymore, but I want them (gulp) to know about America&#39;s roots. Why do <br/>
we have the system of gov&#39;t that we do? Why? Ultimately my goal is <br/>
for my kids to think for themselves, do for themselves, with <br/>
confidence and cheer. Do they HAVE to have history for that? I know <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
I put a coin in my mental bank, for having that thought! hee<br/>

<br/>
Your post made me see how silly my worrying about math had been.  I don&#39;t <br/>
worry at all about History.  We live just outside DC and my children have <br/>
always been exposed to politics from the inside (sometimes wondering if <br/>
that&#39;s a really good thing) and there is tons of history on the East Coast <br/>
and it&#39;s basically just a way of life for us.  I&#39;ve never worried about them <br/>
knowing how the government works, we just experience it.  We love the <br/>
battlefields and Williamsburg and Boston and Atlanta and so many places...<br/>
<br/>
So... there is no need to worry about things, it will unfold and just be a <br/>
part of life, not something to try to find in the journey but to accept when <br/>
it is around.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your post, isn&#39;t it odd how one person is worried about one part <br/>
of life while another finds it a breeze but has a hard time with something <br/>
completely different?<br/>
<br/>
It helps to &quot;hear&quot; about others journeys and how you feel/do/accept/change.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing with me.<br/>

<br/>
The Eddie Izzard DVD lives here now.  We bought one.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share it with a longtime friend.  He has a son who&#39;s seven or <br/>
eight, and he asked if Josh could watch it.  I said sure, but the guy uses <br/>
the word &quot;Fuck.&quot;   So Josh couldn&#39;t watch it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids can.  And the discussions which have ensued, the &quot;dots which have <br/>
been connected,&quot; the facets added to things they already had some ideas about <br/>
are HUGE.  More information than most kids ever get out of the purely best <br/>
day of school in their lives my kids could get out of this one two-hour <br/>
comedy routine.<br/>
<br/>
It only could happen because I was interested (Marty kept telling me I would <br/>
really like Eddie Izzard, and Marty had only heard quotes from other kids who <br/>
had seen it), because I was not freaked out about them hearing &quot;fuck.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If I eliminate that word, I limit them to input of people who also eliminate <br/>
that word.  If I shelter them from a movie that might have that word, they <br/>
miss a lot of ideas and connections.  <br/>
<br/>
So when people say &quot;How do your kids know so much? How have they learned all <br/>
this history?&quot; I just say they have access to everything and they make <br/>
connections all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend.  (Kind of former friend now, because she&#39;s a teacher and <br/>
kept thinking I would come to my senses and send my kids to school.)   She <br/>
loved my chocolate chip cookies.  (Literally; I&#39;m off that cookie analogy and <br/>
onto real toll-house cookies with pecans now.)  She gushed and made a huge <br/>
deal.  HOW do you get them to do this?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, I use real butter, and...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well I&#39;m not going to use butter.  I&#39;m going to use margarine.  And then <br/>
what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then nothing.  Or, then I refrigerate the dough, actually, so they start to <br/>
cook before they melt out flat.  That part&#39;s important.  But to say &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>
going to use butter, but I want mine to be just like yours&quot;--that&#39;s a big <br/>
waste of my time and energy to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
If her principles and priorities say &quot;No butter,&quot; then that&#39;s fine.  She can <br/>
live a butter-free life and get cookie recipes elsewhere.  But for her to eat <br/>
my cookies and praise them is hypocritical.  And for her to reject my advice <br/>
because it goes against her principles is fine, but took five minutes off my <br/>
life energy! &lt;bwg&gt;  (I just ate another cookie and recovered.)<br/>
<br/>
So when people admire my kids&#39; attitudes and behavior and compassion and <br/>
humor and then they say &quot;How can I get my kids to be like your kids?&quot;   I <br/>
will invariably say &quot;lighten up, loosen up, let them watch TV, let them watch <br/>
movies.&quot;  And every once in a while someone comes along and says, &quot;Well, <br/>
yeah, as long as they&#39;re not R rated movies, there&#39;s no language, sex, <br/>
violence, guns, offensive views of women, and as long as the games they play <br/>
are wholesome and they turn it off by 10:00 and TV sucks so we&#39;re not going <br/>
to have one, but HOW can my kids be just like YOURS!???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very sad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s amazing how much my views on just this topic have loosened up, <br/>
even before finding unschooling. I never was a &quot;no R rated movies&quot; <br/>
type, but I had some strict guidelines when Abbie was littler, and <br/>
she was very good at knowing when a movie wasn&#39;t something I wanted <br/>
her to watch. But now that she&#39;s older, and we&#39;re watching whatever <br/>
strikes our fancy, together...well, the little kids come in and watch <br/>
with us if they want. It opens up SO MANY opportunities to talk about <br/>
things, apply our religious beliefs to things, or just laugh over <br/>
funny parts over again. The little kids know when something&#39;s going <br/>
to be too rough for them to watch, and hide their faces or leave the <br/>
room: Katie, the violent or ugly; Robby, sexy stuff. L<br/>
<br/>
I never heard of Eddie Izzard. What&#39;s it about?<br/>

known for dispelling the starry-eyed Galstonbury myths as fabrication. Upset a whole bunch of new-agers :-)<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;At one point last night, I got a little panicked. &quot;How will they learn history?&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, we were walking home from an Earthday fair and Jaiden(almost 5)was telling us all about gravity, and earths rotation, and the planets going on and on(some of it concepts, and discriptions much more indepth than I had ever gotten into with him), some of it I knew that he knew because we had talked about it before, but some of it I had no idea where he got it. I asked Jason if he had been talking to Jaiden about space recently, he said no, he was just as shocked as I was. So we asked Jaiden where he had heard this much about space, and to be honest I was thinking maybe the MAgic School Bus of something &#39;educational&#39; he poped up with &quot;Oh, learned it all from Ed, Edd, and Eddy. Double D is always talking about stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I was floored. I didn&#39;t know. I knew that he watched it, but it&#39;s on during the time I&#39;m trying to get Avery settled in for the night so I never watched it with him, and right now we don&#39;t have cable, so I will have to wait to learn all sorts of things from Double D.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share this with you, Heidi, especially, since you mentioned Ed, Edd, and Eddy. Who knows what words of wisdom Double D has to share on US history. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
What made me catch myself about the history thing is...I learned all <br/>
about the French/Indian wars of (can&#39;t remember the date, just barely <br/>
before 1776) at the tender young age of...42 (my current age, btw) by <br/>
reading...The Last of the Mohicans. There is history PACKED IN <br/>
EVERYTHING. All I have to do is let my kids get into what they&#39;re <br/>
into.<br/>
<br/>
thanks, Rebecca made my day! L<br/>

&quot;Oh, learned it all from Ed, Edd, and Eddy. Double D is always <br/>
