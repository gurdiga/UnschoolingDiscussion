<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580449980">Dear Robin,     <br/>
    Thanks for all the ideas! I&#39;ll look into them. I&#39;m reading &quot;The People&#39;s <br/>
History of the United States&quot; by Howard Zinn and &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot; by <br/>
James W. Loewen. Loewen was commissioned by the Smithsonian to evaluate <br/>
American history textbooks and this book is the result. His website is at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.uvm.edu/~jloewen/index.html">http://www.uvm.edu/~jloewen/index.html</a><br/>
        The way I&#39;m working with my son is that I do the reading and then <br/>
have discussions with him about what I&#39;ve learned. We also watch videos <br/>
together and discuss them and he&#39;s read a couple of historical novels. It&#39;s <br/>
working pretty well. We&#39;re also using the textbook that Oak Meadow sells, <br/>
it&#39;s not too bad and provides a structure and timeline for what we&#39;re <br/>
learning.<br/>
    By the way, your latest Mackenzie quote (&quot;I have magic in my mind&quot;) made <br/>
my day yesterday. It reminded me of my son, Michael at age 8 saying,&quot; I have <br/>
blank pages in my mind.&quot; This was at the point where he started asking for <br/>
more academic learning. It felt so good to me that he had the space inside to <br/>
learn and to come to it in his own way and time.   <br/>
