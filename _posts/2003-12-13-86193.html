<div id="ygrps-yiv-520726114">When I was researching the GED for my niece 5 or so years ago, there seemed <br/>
to be a lot of restrictions on who could take the test and it varied by state.  <br/>
It seems like in Arkansas and TN you couldn&#39;t just walk in and take the test. <br/>
 You had to sit through the Adult Ed courses first.  Some of that had to do <br/>
with not yet being 18, and the local school district getting to put their <br/>
finger in the pie.  I remember thinking that I would find someone in Missouri (I <br/>
know people) who would let us use their address so my son could just walk in and <br/>
take the test.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t looked since then, but I wonder if it&#39;s harder or easier to just go <br/>
in and take it.  I thought maybe I would try to take it just for the fun of <br/>
it, so I could see what it was all about, but I remember there being some <br/>
prohibition against high school graduates taking it.  I always wondered how they <br/>
would know about if a 40-something graduated from high school?<br/>
<br/>
In the years to come, I&#39;ll bet they&#39;ll know about EVERYONE&#39;s status, and that <br/>
scares the bejeepers out of me.<br/>

YES.<br/>
They&#39;ve just lately changed it in New Mexico. It used to be one had to be 18 <br/>
or their high school class (the one they would have been with if they had <br/>
started &quot;on schedule&quot; and not failed a year) had to have graduated.  That pretty <br/>
much meant 17 IF it&#39;s after May 25 or so.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of ours went to Arizona and got a GED when she was 15.  They didn&#39;t <br/>
even care that she had a  New Mexico address.  She registered there, though, <br/>
and then her mom drove her the four or so hours to Flagstaff, and she came back <br/>
&quot;graduated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Very strange.<br/>
<br/>
So here people register.  They can take a course or not.  If they fail they <br/>
can retake the sections they failed, once, without further fees (I THINK; I <br/>
could have misunderstood).<br/>

It has to do with the uppity young people in school who might just get fed up <br/>
and walk in and ace the test, thereby making the school look bad, and <br/>
depriving it of the their daily attendance funds.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s it.  We can&#39;t have <br/>
15 yo&#39;s getting the idea they can just get it all over with all at once and <br/>
then having them loose all over the place, you know?<br/>
