<div id="ygrps-yiv-693389824">Today on the &quot;E True Hollywodd&quot; channel there was a show <br/>
called, &quot;what Hollywood Taught us About Sex&quot;. My husband and I were <br/>
watching it, my 17 year old son was sitting at the computer that is <br/>
in our family room...he is my one child NOT remotely embarassed <br/>
about sex, he is almost too open if there is such a thing..LOL, some <br/>
things a mom just dosen&#39;t need to know..ha<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow..my 13 year old daughter came in and sat down while we were <br/>
watching the program. (The program was funny and showed clips from <br/>
movies, and then would go into &quot;What&quot; did we learn from this movie <br/>
about sex. Example..&quot;Fast times at Ridgemont High&quot;...we may have <br/>
learned not to &quot;do it&quot; in a baseball dug out.)She asked what we were <br/>
watching, I explained the concept of the program, and told her she <br/>
was more then welcome to watch if she felt like it, or I would go <br/>
into the other room with her and watch something with her <br/>
there...or, did she want to work the puzzle we started this morning? <br/>
<br/>
She said,&quot;I&#39;d like to watch it&quot;. She has seen several programs with <br/>
sexual conotation and she has two brothers who have been an open <br/>
book when it comes to questions.<br/>
<br/>
Something came up in the program about having a &quot;Orgasim&quot;. She ask <br/>
us to pause the Tivo, and then asked, &quot;What is a orgasim?&quot; I <br/>
jokingly looked at my husband and asked, &quot;Do you want to take this <br/>
one?&quot; He said, not really..laughing a little. <br/>
Then my son said, &quot;It&#39;s why people enjoy sex&quot;. Then she <br/>
said, &quot;oh&quot;...but what IS it? <br/>
<br/>
I stepped in at this point and explained it as best I could...I <br/>
asked her if she has ever had a spot on her body that itched REALLY <br/>
bad? She said, &quot;Yeah&quot; and then I said,&quot;when you finally itched it <br/>
didn&#39;t it feel good?&quot; &quot;Yeah&quot;...I said it&#39;s kinda like that. And that <br/>
it happens during sex to both a man and a women..or can happen. I <br/>
asked her if she wanted me to explain it further..she said, &quot;No, <br/>
Thanks Mom&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
She was most happy with the answer I gave her..my husband and son <br/>
were shocked at my explanation of a orgasim. My son said, &quot;Great <br/>
mom..now she will think if she has a itch she has had a orgasim !!!&quot; <br/>
We got to laughing about it later...my son said, &quot;Oh, I have a <br/>
itch..!!!! <br/>
<br/>
I tried to keep it simple and to the point, in terms I thought she <br/>
would understand...my husband and son have been laughing at me ever <br/>
since...LOL . They just whish that had thought of my <br/>
explaination !!! <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anybody else have this question asked of them? If so, what did you <br/>
say? <br/>
