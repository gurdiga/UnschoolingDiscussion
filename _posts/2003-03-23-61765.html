Dylan can recognize Rossini and Wagner almost instantly anywhere he hears<br/>
them and that started with Bugs Bunny.  Not just the pieces used in<br/>
cartoons but pieces from other works as well.<br/>
<br/>
Bugs Bunny led to Wagner, led to operas, led to Vikings, led to Valhalla,<br/>
led to Mythology, led to religion...<br/>
<br/>
The Simpsons bit (spoofing)  the Bill on Capital Hill  ( flag burners<br/>
have too much freedom)  led to the still ongoing discussions of flag<br/>
burning as freedom of speech, which led to discussions on political<br/>
protest which led to the ever popular discussions on civil disobedience,<br/>
which led to the reading of &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; by Thoreau, which led to<br/>
&quot;Walden.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those are a few examples I easily remember but there&#39;s been endless<br/>
learning from cartoons.   There have been so many connections to great<br/>
movies and literature and music.   I&#39;m always surprised to hear people<br/>
say they don&#39;t see value in cartoons.   Cartoons for the sake of humor<br/>
have been a delight to my son.   How do you measure the value of joy?  If<br/>
he never learned anything from them (which is impossible) but they made<br/>
him happy that would be enough.  They&#39;ve been an inspiration to Dylan,<br/>
who draws cartoons and is designing a set now for a claymation movie he<br/>
wants to make.   <br/>
(Spell check wants to change claymation to cremation, which is a little<br/>
creepy, a cremation movie.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350883583">My daughter, Ali LOVES cartoons as well. Her love affair started when she <br/>
about two. She used to watch an English claymation thing called Wallace and <br/>
Grommet. Her enjoyment of Looney Tunes, especially the WWII vintage, Tom <br/>
and Jerry etc. have provided some amazing conversations around history, <br/>
music, lifestyles, politics, society, fashion and much more. We also have a <br/>
wonderful time Sunday evenings reading the comics together. It&#39;s been an <br/>
interesting exercise for me to try to explain current political commentary <br/>
or some grownup concepts to her. She totally amazes me when we read Family <br/>
Circus and she *gets* all the stuff that the parents are going through. She <br/>
can see their perspective, which just amazes me.<br/>
I also like having all this humor in our house.<br/>
