 </span></blockquote>OH oh --- teaching versus learning.... I had something new (I think) to say <br/>
about that, believe it or not (thinking that we MUST have said everything <br/>
there was to say the last time this came up).<br/>
<br/>
HSC (HomeSchool Association of California) has new t-shirts for sale - we saw <br/>
them for the first time at the conference in Sacramento. And GUESS what they <br/>
say?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I never teach my pupils. I only attempt to provide the conditions in which <br/>
they can learn.&quot; <br/>

Nope --- not quoting Sandra Dodd, who wouldn&#39;t CALL her kids &quot;pupils&quot; anyway &lt;<br/>
G&gt;. This is Albert Einstein who felt it was important to make the distinction <br/>
between teaching and learning.<br/>

the last ones - she thought maybe the quote was too long...<br/>
<br/>
Rain and I suggested a Grateful Dead quote for next year, from &quot;Touch of<br/>
Gray&quot;  - &quot;Kid Can&#39;t Read at seventeen/The words he knows are all obscene<br/>
but/ It&#39;s all right....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she went for it.<br/>
