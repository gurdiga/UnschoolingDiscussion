&lt;&lt; My Shih Tzu once ate all the choclate decorations from the xmas <br/>
tree when he was 2. Apart from the unusual turds he was fine and <br/>
live until he was 15 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our dog has twice stolen foil-wrapped Christmas or Easter candy, and poops <br/>
foil lumps in regular-looking turds.   She&#39;s not a tiny dog, nor a giant one. <br/>
 Blue heeler, I can pick her up.<br/>
<br/>
Just because something CAN be poison to a dog or a person doesn&#39;t mean it <br/>
always is.  I have friends allergic to nuts.  Nuts are poison to some people. <br/>
 Strawberries are poison to some people.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feed my dog chocolate, but I don&#39;t freak out when she finds some or a <br/>
kid shares a candy bar with her out on a hike or something.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never had a dog die of anything but old age or getting hit by a car.<br/>
<br/>
As to birds and Teflon, birds are stuck in cages, and can&#39;t get away from <br/>
noxious fumes.  Many are  very small and die easily (coal mine evidence).  <br/>
