 </span></blockquote>I agree! Esp. after seeing this special on the topic the other night - think<br/>
it was on 60 minutes, I only caught a bit of it. But as usual, there was<br/>
some learned doctor telling parents &quot;If you don&#39;t get your child the MMR<br/>
vaccine, you are playing Russian Roulette with their life&quot;. What a bunch of<br/>
hooey. A friend of mine&#39;s daughter caught the measles, so a bunch of us<br/>
whose kids are not vaccinated took them over to her house for playdates -<br/>
swapped sippy cups and everything. Not a one of them came down with the<br/>
measles, much to our disappointment. Seems that there was not much we could<br/>
do so that our healthy, breastfed kids would actually contract this &quot;dread&quot;<br/>
disease (which my mom had without incident, as well as mumps and rubella).<br/>
Ditto with chickenpox - I&#39;ve tried to get natural immunity for my<br/>
son, but he just can&#39;t seem to catch it. I mean I&#39;m glad the vaccines are<br/>
available. If my child was immune-compromised or somehow at risk for serious<br/>
complications, I would probably be glad I had the choice to use them. But I<br/>
resent being forced or attempted to be guilted into using it for no good<br/>
purpose.<br/>
Note: I didn&#39;t see the whole 60 minutes segment, so I have no idea if this<br/>
one doctor&#39;s view was indicative of the whole. His line just bugged me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>exactly.  My son got measles from a child who was vaccinated.  He was<br/>
sick, yes.  But not nearly as sick as I am atm with bronchitis.  We tried<br/>
8 times to get him chickenpox before it took.  I had all of the childhood<br/>
diseases (and then the vaccinations, go figure).  And I was not a<br/>
&quot;healthy&quot; child, having had asthma from a very young age.  The vaccines<br/>
are wonderful for the nonhealthy kids.  And I know that even healthy<br/>
people died from these diseases at times.  But the risks we, as a<br/>
population, are taking in assuming that mass vaccination programs are the<br/>
best way to go are unknown.  I just read the new book _Flu_ about the<br/>
influenza epidemic of 1918, and one theory as to why it mainly killed the<br/>
young people in their 20s and 30s is that their had been a previous<br/>
pandemic in 1890 (I think) and the older people, who it would be assumed<br/>
would suffer from flu more than the young and healthy, had partial<br/>
immunity to that particular strain as the two strains appeared to be<br/>
related/similar.  I dunno.  Makes some sense to me.  I also know that the<br/>
less I teach (or rather, the fewer hours I spend on campus) any given<br/>
semester, the more and worse I get sick.  I assume it is because I don&#39;t<br/>
get multiple and smaller exposures to whatever is going around by not<br/>
being on campus.  I don&#39;t have a person in line behind me sneeze and get<br/>
exposed that way, which fires up my immune system.  Instead, some sick<br/>
student wanders into my office, coughs up a lung all over me, hands me a<br/>
paper covered with her germs, etc., and whammy.  I&#39;m sick two days later.  <br/>
I&#39;m glad we have vaccinations, but they are a double edged sword at the<br/>
same time and most people don&#39;t realize that.<br/>

&gt;Re: AAPS <br/>
&gt;  Votes to Oppose Vaccine Mandates.&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;FONT size=2&gt;Thought you folks might be interested in <br/>
&gt;the other <br/>
&gt;    side of the coin which I found when I picked it <br/>
&gt;up.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Verdana&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Liv:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I looked at the site and <br/>
&gt;thought it <br/>
&gt;  rather unusual that an accredited association of physicians would <br/>
&gt;have so many <br/>
&gt;  anecdotal reports. I asked a friend who is a physician if he knew <br/>
&gt;anything <br/>
&gt;  about this association as I had not heard of it before. Here is what <br/>
&gt;he <br/>
&gt;  said:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=Monaco&gt;&lt;TT&gt;Hi there,&lt;BR&gt;Jane Orient <br/>
&gt;runs AAPS, <br/>
&gt;  which is a libertarian/conservative political group&lt;BR&gt;to which <br/>
&gt;about 4500 (I <br/>
&gt;  believe) physicians belong. Associate membership of&lt;BR&gt;some kind is <br/>
&gt;available <br/>
&gt;  to laypeople as well. It is not a &quot;medical&quot; group in&lt;BR&gt;the common <br/>
&gt;meaning of <br/>
&gt;  the term. They focus almost solely on political&lt;BR&gt;issues. J Orient, <br/>
&gt;whom I <br/>
&gt;  previously respected and agreed with on many&lt;BR&gt;issues, has become a <br/>
&gt;strident <br/>
&gt;  critic of vaccines and vaccine&lt;BR&gt;policy. She accepts information <br/>
&gt;from <br/>
&gt;  anti-vaccine groups run by laypeople&lt;BR&gt;and features articles on her <br/>
&gt;website <br/>
&gt;  by notorious opponents of all&lt;BR&gt;vaccination. Why would a &quot;medical&quot; <br/>
&gt;group get <br/>
&gt;  its information this way, much&lt;BR&gt;less pass the same on to the <br/>
&gt;general public? <br/>
&gt;  You&#39;ll have to ask Jane. While&lt;BR&gt;I can forgive laypeople for being <br/>
&gt;confused <br/>
&gt;  by the science and rhetoric&lt;BR&gt;inherent in the vaccine issue, I am <br/>
&gt;afraid I <br/>
&gt;  cannot forgive a physician who&lt;BR&gt;puts her politics ahead of <br/>
&gt;science. Jane has <br/>
&gt;  made a real spectacle of herself&lt;BR&gt;on the healthfraud listserve <br/>
&gt;over the past <br/>
&gt;  year and a half, misquoting&lt;BR&gt;studies, alluding to studies of <br/>
&gt;different <br/>
&gt;  vaccines other than the one under&lt;BR&gt;discussion, and basically any <br/>
&gt;other kind <br/>
&gt;  of obtuse, disingenuous, sloppy and&lt;BR&gt;unscholarly behavior <br/>
&gt;imaginable. <br/>
&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is a terrible shame and another reason why I am so <br/>
&gt;angry at J <br/>
&gt;  Orient. Her&lt;BR&gt;credential as a physician gives her credibility in <br/>
&gt;the eyes of <br/>
&gt;  trusting and&lt;BR&gt;unsuspecting people. She has IMO wildly abused that <br/>
&gt;  trust.&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Monaco&gt;&lt;TT&gt;&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Monaco&gt;&lt;TT&gt;Hope this was of <br/>
&gt;interest.&lt;/TT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;<br/>
