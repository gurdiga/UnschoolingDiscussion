 </span></blockquote>I would surf the net and look up some of the sites that do birthdays and parties to go, or in a box, that kind of thing.  They are a great way to get inspiration and a lot of them have cute ideas about party projects or kits to order, that sort of thing.  Even if you do not order anything they are a great way to get ideas about what to do.  Also I know there are books on the subject as well, so check the library.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094383792">Hi Joshua, <br/>
                When my son was that age we had a fishing party... of course <br/>
he is very into that so it worked for us. We played that cheesy fishing game <br/>
but instead of a regular &quot;goodie&quot; bag they got fishing lures. They loved it <br/>
made them feel big. They also have small tackle boxes that they can put their <br/>
new lures and weights in:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-951952342">How about simple balsa wood airplanes they can then play with after making<br/>
them at the party? Or perhaps some sort of mousetrap<br/>
vehicle-building/competition?<br/>
These are things we have enjoyed in the past.<br/>

&gt; Hi all....<br/>
&gt; My oldest son&#39;s 8th B day party is coming up SOON.  (Next Thursday to be<br/>
&gt; exact) (Thursday works since most of his &quot;school&quot; friends go to the<br/>
waldorf<br/>
&gt; school and they take thursday afternoons off.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the past, my wife has taken on most of the actual planning and<br/>
organizing<br/>
&gt; that goes into having a fun party.  I have gotten as far as making sure<br/>
&gt; everyone is invited and deciding there will be a treasure hunt...  BUT, I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; still looking for cool ideas that are party proven to work for 8-9 year<br/>
old<br/>
&gt; boys....<br/>
&gt; Also, I am trying to think of an alternative to the standad &quot;goody bags&quot;<br/>
&gt; that have become standard fare around here.  Something like a little craft<br/>
&gt; project they can take home, or a simple game etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any input or hot www links would be appreciated<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; thanks,<br/>
&gt; Joshua<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-729774774">Hi Joshua,<br/>
               My daughter went to a boy&#39;s party last year that had a<br/>
construction theme. It was really cute. I know all of the stuff was ordered<br/>
off the web, although I don&#39;t know the sight. They had the kind of yellow<br/>
tape you&#39;d see at construction sights as streamers, a cake that looked like<br/>
a dirt road with plastic trucks on it, and they handed out hard hats and<br/>
little red flashers as favors. I&#39;m sure you could expand on the idea by<br/>
putting a bunch of trucks in a sandbox, reading books on trucks, etc.<br/>
Anyway, have fun!<br/>
Amy<br/>

                                I know you have received a lot of good ideas <br/>
for your son&#39;s birthday party.  Another good resource you can check into is <br/>
Donna Erickson&#39;s Prime Time books, both editions 1, and 2.  She has some <br/>
fantastic ideas that are all related to working with children--  some ideas <br/>
include making plastic out of gelatin, making rainsticks,  making items out <br/>
of bread clay, salt clay, etc... also, she has many ideas like making <br/>
windsocks,  tie-dying shirts, making games , and more.  You will find a <br/>
wealth of ideas, I&#39;m sure!  Hope you have a great party!!                       <br/>

<div><font size="2">I don&#39;t know if it would work for 8yo&#39;s although everyone (and 
it was a wide age range :-) ) at my dd&#39;s 4th last year enjoyed it, but I got 
little fairy cakes for them to decorate with the usual hundreds and thousands 
and stuff, instead of a big cake to blow out the candles on because she got that 
at Grandma&#39;s the next day.&nbsp; So they had that to take home or eat there, 
whichever, instead of the slice of birthday cake.&nbsp; The other thing we did 
was a &#39;treasure hunt,&#39; not with clues, we hid little chocolates all around the 
house for them to find, unfortunately, a couple of the girls were really 
competitive, so some kids didn&#39;t get many.&nbsp; The traditional pass the parcel 
and pin the tail on the donkey were ok, with prizes, also instead of the goody 
bag.&nbsp; This meant that we could choose appropriate things for each guest, as 
I said they were varied in age range from 3 to 11yo.&nbsp; I should give a 
mention to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.childfun.com">www.childfun.com</a> tons of stuff 
to do here, and tell Jenny I sent you :-)</font></div>
