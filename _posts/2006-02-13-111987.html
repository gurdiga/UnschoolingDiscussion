<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768243503">My son is developmentally delayed and has just now, at 11, decided that he<br/>
wants to play video games like his big brother. He loves to drive anything,<br/>
so he chose &quot;Need for Speed&quot; and enjoyed it for awhile, but it palled. He&#39;s<br/>
not really into racing; he&#39;d rather &quot;park&quot; beside one of the houses in the<br/>
game, pull out an old &quot;dead&quot; cellphone that my dh gave him, and make believe<br/>
that he&#39;s at his house in real life and he&#39;s talking to a friend about where<br/>
to go out to eat.<br/>
<br/>
He plays Animal Crossing for a few minutes at a time, but except for moving<br/>
furniture around in his house, he says it&#39;s not very much fun. I think he<br/>
mostly plays it because my older son does and so do his sister and I. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t like sports games, or Mario or anything with a timer.<br/>
<br/>
He says he wants a game where he can have a real life, but not too<br/>
complicated. Basically, I think he wants a house where he can rearrange the<br/>
furniture, a car he can drive places like restaurants and stores, and a few<br/>
people to interact with . I looked at the Sims series, but it&#39;s way too<br/>
advanced for him. He&#39;s 11, but developmentally delayed and very concrete and<br/>
rigid in his thinking. He also scares easily and doesn&#39;t like anything sad<br/>
or &quot;dark&quot;, like role-playing games or people dying.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27138396">My first thought was Sims or Sims 2.  In fact, it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
necessary for him to keep up with everything all that much... he could<br/>
even pause the game most of the time and just rearrange stuff.  Also,<br/>
in Sims (original) if you go to the &quot;Newbie&quot; house and do NOT finish<br/>
the tutorial, the people there don&#39;t have their needs drop very fast<br/>
at all... so it might be a good starting point.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s still too advanced, maybe there&#39;s a Maxis product made<br/>
specifically for children that he might like.  The only one I have is<br/>
SimTown, which lets you place houses and activate little &quot;easter eggs&quot;<br/>
but no rearranging of stuff inside.  Of course, it&#39;s way to simple to<br/>
keep my attention long... but may be something he might enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
The only other thing that occurred to me was there&#39;s probably some<br/>
Barbie something that might be close to what he&#39;d like if he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be offended by the logo (some kids would, others wouldn&#39;t care).  I<br/>
have no specific ideas in mind here, just thought that with all the<br/>
Barbie toys that might match that concept, there&#39;s almost got to be a<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one other thought.  Sims also has a console (PlayStation, etc.)<br/>
version out... actually two, Busting Out and Urbz.  It&#39;s possible that<br/>
they&#39;ve been simplified enough for the console that he might actually<br/>
be able to play those.  And seems to me there might have even been one<br/>
for the GameBoy or something which would be even simpler (though that<br/>
may have been a different game I&#39;m thinking about).<br/>
<br/>
Just a few thoughts.  Dunno if anything will help.  Do let us know<br/>
if/what you find.  :)<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The Simpsons has a driving game for X-box that does not have to be a<br/>
race at all, and is comical driving. Also the driver can get out and<br/>
interact with various characters and objects. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038548542">***My first thought was Sims or Sims 2.<br/>
   <br/>
  Mine too.  My (11)daughter really likes the play in those games.  She really likes roleplaying and also seeing what comes from her actions.<br/>
   <br/>
  Also on Sims and Sims 2 there are cheats you can put in so you can create as much as you want with as much money as you want.  Just google Sims cheats  or maybe gamefaq.com would have some.  My 8 year old dd really likes doing the cheats so she has a chance to play without running out of money.   Very fun! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Harvest Moon.  You can go in lots of houses.  Not rearrange  <br/>
furniture, but visit people.  In some games you have a horse to ride  <br/>
or can get one.  There are lots of walkthroughs online, and charts  <br/>
and pointers.   You could help him get established with some money  <br/>
and a horse and he could play really well from there.<br/>
<br/>
Putt Putt is about driving around town (but you&#39;re the car, and he  <br/>
visits other cars).   He can go into places, and get a little job,  <br/>
and it&#39;s pretty cute.  It&#39;s for computers and there are two or three  <br/>
of them, at least.<br/>
<br/>
Zoombinis (also for a computer) is more like going places and  <br/>
interacting.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking Things is more about interacting with owners of little shops  <br/>
in some ways.  There&#39;s a pet store, and a hat shop.  There are at  <br/>
least three Thinking Things.<br/>
<br/>
Used to be, and I don&#39;t know if they run on any new computers, three  <br/>
games that were quite like visitation, of a treehouse, of an  <br/>
underground game, of a neighboring back yard, and they were called  <br/>
Playroom, Treehouse and Backyard.  They were by Broderbund which is  <br/>
now defunct, and I don&#39;t know who owns the games now.<br/>
<br/>
People with younger kids might have more current ideas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>MY STREET for Playstation 2 is kinda like that.  It&#39;s a neighborhood and <br/>
there a bunch of kids that you play with (marbles, r/c racing, volleyball, <br/>
lawnmower), you can creat your own kid, change clothes, and that sorta thing, walk <br/>
around the &#39;hood and if you need money you do chores for people.  To play with <br/>
the boy who likes volleyball you have to go find his ball cuz the neighborhood <br/>
bully took it.  The whole game is to build up to take back the neighborhood <br/>
from the bully which you don&#39;t see until much later.  The mini games are pretty <br/>
easy and even if you don&#39;t win, you can do it over and over and walk the <br/>
streets and play on the playground and stuff.  It has a larger scope as well, it <br/>
was designed to be used online too if you ever wanted to.  My 8 and 4 year olds <br/>
like it for the walking and stuff and going to the toy shop to buy things like <br/>
marbles to play with the little girl who likes that game. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617757487">I tutor Autistic children on occasion from the time I was in college. One of<br/>
the games that we have found useful is the SIMs. You build your house,<br/>
arrange the house how you like and such. You can even choose different time<br/>
periods and additions.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are also a large range of realistic explore type computer games - One<br/>
is Manhole - well that one is based on Alice and Wonderland but it should<br/>
put you in the right direction. If you can&#39;t find any let me know and I will<br/>
dig my tutor box out and see what the other titles I have are - I know I<br/>
have one on Mars and another on Ireland oh also interactive travel sites<br/>
that you can explore areas around the world might interest him too.<br/>
