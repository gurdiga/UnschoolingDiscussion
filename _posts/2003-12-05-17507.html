<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196229865">What wisdom is here!! That statement, Joyce is so very true. <br/>
My daughter&#39;s friend, aged 13 spent yesterday w/ us. I asked her what she was learning in school.<br/>
She said she was learning about Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. Well, I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t surprise anyone that she was not taught of US involvement w/ any of those countries prior to 9/11.<br/>
She was taught that the attack was financed by Osama Bin Laden and &quot;other people in Iraq.&quot;<br/>
Blatantly false.<br/>
<br/>
Schools are not about education...they are mental clones.<br/>

 &quot;Today we have a Democracy of disinterested,<br/>
      non-participatory, well fed peasants, and a<br/>
      small minority of ruling elites. Change any<br/>
      one of those components, and there is hope for<br/>
      the future. Allow the downward spiral of<br/>
      American Democracy to continue and our society<br/>
      will degenerate into a feudal system.&quot;<br/>
