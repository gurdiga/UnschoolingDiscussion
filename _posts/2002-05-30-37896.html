<br/>
Thanks for your additional thoughts on ADD. I, like<br/>
you, don&#39;t deny its existence ... just would rather<br/>
accentuate the positives of ADD traits rather than the<br/>
limitations. Sounds like your family does much the<br/>
same thing. <br/>
<br/>
I did not, however, know that Krispy Kremes made<br/>
diabetics sweaty :) I appreciated the analogy, it just<br/>
made me chuckle a little bit, the image of someone<br/>
scarfing donuts and sweating. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks also for the link to systems goddess. By the<br/>
way, I have a fancy planner, too. It makes a great<br/>
coaster for my coffee cup :)<br/>

coasters and our beautiful desktop calendars are *doodle pads!<br/>

they do have that effect on him!<br/>
