<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458563078">&lt;&lt;schools by their design are to educate the masses and get them ready for <br/>
factory work, not hold the community together. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have to comment on this.  I realize this is becoming one of the mainstays <br/>
of homeschool rhetoric, and from a myopic NYC point of view it must be true.  <br/>
I read it in a Gatto book so It Must Be True (a Garfield joke...).<br/>
<br/>
During the industrial revolution and the huge influx of immigration from <br/>
Europe and the Ellis Island days, yes--in that small part of the country, we <br/>
are told, schools wanted to socialize people (teaching them English was NOT a <br/>
bad thing, y&#39;know, if they were speaking 35 different European languages) and <br/>
prepare them for jobs (NOT a bad thing, y&#39;know, as there was no such thing as <br/>
welfare and few of them could afford to get on a train and find some farmland <br/>
out where they couldn&#39;t speak English).   The oversimplification that schools <br/>
were preparing factory workers for meanness somehow grates on me.<br/>
<br/>
But much beyond that, my parents and grandparents and great-blah-blah-blahs <br/>
never ever saw Ellis Island, never ever saw New York City, and their stories <br/>
of school are one-room schoolhouses in West Texas and southeastern New <br/>
Mexico, in little farming communities like Carizozo and Roby in which the <br/>
parents were the school board and the teachers were young local women who <br/>
weren&#39;t yet married, and the schools were teaching them what was happening <br/>
outside their time and town, which is not a bad thing, y&#39;know, but has not a <br/>
lick of anything to do with factory work.  There wasn&#39;t a factory for <br/>
thousands of miles, yet thousands of kids were in schools.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not defending the oppressive methods some schools used.  They were <br/>
protestant farm folk without much use for mysterious fancy city stuff, and <br/>
psychology itself didn&#39;t even exist yet, or hadn&#39;t gotten to Rotan, Texas for <br/>
sure.<br/>
<br/>
When I think back to school in the history of my family, whether it&#39;s the <br/>
1960&#39;s or the 1860&#39;s I try to be compassionate and fair.  People were doing <br/>
what they thought were best.  They were going out of their comfort zone and <br/>
sacrificing time and money to do what they thought was good for their <br/>
children, just as we all are.<br/>
<br/>
Villifying our parents and grandparents isn&#39;t the way to go here.  Villifying <br/>
the schools is an easy path to making ourselves feel better about what we&#39;re <br/>
doing, but I think there are other ways which are better for our souls and <br/>
psyches and better for our children.   If we tell them (and ourselves) that <br/>
our parents made the best choices available to them given their means and <br/>
knowledge and beliefs, I think there will be more peace in our families and <br/>
in our hearts.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to prepare a person for factory work, the way I see it, simply means that<br/>
you aren&#39;t needed to think something through for yourself. You are<br/>
shown/told how to run a machine and it&#39;s repititious. So to prepare a<br/>
person for factory work to me would be to get them used to something not<br/>
necessarily stimulating. I never thought of meanness.<br/>
<br/>
WE don&#39;t see a lot of imagination coming out of the school educated<br/>
children, nor do we see life skills being very sharp when they graduate.<br/>
How many understand the finances behind those credit cards or better yet,<br/>
how many leave school with the desire and knowledge to start their own<br/>
businesses? WE&#39;ve got the school to work programs in place here now, I<br/>
don&#39;t see this as a better solution either.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WE don&#39;t see much of the one room school house theory in place in many ps<br/>
today anymore. I do believe that one room schools had one thing going for<br/>
them, they could actually say that socialization was a factor as they<br/>
didn&#39;t segregate the ages into separate rooms.  But do you actually see<br/>
this type of education in the ps system today or even a private one?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Villifying our parents and grandparents isn&#39;t the way to go here.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t villifying my family or the system, simply stating that the model<br/>
for todays ps isn&#39;t one which is in place to teach real life skills. But my<br/>
family (as far back as you&#39;d like to go) was never involved in making<br/>
decisions about schools.<br/>
<br/>
Villifying <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the schools is an easy path to making ourselves feel better about what we&#39;re <br/>
&gt;doing, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t understand this. I feel wonderful about the choices my children and<br/>
I came to concerning taking charge of education.  This is probably the one<br/>
thing that we did decide to do which helped our family survive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but I think there are other ways which are better for our souls and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;psyches and better for our children.   If we tell them (and ourselves) that <br/>
&gt;our parents made the best choices available to them given their means and <br/>
&gt;knowledge and beliefs, I think there will be more peace in our families and <br/>
&gt;in our hearts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My children are older one almost 15 and I don&#39;t see how anything that my<br/>
parents/grandparents did would sink in in relation to their lives. Schools,<br/>
even when I went which was&#39;t all that ancient, were totally different than<br/>
they are today. My sons are constantly telling me how lucky I was to grow<br/>
up then. But when they bring that up it covers much more than school. They<br/>
are talking about the economy, societal rules and so on. They don&#39;t see<br/>
past generations as having been horrible.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that finding peace in our families has nothing to do with school<br/>
or past generations. It simply comes from growing together. And the only<br/>
way to grow together is to be together. For our family that came about<br/>
through leaving school, not getting ourselves so wrapped up in outside<br/>
activities that we don&#39;t have time at home (yes we even make family dates<br/>
since the boys are older and have more freedom to make plans with friends.)<br/>
<br/>
The trouble we see today goes much deeper than schools. Whether we are<br/>
talking about the school shootings or the number of children being<br/>
diagnosed as ADD to gangs or whatever. The answers aren&#39;t in past<br/>
generations, they are right here. We&#39;ve lost something and unfortunately<br/>
the signs are showing up at the schools. I don&#39;t want my children to return<br/>
to schools simply because I love knowing them again, but I also don&#39;t want<br/>
to see them finding themselves in any situation which makes them unhappy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524813307">schools werent just preparing factory workers but all of society for the<br/>
american dream. to be able to speak the same language, feel the same and do<br/>
the same. they wanted to make good citizens.<br/>
<br/>
by saying this i am not blaming anyone. i think that most people actually<br/>
thought it was for the best. the probably thought they were giving their<br/>
kids better then they had. and they didnt necesarily teach algebra in<br/>
western schools. many times the small schools taught what needed to be<br/>
taught for everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
I think many people now think that they are doing best for thier kids byt<br/>
doing what everyone else is doing. I am sure glad I got over that one and<br/>
thought about what we needed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-664811325">Well put, Sandra.<br/>
:&gt;<br/>
Counting our blessings is a habit that needs to be established in this <br/>
world!<br/>
For me, it&#39;s been Realllly hard to accept that people Do what they Know.  I <br/>
just wish more people would take an active role in their happiness, not a <br/>
passive one...  I, personally, am a survivor and it&#39;s been very difficult to <br/>
follow my path of life when it&#39;s up hill.  I come from a family that was so <br/>
scared of change, that  they (she/my mother) forgot that change can be for <br/>
the better.<br/>
I hope that you all can feel comfortable to change the things in yourselves <br/>
for the better, for YOUr sake...not anyone elses--you all deserve the best!<br/>
