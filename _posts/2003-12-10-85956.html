speak their minds, sometimes we disagree, but as far as extreme<br/>

sex as extreme, I see certain behaviors as extreme. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m only going to quote this part of your last post Ren.. but I agreed with<br/>
ALL of it. This is why I never have anything to add.. You, Sandra and<br/>
others..have already nailed it!  I see my oldest daughter as just being<br/>
herself.. a young woman trying to figure out where she fits in with the<br/>
grand scheme of things. She still comes to me to talk and share, without<br/>
fear of me being critical and demanding..so unlike how I grew up.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The fact that someone is using the term &quot;rebellious&quot; tells me a lot about<br/>
<br/>
parenting style. My children don&#39;t need to &quot;rebel&quot;, they do need to be<br/>
<br/>
themselves though. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My children don&#39;t rebel.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re calmly interested in doing what seems to be the best thing of the <br/>
options before them.  They have no interest in doing stupid things.  Now some <br/>
will say &quot;but you said you think Kirby had sex.&quot;  I think he did.  I could ask <br/>
him, but the behavior I saw after and his responses to my expressed concerns <br/>
were mature and thoughtful, and if he did, he did.  If he didn&#39;t, he probably <br/>
will someday.<br/>
<br/>
What was the original seed of this discussion that spun off into wild <br/>
imagined sexuality of people under 14 with multiple partners?  I&#39;m shocked at the <br/>
hyperbole that came of this, and the NOT so veiled accusations and implications.  <br/>
<br/>
Where did it start?  Was it a suggestion that people who let their children <br/>
play video games apparently didn&#39;t care if that caused their children to engage <br/>
in extremely dangerous behaviors?  Someone with a good memory please refresh <br/>
mine.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you for certain that boys who are playing $60 video games are not <br/>
at that moment out having sex.  I know that boys who are <br/>
allowed/encouraged/enabled to live geeky boy lives are hanging out with other geeky boys.  My boys <br/>
are fairly suave and can get female attention, yet most of their entertainment <br/>
energy goes toward gaming with other boys.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is in his bed asleep.  He took a break from a 40 or so hour LAN party <br/>
to spend two hours at the karate dojo yesterday, and then he came home sometime <br/>
last night so he would be here to go to work at 11:30 this morning.  With the <br/>
same money and car privileges, he could have taken a girl &quot;on a date.&quot;   <br/>
There are girls willing.  One at the university reminds me regularly to tell Kirby <br/>
to call her.  I saw her Friday night at a folksinging party, while Kirby was <br/>
playing Lord of the Rings at the gaming shop.  He has no locker-room buddies <br/>
to report back to at school, and he has no reputation to build in school-terms.<br/>
<br/>
I just realized he has locker-room buddies at the dojo, but they&#39;re younger <br/>
kids who are his students, a few his age who have known him since he was nine, <br/>
and lots of adult black-belt students at the school.  Which of those would he <br/>
brag about if he made out with a girl?  <br/>
<br/>
His life is NOT the stereotypical teenaged boy&#39;s life.  It&#39;s richer, and it&#39;s <br/>
real, and it&#39;s better.<br/>

Seems to me I followed the end of a conversation about our son who hunts with <br/>
his dad and then the email on are unschoolers pro-guns came though and then <br/>
it rolled to sex. I think ......  just seemed so with the timing. Laura<br/>

I&#39;d find it &#39;odd&#39;. Don&#39;t think it will happen though, Heather wants to<br/>
live in a yurt and sell crafts, Bryn wants to be a lawnmower (the<br/>
machine, not someone who mows lawns) and Rhodri is going to Mars.<br/>
Mind you, I was trying to periuade the boys to have their ears peirced<br/>
the other day and they wouldn&#39;t. Someone had told them it&#39;s &#39;girly&#39;.<br/>
Sigh. Mind you, both boys have long hair, Rhodri&#39;s is half way to his<br/>
bum :-)<br/>

LOL. I was just thinking this morning how different things would be if the<br/>
kids were schooled. Yesterday I came out into the living room to find my<br/>
boys (9 and 7) cuddled up together on the couch watching cartoons. It was<br/>
really sweet and loving.<br/>
<br/>
 Today Jess was outside in just a pair of shorts (summer here) pretending to<br/>
be &quot;Madman&quot;. He has just seen some of the Hulk so he has been Hulk for the<br/>
last few days but now has revolved (his word!) into Madman.&lt;g&gt; He was out<br/>
there totally oblivious to everything and having a wonderful time. It was<br/>
9am and most of the kids in town would have been starting school.<br/>
<br/>
When Jess was little he used to go for days pretending to be Postman Pat or<br/>
Fireman Sam now he still does that but he&#39;s Madman or Black Murray. (I think<br/>
watching XMen and The Wiggles makes for very interesting imaginative play.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;) I love the fact that he is still free at nine to be himself (or someone<br/>
of his own choosing!). He hasn&#39;t had to learn to hide.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still learning how NOT to hide.<br/>
