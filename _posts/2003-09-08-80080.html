Kirby and Marty never used to have a plan about what they &quot;wanted to be&quot; when <br/>
they grew up, but lately (last winter) they finally expressed possibilities.  <br/>
   It hasn&#39;t changed their lives much, except that *I* notice when they <br/>
notice those things, and I&#39;m more likely to bring topics, articles, shows or <br/>
whatever to their attention.<br/>
<br/>
If a boy doesn&#39;t have a path, he can still have a meaningful life.  If they <br/>
find responsibilities, to clubs or groups of friends, or volunteer work, or <br/>
sports, or ANYthing, they&#39;re doing something then and there, not just building up <br/>
to doing something when they&#39;re older.   And I think it&#39;s important to thank <br/>
them for real things they do in real ways.<br/>
<br/>
Marty helped Keith put posts in concrete a couple of days.  It was hard work. <br/>
 We could have said, &quot;There, Marty, that will prepare you to do concrete work <br/>
when you&#39;re grown.&quot;  But he had just DONE concrete, real, hard-as-rock <br/>
(almost), and so what we said was, &quot;Thanks!  Those are going to last a long time <br/>
there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s grown and sees them, he&#39;ll know he did real work to put them there.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a minor adjustment, but I think it will make a real difference in the <br/>
way people see their older kids and in the way the kids see themselves, too, if <br/>
their efforts and deeds are recognized in the present.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby filled out his job application just for the files, after they offered <br/>
him a job.  They offered him the job because he was hanging around the store <br/>
and being helpful.  He helped generously, honestly and efficiently.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>
trying to get a job.  He had no idea anyone under 16 COULD get a job.  He was <br/>
doing what he liked to do, and being helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve talked with some other parents about their kids finding jobs that way <br/>
too, or through contacts--recommendations from people they know through other <br/>
activities.  Kirby helps with a comic book and anime shop, not where he works, <br/>
but where the anime club works.  They&#39;ve gotten him into science fiction <br/>
conventions to man their booth/room.  He&#39;s not an employee, but if he ever did need <br/>
a job, every employ there would put out the word because they know him and <br/>
they trust him.<br/>
<br/>
That can&#39;t work with every kind of job, nor with every kind of person, but it <br/>
CAN work with quite a few.<br/>
