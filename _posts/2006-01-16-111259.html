<h4>Liza, Noah, Cricket, and Lucy Gottlieb</h4>
<time>16 Jan 2006, at  3:26pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-174002586">This morning the girls watched Dora and Diego back to back from 9 <br/>
until 2, and I taped it so we&#39;ll have it to watch when we go back to <br/>
Maine (and no cable).  Noah (dh) cruised the internet learning about <br/>
jewel faceting.  I went to Curves with my Mom, and on the way home <br/>
defended unschooling, just a bit, between deep breaths.  My Dad <br/>
threw up a lot, having caught the virus Lucy and I had.  Lucy took a <br/>
nap with Noah and Cricket and I played with her Barbie and did some <br/>
needlework crafting.  I am just venturing into felt embroidery.  I <br/>
love the look of it, but sequins and tiny beads and 2 & 4 yos makes <br/>
me sweat a little.  But Cricket&#39;s great and loves all the crafty <br/>
things.  Lucy woke, I made chocolate chip cookies that rock, and <br/>
Cricket put on a show for us (minus Dad) about Action Girl <br/>
(sometimes her, sometimes Barbie).  Now Noah&#39;s reading a new bio on <br/>
Shakespeare, Mom and Dad are resting, the girls are playing (though <br/>
Lucy&#39;s heading this way), and I am getting caught up with you guys.  <br/>
I love those Dropshots!!<br/>
<br/>
Liza Rose in NC for a bit longer...<br/>
<br/>
ps - we&#39;re visiting Greensboro until Feb. 1... any one out there <br/>
