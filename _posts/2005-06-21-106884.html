&lt;&lt; also: re:  marriage: I am a single parent, and if I<br/>
<br/>
could do ONE thing over again in life, I would go back<br/>
<br/>
to the point of the break up and try a few more things<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t try at the time, because having separated<br/>
<br/>
parents is hell for kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was 17 when my parents decided to split, and my sister was 14.  It was not <br/>
any good for either of us.  I&#39;m glad when I think that it could&#39;ve been sooner <br/>
and that would&#39;ve been worse, but I&#39;m sorry my mom&#39;s alcoholism and selfish <br/>
immaturity did so much damage to so many people&#39;s lives, including hers. <br/>
<br/>
Lots of times it&#39;s the dad&#39;s fault and he doesn&#39;t want to change.  In this <br/>
case, it was substance and tackiness.<br/>
