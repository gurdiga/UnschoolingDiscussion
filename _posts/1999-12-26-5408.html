<div id="ygrps-yiv-62143172">Dear friends --<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank all of you who have contributed so generously to my<br/>
Thanksgiving Appeal.  We are about 2/3rds of our way toward the goal,<br/>
and with three more weeks until South India&#39;s Thanksgiving (Pongal), I<br/>
am confident we will reach it. (for those of you who wish to learn more<br/>
about Pongal, here&#39;s a link --<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/9542/pongal.html">http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/9542/pongal.html</a>  )<br/>
<br/>
I have spoken with my family in South India, and they are excited!  They<br/>
and the villagers are quite aware of the cyclone devastation to the<br/>
north of them which occurred this year, and know that it is only a<br/>
matter of time before the cyclones return to the South.  To be able to<br/>
build their own houses now will be like providing emergency assistance<br/>
BEFORE it happens -- and with a bonus of a clean, dry home in addition.<br/>
<br/>
Tax deductible contributions are still being accepted -- for this year,<br/>
date the check before the turn of the millenium; for next year, practice<br/>
your zeros.  You are all welcome to copy the original appeal, which I&#39;ve<br/>
attached below, and send it on to friends.<br/>
<br/>
With all best wishes for peace, in this, the Season of Peace,<br/>
<br/>

                         A THANKSGIVING APPEAL<br/>
                            November 25, 1999<br/>
<br/>
Dear friends �<br/>
<br/>
Most of you who know me from homeschooling circles, Quaker or<br/>
interreligious service work, or are just plain ol� friends, have heard<br/>
me wax eloquent about the work of my adopted Indian parents in far south<br/>
of India in the state of Tamil Nadu � S. and Krishnamal Jaganathan. I<br/>
apologize in advance for this appeal but, as I hope you will see, it is<br/>
heartfelt and much needed.<br/>
<br/>
My father is now 89, mother 73 � they have worked uninterruptedly as<br/>
Gandhian land reform organizers, trying to bring land to the landless<br/>
poor, for some 50 years.  And after about 30 years, their work began to<br/>
bear fruit. Through an inventive combination of loans, nonviolent action<br/>
(to get government land ceiling laws enforced), friendly persuasion, and<br/>
just plain hard work, through their organization Land for the Tillers<br/>
Freedom, they have helped 11,000 agricultural families come to own their<br/>
own land � most of whom had been landless for more than 40 generations.<br/>
The land is held either in cooperatives, or by women (the men have been<br/>
known to sell it to pay for drink), provides for the basic needs of the<br/>
family, with enough left over to support small cottage industries.  I<br/>
have visited regularly since 1977 and, quite frankly, it is a miracle!<br/>
They have been nominated for the International Right Livelihood Award,<br/>
and Women�s World Summit Foundation in Switzerland just gave my mother<br/>
their prize for �Women�s Creativity in Rural Life�, calling her �a<br/>
Gandhian Joan of Arc�.  Whenever I am there, I get introduced to all my<br/>
�relatives�, as she is considered mother by all.<br/>
<br/>
In the last 3 years, they have had to fight another battle � against<br/>
multinational corporations who had set up prawn farms that were<br/>
destroying the coastal ecology, salinating and polluting the soil,<br/>
destroying the mangroves protecting against the cyclone winds.  My<br/>
father�s case ended up in the Indian Supreme Court � he and his one<br/>
lawyer against 116 lawyers representing the multinationals.  He won �<br/>
the Supreme Court ordered all the prawn farms in fragile coastal areas<br/>
closed -- but quite literally lost his eyes in the process.  The<br/>
government threatened to pass a law overturning the Supreme Court order,<br/>
while he was having an eye operation.  He signed himself out of<br/>
post-operative recovery 10 days early, traveled 2,000 miles via train in<br/>
110 degree summer heat, and set up a fast at the Gandhi Memorial in New<br/>
Delhi.  The government backed down, but his eyes never recovered.  And<br/>
this year, after a series of nonviolent actions and fasts involving<br/>
thousands of people, he got the order enforced, at least in the district<br/>
where their land reform activities have taken place.  I have come to<br/>
learn that when my father acts as Don Quixote going up against the<br/>
windmill, I wouldn�t bet on the windmill!<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of all of this, my mother also collects stray children.<br/>
Literally.  She picks them off garbage heaps, roaming the streets,<br/>
begging in bus stations.  (A boy I personally  support was found hanging<br/>
from a tree by one foot, placed there by an abusive father.) She now has<br/>
120 of them, (46 at my �home�) who she feeds, clothes, houses, sends to<br/>
school, and finds what love she can for them.  We�ve managed to find<br/>
families in Italy to �adopt� them and pay for their expenses. Last year<br/>
when I was in India, I raised money (my own and some friends) to deepen<br/>
the well next to the house, so the kids could plant 200 new coconut and<br/>
papaya trees � they help plant and harvest rice, care for six<br/>
milk-giving cows and water buffaloes, and grow vegetables (all in<br/>
addition to their school work), so they can help feed themselves.  My<br/>
mother and father live simply (on around $70 a month) � since 1939, my<br/>
father has spun the cotton for every article of clothing he has worn<br/>
(luckily, he doesn�t need much clothing). So their own needs are<br/>
minimal.<br/>
<br/>
But we have a need, and that�s why I am appealing for help.  The 11,000<br/>
families now have land, but their houses are made of mud and straw, and<br/>
when the cyclones come (as they did north of them this year), the houses<br/>
are virtually all destroyed.  They leak during the monsoon rains (which<br/>
happen twice year), and the kids end up sleeping on the wet ground. My<br/>
mother�s dream is to house them all decently, or more correctly, have<br/>
them house themselves.  She has a well-developed plan whereby she can<br/>
start a cottage industry making cinder blocks, sell enough of the blocks<br/>
on the open market to cover raw material costs, and have the people<br/>
build their own homes with the bricks they make themselves.  But she<br/>
(we!) need just under $5,500 for a brickmaking machine (and the people�s<br/>
ability to access loans is already too stretched by payments on the<br/>
land.)<br/>
<br/>
I have received sponsorship from the Gandhian Foundation, a 501(c)(3)<br/>
charitable organization based in New Jersey to receive funds for the<br/>
project (which I desperately want to get started after this year�s rice<br/>
harvest festival � the South Indian equivalent of Thanksgiving, around<br/>
January 20 � after the harvest, people are free to pursue cottage<br/>
industries, and build homes.  I plan to contribute significantly from<br/>
what income I make from my book (And the Skylark Sings with Me), and my<br/>
kids are counting their pennies, too.  THERE ARE NO ADMINISTRATIVE<br/>
EXPENSES RELATED TO THIS PROJECT.<br/>
<br/>
So, tax deductible donations (large and small) will be deeply, deeply<br/>
appreciated.  They should be made out to the Gandhian Foundation, and<br/>
mailed to me:<br/>

<br/>
I do hope you will seriously consider this appeal. Thanks very much<br/>
indeed, and have a joyful, prayerful, truly meaningful thanksgiving and<br/>
what it means to live in a land where there truly is enough for us all.<br/>
If you require more info., e-mail me at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:shantinik@...">shantinik@...</a>  Please<br/>
feel free to share this appeal with others as you think appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
(P.S.  If there are homeschoolers who want to know more about India,<br/>
etc. � we�d be happy to help � we might also be able to arrange for<br/>
Indian penpals -- though I can�t promise this for sure � you have to<br/>
remember, the kids we are supporting are just becoming literate in their<br/>
own languages, and most struggle with their English.)<br/>
