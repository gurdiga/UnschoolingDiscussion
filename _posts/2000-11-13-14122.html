<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; candidate<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so glad you said that. I have been struggling with<br/>
the same thing. My 7 year old boy has alot of the<br/>
qualities that usually are dubbed ADD or ADHD. I,<br/>
personally, think he is a normal , yet very active and<br/>
enthusiastic boy. He went to public school for grades<br/>
K-1 and we were always being called in for &quot;disruptive<br/>
behavior&quot; and told that he &quot;just cant seem to stop<br/>
talking, moving, disrupting class.&quot; We were always<br/>
left shaking our heads, not sure if our gut feelings<br/>
were right---- How can any child sit still for so long<br/>
without wanting to break out and have some fun. I know<br/>
alot of kids do it, but I couldnt see my son doing it.<br/>
Finally, with 3 weeks left to 1st grade, we pulled him<br/>
out. We just couldnt take it anymore! They(school)<br/>
were trying to tell my son he was bad, and he was<br/>
starting to BE bad!<br/>
We started off this school year with some school at<br/>
home. It was a disaster, and after alot of reading and<br/>
research about unschooling, we decided to try it, even<br/>
if it would be temporary. This child is blossoming<br/>
already! He is able to sit and read quietly, as long<br/>
as he has made the decision to do so. If I say &quot;why<br/>
dont you go read a book?&quot; he whines, complains, etc. I<br/>
guess this is whst unschooling is, right? I had been<br/>
feeling a ton of pressure about unschooling, too,<br/>
bacause my sister is a school teacher and I figured<br/>
she&#39;d be onto me if things werent working out well.<br/>
She is also in charge of evaluating homeschoolers in<br/>
her school district(not mine!). She offered to<br/>
evaluate him for me, to let me know where I stand, and<br/>
I was really glad for this, but also VERY nervous. She<br/>
came last Friday, and while I paced the floor, they<br/>
worked together for a good hour. She announced<br/>
&quot;Congratulations Mom! You&#39;re son is at an end of third<br/>
grade reading level, 2nd grade writing.&quot; My heart felt<br/>
so good. She hugged me and told me not to worry, he<br/>
was doing fine. I couldnt have felt better. I promised<br/>
myself to relax more and let my son find his way. So<br/>
much of the pressure is off now, and although I am<br/>
still nervous, I know that atleast I dont have to<br/>
worry about him being behind.<br/>
I&#39;m still having trouble accepting that he&#39;ll learn<br/>
what he needs without alot of textbooks and<br/>
worksheets, but I am hoping to gain confidence through<br/>
this group. I realize I have really ranted here, I<br/>
hope I&#39;m not the first!<br/>
Any help or suggestions for this first year of our<br/>
adventure in unschooling will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
