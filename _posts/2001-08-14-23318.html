&lt;&lt; &gt; Circumcision is not snipping off the &quot;tip&quot; of a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; penis, but rather snipping off a bit of skin that *covers* the tip of the <br/>
&gt; penis. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They snip off a lot of skin.<br/>
<br/>
If people have to do it they do, but for those who have no religious reason, <br/>
they need to stop for sure.  <br/>
<br/>
The best analogy I&#39;ve heard isn&#39;t even a very good one, and that was cutting <br/>
off the entire outside of someone&#39;s ear to keep the ear canal cleaner, or <br/>
cutting all that skin and cartiledge (sp?) off someone&#39;s nose so their nasal <br/>
passages (the important part) could be kept cleaner.<br/>
<br/>
No, all the parts of people&#39;s bodies serve a purpose.  Even tonsils (although <br/>
when doctors didn&#39;t know what that purpose was, they were glad to take money <br/>
to cut them out of six year olds everywhere, me being one of them).  Even <br/>
gallbladders (which in France are not removed, but people are given diet and <br/>
meds to make things better.  U.S. snips them out).  Even foreskins.<br/>
