<h4>Pam Hartley</h4>
<time>23 Jan 2003, at  1:17am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605388918">Julie, I&#39;m combining two of your posts for my own selfish convenience. ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In our home, we do have family policies such as returning what<br/>
&gt; you use or lose the privilege of using it. We are grace-oriented<br/>
&gt; and will often say, &quot;Hey you left this out; come put it away.&quot; But if<br/>
&gt; a child is being repeatedly careless, then there is discussion<br/>
&gt; and a consequencelosing the privilege of borrowing for<br/>
&gt; awhile.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is the consequence if you or your husband is repeatedly careless? I<br/>
assume that occasionally happens (I know I can be careless, as can my<br/>
husband).<br/>
<br/>
Probably it&#39;s a natural consequence -- you leave something out that gets wet<br/>
in the rain, you have to buy a new one. I don&#39;t know what grace-oriented is,<br/>
but I can tell you that here I&#39;m a little obsessive about our family board<br/>
games, etc. I like them to be put away right away, so pieces aren&#39;t lost.<br/>
<br/>
So, when my daughters were old enough to take out a game, I&#39;d ask them to<br/>
put it away right away when they were done. If it wasn&#39;t, I&#39;d pick it up and<br/>
just mention it to them later (&quot;I put Chutes and Ladders away for you.&quot;).<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;d ask them to. The result of this is that at 8 and 5 I almost<br/>
never have to pick up any game pieces. I don&#39;t bother about most other<br/>
things, I&#39;m only that way about games. &lt;g&gt; But they knew it was important to<br/>
me, and they understand why, and they are cheerfully accommodating me. If I<br/>
had set up a punishment situation (&quot;You left Chutes and Ladders out for the<br/>
fifth time this week, now you can&#39;t play it tomorrow.&quot;) it would have<br/>
devolved from them doing me a kindness to something far yuckier that I&#39;d<br/>
rather not have in our relationship.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel similarly about cleaning up after meals and doing a<br/>
&gt; once-a-day pick up so that we start fresh each day with cleared<br/>
&gt; counters and floors. I&#39;ve shared with the kids that this is how I<br/>
&gt; function best as their mother and so we all do it together. I<br/>
&gt; somehow have gotten the impression that some here would see<br/>
&gt; that as coercion. I simply see it as a family practice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your husband said to you, &quot;I function best as a husband if every day you<br/>
and I clean up the yard&quot; and you have no choice, is that coercion, or a<br/>
family practice?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; When we discussed chores etc. before, there was<br/>
&gt; significant resistance on this list to &quot;imposing *anything*. So this<br/>
&gt; is why I think there can be confusionwhy a mother would<br/>
&gt; wonder if she should limit a child jumping on her bed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s her bed, you see. If my daughters don&#39;t want me to do something to<br/>
their beds, I won&#39;t (including jumping on it, making it with sheets they<br/>
think are ugly, whatever) so if I tell them I&#39;d rather they not do something<br/>
to mine, they listen. If they didn&#39;t, I&#39;d stand up for my rights to an<br/>
unjumped bed, just like if ANYONE (husband, friends, children) was doing<br/>
something to me or my immediate and sole possessions that I didn&#39;t like, I&#39;d<br/>
see that they stopped.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; To my way of thinking, the philosophy of unschooling is one that<br/>
&gt; supports our family values. It isn&#39;t the ideology that supercedes<br/>
&gt; who we are as individuals. I want to blend the philosophy with<br/>
&gt; what I realisitically know I need to function well with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about what they need to function well with you? What if one of your<br/>
children realistically needs to stare out the window and not get involved<br/>
with cleanup 6 days next week. Where do his or her needs fit in? What if<br/>
they can&#39;t articulate them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you see it? Do you hear the tension being felt here? Is it<br/>
&gt; &quot;imposing on a child&quot; to say, &quot;We take care of each other&#39;s<br/>
&gt; posessions or you won&#39;t get to use them&quot;? I think so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do some unschooling families set routines that support the<br/>
&gt; functioning of the home that involve their kids? I think so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All unschooling families do, I imagine. But the key is &quot;families set<br/>
routines&quot; not &quot;mom sets routines that are most appealing to her and everyone<br/>
else falls in or else they lose things or are otherwise punished.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
:::snip to next post:::<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On the other hand, one of the things that concerns me is that I<br/>
&gt;hear women talking about children as though they are<br/>
&gt; little adults. Kids are notoriously poor at imagining future<br/>
&gt; They don&#39;t always tie past behavior with present<br/>
&gt; results. (Sleep is an easy example of this, particularly with young<br/>
&gt; kids.) They often won&#39;t try something new (as in food) just based<br/>
&gt; on it&#39;s color. They often aren&#39;t conscious of other people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; possessions or even their own. (I&#39;m talking about young children<br/>
&gt; especially--under 10).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I often won&#39;t try a new food based on color, or name of the food, or smell.<br/>
Sometimes, I stay up way too late even though I know I&#39;ll feel awful the<br/>
next day when I have to get up early for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
Children are young, less experienced humans. So yes, they are &quot;little<br/>
adults&quot;. They can and will learn to listen to their own bodies, to treat<br/>
family members with respect, etc., just as an adult learns the things they<br/>
need to function.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Certainly I help them to put things away, I allow them to leave out<br/>
&gt; a game over a couple of day period if they are in the middle. I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not talking about rigidity. I&#39;m talking about consideration for the<br/>
&gt; fact that seven people are sharing this space together.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They didn&#39;t choose to have seven people share the space. They are living<br/>
with a reality of a large family that was not their option or decision, nor<br/>
should it be their burden in any way you can help it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &#92;Setting a bedtime has helped my kids sleep well and spend the<br/>
&gt; next day in good spirits. If a child is surprisingly alert one night,<br/>
&gt; I might suggest she page through a book until she sleeps, or I<br/>
&gt; might rube her back and sing to her. But having her in bed at<br/>
&gt; 8:30 or 9:00 is important to her and to me, whether she totally<br/>
&gt; gets why or not. She is willing and that&#39;s because we take great<br/>
&gt; care in not laying a big burden of expectations on her in all her<br/>
&gt; other waking hours. It&#39;s just the routine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having her in bed at 8:30 or 9:00 is important to her how? If someone else<br/>
set your bedtime, would you resent it? What if you weren&#39;t tired? What if<br/>
you really wanted to finish a project but someone else was saying, &quot;Nope,<br/>
clock says 9 p.m., in bed with you.&quot; What if someone else got to decide<br/>
these important and personal things for you?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;To me, these are routines that support our unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t see them competing with it at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you set your own routines for the things that are important to you, and<br/>
the kids set their routines for the things they want to do and that are<br/>
important to them, and you simply ask if someone will help you as you need<br/>
them, as you go through your day, just as they ask you for help as they go<br/>
through theirs, you are likely to get help in my experience. There are<br/>
unschoolers with large families and it really does work.<br/>
<br/>
I know this all sounds abrupt -- it&#39;s late :) and I want to get it sent. I<br/>
am not intending to sound snippy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30923885">The purpose of this post is for me to agree with Pam Hartley.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
devolved from them doing me a kindness to something far yuckier that I&#39;d<br/>
<br/>
rather not have in our relationship. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We still have the tiny plastic acorns for our Squirrel game.<br/>
<br/>
Two reasons:  I used to check through the vacuum cleaner bags for Ninja <br/>
Turtle weapons or game pieces.   And we had a &quot;lost parts&quot; drawer, and any <br/>
game piece found randomly about was (still is) returned to its box at some <br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
My kids played LOTS of games (still, sometimes, Holly especially) and we have <br/>
always been careful with game pieces.  They like the games, they see <br/>
immediately the purpose of keeping things together, and they do it not from <br/>
fear of punishment or limitations but because it&#39;s right to do.  The <br/>
limitation and punishment is that they can&#39;t play if the parts aren&#39;t there.  <br/>
<br/>
And instead of making them put the games up when they were little we would <br/>
get them to help us (or we would &quot;help them&quot; even though it was doing most of <br/>
the work), and talk about which pieces went where, and make a game of lining <br/>
up the stuff in the box.<br/>
<br/>
Also I bought little ziploc bags for games pieces.  And for jigsaw puzzles, <br/>
we put the pieces in a ziploc bag (gallon freezer bags, usually) inside the <br/>
box, so if the box falls being put up high or taken down, the pieces armans <br/>
have instincts which we try to extinguish.  Maybe we shouldn&#39;t do that.  <br/>
By forcing children to eat what we put on their plates regardless of their <br/>
personal gag factor, we don&#39;t teach them anything good.  We teach them to <br/>
ignore their bodies, to ignore their noses, and to do what bigger people tell <br/>
them to do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes, I stay up way too late even though I know I&#39;ll feel awful the<br/>
<br/>
next day when I have to get up early for some reason.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After I sent the post about sleeping, Holly asked me to forward it to her so <br/>
she could read it later.  I had to go to sent mail and all, and Holly was <br/>
asking me whether there were really parents who thought a kid wouldn&#39;t go to <br/>
sleep when he was sleepy.  &quot;They&#39;ll fall asleep in their chairs if they&#39;re <br/>
really sleepy.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;But they&#39;ve never tried it, so they don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly laughed.  She said, &quot;Haven&#39;t THEY ever fallen asleep in a chair?&quot;  <br/>
(meaning the parents)<br/>
<br/>
I said maybe the parents had always gone to bed by the clock too.  She just <br/>
laughed and went to wake Kirby up.  They&#39;re going to a Harry Potter <br/>
tournament together in a bit.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Children are young, less experienced humans. So yes, they are &quot;little<br/>
<br/>
adults&quot;. They can and will learn to listen to their own bodies, to treat<br/>
<br/>
family members with respect, etc., just as an adult learns the things they<br/>
<br/>
need to function.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pam&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;a little adult&quot;?<br/>
We don&#39;t have the &quot;adult&quot; distinction here.  Kirby has been on a growth curve <br/>
his whole live, and a learning curve, which is uniquely his.  We&#39;ve treated <br/>
him like a person.  We&#39;ve treated him like Kirby.  There isn&#39;t a point at <br/>
which he becomes Kirby, or becomes a real person.  He already is.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s our duty and privilege and joy to help him learn about the world, to <br/>
give him a safe haven and a launchpad.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt;To me, these are routines that support our unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t see them competing with it at all.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That wasn&#39;t Pam, that was Pam quoting.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s not a matter of &quot;competing,&quot; it&#39;s a philosophical matter.<br/>
<br/>
If one doesn&#39;t believe that children can self-regulate as to sleeping or <br/>
eating, can they really believe that they will self-regulate watching movies <br/>
or playing on the computer?   Will they believe that reading can happen <br/>
without a schedule imposed from outside if they don&#39;t think a child will go <br/>
to sleep when he&#39;s sleepy?  <br/>
<br/>
We were lucky to have tried the flexibility about eating and sleeping before <br/>
Kirby was school-age, and I think that helped make unschooling really easy to <br/>
trust.<br/>
