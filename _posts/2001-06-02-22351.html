<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245531638">I&#39;ve just come back from no-mail, and I&#39;ll be going on no-mail again <br/>
sometime in July, so I have no idea what&#39;s been going on on this <br/>
list.  Anyway, my mom and dad have finally decided to homeschool my <br/>
younger siblings who are still at home.  She wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;When I was considering homeschooling James when we first moved here <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had<br/>
him ask over at the school if I could homeschool him and still have <br/>
him take<br/>
one or two classes there.  As I remember, they told him that it <br/>
couldn&#39;t be<br/>
done.  Since it probably can be done, before I go over there and ask <br/>
myself,<br/>
do you know where I can find something in black and white stating that<br/>
schools have to provide this service for homeschooled kids?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Any replies would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my 15yo sister doesn&#39;t want to homeschool, but my mom doesn&#39;t <br/>
want her at school where she picks up &quot;this attitude&quot; - as my mom <br/>
describes it.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

The school is probably right.  In many states, registration has to be for at <br/>
least half a day (meaning you&#39;re there for over half the day, because they&#39;ll <br/>
stick you with homeroom and maybe lunch so they&#39;re getting their stipend <br/>
legally).  And they might require &quot;solids&quot; (English, history, math), as many <br/>
schools consider music and sports and all that to be dessert--earned by <br/>
making good grades and not needing to repeat classes or take study hall.<br/>
<br/>
She can&#39;t force the school to let her child take band or math or anything <br/>
else.  A child who is not enrolled there is not a student there.<br/>

I have a suggestion.  <br/>
Locking a 15 year old girl in when she wants to be out is a likely path to a <br/>
resentful attitude.<br/>
