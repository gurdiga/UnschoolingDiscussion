<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024835553">Hi All,<br/>
  I have a close friend who has a son the same age as mine. They would both <br/>
have been entering K  this August; her son went to school and mine stayed home. <br/>
The first week of school went fine for her son and she was very proud at how <br/>
well he adjusted. This week, he claimed to be sick for 2 days. After a little <br/>
questioning she learned that he wasn&#39;t really sick but didn&#39;t want to go to <br/>
school. It seems that there are 2 bullies in his class, his folder and backpack <br/>
are too small, he has trouble getting his pants snapped after using the <br/>
bathroom and can&#39;t get his lunch items open to eat in the cafeteria. (This is <br/>
all-day, every-day K.)<br/>
  His mom keeps telling him that there is NO CHOICE, everyone has to go to <br/>
school and that him coming home sick is really stressing her out. She then calls <br/>
me with the latest details. ((Sigh)) She doesn&#39;t believe in homeschooling so <br/>
I just bite my tongue while she rants but I really want to say &quot;Obviously, <br/>
there is an option!!&quot; <br/>

You can only bit your tongue so long.<br/>

Here&#39;s what happened with me and my sister:<br/>

There *IS* an option, and you will let her waste too much of your time and <br/>
hers too if you don&#39;t gradually and eventually tell her that.<br/>

Another alternative is to explain to her at those times that is <br/>
precisely why you homeschool.  It is a wonderful opportunity to show <br/>
people that you were aware of these very typical complications in <br/>
schooling through your research and have choosen this path instead.  <br/>
That way, it is less of here is what you should do and more this is <br/>
why I chose to do it.  When my SIL complains about school, I don&#39;t <br/>
discuss homeschooling as an option because it would not be welcome <br/>
but I make it loud and clear that her complaints are some of the <br/>
reasons I have made the decision.  In a sense they are giving you <br/>
and examples and arguements to prove your point.<br/>
<br/>
However, I certainly don&#39;t feel I have to convince others.  There <br/>
are some people that will NEVER want to do this.  I have to respect <br/>
people&#39;s choices, particulary people whom I care about.  If someone <br/>
complains I listen and try to offer them help or advice within <br/>
the &quot;school&quot; realm if I can think of something useful.  If their <br/>
child is going to stay in school than I certainly want to offer and <br/>
help to make that as plesant as possible if I have any advice that <br/>
is usable.   But I do start quite a few sentences with &quot;That was one <br/>
reason we decided to keep Keiran at home..&quot;  Also, if I am having a <br/>
bad day with my kids I would not want someone to say &quot;send them to <br/>
school&quot; or &quot;I told you so&quot; either so I am sure they feel the same.<br/>

Then say &quot;Do you believe in leaving him where he&#39;s miserable?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or if she says &quot;I told him kids have no choice, everyone has to go to <br/>
school,&quot; remind her that what she told him isn&#39;t true, and if she wants to keep his <br/>
confidence, truth would be better.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t help her lie to herself and her son.  <br/>

I am sure she calls you because you are friends and all, but do you maybe <br/>
think there is some sort of subconscious stuff at work here? I mean why does she <br/>
call YOU, the homeschooling mom, opposed to so and so her friend with kids in <br/>
school, who could give her all the advice and reassurance she &quot;needs&quot; to keep <br/>
her child in school? She is reaching out, even if she doesn&#39;t know it. But <br/>
that is just my opinion! &lt;G&gt; Sandra has an article about her sister, it is all <br/>
about her journey from school to homeschooling and around that block again. I&#39;m <br/>
sure you have seen it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-749966732">Apparently the only here without a choice is this poor boy.  Anyone <br/>
these days who doesn&#39;t know there are choices in education is really <br/>
