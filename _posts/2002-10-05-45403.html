&lt;&lt; Ren, why don&#39;t you just say what you mean!  = )  <br/>
 I just love reading your posts because you never pussy foot around.  I<br/>
 might have a small crush on you but I won&#39;t tell anyone. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
hehe!! You&#39;re so funny.<br/>
I just wanted to make the point that it had to be supplemented.  A plant <br/>
based diet without supplementation of this could lead to deficiency. And yes, <br/>
I have noticed it in some of the health foods lately.<br/>
I think a vegan diet can be fine for kids too. But I would let them choose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I agree.  They have to be able to choose it for themselves and to<br/>
know no one will judge them if they make a different choice.  Fortunately<br/>
there are a lot of people in his life he admires who are meat eaters and<br/>
so I don&#39;t think he associates it with some kind of moral deficiency,<br/>
like he might if he only knew vegans.&lt;g&gt;  (We are an uppity bunch!)  I am<br/>
the only vegan he knows, and his dad eats meat occasionally, so I think<br/>
he sees a balance.   I think he&#39;s comfortable making his own choices too,<br/>
so hopefully this issue will not be the most difficult one in his life.  <br/>
He&#39;s young enough still that the concept of eating &quot;someone&quot; else is<br/>
revolting to him, personally.  But those views rarely stay with a person<br/>
forever.  We all grow and change.  My only hope is that he&#39;s not afraid<br/>
to be himself, whoever that turns out to be.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote> We didn&#39;t really plan on the Vegan diet. I&#39;ve been vegetarian for 20 <br/>
odd years and vegan on and off during that. I&#39;d planned to raise the <br/>
kids as veggie mainly just for the convenience but it turned out that <br/>
they all had dairy intolerances that led to terrible excema and <br/>
asthma. It took me 3 years to figure it out even though I knew I got <br/>
sick if I had too much dairy. (Bar of choc is OK, lump of cheese is <br/>
not).<br/>
Now that they are older we are gradually introducing dairy although <br/>
my eldest has said she wont eat it. As I&#39;m vegan again I respect <br/>
her decision. My two boys will eat some cheese but it must be <br/>
English cheese, not American. (Imported cheese is very expensive. <br/>
It&#39;s like each bit had its own seat on the plane. Sigh).<br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough I did develop a B12 deficiency severe enough to <br/>
cause neurological damage but that was while I was eating dairy <br/>
and taking supplements. It was caused by the antacids I take <br/>
which block absorption of B12.<br/>
The Doctor was so disappointed as he was ant-vegan and was all <br/>
set to rant at me :-)<br/>
