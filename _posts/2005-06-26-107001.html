<div id="ygrps-yiv-361044338">There&#39;s a great study that two Brits did in the 90&#39;s examining the<br/>
function of female orgasm.  They got 20 couples (friends of theirs) to<br/>
keep a sex log and to collect what is called flowback (the seminal<br/>
fluid that comes back out after sex) for some period of time.  What<br/>
they found was that when a woman had an orgasm within a minute prior<br/>
to the man&#39;s orgasm and up to something like 20 minutes after she was<br/>
more likely to retain more seminal fluid than if she had an orgasm<br/>
earlier in the encounter (I would write sex bout, but that seems far<br/>
too clinical) or if she didn&#39;t have an orgasm at all.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a review of the work up to 1996 in Psychology Today<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cms.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19960101-000028.html.">http://cms.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19960101-000028.html.</a>  The<br/>
original papers are fun to read and it is the easiest bit of<br/>
evolutionary theory that David (dh) teaches at University.<br/>
<br/>
So, if she asks again you can talk about all this weird stuff and<br/>
giggle at the idea of people collecting their flowback, if you want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243147328">Sandra...thank you for the &quot;Correct&quot; spelling of Orgasm !!! When I <br/>
was typing the e-mail my husband came up behind me and was reading <br/>
my e-mail...I think he saw the word &quot;SEX&quot; and wanted to know &quot;WHO&quot; I <br/>
was e-mailing about sex !! LOL <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow...he told me I spelled orgasm wrong. I should have known <br/>
better, I spelled it the correct way to begin with. He prides <br/>
himself on being a great speller, and when I said he was wrong...I <br/>
began to second guess myself. At that point I &quot;Should&quot; have gone for <br/>
the dictionary...but went with his spelling of the word (Orgasim). <br/>
<br/>
Next time I&#39;ll just go for the dictionary !!!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173195779">This really isn&#39;t about sex education per se, but kind<br/>
of.<br/>
<br/>
My dd will be 5 in 17 days and we have spoke with her<br/>
about molestation (not necessarily in those words) and<br/>
how to avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
Most of her life she has NOT been the modest type and<br/>
that is fine with us, but lately she has really picked<br/>
it up.  That is also fine with us.<br/>
<br/>
Last night during her bath she was covering her<br/>
nipples.  I didn&#39;t see it, but dh did and he told me a<br/>
few minutes later because he didn&#39;t know how to<br/>
discuss it with her.  He said it looked like she was<br/>
playing with her nipples.<br/>
<br/>
I went in (she was still in the bath) and talked to<br/>
her.  She said that she was covering them so I didn&#39;t<br/>
see them.  I tried to convey to her that she didn&#39;t<br/>
HAVE to do that with us.  I don&#39;t think I was clear on<br/>
that.  I sounded wishy washy to me.<br/>
<br/>
How would you guys have handled that?<br/>
