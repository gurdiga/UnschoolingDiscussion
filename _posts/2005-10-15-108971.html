<div id="ygrps-yiv-938679547">It&#39;s getting to be that time again [:)]:<br/>
<br/>
National Novel Writing Month challenge!<br/>
(http://www.nanowrimo.org)<br/>
<br/>
The challenge is to write a 50,000 word novel (about 175 page) from  <br/>
scratch between November 1 and midnight November 30.<br/>
<br/>
(I went most of the month pronouncing it nano-REE-mo but it&#39;s  <br/>
actually nano-RIGH-mo of course to go with &quot;writing&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is doable :-) Yes, it&#39;s a lot of work. And a lot of fun :-)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (13 then) and I both did it last year and got our 50,000  <br/>
words in. We&#39;ll be doing it again this year. I think 6000 people  <br/>
managed to do it (out of lots and lots more who started and didn&#39;t  <br/>
finish of course!)<br/>
<br/>
Registration opens October 1.<br/>
<br/>
50,000 words is actually a novella. A novel generally has at least  <br/>
100,000. But the point is to force yourself to push the words out and  <br/>
let them take you where the words and your characters want to go.  <br/>
There&#39;s no time for editing. There&#39;s no time for pre-editing --  <br/>
criticizing before the words even get written. There&#39;s only time for  <br/>
writing :-)<br/>
<br/>
And as I said amazing things come out. A lot of crap comes out  <br/>
too ;-) But ideas will come out and you won&#39;t know where they came  <br/>
from, ides like nothing you could ever have planned on.<br/>
<br/>
You can plan -- think up a basic story outline -- but no writing  <br/>
until Nov 1.<br/>
<br/>
I began with no plan [:)] I had three fantasy characters pop into my  <br/>
head: a dragon rider and a tiger rider and a monk (like a Buddhist  <br/>
monk with fighting skills) who was probably romantically involved  <br/>
with one of them but they were both really mad at him for some  <br/>
reason. I had no idea why [;)] It was going to have to do with flight  <br/>
that was a passion of the dragon rider and she was going to lose that  <br/>
at one point. And there would be demons. And that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
We set ourselves a goal of 1700 words a day which is 51,000 words.  <br/>
That gives next to no leeway for days when writing doesn&#39;t go well or  <br/>
when something comes up (like Thanksgiving!) But it&#39;s also mega- <br/>
incentive to get back on track the next day. I don&#39;t think I went  <br/>
more than 2 days without catching up so it&#39;s a good kick in the butt.  <br/>
I think I&#39;ll try 2000 words/day and see how that works this year.<br/>
<br/>
Considering that the novel I&#39;ve been picking at for the last 20 years  <br/>
hasn&#39;t gotten beyond (it&#39;s embarrassing to say ;-) 100,000 words of  <br/>
notes, actually finishing something and seeing the ideas flow without  <br/>
being planned was enlightening to say the least :-)<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re done you upload it to their automated word counter to  <br/>
verify that you&#39;ve produced 50,000 words. There&#39;s no one judging  <br/>
quality or checking to see if you&#39;ve uploaded 50,000 of the same  <br/>
word ;-) It&#39;s a personal challenge and all you get is a link to a  <br/>
certificate you print out and personal satisfaction -- and a novel of  <br/>
course! -- so there&#39;s nothing to be gained by cheating. You don&#39;t  <br/>
have to have finished your story. You just need to have produced  <br/>
50,000 words before midnight November 30.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s about it. There&#39;s more information at the website and feel  <br/>
free to ask me questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869448086">Joyce, I just c&p&#39;d your post over to Word and had it count the  words.  <br/>
 <br/>
597.  Some of that was yahoo stuff at the bottom.<br/>
 <br/>
So for about 3 longish emails a day, I could write 50,000 words in a  month?  <br/>
 <br/>
(For Joyce, who is able to do about 1000 words per email, and still have  the <br/>
writing be succint and to the point, it should be a piece of cake!)<br/>
 <br/>
How much time does it take you to pound out your 1700 words a  day?<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not a story teller.  I know I don&#39;t have a novel in me waiting to  get <br/>
out.  Can it be non-fiction?  <br/>
 <br/>
Still, I&#39;m thinking of trying it.  We can&#39;t do any writing before  11/1, not <br/>
even writing an outline?  <br/>

It&#39;s just a matter of personal integrity.<br/>

I had someone cheat at Scrabble once, using upside down tiles as blanks.   I <br/>
didn&#39;t like her anymore.   She was still happy with herself, though.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never feel succinct. I always feel wordy! But honestly a lengthy  <br/>
involved email can take me 2 hours. But I feel like my thoughts are  <br/>
more orderly afterwards :-) But piece of cake. No. No one sees what  <br/>
goes in. They just see the end result! ;-) Which is why I was driven  <br/>
to put the website together. All those hours and nothing permanent to  <br/>
show for it!  I&#39;ve probably written a dozen novels worth over the  <br/>
years ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How much time does it take you to pound out your 1700 words a  day?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I deliberately left that out so as not to spook anyone ;-)  <br/>
Kathryn thought 5 hours and that&#39;s probably right but it never felt  <br/>
that long and it didn&#39;t seem that hard to find. There never seems to  <br/>
be enough hours in the day and yet when we don&#39;t do anything but the  <br/>
essentials (like shopping for food and cooking) we found enough time  <br/>
to devote to writing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s supposed to be a novel but why not use it for whatever you  <br/>
want :-) As Sandra said, no one checks. There&#39;s just automatic word  <br/>
counters to count the words. If you can use it to do something you&#39;ve  <br/>
been wanting to, go for it :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Still, I&#39;m thinking of trying it.  We can&#39;t do any writing before   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Outlines and planning are okay.  The reason for not beginning  <br/>
NaNoWriMo with an already begun *novel* is so can enter with a &quot;let&#39;s  <br/>
see where this goes&quot; attitude rather than having the characters  <br/>
already set and on a path. That won&#39;t apply to nonfiction, I think.<br/>
<br/>
For those who do try with a novel, you&#39;ll find that week 1 is pretty  <br/>
easy because anything can happen and new characters can pop in  <br/>
unexpectedly. It&#39;s sort of like releasing a herd of wild horses. Week  <br/>
2 is harder because that&#39;s when things need to start making sense ;-)  <br/>
So it&#39;s like rounding them back up again. Then the 3rd week  <br/>
everything is headed where it should go and week 4 is home free. :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - 50,000 words is a commonly-used cut-off BETWEEN novella and  <br/>
novel.<br/>
<br/>
Novella. A prose fiction longer than a short story but shorter than a  <br/>
novel. There is no standard definition of length, but since rules of  <br/>
thumb are sometimes handy, we might say that the short story ends at  <br/>
about 20,000 words, while the novel begins at about 50,000. Thus, the  <br/>
novella is a fictional work of about 20,000 to 50,000 words. Examples:<br/>
<br/>
Henry James, Daisy Miller<br/>
Robert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde<br/>
Henry James, Turn of the Screw<br/>
Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness<br/>
<br/>
So - 50,000 words could be considered a minimal length novel or a  <br/>
really long novella.<br/>
(Make it 50,001 words, if that makes it feel more &#39;honest&#39; to call it  <br/>
a novel &lt;BEG&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
There is lots of stuff on the NaNoWriMo website to do to get yourself  <br/>
all geared up for the November 1st start date, too.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie has just finished reading, &quot;No Plot, No Problem,&quot; a book about  <br/>
NaNoWriMo.<br/>
<br/>
She could not be MORE excited about writing her second novel! Too  <br/>
cool. And to think - we could be doing school-at-home - assigning her  <br/>
to write paragraphs or 5-paragraph essays. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
