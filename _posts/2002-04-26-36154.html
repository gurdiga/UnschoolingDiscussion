<div id="ygrps-yiv-576632519">I feel the calling to let everyone new to the list or any other list, know <br/>
that you <br/>
do not have to read every piece of email that appears on the list.<br/>
It is OK to only read whats addressed to you, or what appeals to<br/>
your interests.<br/>
DON&#39;T BE AFRAID TO HIT THE DELETE KEY!!!<br/>
<br/>
This is the secret to belonging to more than one list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145817452">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel when Robby won&#39;t<br/>
gravitate towards the computer.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why? If your son was in school, the district would be paying big bucks to<br/>
have the equipment available in an attempt to have him be computer literate<br/>
at age 7.  It is a big selling point for school districts.<br/>
<br/>
The computer is bringing the entire world into your child&#39;s space.  What a<br/>
wonderful gift.<br/>
