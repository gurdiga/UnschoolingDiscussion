<div id="ygrps-yiv-305993008">I am so frustrated and very unhappy with how I just responded to my son.<br/>
<br/>
I told him that there was a local homeschooling for little kids.  That the<br/>
kids would be from his bother&#39;s age (2) up to his age (7) and it would be at<br/>
a playground.<br/>
<br/>
His response?  &quot;I&#39;m not going.&quot;  Uhm, you are 7 and can&#39;t stay home by<br/>
yourself.  I&#39;d love to leave him home whenever it&#39;s something he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to do, but hey, he&#39;s only 7.  Can&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
So, I lost it.  This is the latest in a long line of &quot;I&#39;m not going&quot; or &quot;No,<br/>
you can&#39;t.&quot; responses from him.  Lately it seems like I&#39;m spending a lot of<br/>
time making things that have to be done fun for him.  Like, we have to go to<br/>
the bank.  I can&#39;t leave him home so....And money is tight, this is<br/>
something that CAN&#39;T be put off.  But I have to schedule a whole day&#39;s<br/>
activities, some costing money, just to get him out the door without a<br/>
fight.  I totally blew up at him.  Told him I was sick of him making<br/>
decisions for everyone.  Sick for example of having to wait around until he<br/>
wakes up at noon and missing things that his brother would enjoy.  Sick of<br/>
bending over backwards when I shouldn&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Course, then the really bad thing--said I was thinking of sending him to<br/>
school next year &#39;cause I was tired of dealing with his negative attitude.<br/>
Uhm, can I rewind that part?  Please?<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t mind making necessary things--like the bank, and the grocery<br/>
store, etc--fun.  But up until Friday we didn&#39;t have a car and it was a BIG<br/>
DEAL to get this stuff done.  Just the way it was.  Now we have a car and<br/>
I&#39;ll have more flexibility.  The stuff that used to be a big deal can be<br/>
handled around all the other stuff and be just a blip.<br/>
<br/>
But I just don&#39;t know what to do or say.  Hey, we are a family.  Sometimes<br/>
we have to go do things we would rather not so that others can do it.  It&#39;ll<br/>
get better when he&#39;s older and CAN stay home, but not now.  Should we all<br/>
have to sit around and watch him watch cartoons?  If we ARE home and there<br/>
isn&#39;t something that someone else wants to do, fine.  But if there is?<br/>
<br/>
I either need some magic words to explain to him that we all need a turn or<br/>
some magic words to make it ok with me to never get to have one or give one<br/>
to his brother.  (And yes, I realize that at 2 his brother doesn&#39;t &quot;want to<br/>
go&quot; to the playgroup.  IT&#39;s my idea and schedule.  But his brother WOULD<br/>
enjoy it and why shouldn&#39;t we go?)<br/>

<br/>
My first thought was it wasn&#39;t a way to make him have higher regard for his <br/>
brother, using the baby as an excuse for making him go somewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
But I do understand. I see your point and his too.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when Holly or Marty has been hesitant to go to something like a <br/>
play session, I drive by and park and let them watch a while.  And either <br/>
they&#39;ll say &quot;Let&#39;s go over for a while,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want to.&quot;   Sometimes <br/>
we&#39;ve gone to do one errand (get cash, something from the grocery store) and <br/>
then back by and sometimes someone they like is there or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could arrange to take someone else with you to insure there&#39;s a kid <br/>
he likes, and if the two of them meet other kids great, and if not, they <br/>
still play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136668970">I don&#39;t think it was a bad mommy moment - it was life. He is a kid that<br/>
is learning to push buttons because of his disappointment in the<br/>
situation at hand. Simply fact of the matter is sometimes we all have to<br/>
do errands we don&#39;t want to do. When we do, we can pout, be nasty to<br/>
others, or make the most of it by taking along a different activity to<br/>
occupy ourselves with. If we are nasty, that choice of behavior earns no<br/>
priviledges of anything later he wants to do. If he pouts, ten as long<br/>
as he isn&#39;t nasty, he is just making his time there miserable for<br/>
himself. But if he chooses to be occupied by a book, game or other<br/>
manipulative or toy, then he earns the priviledge of doing an activity<br/>
he chooses at a more convientent or appropriate time. This is called<br/>
family.and it gets hectic and unbearable at times. <br/>
 <br/>
The choice of his behavior is his to make - the consequences of his<br/>
choices need to be clear and absolute and most consistent. Choose to be<br/>
ugly = lose preiviledges, choose to be polite = earns rewards or extra<br/>
priviledges. Give him the power and make the consequences strong or<br/>
detestable enough to make him WANT to choose proper behavior. <br/>
 <br/>
HTH!<br/>

First, I would tell him what you told us!  You had a bad mommy moment and <br/>
said things you didn&#39;t mean, then specifically tell him what those things <br/>
were.  I agree with you, you can&#39;t always stop life for an unwilling child.  <br/>
I would state that we are going to the park and he can bring something to <br/>
occupy himself if he doesn&#39;t want to play wih the other kids or equipment.  <br/>
I also wouldn&#39;t ive him such advanced notice.  Sometimes, I think it&#39;s best <br/>
to say, we are going to the park in 30 minutes, so if you&#39;d like for me to <br/>
help you something to do in case you get bored, I&#39;d be happy to help you.  <br/>
And then do it.  If he chooses not to bring anything and gets bored, he&#39;ll <br/>
remember next time.  Although I wonder if he might not have fun while he&#39;s <br/>
there anyway, despite his protests. :)<br/>
<br/>
Life happens and that doesn&#39;t stop just because we have kids.  I think we <br/>
need to be able to set our limits and boundries while helping our children <br/>
find peaceful options when they might prefer to do things otherwise.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640101526">How can consequences to one&#39;s choice of behavior cause nontrust issues?<br/>
If a child knows that hitting a friend will result in that friend not<br/>
wanting to be around him - that is a consequence of his behavior choice.<br/>
If my child throws a ball at me in anger, and I take the ball away then<br/>
he knows that throwing an item out of anger will result in losing access<br/>
to that item until it is played with properly. If my child willfully<br/>
misbehaves because he needs to attend a trip to a park so his sibling<br/>
can enjoy some bonding time,  and that choice of his misbehavior causes<br/>
him to lose his time to play at his friend&#39;s later on.how does that<br/>
build mistrust?<br/>
 <br/>
And what exactly would the unschooling parent do to a willfully<br/>
misbehaving child?<br/>
<br/>
The context of my statements are made entirely in an uninformed<br/>
viewpoint - please read it as me being inquisitive and wanting to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109706288">**How can consequences to one&#39;s choice of behavior cause nontrust issues?<br/>
If a child knows that hitting a friend will result in that friend not<br/>
wanting to be around him - that is a consequence of his behavior choice.***<br/>
<br/>
True, that is a consequence of his behavior. There are other possibilities.  <br/>
One being that he is told that hitting people is not a way to keep friends.  <br/>
I&#39;d discuss the reason he chose to hit, if possible in front of his friend, <br/>
and ask if he might think of another way to solve the problem so they can <br/>
get back to being friendly.  I definitely wouldn&#39;t leave him to his chosen <br/>
devices and lose the chance to learn peaceful conflict resolution skills and <br/>
having friends.<br/>
<br/>
**If my child throws a ball at me in anger, and I take the ball away then<br/>
he knows that throwing an item out of anger will result in losing access<br/>
to that item until it is played with properly.**<br/>
<br/>
The key here is &quot;until it is played with properly&quot;.  Honestly, if the ball <br/>
is taken away, he doesn&#39;t have the chance to play with it, properly or not.  <br/>
You might try showing him how to play with the ball without harming others <br/>
and if he is angry, looking at the reasoning behind his anger and addressing <br/>
that.  Hitting you with a ball is either an accident or a display of <br/>
emotion.  I&#39;d forgive the accidents and address the emotions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; If my child willfully<br/>
misbehaves because he needs to attend a trip to a park so his sibling<br/>
can enjoy some bonding time,  and that choice of his misbehavior causes<br/>
him to lose his time to play at his friend&#39;s later on.how does that<br/>
build mistrust?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because the punishment has nothing to do with the *crime*.  They rarely ever <br/>
do.  Why not offer him something to take along to the park to keep himself <br/>
busy?  Offer to play with HIM while his brother or sister plays with the <br/>
other kids.  I might also offer to do something of his choosing before or <br/>
after the playdate so everyone has the chance to do something they want to <br/>
do.  He is more likely to be accomodating of the playdate if he knows he can <br/>
choose something HE likes to do before or after.  If his emotions behind his <br/>
actions are addressed and acknowledged and alternatives suggested he has the <br/>
ability to learn problem solving and *trusts* that you are with him, not <br/>
against him.  He may not like the option still, but at least he can now <br/>
trust that Mom cares about his needs and wants and will try to accomodate <br/>
him while still following through with the task at hand.<br/>
<br/>
***And what exactly would the unschooling parent do to a willfully<br/>
misbehaving child?***<br/>
<br/>
This unschooling mom would do all of the above while loving, listening, <br/>
accomodating when possible or offering something desireable afterwards as an <br/>
alternative and never forget HUMOR!  Laughter breaks up the worst of times!<br/>
<br/>
***The context of my statements are made entirely in an uninformed<br/>
viewpoint - please read it as me being inquisitive and wanting to learn.***<br/>
<br/>
I find that a highly respectable trait!  I commend you on looking for and be <br/>
open to better and more peaceful possibilities!  Slowly, as you begin to <br/>
incorporate new strategies, you will see amazing changes and progress and <br/>
see your children opening up and behaving in ways you neve thought possible!<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Joy!<br/>

gift or monetary or tangent thing as a reward. ***<br/>
<br/>
Take throwing a ball at you for the example I&#39;m giving here.....<br/>
<br/>
When he throws the ball at you and you take it away from him, the <br/>
consequence of *your* action of removing the ball from his possesion is that <br/>
*he* can&#39;t play with it.  He hasn&#39;t learned anything other than the fact <br/>
that you are bigger and better at taking things away.  He needs to <br/>
understand that throwing a ball at someone hurts.  *His* consequence of his <br/>
actions is seeing you hurt.  If you offer a safe alternative to his reason <br/>
for throwing the ball and model safe ball throwing for him and with him, his <br/>
reward is learning that he can learn peaceful outlets for his emotions and <br/>
safe ball playing while still feeling peace with mom.  He trusts that you <br/>
love him and respect his feelings and will help him resolve his mistakes.  <br/>
Taking the ball away doesn&#39;t resolve the fact that he hit you with the ball. <br/>
  It only resolves the fact that he won&#39;t get to do it again...for the <br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that flows and makes sense!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526500611">I suppose my answers were too short to accommodate my full explanation.<br/>
I would never have left the consequences/behavior with the single action<br/>
of, for instance, taking the ball away. I didn&#39;t expand to include the<br/>
rest of similar actions as I think I assumed that would have been<br/>
natuarally what would have occurred IN ADDITION to the taking of the<br/>
ball. <br/>
 <br/>
I agree with everything you expanded on. I have raised my children with<br/>
the thought process that every action we take, there is an equal and<br/>
opposite reaction. Negative choices are rewarded with negative<br/>
consequences. Not punishment but logical consequences. <br/>
 <br/>
In the problem with the child that is behaving in a negative manner to<br/>
things that a family must do to survive and thrive.he is making the time<br/>
for his sibling to go to the park an unmanageable time for the entire<br/>
family. An equal reversal and logical consequence would be that he<br/>
forfeits HIS time that would be spent with a friend that day. I still do<br/>
not see this as a punishment.he used his brother&#39;s time to go to the<br/>
play date by being negative and ugly. So in exchange for mom spending<br/>
the effort to let him engage in his play date, he needs to forfeit it.<br/>
 <br/>
I would have thought that all the things suggested by you below would<br/>
have already been done.the mother already said, &quot;Lately it seems like<br/>
I&#39;m spending a lot of time making things that have to be done fun for<br/>
him.&quot;  I took this to mean she had already tried the negotiating of<br/>
terms of play (your suggestion) and the well, find something to take<br/>
with you, and the other logical things. If she did and the son was still<br/>
rebuking going, at what point to you make him accountable for his<br/>
feelings and acting out about them? <br/>
 <br/>
I do want to apologize as I reread the original message - I<br/>
misunderstood her statement regarding the sending him to public school<br/>
next year part. I read it as though she THOUGHT it and when I reread it<br/>
just now, I read it correctly. I would address this as being most<br/>
profusely apologetic and explaining how frustrated you were as a mom<br/>
needing to balance the needs of her kids and meeting the stress point of<br/>
his choice to act up about going. Discussing how his choice to<br/>
misbehaves makes it difficult for you to meet his little brothers need<br/>
to socialize and you might even ask him some thoughts on how it could be<br/>
made better next time so that he might enjoy the time better. I<br/>
NATURALLY would have assumed that one would have tried to find the cause<br/>
for such behavior. I personally rarely need to delve into the mind of my<br/>
4 year old to get him to talk about his needs that aren&#39;t being met. I<br/>
AM NOT WITH EXPERIENCE in the older child&#39;s needs and frustrations yet<br/>
so I can only offer what I think I would do. But being an experienced<br/>
childcare provider for 12 years of in home care.I kept many children for<br/>
5-10 years each.that is what I would do.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope I didn&#39;t offend anyone - I still am a believer in consequences of<br/>
actions. I just don&#39;t think I expanded enough on my suggestions that<br/>
perhaps it was read mistakenly as reward good behavior/punish bad.and<br/>
that, I don&#39;t believe in.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; ***And what exactly would the unschooling parent do to a willfully<br/>
misbehaving child?*** &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Exactly&quot; makes the question seem snarky to me.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I neither use the word &quot;willfully&quot; nor &quot;misbehaving.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Schools and parents used to be advised and instructed how to break a child&#39;s <br/>
will.<br/>
I do NOT want to &quot;break my child&#39;s will.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Willfully&quot; means &quot;because he wants to.&quot;<br/>
Why would a child want to do something mean or bad?<br/>
My kids don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that they never did, it&#39;s that when they did we found better ways, <br/>
together, for them to express their frustration or disappointment or <br/>
whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents punish children for behaving rationally to bad parental <br/>
behavior.  It&#39;s a shame.  It has gone on a long time, but any family wanting <br/>
to stop can stop.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom promises something and breaks her promise and the kids <br/>
understandably get angry or say something about it, how often are kids <br/>
punished instead of apologized to and appeased?  How many parents express <br/>
remorse for their own bad behavior toward their children, yet don&#39;t set an <br/>
example of how to act when they&#39;ve screwed up?<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;behaving&quot; isn&#39;t the opposite of &quot;misbehaving,&quot; except where &quot;behave&quot; has <br/>
become shorthand for &quot;act the way I would like for you to or you&#39;ll be in <br/>
trouble.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is behaving all the time, every time they decide how to wipe their <br/>
nose or where to sit.  How can on &quot;mis&quot;behave?  By not matching a <br/>
pre-conceived pattern decided before they were born?  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;&lt;&lt; ***And what exactly would the unschooling parent do to a willfully<br/>
misbehaving child?*** &gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the question should just be &quot;How would you treat someone you really <br/>
loved&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I know it sounds irritating to people whose kids are older and who are new to <br/>
this whole principle/respect business, who have lived by rules and schedules, <br/>
but my kids don&#39;t misbehave.  They&#39;re honest and helpful and considerate.  <br/>
It&#39;s not because they&#39;re afraid they&#39;ll get in trouble because they don&#39;t.  <br/>
It&#39;s because they choose to be honest and helpful and considerate, because <br/>
they see the direct value of it and the immediate usefulness and goodness of <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t happen overnight, but it CAN happen.  And if it can&#39;t happen with a <br/>
kid who&#39;s belt-trained, or 13 and really defiant (I would defy mean <br/>
rules-wielding parents who didn&#39;t think much of me too), that does NOT mean <br/>
it can&#39;t happen with families here whose kids are younger, who haven&#39;t been <br/>
told that bedtime and obedience are what will get them into college and/or <br/>
heaven.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246664801">(a little humor here) I would not have  taken the ball away from him -<br/>
he just threw it at me so it was already in my possession therefore the<br/>
consequence is still logical.I do not like balls that are thrown at me<br/>
in anger and my action would be to put this ball outside so it doesn&#39;t<br/>
hit me again. <br/>
 <br/>
I see your point and position. In my 4 year old - I know he is aware of<br/>
the consequences of a thrown-in-anger ball. He KNOWS that hurts and if<br/>
he  just threw it out of anger, the ball would be put outside, &quot;where it<br/>
won&#39;t hurt me again.&quot; And then we&#39;d sit and talk. And discuss<br/>
rationally: 1) what is bothering him; 2) a solution for what is<br/>
bothering him; and 3) what actions he can take next time his feelings<br/>
are in this realm of emotions.and what actions he would choose to not do<br/>
again.<br/>

If this scenario happened at my home, what I mentioned about would occur<br/>
- he wouldn&#39;t be punished for throwing the ball in anger or hitting or<br/>
hurting me. He wouldn&#39;t be grounded from the ball. It would be outside<br/>
should he want to play with it again.<br/>

**I don&#39;t see anything I suggested as punishment - I see them as logical<br/>
consequences to his misbehavior - and the rewards are again based on the<br/>
system of earning the priviledge of something he would like to do.not a<br/>
gift or monetary or tangent thing as a reward. ***<br/>
<br/>
Take throwing a ball at you for the example I&#39;m giving here.....<br/>
<br/>
When he throws the ball at you and you take it away from him, the <br/>
consequence of *your* action of removing the ball from his possesion is<br/>
that <br/>
*he* can&#39;t play with it.  He hasn&#39;t learned anything other than the fact<br/>
<br/>
that you are bigger and better at taking things away.  He needs to <br/>
understand that throwing a ball at someone hurts.  *His* consequence of<br/>
his <br/>
actions is seeing you hurt.  If you offer a safe alternative to his<br/>
reason <br/>
for throwing the ball and model safe ball throwing for him and with him,<br/>
his <br/>
reward is learning that he can learn peaceful outlets for his emotions<br/>
and <br/>
safe ball playing while still feeling peace with mom.  He trusts that<br/>
you <br/>
love him and respect his feelings and will help him resolve his<br/>
mistakes.  <br/>
Taking the ball away doesn&#39;t resolve the fact that he hit you with the<br/>
ball. <br/>
  It only resolves the fact that he won&#39;t get to do it again...for the <br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that flows and makes sense!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-65692316">If he acts negatively and argues about getting ready to go to younger<br/>
brother&#39;s play date.and he&#39;s been given choices of other material to<br/>
work/play on while there, offered to play with him there myself, and all<br/>
the other things that the mom said she tried to do to make this a fun<br/>
outing. AND the 7 year old is still acting up and saying he is NOT going<br/>
and making it a difficult time for me as the mom and the other child to<br/>
go to this play date, then he is using up all my energy that I would<br/>
need to help him make his play date at his choosing later on. I<br/>
naturally wouldn&#39;t want to make the effort for his play date a happy<br/>
occurrence if he chooses to make his brother&#39;s a wretched affair. <br/>
 <br/>
The reward for attending a brother&#39;s play date without making it a<br/>
horrid hassle? If I HAVE to label it a reward - then the reward would be<br/>
that I as the now unhassled mom would love to make the effort it took to<br/>
make his choice of a play date with his friend&#39;s a festive affair. <br/>

&lt;&lt; An equal reversal and logical consequence would be that he<br/>
forfeits HIS time that would be spent with a friend that day. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is conditioning.  It&#39;s even out of style among psychologists.<br/>
It&#39;s for rat training, not for helping people grow happy and healthy.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of children more as trees and less as bad rats, the best you can <br/>
do for them is provide good water and soil and keep the weeds away and let <br/>
the sun shine on them.  Don&#39;t let cats scratch their bark up.  Don&#39;t kick <br/>
them, and don&#39;t climb in them until they&#39;re big and strong.<br/>
<br/>
If your son&#39;s development into a bright, happy and compassionate person <br/>
becomes your primary goal, you will see that playing with his friend might be <br/>
the best time of his whole week, and maybe the time when he learns the most <br/>
and has the best chance to practice his interpersonal skills.  Taking that <br/>
time away from him could cause some real loss, and some true resentment which <br/>
will NOT make it easier to get him to cooperate with you about the park next <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I still do<br/>
not see this as a punishment.he used his brother&#39;s time to go to the<br/>
play date by being negative and ugly. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think of your child as ugly?<br/>
Do you think of his honest expressions as negative?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So in exchange for mom spending<br/>
the effort to let him engage in his play date, he needs to forfeit it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What do you forfeit when you make a bad judgment call as a mom then?<br/>
If you do something that causes them grief, how do you impose consequences on <br/>
yourself so you will do better next time?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If she did and the son was still<br/>
rebuking going, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BUZZWORD ALERT.<br/>
<br/>
Rebuke?<br/>
As people rebuke Satan?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &quot;rebuke&quot; going.  You rebuke a person.<br/>
You can avoid going, or balk at going.<br/>
<br/>
-=-at what point to you make him accountable for his<br/>
feelings and acting out about them? -=-<br/>
<br/>
People are accountable for their actions.  Moms more than anyone.<br/>
Accountable for his feelings?<br/>
Is he sinning in his heart?<br/>
<br/>
-=I personally rarely need to delve into the mind of my<br/>
4 year old to get him to talk about his needs that aren&#39;t being met. I<br/>
AM NOT WITH EXPERIENCE in the older child&#39;s needs and frustrations yet<br/>
so I can only offer what I think I would do. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there was a word missing there.  I didn&#39;t get the second part.<br/>
<br/>
What kids SAY they&#39;re unhappy about isn&#39;t always what they&#39;re really unhappy <br/>
about.  Sometimes they say very little, and they DO need someone to help them <br/>
delve into what they&#39;re feeling and needing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579074804">I used the term &quot;exactly&quot; because I wanted to read an exact example - I<br/>
did NOT mean it &quot;snarky&quot; and I apologize if you read it as such. I wrote<br/>
I was inexperienced and wanted to read everyone&#39;s explanations.and<br/>
hence, the term &quot;exactly&quot; meaning it literally - an exact explanation of<br/>
specific examples. I did not join this list to harold the positiveness<br/>
of schooling.I joined to learn. Please don&#39;t be so defensive without<br/>
asking first the literal meaning behind the language.<br/>
 <br/>
This is a 7 year old child that was told he was going to a park so his<br/>
brother could get some socializing time in. He tells mom no, he&#39;s not<br/>
going and mom is at her wit&#39;s end because he is doing this more and<br/>
more. She said she already tried making things fun for him it was<br/>
wearing her thin. I ASSUME she&#39;s already tried to address the cause of<br/>
the behavior with him. Maybe I assumed too much. I, again, apologized<br/>
for that. <br/>
 <br/>
I expect my kids to be well behaved - meaning I want them to choose<br/>
behavior that is positive, helpful, considerate. If they choose to<br/>
misbehave, which is anything that isn&#39;t positive, helpful or<br/>
considerate, then they will &quot;reap what they sow&quot; - the logical<br/>
consequence of their actions. Not punishment in my eyes. <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; ***And what exactly would the unschooling parent do to a willfully<br/>
misbehaving child?*** &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Exactly&quot; makes the question seem snarky to me.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I neither use the word &quot;willfully&quot; nor &quot;misbehaving.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Schools and parents used to be advised and instructed how to break a<br/>
child&#39;s <br/>
will.<br/>
I do NOT want to &quot;break my child&#39;s will.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Willfully&quot; means &quot;because he wants to.&quot;<br/>
Why would a child want to do something mean or bad?<br/>
My kids don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that they never did, it&#39;s that when they did we found better<br/>
ways, <br/>
together, for them to express their frustration or disappointment or <br/>
whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents punish children for behaving rationally to bad parental <br/>
behavior.  It&#39;s a shame.  It has gone on a long time, but any family<br/>
wanting <br/>
to stop can stop.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom promises something and breaks her promise and the kids <br/>
understandably get angry or say something about it, how often are kids <br/>
punished instead of apologized to and appeased?  How many parents<br/>
express <br/>
remorse for their own bad behavior toward their children, yet don&#39;t set<br/>
an <br/>
example of how to act when they&#39;ve screwed up?<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;behaving&quot; isn&#39;t the opposite of &quot;misbehaving,&quot; except where<br/>
&quot;behave&quot; has <br/>
become shorthand for &quot;act the way I would like for you to or you&#39;ll be<br/>
in <br/>
trouble.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is behaving all the time, every time they decide how to wipe<br/>
their <br/>
nose or where to sit.  How can on &quot;mis&quot;behave?  By not matching a <br/>
pre-conceived pattern decided before they were born?  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;&lt;&lt; ***And what exactly would the unschooling parent do to a willfully<br/>
misbehaving child?*** &gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the question should just be &quot;How would you treat someone you<br/>
really <br/>
loved&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I know it sounds irritating to people whose kids are older and who are<br/>
new to <br/>
this whole principle/respect business, who have lived by rules and<br/>
schedules, <br/>
but my kids don&#39;t misbehave.  They&#39;re honest and helpful and<br/>
considerate.  <br/>
It&#39;s not because they&#39;re afraid they&#39;ll get in trouble because they<br/>
don&#39;t.  <br/>
It&#39;s because they choose to be honest and helpful and considerate,<br/>
because <br/>
they see the direct value of it and the immediate usefulness and<br/>
goodness of <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t happen overnight, but it CAN happen.  And if it can&#39;t happen<br/>
with a <br/>
kid who&#39;s belt-trained, or 13 and really defiant (I would defy mean <br/>
rules-wielding parents who didn&#39;t think much of me too), that does NOT<br/>
mean <br/>
it can&#39;t happen with families here whose kids are younger, who haven&#39;t<br/>
been <br/>
told that bedtime and obedience are what will get them into college<br/>
and/or <br/>
heaven.  <br/>

have apologized many times to my 2 year old and my 4 year old and my<br/>
husband and all the people I have wronged. I recognize my mistakes as<br/>
often as I can and make necessary adjustments to my surroundings and<br/>
attitude and thought processes to not make the mistake again. <br/>
 <br/>
Rebuking - so I choose the wrong wording here. It&#39;s called a mistake. I<br/>
will not make that mistake again - I see the logical consequence of an<br/>
ill-choosen word cause angst in others so I won&#39;t make that mistake a<br/>
second time. I will choose instead to look up the words I think I want<br/>
to use before using it. You were correct - the word I meant to use was<br/>
balk.<br/>
 <br/>
I do not let problems with my children go long enough to have to search<br/>
for the answers to behavior problems. I don&#39;t think my kids have any<br/>
problems with the way the choose to behave. They are sweet, thoughtful,<br/>
considerate, caring people and when they display a behavior that doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem happy or comfortable to them, we see what it is and work them<br/>
through it. I haven&#39;t hit a problem yet that we haven&#39;t been able to<br/>
clear up. My kids are bright, energetic, inquisitive and sweet.<br/>
 <br/>
My kids are 2 and 4 - I have not experienced a child of 7 years yet - so<br/>
the problems more associated with that age range are unfamiliar to me. I<br/>
was reiterating my inexperience with this age group.<br/>

<br/>
This is conditioning.  It&#39;s even out of style among psychologists.<br/>
It&#39;s for rat training, not for helping people grow happy and healthy.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of children more as trees and less as bad rats, the best<br/>
you can <br/>
do for them is provide good water and soil and keep the weeds away and<br/>
let <br/>
the sun shine on them.  Don&#39;t let cats scratch their bark up.  Don&#39;t<br/>
kick <br/>
them, and don&#39;t climb in them until they&#39;re big and strong.<br/>
<br/>
If your son&#39;s development into a bright, happy and compassionate person <br/>
becomes your primary goal, you will see that playing with his friend<br/>
might be <br/>
the best time of his whole week, and maybe the time when he learns the<br/>
most <br/>
and has the best chance to practice his interpersonal skills.  Taking<br/>
that <br/>
time away from him could cause some real loss, and some true resentment<br/>
which <br/>
will NOT make it easier to get him to cooperate with you about the park<br/>
next <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I still do<br/>
not see this as a punishment.he used his brother&#39;s time to go to the<br/>
play date by being negative and ugly. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think of your child as ugly?<br/>
Do you think of his honest expressions as negative?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So in exchange for mom spending<br/>
the effort to let him engage in his play date, he needs to forfeit it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What do you forfeit when you make a bad judgment call as a mom then?<br/>
If you do something that causes them grief, how do you impose<br/>
consequences on <br/>
yourself so you will do better next time?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If she did and the son was still<br/>
rebuking going, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BUZZWORD ALERT.<br/>
<br/>
Rebuke?<br/>
As people rebuke Satan?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &quot;rebuke&quot; going.  You rebuke a person.<br/>
You can avoid going, or balk at going.<br/>
<br/>
-=-at what point to you make him accountable for his<br/>
feelings and acting out about them? -=-<br/>
<br/>
People are accountable for their actions.  Moms more than anyone.<br/>
Accountable for his feelings?<br/>
Is he sinning in his heart?<br/>
<br/>
-=I personally rarely need to delve into the mind of my<br/>
4 year old to get him to talk about his needs that aren&#39;t being met. I<br/>
AM NOT WITH EXPERIENCE in the older child&#39;s needs and frustrations yet<br/>
so I can only offer what I think I would do. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there was a word missing there.  I didn&#39;t get the second part.<br/>
<br/>
What kids SAY they&#39;re unhappy about isn&#39;t always what they&#39;re really<br/>
unhappy <br/>
about.  Sometimes they say very little, and they DO need someone to help<br/>
them <br/>
delve into what they&#39;re feeling and needing.<br/>

&lt;&lt; AND the 7 year old is still acting up and saying he is NOT going<br/>
and making it a difficult time for me as the mom and the other child to<br/>
go to this play date, then he is using up all my energy that I would<br/>
need to help him make his play date at his choosing later on.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the point is if you&#39;re not figuring WHY the 7 year old is unhappy and <br/>
&quot;acting&quot; the way he is acting, you&#39;re part of the problem. Depriving him is <br/>
not going to be a solution.  Then he&#39;ll be unhappy AND deprived.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not &quot;using up your energy.&quot;  You&#39;re not apportioning your energy wisely.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I<br/>
naturally wouldn&#39;t want to make the effort for his play date a happy<br/>
occurrence if he chooses to make his brother&#39;s a wretched affair. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t sound like love.  It sounds like resentment and control. <br/>
&quot;A wretched affair&quot;?<br/>
I have never thought such words about my children and their lives, let alone <br/>
written them down for othes.  <br/>
<br/>
This is some serious negativity you have going in your visions of children&#39;s <br/>
motives and actions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I naturally wouldn&#39;t want to make the effort for his play date a happy<br/>
occurrence ...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I &quot;naturally&quot; want to make effort for my kids.  I had <br/>
children by choice.  I want to do a better job at parenting than my mom did.  <br/>
I want to do the best I can do for these people, because what I give them <br/>
they will pass on to others.  It&#39;s an investment in the future, and in the <br/>
world around us.  If I give them pissiness, they will be pissy.  If I give <br/>
them resentment, they will be resentful.  If I give them patience, they will <br/>
be patient.  I see it work.  They ARE patient.  They are thoughtful.  They&#39;re <br/>
compassionate.<br/>
<br/>
Why I want to make an effort to make ALL their days happy occurrences is <br/>
because their happiness and their peace and their comfort is very high on my <br/>
list of priorities.  And when I had a broken leg, they were pretty <br/>
considerate of me.  And when I&#39;m just tired, they&#39;ll get me things, and do <br/>
things for me.  Because when they&#39;re just tired, I do for them, willingly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&lt;&lt;I<br/>
naturally wouldn&#39;t want to make the effort for his play date a happy<br/>
occurrence if he chooses to make his brother&#39;s a wretched affair. &gt;&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re an adult and he&#39;s seven.  Are you expecting him to have your level of <br/>
understanding, or are you acting on a seven year old&#39;s level?  <br/>
<br/>
Just as a seven year old should have more responsibility in a situation with <br/>
a two year old, and more understanding, an adult should have more <br/>
responsibility and understanding than a seven year old.<br/>

I don&#39;t need to ask the literal meaning behind English.  I know it pretty <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
What exactly did you think I meant?<br/>
That&#39;s different from &quot;What did you think I meant?&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s different in tone.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I expect my kids to be well behaved&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I expect mine to be kids, but we have always talked through things and they <br/>
don&#39;t feel ignored or managed or controlled, and yet they are positive, <br/>
helpful, and considerate.  They act better than other kids their age.  That&#39;s <br/>
not just my opinion.  Other kids their age say so.  Adults say so.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If they choose to<br/>
misbehave, which is anything that isn&#39;t positive, helpful or<br/>
considerate, then they will &quot;reap what they sow&quot; - &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is not loving or friendly.  This is vengeful.<br/>
<br/>
Children don&#39;t &quot;choose&quot; to misbehave in many cases, especially the little <br/>
ones.  They are frustrated and end up doing things they regret, or losing <br/>
control of their emotions.  That&#39;s not choice, that&#39;s often a direct result <br/>
of a parent not paying attention to their needs for attention, food, warmth, <br/>
touch, rest, peace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885375026">***Negative choices are rewarded with negative<br/>
consequences. Not punishment but logical consequences.***<br/>
<br/>
Wow.  That&#39;s a pretty powerful statement filled with mistrust and <br/>
misunderstanding.  How is taking away a ball from a child for throwing it at <br/>
somone a reward?  What is being rewarded?  It is a logical consequence in a <br/>
punishing frame of mind.<br/>
<br/>
***In the problem with the child that is behaving in a negative manner to<br/>
things that a family must do to survive and thrive.he is making the time<br/>
for his sibling to go to the park an unmanageable time for the entire<br/>
family. An equal reversal and logical consequence would be that he<br/>
forfeits HIS time that would be spent with a friend that day.***<br/>
<br/>
Two wrongs don&#39;t make it right.  Especially for the child.  In this case, he <br/>
is being rewarded for his negative behavior.  It creates the possibility of <br/>
an endless cycle.....He makes life miserable for the family, so Mom or Dad <br/>
makes his life miserable.  Well, next time he&#39;ll make SURE he is even worse <br/>
to get you back.  I&#39;ve been there.  I have seven children.  It happens.  <br/>
When children need attention and cannot find positive ways to get it, they <br/>
will seek out negative behaviors that are &quot;rewarded&quot; with increased <br/>
attention.  Even if it is negative.<br/>
<br/>
***I still do not see this as a punishment.he used his brother&#39;s time to go <br/>
to the<br/>
play date by being negative and ugly. So in exchange for mom spending<br/>
the effort to let him engage in his play date, he needs to forfeit it.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not following the logic in this.  Isn&#39;t the desired result a happy, <br/>
trusting child???  Or is it a mother who &#39;got even&#39;??<br/>
<br/>
***I would have thought that all the things suggested by you below would<br/>
have already been done.the mother already said, &quot;Lately it seems like<br/>
I&#39;m spending a lot of time making things that have to be done fun for<br/>
him.&quot;  I took this to mean she had already tried the negotiating of<br/>
terms of play (your suggestion) and the well, find something to take<br/>
with you, and the other logical things. If she did and the son was still<br/>
rebuking going, at what point to you make him accountable for his<br/>
feelings and acting out about them? ***<br/>
<br/>
In my own experience, a child who does not respond to the suggestions I <br/>
mentioned is a child who *needs* positive attention, patience and <br/>
understanding.  Children *want* to please their parents and be happy.  At <br/>
that point, I would be looking at *my* past and present behaviors and how <br/>
they are affecting my child.  I would look for inconsistancy and negativity <br/>
in my actions.  Am I acting in peaceful trusting and loving ways, or am I <br/>
expecting and modeling negative, distrusting, and unloving behaviors.  It&#39;s <br/>
not an easy thing to confront but it often reveals so much if we are open <br/>
and honest with ourselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536444287">**I&#39;ve been doing this and it seems like it is escalating.  I&#39;ve even paid <br/>
him<br/>
money to go along with erands we have to run.  I was bothered by it for a<br/>
while, but frankly, I treat myself at moments like that.  I just can&#39;t<br/>
afford him anymore.***<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  (whispering kindly) maybe that&#39;s the problem.  Money makes us all <br/>
greedy at times. He&#39;s probably expecting a raise now. &lt;bg&gt;  Not to pick on <br/>
you but this is a perfect example of how rewards fail.<br/>
<br/>
***&gt; He may not like the option still, but at least he can now<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;trust that Mom cares about his needs and wants and will try to accomodate<br/>
&gt;him while still following through with the task at hand.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I honestly HAVE been working on this.  I just don&#39;t like the way I sometimes<br/>
do it.  I&#39;ve pointed out that I&#39;ve trucked along with him on things I didn&#39;t<br/>
want to do, just so he could do them, too.  But, true as that is, when I<br/>
bring it up at moments like that it seems like guilt.***<br/>
<br/>
You hit the nail on the head.  Naturally, we feel guilty when we see that <br/>
our previous ways don&#39;t work.  The key is to let go of the guilt so you can <br/>
move on to better days.  It takes time to break old habits.  For you and <br/>
him.  Give yourself time.  Breath.  Rub your bloomin&#39; belly, literally <br/>
&lt;BWG&gt;!  And give HIM time, patience and do everything in your power to be <br/>
understanding.  This will pass and your efforts will be rewarded in the most <br/>
beautiful yet intangible ways.  A happy, peaceful, cooperative little boy!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991522249">Again, this appears to be about you and your energy and comfort levels.  Not <br/>
about addressing your sons and his needs.  To truly live and understand <br/>
peaceful, positive, gentle parenting, you need to look at what you are <br/>
trying to achieve with this thought/action process.  What you have described <br/>
below is punishment.  He cannot use up your energy.  You choose to let the <br/>
situation escalate to the point that peace is denied in favor of &#39;winning&#39;.  <br/>
If the goal is a peaceful child, then the battles have to stop.  As the <br/>
adult, that process would naturally begin with you and gradually reflect in <br/>
your child.<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer<br/>
<br/>
If he acts negatively and argues about getting ready to go to younger<br/>
brother&#39;s play date.and he&#39;s been given choices of other material to<br/>
work/play on while there, offered to play with him there myself, and all<br/>
the other things that the mom said she tried to do to make this a fun<br/>
outing. AND the 7 year old is still acting up and saying he is NOT going<br/>
and making it a difficult time for me as the mom and the other child to<br/>
go to this play date, then he is using up all my energy that I would<br/>
need to help him make his play date at his choosing later on. I<br/>
naturally wouldn&#39;t want to make the effort for his play date a happy<br/>
occurrence if he chooses to make his brother&#39;s a wretched affair.<br/>
<br/>
The reward for attending a brother&#39;s play date without making it a<br/>
horrid hassle? If I HAVE to label it a reward - then the reward would be<br/>
that I as the now unhassled mom would love to make the effort it took to<br/>
make his choice of a play date with his friend&#39;s a festive affair.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192202579">***I told him that there was a local homeschooling for little kids.  That<br/>
the<br/>
kids would be from his bother&#39;s age (2) up to his age (7) and it would be<br/>
at<br/>
a playground.<br/>
 <br/>
His response?  &quot;I&#39;m not going.&quot;  ***<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was, was this play date so important to the two year old<br/>
that it was worth all this pain and guilt?  <br/>
<br/>
My second thought was, it&#39;s a very bad idea to tell kids there are things<br/>
in life they have to do even if they don&#39;t want to.    Lot&#39;s of really<br/>
bad people have done lots of really bad things to kids because kids<br/>
believed stuff like this.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok to be considerate of a seven year old.&lt;g&gt;   He&#39;s not trying to<br/>
take advantage of you.   Kids don&#39;t do that stuff unless it&#39;s been<br/>
demonstrated to them.    Your patience with and consideration for him<br/>
will be what encourages him to have consideration of others.<br/>
<br/>
My friend was here yesterday with her seven year old and I had forgotten<br/>
how little and sweet seven is.   Maybe because you have a two year old<br/>
seven looks pretty big to you.   From here, seven is little.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would it help to tell him your plan of action the day before and let him<br/>
get used to the idea?   Dylan never liked to have things sprung on him.  <br/>
  And with a few hours to talk it over and answer his questions about how<br/>
much time it will take, etc, maybe you can make arrangements to fit in<br/>
something he&#39;d like to do too. <br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re doing that, but maybe more time to hash it over<br/>
would help.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a snuggly night and soft apologies can get rid of those bad<br/>
moments. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902615832">From: &quot;Tracy and Gilbert Valdez&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gtvaldez@...">gtvaldez@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If my child willfully misbehaves because he needs to attend a trip to a<br/>
park so his sibling<br/>
can enjoy some bonding time,  and that choice of his misbehavior causes<br/>
him to lose his time to play at his friend&#39;s later on.how does that<br/>
build mistrust?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This one kind of caught my attention. First of all, the child doesn&#39;t &quot;need&quot;<br/>
to attend a trip to the park. He doesn&#39;t need it or want it. You (the<br/>
parent) need him to go to make things smoother for you. (hypothetical here)<br/>
And the misbehaving part, well the term gets me. He&#39;s not trying to be bad,<br/>
he just doesn&#39;t want to be there! He&#39;s miserable before he even gets there<br/>
and making him go makes it worse if there&#39;s no compromise or communication.<br/>
Then making him miss a play date with a friend later has nothing to do with<br/>
the parent making him go someplace he didn&#39;t want to go and then punish him<br/>
for showing how upset he was to be there. It&#39;s not at all like the<br/>
consequence of being mean to a friend and having that friend not want to<br/>
play with him later because of it. He&#39;s not trusting you to listen to him<br/>
when he expresses his needs because yours or someone else&#39;s are more<br/>
important. And he&#39;s also not trusting that you will help him figure out a<br/>
solution so you can all be happy.<br/>
<br/>
I had a day at the water park today with my friend and her son. We plan on<br/>
going every week until school lets out. Last time we went, Alyssa was not<br/>
having fun after a half hour. She loves the pool but not water slides and<br/>
sprinklers and shallow water. She wanted to go home. The other 2 didn&#39;t. I<br/>
made up my mind that I would do whatever I had to so that everyone would end<br/>
up happy. It ended up that I got in touch with my mom and she came to pick<br/>
up the baby. Alyssa was happy to leave and spend time at home with grandma<br/>
and the other two were happy to stay. Then after a couple of hours, Sierra<br/>
wanted to leave and Joseph didn&#39;t. So we made an agreement, Joseph would<br/>
decide this time when to leave and next time Sierra would decide. So today,<br/>
Joseph wanted to leave first but also knew he agreed to the decision last<br/>
time around. He knew Sierra stayed longer than she wanted to for him. So he<br/>
walked around and then sat and played alone in the shade and then sat with<br/>
me and talked for awhile. He waited patiently for Sierra like she had the<br/>
week before for him. I then said next time we would stay until closing<br/>
because that&#39;s what I wanted to do. I know one of them, probably both will<br/>
enjoy that. But the decision is off both of them for that one. They both<br/>
mentioned bringing their gameboys so that if one gets tired of water play,<br/>
they still have something to do. And in all honesty, if both get tired, we<br/>
would leave before closing. It&#39;s not like I really need to be there until<br/>
5:00!!!<br/>
<br/>
I must also mention now that the baby stays home when we go and has no<br/>
problem doing so. This all went very smoothly and certainly didn&#39;t take just<br/>
one time to get it that way. A lot of communicating from when they were<br/>
little brings us to this time and problem solving now. They don&#39;t see it as<br/>
one &quot;having&quot; to stay but as cutting a deal with each other. A lot of deals<br/>
go on here with them on a daily basis. They figure it out for themselves and<br/>
it works well. Sometimes they need some help, most times they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
On a last note, one mom that was going to meet us there today cancelled. She<br/>
wrote me late Sunday night that her 10 year old son did something and she<br/>
grounded him for today. I can guarantee you that whatever he did had nothing<br/>
to do with the impending day at the water park. And his mother also lamented<br/>
how his grounding punished her as she really wanted to join us. I mean<br/>
really, what&#39;s the point and what did he learn?<br/>
<br/>
And  a PS that I know I am very fortunate to have my mom here and available<br/>
and very willing to help out when I need her. Some aren&#39;t so lucky. I was<br/>
also willing to call my husband or leave with the baby until my oldest was<br/>
home and could watch her and then I would go back to the park. Not the<br/>
easiest thing for me, but certainly the best for all  the kids. And that&#39;s<br/>
really why I went to the park in the first place, for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147487340">Thank you, Mary - for a most informative point of view. I feel a little<br/>
like I am getting attacked for requesting more information, however you<br/>
explained your point of view without that feeling or tone in your email<br/>
and I most sincerely enjoyed reading your post.<br/>
 <br/>
And I learned more of the unschooling technique - which was the point of<br/>
joining in the first place. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

&lt;&lt;If my child willfully misbehaves because he needs to attend a trip to<br/>
a<br/>
park so his sibling<br/>
can enjoy some bonding time,  and that choice of his misbehavior causes<br/>
him to lose his time to play at his friend&#39;s later on.how does that<br/>
build mistrust?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This one kind of caught my attention. First of all, the child doesn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;need&quot;<br/>
to attend a trip to the park. He doesn&#39;t need it or want it. You (the<br/>
parent) need him to go to make things smoother for you. (hypothetical<br/>
here)<br/>
And the misbehaving part, well the term gets me. He&#39;s not trying to be<br/>
bad,<br/>
he just doesn&#39;t want to be there! He&#39;s miserable before he even gets<br/>
there<br/>
and making him go makes it worse if there&#39;s no compromise or<br/>
communication.<br/>
Then making him miss a play date with a friend later has nothing to do<br/>
with<br/>
the parent making him go someplace he didn&#39;t want to go and then punish<br/>
him<br/>
for showing how upset he was to be there. It&#39;s not at all like the<br/>
consequence of being mean to a friend and having that friend not want to<br/>
play with him later because of it. He&#39;s not trusting you to listen to<br/>
him<br/>
when he expresses his needs because yours or someone else&#39;s are more<br/>
important. And he&#39;s also not trusting that you will help him figure out<br/>
a<br/>
solution so you can all be happy.<br/>

**Again, this appears to be about you and your energy and comfort levels.<br/>
Not<br/>
about addressing your sons and his needs. **<br/>
<br/>
Exactly!       I usually can trace a bad time with small children to me<br/>
being inflexible,  or me being focussed on what I wanted.   Which I&#39;ve<br/>
learned doesn&#39;t work very well with young children.        Like what Deb<br/>
said,  I can trace it to my parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Jennifer, Sandra, Kelli, Deb,  others who posted on the &quot;bad mommy<br/>
moment&quot;.   I threw out the Alfie Kohn suggestion and then had to run to play<br/>
Stratego with my son and watch some movies.   Then evening was  gone!<br/>
What wonderful suggestions!   Even though my kids are getting older I still<br/>
learn so much from reading this list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned from this list that peace and joy can be things to experience<br/>
in parenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047507069"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I expect my kids to be well behaved - meaning I want them to choose<br/>
&gt; behavior that is positive, helpful, considerate. If they choose to<br/>
&gt; misbehave, which is anything that isn&#39;t positive, helpful or<br/>
&gt; considerate, then they will &quot;reap what they sow&quot; - the logical<br/>
&gt; consequence of their actions. Not punishment in my eyes. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my kids were two and four I probably would have said something <br/>
similar to this, but now that they&#39;re a little older and my youngest <br/>
is a toddler I can see how cold and unhelpful that attitude was.  My <br/>
third child is reaping the benefits of my trials and errors with his <br/>
brothers and my years of thought and self-reflection.  I never see <br/>
he and I as anything but on the same side.  If he doesn&#39;t want to be <br/>
in the car to do errands I consider that thoughtfully since his <br/>
happiness is as important to me as my own.  I don&#39;t see him as a <br/>
stubborn little will who isn&#39;t letting me get on with the more <br/>
important things in life, I see *him* as the important thing in <br/>
life. Everything else can take a back seat.  Mabye it&#39;s the result <br/>
of this paradigm shift I&#39;ve made, or mabye he&#39;s just got a different <br/>
toddler-temperament than his brothers had, but my relationship with <br/>
him is almost totally effortless and joyful.  I never need to look <br/>
at him and calculate what the &quot;logical consequences&quot; of his actions <br/>
should be or that he should &quot;get what he deserves&quot; or &quot;reap what he <br/>
sows.&quot;  I honestly can&#39;t imagine seeing him through revenge--colored <br/>
glasses.<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, how exactly is a &quot;logical consequence&quot; different from <br/>
punishment, in your opinion?<br/>
