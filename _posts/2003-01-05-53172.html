<div id="ygrps-yiv-943025696">Hello ladies.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Julie Bogart. I&#39;ve written in the past for HEM and have <br/>
been an unschooler for the last several years. (I also draw from <br/>
Charlotte Mason&#39;s philosophy for our home education).<br/>
<br/>
We have five kids ranging in age from 15 down to 6--all of whom <br/>
have never been to institutional schools.<br/>
<br/>
I have loved the odyssey of home education from the chances to <br/>
share beloved literature together, to hosting what we call &quot;school <br/>
parties&quot; (focusing on a topic and creating an event to share with <br/>
friends be it the California Gold Rush or a Journey to India). So <br/>
far my kids have exhibited all the fruits of what I expected from <br/>
unschooling: a passion for learning, the ability to tackle a topic of <br/>
interest and milk it for all its worth and a voraicous appetite for <br/>
books and the arts.<br/>
<br/>
That is, until now.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly I have teens. My oldest is a sophomore. I feel the <br/>
boom, boom of the college drumbeat right behind me most <br/>
days. (Husband teaches college English. We&#39;re highly aware of <br/>
college admissions and wht it takes to go to college.)<br/>
<br/>
This year for the first time, we enrolled our son in Algebra II at the <br/>
local high school (since I am not equipped to teach it and the <br/>
school offers it for free--and are very friendly to homeschoolers). <br/>
This has been an eye-opener. My very bright son suddenly <br/>
flunked two tests. While he is getting 95%+ on homework, we <br/>
discovered he had no test taking skills. His mistakes were not in <br/>
the Algebra, but in the calculation errors (little stuff).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve worked hard at developing this skill and he&#39;s now gotten <br/>
both a A- and a B+ in his most recent efforts. But this experience <br/>
has me a bit spooked. I suddenly find myself wondering if he <br/>
needs to experience ordinary school life in order to be prepared <br/>
for the more ordinary approach to academics that will be college. <br/>
How do we as unschoolers prepare them for &quot;schoolish&quot; <br/>
behavior? Or do we?<br/>
<br/>
Second set of questions has to do with 13 daughter. She <br/>
suddenly lost her passion for outside interests and is now <br/>
consumed with her social life. As a result, she is pressing to go <br/>
to high school so she can have friends. She has a ton of friends <br/>
now, but feels ripped off that she doesn&#39;t see them every day the <br/>
way she would in school. I&#39;m evastated that she no longer is the <br/>
creative, self-initiating learner that she was before puberty. Her <br/>
main interest is in reading novels and Instant Messaging her <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
How have you all handled the transition to high school? Has <br/>
unschooling changed? Do you see institutional schooling as <br/>
necessary for either social life or college prep? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; How have you all handled the transition to high school? Has <br/>
unschooling changed? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We never thought of them as NOT in high school, so there wasn&#39;t a transition <br/>
to high school, but we have, over the years, gathered a group of other <br/>
homeschoolers and some of them unschoolers, and so the kids were able to have <br/>
social groups not based on school.<br/>
<br/>
They have &quot;gaming friends&quot; and &quot;anime friends,&quot; and most of them are either <br/>
in school or graduated.  Kirby&#39;s friends tend to be older.  He has worked in <br/>
a gaming shop for over two years, and is the youngest charter member of an <br/>
anime club older than that.  He has one good friend who has graduated from <br/>
college already, and several who are out of high school and working.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty, at 13, will have his fourteenth birthday next week.  I have his guest <br/>
list, and there is only one kid who&#39;s in school (a junior in high school up <br/>
the road), so he moved the starting time from noon to 2:00 so Eric can show <br/>
up after school without being too late.  The age range is 9 to 18.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re lucky to live in town, I think, because it&#39;s easy for the kids to get <br/>
around and back home.  We&#39;re lucky to be on AOL because most of their <br/>
homeschooled friends are too and they are in quick and nearly constant <br/>
contact.  Also they&#39;re all involved in a long-lived online role-playing game.<br/>
<br/>
I think being consumed with social life is healthy.  I&#39;m glad they don&#39;t have <br/>
to go to school to get some!<br/>
<br/>
And instant messages and being on the computer don&#39;t bother me.  I know where <br/>
the kids are! <br/>

  Julie, <br/>
<br/>
  If it&#39;s any consolation, this is true of the students I have In regular school too... ;)<br/>
<br/>
  One thing that I have found that helps when they hit this Social Bubble (that&#39;s my own name for it) is to give them some outlet for it... film making has been mentioned here... could she do a film about her friends?  Or a scrapbook?  Or write some kind of thing documenting their friendships?  Or whatever?  Is there some way to capitalize on her interest and allow her to pursue that in a way that might be more focused?  I wonder what ideas she might come up with. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Julie.. It was a surprise to see your name pop up..a nice surprise! You<br/>
may remember my Emily and her stories about her Iguana from one of your<br/>
writing classes a few years ago? I&#39;m mostly a lurker here.. and seldom post,<br/>
but you are definatly in the right place to learn and gain confidence in<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As far as your concerns about teens and college.. Our Emily is now 18..<br/>
presently works as a waitress..and at a clothing store. She also spent a<br/>
Summer working at a local State Park,, doing trail maintence, lots of<br/>
mowing, and office/computer work. She continues to research and try out her<br/>
ideas for alternative house building (she was in the yard with bare feet<br/>
mixing up a clay, straw, sand mixture a few weeks ago..learning to make<br/>
&#39;cob&#39;.. at least I think that&#39;s what she called it. She is building a small<br/>
shelter at the end of our yard..the younger sister thinks it will be a cool<br/>
play house.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we ever experienced any sort of transition..we never pay much<br/>
attention to what grades the girls would be in anyway..life just flows. I<br/>
also have a daughter who&#39;s 12, so can definatly relate to what you are<br/>
saying, about friends and social activities becoming so much more important<br/>
to them now.<br/>
<br/>
Emily has thought about going to college, even spent time on campus<br/>
shadowing one of her friends, another unschooled girl. She stayed in the<br/>
dorm and attended a few classes with her too..but right now, Emily doesn&#39;t<br/>
think college would be of much benefit to her. She continues to learn quite<br/>
well on her own..and thinks it&#39;s foolish to spend so much money when what<br/>
she wants to know is already out there, free for the taking at the local<br/>
librairies and talking with those who are already doing what she is<br/>
interested in. She came home so excited last week..a friend of a friend got<br/>
wind of her interest in alternative building and back to the land stuff and<br/>
gave her his entire collection of old Mother Earth News! Number 1thru about<br/>
80 I think. (I&#39;ve been happily reading those myself!) Emily has dreams of<br/>
buying a few acres and building a house someday, she wishes that could all<br/>
start to happen tomorrow! I think she sees herself as a modern day Thoreau.<br/>
She still isn&#39;t sure how to get from where&#39;s she&#39;s at to where she wants to<br/>
be..but I&#39;m sure she will figure it out in time.<br/>
<br/>
I love all the discussion your questions have stirred up here..great stuff!<br/>

Hey Julie! Thanks for posting. It&#39;s great to see you. We miss you <br/>
over on the Trapdoor Society site. You have such a great outlook <br/>

<br/>
Last night in talking with my husband, I realized that somewhere <br/>
along the way, I got sidetracked. I think the desire to &quot;prepare for <br/>
college&quot; is what took over. And the hormonal changes of teen life <br/>
and attitude took me completely by surprise. We gradually got <br/>
away from the lifestyle of learning and I began orchestrating our <br/>
home again. It hasn&#39;t worked.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately my dh is totally aware of the same difficulties and last <br/>
night stayed up with me until 2 a.m. as we came to reaffirm our <br/>
original vision for our kids. (We&#39;re about to go out to breakfast <br/>
with them this morning to re-cast the vision of life, rather than <br/>
school).<br/>
<br/>
Your story is one that really encrouages me to keep going.<br/>

college? I will confess--this is the hardest part for me. College is <br/>
a big part of our lives even now and was a very satisfying part of <br/>
my young adult life (husband&#39;s too) so I think that is what made <br/>
us second guess ourselves.<br/>
<br/>

In unschooling, there is no transition to high school!!<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t change, interests change and activity changes, but <br/>
unschooing is just unschooling.<br/>
My children have an active and varied social life, without school so no it&#39;s <br/>
not necessary.<br/>
College prep - to me that brings a vision of &quot;rich kids who goofed off and <br/>
need an extra year of high school.&quot;<br/>
I think we (as a culture) need to stop preparing for things and start DOing <br/>
things. So learn how to take a college class by taking a college class, not <br/>
by pretending to take one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since we began unschooling, the idea that &quot;College is invaluable to a good <br/>
life&quot; has drastically changed.<br/>
It is NOT valuable if there is no reason for going. It depends on what one is <br/>
doing in life. College is a tool to me, one that is used for a purpose. If <br/>
one wants to be an attorney, one MUST go to college. There is absolutely NO <br/>
WAY around that one. If one wants to be a pastry chef, college is not <br/>
necessary. If one wants to be a dairy farmer, they can go to college and <br/>
study Animal Hubandry and sustainable farming OR they can take over the <br/>
family farm OR they can work as a farm hand, then overseer, then manager, <br/>
eventually buying into their own farm.<br/>
College is a tool. All that knowledge that is contained within the walls of <br/>
the ivy covered buildings, is also in our world.<br/>
I plan on opening a restaurant (Similar to the Basil Pot!!!) once we have <br/>
moved and settled on our land and DH isn&#39;t commmuting 2 1/2 hours round trip.<br/>
I could start back to college next week when the spring semester starts, <br/>
majoring in Restaurant Management, or I can start in the back of the house at <br/>
California Pizza Kitchen and ask lots of questions and learn while doing. Or <br/>
both! I just choose the tool that I am most happy using to reach my goal.<br/>

There was at one time, and within the lifetimes of people still living.  It <br/>
was once possible to take the bar exam without having gone to college or law <br/>
school.  If you passed, you passed.<br/>
<br/>
It would be cool if the internet and the ability of people to get to <br/>
information from their own homes would bring some of that back.  The reasons <br/>
for going to universities were better before the printing press was <br/>
invented!!  HA!<br/>
<br/>
AND... before video and the internet and cheap printing, some information was <br/>
only available in person.   But that&#39;s  no longer necessarily true.<br/>

&gt; for the more ordinary approach to academics that will be college.<br/>
&gt; How do we as unschoolers prepare them for &quot;schoolish&quot;<br/>
&gt; behavior? Or do we?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve probably told this story here before, but you wouldn&#39;t have seen it.  A<br/>
young unschooled woman here wanted to go to the community college at age 16.<br/>
They wanted her to take an English placement exam which involved writing an<br/>
essay.  She had never written essays before, just letters and journal<br/>
entries, so she asked a local high school teacher for help.  She wrote 2 or<br/>
3 essays which were critiqued by the teacher.  Then she took the exam and<br/>
got 96%.  If your son really wants to go to college, he&#39;ll do what it takes<br/>
to get there.  Your job would be to help out with ideas for learning how to<br/>
take tests or whatever his particular roadblock is.  And going to school and<br/>
taking tests is not the only way to learn how to take them.  I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
there are websites with practice tests, for instance.<br/>

In VA it is possible to become an attorney without college.  One can study and pass the bar exam.  At least one of the attorneys for HSLDA (possibly not everyone&#39;s favorite group) did that.  Many things can be attained through apprenticeships and self-study.<br/>

  &gt; Is this fairly common for unschoolers--to not see value in <br/>
  &gt; college? <br/>
  Since we began unschooling, the idea that &quot;College is invaluable to a good <br/>
  life&quot; has drastically changed.<br/>
  It is NOT valuable if there is no reason for going. It depends on what one is <br/>
  doing in life. College is a tool to me, one that is used for a purpose. If <br/>
  one wants to be an attorney, one MUST go to college. There is absolutely NO <br/>
  WAY around that one. If one wants to be a pastry chef, college is not <br/>
  necessary. If one wants to be a dairy farmer, they can go to college and <br/>
  study Animal Hubandry and sustainable farming OR they can take over the <br/>
  family farm OR they can work as a farm hand, then overseer, then manager, <br/>
  eventually buying into their own farm.<br/>
  College is a tool. All that knowledge that is contained within the walls of <br/>
  the ivy covered buildings, is also in our world.<br/>
  I plan on opening a restaurant (Similar to the Basil Pot!!!) once we have <br/>
  moved and settled on our land and DH isn&#39;t commmuting 2 1/2 hours round trip.<br/>
  I could start back to college next week when the spring semester starts, <br/>
  majoring in Restaurant Management, or I can start in the back of the house at <br/>
  California Pizza Kitchen and ask lots of questions and learn while doing. Or <br/>
  both! I just choose the tool that I am most happy using to reach my goal.<br/>

A young man here wanted to get some high school credits to make it easier to<br/>
go to university.  His mother approached the government correspondance<br/>
school to see if he could just write the tests, since he already knew what<br/>

Yep, this is what my older sons have done. The first &quot;test:&quot;, my oldest had was at age 14, when he wanted to enter a Chemistry programme for gifted kids at a local university. The test and an essay were the entry requirements. We went through test taking techniques and writing essays, used books from the library, he did fine and got into the programme he desired to enter. It made sense to waut until such things were needed and relevant....Leonie W. <br/>
