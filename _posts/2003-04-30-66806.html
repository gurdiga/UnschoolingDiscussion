No one minds restocking because it means simply picking up the old tube and <br/>
sticking on two more rolls.  <br/>
<br/>
I did that because we are temporarily living in a rented mobile home, and it <br/>
didn&#39;t have the tp holders attached to the wall.  Who needs &#39;em!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a great idea!  Ours is always on the sink next to the toilet, <br/>
with extra rolls under the sink within reach of the toilet.  When I <br/>
know I&#39;ll be having visitors, I put it on the holder on the wall, but <br/>
that&#39;s really a dumb place for it -- the holder is all the way on the <br/>
wall in front of the toilet and you have to practically lunge forward <br/>
to reach it.  Children cannot reach it without actually walking.<br/>
