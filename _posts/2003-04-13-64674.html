 </span></blockquote>Today Cait has rummaged around in the recyclable and made several cat toys.  <br/>
She has them stacked at odd angles and various heights, ribbons dangling.  An <br/>
exercise in physics she tells me.  Also Physical Education. She&#39;s running <br/>
with the cats when they grab her creations and run off with them.<br/>
<br/>
We cut up fresh strawberries for tonight&#39;s dessert.  She made whipped cream <br/>
from heavy cream.  That&#39;s some science, liquid to solid. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s working on a scrapbook of her cheerleading season.  She&#39;s going later <br/>
to pick up developed film from her competition in Myrtle Beach two weeks ago. <br/>
 She wants to know about developing film.  But not today she said.  The sun <br/>
is shining and it&#39;s time to do something outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
So we are off to do something outdoors in the sunshine, which I&#39;ve almost <br/>
forgotten what it looks like it&#39;s been so long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652047402">I&#39;ll talk about yesterday, which was a rueful day of unschooling,<br/>
LOL.  Friend husband is in Mexico; Saturday is usually loudly and<br/>
possessively claimed by our 6 yo daughter as her &quot;Papa time&quot; -<br/>
not that there isn&#39;t loads of Papa time any evening of the week,<br/>
just that she can really load up with projects she shares with<br/>
him on Saturdays.<br/>
<br/>
With the paternal unit in absentia, I scoped out some<br/>
alternatives.  I had boiled the eggs for dying, so had that<br/>
safely at hand, but also had information on 2 things in town - a<br/>
Ukrainian egg decorating demonstration and a free performance by<br/>
the Ballet Folklorica (if it&#39;s free it&#39;s for me).  I had<br/>
mentioned both egg dying and going to town to her Friday night,<br/>
as we finished reading the umpteenth Nancy Drew and both seemed<br/>
desirable.  Heck I even have a buzzer and the wire to rig up<br/>
Papa&#39;s &quot;treasure chest&quot; to buzz when it opens.  I was set!<br/>
<br/>
So up she pops out of bed at 9:30 and yells &quot;Momma, there&#39;re new<br/>
horses!&quot;  We have had 3 horses &quot;next door&quot; for several months.<br/>
While half awake she suddenly heard different horse voices.  A<br/>
quick streak outside confirmed that now there were 10 horses.  A<br/>
quick glance by me at the field confirmed that the guys who had<br/>
delivered the horses were pulling away, so the streaking was not<br/>
likely to lead to disaster.<br/>
<br/>
She totally lost interest in eggs and ballet in order to watch<br/>
the horses.  &quot;Maybe some other time&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She stayed out for several hours, except for coming in to grab<br/>
and apple or the like - I took underwear,  jeans and a T shirt to<br/>
her when it became clear she wasn&#39;t coming in on her own.  The<br/>
desire was to see if adding horses to a new place where there<br/>
were already horses would change how the new horses behaved.  She<br/>
had been interested in the racing around, loose configuration of<br/>
the first 3 when they arrived. Since then she has commented on<br/>
how they now move around the pasture as a unit, rather than willy<br/>
nilly. though they spread out to graze.<br/>
<br/>
I am told that she saw the same free ranging, disorganized<br/>
behavior in the new ones, though they were more likely generally<br/>
to follow paths established by the old horses and became a unit<br/>
faster.  I am also told that there were several minutes that were<br/>
a lot like when we add younger poultry to older poultry in the<br/>
hen house, though nobody died.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, the kid can say no and expect it to stick.  I wanted to see<br/>
the ballet; it is my favorite company.  My bad - usually when I<br/>
plan something if I REALLY want to see it, I have a back up<br/>
arrangement in case I am the only one.  Of course that back up<br/>
usually involves somebody who is in Mexico, ATM LOL.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103730992">Come on down - we&#39;ll show you sea shell fossils from the last ice<br/>
age, right up here on the highest point of the ridge that was the<br/>
shore of the Gulf of Mexico then, plot together where the honey<br/>
bees MUST live, from the flight path (we have them back this year<br/>
HURRAH - for 3 years we had to rely on bumbles for pollination),<br/>
and feed you all the free range eggs and organically raised<br/>
produce you can eat.  You don&#39;t have to be good, but that same 6<br/>
yo probably has a stereotype in her head that will lead to a<br/>
request for more tips on archery.   Basically it is a Robin Hood<br/>
image for her, but a tipi might well tip her over into other<br/>
assumptions.  You also have to put up with a lot of flags and a<br/>
tendency for conversation, even when squashing potato bug grubs<br/>
to turn to Catholic moral theology and to politics.<br/>

<br/>
If you can&#39;t get the balloons filled try soaking smallish sponges in<br/>
paint.   It&#39;s a little messy but the wet sponges fling pretty well and<br/>
you can fling a few different colors at once.   They work in sling shots<br/>
too if you can take the high squish factor.<br/>
<br/>
The balloons work well if you&#39;re flinging them at a hard surface, like<br/>
the road or your best friends garage door.     Tempura washes off both<br/>
pretty successfully.   (it&#39;s still better if the friend is intending to<br/>
paint when it&#39;s all over.)    <br/>
<br/>
In addition to paint balls and sponges we have flung mashed potatoes,<br/>
jello, wasabi peas, croutons, grapes, and old Power Rangers.    Old Power<br/>
Rangers never die, they just sail over the horizon...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m told this is the prototype of the really BIG trebuchet we&#39;re going to<br/>
build for the &quot;Punkin Chunkin&quot; contest in October.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes it is nicer to paint on an old canvas after is has been<br/>
painted black (or other dark color) instead of white, just a trick I<br/>
learned long ago.  Also, it is WAY less expensive to stretch your own<br/>
canvases than to purchase them.  I do both, depending on time, and<br/>
stretching can be hard without help.  Buy a premade one for examples on<br/>
how to do it.  There are probably loads of online directions as well, of<br/>
course!  I wish painting were less expensive!<br/>
