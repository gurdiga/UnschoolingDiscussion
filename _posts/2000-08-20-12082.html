VHEA Day<br/>
Seminars for New and Experienced Homeschoolers <br/>
<br/>
Featuring: &quot;Conversations with My Violin; Learning about Learning&quot;  <br/>
by Author David H. Albert<br/>
	&quot;Contrasts the rather strange principles that lie a the heart of public<br/>
education with the actual learning process itself.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Other Topics: <br/>
<br/>
Avoiding Burnout (roundtable)--Jen Jablunovsky<br/>
	Are you headed for burnout? This session will discuss the signs and<br/>
symptoms of potential burnout, as well as suggestions by experienced<br/>
homeschoolers on ways to combat it. Topics of discussion include support<br/>
groups, changing homeschooling styles/approaches, parents taking time for<br/>
themselves, and simplifying your schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Starting a Writing Group -- Parrish Mort<br/>
	A writing group provides a safe environment for sharing creative writing<br/>
and exploring new styles of writing. Even the most reluctant writers<br/>
learn to love the experience! Learn how to organize a group, the basic<br/>
rules, and some tried and true ideas for activities.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching with Community College Resources -- Linda Doby <br/>
	Feel like you can&#39;t teach high school level subjects? Then offer college<br/>
level courses! Many of us feel intimidated by the prospect of presenting<br/>
higher-level subjects to our older kids. This session offers information<br/>
on a practical alternative to sending older homeschooled kids to high<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
The Beginner Homeschooler--Peg Watson<br/>
	This session is for the new or nearly new homeschooler who would like to<br/>
have general information about homeschooling in Virginia.  Legal<br/>
concerns, practical considerations, networking strategies and coping<br/>
techniques will be shared by the presenter, who has been homeschooling<br/>
for several years, but not so long that she&#39;s forgotten what it&#39;s like to<br/>
be a beginner.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling as a Way of Life -- Shay Seaborne <br/>
	Unschooling is often misunderstood [&quot;They just goof off all day&quot;] and<br/>
sometimes seems frightening [&quot;How do children learn if you don&#39;t teach<br/>
them?&quot;].  Find out what unschooling is --and what it isn&#39;t, how it works,<br/>
and why more homeschoolers are leaning toward this enjoyable way of life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hands-on Science -- Castle O&#39;Neil <br/>
	This session will provide some creative ideas for approaching science as<br/>
a dynamic subject -- one that is constantly evolving, where so much is<br/>
still unknown. Kids will come to realize that they can be scientists too!<br/>
Discussion will include examples from teaching topics such as states of<br/>
matter and evolution, among others.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling Older Children -- Margaret Shaw <br/>
	Find out what you need to know about homeschooling older children, from<br/>
academics and activities to jobs, including paid work, volunteer<br/>
activities, and church work. Topics range from study skills and<br/>
testing/SATs to lessons and classes, the fine arts, computer literacy,<br/>
and etiquette -- crucial! -- as well as documentation for all of the<br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>
Starting a Co-Op Group (roundtable)--Jill Friestad<br/>
	Many homeschoolers enjoy the benefits of cooperative clubs and classes.<br/>
Find out how to form and plan the successful year-long co-op you<br/>
envision-- through setting goals, sharing a philosophy and working with<br/>
compatible personalities.<br/>
<br/>
Using Portfolios as Evaluation Tools -- Connie LaPallo<br/>
	Why choose a portfolio evaluation instead of testing? This session will<br/>
explore the reasons you might choose a portfolio, what a portfolio<br/>
contains, and how a portfolio is evaluated. Find out about minimum<br/>
requirements, suggestions for dividing a portfolio into sections, ideas<br/>
for organizing information throughout the year, and samples of<br/>
portfolios.<br/>
<br/>
Opportunity to Network <br/>
	A chance to schmooze with other homeschoolers: new, familiar and those<br/>
on-line folks you&#39;ve always wanted to meet in real life. <br/>
