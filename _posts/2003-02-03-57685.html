<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, the only way I seem to be able to maintain many of these kinds of <br/>
&gt; friendships is just not to talk about what I do or how I do it, and not to <br/>
&gt; have our kids spend time together, or at least under certain circumstances. <br/>
&gt;  I share very little of my philosophy with these people.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My brothers are that way.  Children are property and of course they have <br/>
nothing intelligent to say they haven&#39;t been &quot;taught that in school yet.&quot;  <br/>
But I still have relationships with them.  We live very far apart so I see <br/>
them only on vacations.  We take regular vacations together every year or so. <br/>
 I maintain the relationship by not being physically close with them.  I <br/>
don&#39;t share my parenting philosophies unless they ask.  I know people are <br/>
very sensitive about that and vacations are a time to be happy.  And I ALWAYS <br/>
make sure that we stay at separate hotels.  Without telling them of course.  <br/>
But that allows my family time to be away from them.  We also take vacations <br/>
to theme parks, etc., so there isn&#39;t a time where they would have to think <br/>
about &quot;disciplining&quot; my children.  Have separate vehicles.  Etc.  That is how <br/>
I maintain my relationship.  <br/>
