<br/>
I just read this at HEM and find it pertinent to the LEARNING TO READ thread.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the issues of when and how a child reads are absolutely <br/>
related to the educational perspective of the parents. There is <br/>
nothing natural about reading; it is very much a cultural construct. <br/>
If reading early is an imperative for the parent, by hook or by crook <br/>
the child will read. If it is not regarded as an imperative  --as it <br/>
is for many unschoolers-- then the child will learn to read whenever.<br/>
<br/>
The issue with reading, though, is that there is a right way to do it <br/>
within the context of the proper grammatical use of the language. <br/>
When that happens or should happen, THAT is what is open to debate.<br/>

&gt;Ten Myths of Reading Instruction<br/>
&gt;by Sebastian Wren, Ph.D.<br/>
&gt;Michael Pressley, in his excellent book, Reading Instruction that <br/>
&gt;Works, concluded with a discussion of what he considered to be &quot;Ten <br/>
&gt;Dumb and Dangerous Claims about Reading Instruction.&quot; All of the <br/>
&gt;points he made were quite compelling, but one wonders if these are <br/>
&gt;his &quot;top ten&quot; picks for the most dangerous myths about reading <br/>
&gt;instruction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some might at least argue that the list should be re-ordered <br/>
&gt;(placing some higher on the list than Pressley did), and certainly <br/>
&gt;some would argue that there are a few myths that should have made <br/>
&gt;the cut that he never mentioned. Curious readers are directed to his <br/>
&gt;book to review his &quot;top ten&quot; list (the book is well written and <br/>
&gt;highly informative), but here we will examine a second perspective <br/>
&gt;of the most damaging myths and misconceptions about reading <br/>
&gt;instruction. Let us begin with a myth that Pressley did not mention, <br/>
&gt;but which is arguably the most pernicious myth currently influencing <br/>
&gt;reading instruction:&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;<br/>

This isn&#39;t true, though.<br/>
If reading early is &quot;an imperative&quot; and the child doesn&#39;t read, he is <br/>
labelled &quot;disabled,&quot; dyslexic, homeschooling is blamed, spouses are blamed, <br/>
television is blamed, pressure and shame flood in, tears, and eventually the <br/>
child reads and the parents credit all their labelling and shame.   TOTAL <br/>
waste of emotion.  And five years later, if they could ONLY reclaim those <br/>
years and undo the crap, it would be the most valuable thing in their lives.  <br/>
Way more valuable than early reading that cannot be forced.<br/>
<br/>
And IF the early reading comes pretty easily, as it does for some kids in <br/>
school, what is lost is the opportunity for the parents and the child to see <br/>
natural learning work.  If they can see reading come naturally, they won&#39;t <br/>
worry about other things a bit.<br/>

<br/>
1) They don&#39;t all realize kids *do* read when given the freedom to do so.<br/>
They&#39;re caught in the &quot;Well, maybe that&#39;s true, but I want to be sure&quot; mode<br/>
of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
2) Their goals are different. Someone whose goals are to allow learning to<br/>
unfold naturally aren&#39;t going to have the same needs as someone who wants to<br/>
&quot;make sure&quot; or someone (like schools) whose goal is to have the kids reading<br/>
independently by a certain age. It&#39;s like two people debating what it&#39;s best<br/>
to pack for a hike when they don&#39;t realize one is planning on hiking across<br/>
the desert and the other is planning to hike Mt. Everest. Parents&#39; true<br/>
goals are masked by thinking their goal is to do what&#39;s best for their kids,<br/>
not realizing they aren&#39;t defining &quot;what&#39;s best&quot; in the same way. And often<br/>
they aren&#39;t defining it the same way because of fear and ignorance of how<br/>
children really learn when given the freedom to learn what they want when<br/>
they want it.<br/>

<br/>
I disagree with this statement.  I personally have found with my 2 children, that there is no way to force a child to read.  The more we(teachers and parents) insisted they &#39;just try harder&#39; the more my children resisted or seemed to just &#39;not get it&#39;.  It can be very frustrating for both the parent and child if you force the issue.  <br/>

&gt;If reading early is &quot;an imperative&quot; and the child doesn&#39;t read, he is<br/>
&gt;labelled &quot;disabled,&quot; dyslexic, homeschooling is blamed, spouses are blamed,<br/>

&gt;waste of emotion. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reading is not an early imperative because reading is really not a <br/>
biological imperative. COMMUNICATION is a human imperative but <br/>
reading --whether pictures or words is not. There is a confusion <br/>
between the act of communicating and the tools we use to communicate <br/>
with. If using signs in such an abstract way as words were natural we <br/>
would all have a common language but that is not the case.<br/>
<br/>
The best example that I could think of was with pictures. When my son <br/>
scribbles on a piece of paper and says that it is a picture of a cow, <br/>
I have to believe him because to HIM it is. In that instance I am <br/>
entering into a contract, into an agreement with him. He himself has <br/>
not entered into the visual social contract that says that some <br/>
circles and lines, fashioned in a certain way even if rudimentary, <br/>
will give me the construct of a cow. So even if as cavemen we were <br/>
&quot;reading&quot; pictures of bison, those pictures are not so much the <br/>
evidence of Neanderthal reading but probably evidence of one of the <br/>
earliest language constructs that we have.<br/>
<br/>
A language is a social contract. We use words and signs in a certain <br/>
way because we enter in agreement with the community of speakers that <br/>
share the language. Even when we use words in an unconventional way <br/>
--like COOL! or GUAVA!, for example-- it is still understood that <br/>
these sounds mean something. Meaning is not natural. Meaning and the <br/>
use of meaning come out of a social agreement that predates all of us.<br/>
<br/>
So communication and the act of creating social contracts is natural <br/>
to humans. What is not natural, in the sense of being a primal and <br/>
universal function of the human animal, is the social contract <br/>
itself. That is a construction. Just like a building or garden.<br/>
<br/>
The whole American phenomenon of education has nothing to do with <br/>
what is natural or not. There is no failure in education --what we <br/>
have is a constant and jarring social disagreement on what education <br/>
is or should be. I do not know when historically reading and writing <br/>
became the markers of education in this society but I am sure that it <br/>
is traceable to a particular point in time somewhere back in the late <br/>
19th century.<br/>
<br/>
You are very candid in the way you share your children&#39;s unschooling <br/>
journeys and the value that I see in that is not whether you are <br/>
doing the right or wrong thing. What your articles reflect is the <br/>
world you have created for your family and the values that you and <br/>
your husband have chosen to instill in this little piece of world <br/>
your call home. There is no blame, shame or tears but that is not <br/>
because what you are doing is right or wrong in itself but because <br/>
YOU have chosen to raise your children outside of the, let&#39;s say, <br/>
mainstream social contract that states that there is something wrong <br/>
if your child has not done X, Y or Z by a certain age.<br/>
<br/>
What I see around me here in NYC is appalling. You see people <br/>
plunking down 16, 20, 30, 000 for pre-K so that their kids can have <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; kind of education. Or they get caught up in the drama of <br/>
their kids being gifted or not gifted and getting coaches and the <br/>
right books so that they can pass those god damn TAG tests that are <br/>
supposed to validate their existence through their children&#39;s <br/>
&quot;giftedness&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When I said that people would make their kids read by hook or by <br/>
crook I meant it in the most literal sense. If reading and writing is <br/>
all they value as being the &quot;proof&quot; of a good education, they will do <br/>
anything to fix the &quot;problem&quot;.  Most people see their children&#39;s <br/>
achievements or failures as a reflection of not only who they are as <br/>
individuals but of their standing in society. That is, their <br/>
children&#39;s success at hitting all the milestones before everybody <br/>
else is as about their own success at completing all the milestones <br/>
that we as a society say that we need to hit in order to be <br/>
successful.<br/>
<br/>
And this, btw, has no bearing on whether we send our kids to college <br/>
or not. If not, most homeschoolers and unschoolers would feel <br/>
comfortable with the idea of NOT sending their kids to college either <br/>
--but that is the topic for another discussion.<br/>
<br/>
So, fundamentally, I do not disagree with your or Bec or Joyce. What <br/>
I disagree with is the consideration that reading and writing are <br/>
natural activities and not social constructs.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The action is natural. Communication is natural; what is used to <br/>
communicate is not. Learning is natural, what is used to learned is <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
Evan was colicky for what it seemed forever. I was going out of my <br/>
mind because he was 5 months old and still screaming for 3-5 hours a <br/>
day. The peds were idiots telling me it would go away. It didn&#39;t. <br/>
Then a friend told me to read THE FUZZY BABY BOOK. It changed my <br/>
life. Here I was a post-structuralist literary critic with a heavy <br/>
does of linguistics and something as simple as listening to the <br/>
different cries of my child just went over me. I had not a clue.<br/>
<br/>
My son was colicky because of a breakdown in communication between <br/>
the two of us. I had not entered into an agreement with him as to <br/>
what his cryings meant. After reading that book, our relationship <br/>
changed. We &#39;spoke&#39;, we worked things out. He cried, I stated my <br/>
&quot;translations&quot; until, somehow, we found a way to reach an agreement <br/>
as to what he meant. Same when he entered into his babbling period. <br/>
We would translate what he was saying by asking questions. He would <br/>
nod if he agreed with our translation. Needless to say, when he <br/>
started talking he was extremely pissed off that we could not <br/>
understand what he was saying. We stressed, though, that he was <br/>
learning new languages (English and Spanish) and that the transition <br/>
from Evanish to these other languages was sometimes tricky. That&#39;s <br/>
why, when he did not want me to talk to him in Spanish anymore (at <br/>
about 3), I really had to back off. He was just overwhelmed and <br/>
needed to focus on one new language at the time.<br/>
<br/>
There are other moments of this &quot;unnaturalness&quot;. We were in the <br/>
living room  --he was about 1 year old. Evan was slamming the door of <br/>
the VCR console. I asked him to stop. He did. Then I said to him, <br/>
&quot;close the door&quot;. He looked at me mystified. &quot;Close the door&quot;. Again <br/>
he was just two big eyes staring back at me. Then it dawned on me <br/>
--he had no clue that what he was playing with was called a door. <br/>
Doors to the apartment, doors to the bedrooms are, well huge things <br/>
that open and close. Those where doors. This thing that opened and <br/>
closed but was smaller than him, he had no idea that it was also a <br/>
door. So I went to him and pointed to the cabinet door and said, <br/>
&quot;This is a door just like the front door&quot;, and pointed to that too. <br/>
&quot;Ooooh&quot;, he said. So we went all around the apartment looking for all <br/>
the doors.<br/>
<br/>
It is not that learning is extrinsic from language. What I am trying <br/>
to distinguish is between learning the action and the ability being <br/>
learned. The fact that human babies have to learn how to suckle <br/>
really tells us a lot about the human animal. Humans have had to <br/>
create practices and technologies to support learning just for the <br/>
simple reason of survival. So, if we look at learning from that <br/>
evolutionary perspective, then language becomes one of the early <br/>
practices or technologies that humans needed to develop in order to <br/>
survive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Being available and useful is all<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think we are disagreeing but when you talk about being <br/>
available, I am not sure what you mean. Do you mean being there when <br/>
they need the information to become available to them? If this is <br/>
true, then yes, I agree.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I have an addendum to that argument. What about just changing <br/>
our perspective of what is language? What if we talked about language <br/>
as a practice and technology that we have developed and found an <br/>
agreement over its use through practices such as grammar, <br/>
orthography, philology, phonetics, etc. Then what? It does not become <br/>
a natural thing, it is just another ability that can be learned. <br/>
Timetables? I guess you and I agree that there should not be any, <br/>
that learning how to use language can happen at each person&#39;s pace. <br/>
What I am trying to argue for is to look at language as something <br/>
that is just a tool with a set of instructions and that, really, it <br/>
takes a lifetime --or a great deal of passion and practice-- to <br/>
master those instructions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &gt; The issue with reading, though, is that there is a right way to do it<br/>
&gt;&gt;  within the context of the proper grammatical use of the language.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The same is true of spoken language. But what barrier or stumbling block is<br/>
&gt;that to speaking?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, in my example with Evan, the stumbling block is the lack of <br/>
AGREEMENT over meaning.<br/>
<br/>
When a 15 year old does not read or write at the same level of his or <br/>
her peers, it is not because that person is slow or behind. They are <br/>
not reading at the others &#39;level&#39; because they are not in agreement <br/>
with what should be the level or reading or writing for a 15 year-old.<br/>
<br/>
So, in general terms, unschooling is the opportunity for many of us <br/>
to allow our children to not be beholden to the mainstream agreements <br/>
of how, when and where our children should learn. What that creates <br/>
though, is a new agreement; or, in political terms, a new social <br/>
contract.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  When that happens or should happen, THAT is what is open to debate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And the reasons people debate teaching kids to read is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) They don&#39;t all realize kids *do* read when given the freedom to do so.<br/>
&gt;They&#39;re caught in the &quot;Well, maybe that&#39;s true, but I want to be sure&quot; mode<br/>
&gt;of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fear is a major factor here. I think that people push their children <br/>
into doing things because THEY don&#39;t want to be embarrassed. Fear of <br/>
embarrassment is what feeds the education industry, no question about <br/>
it. And I am including the homeschooling section of that industry as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
So when I said &quot;by hook or by crook&quot; I meant it in the context of <br/>
this fear of embarrassment. Some will go all the way out spending <br/>
thousands of dollars in reading programs or coaches or whatever. Then <br/>
there are those that will medicalize the situation and call it a <br/>
condition like dyslexia because that way the blame is not on them, it <br/>
is on something as abstract as a &quot;condition&quot;. So then, there is an <br/>
explanation for why the child can&#39;t read. I am not saying this is a <br/>
conscious act for everybody because many people are not aware that <br/>
FEAR is what drives their every move.<br/>
<br/>
FEAR is not just an issue related to schooling or education but <br/>
basically everything in our lives. Look at the stock market, look at <br/>
religion, look at medicine, look at the institution of marriage, look <br/>
at homeschooling and even, yes, unschooling. A lot of people come to <br/>
homeschooling and unschooling out of fear not out of possibility and <br/>
that is what informs their decisions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) Their goals are different. Someone whose goals are to allow learning to<br/>
&gt;unfold naturally aren&#39;t going to have the same needs as someone who wants to<br/>

&gt;independently by a certain age.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s like two people debating what it&#39;s best<br/>

&gt;goals are masked by thinking their goal is to do what&#39;s best for their kids,<br/>
&gt;not realizing they aren&#39;t defining &quot;what&#39;s best&quot; in the same way. And often<br/>
&gt;they aren&#39;t defining it the same way because of fear and ignorance of how<br/>
&gt;children really learn when given the freedom to learn what they want when<br/>
&gt;they want it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Joyce, when I was teaching college, a lot of kids knew how to read <br/>
but could not make any sense of what they were reading. Sounding out <br/>
words is not reading. There are so many things involved in the <br/>
processes of reading and writing and all have to be attended to. <br/>
Writing was the other big problem --they just could not articulate <br/>
their ideas. I am not saying that they were bad or wrong. What I am <br/>
saying is that as a Spanish teacher I spent way too much time <br/>
teaching English to my students. They just did not have the tools, <br/>
the knowledge of their own language, in order to apply to it to the <br/>
type of learning that goes on at a university.<br/>
<br/>
And BTW, the fact that I was teaching the elite (NYU, Rutgers) and <br/>
the &#39;non-elite&#39; (BMCC and Manhattan College) taught me that it did <br/>
not matter how much money or resources my students had at their <br/>
disposal. If they did not know how to use those resources, they just <br/>
went to waste.<br/>
<br/>
Language is really a tool or, if you want to put it into a fun <br/>
context, we could say that words are like LEGO blocks. You can build <br/>
anything with them. There is nothing to fear in words. There is <br/>
nothing mysterious about them. Saying that &quot;it will happen when it <br/>
happens&quot; is too vague and feeds into that whole fear factor around <br/>
reading and writing.<br/>
<br/>
My arguments are for demystifying language; for taking aware the aura <br/>
of fear around it. I guess because I have used everything I can use <br/>
to deal with my dyslexia, I have no qualms in encouraging people to <br/>
try things out with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
THAT DOES NOT MEAN I ADVOCATE PUSHING CHILDREN INTO ANYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
What it means is, if the interest is there but the parent is <br/>
overwhelmed because they are confused with all these messages of what <br/>
is right and wrong, I am here saying, don&#39;t worry, they are just <br/>
words. Let&#39;s strip reading and writing of their omnipotence in <br/>
learning. They are just words. Let&#39;s get rid of the mystery and fear <br/>
around phonemes and phonics. They are just words. It is just as <br/>
simple as that.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The fact that human babies have to learn how to suckle <br/>
really tells us a lot about the human animal.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the moms who often haven&#39;t seen it done and don&#39;t know where to put the <br/>
baby and what to do.  And it&#39;s hospitals giving bad advice and telling moms <br/>
that if the baby is isn&#39;t nursing yet the mom can&#39;t go home,  before the milk <br/>
is even in.  And it&#39;s cesareans and induced births so that the baby pops out <br/>
before the milk is ready.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of modern intervention and nonsense, babies don&#39;t &quot;have to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that if a mother is unconscious when a baby is born the baby can <br/>
climb to the nipple.  The grasping instinct that newborns have, which fades, <br/>
I&#39;ve heard has to do with that potential first climb to food.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Communication is natural; what is used to <br/>
communicate is not. Learning is natural, what is used to learned is <br/>
not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what you are saying.<br/>
<br/>
What is used to communicate in people is voice or symbol.  Both are &quot;natural.&quot;<br/>
What&#39;s used in learning is new biochemical connections.  Those are all <br/>
internal.  All learning is in brain, muscle, mind.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, if we look at learning from that <br/>
evolutionary perspective, then language becomes one of the early <br/>
practices or technologies that humans needed to develop in order to <br/>
survive.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Language is not &quot;a technology.&quot; <br/>
When dogs communicate, or honey bees, or birds, or dolphins, that is natural. <br/>
 <br/>
Humans have involved communications with stories and songs and poems, but <br/>
it&#39;s still evolved gradually and been passed on naturally.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What about just changing <br/>
our perspective of what is language? What if we talked about language <br/>
as a practice and technology that we have developed and found an <br/>
agreement over its use through practices such as grammar, <br/>
orthography, philology, phonetics, etc. Then what? It does not become <br/>
a natural thing, it is just another ability that can be learned. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Native speakers don&#39;t need those in-depth studies and analyses for their <br/>
language to work.  There is the natural use of language and then there&#39;s the <br/>
dissection and analysis of language.<br/>
<br/>
A family with traditional building skills can build a shed or barn or house <br/>
or fence without studying the history of other methods.  They only need what <br/>
they learned from their own relatives or neighbors.   Some people like to <br/>
study the idea of building itself, either from an  engineering standpoint, or <br/>
anthropological, or archeological.  But that is not the same as building.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Timetables? I guess you and I agree that there should not be any, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Translate, please.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;table&quot; in &quot;timestables&quot; is a chart which anyone can construct.  It&#39;s a <br/>
pattern of counting. The pattern existed before writing and charts did.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What I am trying to argue for is to look at language as something <br/>
that is just a tool with a set of instructions and that, really, it <br/>
takes a lifetime --or a great deal of passion and practice-- to <br/>
master those instructions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re seeing a lifelong obsession with the essence of language as <br/>
being somehow equal to or on a continuum with just learning and using <br/>
language in everyday life. It&#39;s a very different thing.<br/>
<br/>
A person can be an excellent speaker of a language and have NO idea of how to <br/>
diagram sentences or conjugate verbs.  They&#39;re different things, the use and <br/>
the analysis.<br/>
<br/>
Someone can be an excellent musician without knowing music theory.<br/>
Someone can be a great baseball player without knowing biomechanics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am not saying this is a <br/>
conscious act for everybody because many people are not aware that <br/>
FEAR is what drives their every move.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Fear doesn&#39;t drive my every move.<br/>
<br/>
Are you just talking about school-conscious New Yorkers still?  Or have you <br/>
really moved on to &quot;everybody&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They just did not have the tools, <br/>
the knowledge of their own language, in order to apply to it to the <br/>
type of learning that goes on at a university.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You wanted them to know grammar so you could use that terminology.  <br/>
<br/>
People have learned second languages for thousands of years, and before the <br/>
development of grammar books.  HOW?  By actually going where the people spoke <br/>
the language.<br/>
<br/>
There are people with great talent for learning multiple languages.  There <br/>
are others without that talent.  But &#39;scientific&#39; school methods ignore that <br/>
and think that a method of instruction can be developed which will allow <br/>
anyone equally to memorize rules add verbs and vocabulary and then speak the <br/>
language.  Classroom language instruction has never been shown to be as <br/>
effective as going to the place and living among native speakers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And BTW, the fact that I was teaching the elite (NYU, Rutgers) and <br/>
the &#39;non-elite&#39; (BMCC and Manhattan College) taught me that it did <br/>
not matter how much money or resources my students had at their <br/>
disposal. If they did not know how to use those resources, they just <br/>
went to waste.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both were schools.  And the resources were not natural learning experiences, <br/>
I&#39;m guessing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Language is really a tool or, if you want to put it into a fun <br/>
context, we could say that words are like LEGO blocks. You can build <br/>
anything with them. There is nothing to fear in words. There is <br/>
nothing mysterious about them. Saying that &quot;it will happen when it <br/>
happens&quot; is too vague and feeds into that whole fear factor around <br/>
reading and writing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying.<br/>
Yes, language is like blocks.  English is like alphabet blocks that don&#39;t <br/>
connect.  Latin/French (where much of English vocabulary arises) are like <br/>
tinkertoys--they clip parts together to make bigger words.  But that&#39;s an <br/>
observation after the fact, and no child needs to know that to learn the <br/>
languages.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My arguments are for demystifying language; for taking aware the aura <br/>
of fear around it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yet you&#39;re describing it as something created, with rules, and unnatural.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Let&#39;s strip reading and writing of their omnipotence in <br/>
learning. They are just words. Let&#39;s get rid of the mystery and fear <br/>
around phonemes and phonics. They are just words. It is just as <br/>
simple as that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Were you afraid at first and now you&#39;re losing the fear?  <br/>
In the same post  you&#39;ve said things that seem contradictory.<br/>

I think we are talking two different languages :-) I would like to know:<br/>
<br/>
1. What do you consider a language?<br/>
<br/>
2. Is a grammar put together in 1492 (Spanish) or 1602 (English) a <br/>
natural occurrence?<br/>
<br/>
3. How do you define natural?<br/>

Well, the grammar was just a reflection of the language that already <br/>
existed.  It&#39;s not as if Spaniards had been sitting around not <br/>
speaking or communicating or writing until 1492.  Grammar is an <br/>
artifice.  <br/>
