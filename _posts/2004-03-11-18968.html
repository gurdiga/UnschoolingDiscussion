 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I thought this too.  We&#39;ve had heart-breaking things happen in our <br/>
house... in our family.  Not going to college is not and never will be <br/>
one of them.  Loosing a baby--that&#39;s heartbreaking. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think much of Lexie and Janene going to college.  I try to make <br/>
NOW happy and healthy, to love every minute I&#39;m with them. <br/>
<br/>
Your baby is seven weeks old.  Enjoy these minutes, these hours, these <br/>
days.  Worry about the years later.  Please read that with gentle, <br/>
loving language.<br/>
