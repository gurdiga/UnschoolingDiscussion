<div id="ygrps-yiv-980298968">as someone else mentioned, the beginning of the traditional school year often <br/>
gives me doubts about our &quot;plan!&quot;  or leaves me wishing i had more of a plan. <br/>
 so i was thinking, even as an unschooler, i can write down a plan, that may <br/>
help me keep my sanity.  this plan would NOT have subjects and page numbers <br/>
and school assignments, but instead broad goals for the way we would like to <br/>
see our family function over the upcoming year, how we would like to treat <br/>
each other, what we would have liked to see happen if we looked back over a <br/>
year.  another idea that helps me a lot is to go back over the last year, <br/>
(which was very &quot;unschooly&quot;for us) and record some of the many things that <br/>
happened.  it is validating, but still always hard to quantify ALL the <br/>
wonderful learning that we know went on.  it is sooo easy to focus on the <br/>
areas we havent ever &quot;covered...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
having just given birth to our fifth child almost 4 wks ago, i feel a great <br/>
loss of control over so many household things... and tho i am relaxed about <br/>
most things most of the time (thats good!) there are those other times when i <br/>
have this underlying grouchiness about the chaos.  and i think it is due to a <br/>
feeling of having no control over most things and being buffeted by the winds <br/>
of many personalities daily.  this is just life i guess.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, in wanting to give the best to the education end of things, i <br/>
struggle with not helping the kids be steadfast in things they dont want to <br/>
do.  (like multiplication tables!)  i dont want to have them hate those kinds <br/>
of things, but i do want them to realize its not so bad to do things that <br/>
aren&#39;t fun-- there is even a great sense of accomplishment there!<br/>
<br/>
my 10yo says she feels behind in things (obviously compared to someone!  <br/>
probably her one close friend who goes to school and is doing homework all <br/>
the time!)  it is hard, tho we try, to get across the concept of arbitrarily <br/>
assigned knowledge and also everyone having a different set of life <br/>
experiences and so NONE of us knowing the same things...  so i let her peruse <br/>
a book that is one of those that says what 4th graders are learning in <br/>
school, so she would actually see on paper what things her school peers might <br/>
be being taught and therefore perhaps not be intimidated that there is really <br/>
much she might be missing.<br/>
<br/>
speaking of four year olds, i just love this age, and it does sound like <br/>
something is going on with your sweetie, kandace.  i hope you are able to <br/>
check into the autism and allergies (both good sounding suggestions) and <br/>
narrow down her situation so she can be releived of her frustrations and <br/>
return to herself!  best wishes, there.<br/>
<br/>
one more abstract thought...  i wonder how many of you have an unschooling <br/>
approach that reflects the active learning, conscious seeking out of info to <br/>
answer ideas that come up-- constantly diligent and aware of opportunities to <br/>
educate and absorb etc, verses the learning is happening whether you TRY or <br/>
not method?  i see these as some distinctions in unschoolers approaches...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750867925">erin, this is an interesting area.  To be honest, atm I don&#39;t have the <br/>
energy to be one of the former type of unschooler, so I&#39;m trusting <br/>
heavily that the latter works!!  I think there are merits to both <br/>
approaches, and it probably depends on one&#39;s children, like my <br/>
almost 5yo doesn&#39;t like me telling her things in an &#39;educational&#39; <br/>
way...  If it doesn&#39;t fit her box, she finds it hard to accept, I think. <br/>
