&lt;&lt; I never knew anyone else this happened to ... of course, no one else in<br/>
my family ever nursed their kids. I was so confounded when ds weaned<br/>
himself, I wrote a story about it. Mothering magazine is going to publish it<br/>
this year sometime :-P&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you had the same experience. At least I know it wasn&#39;t just<br/>
me.(sigh) I was heartbroken when Alyssa stopped nursing. I must have asked<br/>
her for days afterwards. My husband finally looked at me and said, &quot;Stop,<br/>
you&#39;re pushing. She doesn&#39;t want to nurse.&quot; He wasn&#39;t trying to be mean,<br/>
just saw I was getting crazy with it. I cried. I still have dreams of Alyssa<br/>
of nursing.<br/>

She loves it and so do I.<br/>

I love it when they can talk about it.  My grandson was telling my daughter<br/>
that it was *his* booby the other day.  She told him it was hers.  Uh uh.<br/>
*Dat* your booby (pointing to the other one).  One night she was dying for<br/>
some sleep, so she told him the boobies had to sleep.  He wasn&#39;t buying it.<br/>
The *other* one could sleep while he had that one.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

up and looked at me. He said softly&quot;Mom, your nipple is round, like a ball. <br/>

I was speechless, he proceeded to nurse some more. He nursed till he was 5.5. <br/>
( NOt continuously, we broke for meals etc.&lt;G&gt;) I wouldnot trade that for the <br/>

watch a friends 3day old foal nurse today. What a fabulous gift to nurse a <br/>

the way they expected it to. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sweet.  My daughter&#39;s family was watching a movie a while back in which a<br/>
mother was leaving a toddler with someone else for some reason.  Kaelin got<br/>
quite upset.  First you have to know that his way of asking to nurse has<br/>
been to make a donkey sound.  Anyway, he was pointing at the child and then<br/>
at his mother and saying in a plaintive voice, &quot;Baby, mummy, baby, uh huh,<br/>
uh huh, uh huh (donkey sound - best I can do).<br/>

delivered a baby in the midst of Mitch&#39;s chemo.  She had attempted to send <br/>
milk to the milk bank in Denver but it was cost/time prohibitive; much easier <br/>
to run a batch across town :-D  Plus, Mitch was happy, happy, happy to run <br/>
thru the colostrum she pumped for him the first few days ~ I was truly amazed <br/>
at the difference it made in his well being.  For this, I am eternally <br/>
indebted to my friend Sandra.  <br/>
<br/>
I would recommend contacting a cancer support group, hospice group or even a <br/>
social worker at a local hospital ~ let them know you&#39;re interested in <br/>
donating breastmilk to a patient, to aid in chemo side effects.  You never <br/>
know who you could help! <br/>

donate my breastmilk for such a good cause, how do I do it?! Kelli<br/>

&gt; &quot;Cow&#39;s<br/>

&gt; &gt; drinking donated breastmilk [he was on chemo] I shared the importance of<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; with everyone who was, by then, staring at me for making such a stink<br/>
