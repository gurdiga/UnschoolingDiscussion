<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034135297"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My son joined football a week or so ago and he has decided to not play.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Friday he began to cry and said he didn&#39;t want to go (he also had the flu).<br/>
He said<br/>
he knows we paid the 75.00 for him to play but it just isn&#39;t the way he<br/>
remembers&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am not at the conference (and it is here in my town!).  From what you<br/>
describe of this team- he has made a very good decision.  I came from a<br/>
&quot;sports&quot; family- I was on every team, because it was the only thing my dad<br/>
thought was interesting I guess.  Anyway, I once quit a basketball team when<br/>
I was a junior in high school.  I was torn up about the idea of &quot;quitting&quot;-<br/>
until my former basketball coach, who was helping me with my predicament<br/>
said- &quot;If your hand was in a machine that had this big mallet that was<br/>
pounding down on it rythmically, would you be a quitter if you took your<br/>
hand out?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, trust him.  And you saying, &quot;you know, I trust you and I realize you<br/>
didn&#39;t think it was going to be like this and your father and I know you are<br/>
not a quitter, you are just making a decision that you need to- don&#39;t worry<br/>
about the 75 dollars..&quot;  would be really cool- you guys are on the same<br/>
side.  Think if you gave a 75 dollar gift to your very best friend, but she<br/>
took it back with no refund because it was causing her physical, emotional<br/>
and mental harm (can&#39;t imagine what kind of gift that would be!- some<br/>
necklace that she was allergic to- ha!), you would definately not ask for<br/>
the money back.  The love for your kid is so much more than even your best<br/>
friend- the decision is quite simple when I think of it that way.<br/>
<br/>
Hard to get out of the &quot;training your kid&quot; mind set, (as in &quot;he has to learn<br/>
follow-through and COMMItment!  he can&#39;t be a quitter! I&#39;ll teach him, he<br/>
needs to learn about consequences!&quot;) but really worth it.<br/>
<br/>
In the new &quot;teach your own&quot; there is a part about a football coach who does<br/>
everything differently- it doesnt have to suck so bad.<br/>
<br/>
