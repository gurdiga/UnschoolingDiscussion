&lt;&lt; &quot;What can I do to make your day better?&quot; &gt;&gt; what a great idea!  it reminds <br/>
me of the daily 10+ second kiss idea-- and is similar in promoting spouses <br/>
reuniting each day...<br/>
<br/>
i also love the &quot;realizing unlovable behavior usually needs more love&quot; <br/>
concept and often have to remind myself about that for my kids and myself, <br/>
too-- as well as my spouse.<br/>
<br/>
i was thinking tami, since your children are older, what about calling a <br/>
&quot;team meeting&quot; with them and sharing that you are concerned about dad&#39;s <br/>
discontent and see if they have any creative suggestions-- they might be <br/>
willing to do a lot for dad.  it is DAD, after all.  and if it is approached <br/>
with a we-love-dad-&-respect-his-opinion-so-what-can-we-do-about-this <br/>
attitude, it might be well received.... (my oldest is only 9 so if am being a <br/>
bit too idyllic for teens, sorry!  i would think as they are older they would <br/>
have some great ideas though!!)<br/>
<br/>
your letter brings  up a lot of issues...   sounds like dad feels powerless <br/>
against the tide and just giving him rallied attn. might help.<br/>

     That sounds good.  Since dh and I have had our long talk tonight, I <br/>
think I will also have a long talk with the kids tomorrow.  Since their dad <br/>
has agreen that we can all compromise and work with each other, I will get <br/>
some ideas from the kids on how we can help Dad feel better in this.  <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
