<div id="ygrps-yiv-640942221"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; and found myself aghast at <br/>
&gt; how often adults are telling kids what they can and can&#39;t do, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That reminds me.  I was at the store a few weeks ago, and there was a girl of <br/>
about eight or nine following behind this guy.  She was carrying her coat.  <br/>
The guy turns around and angrily asks, &quot;Who told you you could take off your <br/>
coat?!&quot;  She just said, &quot;But I was hot.&quot;<br/>
Not whining, not asking anyone to carry it for her, and she got yelled at <br/>
because she didn&#39;t ask permission to take off her coat.<br/>
