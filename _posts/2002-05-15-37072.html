<div id="ygrps-yiv-900248490">My 9 year old son has been wearing out our video tape of PBS&#39;s recent<br/>
Frontier House docudrama. I&#39;ve also been reading the Rats of NIMH books to<br/>
him at bedtime. Last night he asked me to find a similar book about American<br/>
frontier life (preferably with animal or fantasy characters). Any ideas out<br/>
there?!! I was a historical novel fanatic when I was about his age, but<br/>
Little House, et al would not be his cup of tea. It would be great to find<br/>
something better than &quot;Feifel Goes West&quot; (which is not even a book, in any<br/>
case).<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557774654">My sons really liked My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighed <br/>
George.  When he is a bit older (there is some cursing) he might like <br/>
The Education of Little Tree.  Also, Sign of the Beaver is really <br/>
neat... settlers up in Maine and a 12 year old boy surviving on his <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;frontier life (preferably with animal or fantasy characters). Any ideas out<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not frontier life, and I can&#39;t remember the name (OH GREAT!! &lt;bwg&gt;) but <br/>
what&#39;s the one about Benjamin Franklin written by a mouse or some such?  It&#39;s <br/>
been years since I read it to my kids.  It&#39;s not quite like the Secret of <br/>
NIMH, but I doubt much else is...<br/>
<br/>
Incredible Journey (about the dogs and the cat who find their way home across <br/>
the wilderness) from which movies were made might be good.  I think I read it <br/>
when I was eleven, and it was a little hard to read, but neat.  <br/>
<br/>
The Redwall series has animals as the main characters, living in a kind of <br/>
medieval-England world.<br/>

And there&#39;s one about Paul Revere too which would turn up if you typed Ben<br/>

  [Joan Wilson] I loved those books.  I read My Side Of The Mountain when I<br/>
was a kid and Sign Of The Beaver with my son last year.<br/>
