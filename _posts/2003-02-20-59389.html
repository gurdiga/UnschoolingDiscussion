<div id="ygrps-yiv-94735421">Any of you in Western Washington, have you had any experiences with<br/>
geriatric care and nursing homes, etc.  Good or bad.  It looks as if my<br/>
mother is going to have to leave the retirement home she&#39;s in.  The dementia<br/>
has progressed to hitting people.  At the least, she has to go for an<br/>
assessment at Highline Hospital in Tukwilla.  I&#39;m going to have to go down<br/>
soon and sign her in there, then probably again when she gets out.  If we&#39;re<br/>
lucky, and she stabilizes on some med or other, she&#39;ll be able to go back to<br/>
where she&#39;s been living.  Otherwise, who knows?  Today she celebrated her<br/>
87th birthday by being told she can&#39;t stay where she is, at least for now.<br/>
Lovely.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear back from anyone with any experience in this area.  I know<br/>
most of you are probably younger than me and have younger parents, but maybe<br/>
someone will have some bit of info that would help me.  Helen, maybe this is<br/>
something you&#39;ve had to deal with?  Actually anyone who has dealt with<br/>
senile dementia in a relative might have tips for me.  I&#39;m all ears.<br/>
