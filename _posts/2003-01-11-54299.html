<div id="ygrps-yiv-227949135"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, I don&#39;t care about some dumb mystery. I want to know what&#39;s going to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>happen&gt; to Claire and Jaime!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hmph!<br/>
&gt;&gt;I&#39;m with you!<br/>
&gt;&gt;Tia<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too, me too. English books are available in Japan way after they are in<br/>
bookstores in the U.S. I finally had to order Fiery Cross from<br/>
www.powells.com and now I&#39;m about halfway through it. Damn, it is GOOD! And<br/>
you say she&#39;s working on another one? Oh joy, oh rapture.<br/>
Now if they would just hurry up and get &quot;Requiem for the Sun&quot; by Elizabeth<br/>
Haydon over here, my bliss would know no bounds. Amazon.com only had it in<br/>
hard cover, I&#39;m not quite that desperate.<br/>
