<div id="ygrps-yiv-428416289">I used to think of Mr. Rogers as a man who was nice in a world full of<br/>
people who weren&#39;t.  He showed me at a verrry early age that there are<br/>
good people in the  world who treat others with respect and even listen<br/>
to children.  Yes, he would pause after asking a question, like he was<br/>
waiting for your response.  And I find Teletubbies to have a relaxing<br/>
effect.  It&#39;s so quiet.  Kind of silly for adults and older children, but<br/>
small children relate to it.  It does something for them.<br/>
