software problem on his computer  - he watched intently for about 10 <br/>
minutes and then I heard him in the other room telling his mom, &quot;She <br/>
doesn&#39;t know how to fix it, she&#39;s just going to play around until <br/>
something happens to work.&quot;<br/>
**************<br/>
There&#39;s an old joke. A man calls a plumber to fix his sink. Plumber comes in, <br/>
whacks the pipes three times, and the problem&#39;s fixed. Plumber gives the man <br/>
a bill for $100.<br/>
<br/>
The man is outraged. &quot;All you did was whack the pipe three times!&quot; he <br/>
screeches.<br/>
<br/>
Plumber looks at the many thoughtfully, takes the bill and tears it up. Then <br/>
the plumber writes a new one:<br/>
<br/>
Whacking on pipes:         $1.00<br/>
Knowing where to whack: $99.00<br/>
<br/>
The man paid the bill.<br/>
