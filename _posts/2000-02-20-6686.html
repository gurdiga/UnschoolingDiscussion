<div id="ygrps-yiv-274249123">Hi folks, <br/>
I am looking for anyone who is or knows anyone who is unschooling in<br/>
Pennsylvania. I have a dear friend in PA who can&#39;t seem to figure out<br/>
how one can unschool there as the laws are very restrictive. She<br/>
would like to take the step into unschooling but just doesn&#39;t know<br/>
how with what the state requires of her. She would love to talk with<br/>
people who are doing it and find out how it can be done. Please e<br/>
mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mrstar@...">mrstar@...</a> if you can help. I am on no mail on<br/>
this list due to time constraints. I do miss many of you. Maybe<br/>
someday (when the kids are grown) I get back into it. :o). Thank you<br/>
so much for your help, in advance, to anyone who can help me help my<br/>
friend. <br/>

LIVING IS LEARNING Curriculum Guides, Nancy Plent.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/hsing.htm#LIL">http://www.holtgws.com/hsing.htm#LIL</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do we know if our children are learning what school covers? How do we<br/>
report unschooling/homeschooling to<br/>
schools?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nancy Plent, the founder of the Unschoolers Network of NJ, compiles the<br/>
curricular goals for each year of school and<br/>
translates them into real-life situations unschoolers can relate to. Packed<br/>
with suggestions for meeting and exceeding<br/>
these guidelines, these books double as record-keepers to help you organize<br/>
your children&#39;s learning into an<br/>
&quot;after-the-fact&quot; curriculum that schools can recognize. Compiled from<br/>
national and state curricular guidelines, these<br/>
books help you see what is going on in most schools for each grade level. A<br/>
confidence builder for anyone wondering if<br/>
they have what it takes to &quot;cover&quot; a year of learning without going to<br/>
school.<br/>

                Homeschooling can be exciting, fulfilling, productive, and<br/>
successful; at times it can also be challenging,<br/>
          isolating, frightening, and stressful. That&#39;s when support is so<br/>
valuable, especially from people who can<br/>
          help you learn from the experiences of thousands of successful<br/>
homeschoolers. John Holt and his<br/>
          Associates have been helping families since the 1960&#39;s through<br/>
his books, the magazine, the bookstore,<br/>
          and conferences.<br/>
<br/>
                We are now offering individualized, in-depth assistance.<br/>
Pat Farenga, President of Holt Associates and<br/>
          Susannah Sheffer, Editor of Growing Without Schooling magazine,<br/>
have accumulated over 2 1/2 decades<br/>
          of information, research, consulting, writing, lecturing and<br/>
media experience and they can help you.<br/>
<br/>
                We offer a 45 minute private consultation for $65, phone<br/>
charge included. (In-office visits receive a<br/>
          $10 reduction.) First, we have you fill out the enclosed<br/>
questionnaire and return it with your payment.<br/>
          Upon receipt, we will call you to set up the appointment time.<br/>
Pat or Susannah will review your<br/>
          questionnaire, then during your 45 minute consultation they will<br/>
suggest answers, uncover resources<br/>
          and give you references for further research. They may also mail<br/>
you written follow-up information.<br/>
<br/>
                Pat and Susannah are able to help with many different<br/>
issues. Please see the list of issues that we can<br/>
          and can not cover.<br/>
<br/>
                We hope you will benefit greatly from our expertise and<br/>
will find workable solutions for your family.<br/>
          Thank you for considering Holt Associates for guidance in your<br/>
homeschooling matters.<br/>
