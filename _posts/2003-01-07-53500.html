<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776851154">This is long but please bear with me-- I need some help!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll start off by introducing myself.  My name is Brandi.  I&#39;m a 30 year old stay-at-home mom of the most wonderfully intelligent, gorgeous children on the planet whom we adopted from Ukraine in 1999.  They are both 5 years old, one boy, one girl, four months apart in age.  They are currently enrolled in kindergarten.  We lost a baby in 1998 and I am pregnant with our fourth child and due in June. You can learn more about me at my website: www.brandiland.com <br/>
<br/>
We started the kids in a head start type program the last semester of last school year.  I regret ever having introduced them to the school system because now it is *impossible* to unteach them the behaviors that they have learned from their peers whose parents fail to recognize polite, respectful means of expressing themselves (ok, was that nice enough and did it convey my point?? No?  Ok, the kids were smarty pants, brats :-)  We, once again, started them in this same school, different class (year-round Montessori school-- what a joke!) hoping they&#39;d have a different experience.  They both DETESTED it.  They didn&#39;t like their teachers, they didn&#39;t like their peers, their environment was HOTTTT in the summer because of lack of air conditioning, etc. etc. etc.  I heard about charter schools and began investigating them.  I found a brand new one that had opened up and they had 2 spots for 2 kindergartners-- perfect!  My kids were enrolled the following week.  Let me preface this by saying that I used to work in the school systems as an interpreter for the Deaf.  As a matter of fact, I worked at the *very* &quot;Montessori&quot; (ha, a joke) school my children initially started.  This new charter school is, hands down, the best public school I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life.  My son absotively has the best teacher I&#39;ve ever met and he loves her to death.  <br/>
<br/>
Let me give a little background on my children.  Firstly, my son, Coliya, is exceptionally gifted-- he&#39;s tested off the charts.  We brought him home from Ukraine and he had some attachment issues related to abuse and neglect.  He has come a VERY long way from a little boy who had no conscience, caring, genuine concern or feelings for anyone but himself to a boy who is respectful, empathetic, sensitive and just as selfish as any other 5 year old is :)  (Yes, I&#39;m patting myself on the back for this-- I can blow raspberries at all of the naysayers who disagreed with the methods I used to parent him INCLUDING my husband, initially!)  Coliya is also hyperactive.  To be perfectly honest, I think there&#39;s a *definite* connection to intelligence and the degree of one&#39;s perceived hyperactivity.  Having said that, I&#39;d still say he&#39;s hyperactive--- LOL.  He&#39;s the most curious, quickest learner, who doesn&#39;t forget a thing, ever.  Let&#39;s move to my daughter, Lyllia.  Lyllia is &quot;stuck&quot; emotionally at about a 3 year old level.  She&#39;s quite intelligent and very imaginative, she is just very emotionall immature &quot;for her age&quot; (comparing to the &quot;norms&quot;, whatever those are!).  She lives in her own little world, doing things at her own pace, as she pleases, IF she pleases, as the notion strikes her.  This is in *everything* she does from schoolwork to getting dressed, to eating, to walking, to playing-- EVERYTHING.  I&#39;ve tried to change this behavior (don&#39;t yell at me-- I was ignorant then!) to no avail (OBVIOUSLY!)  I have since learned that this is her and for me to even attempt to change this about her would be detrimental to her as a person.  (It took me awhile to come around but, I did, finally!)<br/>
<br/>
Enter my predicament.  I am wanting to take Lyllia out of school because it&#39;s not working and it hasn&#39;t worked and it&#39;s not going to work because it just doesn&#39;t work for her.  I also feel that I should take Coliya out, although it&#39;s working for him at least in theory, right now.  I&#39;ll be honest-- I don&#39;t think I can handle unschooling both of them at the same time, initially.  Can I tell you how much GUILT I feel about that???  I feel completely inadequate.  Like any other mother on this list or in the world could take both of them out and be super-mom and I&#39;m failing in so many ways!  As if leaving him in makes me a bad mom.  I honestly feel this way.  These are all feelings I have and I haven&#39;t even STARTED the process!!!  Should I take them both out and try this?  Should I take her out and leave him in because it&#39;s currently working for him?  Should I just forget the whole thing altogether and keep it as it is?  (Yeah, right!)  I seriously think that if I took them both out to do it, I&#39;d go insane :-)  I wish I were kidding.  But I will do anything, if it&#39;s best for my children.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a self-learner.  He was unschooled his whole life.  Of course, they didn&#39;t call it that back then.  He was taken out of school to work for his family, to support them (he&#39;s only 35).  The man is nothing short of a genius.  His unschooling has made him far more capable than any of his counterparts in his field (engineering) however, he lacks a formal education which sometimes stands in his way.  The strange part about this whole thing is, he has more doubts than me.  Here&#39;s a man who is living proof that you don&#39;t have to &quot;attend school&quot; to develop your potential and to LEARN.  Yet, he&#39;s scared about our daughter not &quot;learning enough&quot;.  &quot;How will she learn her ABC&#39;s if there&#39;s no structured environment?&quot;  &quot;How will she learn to read?&quot;  &quot;How will...&quot; these are questions he continues to ask.  And guess what?  I don&#39;t have an answer for him because I don&#39;t have a clue.  And I told him *just* that.  He&#39;s supportive of me homeschooling and unschooling, to a certain extent because, as he said, &quot;I have always believed that&#39;s how a child should learn--- hands on, from everything around him-- going to the store, mowing the lawn-- everything is a learning experience.&quot;  I know that if he feels that I feel it&#39;s best, he will trust my judgment, at least for a little while, just to see how things go.  I feel it certainly can&#39;t hurt.  What we are doing right now isn&#39;t working so, trying something else couldn&#39;t work any LESS-- what do I have to lose?<br/>
<br/>
So, where do I begin?  How do I &quot;meet the requirements&quot; of Ohio by unschooling?  I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be thrilled to get the piece of paper across their desk that says I&#39;m withdrawing her from school (sorry, I don&#39;t know the formal names of the paperwork yet!) saying &quot;yeah, we are just going to see what happens&quot;...lol.  No, no, I&#39;m being facetious.  I know that I have to put something under curriculum-- I&#39;m just not sure what?  Also, where do I start with a 5 year old who is, emotionally 3 or 3.5 years old, at best?  As far as attempting to progress her emotionally, I plan on regressing her, going back through the stages she missed when I wasn&#39;t there to be her mommy.  I think this will be *highly* beneficial based on the research I&#39;ve been doing.  But as far as &quot;schooling&quot; goes-- what approach do I take for someone who is so young?  I read Sandra Dodd&#39;s website this morning-- the part that concerned deschooling and I&#39;m thinking that might, indeed, be the way to go.  But, what do I know?  I am TOTALLY clueless.  I feel like I&#39;m like I&#39;m a sailboat in the middle of the ocean, waiting for a strong wind to give me some direction.  The question is-- will y&#39;all be my strong wind and guide me?  I&#39;m really lost and I sincerely need help and I *really* want to make this work.  I want to do what&#39;s right for my children.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much, in advance, if you&#39;ve made it through this novel.  I can&#39;t tell you how much I appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339367762">Welcome Brandi,<br/>
First off take a deep breath.  I am new to this list as well but we have been <br/>
an unschooling family since the family started.  Relax and trust your <br/>
children.  I don&#39;t know about the laws in your state but I am sure someone on <br/>
this list does and can help you through that process.  My boys have never <br/>
seen the inside of a school, public or private, and I have never regretted <br/>
that decision.  You sound like a loving, caring parent and I am sure that all <br/>
of your children will flourish in your unschooling family.  But that is a <br/>
decision that you and your husband have to make.  You know your children <br/>
best.  Better than any teacher, no matter how wonderful.  Just relax and let <br/>
your children live.  Don&#39;t worry about the tomorrows.  You will certainly <br/>
gain a lot of information from just reading this list.  And I am sure others <br/>
have lots of words of wisdom.<br/>
Welcome again to the list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-111528238">**How will she <br/>
learn her ABC&#39;s if there&#39;s no structured environment?**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Brandi (and Brandi&#39;s husband) --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned, from reading Punished by Rewards, that a lot of<br/>
&quot;scientific&quot; ideas about education were derived from conditioning<br/>
experiments on lab rats and pigeons.  Human beings have much greater<br/>
learning abilities than birds and rodents.  Children don&#39;t need an<br/>
organized system of deprivation and reward to make learning happen.  I<br/>
don&#39;t even think they need a &quot;structured environment&quot;.  I think they<br/>
need an interesting environment and exposure to a rich life.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband might really benefit from reading Linda Dobson&#39;s column,<br/>
The Gift of Flow, in the Nov-Dec 2002 issue of HEM.  I really thought it<br/>
was great.  (And it sounds complicated and scientific.  I just don&#39;t<br/>
know if it&#39;s clear for someone who hasn&#39;t had a lot of exposure to<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling already.  It&#39;s pretty sophisticated stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
She quotes from Csikszentmihaly&#39;s book, Finding Flow: The Psychology of<br/>
Engagement with Everyday Life.  The third condition for achieving flow<br/>
is &quot;A person&#39;s skills are fully involved in overcoming a challenge that<br/>
is just about manageable.&quot;  I think this is the level that unschooled<br/>
children seek out for themselves.  In education school, my husband (a<br/>
teacher) studied similar concepts, but it&#39;s nearly impossible for him to<br/>
establish tasks for his 9th Graders that engage them that much and<br/>
challenge them just the right amount.  Yet this happens very naturally<br/>
in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The decision about taking one or both kids out of school is a tough one.<br/>
 Especially when you are pregnant and will soon be busy with an infant. <br/>
If you feel that one of your children is being more harmed by<br/>
Kindergarden than the other, then I can understand why you would want to<br/>
take that child out first.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
**He&#39;s supportive of <br/>
me homeschooling and unschooling, to a certain extent because, as he <br/>
said, &quot;I have always believed that&#39;s how a child should learn--- <br/>
hands on, from everything around him-- going to the store, mowing <br/>
the lawn-- everything is a learning experience.&quot; **<br/>
<br/>
This is a good start.  Maybe he&#39;s just having a hard time believing it<br/>
also works with less concrete topics, like the alphabet.<br/>
<br/>
** Also, where do I start with a 5 year old <br/>
who is, emotionally 3 or 3.5 years old, at best?**<br/>
<br/>
I would say start where you are: love, cuddling and play.  I would never<br/>
underestimate the power of a mother&#39;s love.  The education establishment<br/>
may not respect it, but I do!  About 70 years ago parenting &quot;experts&quot;<br/>
were positive that cuddling was bad for children.  After seeing examples<br/>
of scientific stupidity like that, I never want to listen to another<br/>
so-called expert.</div>

&lt;&lt;  I&#39;ll be honest-- I don&#39;t think I can handle <br/>

<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t like schooling or teaching.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take any more time to &quot;unschool&quot; one person that two.<br/>
And if there&#39;s another person in the situation, that&#39;s another piece of <br/>
input, someone else to play with, someone else to play off of, and there&#39;s <br/>
less work and responsibility for you than if you are the ONLY other person <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; As if leaving him in makes me a bad mom.  I honestly <br/>
feel this way.  These are all feelings I have and I haven&#39;t even <br/>
STARTED the process!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You did express a LOT of feelings.  Lots of pride and frustration and fear <br/>
and doubt and anger and joy and...  none of it matters if you&#39;re going to <br/>
unschool.  None of the school stories matter if you&#39;re going to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Should I take them both out and try this?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
IF they both want to come home, you should take them both out and DO this.  <br/>
Don&#39;t &quot;try it.&quot;  How will you know if it has worked?  How long will you give <br/>
it and what will they have to learn or perform for you to decide it was a <br/>
success?<br/>
<br/>
If you want to unschool to get them away from school&#39;s crowded nonsensical <br/>
pressure, than you succeed the moment they leave school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Should I take her out and leave him in because it&#39;s currently <br/>
working for him? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What does HE want to do?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, where do I begin?  How do I &quot;meet the requirements&quot; of Ohio by <br/>
unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Carol Narigon is in Ohio and used this as a curriculum.  You could easily <br/>
adapt it.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum</a><br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...As far as attempting to progress her emotionally...<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &quot;progress&quot; anyone ANYTHING.  People progress on their own.  It&#39;s an <br/>
intransitive verb.  I progress.  You don&#39;t progress me.   Same with learning. <br/>
 She learns.  You don&#39;t learn her.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of planning what you will do to her, I think you&#39;ll do better if you <br/>
are just WITH her, attentive to her, WITH her, letting her be what she is at <br/>
each moment, trying to make her comfortable and peacefully happy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But as far as &quot;schooling&quot; goes-- what <br/>
approach do I take for someone who is so young?  I read Sandra <br/>
Dodd&#39;s website this morning-- the part that concerned deschooling <br/>
and I&#39;m thinking that might, indeed, be the way to go.  But, what do <br/>
I know?  I am TOTALLY clueless.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not clueless. Hang around with those who used to be afraid and aren&#39;t <br/>
anymore, and soak in that confidence!  It&#39;s free!<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;schooling&quot; ANYONE, don&#39;t take any approach.  Don&#39;t school anyone.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I feel like I&#39;m like I&#39;m a sailboat <br/>
in the middle of the ocean, waiting for a strong wind to give me <br/>
some direction.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AHA!!!!  Here is the trick.  If you&#39;re on a sailboat in the middle of the <br/>
ocean, what&#39;s for lunch?  What can you see in the sky?  What does the water <br/>
look like?  Seen any water mammals?  Fish?  Any cool seaweed floating around <br/>
there?  Any FedEx packages?   Is the wind blowing?  How long has it been <br/>
since you were on shore?  How do you know?  Are the kids scared?  Can you <br/>
jolly them up?  Do you know any songs about water or boats?  Can you play a <br/>
rhyming game?<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to GET somewhere else to start being with your children.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to obtain &quot;stuff&quot; to start learning from what is right around <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
I see two things in your post that I think you could jettison with great <br/>
benefit to you and your whole family:  Stop saying &quot;gifted,&quot; and stop <br/>
thinking &quot;gifted/not gifted.&quot;   Stop thinking &quot;genius.&quot;   And the other is if <br/>
Coliya and Lyllia are your adopted children, why do you keep saying &quot;adopted&quot; <br/>
and if they&#39;re going to be Americans why do you keep saying &quot;Ukraine&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Call them their names, and say they&#39;re you&#39;re children so they will FEEL that <br/>
way instead of feeling like &quot;adopted from the Ukraine&quot; is part of their name.<br/>

<br/>
I have a question, which my alleiviate all the fears of what &quot;curriculum&quot;<br/>
you are going to tell the school you are using.  What is the mandatory age<br/>
for schooling in Ohio.  I am sure you can find that on the internet or by<br/>
calling a Homeschool association in Ohio.  I took my son out of school when<br/>
he was beginning the first grade.  He was six years old at the time.  I live<br/>
in North Dakota, and didn&#39;t know much about homeschooling at the time (we<br/>
made the decision on a Friday and withdrew him the next Monday), but what I<br/>
found out is that the age for compulsory education is 7, so legally he<br/>
didn&#39;t even have to be in school.  I suspect that may be true in Ohio too.<br/>
I will try to find that and let you know.  If that is the case, all you have<br/>
to do is say you do not feel she is ready to be in school.  Actually, that<br/>
is all you have to say anyway at this point.  I know many people in this<br/>
area who have waited a year to put their children in school.  Just because<br/>
you don&#39;t intend to ever put her back in, does not mean that you cannot tell<br/>
them that now.  It is true, from what you say.  And then just go back to<br/>
living like you did before the children started school, and read, read, read<br/>
about unschooling, homeschooling, etc.  She will be fine :&gt;! (As he will,<br/>
and I am sure once you figure the whole thing out you will know what is best<br/>
for the whole family).<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Need help-- please!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This is long but please bear with me-- I need some help!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll start off by introducing myself.  My name is Brandi.  I&#39;m a 30<br/>
&gt; year old stay-at-home mom of the most wonderfully intelligent,<br/>
&gt; gorgeous children on the planet whom we adopted from Ukraine in<br/>
&gt; 1999.  They are both 5 years old, one boy, one girl, four months<br/>
&gt; apart in age.  They are currently enrolled in kindergarten.  We lost<br/>
&gt; a baby in 1998 and I am pregnant with our fourth child and due in<br/>
&gt; June. You can learn more about me at my website: www.brandiland.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We started the kids in a head start type program the last semester<br/>
&gt; of last school year.  I regret ever having introduced them to the<br/>
&gt; school system because now it is *impossible* to unteach them the<br/>
&gt; behaviors that they have learned from their peers whose parents fail<br/>
&gt; to recognize polite, respectful means of expressing themselves (ok,<br/>
&gt; was that nice enough and did it convey my point?? No?  Ok, the kids<br/>
&gt; were smarty pants, brats :-)  We, once again, started them in this<br/>
&gt; same school, different class (year-round Montessori school-- what a<br/>
&gt; joke!) hoping they&#39;d have a different experience.  They both<br/>
&gt; DETESTED it.  They didn&#39;t like their teachers, they didn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; their peers, their environment was HOTTTT in the summer because of<br/>
&gt; lack of air conditioning, etc. etc. etc.  I heard about charter<br/>
&gt; schools and began investigating them.  I found a brand new one that<br/>
&gt; had opened up and they had 2 spots for 2 kindergartners-- perfect!<br/>
&gt; My kids were enrolled the following week.  Let me preface this by<br/>
&gt; saying that I used to work in the school systems as an interpreter<br/>
&gt; for the Deaf.  As a matter of fact, I worked at the<br/>
&gt; *very* &quot;Montessori&quot; (ha, a joke) school my children initially<br/>
&gt; started.  This new charter school is, hands down, the best public<br/>
&gt; school I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life.  My son absotively has the<br/>
&gt; best teacher I&#39;ve ever met and he loves her to death.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me give a little background on my children.  Firstly, my son,<br/>
&gt; Coliya, is exceptionally gifted-- he&#39;s tested off the charts.  We<br/>
&gt; brought him home from Ukraine and he had some attachment issues<br/>
&gt; related to abuse and neglect.  He has come a VERY long way from a<br/>
&gt; little boy who had no conscience, caring, genuine concern or<br/>
&gt; feelings for anyone but himself to a boy who is respectful,<br/>
&gt; empathetic, sensitive and just as selfish as any other 5 year old<br/>
&gt; is :)  (Yes, I&#39;m patting myself on the back for this-- I can blow<br/>
&gt; raspberries at all of the naysayers who disagreed with the methods I<br/>
&gt; used to parent him INCLUDING my husband, initially!)  Coliya is also<br/>
&gt; hyperactive.  To be perfectly honest, I think there&#39;s a *definite*<br/>
&gt; connection to intelligence and the degree of one&#39;s perceived<br/>
&gt; hyperactivity.  Having said that, I&#39;d still say he&#39;s hyperactive---<br/>
&gt; LOL.  He&#39;s the most curious, quickest learner, who doesn&#39;t forget a<br/>
&gt; thing, ever.  Let&#39;s move to my daughter, Lyllia.  Lyllia is &quot;stuck&quot;<br/>
&gt; emotionally at about a 3 year old level.  She&#39;s quite intelligent<br/>
&gt; and very imaginative, she is just very emotionall immature &quot;for her<br/>
&gt; age&quot; (comparing to the &quot;norms&quot;, whatever those are!).  She lives in<br/>
&gt; her own little world, doing things at her own pace, as she pleases,<br/>
&gt; IF she pleases, as the notion strikes her.  This is in *everything*<br/>
&gt; she does from schoolwork to getting dressed, to eating, to walking,<br/>
&gt; to playing-- EVERYTHING.  I&#39;ve tried to change this behavior (don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; yell at me-- I was ignorant then!) to no avail (OBVIOUSLY!)  I have<br/>
&gt; since learned that this is her and for me to even attempt to change<br/>
&gt; this about her would be detrimental to her as a person.  (It took me<br/>
&gt; awhile to come around but, I did, finally!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enter my predicament.  I am wanting to take Lyllia out of school<br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s not working and it hasn&#39;t worked and it&#39;s not going to<br/>
&gt; work because it just doesn&#39;t work for her.  I also feel that I<br/>
&gt; should take Coliya out, although it&#39;s working for him at least in<br/>
&gt; theory, right now.  I&#39;ll be honest-- I don&#39;t think I can handle<br/>
&gt; unschooling both of them at the same time, initially.  Can I tell<br/>
&gt; you how much GUILT I feel about that???  I feel completely<br/>
&gt; inadequate.  Like any other mother on this list or in the world<br/>
&gt; could take both of them out and be super-mom and I&#39;m failing in so<br/>
&gt; many ways!  As if leaving him in makes me a bad mom.  I honestly<br/>
&gt; feel this way.  These are all feelings I have and I haven&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; STARTED the process!!!  Should I take them both out and try this?<br/>
&gt; Should I take her out and leave him in because it&#39;s currently<br/>
&gt; working for him?  Should I just forget the whole thing altogether<br/>
&gt; and keep it as it is?  (Yeah, right!)  I seriously think that if I<br/>
&gt; took them both out to do it, I&#39;d go insane :-)  I wish I were<br/>
&gt; kidding.  But I will do anything, if it&#39;s best for my children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband is a self-learner.  He was unschooled his whole life.  Of<br/>
&gt; course, they didn&#39;t call it that back then.  He was taken out of<br/>
&gt; school to work for his family, to support them (he&#39;s only 35).  The<br/>
&gt; man is nothing short of a genius.  His unschooling has made him far<br/>
&gt; more capable than any of his counterparts in his field (engineering)<br/>
&gt; however, he lacks a formal education which sometimes stands in his<br/>
&gt; way.  The strange part about this whole thing is, he has more doubts<br/>
&gt; than me.  Here&#39;s a man who is living proof that you don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to &quot;attend school&quot; to develop your potential and to LEARN.  Yet,<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s scared about our daughter not &quot;learning enough&quot;.  &quot;How will she<br/>
&gt; learn her ABC&#39;s if there&#39;s no structured environment?&quot;  &quot;How will<br/>
&gt; she learn to read?&quot;  &quot;How will...&quot; these are questions he continues<br/>
&gt; to ask.  And guess what?  I don&#39;t have an answer for him because I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have a clue.  And I told him *just* that.  He&#39;s supportive of<br/>
&gt; me homeschooling and unschooling, to a certain extent because, as he<br/>
&gt; said, &quot;I have always believed that&#39;s how a child should learn---<br/>
&gt; hands on, from everything around him-- going to the store, mowing<br/>
&gt; the lawn-- everything is a learning experience.&quot;  I know that if he<br/>
&gt; feels that I feel it&#39;s best, he will trust my judgment, at least for<br/>
&gt; a little while, just to see how things go.  I feel it certainly<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t hurt.  What we are doing right now isn&#39;t working so, trying<br/>
&gt; something else couldn&#39;t work any LESS-- what do I have to lose?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, where do I begin?  How do I &quot;meet the requirements&quot; of Ohio by<br/>
&gt; unschooling?  I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be thrilled to get the piece of paper<br/>
&gt; across their desk that says I&#39;m withdrawing her from school (sorry,<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know the formal names of the paperwork yet!) saying &quot;yeah,<br/>
&gt; we are just going to see what happens&quot;...lol.  No, no, I&#39;m being<br/>
&gt; facetious.  I know that I have to put something under curriculum--<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just not sure what?  Also, where do I start with a 5 year old<br/>
&gt; who is, emotionally 3 or 3.5 years old, at best?  As far as<br/>
&gt; attempting to progress her emotionally, I plan on regressing her,<br/>
&gt; going back through the stages she missed when I wasn&#39;t there to be<br/>
&gt; her mommy.  I think this will be *highly* beneficial based on the<br/>
&gt; research I&#39;ve been doing.  But as far as &quot;schooling&quot; goes-- what<br/>
&gt; approach do I take for someone who is so young?  I read Sandra<br/>
&gt; Dodd&#39;s website this morning-- the part that concerned deschooling<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m thinking that might, indeed, be the way to go.  But, what do<br/>
&gt; I know?  I am TOTALLY clueless.  I feel like I&#39;m like I&#39;m a sailboat<br/>
&gt; in the middle of the ocean, waiting for a strong wind to give me<br/>
&gt; some direction.  The question is-- will y&#39;all be my strong wind and<br/>
&gt; guide me?  I&#39;m really lost and I sincerely need help and I *really*<br/>
&gt; want to make this work.  I want to do what&#39;s right for my children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you so much, in advance, if you&#39;ve made it through this<br/>
&gt; novel.  I can&#39;t tell you how much I appreciate it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Warmly,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

I check it out and compulsory schooling for Ohio is &quot;between six and<br/>
eighteen years of age.&quot;  So, if she is still five, they can say a thing.<br/>
Just go in and tell them she is not ready for school yet.  Don&#39;t fill out<br/>
any paperwork, etc.  But, get yourself prepared for when she turns six.  I<br/>
got my info at the HSLDA site.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I know?  I am TOTALLY clueless.  I feel like I&#39;m like I&#39;m a sailboat<br/>
&gt; in the middle of the ocean, waiting for a strong wind to give me<br/>
&gt; some direction.  The question is-- will y&#39;all be my strong wind and<br/>
&gt; guide me?  I&#39;m really lost and I sincerely need help and I *really*<br/>
&gt; want to make this work.  I want to do what&#39;s right for my children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you so much, in advance, if you&#39;ve made it through this<br/>
&gt; novel.  I can&#39;t tell you how much I appreciate it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Warmly,<br/>

Although I don&#39;t agree with everything you have said,  I appreciate your feedback and you&#39;ve given me some things to think about :)<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the &quot;adopted from Ukraine&quot; in reference to my children-- it&#39;s a merit I wear proudly, something they are very proud of, something we are all proud of.  I *literally* risked my life and my sanity to get my children.  They are my children who are Americans but they are also by nationality and citizenship, Ukrainians as well, at least for the next 18 years on the citizenship part :)<br/>
<br/>
Adoption is a very special thing that I cherish, just as others cherish their &quot;cloth diapered, sling-worn babies&quot;-- all are adjectives.  You can&#39;t understand my reasons until you know my personal story so please don&#39;t assign a deeper meaning to the adjectives I choose! :)<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>
Brandi<br/>
<br/>
I see two things in your post that I think you could jettison with great <br/>
benefit to you and your whole family:  Stop saying &quot;gifted,&quot; and stop <br/>
thinking &quot;gifted/not gifted.&quot;   Stop thinking &quot;genius.&quot;   And the other is if <br/>
Coliya and Lyllia are your adopted children, why do you keep saying &quot;adopted&quot; <br/>
and if they&#39;re going to be Americans why do you keep saying &quot;Ukraine&quot;?<br/>

Wow, that sure puts a loophole in things doesn&#39;t it!  I am glad I don&#39;t live<br/>
in TN I guess, lol.(But also wish I didn&#39;t live in ND!)  Before I took my<br/>
son out, I called our state homeschooling association and they gave me the<br/>
advice I gave.  So I guess I should have put a disclaimer on my post that<br/>
she should check things oout with her own homeschooling association.  Didn&#39;t<br/>
mean to cause trouble, just trying to make her aware the alternative.  I<br/>
really believe in never giving the government school any more than you are<br/>
required to give, and knowing your own state laws is important in this<br/>
regard.<br/>

    You&#39;ve gotten so excellent post on the other issues. I&#39;ll address Ohio.<br/>
Where are you located? Notifing is the same everwhere in the state. If you<br/>
are local and want to talk I&#39;ll send my # offlist.<br/>
    Ohio isn&#39;t really that hard to notify in. You send it to the<br/>
superintendent. You may give the school a courtesy call or letter to let<br/>
them know your intent to homeschool. Here are a few places to start. IMNSHO<br/>
Never trust the hslda site. It is always best to check local sources.<br/>
Compulsory age is 6-18yo but since you enrolled your children in Head Start<br/>
(Gov&#39;t School) you need to notify. These sites have some examples in the<br/>
files. SWCAH, HS & More, and Inches are inclusive support groups in and<br/>
around Columbus. You can e me direct too. Homemama @ infinet.com (without<br/>
the spaces)<br/>
<br/>
OHS (A general Ohio elist and site) I&#39;d get on here and ask questions.<br/>
This one and INCHES have notification info in the links<br/>

<br/>
    I&#39;d suggest deschooling. Then on to the unschooling life. Enjoy your<br/>
journey. We&#39;re as close as your keyboard. Maybe your phone. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&quot;What we are doing is just a drop in the ocean.  But if<br/>
that drop was not in the ocean, I think the ocean would be<br/>
less because of that missing drop.  I do not agree with<br/>
the big way of doing things.&quot;<br/>

Same here! I know people are hesitent sometimes to leave their kids here <br/>
because they think with 4 already, not to mention the critters, more kids <br/>
are such a trouble. And the house is actually great with the extra bodies <br/>
and if anything, I have more time for me stuff!!!<br/>
