&gt;&gt;&gt;Brit, when asked by me if she&#39;d like to do a speech on<br/>
&gt; the woodland indians<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Make a speech to whom??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A speech/history co-op we belong to that meets on Monday mornings. The kids<br/>
range in age from 3 to 11 and have the option of presenting a speech to the<br/>
group, on or off topic, and then one of the moms puts together an on-topic<br/>
craft (Woodland Indians was my week, we did weaving with construction paper)<br/>
that anyone who wants to can participate in, and the rest of the 2 hours is<br/>
a playdate, basically.<br/>
