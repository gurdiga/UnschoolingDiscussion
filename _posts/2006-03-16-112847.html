<div id="ygrps-yiv-6527497">I was putting my thoughts on paper of how I see this process unfolding<br/>
in our house and thought I&#39;d share -  <br/>
<br/>
I often wonder what&#39;s going on inside those heads of my guys (Evan-6 &<br/>
Seth-4).  Conversation reveals so much, yet those wheels are<br/>
constantly spinning and I wonder what they&#39;re piecing together.  Then<br/>
&quot;BAM&quot; out they come with what was internally going on!  <br/>
<br/>
Lately, my guys have been outwardly showing their interest in the<br/>
written language.  They have both delved deeper into making sense of<br/>
the written word.  It&#39;s such fun to witness and participate in their<br/>
processes.  They each have been making sense of this in their own<br/>
individual meaningful ways, yet they so complement one another.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentally travel back in time I recall them both visually, orally,<br/>
tactilely taking in their new worlds.  Then, in terms of language,<br/>
there was the start of their coos and babbles, which eventually<br/>
evolved into the utterances of first words.  This has developed into<br/>
our current conversations.  <br/>
<br/>
The process has included the time of recognition of symbols as we<br/>
drove places (Target, Jamba Juice) to familiar food labels in the<br/>
grocery and our home pantry.  I recall them both pointing out familiar<br/>
letters while reading stories or seeing words while out and about.  <br/>
<br/>
A while back my older son would flip through frequently read books and<br/>
tell the story verbatim, and I mean verbatim!  The memory/recall<br/>
amazes me.  Goes to show that when something is important/meaningful<br/>
it&#39;s internalized.  <br/>
<br/>
They both went through a time of stringing rows and rows and rowsof<br/>
letters/numbers together on the computer and having dh or me &quot;read&quot;<br/>
what they wrote.  They would crack up as we gave our best effort and<br/>
read &quot;jibberish.&quot;    On occasion they&#39;ll write, but not all that<br/>
interested in putting pen/paint/crayon to paper for writing.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, my younger one would point letters out and associate it<br/>
with a meaningful character to him (superheroes).  He would point to a<br/>
letter B and say &quot;B for Batman&quot; &quot;N for Nightwing&quot;, I loved when he did<br/>
S cuz he&#39;d say &quot;S for Superman, me and you, mom&quot;  His name is Seth and<br/>
mine is Susan, so indeed S is for me and mom.  As a Star Wars fan he<br/>
now thinks it&#39;s neat that a letter switcheroo (e becomes i) turns Seth<br/>
into Sith!  Turning `mom&#39; upside to become `wow&#39; is pretty neat too.<br/>
<br/>
My older one likes to play his self created trivia game where he will<br/>
give clues with letters such as Bionicle with a T (Tahu), Star Wars<br/>
jedi with an A (Anakin).    He now also will `read&#39; over my shoulder<br/>
commenting on familiar words he notices, such as his name or important<br/>
words in his world - primarily from all his gaming (play, ready,<br/>
enter)  and he&#39;ll pull letters inquiring as to what something says.<br/>
There will be silence (those are the times I wonder what&#39;s cookin&#39; in<br/>
there) and he&#39;ll blurt out &quot;Is L for Lord?  Is V for Voldemort?&quot;  The<br/>
other day he came up to me and said &quot;How do you spellno waitK is for<br/>
candy, isn&#39;t it?&quot;   Just today he says &quot;1-3, thirteen.  Hey, that has<br/>
a T like teenager&quot; <br/>
<br/>
They both now have such a clear, strong recognition of letters and<br/>
have been into asking what things say by pulling the letters.  &quot;What&#39;s<br/>
&quot;G-A-M-E-S-T-O-P?&quot;  My older one will pull phrases and say something<br/>
like &quot;What&#39;s T-H-E  space  E-N-D?&quot;   He notices and acknowledges the<br/>
spaces between words.  I think that&#39;s cool. <br/>
<br/>
Last night they were playing Lincoln Logs together when Seth made and<br/>
X for X-Men.  Evan made the same configuration, held it at a different<br/>
angle and said &quot;plus&quot;  They both put them down and said they were<br/>
Ninja stars.  Onto next activity<br/>
 <br/>
In wrapping up my long-windedness I just think the way this process<br/>
plays out is so cool! The pieces are coming together in meaningful<br/>
ways for them.  It&#39;s not phonetically forced, doesn&#39;t have negative<br/>
associations  I watch/listen/play throughout the day and know my<br/>
happy, curious, energetic bundles of love would be completely<br/>
different beings if their impressionable selves were placed in the<br/>
hands of the system.</div>

Yikes! So I explained that in our language vowels (a e i o and u) <br/>
are helpful to pronounce things so my tongue wouldn&#39;t get in a knot. <br/>
He&#39;d put a couple in and I&#39;d gamely give it a go. Then he&#39;d <br/>
overcompensate and string together all the vowels he could find with <br/>
no consonants. Now he&#39;s interested in how other languages say things <br/>
(I can toss in a smattering of Spanish and French for simple stuff) <br/>
because French words sound so different(mostly started because he <br/>
likes going to buffet restaurants).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264885634">When my 18 yo son was about 4, he drew a bunch of letters on a piece of  <br/>
paper and asked his sisters what it said.  They were really little too and  <br/>
laughed and said, &quot;that doesn&#39;t say anything CJ!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
He took it to my husband and showed him, and he said, &quot;What do you  mean?  <br/>
That says Sheebeepeemifff &quot;  That&#39;s not how he spelled it but  it&#39;s how my <br/>
husband pronounced it.  He wrote something like shbbpmf.   To this day, we still <br/>
use the word!<br/>
