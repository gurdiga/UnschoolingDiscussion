one in his room stay on with no sound so he doesn&#39;t have to see the face of <br/>
some alien on it when he wakes! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

That is so cool.  <br/>
<br/>
I just saw it a few weeks ago with Marty, who had seen it in the theater and <br/>
wanted to watch it with me.  But we&#39;re desert rats and have never known <br/>
anyone who owned a combine!  Here, people tend to pick corn by hand and then <br/>
just plow the dried-up stalks up in the spring.  <br/>

I can&#39;t get that visual out of my head!! Creepy.<br/>
We finally watched it last week and Jared won&#39;t go to the bathroom alone now. <br/>
He&#39;s mad that I let him watch it...:) Poor guy.<br/>
I didn&#39;t know it would creep him out so bad, he&#39;s seen much worse. But it WAS <br/>
very spine tingling kind of scary.<br/>
We kept wondering WHY didn&#39;t they go to the lake?<br/>
&#39;Course the movie would have been over in that case too.<br/>
Cut the corn or go to the lake..DUH<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
