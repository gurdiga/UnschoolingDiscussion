<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661477732">&quot;Ren: I want to hear more about that signature shawl!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I called it that because Diana always had a shawl on!!:) I think it <br/>
was the same one...lovely shades of oranges, bright and fiery like her <br/>
personality.<br/>
<br/>
My sister actually remembered the shawl after the conference, but <br/>
couldn&#39;t remember Diana&#39;s name and wrote the list to ask about it. <br/>
Kelli T (best friends w/Diana&#39;s family) answered her back. My sis <br/>
ended up hiring Kelli to knit a shawl for her!<br/>
<br/>
So...that&#39;s the shawl story, as much as I know of it.  I bet Diana <br/>
knit it herself. <br/>
<br/>
If you go look at some of the conference pics, there&#39;s one of Diana at <br/>
margeuritaville in her shawl.:)<br/>
