You are right that it is the shy one who does complain, but no I do not do<br/>
it publicly.  It is usually a request, when we are driving to the event,<br/>
with me knowing what the set-up will be.  A lot of the things this child<br/>
says no to are because he is shy, and I have no idea how to get around that<br/>
one.  That is another whole topic!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; **What I do know about this, is that my previous method hasn&#39;t helped very<br/>
&gt; much.  I often have suggested that they help someone do something when we<br/>
&gt; are with a group.  My son, especially, often responds quite negatively to<br/>
&gt; this request.  I have then sometimes told him that he had to, and other<br/>
&gt; times told him to forget it (but probably not with the best attitude on my<br/>
&gt; part).**<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Speaking as someone who has been on the receiving end of maternal<br/>
&gt; prodding, what I visualize (which may not be what you do) feels very<br/>
&gt; much like a public reprimand.  Shy children do not like to be shoved<br/>
&gt; into the spotlight and told that they should be doing more.  Even un-shy<br/>
&gt; children may not be thrilled about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anticipating the situation beforehand and telling your child that<br/>
&gt; cleanup is fairer if everyone helps might work better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My two cents,<br/>
