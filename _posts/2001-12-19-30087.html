&gt; &gt; I&#39;m guessing you may be one who belives only in the Word in the<br/>
&gt; Bible....so<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll ask where it says that.  Though it doesn&#39;t say anywhere (the<br/>
&gt; Bible)<br/>
&gt; &gt; that it is to be the ONLY and final authority on love.  Why wwould<br/>
&gt; their be<br/>
&gt; &gt; and end to prophesies?   And bibles are different....is mine &quot;wrong&quot;<br/>
&gt; since<br/>
&gt; &gt; it contains more books?  Are the Dead Sea Scrolls meaningless if<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; weren&#39;t found at the time some Bibles were being compiled?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Susan<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe that God can still speak to men today.  However, He NEVER<br/>
&gt; gives men a prophecy that contradicts what is in God&#39;s Word. If<br/>
&gt; two different sources give contradicting info about God, one of them<br/>
&gt; has to be wrong.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s pretty amazing how much the Kings James version of the Bible (and my<br/>
own Bible, for that matter) has contradictory words.  How do you decide<br/>
which to use?<br/>
