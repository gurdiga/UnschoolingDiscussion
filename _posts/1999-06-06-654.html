<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038059412">Villifying our parents and grandparents isn&#39;t the way to go here.  <br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t villifying my family or the system, simply stating that the model<br/>
for todays ps isn&#39;t one which is in place to teach real life skills. But my<br/>
family (as far back as you&#39;d like to go) was never involved in making<br/>
decisions about schools.<br/>

I just wanted to add a little story of my own on this subject.  My father<br/>
is a politically active Deomocrat and a firm believer in the power of John<br/>
Q. Public to change the world, at least in OUR political system.  I cannot<br/>
count the number of times that I heard the story about him being president<br/>
of the school board when the oldest 4 kids in our family were in their<br/>
primary grades.  He is a firm believer in the whole idea of the ps system<br/>
and an education for everyone.  Equality and the &quot;chicken in every pot&quot;<br/>
American dream.<br/>
<br/>
However, by the time I reached the public school system in the 80&#39;s (I am<br/>
dating myself here) there were a lot more, and serious, problems with ps<br/>
besides the flaws inherent in the system that we all see as Unschoolers.  I<br/>
also grew up in a big city (San Francisco) and frankly ps was dangerous for<br/>
me.  It wasn&#39;t the threat of violence, it was ACTUAL violence, performed on<br/>
me, not around me although there was that too.  Of course there were LOTS<br/>
of other problems too.  I was an avid reader and have always been a self<br/>
motivated learner, but I just did not do well in the ps.  <br/>
<br/>
My father, however, being more of a concearned citizen than a father IMHO,<br/>
kept my brother and I in ps NO MATTER WHAT, to satisfy his lofty<br/>
principles, to pay homage to the IDEAL at the cost of his own youngest two<br/>
children.  How is that for a parent SO involved in the education of their<br/>
children (or at least in the education &quot;system&quot;) that they are not at all<br/>
involved with the CHILDREN themselves, or in their lives?  To this day we<br/>
do not communicate well and he still has no idea who I really am, what I<br/>
really know or believe.  He is one of those parents that attributes every<br/>
intelligent thing that comes out of your mouth to themselves (&quot;I wonder<br/>
where you learned that?&quot; wink and nod to friends...&quot;)    <br/>
