<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722336834">I&#39;m going to drive you all crazy I just know it!  Okay, I think it&#39;s <br/>
been at least 2 weeks (I hope it&#39;s been that long)that I posted here <br/>
and got some great advice - the main thing being to just say school <br/>
is done for the year, no more me asking her every day what she wants <br/>
to do, filling her backpack with things to do while I work - to just <br/>
back off!<br/>
<br/>
Since then, my daughter has LIVED on the computer, she discovered a <br/>
new game and the normal routine is for her to stay up until 2am, <br/>
watch Roseanne until 3am, read a little bit  and probably fall asleep <br/>
by 4am or so.  She&#39;ll sleep in until anywhere between 2-3pm in the <br/>
afternoon when all her friends get home from school then she&#39;s on the <br/>
phone and playing this new game on the computer.  We are talking 11 <br/>
hours on the computer most days.  This new schedule has stopped her <br/>
going to chorus at school, she missed the last two art classes <br/>
through our homeschool co-op which she liked going to but today was <br/>
the last one and she didn&#39;t want to get up for it. I&#39;m going to work <br/>
for a couple of hours in the morning which is okay I guess although <br/>
she&#39;s a little nervous about staying home alone so if she was awake <br/>
she&#39;d be nervous. I also know this new schedule makes it impossible <br/>
for me to keep certain scheduled appointments so I&#39;m having to cancel <br/>
appointments and reschedule.   <br/>
<br/>
Her cousins are coming to stay with us for 8 weeks this summer and <br/>
I&#39;d love to be able to take everyone to the park, beach, library <br/>
etc... but I&#39;m afraid that if I don&#39;t limit her computer time, she&#39;ll <br/>
not be starting her day until 3pm in the afternoon and her two <br/>
cousins will have been waiting around all day for her - she&#39;s not <br/>
easy to wake up.<br/>
<br/>
This just seems like she&#39;s living a total seperate life than everyone <br/>
else.  She expressed an interest in a few 4H projects and earning the <br/>
Girl Scout Silver Award so we bought several books etc... for these <br/>
two things and she did a little until I backed off and now she&#39;s just <br/>
on the computer.  I haven&#39;t mentioned them but I&#39;ve got the 4H leader <br/>
and people in our girl scout troop wanting her to come work with them <br/>
on different things and now she doesn&#39;t seem interested anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m a bad parent, I am just having serious doubts that she&#39;ll <br/>
get tired of the computer and want to do anything else.  We&#39;ve had <br/>
problems for 2 years with her &quot;obsession&quot; with the computer - this <br/>
caused a lot of problems when she was in school and had homework to <br/>
do.....I&#39;m trying to look at it as the computer is her passion and <br/>
who knows where that could lead and she&#39;s been saying she wants to <br/>
create computer security systems for banks - that&#39;s great but how is <br/>
playing this game related to that?<br/>
<br/>
AHHHHHH!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;m guessing that for those two years you argued, limited, <br/>
bargained, etc &quot;can&#39;t use the computer until you get your <br/>
schoolwork/chores/whatever done...&quot; Now she&#39;s got the freedom to <br/>
indulge herself at will. Ever had anyone tell you you *can&#39;t* have <br/>
something (M&Ms, cookies, a bubble bath, whatever) until...? And you <br/>
spent all that time thinking about it most likely and counting <br/>
minutes until you could... And you counted and grabbed those M&Ms as <br/>
quickly and as many as you could manage before they were again <br/>
restricted. Same thing she&#39;s doing right now. And it&#39;s only been a <br/>
short time.<br/>
<br/>
Flip side is that there may be things that cannot be rescheduled <br/>
without cost or pain. That&#39;s when you two sit down and figure out a <br/>
compromise - you need her to be able to get up in the morning, she <br/>
wants to play this game and whatall, is she willing to be home by <br/>
herself (if she&#39;s old enough), all that stuff. Talk it out- LOTS of <br/>
talk. If there&#39;s one big common denominator I&#39;ve seen in all <br/>
unschooling households is lots of TALK, for fun, for information, <br/>
for connection, for arriving at compromise to keep the *family* <br/>
running relatively smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the &quot;other people&quot;, again, sit down and discuss with her <br/>
freely, not to &#39;get&#39; her to do these things but rather &quot;These people <br/>
are waiting on you for this. Do we need to tell them it&#39;s on hold <br/>
for now?&quot; (not worded well but you get the gist).<br/>
<br/>
Cousin-wise, get her involved in the planning for their visit - she <br/>
might use the Internet to find interesting things to do for the time <br/>
they are in town, for example. Have her type up and print out a <br/>
list. USE her computer skills to make things fun for all. It&#39;s <br/>
possible that by the time they arrive (if they&#39;re in school they <br/>
likely won&#39;t be there for at least a month from now or longer), she <br/>
might have eaten her fill on this game and be willing to ease back <br/>
some.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We first got at home internet access in October 2003, and 24 hours a<br/>
day was not enough time for my five children and me to explore.  We<br/>
fought over time and continuously had to compromise.  Someone was on<br/>
the computer at every moment with sleep schedules staggered to squeeze<br/>
out every second of computer time.  No one thought they had enough. <br/>
Were we exploring all the wonderful information available here?  Not<br/>
really, the kids mostly played Neopets, and I mostly read email lists<br/>
especially this one.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do we still do that?  No.  Eventually our interests moved on and now<br/>
my 7 and 11 yo dd&#39;s rarely use the computer.  I could just see a more<br/>
traditionally inclined parent trying to limit them back then and now<br/>
forcing them, lol!  I still use the computer about 8 hours a day, but<br/>
for a wide variety of things.  My 11 yo ds and 8 yo dd use it<br/>
regularly for email, a few games, writing, and occasionally looking<br/>
things up.  My 16 yo dd progressed from a few months of nothing but<br/>
Neopets to managing several websites, doing paid graphic design work,<br/>
writing award winning fan-fic, and keeping the entire family up on<br/>
current events.  She also currently spends around 8 hours a day on the<br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry.  If you don&#39;t restrict her, she will find the path<br/>
that is best for her.  Of course, if her activities are seriously<br/>
affecting other family members in a negative way some compromise might<br/>
be in order, not just by her but by others too.<br/>
