<div>When we talk about mathematics I think that it is important to realize that 
it is a language--arithmetic--calculation--is only a part of it. My almost 13 yo 
daughter loves geometry--she did 30 piece puzzles when she was 2--but struggles 
w/calculation.&nbsp; She just got a horse(Pete)&nbsp; and helped design the barn 
and turn-out. She figured out how much fencing we needed, the most 
cost-effective fencing for us, and the measurements of the stall. She researched 
costs(we went to several stores and looked at catalogs--she made a chart with 
all items and stores listed)&nbsp;and figured out a budget.&nbsp; This is real 
life&nbsp;mathematics. Things are making sense to her.</div>
<div>No one will write on her tombstone that she struggled with 
calculation.&nbsp; </div>
