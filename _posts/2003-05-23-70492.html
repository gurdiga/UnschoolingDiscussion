<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, I started taking antihistamines at night to help me sleep.  It works<br/>
&gt; pretty well, even relieves my pain.  I suspect if I took them all day I&#39;d feel<br/>
&gt; better, but I&#39;d be too hung over to enjoy the pain relief!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m way out of my area here, but Claritin and Allegra are antihistamines,<br/>
aren&#39;t they?  Because they don&#39;t cause the drowsy fog that the others do.<br/>
Allegra is by prescription only, but Claritin is now OTC.<br/>
