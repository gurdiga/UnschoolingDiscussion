I agree, Betsy. The list is not limited to those who have &quot;school-age&quot;<br/>
children. As I see it, it is about discussing ideas that pertain to how to<br/>
raise children without doing what schools do to them. People don&#39;t need to<br/>
have children at all in order to do that. Why? Because we have all been<br/>
children and our memories are vivid.<br/>
<br/>
Our own youngest child is now 23. I feel qualified to contribute here, not<br/>
about what we did on a day to day basis so much, but on the concept of<br/>
unschooling, the reasoning of it, the results of that reasoning, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This discussion does not even limit itself to people who have children at<br/>
all, as it is named. It&#39;s about an idea and how that idea is manifested.<br/>
<br/>
There is plenty of discussion available and needed about how to treat a<br/>
child, right from birth, if we are planning to unschool him/her. One big<br/>
idea is how to think outside of the need to prepare that kid for school. If<br/>
we don&#39;t need to do that, then an entirely different attitude applies. It is<br/>
this: Wow, I need to prepare this child for LIFE. The job suddenly takes on<br/>
a more focus. No longer do we think about having the box of crayons and the<br/>
lunchbox and the right sneakers. We must actually get serious about<br/>
parenting. <br/>
<br/>
The school system would like to be our child&#39;s surrogate parent.<br/>
Homeschoolers see the dangers in giving them that responsibility. The more<br/>
we learn about those schools, the more we realize those dangers, and the<br/>
more we understand the meaning of the &quot;un&quot;  in our word.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I was raised with the expectation that I would go to school.<br/>
Therefore, my parents were only part-time involved in my early education,<br/>
believing that the school would know what to do with me when the time came.<br/>
They relinquished many parental duties to the school employees whom they<br/>
didn&#39;t even know. As a result, I often got completely different views on<br/>
things at school than I got from my parents. The separation began early and<br/>
grew right along with me.<br/>
<br/>
When parents plan to unschool, or homeschool, the fact that they accept all<br/>
responsibility makes a big difference, and makes raising a child a far more<br/>
urgent business for them, and puts their lives into sharp focus as their<br/>
child grows. <br/>
<br/>
The great benefit for Luz and me in our son&#39;s unschooling (we never even<br/>
gave it a name - he was simply living with us) was not so much his obvious<br/>
gains in knowledge and skills, but the very fact that he was living his life<br/>
under the almost constant care of one or the other of us, and thus he was<br/>
not subjected to anyone who would miseducate him or treat him<br/>
inappropriately or even waste his time, all of which my previous children<br/>
experienced in schools, as most of us did.<br/>
<br/>
And the joy was that we got to know him at each stage much better than we<br/>
would have if he had gone away every day to school buildings. The other part<br/>
of that is that he got to know us intimately, too.<br/>
<br/>
My school experience had the effect of alienating me from my parents. They<br/>
seemed to see themselves merely as the launchpad for me to be influenced<br/>
deeply by others. We ended up mostly estranged. But, in comparison to that,<br/>
Luz and I are incredibly close to our son -- he still wants us to be the<br/>
first to know his secrets. To me, that&#39;s a triumph and a treasure.<br/>
<br/>
What more can we ask. And we give the credit to unschooling.<br/>
