<div id="ygrps-yiv-813923844">I hope no one reading in this group has set their internet or e-mail to receive NOTHING except Always Learning.  Please don&#39;t.  Your relatives might be trying to contact you.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone was court-ordered to join this list, please send me a copy of the judge&#39;s writ, because I will write and ask them NOT to do that anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Today someone wasted Joyce&#39;s time (I shouldn&#39;t say that, because Joyce might be having fun) arguing with her about a returned post.  Joyce is VERY KIND to help moderate this discussion.  She doesn&#39;t have to.  She doesn&#39;t have to help unschoolers at all, but she does, because she is interested in the topic and in how people learn about it and  understand it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I seek to find like-minded folks and am unable to receive that from the Always Learning group while it is so heavily moderated and controlled,&quot; the person wrote to Joyce.<br/>
<br/>
Please.  If the only place in the world someone is looking for like-minded people is here, branch out!<br/>
<br/>
-=-obviously I have no idea how many other comments/responses are moderated and withheld from the group.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Very few posts are returned.  If we returned lots more, that would be okay, but we don&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
This side accusation that we are keeping someone from making an informed decision about boogers has to do with the idea of food allergies.   <br/>
<br/>
If there is anyone here who is not aware that there are food allergies in the world and that anyone might have one, please google &quot;food allergy&quot; and &quot;gluten sensitivity&quot; and &quot;lactose intolerance.&quot;  There is much more about that in the world than there is about unschooling.  Let that live where it lives, and let&#39;s just discuss unschooling here.<br/>
<br/>
If there is anyone here who feels that she/he cannot make an informed decision without us bringing information about every other method of homeschooling or private schooling or public schooling, I think that&#39;s unreasonable to expect.     <br/>
<br/>
If someone asks for a movie recommendation, we aren&#39;t obligated to name every movie that would be BAD for unschoolers, nor ever movie that is great.  Naming some movies is plenty.  IMDB names most of the others.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t expect this discussion to be more than it is, or other than it has been described AT LENGTH, for years, to be.  <br/>
<br/>
And please stop harrassing moderators.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone feels like reading the lengthy advice about allergies that Joyce declined to approve, and the complaints about this discussion that followed from that, here:  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/informedDecision">http://sandradodd.com/informedDecision</a><br/>
<br/>
I formatted it with working links so that anyone who really does wish the list had long allergy recommendations regarding any question—not just of boogers, but of sleep, attention span and courtesy—can read that page over when the thought arises that maybe all this unschooling discussion is a waste of time, and we should all just control our children&#39;s diets instead.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m kind of cranky that someone will go to so much work to disrupt, and will participate in a discussion so important to others without even bothering to know whose discussion it is.<br/>
<br/>
The person wrote to Joyce:  &quot;That you chose to allow Sandra&#39;s messages against food allergy/medical issues but not other messages regarding the same, is straight up bias on your part & totally allowed as you are the moderator & can do what you chose.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Joyce is one of several moderators.  I&#39;m a moderator, too.    Joyce didn&#39;t &quot;choose to allow&quot; my messages.  I&#39;m the list owner.  My posts have never been moderated.  Most members&#39; posts aren&#39;t moderated.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt there has ever been a single person who made any important life decision based solely on what she read on Always Learning.  Nor based on one single book, or article, or one single person&#39;s advice.   It wouldn&#39;t make sense. <br/>
<br/>
Please make informed decisions.  Just don&#39;t expect all the information in the world to come from a single source.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815562351">Sandra, I felt so angered when I first posted almost two years ago. I had read so much, including the intro read before you post material. I wanted to leave in a huff, but thankfully maturity and calm prevailed and i decided to wait and see if anything you or Joyce had written made any sense or helped me along on my journey. I also could not find anything, anywhere at all, on the internet that even came close to the quality or scope of your websites and dicussions. My family and I are so glad we stuck around, lurking, trying stuff out, tweaking things along the way. I am so grateful for the clarity and experience, the critical and logical methods used to pick apart issues, that the complaints seem relatively silly. People obviously don&#39;t want to slow down and take the time to do the hard work to read a little, try a little wait a while and watch. I honestly hope this rash of frustration does not deter you (plural, you and the wonderful moderators) from continuing, as undoubtedly, there are many other lurkers like myself benefitting daily from the discussion. I am aware this may read as support or a pat on the back; it is intended as gratitude. Gratitude for your kindness, generosity and patience in helping others get it.

I have had my words torn up on here and just yesterday pointed out that I was over writing and off topic and I am&nbsp;extremely grateful, but more than that it was helpful and informative, and both were areas that I&nbsp;needed to break through and focus on, and change my thinking on, and take real action to&nbsp;change to be a better&nbsp;unschooler - one was&nbsp;about the use of labels which I am totally clear on now thanks to it being&nbsp;pointed out loud and clear that I was using a label! Through this tear up, and reading else where, I have changed my thinking for the better on this for good, and I am&nbsp;grateful for the &nbsp;help and information from this thread that helped with that.</span></font></div><div><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="line-height:14.999999046325684px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="line-height:14.999999046325684px;">My over writing yesterday comes from a life long&nbsp;tendency to over talk/over write and especially when overexcited or overanxious (and usually muddled and very unclear) and I already knew from reading on here and&nbsp;sandras links on this that it is hampering my unschooling, and I had already&nbsp;started&nbsp;to focus on really shifting it for the better -&nbsp;through my buddhist practise, and reading on it from an unschooling perspective, and yesterday was a big kick up the butt to get on with it and REALLY focus on it deeply, so i am grateful again.&nbsp;</span></font></div><div><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="line-height:14.999999046325684px;"><br></span></font></div><div><span style="line-height:15.833333015441895px;color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13.333333015441895px;"><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif" style="line-height:1.22em;"><span style="line-height:1.22em;font-size:13px;">&lt;&lt;</span></font></span><span style="line-height:15.833333015441895px;font-size:13px;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;">I hope no one reading in this group has set their internet or e-mail to receive NOTHING except Always Learning&gt;&gt; &nbsp;</span></div><div><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><font size="2"><span style="line-height:15.833333015441895px;"><br></span></font></font></div><div><font color="#333333" face="arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif"><font size="2"><span style="line-height:15.833333015441895px;">This made me smile also, I do&nbsp;look forward&nbsp;every morning to reading this list, and I too am so grateful that it is so well tended.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334829758">I have only been on this list for two three months or so. Initially I had a post rejected. Actually I had a couple of posts rejected. At first I was taken aback. I decided to read and not post for a while. I read responses to other posts and over a short time saw that the responses to my posts were not personal and started to understand how this list works and appreciate it for just that. How it works and why it works. I also feel that its a list that doesn&#39;t well tolerate naysayers but rather people with a serious intention to understand unschooling in its deepest sense and how it can work in their lives and then to be willing to look at the mirror and sometimes the painful realities presented and to work on getting better and being better. I like that its supportive nature is not a &quot;group hug&quot; sort of support as one finds on many other online forums.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902273543">There seems to be some confusion about what effect Sandra expected her &quot;The great gluten panic&quot; post to have on the list.<br/>
<br/>
It seems some on this list believe there are members here who will unquestioningly believe anything Sandra posts. Because they don&#39;t get the opportunity to hijack the list into a discussion of how scary non-organic foods are or whatever it seems they believe that Sandra also believes she has such powers and is trying to control what people are allowed to read.<br/>
<br/>
What an incredibly unflattering view of the members&#39; intelligence here! <br/>
<br/>
And as Sandra posted she doesn&#39;t believe she has the power to turn off access to the rest of the internet for everyone! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Not only that but the idea that long time posters *want* to write to people willing to read unquestioningly means that person has a warped view of the purpose of this list.<br/>
<br/>
What Sandra posted was meant to *add* to the overwhelming number of messages currently in society about what we need to fear.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t read anything here in order to think like Sandra does. Read to understand how to dig into ideas to question what you read. <br/>
<br/>
One line from the posts I deleted stated the poster disagreed with the bit about gluten free being a “fad”.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that having a child with celiac&#39;s disease and now seeing all the wonderful products more readily available can feel like finally being recognized and taken seriously. Unfortunately it just isn&#39;t true. The massive influx of gluten free products into even regular grocery stores isn&#39;t driven by the relatively small celiac population. It&#39;s being driven by a big wave of belief in the general population that avoiding gluten and/or wheat will fix what&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot; with them. Some of the people joyfully touting how much better they feel after eliminating gluten or wheat probably *do* have some intolerance. It&#39;s great they found a cause. Some of the people are experiencing a placebo effect. Many more are giving it a try to see if they experience the supposedly wonderful benefits. In a few short years most everyone will have moved onto the next big &quot;fix&quot;. And unfortunately the gluten free products probably won&#39;t be as widely available for the people who do need them.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what Sandra originally prefaced her post with. It says &quot;think&quot;, not &quot;think like me.&quot;<br/>
======<br/>
It&#39;s about diet (and belief and fear and control and magical thinking).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone kindly sent me links to these articles by Stan Cox, with information on scientific studies on wheat&#39;s effects and on the origins of the spreading belief that wheat is of the devil and that children will be virtuous and brighter and live longer if they have panicky parents controlling them (that part is my own wording). It&#39;s a fad, and one of several that have come along since I&#39;ve been helping unschoolers. People can be mad at me about saying so if they want to, but it might be worth reading these articles and following some of the trails he points to. Be mad at him, too, if you want to ignore those scientific studies.<br/>

font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">But most things in think as facts today will change. Gluten may become a life saving and not this evil food it is today.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Butter used to be bad, margarine was good. Now it is the other way around! Eggs were bad for you! Now they are a perfect food!</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Now how does this relate to unschooling?<br>&nbsp;Schools say children need to be taught to read. We know that is not a fact!<br>Kids need to be punished or consequences
 created so they can learn to be good human beings.<br>Well we know they can grow to be wonderful people without punishments and parent created consequences.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">If a child does not read by a certain age they are learning disable and will have a very hard time reading.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Unschoolers have seen kids learn to read at all ages and they all read fine with no difference to kids that learned at the &quot;correct&quot; age.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">If a child cannot pay attention to the classes and concentrate in their lessons and is wiggly they have
 ADD or ADHD. Kids are labelled everyday.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Those kids are brought home to unschool and they can concentrated and do well in what they are interested! Be play ball or video games , build Legos, watch Barbie movies!</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;
background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">So here is the link to the book:<br>http://www.arbesman.net/the-half-life-of-facts/</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></div><div>&quot;&quot;Facts change all the time. Smoking has gone from doctor-recommended 
to deadly. We used to think the Earth was the center of the universe and
 that Pluto was a planet. For decades, we were convinced that the 
Brontosaurus was a real dinosaur. In short, what we know about the world
 is constantly changing.</div>
<div>But it turns out there’s an order to the state of knowledge, an 
explanation for how we know what we know. Samuel Arbesman is an expert 
in the field of scientometrics—literally the science of science. 
Knowledge in most fields evolves systematically and predictably, and 
this evolution unfolds in a fascinating way that can have a powerful 
impact on our lives.</div>
<div><em>The Half-Life of Facts</em> is a riveting journey into the 
counterintuitive fabric of knowledge. It can help us find new ways to 
measure the world while accepting the limits of how much we can know 
with certainty.&quot;&quot;</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:italic;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:italic;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:italic;">Has anyone read this book?<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font face="courier">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-712350498y_msg_container"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"> </div> </div>  </div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103153373">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;">It&#39;s being driven by a big wave of belief in the general population that avoiding gluten and/or wheat will fix what&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot; with them. Some of the people joyfully touting how much better they feel after eliminating gluten or wheat probably *do* have some intolerance. It&#39;s great they found a cause. Some of the people are experiencing a placebo effect.&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</span><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;">I stopped eating wheat a year and a half ago. &nbsp;At first, I felt a lot of benefits, primarily with my digestion. &nbsp;One benefit was feeling like I had more energy. Over time, those benefits faded away and my digestive troubles started again, though to a lesser degree.</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;">A few months ago I began experimenting with including wheat in my diet, in small amounts. &nbsp;I&#39;ve found that my digestive troubles correlate a lot more with stress in my life than they do with whether I eat wheat or not. &nbsp;I also still feel like I have AMPLE energy, though I&#39;m eating wheat. &nbsp;But I also am a lot less worn down by stress and negativity in my life.</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;">I think my initial &quot;success&quot; was the feeling that I had found something to help me, and it gave me positive, empowering feelings. &nbsp;It gave me a sense of control that made me feel better, and so my digestion improved. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;">It&#39;s still possible that I have some digestive issues with wheat, I haven&#39;t dismissed that completely.</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;">I will say, however, that trying to avoid wheat became a source of stress for me. &nbsp;It caused more stress and anxiety than actually eating wheat has caused me any kind of discomfort. &nbsp;I am enjoying SO much the freedom to relax and enjoy a donut, or a plate of spagetti, or an oreo (or three). &nbsp;Focusing on gratitude for the availability of so many choices, rather than my fear, helped a lot. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;">I think, if eating wheat causes someone physical discomfort, and eliminating it (for themselves, not everyone else around them) makes them feel better, and happier, and more joyful, then fine. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;">I think that is possible, though the people I know who don&#39;t let their kids eat gluten (or refined sugar, or non grass-fed meat, or non-organic produce, or whatever it is that they&#39;ve decided is awful for them), or who totally avoid it themselves, have a lot of anxiety in general around what they or their children are eating. &nbsp;That&#39;s not good for unschooling (or your health, really). &nbsp;I mean, I love grass-fed meat. &nbsp;It tastes better. &nbsp;I can&#39;t always afford it. &nbsp;I love organic produce from my local farmer&#39;s market. &nbsp;It tastes better, and I love the social aspect of getting to know the farmers. &nbsp;I can&#39;t always afford it. &nbsp;Appreciating what I have when I have it, and appreciating alternatives has made me MUCH happier than focusing on ONLY eating the things that I thought were best, and the stress of trying to shop for them on a small budget.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);line-height:16px;">Here is a great article on organic produce: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/the_kids/2014/01/organic_vs_conventional_produce_for_kids_you_don_t_need_to_fear_pesticides.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/the_kids/2014/01/organic_vs_conventional_produce_for_kids_you_don_t_need_to_fear_pesticides.html</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f"><span style="line-height:16px;">And I sort of feel like, it&#39;s worse for a child&#39;s well-being to say &quot;I think this is bad for you, but I&#39;m going to let you eat it anyway&quot; (even if not said directly), than it is just to say,&nbsp;</span></font><span style="line-height:16px;color:rgb(63, 63, 63);">&quot;this is bad for you, you can&#39;t eat it.&quot; I don&#39;t think unschoolers should be saying either of those things about food, though.</span></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f"><span style="line-height:16px;"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#3f3f3f"><span style="line-height:16px;">Lisa C</span></font></div><div><br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994083293">
<html><head></head> The 3 days with bad humour and agressivity, may be related to constipation. <br>
There is a certain food that causes me a variety of things namely, inflamation in tje skin, mouth, articular pain and very bad humour and agresivity. It also causes gut pain and constipation during 3 days. After the constipation is solved, good humour comes back. Now, if i eat that thing (sometimes i choose to eat it) i do it with many other that garantee that my gut will function in the same day or the day after. I falso use herbs por homeopathy to help. That helps a lot minimizing the &quot;agressive mode&quot; i was going on and it desapears in hours por does no even start. I i just eat the &quot;thing&quot; alone, i know i will have 72 hours in a very difficult States. After we discoverd, if i was in a terryble modo (falso because i was no able to reconize it was tried to make everyone miserable, no because of the food itself) my husband would make revise all my meals and snacks and check the labels on the kitchen to now if i acidently had some os &quot;that&quot; mover time we
discovered the 72 hora needed to cleanse without help, what would make me cleanse faater and i understood that life is no hell, and no one is against me, i just hav�� to be quiet and wait until the depression and agressivity desapears and life is brigth again.<br>
Dont know if this is helpfull por even on topic. Sorry if not.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-81763346">I&#39;ve discussed Catia&#39;s situation (and I meant to send that post back for being non-specific and hard to read).  It wasn&#39;t gluten, but she prefers not to discuss the particulars.<br/>

For three weeks. He becomes almost intolerable to live with.<br/>
After one single gluten crumb. -=-<br/>
<br/>
With that verb tense (becomes, hurts, &#39;gets beaten...&#39;) it suggests that it has happened repeatedly.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone whose child has been beaten many times a day is not present enough. That child is not being taken care of.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who believes that one single gluten crumb causes three weeks of symptoms and tries to protect a sibling by hiding gluten from the other child would do much better to really look into the suggestions made by unschoolers for many years about how to help children learn to get along, and to discover how foods affect them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe gluetn will last three weeks in a person, and I don&#39;t believe that it (nor any other food or drug) will make a person violent for three weeks.  Alcohol won&#39;t, no matter how much a violent drunk the person might be in the short term.<br/>
<br/>
What will make a child angry is being controlled and told no.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone who would see a child being told there&#39;s something wrong with him and NO he can&#39;t and NO he shouldn&#39;t, and not expect him to respond or react.<br/>
<br/>
Three weeks?  <br/>
<br/>
Attempting to control a child&#39;s courtesy and morality by changing his diet is irresponsible.  It&#39;s magic thinking.<br/>
And IF a person has a condition that causes them difficulty being courteous, the parent should work on courtesy.  Work on ways for the child to calm himself or to isolate himself when he&#39;s a danger to others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445">My oldest has celiac disease, and one of his symptoms is outbursts of anger and violence when he is exposed to gluten, including cross contamination (fries cooked in the same fryer as something with wheat, bread cut from the same knife as one that cut a piece of wheat bread, etc.). His doctor (who specializes in celiac disease and other gut problems) has told us that his reaction is one of the more strong visible ones she&#39;s ever seen (anyone with celiac disease has significant damage to the vili in their intestines after exposure, not everyone has obvious outward signs). Still, he has never had an emotional reaction last more than 3 days, and a skin rash that lasts more than a week. </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445">3 weeks seems like there is a lot more going on; I would look at how you responded when he had the exposure. Did you freak out, or become fearful? </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445">I can think back to many times that my fear around food had a huge impact on my son&#39;s emotional state.

I wanted to write to share how this ongoing conversation has enabled me to relax and support my son in making choices while still doing what I feel is necessary to protect him and us. </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445">We were at a small festival at a community garden on Saturday, and one of the things they had a lot of was home baked bread. I brought lots of snacks and yummy treats that are healthy for my son, anticipating that not all of the food would be 100% gluten free. He found out that they had some gluten free bread options, and asked me if he could try it. 

I couldn&#39;t see the kitchen it was being prepared in, and they were busy. I guessed that cross contamination could be an issue. I took stock of our situation and noted that two of my friends (who don&#39;t have kids, and have known mine since birth) were there and if my son needed more support from one of us it would be available (usually I am the only adult out with my three kids, including an adventurous toddler), so I felt like it would be a good chance for him to try it if he really wanted to. 

I explained to him that I was not certain that there was no gluten on the bread they were offering, but that I would let him decide if it felt worth the possibility of a reaction. He decided it was.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445"> In the end, he did have a reaction, about 20 minutes after eating it, and ended up screaming and hitting me and my best friend (who is like his aunt, and his favorite person in the world) before I could help him. Once he was able to tell that he was safe and supported  he sat in my lap and did some deep breathing with me. The day was rough, but we were able to talk about how he felt in his body and his heart, and if it did feel like a fair trade off for the bread (which he really didn&#39;t like at all in the end).</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445"> We both learned a lot more that we would have if I had just said &quot;no&quot;. 

(And his reaction passed in less than 24 hours, for those keeping track :)

I appreciate gaining a deeper and deeper understanding of unschooling perspective and using it as one of the lenses I try to see my choices through. While the way I approach food with my kids would certainly not be considered radical unschooling, I am so grateful to be finding more ways to say yes and bringing more joy and ease into our lives. </div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1800899578ygrps-yiv-1060415445"> Jamie</div></div>

I don&#39;t believe gluetn will last three weeks in a person, and I don&#39;t believe that it (nor any other food or drug) will make a person violent for three weeks.  Alcohol won&#39;t, no matter how much a violent drunk the person might be in the short term.<br>
<br>
What will make a child angry is being controlled and told no.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone who would see a child being told there&#39;s something wrong with him and NO he can&#39;t and NO he shouldn&#39;t, and not expect him to respond or react.<br>
<br>
Three weeks?  <br>
<br>
Attempting to control a child&#39;s courtesy and morality by changing his diet is irresponsible.  It&#39;s magic thinking.<br>
And IF a person has a condition that causes them difficulty being courteous, the parent should work on courtesy.  Work on ways for the child to calm himself or to isolate himself when he&#39;s a danger to others.<br>
