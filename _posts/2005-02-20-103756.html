<div id="ygrps-yiv-458348539">Are you saying the television is a back up for parents who won&#39;t or<br/>
can&#39;t get the real thing for their children?<br/>
<br/>
************************<br/>
In a sense.<br/>
I can&#39;t take my children to China at the moment, but I can watch a show about <br/>
building the great wall, go to China Garden and eat Lo Mein, cut out paper <br/>
dolls and put traditional dresses on them, watch Sagwa on BBS, go to the mall <br/>
and hear Chinese music during the New Year celebration, talk with Jennifer who <br/>
spent a year living in China while in college and have her teach us some words <br/>
(She&#39;s a translator).<br/>
TV is one really cool way to see China without going there.<br/>
Without TV, I could taste China, hear China, but not SEE China.<br/>
<br/>
TV is not the most important thing to me or my kids, it&#39;s another way to <br/>
experience the world, it&#39;s an addition to the world. We all use it to add to our <br/>
life experience, just as we do with books, magazines, message boards, google, <br/>
and face to face conversations.<br/>
I would do damage to my kids learning environment by taking away TV, just as <br/>
much as if I took away magazines or personal interactions with others.<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
