Is Sharon of the Swamp still on this list?  She lives right there as well<br/>
and is about as cool an unschooler as you would want to meet.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
She IS. The boys and I went and spent a weekend with her two years ago. <br/>
<br/>
She sent Roy to school recently and is not on any unschooling lists anymore. <br/>
Her reason for school was her isolation---Roy needed someone other than his <br/>
mom everyday. <br/>
<br/>
Broke my heart. She&#39;s just outside of Jacksonville. I have her address if <br/>
anyones interested.<br/>
