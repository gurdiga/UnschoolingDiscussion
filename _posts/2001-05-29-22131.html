<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851091344">Those of  you who have been at this for a while, might not be<br/>
surprised at this, but I am excited.<br/>
About 5pm, my husband decided to install &#39;Where in Time is Carmen<br/>
SanDiego&#39; on the computer he and our share to play games. ( Their<br/>
original game data was lost in a computer crash a few months ago.)  Part<br/>
of the way into it, our son came in to see what was going on. They<br/>
started playing it a few minutes afterwards. It is now 10pm and they are<br/>
still playing it. They  have stopped only for a few minutes to eat when<br/>
they got hungry.<br/>
    I am sitting here on the other computer listening and watching in<br/>
delight as they play and my son learns. My husband is gently guiding him<br/>
when needed. They take turns at the computer and are enjoying<br/>
themselves.<br/>
    Will unschooling ever cease to amaze me?? I hope not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617520917">-I am brand new to this group and new to homeschooling as well - took <br/>
our 4 kids (5th, 4th, 2nd, 1st grades) out of school in November, but <br/>
every time I get concerned that my unschooling approach is just TOO <br/>
unstructured (there are very few unschoolers for support here in <br/>
Northern Virginia), my kids remind me that we&#39;re doing just fine.  My <br/>
youngest daughter - 1st grade - has had almost no formal instruction <br/>
since leaving school in November.  At Price Club last week she begged <br/>
for a workbook so I bought her the only one they had in stock - 2nd <br/>
grade.  Last night she brought me the book and asked me to check her <br/>
work.  Turns out she had completed 10 or 12 pages of math and had <br/>
gotten every problem right!!  Humm. . . Begged for work, did it <br/>
independently and got over 100 problems correct with no errors . . . <br/>
Me thinks the teacher who disapproved of my removing her from school <br/>
would be green with envy!!<br/>

Have you found the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:VaEclecticHomeschool@yahoogroups.com">VaEclecticHomeschool@yahoogroups.com</a> list? I&#39;m near <br/>
Richmond, but it always looks (to me) like there are quite a few unschoolers <br/>
in Northern VA. They are always planning neat trips and get togethers that I <br/>
wish weren&#39;t QUITE so far from us. I guess the grass is always greener ... :)<br/>
