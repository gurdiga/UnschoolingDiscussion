<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; My daughter wears two different colored socks.  She started it when she was<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3  since she wanted more color in her outfits.  Now it is part of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; fashion.  A couple of other girls she plays with have started it too.  One<br/>
&gt; &gt; is older and she made the comment that she didn&#39;t have to sort her socks <br/>
&gt; &gt; now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t have to sort Megan&#39;s socks - they just go in a bin in her drawer <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; she picks out what she wants to wear that day.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for releasing another law from my head! Just socks, but I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; reading <br/>
&gt; this thinking, &#39;can she do that?!? mismatched socks?!? well, I guess she <br/>
&gt; could, wow!&#39; Amazing how many guidelines I follow without even thinking <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My sister-in-law makes sure that not only are her children&#39;s socks clean and <br/>
matching (something we rarely accomplish around here), but.....they also <br/>
match the kids&#39; CLOTHES......<br/>
<br/>
Yeah right.<br/>

while he was griping to himself that there are never any clean socks. I just took <br/>
over the guilt.<br/>
I&#39;m going to check the cat box.<br/>
