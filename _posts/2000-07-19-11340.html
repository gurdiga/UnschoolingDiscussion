<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919743423">We have been considering getting a goat for our daughter Lili because she <br/>
saw a lilygoat at a friends house and just fell in love with it.   We live <br/>
in Portugal and they are really cheap here and I would love her to be able <br/>
to bottle feed it from a baby.   Does anyone know how much they are in <br/>
general for vet bills?  I do not want to take on a HUGE expense with this <br/>
goat.  Small expense ok....we just can&#39;t afford a lot of big vet bills for <br/>
what will be a pet for the most part.   I really want to do this for her <br/>
though because I think it would be a great learning experience for both my <br/>
girls.   Does anyone have any other experience with goats they would like to <br/>
share with someone who has never had one????  &lt;big cheesy PLEASE grin&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; A cow is a large expense and often comes with large<br/>
&gt; &gt; vet bills.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe get a newborn heifer and bottle feed her so<br/>
&gt; &gt; that she is<br/>
&gt; &gt; tame, then she will be easy to handle when you<br/>
&gt; &gt; eventually milk<br/>
&gt; &gt; her.  If she had a male calf, that can be raised for<br/>
&gt; &gt; beef.   A problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; these days is finding a cow with teats long enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get a hold of,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they have been bred for shorter teats for milking<br/>
&gt; &gt; machines.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A goat may be a better option for a dairy animal,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t hurt<br/>
&gt; &gt; you as much if they inadvertently stand on your<br/>
&gt; &gt; toes, and are so<br/>
&gt; &gt; easy for children to handle, even my four year old<br/>
&gt; &gt; can milk our goat.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know where she got her beef cow but she paid<br/>
&gt;$30 for it. She got it as a new born, I think it was<br/>
&gt;no more than a week old. I plan to do something<br/>
&gt;simmilar for my beef cow. Later I plan to have the<br/>
&gt;milk cow. I have never had goats milk and have heard<br/>
&gt;opposing views on the flavor. I have considered a goat<br/>
&gt;instead but don&#39;t know much about them. Are there<br/>
&gt;stores that sell goats milk so I could try it before I<br/>
&gt;make a decission on an animal?   Corallyn<br/>
