<br/>
&lt;&lt;Not sure I made any sense.<br/>
But just a couple of thoughts&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Made perfect sense to me and it also sounds like our house. Works well<br/>
that&#39;s for sure. I never take on a pet on the assumption that a child would<br/>
take full responsibility. I think that&#39;s just unrealistic. In fact we are<br/>
taking on another kitten shortly and I am also helping Tara with her litter<br/>
box duties she takes care of. Yes two of the cats she wanted and cleaning<br/>
the box means cleaning it whether we have 2 or 4, but it&#39;s a matter of<br/>
helping others out. It&#39;s a matter of me helping without anyone asking, me<br/>
helping when others do ask and the kids all seeing that and growing up doing<br/>
the same. Not thinking one can just delegate responsibilites to others<br/>
because they are the parent. Sometimes what kids think they can handle they<br/>
find out is different than their expectations. It&#39;s okay here to say so and<br/>
they get help because of that. I also don&#39;t make them do things because I&#39;m<br/>
the parent and bigger and can. I&#39;m ranting, I&#39;ll stop now.9<br/>

<br/>
&quot;If you help me with the dishes then we&#39;ll have time for a game before bed.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a choice. Maybe being late is okay with the kids! I thought it was a no<br/>
brainer that it&#39;s good to be early and bad to be late but my daughter said<br/>
she&#39;d rather be late to a class than arrive early and have to wait around.<br/>

<br/>
I agree.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They always have the option of saying no to anything I ask them to do, <br/>
but they also realize that the more housework I do without help, the less <br/>
time <br/>
we have as a family to do anything.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the tone, it might not be awful.  Some families might make it <br/>
work fine, and when there&#39;s a single parent who&#39;s working, there could easily be <br/>
times when everone really needs to pitch in to get caught up  with laundry or <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
But lying just like it is above, some of us (me) will probably read into it a <br/>
known tone of a parent who set such traps to make it seem like OUR fault when <br/>
the parent chooses some arbitrary outcome.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve also seen and been involved in situations where it wasn&#39;t a trap, it <br/>
was an honest &quot;Let&#39;s get the trash all collected and put out and then go for <br/>
ice cream,&quot; or something safe and good.<br/>

for ...  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Each time I read it its like its some kind of head game&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am not the original poster but speaking as someone with 5 kids, I can<br/>
guarantee this is reality here, not some kind of head game.<br/>
<br/>
If I am left to do all the work, I get up before 6 am to start working and<br/>
still working after 9 pm.  Between I am pretty much continually cleaning,<br/>
wiping, sweeping, picking up.  Not to mention the needed hugs, talks,<br/>
referee-ing, etc..  Somebody is hungry, somebody has to go to the dentist,<br/>
somebody has gymnastics, somebody has 4-H.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody posted about &quot;people are more important than a sparkling house&quot;.<br/>
We NEVER reach sparkling.  Without help, unless I am working non-stop, we<br/>
are walking around trash, literally.  There was no time for reading stories,<br/>
playing games, museums, zoos, park days, nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, some people have kids who are more organized, like stuff put<br/>
away.......then there are my kids who are pack rats, like their stuff out<br/>
all over the house &quot;where they can see it good&quot; &lt;grin&gt;, and are quite at<br/>
home just walking on top of whatever they have left in the floor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934394318">I think it&#39;s hard sometimes though to know exactly what I *have* to <br/>
do.  I could let the dishes sit and play the game instead, so in <br/>
reality to say that I can&#39;t play the game until the dishes are <br/>
finished is saying that the dishes are more important than the game.  <br/>
What I have a hard time with is knowing when I do need to put my foot <br/>
down and say, &quot;Sorry, I *have* to do the dishes.  Help me and we&#39;ll <br/>
get done quicker and have time to play&quot;.  How much can they pile up <br/>
before you should say that?  At what point do they *have* to get <br/>
done?  Just before it becomes a health and hygiene issue or not until <br/>
someone is starving and doesn&#39;t have a clean plate to eat off of?  <br/>
<br/>
I guess the standard varies from household to household as far as <br/>
what housework has to get done when, but if the standard varies, then <br/>
the reality is that a lot of times when we say that we *have* to do <br/>
something, we&#39;re saying that I, the mom, am uncomfortable with the <br/>
mess being at this level and I don&#39;t want to play a game with you <br/>
when there are all these dishes to be done.  <br/>
<br/>
 Awhile ago when I described the big mess in our playroom, I didn&#39;t <br/>
get answers like, &quot;Hey, just live with that level of mess.  No one <br/>
wants to clean it up, fine, it doesn&#39;t have to be done&quot;.  Most people <br/>
said stuff like, &quot;I couldn&#39;t think in a room as messy as you <br/>
described&quot; or gave me ideas of how to ask the kids for help so that <br/>
I&#39;d get a better response.  (And I appreciated those responses, I&#39;m <br/>
not saying this to argue with those responses by any means, but to <br/>
bring up a different point).  In reality, I didn&#39;t *have* to clean up <br/>
that room for quite awhile.  There was popcorn on the floor, but it <br/>
probably could have sat there for awhile before it attracted any bugs <br/>
or rodents.  There were toys and stuff all over the floor but we <br/>
probably could have stepped over it for quite awhile before the level <br/>
of junk in the room got so bad that it became a real safety or fire <br/>
hazard.  <br/>
<br/>
So really, in my case, I didn&#39;t clean up because I absolutely *had* <br/>
to, but because I WANTED to.  The mess got to the point where at that <br/>
moment in time I wanted it cleaned more than I wanted to play with <br/>
the kids or even more than I wanted to sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
We as unschoolers know that everyone&#39;s brains work differently, and <br/>
when we talk about housework that *has* to be done, I suspect our <br/>
minds all have different pictures.  I think of work that *has to* be <br/>
done as someone is dying of thirst but doesn&#39;t have anything to drink <br/>
out of or someone wants to go outside but doesn&#39;t have any clean <br/>
pants to wear. I wouldn&#39;t say that I *have to* go shopping when there <br/>
isn&#39;t even any dry cereal or crackers left in the house, but I would <br/>
never *want* to let myself get to the point where that&#39;s all we have <br/>
left.  So in reality, when I say I *have* to go shopping, the truth <br/>
is that I wouldn&#39;t *have* to, I *want* to.   <br/>
<br/>
I think as moms what we tend to do is criticize other mom&#39;s levels of <br/>
comfort.  &quot;Her house is always so messy.  She *should* clean more.  <br/>
Or, she&#39;s always cleaning, she *should* play with her kids more and <br/>
not worry so much about the mess.  But except in rare circumstances <br/>
where there&#39;s total filth and unhealthy conditions, everyone is <br/>
choosing what they *want* to do.    Maybe we should all just follow <br/>
our hearts and do what seems right to us?  Maybe it&#39;s ok to let the <br/>
dishes go one day because our heart of hearts on that day is desiring <br/>
nothing more but to play with the kids, but on other days, our heart <br/>
of hearts is really yearning for a spotless kitchen?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933315736">From: &quot;J. Stauffer&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jnjstau@...">jnjstau@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;If I am left to do all the work, I get up before 6 am to start working<br/>
and<br/>
still working after 9 pm.  Between I am pretty much continually cleaning,<br/>
wiping, sweeping, picking up.  Not to mention the needed hugs, talks,<br/>
referee-ing, etc..  Somebody is hungry, somebody has to go to the dentist,<br/>
somebody has gymnastics, somebody has 4-H.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do understand what you mean. I have also found that a little at a time,<br/>
and doing things coming and going helps a lot. I have 4 kids, 2 dogs, 3<br/>
cats, a snake, crabs and 4 fish tanks I am responsible for. The kids have<br/>
scheduled outtings 3 days of every week. We absolutely have to be up by 9:30<br/>
in order to be down the street by noon.  Our house is large enough to keep<br/>
me busy. My kids save everything they have. My husband does too. I have an<br/>
awful lot here to keep my busy all hours of the day. I&#39;m also pretty anal<br/>
about the house and the kids as far as  how they look. That&#39;s my thing and<br/>
my family is pretty easy going with appeasing me. &lt;BG&gt; Point is, I have<br/>
plenty of time to keep the house neat and play with the kids, cook, get them<br/>
to where they need to go, shop, have computer time and pretty much free time<br/>
to take care of other things. It is possible. If I&#39;m on the way to the<br/>
bathroom, I&#39;ll pick something up along the way that needs to get somewhere<br/>
else. Which makes it so sometimes I forget about the bathroom!! But<br/>
eventually I do get there. Putting the dishes in a sink of water and leaving<br/>
them there is fine. I can&#39;t go out of the house with dishes in the sink but<br/>
I&#39;ve got to the point where they can stay there for awhile when I&#39;m home.<br/>
While the kids are eating or playing alone is a good time to finish them.<br/>
Same with vacuuming and dusting and floors, etc. I find that if I do<br/>
cleaning every single day, I can do it quickly, keep things clean as they<br/>
don&#39;t get out of hand and still have things reasonably neat and still have<br/>
plenty of time for fun.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have chores and I just volunteered to help with the litter box<br/>
which was my oldest&#39;s only thing to take care of. (that I asked her to do) I<br/>
ask for help with cleaning up the kids stuff but I mostly don&#39;t ask, I just<br/>
do and they just do. Do they clean up as much as I would like? No,<br/>
definitely not. But they do help and I have eased way up on what is<br/>
acceptable to me so as not to put it all on them. So I can have a nice<br/>
comfort level attained for me, they are happy and we don&#39;t have chores and<br/>
rules as to who does what and when. I&#39;m also a joyful house cleaner. It&#39;s<br/>
amazing how much that helps.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think it&#39;s hard sometimes though to know exactly what I *have* to<br/>
&gt; do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t think in terms of &quot;have to&quot;. Think in terms of want to.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I think a lot of people have an authority figure voice in their<br/>
heads who tells them what they have to do and won&#39;t let them not do it.<br/>
<br/>
Get rid of the voice. There&#39;s no one there to make you do anything you don&#39;t<br/>
want to do. Give yourself permission to *not* do chores.<br/>
<br/>
By making that mental shift it frees you to do the things you want to do. To<br/>
which some people will then say &quot;Yeah, right. If I only do what I want then<br/>
I&#39;ll do nothing but read, TV and computer. And we&#39;ll live in a pig sty and<br/>
we&#39;ll eventually starve.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone *want* to starve? Does anyone *want* to live in a pig sty? Well<br/>
if they do, then they wouldn&#39;t respond to the suggestion to do what they<br/>
want with sarcasm. They&#39;d be responding with joy ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The only reason that response seems to make sense is because we assume we&#39;re<br/>
only doing chores because that voice in our head makes us. We assume if we<br/>
get rid of the voice we won&#39;t do the chores.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not true. If we give ourselves permission to not do chores, we&#39;ll<br/>
find we really do chores because the consequences of not doing them are<br/>
worse than the consequences of doing them. And we may even find, if we get<br/>
rid of the voice, that we can do chores because we appreciate what they<br/>
accomplish. And maybe even get to the point where we can appreciate the<br/>
process of accomplishing something.<br/>
<br/>
If you give yourself permission to only do what you want, then you can clean<br/>
so you don&#39;t live in a pig sty not because you have to. You can find ways to<br/>
eat because you don&#39;t want to starve. Even better is to cook because you<br/>
want to enjoy the process of cooking, try out new recipes, do something with<br/>
your kids, or do something that you know will make someone smile.<br/>
<br/>
You can scrub the toilet when you notice it&#39;s dirtier than you like it to<br/>
be. You can wash the dishes because you&#39;d like to have clean plates. You can<br/>
wash the sheets because you&#39;d like to have the feeling of clean sheets.<br/>
<br/>
So if you think of chores in terms of something you want to do, something<br/>
that&#39;s important for you, like reading a book, you can in all honesty say<br/>
&quot;I&#39;d like to have some clean dishes for the morning so I want to get that<br/>
done before I go to bed,&quot; just as you might say &quot;I&#39;d like to have some time<br/>
to watch my favorite show.&quot; And just with watching the favorite show, we<br/>
have options. We could skip it. We could tape it (which can cut down the<br/>
time it takes to watch it). We could offer to do the game after the show.<br/>
Unlike reading a book where the purpose is to enjoy the time doing it so we<br/>
don&#39;t want it speeded up with &quot;help&quot; ;-), with chores it&#39;s often the end<br/>
product we want so help can shorten the time it takes to get there and free<br/>
us up for other things. (Though sometimes people appreciate the time alone<br/>
to think that a job (like washing the dishes) provides for them.)<br/>
<br/>
(A little off the topic of &quot;have to&quot; but still on the topic of making chores<br/>
less of a chore ;-) is finding ways to enjoy what we&#39;re doing. If we&#39;re<br/>
folding a child&#39;s clothes it can give us the opportunity to think about how<br/>
great the opportunity is to have the clothes and the child to fold them for.<br/>
We can appreciate the fresh smell. We can think about special meals that<br/>
we&#39;ve cooked in a pan. It sounds sort of like the advice given to 50&#39;s<br/>
housewives to make them happy sappy home makers ;-) But if there&#39;s a path we<br/>
need to walk to get to where we want to go, we can walk it with resentment<br/>
or we can find a way to appreciate the journey.)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing with &quot;have to&quot; is that it often prevents us from seeing new<br/>
ways to accomplish something. If we see a tub full of dishes as an<br/>
inevitable consequence of cooking and eating, then it doesn&#39;t occur to us to<br/>
rethink the problem. But someone here said they only kept available enough<br/>
plates for a meal. That way they never had more than a few dishes to wash.<br/>
Most of us probably have too many clothes in circulation. If there aren&#39;t as<br/>
many clothes then laundry will be done more often but the sorting and<br/>
folding and returning won&#39;t be a huge chore.<br/>
<br/>
(Those are just &quot;out of the box&quot; ways of viewing a couple of chores not<br/>
intended as suggestions for anyone to adopt.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that really answered your question. Having a rule would be a<br/>
lot simpler! Explaining and getting a new philosophy is a lot harder but<br/>
more flexible and more rewarding.<br/>

<br/>
It might be true that you&#39;ve tried many different things, but announcing it<br/>
cuts off discussion where people could offer ideas. It also says you aren&#39;t<br/>
willing to try anything different. That&#39;s just not useful on a *discussion*<br/>
list! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite possible a number of people here have a houseful of strewing-type<br/>
kids who have ways to make the problem easier. If you say &quot;trust<br/>
me&quot;-end-of-discussion then you won&#39;t hear those ways. Closing off situations<br/>
as unsolvable means a solution that could come to you will be turned away.<br/>
Always being open, even if you feel you&#39;ve scraped the barrel of your<br/>
ability to solve a problem, means that solutions could wander in and find<br/>
their way to you.<br/>

wash the sheets because you&#39;d like to have the feeling of clean sheets. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people wash sheets on a certain day every week.  Some weeks the sheets <br/>
hardly  needed it. Sometimes they were uncomfortably dirty three days before, <br/>
but their schedule has priority over the purpose of the task.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the problem schools have.  They gave the curriculum priority over the <br/>
students.<br/>
<br/>
If we see it in educational scenarios, maybe we can see it where it regards <br/>
chores and food and other things.   <br/>
<br/>
Meals on a schedule are necessary when there&#39;s a big family with servants and <br/>
they&#39;re dining formally or having guests.    When three or five people live <br/>
in a house and there are no servants, and the refrigerator doesn&#39;t have a lock <br/>
on it, and especially if someone needs frequent small snacks for some personal <br/>
biochemical reason, having meals on a schedule is putting the clock ahead of <br/>
the humans.<br/>
<br/>
The put-down line about people my age in the 60&#39;s was a snarkily, sarcastic <br/>
&quot;I guess you think if it feels good, do it.&quot;   The clear message was that the <br/>
idea of doing what feels good or doing what seems natural was WRONG wrong <br/>
wrong.  And &quot;the other side&quot; had a slew of messages to refute it:  <br/>
  Work&#39;s not supposed to be fun.<br/>
  If it tastes bad it must be good for you.  (of medicine and vegetables)<br/>
  You&#39;re not here to have fun.<br/>
  No pain, no gain.<br/>
  Suffering is good for the soul.<br/>
 <br/>
Those could pretty much be summarized &quot;If it feels good, DON&#39;T do it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those kinds of messages are hard to shake off.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce talked about voices in our heads/messages we give ourselves on behalf <br/>
of mothers or others.   That&#39;s the &quot;super-ego&quot; for those who want a more <br/>
technical view of it.  Freud&#39;s list of divisions (and there are other lists, of <br/>
course) are &quot;Id&quot; &quot;Ego&quot; Super-Ego.&quot;   I think women more often get the voices of <br/>
mothers and grandmothers, and men might more likely have their dads&#39; voices as <br/>
the main &quot;HEY, what are you doing!?&quot; internal thought-police.  Not exactly the <br/>
same as your conscience, but a big part of it, I think.<br/>
<br/>
I have LOTS of voices in there.  I learned to ignore my mom&#39;s years ago.  I <br/>
have teachers I respected, I have my father-in-law (who makes sense lots of <br/>
times).  I have wise friends&#39; reminders in there.  I have anal friends&#39; reminders <br/>
in there, and I bat them away sometimes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It takes concious effort to develop arguments to defend your own mind against <br/>
the rest of your own mind.<br/>
<br/>
People write and say &quot;What will I tell my grandmother, who used to be a <br/>
teacher, and who keeps our kids one week each summer, about unschooling?&quot;   Those <br/>
questions are common and real, but more common and less tangible is &quot;What will <br/>
you tell the voices inside your head?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why unschooling is such a switch from life as we knew it before we <br/>
decided to leave the well-worn path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975486675">The poster wasn&#39;t talking about being to a scheduled location or <br/>
responsibility. Why can&#39;t the house be cleaned when she arrives home? I have three kids <br/>

going on a date and needs grooming, my house is never going to be Good <br/>
Housekeeping&#39;s house of the year but it is livable and without bugs. I also cannot stand <br/>

before and in the am I wash what is used while the kids eat breakfast. I have too <br/>
many dishes also so I am constantly washing them but we dont do the clean <br/>
before we go. I might but I dont hold up the kids in spite of it.<br/>
My cleaning time is during the babies nap so we are home and have no plans <br/>

I think its all in how it was read. I read it like I have herd others say it <br/>
in the past and what they meant. I read it how my step Mom intended as a <br/>
child. IMO it doesn&#39;t fit or work in the lifestyle I have chosen.<br/>

I love this discussion!! I definitely do NOT live in a sparkling house, but <br/>
it does need to be picked up occasionally and it might be nice to get our <br/>
dishes from the cupboard instead of the sink or dish drainer ~ more than once a <br/>
month &lt;g&gt; I do realize that that is *nice* for me, the kids don&#39;t mind :)  <br/>
Last night, it played out like above ~ we have a friend over today and I <br/>
really wanted (at least) the living room picked up and the kids wanted my <br/>
attention.  I explained I really want to get this done and I&#39;ll have time to play <br/>
later, Hannah immediately said, &quot;Well, we&#39;ll help you mommy so it will be done <br/>
quicker&quot; They were so proud of the job they did!  I was calm and happy and so <br/>
were they and it was a definite win-win situation!  They found all kinds of toys <br/>
and videos that were under the piles, much more like a treasure hunt than <br/>
*chores*.  <br/>
I really loved the *famine/starving* analogy ~ I may get the guts to use it!  <br/>
