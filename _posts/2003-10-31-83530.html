59.00 at Sears for a 13&quot;. That ones in the tv room, the monitor tv broke so <br/>
we thought. Our old Br tv is in the 4yo room so she can watch her tapes as the <br/>
tv room no longer has a VCR. We did buy our oldest a tv years ago and he has <br/>
the Xbox for DVD&#39;s and can move to the tv room if he chooses. Our bedroom has <br/>
the 27&quot; so we can see it and a VCR/DVD combo that the kids use. It has taken <br/>
several years to get them all but they are here for use when wanted.<br/>
<br/>
There is a big price jump on products in the UK. Once when I had my .com a <br/>
customer called from the UK and wanted a Baby Jogger. Here they are 216.00 after <br/>
shipping and cost he was looking at 700.00. He said they ran closer to 800 <br/>
there.<br/>
