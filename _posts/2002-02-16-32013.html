&gt;    This is the story of the Sacred Red Rose<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Red roses were her favorites, her name was also Rose. <br/>
&gt; And every year her husband sent them, tied with pretty bows. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The year he died, the roses were delivered to her door. <br/>
&gt; The card said, &quot;Be my Valentine,&quot; like all the years before. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Each year he sent her roses, and the note would always say, <br/>
&gt; &quot;I love you even more this year, than last year on this day. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My love for you will always grow, with every passing year.&quot; <br/>
&gt; She knew this was the last time that the roses would appear. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She thought, he ordered roses in advance before this day. <br/>
&gt; Her loving husband did not know, that he would pass away. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He always liked to do things early, way before the time. <br/>
&gt; Then, if he got too busy, everything would work out fine. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She trimmed the stems, and placed them in a very special vase. <br/>
&gt; Then, sat the vase beside the portrait of his smiling face. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She would sit for hours, in her husband&#39;s favorite chair. <br/>
&gt; While staring at his picture, and the roses sitting there. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A year went by, and it was hard to live without her mate. <br/>
&gt; With loneliness and solitude, that had become her fate. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then, the very hour, as on Valentines before, <br/>
&gt; the doorbell rang, and there were roses, sitting by her door. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She brought the roses in, and then just looked at them in shock. <br/>
&gt; Then, went to get the telephone, to call the florist shop. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The owner answered, and she asked him, if he would explain, <br/>
&gt; Why would someone do this to her, causing her such pain? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I know your husband passed away, more than a year ago,&quot; <br/>
&gt; The owner said, &quot;I knew you&#39;d call, and you would want to know. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The flowers you received today, were paid for in advance. <br/>
&gt; Your husband always planned ahead, he left nothing to chance. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a standing order, that I have on file down here, <br/>
&gt; And he has paid, well in advance, you&#39;ll get them every year. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There also is another thing, that I think you should know, <br/>
&gt; He wrote a special little card...he did this years ago. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then, should ever I find out that he&#39;s no longer here, <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s the card...that should be sent, to you the following year.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She thanked him and hung up the phone, her tears now flowing hard. <br/>
&gt; Her fingers shaking, as she slowly reached to get the card. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Inside the card, she saw that he had written her a note <br/>
&gt; Then, as she stared in total silence, his is what he wrote... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Hello my love, I know it&#39;s been a year since I&#39;ve been gone, <br/>
&gt; I hope it hasn&#39;t been too hard for you to overcome. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know it must be lonely, and the pain is very real. <br/>
&gt; Or if it was the other way, I know how I would feel. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The love we shared made everything so beautiful in life. <br/>
&gt; I loved you more than words can say, you were the perfect wife. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You were my friend and lover, you fulfilled my every need. <br/>
&gt; I know it&#39;s only been a year, but please try not to grieve <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want you to be happy, even when you shed your tears. <br/>
&gt; That is why the roses will be sent to you for years. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you get these roses, think of all the happiness, <br/>
&gt; That we had together, and how both of us were blessed. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have always loved you and I know I always will. <br/>
&gt; But, my love, you must go on, you have some living still. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please...try to find happiness, while living out your days. <br/>
&gt; I know it is not easy, but I hope you find some ways. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The roses will come every year, and they will only stop, <br/>
&gt; When your door&#39;s not answered, when the florist stops to knock. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He will come five times that day, in case you have gone out. <br/>
&gt; But after his last visit, he will know without a doubt <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To take the roses to the place, where I&#39;ve instructed him. <br/>
&gt; And place the roses where we are, together once again. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes in life, you find a special friend; Someone who changes your <br/>
&gt; life just by being part of it. Someone who makes you laugh until you <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t stop; Someone who makes you believe that there really is good in <br/>
&gt; the world. Someone who convinces you that there really<br/>
&gt; is an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it. <br/>
&gt; This is the Forever Friendship. This is the story of the sacred RED <br/>
&gt; ROSE. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887017188">Hi, Lynda!<br/>
<br/>
What a beautiful piece.  I&#39;ve forwarded it on to two of my dear friends, <br/>
Katherine and Colleen, who each lost their husbands within three hours of <br/>
each other (and at the time, the women didn&#39;t know each other, but the three <br/>
of us are now extremely fast friends).  There&#39;s more beauty in the <br/>
world...read on:<br/>

Subject: Kurtis The Stock Boy,,,,God@work<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was busily working when a new<br/>
voice came over the intercom asking for a carry out at checkout register 4.<br/>
<br/>
Kurtis was almost finished, and wanted to get some fresh air, and decided<br/>
to answer the call. As he approached the check-out stand a distant smile<br/>
caught his eye, the new check out girl was beautiful. She was an older woman<br/>
(maybe 26, and he was only 22) and he fell in love.<br/>
<br/>
Later that day, after his shift was over, he waited by the punch clock to<br/>
find<br/>
out her name. She came into the break room, smiled softly at him, took her<br/>
card and punched out, then left. He looked at her card, BRENDA.  He walked<br/>
out only to see her start walking up the road.<br/>
<br/>
Next day, he waited outside as she left the supermarket, and offered her a<br/>
ride<br/>
home. He looked harmless enough, and she accepted. When he dropped her off,<br/>
he asked if maybe he could see her again, outside of work.  She simply said<br/>
it wasn&#39;t<br/>
possible. He pressed and she explained she had two children and she couldn&#39;t<br/>
afford<br/>
a baby-sitter, so he offered to pay for the baby-sitter. Reluctantly she<br/>
accepted his offer<br/>
for a date for the following Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
That Saturday night he arrived at her door only to have her tell him that<br/>
she was unable<br/>
to go with him. The baby-sitter had called and canceled.  To which Kurtis<br/>
simply said,<br/>
&quot;Well, lets take the kids with us.&quot;  She tried to explain that taking the<br/>
children was not an<br/>
option, but again not taking no for an answer, he pressed.  Finally Brenda,<br/>
brought him<br/>
inside to meet her children. She had an older daughter who was just as cute<br/>
as a bug,<br/>
Kurtis thought, then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair.   He was<br/>
born a paraplegic<br/>
with down syndrome.  Kurtis asked Brenda, &quot;I still don&#39;t understand why the<br/>
kids can&#39;t<br/>
come with us?&quot;  Brenda was amazed.  Most men would run away from a woman<br/>
with two<br/>
kids, especially if one had disabilities. Just like her first husband and<br/>
father of her children<br/>
did. That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the kids, went to dinner and<br/>
the movies.<br/>
When her son needed anything Kurtis would take care of him. When he needed<br/>
to use the<br/>
rest room, he picked him up out of  his chair, took him and brought him<br/>
back. The kids<br/>
loved Kurtis. At the end of the evening, Brenda knew this was the man she<br/>
was going to<br/>
marry and spend the rest of her life with. A year later, they were married<br/>
and Kurtis<br/>
adopted both of her children. Since then they have added two more kids.<br/>
<br/>
So what happened to the stock boy and check out girl? Well, Mr. & Mrs.Kurt<br/>
Warner,<br/>
now live in St. Louis, where he is employed by the St.Louis Rams and plays<br/>
quarterback.<br/>
He was selected Most Valuable Player of the National Football League this<br/>
week before<br/>
he leads his team Sunday in the Super Bowl.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to know more of his dynamic testimony read the book &quot;Kurt<br/>
Warner: The Quarterback&quot;  by Thomas Nelson Publishers<br/>
