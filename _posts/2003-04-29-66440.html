<div id="ygrps-yiv-204887815">This is my first time posting since joining this list about a week <br/>
ago. I&#39;m a little overwhelmed but amazed at the number of daily <br/>
posts. What an inspiration you all are for this recovering &quot;Well <br/>
Trained Mind&quot; addict...<br/>
<br/>
I decided it was time to speak up about this fledgling NE conference <br/>
since I&#39;d like to help with that if I can. I&#39;m in the Amherst area, <br/>
about 2 hrs west of Kathryn in Salem. Please let me know what I can <br/>
do from my remote location.<br/>
<br/>
Question: What about the Unschoolers Network Conference in NJ? I <br/>
haven&#39;t seen it mentioned when posters list the two(?) true unschool <br/>
conferences. Does anyone know anything about the NJ thing? That would <br/>
be fairly accessible for most of us New Englanders, about 3.5 hr <br/>
drive for me. <br/>
