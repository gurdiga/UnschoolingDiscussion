<div id="ygrps-yiv-173933612">yesterday was my mom&#39;s b-day, and everyone was there: me, hubby, and <br/>
my four kids, and my grandbaby; my brother; my sister and her two <br/>
kids. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah is my sister&#39;s littlest, a baby about 4 months old. I was <br/>
carrying her around, and walked past the big mirror in the hallway. <br/>
On a whim,I stopped and showed Sarah her reflection.<br/>
<br/>
You should have SEEN the amazement on her face, as she shifted eye <br/>
contact from her own mirror image, to my mirror image. I could SEE <br/>
the gears turning as she figured it all out. My mom walked past and <br/>
said hello in the mirror, and Sarah&#39;s eyes absolutely bugged out! It <br/>
wsa comical. She looks amazed a lot of the time, anyway, but this was <br/>
just too funny.<br/>
<br/>
So, she sees gramma in the mirror, and then turns her head to see <br/>
Gramma not in the mirror...and gets this frown on her forehead, and <br/>
even looks like going to start whimpering. Confusion, amazement, even <br/>
a little worry...and just plain old &quot;getting it.&quot; Before we were <br/>
done, she was pushing against her mirror foot with her real foot, and <br/>
touching the mirror with her hand. And very happy about the whole <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Very cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember that age, it was one of the best.  We had a long, low mirror in<br/>
Tim&#39;s room.  I would lay him on the floor in front of it and go take a quick<br/>
shower, and when I came back he&#39;d still be happy, grinning at his<br/>
reflection.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a quick trip down memory lane.<br/>
