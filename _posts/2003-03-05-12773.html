<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To end on a humorous note... once I was at a home birth meeting,<br/>
&gt; expecting baby#4, and another pregnant lady who was a pagan also<br/>
&gt; expecting her 4th child told me that her friends were teasing her<br/>
&gt; that if she had any  more babies, people would start to think she was<br/>
&gt; a Christian! I couldn&#39;t stop laughing...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the support, and the laugh.  This was great.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;ve confessed to being kind of religious, I hope nobody&#39;s offended<br/>
at this next thing.  (If you offend easily, stop reading now.)  But this was<br/>
funny enough to need sharing.  I drove past a Thai restaurant this past week<br/>
named.....Phuket<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how that&#39;s supposed to be pronounced, but I know what I read it<br/>
as!  I called my husband who about died laughing, and says we must go eat<br/>
there, and take photos, too!<br/>
