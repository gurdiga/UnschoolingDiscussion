<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504723157">I&#39;m delighted to announce that the first issue of *Connections* ezine of <br/>
unschooling and mindful parenting is online.<br/>
<br/>
We have an amazing group of regular contributers and several great <br/>
feature writers this month, covering topics from unschooling budgets to <br/>
the amazing conferences held this past month in Texas and New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m particularly pleased to announce the addition of an unschooling dads <br/>
column by Ben Lovejoy, which promises to provide lots more unschooling <br/>
insight for moms *and* dads.<br/>
<br/>
Also exciting are the Hot Topics section that covers unschooling and <br/>
mindful parenting highlights from several email lists and Rue Kream&#39;s <br/>
column &quot;Ask Rue&quot; where she answers readers questions with the same <br/>
gentleness and insight she brought to her book, _Parenting a Free Child_.<br/>
