&gt; Yes, parents DO have the legal right to turn TV shows off partway through, <br/>
&gt; and to tell their kids what to do.  And YES they can be unschooling without <br/>
&gt; it.  <br/>
&gt; But when people come and say &quot;I want my unschooling to work like yours <br/>
&gt; does,&quot; <br/>
&gt; and they don&#39;t really want to honestly consider WHY it works well when it <br/>
&gt; works well, it&#39;s frustrating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Back to chocolate chip cookies, my friend Barb LOVES mine and says they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; the best ever.  When she wanted the recipe and I got to &quot;use real butter&quot; <br/>
&gt; she <br/>
&gt; said, &quot;I&#39;m not going to use butter, I&#39;ll use margarine, but go on.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She can&#39;t make cookies like I make them if she insists on margarine.  <br/>
&gt; They&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; be cookies, but her request was for me to give her the recipe for the <br/>
&gt; cookies <br/>
&gt; she had just eaten.<br/>

and the mindful parenting that goes along with it. I will be using butter in my <br/>
cookies!!!<br/>

revising it and put it somewhere. :)<br/>
