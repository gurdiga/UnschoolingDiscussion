<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154797590"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;m really curious about unschooling and learning to read.  My 7yod does not<br/>
&gt; yet read (much...she can read a few words).  I&#39;ve read many articles saying<br/>
&gt; things like: a) just keep reading to the child and s/he will learn to read.<br/>
&gt; b) When s/he&#39;s ready,  she will read,  whether it&#39;s at age 4 or even as late<br/>
&gt; as nine or ten.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Read those articles again.  They&#39;re right!  Actually,  both of my <br/>
children learned to read when they were still in ps,  but I have one <br/>
early reader and one late.  My late reader was sent to a special <br/>
reading teacher, etc. etc. etc.  All this caused was a lot of <br/>
frustration and she still learned to read when she was ready.  <br/>
Finally after homeschooling,  she does love to read even more than my <br/>
early reader.  I&#39;ve had unschooling friends whose kids began to read <br/>
proficiently as late as their early teens.  Relax and enjoy reading <br/>
to her.  I wish I still had a child that enjoyed being read to.<br/>
