Ned and Luz, I LOVED your entire website. I&#39;m even thinking about printing <br/>
out a couple of your articles to keep in my wallet to hand to people when <br/>
they ask why or how we homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
I had several people comment to me this morning about how &quot;smart&quot; my dd <br/>
Casey is. We were at a library activity. I tried to explain that she was <br/>
just excited to be there and eager to participate. The parents heard that we <br/>
homeschool and commented how &quot;that explains it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could have had time to explain to them that Casey, who had handed <br/>
in 5 reading sheets for the library game, has never had a reading lesson. <br/>
She&#39;s never done a unit on Japan or origami. I never forced her to sit <br/>
quietly in a reading group or raise her hand to answer one of the <br/>
librarian&#39;s questions. Yet there she was, smiling, happy and eager to <br/>
participate.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I noticed you live in Guilford. We&#39;re coming east from Utah next week <br/>
for a wedding and will be staying in Guilford. Small world. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>late response, but i love borntoexplore. It led me to consider homeschooling, <br/>
while looking up how to deal with my spirited child. I don&#39;t think the <br/>
unschooling page was there back then, but i found it before i subbed to this <br/>
group. Thank you Ned, Luz, and others here for your continued guidance and <br/>
support. It changes lives, and we are grateful. :0)<br/>
<br/>
I have had the great fortune of meeting a local influence, a lady that <br/>
created a resource online for Columbus, Ohio homeschoolers. Her website made <br/>
the Ohio requirements not as intimidating as they appeared, and gave me the <br/>
courage to go for it. I got to meet her by chance because it is a very small <br/>
world. She has stopped updating her page but it remains online, she has <br/>
teenaged children and is at the end of her homeschooling years. She had no <br/>
idea that she affected my life so, and was glad to hear it. I told her I am <br/>
hoping to carry on the torch for the next generation. I may start an <br/>
unschooling group locally, where none exists that I can find. I hope to <br/>
someday help others the way I have been helped. <br/>
