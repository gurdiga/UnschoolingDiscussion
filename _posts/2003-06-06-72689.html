 </span></blockquote>Hey TreeGoddess, I&#39;m curious<br/>
<br/>
How have you found veganism? I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s difficult to get <br/>
some types of necessary fats without eating some animal protein (My <br/>
veggie sister eats eggs, cheese, and fish. No red meat nor chicken)<br/>
<br/>
I did a vegan diet for a few months and my energy was amazing, but I <br/>
got to craving meat. Oh, that first cheeseburger after I&#39;d not had <br/>
any animal ANYTHING (low fat, too. McDougall Plan).<br/>
<br/>
Then was a (what? Mostly Veggie?) the rest of the year: eating all <br/>
plant foods every day except Sunday, which I called my Feast Day. <br/>
Then I would have some meat.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve heard that there are some nutritional deficits if you <br/>
never have animal protein and some saturated fat (i.e. what you&#39;d get <br/>
from egg or cheese)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>one <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL Okay! L but animal protein is packaged with sat fat, innit? And I <br/>
thought there was some very current nutrition info about the <br/>
necessity of sat fats for optimum human health. Like, for the brain <br/>
cells or some such. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I love flax seed, too. It&#39;s really good on oatmeal. And I&#39;m SURE <br/>
I&#39;ve got nutrition deficits. I know it. But glad to hear about the <br/>
green leafies containing Omegas! never knew that. Okay, i&#39;ve learned <br/>
my something new for the day. NO MORE LEARNING NEEDED TODAY. ;) Guess <br/>
I&#39;d better stay away from the school books, eh? LOL<br/>

B12...We use it to make macaroni and &quot;cheese&quot;...very yummy! We also <br/>
mix it with grinded almonds and sprinkle it on our popcorn...again, <br/>
very yummy!! :)<br/>
<br/>
My kids are vegan, and I am endlessly TRYING!!! (Guess my daughter <br/>
gets traces of what little dairy I eat from breastmilk, but she <br/>
doesn&#39;t eat dairy herself) I was vegan for a few months before I <br/>
became prego again, but started craving dairy again.  But it&#39;s <br/>
starting to taste gross to me again, so hopefully will go vegan for <br/>
good here soon!<br/>

 &quot; Plenty of omnivores are deficient in things too so it&#39;s not only a veg*n<br/>
 issue, but rather a nutrition issue.  I think the fats that you&#39;re<br/>
 thinking of are Omega-3 and Omega-6 Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs).  Flax<br/>
 seeds and oil are very high in Omega-3 EFAs.  I occasionally put a bit<br/>
 in fruit smoothies or sprinkle some seeds in a salad or mix in with soy<br/>
 yogurts and stuff.  Green, leafy veggies are high in Omega-3 EFAs as are<br/>
 walnuts and pumpkin seeds.<br/>
<br/>
 Omega-6 is found in:<br/>
<br/>
     * Safflower oil - the richest natural source<br/>
     * Sunflower oil<br/>
     * Corn oil<br/>
     * Sesame oil<br/>
     * Hemp oil (best balance of omega 6:3)<br/>
     * Pumpkin oil<br/>
     * Soybean oil<br/>
     * Walnut oil<br/>
     * Wheatgerm oil<br/>
     * Evening Primrose oil &quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Being both a vegan and a dietitian, I feel compelled to add to this that<br/>
 everyone in general, and vegans in particular, get far too many omega-6&#39;s<br/>
 and not enough omega-3s for optimal health. To get a more optimal ratio,<br/>
 it&#39;s best to limit omega-6s as much as possible (go easy on margarines and<br/>
 oils high in omega-6), choose oils high in monounsaturates (e.g. olive and<br/>
 canola) for the majority of your fats, and get a daily sources of omega-3&#39;s<br/>
 (1 tsp of flax oil or 1 tbsp of flax seed meal is considered adequate -<br/>
 these should not be cooked as the omega-3&#39;s will be destroyed).<br/>

For my boys, I add flax meal or oil to smoothies with berries. No one <br/>
notices the flax meal because of the berry seeds. We make milkshakes, too, <br/>
with ice cream, and you don&#39;t notice a bit of flax meal in those, either.<br/>

<br/>
This is fine -the heat of the blade isn&#39;t enough to affect the omega-3s.<br/>
Just make sure to store the ground flax in the refrigerator or it will spoil<br/>
quickly. You can even add flax oil to already-heated food (just before<br/>
serving) and it will still be okay - it&#39;s longer, high-heat expose that<br/>
destroys the omega-3s.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, this is a great way to use it! I also stir flax oil into hot cereal<br/>
just before serving and you can&#39;t tell it&#39;s in there. Flax meal is yummy<br/>
sprinkled on salads too.<br/>
