<br/>
&gt; Anyway, I&#39;d like some feedback on how the philosophy of unschooling<br/>
&gt; plays in with socialization issues.  How much do I push them to try<br/>
&gt; new things?  Do I let them set their own pace, even when they say<br/>
&gt; they want more friends but won&#39;t initiate anything?<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t encounter too many other shy kids, and really never see<br/>
&gt; anything written about this in homeschool journals.  Anyone have any<br/>
&gt; ideas or experiences to share?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A park day is pretty hard going for a shyer kid -- kind of like a party for<br/>
a shy adult. :) I&#39;d expect they&#39;d do better when engaged in an activity they<br/>
really like and are interested in (i.e, talking to other kids about dance at<br/>
dance class, about a scout project they&#39;re working on in scouts, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Now, that may bring up the next problem of them finding things they are<br/>
interested in :) but that can be allowed to develop over time.<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter who is not precisely shy, but she isn&#39;t much for<br/>
conversation (with notable exceptions at times &lt;g&gt;) and is definitely a<br/>
homebody. This isn&#39;t a bad trait, it&#39;s just a little different. A quieter<br/>
person doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;cured&quot; unless they really want help with becoming<br/>
more actively social.<br/>
<br/>
If they do want help with this, you might try inviting a family<br/>
(homeschooling or otherwise) with nice kids to your house for an afternoon<br/>
-- it&#39;s probably easier on your kids to show the new ones their toys, their<br/>
yard, their cat... than to try to compete with the whole new park and all<br/>
the families attending.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, and we have certainly done this a lot, and it<br/>
does work well but it hasn&#39;t seemed to help them reach<br/>
out.  I guess I worry that they get left out because<br/>
so much of the bonding (esp at my 11 year old&#39;s age)<br/>
happens now at group gatherings.  Since she tends to<br/>
shut down, not give those social cues in groups that<br/>
encourage friendship, she ends up not really being<br/>
part of groups where she knows the kids.   For<br/>
instance, she took dance class last year with 7 other<br/>
girls that she&#39;s known for years, but she kind of<br/>
faded into the woodwork, and so didn&#39;t get invited<br/>
over after class etc etc.  Then she thinks they don&#39;t<br/>
like her and it becomes this negative feedback loop.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to just model friendly behavior, keep my<br/>
comments encouraging, but I spend a lot of time<br/>
worrying about this.  Unschooling would seem to say<br/>
that I need to let her set the pace, but I&#39;m afraid<br/>
that out of fear, she won&#39;t do things that she&#39;d like<br/>
to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One thing I noticed when my daughter was like this (she went to school) was<br/>
that her nervousness and shyness were causing her to frown a lot.  I pointed<br/>
out to her that the other kids might think she was a snob or didn&#39;t like<br/>
them, rather than the truth, that she was shy and nervous.  That did help<br/>
some, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s happening with your girl.<br/>
