<div id="ygrps-yiv-439541228">dd&#39;s friend was over today.  I suggested they get out the Thinking <br/>
Sticks as we hadn&#39;t got around to actually trying them out yet. After <br/>
a short time of using these, friend said she had a game at home that <br/>
used popsical sticks too - and went home to get them.  These sticks <br/>
have numbers on, and a sheet of paper with *things to do* on, next to <br/>
a number.  If you get stick No3 you have to do what ever it says next <br/>
to No3<br/>
Because the game is quite old, and some of the *things to do* rather <br/>
old fashioned!!!! The 2 girls decided to re write the *things to <br/>
do*.  Instead of &quot;sing like Elvis&quot;  they wrote &quot;sing like the spice <br/>
girls&quot;..... So the next hour was spent rewritting this game and then <br/>
playing it........<br/>
Seems like a good game to play at a party - especially a party for <br/>
the parents after a few drinks!!!!!<br/>
The *things to do* go like this.  Stand on one foot and say a nursery <br/>
rhymn - sing three blind mice while patting your head and rubbing <br/>
your stomach - flip 10 playing cards into a bucket....<br/>

Those are really more for adults (or adults and kids together) than for kids <br/>
alone.  Kids won&#39;t know what to do with some of those concepts (or what they <br/>
are).<br/>
<br/>
The things-to-do game sounds cool, though!<br/>

I think you could actually put what ever you wanted next to the <br/>
numbers.  It could be a learning quiz as well if you wanted.  Might <br/>
be fun to get the kids involved in designing the questions.  here are <br/>
some of the questions in the original game which is called<br/>
CHRISTMAS FORFEITS<br/>
1) Sing like Elvis<br/>
2) Stand on one leg and recite a nursery rhymn<br/>
3) Name Three of Shakespears tragedies<br/>
4) Sing a song from South Pacific<br/>
5) Touch your toes 3 times<br/>
6) Flick 10 playing cards into a bucket<br/>
7) Talk about 4 British Prime ministers for a minute<br/>
8) Collect a book pencile and biscuit within a minute<br/>
9) Pose as a statue for 30 seconds<br/>
10)Suck a sweet and make it last exactly 2 minutes<br/>
11)Speak about Father Christmas for a minute<br/>
12)Sing God Save The Queen      (remember this is an English game)<br/>
13)Balance an apple on your forehead<br/>
14)Do an impersonation of scroge<br/>
15)Walk across the room in exactly one minute<br/>
16)Say *red leather yellow leather* six times<br/>
17)What are the names of 12 American States<br/>
18)Walk the Charlie Chaplin way<br/>
19)Name 3 books by Charles dickens<br/>
20)What are 4 animales begining with *E*<br/>
21)ImpersonateTitania the Queen of fairies<br/>
22)Jump over a chair with style and grace<br/>
23) pat your head and rub your stomach while reciting 3 blind mice<br/>
24) Give some money to a strange person in the room<br/>
25)Sing a song from a soap opers.<br/>
Have fun <br/>

I did participate with the 2 girls with the Thinking Sticks - and was <br/>
surprised at one or two of the *conections* the girls came up with!<br/>
<br/>
Later that evening, after friend had gone home, dd once again took <br/>
out the sticks and proceeded to put them into colour groups.  She <br/>
then tried to match words that she felt went together, like children <br/>
and childbirth.  Decided that religion could go with Germany - <br/>
because the Germans sent the jews to the concentration camps........ <br/>
dd also asked the meanings of several words that she did not <br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
Great idea those Thinking Sticks Sandra - <br/>

for an adult party I mean...  once did the banana dance at a party, <br/>
and won!<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
I love hearing the stories from people using them.  I just fear the stories <br/>
of people trying to get kids to use them as educational tools.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They were first made for a workshop on thinking, for a conference in Texas a <br/>
few years ago.  Some people are naturally acrobatic thinkers and some <br/>
(whether from nature, nurture, or school) are profoundly NOT.  <br/>
