&gt; Hello.  My name is Laura and I have been reading these posts for a while<br/>
 </span></blockquote>now.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have just recently started unschooling my two girls.<br/>
&gt; We are in need of some friends to do &quot;field trips&quot; and just general fun<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;hanging out&quot; kind of stuff.  Not to say that the list isn&#39;t fun to read....<br/>
but it isn&#39;t the same as meeting in person.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We live in the Daytona Beach, FL area.  If there is anyone out there...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we&#39;d be pleased to meet you...................................<br/>

OH that reminds me...... you know what I was thinking today (do you have<br/>
ESP?)...that we could all send an e-mail around and put our kids and their<br/>
ages on it and our names and where we live and anything else we wanted and<br/>
keep cutting and pasting until it is a list of everyone on the list who<br/>
wants to participate---then we would have a better idea huh???  (then some<br/>
**LIKE ME** can print it to remember who is who)<br/>
SOS<br/>
Ok so I guess I will start it<br/>
