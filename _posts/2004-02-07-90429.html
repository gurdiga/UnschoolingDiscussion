You can choose to ignore the [spam] in the subject line or you can have <br/>
those posts filtered directly to your junk mail folder or your trash. <br/>
OR you can do something in between - have a special folder that they go <br/>
into so you can quickly scan the subject lines to make sure there isn&#39;t <br/>
a nonspam post in there. It should not do anything else but add [spam] <br/>
to some of the subject lines - that is ALL it has done that I have <br/>
seen.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had one post labeled as SPAM that wasn&#39;t - one to this list.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t see any reason to USE the spam filter for this list, <br/>
because we moderate all new members until we&#39;ve seen they are not <br/>
spammers, anyway. So I&#39;ll talk to the other owners and moderators about <br/>
turning it off.<br/>
