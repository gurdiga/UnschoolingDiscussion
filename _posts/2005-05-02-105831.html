<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124299775">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I just looked over your baby tumbleweed shots, which brought back a memory I have. My brother was heading off to far away places and I was still home, probably 14. I begged him to bring me a tumbleweed, fully mature, tumbly type. He brought me 2 which I hung up in my room for about 6 months. Maybe a sign of the plantlover I was to become. <br/>

That was generous and noble, because they&#39;re a pain to transport.<br/>
I&#39;ve thought of bringing one to St. Louis as a show&#39;n&#39;tell, but it would  <br/>
take as much room as a person in the van.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve never thought of myself as a plant lover, really, but yesterday when I  <br/>
was working on those pages I was getting more and more excited, and this <br/>
morning  when I went to the post office to mail stuff, there was a new set of <br/>
37cent  stamps on display, four different flowering bulbs, and we have ALL FOUR in <br/>
our  yard.  Very exciting.  And in those colors, too--bearded iris purple  <br/>
with yellow (which were in our yard when we bought the house, but they were  <br/>
dormant and sad from nine years&#39; neglect and now they&#39;re quite fat&#39;n&#39;happy) and  <br/>
pink and white striped tulips (which didn&#39;t come up last year but did THIS and  <br/>
surprised us; from a box of bulbs Keith won at Rowland&#39;s nursery for guessing <br/>
 how many were in the box)...<br/>
 <br/>
So I was thinking, yesterday, about why I&#39;ve pushed back my plant  interest.  <br/>
For many years it just didn&#39;t fit with my medieval music and art  interests, <br/>
and we didn&#39;t have room at the old house for any indoor plants and it  was all <br/>
we could do in the yard to get the stickers gone so the babies could  play <br/>
barefooted.    <br/>
 <br/>
But now I&#39;m in a house I&#39;ll probably stay in for the rest of my life, and  <br/>
the yard is bigger, and there are some deep windowsills, and we&#39;re not so poor  <br/>
that to buy day lilly bulbs is totally out of the question (as we were for a  <br/>
long time).  I can afford potting soil (and we also have room for a big  <br/>
compost pile).   It makes a difference.<br/>
 <br/>
And when I was writing those pages I realized that it was school.   School <br/>
kept me from thinking I had the right to mess with plants.  I didn&#39;t  like <br/>
biology.  People don&#39;t go on to more particular studies without liking  biology and <br/>
chemistry.  You don&#39;t earn botany or genetics without being  good at <br/>
chemistry.  <br/>
 <br/>
My cousin, Nada (who grew up with me, shared a room until we were  14&15), <br/>
used to work at a greenhouse, but she also could keep  houseplants alive for <br/>
years, so I thought she knew things I didn&#39;t know.   She just stayed in bigger <br/>
houses longer, while I was moving from back room to  temporary other place.<br/>
 <br/>
Years passed while I didn&#39;t think about whether I liked plants.  I&#39;ve  grown <br/>
trees from seeds and saplings in that time, it&#39;s been so long.  And  hey, I <br/>
was growing trees!!  Still didn&#39;t notice.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s fun and funny when a big interest can be indwelling in someone for  <br/>
years and they don&#39;t notice.   I was like that about early music, when  I was a <br/>
teen.  I had totally compartmentalized my various musical  interests, and not <br/>
until I graduated and went to tell my old teachers I was  going to teach and <br/>
they&#39;d all say &quot;Music?&quot; that it had occurred to me it might  be something one <br/>
could study.  No, I&#39;d studied English and psychology and  anthropology.  <br/>
 <br/>
Within a few years I realized what I really liked was early music and  <br/>
should&#39;ve known from the hymns I liked at church, the ballads I liked when I  played <br/>
guitar and sang, and the recorder I had learned and gotten pretty good  at.   <br/>
Kinda &quot;duh&quot; to other people, but I was so busy I hadn&#39;t  noticed.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess I&#39;ve been so busy since then I didn&#39;t notice I also like  plants  <br/>
Cool!<br/>
I don&#39;t think my kids will have this problem of thinking they need to have  a <br/>
little resume and good grades to claim interest or knowledge.<br/>
