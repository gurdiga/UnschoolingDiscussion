<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524107445">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Eczema is normally a problem with elimanation & a huge, if not 99% of the<br/>
time caused by dairy products.<br/>
Topical creams do no good as the skin is our largest elimination organ &<br/>
when the large intestine/ colin/lungs get full of mucus from dairy,<br/>
non-sprouted wheat, & other items that are mucous forming, the skin begins<br/>
to show signs. Treat from the inside out...<br/>
<br/>
Instead of spending money on & the torture of tests,  common sense says that<br/>
mammals are not supposed to drink bodily fluids from another mammal after<br/>
weaning.  Not trying to be condescending here, just honest. A good plan is<br/>
to  take your child off of ALL dairy & use sprouted wheat products like<br/>
Eziekiel Bread or Alvarado St. Bakery items or no wheat, strawbeeies for at<br/>
minimum of 90 days & go from there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also replenish her friendly bacteria supply with porbiotic (soy based if<br/>
liquid) & see where you are in 3a few weeks...<br/>
<br/>
www.notmilk.com is a good site about dairy education.<br/>

Hope this helps,<br/>

&gt; Subject: OT--allergy testing for eczema<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi!  Our 3 yr. old dd has had a &quot;curse&quot; of eczema since the fall.  It<br/>
&gt; started because she loved taking baths, so she took a couple a day.  At<br/>
&gt; the time I thought - why not - I&#39;ll just have a REALLY clean kid.  LOL<br/>
&gt; Then the eczema came.<br/>
&gt; Since then we have tried all kinds of creams - herbal and otherwise,<br/>
&gt; homeopathics, oat baths,,,,etc... most of which helped to a point but<br/>
&gt; never got rid of it all together.  We have come to the conclusion that<br/>
&gt; it is triggered by something she&#39;s eating.  So far we have noticed<br/>
&gt; dairy, strawberries and possibly wheat make her rash worse and ITCHY. </span></blockquote></div>

Wow,<br/>
I visited the Not Milk web site and boy did I lean a lot!<br/>
Both our younger children have Eczema and we have been using Elidil. The <br/>
Elidil works to clear it up but it comes right back. I had suspected milk as the <br/>
culprit but also eggs as it tends to flare up more in the baby when he eats <br/>
eggs.<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter drinks way too much milk, so much so that she limits her food <br/>
intake but is on the 75% on the charts. Hmmm....<br/>
I call her my vegetarian as she will eat cucumbers,carrots,apples,olives <br/>
celery and others. She will often not eat her meal but pick out the fruits and <br/>
veggies. When we visit fast foods she eats the fries and drinks the drink and <br/>
gives the baby her chicken nuggets.  With the exception of the Eczema she is and <br/>
has always been a healthy child. (no ear infections, major colds, broken bones <br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Im rambling but I just wanted to say that the no milk site makes sense to me.<br/>

Most people on the planet can&#39;t drink milk and be healthy, but past honesty <br/>
and common sense, there ARE groups of people who (for understandable and common <br/>
sense reasons) have developed milk drinking ability and in some cases need.  <br/>
Laplanders, Tibetans, other northern-dwelling people.  Scandinavians and Brits <br/>
seem to have a lot of milk and cheese tradition and fewer lactose problems.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Got Milk?&quot; campaign is pretty evil, because people of Mediterranean and <br/>
African descent don&#39;t do well drinking milk.<br/>
<br/>
I know the arguments against Cortisone cream, but I also know what it&#39;s like <br/>
to be a kid with excema.    None of my kids has ever had it.  Maybe luck.  (My <br/>
husband never did.)  Maybe diet and more opportunity to be clean and happy.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Laura D<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest daughter (who is now 23) had horrific eczema as a child.  Her <br/>
pediatrician was wonderful and always getting me tapes and articles and new <br/>
information to try to alleviate her symptoms.  He said he had it as a child terribly <br/>
and moderately as an adult.  He felt his biggest problem as an adult was all <br/>
the hand washing he had to do as a doctor.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah was not a milk drinker at all.  She did love bubble bath and playing in <br/>
the pool.  Baths were cut back to a minimum, once a week if possible, just <br/>
washing up in the sink daily.  A good moisturizer is very important, or was to <br/>
my child.  The mixed a product at the drugstore for her eucerin cream (which if <br/>
available OTC) but added the steroids to it since she was so badly affected <br/>
over a large portion of her body those tiny tubes were just not practical.  <br/>
Also she took two different types of allergy medications, apparently eczema has <br/>
an allergic component to it (milk could then be a trigger for some).  She tried <br/>
allergy shots for several years but could never get up to immunity levels <br/>
because of the severity of her allergies, so they had to be stopped.<br/>
<br/>
The doctor had always said while some children just outgrow eczema, he <br/>
doubted a case as severe as Sarah&#39;s would be left behind at puberty.  At about 14 <br/>
without any change in anything we can point to, her eczema tapered off then was <br/>
gone.  We are grateful for that. We never thought there was hope of this.  <br/>
There were lots of secondary infections, inflammations and such that were treated <br/>
throughout the years with more drugs than we were happy with at times.  None <br/>
of my other children have eczema.  My nephew does, his is almost as bad as <br/>
Sarah&#39;s.  It&#39;s very hard for children to be itchy and have painful spots from <br/>
this.  I know there are much better/safer steroidal medicines now than when Sarah <br/>
was little.  I&#39;d use them at least until/if you get it under control.  <br/>
Incessant itching is a horrible thing to endure.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you and your child in getting this ailment under control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201719382">I disagree. There is sufficient evidence to support what I&#39;ve said. <br/>
www.notmilk.com The highest dairy consuming countries (Finland, US,S. <br/>
America) have the highest rates of cancer. This is mostly <br/>
reproductive cancers. There are a very very few Scandinavian groups <br/>
who &quot;tolerate&quot; dairy, but I wouldn&#39;t go near saying it&#39;s healthy.<br/>
<br/>
As far as it &quot;being natural&quot; NO WHERE in nature will you see any <br/>
species, past the age of weaning, nurse from another species EVER. <br/>
It&#39;s not natural.<br/>
<br/>
I digress though, as a majority of most humans are intolerant to <br/>
dairy & the topic is eczema. Dairy products are usually the number 1 <br/>
cause of skin conditions such as eczema.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659359749">Yes, many things can cover symptoms & give temporary relief. I say <br/>
this gently as I consider such symptoms as eczema to be an early <br/>
warning to &quot;pay attention&quot; to what is being eaten. If ignored, I&#39;ve <br/>
seen such things develope into constipation, problems, asthma, <br/>
allergies, & the list goes on & on. I get weary of watching <br/>
pharmaceutical comapnies rake in $$$ for nothing more than meds. that <br/>
cover symptoms without healing. So sad.<br/>
<br/>
There are only a couple of very small caucasian groups who tolerate <br/>
dairy (usually from sheep & goats, not cows) & that&#39;s about it. Most <br/>
all humans have no tolerance for milk products after weaning. <br/>
<br/>
Just for an interesting read, there is Dr. Peter D&#39;Adamo&#39;s site who <br/>
has done quite a bit of research in digestion & ancestry <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737155536">Right, & what Tibets use is generally fermented milk or the fat & is <br/>
nothing in comparison to what Americans use, nor is it probably as <br/>
filthy or hormone laden as US dairy product.<br/>
<br/>
Just because a culture uses dairy does not mean it&#39;s healthy. Even <br/>
African tribes ferment milk with urine and/or blood before <br/>
consumption. Yum. <br/>
<br/>
Tolerating a food does not mean it&#39;s healthy or a good foodchoice as <br/>
some intolerances become the norm as here in the US. <br/>
<br/>
If you have a health issue & consume dairy, it is probably wise to <br/>
stop consuming it right away. This would include PMS or menopausal <br/>
symptoms to early pubery or other hormonal imbalances, diabetes, <br/>
allergies, asthma, constipation...the list goes on & on.<br/>
<br/>
If you insist on using such products, I&#39;d certainly only buy organic.<br/>

Now some people are saying that milk is poison and nobody should drink it.<br/>

I totally agree that some people are healthier when they don&#39;t drink milk.  Some are allergic to wheat.  Some can&#39;t tolerate strawberries.  That doesn&#39;t mean that those foods are poison for everybody.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509619815">I&#39;ll say this again... If you have a health issue to tend to, look at <br/>
what you are eating. The first thing on the list to look at is dairy <br/>
consumption. This is followed by other known common allergens such as <br/>
wheat, peanuts, certain beeries.<br/>
<br/>
The original topic was eczema which is know to be caused by dairy in <br/>
*most* cases.<br/>
<br/>
The proof is in the pudding. Results count, not opinions. For those <br/>
interested in healing eczema, allergies, asthma, cancer, diabetes, <br/>
constipation,ulcers, etc... I suggest you educate yourself about the <br/>
dangers of dairy & go from there.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t listen to me, let a change in diet & those results speak <br/>
for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Most ailments caused from foods like dairy don&#39;t show up immediately, <br/>
but manifest themselves as allergies, skin problems, digestives <br/>
problems, etc... What I have witnessed is that when most all people <br/>
stop eating dairy, amazing things hapen. PMS disapears as does <br/>
allergies they thought were due to pollen. Certainly other foods can <br/>
cause a reaction, but I&#39;ve never seen reports on strawberry <br/>
consumption causing cancer, early puberty, PMS, diabetes, etc... <br/>
Pesticides yes...buy organic. <br/>

Thing is, people in this house don&#39;t drink milk because I think it&#39;s good<br/>
for them. They (as in Joseph and Alyssa only) drink milk because they like<br/>
it. And Joseph has extremely sensitive taste so that if the organic doesn&#39;t<br/>
taste the same, he won&#39;t drink it. Then I have to think if it&#39;s important<br/>
enough &quot;to me&quot; to &quot;force&quot; him to stop. Alyssa drinks other things but Joseph<br/>
pretty much will only drink milk. At least for right now. His tastes may<br/>
change as they usually do, they may not. Educationg myself won&#39;t really help<br/>
much unless I&#39;m willing to &quot;make&quot; my kid not do something he likes to do.<br/>

Welcome, my name is Donna and I have three boys, ages almost eleven, 8 and <br/>
4. We have always been unschooling in many ways but with the help of this <br/>
list we have all been so much happier this past year. I never trusted my <br/>
kids completely to make their own choices but after reading here and at <br/>
unschooling.com I have made changes in my behaviour that have benefitted my <br/>
children enormously. They really can and do make the right choices for them!<br/>

&lt;&lt;Is there something wrong with not allowing your child to consume<br/>
something that is harmful? If left to his own devices, my son would<br/>
eat sugar all day. It&#39;s ok to say &quot;no&quot;. If you educate yourself, &<br/>
your conclusion is that dairy is harmful to your children, don&#39;t buy<br/>
it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well at first I would have to say that I don&#39;t consider my children to be<br/>
ingesting anything harmful. Anything could really be harmful if they had too<br/>
much, even water. But I don&#39;t tell them they are not allowed and they do<br/>
find what and how much works for them. The second I would naturally think to<br/>
ask you is how you actually know that your child would eat sugar all day and<br/>
then how long would he actually do it afterwards? (I&#39;m hearing groans from<br/>
some as I post) Sugar all day for the rest of his life? I&#39;m assuming here<br/>
but I would say no he wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am the adult & the parent. I make the decisions as to what my<br/>
children eat, just as I guide them in what they view via TV, media,<br/>
movies, reading material, etc...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make the decisions as to what my kids eat, watch, read and play,<br/>
they do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;d not let my child consume something that wasn&#39;t healthy for him<br/>
simply because he loves it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again what you see as harmful and what I see as harmful are two different<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Again, I don&#39;t want to sound condescending, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m<br/>
understanding you clearly. It&#39;s perfectly ok to refuse a child<br/>
something that may be harmful.No one in this house would get dairy<br/>
anymore than I&#39;d allow them to have cigarettes or white sugar.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t refuse my child things whether I think they are harmful or not. I<br/>
talk to them about choices and the why and why nots and they make their own<br/>
decisions accordingly. So far it&#39;s done us well. I guess I&#39;ll keep taking my<br/>
chances. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are things that my kids will never try. It would be impossible (I<br/>
would think) for them to try everything there is. But I won&#39;t keep them from<br/>
those choices because of what I think. If I did, there would eventually come<br/>
a time where I wouldn&#39;t be able to do that any longer anyway. This way I<br/>
know those decisions will be based on what they want and not what I wanted<br/>
and not on what I wouldn&#39;t allow them to have.<br/>

<br/>
I know you mean well ---and even though I am not a medically trained <br/>
person --- I have to disagree here. If she has identified wheat as a <br/>
problem ALL WHEAT will be a problem, whether processed, sprouted, whole <br/>
grain, you name it. I&#39;d stay away from spelt as well.<br/>
<br/>
Most food-based allergic reactions are triggered by a protein compound; <br/>
gluten being the culprit in wheat, for example. If you are allergic to <br/>
wheat it does not mean you are allergic to all glutens but gluten, as a <br/>
marker, will point to other potential problems. So wheat in any guise <br/>
will be a problem and maybe, just maybe, other wheat-like allergens or <br/>
foods as well (if she is sensitive to wheat she may also have, for <br/>
example, grass seasonal allergies).<br/>
<br/>
When people speak of dairy, unfortunately they invariably speak of COW <br/>
based products. The lactose in cow-derived products is not only the <br/>
most difficult to digest but the most genetically tinkered dairy source <br/>
known to humanity. Just because one is allergic to cow-dairy it this <br/>
does not mean that one will be allergic to all dairy --sheep and goat <br/>
dairy products are viable options. Still I have read of cases where <br/>
kids where so sensitive to lactose that they were allergic to their <br/>
mother&#39;s milk (I read this in a &#39;Living Without&#39; magazine, btw). So <br/>
COW-dairy is another marker but it does not necessarily mean that all <br/>
dairy has to be taken away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;d also replenish her friendly bacteria supply with porbiotic (soy <br/>
&gt; based if<br/>
&gt; liquid) & see where you are in 3a few weeks...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Soy is another one of those highly allergenic foods because it has been <br/>
been the darling of the GMO industry way before it was cool to eat tofu <br/>
in this country. Soy is one of those foods that people really have to <br/>
keep an eye out. Acidophilus may be an alternative but I personally <br/>
have not researched it enough to give an informed opinion about it.<br/>
<br/>
Evan has soy as a mild allergy marker. What is weird about soy is that, <br/>
in the guise of soy milk or flour, it used to trigger an asthma attack <br/>
or afflict with IBS for weeks. Not so with tofu. That is, of course, <br/>
before we did homeopathy.<br/>
<br/>
That is why I think it is important to know all the allergy markers so <br/>
that the medical treatment --whether allopathic or homeopathic -- can <br/>
be truly successful. You need to know all that is causing her pain and <br/>
how all those allergens interact.<br/>

<br/>
He might if sugar has been a rare and restricted thing.   It works that<br/>
way for some people.  If a thing has been very limited, when it finally<br/>
becomes available it takes a while for them to feel like they&#39;ve had<br/>
enough. <br/>
<br/>
He wouldn&#39;t eat sugar all day every day, forever. <br/>
<br/>
My son has lived without restrictions on sweets, TV, movies or reading<br/>
material.<br/>
   <br/>
Here&#39;s a recent story. <br/>
<br/>
Saturday we were expecting some friends and I made a chocolate cake.  <br/>
Dylan had one piece of cake that day and hasn&#39;t had any since.   It&#39;s<br/>
Tuesday and I still have half a cake.  It was a good cake too!&lt;g&gt;  No one<br/>
here is desperate for sweets.   <br/>
<br/>
Tonight he asked for brown rice and broccoli.  We have pop and potato<br/>
chips in the house, corn chips and cake, but he hasn&#39;t selected those<br/>
things.  He&#39;s never selected them steadily or to the exclusion of<br/>
everything else.  Why would he?   With lots of choices why would he limit<br/>
himself to one thing? <br/>
<br/>
You clearly care about your family&#39;s well being.  Thinking about their<br/>
ability to care about their own well being and happiness is a good thing<br/>
too.   There is no reason to assume children want to have less happy or<br/>
healthy lives than we hope they will have.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588942985">There are two proteins in cow&#39;s milk that people can be allergic to.  <br/>
One protein is present in both cow and goat milk, the other is only <br/>
present in cow milk.  That&#39;s why some people who are allergic to cow <br/>
milk can drink goat milk and other people can&#39;t.  When you have the <br/>
skin prick test done it tells you if you&#39;re allergic to one or both <br/>
of those proteins but it doesn&#39;t tell you which one.  So the only way <br/>
to know is to try the goat milk and see if you have an allergic <br/>
reaction.  <br/>
<br/>
Or just get treated homeopathically and drink anything. ;) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296683564">Mary and all,<br/>
<br/>
W&#39;s recommendation of taking a closer look at your diet is not a bad <br/>
idea but, to be more frank this will be the end of your food innocence. <br/>
If there are some foods you have been having problems with, you will <br/>
kick and scream until it hurts because gosh darn it, it tastes so good.<br/>
<br/>
Wheat is a horrible thing in Evan&#39;s digestive tract. It virtually kills <br/>
it --he will not have a bowel movement for days, even a week, if we <br/>
leave it unattended. And from there, his body reacts so violently to <br/>
the reaction that he will have asthma for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped buying regular bread altogether because he looooooooooves the <br/>
smell of freshly baked bread (I&#39;m a chef and love baking). And, to make <br/>
matters worse, I was in denial about what wheat does to me as well --it <br/>
is said that children are born with allergies that their mothers <br/>
develop during their pregnancies. I not only developed an intolerance <br/>
to EGGS (I used to eat one almost every day) which I  thought was <br/>
chronic fatigue syndrome but also developed IBS  (which I thought was a <br/>
&#39;temporary&#39; bout of gas that lasted 4.5 years) and a rabid Candida <br/>
thanks to both WHEAT and COW-DAIRY. Oh, and I had post-partum <br/>
depression for 4 years (2 years after Evan, 2 after Aidan) that was <br/>
exacerbated by these foods.<br/>
<br/>
How do I know? Under an allopathic doctor they were considered <br/>
sensitivities and a psychiatrist said that feeling ill would have made <br/>
my depression worse. Under homeopathy, the proving that tackles the <br/>
depression is also the one that tackles these three food allergies AND <br/>
reactions; meaning IBS, Candida, pp depression (plus a host of other <br/>
problems I had like ciatica and amenorrhea).<br/>
<br/>
Am I happy that I cannot have wheat? Let&#39;s put it this way, it makes me <br/>
sooooo ill, that the way I feel healthy far outweighs my cravings for <br/>
the food. I am a human being these days and not a bag of illnesses. <br/>
That said, I arm myself with extra doses of homeopathics for the <br/>
occasional croissant --and prepare myself emotionally to deal with the <br/>
consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. Once your family finds what healthy is --not just <br/>
means-- they&#39;ll learn to love it and honor it. Evan is 6 years old and <br/>
will not even touch spelt for fear of the consequences. He has learned <br/>
the hard and painful way how to make the choices that are best for him <br/>
because he knows how horribly ill he can get.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>

&gt; Thing is, people in this house don&#39;t drink milk because I think it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; good<br/>
&gt; for them. They (as in Joseph and Alyssa only) drink milk because they <br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; it. And Joseph has extremely sensitive taste so that if the organic <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; taste the same, he won&#39;t drink it. Then I have to think if it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; important<br/>
&gt; enough &quot;to me&quot; to &quot;force&quot; him to stop. Alyssa drinks other things but <br/>
&gt; Joseph<br/>
&gt; pretty much will only drink milk. At least for right now. His tastes <br/>
&gt; may<br/>
&gt; change as they usually do, they may not. Educationg myself won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; really help<br/>
&gt; much unless I&#39;m willing to &quot;make&quot; my kid not do something he likes to <br/>
&gt; do.<br/>
