<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145747606">Our oldest (6 1/2) has had a bladder infection and I&#39;ve been going in before <br/>

the weather, I&#39;ve found a way that wakes him and he&#39;s not only cheerful, he&#39;s <br/>
giggling! I&#39;ve almost always checked in on him before I go to bed, but don&#39;t <br/>
try to wake him unless he&#39;s stirring-and even then, sometimes, he doesn&#39;t wake <br/>
when I ask if he wants a drink of water. His treatment will be over in about <br/>
a week, but we have been enjoying each other so much on these early morning <br/>

when we have these early morning &quot;giggles&quot;, he doesn&#39;t get up until 11, 11:30, <br/>
almost noon (he had an activity, and was woken, so I&#39;m not sure how long he <br/>
would have slept.) My question (long story, short question) is: if after the <br/>
treatment is over, and I continue to wake him (with him waking happily, of <br/>
course), JUST to enjoy him for 5-10 minutes and no other &quot;valid&quot; reason-am I being <br/>
selfish? It is probably some of the BEST or most quality time we have together <br/>
since the baby came, and I find I&#39;m REALLY enjoying it-realising how much I <br/>
miss him during the day, but I don&#39;t want to &quot;take advantage&quot; of him just to <br/>
satisfy my need. What do you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215384601">Sang, unless I&#39;m badly mistaken, your son probably treasures this time with<br/>
you as much as you do.  Unless he says that he resents your disturbing his<br/>
sleep, I&#39;d say keep it up!  It could be the start of a wonderful daily<br/>
ritual that will form lifelong happy memories.<br/>

You might just tell him you don&#39;t have to wake him anymore for treatment<br/>
but that you&#39;ll sneak in and kiss him.   Maybe he&#39;ll tell you to wake him<br/>
anyway or maybe he&#39;ll be happy to keep sleeping knowing you&#39;ll still be<br/>
there with a kiss. <br/>

<br/>
Instead of looking at your own part of it and wondering if you&#39;re selfish, <br/>
ask him!   Does he LIKE being woken up?   Maybe he really does.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times Holly will ask me to wake her up at a certain time every day, <br/>
and I will until/unless she cancels her standing order.     If he doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to wake up then, he can let you know.   He was going to wake up eventually one <br/>
way or another, so if he&#39;s happy to see your face first thing, COOL!   If <br/>
you&#39;re not doing it against his will, how could it be taking advantage of him or <br/>
&quot;just&quot; satisfying your need?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t think to ask him myself :~D I found out that he <br/>
really DOES like it, and wants me to continue! I guess early morning is a good <br/>
time for both of my boys to have some good, enjoyable, fun, snuggle time alone. <br/>
I don&#39;t mind at all that it pushes my bedtime back a half hour or so-it is <br/>
great to spend that kind of time with each of them! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
