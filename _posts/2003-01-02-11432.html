regarded in Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
McDonald&#39;s trials Spam breakfasts in Hawaii<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
McDonald&#39;s are trialling a new breakfast meal made of Spam in their<br/>
restaurants in Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
Spam is extremely popular in the state and the new meal is being sold in every<br/>
McDonalds restaurant there.<br/>
<br/>
The Spam breakfast also includes egg and rice.<br/>
<br/>
McDonald&#39;s says it will serve the breakfast until the end of July and then<br/>
decide if it is selling well enough to add to a menu that already includes<br/>
rice, Portuguese sausage and saimin, reports the Pacific Business News.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most popular Spam dishes currently served in Hawaii is Spam musubi,<br/>
which consists of a strip of cooked Spam, on a block of rice and held in place<br/>
by a sushi-style seaweed girdle.<br/>
