<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943187062">My name is Pamela and I have been reading for a while now and I must say that <br/>
<br/>
I am impressed with the list. I am intrigued by the views and opinions <br/>
offered here and I feel stronger in my decision to homeschool/unschool. <br/>
<br/>
I am the proud MaMa of Andrew, 6 and Mason, 2. These two amazing people <br/>
changed my life and that of my dh from long before their births. I knew from <br/>
day <br/>
one that I wanted to stay home and homeschool. I lost my courage somewhere <br/>
along the line and I am not so proud to say that Andrew is in Kindergarten. <br/>
We <br/>
debated and debated and visited schools, private, church-based, etc. We <br/>
finally settled on a fundamental school, which I really haven&#39;t had any <br/>
&quot;problems&quot; <br/>
with, other than the fact that I just know it&#39;s wrong. Which, I guess is a <br/>
BIG problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the response thus far and I totally agree.<br/>
<br/>
I have NO idea how this got sent when it was in my Mail Waiting To Be Sent <br/>
folder, but now that I am back on track, I&#39;d like to continue.  I am definitely <br/>
going to submit my Notice of Intent for next year and I almost feel as if I <br/>
should do it now, but I feel that since we did it thus far, that we should <br/>
finish it.  We had always talked about homeschooling and Andrew has asked me <br/>
several times throughout this year why we aren&#39;t doing it.  We tell him the truth, <br/>
that we were not sure if it was something we could do and hope that he was <br/>
learning all he should (is there even a &quot;should know&quot; stage?).  But I also asked <br/>
him if he wanted to keep going and he said yes and asked if it would be ok if <br/>
he stayed home some days when he didn&#39;t want to go, and of course this was <br/>
answered yes as well.  Well, this past Monday, a letter was sent home saying that <br/>
Andrew had 5 excused absences but if it continues that we would have to get <br/>
together to make a plan for better attendance.  I was upset because he was so <br/>
upset.  He asked me to tell him what it was about and he was upset because he <br/>
felt they were mad at him.  I told him that they weren&#39;t but that schools just <br/>
want the kids to be there everyday, on time, blah blah blah.  He said, &quot;Well, <br/>
when it&#39;s so nice out, I don&#39;t wanna go,&quot; and &quot;Mason gets lonely without me and <br/>
I need to be here sometimes.&quot;  And the conversation went like that for a <br/>
while.  What would others do?  I feel tied up about this.  He&#39;s there for 3 hours, <br/>
only 2 of which are probably even useful.  But when we made this decision we <br/>
thought this was the best school if we&#39;re gonna do school at all, but didn&#39;t <br/>
realize that since it is so far away and we have to all get ready, this has put <br/>
Mason on a schedule and he ends up spending half the day getting ready to go <br/>
and stuck in the van, and then ready to go again to pick Andrew up.  I just <br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling was something I had heard of and the idea was and is exhilarating <br/>
but my state seems too strict, too much red tape, they require testing each <br/>
year.  I don&#39;t understand how the state can require testing each year but in <br/>
school they are only tested in certain grades.  I had read all the stuff on <br/>
Sandra&#39;s site about testing and so I looked up some resources to get tests and <br/>
came across an interesting thing.  The Seton site says you may not read the test <br/>
to your child, that it should be completed with their knowledge only. WHAT!!!! <br/>
 How can a non-reading child take a test without help?  You are only supposed <br/>
to show them the basics, like filling in all the little circles and then they <br/>
are on their for each timed exercise.  Is there anyway around this?  Are <br/>
there any unschoolers in VA that have been down this road?  I am truely a newbie <br/>
and I want so much to succeed in this, because I&#39;d like nothing more than to go <br/>
back to life before Kindergarten and just let my children be kids and learn <br/>
their own way in their own time, by their own means.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your support thus far, the list is AMAZING!!<br/>

<br/>
That is if you want the scores to be as accurate a reflection of what he <br/>
knows as it can be (which is rarely too accurate).<br/>
<br/>
If you just want to fulfill the letter of the law without getting the <br/>
negative effects of testing, you&#39;ll probably  need to ignore the precise directions <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you really don&#39;t want your son to be in school, and <br/>
from what you wrote he wouldnt mind not going anymore either. I know <br/>
you said that when you asked him if he wanted to finish out the year, <br/>
he said &quot;yes&quot; but i wonder if thats how he really feels, or maybe if <br/>
he needs &quot;permission&quot; from you that it really is ok not to go back.<br/>
<br/>
I pulled my son out of first grade in December, every day was <br/>
torture. The torture was in the little things (having to get up and <br/>
get ready by a certain time, having to follow all the little inane <br/>
rules that schools have, etc)...i&#39;d already stopped making him (or <br/>
even reminding him!)to do homework. Now that my son is home...oh <br/>
my...life is great. It is an incredible weight lifted off of you and <br/>
your child when you realize &quot;We don&#39;t have to deal with it anymore!&quot; <br/>
IMO finishing the next two or three months of kindergarten is not <br/>
worth the impact on the family each day of going can cause, and in <br/>
five years you&#39;ll look back and wonder how you ever thought it <br/>
mattered to &quot;finish out the school year.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I know sometimes its hard to leave things unfinished, esp when its so <br/>
close to &quot;being done&quot; (in my son&#39;s case he just never went back, and <br/>
didnt say goodbye to anyone at the school, or even get his <br/>
stuff)....but i have to say that my only regret about pulling my son <br/>
out of school is that i waited so long to do it. <br/>

<br/>
Pull him out of school &quot;for now&quot; (after all summer is just around the<br/>
corner). Do what you need to do to get legal. Join your local support group<br/>
for playdates. Do the hard mental work you need to do to get schoolish<br/>
language and thinking out of your head. (see SandraDodd.com for immense<br/>
assistance in that area). Never look back.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The Seton site says you may not read the test <br/>

Is there anyway around this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes - *totally ignore* the instructions on the website. The test is a<br/>
service you are paying for. You are in charge not &quot;them&quot;. <br/>
Also let go of any notion of &quot;cheating&quot; and realize that you are being<br/>
coerced by the government into an educational practice with which you do not<br/>
agree (ie the spurious need to test) and accept that all you are doing is<br/>
jumping through some hoops and you can adjust the height off the ground to<br/>
make it as painless as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively have him fill the circles at random and never look at the<br/>
score.<br/>

guess I&#39;m just not happy about having to test at all, I&#39;d like to know what he&#39;s <br/>

realistically.<br/>
<br/>
That is so true that it will start anew after I pull him out, but he wants to <br/>
go and that is my problem right now, I don&#39;t know if I should just end it or <br/>
finish it cuz there&#39;s only 11 weeks left.<br/>

them, not send them off to some school/babysitter/or daycare to be raised by <br/>
others with vastly different opinions and backgrounds.  And at the tender age of 5 <br/>
small years!!!!!  But I did it and fortunately for me, Andrew is a very <br/>
outgoing child and has seemingly enjoyed most of Kindergarten.  That is my dilemma <br/>
now, we are a family on Saturday and Sunday.  Monday thru Friday feels like we <br/>
are just functioning but not living.  We used to live 24/7 but I feel I am <br/>
holding my breath until Friday afternoon.  Our school district even took one of <br/>
those Saturdays for a snow make-up day and that was the hardest day yet.  And <br/>
they may have to do more, they have added a day or two at the end of the year <br/>
as well.  Thanks for sharing, each new thing is helping me.  And I like that <br/>
website. <br/>

You are allowing &quot;them&quot; to have all the power in your lives, and it is<br/>
causing you pain that seems to be more revealed with every post. 100% of the<br/>
people who post about pulling their kids out, on this list and other<br/>
non-unschooling lists, say the same thing: They wish they had done it<br/>
sooner. If, in the immensely unlikely event, it doesn&#39;t work out, schools<br/>
will still be there next session, next year, next lifetime.<br/>

<br/>
First of all, if you are getting your information from any source that makes<br/>
it&#39;s money supporting the school system, including the testing sites,<br/>
college prep tutoring organizations, and the local Department of Education,<br/>
you will find that the language although legal in the letter of the law is<br/>
probably skewed on the side of creating fear and preserving the status quo.<br/>
Even the word &quot;probation&quot;, with it&#39;s connotations of criminality, is a clue.<br/>
If you go to the NHEN website and click on Legal and Legislative Info, you<br/>
find that the statutes for VA include the portfolio option, individual<br/>
assessments or standardized tests.<br/>
Talk to others actually in your state - NHEN is another useful source for<br/>
those also. There are a number of folks from VA on this list, and several of<br/>
them have mentioned their unschooling friendly evaluators. &quot;Making you&quot; put<br/>
your child back in school against your will is a lot harder than &quot;they&quot;<br/>
would like you to believe, and takes years, not terms. BTW most of the<br/>
statutes talk about the child &quot;showing progress&quot; each year - how can a free,<br/>
happy child with engaged caring parents not show progress? It is not about<br/>
re-creating the &quot;results&quot; of a school year since you are out of the bell<br/>
curve.<br/>
The more fear testing generates in you, the faster you should run to other<br/>
methods of review - so that the idea of tests does not become an all<br/>
powerful boogeyman in the minds of your kids. I don&#39;t do too much school<br/>
bashing (fish in a barrel), but there is a time and place for almost<br/>
everything so here goes - Schools as an entity, have a vested interest in<br/>
making that which is natural, simple and easy, seem difficult and<br/>
non-intuitive. Reading is the classic example of this concept. Tests are<br/>
supposed to be scary, important and full of dire consequences. Don&#39;t buy<br/>
into it. Tests can be a fun thing IF the motivations are internal and<br/>
individual. People choose to test themselves all the time - for REAL skills<br/>
or abilities or learning opportunities. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time talking about specific state laws <br/>
and how to satisfy them, but people do unschool in every state, somehow <br/>
or another. For example, Virginia homeschool law provides options and <br/>
testing is only one of them. If people want to unschool in some states, <br/>
they&#39;re going to have to be a little more clever, work a little harder <br/>
to not get sucked into the requirements. What Virginia law requires is <br/>
&quot;evidence of progress&quot; such as independent assessment, standardized <br/>
test scores or a portfolio review or anything the district <br/>
superintendent is satisfied with. Just like in every other state, what <br/>
is important is to get into contact with other unschoolers in that <br/>
state (or even in that district, if possible) and find out what they do <br/>
- maybe they do independent assessments - maybe you can find an <br/>
evaluator who is unschooling friendly. I&#39;m not sure that the evaluator <br/>
even has to be in your state - I wonder if you could use Clonlara - <br/>
they are VERY unschooling friendly and may already have worked in your <br/>
state and have already prepared materials to satisfy the state <br/>
standards and still allow you to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
This list is really for talking about living an unschooling life - <br/>
talking about legal issues could take up ALL our time and we usually <br/>
try to move people away from that pretty quickly. However, again, I <br/>
want you to feel encouraged because there are definitely ways you can <br/>
unschool, no matter what state requirements you have to deal with.<br/>

They aren&#39;t really &quot;taking&quot; those days, you are giving them to them.  Big<br/>
distinction.  Even if your son wants to finish the year, he doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
go every day.  Especially a Saturday!<br/>

They did that here too. Why on earth would you send him for that? What happens if he misses to many days? I know they probably threaten to retain him another year. Well if he&#39;s not going back then who cares?????<br/>
<br/>
Even if you never planned to unschool or homeschool, this is &quot;K&quot; you are talking about. What does it matter if he misses a day, a week, a month?<br/>

  Amazing article and truly touching.  I feel a lot of those things on my side <br/>
  too.  I have always felt that I had my children because I wanted to raise <br/>
  them, not send them off to some school/babysitter/or daycare to be raised by <br/>
  others with vastly different opinions and backgrounds.  And at the tender age of 5 <br/>
  small years!!!!!  But I did it and fortunately for me, Andrew is a very <br/>
  outgoing child and has seemingly enjoyed most of Kindergarten.  That is my dilemma <br/>
  now, we are a family on Saturday and Sunday.  Monday thru Friday feels like we <br/>
  are just functioning but not living.  We used to live 24/7 but I feel I am <br/>
  holding my breath until Friday afternoon.  Our school district even took one of <br/>
  those Saturdays for a snow make-up day and that was the hardest day yet.  And <br/>
  they may have to do more, they have added a day or two at the end of the year <br/>
  as well.  Thanks for sharing, each new thing is helping me.  And I like that <br/>

My daughter missed 54  days of 5-K.  Her first grade teacher thought she was<br/>
going to be some dumby and was shock at the fact she was top in the class.<br/>
We took off whenever we wanted and played, traveled, etc.  5-K isn&#39;t<br/>
required in SC and probably isn&#39;t in your state either.  I wouldn&#39;t stress<br/>
over this.  BTW, I too wish I had taken my two girls out sooner than I did.<br/>
I resonate with the holding your breathe until Friday and just trying to<br/>
function through the week.  Life is too good to waste!  Free yourself!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Be careful about this. It isn&#39;t required in California, either, but <br/>
once you enroll in Kindergarten it IS required to attend or the child <br/>
is truant and they have SPECIAL anti-truancy catch-them-early programs <br/>
aimed at kindergarten. If you miss too many days in k, they target you <br/>
in first grade and they go after you very very quickly for truancy - <br/>
straight to the district attorney, not even through the normal school <br/>
attendance review board channels. Only some districts participate in <br/>
this special program - but they are relentless. I know someone whose <br/>
child was seriously ill - chronically ill. She tried to send her to <br/>
kindergarten, but had many bouts of lengthy absence due to <br/>
hospitalizations. She also let her daughter not go when she didn&#39;t feel <br/>
like it because she never knew when she was getting sick or not. In <br/>
first grade the first time her daughter was absent they sent a truancy <br/>
report to the district attorney who contacted her and said they were <br/>
going to ask for a court order to require her to send her child to <br/>
school. They GOT it and the court ordered that even if her child was <br/>
sick she had to take her in to be examined there at the school. The <br/>
ONLY exception was if she had chickenpox.  I met her at that time <br/>
because she tried to pull her child all the way out of school and <br/>
homeschool her. But- once the court is involved they have so much <br/>
jurisdiction it is amazing - she had to get their permission otherwise <br/>
she&#39;d be in violation of the court order. So - be careful about <br/>
assuming that just because kindergarten is not mandatory that you can <br/>
just choose to go or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874532439">Here in PA, if you enroll in K, and then withdraw, you still don&#39;t have to report until age 8.<br/>
<br/>
But if your child attends first grade in a public school, and you withdraw to homeschool, you *do* have to report, even if your child isn&#39;t 8 yet. <br/>

&lt;&lt; I will definitely look over your site again, it has been very helpful, I <br/>
guess I&#39;m just not happy about having to test at all, I&#39;d like to know what <br/>
he&#39;s <br/>
learned throughout his explorations but I don&#39;t think the state needs to know <br/>
that and from what I&#39;ve seen of these tests they don&#39;t measure anything <br/>
realistically. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the whole point of invalidating the tests by taking/administering them <br/>
&quot;wrong.&quot;  Then you and the child are both certain that it didn&#39;t even begin <br/>
to measure anything realistically.<br/>

&lt;&lt;That is so true that it will start anew after I pull him out, but he wants <br/>
to <br/>
go and that is my problem right now, I don&#39;t know if I should just end it or <br/>
finish it cuz there&#39;s only 11 weeks left.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Neither school nor homeschooling starts off on a good foot with a child who <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to be there.   If he wants to be in school and you pull him out, <br/>
he could resent homeschooling and idealize school.<br/>
