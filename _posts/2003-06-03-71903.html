<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775686066">A friend of mine seems to be having a blast listing serial killers etc that were homeschooled - she thinks she&#39;s making a point.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of great people were homeschooled - for example Ben Franklin.  I&quot;m drawing a blank on others - any ideas?<br/>

voice [tee hee] all four presidents on Mount Rushmore were homeschooled for <br/>
all or part of their education.  It&#39;s a homeschool shrine, round here :-D  We&#39;re <br/>
also lucky to have a local newscaster who was homeschooled and a weather man <br/>
who is homeschooling his kids.  <br/>

What serial killers were homeschooled and for how long?  I haven&#39;t heard of<br/>
any.<br/>

This reminds me of a statistic that I heard about and want to look up, I&#39;ll <br/>
go do that now, but IIRC,  in the colonial days, before institutionalized <br/>
schooling, there was a 90% literacy rate, and that included women and slaves.....<br/>

Well, I give up, earliest school was 1712, and I could only find literacy <br/>
statistics as far back as 1870.....<br/>
All those statistics...making my head feel heavy....have <br/>
to...stop....now...*thunck* <br/>

&quot;Deanna Laney. She&#39;s the one that just killed her sons in Texas&quot;<br/>

&quot;this very second I am listening to the story of the Olympic bomber (Eric Rudolph). He homeschooled too.&quot; <br/>

As soon as I have some spare time I&#39;ll look up the others and let you guys know.  My BIL is in ICU over in England so things are a bit stressed around here right now.<br/>
