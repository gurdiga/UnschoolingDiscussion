<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331083328">Cath, Charlotte Mason is more of a philosophy, there are a set of books you<br/>
can buy.  Why do you feel like you do not fit in with Christian HS groups?<br/>
I wear a covering and wear long modest dresses, and don&#39;t cut my hair<br/>
anymore, therefore I don&#39;t look like most all of the other HS moms.  Some of<br/>
them are reluctant to talk to me at first, I think they may think I might be<br/>
judgemental, so I have learned to try to break the ice myself.  Sometimes<br/>
you just have to be the one to reach out.<br/>
