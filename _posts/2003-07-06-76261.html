<div id="ygrps-yiv-892891965">I have a question for folks about leaving kids with people they don&#39;t know<br/>
or hardly know.  What do you do when you&#39;re on the receiving end of that?<br/>
<br/>
A neighbor dumped her kids here yesterday, and it was hard for them.  It was<br/>
an emergency, in Mom&#39;s mind, but it was someone else&#39;s emergency, and she<br/>
didn&#39;t really HAVE to go.  So first, I felt like she chose to stick her kids<br/>
anywhere to deal with something that wasn&#39;t her problem in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
But her two year old was truly freaked out; she&#39;s seen me on the playground<br/>
between our buildings, of course, but never been to my house.  She cried and<br/>
cried, but when I phoned up the Mom, her attitude was pretty much &quot;so what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hated to say no, in the sense that I know she&#39;ll just find somebody else,<br/>
and that&#39;s not really any better a situation.  At least here, I know that<br/>
I&#39;m not going to smack her and tell her to shut up, as several other folks<br/>
in this place are prone to doing.  So maybe here is better.<br/>
<br/>
But what do you do when you&#39;re the &quot;unknown&quot; caregiver?  Do you say<br/>
something to the parents?  How do I tactfully tell someone (with a history<br/>
of choosing to deal with other people&#39;s needs rather than her children&#39;s)<br/>
that she needs to put her kids higher up in her life?<br/>

<br/>
When she returns all dramatically exhausted from fixing the other person&#39;s <br/>
problems, maybe you could gaze steadily at her without wavering and when she <br/>
pauses say &quot;I wonder if her mother used to leave her to cry for hours instead of <br/>
paying attention to her when she was a little?  Maybe that&#39;s why her life is <br/>
so difficult today.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure you can tactfully tell her. And I&#39;m also not sure she would<br/>
listen. At least probably not hear what you are saying. You could really try<br/>
and possibly piss her off and never have to watch her kids again. Sounds<br/>
like you think maybe that&#39;s not a good thing either. You sound like you care<br/>
for her kids and would rather have them with you than who knows who else. If<br/>
that&#39;s the case, you can be a supportive and be a very positive influence on<br/>
those children. Possibly making a difference in their lives they will never<br/>
forget. That would be a very good thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve sort of hinted at it, and no, she doesn&#39;t hear me.  And Sandra&#39;s idea<br/>
would surely get her attention, but also probably piss her off quite a bit.<br/>
There&#39;s a political connnection with this person, militarily speaking, so I<br/>
can&#39;t really do that without my husband hearing about it, and then there&#39;d<br/>
be trouble.  Not from him to me, he&#39;d agree!  But between the guys.  And I<br/>
do try to behave myself, for his sake.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m leaving in a week for the rest of the summer, so maybe I&#39;ll just let it<br/>
be for awhile and see if anything good comes to me, or if anybody else has<br/>
any ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

needs brutal honesty to wake up, or some other brutal incident.  And that&#39;s not <br/>

<br/>
My sister just adopted twins after YEARS of infertility treatments.  She had <br/>
my 76 year old mother, who is a bit confused and not all that strong after <br/>
surgery to remove a heart tumor a year ago, babysit them when they were a week <br/>
old!  Now, my mother is not a stranger, but she is also not all that competant.  <br/>
My sister has had babysitters in and out so that she can work out.  She came <br/>
to my parents for the weekend where we had a family gathering and dumped the <br/>
twins, now 5 1/2 weeks old, while she and her husband went on a three hour bike <br/>
ride.  I can understand the need to exercise, truly I can.  But please!  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t leave my mom with two crying babies and made my kids wait to go to the <br/>
beach so that I could help her.  <br/>
<br/>
Pissed me off, but I&#39;ll probably never have the courage to say anything <br/>
either.  These poor babies sleep in another room because they make too much noise <br/>
for her to sleep!  Yikes.  It&#39;s just so far removed from my parenting <br/>
experience, I can&#39;t fathom.  And that&#39;s probably where you are coming from too.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had the courage for brutal honesty.  Maybe I&#39;ll grow into it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609826503">So there was a reason she couldn&#39;t have kids!!  Sometimes, just sometimes, Mother Nature does know better! I feel so sorry for those babies and for you. You know the reality and it could very well break your heart!<br/>
My blessings to you and yours,<br/>
