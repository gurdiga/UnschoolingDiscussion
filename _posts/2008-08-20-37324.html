I&#39;ve googled this a bit since it looks fun.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, it&#39;s called &quot;stop motion animation&quot;.  Google that to get<br/>
you started.<br/>

I found it interesting (weird) that the dad mentioned several times that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t recommend this for any other families.  Was it possibly just a need<br/>
for some kind of CYA on his part?  Or because he wasn&#39;t truly sold on the<br/>
idea?  And if he&#39;s saying that, it probably means the rest of their home<br/>
life didn&#39;t look very unschool-ish.  The book sounds fun though...I like<br/>
movies and discussions of movies.<br/>

whereas someone else might not be?  Shrug. I dunno. But it sounds <br/>
kind of like our life. LOL I am an armchair film critic and I talk <br/>
about movies all the time, how they&#39;re made and social context and <br/>
script flaws, etc. DD and I get into some pretty interesting <br/>
conversations, thanks to movies. :)<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I think her learning to read was greatly helped along by <br/>

<br/>
I imagine he thinks he&#39;s uniquely qualified, as a film critic and  <br/>
someone who has had a TV show, to discuss such things &quot;at a level&quot; to  <br/>
make it worthy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-The Film Club lasted a bit more than three years, until Jesse was  <br/>
19-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-And Jesse and Gilmour&#39;s current wife strike up their own chat club  <br/>
over cigarettes on the porch.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So his relationship with his dad is called &quot;the film club,&quot; and his  <br/>
relationship with his step mother is &quot;chat club&quot; (I know the reporter  <br/>
did that, but still...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;If he hadn&#39;t done something like that, he wouldn&#39;t have been my  <br/>
dad.-=-  I think it was brave and cool for them to do that, but on  <br/>
the other end he did GED and college (some college).<br/>
<br/>
His dad&#39;s a professor now.   And that (professorship) is the golden  <br/>
ticket of unschooling.  If either parent is a professor, everyone  <br/>
says &#39;Oh, well, okay then.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s still a pretty good story.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book called Cinema Nirvana that discusses movies in light  <br/>
of Buddhist precepts.  It&#39;s by Dean Sluyter, who wrote one of my  <br/>
favorite books ever, which has a super long name:   Why the Chicken  <br/>
Crossed the Road and other hidden enlightenment teachings from Buddha  <br/>
to Bebop to Mother Goose<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846512801">And for people who would like to do this on more of a shoestring, I have an<br/>
older Mac G4 Quicksilver with iMovie and it works fine.  I got the Mac<br/>
refurbished online for about $400.  There&#39;s lots of places selling refurb&#39;d<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279164639">If you have a Mac, you can use a free program we just discovered  <br/>
called FramebyFrame, made specifically for making stop-motion movies.  <br/>
 From their website: &quot;FrameByFrame lets you create stop-motion  <br/>
animation videos using any webcam/video camera connected to your Mac,  <br/>
including iSight. Just take some pictures and in a matter of seconds  <br/>
you‘ve got your very own stop-motion QuickTime movie!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We just downloaded it last week because my 6-year-old son wanted to  <br/>
make movies like he&#39;d seen on YouTube, and we&#39;ve made a couple of  <br/>
LEGO Star Wars movies with it and found it very easy (and fun) to use.<br/>

from many books about a father&#39;s relationship with a teenage son. He speaks about the <br/>
privelage of spending that time with his son and how lucky he felt. <br/>
<br/>
It was frustrating to me that the father always chose the movies, so it was not about <br/>
following Jesse&#39;s interests. Overall it is a fun, quick read, with a great list of film suggestions <br/>
for anyone.<br/>

Well now that &quot;Film Club&quot; is over, maybe the dad will be humble  <br/>
enough to watch some movies his son chooses that he/dad knows nothing  <br/>
about!<br/>
