<div id="ygrps-yiv-183806616">My 12yo bought a computer game (Morrowind), and the next day we found out<br/>
it&#39;s not compatible with our computer (laptop).  BestBuy says they won&#39;t<br/>

  Bethesda says no way will they take it back, you have to follow return<br/>

I&#39;ve been going in circles for three days with these two companies.<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205317289">Thanks, Laura D,<br/>
Good idea about e-bay.  It was 29.99, but my hackles go up when they say &quot;<br/>
no return under penalty of death&quot;.  Okay, not really, but they act like it.<br/>
It&#39;s compatible with desktops,  not laptops.   And needs Windows 98, but we<br/>
have that.<br/>
It&#39;s a role-playing game my son has been trying to find for a year.  He was<br/>
thrilled to finally find it.<br/>

Cheryl N, not so thrilled with BestBuy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077331345">I am assuming it is opened otherwise Best Buy would have to refund you<br/>
the money. I suggest selling it on eBay or trading it with another kid<br/>
for a compatible game. Or buy a shrink wrap kit and shrink wrap it and<br/>
regift it or donate it to a charity. You might could also locate a local<br/>
resale shop that deals with games and software and ee if they can resell<br/>
it there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206800305">Hey Cheryl,<br/>
<br/>
FYI, hubby the computer jock says that Morrowind requires 32bit color <br/>
hardware that most laptop graphic cards don&#39;t have particularly if they are <br/>
still operating on Windows 98.  And as the laptop graphic card is built-in, <br/>
it can&#39;t be upgraded unlike a desktop.  Too bad you don&#39;t have a desktop to <br/>
play it on.  My kids were absolutely obsessed with it for at least a <br/>
year.  The newer laptops, however might be able to accommodate this program.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone in your neighborhood have a desktop that your son could have <br/>
visiting privileges to?  I know that we accommodate at least three other <br/>
boys on a regular basis here!!<br/>

Thanks for the info.  So much to absorb!  Thank your husband, too. I&#39;ll know<br/>
what to look for when this computer finally dies and I get to go shopping!<br/>
