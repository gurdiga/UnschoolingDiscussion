 </span></blockquote>Dear Tanya,<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t trust you. I don&#39;t believe you will change her mind or her<br/>
attitude yourself by answering her direct questions, because she is really<br/>
asking you to change your mind about how you will educate the boy. She can&#39;t<br/>
imagine NOT having her grandson go to school.<br/>
<br/>
I think you will need to address the trust issue sooner or later, and sooner<br/>
is better since her insistence will only grow.<br/>
<br/>
Luz and I offer our webpage to help...we get lots of good feedback. If your<br/>
mother-in-law is at all receptive to reading about how children have<br/>
unschooled, give her the address:   www.borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>
<br/>
She might need some stronger words to tell her that the public schools are<br/>
not what she might believe they are. In that case, I&#39;ll be glad to send you<br/>
some of my (50+) articles in that subject.<br/>
<br/>
As for the others, maybe you will need to educate all of them. It can be<br/>
hard. I hope the children&#39;s father will help you. Do it one person at a<br/>
time...don&#39;t let them gang up on you, as a group.<br/>

Is that what we all should be doing.  Letting our friends and family <br/>
know what morons they are for having thier children in there? Or for <br/>
teaching in there?<br/>
I think the fact that we don&#39;t have our own children in there is <br/>
enough.  If I get asked direct questions, I answer them, but i also <br/>
try to be diplomatic.  <br/>
I could be a jerk and try to convert everyone to my way of thinking, <br/>
and probably lose all of my friends and bring strife between my <br/>
family, but I think I&#39;ll just smile and let them know how happy we <br/>
are, and that is enough of a push for unschooling, to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband is actually the strongest supporter of homeschooling (when we got <br/>
married a condition was that we&#39;d homeschool our children.)  How we do that <br/>
he says, is up to me because I&#39;m the one with the smarts (little does he <br/>
know:) )<br/>
<br/>
However, he won&#39;t outright defend us especially to his mother...that falls to <br/>
me.  <br/>
