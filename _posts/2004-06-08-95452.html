What are  some things you&#39;ve learned entirely outside of  school?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Dog training. First books, then through the Greater Columbia Obedience  <br/>
Club.I started training my first dog when I was 11. I started teaching classes  <br/>
when I was 16. When I lived in California and Germany, I got paid. When I  teach <br/>
for the club, I volunteer.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Dog grooming. I was living in Germany, and one of the women asked whether I  <br/>
knew of a good groomer that spoke some english. I went home and told Ben that <br/>
I  though *I* should start grooming. I did. Books and meeting <br/>
handlers/breeders and  picking their brains and trial and error. Then before I left Germany, I <br/>
 trained someone to take over my clientele. That happened again when I left <br/>
St  Louis, and again when I sold my mobile business here in Columbia five years <br/>
ago.  I&#39;ve netted as much as $50,000/year grooming. Yes, you can make a <br/>
living!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Gardening. If you had told me 20 years ago that I would have been a  <br/>
gardener, I would have laughed in your face! &lt;g&gt; No money there, but I  grow many of <br/>
our vegetables. fruits, and all our herbs and flowers. I gave a  <br/>
butterfly/hummingbird gardening class for our homeschool group the first  year. I&#39;m really <br/>
big on trial and error there! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Ceramic tiling. Kathryn&#39;s offered to pay me! &lt;G&gt; But I have done  other <br/>
people&#39;s bathrooms and kitchens as well as my own. Could I make a living?  <br/>
Possibly. Same with wallpapering.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Cooking. I&#39;ve sold desserts to restaurants. Not really a living, but extra  <br/>
$$$.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
More food: we (my family---dad and brother) opened a provincial french  <br/>
restaurant. I managed the front (waitstaff, bar, and dining room). Just dining  out <br/>
a lot, taking notes, working as a waitressand hostessing at other  <br/>
restaurants, and trying to treat the staff as I would like to have been  treated.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Horses. I&#39;ve taught lessons, ridden race horses, and opened a tack  shop.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Dogs, again----I&#39;m a junior showmanship judge. One of the girls I used  to <br/>
work with is a professional handler now. She&#39;s awesome.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
And the conference. Just throw me in, and I&#39;ll swim.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
How to be a great mom! &lt;G&gt; Thanks to the wonderful moms here and on  the <br/>
boards.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Can I toss something else out there?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Ben and I had a discusion last week about *why* I&#39;m so fearless when it  <br/>
comes to trying new things. He&#39;s rather timid, but trying to gain some insight  <br/>
into why.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Our conclusion (based entirely on our own personal histories) is that  you&#39;re <br/>
able to BE fearless when you are absolutely sure you have a fall-back  <br/>
position----a safety net, so to speak.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
My father was incredibly encouraging. And even if I failed, he would cover  <br/>
my butt. Not just big things---and not just little things. I always knew that I <br/>
 had a home to crawl back to or a money source when I was broke. He was  <br/>
ALWAYS there. Always.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Ben&#39;s family figures that, if you are an adult, you should just suck it up  <br/>
and fix the problem----they won&#39;t help. You made your bed; go lie in it. Better <br/>
 safe than sorry.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Quick example: We made a bad business decision (Ben tried to run a  <br/>
not-for-profit sports festival. Not-for-profit is JUST THAT!). Major financial  <br/>
set-back. Bankruptcy court. Ben asked his family for some money to buy groceries  and <br/>
to pay for electricity----his father said, &quot;Go get a job. You shouldn&#39;t have  <br/>
tried something so stupid. You&#39;re an adult. Act like it.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Needless to say, we&#39;ve never asked him for money since. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
My father, on the other hand, kept slipping me $100 bills. Offered to buy  <br/>
the boys clothes. Paid our mortgage, more than once. WAS Santa Claus that  <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I have no fears to try different things because I KNOW that, if I fail, I  <br/>
won&#39;t become a bag lady. I&#39;ve always had a life-line, a safety-net. I always  <br/>
felt that I could TRY anything. And I have! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Small successes as a child---and small failures, with that  life-line----have <br/>
taught me that I can do anything. (Daddy always told me THAT  too!)  I think <br/>
that, if our children know that we are  their safety-nets should anything go <br/>
bad, they will become more eager  to attempt what others think is impossible!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure parenting has something to do with encouraging or <br/>
discouraging natural fearlessness, but I also think that a whole lot <br/>
of it is just inherent personality. My two kids are like night and <br/>
day in this regard. One total risk-taker, one very cautious kid. Both <br/>
have had respectful parenting and unschooling from the start.<br/>
<br/>
As for me, my parents weren&#39;t particularly supportive of most of my <br/>
endeavors, but I&#39;m a whole lot like my daughter - fearless and bull-<br/>
headed. When my parents wouldn&#39;t support what I was doing, I left. <br/>
When I ran out of money, I lived on the streets. I don&#39;t think it had <br/>
all that much to do with what my parents did or didn&#39;t do, more or <br/>
less what I was born with. <br/>
<br/>
As far as encouraging or discouraging goes, I think that can <br/>
definitely make a difference with kids who are by nature more <br/>
cautious. I think if my son ends up taking risks it will most likely <br/>
be because we have stood by him while he tried the waters, didn&#39;t <br/>
force him to do things he didn&#39;t want to do, but gently encouraged <br/>
him. For instance, he didn&#39;t want to go in water until he was almost <br/>
five. I think if we had pushed something like swimming lessons on <br/>
him, we could&#39;ve really freaked him out about it and had him <br/>
associating water with panic. I&#39;ve worked with adults who have that <br/>
water-panic connection and it&#39;s hard to get past. But because we let <br/>
him come to it in his own time and his own way, he was able to do it <br/>
cautiously enough to suit him. Supporting the non-risk taker allows <br/>
them to find their way to being more adventurous. Of course, my <br/>
daughter was flinging herself into the deep end of swimming pools <br/>
long before she could swim. For her, support means finding ways for <br/>
her to do things safely that she would go ahead and do anyways.<br/>

they need to go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or if you have nothing to lose.<br/>
<br/>
I always have an easy time making major changes, major decisions - <br/>
taking risks - because I somehow have this STRONG sense that I can <br/>
always just start over if I blow it. That either runs in my family, <br/>
temperamentally, or I learned it from seeing my grandparents make major <br/>
major changes in their lives in their 40&#39;s and again in their 60&#39;s and <br/>
my mother change careers at 40 and my uncle change careers at 50 and <br/>
both of my sisters start up whole new careers in their 40&#39;s. In my <br/>
family, nobody has EVER finally decided what they&#39;re going to be when <br/>
they grow up. It is always something that can change.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I have an &quot;acceptance&quot; that there are risks and costs to every <br/>
decision - and if you don&#39;t just accept the risks and costs and take <br/>
action anyway, you&#39;re stuck. I fear being &quot;stuck&quot; far more than I fear <br/>
failure.<br/>

What are some things you&#39;ve learned entirely outside of school?<br/>
After 40 hours of instruction, required for the obtaining the license, I have <br/>
learned to sell real estate ..... 6 million dollars worth of real estate a <br/>
year.  Never in a zillion years did I ever think I could do something like that, <br/>
but I just &quot;did it&quot;.  (Think NIKE).<br/>
<br/>
I remember coming out of high school and being so disillusioned with the <br/>
whole experience that I never wanted to go to college - so I didn&#39;t.  Then I <br/>
wondered what kind of career I&#39;d end up with.<br/>
<br/>
Dh learned how to build houses and develop raw land.  He is now a real estate <br/>
developer and general contractor.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve both learned many, many other things... but since those are the ones <br/>
that put food on the table and bring us both a great deal of personal <br/>
satisfaction to boot, we rank them rather highly.<br/>

  And I should add that not only are these learned outside of school but I don&#39;t think any of it involved classes. Laying baseboard for instance meant fooling around with a mitre box until I got it right (and I must say, it looks better than most jobs). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038025919">You&#39;re right, Dawn, about history and politics being things to learn out of school.  Nothing I learned in high school of history, social studies or politics was valuable to me (and I took &#39;honors&#39; humanities and World Lit).  I&#39;ve learned so much more history -- Japanese-American Internment, American wartime activities, and present-day politics -- outside of school.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064271156">Neat discussion.  My list won&#39;t be exhaustive.  lol.<br/>
<br/>
I learned how to read at home.<br/>
<br/>
All the math in elementary school I&#39;d say it&#39;s safe to say I <br/>
actually learned at home.  In fact, nearly everything in elementary <br/>
school.  I&#39;d spend all day in school in a whirlwind of confusion - I <br/>
never knew what was going on!  So many kids, so much &quot;noise&quot;.  I <br/>
never understood what the teachers were saying.  Truly, very like <br/>
charlie brown&#39;s teacher... I&#39;d go home at the end of the day with my <br/>
homework at which point my dad would &quot;teach&quot; me what in the world we <br/>
had covered that day in class.<br/>
<br/>
I remember intentionally getting in trouble repeatedly so I&#39;d have <br/>
to spend recess in the library instead of outside.  I preferred the <br/>
peace, quiet and books.  They never caught on til my dad pointed it <br/>
out to the teacher when they called him in for a conference to <br/>
discuss my learning problems and my inability to stay out of <br/>
trouble.  He apologized later for ruining my scam.  hehe.  <br/>
<br/>
Oops... I went off on a tangent.  Maybe another thread, I can tell <br/>
you what I did learn in school.  lol.  Not academics, that&#39;s for <br/>
sure.<br/>
<br/>
Not in school, I also learned:<br/>
<br/>
crochet<br/>
sewing<br/>
cooking<br/>
mothering<br/>
wife-ing<br/>
anything connected with computers<br/>
graphic design<br/>
HTML - which paid the bills for a few years.<br/>
Exept typing, pretty much everything I&#39;ve ever used to earn a buck <br/>
or manage my life I learned outside of school.  Even writing - <br/>
learned that from my dad as well - with some help later from my <br/>
uncle who was a writer.  Still learning the writing.  <br/>
