&gt; Your last sentence was and is a backhanded way of calling someone a liar and<br/>
&gt; based on what? Nothing except that you don&#39;t like the way you perceive her<br/>
&gt; to be living her life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t necessarily about lying. Lots of people believe lots of things, and<br/>
believe them sincerely and completely, that are not true.<br/>
<br/>
My sister in law believed the school therapist and the tame doctor on call<br/>
when they told her her son was ADD and &quot;needed&quot; to be medicated. Many, many,<br/>
MANY people whose kids are on Ritalin believe the same. They are completely<br/>
honest, but often (perhaps even mostly) mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
Tons of people honestly believe their children must go to school or they<br/>
will not learn. Tons of homeschoolers believe that you must use a curriculum<br/>
or your children will not learn. Tons of homeschoolers believe that<br/>
unschooling is nothing more than educational neglect.<br/>
<br/>
Belief does not necessarily make things so.<br/>

<br/>
And they believe they are thinking for themselves.<br/>
And they believe they know their child better than anyone.<br/>

And until someone on some list somewhere says WHAT!? some of them don&#39;t <br/>
question the path they&#39;ve (freely?) chosen.<br/>
