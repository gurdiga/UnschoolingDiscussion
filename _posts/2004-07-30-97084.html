<div id="ygrps-yiv-78683460">Hello,<br/>
 <br/>
I have a five-year-old son who&#39;s very intelligent and creative.  He seems like a very typical five-year-old.  I took him to see a specialist for his potty training issues and she did an intake of his developmental progress.  She suggested that I take him for O.T.  because he still couldn&#39;t hold a pencil correctly, spell his name, or draw stick figures with arms and legs.  Having the unschooling beliefs that I do, I wonder if I should even worry about it.  Every child develops differently.  <br/>
 <br/>
My question is should I bother with the O.T. now or just try to work on the writing issue with him myself?  Does anyone have ideas on how I could assist him on developing his penmanship skills?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Leslie<br/>

these individuals? If it was fun and he wants to participate, why <br/>

<br/>
You should leave him alone.  Lots and lots of 5yo boys have difficulty<br/>
holding a pencil....Check and see if he hasn&#39;t improved by the time he is<br/>

What has helped develop Jesse&#39;s fine motor skills is Lego. He plays with it<br/>
for hours every day. I&#39;d just provide lots of opportunities for play with<br/>
blocks and drawing and sorting beans or counters.Fun stuff! I saw these cool<br/>
brightly coloured dinosaur counters in a catalogue last week. My boys would<br/>
love them. Making  collage pictures out of beans, seeds and lentils. (if<br/>
that&#39;s the sort of thing he likes to do) Making necklaces from macaroni or<br/>
threading with cotton spools. There are lots of  &#39;exercises&#39; you can do that<br/>
are fun.<br/>

<br/>
And probably the same kinds that the occupational therapists would have <br/>
charged you or the insurance company or the government huge bucks to do with him. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only &quot;occupational therapy&quot; to help a young child  hold a<br/>
<br/>
pencil correctly, spell his name, or draw stick figures with arms and<br/>
<br/>
legs if the child&#39;s intended occupation is to be a school student at grade <br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are occupied in other ways.  Our &quot;occupational therapy&quot; sometimes <br/>
is recovery from school!!   &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048043236">Hi Leslie,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what kind of specialist you took your son to, but you <br/>
didn&#39;t mention any concerns about his fine motor or writing skills <br/>
before her &quot;assessment&quot;. If he is not bothered by any difficulties <br/>
with fine motor activities, leave it alone. If he is struggling, <br/>
strew more manipulative activities for him at home, and maybe let him <br/>
see how you manipulate small things with your hands. Let him see you <br/>
participating in the fine motor activities you enjoy, and let him see <br/>
you struggle with them too, and keep going.<br/>
<br/>
Just for clarification, occupational therapists do not only work at <br/>
helping others function in their &quot;occupations&quot;. Ideally, they use <br/>
goal directed activities,or &quot;occupations&quot; that are meaningful to the <br/>
person to maximize functional independence in all their chosen life <br/>
roles. They started working with war veterans as &quot;restoration&quot; <br/>
therapists, helping victims who were unable to return to previous <br/>
work find independence and meaning in what abilities they still had.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am an O.T. and an unschooler. I think much of the theory <br/>
behind O.T. is compatible with unschooling, especially in the area of <br/>
instrinsic motivation and self-direction being critical to any <br/>
successful outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to go on so long, but I just wanted to say, don&#39;t go looking <br/>
for problems. Your son will let you know what is a problem for him, <br/>
not some specialist. Then you can decide what to do about it, if <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>

==========<br/>
<br/>
I know.<br/>
But a six year old is only &quot;behind&quot; in holding a pencil if he&#39;s in a <br/>
situation in which pencil-holding is required and evaluated.<br/>
<br/>
And a six year old&#39;s functional independence in his life role (not chosen, <br/>
probably, at six) probably doesn&#39;t require fine-motor therapy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-goal directed activities,or &quot;occupations&quot;. . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
A goal-directed activity isn&#39;t &quot;an occupation.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s a project, or an activity (there it is) or a task.<br/>
If occupational therapy has redefined &quot;occupation&quot; in their own way, add that <br/>
to the irritating jargon that those learning in real-life ways shouldn&#39;t need <br/>
to occupy themselves with. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
