Unschooling and unjobbing, in a sense, are about deciding how to spend<br/>

I do too! I am enjoying the discussion on this list. It helps to give words <br/>
and form to my ideas. Thanks all!<br/>

school at home approaches - I feel this excitement and I value the<br/>
important thing of the day.  I&#39;m tired of living for tomorrow while today<br/>
slips away.  We have no guarantees of tomorrow anyway.<br/>

deeper connection and wondering how to get there.  It&#39;s hard too, when you<br/>
are surrounded by people who don&#39;t have a clue and don&#39;t want to change, who<br/>
fear most everything.<br/>

We&#39;re working hard at shedding and simplifying.  Even my chidren are in a<br/>
clean out the closet mode. Wonder if it&#39;s just winter coming on?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been this way all of my life.  I can&#39;t stand clutter.  Maybe that is<br/>
why I was able to find my own way to unschooling naturally as a teenager,<br/>
despite so much opposition and conditioning.  (Of course I did not know I<br/>
was Unschooling, I just thought I was being a bad kid and a failure, as<br/>
usual.)  I used to periodically &quot;clean out&quot; my bedroom when I was still<br/>
living with my parents, and since I was not allowed to throw things out I<br/>
would make a pile of &quot;useless&quot; and redundant items in the hallway for my<br/>
mother to throw out or keep as she wanted.  Once, I even put my closet door<br/>
in the hallway pile, as it was getting in my way, and then I saved space in<br/>
my bedroom by putting my turntable and records in the closet and running<br/>
the speaker wire out into the room.<br/>
<br/>
I also was in the habit of giving things away to friends who made comments<br/>
admiring them.  Everything from bric-a-brac, to my clothes, to a pillow off<br/>
my bed once!  They were all items I did not need, and they did not have an<br/>
emotional signifigance for me.  I also still will give gifts (Birthday,<br/>
holidays) to people from my own pool of redundant miscelaneous.  However,<br/>
these days I do not have nearly as much miscelaneous items to give away.<br/>
My parents, particularly my mother, showed their affection by giving me<br/>
gifts.  Some of the things I could not get rid of fast enough, as they<br/>
represented times when even they, in their closed little short sighted<br/>
world, could see that they should have been there for me or had pushed me<br/>
into performing something that was extremely damaging for me.  So they<br/>
would give me a gift, and call it good.<br/>
