<div id="ygrps-yiv-82532824"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So, please explain where I go from here. I&#39;m feeling like backing off<br/>
&gt; and letting him do whatever he chooses for a while. I&#39;ve tried it,<br/>
&gt; but then I start feeling like he needs to learn, or should I say, do<br/>
&gt; academics. My husband&#39;s attitude about that may tend to sway me in<br/>
&gt; that direction more than I tend to want to go. My son is intelligent,<br/>
&gt; has big ideas, but has trouble implementing. I think in time,<br/>
&gt; however, he will do great things so I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m concerned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what you describe here....the wanting to back off,  but fearing your<br/>
son will learn nothing.....is *the* main struggle for parents in<br/>
unschooling,  especially at the beginning.  I would suggest you breathe<br/>
deeply, examine your fears,  and try to let them go.  In addition,  read<br/>
about natural learning (unschooling.com,  John Holt) and think about your<br/>
own *best* learning experiences.<br/>
<br/>
This is a journey.  Maybe you will start down a path and re-direct<br/>
yourself...that&#39;s great...you&#39;re also learning all the time.  Be an example.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782046944">Hey Tia,<br/>
I&#39;ve probably delted the earlier message ...having a hard time keeping up<br/>
here due to chaos on the home front!  We were on the subject of late<br/>
readers.<br/>
    I feel a &quot;spell&quot; coming on with being frustrated with 10yo dd&#39;s<br/>
inability to read.  With four youngsters vying for my attentions,  I&#39;m not<br/>
always able to read over her shoulder so she can do things she wants to do.<br/>
For example,  she wanted to load a new computer game....I was nursing the<br/>
baby.  A window came up and she wanted to know what to do.  I couldn&#39;t help<br/>
her because I couldn&#39;t read the screen.  This causes me to wonder if I&#39;m<br/>
capable of giving her what she needs in this direction.  My attention is<br/>
often quite divide.  Following through on what she wants to do/explore is<br/>
difficult with balancing everyone&#39;s needs.  It is especially worse when I&#39;m<br/>
out-of-synch and sleep deprived as of late.<br/>
    I&#39;m in no way questioning unschooling and appreciate your tale of<br/>
regretting sort of forcing the issue when your son was 12.  I really don&#39;t<br/>
understand why she doesn&#39;t *want* to read.  Maybe it&#39;s a dependence issue?<br/>
(Maybe that&#39;s just mommy guilt for having worked FT when she was a baby)<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s something I can&#39;t see that hinders her ability.  One mom at a<br/>
homeschooling program we attend thinks it&#39;s a &quot;processing&quot; issue since her<br/>
comprehension skills are clearly evident (but she&#39;s a school-at-homer).   I<br/>
find myself trying hard to not be sarcastic with her when I&#39;m totally<br/>
frustrated....somehow I&#39;m sure sarcasm doesn&#39;t help!<br/>
    I thinkher inability to read hinders her...in her areas of interest,<br/>
she could develop more if she could read. (I.E.,  she loves logic puzzles<br/>
etc.  She gets Mathmania. and does great,   but needs me to read the<br/>
instuctions for most of it.)<br/>
Susan....frustrated and hoping to weather the storm in my dd&#39;s best<br/>
interest!<br/>

&gt; Hi Debbie,<br/>
&gt; My oldest dd is 15 and imo it&#39;s harder for the teens to get together.<br/>
&gt; In our case, dd has met friends through her dance and gymnastics<br/>
&gt; classes. Also, the internet happens to be a &#39;hangout&#39; for kids that I<br/>
&gt; know. They create these elaborate webpages and other kids surf in on<br/>
&gt; them (I can&#39;t quite grasp how they network but anyway...). While I<br/>
&gt; advocate safety for teens on the net and using extreme caution, dd<br/>
&gt; has met some nice friends (but not IRL ones) this way.<br/>
&gt; Once your son finds outside interest that school would have otherwise<br/>
&gt; prevented him from doing or attending, he&#39;ll probably meet other guys<br/>
&gt; who have similar interests. Perhaps he&#39;ll meet a mentor-type person<br/>
&gt; who&#39;s not the same age but it won&#39;t matter!<br/>
&gt; I won&#39;t say that the social life of a hsed kid is the same as a ps<br/>
&gt; kid.... the kids I know are vastly different. Having said that, I<br/>
&gt; think the hs situation is preferable over the other one because the<br/>
&gt; kids are able to effectively communicate with a wide range of ages.<br/>
&gt; AND, best of all, they learn to feel comfortable with themselves..<br/>
&gt; all alone, doing solitary activities and not feeling dependent on<br/>
&gt; someone else.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry if it was me that seemed to ridicule you.  I never intentionally<br/>
&gt; mean to do that.  When I post, it&#39;s usually just to share my experiences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure that either Tia, Sarah Carothers, Lovemary or Kolleen will be<br/>
&gt; more help to you than I can be, but I&#39;ll try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First of all, have you read the standard unschooling books by John Holt,<br/>
&gt; Grace Llewellyn, etc.?  If you haven&#39;t, you should do so.  Also,<br/>
&gt; understand what &quot;deschooling&quot; is.  I understand it requires an awful lot<br/>
&gt; of patience and a lot of time.  It depends on the child, but deschooling<br/>
&gt; can take years.  Remember he has been in school for close to 10 years,<br/>
&gt; constantly being told what to do, when to do it, how to do it, how much<br/>
&gt; time he has to do it in, and, even, with whom to do it.  He&#39;s not used<br/>
&gt; to self-initiating those types of activities which most people would<br/>
&gt; consider to be learning activities.  He has been taught for many years<br/>
&gt; that learning is WORK and that it is unpleasant because it has been<br/>
&gt; forced upon him.  So, it&#39;s only natural he would have an aversion to<br/>
&gt; activities that many would consider educational.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is all about respecting your child&#39;s choices and trusting<br/>
&gt; the fact that he will learn, on his own, what is best for him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Didn&#39;t you say that your son was into computer programming?  Well, let<br/>
&gt; him do that - all day long, all year long, if that&#39;s what he wants to<br/>
&gt; do.  He can learn an awful lot from that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is what unschooling is to me:  I basically leave my kids alone and<br/>
&gt; let them do what they want to do.  I rarely tell them to do anything<br/>
&gt; (unless it has to do with their physical health, which is a big factor<br/>
&gt; with my kids).  I consciously try to involve myself in as many active<br/>
&gt; (not passive) activities as possible.  I am modeling for my kids.  I<br/>
&gt; hope they join me, and they often do.  I answer all their questions (and<br/>
&gt; there are very many of them), which often lead into pretty deep<br/>
&gt; discussions (these are definitely learning moments).  I find the long<br/>
&gt; and more interesting discussions are in the car, where they are captive<br/>
&gt; and have few distractions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will now go through your post and interject my thoughts.  Please don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think I am being critical or I am ridiculing you.  I&#39;m just giving you<br/>
&gt; my ideas and am trying to help in the best way that I can.  If we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; answer your questions, then you must keep asking and maybe be more<br/>
&gt; specific, or word your question in another way.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Get a Life. I feel so far that what I am reading feels more like my<br/>
&gt; &gt; style, but it&#39;s so unnatural for me since it&#39;s not the way I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; raised.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++=<br/>
&gt; I wasn&#39;t raised this way either.  I read &quot;Learning all the Time&quot; by John<br/>
&gt; Holt and it really changed the way I looked at how children learn.  Read<br/>
&gt; that book if you haven&#39;t yet.  Also read Alice Miller&#39;s &quot;Thou Shall Not<br/>
&gt; Be Aware&quot; (I think that&#39;s the title - it&#39;s been a few years since I read<br/>
&gt; it).  Sorry if this sounds maudlin, but I have many faults and have had<br/>
&gt; many failures.  I have analyzed them and tried to figure out where they<br/>
&gt; came from and how they came about.  Of course, it all stems from my<br/>
&gt; childhood and my mother&#39;s parenting style which was almost the exact<br/>
&gt; opposite of unschooling.  I consider unschooling to be more of a style<br/>
&gt; of parenting (or lifestyle) than purely a method of educating my<br/>
&gt; children.  Unschooling encourages a child to grow up to be a happy,<br/>
&gt; self-confident, auto-didactic, self-regulating, self-entertaining,<br/>
&gt; curious and  a self-assured person.  If a person is lucky enough to have<br/>
&gt; some or all of those traits then that person&#39;s education will be a<br/>
&gt; natural and painless part of his/her life and s/he will be learning all<br/>
&gt; the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, I have looked at the way I was raised and determined what was done<br/>
&gt; wrong and have chosen to raise my children in a different way which<br/>
&gt; happens to be unschooling.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++=<br/>
&gt; &gt;  My son didn&#39;t do well with the traditional school setting,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I think the best thing I can do for him is to try to offer him<br/>
&gt; &gt; some alternatives until we find one that works for him and makes him<br/>
&gt; &gt; happy. Since quitting school in April, I am wondering if he needs<br/>
&gt; &gt; more time to deschool because academics is just not setting well with<br/>
&gt; &gt; him at all.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s not even nine months.  I would probably wait at least another<br/>
&gt; year before I would even think about introducing academics to him again,<br/>
&gt; if ever.  Deschooling can take a long time and requires a lot of<br/>
&gt; patience on your part.  You have to totally change your ideas of what<br/>
&gt; learning really is and how it happens.   Personally, I don&#39;t think that<br/>
&gt; academics are that important yet at age 14.  He has his whole life ahead<br/>
&gt; of him to learn those things, if he wishes.<br/>
&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; &gt; He has just been diagnosed with ADD-inattentive type, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know that hasn&#39;t helped his self-esteem, and he says he can&#39;t pick<br/>
&gt; &gt; up a book because he can&#39;t retain anything he reads. That is so<br/>
&gt; &gt; different for him, because he always used to love reading.<br/>
&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; Is he referring to textbook reading or reading for pleasure?   Can he<br/>
&gt; read some entertaining fiction?  Perhaps you can introduce him to some<br/>
&gt; books about subjects he has an interest in, like computer programming,<br/>
&gt; sports (if that&#39;s what he&#39;s into), etc.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What I would love is encouragement, advice on unschooling, and please<br/>
&gt; &gt; no ridiculing because it&#39;s not as easy for me to just jump in like<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of the rest of you who have done it for so long.<br/>
&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; I encourage you to read the unschooling books as well as past issues of<br/>
&gt; &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot;.  I learned a lot from them.  Also, see if<br/>
&gt; you can make friends with another family that is unschooling and spend<br/>
&gt; time with them and learn from them.  This is what I have done.  I also<br/>
&gt; hope you stay with this list.  Read the posts and ask as many questions<br/>
&gt; as you need to.  I think its wonderful you are considering unschooling<br/>
&gt; for your son.  All children should be so lucky.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I really admire<br/>
&gt; &gt; this way of learning instead of having everything shoved down their<br/>
&gt; &gt; throats. I grew up thinking we had to be pushed all the time and<br/>
&gt; &gt; never had the opportunity to just sit back and make the decision on<br/>
&gt; &gt; my own to learn when I wanted to.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; Yes!  And, not only when you wanted to but also what you wanted to.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; &gt; Therefore, it makes me think that<br/>
&gt; &gt; most children need a little bit of a constant push to continue acting<br/>
&gt; &gt; responsibly, which means doing homework, etc. I thought this was part<br/>
&gt; &gt; of being a parent and guiding your children to become well behaved,<br/>
&gt; &gt; responsible adults.<br/>
&gt; &gt; ++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; I think a child can learn about responsibility from watching the parents<br/>
&gt; do responsible things.  It&#39;s all about modeling.  Kids learn a lot from<br/>
&gt; that.  They don&#39;t have to be taught.  They just have to see you do it.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, please explain where I go from here. I&#39;m feeling like backing off<br/>
&gt; &gt; and letting him do whatever he chooses for a while.<br/>
&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; I think that is exactly what you should do.  Try and relax (I know it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; hard).  Just let him hang out and have fun.  Let him do his computer<br/>
&gt; programming.  I don&#39;t know what your relationship is like with him, but<br/>
&gt; do you think you two could do stuff together like go camping or do some<br/>
&gt; traveling together.  I would spend lots of time with him and maybe see<br/>
&gt; if you can strengthen your relationship.  Just have lots of fun with him<br/>
&gt; and FORGET school and academics.  Concentrate on being HAPPY!!!<br/>
&gt; ++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I&#39;ve tried it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but then I start feeling like he needs to learn, or should I say, do<br/>
&gt; &gt; academics. My husband&#39;s attitude about that may tend to sway me in<br/>
&gt; &gt; that direction more than I tend to want to go. My son is intelligent,<br/>
&gt; &gt; has big ideas, but has trouble implementing.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; He has big ideas!!!  That&#39;s great!!  I wish I had any ideas at all when<br/>
&gt; I was 14.  If he has big ideas then he has goals.  He has something in<br/>
&gt; mind that he wants to accomplish.  I would love to know what his goals<br/>
&gt; are.  I hope you share them with us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Think back to all the courses you took in high school and all those<br/>
&gt; hours you spent in the classroom and all that homework you did.  Do you<br/>
&gt; remember much of it?  Do you really feel that it was all that<br/>
&gt; important?  I&#39;m sure there were a few things that may have been<br/>
&gt; worthwhile, but you probably could have learned it on your own in a<br/>
&gt; fraction of the time it took you to have it forced into you by the<br/>
&gt; school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suggest you think happy and positive thoughts and think about how<br/>
&gt; lucky your son is that he doesn&#39;t have to waste his time in a school.<br/>
&gt; Think about how lucky you are to have him around all day.  How you can<br/>
&gt; enjoy each other&#39;s company, etc.  Join homeschooling groups in your area<br/>
&gt; and introduce him to new people.  Give him the opportunity to make new<br/>
&gt; friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With regard to your husband, I have the same problem.  I suggest you try<br/>
&gt; and educate him as best you can about unschooling.  Get a hold of old<br/>
&gt; &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; magazines, read them and share the articles<br/>
&gt; with him.  Have them in the bathroom, so he can read them there too.  My<br/>
&gt; husband has come a long way, but we still have to compromise.  My boys<br/>
&gt; and I have come out on top though.<br/>
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I think in time,<br/>
&gt; &gt; however, he will do great things so I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m concerned.<br/>
&gt; &gt; +++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s lucky to have a mother with so much confidence in him.  Just keep<br/>
&gt; thinking that way and try to relax.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope I have helped a little bit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope you stay on this list.  Ask for support and information.  This<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, Susan, I can certainly relate to your frustration. I&#39;ve been <br/>
trying to be patient with my youngest son, Michael, who still isn&#39;t <br/>
showing much interest in reading at the grand old age of - brace <br/>
yourselves, dear readers - 16 next week. No, that&#39;s not a slip of the <br/>
keys...<br/>
<br/>
This kid lives to snowboard - and not much else. As I&#39;m writing this <br/>
he, his cousin, and his best buddy are stalking around the house <br/>
barefooted but with their full snowboarding regalia dropped down <br/>
around their waists - they&#39;ve taken a pizza break from hitting jumps <br/>
down in the creek...<br/>
<br/>
I try not to be concerned, as his three older brothers all went <br/>
through the same thing, and all are excellent readers now, but the <br/>
worst (?) of them was reading by the time he was 14 (and I thought <br/>
that was unheard of...). This kid&#39;s two years behind the mark and <br/>
going for some kind of record!<br/>
