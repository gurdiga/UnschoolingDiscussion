<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205196136">We don&#39;t have assigned chores. And Julian is a 14 year old boy who is pretty <br/>
oblivious to mess. Rarely does it occur to him to just start cleaning. <br/>
<br/>
However, if I ask him to do something, he is willing and happy to help out. <br/>
He often does most of the family laundry, he&#39;ll clean litter boxes, empty or <br/>
fill the dishwasher, straighten up a room...whatever. When there&#39;s a big job <br/>
that we&#39;d gladly pay an outside party to do if we had someone available, we offer <br/>
to pay Julian (Cleaning the garage gutters comes to mind). Sometimes he tells <br/>
us not to bother; he&#39;s happy to do it for free.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m careful to respect his time when I ask. And I try not to ask him to do <br/>
stuff I know he hates. (when I do, it&#39;s for an important reason, and he knows <br/>
that, and is happy to do it.)<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s mutual. Julian knows he can ask us to do stuff too, and is <br/>
respectful of our time and activities and tries not to ask us to do stuff we hate. <br/>
That&#39;s the advantage of the one kid/three parent ratio...you can usually find a <br/>
willing adult.<br/>
