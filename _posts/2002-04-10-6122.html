<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114300197">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share what our local support group has done and is currently <br/>
doing. We have produced several shows backyard style with the stage being a <br/>
porch complete with potluck afterwards. The kids made the sets, props, <br/>
costumes. One mom, Sue are you reading, directed in the sense that she <br/>
openned her house, moved the kids through rehersals and made sure all the <br/>
loose ends were tied. Now another mom is directing because Sue left us for <br/>
Texas. Some older kids do backstage work, make programs, run music, help <br/>
with costume changes. Our shows are great fun and the kids do everything. A <br/>
very positive experience, without a big boss directing. Also, the amount of <br/>
time the directors put in seems reasonable and they can reach out to any <br/>
parents for help. Generally 10 or so families participate. I&#39;d say if you <br/>
have the energy, go for kid produced shows. We take about 4-6 weeks to <br/>
reherse, then perform for families and friends. We have charged $5 per kid <br/>
for tapes and scripts. This next show we rented a local business which <br/>
musicians perform at, so the cost is up to $20.00 per kid to cover the <br/>
rental. We will not charge for tickets this time. We will have a &quot;real&quot; <br/>
stage, and seating. We will have a spontaneous talent show following to get <br/>
the full use of the facility.<br/>
<br/>
On the other side, our local community theater does very professional shows, <br/>
but some families find the environment too stressful. Long hours of practice <br/>
late into the night, rigerous rehersal schedules,have to attend all <br/>
practices and shows. Great shows. Different goals.<br/>
<br/>
Mary<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we live in the city limits so roosters are out for coon protection. A <br/>
good idea, though.  I recall how tough those guys can be from my chicken <br/>
farming days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42574809">Our support group does backyard-style productions, too, about once a year, usually at the end of the &quot;school year&quot; (May). <br/>
One or two of the moms has quite a bit of experience with productions of this sort, and their input and influence is greatly appreciated. <br/>
The kids and moms make all the costumes, set designs and props. The performances are held at people&#39;s houses. Once the kids even performed a puppet show for a preschool at Christmas-time. They were SO proud of themselves!<br/>
<br/>
This year the kids will be performing 3 plays or &quot;tales&quot; scripted from The Canterbury Tales and also performing The Reluctant Dragon.<br/>
It should be lots of fun, but we&#39;re already approaching mid-April and it&#39;s getting to be crunch time soon! Lots of rehearsals and practices. The kids have so much fun doing these performances, though, so it&#39;s worth it. It&#39;s great to record on video, too, and watch it years later.<br/>
Tomorrow we&#39;re also going to see The Reluctant Dragon peformed by our local theater company - Childsplay. They usually put on a great performance and give us great inspiration for our own little shows.<br/>
