<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151924389">Hi all.<br/>
&lt;&lt; As far as the pencil &quot;grip&quot;, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it.  <br/>
 I have always held my pencil incorrectly (resting on my ring finger instead <br/>
 of my middle finger), and have suffered no consequences other than mildly <br/>
 sloppy handwriting.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Given this thread - does any one have advise about how to teach a left handed <br/>
child to write with their left hand?  I am hopelessly right handed, and she <br/>
has some difficulty forming letters - which she REALLY wants to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks -<br/>

  My dh and i are both lefties and our girls are both right handed. I<br/>
honestly don&#39;t remember teaching either of then to write--they learned. I<br/>
think we got wipe-off boards for them with ways to practice. We always<br/>
emphasized that there is no one right way to write (no pun intended).  They<br/>
just practicedby writing their names on everything, writing letter to<br/>
people(so they&#39;d get mail).  We did get italic writing books for them--to<br/>
this day the books sit on the shelf--because not only is it beautiful, but<br/>
it&#39;s supposed to be an easier bridge to cursive.<br/>
My oldest found it frustrating--she tends to be perfectionistic and had<br/>
trouble getting the angles just right.<br/>
 Just my 2 cents<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34073217">Face to face or sit in front a vanity mirror and have the kidlet watch you<br/>
in the mirror.  I have 3 lefties and one ambi and am ambi myself.  My<br/>
mother was a lefty and she used the mirror trick.  The sitting next to or<br/>
over the shoulder thing doesn&#39;t work in the right to left world.<br/>
