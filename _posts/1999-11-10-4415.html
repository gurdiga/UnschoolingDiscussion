My step-sons are fascinated with the fact that I unschool Terry and <br/>
Lapis.  The day will come that they will be living with us and they <br/>
say they want to be unschooled too.  The problem is they have NO <br/>
social skills (their current living situation has them ashamed to <br/>
have friends over and the friends they do have they fight with <br/>
sometimes because of their situation and basically has them <br/>
social hermits).  They also say that they don&#39;t like school because <br/>
it is boring and they are always WAY ahead of the other students.<br/>
<br/>
It took them a minute to realize that they are schooled over here <br/>
every waking minute.  They are here every other week (about) and <br/>
we glean lessons from everything.  We have gotten moral lessons <br/>
from every movie we have seen (from Queen to the Aliens movies).  <br/>
Because of their mothers racism and religious intolerance, they <br/>
keep many of their lessons under a bushel (they refused to say <br/>
what they did the weekends we watched X and the weekend we <br/>
watched Roots).<br/>
<br/>
What I want to know is do they need a good enough reason to be <br/>
homeschooled by me?  Their mother would like nothing more than <br/>
to see them have trouble getting to college because they were <br/>
homeschooled.  I was thinking I would homeschool them until HS <br/>
age and then send them to the local HS.  Then when they are here <br/>
they won&#39;t have the problem inviting friends over for snacks, dinner, <br/>
overnight, etc that they do living with their mom (except here they <br/>
have the annoying brother and sister -- they just don&#39;t think of Terry <br/>
and Lapis as annoying -- yet &lt;VEG&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do.  HELP!!<br/>
