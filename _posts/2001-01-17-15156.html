<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192916839">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still in the early days of unschooling. My son is three and a half.<br/>
Inspired by The Unschooling Handbook i&#39;ve spent some time recording some of<br/>
his learning and I&#39;m amazed at just how much learning takes place every day.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning we spent time building towers with food tins - due to the<br/>
lack of blocks - and we learned about big and small, stabilizers, we counted<br/>
the tins, we created some cities, discovered that smaller tins to best on<br/>
top, talked about the veggies inside and read the  labels.<br/>
<br/>
So I really do not have any doubts as far as the academics go, but I do<br/>
wonder about the social development. Although I think being home would be<br/>
perfect for my child&#39;s temperament I do often get counter arguments from<br/>
other people. They argue that homeschooled children are very precious while<br/>
young, but they often turn into odd maladapted adults who struggle in their<br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do to ensure that your child&#39;s social development does not fall<br/>
behind his peers at school??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641615379">do you think you well spend all of your time in the home?  I only wish we<br/>
spent more time at home.  the world is for socialisation.  we do way too<br/>
much between music classes, chess club, math club, playing at frieds&#39;<br/>
houses, playing in the neighborhood, and trying to remain civil to each<br/>
other within the family.<br/>

Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>

Dalene,<br/>
<br/>
Your spelling and referring to &quot;tins&quot; of veggies, makes me ask, where are you <br/>
from? Sorry, I&#39;m just fascinated by how the same language can change and <br/>
evolve in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
Reflecting on school environments, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll see that much of the <br/>
socialization that takes place in schools is more negative than beneficial. <br/>
School often teaches kids things like:<br/>
    how to hone in on the weakest person in a group.<br/>
    how to torment anyone who is different from you.<br/>
    how to segregate according to age and pretend to be superior to those who <br/>
are younger, less athletic, less academic, etc.<br/>
    how to stand up to or run and hide from bullies.<br/>
    how to take orders without asking questions<br/>
    how to blindly follow the mob<br/>
<br/>
I could go on, but I&#39;m sure you see my point. I&#39;m not so extreme as to think <br/>
that nothing good can come out of the schools, but at what sacrifice? <br/>
Homeschooled kids can be raised in an insulated way, never dealing with or <br/>
the real world or interacting with people different from themselves. I would <br/>
say, though, that they would be the exception and were not really educated at <br/>
all. <br/>
<br/>
Most homeschooled, and especially unschooled, children are involved in life. <br/>
They talk to the people they meet when you go on errands, learn to deal with <br/>
the neighborhood kids of different ages, meet people when they volunteer or <br/>
take a class or seminar. They participate in sports, visit with the elderly <br/>
or help care for younger children. They make friends at the park or the <br/>
skating rink, or in 4-H or Scouts. They are too busy being involved with <br/>
people to worry about being properly socialized.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you already know what kind of education you want for your <br/>
child. Look here for support when the doubts of others become your own.<br/>

<br/>
**Who are these experts who know all these adults who were homeschooled? How<br/>
many current adults were homeschooled, much less unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
What do you do to ensure that your child&#39;s social development does not fall<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219446827">Hello Dalene<br/>
My 6 year old commented to me recently, &quot;Isn&#39;t it funny how I can make<br/>
friends wherever I go, and S can&#39;t. And she&#39;s 10!&quot;  It seems to me a clear<br/>
statement that we all have different needs when it comes to socializing.<br/>
Some of us like big crowds, like lots of people, some like one-to-one, some<br/>
like parties and some like activities and some like libraries.<br/>
I said the same thing that you said about my 10 year old when she was 4<br/>
(that home is better for her temperament) and we made  the decision to carry<br/>
through with home education.  She was overwhelmed by the large numbers of<br/>
children at groups and has always preferred a small group.  I tried not get<br/>
worried, not see myself  in this shy little girl.  She has blossomed over<br/>
the last few months.  Suddenly it is drama club and ice skating parties and<br/>
pen pals and staying with other home-ed friends, and them staying here, and<br/>
going out to the shops on her own, and of course, hours on the phone. :-)<br/>
My point is that as unschoolers, our children make their own decisions about<br/>
what they do and learn, including socialization.   We all have our own<br/>
timetables for our development, and others do not know what that is. Still,<br/>
they can be very good at undermining our confidence,  making all sorts of<br/>
statements based on what  they &#39;think&#39;.  My response, if somebody were to<br/>
make comments about maladjusted adults would be, depending on my mood, 1) to<br/>
ask where the research is which says this?  There isn&#39;t any. 2)  To say &quot;you<br/>
are absolutely right.  Nobody I know who went to school has any relationship<br/>
problems!&quot;<br/>
;-)  3) Ask them if it is appropriate for you to tell them how they should<br/>
be socializing? It is not, and it is equally inappropriate for them to be<br/>
telling you and your child. 4) Or I would point out that  there are loads of<br/>
kids and groups out there that you can interact with who either don&#39;t go to<br/>
school or are available after school hours.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the problem with these people? Quite frankly, it isn&#39;t any of their<br/>
business.  I admit that I get  hostile more often than I used to for the<br/>
simple reason that I have heard people say things like this so many times.<br/>
These of course are the same people who complain about bullying, peer<br/>
pressure, consumer competition, drugs, kids making fun of each other (for<br/>
being smart, or dumb, or wearing non-brand name trainers), power struggles<br/>
and hierarchy, peer dependence, stress about grades, and all of the rest of<br/>
the wonderful pathological socialization which happens to institutionalised<br/>
groups.<br/>
It seems so obvious to me that these things not only happen IN schools, but<br/>
happen BECAUSE of schools.<br/>
I suppose I will climb down from my soapbox now. I think you get the idea<br/>
that I don&#39;t worry about my kids socialization.   I would however worry if<br/>
they were in school.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
