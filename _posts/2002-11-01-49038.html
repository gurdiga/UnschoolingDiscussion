<div id="ygrps-yiv-110515238">In Vermont we have to send in 3-6 examples of &quot;schooling&quot; for each<br/>
subject by law each year. It is hard to unschool because I have to watch<br/>
what they are doing - make it fit the subject matter that the state has<br/>
put together, etc. How can I get around that? Michele<br/>

I discovered today that my new apartment comes with a maid&#39;s room in the<br/>
basement.  Now, why they thought someone in one of these dinky places would<br/>
need a maid, I don&#39;t know.  But it might make a decent guest room when<br/>
cleaned.  I think it was probably last cleaned by the outgoing maid...about<br/>
50 years ago or so!  Ugh!<br/>
