<div id="ygrps-yiv-990970356">I love the library, BUT as a child it overwhelmed me and still does. I<br/>
really need to go in with a list of books to check for, I can&#39;t just go<br/>
look. There are so many books and I just can&#39;t seem to deal with it. We do<br/>
go every week, but I never require anyone to come and I always go with a<br/>
list. I am with the kids that say to keep it short. LOL<br/>
<br/>
The children&#39;s section of many libraries is the worst for people like me.<br/>
They often are not even alphabitized! Trying to find a book is hard. My<br/>
current library(in Maine) is better than the last(in Kodiak, AK).<br/>
<br/>
I only allow my kids to bring home one book, I have any more and they don&#39;t<br/>
get read. My 9 yo is the only exception, and I often take home two myself.<br/>
<br/>
For my family books are like toys. When we throw them all in a big toy box<br/>
nothing gets played with, but when they are in smaller containers they do.<br/>
Even better is when I separate the toys and place them around the house. I<br/>
guess soem of us are just easily overwhelmed. Teehee.<br/>
