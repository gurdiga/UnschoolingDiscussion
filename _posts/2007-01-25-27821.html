Well we&#39;re so used to above-average blogs this one won&#39;t quite rate,  <br/>
but on the other hand it is interesting to see arguments concerning  <br/>
boys and schools&#39; affects on them.    There&#39;s one about early reading  <br/>
that seemed positive and good at first, until I saw the  <br/>
recommendation was early &quot;intervention.&quot;   I submitted a comment but  <br/>
I don&#39;t know if it will be left to show.<br/>
ttp://www.menshealthnetwork.org/boys/blog/blog.php?bid=17    (Oh!   <br/>
the comment does show.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for people with boys and also with relatives who pressure  <br/>
them to send those boys to school, this blog might give you some good  <br/>
ammunition and could reinforce your beliefs in unschooling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;&#39;s why I let it through.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s one on addictions.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.menshealthnetwork.org/boys/">http://www.menshealthnetwork.org/boys/</a> <br/>
blog/blog.php?bid=10<br/>
By the time those &quot;warning signs&quot; come, it&#39;s too late.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re really doing something wonderful, having boys who aren&#39;t  <br/>
secretive and feeling belittled and graded low and held back  <br/>
(literally or generally) by school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As this person DID submit the blog link to this list, I don&#39;t see how  <br/>
she can object to unschoolers commenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504752153">I suspected by the title &quot;Boys and School&quot; that the list had been<br/>
spammed, but my curiosity got the best of me so I checked out.  I&#39;m so<br/>
glad that we are Unschoolers and don&#39;t have to waste our time on<br/>
discussing &quot;creative discipline in Classroom for the good of the group&quot;<br/>
and the debate over abolishing recess.  Yuck and double yuck!  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you Sandra and all you wonderful wise Unschoolers for turning my<br/>
world upside down and then right-side up again!  My two beautiful and<br/>
joyful Unschooled boys thank you as well!<br/>
