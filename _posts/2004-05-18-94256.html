<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103002576">Hi All.  I am new to this list as of about three weeks ago. My name <br/>
is Linda and I have three really great boys ages 8, 6, and 3. First <br/>
of all, I want to thank everyone, you have already helped me to make <br/>
a choice I was having trouble with.  There is a VERY Christian hs <br/>
group that meets about 5 mins away from my house.  We were new in <br/>
town this year and joined.  I learned pretty quickly that you were <br/>
immediatly judged by two questions-Are you Christian (We actually <br/>
had <br/>
to sign a belief statement as to whether or not we were Christian <br/>
basically stating anyone who wasn&#39;t went to hell), and- What church <br/>
do you go to.  This was followed by pressure to attend church, <br/>
especailly theirs.  Now, I was raised Catholic and while I have been <br/>
movig away from it towards more open beliefs, (another good buddist <br/>
book that I have been reading is &quot;A Path With Heart&quot; by Jack <br/>
Kornfield) I didn&#39;t think a Christian group would be a problem.  I <br/>
have to say though, these are some of the most judgemental, clannish <br/>
people I have ever met.  I live in a somewhat rural area of Alaska <br/>
and any other group is at least 45 mins away.  (Not too big a deal <br/>
in the summer but winter&#39;s another story!)  Also my husband and I <br/>
share one car so it&#39;s hard sometimes.  But you know what?  I have <br/>
decided I don&#39;t care.  I would rather drive all the way into town <br/>
(even in the dead of winter) than deal with the negativity and <br/>
pressure to be &quot;saved&quot;.  We have joined a playground group in town <br/>
and suprize!  My kids actually have friends, and I don&#39;t come home <br/>
feeling guilty and annoyed.  Come fall, we will be attending the <br/>
secular group with these people.  It will be worth it.  Now this may <br/>
not seem like a big deal to anyone else, but it was a hard decision <br/>
for me.  Winter in interior Alaska is a challenge and I&#39;m not the <br/>
most confident driver.  Also I worry way too much what people <br/>
think!  Anyway, just wanted to introduce myself and thank you<br/>
(again)  I look foreword to the opportunity to keep learning and re-<br/>
evaluating. <br/>
