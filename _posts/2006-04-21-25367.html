<div id="ygrps-yiv-613490994">in my experience one place where you can get into<br/>
trouble with noting ages/charting progress and making<br/>
comparisons (which comes out of charting), as I think<br/>
sandra implied or stated, is when yours is &quot;on the<br/>
receiving end,&quot; being &quot;late&quot; so to speak. for me, when<br/>
galen was in his first year, it was weight. every<br/>
breastfed babe I knew at that time was absolutely<br/>
enormous! all over the 100th percentile. galen was 50%<br/>
the whole year and I had my mom in the background<br/>
saying &quot;what if you don&#39;t make enough milk?&quot; (grr!) as<br/>
a first-time mom, it was really stressful. then, after<br/>
his first year, he kept growing when others levelled<br/>
off, and I ran into trouble with folks thinking he was<br/>
a year older than he was/is (still happens, he&#39;s tall)<br/>
and therefore expecting behaviors he wasn&#39;t capable of<br/>
(probably shouldn&#39;t be expected even if he *was* the<br/>
age they thought, kwim?). a close friend had a similar<br/>
situation with her son, but for them it was<br/>
locomotion. he scooted/never crawled, and the only<br/>
kids who did that that she knew were disabled, and all<br/>
her friends&#39; kids were super-early walkers, while her<br/>
son walked &quot;late.&quot; everyone getting all excited about<br/>
it (like we have any influence whatsoever) really<br/>
increased her worry, to the point that she had him<br/>
evaluated. so that&#39;s certainly a potential problem...<br/>
we are going through it again with potty-training now.<br/>
when I mentioned to my parents that even brazelton (a<br/>
source they normally trust) no longer emphasizes<br/>
potty-training before age 4, they both got extremely<br/>
hostile with me. what the heck, should I send him to<br/>
potty boot camp?! not!!!<br/>
<br/>
this thread reminds me of the mainstream concept of<br/>
taking credit when kids do well and not when they<br/>
&quot;mess up&quot; (whatever that means!). we risk undue<br/>
pressure on our kids when we get too vested in their<br/>
choices and behavior, essentially living our lives<br/>
through them and thus denying them the freedom to be<br/>
who *they* are.<br/>

didn&#39;t clearly say so. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s undue pressure on the mom too, to try to live her life and  <br/>
someone else&#39;s both.<br/>

The &quot;you are your child&#39;s partner&quot; pep talks I heard at La Leche  <br/>

points for our team, but stupid things I did were points against our  <br/>
team.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always say that it was an unexpected gift to me that my first  <br/>
started walking between 17 & 18 months. I have my own not-always-good  <br/>
history with being &quot;precocious&quot; and I was surrounded at that time by  <br/>
friends who reported on their babies like this: &quot;Nate has started  <br/>
walking. He&#39;s only nine months, so that&#39;s very advanced.&quot; Not just  <br/>
telling what the baby did, but reporting always on how that stacks up  <br/>
to what other babies do, with a definite emphasis on early being better.<br/>
<br/>
So I thought it was good for me that I got early practice at being  <br/>
cheerful and mellow in the face of people suggesting there was  <br/>
something wrong with Eric (even though the age at which he walked was  <br/>
completely within the normal developmental range, not delayed at  <br/>
all),  pressing me to get him checked out, or blaming his character  <br/>
(&quot;He&#39;s just lazy.&quot;). It was also good practice seeing my kid through  <br/>
my own eyes, because it was so clear he was busy with other things  <br/>
and developing in all kinds of ways--including improving gross motor  <br/>
skills, just not through walking. Watching Eric play and work, it was  <br/>
clear that there was absolutely nothing wrong with him. It only ever  <br/>
seemed like there might be when people were comparing him to their  <br/>
own (superior) babies, or trying to hold him up to some expectation  <br/>
they&#39;d developed of what babies &quot;should&quot; be doing at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, at the time I said to my partner, &quot;It&#39;s so great that I&#39;m  <br/>
being forced to confront my childhood issues and my own unhealthy  <br/>
desire to have an advanced kid now, before I&#39;ve had the time to screw  <br/>
him up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also add to what Julie said that there is potential trouble when  <br/>
a kid is on the &quot;early&quot; end and parents--or the child--get too  <br/>
invested not only in what the child is doing and how the child is  <br/>
developing and learning, but the fact that the child is early. I have  <br/>
a lot of friends who are college professors and they value intellect,  <br/>
they tended to be &quot;gifted&quot; themselves as children, and they expect  <br/>
their kids to be, too. It makes me nervous when I hear them talking  <br/>
about their kids--in the kids&#39; hearing--saying not just, &quot;It&#39;s so  <br/>
exciting that Jaden has learned to read!&quot; but &quot;Jaden has learned to  <br/>
read, and he&#39;s only four!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 From my own experience, getting praise for doing things early can  <br/>
lead to a kid pushing herself to remain &quot;ahead,&quot; which gets harder  <br/>
and harder as you get older. Or it can lead to problems transitioning  <br/>
to adulthood. It&#39;s weird to look back on it now at the age of 40, but  <br/>
it was very hard for me in my mid-twenties when I realized I was too  <br/>
old to be &quot;precocious&quot; anymore, that no matter what I accomplished, I  <br/>
would never again be the youngest person ever to do it. Because being  <br/>
precocious had been treated like a big deal, by parents, teachers,  <br/>
and relatives, it was hard for me to let go of that quality being  <br/>
something that gave me value.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 21, I was in a Ph.D. program and on-track to complete my  <br/>
degree at 24 or 25. The program was wrong for me; I was struggling in  <br/>
it; the department was terribly dysfunctional. It was clear I needed  <br/>
to get out of there. My youth was made much of in my department by  <br/>
faculty and other students, and one reason it took me a year longer  <br/>
than it should have to leave the program was the knowledge that even  <br/>
if I went back later and finished a Ph.D., I wouldn&#39;t be an  <br/>
especially young person with a Ph.D.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who is wonderfully healthy about this, and she is  <br/>
also a gift to me. She has a son, a year older than Eric, who was one  <br/>
of your monkey-type toddlers, swarming up anything that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
perfectly smooth, leaping into the air, turning somersaults. Eric  <br/>
continues to be less physically daring than many kids his age (5). It  <br/>
was only recently, for instance, that he tried out jumping off the  <br/>
bottom step with both feet and without holding onto anything. My  <br/>
friend was with us when it happened, and she entered so whole- <br/>
heartedly into his own excitement and sense of accomplishment--I  <br/>
could tell that it never crossed her mind to think, &quot;Big deal, Noah  <br/>
has been doing that since he was 14 months old.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The underlying issue, I think, is how damaging it can be to compare  <br/>
children, to decide that one child is doing &quot;better&quot; and that the  <br/>
other child is therefore somehow deficient. And this is damaging to a  <br/>
child whether he is the better one or the deficient one. And it is  <br/>
damaging to our relationships with our kids if we&#39;re thinking in  <br/>
these terms even in subtle ways. Or so it seems to me.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Precociousness in the animal kingdom isn&#39;t always a good thing. Any <br/>
species, as a whole, that has a short infancy or juvenile period usually <br/>
lives in a lousy environment where infants or juveniles are most likely <br/>
to be eaten before reaching adulthood. So, things like dragonflies, <br/>
which have a really long juvenile period, have a low predation or <br/>
mortality risk when they are young, but are really quick to be devoured <br/>
once they molt into dragonflies. I always keep that in mind when <br/>
thinking about my own children&#39;s precociousness, or lack thereof. I <br/>
figure that the longer they are little, the better their environment is.<br/>

  Its amazing how competative this is. I used to point out that whena  child is 18 no-one is gonna give two cents what age they walked!<br/>
  My kids all walked at different ages ranging from 6 months for the eldest to never for the youngest. I love them all the same!<br/>

Then MIL visits and undoes all I say by telling H that only stupid people stay at home and look after kids (that&#39;ll be me....), only stupid people have disabled kids etc. Its reaLLYmessing up our family and making H unhappy.

  Its a very insidious thing. I was watching some adverts the other day aimed at mothers for those electronic book things. onthe advert mum and dad were thrilled when beautiful blond blue eyed (another message there) toddler pressed the buttons and repeated the words but unhappy when the child didn&#39;t. It was promoting such early academic stuff I was astonished. the next advert was for a car with the message that women wont find you sexy unless you achieve anough in life to own the car. the car buyer was suave and handsome, the guy on the bike the women ignored was geeky with mad hair.<br/>
  Its a real battle changing this. H already thinks that what you look like and what you are is more important than who you are inside :-(<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had the same thing, my mom going on and on about how grades were  <br/>
the only thing that would get you anywhere, and the only valued thing  <br/>
about me was my grades. Ick. I can tell you that it screwed up my  <br/>
whole childhood, contributed to obsessive compulsive tendencies and  <br/>
left me high and dry when grades didn&#39;t matter anymore. I went to  <br/>
college and spent thousands of dollars in a major I hated, and wasted  <br/>
a year of my life trying to prove something and get my mom to approve  <br/>
of me. I faced disappointment from all camps when I dropped my premed  <br/>
and went to regular zoology. What I want to know is, How in the hell  <br/>
does your MIL equate intelligence to disability? That is not good for  <br/>
your children to be around, esp your own who has quad! I would  <br/>
definitely not allow a poisonous influence like that in my home or  <br/>
around my kids! That&#39;s the first step in teaching kids that it&#39;s not  <br/>
true, by not letting someone beat them over the head with it!<br/>
My oldest had a lot of trouble at home when I first pulled them out  <br/>
of school. He did great! He had awesome grades, and he tested well,  <br/>
and the teachers loved him. But he had gotten to the point where  <br/>
performance was all that counted, and he only lived to please.  <br/>
There&#39;s no living in that. When he first came home he cried all the  <br/>
time, he needed someone to tell him all the time that he was the best  <br/>
at everything. That&#39;s all that exists in the schools, and you can&#39;t  <br/>
get around that. If you can&#39;t be the best at grades, then it becomes  <br/>
sports, or clubs, or ingratiating yourself to the teachers. And if  <br/>
you can&#39;t succeed at that, you&#39;re told you&#39;re a failure and you  <br/>
become part of the crowd that&#39;s out to prove that what adults say  <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter, rebel without a cause. That&#39;s what happened to my  <br/>
brother who couldn&#39;t succeed in school or with my family.<br/>
<br/>
Eh, again, not enough sleep. hope this makes sense. Please do what  <br/>
you can to protect your daughter from hearing it. And apologize to  <br/>
her for it. Explain to her that MIL was raised in an era or a culture  <br/>
that values performance above the person.<br/>

the community college, then they weren&#39;t any longer constantly  <br/>

Flute as OK as I&#39;ve been playing that for my lifetime (almost) but not so the guitar.

<br/>
Well they *might* give 2 cents what age their precocious walkers<br/>
walked for years and years.  Every new baby they meet grants them an<br/>
opportunity to share it yet again.    <br/>
<br/>
Speaking from the perspective of not being a precocious walker (I<br/>
know.. poor me :-PP~~~~) it&#39;s irritating to hear how I was such a<br/>
&quot;lazy&quot; baby --not the least &quot;in a hurry&quot; to walk.  Yah.. and I&#39;m a low<br/>
key gal which may or may not have anything to do with the price of tea<br/>
in China.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you.  It won&#39;t matter how early or late a child is when<br/>
s/he&#39;s older... but only (I would add) ...as long as s/he doesn&#39;t hear<br/>
comparisons.  Hopefully most people have no idea when s/he passed<br/>
certain earthshaking self-definitive milestones.  Who we are and what<br/>
we do might be related sometimes.  Just as easily they can be totally<br/>
unrelated in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
What if we were to think &quot;I did it!&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s interesting&quot; or &quot;cool&quot;<br/>
or &quot;huh.. I wonder about this over here now...&quot; without attaching age,<br/>
gender, or other traits to accomplishments?  We might not necessarily<br/>
choose even to think of them as accomplishments per se.  Sounds easier<br/>
to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Some woman was the first female feminist and probably didn&#39;t get<br/>
credit for it or think I&#39;m the &quot;first.&quot;  She might have been more<br/>
likely to feel she was the &quot;only&quot; one and maybe lonely or villified OR<br/>
maybe none of those.  Same goes for the first male feminist.<br/>
