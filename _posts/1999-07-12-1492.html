&gt; &gt;surely there are &quot;issues&quot; that you (as parents) feel are important for your<br/>
&gt; &gt;children to know...  ?  &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Agreed.  For instance,  this past year,  I insisted that my  13  year <br/>
old son and I work our way through  _What&#39;s Happening to My Body for Boys_<br/>
I never insist on math, writing, etc.,  but I felt like this was a <br/>
safety issue - some things he really needed to know,  but wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
caught dead asking to learn.  I waited and left the book around for <br/>
quite awhile,  and then approached it very slowly with his <br/>
cooperation.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, as far as the holocaust - my daughter and I spent some time <br/>
studying that when she was about 15 using Schindler&#39;s List as a <br/>
jumping off point.  She&#39;s very sensitive and I don&#39;t know that she <br/>
would have been able to handle it much earlier.  My 13 year old knows <br/>
the basics about the holocaust but we haven&#39;t delved into the <br/>
details yet.<br/>
