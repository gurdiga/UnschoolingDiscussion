<br/>
&lt;It all boils down to how folks present their&quot;thoughts&quot;or&quot;ideas.&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your not taking your own advice. I hear a lot of anger and a little frustration too. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;Contrary to oft stated *opinions,* they are just that, they are not *facts.*&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s right, this is just an exchange of opinions and ideas. I suggest that you refrain from reading Sandra&#39;s posts, they aren&#39;t bringing out the best in you :~)<br/>
