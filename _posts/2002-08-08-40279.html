the Sainted dead who preceeded us.  Hence, Nov. 1 became the Feast of All<br/>
Saints, when the Saints (capital S, those whom the church has &quot;Sainted&quot;) who<br/>
have passed before us are remembered.  Later (much later, I think, but I&#39;m<br/>
not sure) there was interest in remembering that all those who died in the<br/>
faith are also considered saints (little s).  Rather than expand a beloved<br/>
celebration of important Saints, the natural step was to declare the<br/>
following day as their celebration.  Hence, All Souls Day, the 2nd of<br/>
November.  <br/>
<br/>
Somebody with Texas knowledge with have to tell you just how Dia De Los<br/>
Muertos falls into that, though.  I&#39;m not sure which day that is<br/>
celebrating.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-143320097">Hi!<br/>
You&#39;re right, Halloween is the pagan celebration, but the Christian Tradition it means All Hallows Eve, or the night before All Saints Day, the day we remember All the Saints, from past to present.  All Souls Day is the day we remember all the deceased of this land.  I would bet that the name you mentioned in Texas is  just the Spanish term for the above dates and mean the same, but, I will find out.  I&#39;m part of a Spanish parish here in Michigan, where a lot of migrants come from Texas in the summer.  Our priest is from Columbia.  Hope to an anwser this afternoon.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dia de Los Muertos (Literally, Day of the Dead) has been celebrated by<br/>
indigenous peoples in Mexico for over 3000 years. The Spanish<br/>
conquistadors tried to eradicate it, without success, but they did get it<br/>
moved to November 1-2, to coincide with All Saints Day and All Souls day,<br/>
and some stuff actually starts on the 31st.<br/>
<br/>
Last year Rain and I were in the Tucson Dia de los Muertos parade - we<br/>
dressed in black and painted out faces like skulls, and marched for about<br/>
5 miles through downtown. There were drums and other musicians, <br/>
&quot;puppets&quot; - paper mache heads and hands that people held up with sticks<br/>
under a cape, so they were 12 feet or so in the air, stilters (Rain<br/>
wished she had brought hers!), and just hundreds of cool people. It<br/>
started at dark and the party lasted until well after midnight - we ended<br/>
at a club where there were fire dancers - here are some photos, but I<br/>
think they&#39;re from the year before:<br/>

The original point of the parade was to &quot;chase&quot; the dead back to their<br/>
land, with the &quot;puppets&quot; now representing the dead.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for Dia de los Muertos, it&#39;s traditional to make altaras (altars)<br/>
for people who have died. It&#39;s also traditional to eat decorated skulls<br/>
made of hardened sugar - I think you can put the name of the dead person<br/>
on the forehead. I believe the Aztecs used real skulls...<br/>
<br/>
I imagine most US cities with a sizeable Hispanic population does<br/>
something for Dia de los Muertos... I know Oakland does as well, they<br/>
have a big parade in the Fruitvale.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908586225">okay.. so now i get it.. it is 1 AND 2 of nov.. because there are so many alters and celebrations around that time here for the day o&#39; the dead.. and i have heard both days quoted as the dia...<br/>
<br/>
so now i will celebrate all of them.. .. the parade you and Rain went to sounds fabulous.. we have things like that here in san antonio, but not any one big organized parade.. i think it would be a great idea. so much of our culture here is from mexico.. some consider us north mexico.. i have made some glass skull beads (yes, i am a glass melter.. i love it) decorated like the sugar skulls put on alters at that time.. i love them.. one of the local samba groups used to do a small parade in fabulous black and white costumes with skull masks etc.. <br/>

Add to the confusion that as the Jew calculate a day to begin at sundown the <br/>
day before, so did much of Europe at one time, in a way.   That&#39;s why <br/>
Christmas Eve is the night before Christmas and &quot;Hallow&#39;s Eve&quot; is the night <br/>
before November 1.  They get named for the day it will be in the morning.  <br/>
