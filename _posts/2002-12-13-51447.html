&lt;&lt; Rain broke two bones in her arm today, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh no!! That&#39;s really terrible.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for the lousy hospital visit and all, I know what you mean about <br/>
the yucky feeling. I get almost nauseated when I smell a hospital and see the <br/>
equipment. Too many sad/icky memories of loved ones dying there.<br/>
Poor Rain.<br/>
I&#39;m sending her healing vibes!!<br/>
<br/>
Please check into homeopathic remedies, they can be extremely helpful when <br/>
nothing else will work. I have a friend that used a couple for a bad break <br/>
her son had. The follow up X-Rays couldn&#39;t pinpoint the break because it <br/>
healed so beautifully.<br/>

&gt; My mom tried that.  She failed dozens of times, but saw it as a failing<br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; ME, not in her.<br/>
&gt; She told me, when I said &quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; variants from &quot;No you&#39;re not&quot; to<br/>
&gt; &quot;You <br/>
&gt; have never been hungry a day in your life.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Probably she heard those things from her parents, and rather than really <br/>
&gt; think about what it might mean to me to have my mother hand me some food<br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; a smile and a hug, she decided she didn&#39;t HAVE to do that, and maybe she <br/>
&gt; could train me to stop asking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra I love reading your posts - the wisdom - hard sought after no doubt <br/>
-just comes out.<br/>
I think parents often respond from pain - the request for nourishment means <br/>
more to us. Yes, as you said  parents voices but also what the child says <br/>
means something different to us. &#39;you didn&#39;t feed me enough&quot; you haven&#39;t <br/>
bought the right groceries&quot; we respnd to the expectation - get up and make <br/>
more - different - we&#39;re short on cash and they don&#39;t know that. We take it <br/>
personally. Stepping aside from our own &quot;stuff&quot; and just hearing a clean <br/>
simple request. and we don&#39;t have to do it all. &quot;I am tired you may make <br/>
yourself something else to eat&quot; &quot;Yes but this or that is what you may have&quot; . <br/>
 I don&#39;t know maybe I&#39;ve gone on about nothing but hearing people (including <br/>
our children)  without taking things personally and being able to respond <br/>
honestly from our reality without worrying about expectations is a pretty big <br/>
undertaking in life.<br/>
