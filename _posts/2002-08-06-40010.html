What&#39;s not enough for ANYONE is public school. Those places are the centers<br/>
for the limitation of learning, the denial of education. *Dumbing Down* is<br/>
not just a catchy phrase, it&#39;s the national government policy.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t still believe that schools offer actual education, do you? Think<br/>
about your own statements -- saying that there is so much you don&#39;t know.<br/>
That&#39;s a good place to start...knowing that by going to school yourself you<br/>
learned so little, and have not learned SO MUCH since. School teaches<br/>
children NOT to learn, to despise the process.<br/>
<br/>
The government teaches ONLY what it wants us to know...Darn little.<br/>
<br/>
The place to get an education is EVERYWHERE BUT GOVERNMENT SCHOOL.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - there is that &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; -- so you do get an education there, <br/>
too, just not what most of us, here, think of as a &quot;good education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And - once again - I have to point out that these comments apply EQUALLY to <br/>
most of the private schools too. Often even MORE so!<br/>
