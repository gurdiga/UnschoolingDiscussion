<div id="ygrps-yiv-704874319">so please don&#39;t yell at me.  First, some explanation of where I am coming <br/>
from:<br/>
I have been working as a home instructor for almost 20 years for various <br/>
school districts, so I&#39;ve seen many, many types of kids in many, many types <br/>
of situations. I have 3 sons of my own, and started homeschooling/unschooling <br/>
my 13 year old son in January.  (I have a son in college, and one who will <br/>
graduate from high school this June, even though the school is driving me <br/>
NUTS.)  I&#39;m trying to find that line between unschooling and a free for all.  <br/>
If I could do anything I wanted all day, of course I would be happy.  If I <br/>
let my son do anything he wants, my house runs a lot smoother.  We&#39;ve never <br/>
had bedtimes or meal restrictions (of their own volition, my son and I are <br/>
vegan and another son is veggie).  We try hard not to judge others, but we&#39;re <br/>
not perfect.  We have very few rules in my house, but the few I have are to <br/>
be taken seriously: have respect for others, help when you can, have manners, <br/>
and we&#39;re a family, not a bunch of people sharing a house.  OK, my question: <br/>
when does it cross the line from unschooling into a lack of manners?  My kids <br/>
and I and my husband may have an (almost) equal say in how the family is run, <br/>
but the kids don&#39;t have more say than we do.  I&#39;m getting the impression from <br/>
some of the posts that the kids are running the household, which makes the <br/>
house run smoother, as there is nothing to argue about.  But I also don&#39;t <br/>
want to turn into a mother who is so nice to their kid, I get run over in the <br/>
process.  I hope this is making sense.  I am NOT insulting anyone or looking <br/>
at anyone in particular; I&#39;m asking an honest question and would like some <br/>
honest answers.  Thanks.<br/>

I didn&#39;t see a question, really.  I saw you expressing general uneasiness.<br/>
<br/>
If the only question is this: &quot;&lt;&lt; OK, my question: <br/>
when does it cross the line from unschooling into a lack of manners? &quot;<br/>
And you&#39;re not having a problem with that, and you don&#39;t know of anyone else <br/>

<br/>
Here is my very short thoughts on this. The majority of what has been discussed lately has not been unschooling but non-coercive parenting. Your question is asking about 2 different things, IMO. Unschooling is an educational choice while NCP is a parenting style. Obviously since we homeschool our educational choice and our parenting style overlap. Which is why NCP comes up in so many of the unschooling conversations. I imagine it would be difficult to be a NCP and not unschool your child. However, I do think it is possible to unschool your child while not being a NCP.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619625039">***One was the example of the kid interrupting the parent&#39;s conversation<br/>
with a <br/>
friend.  I saw that as the kid being rude,  but others came up with<br/>
solutions <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a perception difference then. <br/>
I didn&#39;t think the ten (or was he eleven) year old was being rude.  I saw<br/>
him as interested and engaged.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think kids want to be rude, unless they&#39;ve had rudeness<br/>
demonstrated to them.  I saw this child as feeling very confident that<br/>
his presence was welcome and valued and I think that&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I saw him as not yet fully understanding the common ideas about courteous<br/>
conversation.   That&#39;s not rudeness, just a kind of innocence.<br/>
<br/>
I think his mom was pretty cool to let him hang out with her when she had<br/>
friends over.  I think he&#39;s learning about polite and friendly<br/>
conversation because he gets to hang out with her. <br/>
<br/>
The mom was worried that others would think it was rude, not that her<br/>
child actually *is* rude.  <br/>
She was looking for a way to make everyone feel ok about it, and maybe<br/>
help her son understand how others might be feeling.  She wanted to be<br/>
respectful of his feelings because she knew he wasn&#39;t *trying* to bother<br/>
anyone.  He was only trying to participate.    <br/>
<br/>
Viewing children as good and as having good intentions is mightily<br/>
different than societies view of children as little critters who need<br/>
training.   Unschoolers tend to look upon their children as whole and<br/>
good and hoping for the very best for themselves and others.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think children who have been treated with respect would want to be<br/>
rude or disrespectful to others?<br/>
I don&#39;t think they would.   That hasn&#39;t been my experience in my home.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are only the two choices; either parents are in<br/>
charge or the child is.  I think a healthier approach is parents and<br/>
children as partners in the family.    <br/>
<br/>
Now I forgot the question.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21401186">In my opinion, healthy children who rule the roost have not been given <br/>
proper models to emulate, nor proper guidlines to follow.  My children are <br/>
well behaved, respectful, cooperative and kind because that is how they are <br/>
treated.  I don&#39;t want my tv on 24 hours a day but I have never had to say <br/>
that out loud because *I* don&#39;t sit in front of it all day and they are <br/>
given a wide variety of opportunities to explore other areas in life.  Sure, <br/>
my kids can sit for hours with the tv on, but rarely are they glued to the <br/>
set.  When I see they are otherwise occupied, I quietly turn it off without <br/>
complaints.  I may offer a trip to the park or a read aloud book.<br/>
<br/>
If I want to talk to a friend in private or without being interrupted, they <br/>
understand and respect my need for a quiet conversation and will find other <br/>
ways to occupy their time.  If they do interrupt or are especially needy, I <br/>
ask them to wait until I am done talking or may excuse myself to help them <br/>
find something else to do in the meantime, but I don&#39;t let them walk all <br/>
over me.  They have no problem with that because they are given the same <br/>
respect with their time and need for privacy.  I can&#39;t imagine jumping in to <br/>
their conversations to ask questions or to have things repeated that clearly <br/>
don&#39;t involve me.  It would drive them crazy!  In return, they don&#39;t do that <br/>
to me either.  If for some reason they did suddenly begin to do these <br/>
things, I would be looking for other reasons for the behavior and addressing <br/>
those needs.<br/>
<br/>
You aren&#39;t imagining it, some people do let their kids walk all over them!  <br/>
It has nothing to do with unschooling because I could tell you a million <br/>
stories about schooled children I know that do the same thing.  It&#39;s a <br/>
parenting issue of boundaries, principles and guidelines.  Some people have <br/>
more than others.  Some people have none at all.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Gee thanks, I try to ask a question, and get smart remarks back.  Stupid<br/>
me,<br/>
thinking I could learn something without feeling like I&#39;m in SCHOOL!  This<br/>
is<br/>

<br/>
Please hang around and I&#39;m sure you will get the info you were asking for. I<br/>
too was wondering about what Mary mentioned. She asked sincerely what<br/>
exactly you were looking for and will try and help. Others will too.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the example you gave, I didn&#39;t really follow it as most people<br/>
were not seeing it as a problem. I feel some conversations are not meant for<br/>
my kids to hear and be involved in. I make sure they are not around and busy<br/>
with other things when that happens. If I didn&#39;t care and it didn&#39;t bother<br/>
me, then I wouldn&#39;t let what others thought make a difference. If my<br/>
children are really into watching something interesting on tv and very upset<br/>
with me if I try to talk to them, then I would explain to them those<br/>
circumstances when it may happen with me. I would guess that if that<br/>
conversation situation would come up here, I would try and do the same. So<br/>
for me, no it wouldn&#39;t be okay but I would definately try to solve that<br/>
problem in a gentle understanding way.<br/>

<br/>
So you&#39;re saying it wasn&#39;t really an honest question, and you didn&#39;t want to <br/>
have anyone inquire about what you meant by it?<br/>
<br/>
I believe the apology at the top of the first post was not really fear of the <br/>
list, but acknowledgement that it was NOT &quot;an honest question,&quot; but a veiled <br/>
suggestion that we let our kids run our lives and be rude and we have some <br/>
unschooling policy of letting kids be involved in everything parents do.<br/>
<br/>
If you had read all the responses to the question about the kid who <br/>
interrupted you would have seen me and two or three others say he should not <br/>
be in or around the conversation if it was important to the other person and <br/>
didn&#39;t involve him.  Yet your honest question suggested you only read people <br/>
brainstorming how to help him understand.<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested this was an &quot;NCP&quot; distinction, but it&#39;s not.  &quot;Non-coercive <br/>
parenting&quot; is a practically-trademarked term for a group called Taking <br/>
Children Seriously.  They&#39;re doing a whole different thing from this.  What&#39;s <br/>
discussed on this list is from the angle of attachment parenting, partnership <br/>

<br/>
Well I think that with unschooling you want your child to feel <br/>
comfortable asking questions. I know that around here there are times <br/>
when I feel it&#39;s perfectly appropriate for my kids to ask questions <br/>
during conversations. They are included in a lot of adult activities <br/>
and not just relegated to the &quot;kid table.&quot; I want them to ask about <br/>
what they don&#39;t understand. That&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not to say that the kid in question wasn&#39;t doing it too <br/>
much. It sounds like he was interrupting and being a little rude. I <br/>
think the mom was trying to find a solution that goes beyond just <br/>
saying &quot;stop being rude.&quot; It&#39;s trying to find the reason why the <br/>
child is behaving this way. I doubt it&#39;s just that no one ever <br/>
mentioned to him that interruptions are rude. He&#39;s looking for <br/>
something and the mom was looking for a gentle way to help him get <br/>
what he needs while still maintaining her right to have an <br/>
uninterrupted conversation.<br/>

<br/>
  **Someone suggested this was an &quot;NCP&quot; distinction, but it&#39;s not.  <br/>
  &quot;Non-coercive<br/>
  parenting&quot; is a practically-trademarked term for a group called Taking<br/>
  Children Seriously.  They&#39;re doing a whole different thing from this.  <br/>
  What&#39;s<br/>
  discussed on this list is from the angle of attachment parenting, <br/>
  partnership<br/>
  with the kids, and respect for them as people.  To have characterized this<br/>
  list as discussing NCP is not correct.***<br/>
<br/>
  I must absolutely 100% agree with this statement!  I&#39;ve been on that list, <br/>
  long ago.  Not the same thing at ALL.<br/>

You think it&#39;s possible for Sue to have been a little confused about <br/>
how to let your kids choose their pastimes, and have a gross <br/>
misunderstanding about how parenting styles and schooling styles <br/>
cross, without it being an attack on unschooling? <br/>
<br/>
fact is, Sue did NOT post the question you have given here, that I&#39;ve <br/>
seen. If she did, will you link me to that post? and I think her tone <br/>
was alright, though maybe the &quot;please don&#39;t yell at me&quot; may be a clue <br/>
to you more experienced on the list.<br/>

&gt; really  want to know and understand; I don&#39;t mean to be rude or judgemental<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did read your first post but wanted to jump off of this specific question.  <br/>
Someone may have already answered better than I but here it goes.<br/>
<br/>
We live together as a family.  My boys and dh and I always try to have a <br/>
win-win situation with everyone having input into the daily and not so daily <br/>
activities.  We compromise a lot and have respect for each others feelings <br/>
and opinions.  <br/>
<br/>
I do recognize, however, that my boys are young and are still forming their <br/>
own path.  They do not have the patience that I have, referring to the <br/>
interrupted conversation.  If it is truly a private conversation I will <br/>
explain this ahead of time and they will busy themselves with something else, <br/>
that has happened here.  That is where our years of being considerate come <br/>
in.  They are respectful of me.  They know that I mean what I say.  They know <br/>
that if it isn&#39;t a private conversation they are free to be with me.  They <br/>
usually aren&#39;t interested though.  If they have something to tell me or need <br/>
me for something they know they can interrupt and I will listen, I will <br/>
usually ask the adult to hold for a minute because I know that my 6 year old <br/>
can&#39;t.  To him, what he has to say is important, and I listen.<br/>
<br/>
Another example is : I take them where they need to go, I can drive, they <br/>
can&#39;t.  And I don&#39;t make judgments on where they need to go.  To them the <br/>
park is just as important as the grocery store.  We make lots of compromises. <br/>
 I think it comes down to respect and trust.  <br/>
<br/>
If my boys forget to say please it isn&#39;t because they are trying to be mean.  <br/>
They are doing the best they can.  I try my best to be a good role model for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway not sure I was any help at all.  If you could elaborate about what you <br/>
consider bad manners, like the conversation situation it might help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675698830">Hi Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for that. You&#39;ve understood my problem - his immense persistence! I<br/>
want to teach him to respect other people&#39;s needs without crushing his need<br/>
for information and desire to take part in the conversation. I need to talk<br/>
to other people besides my son. I enjoy his company and we have fantastic<br/>
talks about the world, the universe, why we are here etc. - stuff neither of<br/>
us has anyone else to talk to about. But I also need to talk to other<br/>
people - including my husband and other children! Most of the time I am<br/>
happy to include James in these talks on an equal basis but sometimes his<br/>
involvement is far more than an equal basis - he takes over the conversation<br/>
by asking so many questions (eg. asking me to explain what we are talking<br/>
about) and being so insistent on getting answers to the point where the<br/>
conversation founders. There are other times when I want or need to have<br/>
private conversations. James feels very left out and hurt then. Now and then<br/>
I arrange to go out with a friend at night but my husband is away quite<br/>
often and in between other commitments, I can only manage to do this once or<br/>
twice a month. I do feel there are getting to be more occasions when James<br/>
takes part in the conversation without the situation becoming stressful.<br/>
Maybe I just need to keep doing what I am doing and wait. Before he came out<br/>
of school two and a half years ago, he was very withdrawn and used to hide<br/>
in his bedroom if anyone came to the house. Once he was out of school he<br/>
just wouldn&#39;t allow me to talk to anyone. When I look back, I can see how<br/>
far we have come but on a daily basis, the progress seems so slow.<br/>

&gt; aunts, as well! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308913205">&lt;&lt;I do feel there are getting to be more occasions when James<br/>
takes part in the conversation without the situation becoming stressful.<br/>
Maybe I just need to keep doing what I am doing and wait. Before he came<br/>
out<br/>
of school two and a half years ago, he was very withdrawn and used to<br/>
hide<br/>
in his bedroom if anyone came to the house. Once he was out of school he<br/>
just wouldn&#39;t allow me to talk to anyone. When I look back, I can see<br/>
how<br/>
far we have come but on a daily basis, the progress seems so slow.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like things improved while you weren&#39;t looking! Perhaps school<br/>
interfered with his normal development in the area of attachment/pulling<br/>
away and he is having to &quot;catch up&quot; to himself for time lost. It must<br/>
seem like a pendulum swing in the opposite direction from withdrawn. <br/>
<br/>
Some people/writers have suggested talking to the child before the<br/>
challenging situation, explaining to him what would be the desired<br/>
behavior and the feelings that might be expected to come up. I guess in<br/>
this case prior to having a visitor. This doesn&#39;t help much when the<br/>
interrupted conversation is an unplanned phone call or extemporaneous<br/>
talk with your dh. I can just imagine it, with ds asking why and how and<br/>
the whole history of why you want to talk to him about how he talks when<br/>
you are trying to talk! (LOL)<br/>
<br/>
I bet his leftover school pain and self-protective behaviors will<br/>
continue to recede as he gains more confidence.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I want to teach him to respect other people&#39;s needs without crushing<br/>
his need for information and desire to take part in the conversation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
People here have found that by respecting the child, the child just<br/>
becomes respectful, without being &quot;taught&quot;. Jayn is so courteous to me<br/>
and others without ever being &quot;told&quot; to be. To be honest, my dh<br/>
occasionally is a stickler for &quot;please&quot;, but I try to discourage that as<br/>
I don&#39;t see his asking her to say &quot;please&quot; having any effect whatsoever<br/>
on her choosing to or remembering to say it. She is terrific with<br/>
&quot;Thanks&quot; and &quot;Excuse me&quot;, and always says please when asking a cashier<br/>
for something.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I need to talk to other people besides my son.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course you do. Isn&#39;t the lack of adult conversation a standing &quot;joke&quot;<br/>
directed at all parents. Remember the tv commercial when the husband<br/>
just had to take his wife to a Shakespeare play. For situations where it<br/>
is a private conversation, or the wrong time, some author I read (my<br/>
fuzzy memory of which it is - I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t cite the source better)<br/>
recommended something along the lines of honoring the feeling, without<br/>
getting involved in answering the endless round of questions if you are<br/>
not up for it. It&#39;s along the lines of saying &quot;gee, you really want my<br/>
attention just now. It must be frustrating to have to wait till later&quot;<br/>
and then stopping. I&#39;m not sure how honest this is; it seems just<br/>
manipulative in this instance (I&#39;m all for honoring feelings when it is<br/>
without ulterior motives). Any thoughts on that anyone?<br/>
