 </span></blockquote>I suppose you could say we do, as we don&#39;t actively try to teach our children <br/>
any particular religion. IMHO, if there are requirements for the kids (Sunday <br/>
school, attending services, reading time) and the kids can&#39;t truly say No <br/>
without some sort of repercussions (anything from negative comments, <br/>
disapproving attitudes to punishment) then it&#39;s not really Unschooling <br/>
religion.<br/>
<br/>
We recently went through some issues since my son has spent the majority of <br/>
his life living with his dad. That family has made some pretty drastic <br/>
changes in their religious life in the past few years and it was a religion I <br/>
am extremely uncomfortable with. As a Parent Who Trusts, I have had to accept <br/>
this part of my son&#39;s life, allow him to be who he is. I can&#39;t MAKE him do <br/>
things my way, and I need to support him in his needs and wants.<br/>
Nobody said Unschooling was easy.<br/>
