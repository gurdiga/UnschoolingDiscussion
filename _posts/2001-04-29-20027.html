<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822791531">Help any techies out there. I signed up for an e-mail address through yahoo and now if I want to join any groups it won&#39;t let me use this address. I have tried listing it as the alternate address but it seems to only recognize the yahoo account. Also when the egroups transferred over I think I was assigned a different user name and cannot recall it. When it gives me the list of groups I have subscribed to this one is not on there. Help!!! <br/>
