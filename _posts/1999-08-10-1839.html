I totally agree with all the comments about your son.  Most of the comments<br/>
I see on this list about spirited children or whatever we want to call them<br/>
I have made about my oldest son.  He is now about to turn 9 and I really<br/>
like him and I love being around him.  Now he is mostly cooperative, fun,<br/>
creative, interesting etc etc - in short the child I would want to have.<br/>
Whew.  It was so scary when he was younger and I was such a &quot;rotten&quot; parent<br/>
(ask those parents with well behaved toddlers).  I encourage all of you to<br/>
hang in there.<br/>

Not only do kids improve as they mature, know-it-all friends also gain <br/>
perspective over time, and get less positive that they know everything.<br/>
<br/>
So, you get improvements on both sides, I think, as time passes.<br/>
