I too have been contemplating how I&#39;m going to take the kids to the beach <br/>
this summer by myself during the week while dh is at work.  The kids are (almost) <br/>
4 and 1.5, so I know what you mean!   Now that the baby runs all over the <br/>
place, usually in the opposite direction as us, I&#39;m not seeing us heading off to <br/>
the beach without dad this year.<br/>
We haven&#39;t done any swim lessons yet either, but it seems to be all the rage <br/>
this time of year for the other 3-4 yr olds in our area.  I asked ds if he&#39;d <br/>
like to take lessons and he is NOT interested.  He stays in the kiddie pool and <br/>
runs around the very shallow wheel-chair access area of the big pool.  At the <br/>
beach he&#39;s never gone in further than his knees.<br/>
I&#39;d like to see him become more comfortable in the water, but we have a short <br/>
outdoor swim season here and the YMCA is way too expensive, so perhaps as he <br/>
gets older, we&#39;ll spend more time in the water, and either we&#39;ll teach him or <br/>
he can take lessons if he wants to.<br/>
As for the kids getting along, 3 1/2 and 1 1/2 are hard ages to get along <br/>
really.  They are both quite young.  Mine do well sometimes.  They adore each <br/>
other but get in each other&#39;s way and fight over toys, typical sibling stuff.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to stay out of it more often now that the baby is getting older <br/>
and can do more for herself.  Sometimes, they need to work it out on their <br/>
own.  When someone starts swinging, I do step in.  And it is hard to be patient <br/>
sometimes, but remember they are just little kids!<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
