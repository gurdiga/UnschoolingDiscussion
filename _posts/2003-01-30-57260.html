 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I joined about two weeks ago. And, in discussing this concept with my<br/>
best friend, she brought up the founding fathers&#39; childhoods of<br/>
structure, coursework, schedules, etc. So I threw it in the pot here.<br/>
I did get feedback, I think from Mary B., that the founding fathers<br/>
may have pursued further, even Classic education, but they didn&#39;t<br/>
embark on their scholarship before about age 12.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WOW!!!! I&#39;m more knowledgeable than I thought!!! Not only did I not know <br/>
that first part about the founding fathers, but I don&#39;t even recall <br/>
responding. Guess I&#39;m just full of knowledge and spout off so frequently <br/>
even I don&#39;t remember.<br/>
