<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436261596"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I had to respond to this very interesting discussion. I tend to wonder<br/>
&gt; about foundation information too, Laraine. I strive to be more<br/>
&gt; &#39;unschooling&#39; in my approach...and that is why I am on this list , but I<br/>
&gt; still struggle with leaving the math-learning to its own devices.<br/>
&gt; I have two friends who are unschoolers through and through. Their children<br/>
&gt; now are in high school or have gone to college. Both friends tell me that<br/>
&gt; they did not teach math from a text or from a workbook and they both regret<br/>
&gt; not keeping up with &#39;building blocks&#39; of learning math. Their children<br/>
&gt; struggled with math  when they went mainstream. The struggle was painful<br/>
&gt; and it took a long time to catch up. In other subjects they were on top of<br/>
&gt; the class but in math they were frustrated. They have advised me to<br/>
&gt; unschool in all subjects except in math.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is my personal experience.  My daughter was in ps until halfway <br/>
through her sophomore year.  She was always in advanced math.  After <br/>
we took her out,  we enrolled her in a correspondence program and her <br/>
dad tutored her individually through geometry and algebra 2.  She <br/>
received good grades in both subjects.  Still,  when she took the <br/>
ACT,  her math score was  not wonderful and she lacks confidence in <br/>
her math skills.  This semester she is taking intermediate algebra in <br/>
college which is basically a refresher/remedial course.  The number <br/>
of students that end up needing this course is enormous and most of <br/>
these kids came out of ps.  Dh is a college professor.  He feels like <br/>
about 1/3 of his students really &quot;get&quot; math.  What I&#39;m trying to say is that <br/>
structured math in the ps style is no guarantee that the kids aren&#39;t <br/>
going to struggle.  I think losing confidence plays not an <br/>
insignificant role.  Now,  my 13 year old unschooler chooses to do <br/>
quite a bit of math.  He really &quot;gets&quot; it.  I went all the way <br/>
through college and was identified as gifted in math.  I can honestly <br/>
say that I don&#39;t get it.  Dh (the college prof) flunked 5th grade <br/>
math and wasn&#39;t considered college material.  He not only gets it - <br/>
he uses it every day of his life.  We will continue to approach math <br/>
in an unschooling fashion.  If ds wants to enroll in a course,  he <br/>
certainly can.  What&#39;s important to me is that he enjoys the math <br/>
that he does and he has the confidence to know that he can learn <br/>
whatever he needs to.<br/>

Amen to that!!! I don&#39;t remember 3/4 of what I learned in P.S. math classes <br/>
(maybe because much of that has not been used since?). However I do know how <br/>
to balance a checkbook, figure out what percentage to take off for a sale, <br/>
how to sew a patchwork quilt, how to bake a cake from scratch...so, unless I <br/>
had an occupation or interest that required more extensive math skills, I <br/>
don&#39;t feel a loss!  Lori in TX</div>
