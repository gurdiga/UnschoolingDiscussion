<div id="ygrps-yiv-996046788">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am a homeschooling father with four children.  My two oldest children are<br/>
working on a SpaceDay Challenge for NASA that involves the International<br/>
Space Station.  Our problem is that they can not be considered for judging<br/>
unless they have four students work on the project.  Well, my two youngest<br/>
are 1 and 4 so that won&#39;t work for us.  Do any of you have children who<br/>
would be in grades 4-6 that would like to participate with my children on<br/>
this project?  There is only one day left and we are getting desparate.  My<br/>
son and daughter have developed what they believe is a solution to a<br/>
communications challenge and published their Flash presentation at:<br/>
www.rjsinternational.com/spaceday .  Would you please take a look and if you<br/>
have children in the needed age group (NASA&#39;s rules, not ours), please<br/>
contact us ASAP.  You may also call us at (954) 776-5644.<br/>
<br/>
TIA - RJS</div>
