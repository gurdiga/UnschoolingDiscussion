<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133101885">personal experience: <br/>
my sister was labeled dyslexic and pushed through school. She dropped out at sixteen. She was functionally illiterate until the age of 22 when a friend helped her learn to read. It took her about two months of occasional lessons for her to learn to read. After that all it took was time spent reading for her to reach an adult level of reading ability. <br/>

One painful year I was a teacher&#39;s aide for 7th and 8th grade special<br/>
education students, along with 2  7th/8th grade WhizKid Latin classes.<br/>
There was this absolutely gorgeous child, a young boy, in the special ed<br/>
class who I worked with for 6 weeks trying to get him to learn to read. (not<br/>
to read, but to attempt learning to read)  He kept saying, &quot;Miss Lisa I<br/>
can&#39;t learn to read.&quot; I kept saying YES YOU CAN, if you just stop telling me<br/>
you CAN&#39;T.  He would listen to me and then say,  &quot;I can&#39;t learn to read.&quot;<br/>
One day I sort of lost it and spent 30 minutes telling him that he didn&#39;t<br/>
have to listen to everything ever teacher ever said that he could to learn,<br/>
he just hadn&#39;t YET.... but there were tons of things to do to learn about<br/>
words and reading and making sense of stuff.  He just shook his head.   He&#39;d<br/>

<br/>
The special education teacher agreed with the child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I worked with one boy who, at the age of 13, in 7th grade, asked me to help <br/>
him learn to read.  I was his reading teacher.  That&#39;s a story I don&#39;t even <br/>
want to think about.  But I offered to work with him.  Not one trick I knew <br/>
helped one tiny bit.  I truly think that in the same way some kids cannot and <br/>
will never match a musical tone, and some kids cannot and never once ever <br/>
will catch a ball, that this one kid (who was a nice human) could not learn <br/>
to read.<br/>
<br/>
It is also very possible that three or five years later, something in him <br/>
changed and he could.  But in that season of his life, with someone calmly <br/>
and in friendly-fashion trying to help, not one dent was made in his <br/>
inability to recognize a word he had just seen.<br/>
<br/>
I remember him picking a book to work on, listed at 2nd grade level (again, I <br/>
shudder at memories...) and it was a pretty cool version of the Three Billy <br/>
Goats Gruff.<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;goat&quot; was never once recognized or sounded out, no matter how many <br/>
times it appeared on the same page.  <br/>
<br/>
Now with more experience I would *maybe* have come up with another two or <br/>
three ideas to try, but it could possibly have been some physical/biochemical <br/>
reality.<br/>

              I hada similar experience in high school. I truly did not understand algebra2 in the way it was being taught--(not quite sure just why I took it--it was of no interest to me). I got a D in the class. My dad wanted me to ask the teacher for help. I refused--the teacher constantly belittled kids and some cried. I refused to be treated that way.  Shortly before this, I had realized that what I was doing in school was irrelevant--that there was a whole world to explore--out of the box.<br/>

  &gt; An illiterate adult often has so much &quot;garbage&quot; from having been labeled<br/>
  in<br/>
  &gt; school that more time is spent teaching him/her that they CAN learn to<br/>
  read<br/>
  &gt; then actually teaching reading skills.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; No, I don&#39;t have references to cite.<br/>
<br/>
  One painful year I was a teacher&#39;s aide for 7th and 8th grade special<br/>
  education students, along with 2  7th/8th grade WhizKid Latin classes.<br/>
  There was this absolutely gorgeous child, a young boy, in the special ed<br/>
  class who I worked with for 6 weeks trying to get him to learn to read. (not<br/>
  to read, but to attempt learning to read)  He kept saying, &quot;Miss Lisa I<br/>
  can&#39;t learn to read.&quot; I kept saying YES YOU CAN, if you just stop telling me<br/>
  you CAN&#39;T.  He would listen to me and then say,  &quot;I can&#39;t learn to read.&quot;<br/>
  One day I sort of lost it and spent 30 minutes telling him that he didn&#39;t<br/>
  have to listen to everything ever teacher ever said that he could to learn,<br/>
  he just hadn&#39;t YET.... but there were tons of things to do to learn about<br/>
  words and reading and making sense of stuff.  He just shook his head.   He&#39;d<br/>
  already learned that one lesson.......<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  that he couldn&#39;t learn<br/>
<br/>
  and that was that.<br/>
<br/>
  The special education teacher agreed with the child.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Yeah, see? You can DO stuff, just not stuff that has the LABEL &quot;math&quot; <br/>
because <br/>
then it&#39;s sort of blocked. But your self-image, after all this time, says <br/>
you&#39;re not math proficient until you stop and look at it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I never used those &quot;subject area&quot; labels with my kids.  The way <br/>
school divides and labels things, if a kid hates timed arithmetic drills <br/>
(from an example here), he might reject all patterns and number puzzles and <br/>
geometry and such.  Or if someone&#39;s afraid of the way formulas are written <br/>
out and they don&#39;t understand the explanation, they might think any thoughts <br/>
they have in their heads that don&#39;t look like the notation in the books is <br/>
wrong, or not useful, or not math.<br/>
<br/>
If a child cannot stand biology (from squeamishness or an aversion to weird <br/>
textures or whatever), that doesn&#39;t mean that botany or geology or astronomy <br/>
or animal husbandry (don&#39;t cut them up and look at their stomach linings, <br/>
just track their genetics and study breeds and breeding) wouldn&#39;t be the <br/>
coolest thing in their world.  But school and environs ask questions like &quot;Do <br/>
you like science?&quot;  And the answer is yes, I like all science, or NO, I <br/>
don&#39;t.     It seems that most people making chitchat with kids don&#39;t want a <br/>
real answer.  They want simple dialog, nothing deep or challenging.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-827302455">Johanna, I have to comment on this because I had a very similar experience and this became a topic of discussion with our kids a few months back. It was the example I gave as we were talking about watching what you say to others, whether you are a child or an adult, because what you may think is a passing comment, the person it&#39;s directed at just may take it to heart. <br/>
<br/>
This whole scene is so clear in my mind. I relive it every time I tell it. I was in fourth grade and we had just moved to Lafayette, La. My parents are active church-goers and &quot;encouraged&quot; me to join the children&#39;s choir, so I did. The director for that grade was having all of the kids sing one song out of the hymnal acapella to determine where you fell on the scale, alto, soprano, etc. We were able to pick the song, so I picked one of my favorites--Love Lifted Me, which is not an easy song for a fourth grader, I found out. Regardless, after I had sung the first verse, the director told me in front of the rest of the choir that I would be better off mouthing the words. Needless to say, I was crushed. <br/>
<br/>
But, you know what? That&#39;s exactly what I did--all through grade school and high school! I was in the church choir for all those years and NEVER sang a note! By the time I hit high school, I had a bestfriend that was also an alto (how can you say I was when I never sang?). She had a strong enough voice for both of us and she knew my secret and kept it for me. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until two years ago when my youngest was born that I began to sing to her--lullabies at first, then children&#39;s songs, then in the car....now I even sing at church in the congregation. There are times when I wonder if I sound okay to the person standing next to me and I begin to worry. Lucky for me, it&#39;s usually my husband and he always tells me I sound great. Who knows if I really do? I don&#39;t care, because I love music and love to sing!<br/>
<br/>
What a valuable lesson on the power of words....<br/>
<br/>

to a song or not, my life mate is a musician and he sings beautifully (I <br/>

house LOL), but I do love to sing. My son has a beautiful voice, he hasn&#39;t <br/>
reached the age where its changed yet and its high yet low :) my daughter <br/>
(oldest) has all the right moves when she sings and I just think its so cool <br/>
when we do break out in song and vocally blast :) I wanted to do Bohiemian <br/>
Rhapsody at the talent show this year and my mom said &quot;that song is just <br/>
awful and you will get laughed off the stage(she only likes country,and <br/>
nothing else), I personally think if we did it would be awesome!!! I have <br/>
visions of flashlights under the chin and singing the song, I just love that <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471760740">YEP! That&#39;s my mil! She has a friend and his wife that play bluegrass in a band. She went to their rehearsal one Friday evening at their house. She commented that Nelson and two of the band members were tapping their feet to the music, but Nelson&#39;s wife just played without moving. My mil, on the other hand, said her whole body couldn&#39;t sit still! Both her feet and hands were tapping along! She can&#39;t understand how anyone can listen to music and just sit still without at least tapping their feet!! <br/>

  &gt;Now, my mother-in-law, on the other hand, really *can&#39;t* carry a tune in a <br/>
  &gt;bucket, but she doesn&#39;t know that and no one has ever told her (or ever <br/>
  &gt;will), because she was a member of a group like the Sweet Adelines at one <br/>
  &gt;time. I&#39;m sure they cringed occasionally, but her enthusiasm makes up for <br/>
  &gt;the notes that she misses....she loves to sing so much and has music <br/>
  &gt;surrounding her constantly--all types, gospel, barbershop, contemporary, <br/>
  &gt;etc. It&#39;s hard to be around her and not be infected! What a wonderful love <br/>
  &gt;affair---<br/>

  &gt;   &lt;&lt; We were able to pick the song, so I picked one of my favorites--Love<br/>
  &gt;   Lifted Me, which is not an easy song for a fourth grader, I found out.<br/>
  &gt;   Regardless, after I had sung the first verse, the director told me in <br/>
  &gt;front<br/>
  &gt;   of the rest of the choir that I would be better off mouthing the words.<br/>
  &gt;   Needless to say, I was crushed.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Hey, I know that song. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Big range, and hard intervals.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   They should have had an accompanist, for real.  The adults in church are<br/>
  &gt;   never expected to sing a capella.  Weenies.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   &lt;&lt;Lucky for me, it&#39;s usually my husband and he always tells me I sound <br/>
  &gt;great.<br/>
  &gt;   Who knows if I really do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Well...<br/>
  &gt;   THEY do.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   I have friends who sing very softly if at all because they&#39;ve been told<br/>
  &gt;   (years ago) that they were off or not great singers.  What they&#39;re <br/>
  &gt;singing<br/>
  &gt;   softly is fine, but they&#39;re afraid to make it full voice.<br/>

BTW, I wanted to thank you off-list but I don&#39;t know <br/>
how - I&#39;ve heard people talking about &quot;taking it off-<br/>

Have you heard Weird Al&#39;s version?<br/>
I think it&#39;s Bohemian Polka.  <br/>

Same words, but the music is much happier!  Your mom might like it!<br/>

We love Bohiemian Rhapsody and Queen in general here. I think it would be <br/>
awesome too. I have never heard of the polka version. Kind of glad too :)<br/>

Interesting question, why all the illiteracy if it<br/>
comes so easily?  I think in large part we are talking<br/>
about damage done by the educational system that makes<br/>
these people not WANT to read or do math or what have<br/>
you.  They have been thoroughly abused and turned off<br/>
to it.  Many of them may also be suffering from<br/>
unrecognized reading and/or learning disabilites that<br/>
makes it very difficult for them to learn by<br/>
traditional methods.  These people often have been<br/>
kicked around by the system and now lack the self<br/>
esteem to believe that they are even CAPABLE of<br/>
learning.  <br/>
<br/>
My next door neighbor is one such person. We live in a<br/>
middle class neighborhood with older homes.  Altough<br/>
she is a mother with school age children, and they own<br/>
their own home, she apparently thinks very little of<br/>
herself.  She told me she went through public school<br/>
here in this town and she is completely illiterate. <br/>
When I suggested that maybe she could learn with her<br/>
daughter (then in Kindetgarten) she dismissed the<br/>
notion, saying she was &quot;Too Old&quot;.  She marveled that<br/>
we had a computer, as though it was something only<br/>
rich people had.  She was amazed that we were<br/>
homeschoolers, finding that outside her realm of<br/>
experience.  I think this kind of ignorance and low<br/>
self image work together to keep people like my<br/>
neighbor miserably pigeon holed where the system told<br/>
her she ought to be.<br/>
