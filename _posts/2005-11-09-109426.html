<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643247672">I just wanted to thank everyone who posted their stories about <br/>
unschoolers who learned to read well later.  I am an unschooler but <br/>
still enjoyed all the wisdom and encouragement.  My son didn&#39;t read at <br/>
all until he was 9, and he is now 11.  I know that by &#39;school <br/>
standards&#39; they would say he is still &#39;below grade level&#39; whatever that <br/>
means....  I just wanted to say that sometimes I worry, will he ever <br/>
read well enough to ________(various stupid things he may never care <br/>
about anyway).....  All the posts have calmed my worry.  I&#39;m glad he <br/>
never knew I was worried.  It just feels good to be trusting him again.<br/>
<br/>
There is a quote from Maya Anjelo (I think) that I really like that <br/>
might inspire those moving toward unschooling.  &quot;I always did the best <br/>
I knew to do, but when I knew better, I did better.&quot;  <br/>

 &quot;I always did the best I knew to do, but when I knew better, I did better.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I use that quote often with my older son because I knew no better at one time. His younger brother is getting those benefits because I figured it out: I know better now, so I DO better.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
But unfortunately, some people can hear/read the truth and be in a position to do better, yet fail miserably and keep trying to make their kids read. They do NO better. Nor do they really want to.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
~Kelly, who apologizes to the list for getting so frustrated---but I saw no way this mother was going to change the way she was dealing with her son. I&#39;m ALL FOR helping newbies get to unschooling---I&#39;m Billy Graham, remember?---but I refuse to put out that much effort to help someone keep on keeping on with Rod and Staff or Abeka or Bob Jones. I know the discussion probably helped others, but this woman was not going to embrace unschooling just to get her kid to read. Waste of time.<br/>

<br/>
Once Pat Farenga was speaking at a state homeschooling convention in the SE <br/>
U.S.   (honestly, I forget which state, but maybe North Carolina?   Could be <br/>
wrong...) and was speaking to a HUGE room, like 2000 people he said.   When he <br/>
said that children needed to be able to say no, needed to be able to make <br/>
choices about their learning, half of those 2000 people stood up and walked out.   <br/>
He told me that story at the Sacramento airport and I wish I had gotten better <br/>
details; sorry.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m ALL FOR helping newbies get to unschooling---I&#39;m Billy Graham, <br/>
remember?----=-<br/>
<br/>
Having grown up Baptist, I&#39;m very familiar with The Reverend Billy Graham, <br/>
and for those who are not, let me assure you he does NOT say &quot;Take your time <br/>
coming to Jesus--no hurry.&quot;   He doesn&#39;t say &quot;I respect that your beliefs are <br/>
different from mine, and that&#39;s valid.&quot;   &lt;g&gt;   He says &quot;You can accept Jesus <br/>
right now, or you can burn in hellfire forever. It&#39;s your choice.&quot;   I don&#39;t <br/>
think Kelly means she&#39;s Billy Graham in THAT way... &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
-=-I know the discussion probably helped others, but this woman was not going <br/>

<br/>
If it helped others, it wasn&#39;t a waste of time.<br/>
And it&#39;s not a waste of time for Susan either, because the ideas won&#39;t leave <br/>
her head.   For good or for ill, she will be choosing what might once have <br/>
seemed a &quot;no choice&quot; situation.<br/>
<br/>
If kids should be able to say no, homeschooling moms can too.<br/>
Unfortunately, that&#39;s unlikely to trickle down to the nay-saying mom&#39;s <br/>
children.   :-/<br/>
<br/>
People can take a LITTLE time to get to unschooling, but children are older <br/>
every moment of every day, and someday it&#39;s too late.<br/>

Giving a child choices was not considered &quot;Better&quot; by them.   It was so <br/>
abhorrent a thought that they wouldn&#39;t even stay in the room with someone who <br/>
advocated it.<br/>

I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s lucky it was a face to face experience.  In cyberspace <br/>
he&#39;d likely have been heckled, which would have interrupted and slowed <br/>
his planned speech, and that would have been a disservice to the other <br/>
half of the audience.<br/>
