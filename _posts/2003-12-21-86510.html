What are some good books for an 8 year old (That reads pretty good) to read? <br/>
Can he just read Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Yo books and Game Manuals and be OK????? <br/>
I would like, in a perfect world, for him to be reading the Classics! haha! <br/>
Maybe someday!?!<br/>
At that age, my kids liked books like:  the &quot;If You Lived&quot; series, and the <br/>
Magic Tree House series (about kids time traveling to different historical <br/>
times).  My son started getting into Star Wars books a lot, I think he was older <br/>
than 8 when he started.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with reading <br/>
Yu-Gi-Yo, etc.  There are lots of ways that people who are more experienced than me <br/>
could probably suggest that you could help your son make Yu-Gi-Yo into a <br/>
classical study of some kind...<br/>
<br/>
The way I got my kids into classics is by reading to them.  We read Aesop&#39;s <br/>
Fables, classic children&#39;s poetry, hand picked fairy tales (some of these are <br/>
so graphicly gross and depressing, that we skipped them), and lots of folk <br/>
tales from different countries (again hand picked, usually).   Also, short stories <br/>
by Tolstoy, O. Henry, Twain, etc.  The Just So Stories by Kipling are great <br/>
for an 8 year old!   There are tons of great Newbury books, but many of them <br/>
have death as a major theme, which my kids didn&#39;t really like at that age, <br/>
except in smaller doses.  There is also Swiss Family Robinson, and a host of <br/>
stories like that.  I found that the kids loved classics if I read to them, but the <br/>
vocabulary was often too much for them to do on their own.  By reading to <br/>
them, we could discuss what they didn&#39;t understand, and they soon grew to love <br/>
discussing the ideas in the book, and their ideas about those ideas.  This has <br/>
become a really important and wonderful ritual for us - it takes more time than <br/>
if they read on their own, but it&#39;s worth every minute.   They are now reading <br/>
classics on their own, but I&#39;m still reading to them, again, above their <br/>
literacy level - now we&#39;re into adult classics.  My son was skeptical at first, <br/>
but I didn&#39;t continue reading something that was obviously boring him (he hated <br/>
&quot;Hiawatha&quot; but laughed his head off at &quot;Just So Stories&quot;) - I was willing to <br/>
drop stuff without finishing it if there was little interest, and keep looking <br/>
for something that would grab him.     <br/>

their reading level. I used to bring home a stack of books from the library <br/>
that I thought Lars would like. I would read him the blurbs about the <br/>
books, and then he&#39;d pick. Only rarely would he decide he didn&#39;t like the <br/>
book. And only once did I give up on one. (Ivanhoe)<br/>

Probably not on this list, though. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anime, and it&#39;s written form manga, have been a big source of reading <br/>
pleasure for Conor. He retells me the stories and some of them are <br/>
really complex and historically and mythologically based. (Japanese <br/>
history and mythology of course.) It&#39;s easy to find Pokemon or YuGiOh <br/>
books at any major bookstore. Be sure to check out unfamiliar manga <br/>
beforehand though. Some of them have quite adult themes and <br/>
illustrations.<br/>
<br/>
Right now Conor, at age 14, reads manga, comics, Wired magazine, <br/>
Popular Science, reference books he picks up off our bookshelves late <br/>
at night, graphic novels and the occasional series of fantasy novels <br/>
like Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl or His Dark Materials. When he was 8 <br/>
he was labelled as learning disabled in school and struggling through <br/>
reading lessons. When I pulled him out of school he finally was free <br/>
to come to reading in his own time. He liked comic books the best to <br/>
start.<br/>

can&#39;t go by the look of the characters!<br/>
<br/>
But just because something&#39;s rated 8+ doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s of interest to an 8<br/>
yo. The rating indicates what&#39;s lacking more than what&#39;s there. And the<br/>
Japanese are more comfortable with nudity than Americans.<br/>
<br/>
You might try Shonen Jump. It&#39;s a great big fat 300 page monthly manga with<br/>
5 different on-going manga in it for only $5 ($2.50/issue if you subscribe).<br/>
(One of them is Yu-Gi-Oh.) I&#39;ve even see it in our grocery store magazine<br/>
rack but definitely any larger book store will carry it (though it&#39;s late in<br/>
the month and they might be out). It&#39;s rated for older teens I think but<br/>
that&#39;s because it&#39;s full of fighting. But the stories are well crafted. I<br/>
actually read it to Kat and we&#39;re both enjoying it.<br/>

Sounds like a good subscription for Conor. I&#39;ll have to check it out. <br/>
We buy some manga, but they can be expnsive! Luckily our new library <br/>
stocks lots of titles. :o)<br/>

<br/>
They are actually an ongoing story. They&#39;re easy to follow out of <br/>
order, but there&#39;s a kind of mystery/task that the main characters <br/>
are doing if you follow the series through. He might like to check <br/>
them out of the library starting with volume 1 at some point. Casey <br/>
loves them and we own &#39;em all. <br/>
