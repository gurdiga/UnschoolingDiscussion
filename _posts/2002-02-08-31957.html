 The Call at Midnight<br/>
 By Christie Craig<br/>
 We all know what it&#39;s like to get that phone call in<br/>
 the middle of the night. This night&#39;s call was no<br/>
 different. Jerking up to the ringing summons, I focused on<br/>
 the red illuminated numbers of my clock. Midnight.<br/>
 Panicky thoughts filled my sleep-dazed mind as I grabbed<br/>
 the receiver.<br/>
 &quot;Hello?&quot;<br/>
 My heart pounded, I gripped the phone tighter and eyed<br/>
 my husband, who was now turning to face my side of the bed.<br/>
 &quot;Mama?&quot; I could hardly hear the whisper over the<br/>
 static. But my thoughts immediately went to my daughter.<br/>
 When the desperate sound of a young crying voice became<br/>
 clearer on the line, I grabbed for my husband and squeezed<br/>
 his wrist.<br/>
 &quot;Mama, I know it&#39;s late. But don&#39;t...don&#39;t say<br/>
 anything, until I finish. And before you ask, yes, I&#39;ve<br/>
 been drinking. I nearly ran off the road a few miles back<br/>
 and...&quot;<br/>
 I drew in a sharp shallow breath, released my husband<br/>
 and pressed my hand against my forehead. Sleep still<br/>
 fogged my mind, and I attempted to fight back the panic.<br/>
 Something wasn&#39;t right.<br/>
 &quot;And I got so scared. All I could think about was how<br/>
 it would hurt you if a policeman came to your door and said<br/>
 I&#39;d been killed. I want...to come home. I know running<br/>
 away was wrong. I know you&#39;ve been worried sick. I should<br/>
 have called you days ago, but I was afraid...afraid...&quot;<br/>
 Sobs of deep-felt emotion flowed from the receiver and<br/>
 poured into my heart. Immediately I pictured my daughter&#39;s<br/>
 face in my mind and my fogged senses seemed to clear. &quot;I<br/>
 think -&quot;<br/>
 &quot;No! Please let me finish! Please!&quot; She pleaded,<br/>
 not so much in anger, but in desperation.<br/>
 I paused and tried to think what to say. Before I<br/>
 could go on, she continued. &quot;I&#39;m pregnant, Mama. I know I<br/>
 shouldn&#39;t be drinking now...especially now, but I&#39;m scared,<br/>
 Mama. So scared!&quot;<br/>
 The voice broke again, and I bit into my lip, feeling<br/>
 my own eyes fill with moisture. I looked at my husband who<br/>
 sat silently mouthing, &quot;Who is it?&quot;<br/>
 I shook my head and when I didn&#39;t answer, he jumped up<br/>
 and left the room, returning seconds later with the<br/>
 portable phone held to his ear.<br/>
 She must have heard the click on the line because she<br/>
 continued, &quot;Are you still there? Please don&#39;t hang up on<br/>
 me! I need you. I feel so alone.&quot;<br/>
 I clutched the phone and stared at my husband, seeking<br/>
 guidance. &quot;I&#39;m here, I wouldn&#39;t hang up,&quot; I said.<br/>
 &quot;I should have told you, Mama. I know I should have<br/>
 told you. But when we talk, you just keep telling me what<br/>
 I should do. You read all those pamphlets on how to talk<br/>
 about sex and all, but all you do is talk. You don&#39;t<br/>
 listen to me. You never let me tell you how I feel. It is<br/>
 as if my feelings aren&#39;t important. Because you&#39;re my<br/>
 mother you think you have all the answers. But sometimes I<br/>
 don&#39;t need answers. I just want someone to listen.&quot;<br/>
 I swallowed the lump in my throat and stared at the<br/>
 how-to-talk-to-your-kids pamphlets scattered on my<br/>
 nightstand. &quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; I whispered.<br/>
 &quot;You know, back there on the road, after I got the car<br/>
 under control, I started thinking about the baby and taking<br/>
 care of it. Then I saw this phone booth, and it was as if<br/>
 I could hear you preaching about how people shouldn&#39;t drink<br/>
 and drive. So I called a taxi. I want to come home.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;That&#39;s good, Honey,&quot; I said, relief filling my chest.<br/>
<br/>
 My husband came closer, sat down beside me and laced his<br/>
 fingers through mine. I knew from his touch that he<br/>
 thought I was doing and saying the right thing.<br/>
 &quot;But you know, I think I can drive now.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;No!&quot; I snapped. My muscles stiffened, and I<br/>
 tightened the clasp on my husband&#39;s hand. &quot;Please, wait<br/>
 for the taxi. Don&#39;t hang up on me until the taxi gets<br/>
 there.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;I just want to come home, Mama.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;I know. But do this for your mama. Wait for the<br/>
 taxi, please.&quot;<br/>
 I listened to the silence in fear. When I didn&#39;t hear<br/>
 her answer, I bit into my lip and closed my eyes. Somehow<br/>
 I had to stop her from driving.<br/>
 &quot;There&#39;s the taxi, now.&quot;<br/>
 Only when I heard someone in the background asking<br/>
 about a Yellow Cab did I feel my tension easing.<br/>
 &quot;I&#39;m coming home, Mama.&quot; There was a click, and the<br/>
 phone went silent.<br/>
 Moving from the bed, tears forming in my eyes, I<br/>
 walked out into the hall and went to stand in my sixteen-<br/>
 year-old daughter&#39;s room. The dark silence hung thick. My<br/>
 husband came from behind, wrapped his arms around me and<br/>
 rested his chin on the top of my head.<br/>
 I wiped the tears from my cheeks. &quot;We have to learn<br/>
 to listen,&quot; I said to him.<br/>
 He pulled me around to face him. &quot;We&#39;ll learn.<br/>
 You&#39;ll see.&quot; Then he took me into his arms, and I buried<br/>
 my head in his shoulder.<br/>
 I let him hold me for several moments, then I pulled<br/>
 back and stared back at the bed. He studied me for a<br/>
 second, then asked, &quot;Do you think she&#39;ll ever know she<br/>
 dialed the wrong number?&quot;<br/>
 I looked at our sleeping daughter, then back at him.<br/>
 &quot;Maybe it wasn&#39;t such a wrong number.&quot;<br/>
 &quot;Mom, Dad, what are you doing?&quot; The muffled young<br/>
 voice came from under the covers.<br/>
 I walked over to my daughter, who now sat up staring<br/>
 into darkness. &quot;We&#39;re practicing,&quot; I answered.<br/>
 &quot;Practicing what?&quot; she mumbled and laid back on the<br/>
 mattress, her eyes already closed in slumber.<br/>
 &quot;Listening,&quot; I whispered and brushed a hand over her<br/>
 cheek. </span></blockquote></div>
