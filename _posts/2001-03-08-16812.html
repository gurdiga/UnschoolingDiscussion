Dear Everyone,<br/>
I not only dyed my family I also made them think they were dying at the<br/>
same<br/>
time.  One night at dinner my husband happened to mention that he was<br/>
glad<br/>
he was feeling ok because when he had used the restroom that morning he<br/>
had<br/>
&quot;produced&quot; blues and green colors he had never seen before.  He had<br/>
thought<br/>
he was coming down with the latest flu, but nothing had materialized ! <br/>
My<br/>
kids chimmed in that they were experiencing the same colorful deposits ! <br/>
I<br/>
had made a beautiful birthday cake for dinner the previous night that had<br/>
used a rainbow of Wilton color food dyes,  but the primary ones were blue<br/>
and green.<br/>
<br/>
As for dying my children, when my youngest was in kindergarten they had<br/>
to<br/>
come to school the next day  and participate in crazy hair day. I decided<br/>
to<br/>
add glitter to his hair.  I knew that Elmers school glue would disolve<br/>
even<br/>
after it was dried so I used a bit of glue in his hair and added alot of<br/>
glitter.  I learned that night at bath time that the glue would dissolve,<br/>
but the glitter would not come out.  It sticks to your scalp and does not<br/>
come off. I even held my poor son upside-down in the water hoping that<br/>
the<br/>
water would &quot;float&quot; the glitter out since having him sit directly under<br/>
the<br/>
faucet wasn&#39;t doing a bit of good.  I &quot;dunked&quot; him till my arms ached,<br/>
but<br/>
the glitter stayed.  It was in his hair for months.  Thank goodness he<br/>
had a<br/>
personality that could take the teasing and my husband just chalked it up<br/>
to<br/>
another one of my crazy ideas.<br/>
