<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not totally sure what you mean by guidance here. I offer my children <br/>
guidance each and every day. That&#39;s what I consider good parenting. I answer <br/>
their questions, strew interesting and new things and ideas in their paths, <br/>
talk to them, offer suggestions when appropriate, and try to be a sought <br/>
after guiding force in their lives. I&#39;m sure you do the same with your kids. <br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
As far as the label of unschooler goes, however, I guess I take that as the <br/>
freedom to let go of society&#39;s idea of what an education should look like. I <br/>
don&#39;t want to be my children&#39;s teacher, I want to be their mom. I don&#39;t <br/>
require, suggest or guide them into activities that are considered <br/>
educational. We join activities that are fun, interesting, exciting or <br/>
useful. In that process, the educational just happens.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;does this sound like some sort of unschooling?  Or am I way off???&gt;&gt;<br/>

there if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after. :o) If you&#39;d like a glimpse at a totally <br/>

folks here. It&#39;s just a few steps different than what you&#39;ve described.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, that&#39;s really how I&#39;ve defined our homeschooling style, almost to <br/>
the letter.  I&#39;ve used the term &#39;unschooly&#39; since I know we don&#39;t quite <br/>
classicaly fit the true definition.  We&#39;re obviously a lot closer to <br/>
unschooling than &#39;schooling at home.&#39; (at least in my opinion.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever be true unschoolers, and I&#39;m comfortable with <br/>
that.  Just like everything else in my life, I don&#39;t find it necessary to fit <br/>
everything into &#39;a box&#39; or do it just as prescribed by others to be happy or <br/>
comfortable with our approach and outcome.  I&#39;ve always gone with my heart <br/>
(definitely a true &quot;Attachment Parent&quot;) and followed our own path.  I find <br/>
circles of acquantainces where we embrace each other for our unique <br/>
perspectives and paths and are supportive of such.  <br/>
<br/>
So, is an &#39;almost there&#39; unschooly and open-minded homeschooler still welcome <br/>
to lurk and also contribute and question???  LOL<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, yes, I definitely think so. <br/>
<br/>
However, I do think the difference between unschooling and &quot;almost-there<br/>
unschooly&quot; is qualitative. I think a line is crossed and there&#39;s a whole<br/>
paradigm shift, so a problem that exists for an &quot;almost-there unschooly&quot;<br/>
family might disappear when the family is truly unschooling, and a<br/>
solution that works for an  &quot;almost-there unschooly&quot; family might be<br/>
inappropriate to suggest to someone who is truly unschooling.<br/>

philosophy.  The die-hards are excited about it because of the effect of <br/>
really trusting kids and really trusting how learning works.  And it&#39;s sad to <br/>
see people who are interested but won&#39;t take that one more step to where it <br/>
WILL work.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m figuring it&#39;s sad like being a midwife and knowing a woman is fully <br/>
capable of having a natural birth, but she insists she WILL try a natural <br/>
birth as long as she just has an epidural and you do an episiotomy, and she&#39;d <br/>
like for it to be in a hospital, and she&#39;d like to have a monitor.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t have everything.  and you can&#39;t have unschooling work if you <br/>
reserve a half hour a day for seatwork.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling is a philosophy and like all philosophies<br/>
sometimes it takes a us a while to embrace it. <br/>
Somtimes we have to experience trial and error to see<br/>
what is best for us and our kids.  If you think seat<br/>
work is right, maybe that is where you are suppose to<br/>
be at this time.  I think unschooling is also about<br/>
being open to change, being open when something isn&#39;t<br/>
working for your family, being open to hearing about<br/>
what works for another.<br/>

<br/>
We have tried public school (1 year and 6 months), then we went to<br/>
homeschooling, on a schedule, using Oak Meadow curriculum, where I actually<br/>
timed how long we worked, kept all their work, etc.<br/>
Last year, we tried a public school allotment program, and this year, we are<br/>
going to attempt complete unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It is very much a process that I have gone through, each step being as<br/>
important as the one before.  Watching my children grow, and their unique<br/>
interests unfold is why we are constantly evolving in the growth proceess.<br/>
Noone is right, and noone is wrong.  There are public school children that<br/>
thrive, there are rigid homeschoolers that thrive, there are complete<br/>
unschoolers that thrive.<br/>
<br/>
The same evolution has happened with our diet, with our personal hobbies,<br/>
with everything in life that we are all about.  You try things, and see what<br/>
works the best, and go with it until it is time for a change.  Everyone has<br/>
their own paths, and very unique family energy to work with on oh, a minute<br/>
by minute basis.<br/>
<br/>
My great grandma always said, &quot;Take what you want and leave the rest&quot;  That<br/>
is how I try to live.<br/>

would not talk about being &quot;almost there&quot;.<br/>

fits into a box, or as something prescribed, like a *how to* kit. You can <br/>
learn everything in the whole wide world by going to school, doing <br/>
school-at-home and seat work, or you can learn everything in the whole wide <br/>
world by going out into the whole wide world. School will teach you physics <br/>
and art, unschooling allows you to discover the physics in art. School and <br/>
any type of prepackaged, boxed item can teach you anything. The problem is <br/>
school doesn&#39;t have the time to teach how everything flows seamlessly <br/>
together, whereas, the absence of school, the *un*, frees you to find that <br/>
flow. School draws a circle around a predetermined body of information and <br/>
says this is it! You can look inside that circle and look out and say NO! All <br/>
of that (pointing outside) is IT! I guess most of us don&#39;t see unschooling as <br/>
a label, more like that proverbial coat of many colors. <br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a here of there thing, it isn&#39;t all or nothing, you can&#39;t be here <br/>

love. A modern day Bohemian existence, following the natural, seamless flow <br/>
of life. You can continue to sit in a box, looking outside and seeing more of <br/>
the same and unschooling as being just another box to fit into, or you can <br/>
see that there really is no box at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092505727">Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
I am new to the list but have been lurking for a few days. I hope you<br/>
don&#39;t mind I am going to jump right in with a question.<br/>
 <br/>
Can anyone remember back to when their oldest was almost four (or are<br/>
you there now)? I LOVE the idea of unschooling, but my ds isn&#39;t much of<br/>
a social butterfly, which is ok, but it can be hard to just *be* when he<br/>
wants me to be his playmate. Often he seems board and then asks to put<br/>
the tv on, or when he is playing he will get defensive, loud and rough<br/>
with is younger brother. While it is irritating, I do feel bad for him<br/>
because I know given the choice he would rather be playing with close<br/>
friends and running around the house with them and burning off energy.<br/>
It is unfortunate that their mothers feel it is necessary for their<br/>
children to be carted around all day and &quot;being productive&quot;. I guess I<br/>
am looking for suggestions on how to meet both of our needs. He is<br/>
pretty particular about what setting he likes and mostly asks to go home<br/>
whenever I am doing something I enjoy (like meeting with other<br/>
homeschoolers he wont even try to get to know). Just going to the park<br/>
doesn&#39;t really work because he just sits next to me wanting me to play<br/>
(I guess I am doing the same to him, LOL). But I really don&#39;t want to<br/>
hear him yelling anymore (mostly because I don&#39;t want his little brother<br/>
to feel it is ok to be yelled at all day and pushed around) and I want<br/>
us all to be happy without me dictating our day to avoid conflict!  Any<br/>
suggestions.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks so much, I am really enjoying reading so far!<br/>
 <br/>

What wrong with doing what they are doing if that is working for <br/>
their family?  If everyone is happy then let it be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041326719">Maybe he just wants your attention.  When my kids were<br/>
that age they wanted to be like my husband and I.  My<br/>
son constantly wanted to go to the office with his dad<br/>
or they wanted to hang out with me at home.  So I<br/>
involved them in my day to day stuff.  Also, I got<br/>
puzzles and board games they would be interested in or<br/>
even just sat with them and watch a TV show.  Because<br/>
I have four children, I had a date night with each one<br/>
once a month or so.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is a common belief that children want other<br/>
children to play with when they are bored, but I think<br/>
what they really want is us and our attention<br/>
especially at a young age.  So my suggestion is sit<br/>
down and play with him whatever he wants to play.<br/>

  kind of like  Hogwarts with many modes of transportation for getting<br/>
  here, and many doorways to enter, decorated with appropriate sayings and gargoyles.<br/>
<br/>
  And appropriately, staircases that change their destination while one is on them, so that you&#39;re never quite sure where you&#39;re going to end up!   Great analogy, Betsy!   Debi<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Conor was 4 he definitely liked me best of all as his playmate. He did <br/>
go to a play-based nursery school, though, and had a lot of fun with that. <br/>
It was only a couple of hours a week and it was all play and he loved it. <br/>
The rest of the time though, I was his first choice.<br/>
<br/>
I do remember thinking I would go mad if I had to play Ninja Turtles, Power <br/>
Rangers or dump truck one more time! LOL But I also remember feeling <br/>
incredibly honored that he was choosing my company.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Often he seems board and then asks to put the tv on,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>SO let him watch TV. There are so many cool shows on , why not mellow out <br/>
with it while Mom recharges her batteries. Or you can watch too and you&#39;ll <br/>
both find something neat.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I want us all to be happy without me dictating our day to avoid conflict!  <br/>
&gt;&gt;Any suggestions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With kids that young, I really needed to be right in there with them  to <br/>
help them with their conflicts. I was helping them with their day, bringing <br/>
out interesting stuff to do, taking them to places I thought they&#39;d like. At <br/>
this age I believe that&#39;s what they need, a life very close to home, with <br/>
mom as the hub. If park days and homeschooling groups aren&#39;t working then <br/>
I&#39;d skip them for awhile and go for what is working.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. They grow up so fast, this stage will pass quickly enough and <br/>
you won&#39;t regret having spent too much time with them.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
