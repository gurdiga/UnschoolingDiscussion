I think it&#39;s significant that the Hegeners are hugely visible, publish a <br/>
magazine, have lots of kids, have moved in and out of the state (back and <br/>
forth from Alaska a time or two? and other?) and the state hasn&#39;t &quot;come after <br/>
them.&quot;<br/>

I registered for the first few years, in New Mexico, but after the first <br/>
testing year (when we didn&#39;t show up for tests and didn&#39;t get in trouble), I <br/>
decided not to anymore.  Nobody has said a word, and I don&#39;t sneak around at <br/>
all.  I&#39;ve been interviewed in the paper, by a local TV station and put on <br/>
the news, have articles published, am quoted, and nobody (who would?  clerks <br/>
at the public school office?) has thought &quot;Hmmm.... is she registered?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All the problems I&#39;ve ever heard of have to do with people&#39;s hostile <br/>
relatives (ex husbands, in-laws, the grown daughter of a second marriage when <br/>
the wife was younger than she was, in a case in northern New Mexico) have <br/>
turned them in--have ASKED for the schools or social services to harrass the <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
There is a slight possibility, worth considering, that in the same way some <br/>
people are approached by bad guys in parking lots and some aren&#39;t (the <br/>
profile alluded to in another conversation), maybe a large show of public <br/>
bravado is less appealing to someone who wants to check up on a  looking both <br/>
ways at the bookstore before trying to get a homeschooling discount with no <br/>
paperwork, etc. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t bother to try to get homeschooling discounts.  I was given a 20% off <br/>
card at borders by an employee who knew me.  Sometimes when they ask if I&#39;m a <br/>
teacher I say &quot;homeschooler&quot; and they either will or won&#39;t give me a <br/>
discount.  I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;m already saving so much money not having to pay <br/>
for school lunches and replacing lost jackets and buying &quot;cool&quot; binders and <br/>
notebooks and clothes that paying full price for books is nothing.  Anyway, <br/>
we usually get used books (AND clothes, and binders and notebooks!!)<br/>

  Hi Sandra;<br/>
  Thank you so much for posting this. I, too, am a &quot;closet&quot; homeschooler because I don&#39;t want to deal with the restrictions. So far, so good...<br/>
