<div id="ygrps-yiv-131472818">&quot;So, if you came here to learn from those who have gone before you <br/>
then by all <br/>
means, pull up a chair! But please, don&#39;t point fingers because the <br/>
comfort <br/>
level of what is being offered is beyond what you can take. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was very well put Nancy, you articulated the exact frustration <br/>
I&#39;ve been feeling.<br/>
I&#39;ve learned so much by being out of my comfort zone and having my <br/>
posts &quot;picked apart&quot; over the last couple of years.<br/>
It takes a strong fortitude to be able to examine oneself and admit <br/>
you could be doing something a lot better. Especially as related to <br/>
parenting/home/unschooling....but the results are wonderful.<br/>
It pays to remember that the people that ruffle our feathers <br/>
sometimes, are the ones that have lived the unschooling lifestyle for <br/>
a long time. The experience and the time spent with older kids and <br/>
how unschooling fits into all of that, is knowledge worth gold in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
