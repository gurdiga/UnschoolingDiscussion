<div id="ygrps-yiv-338345588">Wish to act as our own private highschool for our own children.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone here know if it is legal in Ont., Can. for a homeschooling <br/>
family or families to function as a private school without <br/>
registering with the Ministry of Education?  Anyone done this and <br/>
been admitted to an Ontario college or university without having to <br/>
write a SAT or ACT?<br/>
Thanks, Trish</div>
