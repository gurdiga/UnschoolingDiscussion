<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552437477">Since my accident and subsequent surgery my daughter has shown little to no <br/>
interest in anything but watching movies, is spacey and my boys have been a <br/>
bit hyper and it is getting to be quite a long amount of time. How would you <br/>
suggest nudging them/her towards something besides movies? BTW I am doing PT <br/>
3 times per week 2 hours each time and am moving around on crutches and brace <br/>
still, I am getting better but this still seems like forever ya know? TTFN! <br/>

I would leave it alone until you&#39;re better and able to do things with them.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like forever to you, but not to the kids.  I look back and October <br/>
when I was stuck on the couch for a month and I remember it seemed like an <br/>
eternity.  A horrible eternity.  But I&#39;m about to walk upstairs and start <br/>
dinner, and I could even go out and get firewood if I wanted to.  I&#39;ve driven <br/>
twice today.  It wasn&#39;t forever.<br/>
<br/>
Adding stress by complaining to the kids about what they&#39;re choosing to do <br/>
won&#39;t help anyone, I don&#39;t think.  Can you watch the shows with her and have <br/>
conversations?<br/>
<br/>
Movies aren&#39;t &quot;just movies&quot; like books aren&#39;t &quot;just books.&quot;<br/>

&gt; After  I recovered from a car accident, I realized how my 3 children <br/>
&gt; suffered.<br/>
&gt; My concern is that the children here are showing signs as in term (spacey)<br/>
&gt; I should have asked someone to help the kids out, but didn&#39;t. Ask a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>relative<br/>
or close friend if the kids can be with them for an hour or two.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t let the movie thing go on consistantly. Take care of you.<br/>
