<div id="ygrps-yiv-668704944">I feel a need to ask:<br/>
<br/>
This post (below) seems to beg for a response. Since the subject offers a<br/>
wide open door for suggesting all sorts of methods of helping &quot;folks&quot;<br/>
acquire some degree of literacy in order to participate in &quot;the economy,&quot; I<br/>
am asking permission to respond, since my previous post triggered theirs and<br/>
their assumption seems to be that a communal/ institutional education<br/>
establishment is needed, and that implies political activity.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we all read that the Cannons are fresh off a &quot;grass-roots&quot; campaign<br/>
either for or against a state income tax (TN is one of nine states that<br/>
don&#39;t have such a tax and it was defeated again last month) so they are<br/>
admittedly political animals, so to speak, especially since they posted<br/>
links to Nolan charts and such. Heck, they said they could post enough<br/>
political stuff to &quot;highjack&quot; the list. Imagine that. Where would they get<br/>
such an idea?<br/>
<br/>
So, there&#39;s a warning here, the proposed discussion could be just a bit<br/>
uncomfortable for some, in fact it could turn into a midnight cat fight,<br/>
but there&#39;s also some meat on this bone, if it&#39;s thrown up for grabs, and<br/>
the group might get off on it -- unschoolin&#39; at its finest. After all it&#39;s<br/>
August, the dog stays under the porch, the pond went dry and the alfalfa is<br/>
just turnin&#39; blue waitin for the swather.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the Cannons have posed two big questions. Several books have been<br/>
written about both of them already with no end in sight, so literacy is no<br/>
trifling matter. Maybe they&#39;re just pulling our chain, hoping to see some<br/>
more fur fly. In fairness though, they aught to be taken seriously, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Before I take a crack at it, I&#39;m asking for permission. I&#39;ve promised not to<br/>
be militaristic (never liked the army anyway) so I&#39;ll be kind as a Sunday<br/>
School teacher (which I was once, and the pianist to boot), but the ideas<br/>
(like Hell and Religion that were so well attended) might raise a cockle or<br/>
two. <br/>
<br/>
Whaddya say Joyce? If you say NO, I&#39;ll be OK with listening to the others.<br/>

PS I had no idea that &quot;wussy&quot; was an insult to women.  Sorry &#39;bout that.<br/>
I thought it was another word for lilly-livered, timid.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it not in my best interest to live in a society in which most<br/>
&gt; of the folks have some degree of literacy and are prepared to<br/>
&gt; participate in the economy?  ...and is there any efficient way to<br/>
&gt; achieve the goal without some communal/institutional educational<br/>
&gt; establishment?<br/>

&gt; | Since Tia brought it up, I&#39;ll try to be brief and not to<br/>
&gt; grandstand:<br/>
&gt; |<br/>
&gt; |  About school, someone wrote that that many people seem to<br/>
&gt; think as follows:<br/>
&gt; |<br/>
&gt; | &gt;&gt;the gov&#39;t needs to make sure that it&#39;s &quot;done&quot; to all<br/>
&gt; children.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; |<br/>
&gt; | That, in a nutshell, is the view that&#39;s called, &quot;The Public<br/>
&gt; Good.&quot;<br/>
&gt; | It&#39;s the idea behind mountains of bad laws that take money from<br/>
&gt; everyone and<br/>
&gt; | give it to special interests. (public school is the biggest<br/>
&gt; special interest<br/>
&gt; | group in the country) It&#39;s the excuse that schoolers use when<br/>
&gt; they intrude<br/>
&gt; | into the practices of homeschoolers. It means that the state<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t trust<br/>
&gt; | us to do it, even though it fails miserably, as we all agree.<br/>

with emails of only limited interest and argument people will be upset for<br/>
me for being so lenient. If I say no I&#39;m a big bad censor. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;ll go with what *Helen* has said and in light of the recent<br/>
discussion, err on the side of freedom. Anything goes that relates to<br/>
unschooling. (Which is basically anything.) Just be respectful of what<br/>
people joined the list for which is to (writing this on the fly so don&#39;t<br/>
anyone etch it in stone!) discuss the nuts and bolts of putting unschooling<br/>
into practice.<br/>
<br/>
(And saying this just as an observation as a poster I think anything can be<br/>
discussed without it taking over the list if it&#39;s done keeping in mind there<br/>
are people here with a low tolerance of misinformation. ;-)<br/>
