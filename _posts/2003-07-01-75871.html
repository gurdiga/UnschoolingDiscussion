<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You don&#39;t have any dates yet for that do you?   I was wondering what part <br/>
&gt; of August you&#39;re looking at.   I think we might plan a little trip up to <br/>
&gt; Canada(PEI) after.   I&#39;m already trying to pull a new homeschooler with me to MA,  <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s teterring toward unschooling! &lt;g&gt;   This week she mentioned that she <br/>
&gt; wanted to go to Prince Edward Island the beginning of September and I said,  <br/>
&gt; &quot;well, you should come to the next unschooling conference!  And we can go up <br/>
&gt; after that!&quot;.   My conniving little mind.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kelli~who is still counting down the days &#39;til this year&#39;s one.  45 days <br/>
&gt; until we leave!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why, yes, in fact, I &gt;DO&lt; have dates!  It is ending up in August because all <br/>
the other times would have doubled the cost of the conference.<br/>
<br/>
So...Keep the following dates clear:<br/>
Live & Learn New England Conference<br/>
August 27-29 in Peabody, Massachusetts<br/>
<br/>
There will be cool extras, like a Whale Watch, etc. <br/>

  Ahhhh, that is too cool!   How much closer could it get to September!  Wahoo!<br/>

    I&#39;m sure that would be lots of fun. We&#39;ll have to check it out. Thanks!<br/>

    Sounds great! I&#39;m glad to hear I&#39;ll be able to get to Boston easily.<br/>
We&#39;ll probably have to take 2 weeks. LOL! We&#39;ll see how the $$ pans out. So<br/>
much to do and see. Thanks again. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think you&#39;ll have a good time. Peabody is very near Boston, Salem, etc.<br/>
&gt; Without too much drama, you can get public transportation into Boston so you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have drive there, and it&#39;s a lot less expensive than staying in the<br/>
&gt; city. <br/>
&gt; And if you want, you can get into Southern Maine in less than two hours.<br/>

Let us all know when you have a web site or something.  We are planning to be <br/>
there.  I grew up in Maine and so want to show the boys the Boston area and <br/>
make a trip home before or after the conference.<br/>
Can&#39;t wait.<br/>
