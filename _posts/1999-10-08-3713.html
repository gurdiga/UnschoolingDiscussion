&gt; An Obsession with Trains, an Obsession with Life<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By Melanie Shimokawa<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everything that comes out of my two-year-old*s mouth is about trains.<br/>
&gt; Often, when he is just staring out into space, I ask him what*s on his<br/>
&gt; mind.  &quot;Trains!&quot; he answers.  Of course.  He knows everything there is<br/>
&gt; to know about Japanese trains.  He can recognize any Japanese train just<br/>
&gt; from a simple picture.  When he asks me to draw trains for him, he often<br/>
&gt; has to correct me.  &quot;No, Mama,&quot; he says, &quot;the yellow Seibu-Shinjuku line<br/>
&gt; trains with the GRAY doors have TWO pantographs every OTHER car.  The<br/>
&gt; ones with the yellow doors only have ONE.&quot;  Oh, right, sorry.  (But<br/>
&gt; that*s pretty advanced math for a two year old.  Especially when he<br/>
&gt; tries to figure out how many pantographs are on a certain train with a<br/>
&gt; certain number of cars.)  He spends a lot of time drawing trains.<br/>
&gt; They*re not always recognizable, but he works and works at it until he*s<br/>
&gt; drawn every detail he can think of.  The lines aren*t straight, and it*s<br/>
&gt; definitely not to scale, but he thinks of everything.  (That*s art.)  He<br/>
&gt; knows which trains run on which line, and where those trains run on the<br/>
&gt; map of Japan we have up in his room.  (That*s geography.)  He is<br/>
&gt; learning to read the names of the trains in his books we have bought<br/>
&gt; him, and the ones he checks out of the library.  (That*s reading.)  The<br/>
&gt; other day was the last day for the 0 kei shinkansen kodama train, and we<br/>
&gt; read together in the newspaper about it.  Clipped it out, and put it up<br/>
&gt; on his wall.  He learned when it first ran, and that it was the fastest<br/>
&gt; train in the world at the time.  (That*s history.)  Whenever we ride the<br/>
&gt; trains, he tells everybody which train they*re riding and everything he<br/>
&gt; knows about the train.  (Field trips!)  He has lengthy conversations<br/>
&gt; with the train conductor on coffee break or anybody else who*s willing<br/>
&gt; to listen all about the various trains he*s ridden, and the trains<br/>
&gt; others have ridden.  (That*s socialization.  Did I miss anything?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He*s only two, and I*m not worried about his future right now.  Neither<br/>
&gt; is he.  He*s having too much fun in the present.<br/>
