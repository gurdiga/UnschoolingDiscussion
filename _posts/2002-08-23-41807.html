hysterical.  <br/>

Lego has a pirate ship, and check the breakfast cereal aisle, because my son<br/>
ate enough instant oatmeal eventually to get a free little set from lego.<br/>
There&#39;s also a lot of pirates in playmobile.<br/>
<br/>
DK&#39;s Eyewitness Books series has one on pirates.  I think there are several<br/>
nice ones from Usborne and Dover, too.<br/>

There&#39;s a coloring book on bucaneers.  I don&#39;t remember whether it&#39;s dover or <br/>
Bellerophon....    (google.com moment...)<br/>

<br/>
A link down below the pirate coloring book led here.  This is it.  We need <br/>
say no more.  This has *EVERYTHING* piratical, books, music, and a link to <br/>
&quot;non-book pirate items,&quot; the Pirate&#39;s Locker.<br/>

Playmobil pirate ship at a friend&#39;s house at Thanksgiving, and by <br/>
Christmas that was still the only thing they wanted. So we bit the <br/>
bullet and invested in the ship. The boys are 26 and 28 now, and when <br/>
they were at our house for Easter they dug out the (now absolutely <br/>
*huge*) box of assorted Playmobil toys, including the pirate ship, <br/>
and spent *days* playing with them with their four young daughters.<br/>
<br/>
Playmobil and Legos of all kinds are still the #1 favorites at our house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842585873">FUN Books has a section of pirate books and stuff in their catalog (obviously <br/>
they went through that kid phase, too &lt;g&gt;) including a special group at a 20% <br/>

When my youngest really got into pirates one of the things we found him was a <br/>
long narrow scarf that could be tied around his head. It was very <br/>
swashbuckling. &lt;g&gt; He still likes to wear it sometimes at ten, especially <br/>
while wearing his button down shirt printed with skulls and bones.<br/>

They also sell the Swallows and Amazon series of books by Arthur Ransome. Two of the tiles in the series are directly related to pirates - my kids loved me reading them aloud - &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; and &quot;Missee Lee&quot;..Leonie<br/>
