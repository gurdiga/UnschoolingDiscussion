<div id="ygrps-yiv-650103121">&lt;&lt;and DID is way out there on the end&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
exactly.  So if the two disorders are points on a continuum, is it possible<br/>
that a single causative agent is underpinning that continuum?  To my way of<br/>
thinking, that makes more sense than saying the disorders are two distinct<br/>
entities.  Or at least as much sense as psych types usually make.<br/>
