<div id="ygrps-yiv-466803568"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Over the last year when I would tell family and friends that we are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>homeschooling invariably the mothers would comment that they just &gt;couldn&#39;t<br/>
do it. That they couldn&#39;t spend all that time with their kids. And they<br/>
would ask where did I get all the energy to do it?<br/>
<br/>
Pam,<br/>
The majority of my family was supportive from the start.  The rest of my<br/>
family had to see results and now they are supportive.  But my friends and<br/>
strangers still make comments like this.  I have been called crazy,<br/>
misguided, and a saint.  My reply is that I love the company of my children.<br/>
 I&#39;d rather be with my children over outsiders anyday.  Now we deal with<br/>
people asking my kids if they like being homeschooled and it warms my heart<br/>
to hear them say yes and that they love being able to spend their days with<br/>
me!  I just find it sad when mothers tell me that they could never spend<br/>
that much time with their children.  It makes me sad for the children.<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>
