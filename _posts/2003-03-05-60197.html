&lt;&lt; There are drugs to keep you from being distracted. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yikes. I am SO lucky there was no Ritalin push when I was in school. It would <br/>
have ruined one of the best parts of me.<br/>
I find that although this trait can be frustrating when trying to clean...it <br/>
is a bonus when working on projects or multi-tasking.<br/>
I can have several things going at once and it doesn&#39;t stress me, I love the <br/>
stimulation. I like puttering here and there and keeping my interest level <br/>
high.<br/>
Right now I have about five writing projects going, planning for our <br/>
homeschool &quot;Funfest&quot;,  and working on a family recipe book. That&#39;s just my <br/>
personal stuff, not to mention all the kids projects and distractions.<br/>
I LIKE my ability to putter and mess about. It makes life interesting.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello all,<br/>
I&#39;m Tracy otherwise known as MooneDreamer and am<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling in NC. I have 3 DD ages 9 1/2, 7 and 3.{Hi<br/>
to anyone i know from other lists} I am {like Ren} trying to<br/>
incorporate unschooling into our whole lives not just including it<br/>
in what I see as their learning experiance. I dropped the<br/>
discription of myself as being the &quot;teacher&quot; long ago. :)<br/>
I have been listening and can only agree with the idea of things<br/>
that frustrate me in the end things would have been better if I<br/>
hadn&#39;t gotten so worked up. I am trying but I am a work in<br/>
progress.:b <br/>
I told the kids {after being encouraged from the list discussion as<br/>
well as general complaints from the hubbie about getting so worked<br/>
up about their room and other sorts of things} that I am trying and<br/>
I MAY fail {because I will have to retrain my thinking/reaction<br/>
patterns} but I will keep on trying. Because it is the environment I<br/>
want for them. :)<br/>
 Anyway, my mom was a lifer in the PS system and even after<br/>
retirement she still works as a sub. {as well as one of my sisters<br/>
has been a teacher for years now}. So growing up I saw the<br/>
&quot;background&quot; most don&#39;t see of the public schools. Teachers {before<br/>
they had even met students} looking at the folders that follow the<br/>
child and talking about how much trouble or how &quot;good&quot; a child is.<br/>
BTW I am not fond of any type of a label that follows children. A<br/>
good label only stereotypes a child just the same as a negative<br/>
label. And though that child may have more opportunities then a<br/>
child labeled &quot;uncooperative&quot; it still can do harm due to<br/>
expectations.<br/>
 My husband&#39;s grandmother was a secretary in the public school<br/>
system till her retirement, way back when. To say the least, our<br/>
families weren&#39;t impressed, especially at first. Though now, the<br/>
grandmother&#39;s mind {I think} has changed after seeing that my oldest<br/>
taught herself to read very fluently without pressure. She now brags<br/>
on how she helps her when she visits and they go shopping or when<br/>
driving. &lt;G&gt; Others have less to say as we go. My mom doesn&#39;t<br/>
pressure so much anymore, she doesn&#39;t like to debate me. I am a bit<br/>
hardheaded to say the least if I am protecting my freedom to raise<br/>
our children our way. LOL<br/>
Anyway about the Ritalin, before I was a solid homeschooler {as a<br/>
newbee without much experience and before we got our first computer~<br/>
oh about 4 or 5 years I forget LOL} my mom would say how she thought<br/>
my now middle DD needed it. NOT!! I already knew that was one of the<br/>
things they were not going to put in to their system. <br/>
I have heard so many negative things from my mom about kids and such<br/>
I think I was just afraid they might be next. I know I can never<br/>
teach {or should i say that she won&#39;t be willing to learn} new<br/>
tricks {aka her misconceptions won&#39;t completely fade about how kids<br/>
&quot;should&quot; be taught} and have all but given up trying to &quot;prove&quot; our<br/>
kids will be alright to others {mainly family both mine and my<br/>
husband&#39;s} They all have the same questions and comments over and<br/>
over no matter they explanation I give. Basically it is so simple it<br/>
is beyond them I suspect. And I just have the idea we will always be<br/>
looked upon as the black sheep. {my husband and I have always been<br/>
even before we met} LOL ~ With the {{tisk tisk}} attitude for our<br/>
kids. But hey, I can live with that. I live with them everyday and<br/>
know I am doing what&#39;s best for them.<br/>
Anyway, no, I am not new to unschooling and yes,sometimes I am<br/>
hesitant to use the term to describe our family. Mainly when I don&#39;t<br/>
want to argue or defend who/what I am generally to someone who<br/>
incorporates it in their whole lives, then I have thus far. IMHO<br/>
just not worth it in the end. I like the idea and have been<br/>
transcending over more and more but I don&#39;t think one can truly<br/>
change overnight. We just are who we are. I can see it has made me<br/>
personally less judgemental overall. Or maybe it is just having more<br/>
experience as a homeschooler in general. Whatever it is, that has to<br/>
be a good thing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Ok stepping down off my soapbox now! Sorry for the ramble. LOL<br/>
Tracy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     At the very core of usual and prevailing education, is the <br/>
characterization of the self of the child. On day one, they administer the <br/>
pre-test, and the results will undoubtably show &quot;ignorance&quot;. They then will <br/>
busy themselves with their program, their treatment, their nostrom, and then <br/>
after some suitable time they administer the post-test, which of course, <br/>
shows &quot;improvement&quot;. And with these &quot;results&quot;, they immediatlely justify and <br/>
secure the position and power of all the significant stakeholders: the <br/>
teachers, the counselors, the principals, the parents, the school board, the <br/>
community elders. <br/>
     And it would be a wonderful system indeed were it not for the two <br/>
crushingly brutal choices left to the child. They can remain &quot;ignorant&quot; (and <br/>
many do, they will stand up, right in front of you, and say &quot;we&#39;re the &#39;dumb&#39; <br/>
class&quot;), or they can become &quot;improvers&quot;. This central view of the child as an <br/>
&quot;improver&quot;, is at the heart of usual and prevailing education. The whole <br/>
system is built on this social construct, and it is the child who carries the <br/>
entire system when they throw away their own self and and become an <br/>
&quot;improver&quot;.<br/>
     They, of course, do not give up their own self willingly, but only after <br/>
acute and chronic invasion, assault, ridicule and shame.<br/>

This is true of schools, but doesn&#39;t apply to unschooling!<br/>
