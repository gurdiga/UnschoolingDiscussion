<div id="ygrps-yiv-21170502">&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t spank my kids because they don&#39;t do what I want them to do, I spank<br/>
  them because they willingly and knowingly break the rules.  We use spanking<br/>
  along with other consequences.  I do not hit my children, there is a<br/>
  difference &gt;&gt;<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
I am new to this topic because my computer has been down, but I wanted to add <br/>
my 2 cents worth here. ...<br/>
<br/>
In our house, we do not hit/spank our children.  We are replacing the word <br/>
spank with hit because they are both the same action, no matter what the <br/>
intent is behind it.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel I can not teach my children to control themselves, obeying the rules, <br/>
or not to hit others, by striking them myself, no matter what my intentions <br/>
are.  It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  Have my children been hit/spanked, <br/>
yes.  Sadly enough, they have.  I reget it deeply. I am struggling to <br/>
overcome the ways of my own childhood.  I am always looking for my parenting <br/>
tools for my tool bag.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, just my 2 cents worth....<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>

&quot;It helps me to remember that people are more important than ideas and that <br/>
being kind is more important than being right.&quot; <br/>
