<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904243825">I would be leary of these one-fits-all type of supplements (read also drugs/remedies/medicines). A lot of our Homeopathic Materia Medica comes from the toxic effects of substances that have been abused<br/>
because of the claims they advertise them with. Every woman is different, and so are her PMS symptoms. We don&#39;t all fit into this &quot;mold&quot; of lacking calcium.<br/>
It&#39;s again, just marketing to sell &quot;natural&quot; products.<br/>

&gt; years old!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; CORAL CALCIUM!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, we all know now about osteoporosis and bone<br/>
&gt; support, blood vessels and circulation, teeth and<br/>
&gt; how important good quality calcium is for dealing<br/>
&gt; with the above and more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I did not know that research says it might help<br/>
&gt; with such things as colon cancer and prolong your<br/>
&gt; life in general! That just BLEW ME AWAY!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This whole Coral Calcium thing is IMPORTANT for<br/>
&gt; every single woman on the planet. But, of course,<br/>
&gt; you already know that without me, right? :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, please, read the following article and share<br/>
&gt; it with everyone you care about or who you know has<br/>
&gt; any of the mentioned conditions and could profit<br/>
&gt; from the below information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enjoy! And let me know what you think, please.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With Love,<br/>
&gt; Barda<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.: For those of you who are interested in getting<br/>
&gt; some Coral Calcium of truly superior quality and at<br/>
&gt; an incredibly low price (that was discovered during<br/>
&gt; long and detailed search by your obedient servant :-),<br/>
&gt; there is a link and a code for you at the end of this<br/>
&gt; e-mail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once again, Enjoy! And stay HEALTHY and HAPPY!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Happy Holidays and Holydays! :-)<br/>

&gt; ====================================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -- The Okinawan Centenarian Study<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s the link to the Okinawa study, followed by<br/>
&gt; a brief summary and some additional stuff I&#39;ve run<br/>
&gt; across about calcium:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.okinawaprogram.com/&#39;&gt;<br/>
&gt; http://www.okinawaprogram.com/ &lt;/a&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; According to The Okinawan Centenarian Study,<br/>
&gt; every city, town, and village In Okinawa has a<br/>
&gt; family register system (koseki) that has been<br/>
&gt; recording reliable birth, marriage, and death<br/>
&gt; statistics since 1879. Life tables calculated from<br/>
&gt; this database show one of the world&#39;s highest<br/>
&gt; concentrations of centenarians and likely the<br/>
&gt; world&#39;s longest life expectancy for any country or<br/>
&gt; state.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After examining over six hundred Okinawan<br/>
&gt; centenarians and numerous &#39;youngsters&#39; in their<br/>
&gt; seventies, eighties, and nineties, the researchers<br/>
&gt; saw certain patterns begin to emerge. It became<br/>
&gt; clear that the Okinawan lifestyle was providing<br/>
&gt; some real, scientifically verifiable reasons these<br/>
&gt; people were so incredibly healthy so far into their<br/>
&gt; senior years. And they were reasons that could<br/>
&gt; have a profound impact on our health and well-<br/>
&gt; being here in the West.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; _________________<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Among the reasons for their longevity of life and<br/>
&gt; overall health cited by the study was &#39;the high<br/>
&gt; calcium intake by Okinawans in both food and<br/>
&gt; their natural drinking water.&#39; The coral calcium in<br/>
&gt; their water has played a key role.<br/>
&gt; _________________<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is right in line with numerous studies that are<br/>
&gt; beginning to point to the significant benefits of<br/>
&gt; calcium. In the October 13, 1998 issue of the New<br/>
&gt; York Times wrote an article appeared entitled<br/>
&gt; &#39;Calcium Takes Its Place As a Superstar of<br/>
&gt; Nutrients&#39; in which it reports that a study<br/>
&gt; published in the Journal of the American Medical<br/>
&gt; Association reported that &#39;increasing calcium<br/>
&gt; induced normal development of the epithelia cells<br/>
&gt; and might also prevent cancer in such organs as the<br/>
&gt; breast, prostate and pancreas&#39;. It also reported that<br/>
&gt; the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published<br/>
&gt; &#39;virtually no major organ system escapes calcium&#39;s<br/>
&gt; influence&#39; and that a research team from the<br/>
&gt; University of Southern California found &#39;adding<br/>
&gt; calcium to the diet lowered the blood pressure in<br/>
&gt; 110 black teenagers.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The January 14, 1999 issue of the Phoenix Republic<br/>
&gt; wrote an article about cancer entitled &#39;Calcium<br/>
&gt; Reduces Tumors&#39; that the New England Journal of<br/>
&gt; Medicine reported &#39;adding calcium to the diet can<br/>
&gt; keep you from getting tumors in your large<br/>
&gt; intestine&#39;. Then the February, 1999 issue of the<br/>
&gt; Readers Digest wrote in an article entitled &#39;The<br/>
&gt; &#39;Superstar Nutrient&#39; that the Journal of the<br/>
&gt; American Medical published &#39;when the participants<br/>
&gt; consumption reached 1500 milligrams of calcium a<br/>
&gt; day, cell growth in the colon improved toward<br/>
&gt; normal (this means that the cancer was reversed)&#39;.<br/>
&gt; The Digest also reported that the Metabolic Bone<br/>
&gt; Center at St. Lukes Hospital believes that &#39;a chronic<br/>
&gt; deficiency of calcium is largely responsible for<br/>
&gt; premenstrual syndrome (PMS)&#39; and that &#39;a lot of<br/>
&gt; women are avoiding the sun and their vitamin-D<br/>
&gt; levels may be very low.&#39;<br/>
