<div id="ygrps-yiv-331526648">Trevor, who keeps up on the industry quite well, says that Microsoft <br/>
was rushed to get their new system out ahead of the PS3.  He believes <br/>
they couldn&#39;t possibly get the glitches worked out and enough systems <br/>
made to fully supply stores the way they&#39;d like.<br/>
<br/>
No conspiracy there. He reads tech magazines and has been following <br/>
the Microsoft/Nintendo battle for supremacy for a while.<br/>
Yes, Microsoft loses money on every system. That&#39;s exactly what <br/>
they&#39;re trying to turn around with this one...they are struggling to <br/>
widen their market share. <br/>
It&#39;s all about when PS3 was scheduled to launch and their desire to be <br/>
ahead of that by a year. They were close.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-158968226">When I got my new Macintosh, which wasn&#39;t cheap, I got a printer/scanner that <br/>
WAS cheap--$50 with the rebate.   It works wonderfully well.   It makes a <br/>
direct color copy as beautifully as could be.   It will run really thin paper, <br/>
thick paper...     It was a good idea for them to practically give it to me, <br/>
because the ink cartridges cost a fortune. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If gaming systems hardly pay for the development and manufacturing and <br/>
packaging and shipping, no problem for the company.   The kids will buy controllers <br/>
and games, and in the case of XBox--XBox live is $50 per year per kid.   WELL <br/>
worth it, my kids&#39; opinions.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve whimpered about the cost of four ink cartridges, Keith reminds me <br/>
of the laser printer we bought 15 years ago that itself cost over $1000 and <br/>
each cartridge (black only--no color) was $90.   Then I remember this one&#39;s very, <br/>
very cool.<br/>
