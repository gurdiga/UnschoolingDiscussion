<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Bob <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm... determining the date of Easter has a pretty complex history if<br/>
you consider ORthodox and western Christian churches. From<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.agoc.org/Education/EASTER.html">http://www.agoc.org/Education/EASTER.html</a> comes this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The determination of the date of Easter is governed by a computation<br/>
<br/>
based on the vernal equinox and the phase of the moon. According to the<br/>
<br/>
ruling of the First Ecumenical Synod in 325, Easter Sunday should fall<br/>
<br/>
on the Sunday which follows the first full moon after the vernal<br/>
<br/>
equinox. If the full moon happens to fall on a Sunday, Easter is<br/>
<br/>
observed the following Sunday. The day taken to be the invariable date<br/>
<br/>
of the vernal equinox is March 21.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jews originally celebrated Passover on the first full moon following<br/>
<br/>
the vernal equinox. Christians, therefore, celebrated Easter on the<br/>
<br/>
first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox.<br/>
<br/>
After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. and the other tragic<br/>
<br/>
events which gave rise to the dispersal of the Jews, Passover sometimes<br/>
<br/>
preceded the vernal equinox. This was occasioned by the dependence of<br/>
<br/>
the dispersed Jews upon local pagan calendars for the calculation of<br/>
<br/>
Passover. As a consequence, most Christians eventually ceased to<br/>
<br/>
regulate the observance of Easter by the Jewish Passover. Their<br/>
<br/>
purpose, of course, was to preserve the original practice of<br/>
<br/>
celebrating Easter following the vernal equinox.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As an alternative to calculating Easter by the Passover, &quot;paschal<br/>
<br/>
(Easter) cycles&quot; were devised. The Orthodox Church eventually adopted a<br/>
<br/>
19?year cycle, the Western Church an 84-year cycle. The use of two<br/>
<br/>
different &quot;paschal cycles&quot; inevitably gave way to differences between<br/>
<br/>
the Eastern and Western Churches regarding the observance of Easter.<br/>
<br/>
Varying dates for the vernal equinox increased these differences.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, it is the combination of these variables which accounts<br/>
<br/>
for the different date of Orthodox Easter, whenever it varies from the<br/>
<br/>
rest of Christendom.</div>
