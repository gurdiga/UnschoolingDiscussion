Teresa,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember how old your kids are but a few suggestions came to mind.<br/>
<br/>
earplugs for dh<br/>
<br/>
headphones for the tv<br/>
<br/>
You sitting at the bottom of the stairs for a few nights, keeping the kids<br/>
from bouncing up the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
Having the kids get up with Dad for a few days so they can truly get a<br/>
picture of what he is trying to tell them about being so tired.<br/>
<br/>
You take the kids for a walk, or star gazing, or whatever to give dh a<br/>
chance to get to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on age of kids, telling them that you understand how they can get<br/>
wound up and you don&#39;t mind reminding them once but that you feel they are<br/>
not attempting to take Dad&#39;s needs into consideration.  They will need to do<br/>
that if they are to stay up.  If not, they simply will have to go to bed<br/>
when Dad does for a few days to give Dad a chance to catch up.  Then perhaps<br/>
you can try again if they want to.  I would consider all other possibilities<br/>
first.<br/>

really gotten some good things to go on..  Thanks for your suggestions as <br/>
well.   I knew it wasn&#39;t just black and white..I was just having a hard time <br/>
finding the shades of gray in between.<br/>
