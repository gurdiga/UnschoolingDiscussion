<br/>
I hope someone who replied did change it.<br/>
<br/>
Reading more of that article is very sad.  When people say homeschoolers <br/>
should stick together, what they must mean is that the right-wing Christians <br/>
cannot themselves defend their methods, so they want ALL homeschoolers to <br/>
work together to defend their right to keep their children isolated with <br/>
false history and made-up science.<br/>
<br/>
It does quite seem that many Christians have lied to create &quot;creation <br/>
science,&quot; and now they want to cajole, bully and shame all the homeschoolers <br/>
in the world to work to cover for them.<br/>
<br/>

The creationist movement also does not like to talk about the scientists who <br/>
leave after being given the opportunity to do real field research. In 1957, <br/>
the Geoscience Research Institute was formed in order to search for evidence <br/>
of Noah&#39;s Flood in the geological record. The project fell apart when both of <br/>
the creationists involved with the project, P. Edgar Hare and Richard <br/>
Ritland, completed their field research with the conclusion that fossils were <br/>
much older than allowed under the creationist assertions, and that no <br/>
geological or paleontological evidence of any sort could be found to indicate <br/>
the occurrence of a world-wide flood. (Numbers, 1992, pp 291-293) Hare <br/>
concluded, &quot;We have been taught for years that almost everything in the <br/>
geological record is the result of the Flood. I&#39;ve seen enough in the field <br/>
to realize that quite substantial portions of the geologic record are not the <br/>
direct result of the Flood. We have also been led to believe . . . that the <br/>
evidence for the extreme age of the earth is extremely tenuous and really not <br/>
worthy of any credence at all. I have tried to make a rather careful study of <br/>
this evidence over the past several years, and I feel that the evidence is <br/>
not ambiguous but that it is just as clear as the evidence that the earth is <br/>
round.&quot; (cited in Numbers, 1992, p. 294) Ritland, for his part, pointed out <br/>
that Morris&#39;s book The Genesis Flood contained &quot;flagrant errors which the <br/>
uninitiated person is scarcely able to detect&quot;. (cited in Numbers, 1992, p. <br/>
294) Ritland concluded that further attempts to justify Flood geology would <br/>
&quot;only bring embarrassment and discredit to the cause of God&quot;. (cited in <br/>
Numbers, 1992, p. 293) -=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044217639">I apologize for this long post.  I&#39;ve been thinking about it during <br/>
the last couple of days, and I know this topic could come up in just <br/>
about every home on this list.  But I don&#39;t want to flood the list <br/>
with a lot of short posts, even though they are easier to digest.  <br/>
<br/>
If I can summarize the sense of the following excerpts from two <br/>
recent posts, they are wondering if people who believe in a young <br/>
earth are obediently following a group of liars and bullies, without <br/>
thinking about the evidence at hand.<br/>

&gt;And then I wondered whether maybe it&#39;s easier to be a really good <br/>
&gt;fundamentalist when surrounded by people who are that way.  Most <br/>
&gt;people are sheep, not leaders.  And so if the sheep can&#39;t shake a <br/>
&gt;crook without hitting another fundamentalist &quot;shepherd,&quot; that&#39;s a <br/>
&gt;pretty tight pen. And I wondered whether the Bible Belt has little <br/>
&gt;hills covered over with green.  I wonder whether it&#39;s harder to be a <br/>
&gt;young earth proponent in a place like Utah or Colorado, with BIG <br/>
&gt;mountains.  Or in Europe, where even the local history is as nearly <br/>
&gt;as old as claims of young-earth creationists.<br/>
<br/>
Strong stuff to ponder.  I agree that &quot;most people are sheep, not <br/>
leaders&quot;.  Therefore, what we believe comes mostly from what others <br/>
tell us.  And when people actually dig into the facts, they are <br/>
sometimes surprised.  This is not only true for fundamentalist <br/>
Christians, but for most people of any religion or political <br/>
persuasion.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when one senatorial candidate (in 2000) came out for <br/>
abortion but against so-called partial birth abortion, three women <br/>
(ages 45, 70, and 82) asked my wife what partial birth abortion was.  <br/>
When she told them, they were shocked, and then they understood why <br/>
the candidate was against it.  Before that, as sheep they might have <br/>
been reading the media reports and thinking that only closed-minded <br/>
persons would be against this &quot;rare&quot; procedure.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the young earth old earth debate and creation science, <br/>
there are many resources on that, and they all sound convincing in <br/>
their own way.  No one really knows, since we cannot yet reproduce <br/>
the formation of the universe or the earth.  So it&#39;s all in whom we <br/>
choose to believe.  <br/>
<br/>
My purpose in this post is not to convince anyone of anything (I <br/>
would love to but I know I can&#39;t).  I just want to state that there <br/>
is enough evidence available in favor of a young earth and for <br/>
creation science (intelligent design, or whatever you&#39;d like to call <br/>
that type of study) so that you don&#39;t have to classify people who <br/>
believe it as liars, bullies, or unthinking sheep.<br/>
<br/>
For example, even on the highest mountaintops are found evidence of <br/>
shellfish (such as oysters). So presumably at some point those <br/>
mountains were covered by water.  Some scientists believe that at one <br/>
time those mountains were much lower.  Then they were covered by a <br/>
global flood, then pushed up to their current height.  There may be <br/>
other explanations, but that one certainly can be believed without <br/>
being classified as an unthinking sheep.<br/>
<br/>
For me (and I gather for the scientist Aimee Yermish -- but see her <br/>
article at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-</a><br/>
dotcom/message/46449 , because for obvious reasons she doesn&#39;t like <br/>
to be quoted out of context), the more important point is that we see <br/>
the creator as we look around us.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether it took <br/>
4.5 billion years or 4,000 years to create the earth, but we can <br/>
enjoy the results either way.  <br/>
<br/>
Some evolutionists have falsified evidence for their theory, and some <br/>
evolutionists insist on evolution as the only scientific way because <br/>
they do not want to believe in a creator.  The quest for evolutionary <br/>
evidence is fine as science, but wrong as a disproof(?) of a religion.<br/>
<br/>
For those on this list who would like to prepare themselves for <br/>
questions by their kids, or who wonder about this young-old earth <br/>
debate themselves, I did a little googling and came up with four <br/>
categories of sites, in support of various views:  comparison of <br/>
young-old earth in a fairly even-handed fashion, young earth, old <br/>
earth, and old universe-young earth.  Some of these sites will <br/>
probably back up your current beliefs, and others will challenge or <br/>
expand them.  If you have time, have a glance at the comparisons.<br/>

And what is a mountain? Basically a large mass of earthy that has been pushed <br/>

<br/>
&gt; Would you mind explaining to me what was explained by your wife?<br/>
&gt; I have a feeling it may be different from what my medical training <br/>
&gt;and further research into this subject taught. <br/>
<br/>
My wife explained the procedure as this site shows it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/diagram.html">http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/diagram.html</a><br/>
If she and the site are wrong, let me know and I will pass it on.  <br/>
(My wife doesn&#39;t get on the &#39;net.)  Since she has never seen one, I <br/>
am sure she would be glad to find it was different from this <br/>
description.<br/>
 <br/>
&gt;And  pro-choice people are not &quot;for abortion&quot;, they are against you <br/>
&gt;making decisions for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for clarifying that.  You are correct; this candidate was pro-<br/>
choice but would vote in favor of a law against partial birth <br/>
abortion. Your clarification helps explain how some statistics say <br/>
that 80% of Americans are generally against abortion but do not show <br/>
that percentage of pro-life voters.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; I just want to state that there is enough evidence available in  <br/>
&lt;&lt;favor of a young earth and for creation science (intelligent <br/>
&lt;&lt;design, or whatever you&#39;d like to call that type of study) so that <br/>
&lt;&lt;you don&#39;t have to classify people who believe it as liars, bullies, <br/>
&lt;&lt;or unthinking sheep. &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; Not in most scientists opinions, and certainly not in non-christian <br/>
&gt; scientists opinions.<br/>
<br/>
So, in your opinion, most credentialed, qualified scientists would <br/>
classify those who &quot;invented&quot; or currently support a young earth <br/>
theory or creation science as liars who bully people into believing <br/>
them? And you think those credentialed scientists (particularly all <br/>
non-Christian scientists) would classify people who believe either of <br/>
those theories as unthinking sheep?<br/>
<br/>
If you are speaking on behalf of them, and not only your own beliefs, <br/>
then you got that from somewhere other than your own knowledge, <br/>
right?  Would you share where?  Most newspapers and TV news and NPR <br/>
seem to share your belief.  But those media intentionally do not <br/>
publicize qualified credentialed scientists who either disagree with <br/>
evolution or support a young earth or creation theory.  It all gets <br/>
down to whom you believe.  <br/>
<br/>
I am willing to change my belief if you show me where you get yours <br/>
from, and the source is more credible than mine.  In the meantime, at <br/>
the bottom of this note I have included some web sites that say that <br/>
many qualified credentialled scientists do exist who do not buy the <br/>
evolutionary theory.  Some are non-Christians.  The sites seem honest <br/>
and credible to me, and there are quite a few others.<br/>
<br/>
My point was not to prove or disprove either view, but to state my <br/>
opinion that classifying a believer in young earth as an unthinking <br/>
sheep does not necessarily make sense.  I am a believer in young <br/>
earth and so are many of my acquaintances, but if you met them you <br/>
would not easily classify them as unthinking.  <br/>
 <br/>
  &lt;&lt; For example, even on the highest mountaintops are found evidence <br/>
&lt;&lt;of shellfish (such as oysters). So presumably at some point those <br/>
&lt;&lt; mountains were covered by water.  Some scientists believe that at <br/>
&lt;&lt;one time those mountains were much lower.  Then they were covered <br/>
&lt;&lt;by a global flood, then pushed up to their current height.  There <br/>
&lt;&lt;may be other explanations, but that one certainly can be believed <br/>
&lt;&lt;without being classified as an unthinking sheep. &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
&gt;And what is a mountain? Basically a large mass of earthy that has <br/>
&gt;been pushed upward due to movement of Teutonic plates. Of course <br/>
&gt;they would have them on top. The mountains were flat at some point <br/>
&gt;in our planets earlier life.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.  And I included this paragraph as evidence that a thinking <br/>
person can support a young earth and global flood.  The post that I <br/>
was responding to said this: &quot;And I wondered whether the Bible Be(lt <br/>
has l)ittle hills covered over with green. I wonder whether it&#39;s <br/>
harder to be a young earth proponent in a place like Utah or <br/>
Colorado, with BIG mountains.&quot;  It&#39;s a good point, and I think your <br/>
explanation of tectonic plates covers it:<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt; The quest for evolutionary evidence is fine as science, but wrong <br/>
as a disproof(?) of a religion &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Except &quot;Evolutionary scientists&quot; are not TRYING to disprove <br/>
&gt;religion, it&#39;s not even a part of the picture.  But &quot;Creation-<br/>
&gt;scientists&quot; ARE trying to disprove evolution. In order to &quot;prove&quot; <br/>
&gt;religion.<br/>
<br/>
Your latter statement is correct.  See site #2 at the bottom of this <br/>
post for a brief definition of creation scientists (not all literally <br/>
Bible-based).  On the former, I have seen statements in the past by <br/>
evolutionists who refuse to face the alternative if evolution is <br/>
wrong; if you are interested, I will look for them.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt; Some of these sites will probably back up your current beliefs, <br/>
&lt;&lt;and others will challenge or expand them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How about some sites by non-christians who did not set out to prove <br/>
&gt;that the bible is true?<br/>
<br/>
I thought I had done this, but this is a good question.  Of the four <br/>
categories of sites I found, the old earth category sites were all by <br/>
non-Christians who were not trying to prove or disprove the Bible, as <br/>
far I could tell.  The other three (young earth, gap, and comparison) <br/>
were coming from some form of belief in God and the Bible.  So <br/>
although I did include the sites you asked about in one category, are <br/>
you asking if I can find sites in the other three categories that are <br/>
not trying to prove the Bible, but came to these theories in other <br/>
ways?  If so, let me know and I will take a look.  <br/>
<br/>
In summary, the purpose of my post is to show that thinking people <br/>
can believe in creation or in a young earth, and there are scientists <br/>
who support these theories (and have throughout history).<br/>

Sites showing credentialed scientists who believe in creation follow, <br/>
along with excerpts from the text of each site:<br/>

How is it possible for reasonable, intelligent, well-educated people <br/>
to hold such diametrically opposite views as Evolutionism and <br/>
Creationism? Answer...<br/>

<br/>
A major goal of creation science is to point out the weakness of <br/>
evolutionary theory, because basically there are only two <br/>
alternatives for how we got here, and if naturalistic processes are <br/>
incapable of the task, then special creation must be the correct <br/>
answer. On the positive side, creation scientists are developing <br/>
alternative models and theories in many areas to help our <br/>
understanding of how the universe works. It should be noted that much <br/>
of day to day scientific activity is not heavily influenced by either <br/>
evolutionary or creation assumptions, but much scientific energy has <br/>
been wasted over the last century in the search for evolutionary <br/>
evidences and experimental proofs, which have been unsuccessful so <br/>
far and will continue to be. How much further might we be in some <br/>
areas of scientific understanding if a model of special creation had <br/>
been the working hypothesis? <br/>

<br/>
Despite strong pressure to accept evolutionism, many intelligent and <br/>
experienced scientists either openly or secretly dismiss Evolution as <br/>
highly unlikely or impossible. In the 1980s, researcher and lecturer <br/>
David Watson noted an increasing trend that continues today, <br/>
disturbing those who want evolutionism to be perceived as the <br/>
accepted scientific consensus...<br/>
<br/>
As Science Digest reported:&quot;Scientists who utterly reject Evolution <br/>
may be one of our fastest-growing controversial minorities... Many of <br/>
the scientists supporting this position hold impressive credentials <br/>
in science.&quot; 3 <br/>
<br/>
One example is the late Dr. Arthur E. Wilder-Smith, an honored <br/>
scientist with an amazing three earned doctorates. He held many <br/>
distinguished positions. 4 A former Evolutionist, Dr. Wilder-Smith <br/>
debated various leading scientists on the subject throughout the <br/>
world. In his opinion, the Evolution model did not fit as well with <br/>
the established facts of science as did the Creation model of <br/>
intelligent design. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Read lists of real scientists in many different fields who believe in <br/>
a literal creation. <br/>
<br/>
Today there are thousands of scientists who are creationists and who <br/>
repudiate any form of molecules-to-man evolution in their analysis <br/>
and use of scientific data. Creation scientists can now be found in <br/>
literally every discipline of science, and their numbers are <br/>
increasing rapidly. Evolutionists are finding it increasingly <br/>
difficult to maintain the fiction that evolution is &quot;science&quot; and <br/>
creation science is &quot;religion&quot;. When news media personnel and others <br/>
make such statements today, they merely reveal their own liberal <br/>
social philosophies-not their awareness of scientific facts.<br/>
<br/>
...this is a small sampling of real scientists from around the world <br/>
who believe in a literal creation. Nobody has ever taken a <br/>
comprehensive survey of the world&#39;s universities, research <br/>
organizations, etc. to find out who is an evolutionist or <br/>
creationist. Whether evolutionist or creationist, most scientists do <br/>
not get involved in the creation versus evolution controversy. Also, <br/>
many creationists keep their beliefs secret depending on the <br/>
situation for fear of discrimination, etc. </span></blockquote></div>

Mike, do you understand  why this procedure would be performed in the first <br/>

the Bible describes creation. But no, not necessarily as a literal <br/>

Two sites on partial birth abortion follow.  They are coming from a <br/>
certain viewpoint, but their statements can be checked on:<br/>
<br/>
1.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.abortiontv.com/PartiaBirthAbortionPerspective.htm">http://www.abortiontv.com/PartiaBirthAbortionPerspective.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
This description was written by seven doctors.  They say:<br/>
&quot;Partial-birth abortion is unsafe at any time, in any place. The <br/>
procedure uses techniques that are outdated and do not represent the <br/>
appropriate standard of care. Women have much safer options.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
2.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lutheransforlife.org/lifedate/1996/pba_myths.htm">http://www.lutheransforlife.org/lifedate/1996/pba_myths.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
MYTH #2 - Partial-Birth abortions are extremely rare, &quot;probably only <br/>
500 to 1,000 year&quot; (New York Times March 28,1996).<br/>
<br/>
The Truth: Written materials and recorded interviews with Dr. Martin <br/>
Haskell, who developed the procedure, indicate that he, along with <br/>
the late Dr. James McMahon of Los Angeles, were responsible for over <br/>
3,000 such abortions. A New York City doctor in a letter to Congress <br/>
stated that he has performed them routinely since 1979. Remember, <br/>
these are only those who have chosen to write or give interviews on <br/>
the subject.<br/>
<br/>
MYTH #4 - This procedure is done &quot;only in cases when the mother&#39;s <br/>
life is in danger or in cases of extreme fetal abnormality&quot; (News <br/>
release from Planned Parenthood, Nov.1,1995).<br/>
<br/>
The Truth: Abortionist Dr. Martin Haskell in his recorded statement <br/>
to American Medical News says that he &quot;routinely performs this <br/>
procedure on all patients 20 through 24 weeks&quot; and that 80% of these <br/>
are &quot;purely elective.&quot;</div>

It&#39;s very ugly.  And some who used to work with and for them have said it&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
No, it gets down to WHY you want to believe it.  Simply that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care where the earth came from.  I live where things look really, <br/>
really old.  If someone comes to the Rio Grande Valley and says &quot;all this <br/>
happened within 6,000 years&quot; I don&#39;t need an expert to look at him askance.<br/>

It doesn&#39;t matter how the world really got here or was really formed.  We&#39;ll <br/>
live 50 years, give or take.  Whether Christian or not.  But ing and making <br/>
much noise about it all.<br/>
<br/>
MOST Christians don&#39;t care if the world is 6,000 years old or not.  They are <br/>
still happy to love Jesus and serve God.  They are NOT desperate.<br/>
<br/>
Fundamentalists will also say they are not going to heaven.<br/>
<br/>

DO YOU REALLY believe that if evolution is wrong, that that makes the Bible <br/>
true?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that all questions have only two answers, God&#39;s and the Devil&#39;s?<br/>

There are thousands of possibilities.  <br/>

<br/>
There haven&#39;t been scientists throughout history, in one way of thinking.   <br/>

sphere, outside of which was heaven, it was easy for them to believe that the <br/>
square flat earth had flooded.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737834351">Here is a question I have, and it is one that stems from ignorance.  <br/>
<br/>
I do feel that there are reasons, in the last trimester, to terminate a pregnancy.  If the mother&#39;s health is in endangered by the pregnancy,, something that I believe should be determined by mom and doctor, than termination of the pregnancy seems correct.  <br/>
<br/>
However, what I don&#39;t understand is why termination of the pregnancy has to result in termination of the fetus.  Wouldn&#39;t it be healthier to try and dialate the womb, just enough to get the fetus out? After that, the baby could be given standard care for a premie... <br/>

I am not looking for a political debate, I am looking for an explanation.  I fear I am missing some detail...<br/>

Scientists (and some of them are Christian, though probably not Bible<br/>
literalists) see data and look for patterns. They build theories to explain<br/>
the patterns they see.<br/>
<br/>
Creationists *say* that scientists are fiercely fighting to protect<br/>
evolutonary and old earth theories. But if scientists are protecting<br/>
evolutionary and old earth theories over better evidence, why are they? What<br/>
advantage do those theories give them? And how is this conspiracy being<br/>
managed? It&#39;s not just &quot;evolutionary&quot; scientists holding their data in<br/>
secret, spitting out a theory they want everyone to believe to protect their<br/>
jobs. Evolution and old earth cut across many disciplines.  What do<br/>
astronomers and geologists care whether man evolved from apes or not? It<br/>
really makes no difference to astronomers whether the universe is 4000 or 15<br/>
billion years old. The theories cut across many religions, many countries,<br/>
many political boundaries. If there&#39;s some conspiracy to protect the<br/>
theories, it&#39;s got incredible cooperation among a huge number of scientists<br/>
that have no reason to support each other.<br/>
<br/>
But creationists, on the other hand, have a huge stake in proving<br/>
creationism: the foundation of their religion. Everything a creationist does<br/>
is filtered through the absolute certainty that his theory is right. If a<br/>
creationist turns up something that points to the Bible as being in error,<br/>
he&#39;s certain the data is wrong because the Bible can&#39;t be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no such pressure for scientists involved in biology, astronomy,<br/>
geology, nuclear physics. If one theory falls all it means is another theory<br/>
that will help them understand the universe a little better has come along.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nancy, I would like to know the truth about the procedure for partial <br/>
birth abortion (on or off this list, my e-mail is below).  It would <br/>
be interesting for me not only for clarification of the procedure <br/>
itself, but also to see how far astray I can be led by information on <br/>
false sites.  For me, it would prove Sandra&#39;s assumption that people <br/>
can be led like sheep without realizing it.<br/>
<br/>
This is not an abortion debate; the site refers only to the partial <br/>
birth abortion procedure, which is described as taking a live viable <br/>
baby out of the mother&#39;s body.  To me, that procedure is an example <br/>
of how supporters of abortion can be led to support extreme <br/>
procedures like sheep.  But if you say this site describes it <br/>
wrongly, then not only will I learn something valuable but it will <br/>
invalidate the example I used.<br/>
<br/>
As far as how often it is used (1%, you said), I have seen a number <br/>
of articles that say it is used far more often than that. I put two <br/>
in a recent post. Some of the statistics for frequency were cited by <br/>
doctors who have/had performed the procedure for years.  I am <br/>
interested in where you are getting your information that it is only <br/>
used occasionally.<br/>

This procedure is performed when the fetus is  not viable. In particular when <br/>
Hydrocephalus is present. This is when the brain cavity fills with <br/>
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The head may bcome as large as 20 in in diameter. <br/>
A normal adult head is 7-8 inches in diameter. Attempted delivery can kill a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818158649">Ok - I know I am going to offend someone out there -<br/>
and I have avoided this discussion - but I have to<br/>
throw in my opinion:<br/>
<br/>
The word Satan actaully means adversary - The SATAN is<br/>
a personification - if you look throughtout historical<br/>
literature you will see reference to him in things<br/>
such as Dante&#39;s Inferno - ideas that come about and<br/>
were melded together from all different religions,<br/>
ages and cultures. And here we are left with a red guy<br/>
with horns and a forked tale that tempts people to do<br/>
bad. I don&#39;t find I need any help in being tempted to<br/>
be &quot;bad&quot;. My own human make-up is enough to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I think using a &quot;Satan made me do it&quot; is a co-opt for<br/>
accepting the logical consquences of our own behavior.<br/>
We don&#39;t have to examine ourselves and see if we are<br/>
living up tp our true potential (as human beings) we<br/>
can blame it on Satan and in order to scare my<br/>
children from doing &quot;bad&quot; I can threaten them with<br/>
hell and tell them to &quot;watch out for Satan&quot;. If people<br/>
could just see that within all of us - there is the<br/>
ability to do both good and evil - <br/>
<br/>
And Hell is in the Bible - but if anyone ever bothered<br/>
to examine the linguistics of the words it is clear<br/>
that the original words have taken on meanings of<br/>
their own from culture and people trying to make sense<br/>
of life and spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
I am a believer in Christ. I read the Bible every day<br/>
- I know we all have differences of opinion on what<br/>
the Bible says - and some of us aren&#39;t beleivers in<br/>
the Bible. I am finding it hard to listen to the other<br/>
Christian voices on this list -  each of us has<br/>
his/her own &quot;truth&quot; - so to debate this all is not<br/>
fruitful.<br/>
<br/>
And on the Creation issue - When the Bible says the<br/>
&quot;world was without form and void&quot; who knows how long<br/>
it was like that. Geologists may very well be right.<br/>
Look at all the planets sitting there now - if God so<br/>
chose to create another &quot;earth&quot; out of one of them he<br/>
certainly could have done it.<br/>
<br/>
And who knows that God hadn&#39;t created a &quot;race&quot; before.<br/>
Where did the angels come from? They were there at the<br/>
beginning of creation. &quot;Let us make man in OUR image&quot;<br/>
It says God created the earth. the Hebrew word for God<br/>
is &#39;Elohim&quot; meaning mighty ones - plural. So some<br/>
plurality created the earth. AND I know some feel this<br/>
was Christ and God. But I think Mighty Ones is what it<br/>
says - and I think they were the angels. And then you<br/>
can only speculate where they came from. This is a<br/>
whole different topic. <br/>
<br/>
Ok - so my ideas may seem radical from the mainstream<br/>
Christianity - but I wanted to make it clear that<br/>
there is not even one Christian view - from those of<br/>
us that are believers in Christ. <br/>
<br/>
And I apologize to those that don&#39;t want to discuss<br/>
religion. It&#39;s one of those things that spark us to<br/>
speak though - isn&#39;t it ;-)<br/>

&gt; in a recent post. Some of the statistics for frequency were cited by <br/>
&gt; doctors who have/had performed the procedure for years.  I am <br/>
&gt; interested in where you are getting your information that it is only <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The 1% I stated refereed to women who have a partial birth abortion because <br/>
they didn&#39;t have it done earlier in their pregnancy. Partial birth abortions <br/>
for women who have complications causing their eminent death, or because a <br/>
fetus is not viable is common. Here is what I said. <br/>
<br/>
I noticed you put <br/>
quotation marks around the word rare, as if to imply that partial birth isn&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
really rare at all. It really is. It is rarely used in women who couldn&#39;t get <br/>
<br/>
an abortion in the first trimester, about 1%. It is used in women who have, <br/>
by amniocentesis, found that their baby isn&#39;t viable, for whatever reason, be <br/>
<br/>
it severe abnormalities or a death. <br/>
<br/>
Please refer to this site for information on partial birth abortions without <br/>
the gory pictures. <br/>

www.korrnet.org/choicetn/LateTermSmith3.html <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t like abortion, I don&#39;t know anyone who does. But I <br/>
support the right to make informed decisions based on correct and <br/>
knowledgeable facts rather than scare tactics. I don&#39;t think there is ever a <br/>
reason I would have an abortion, although the pro-life movement would surely <br/>
have me believe that I have had one. I support the right of a woman to make <br/>
her own decisions. And if you are pro-life, that is fine. Just please, please <br/>
stop using false and misleading (and gross) statements to prove a point. <br/>

I was really angry when I realized that a really good discussion on parenting <br/>
young children, on breastfeeding and attachment parenting was kind of <br/>
torpedoed by people saying not all homeschoolers believe in evolution.<br/>
<br/>
I think that we shouldn&#39;t let that happen anymore.  If an international <br/>
unschooling list wants to discuss the breastfeeding as being thousands or <br/>
hundreds of thousands of years old, I don&#39;t think we should apologize or take <br/>
it back.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a religious list.  This isn&#39;t Arkansas or Tennessee, and if anyone <br/>
DOES really object to the idea that we say &quot;mammals have nursed their babies <br/>
in dens at night since prehistoric times,&quot; I think we should refer them to <br/>
other lists where people don&#39;t want to be considered &quot;mammals,&quot; and we should <br/>
continue giving warm, comforting advice to troubled mothers.<br/>
<br/>
When I thought back about how that had gone I felt that a really BIG list had <br/>
been twisted away by two or three members.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Sandra,<br/>
Yes, we have been homeschooling each child since school-age, about <br/>
six years.  Our kids are 11, 9, and 7.  We also have a 20yo daughter, <br/>
married with two boys (2.5 and 1.5) in Texas.  I am 51 and my wife is <br/>
47.<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  You asked me similar questions in a recent post and I answered <br/>
in more detail:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-</a><br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you unschooling?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My wife is currently not unschooling, but she is getting fed up with <br/>
the army method of raising kids, so I am encouraging her to consider <br/>
a number of the methods and hints I&#39;ve read on this list. Her mother <br/>
became alcoholic in her 40s and her father was gone a lot (two-time <br/>
Air Force sergeant), so she didn&#39;t have a great role model.<br/>
<br/>
We have a 29yo daughter in Texas, happily married with two boys: 34 <br/>
months and 18 months. They are all coming to visit us soon. We also <br/>
have a girl 9 and two boys 11 and 7. They are lively, active, and <br/>
happy. They play well with other kids or among themselves.</div>
