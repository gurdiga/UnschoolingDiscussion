<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639486698">Hi Susan,<br/>
I can really sympathize with you!  Last year my son did an &quot;experiment&quot;<br/>
where he (unknown to me) stuffed toilet paper in the bathroom sink drain and<br/>
overflow hole, turned on the faucet full blast and closed the door.  Then he<br/>
suggested we play outside.  I, again unknowingly, agreed and three hours<br/>
later returned.  Once I felt the squishy carpet (10 feet down the hall) and<br/>
discovered the ocean of water streaming out of the bathroom down the hallway<br/>
and into the heating ducts, I was a screaming zombie!!!!  The water ruined<br/>
the subflooring, carpet and pad (throughout 3/4 of the house), ductwork and<br/>
swelled the doorjambs and drywall.  The damage was over 5 thousand dollars.<br/>
Thankfully insurance picked up a good deal of the &quot;experiment&quot;.  I asked him<br/>
later what he was trying to do...he said that he was trying to create an<br/>
ocean by closing the door.  Boy, at the time, school was sure looking good.<br/>
And there are other days when I think school doesn&#39;t look all that bad.  But<br/>
I must admit, that it was pretty smart of him (at four) to have noticed that<br/>
the water flows out better if you stuff it into the overflow hole!  But<br/>
seriously, I know that I would be having equally hard days (if not harder)<br/>
sending him off to school and all the issues that brings.  I so enjoy seeing<br/>
him grow and learn (and experiment--within reason!) and I would not want to<br/>
miss that for the world.<br/>
    I understand your frustrations.  It sounded like though that the day was<br/>
going really well up until that point.  Hang on to the treasures of the day.<br/>
We keep a short journal and write down tidbits of the day to reassure us<br/>
that we are on the right path.  Keep sharing your experiences with us...that<br/>
helps too.<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330857305">Oh, and I used to take the inners from my felt-tip pens and make <br/>
&#39;perfume&#39; in the bathroom sink.  I think I should have had to clean <br/>
it up, but Mum did stop buying me pens...<br/>
