  PM<br>Subject: I&#39;m Just A Mother<br><br><br>&gt;<br>&gt; I&#39;m Just a Mother? 
  Excuse Me???<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A few months ago, when I was picking up the 
  children at school,<br>&gt; Another mother I knew well rushed up to 
  me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Emily was fuming with indignation. &quot;Do you know what you 
  and I are?&quot;<br>&gt; She demanded.&nbsp; Before I could answer and I didn&#39;t 
  really have one handy<br>&gt; -<br>&gt; She blurted out the reason for her 
  question.&nbsp; It seemed she had just<br>&gt; Returned from renewing her 
  driver&#39;s license at The County Clerk&#39;s<br>&gt; office.<br>&gt; Asked by the 
  woman recorder to state her occupation, Emily had<br>&gt; hesitated,<br>&gt; 
  Uncertain how to classify herself.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;What I mean is,&quot; explained 
  the recorder, &quot;do you have a job, or are<br>&gt; you just a 
  .....?&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;Of course I have a job,&quot; snapped Emily. &quot;I&#39;m a 
  mother.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &quot;We don&#39;t list &#39;mother&#39; as an occupation. &quot;Housewife&#39; 
  covers it,&quot;<br>&gt; said the recorder emphatically.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I forgot 
  all about her story until one day I found myself in the same<br>&gt; 
  situation, this time at our own Town Hall. The Clerk was obviously a<br>&gt; 
  career&nbsp; woman, poised, efficient, and possessed of a 
  high-sounding<br>&gt; title like &quot;Official Interrogator&quot; or &quot;Town 
  Registrar.&quot;<br>&gt; &quot;And what is your occupation?&quot; she probed. What made me 
  say it, I do<br>&gt; not know. The words simply popped out. &quot;I&#39;m a Research 
  Associate in the<br>&gt; field of Child Development and Human 
  Relations.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The clerk paused, ball-point pen frozen in midair, 
  and&nbsp; looked up as<br>&gt; though she had not heard right.&nbsp; I 
  repeated the title slowly,<br>&gt; emphasizing the most significant words. 
  Then I stared with wonder as&nbsp; my<br>&gt; pompous<br>&gt; pronouncement 
  was written in bold, black ink on the official<br>&gt; questionnaire.<br>&gt; 
  &quot;Might&nbsp; I ask,&quot; said the clerk with new interest, &quot;just what you do 
  in<br>&gt; your field?&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Coolly, without any trace of fluster 
  in my voice, I heard myself reply,<br>&gt; &quot;I&nbsp; have a continuing program 
  of research (what mother doesn&#39;t) in the<br>&gt; laboratory and in the field 
  (normally I would have said indoors and<br>&gt; out).<br>&gt; I&#39;m working for 
  my Masters (the whole darned family) and already<br>&gt; Have four&nbsp; 
  credits (all daughters). &quot;Of course, the job is one of the<br>&gt; most 
  Demanding&nbsp; in the humanities (any mother care to disagree?) and 
  I<br>often<br>&gt; work 14 hours a day (24 is more like it).&nbsp; But the job 
  is more<br>&gt; challenging than most run-of-the-mill careers and the rewards 
  are in<br>&gt; satisfaction rather than just money.&quot;&nbsp; There was an 
  increasing note of<br>&gt; respect in the clerk&#39;s<br>&gt; voice as she&nbsp; 
  completed the form, stood up, and personally ushered me to<br>the<br>&gt; 
  door.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up by my glamorous 
  new career, I<br>&gt; Was greeted by my lab assistants - ages 13, 7, and 
  3.&nbsp; Upstairs&nbsp; I<br>&gt;&nbsp; could Hear our new experimental model 
  (6 months) in the child-development<br>&gt;&nbsp; program, testing out a new 
  vocal pattern.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp; I felt triumphant!&nbsp; I had scored a 
  beat on bureaucracy! And I had gone<br>&gt;&nbsp; On the official records as 
  someone more distinguished and indispensable<br>&gt;&nbsp; To mankind than 
  &quot;just another mother.&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp; Motherhood...what a glorious 
  career. Especially when there&#39;s a title on<br>&gt;&nbsp; the 
  door.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp; Send this to another Mother you know.&nbsp; 
  Whether a stay at home Mom or<br>&gt;&nbsp; A career Mom, we should all carry 
  this title.<br>&gt;<br><br></tt><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a
