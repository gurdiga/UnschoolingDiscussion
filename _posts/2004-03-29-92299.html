<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830683072">So I got home from our homeschool co-op today and was greeted by my 16 yos asking me  <br/>
the definition of the words &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;imperfect&quot; when used in verb tense labels. He <br/>
quickly led me to the computer to show me the site he had spent the whole day studying - <br/>
a list of all the possible verb tenses and examples in English. He explained that while he&#39;s <br/>
been interested in Klingon (Star Trek language) for over a month now, that interest has <br/>
expanded to include the creation of any invented language. We went over the grammatical <br/>
terms for tenses but I was quickly out of my depth.<br/>
<br/>
Then he wondered whether the &quot;th&quot; in &quot;the&quot; was voiced or unvoiced and what a &quot;fricative&quot; <br/>
is. Having studied five languages, I did have a little familiarity with these terms, but I <br/>
found the precision of his questions and the insight he had from his six weeks of interest <br/>
in Klingon to out strip even the smattering of knowledge I had.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, back when we were &quot;schooling at home&quot; he had done his &quot;Winston Grammar&quot; <br/>
with little interest and no retention. He hasn&#39;t studied any spoken foreign language. He <br/>
chose ASL instead. (Interestingly, don&#39;t get him started on the idea that American Sign <br/>
Language isn&#39;t a &quot;real language.&quot; He became passionate about defending the lingistic <br/>
structure and grammatical nature of ASL when he heard some colleges don&#39;t consider it a <br/>
&quot;foreign language.&quot; He&#39;s studied it for three years.)<br/>
<br/>
Yet now through the natural process of following his own interests, he&#39;s looking at <br/>
grammar more deeply (at the structural level - the composition of how language develops) <br/>
than he ever would have using some grammar program.<br/>
<br/>
This unschooling life is just too fun!<br/>

P.S. Have you all already seen School of Rock? There&#39;s another &quot;unschooling movie&quot; to add <br/>
tot he list! Especially if you are a big rock &#39;n roll fan like I am. :)</div>

<br/>
Btw - I recall seeing a posting, sometime in the past two or three years, on some homeschool list that advertised a job opening in Maine for a person who speaks Klingon.  A translator was needed to communicate with mentally ill patients who will only communicate in that language. <br/>

had listed the various verb forms for language creation with examples. Then he found a <br/>
website that had the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) which we also looked at. I&#39;ll see <br/>
if I can get you some kind of link later today.<br/>
