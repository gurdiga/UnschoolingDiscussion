I&#39;ve heard people say&quot; (it says, so it puts that into question too).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And when they were dead, the robin so red<br/>

poor babes in the wood who never done wrong&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>

That&#39;s the one!  Wow...memory flood...I must have gotten the abandon part <br/>
mixed up with Hansel and Gretel.  I really liked that book!  I vaguely remember a <br/>
picture of children covered with leaves with just their feet sticking out.  <br/>

15 year old brother died of), scarlet fever...   they were both less attached <br/>

My great grandfather was a pioneer of sorts, went back and forth from <br/>
Oklahoma to New Mexico.  His first wife and 4 of his children died of Typhoid Fever.  <br/>
He was left with 2 children.  He then met and married my great grandmother <br/>
(15 years his junior!  Their marriage certificate says &quot;Indian Territory, <br/>
Oklahoma) and had my Grandma and 3 more kids.  They settled in Albuquerque (where my <br/>
mom was eventually born.) :o)<br/>
<br/>
I sort of like he way kids then were not so sheltered about death.  Sad that <br/>
the reason was that so many more children died, but I think being a part of <br/>
the wake, preparing the dead for burial, and burying them helped people get <br/>
through the grieving.  We just went to a very old fashioned &quot;home&quot; funeral for one <br/>
of my husband&#39;s best friends.  They buried him on/in the &quot;back 10&quot; acres.  It <br/>
was really, really nice, almost like a picnic (tons of food)...and just felt <br/>
so homey and comfortable (I guess as comforting as a funeral can be.)<br/>
