<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544343982">If you&#39;re looking for a cheap (free?) easy way to carry baby, I would<br/>
recommend you look through the mamatoto.org site.  I&#39;ve always used a<br/>
Maya wrap until my newest was born (I have dd 4.5, ds 2, and ds 3m,<br/>
and now I use wrap carriers I made for $2.50 each via the instructions<br/>
on the website -- I tied him on my back when he was 1 week old and<br/>
have gardened, washed the car (without getting him wet!), hung<br/>
laundry, played tag, cuddled little ones w/scraped knees, etc.  If you<br/>
are still set on a ring-sling after looking through mamatoto, check<br/>
out thebabywearer.com for links to free instructions for making ring<br/>
slings, pouches, and Asian-style baby carriers. <br/>
<br/>
On a more unschooly note, my daughter loves looking through &quot;Babies<br/>
Celebrated&quot; with me, which shows babies from myriad traditional and<br/>
tribal cultures being carried, bathed, fed, etc.  And the mamatoto.org<br/>
site is lots of fun because she not only breaks carries into age and<br/>
front/back/hip, but into culture (Japanese, Tibetan, etc.)  Fun for<br/>
little ones (or big ones!) interested in mothering and babies. <br/>
