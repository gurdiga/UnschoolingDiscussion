<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924373164">&lt;&lt;My husband&#39;s a math guy. I told him I only ever liked and understood the <br/>
word<br/>
problems, but most of my friends hated the word problems. He said the word<br/>
problems are the ONLY problems in math books.  The &quot;number problems&quot; are the<br/>
solutions to unstated problems, without the computations done.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 11yo daughter has been getting bogged down with her math. We&#39;ve been using <br/>
Schoolzone workbooks and also tried making worksheets with the worksheet <br/>
factory program. (www.worksheetfactory.com ) She liked making the worksheets <br/>
but soon got stuck with them as well. &quot;Schoolwork&quot; is something she chooses <br/>
to do and generally enjoys and she has asked me to help her keep going with <br/>
it, so I didn&#39;t want to just ignore the problem. We had a conversation in <br/>
which she identified that just doing the number problems was too abstract and <br/>
meaningless. She said that last year&#39;s workbooks had had more word problems. <br/>
So I went online and found www.mathstories.com. I highly recommend it. Today <br/>
she did her first worksheet from that site and really liked it. I could tell <br/>
she was learning the concepts which made it easier to remember the skills and <br/>
procedures themselves. We were working on long division.  She says best part <br/>
is that the word problems showed her how these skills are used in real life. <br/>

<br/>
It seems, judging by the other lists that I am on/own and talking to others <br/>
the switch over isn&#39;t going as smoothly as they thought :(.  Some mail is <br/>
getting through and it&#39;s slowly catching up.  If you belong to a <br/>
high-volume list, be patient as it will all get to you.  If you haven&#39;t <br/>
gone to the new page to switch your information over, be prepared!  I ended <br/>
up having to use some weird name/number combo&#39;s before I found one that <br/>
wasn&#39;t taken.  And don&#39;t be surprised if you are a mod/owner of a group and <br/>
it asks you to join the one you own :).  I found that rather amusing.<br/>
