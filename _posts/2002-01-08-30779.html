 </span></blockquote>Welcome,  Lisa....<br/>
How &#39;bout I start you off with asking you to share some of your experience<br/>
in balancing the needs/interests/desires of your six youngsters....with your<br/>
own needs.<br/>
    I am personally falling into a burnout phase and hoping to prevent a<br/>
full- blown problem here.  I&#39;ve had several viruses in the past six weeks.<br/>
I am zapped of energy and sleep deprived.  I am finding myself not enjoying<br/>
much....though I try to focus on the moments of laughter and joy.  Dh works<br/>
excessively....he comes home tired and,  well,  without much energy to<br/>
contribute.<br/>
    Anyway,   while I believe in &quot;breathing the O-2 mask first myself,  then<br/>
meeting the kids needs&quot; (as in the airlines safety talk)...I&#39;m not always so<br/>
great at defing/living this balance when the needs less clear than oxygen.<br/>
Susan...not sure if I&#39;m making sense here;  and coming off a rough morning<br/>
with bickering/whiny youngsters who then got a good yelling from their sleep<br/>
deprived mama.</div>
