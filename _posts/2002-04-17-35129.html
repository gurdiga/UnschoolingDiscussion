about a ps near us trying a &quot;model&quot; four year old kindergarten, with the <br/>
hopes of starting it permanently in the district next year.   And the <br/>
district superintendent (who happens to be my neighbor) was quoted as saying <br/>
that it is too hard on teachers who get these children later than 4, because <br/>
its much harder to catch the slow learners.<br/>
<br/>
My dh, who has not always been a supporter of homeschooling and has been very <br/>
slow to come around to the idea of unschooling, burst out in a rage.  He was <br/>
so mad because this gal practically said in quotes that the school was better <br/>
suited than the parents to help a child!<br/>
<br/>
I told him I think this is the agenda...to get the kids younger and younger.  <br/>
And yet when I see some of these ps high school kids my daughter&#39;s age, I am <br/>
so sad by how burned out they are.  They&#39;re living that &quot;I have to do this&quot; <br/>
kind of existence at such a young age.  And to start even younger?  Egads!<br/>
<br/>
I was really glad, though, to see his thoughts going along those lines!  It <br/>
helps me with my arguments!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The family lives of many of these kids are pretty ugly, of course. And the <br/>
kids are very often not being given the kinds of enriching opportunities <br/>
we&#39;ve been talking about here. They often, very very often, live in <br/>
households with NO books or magazines or newpapers or any other print <br/>
material. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032180284">I don&#39;t know if I would really call it &quot;seeming advocation&quot;.  More or less<br/>
just acceptance of something that doesn&#39;t pertain to me.  I PERSONALLY feel<br/>
that all children should stay in the protective realm of their families<br/>
until they are at least 8 or 10.   I do not understand this rush to assembly<br/>
line them through &quot;the system&quot; to &quot;push&quot; them out into the world.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that a four year old is still a baby.  Definately a three year<br/>
old is still a baby.  Many are still not even toilet trained at that age.<br/>
<br/>
I hated sending my children off to Kindergarten.  I worried about them all<br/>
day, missed them all day and I was the only parent with 6 kids that<br/>
volunteered at the school every single day,,,just so my kids would know I<br/>
was near-by.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t advocate it at all, I am just sort of fed up with it and it is a<br/>

<br/>
When a dear friend learned that we were homeschooling (nevermind unschooling), she aksed lots of questions. One of them was the typical socialization question. I told her that Wilton and I would rather our children not have to deal with the ugliness of much school-based socialization. <br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;Well, the world isn&#39;t fair and they&#39;ve got to learn it sometime.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;A five-year-old needs to learn that the world is not fair?!  I&#39;d rather she believe that it is and learn how to be fair before she has to face that some people and situations won&#39;t be.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I found that true of many families when I was teaching.  Not a word.  Not <br/>
even a Bible (they were Catholic, and Bible-owning was a little suspect among <br/>
the older folks).  <br/>
<br/>
It seemed true more of the families in Cordova and Truchas, two little <br/>
mountain towns in which Spanish was the primary language, but few people read <br/>
Spanish, and there&#39;s not much readily available for them to buy in Spanish <br/>
even if they do read it.  So the kids would go home to houses without a <br/>
newspaper, without anything.<br/>
<br/>
One project we did every year involved comic strips, and I figured out really <br/>
quickly that instead of asking each kid to bring one, I&#39;d just get those who <br/>
were newspaper-rich to bring several pages, and we&#39;d pool the extras and let <br/>
people choose from those.  <br/>
<br/>
But when I was little, our house had very little printed matter.  Comic books <br/>
my mom would bring from the grocery store sometimes, Happy Hollisters or <br/>
Weekly Reader Book Club kid-novels I had already read twice, Mad Magazine (I <br/>
subscribed with my own money).  We did have the Santa Fe New Mexican and the <br/>
Rio Grande Sun, though.  But my parents didn&#39;t own books, and they didn&#39;t <br/>
subscribe to magazines.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608484444">When my daughter was kindergarten age in Rhode Island - I remember checking out the law and finding they weren&#39;t required to be in school by 7 - I thought it was so wonderful to have the opportunity to have extra time with her - I wouldn&#39;t have sent her into school at 3 or 4. Although I know people that do - but it seems too young to me - they are so small ....<br/>
<br/>
And seeing as I am here on this list, she never did go :) and even as she is 7 - I still think she&#39;s &quot;too little&quot; :)  I enjoy so much the opportunity to watch her grow and learn - I would miss out if she was in school. I can only imagine how much the parent of the 4 year old kindergartner misses.<br/>

  Head start programs were designed to help at-risk and underpriviliged kids <br/>
  prepare for first grade.  Before long, kindergarten was mandatory in LOTS of <br/>

<br/>
  Pretty ugly, as to parent-child bonding in already-at-risk families.<br/>
