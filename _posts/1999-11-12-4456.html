I was wondering what everyone did to teach safety.  Here we teach <br/>
the first-shift (the part time boys :-() and, as far as we can, the <br/>
second-shift about safety.  The boys are nearing the age where the <br/>
drugs and the gangs will be after them (especially if they stay <br/>
where they are) and my husband wanted me to teach the boys <br/>
what I know about identifying trouble (I sure got into enough &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
We have also been working on their memories.  I will ask them, <br/>
after Terry has been in bed for an hour or so &quot;What did Terry where <br/>
today?&quot;.  We want the boys to be able to help should the <br/>
unthinkable ever happen.  People identification, car identification, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
We also teach them about gun safety (we have 3 rifles and 2 1/2 <br/>
pistols (the third is a single shot black powder jobie we have no <br/>
ammo for, more a collector piece than anything) in our home.  All 4 <br/>
children will be getting their NRA memberships for Saturnalia.  We <br/>
will also enroll them in a gun safety class this summer (maybe <br/>
sooner).  The boys will not be getting a gun of their own until they <br/>
are a few years older.<br/>
<br/>
Living where we do (50 miles outside of Houston) I am probably <br/>
being paranoid, but I&#39;d rather err on the side of caution &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
