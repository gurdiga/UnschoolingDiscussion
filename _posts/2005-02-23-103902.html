To wit:<br/>
if I want information on a specific subject--knitting, let&#39;s say--I<br/>
could get a book or magazine specific to my subject, or have a visit<br/>
from a knitter and therein have a conversation.  How do I get this<br/>
information from the television?  (Or, again, are we lumping DVDs and<br/>
recorded video media into &quot;television&quot;?)  <br/>
Yes, we are lumping all those together. I don&#39;t know about you&#39;re level of <br/>
home techno but mine must include a television to watch DVD&#39;s and video. ;o) <br/>
Also in my home TV comes via satellite.  (That&#39;s an FYI)<br/>
Knitting! Woo Hoo! I just completed about 15 rows of my first project without <br/>
any mistakes! (You should see the first 15 rows though, LOL)<br/>
Well, to answer your question, I can turn on DIY network, or RFD (the farm <br/>
channel) and see if they have a knitting show, or show about spinning or <br/>
sheepdog trials or shearing or raising alpacas .<br/>
Let&#39;s see I&#39;ll search on DirecTV&#39;s website for knitting shows.<br/>
There are three coming up:<br/>
Knitty Gritty (on everyday but Fridays), Storybook Knits (shopping channels <br/>
but maybe some ideas for future projects will be there) and Citiknit.<br/>
At Netflix, I can rent The Art of Knitting and watch peoples hands move as <br/>
they do different stitches. I can get more ideas than just watching one or two <br/>
people, I can see people knit things that are more advanced that the projects <br/>
done by people I know. and it darn sure costs less then a class or the $10.00 <br/>
per half hour that my local yarn shop charges for advice!<br/>
BUT! Some people don&#39;t need as much visual imput or have much greater<br/>
access to experienced knitters (or road graders) than I and won&#39;t go to a TV <br/>
set to get that info. Some people who are shy won&#39;t seek out others for that <br/>
information. Still others are unable to comprehend written word in regards to <br/>
knitting (K, P1 Rib (over an even number of sts) Rnd 1: *K1, p 1; rep from * <br/>
around. Rep rnd 1 for k 1, p 1 rib.)<br/>
Some people like to have a variety of sources for information.<br/>

 <br/>
Same here.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t villify one resource over another.  My kids have freedom to  turn the <br/>
TV on or off, to put in a tape or a video or a game.  I don&#39;t  praise them or <br/>
give them an M&M for doing an &quot;educational&quot; thing instead of  a &quot;just for <br/>
fun&quot; thing because they&#39;re learning either way, and not having their  lives <br/>
labelled with &quot;good for you&quot; and &quot;What!?&quot; gives them the REAL freedom to  choose <br/>
what&#39;s good and useful *for them.*<br/>
 <br/>
The next three paragraphs are the beginning of an article called &quot;Raising a  <br/>
Respected Child&quot;:<br/>
 <br/>
 Holly says the ice cream we have in the freezer is too sweet. She had  <br/>
chocolate milk last night and said there was too much chocolate in it, so she  <br/>
divided it and made chocolate milk for someone else with half of it. She usually  <br/>
prefers plain milk. <br/>
Plain milk tastes WAY better if it&#39;s your choice than if does when it&#39;s plain <br/>
 because someone else wouldn&#39;t let you put chocolate in it.  <br/>
Without free choice, how can a person choose what is plain and good?  <br/>
The rest is here: <br/>

just starting to learn spinning -- it&#39;s fun, but I need way more <br/>
practice, lol.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable, but my parents have satellite TV and so I can get <br/>
my Dad to tape whatever dh and I or the kids want to see.  I&#39;ll have to <br/>
check out the spinning show!<br/>
<br/>
Elissa, do you know of any good knitting or spinning -- or fiber arts <br/>
in general -- e-lists?  I checked out some from yahoo, but they were <br/>
not very good -- no one ever posted anything except notices of stuff <br/>
they were selling : (.<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372006030">I&#39;ve just learned to knit myself as of December, 2004. Its fun and <br/>
entertaining. My 6 year old now knows how, too. She&#39;s making her <br/>
first dishtowel! She&#39;s excited about the colors right now. Its a good <br/>
thing to have the children do.<br/>
You may want to check out some groups at meetup.com. We live in <br/>
Florida and I&#39;ve joined some local groups. Also, some others like <br/>
Knitting for Cheap and Hurrican Knitters - US-wide.<br/>
I&#39;ve also organized a knit and sit (or stitch&#39;n bitch) where we get <br/>
together 2x a month and just knit. Its fun and chatty.<br/>
Happy knitting,<br/>
