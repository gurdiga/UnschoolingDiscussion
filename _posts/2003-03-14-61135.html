<div id="ygrps-yiv-291268835">Hi Ren, <br/>
It might help you to go to www.hsc.org to their legal page. I just re-read part of it and you need to remember that they can&#39;t come in or talk to your kids without a warrant. I think that part would apply in any state and with truant officers too, but didn&#39;t have time to read that deeply. <br/>
Also, to the person from Northern CA with 2 yo who is thinking of unschooling- go to the hsc website (above), and learn about their Conference in August. It is a wonderful way to connect with others even if noone around you is unschooling. There are a lot of unschoolers there. <br/>

PS Ren I wish the best for you. <br/>

Thanks Mary. It was SO great to hear from all of you here. I WAS a nervous <br/>
wreck, even though I didn&#39;t think it would be a big deal.<br/>
But it looks good right now. I think they&#39;re done with us...phew<br/>

magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

that is normal.  You handled it well.<br/>
