<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858914247">&lt;&lt;Well I never heard of ordering feeders by the internet, but why not,<br/>
right?? <br/>
I know I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s better to feed dead or stunned rats, but <br/>
unfortunately our Rocky won&#39;t eat unless alive and kicking.<br/>

I was talking with the guy who owns a store near us, he is an avid snake<br/>
fancier.  He says that snakes can be trained/enticed to eat dead food. <br/>
The web site business that sells the frozen rodents also has an aritcle<br/>
on how to do this.  I think this is the web site where I found the other<br/>
site.<br/>

My computer kept crashing while I was trying to look up the info I had<br/>
found before.  A search on google should find what you want.  When I was<br/>
reading the boards for snake enthusiasts there were stories of snakes<br/>
that died from rodent bites and several shared how they trained their<br/>
snake to take thawed.<br/>
<br/>
Wild rodents would be an especially high risk due to parasites, snakes<br/>
can get mites and ticks too.  Just an FYI, your dh may already know all<br/>
this.<br/>

Thank you, I am going to look into the site you sent. And I honestly don&#39;t <br/>
think my husband was really serious about catching the wild rat.&lt;BG&gt; I mean <br/>
heck, what would we have saved???? $2.00?<br/>
