I enjoyed your article and agree wholeheartedly- I think that life<br/>
scripting is among the most damaging results of the public school system.<br/>
I&#39;d like to add one major life script- that is getting married and having<br/>
children. <br/>
<br/>
So many people do this as a matter of course without really knowing why or<br/>
having a clue what it really is all about. After you follow this script,<br/>
it&#39;s a terrific domino affect- following everyone else in putting all your<br/>
trust in &quot;experts&quot; for childbirth, feeding, raising and educating your<br/>
children. It would take enormous strength and courage to choose not to get<br/>
married and not to have children. Society doesn&#39;t understand people who<br/>
make that choice. And yet, if we were really honest with ourselves, I bet<br/>
the majority of us would say we wished we had thought more before making<br/>
that decision. I have two incredibly wonderful girls and a mostly wonderful<br/>
husband:), but I do wish that I had thought things out a little more and I<br/>
probably would have waited a while before jumping into this script:) This<br/>
is one of the lessons I plan to teach my children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is true.  I&#39;m glad that two turned down marriage proposals and my<br/>
love of living overseas prevented me from getting married until I was 6<br/>
weeks shy of 27.  My wife was 30 at the time we married.  We&#39;re both glad<br/>
we waited and hope that our children will postpone that step until they&#39;ve<br/>
had a chance to be single adults for awhile.<br/>

Egads... I was 25 when I married, and after being married just under 10 <br/>
years, I would have married the same man -- but waited... oh, ten years, <br/>
perhaps!  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-364572113">I&#39;d like to add my two cents on the marriage issue. When my husband and I <br/>
married: I was 19 and he was 18. At no time have I regretted it or wished I <br/>
had waited. (this is the truth, I&#39;m not saying it because he&#39;ll see it!) If <br/>
anything, we have worked harder because of our age these past eight years <br/>
because we didn&#39;t want to be stereotyped as having been married too young. <br/>
Marriage is too broad a subject to cover with blanket statements, everyone is <br/>
different, and that is one of the beauties of life! :-}<br/>

Oh -- I surely didn&#39;t mean for everyone else.. many people are happy and <br/>
would be no matter when they married. And I&#39;m very happy, after working for <br/>
10 years on something surely worth working on...  I didnt&#39; travel as much as <br/>
I should&#39;ve and I wish I did a Peace Corp thing... that &#39;s all that I <br/>
meant... Hope I did&#39;nt offend..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408516617">No no! I did not mean for my reply to sound offended! I just feel that man <br/>
and woman were created to be together and if you make the daily decision to <br/>
love someone you can be happy forever with them regardless of age. Sometimes <br/>
it seems some would use things as these for excuses to get out of a marriage. <br/>
I just want to let people know that they can work simply because they were <br/>
meant to! But I did intend for my whole comment to be taken with love!! No <br/>
hard feelings here.I&#39;m always up for a good discussion. :-} Lori in TX</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I agree.  It is important though to expose children to many other<br/>
possibilities they might pursue as young adults in addition to early<br/>
marriage.  In other words, they should know that life isn&#39;t a &quot;one size<br/>
fits all&quot; sort of thing.<br/>

Absolutely agreed!  There are always options. I appreciated your essay very <br/>
much. I guess I am just passionate about defending marriage!  Lori</div>
