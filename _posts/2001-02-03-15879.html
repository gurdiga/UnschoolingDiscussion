&lt;&lt; My words were not chastising, nor meant to be, please.  I said simply that <br/>
sometimes people&#39;s remarks are not responded to because a heavy, at times <br/>
heated, debate is going on, and that I feel this may not be the best way to <br/>
conduct a list.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, I used as an example 100 people.  This list has 483 people.<br/>
<br/>
If ten or fifteen of them are involved in a discussion of something fully <br/>
allowed by unschooling.com&#39;s description of the list, the other 450+ should <br/>
probably take the time to fully welcome all new members.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe new members don&#39;t really need a big mushy welcome.<br/>
<br/>
To say this isn&#39;t the best way to run a list and to mention &quot;heated&quot; <br/>
discussion instead of fascinating or spellbinding discussion (you chose an <br/>
adjective with some slant to it toward the negative side) is chastisement in <br/>
the definition of a dictionary that is not mine, but belongs to anyone who <br/>
wants to look.  It&#39;s direct criticism, in public.<br/>
<br/>
(It seemed to me to be saying that because there was a discussion going on, <br/>
that&#39;s why someone&#39;s &quot;Hi, I&#39;m new here!&quot; Didn&#39;t get direct &quot;welcome!&quot; <br/>
responses.  That&#39;s not true nor is it fair to say.)<br/>

do things have to be said so harshly&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This happens when folks loose track of the reason why<br/>
we&#39;re here, and instead only look to inflate their own<br/>
egos. If this offends you, then it probably IS you.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have never <br/>
 encountered such rudeness tolerated so well on a list. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I have encouraged my children to speak their minds. Sometimes that looks <br/>
like rudeness. To me that is preferable to glossing over or &quot;being polite.&quot; <br/>
On the other hand, diplomacy can be useful,  the discernment to know when to <br/>
not say what one is thinking or to say it in a more &quot;polite&quot; way. There is a <br/>
time and a place for both skills. <br/>
    I think the outspokeness of this list is leading to some very productive <br/>
communication. I think the tolereance for this is bringing us closer. I feel <br/>
honored to be part of a group that is willing to tackle such difficult and <br/>
controversial issues. The dialogue and sharing among people with such varied <br/>
points of view is really amazing.<br/>
