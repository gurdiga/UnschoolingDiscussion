<div id="ygrps-yiv-612133169">&lt;&lt;Is HP not a &quot;how to&quot; book in story form?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bwwaaahhhaaaahhhaaaa.<br/>
<br/>
You haven&#39;t read it have you?  If HP is a &quot;how to&quot; book, then so is<br/>
&quot;Bewitched&quot; or &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;.  How very silly.<br/>
<br/>
But I do agree with you that any ban is unconstitutional.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639919503">&lt;&lt;there is a difference between explaining and excuses&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes and sometimes not.  I worked drug rehab and saw and did a lot of<br/>
confrontational therapy.  Saw some good results and saw some not so good.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the follow up thing.....just wanted to point out that I was part<br/>
of a study done by NIAAA about the effects of different types of therapy and<br/>
intervention on long term change.  It backed up other studies that say type<br/>
of therapy, or even obtaining therapy at all, has very little correlation<br/>
with improvement in condition.  If people are going to get better they do,<br/>
if not they don&#39;t.<br/>
