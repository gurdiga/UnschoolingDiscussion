<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089990646">Hi list,<br/>
<br/>
What would you do with this situation?<br/>
<br/>
The other day, I had a drink of ice water which I left near the <br/>
computer. It was in a coke cup w/lid and straw. I had left it there <br/>
for a bit, and when I did go over and grab it, to refill w/ice and <br/>
water, I tipped my head back to drink down a big swallow...THERE WAS <br/>
A LOOGIE IN THE WATER! I almost gulped it down...ugh...blech...<br/>
<br/>
sorry this is SO gross. my son has this loogie habit, which I <br/>
hate...other than mentioning the rudeness of it to him, I haven&#39;t <br/>
ever punished him or anything. I figured, his social interactions <br/>
would eventually teach him...He evidently had let one down the straw <br/>
into the cup. oh blech. sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Now. Loogies are RUDE, I consider it exceptionally coarse behavior, <br/>
and he knows I don&#39;t like it. But he continued on until SOMEONE got <br/>
the negative consequences of his rude behavior...ME.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, at this point, I DID holler at him. Everyone in the <br/>
household was completely grossed out and he got lots of negative <br/>
feedback that day. <br/>
<br/>
I think he was genuinely sorry, and I&#39;m confident there&#39;ll never be a <br/>
loogie in anyone&#39;s water ever again...shudder...but what to do, if I <br/>
see him hawking one or dangling it...<br/>
<br/>
What should my response be in future, if loogy behavior happens <br/>
again? L ewwww.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What I would probably do:<br/>
I would maybe tell him calmly that that&#39;s no better than if he were to crap <br/>
in his hand and leave it for someone, or to rub boogers or spit on someone or <br/>
piss in someone&#39;s coffee.  Tell him any stuff that comes out of his body should <br/>
be treated as waste material and PRIVATE waste material and should be in a <br/>
toilet, in a kleenex in the trash, and you never EVER unless he&#39;s bedridden and <br/>
can&#39;t take care of himself want to see anything that came out of him that way <br/>
again, and anyone who DOES want to see for any other than medical reasons <br/>
isn&#39;t as sane as you&#39;d like him to hang out with, but if he DOES find people like <br/>
that someday, show them all the poo he wants, but not at YOUR house.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about what I&#39;d say, and about that long and breathlessly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the best thing, but it&#39;s an info dump anyway.<br/>

My son did this once. Once. <br/>
I was just getting ready to sip my coffee and looked down and BOOM there it <br/>
was!<br/>
I told him it was disgusting and asked if he would be upset if I did that to <br/>
his drink. He said well yeah! Ok then I said please do not do it to mine then.<br/>
He never did it again.  <br/>

I was feeling equally indignant.  (I&#39;ve spilled drinks on my keyboard <br/>
and would hate to see my own safety precautions used as part of a sneak <br/>
attack.  And boogers, yuck!)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You know, I could take your toothbrush and use it to clean the toilet <br/>
any time without telling you.  But I don&#39;t.  Would you want to live in a <br/>
family where you couldn&#39;t trust me not to do that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is too severe and someone will have a gentler, cleverer idea.<br/>

damn clever way of making the point, Betsy.  (Nevertheless, if I were that <br/>
young&#39;un, I&#39;d probably take a tip from Mad Eye Moody and start using a <br/>
toothbrush I kept in a toothbrush holder on my belt!)  (BG)<br/>

BUT I think he has done gross loogy things to tease his sisters, when <br/>
I&#39;ve been elsewhere, before this nasty occurence. If I see him at it <br/>
again, I&#39;ll have some ammo, between you and Sandra. L blech<br/>
<br/>
He sure got a hollering though. Maybe that was enough.<br/>

Here is another twist. Go to the library, get a good illustrated book on <br/>
communicable diseases (preferably one that has lots of gory, nasty pictures of <br/>
germs that live in our body fluids), check it out, hand it to him, tell him to <br/>
read it and then say you never want to see his body fluids again unless he is <br/>
sick and can&#39;t help it. <br/>

Gentler? No, but hysterically laughing till I snort and wake Darin up, and <br/>
the dog is barking at me now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-421942323">There is a cell phone commercial currently airing that begins with a guy brushing his teeth.  His phone rings and he gets a photo of a dog having his mouth brushed with the toothbrush the guy now has in his mouth.  Next you see a group of guys and one starts to eat some dip.  Now this second guy&#39;s phone rings.  He gets a photo of the first guy with his finger going down his throat and an audio message saying something like,  &quot;That&#39;s not guacamole (sp?).&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I guess you&#39;d have two choices.  An actual demonstration of something sure to gross him out, or a discussion based on a commercial, book, or article. I remember when my son was 6 or 7, he went through a phase where he did NOT want to wash his hands, for any reason, PERIOD.  I found an article explaining in very gross detail what can happen if one doesn&#39;t wash his hands.  It has never ever been an issue again.  We didn&#39;t really *discuss* it.  I just read him the article.  <br/>
