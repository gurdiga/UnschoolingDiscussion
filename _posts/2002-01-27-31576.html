<div id="ygrps-yiv-210843489"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I think the &quot;getting behind&quot; response could have validated the *fear* part<br/>
&gt;of the question....that part is a valid *feeling*.  It deserves respect.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not saying the questioner wasn&#39;t respectful--I already said that<br/>
&gt;earlier.....I&#39;m just saying that by acknowledging that a valid fear exists<br/>
&gt;for that person goes a long way toward positive communication.  Then the<br/>
&gt;original poster will be more receptive to what else you have to say.<br/>

got this whole thing right, she was the orignial poster).<br/>
<br/>
Getting behind as in pertaining to personal goals and the upset they <br/>
bring if they are not met.<br/>
<br/>
What you speak about &#39;fear&#39; here is a great read. Fears do exist and <br/>
acknowleging them is a good portion of the battle to overcoming them.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean feeding into them. It means responding to <br/>
them, understanding them, and then offering one&#39;s experience on them.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of posts that I don&#39;t respond to because of lack of <br/>
experience with certain aspects. And a lot of posts I don&#39;t respond to <br/>
because someone said it more eloquently than I and I have nothing to add.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, none of this is meant to stop the thought-provoking <br/>
conversation. Its meant to add to it without the other misagosh.<br/>
