1. I work and unschool at the same time and find it not only possible <br/>
but practical. So does my husband.<br/>
Pam, bookseller<br/>
<br/>
2. I work part time and my dh and I run a home business.  It works <br/>
beautifully for the most part (except lately when I&#39;ve had to work <br/>
more hours than normal, but that will not continue).  I&#39;ve gotten to <br/>
give my kids access to stuff they couldn&#39;t have unless I work. They <br/>
all have spending money, get lessons they choose occasionally and go <br/>
neat places (like Columbia, SC!!) all because I choose to work. And <br/>
if someone in the family doesn&#39;t work, how do you unschool?<br/>

<br/>
But not if you&#39;re unschooling.<br/>
Then there IS no &quot;schooling.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of hours in a week, and if you take away 50 or 60 or sleeping <br/>
(or 70 if you&#39;re a 15 year old boy) and some for the mom to be gone for a <br/>
parttime job, that still leaves lots and lots of hours for warm human <br/>
interactions, and the kids learn while the mom&#39;s not there, too.<br/>

It was late and I was commenting on Sandra&#39;s post that not everyone can (or should...by now I&#39;ve forgotten the original premise) unschool. Its a conversation I&#39;ve had with friends about MY personal ability to commit to unschool If I have what it takes.<br/>
<br/>
I was not unsure of my ability to work and homeschool, I&#39;ve done that for now for 3 of the 5 years we have been homeschooling. It can be done...I actually think that it is easier to homeschool and work then unschooling which seems like an on call type of thing. And mentally I&#39;m just not as avalible to my son&#39;s intrests as I might need to be. When you do &quot;school at home&quot; you know you have this set amount of time each day you will be &quot;schooling&quot; and then can move on to your intrests or in my case take that afternoon nap before I go to work.<br/>
<br/>
More then anything I&#39;m working through all of this and dealing with a depressing week. Hopefully I feel sunnier next week.<br/>
