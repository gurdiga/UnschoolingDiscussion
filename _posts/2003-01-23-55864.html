<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666124883">Today was a beautiful snowy day. When I woke up late after having stayed <br/>
up far too late last night, I didn&#39;t realize it had been snowing all <br/>
night. It was beautiful. I lookeed out the window and noticed that the <br/>
school behind us is unoccupied today. Now I&#39;m giving thanks that I <br/>
didn&#39;t have to wake up early and check the TV and radio to see that I <br/>
hadn&#39;t needed to get up early at all!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling joyously,<br/>
<br/>
