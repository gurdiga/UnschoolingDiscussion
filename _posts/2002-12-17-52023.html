<br/>
I agree with ren on this.<br/>
<br/>
The less the mom cares to look over her shoulder at what they would be doing <br/>
if they were in school, the better she will see what HER children ARE doing, <br/>
not what they&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
All that energy could be put into being with her kids.<br/>
<br/>
AND what&#39;s offered at the school isn&#39;t necessarily what&#39;s learned.  And in <br/>
secondary situations with electives, just because physics is offered at the <br/>
school doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s required.<br/>
<br/>
The world book site has general lists, and that can give the mom a clue if <br/>
she wants one without actually dealing with or living in the shadow of the <br/>
neighborhood school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880240053">I didn&#39;t say match our portfolio to the scope and sequence at schools - <br/>
that wasn&#39;t what I meant at all. But we still have to go in and have our <br/>
portfolio reviewed, and we can&#39;t pretend that the schools don&#39;t exist, <br/>
or that there aren&#39;t ever any efforts to control or judge homeschoolers. <br/>
There are discussions here all the time about what goes on in public <br/>
schools. Why is it bad to pay attention? Paying attention or being aware <br/>
does not mean imitating or following. &quot;being aware&quot; was meant as a <br/>
general statement, sometimes being aware is simply nothing more than <br/>
knowing how bad it is. It wasn&#39;t meant as a comparison or standard - <br/>
sorry if it came out that way.<br/>

completely undergroung, that is .  We have to follow the laws of our state <br/>
whether we agree to them or not in order to insure they do not infringe upon <br/>
us even farther.   ( IE, we dont follow the laws, and we are deemed unfit and <br/>
lose our children)  You have to know what is required of you as a <br/>
homeschooler to comply, even if it is very loosely, with the laws of your <br/>
state.    Being informed and aware is just a tool to arm yourself against <br/>
losing the &quot;freedoms&quot;  (yes, in quotes, because they are not real freedoms) <br/>
of homeschooling your children. <br/>

And even where it is a bit more restrictive, there are creative ways <br/>
to get around all that without totally going underground.<br/>
The less I have school as part of our lives, the better.<br/>
If I&#39;m nervously peering over my shoulder (this is not literal, just <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Right.  It&#39;s just that people on the list are in different states and<br/>
different countries and may sometimes make assumptions based on their<br/>
own circumstances.  &quot;Be like me&quot; or &quot;Do it my way&quot; don&#39;t always cut it<br/>
when we are covered by different laws.  Some people on the list have<br/>
more that they have to comply with than others.  It can be hard to<br/>
remember that we swim in different waters.<br/>
<br/>
In California we don&#39;t do any testing or reporting.  (So far, but the<br/>
state may come after us some year with new regulation, and we have to<br/>
keep aware of that.)<br/>
<br/>
I look at the California state learning standards fairly frequently, but<br/>
that&#39;s just because my husband is a second year teacher, and he just<br/>
switched from teaching 6th grade to 9th.  I have to say that it&#39;s a good<br/>
thing that there ARE standards because otherwise the amount of<br/>
orientation the teacher gets sometimes is &quot;There are no books.  Start<br/>
teaching.&quot;  At least the standards give him a clue where to start.)<br/>

very well be breaking them, do you always drive the speed limit? Do you <br/>
follow all driving laws to the letter? Probably not. <br/>
Following the laws doesn&#39;t mean you are following them to the letter or <br/>
completely disregarding them there is a HUGE grey area.<br/>
Why not &quot;make it up&quot;? Look at New York&#39;s laws, many people use a very very <br/>
vague &quot;curriculum&quot; that basically says We l learn by doing what we want. <br/>
Testing in some states can be done at home, who KNOWS who actually filled out <br/>
the test.<br/>
Laws are *interpreted*. That means that the person reading them, say a judge, <br/>
can interpret as she understands them. So you can NEVER know for sure, that <br/>
you are in compliance with HS regs. If they REALLY want to take your kids <br/>
away, just ONE typo can give the excuse.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that one should flaunt what might be perceived as illegal, but <br/>
definately fly below the government&#39;s radar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702474002">I honestly don&#39;t let making a portfolio affect what I do with my <br/>
children. I push worries about portfolios out of my head until a few <br/>
days before we&#39;re evaluated (we have to do that too).  At that point, <br/>
I get a huge headache and spend a day or two doing nothing but <br/>
putting a portfolio together.  On those days I sit with my calendar <br/>
and make collages of all the &quot;educational&quot; places we&#39;ve visited and <br/>
pull out all the workbooks and funbooks and start photocopying. You <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to be around me on those two days because I&#39;m so <br/>
grouchy. You also don&#39;t want to mention compulsory attendance laws to <br/>
me on those days. ;)  But it&#39;s only 2 days out of the year--better <br/>
than worrying about it all year long I guess. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990839236">I decided years ago that when I spoke at conferences I would talk about how <br/>
children learn naturally, and what can help create an environment and a <br/>
relationship which will best help that learning unfold and grow, without <br/>
regard for the laws in the place in which I was speaking.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who are involved politically in unschooling, and there are <br/>
discussion boards and lists which are politically focussed, but I stay away <br/>
from them completely.  I&#39;m grateful that there are people who ARE interested <br/>
in politics and willing to fight those fights, but I&#39;m more interested in <br/>
cognition and child development and what&#39;s optimal in the uncharted territory <br/>
of treating children as people instead of as inferior grubs who need to <br/>
prepare for their eventual real lives.<br/>
<br/>
If a three year old has a real life, if a ten year old is a person, then <br/>
there are things they need to help them grow.     <br/>
<br/>
Rather than change the definition of unschooling, or limit the scope of our <br/>
discussions, to fit the legal ramifications of Pennsylvania or Kansas or New <br/>
Zealand, I would rather discuss unschooling as  a pure endeavor, and let <br/>
people worry about how to make it work in their place of residence.  <br/>
<br/>
There are state discussion lists already in place for local details.  Since <br/>
this list was founded, the policy has been to send people to find state <br/>
details elsewhere.  I really don&#39;t think we should  say there is Ohio <br/>
unschooling and Texas unschooling.  (Although here is an Ohio aid:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum)">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum)</a><br/>
<br/>
IF someone really cared about gun laws and wanted to own guns and use them, <br/>
he might move out of Pennsylvania because of his beliefs and desires.  If <br/>
someone really wanted to live near wildlife to observe birPeople make <br/>
decisions about where to live based on their priorities all the time.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is in a state where they can&#39;t figure out a way to unschool and <br/>
still feel safe, they either need to not unschool, or they should move.   But <br/>
we shouldn&#39;t have to compromise our discussions because one state or another <br/>
has one law or another.  <br/>
<br/>
Laws don&#39;t change the way natural learning works.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318922796">I kind of agree with you.  I don&#39;t think that someone should not <br/>
unschool a certain way because of the state&#39;s laws.  You should find <br/>
the educational and parenting philosophy that you agree with it and <br/>
stick to your convictions.  Getting around the law shouldn&#39;t affect <br/>
how you parent/edcuate. But it is something that many have to deal <br/>
with because of the educational choices they have made.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I don&#39;t see a discussion of how to get around a <br/>
state law any different than discussion of how to get around a <br/>
husband who isn&#39;t sure of unschooling or a relative who constantly <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I have found, through experience, its the  local public school system <br/>
rather than the NCDNPE that gives folks more flack.  The state regs are <br/>
pretty simple, but lots of school administration ( or other state <br/>
organizations) want to try to strong arm parents into thinking there is <br/>
&quot;more&quot; to the regs.  For example, my sister told me just the other day that a <br/>
friend of hers homeschools her children.  My sister (Karen) said.. &quot; yeah, <br/>
she was telling me all about all the logs and records she has to keep&quot;  I <br/>
said, &quot;Uhh, no, she doesnt&quot;  Karen said.. &quot;well, she thinks she does.  she <br/>
keeps records of everything.. Lessons plans, grades, work samples.. She said <br/>
she had to for the state&quot;  This girl is WRONG wrong wrong.  There are no such <br/>
regs like that in NC.  She has been misled by someone, probably a ps school <br/>
official or perhaps some curriculum salesperson.   In this case, this girl <br/>
being aware of state regs would save her a lot of time and trouble.    <br/>
<br/>
MMMM Good crow.. :-)  Im finding all sorts of ways to spice this bird up.. <br/>
<br/>
Teresa<br/>
<br/>
OH,  btw, Sandra, I do agree, this is not really a political forum... But I <br/>
think that just like parenting practices overlap and mesh into  unschooling, <br/>
so does politics.  There are many issues that just sort of cross over.   <br/>
Actually, I am not a political person.  My first response was in agreement <br/>
with someone who said they like to be aware of what is required for thier <br/>
portfolio.   And, I&#39;ll hush.. for good.. SOMEBODY GET A GAG.!!.. No.. I guess <br/>
chinese handcuffs would be more appropiate.<br/>

Exactly. My conviction is about how to parent, and how children learn. If my <br/>
conviction was to follow the law first and foremost, then things could get <br/>
bad for my kids if there are more invasive laws put into place.<br/>
I think the priority should be rights, and if a law is unfair (which <br/>
compulsory schooling laws are) then the rights of my children come first.<br/>
I don&#39;t owe the government a damn thing, I owe my children everything.<br/>
So what it comes down to for me, is which is more important? The law, or my <br/>
rights as a parent/human being?<br/>
There is a saying, can&#39;t remember who to credit or the exact words but <br/>
something about &quot;in a free society one has an obligation to break unjust <br/>
laws&quot;....<br/>

&gt; Subject: Kids and Behaviour<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking for some advice on moderating a child&#39;s behaviour. My<br/>
&gt; youngest has a temper (must be the red hair) and loses it quite<br/>
&gt; often. When he does he will lash our at other kids if they approach<br/>
&gt; him and adults too and call people who try and speak to him &#39;f****<br/>
&gt; bastards&#39;<br/>
&gt; At home I&#39;ve fiound the only thing that works is to ignore him until<br/>
&gt; he comes out of the temper. He can&#39;t be reasoned with, or jollied<br/>
&gt; out of it or even threatened (which I treid in the past). Punishment<br/>
&gt; and consequences mean nothing while his temper lasts.<br/>
&gt; When it has passed we&#39;ve discussed it many times and he<br/>
&gt; promises to try better in the future. None of this is a problem at<br/>
&gt; home.<br/>
&gt; While we&#39;re out this is a different matter. One friend tried to jolly<br/>
&gt; him out of a temper and he called her a name and tried to hit her.<br/>
&gt; He hit another friends dog when the dog tried to pinch his dinner.<br/>
&gt; We are finding that we&#39;re not welcome anywhere which is affecting<br/>
&gt; my other kids and me. I feel we&#39;re going to be alone, stuck in the<br/>
&gt; house like social pariahs.<br/>
&gt; My friends use time out and sending kids to their room which I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t agree with personally but in their own house I would never say<br/>
&gt; anything. While I tell him that his behaviour isn&#39;t acceptable I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; obviously not going to beat him and I feel uncomfortable dicsiplining<br/>
&gt; him in a way I would not do so at home. I really don&#39;t want to be<br/>
&gt; friendless until he matures enough to stop, like the other two did.<br/>
&gt; In some ways it is a cultural thing too, peope at home would have<br/>
&gt; ignored the behaviour or laughed it off as a stage some kids go<br/>
&gt; through.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any advice in how to deal with a stubborn 7 yo would be<br/>
&gt; apreciated. Before I have to leave Virginia ;-)<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;This year we&#39;ll need to cover the big gifts with a sheet on<br/>
&gt; Christmas Eve or my 2yods will open everything.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well this year the cat and the kitten were driving me crazy making their own<br/>
&gt; little place under the tree. My velour tree skirt was covered in hair and I<br/>
&gt; just couldn&#39;t keep it clean for more than an hour. So I cleaned it one last<br/>
&gt; time, wrapped all the gifts and put them under the tree. Cats can&#39;t get to<br/>
&gt; it now. I thought after my 2 year old started to ask to open them that it<br/>
&gt; was a mistake. But she surprised me as usual and has been very good. No<br/>
&gt; shaking or anything. She understands now that on Christmas she can open<br/>
&gt; some. Of course she has no idea when that is so every day she asks. She also<br/>
&gt; goes and shows everyone how we have Merry Christmas under the tree! Aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; kids just the best??!!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; On the other hand, I don&#39;t see a discussion of how to get around a <br/>
state law any different than discussion of how to get around a <br/>
husband who isn&#39;t sure of unschooling or a relative who constantly <br/>
quizzes the kids.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But none of those considerations should cause us to compromise the ideas we <br/>
exchange.  Just because someone has a husband who refuses to read anything <br/>
about unschooling doesn&#39;t mean we should stop recommending that dads should <br/>
learn about it too.  Just because some people&#39;s relatives are similar; <br/>
similar.<br/>
<br/>
If the list is going to qualify and water down information because of a law <br/>
or a detractor, the information will be of less value.  If we wimp out to <br/>
make someone feel better because they can&#39;t REALLY unschool as they would <br/>
like to, that doesn&#39;t promote unschooling.  It promotes wimping out.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a strong opinion, but where will the strong opinions be if they&#39;re no <br/>
longer allowed here?<br/>
