<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114898662">We just wanted to say thank-you to everyone that responded to our post in <br/>
regard to unschooling our son. We really have learned a lot in the last 2 <br/>
days! It has made us see that we have to change a lot of our ways with our <br/>
him (which is good). We never thought that a child could learn so much just <br/>
from animals! We move forward now (with open eyes) and without the therapists!<br/>

about the history of animals or the geography of animals, or do <br/>
reports to show you what he has learned.  Don&#39;t make unit studies up <br/>
or anything.  Just give him fun stuff to do that he will enjoy, let <br/>
him follow his passions, and know in your heart that he will learn <br/>
what he needs, when he needs. it. :) <br/>
