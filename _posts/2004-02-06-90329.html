<br/>
My guess is that Yahoo just installed some spam identifying software and<br/>
it&#39;s picking up false clues in some people&#39;s messages.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure what the purpose is of sending out messages marked with<br/>
[spam]. If the sofware were perfect, Yahoo you just not send it or we could<br/>
set our email programs to filter it all into the trash. But it isn&#39;t perfect<br/>
so we still have to read all the mail to decide if it&#39;s spam or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467736134">It&#39;s not that email address in particular, but Wednesday evening Yahoo <br/>
implemented its &quot;SpamGuard&quot; program.  On some other lists that I <br/>
moderate every message was coming through marked as spam.  There was no <br/>
rhyme nor reason to it either.  LOL  As the group owner/moderator of my <br/>
smallish groups I just chose to shut the darn thing off.  HTH<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690153404">Yes, I&#39;m getting them this way, too. I figured someone (moderator) needs <br/>
to go push some button at Yahoo! to tell them it&#39;s OK. My sense is that <br/>
some combination of keywords and message length or something flags it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763755045">Yahoo has a new spam filter. This has been happening on other lists as well.<br/>
<br/>
You can turn it off, but I&#39;m not sure how and I&#39;m not sure if it has to be done by individual members, or the moderators.<br/>
