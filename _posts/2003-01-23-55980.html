I understand your comments, now...and I agree, they definitely <br/>
believe that humiliation and degradation is part of character <br/>
training.<br/>

Thanks again for clearing that up.<br/>

&gt; calmly and lovingly sit down with their kids and explain what they <br/>
&gt; did that was disobedient, to spank them, and to tell the kids that <br/>
&gt; they love them.  I know many parents who spank, who truly love their <br/>

thing to do etc.  Never had any church pressure to spank.  I know many <br/>
members of our church that did not spank and didn&#39;t believe that it was the <br/>
right thing to do.  Having said that I know several parents that do spank but <br/>
not out of anger.  They are very scheduled about it.  Maybe not the best <br/>
wording.  The children know exactly how many spanks a certain offense <br/>
carries.  I have heard the mother say.  &quot;You know you aren&#39;t supposed to be <br/>
on the outside of the jungle gym that will be 3 spanks when we get home.  <br/>
They total up the day and dad (the minister) spanks them at the end of the <br/>
day.  Sad really.  Not a church I go to just a mother I have met.  I am one <br/>
of those unchurching people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where do you live, Deborah? Here in SC, NOTHING can be planned for <br/>
homeschoolers on Wednesday nights because of the prayer meetings. (Our <br/>
unschooling group is a bit more----relaxed! &lt;G&gt;) Homeschool skate was mostly <br/>
Christian music (until several complained). Here, it&#39;s not unusual to hear, <br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re not learning, you&#39;re CLEANING! Now get BUSY!&quot; Spanking&#39;s the rule. <br/>
So many smacks for such-and-such offense---said loudly for all to hear. Just <br/>
so everyone knows that Mom&#39;s a real disciplinarian. NOTHING can be planned <br/>
for homeschoolers until after 1:00 (they&#39;re too busy filling in their <br/>
Sonlight/Abeka/BobJones workbooks). Spankings or no fun if they&#39;re not <br/>
completed correctly. Really! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it depends on where you live. But we have some Catholics here (very <br/>
good friends) that spank. Mom doesn&#39;t hit hard. Dad does. Duncan doesn&#39;t <br/>
really like to spend the night anymore because they&#39;ve struck him!!! I can&#39;t <br/>
blame him. I told the mom in no uncertain terms that that was unacceptable <br/>
with MY son. I&#39;ve tried to explain it&#39;s not OK with her boys (almost 7 and 4) <br/>
but I have no jurisdiction there. <br/>
<br/>
Her boys are sneaky and conniving---at 4 and 6! <br/>
We all do what we must to survive. Lying happens naturally when you&#39;re <br/>
protecting your body from pain. I&#39;ve exlained here that no one will be <br/>
struck. That includes each other, which they do with regularity. But they <br/>
don&#39;t lie here nearly as often as at home. &#39;Cause they won&#39;t get into trouble <br/>
here. <br/>
<br/>
Mom & Dad were spanked (mom was admittedly physically and emotionally <br/>
abused), and THEY turned out OK. They both attended Catholic schools. More <br/>
corporal punishment. MANY churches OK striking children. The average Joe <br/>
BELIEVES what he&#39;s told in church, whether YOU&#39;re willing to believe that or <br/>
not.<br/>

<br/>
One thing I haven&#39;t seen mentioned. The Church leaders may also advise you<br/>
not to tell people that you use the rod as correction. I know that is what<br/>
they said in our parenting study. I think the exact wording was you have to<br/>
be careful who you tell (about using the rod for correction) since people<br/>
who aren&#39;t Christians, or more specifically aren&#39;t fundamentalists, may not<br/>
understand and may report you. Pretty sad really but they did stress that<br/>
point. So people may not even be honest with you if you ask them if they<br/>
spank. We are in New England so Fundamentalism isn&#39;t as prevalent as in the<br/>
bible belt but it&#39;s still there and almost all of the people I personally<br/>
know, who follow that religion do spank. Plus when you are in that sort of<br/>
Church it is easier than you might think to fall prey to thier teachings,<br/>
you don&#39;t always realize it is happening until you are away from the<br/>
situation.<br/>

<br/>
The lyingest child I have known since I&#39;ve been a mother was also the most <br/>
spanked.<br/>
I&#39;m sure they would say they spanked her for lying.  But she lied to avoid <br/>
spankings, and to get to do at least SOME things on her own.<br/>
<br/>
She involved Holly in a couple of lies.  I could see it at a distance, <br/>
because since Holly doesn&#39;t lie, her eyes and posture gave away that what she <br/>
was hearing wasn&#39;t true but she didn&#39;t know what to do about it.<br/>
<br/>
Just New Year&#39;s Eve a girl about Holly&#39;s age was incredulous that Holly is <br/>
never punished and never lies.  She said since I don&#39;t punish her she could <br/>
lie a lot!   The girl thought that was a great advantage, being able to lie <br/>
without fear of punishment.   Then Holly was the incredulous one.<br/>

&quot;look for opportunities throughout the day to thwart the will of your child&quot;  <br/>
( this was for infants and toddlers!!)    Anna was here reading over my <br/>
shoulder.. She read the excerpt from the text that was posted.  She was <br/>
appalled..  She said. &quot;Moma, thats like training a dog&quot;  She went on to <br/>
compare it to Landon training Joy( our Lab).. to  sit, stay, OFF, Down, NO.. <br/>
etc..  Anna even felt bad for Joy when Landon trained her to heel by yanking <br/>
on her leash.    I&#39;m glad that my kids have never had to be &quot;trained&quot; like <br/>
dogs.  ( despite that we live in the Bible Belt.. lol)   I have spanked my <br/>
kids.. But, it was out of anger, frustration, and on impulse.( just like <br/>
someone else commented. again, cant recall who)  I never felt worse than <br/>
after those incidents.   I attribute those misjudgings to immaturity, and <br/>
just not having  the skills to know what else to do.  I havent spanked in a <br/>
long time.     The advice to never spank is anger has always been good for <br/>
me.. Because, it never fails, after my anger calms, I wouldnt dream of <br/>
spanking my children. ( thats how I have avoided spanking them since I <br/>
&quot;stopped&quot;)  My anger scared me ( and them, of course).so I vowed to never <br/>
spank in anger.. Well, when the anger was gone, so was the impulse to spank.  <br/>
 I agree, doing it in calm, calculated way seems even more &quot;cold blooded&quot;.   <br/>
And the &quot;training exercises&quot;. thats just plain stupid.<br/>

I tried it for about a week...maybe less.  It just felt very wrong to &quot;set children up&quot; like that, just to hurt them.  What on earth kind of message does that send?  Obedience gets the gold, disobedience doesn&#39;t, and either way there is no real love involved.<br/>

I think I burned those books.  Can&#39;t remember.<br/>

  &gt; They actually suggest setting a child up, so that you can &quot;train&quot; him <br/>
  &gt; (with a switch) not to touch things that he shouldn&#39;t.  That way your <br/>
  &gt; children will obey you in public, and people will marvel at your well <br/>
  &gt; behaved children: <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
  Yeah, that sounds typcical .. I remember one time hearing that one should <br/>
  &quot;look for opportunities throughout the day to thwart the will of your child&quot;  <br/>
  ( this was for infants and toddlers!!)    Anna was here reading over my <br/>
  shoulder.. She read the excerpt from the text that was posted.  She was <br/>
  appalled..  She said. &quot;Moma, thats like training a dog&quot;  She went on to <br/>
  compare it to Landon training Joy( our Lab).. to  sit, stay, OFF, Down, NO.. <br/>
  etc..  Anna even felt bad for Joy when Landon trained her to heel by yanking <br/>
  on her leash.    I&#39;m glad that my kids have never had to be &quot;trained&quot; like <br/>
  dogs.  ( despite that we live in the Bible Belt.. lol)   I have spanked my <br/>
  kids.. But, it was out of anger, frustration, and on impulse.( just like <br/>
  someone else commented. again, cant recall who)  I never felt worse than <br/>
  after those incidents.   I attribute those misjudgings to immaturity, and <br/>
  just not having  the skills to know what else to do.  I havent spanked in a <br/>
  long time.     The advice to never spank is anger has always been good for <br/>
  me.. Because, it never fails, after my anger calms, I wouldnt dream of <br/>
  spanking my children. ( thats how I have avoided spanking them since I <br/>
  &quot;stopped&quot;)  My anger scared me ( and them, of course).so I vowed to never <br/>
  spank in anger.. Well, when the anger was gone, so was the impulse to spank.  <br/>
  I agree, doing it in calm, calculated way seems even more &quot;cold blooded&quot;.   <br/>
  And the &quot;training exercises&quot;. thats just plain stupid.<br/>

Well, here&#39;s what I believe the Bible teaches.  Ever since the first <br/>
man sinned, human beings are born in need of salvation.  Adam and Eve <br/>
used to have natures that were immortal, they never had to experience <br/>
sickness and death, and they never knew what it was like to sin (do <br/>
things that cause them to be out of fellowship with God).  When they <br/>
chose to disobey God, the perfection of the garden of eden was over <br/>
and sickness and sin entered the human race.  There will come a time <br/>
when Jesus will take all of our sickness and sin away. <br/>

I spent about 20 years in this mindset of raising children.  It made sense to <br/>
me, mainly because I didn&#39;t have children of my own then.  The first time I <br/>
spanked my own child I began to question.<br/>
<br/>
How do they allow themselves to see their children on the same level as <br/>
mules?  Never mind that even animals are better trained without hitting.<br/>

What I am wondering, is if you think that kids choose bad behavior naturally<br/>
before kindness, love, sharing, etc. (because they have a sin nature) and if<br/>
you didn&#39;t train/teach them to be nice, kind, sharing, etc., then they would<br/>
be like lord of the flies kids?  The purest love I have ever seen has come<br/>
from my kids.  The stuff they do that is less than *nice* they have learned.<br/>
