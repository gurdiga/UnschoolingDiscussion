<br/>
&quot;&gt;My question is this:  If we are making changes in our parenting techniques, <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; moving towards much more freedom for them, letting them make most decisions <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; their own lives, would it be wrong to take them back out of school if they <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to homeschool/unschool? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. I don&#39;t think forcing someone to homeschool is productive at all.<br/>
I would however, make homeschooling so interesting and fun that they WANT to <br/>
come home. Bribery if you will.<br/>
