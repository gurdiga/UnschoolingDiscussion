<div id="ygrps-yiv-67473408">Hi Genevieve, <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I have programming experience (not java though) and I wouldn&#39;t undertake making a mod.  My son (8) also wants to make a mod but I&#39;ve flat out told him I can&#39;t do it.  <br/>
<br/>
He talks all the time about how him and his friends are going to make mods and what kinds of mods they are going to make but he knows this is something that won&#39;t happen for at least a few years.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know anyone in real life who could do it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told my son that even if I decided I was going to do it and we started learning how, it would take months to years to figure it all out and put something together.  <br/>
<br/>
First you&#39;d have to learn what compilers to use, then you&#39;d have to learn to program in java, then you&#39;d have to learn to debug, and then you&#39;d have to learn to decompile minecraft and see what does what.<br/>
<br/>
LOTS of work.  I know my son doesn&#39;t have the patience or desire for ANY of that right now so that&#39;s why I&#39;ve flat said we can&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
In 3 to 5 years, we might start working on it if he&#39;s still interested.<br/>
<br/>
However, this might be a viable option:<br/>

<br/>
there&#39;s a modder who is saying &quot;request a mod and I&#39;ll see what I can do&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just hanging out in that forum and reading the posts might give you and your son more of an idea of what kind of work is involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328118806">If your son REALLY wants to do it and you&#39;re up to give it a try, you could<br/>
play fiddle with the knobs. It&#39;s a great way to learn programming! But if he<br/>
is not interested in doing it, only in playing... then that&#39;s another story.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of tutorials for minecraft moding out there, google<br/>
&quot;minecraft write your own mod tutorial&quot; and see for yourself. You could also<br/>
piggyback an existing mod...<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://akahenry.com/?cat=3">http://akahenry.com/?cat=3</a> - maybe he could create his very own mob<br/>
<br/>
There are also a few tutorials to help people create their own texture pack.<br/>
That could be fun.<br/>
<br/>
If he wants all armies (controlled by the computer like mobs?) that sounds<br/>
like a major project...<br/>
<br/>
NPCs (as in Non playing characters) are coming in the adventure update<br/>

Now if what he really wants is play with armies, you might look into ages of<br/>
empires, either the classic game or the new mmo online version:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135622955">Hi Genevieve,<br/>
<br/>
Is there some way, other than modding, to achieve your son&#39;s goals? For instance, if your son&#39;s real wish is to dress his avatar up in gladiatorial armor and fight other players, there are gladiatorial rings set up on Minecraft for that purpose. You can get different types of armor through existing mods, or buy learning to create Minecraft skins (much much easier than learning to build a mod!). <br/>
<br/>
Or, maybe there are ways to encourage your son&#39;s creativity besides actually learning to program. My son (9) has written many pages of mod descriptions, for instance. That may be something you could work on with your son. It&#39;s a super fun creative project. Take a look at minecraftforum.net to see the information a programmer might need to build a mod, and then you could work with your son to type up a detailed description of his dream mod. <br/>
<br/>
If your son understands that you must learn to program using Java to build Minecraft mods, and you think he has an interest in learning to program, then YouTube may be a helpful resource for you. My son is a bit older (9) and he (with my husband and I along side him) has started working his way through a really great Java tutorial presented on YouTube (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28)">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28)</a>. I&#39;m not sure if your son would be interested in that Java tutorial, but perhaps you could check it out and learn along with him. It&#39;s really very good. The guy who made it doesn&#39;t give overview information or philosophize or send you out to research which compiler to use. He just tells you step by step how to download the files you need to get started, including the free Java compiler called Eclipse (the most popular one for Java, I&#39;m told). Then he starts by having you copy a Hello World program and run it in Eclipse, and the lessons gradually build from there.  Each lesson is short, and so far (as far as we&#39;ve gotten) they end with a tangible accomplishment, which (so far) pleases my son.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, modding is complicated, and learning Java is just the first step in the process, and learning Java is complicated. But the journey of a thousand miles starts with that proverbial one first step. The Java tutorial *may* appeal even to a six year old, depending on your particular 6 year old. And then again, it may not. <br/>
<br/>
Your son&#39;s age may not necessarily be a barrier to his beginning to learn programming. I was just at an unschoolers&#39; gathering last May where there was a 10 year old who had designed and programmed his own videogame. I didn&#39;t see the game, but James Bach (author of &quot;Secrets of a Buccaneer-Scholar: How Self-Education and the Pursuit of Passion Can Lead to a Lifetime of Success&quot;) did and said it was impressive. There was a teenager at that same gathering who had already created a commercial game app. His mom confirmed that he&#39;d made money from it. So, who knows what may become of your son&#39;s interest? <br/>
<br/>
Keep it light and fun, and see what works for your son. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and happy modding.<br/>
<br/>
Patricia<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our son, who is now 8, was also really interested in learning to make his own games when he was 6.  We started with Scratch (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/)">http://scratch.mit.edu/)</a>, which is a free visual programming language for kids.  We made all kinds of games using this, even our son&#39;s own version of Minecraft.  I am not a programmer, but even I could do this with him :)<br/>
<br/>
Next we explored Stencyl (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stencyl.com/)">http://www.stencyl.com/)</a> which is also free, and is a bit more advanced.  <br/>
<br/>
Our son is still interested in learning to program in Java, so he is slowing going to start to edit existing Minecraft mods (with his dad&#39;s help) and explore java for kids  (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.video-animation.com/java_000.shtml)">http://www.video-animation.com/java_000.shtml)</a> with me:)<br/>
<br/>
Scratch was really great because it gave him the power to make his very own games, and exposed him to the basics of programming.  (It was good for me for the same reasons.)  This gave him the confidence to keep moving toward what looked, at a distance, like an impossible goal.  If anyone had have told me I would be *at all* interested in learning to program in Java a few years ago, I would have laughed, and said, &quot;Not Likely!&quot;  What an unpredictable journey!</div>
