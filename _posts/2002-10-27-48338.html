<div id="ygrps-yiv-209517020">Hey everyone. It&#39;s late and tonight, for the first time in 4 years I have an almost empty house and I don&#39;t know what to do with myself. Jaiden is at his first ever sleep over with his uncle at my moms house. Jason is out comforting a friend that&#39;s going through a nasty divorce and Avery is sound asleep. My house is so quiet, it&#39;s spooky. Normally Avery is in bed but Jaiden has just gotten up and is reading or watching movies with us till he falls back to sleep, think my mom is haveing fun? ;-)  Oh well, this is just me feeling kinda sad that Jaiden is growing up, but happy too, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for being here.<br/>
