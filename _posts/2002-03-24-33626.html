<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851962639">What will it take for everyone to stop this????? This list is quickly<br/>
becoming nothing but a waste of time? You all have so much information to<br/>
give and share, but all the sarcasm and nonsense is starting to outweigh<br/>
that. AND THAT IS A SHAME! :-(<br/>

Was this what you were looking for, Sarah?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Dear friends and listmembers,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wish there was a quick, easy and convenient way to let you all know<br/>
&gt;what I&#39;m thinking and feeling this morning. Unfortunately, this email<br/>
&gt;mode of communication doesn&#39;t really do much more than give us a way<br/>
&gt;to exchange writings. For me, that becomes even more limiting because<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve had trouble with carpal tunnel syndrome for the last few years<br/>
&gt;and so I try to limit the time I spend on keyboards these days. What<br/>
&gt;I might have at one time spent many paragraphs trying to explain will<br/>
&gt;now need to be presented much more concisely than I&#39;d normally<br/>
&gt;prefer. Also, because we&#39;re in deadline for our May/June issue of<br/>
&gt;HEM, I need to spend more time on non-list related projects, so I<br/>
&gt;*really* can&#39;t write as much as I&#39;d like to on this whole topic. And<br/>
&gt;if that&#39;s not enough, our oldest son and his family are here visiting<br/>
&gt;from Alaska for only a few days, and I&#39;d much rather be spending time<br/>
&gt;with them than sorting out the mess on this list. Anyway, all of that<br/>
&gt;to say this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s a major disappointment to see this list fall back into the same<br/>
&gt;kind of downward spiral we experienced a few weeks (or was it<br/>
&gt;months?) ago. I needed to be gone unexpectedly for a couple of days,<br/>
&gt;so I stayed up last night long after everyone here had gone to bed,<br/>
&gt;reading and trying to make sense of what was going on with this list.<br/>
&gt;I finally fell asleep, got back up early this morning and started<br/>
&gt;reading again, missed breakfast with the family in trying to sort<br/>
&gt;this out... and have finally caught up with the posts. Now I sit here<br/>
&gt;wondering why I spent all that time reading and trying to make some<br/>
&gt;sense of all the accusations, defenses, proclamations, and so on and<br/>
&gt;so forth. It was truly discouraging to see the disparaging remarks<br/>
&gt;about our magazine in the middle of this discussion - even a threat<br/>
&gt;to reconsider an HEM subscription - because as far as I&#39;m concerned<br/>
&gt;this list has absolutely nothing to do with the publication we<br/>
&gt;produce for homeschoolers. To see our magazine called into question<br/>
&gt;because of what someone who happens to write for us does on this list<br/>
&gt;was probably the final straw for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We - the publishers of Home Education Magazine - &quot;sponsor&quot; this list,<br/>
&gt;and many others, because we feel it&#39;s important for homeschoolers to<br/>
&gt;discuss issues with each other, to offer support and encouragement,<br/>
&gt;to have places for communication and networking. I think once upon a<br/>
&gt;time that might have been a valid approach, but, unfortunately, after<br/>
&gt;what I&#39;ve read here, I think lists like this one are more of a<br/>
&gt;liability to our publication than an asset.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll be blunt. I do not have the time nor the interest in being<br/>
&gt;involved with the kinds of dynamics I&#39;ve read here in the last few<br/>
&gt;hours. I&#39;m not even interested in longwinded discussions any more. I<br/>
&gt;just need to do my job as Managing Editor of HEM, and this list has<br/>
&gt;become a major impediment to that. For that reason, I am removing all<br/>
&gt;references to HEM from this list, turning this list over to the<br/>
&gt;moderators, unsubscribing, and getting on with what needs doing in my<br/>
&gt;life. I wish you all the best in finding appropriate resolutions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
