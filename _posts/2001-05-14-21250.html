I also live in Florida and your children are NOT required to take tests, it is an option.  In addition, if you choose to test you are NOT required to take the same test that the schooled children take, &quot;any nationally normed student achievement test&quot; and I would stay clear of the FCAT altogether (my two cents).  If you go to the official Florida website you can read the statute.  I don&#39;t know the web address but if you search under &quot;State of Florida&quot; it should be the first to come up.  Once there go to the state laws. The statue is Title XVI, Chapter 232.0201, Home Education Programs.  A copy of the law can also be found at www.helpsonline.org (or maybe .com, can&#39;t remember).  If you still can&#39;t find it, e-mail me back, I&#39;ll mail it to you.  <br/>
