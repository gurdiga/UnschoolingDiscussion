&gt; Hey gang,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s a great Microsoft joke I got from my brother (he runs with scissors<br/>
&gt; also):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the<br/>
&gt; computer industry with the auto industry and stated, &quot;(i)f GM had kept up<br/>
&gt; with the technology like the computer industry has, we would all be<br/>
driving<br/>
&gt; $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon.&quot;<br/>
&gt; In response to Bill&#39;s comments, General Motors issued a press release<br/>
&gt; stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be<br/>
&gt; driving cars with the following characteristics:<br/>
&gt; 1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.<br/>
&gt; 2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; new car.<br/>
&gt; 3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would<br/>
&gt; have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut<br/>
off<br/>
&gt; the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For<br/>
&gt; some reason you would simply accept this.<br/>
&gt; 4. Occasionally, executing maneuver such as a left turn would cause your<br/>
car<br/>
&gt; to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to<br/>
reinstall<br/>
&gt; the engine.<br/>
&gt; 5. Only one person at a time could use the car unless you bought &quot;CarNT,&quot;<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; then you would have to buy more seats.<br/>
&gt; 6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,<br/>
five<br/>
&gt; times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but it would only run on five<br/>
&gt; percent of the roads.<br/>
&gt; 7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would all be<br/>
&gt; replaced by a single &quot;general protection fault&quot; warning light.<br/>
&gt; 8. New seats would force everyone to have the same sized butt.<br/>
&gt; 9. The airbag system would ask &quot;are you sure?&quot; before deploying.<br/>
&gt; 10. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, you car would lock you out and<br/>
&gt; refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle,<br/>
turned<br/>
&gt; the key and grabbed hold of the antenna.<br/>
&gt; 11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand<br/>
&gt; McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need nor<br/>
&gt; want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the<br/>
cars<br/>
&gt; performance to diminish by 50 percent or more. Moreover, GM would become a<br/>
&gt; target for investigation by the Justice Department.<br/>
&gt; 12. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to<br/>
&gt; drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the<br/>
same<br/>
&gt; manner as the old car.<br/>
&gt; 13. You&#39;d have to press the &quot;start&quot; button to turn the engine off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
