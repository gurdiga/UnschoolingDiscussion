<div id="ygrps-yiv-977915790">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Here is a news article that appeared in Japan yesterday. The story would <br/>
be comical if it weren&#39;t so serious.<br/>
<br/>
Intimidation and ridicule are deeply ingrained in Japan&#39;s educational <br/>
system, so this kind of problem should come as little surprise. Still, it <br/>
seems amazing that the instructor supposedly never realized he had done <br/>
anything wrong until an issue was made of the incident.<br/>
<br/>
Which just goes to show you that some people just don&#39;t get it -- and <br/>
that maybe classroom teachers *themselves* are the ones who need a little <br/>
instruction in what fairness, respect and rightness are all about.<br/>

TEACHER CANED FOR QUESTIONABLE ETHICS CLASS<br/>
<br/>
By Ken Okuma<br/>
Mainichi Shimbun <br/>
<br/>
FUKUOKA -- A public elementary school teacher who forced his third-grade <br/>
pupils to point out kids they didn&#39;t want to have in their ethics class <br/>
has been forced to make a shame-faced apology. <br/>
<br/>
The 51-year-old teacher at the Maidashi Municipal Elementary School in <br/>
Fukuoka apologized to the third grader who was humiliated in front of his <br/>
entire class, when two-thirds of his classmates said they didn&#39;t want to <br/>
have him around. <br/>
<br/>
The teacher, whose name is being withheld, also apologized to the little <br/>
boy&#39;s mother. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I never dreamed the kids would put their hands up [when I asked who they <br/>
didn&#39;t want in the class anymore]. I treated the situation lightly, which <br/>
caused me to teach in an improper manner,&quot; school officials quoted the <br/>
teacher as saying. <br/>
<br/>
Board of Education officials in Fukuoka said that the incident occurred <br/>
during an ethics class on June 14 after the teacher had finished reading <br/>
the children a story. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay. Who, like the main character in the story we&#39;ve just read, doesn&#39;t <br/>
need to be in our class any longer?&quot; the teacher asked the pupils. He <br/>
then read through a list of the pupils in the class and ordered the <br/>
children to raise their hands if there was someone they felt shouldn&#39;t <br/>
have been studying with them. <br/>
<br/>
Of the three children pegged by their classmates, about two-thirds of the <br/>
class had raised their hands when one boy&#39;s name had been mentioned. <br/>
Though the teacher then forced pupils to say something nice about the <br/>
boy, sources say that his shock at being ostracized by his peers was <br/>
great. He apparently returned to his home in tears. <br/>
<br/>
After realizing what an ordeal he had put the boy through, the teacher <br/>
apparently apologized. But school officials learned what happened when <br/>
they received a letter of complaint from another pupil&#39;s mother. The <br/>
teacher went and apologized to the boy&#39;s mother on June 30 once his <br/>
misdeed had become known. <br/>
