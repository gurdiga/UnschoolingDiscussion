He&#39;s no longer on the list.  The fuel AND the fire are being provided by <br/>
people arguing about whether it was right for someone to have been taken off <br/>
this list MONTHS ago, even though the list owner and moderator have already <br/>
come and explained their positions.<br/>
<br/>
This is MASSIVELY unhelpful and not about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I had three extra homeschooled kids for 32 hours or so, and they just went <br/>
home.  It was fun, but now Holly is decompressing.  Marty wants to get <br/>
online.  Kirby&#39;s still at work. I&#39;m going to make food.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Teresa, I really think you&#39;d have just had to have been there to <br/>
understand what happened. This trying to dissect the whole thing <br/>
after the fact seems pointless and irrelevant. If you&#39;re really <br/>
curious, it&#39;s all in the archives.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So, that brings to mind the question..Why weren&#39;t the respondents<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;also banned, since they continued to perpetuate the disruption? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you think the police should pick up accusers or victims when they pick up <br/>
perpetrators?  <br/>
<br/>
I worked at a Dunkin&#39; Donuts right after I got out of college.  Graveyard <br/>
shift, in Santa Fe, right next to an ACTUAL old spook graveyard.   <br/>
<br/>
When the cops were in there, I became aware that it was  not the rapists who <br/>
took them away from hot coffee and donuts.  It was the victims, reporting the <br/>
rapes.<br/>
<br/>
Too often people blame the victim for having &quot;disturbed the peace&quot; because <br/>
until the victim squawks &quot;Save me!&quot; nobody was pressing them to do anything, <br/>
and they were eating their donuts.<br/>
<br/>
So if people said &quot;Ned please don&#39;t,&quot; and &quot;Ned, that&#39;s off topic,&quot; and &quot;Ned <br/>
that&#39;s irritating,&quot; how are THEY guilty of the disruption?  They were trying <br/>
to end the disruption.<br/>
