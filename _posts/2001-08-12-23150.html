&gt; I believe that being largely an unschooler doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t slip a<br/>
&gt; little bookwork/study/drills in when you feel the need.  I really don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think that that detracts from the unschooling way at all.  There can be<br/>
&gt; hard-core devoted unschoolers, and at the same time people who go by the<br/>
&gt; unschooling philosophy yet still take an eclectic approach at times.  It<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t have to be an all-or-nothing approach.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I mean, you CAN say, &quot;We unschool except when we do school&quot; but how much<br/>
sense does that make?<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t be a vegetarian who occasionally enjoys a nice juicy steak. You<br/>
can&#39;t be an unschooler who uses an enforced math curriculum. Unschool means<br/>
un school.<br/>

I never said that. &quot;DO SCHOOL&quot; to me means schedules, assignments, time<br/>
slots, grades, and all that junk.  I am more than justified calling<br/>
myself an unschooler even though I occasionally (I don&#39;t know, once a<br/>
week, twice a week?) ask my kids to fill out a math sheet whenever they<br/>
feel like it. I may even say that I want them to do it before bedtime. Or<br/>
lunchtime. or before they can get on the computer to play. My four year<br/>
old is just learning to read, and he LOVES to do workbooks and &#39;read&#39;<br/>
with me. If I say &quot;hey Kyson, come here with mom and do this sheet,<br/>
okay?&quot;, I can&#39;t be an unschooler???  to me, that is a far cry from<br/>
forced, scheduled work.  They are not forced, not stressed. <br/>

I have to agree.  My son and daughter love to do workbook pages, but I certainly don&#39;t sit them down at 9 a.m. every Tuesday and Thursday for an hour of 3+4=  It is just another aspect of learning, and why not?  We consult textbooks, encyclopedias, maps, use crayons, glue, paper, scissors-all very much &#39;school&#39; items.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is true, but if you are asking them to come and do a worksheet, then it <br/>
is my belief it is not unschooling at all. No matter how much we  may think <br/>
it is not coerced, it is by asking them to do it. If workbooks are lying <br/>
around the house, and they pick them up and want to do them, that is a <br/>
different thing. That is their choice and that to me is what unschooling is. <br/>
Choice. . . the choice to learn what, when, why. I don&#39;t measure what my <br/>
young people are doing. . . there is no need to measure it, and compare it to <br/>
where &quot;they are suppossed to be&quot;. They are already exactly where they are <br/>
suppossed to be, wherever that is at this moment in time. It is so hard to <br/>
let go of that school mentality because we have all been indoctrinated with <br/>
it most of our lives. We are I guess what you would call very radical <br/>
unschoolers, and I still struggle just about every day with wanting to <br/>
&quot;suggest&quot; certain things rather than letting it flow, and it is because of <br/>
the years of school conditioning we have all had. But I do believe <br/>
unschooling is a way of life. . . no forcing of workbooks, worksheets, tests, <br/>
etc. And when I ask my child to do a worksheet, that is forcing, in my <br/>
opinion. . . very subtle maybe, but still forcing.<br/>

you were, that is fine too! :)<br/>
<br/>
If you have the workbooks laying around, like any books, at some point they <br/>
will pick them up. We have all kinds books laying around the house, and when <br/>
interested in them, the kids pick them up. Quinton is 2, and picks up stuff <br/>
and asks us to read to him which we do. Lelia who is 12 will pick up <br/>
Mothering Magazine and read it, or Organic Gardening, which are my magazines. <br/>
If it lays around, someone picks it up and reads it. We have had workbooks <br/>
laying around. . .we don&#39;t right now, because we aren&#39;t completely unpacked <br/>
from moving. . . and Lelia is not interested in them, although Quinton may be <br/>
at some point. If he asks me to help him with something, I will. I guess it <br/>
would depend on the circumstances as to whether I would drop whatever I am <br/>
doing at the moment, but with Quinton I most likely would, because the <br/>
attention span is so short. With Lelia, I could probably set up a time when <br/>
we could look at something together, if she asked. Generally I am just about <br/>
always available though. And just to be clear, we are definitely a work in <br/>
progress. . . I am not saying we get it right all the time. . . we are still <br/>
evolving our unschooling, and I suspect we will always be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4473486">My two were much older when we started our homeschool journey, so they already knew all about worksheets and workbooks. But if I had a younger one who had not picked up a workbook that had been laying on the table for a week or a month I might try a few tricks. When they are at the table eating lunch or whatever I might come in and pick up the book myself and say &quot;ooh cool&quot; After they ask what? I might tell them that this workbook has some fun pages to color on. They might take the bait then and want to do it.  <br/>
I like crossword puzzle books. Get a few for yourself and work on them when you are around your kids. If they ask to do it also you could say No. or Well, this one is mine, but I could get you one of you own. or Sure, just put it on the table when you&#39;re through. If you have a question let me know.<br/>
If learning is important and exciting for you, then it will be important and exciting for the kids.<br/>

is merely a facilitator of the child&#39;s desire to learn something, then call <br/>
it unschooling.  If it&#39;s the parent, then go ahead and do it that way but <br/>

<br/>
Scissors and paper were not invented for school.  Neither was glue.  Medieval <br/>
craftsmen didn&#39;t go to school, but they made glue for whatever purposes the <br/>

	Tracy<br/>
<br/>
I think it all depends on the situation and age of the child.  In life<br/>
things are seperated somewhat into subjects.  Granted, there is a lot of<br/>
overflow into other areas and the lines are not very clearcut, but if<br/>
someone is really into Physics, then they are really into Physics.  And will<br/>
want to learn about Physics.  Since Physics (like math) effects everything<br/>
in the universe, it is easy to learn about without learning about physics<br/>
specifically, but at some point when the child grows, if the interest is<br/>
still there (or in engineering, biology, computers, business, etc, etc,<br/>
etc), and the child is seriously interested in pursuing this in life, she/he<br/>
is going to have to learn some math, and that math is going to have to be<br/>
learned as math.  You cannot get your PhD in Physics without extensive math.<br/>
It is hard to be an accountant without knowing math.  They may pick up on a<br/>
lot of math that they will or will not need in &quot;real life&quot;, but unless they<br/>
are given some sort of book and really learn it, it would be a rare child<br/>
who teaches themselves through everyday experience about unreal numbers and<br/>
advanced calculus.<br/>
So... I think it depends.  I want my children to be whatever it is they want<br/>
to be when they grow up, and to follow whatever they want to follow as they<br/>
grow.  But if they are interested in following a certain path, and that path<br/>
requires specialized knowledge about a certain subject, I will definitely<br/>
let them in on what they&#39;re going to need to know to follow that path<br/>
successfully.  And then they will decide whether or not they want to fulfil<br/>
it.<br/>

am going to talk about two of them. I had a restuarant. All of the things I <br/>

years later, I started my ow landscape company. I was horrible at science in <br/>

I just don&#39;t think anything a person does, whether its an engineer, an <br/>

lot of math that they will or will not need in &quot;real life&quot;, but unless they<br/>
are given some sort of book and really learn it, it would be a rare child<br/>
who teaches themselves through everyday experience about unreal numbers and<br/>
advanced calculus. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Math comes easy to my husband, and he LOVES these things.  He has no concerns <br/>
about unschooling.  When the kids get on the brink of something new, he <br/>
casually mentions something and they take bait or not.  No child wants a PhD <br/>
in physics.  When an adult wants one, he has already decided he&#39;s willing to <br/>
study formal math.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of college students start with algebra or geometry because they hated <br/>
math at school or just didn&#39;t get it. LOTS of the high school kids who get <br/>
good grades in math, and who score high on SAT math, do not really understand <br/>
that math more than they needed to pass tests and do multiple choice <br/>
standardized tests.  They don&#39;t know what the math is for.  They can&#39;t <br/>
conceive of plugging any real-world data into those formulae.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t try this at home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better for them to understand what calculations are needed for a real <br/>
purpose, like how thick a dam needs to be or how to calculate the spill flow, <br/>
than to be full of numbers without pictures.<br/>
<br/>
Many of those who go on to use math professionally would have learned it on <br/>
their own (or did, for fun, outside of school, or during school while <br/>
ignoring a history teacher or something).  MOST of those who had math drills, <br/>
exercises, textbooks, etc. in school learned to fear and dislike math.  Many <br/>
of those, had they been allowed to wait until the questions were forming in <br/>
their heads naturally.  If the information is given in response to a question <br/>
from the child (or teen or adult) it will have a place in his head to stick.  <br/>
If it&#39;s given prescriptively two things happen (well lots, but these two <br/>
too):   it might turn the kid off to math or make him feel he doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand it, and it robs him of the opportunity of discovery.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355109937">I understand what you are saying and agree with you... to a point :)<br/>
My husband would not have his current job, or be able to aspire to the job<br/>
he wants, without having his degree in Physics.  He would not have been able<br/>
to get that degree in Physics without knowledge in advanced math.  It is a<br/>
little bit hard to pick up advanced math in everyday life...<br/>
Now, if he was interested in Physics and went off and picked up books and<br/>
things like that to learn about physics to prepare for the college courses,<br/>
thats great.  And if he was informed one way or another that advanced math<br/>
will be needed to achieve his goals, then he may have wanted to learn about<br/>
math, or decide it isn&#39;t worth the effort.  If he wanted to learn math, he<br/>
would have to pick up some books and figure it out.<br/>
What I am saying is that if a child is interested in something, one should<br/>
facilitate the learning in that area.  Does that make sense? If my daughter<br/>
is interested in becoming a doctor, I&#39;ll probably say, &quot;well, lets go figure<br/>
out what it is a doctor needs to know&quot; and point her in the right direction<br/>
for her research, and then she&#39;ll have to decide the best way for her to<br/>
learn that information.<br/>
If my daughter is interested in the arts or biology or becoming an auto<br/>
mechanic, then I would do the exact same thing.  But she would probably have<br/>
to learn a minimal amount of formal math for any of those (knowing the names<br/>
of some of the statistical processes would be helpful for Biology, for<br/>
example.).  I&#39;m not saying one should sit the kids down and learn it, I&#39;m<br/>
just saying that a person needs to know some things if they are going to<br/>
want to become some things, or go to college to become some things.  And I<br/>
do believe that children will pick up on most of it on their own if they<br/>
have the resources to explore, but if a more intense knowledge is going to<br/>
be needed in a particular area in order to reach their goals, they may need<br/>
to focus on that area so they can continue with what it is their interested<br/>
in.<br/>
We&#39;re a very science-oriented family so this is why I feel this way.  I know<br/>
with my husband&#39;s Physics degree and what he eventually wants to do with it,<br/>
he needed a formal college education.  I know with what I am working towards<br/>
(I am a life-long student... but my goal is Environmental Studies though I<br/>
started out wanting to be a paleontologist) I need to know certain things.<br/>
I know I can learn most of it on my own, if I wanted to, but because I do<br/>
not have the background or foundation in certain areas (math and chemistry)<br/>
I am going to have to go back and learn it.  If I had been shown a long time<br/>
ago (like early teens) that this was stuff that would be good to know to<br/>
fulfil my dreams, it would have been good information to know and I may (or<br/>
may not have) taken the time to learn those things that would help me later<br/>
in life.<br/>
Does this make any sense? Or am I totally rambling?<br/>
I thought that unschooling was basically being your child&#39;s facilitator.  If<br/>
they are interested in something, you point them in the right direction or<br/>
find the resources they need.  If they really want to do something that<br/>
requires knowledge in other areas, why would you not show them these other<br/>
things?<br/>

I<br/>
am going to talk about two of them. I had a restuarant. All of the things I<br/>

years later, I started my ow landscape company. I was horrible at science in<br/>
school, and now I found myself immersed in it, and loving it because I was<br/>
choosing what science to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t think anything a person does, whether its an engineer, an<br/>

I am making my point clearly. . . NAK<br/>

&gt;If the &quot;anything and everything&quot; include teaching in such a way that the kids<br/>

not this.  I don&#39;t believe they have to learn it on their own.  I believe <br/>
they have to *decide* on their own to learn it.  If a kid wants to learn <br/>
something like chemistry, for instance, and gets stuck or just doesn&#39;t even <br/>
know where to start, that&#39;s where our job as facilitator comes in.  At that <br/>

something, is still unschooling because they&#39;ve asked for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075185642">**I never said that. &quot;DO SCHOOL&quot; to me means schedules, assignments, time<br/>
slots, grades, and all that junk.  I am more than justified calling<br/>
myself an unschooler even though I occasionally (I don&#39;t know, once a<br/>
week, twice a week?) ask my kids to fill out a math sheet whenever they<br/>
feel like it. I may even say that I want them to do it before bedtime. Or<br/>
lunchtime. or before they can get on the computer to play.**<br/>
<br/>
Can whenever they feel like it be never?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not free choice if there&#39;s no choice about whether to do it or not, or <br/>
if not doing it means they can&#39;t do something else.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about the materials. I&#39;d say the same thing about requiring kids to <br/>
plant a garden, count jellybeans, draw a picture, daydream. If it&#39;s not <br/>
optional, it&#39;s something other than unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about the materials. My family owns probably more textbooks and <br/>
workbooks than the average school-at-home family (at least the <br/>
school-at-homers I know pick one text and stick with it). I pick up stuff as <br/>
I find it that someone might find useful, that I find intriguing, stuff <br/>
people request. It&#39;s available for use whenever a child wants it. It&#39;s <br/>
readily seen as an option. I even pull it out some days and ask if anyone <br/>
wants to try it out. But the day I make it non optional I stop calling myself <br/>
an unschooler and start calling myself something else, probably relaxed <br/>
eclectic homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the question of &quot;is it unschooling&quot;, I think it&#39;s an educational <br/>
mistake to set anything up as different from all other sorts of learning. <br/>
Especially something as inherently interesting and exciting as mathematics. <br/>
Especially with children who haven&#39;t ever been schooled into thinking of some <br/>
things as harder than or less interesting than others. <br/>

obsessed with animals, mainly dogs and cats. Recently she has started talking <br/>
about college and animal sciences. So she realizes that if she is going to go <br/>
to college, there are some things she is going to have to learn. She doesn&#39;t <br/>
like math much, especially when I am involved because of a bad start we had. <br/>
So I have totally backed off of it. But I will help her find out what she is <br/>
going to need and how to get that information. But it is totally her choice. <br/>
I am not going to push her to learn it . . . she is going to have to decide <br/>
when and how much she is going to do in preparation. I will provide the <br/>
materials and help her as much as I can, and when I can&#39;t help her, find <br/>
someone else who can. She goes to an unschool resource center and she was <br/>
telling me that she is planning on doing a lot of math there this year. . . <br/>
she realizes its not something she wants to do at home, and she actually <br/>
likes it when she does it there. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my main point is that I am not going to force anything on her and am <br/>
actually going to let her take responsibility for her own learning (but will <br/>
help as much as is wanting to receive help). Make sense?<br/>

facilitate the learning in that area.  Does that make sense? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you think facilitating learning means math worksheets, though, it&#39;s not <br/>
going to becom unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...point her in the right direction<br/>
for her research, and then she&#39;ll have to decide the best way for her to<br/>
learn that information....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Research isn&#39;t necessary.  Things evolve.  A child who thinks she wants to be <br/>
a doctor will see/hear/feel/experience things from here til then that will <br/>
either strengthen her desire or weaken it.  None of that take research.  The <br/>
strengthening experiences will themselves be learning experiences.   Taking <br/>
care of a wounded bird.  Growing mold.  Looking at mushrooms in the yard.  <br/>
Research would be on the spot, for a purpose.  Looking in a reference book, <br/>
calling a vet, asking a neighbor, checking websites.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But she would probably have<br/>
to learn a minimal amount of formal math for any of those &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not in advance. As she moves toward the mastery, the knowledge grows <br/>
organically IF it is left as the whole world instead of divided up.  The math <br/>
needed to rebuild an engine has to do with engine rebuilds.  First you hear <br/>
people talk about it, maybe you read the packages of rebuild kids of <br/>
subsystems at the store, then you see someone doing it, or hear someone <br/>
talking by phone to a more experienced mechanic about gaps or torques or bore <br/>
holes.  Gradually it starts to make a lot of sense and becomes applicable to <br/>
other uses.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If they really want to do something that<br/>
requires knowledge in other areas, why would you not show them these other<br/>
things?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The knowledge isn&#39;t &quot;in another area&quot; is what people are trying to say, I <br/>
think.  The knowledge is right there.<br/>
<br/>
For review of biology or chemistry, there are charts, illustrated books, <br/>
video games, all kinds of things which are not a straight-out Biology 101 <br/>
course, three hours, with one hour lab (or the 9th grade equivalent).   <br/>

&lt;&lt;  If a kid wants to learn <br/>
something like chemistry, for instance, and gets stuck or just doesn&#39;t even <br/>

point our teaching them something, or finding someone to teach them <br/>
something, is still unschooling because they&#39;ve asked for it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  My objection was to assigned math because a (young) child said he <br/>
might want to be an engineer someday.<br/>
<br/>
Me answering questions or passing a questioning kid to someone who knows <br/>
answers I don&#39;t know isn&#39;t the same as me thinking a stated interest is a <br/>
request for a course of study separate from the particular questions in the <br/>
child&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
A kid who asks about the name of an angle hasn&#39;t just requested a 36 week <br/>
course in geometry.  <br/>
<br/>
A child who says &quot;I love horses and would love to be a vet&quot; hasn&#39;t just asked <br/>
you to make her take a chemistry course.<br/>

We have lots of &quot;stuff&quot; around, stuff that either Cacie or I saw<br/>
somewhere that we thought might be interesting, or stuff that migrated to<br/>
our house somehow... actually, we have no workbooks, except fopr the<br/>
miquon books. We got those about 6 months ago, because I had seen them<br/>
and liked the sort of problem-solving, pattern-finding  approach they<br/>
used, and Cacie was going through a phase where she liked solving<br/>
arithmetic problems orally and liked solving logic problems on paper and<br/>
online. So, I got them, opened it up, showed her, and asked if she wanted<br/>
to try it. She said okay, and for a few weeks did maybe 5 pages a week.<br/>
She hadn&#39;t had much experience in writing numbers, so she was really<br/>
getting off on forming the numerals very neatly and not backwards. The<br/>
books also had sections where you made up your own problems, and she<br/>
liked to make really long ones. Her interest sort of ebbed after a month<br/>
or so, and now she hasn&#39;t picked up the books in probably 6 months. I<br/>
still think they&#39;re cool, I&#39;ve thumbed through most of them myself, but<br/>
if she never does another page in them I won&#39;t be concerned at all. She<br/>
actually says she loves math, and yesterday we had some conversation that<br/>
ended up with us writing the 9 and 11 multiplication facts, because of<br/>
the patterns...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It would depend on what I was doing. I probably wouldn&#39;t drop everything<br/>
if I were, say, halfway through trimming the cats&#39; toenails or<br/>
stir-frying lunch or reading a chapter in Princess Bride. OTOH, if I were<br/>
sweeping the floor or folding laundry or reading email I probably would.<br/>
I don&#39;t see anything wrong in asking my daughter (8) to wait for 20<br/>
minutes for my help - I have my own life, too. Likewise, if I wanted her<br/>
help carrying the futon outside, I would certainly wait while she<br/>
finished her game of Hearts on the computer or her chapter on Calvin and<br/>
Hobbes. I see it as a mutual respect thing. I would probably expect an 8<br/>
year old to be able to wait longer than a 4 yr old.<br/>

	&lt;&lt;A child who says &quot;I love horses and would love to be a vet&quot; hasn&#39;t just<br/>
asked<br/>
	you to make her take a chemistry course.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, but are you going to say &quot;that&#39;s nice, you can be anything you want&quot; or<br/>
are you goiung to say &quot;if you really want to be a vet I can help you find<br/>
out what it takes to do that&quot; and then if the child grows and decides that<br/>
is the path she wants to take help her find the resources to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying if one has a specific leaning towards a particular field to<br/>
prepare them for it, I am just saying that if a child is interested in a<br/>
particular field, and wants to explore that area, there are some<br/>
prerequisites they will need to know.  The parent does not have to sit them<br/>
down and make them learn it.  All the parent needs to do is let the child<br/>
know how to find out what it all entails.  Unearth resources so the child<br/>
can get a better look at what is needed.  And if the child wants to learn<br/>
those things, help them or find the help needed to help them, if any help is<br/>
required at all.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to jump at every whim - but you don&#39;t need to ignore a<br/>
child&#39;s passions.<br/>

<br/>
In my experience children under the age of 8 or so don&#39;t really grasp the<br/>
abstract 3 + 4 = ?? type of math.  It is better to use manipulatives -<br/>
if I have 3 M&Ms and get 4 more, how many do I have?  Any thing (popsicle<br/>
sticks, M&Ms, cheerios, blocks) can be used as manipulatives.  Once a<br/>
young child *sees* it and *touches* it, it is much easier for them to<br/>
relate to it.</div>

That is all I am saying - knowledge can be learned in many ways, and each<br/>
child will want to learn differently.  I&#39;m not talking about taking a course<br/>
or doing worksheets , I am talking about gaining knowledge in *some* way.<br/>
There are thousands of ways to do research, there are thousands of ways to<br/>
acquire knowledge.  Let the child choose what way is best for her, but she<br/>
has to know what her options are.  And that is where the parent comes in.<br/>

You can teach yourself math, but some resources would probably be helpful<br/>
(like a book, tutor, software, etc) in order to learn everything needed to<br/>
jump right into a calculus class in college.<br/>

that one!  I use topology when I am trying to untie a knot for my<br/>

you and I might disagree on what disciplines are included in advanced<br/>
math! I have a BS in math, a MS in computer science where I specialized in<br/>
simulation (ie using the physics to make the computer simulate parts<br/>
of the real world) so I see math every where!<br/>
