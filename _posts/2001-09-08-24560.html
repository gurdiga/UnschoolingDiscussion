<div id="ygrps-yiv-271538104">&lt;&lt; But I draw the line at Teletubbies.  Not<br/>
because I think it is mindlass but because we are a family and no-one has<br/>
total control of the TV.  If I am in the room, I get veto rights on<br/>
anything I don&#39;t want to watch.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do the kids have that veto too?<br/>
<br/>
Teletubbies has some very cool geography videos, and they show them twice.  <br/>
So if there&#39;s one Holly thinks I&#39;d really like, she can go and get me and we <br/>
can watch the whole thing together.  <br/>
<br/>
She likes to look at how the thing was produced---how the costumes work, how <br/>
the sets work (doors and slides and such) and discuss what they&#39;re trying to <br/>
teach babies with this or that scene.  She&#39;s not watching it as a baby would. <br/>
 She&#39;s watching it as someone who&#39;s interested in theatre and TV production <br/>
and education would.<br/>

&quot;Everything counts.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I already answered that but I&#39;ll expand on it a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they do have veto rights too.  There are a few &#39;rules&#39;  or &#39;truisms&#39;<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody can veto &quot;whose line&quot;  (Rachel&#39;s favorite)<br/>
Anybody who wants to veto my 3 favs has to set up a tape so I can watch<br/>
later. (It&#39;s good to be queen)<br/>
When the choices involve a show on a certain channel all rules change due<br/>
to inconsistenciesin broadcast clarity.  <br/>
Broadcast wins over tapes we own - always<br/>

Teletubbies is a show for little kids.<br/>
<br/>
Same as Mr. Rogers.  That show has been reviled unfairly by lots of people <br/>
who said he talks too slow, he babies people.  Well fine--if it&#39;s too slow <br/>
and babyish for a person, THAT person shouldn&#39;t watch it, but to tell others <br/>
that they&#39;d be stupid if they watched it seems to me to be the same kind of <br/>
pressure kids get from other kids at school about doing what&#39;s cool, having a <br/>
cool notebook, a cool lunch box, brand-name shoes, listening ONLY to the <br/>
music their friends deign to approve.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to come in and say &quot;Turn off that screaming&quot; about any musical TV <br/>
show that wasn&#39;t country and western or rock&#39;n&#39;roll.  Any musical theatre, <br/>
classical, opera, got &quot;turn off that screeching&quot; or one of very few variants <br/>
on that.<br/>
<br/>
She told me to turn off The Friendly Giant (a very cool CBC show where he <br/>
played recorder and told stories).  <br/>
<br/>
She was wrong to do that, and I still remember those incidents to this day as <br/>
her being mean, unfair and small minded.<br/>
<br/>
So I have personal issues. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
But my kids won&#39;t have.  And other people&#39;s kids don&#39;t ahve to have either, <br/>
if the parents will consider how it would feel to have someone who weighed <br/>
eight times as much saying &quot;TURN THAT OFF, IT IS (and thereby by extension <br/>
&quot;you are&quot;) STUPID.&quot;<br/>

See, you see the nice little Teletubbies in their perfect little world,<br/>
and KNOW there&#39;s something nasty lurking deeply underground. *nodnod*<br/>
And then there&#39;s the loudspeaker telling the citizens wht they must<br/>
do...*Shudder*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732881133">Sandra, you really need to get over changing what is said or taking your<br/>
personal history and reading something into things that simply isn&#39;t there.<br/>
Someone asked why the show bugged them and I answer MAYBE because the show<br/>
is written AS IF children are STUPID.  That means MAYBE that is what BUGS<br/>
them.  That means the show talks down to kids.  Good grief, children that<br/>
have been interviewed about the show have made comments about it.  I&#39;ve had<br/>
kids in my house make statements like &quot;do they think we&#39;re stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you have personal issues you need to deal with them and not use them to<br/>
color and shade conversations here and then make big leaps such as the one<br/>
you made from how a show is written to people being called a name.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>See, now if I were going to tell any of mine to turn off that . . .<br/>
whatever, it would lead to some interesting happenings.  Rachel would<br/>
drag it over to my mom and they could listen to big band together, or I<br/>
would be telling Jenni to turn off music that we fight over because I<br/>
want the disc in the craft room and she wants it in the bedroom (we share<br/>
a lot! but we really need a cd burner!)<br/>
<br/>
But, seriously,  I do ask them to turn stuff off occassionly.  But the<br/>
flipside is they ask me to turn MINE off just as often.  It&#39;s a matter of<br/>
courtesy.  The only person in the house that never gets asked to shut it<br/>
off is my DH who only listens to his shortwave stuff in the basement.  My<br/>
point though, is that the girls don&#39;t think I am calling them stupid<br/>
because I don&#39;t want to be listening to a certain CD right at that<br/>
moment, but that may be because when I say turn it off, I don&#39;t yell,<br/>
&quot;Turn that crap off&quot;  but rather I say, &quot;I&#39;m getting tired of this one.&quot;<br/>
or &quot;can I have a little quiet for a while?&quot; or &quot;Can you please change<br/>
that to something else?&quot;  They will then either change it, turn it off or<br/>
go to their rooms with it.  <br/>
