<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509883995">This reminds me of the conversation I heard yesterday. My DS was warming up <br/>
with two other boys before Tae Kwon Do class. Inevitable &quot;where do you go to <br/>
school?&quot; &quot;I homeschool&quot; conversation. The others boys could not understand -- <br/>
you could just see the deeply puzzled looks on their faces -- my son&#39;s <br/>
explanation of being at home and just having fun all day. &quot;You don&#39;t have to do <br/>
worksheets?&quot; was asked at least 3 times. &quot;What about homework?&quot; DS: &quot;Well, I&#39;m at <br/>
home, smile, so there&#39;s no homework.&quot; Puzzled looks. &quot;What about worksheets?&quot; DS <br/>
tried to explain that it was like TKD, you like the class and you practice <br/>
when you want to at home and you keep going and you learn. And he told them about <br/>
computer stuff he does and they seemed to get that. &quot;But you don&#39;t have to do <br/>
worksheets?&quot; I left then and TKD started soon but I&#39;m not sure the two boys <br/>
got much out of the conversation -- but I think DS, once again (he survived 7 <br/>
months of K and was bored to tears), was reminded that he&#39;s not missing much in <br/>
school. :)<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how you might communicate that to your children or if you need <br/>
to . . . but it reminded me.<br/>

I worry so much about Sarah (or the other children) coming to me later on in <br/>
