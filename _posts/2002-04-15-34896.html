There are more porn books than in the past too, but my kids aren&#39;t reading <br/>

I don&#39;t limit books because there&#39;s some trash being published.<br/>

<br/>
What causes violent crime anyway?  I was just thinking about this.<br/>
<br/>
If violent crime has such factors as frustration, feelings of powerlessness, <br/>
revenge, general resentment, perceived failure (one of school&#39;s special gifts <br/>
to over half of their &#39;customers&#39;), low self-esteem or the habit of being <br/>
easily swayed by peer groups, then it seems to me that unschoolers aren&#39;t at <br/>
much risk of becoming violent and even if Clockwork-Orange style we exposed <br/>
them to every Arnold Schwartzenegger movie without sleep or food, they would <br/>
probably take the toothpicks out and ask questions about special effects and <br/>
Austrian accents.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, whose kids aren&#39;t violent, whose kids laugh a lot, and watch all the <br/>
TV they want, which usually isn&#39;t much.</div>

think anyone claims that TV and movies are the only factor causing <br/>
crime. (The quick answer for why crime rates are down is that the <br/>
size of the criminal age-group is down. Most crimes are committed by <br/>
men between the ages of 15 and 30. This cohort has been declining for <br/>
several years and will keep dropping for several more. Another factor <br/>
is change in the laws which has led to many criminals being locked up <br/>
longer, but whether that makes much difference in crime rates is <br/>
harder to say.)<br/>

Just for the record everybody, this t.v. conversation good versus bad has<br/>
been going on forever.  The first time I ever saw a television set was 1950<br/>
( I remember trying to figure out how they could have gotten all those<br/>
people to fit in there!).  Within ten years I was hearing the controversy,<br/>
we got it from our teachers, grandparents, etc.  You will probably never<br/>
convince each other to come around to your way of thinking but I am enjoying<br/>
the debate tremendously.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032681585">Oh, I know the answer to that one and it is that they aren&#39;t!  However, the<br/>
way of reporting them has changed.<br/>
<br/>
I worked for a mid-sized city and went along to a police chiefs convention.<br/>
They discussed ways to improve the public image and one of those ways was<br/>
how police reports were handled.<br/>
<br/>
For example, unexplained deaths in the past were placed in the unsolved<br/>
homicides column, now they aren&#39;t.  If your house is burglarized, not all<br/>
police agencies will send someone out to take a report.  They will advise<br/>
the homeowner to come in and fill out a form.  Lots of people won&#39;t do that,<br/>
they just let it slide.  If an officer is called out on a dv and all he does<br/>
is arrest one of the parties on a drunk in public, it doesn&#39;t go down in the<br/>
record as a dv.<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of years ago, where we live now, this was brought to the<br/>
attention of the police force at the convention that was held at the local<br/>
university.  Our crime stats are astrinomical because absolutely everything<br/>
was being reported and an officer was sent out on absolutely every call<br/>
dispatch received.  Also, if dispatch received a call as dv, even if no<br/>
police action was taken.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People feel like violence is up - but, in fact, the violent crime rate is <br/>
down almost everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
From the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Monday, January 1, 2001<br/>
<br/>
In 1996, there were 168 homicide cases, a record high. By the close of 2000, <br/>
the number of homicide cases had dropped to 95 for the year.<br/>
<br/>
The police department -- which serves Las Vegas and about 7,400 square miles <br/>
of unincorporated areas of Clark County -- recorded a 16 percent dip in <br/>
homicides for 2000, compared with 1999. <br/>
<br/>
Urban areas throughout the nation have recorded similar decreases in their <br/>
homicide and violent crime rates in recent years. <br/>
<br/>
It is the fourth consecutive year that homicides have declined by double <br/>
digits, and the tally for 2000 represents another benchmark in Las Vegas <br/>
history. <br/>

<br/>
If that were true there would have been no crime before 1950!<br/>
<br/>
Do you think before then they blamed listening to the radio?  <br/>
<br/>
And what before radio?  Reading newspapers and becoming desensitized to <br/>
stories of outlaws shooting lawmen?<br/>
<br/>
Before the printing press?  Why might there have been crime in the 1300&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s spurious to blame TV.  People want a magical sacrifice.  They want <br/>
things to DO to save their children, like forbidding TV, limiting sodas, <br/>
having a set bedtime, and by performing those magical sacrifices, they hope <br/>
to ensure an outcome impressive to the neighbors and grandparents.<br/>

No, the Penny Dreadfuls!   :)  (I just LOVE that term)<br/>

<br/>
I just went looking and found this site, which compares the current blaming <br/>
of violence on movies with the nineteeth century blaming of violence on the <br/>
dime novels/penny dreadfuls. A short excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Similar concern over violence presented as entertainment was felt a century <br/>
earlier. Rising juvenile crime rates from the mid to late nineteenth century <br/>
coincided with an increase in working-class literacy and the growing <br/>
availability of &#39;penny dreadfuls&#39;, which were widely read by adolescent boys. <br/>
Usually sold in penny instalments (hence the title) these publications gave <br/>
the juvenile reader a weekly diet of murder, mystery and mayhem with a <br/>
smattering of piracy and highway robbery thrown in for good measure. They <br/>
were one of the earliest forms of literature to target children directly inste<br/>
ad of via their parents, catering for adolescent boys&#39; tastes at a price they <br/>
could easily afford. Parents could not be sure their children did not read <br/>
penny dreadfuls any more than modern parents can be sure their children do <br/>
not watch violent videos. From the mid-nineteenth century onwards penny <br/>
dreadfuls provided an easy scapegoat for virtually all male juvenile crime. <br/>
Much of the concern came from clergymen, journalists and magistrates (18), <br/>
who seem to have assumed that the penny dreadful readership was almost <br/>
entirely young, working-class and male, exactly the audience that <br/>
twentieth-century commentators consider most at risk from the &#39;bad influence&#39; <br/>
of video nasties.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
:)  The more things change ...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, if anyone is interested in reading a &quot;penny dreadful&quot; or two, Standford <br/>
has put the text of several of them online, out of their enormous collection. <br/>

sexual abuse of children going on nowadays, but it was happening in the <br/>
early 1900s when my mother was little.  You just never heard about it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, how would a murder go unreported? If there&#39;s a body, or even when <br/>
someone goes missing, it gets reported and investigated.  I can see <br/>
something like rape going unreported, because women are afraid of how <br/>
they&#39;ll be treated by the courts, etc.  I can even see how B & Es might go <br/>
unreported, if people think nothing will be done.  But I can&#39;t see violent <br/>
crimes other than rape going unreported.<br/>

<br/>
I do believe that the stats are not an accurate picture of society.  I <br/>
think violence is up overall.  BUT - I don&#39;t think we live in such a <br/>
dangerous world that we all have to turn our homes into arsenals and <br/>
castles and I&#39;m not afraid to walk through a dark parking lot (unless <br/>
I know it&#39;s a bad area to begin with).  <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This was a crime that took place in North America.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought Dubya said it was an act of war.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It is YOUR opinion that it is comparing apples and oranges, not MY<br/>
opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course it&#39;s my opinion.  Whatever I write is my opinion, not<br/>
necessarily<br/>
&gt; someone else&#39;s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Do you think nobody that was living here had anything to do with it.  Or<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt;EVERYBODY involved a foreigner and you think that crimes commited in this<br/>
&gt; &gt;country by foreigners don&#39;t count?  That certainly would lower the crime<br/>
&gt; &gt;rate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Let&#39;s see how many illegal aliens are in this country?  And they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;commit crimes or it doesn&#39;t count?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course their crimes count.  I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;See that is one of the differences here.  I think all crimes count and<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt;want to be selective.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No, I&#39;m just saying that 9-11 was an act of war. The fact that the<br/>
&gt; perpetrators were temporarily living in the U.S. has nothing to do with<br/>
&gt; it.  If your truth is that crime is going up, then so be it.  Makes no<br/>
&gt; difference to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834522965">Hi! I&#39;m Valerie<br/>
We are new to unschooling but have been homeschooling for 7 years. One<br/>
year I lost my head and taught at a private school for tuition so my<br/>
children could attend. Anyway, I won&#39;t go into that.<br/>
We live in Camp LeJeune, NC. My DH is a Navy man of 14 years.<br/>
I have 3 kids, dd 14, dd 11, ds 9. <br/>
I have always tried to get around NOT doing some of our workbooks and I<br/>
never felt good about going over the same material over and over again.<br/>
Anyway, I know you have heard the same thing from others. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m<br/>
quite typical.<br/>
I have been lurking for most of the day.<br/>
I have a little opinion on the TV issue. Well, there are many rabbit<br/>
trails on here about them. :O)<br/>
I just wanted to introduce myself before I jumped in! :O)<br/>

&gt; can improve?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>From what we have learned the bombers don&#39;t believe that their lives are<br/>
desperate, bad or lacking in any way. They find that the Western culture<br/>
with all of it&#39;s modernization and frills is very evil, as well as any<br/>
modernization on that side of the world.<br/>
Starvation is considered the norm and violence is a part of their<br/>
religion.<br/>
They kill themselves because they are taught that this life has no value<br/>
whatsoever and paradise awaits them when they discard their earthly<br/>
flesh. When they murder innocent people they believe that they are being<br/>
merciful to those people by ending their corrupted lives. These bombers<br/>
are taught from their earliest youth that the only reason they are alive<br/>
is to die in &quot;Holy Jihad&quot; and to be with Allah very soon.<br/>
Notice that the bombers are very young, most not even in their 30&#39;s. I<br/>
think that their government has intensified it&#39;s teachings of Holy Jihad<br/>
in the last couple of decades. <br/>
The Navy is serving the Detainees and POW&#39;s in Camp X-Ray. My husband is<br/>
attached to the fleet hospital down there. He didn&#39;t have to go as he<br/>
was with Division at the time the hospital moved down there and he was<br/>
&quot;left behind&quot; (though he stands a 50/50 right now of having to deploy in<br/>
September for the change over.) The docs that come back are telling us<br/>
how young the detainees are. The average age is 15. Their lives were so<br/>
rugged that they can&#39;t believe the excellent treatment they are getting<br/>
in Camp X-ray!<br/>
They have never known what medical care really is! Needless to say,<br/>
quite a few claim to defect. But I don&#39;t believe it. They are so<br/>
brainwashed into the Jihad thing, it will take a lot to turn around that<br/>
powerfully evil teaching.<br/>
Anyway, don&#39;t want to get off on a tangent. :O) But this is an<br/>
interesting subject and my children and I have been following since<br/>
Sept. 11 as closely as possible.<br/>
Thanks for letting me share.<br/>

They kill themselves because they are taught that this life has no value<br/>
whatsoever and paradise awaits them when they discard their earthly<br/>
flesh. When they murder innocent people they believe that they are being<br/>
merciful to those people by ending their corrupted lives. These bombers<br/>
are taught from their earliest youth that the only reason they are alive<br/>
is to die in &quot;Holy Jihad&quot; and to be with Allah very soon.<br/>
Notice that the bombers are very young, most not even in their 30&#39;s. I<br/>
think that their government has intensified it&#39;s teachings of Holy Jihad<br/>
in the last couple of decades.<br/>
The Navy is serving the Detainees and POW&#39;s in Camp X-Ray. My husband is<br/>
attached to the fleet hospital down there. He didn&#39;t have to go as he<br/>
was with Division at the time the hospital moved down there and he was<br/>
&quot;left behind&quot; (though he stands a 50/50 right now of having to deploy in<br/>
September for the change over.) The docs that come back are telling us<br/>
how young the detainees are. The average age is 15. Their lives were so<br/>
rugged that they can&#39;t believe the excellent treatment they are getting<br/>
in Camp X-ray!<br/>
They have never known what medical care really is! Needless to say,<br/>
quite a few claim to defect. But I don&#39;t believe it. They are so<br/>
brainwashed into the Jihad thing, it will take a lot to turn around that<br/>
powerfully evil teaching.<br/>
Anyway, don&#39;t want to get off on a tangent. :O) But this is an<br/>
interesting subject and my children and I have been following since<br/>
Sept. 11 as closely as possible.<br/>
Thanks for letting me share.<br/>

I have put a lot lot lot of thought into that also and I really can not<br/>
come<br/>
up with anything.  Are they doing this from loyalty, from fear of some<br/>
kind<br/>
of personal threat (maybe against their families or something), are they<br/>
brainwashed, are they mind controlled by maybe drugs and other things?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing has ever made any sense to me regarding this.  It is totally<br/>
beyond<br/>
my comprehension.<br/>

&gt; Sharon, mostly, I agree.  There is no definite line that says somethig<br/>
&gt; violent is no longer a crime but rather an act of war.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about suicide bombers lately and I have<br/>
&gt; to wonder what happens to make them willing to do that?  How desperate<br/>
&gt; do their lives have to be?  How much have they lost hope that things<br/>
&gt; can improve?<br/>
