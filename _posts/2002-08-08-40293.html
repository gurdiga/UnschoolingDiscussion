<div id="ygrps-yiv-607577133">For anyone who likes to explore the Bible, there is a site called blueletterbible.com where you can do a word search of the text.  Once you find something, you can then read it in about 6 translations (including Greek and vulgate Latin, if you&#39;re talented!).  It&#39;s where I do my research, since I also like to see which concepts remain intact regardless of translation.<br/>
<br/>
And to Sandra, actually Israel was a recognized country with a monarchy, etc, until about 70 C.E.  It didn&#39;t exist again as a separate political entity until recreated in 1948.<br/>
<br/>
And to Kim - Genesis 1:1-27, it says God created the heaven, then the earth, then light, then earth separate from water, then plants, then day & night, then animals, then man & woman at the same time.  In Genesis 2:4-25, God created the earth, then the heavens and BEFORE the plants were created, he created man, then planted a garden, then formed the animals to keep man company, then when they didn&#39;t work, God made woman.  And BTW, adam is a hebrew word which means &quot;man&quot; and &quot;adamah&quot; is a hebrew word for earth, so many scholars see the Adam creation story as a sort of play on words.<br/>
