<div id="ygrps-yiv-672115406">&quot;So unschooling is based on emotion and faith, rather than<br/>
reason and evidence?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you some reason and evidence; my children.<br/>
<br/>
My 15 y.o. can fix your computer or build you a new one if you need<br/>
help. He can tell you all about the weaponry used throughout history,<br/>
up to exactly how many rounds per second a specific model of gun can<br/>
shoot.<br/>
He can talk history and politics and religion with the best of them<br/>
and probably correct you on history you thought you knew but was<br/>
false....like George Washington not being the first president of the U.S. <br/>
I could go on and on. Not one of those interests equals success. Not a<br/>
single one of those interests means anything unless he chooses to use<br/>
them a certain way.  Every one of them could equal HUGE success if he<br/>
decided to employ them to a decided end.<br/>
<br/>
Success is not measurable...unless you decide that what a person owns<br/>
dictates success. I prefer to think of success as a person feeling<br/>
they are achieving the life they choose. How many people do you know<br/>
personally that are doing exactly what they choose and love their<br/>
lives? How many?<br/>
<br/>
Every one of my four children is creative, thoughtful, intelligent,<br/>
fun and learning constantly. That&#39;s more than I can say for most human<br/>
beings. It&#39;s pretty easy to see how unschooling makes sense if you<br/>
agree that humans are born with the desire to learn. Unmotivated<br/>
people usually have some pain keeping them from fulfilling their<br/>
dreams. Humans WANT to have a good life, they WANT to learn. The only<br/>
thing I&#39;ve ever seen to stop learning, is coercion.<br/>
<br/>
I love that recent article on Barb Lundgren&#39;s child. He&#39;s done some<br/>
really off beat things...including being homeless for a while (by<br/>
CHOICE), but every bit of his life is about choice. He loves his life,<br/>
he sees it as a big learning adventure and he knows he is capable of<br/>
acheiving whatever he chooses.<br/>
That&#39;s more than most people ever have. And it&#39;s enough for this<br/>
family to be convinced that unschooling is the only life for us. <br/>
<br/>
Just the fact that my children feel empowered to do anything they<br/>
dream, that IS enough. It&#39;s more than enough.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about the esoteric things in life you can&#39;t measure.<br/>
It&#39;s about the REAL things in life, the things that matter the most.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but you&#39;re not here to understand unschooling are you? That&#39;s<br/>
ok....I need to get back to my busy, happy, interesting life<br/>
anyway..no more time to talk. There are lovely leaves blowing across<br/>
the yard, I think I&#39;ll go sit in the breeze for a bit and sip some tea<br/>
with my lovely children.<br/>

<br/>
Let&#39;s try an analogy.<br/>
<br/>
One could marry for love, or for prestige, or for money.  Science can&#39;t <br/>
explain or measure love.  Would it be better somehow for everyone to <br/>
marry for money, because that&#39;s quantfiable?<br/>
<br/>
We might be able to find data that proves that people that marry for <br/>
money have more money, but would that prove that they made the right <br/>
decision?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bad analogy. ;-) Marriages for love are not very successful<br/>
and that&#39;s quaitified by the devorice rate.  Besides,<br/>
I do think that love is measurable, at least on an<br/>
oridnal scale.  Who is the greatest love of your life?<br/>
