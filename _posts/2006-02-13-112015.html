<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133300632">This is in response to some of the posts I&#39;ve been reading in here <br/>
about &quot;not smart enough to unschool&quot; and &quot;Dodd-kid envy&quot; &lt;grin&gt;, also <br/>
based on my work lately with new unschooling parents of &#39;deschooling&#39; <br/>
teens, and other of my own pensive meanderings.<br/>
<br/>
When parents are feeling worried that &quot;learning isn&#39;t happening&quot; , or <br/>
when they read the great ideas from the smart parents on this list, <br/>
or when they see heartwarming stories of the Dodd family (or others) <br/>
(which I love by the way, and I have three amazing best-friend kind-<br/>
hearted curious unschooling teens living with me too) - when <br/>
unschoolers (especially new unschoolers) read those posts I have seen <br/>
that it easy for some people to have that feeling like &quot;I&#39;m a bad <br/>
unschooler&quot; and/or &quot;my kids are bad unschoolers.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Strewing and googling and going on adventures and relaxing about TV <br/>
and letting go of chores (etc!) are ALL good ideas for those of us <br/>
who want to live fun lives of unbridled happiness and learning.  But <br/>
it might not be the first step, it might be a distraction from the <br/>
underlying issue that has been mentioned many times here, but it&#39;s a <br/>
horse worth beating which is that<br/>
<br/>
RELATIONSHIPS COME FIRST.<br/>
<br/>
I have found, especially with parents of adolescent unschoolers, that <br/>
many parents don&#39;t really know how to have warm open free loving fun <br/>
relationships with their teen-aged children.  I suppose it has <br/>
something to do with puberty and burgeoning independence, and <br/>
probably not having had delicious relationships with ones own parents <br/>
as adolescents, and then reinforced by the sad fact that most people <br/>
expect teens to be trouble and it doesn&#39;t even occur to them that <br/>
they could adore their adolescent children as much as their younger <br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the reason, many parents struggle with their teens, <br/>
unschooling or not.<br/>
<br/>
For parents who have taken on the legal responsibility of &quot;educating <br/>
their children&quot; (however your state mandates it), it is a convenient <br/>
way to express our own conflicted-ness about our teens, by worrying <br/>
about their &quot;education&quot; - whether they are learning enough, whether <br/>
they are curious or generous or busy enough , or whether we know <br/>
enough to `teach&#39; them.   <br/>
<br/>
I encourage unschooling parents who are experiencing any kind of <br/>
conflict with or about their teen (either rumbling around inside the <br/>
parents&#39; head, or being acted upon in real life), to make a <br/>
commitment to put the RELATIONSHIP with this child above everything <br/>
else.  (Again!)<br/>
<br/>
I notice again and again that this is harder for parents in the <br/>
adolescent years, and so I find it helpful for parents to renew their <br/>
consciousness and intention about it, before they start trying to <br/>
find ways to &quot;be a better unschooler&quot;.  Teens are probably not going <br/>
to be distracted or entertained by clever strewing or road trips or <br/>
movie rentals.  If they are not feeling cherished accepted and <br/>
totally supported by their parents, they&#39;ll just ignore or fight with <br/>
a parent who is trying to mask an unsupportive relationship <br/>
with &quot;good unschooling practices.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids are fun and funny and smart and playful and interesting and <br/>
interested and they include me in what they are thinking and doing <br/>
and we have a great time together and I never wonder if they are <br/>
learning enough. BUT I don&#39;t attribute this to my own (or their ) <br/>
smarts or curiosity or strewing or adventures (although I do all <br/>
those things too) - I believe it absolutely begins in our love for <br/>
each other.  My relationships with my kids are based completely in <br/>
trust and love, which (as has already been said on this list a <br/>
zillion times) matters WAY more than anything.  <br/>
<br/>
And FROM this loving foundation my kids continue to unfold and <br/>
blossom into amazing human beings.  (As would anyone!)<br/>

It seems to me that school can ruin the relationship, school at home  <br/>
can ruin the relationship, or years of attempted control and rules  <br/>
can ruin it.<br/>

I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t make people feel good whose kids were in school  <br/>
until they were teens, but it&#39;s worth saying.<br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes one way to make the relationship better is to get really  <br/>
involved in interesting situtations, hobbies, explorations, clubs,  <br/>
friendships, music groups... moving quickly toward a life based on  <br/>
happiness and learning.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent is thinking of waiting until they feel they have a good  <br/>
relationship with a fourteen year old boy to start inviting him  <br/>
out...   he&#39;ll be 19 before he goes.<br/>
<br/>
Relationships are based on more than words.  Sometimes too much  <br/>
dialog makes relationships worse.  Shared experiences create  <br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Mine are.<br/>
<br/>
A teen who has been in school and controlled by parents at home might  <br/>
not be interested in spending that time with the parents, but that&#39;s  <br/>
another matter.<br/>
<br/>
A parent who can&#39;t find a movie rental that would interest her and  <br/>
the teen together, or a parent who isn&#39;t willing to watch 24 or  <br/>
Desperate Housewives with a teen; a parent  unwilling to take a kid  <br/>
to Denver or Dallas (choose your semi-local equivalent eight-hour- <br/>
drive-requiring overnight) for a major exhibition or concert or  <br/>
something; a parent who cannot possibly bring something home that  <br/>
would be of interest to his or her own child... that parent probably  <br/>
isn&#39;t a good candidate for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How might a teen feel accepted and supported without offers of things  <br/>
to do, have, see, visit?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m missing the &quot;distracted and entertained&quot; angle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-723313625"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I haven&#39;t seen many people whose kids have been unschooled for years<br/>
 </span></blockquote>struggle with teens.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This makes sense; my experience is with new unschoolers and <br/>
deschoolers (and schoolers).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; moving quickly toward a life based on happiness and learning.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my post I wanted to emphasize the &quot;happiness&quot; Â–the relationship <br/>
part, over the concern for &quot;learning,&quot; because I&#39;ve seen that it is <br/>
easy for parents to get sidetracked when they have their eye <br/>
on &quot;learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Teens are probably not going to be distracted or entertained by<br/>
 </span></blockquote>clever strewing or road trips or movie rentals.&lt;&lt; (me)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Mine are.&lt;&lt; (Sandra)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine are too.  This was directed at new unschoolers, deschoolers, and <br/>
people who are having a rough time when they focus on the &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
part.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;A teen who has been in school and controlled by parents at home <br/>
 </span></blockquote>might not be interested in spending that time with the parents, but <br/>
that&#39;s another matter.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is my main point:  that if the kids aren&#39;t having fun, don&#39;t <br/>
want to be with the parents, and look like they &quot;aren&#39;t learning,&quot; I <br/>
would encourage parents to look first at the quality of their own <br/>
relationship with their child, before jumping to some kind of a <br/>
conclusion that &quot;if I did exactly what the Dodds (for example) do, my <br/>
kids would be as cool as them, and then unschooling would be working&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;How might a teen feel accepted and supported without offers of <br/>
 </span></blockquote>things to do, have, see, visit?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
If a parent is harboring distrust, judgment, desire to control or <br/>
mold (etc), the child will likely not go along with the parents <br/>
offers, which could be (I think) misinterpreted as &quot;unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
working.&quot; I think all people (to some degree) can tell if someone who <br/>
is claiming to be &quot;fun&quot; is actually trying to control us, and teens <br/>
are probably the least likely to be polite about it.  So an important <br/>
first step for parents is to look inside and see if they really trust <br/>
their child&#39;s process and have the relationship as the top priority.  <br/>
<br/>
What will most likely happen next, when a parent gets herself and her <br/>
inner world sorted out a bit, is she will probably want to do have <br/>
see and visit things together.  This will then come from a place of <br/>
love friendship and fun, rather than from a place of &quot;this is what <br/>
good unschoolers are supposed to do.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t take years to <br/>
arrive at this place, sometimes just a ten minute time-out in which <br/>
we breathe and remember what&#39;s the most important.  The more history <br/>
of control a parent has, the more times she will probably have to re-<br/>
commit to a relationship based on love and trust instead of coercion <br/>
and distrust.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Maybe I&#39;m missing the &quot;distracted and entertained&quot; angle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe I wasn&#39;t clear enough that I was addressing new unschoolers and <br/>
deschoolers.  I have seen new unschoolers try to extract and follow <br/>
instructions on how to &quot;do the right thing&quot; so that unschooling <br/>
will &quot;work,&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; will happen, rather than focusing on <br/>
having a loving and trusting relationship with their child, and <br/>
letting it flow from there.  <br/>
<br/>
Not a new concept to this list by any means, but I was just in the <br/>
mood to say it again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481851757">Thank you Amy, I have a tween 11 yo dd, who has been difficult <br/>
lately.  She is already gone into puberty and the emotions at times <br/>
are very hard to understand.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be the best mom, but at times no matter what I do it is the <br/>
wrong thing.  I feel like I&#39;m living on egg shells with her, my hubby <br/>
says the same thing.  <br/>
<br/>
We are trying to put her first, but she can make that very difficult <br/>
at times.  I think it because she doesn&#39;t know what she wants either.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you need to know what she wants, as long as you are  <br/>
willing to try not to give her what she&#39;s NOT wanting right now.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she just wants space and time and to have drinks and food put  <br/>
where she can get them without ceremonial communal meals all the  <br/>
time.  Maybe she would like to have her laundry delivered folded  <br/>
without comment or pressure.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s VERY hard for me to leave a child or husband or guest alone.  I  <br/>
want to chat and smile and tell stories and go somewhere.  Sometimes  <br/>
when that seems really inappropriate with my family for some reason,  <br/>
I find a friend I haven&#39;t talked to for a while, and we go to lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your daughter would like for you to go to lunch with someone  <br/>
else and let her have the house to herself for an hour or two.  It  <br/>
won&#39;t last forever.  She&#39;ll only be 11 for a year.  Girls have real  <br/>
stuff happening in those years, and it can feel very uncomfortable at  <br/>
several levels, but it doesn&#39;t last forever.<br/>
