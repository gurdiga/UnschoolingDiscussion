<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781983755">I thought this was a great little poem. It really makes ya think! Lori in TX<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; SMILE!!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
  She smiled at a sorrowful stranger.<br/>
  The smile seemed to make him feel better.<br/>
  He remembered past kindness of a friend<br/>
  And wrote him a thank you letter.<br/>
  The friend was so pleased with the thank you<br/>
  That he left a large tip after lunch.<br/>
  The waitress, surprised by the size of the tip,<br/>
  Bet the whole thing on a hunch.<br/>
  The next day she picked up her winnings,<br/>
  And gave part to a man on the street.<br/>
  The man on the street was grateful;<br/>
  For two days he&#39;d had nothing to eat.<br/>
  After he finished his dinner,<br/>
  He left for his small dingy room.<br/>
  He didn&#39;t know at that moment<br/>
  That he might be facing his doom.<br/>
  On the way he picked up a shivering puppy<br/>
  And took him home to get warm.<br/>
  The puppy was very grateful<br/>
  To be in out of the storm.<br/>
  That night the house caught on fire.<br/>
  The puppy barked and barked the alarm.<br/>
  He barked till he woke the whole household<br/>
  And saved everybody from harm.<br/>
  One of the boys that he rescued<br/>
  Grew up to be President.<br/>
  All this because of a simple smile<br/>
  That hadn&#39;t cost a cent.<br/>
