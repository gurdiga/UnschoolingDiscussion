<div id="ygrps-yiv-430250507">Hi, Karen - sorry for the late response.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm ... for most of my life I was convinced that I was shy .. shy and<br/>
introverted.  I dreaded the prospect of being uncomfortable in new<br/>
situations so much that I usually avoided them.  It became a kind of<br/>
self-fulfilling prophecy ... even when I was 17 years old and took the<br/>
Meyers Briggs test for the first time, I thought, &quot;There must be some<br/>
mistake&quot; when it indicated I was almost evenly split between<br/>
introverted and extroverted.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until about a year ago (after another personality test) that<br/>
I realized how wrong I&#39;d been about myself.  All that time I&#39;d thought<br/>
for sure I was a total introvert because I BEHAVED as one.  It hadn&#39;t<br/>
occurred to me to take into consideration my INCLINATION to be<br/>
extroverted; or to realize that in my daydreams I was almost *always*<br/>
the life of the party. I&#39;m one of those people who stands at the bus<br/>
stop and envisions herself striking up conversations with everyone<br/>
there - yet in reality never says a word to any of them. I *want* to<br/>
say or do something, but something holds me back, and in the end I<br/>
usually kick myself for being held back.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped *me* when I was younger (and still helps now)<br/>
was to start off in a structured environment (e.g. a class) in which<br/>
everyone participated to some degree. I believe my initial shyness is<br/>
related to my high level of self-consciousness and my uncertainty<br/>
about people (is she mean? is he crude?). Being introduced to others<br/>
within a group takes pressure off of me (I don&#39;t have to dazzle them)<br/>
and also allows me to &#39;safely&#39; observe the others. After I&#39;ve had a<br/>
chance to &#39;feel&#39; them out, I relax a bit and am very receptive to<br/>
being approached.<br/>
<br/>
In dealing with strangers in a non structured environment, as a child<br/>
(and as an adult) it was helpful to have a connection; for example, a<br/>
friend who already knew the strangers.  That friend acted (without<br/>
knowing) as a diversion so that all the focus wasn&#39;t on me (who&#39;s the<br/>
new girl?); I was also able to see how she interacted with the other<br/>
kids and get a feel for them less directly.  I think a lot of people<br/>
can relate to this, no?<br/>
<br/>
To this very day, I am uncomfortable and indecisive in most one-on-one<br/>
situations- even with friends; I am still very self-consciousness, and<br/>
concerned about not putting anyone out. However, when I&#39;m with several<br/>
folks or a large group, I&#39;m VERY vocal, extroverted and often take<br/>
charge. Believe it or not, sometimes I&#39;m called on  to do public<br/>
speaking and always enjoy it (though of course I get butterflies<br/>
beforehand).<br/>
<br/>
So I think a distinction ought to be made between those who *want* to<br/>
be actively involved, but have some fears, and those who are more<br/>
passive.  I&#39;m of the former group, but have a few friends who are of<br/>
the latter. There is *nothing* wrong with them.<br/>
<br/>
All that being said, in the past year I&#39;ve traveled to three different<br/>
countries alone - and only recently found out that such a thing is<br/>
considered WEIRD and SCARY to most people.  Admittedly, I often kept<br/>
to myself and didn&#39;t initiate many conversations with strangers I came<br/>
across, but just the fact that I had enough confidence and<br/>
self-assurance  to travel solo gives me some encouragement that I&#39;ll<br/>
become braver with time and practice. All those years, it was just my<br/>
fears blocking me; if you determine your child to have &#39;that kind&#39; of<br/>
shyness, I think you ought to help him conquer his fears so that he<br/>
can engage in the things he wants to do.  If your child is simply a<br/>
passive person who prefers observing to participating,  I definitely<br/>
wouldn&#39;t push him. We shouldn&#39;t all be the same!  Hope I&#39;ve been<br/>
helpful as much as I&#39;ve been longwinded.<br/>

            I have a young son ( 5yo) that is also very shy.  Looking<br/>
back, is there anything that ,in your opinion, would have helped you<br/>
with your shyness?  Do you think your parents could have or should<br/>
have handled things differently, so that you would maybe have been<br/>
more comfortable in new situations?  I remembered being extremely shy<br/>
as a child, and I definitely did not want to be pushed into anything,<br/>
and I don&#39;t want to push my child too much, either; however, sometimes<br/>
he needs that encouragement... to<br/>
find out that things can be fun to do.  Yesterday we went to an Easter<br/>
egg hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Before we left to go, my little boy expressed how he was scared.  I<br/>
told him that we were going to go ahead and go, and that he could see<br/>
what it was like when we got there, and that if he decided that he did<br/>
not want to do it, that he did not have to. Well, he ended up taking<br/>
part,and enjoying it, so I was happy for him, but the shyness is<br/>
something we have to deal with continually.<br/>
So, if you, or anyone else, would have any thoughts on dealing with<br/>
shyness, I&#39;d like to hear them.  Thanks in advance!<br/>
