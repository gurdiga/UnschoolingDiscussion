&quot;It is change, continuing change, inevitable change, that<br/>
is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible<br/>
decision can be made any longer without taking into<br/>
account not only the world as it is, but the world as it<br/>
will be.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Sorry to everyone on digest and those that don&#39;t like reading the same damn<br/>
&gt; thing a million times.  I somehow forgot to cut the post I was responding<br/>
&gt; to.  Guess this adds another post, but just so ya know!<br/>
