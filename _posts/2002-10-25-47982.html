<br/>
&lt;&lt;Google, as a private company, is generally not bound by the free-speech <br/>
guarantees in the First Amendment, which applies to restrictions imposed by <br/>
government. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not &quot;generally.&quot;  Absolutely.  <br/>
THEY, Google, has the right of free speech, which means they don&#39;t have to <br/>
say what they don&#39;t want to say.<br/>
<br/>
I bet somewhere in the &quot;about Google&quot; fine print it says that they won&#39;t <br/>
provide racial-hate-crime stuff to Germany (or whatever/wherever).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But Edelman said that private or not, the company has a public <br/>
responsibility as a widely used resource. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dictionaries are widely used.  American Heritage decided in the 1970s (or <br/>
late 60&#39;s maybe) to include the word Fuck.  It was their right under American <br/>
law to do so.  Other dictionaries weren&#39;t pressured to follow suit.  Nobody&#39;s <br/>
saying dictionaries have the responsibility to list every  utterance they&#39;ve <br/>
ever heard.<br/>
<br/>
Encyclopedias have the right to pick and choose what they put in AND what <br/>
they say about it AND what pictures they include.  They can&#39;t put in <br/>
everything in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Google kind of turns the World Wide Web into an encyclopedia.  And they do it <br/>
very, very well.  And if they block listings of Aryan nation bullshit, I <br/>
don&#39;t mind at all.<br/>
<br/>
Especially since it&#39;s to countries which don&#39;t quite have the full freedom of <br/>
speech we do.<br/>
