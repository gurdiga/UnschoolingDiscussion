Aw, come one, Joyce---You&#39;d look great in fatigues with your head shaved! I <br/>
bet that, if I looked around here, I could find you  *just* such a group! You <br/>
might have to move though...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-445413166">&lt;&lt;Heck,<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to mix with a group of White Separatist Movement<br/>
homeschoolers (should such a group exist).&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Found something:<br/>
<br/>
A White Separatist &quot;homeschool ciriculm&quot;!!<br/>
<br/>
This stuff is NOT about learning, it&#39;s about politics.<br/>
Learning about politics might be fun for some people, and some might not want <br/>
to even peek at this nastiness here, but here are some  links.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
looked at the &quot;ciriculm&quot; myself yet.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sigrdrifa   awesome site with tons of great info on various topics like: <br/>
herbal remedies, a homeschool ciriculm with heritage in mind, canning and <br/>
preserving food, recipes, tons of great stuff for women to make their lives &quot;more <br/>
natural&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something to surprise and offend everyone here.  The main group is <br/>
called  &quot;Church of True Israel,&quot; and has waving confederate flags.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/info/links.html">http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/info/links.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The spelling only reinforces the stereotype of ignorant southerners, but here <br/>
are some examples with which I did NOT tamper:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Modern History Sources  Modern(and acient) history layed out. If you <br/>
remember where these links are-THIS AND THE ONE ABOVE-your kids should do well in <br/>
history. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;THE COVENANT VISION MINISTRY  Austrialian site &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I found an Australian site yesterday (though they could spell <br/>
&quot;Australia&quot;) looking for Christian Homeschooler-belief sites.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Cross Daily   Not Identity sort of a catch all (suposed to be) religous <br/>
site. Sorta Judeo Christian. Might come in handy for refrence. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.  &quot;Religous refrence&quot;  for proving white supremecy at all things but <br/>
spelling, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
That page has lots more links &quot;Avaiable&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;White Womens Links <br/>
<br/>
At Home Mothers  This is a &quot;join&quot; the group, but there is a lot of info and <br/>
articles FOR FREE <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a &quot;&#39;join&#39; the group&quot; must be secret code for something.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are the KKK links.<br/>
<br/>
These are not the Christian Homeschoolers I was talking about, but you know, <br/>
they&#39;re closer to them than I am.<br/>
<br/>
Yet someone a day or two ago suggested that by me saying Christian <br/>
Homeschoolers existed, I was on the slippery slope toward becoming Hitler.<br/>
<br/>
No, saying &quot;some people are racist Nazis&quot; is NOT what causes rifts and <br/>
divisions.<br/>
It&#39;s the people who have bunkered in with people of their own kind and <br/>
started spewing lies about people outside.<br/>
<br/>
When liars and truthtellers are equated, someone&#39;s not being thoughtful or <br/>
fair.<br/>
