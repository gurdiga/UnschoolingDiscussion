-=-The  TV, our new target, the icon of &quot;acceptable&quot; reasons to coerce our <br/>
kids.   Parents eager to erect limits and exert control have found another  <br/>
unassailable demon as their justification.-=-<br/>

 <br/>
AHA!!<br/>
 <br/>
Their justifications and controls aren&#39;t unassailable, though, on this  list. <br/>

Good phrase, &#39;unassailable demons.&#39;<br/>

I thank God for that every day!  My favorite side effect of unschooling is the habit of giving every thought the &quot;inspection&quot;.  Changing one&#39;s paradigm on learning seems to infect how one looks at everything.  I love reading about all the angles that thoughtful people have discovered on a given topic.<br/>
<br/>
Lanora, the TV hater, has enjoyed the discussion along with me.  Even though it is not one of her favorites, she can tell you how valuable it can be as a learning tool.  She does love movies though and will watch MAD TV, CSI or the comedy channel.  I doubt she would ever be able to limit her own children&#39;s TV and lamely justify doing so.<br/>
