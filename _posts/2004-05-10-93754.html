<div id="ygrps-yiv-959231762">Someone one from another list wrote me off list to ask why so many<br/>
unschoolers who like John Holt seemed so &quot;radical&quot;.  She said she&#39;d read<br/>
Holt and didn&#39;t get from his writing what was being described at<br/>
unschooling.com or some other lists. <br/>
<br/>
After a few exchanges turns out she had only read &quot;How Children Learn.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many people, who think the unschooling philosophy as it&#39;s<br/>
discussed on this list is &quot;radical unschooling&quot; and somehow removed from<br/>
what John Holt was talking about.   Of those people I wonder how many<br/>
read beyond &quot;How Children Learn&quot;.   <br/>
<br/>
I recently read &quot;Escape From Childhood&quot; again and a few days ago started<br/>
re-reading &quot;Teach Your Own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In chapter ten, &quot;Learning Without Teaching&quot; Holt says this.  &quot;Life is<br/>
full of ironies.  I wrote &quot;How Children Learn&quot; hoping to help introduce<br/>
the natural, effortless, and effective ways of learning of the happy home<br/>
into the schools.  At times I fear I may only have helped to bring the<br/>
strained, self-conscious, painful and ineffective ways of learning of the<br/>
schools into the home.  To parents I say, above all else, don&#39;t let your<br/>
home become some terrible miniature copy of the school.  No lesson plans!<br/>
 No quizzes!  No tests!  No report cards!   Even leaving your kids alone<br/>
would be better; at least they could figure out some things on their own.<br/>
 Live together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as much as you<br/>
can.  Ask questions to find out something about the world itself, not to<br/>
find out whether or not someone knows it.&quot;<br/>

Also it is important to get the latest edition of these earlier books, with<br/>
the revisions and footnotes - some of which are along the lines of &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
sorry I wrote that then, and I don&#39;t believe it now&quot;.   <br/>
