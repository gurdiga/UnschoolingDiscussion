All those things are great but one can still do even more. I find that<br/>
sometimes when I suggest things that I know my kids are interested in, they<br/>
still say no to them. It seems that my timing is off from theres. And what<br/>
normally would interest them just doesn&#39;t at the time.<br/>
<br/>
So instead of asking, I just place things out and around of interest.<br/>
Anything from books, movies and games to baking stuff like cookie cutters<br/>
and rolling pin. Sometimes just the look suggests so much more to the child<br/>
than the words. Some parents cycle toys too. Boxing some up and putting out<br/>
ones that have been boxed.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving out artsy stuff within eyesight is good too. Not just crayons and<br/>
paper but yarn, glue, paints, playdoh, buttons, material, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I find that talking about my interests to the children is like strewing too.<br/>
It can get them started on similar things or a whole new path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069070257">Erhh...<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t coin the term and don&#39;t pretend to define it,  but I think of it as creating a rich environment with cool things that I know about and that my children wouldn&#39;t know about to ask for.  <br/>
<br/>
In the last week, for example, I have carted home some plastic tubes that are tuned so that if you whack them on something they have a pitch (they come in a set of 8 for an octave), a book on simple origami, a translation of the Egyptian Book of the Dead showig the heiroglyphs and the translation under them, a plastic board version of the game traffic jam, that we have enjoyed playing online, and a &quot;drinking bird.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider it &quot;strewing&quot; that we have paper and markers and pens and art supplies and plastic test tubes and child-friendly chemicals to mix in them and stuff to climb on and stuff to build with.  Those I just consider the basics that every house should have. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider it strewing that we went to the toy store and got a Blinkie that my daughter saw a commercial for and wanted to see. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I do consider it strewing that before buying the Blinkie, I showed her the existence of online review of toys,  and at her request read her a few to see whether we could find out whether the toy was as cool as it looked like it would be based on the commercial.  <br/>
  <br/>
Yeah, for me, the &quot;strewing&quot; is the cool, quirky odd thing that I see that I think they would like -- not what I consider the basics that all children should have access to and not what they see or hear about and ask me for. <br/>

<br/>
I think strewing can involve any of those things as long as the child is a<br/>
willing recipient.  The child may show an immediate interest in something<br/>
you&#39;ve strewn about / suggested, or may ignore it for now but bring it up<br/>
later, or may show no interest ever!  I don&#39;t think it necessarily needs to<br/>
be &quot;subtle&quot;, if by that you mean not even mentioned but just left about ...<br/>
they may never notice it.  I do think it&#39;s important not to be invested in<br/>
the outcome though.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few examples from the past week.  Two that sparked something and<br/>
one that still might. :-)<br/>
<br/>
One involves my youngest who&#39;s 7.  Michael&#39;s been a bit concerned lately<br/>
that he&#39;s not yet reading though his schooled cousin (she&#39;s 6 months older)<br/>
has been for at least a year.  I have been playing with words and sounds<br/>
with him ... not really as games but as they come up in his life and he&#39;s<br/>
been picking it up well.  Anyway, I have a phonics &quot;kit&quot; I picked up many<br/>
years ago and haven&#39;t touched that has a some tapes, easy reader books,<br/>
games and so on.  I brought it out a few months ago and we had some fun<br/>
making short rhyming words with the letters.  He hadn&#39;t asked to use it<br/>
again and I just left it in his closet where he would see it from time to<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
The other day he was in his room fishing for something to do and I pulled it<br/>
out.  It turned into a wonderful spontaneous hour.  His sister (she&#39;s 10 and<br/>
started reading at 9) dropped in and told him about the dumb little books<br/>
she used to have to read at school (she came home in grade 2) and how she<br/>
didn&#39;t read until she found something interesting (Harry Potter).  She<br/>
started reading the easy reader books to him and they howled with laughter<br/>
at the *weak* storylines!  They played with a couple of the games.<br/>
<br/>
I got a chance to mention to them the idea that at school it&#39;s important to<br/>
the teachers that the kids learn to read early so they can read the<br/>
worksheets and so on on their own.  But that right now Michael loves numbers<br/>
and reminded both of them how a couple weeks ago when we played Monopoly<br/>
with his cousin she was quite lost dealing with the money while it was easy<br/>
for him.  It was a great chance for them to see unschooling in action ...<br/>
that they can follow what they are interested in.  That he can pick up more<br/>
reading now over the next months (or years), and his cousin will pick up<br/>
more math as well over time.<br/>
<br/>
I initially strewed the phonics kit around my son when he expressed an<br/>
interest in learning to read but when it did spark something I was much less<br/>
interested in the learning-to-read aspect of it and more in the way I could<br/>
ease his fears about not yet reading!<br/>
<br/>
In another &quot;strewing incident&quot; (LOL!) we went camping on the weekend and dh<br/>
and I decided to strew / bring along the boys&#39; bicycles.  Michael has<br/>
expressed a bit of an interest in learning to ride it but not on the<br/>
sidewalk in front of our house.  Too many spectators!  And Joseph has not<br/>
been interested in riding for the last couple of years.  If we asked them<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d have said no, leave them at home.  Anyway we just<br/>
brought them, along with dh&#39;s bike, because we thought they *may* be<br/>
interested but we agreed not to be at all frustrated if the bikes were left<br/>
untouched.  Well, surprise!  They were the most used items we brought.  And<br/>
although Michael took many tumbles he kept on trying and can now, after 3<br/>
days, ride quite confidently.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, my daughter has been making a number of connections regarding<br/>
Albert Einstein lately.  She&#39;s enjoyed some of his quotes strewn around our<br/>
local Science Centre, a reference to his thoughts on time travel in the<br/>
movie Paycheck, my recent Discover mag devoted an issue to him and she<br/>
looked through the pictorial presentation of his ideas, and so on.  Many<br/>
connections.  A couple days ago at the library I came across a tape of a<br/>
NOVA show about his life and ideas and picked it up.  I mentioned it to her,<br/>
I&#39;ve left it in the TV room, and maybe she&#39;ll watch it.  Or maybe I will put<br/>
it on and watch it and 1, 2, or 3 kids may join me ... or not. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that if I strew something that makes connections to other things<br/>
they are already interested I really just need to leave it around and<br/>
probably mention it to them so they know it&#39;s there.  If there&#39;s something<br/>
new that I think they may enjoy, new as in it really has no relation or<br/>
connection to something they already are interested in, I&#39;m much more likely<br/>
to get a response if I start doing it, reading it, watching it etc myself.<br/>
If I just mention it to them and leave it laying around they are much less<br/>
likely to try it out.  But they&#39;ll likely come check it out and join me if<br/>
they are interested.<br/>

<br/>
How can you tell exciting strewing stories in a short e-mail!?<br/>
I liked the bike story especially.  It could be pretty nice to fall on autumn <br/>
leaves and soft dirt instead of year-round concrete.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce took us to the National Science Museum a couple of weeks ago, and we <br/>
saw a floating pig thing.    I wanted one but they didn&#39;t have any for sale.   I <br/>
wrote down the webpage thinking it would be an easy thing to get later.<br/>
<br/>
Not so easy.  The company doesn&#39;t come out and say how to get one.  Maybe <br/>
they only sell wholesale.  So I googled it and found ONE (1) place offering it <br/>
for sale, so i ordered one ($32 plus shipping).  It arrived while I was in <br/>
Chicago, but the kids opened it, and showed it to Kirby. <br/>
<br/>
Every person who has come over since (except Mo, darn it, who came to borrow <br/>
chain mail for a history class she teaches; I forgot) has been shown the pig.  <br/>
 And Holly discovered that if you shine a laser light at the pig, even though <br/>
it&#39;s not there (you can&#39;t touch it), the light does not pass through it.  And <br/>
if you look down into the chamber at the REAL pig (brace yourselves, <br/>
non-optic-physicists), the real pig has a laser pointing at him too.   OOOOH it&#39;s so <br/>
very wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not finding the online site, and I threw the box away.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a little black flying-saucer looking thing about 8&quot; across, and the <br/>
top has a hole in the middle and can come off.   <br/>
<br/>
Ther&#39;e a little pink rubber pig about 1&quot; long.   You set him in the bottom, <br/>
put the top on, and a ghostly projection-pig appears above the open hole.  And <br/>
right under him is a relflection of HIM, as though he&#39;s standing on a mirror.  <br/>
And he looks real enough to grab, so people try to grab him.<br/>
<br/>
If I can find a photo I&#39;ll send the link.<br/>
<br/>
The laser business really surprised us.<br/>
<br/>
 Kirby returned from a three-day trip to an anime convention in Denver, and <br/>
one of the first things we said was &quot;Shine a laser on the pig!&quot;  He just did <br/>
it, without any other questions.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t find a picture of it, can&#39;t find the papers, don&#39;t remember the <br/>
company name.  Darn it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look later.  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s how I imagined it too. LOL!  In reality, no leaves had fallen yet and<br/>
he found the grass too hard to pedal on so he opted for the gravelly dirt<br/>
road.  After a few tumbles he happily went for long pants and the helmet and<br/>
knee pads we brought.  By the next day he had scrapped his hands a few<br/>
times, and his brother was getting a blister on his hand from changing gears<br/>
(something new he learned about) so Rocco drove into town and picked up some<br/>
bike gloves for both of them.  They had a great time until their butts were<br/>
too sore to ride!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Still a nice story!<br/>
