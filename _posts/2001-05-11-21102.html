  Here&#39;s a question I&#39;ve always had in my mind:<br/>
<br/>
  If the sheets are washed in cold water, won&#39;t the heat of the dryer kill the allergens?  Because of mold pollen, exhaust and dust allergies, we do not hang items to dry - in case we are headed for a thread about dryers and electricity :-).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237930683">I have a friend that is &quot;allergic to life&quot; as she puts it.  She hangs<br/>
everything outside and then just runs them in the dryer for about 10<br/>
minutes.  She says that gets rid of all the pollen and other junk and keep<br/>
her energy bill down.  But, she said if you don&#39;t pull the front/back/side<br/>
(whichever type dryer you have) off and vacuum out the dryer and that exit<br/>
hose thingy about every 3 months, you are defeating the whole purpose of<br/>
using the dryer.  At that point she started to tell me about all the gross<br/>
things that grow in the dryer and don&#39;t die because all of the dryer doesn&#39;t<br/>
get hot enough to kill them and I suddenly decided I had something else to<br/>
do &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084645386">good question annette. I never thought of that and I am allergic to mold and dust. I do wash the darks in cold water, but the whites and sheets always in hot. I&#39;m not sure why...maybe to get the dirt out since cold water doesn&#39;t get the dirt out of whites at all even with bleach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056518637">LOL! Ok how does one take off the door in the dryer to vacuum it out? My dryer has been giving me fits! it won&#39;t dry a cycle in one go anymore, you have to do it in two cycles now in order to dry a regular load...grrrr. I have religiously cleaned out the lint filter and have tried to vacuum down the lint filter with the vacuum hose which wont fit in there of course....but I admit I&#39;m clueless about all this and the landlord is calling in an appliance technician to take a look at it...I don&#39;t own the dryer, its provided as part of the apartment. <br/>

Because in New Mexico there is *nothing* living in or on a dryer.  Vaccuming <br/>
will keep dust/lint down, but then again just about nothing will save us from <br/>
dust here.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re talking physical properties of appliances, sometimes specifying <br/>
conditions or geographical region is important.  <br/>

    &gt;   Here&#39;s a question I&#39;ve always had in my mind:<br/>
    &gt;<br/>
    &gt;   If the sheets are washed in cold water, won&#39;t the heat of the dryer kill<br/>
    the allergens?  Because of mold pollen, exhaust and dust allergies, we do<br/>
    not hang items to dry - in case we are headed for a thread about dryers and<br/>
    electricity :-).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-960096979">Vaughnde,  One area that lint collects and blocks is the hose.  You can clean it out with a special device, or simply replace it.  Any manuals that came with your dryer should have diagrams for taking it apart - for those that do their own repairs or parts replacing.<br/>

    I have a friend that is &quot;allergic to life&quot; as she puts it.  She hangs<br/>
    everything outside and then just runs them in the dryer for about 10<br/>
    minutes.  She says that gets rid of all the pollen and other junk and keep<br/>
    her energy bill down.  But, she said if you don&#39;t pull the front/back/side<br/>
    (whichever type dryer you have) off and vacuum out the dryer and that exit<br/>
    hose thingy about every 3 months, you are defeating the whole purpose of<br/>
    using the dryer.  At that point she started to tell me about all the gross<br/>
    things that grow in the dryer and don&#39;t die because all of the dryer doesn&#39;t<br/>
    get hot enough to kill them and I suddenly decided I had something else to<br/>
    do &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I decided that if I have to worry about whom or what is living in my dryer<br/>
    then I might as well live in one of those bubbles!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-170597675">OMG, that is how houses catch on fire.  Lint builds up inside the dryer<br/>
between the walls and the drum!<br/>
<br/>
Alrighty, you will need a screw driver.  If you look around the edge where<br/>
the top meets the walls you will see where little clips go from the top into<br/>
the walls.  You need to push on the clips and then lift the top.  Vacuum all<br/>
around the drum.  Then you need to take off the back panel (they are usually<br/>
put on with phillips screws) and vacuum around in there.  Also, take off the<br/>
vent hose and vacuum up in the exhaust with that extension thingy for your<br/>
vacuum cleaner.<br/>
<br/>
Some dryers the fronts come off and some you can tilt over backwards and<br/>
take the bottom off.<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, they get clogged up and they do start fires.  And, your lint<br/>
filters don&#39;t work so well when the rest of the machine is clogged.  All you<br/>
are doing is recycling the same lint around and around.<br/>

&gt; LOL! Ok how does one take off the door in the dryer to vacuum it out? My<br/>
dryer has been giving me fits! it won&#39;t dry a cycle in one go anymore, you<br/>
have to do it in two cycles now in order to dry a regular load...grrrr. I<br/>
have religiously cleaned out the lint filter and have tried to vacuum down<br/>
the lint filter with the vacuum hose which wont fit in there of<br/>
course....but I admit I&#39;m clueless about all this and the landlord is<br/>
calling in an appliance technician to take a look at it...I don&#39;t own the<br/>
dryer, its provided as part of the apartment.<br/>

in hot. I&#39;m not sure why...maybe to get the dirt out since cold water doesn&#39;t get <br/>
the dirt out of whites at all even with bleach.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken two dirty socks, washed one in cold and one in hot, <br/>
and they both come out looking the same.  As for bleach......yuck, <br/>
we wouldn&#39;t have it in our house.  It&#39;s too dangerous, and it doesn&#39;t <br/>
get our whites any whiter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032361351">Well, as the kidlets say, I&#39;m grinning and LAYNWY &lt;g&gt;  Welcome back, a<br/>
certain kind of silence following my posts was deafening &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nope, not a swamp.  At least the last time I was in Safford, AZ it wasn&#39;t<br/>
any different than being in NM.<br/>
<br/>
Now, since NM is getting cooler and wetter (humidity has increased in some<br/>
areas by 20% over the last century), I&#39;m guessing that maybe that dry, arid,<br/>
desolate, dusty and dirty part of the U.S. may be growing just as many<br/>
micro-bugs as any swamp.  Particularly when NM already has lots of lovely<br/>
&quot;bugs&quot; growing there since rodent born diseases are quite prevalent.  Ya<br/>
know, charming things like hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.  And your Lung<br/>
Association warns about Valley Fever and some nasty asthma problems<br/>
associated with NM&#39;s cockroach infestation.<br/>
<br/>
Also, NM does have bosque riparian forests and wetlands which swamp loving<br/>
bugs just adore.<br/>
<br/>
And, generally speaking (we&#39;ll leave out Antarctica and the North Pole) the<br/>
math remains the same for most geographic locations, 1 (dryer) + 1 (wet<br/>
clothes) = 2 (humidity) with the extension of said math being 1 (dryer) + 1<br/>
(lack of regular lint removal) + 1 (humidity) = 3 (pockets of damp lint that<br/>
some bacteria and allergins just happen to love).<br/>
<br/>
So, your *opinion* that &quot;nothing&quot; is growing on or in a dryer residing in NM<br/>
is hardly based in fact.  Facts are, dust mites and many other &quot;bugs&quot; are<br/>
alive and well in NM.<br/>

&gt; Does your friend live in a swamp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because in New Mexico there is *nothing* living in or on a dryer.<br/>
Vaccuming<br/>
&gt; will keep dust/lint down, but then again just about nothing will save us<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; dust here.<br/>

&gt; conditions or geographical region is important.<br/>
