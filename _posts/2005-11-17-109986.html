 </span></blockquote>Now if I were visiting your house and you told me to go and buy some of that, <br/>
I would have just stared at you very blankly.    If you wrote it down, I <br/>
would get it.<br/>
<br/>
Years back (1975? I went to the nearest edge of Arkansas for a few hours.   <br/>
(Okay, one overnight, to retreive some kids who had been visiting <br/>
grandparents.)    When we got there, we were told that all the kids had gone down to [some <br/>
unitelligible place, probably the name of a store or the neighbors) for...<br/>
rose nairs?<br/>
Row Snares?<br/>
<br/>
I had no idea.   <br/>
&quot;Gone down to blah-de-blah for roes ne&#39;ers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They came back a paper grocery bag full of corn on the cob, in the husks.   <br/>
Fresh ears of corn.<br/>
&quot;Roastin&#39; ears.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t have to go as far as England for it to be a good idea sometimes if <br/>
I think an utterance is crucial to ask, &quot;Could you write that down, please?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-For liquid measure, or liquid capacity, the basic unit is the gallon, <br/>
which is divided into 4 quarts, 8 pints, or 32 gills. The U.S. gallon, or wine <br/>
gallon, is 231 cubic inches (cu in.); the British imperial gallon is the volume <br/>
of 10 lb of pure water at 62Â°F and is equal to 277.42 cu in. The British units <br/>
of liquid capacity are thus about 20% larger than the corresponding American <br/>
units. The U.S. fluid ounce is 1/16 of a U.S. pint; the British unit of the <br/>
same name is 1/20 of an imperial pint and is thus slightly smaller than the U.S. <br/>
fluid ounce.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Uh...<br/>
Yeah.   Okay.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter in the absence of cooking.<br/>
They drink thick beer by the pint or the half-pint, and we don&#39;t.    <br/>
When in England do as the English and don&#39;t forget the loo roll.<br/>
And if you ask for corn, don&#39;t expect to get any.<br/>

A few years ago someone posted a math problem on our local homeschool list.  Something about how to figure out how to get a specific measure of liquid from a barrel if you didn&#39;t have a precise measuring cup.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was so dumb.  I can&#39;t imagine being in a situation where measurements HAVE to be precise, yet there is nothing precise to measure them with.  Most of the time &quot;about&quot; so much is good enough!<br/>
