You are right! I have that book packed away somewhere. It&#39;s hilarious!<br/>
I&#39;ll have to dig it out for dd. My gosh. The grandparents will think I<br/>
really lost it seeing dd learn from Gary Larson! They already thought I<br/>
was nuts when they were learning about archeology when watching an<br/>
episode of King of the Hill! Somebody will probably tell me that there is<br/>
educational value in the Simpson&#39;s too!!! <br/>

&gt; Speaking of comics and Far Side,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My kids love the book _There&#39;s a Hair in My Dirt_ by Gary Larson.    <br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s hilarious,  tons of stuff on biology, environmental issues,  <br/>
&gt; bugs, animals..etc..<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; All told by a father worm whose son is sick of eating dirt..this is <br/>
&gt; the son--<br/>
&gt;         &quot;I hate being a worm!&quot; he screeched, his tiny body <br/>
&gt; trembling.  &quot;We&#39;re the lowest of the low!  Bottom of the food chain! <br/>
&gt;  Bird food!  Fish bait! What kind of life is this, anyway?  We never <br/>
&gt; go swimming or camping or hiking or anything!  Shoot, we never even <br/>
&gt; go to the surface unless the rains flood us out!  All we ever do is <br/>
&gt; crawl around in the stupid ground.  Oh, and how can I forget?  We <br/>
&gt; eat dirt!  Dirt for breakfast, dirt for lunch, and dirt for dinner!  <br/>
&gt; Dirt, dirt, dirt!  And look--now there&#39;s even a hair in my dirt!  <br/>
&gt; The final insult--I can&#39;t stand it any longer!   I HATE BEING A <br/>
&gt; WORM!&quot;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Fun book!<br/>

&gt; They find knowledge in the oddest places, don&#39;t they??<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a Far Side buff myself, but never thought of it as learning <br/>
&gt; material.<br/>
&gt; Hmm, maybe I&#39;ll give dd my books and see what she comes up with <br/>

&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s a good unschooling story from my house today.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Breakfast is Tim&#39;s thinking time, I&#39;ve decided.  I eat my <br/>
&gt; breakfast <br/>
&gt; &gt; and get<br/>
&gt; &gt; on with cleaning up the living room/dining room area.  Tim sits <br/>
&gt; &gt; there an<br/>
&gt; &gt; plays with his food.  I&#39;ve quite hassling him about finishing it <br/>
&gt; up <br/>
&gt; &gt; already,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and mornings have become more relaxed.  (Food was has been my <br/>
&gt; &gt; hangup...)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, over the last of his breakfast, Tim was talking about gravity <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; considering what would happen if his &quot;personal gravity shifted&quot;.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Like if he<br/>
&gt;  was affected differently by gravity, either more or less.  It was <br/>
&gt; &gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; interesting monologue; my input was merely to laugh at the fun <br/>
&gt; ideas <br/>
&gt; &gt; he came<br/>
&gt; &gt; up with, and wonder silently when the heck he learned about <br/>
&gt; &gt; gravity.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It just occurred to me this evening after he went to bed where he <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; about gravity: Calvin and Hobbs comic books.  So from reading <br/>
&gt; &gt; cartoons, he<br/>
&gt; &gt; discovered a scientific concept, considered how it affects his <br/>
&gt; life, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; imagined how a change of it would change his life.  Not bad for a <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; comic<br/>
&gt; &gt; book!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe I oughta buy him another one.<br/>
