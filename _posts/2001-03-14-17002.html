How are you?  We will probably be at the same group.  I too am in Central <br/>
NJ, near Trenton.  Welcome to the list.<br/>

&gt;Count me almost in on the 3 boy list.  My triplets are almost three and <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;subscribed to the list so that I can benefit from thinking about what you <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;have to say as they grow.  Just finished Learning All the Time by John Holt<br/>
&gt;and am only sorry I didn&#39;t read it sooner.  Very exciting book.  Nicki just<br/>
&gt;introduced herself as having a 5 yr old and I&#39;ll be watching how it goes <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;her.  Having three the same age is a slightly different kettle of fish in <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;areas, but kids are kids everywhere.  I live in central NJ and haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt;hooked<br/>
&gt;up with our local support group yet because the boys still nap in the<br/>
&gt;afternoon and the group meets once a week at a park/skating rink during<br/>
&gt;naptime.<br/>
