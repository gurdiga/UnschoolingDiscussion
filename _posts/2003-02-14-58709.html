I&#39;m learning to be a calmer person.  It&#39;s a daily struggle.  My kids are <br/>
learning it too.  It&#39;s hard not to think everything is a result of your being <br/>
a bad parent!  And its hard not to be defensive when you are constantly <br/>
evaluating yourself.  When I can take a step back to watch a situation <br/>
unfold, I can see where their emotions come from.  Sometimes, it&#39;s not a <br/>
pretty picture.  But I&#39;m trying to look at that picture more often than not <br/>
to help us all learn how to interact with one another well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s at all making sense.  Really, I just wanted to agree with <br/>
the above statement...<br/>

&gt; Elizabeth<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well put Elizabeth, it makes very good sense. I often think of this<br/>
poem by Sally Simmons, that I read in _Learning A Loving Way of Life_ .<br/>
<br/>
Mirror<br/>
<br/>
I see my mirror down the hall<br/>
Coming toward me -- three feet tall!<br/>
She talks and sings and acts like me.<br/>
Magnified for all to see.<br/>
She comforts me when I am sad,<br/>
She yells and hits when she gets mad.<br/>
Sometimes I see my finer side --<br/>
Often it&#39;s qualities I&#39;d rather hide!<br/>
I&#39;m happiest, though, when I can see<br/>
My love reflected back to me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it helps that we live in such a child hostile culture.<br/>
Many times we are blamed for our children just acting like children<br/>
and we are not supported in respecting their needs. That doesn&#39;t<br/>
change the fact that we are responsible for our actions, loving or<br/>
otherwise, to our children. And, the real double whammy can be to bear<br/>
children and look to our elders with trust for support, and then find<br/>
that we have shortchanged our own needs and our children&#39;s needs in<br/>
our search for *Their* approval. Sometimes it is easier to blame the<br/>
messenger rather than admit to ourselves just how deeply hurt we are<br/>
by those we love and trust. <br/>
