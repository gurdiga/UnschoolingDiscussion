 &gt;Dear Betsy.....I want to read this book.  Who wrote it<br/>
 &gt;who is publisher? Do you have and address for a<br/>
 &gt;vendor? It isn&#39;t on the book club lists I have, or at<br/>
 &gt;the library. <br/>

  There&#39;s a semi-fictional version based on this girls&#39; life, too....came out <br/>
a few years ago to acclaim (and it was a great read) called *something* <br/>

Unfortunately it&#39;s out of print but there&#39;s a &quot;collectible&quot; one for $68.40<br/>
at Amazon -- though I suspect libraries must have them for free.<br/>
<br/>
(I wonder, will libraries start to see their collections disappearing so<br/>
people can sell them on ebay???  Or will libraries have to resort to<br/>
charging replacement fees for &quot;lost&quot; books rather than purchase price?)<br/>
<br/>
Actually, just out of curiosity, I typed in Mary Anning at Amazon and turned<br/>
up a bunch of books about her.  (There&#39;s also one called Dragon in the<br/>
Rocks.)<br/>
