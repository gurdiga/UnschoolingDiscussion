<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849329761">My 10 year old told me today he&#39;d like to go to middle school next <br/>
year.  He&#39;s always been unschooled.  I&#39;ve been on this list off and on <br/>
since he was one and I&#39;ve seen many discussions about this but I have to <br/>
admit I didn&#39;t pay real close attention.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always agreed with the idea that unschoolers should have the freedom <br/>
to choose school but I&#39;m having a very hard time dealing with the <br/>
reality.  I can hardly stop crying and I keep trying to hide it from the <br/>
kids but they know.  My son so clearly knows this isn&#39;t what I want that he <br/>
really seemed afraid to say it was what he wanted - that&#39;s not what I want.<br/>
<br/>
I guess there are two issues:  all the intense feeling I&#39;m having and how <br/>
to deal with them when I really have very little time away from my kids... <br/>
and how to handle things with Sam.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the more straightforward part is how to handle it with Sam.  So far <br/>
we&#39;ve asked why and he says he wants to be around kids his age more.  He <br/>
understands the limitations of school interactions but he seems to like <br/>
being in a big group and kind of observing what all the other kids are <br/>
doing.  Big unstructured groups like park day have always been hard for him <br/>
but he lives for this weekly nature program he goes to because he gets to <br/>
hang around with kids and be part of a group but if he&#39;s not really being <br/>
accepted into a small group he can still be there for a reason - <br/>
hiking.  He loves this group even though he had problems with teasing (the <br/>
adults there handled it well).  I think he thinks school will be like that <br/>
too.  Or like Malcolm in the Middle - just the social parts.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t want to go for a day and just check it out and I learned that <br/>
the school district doesn&#39;t allow child visitors, only parents.  I figure I <br/>
can visit and talk to teachers about bringing him by after school to look <br/>
at the books and all that.  (I say I can; really I&#39;m not sure I won&#39;t start <br/>
crying!)<br/>
<br/>
He knows that the things he knows and has mastered hardly intersect at all <br/>
with the reading and writing of school.  He asked me to teach him spelling <br/>
a couple of weeks ago (it turns out it was because he wanted to &quot;get up to <br/>
speed&quot; to go to school).  He says he wants to see what&#39;s expected and work <br/>
on areas he&#39;s &quot;behind&quot; on before fall.  It feels like a lot to me and I&#39;m <br/>
trying to stay positive.  I know it needs to be his thing, not mine, but I <br/>
really do cringe inside thinking of having to face teachers who will think <br/>
I&#39;m educationally negligent.  (Not feeling very strong right now.)  I&#39;m <br/>
wondering how much I should say to him.  I mean, I think he&#39;ll probably get <br/>
teased for writing slowly in big crooked capital letters, but maybe he <br/>
won&#39;t.  Do I keep quiet or try to prepare him emotionally and if so, how?<br/>
<br/>
As far as his lack of kids:  what happened is that we had a falling out <br/>
with some close friends a year ago, also had some uncertainty about moving <br/>
and have had the least social year since he was born.  I feel socially <br/>
deprived too!  Last week, after we finally decided not to move, I started <br/>
arranging a whole bunch of homeschool social things for us.  Felt like <br/>
spring was coming to me, but maybe it was too late for him.   He says he <br/>
was happy with our group before we had this falling out and homeschooling <br/>
was working for him.  He doesn&#39;t seem optimistic about new groups meeting <br/>
his needs.  He has a point that there aren&#39;t lots of kids his age and <br/>
homeschoolers around here often go to high school - few teens.  I was <br/>
hoping to use my pretty good organizing skills to try to create a pool of <br/>
homeschooled teens for my kids.  But I thought I had more time.<br/>
<br/>
He might change his mind before fall but he usually doesn&#39;t.  He did say he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to do it if he didn&#39;t have the option to quit (which of <br/>
course he would).  And I know it might not last.<br/>
<br/>
But what do I do now?  Do I not try to talk him out of it?  (I&#39;m so bad at <br/>
keeping my opinions to myself - maybe that&#39;s why he wants to go.)   What do <br/>
I do with all my sad (not necessarily rational) feelings - that I&#39;m losing <br/>
him, that he&#39;s somehow rejecting our values, that he thinks unschooling <br/>
doesn&#39;t work...I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m a wreck.<br/>

<br/>
Hi, PamT --<br/>
<br/>
Your ten year old who probably wouldn&#39;t come to my eleven year old&#39;s birthday party because he wouldn&#39;t know all of the kids?  (Not to be way too sarcastic, but how&#39;s that going to work????  The kids are nicer and the food is (marginally) better at my parties than in an institution.) (It&#39;s hard for me to imagine any tender-heaerted kid liking middle school.  I just don&#39;t have a good feeling about this.)<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;ve always agreed with the idea that unschoolers should have the freedom <br/>
to choose school but I&#39;m having a very hard time dealing with the <br/>
reality. **<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, me too.  I believe in the theory, but would hate to let my dear child go to school.<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
Big unstructured groups like park day have always been hard for him <br/>
but he lives for this weekly nature program he goes to because he gets to <br/>
hang around with kids and be part of a group but if he&#39;s not really being <br/>
accepted into a small group he can still be there for a reason ...**<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to this.  I was out hanging with the ladies of the quilt guild tonight.  We have two kind of meetings.  In the beginning, the business meetings that were very structured were much easier for me (as a newcomer) to attend than anything that involved socializing and standing around.<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
But what do I do now?  Do I not try to talk him out of it?  **<br/>
<br/>
I think the textbook &lt;g&gt; answer is to look for the unmet need.  Sometimes a 5 year old just wants a lunch box or a chance to ride the bus.  Sam, at his age and from what you said, may want two things, reassurance that he is really learning and peer interaction with structure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just guessing.<br/>
<br/>
Take the advice that fits and let the rest roll off.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  If he&#39;s set on trying school, could he try summer school?  Then he&#39;d be in and out sooner than if you waited until September.  Hey, there are summer programs at UC Berkeley in science/math that I just saw an email about that go down to a pretty young age.  Not the age 15 cutoff that I saw for one program there, but much younger.  (But homework was mentioned -- yuck.)  Hmmmm.  Hey, he might even like summer day camp stuff, if you could pick a good one.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523127950">The summer-classes thing sounds doable, especially if you&#39;re in a college  <br/>
town where there&#39;s cool stuff, rather than remedial make-up stuff for kids who  <br/>
failed.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Holly&#39;s thinking of going to 8th grade, and that&#39;s pretty creepy BUT... her  <br/>
handwriting is passable, and when she was ten it really wasn&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
When she was ten, she wasn&#39;t reading.<br/>
When she was ten, she wouldn&#39;t have done well in school at all.<br/>
 <br/>
But at 13/14 I think she could do okay.<br/>
 <br/>
She might change her mind, and if she does go, she might not last  long.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t even plan to last long, but I would prepare myself for  the <br/>
possibility that it might surprise her and she might like it.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I understand the fears.  It seems unschoolers are &quot;ahead&quot; when they&#39;re  <br/>
little, and then seem lagging in the 10-12 range, and then zoom on &quot;ahead&quot;  again, <br/>
when the kids at school are hitting puberty and sick of the whole  deal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-891758512">Hi Pam<br/>
<br/>
My 10 DD year begged to go to school.  She was upset cos she thought I was upset ( she was right but I howled silent tears in our walk in pantry for ages) then set about finding a school for her.  After a few weeks looking -( schools here are rubbish and tbh not much to choose from) I found one. The secretary screeched down the phone when she found out that dd had not been to school for over 4 years and accused me of negligence. At the same time I had other home educators saying stuff like &quot;You wouldn&#39;t let her take drugs - school is bad for her e.t.c Don&#39; t let her go.  I still felt I had to give her the choice otherwise all my ideas about unschooling were a sham.<br/>
<br/>
She started hedging. I don&#39; t really want to go e.t.c  Then saying she did. I cancelled visits around schools and rebooked them on her whim.  It got silly.  In the end I discovered she wanted some schooled friends and saw this as the only way to get them. She didn&#39;t fit in with the home educated crowd we knew. One art class and one drama class a week cured the problem. She hasn&#39;t asked about school since.  (to my upmost relief).  <br/>

<br/>
Screeching secretaries aside, (shudder), I would assume that most private schools would be more likely to be willing to arrange a visiting day than public schools.  (They need to be nicer to customers than public schools do.)  Whether or not you can afford private school, you can investigate them and consider it a &quot;field trip&quot;.  (I wouldn&#39;t urge you to present yourself dishonestly to the school, but I don&#39;t think it costs them much effort to let you and your child look around.)<br/>
<br/>
In addition to summer camps, there are often even weeklong camps for kids for Spring Breaks, so that parents can still go to work everyday.  Some of them might have some thoughtful content, maybe.  This is something participatory that Sam could try out very soon.  (Although it will cost as much as other forms of daycare, possibly.)<br/>

***<br/>
<br/>
Betsy, thanks.  (And I never even asked him about the birthday party, just <br/>
assumed.  Ooops...)  The sarcasm was appreciated and it points something <br/>
out to me.  That I am completely floored by this change in him.  He&#39;s <br/>
always been reluctant to go into anonymous big groups.  He said himself <br/>
that a few months ago he didn&#39;t want to ever even go to high school and now <br/>
he wants this.  I need to explore why such a big change.  I have schooling <br/>
friends who say it&#39;s a natural part of separation.  I&#39;m not so sure.<br/>
<br/>
**I think the textbook &lt;g&gt; answer is to look for the unmet need.  Sometimes <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I need to explore what he&#39;s hoping to get out of the peer interaction <br/>
with structure.  Close relationships?  Some laughs at the goofy things they <br/>
do to make each other laugh?  In some ways, I suspect, he&#39;d like to be <br/>
constantly entertained by other kids being funny.  (I wasn&#39;t kidding that <br/>
he expects it to be like Malcolm in the Middle.) And I think he&#39;s wanting <br/>
to feel just like everyone else.  What do I do with that?  That feels icky <br/>
to me.  Sooo against what I value (and yet, what I still struggle with...)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if summer camps would do it.  He seems interested in school, that <br/>
great big other out there.  But he wants to go in the fall when all the 6th <br/>
graders are new and he thinks he won&#39;t stand out as much.<br/>
<br/>
OK, Sandra, re-reading your school choice article was helpful.  But it <br/>
sounds like your sister made it abundantly clear that she&#39;d prefer the kids <br/>
be home.  I&#39;m wondering how much to say about that.  I know denigrating his <br/>
desires leads to a loss of relationship.  But I can&#39;t stop thinking of all <br/>
these thing I want to tell him about why I think unschooling is so much <br/>
better.  I&#39;ve thought about reading him John Taylor Gatto or James Herndon <br/>
or something that expresses my view that school is a waste of life.  (He&#39;d <br/>
probably enjoy it.  He likes to hears things like Fast Food Nation and <br/>
Botany of Desire. )<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
When she was ten, she wasn&#39;t reading.<br/>
When she was ten, she wouldn&#39;t have done well in school at all.***<br/>
<br/>
Hard to envision Sam doing well right now.  (And if he does, I have this <br/>
morbid fear that he&#39;ll credit school with teaching him and think <br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t &quot;work.&quot;)  I worry about how that will affect him, to be <br/>
so obviously at a different level.  Will he think he can&#39;t do those <br/>
things?    What would you have said to Holly about it if she&#39;d wanted to go <br/>
then?  Anything?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ruth, thank you for sharing your story.  That is encouraging and I hope my <br/>
attempts at helping him beef up his social life work without school.  He <br/>
said something similar about not feeling like he fits in with <br/>
homeschoolers.  Around here they tend to be high achievers, artists, <br/>
performers, musicians...and quite parentally directed, not what he is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I think I need help with, folks.  I want to share information <br/>
and my opinions and have him hear my concerns but I don&#39;t want to cross the <br/>
line and make him feel so pressured that it harms our relationship.  How do <br/>
I find that line?  (I don&#39;t think the &quot;What would I say to my husband?&quot; <br/>
route will work.  We just went through this about moving and I had a hard <br/>
time dropping the subject when I should have!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading Teen Parent Breakthrough (thanks, Pam S.) which I&#39;ve had for a <br/>
while, but I think I really need it now.  (But still can&#39;t believe these <br/>
issues are coming up at age 10!)<br/>

 <br/>
If you tell him WHY you&#39;re afraid and what you&#39;re afraid of, he might still  <br/>
want to go, but at least he&#39;ll know.<br/>
 <br/>
If you leave it neutrally open without expressing your concerns, those very  <br/>
things might happen to him and your later &quot;I knew that would happen&quot; might be  <br/>
more cruel than an advance &quot;I&#39;m worried that this could happen.&quot;<br/>

That the other kids might be mean about her handwriting not being good, or  <br/>
that the teachers might make her feel bad about being a homeschooler.   That&#39;s <br/>
standing prediction, even though now she&#39;s 13.  They WILL be mean,  not might. <br/>
 But I didn&#39;t word it that strongly, because my kids have a kind  of charm <br/>
about them that deflects some of the meanness I&#39;ve seen in others, and  my kids <br/>
are confident.  But none of them was fully-on confident at eight or  ten.<br/>

<br/>
When I wanted to have a kid, I think I imagined we would be a <br/>
wise-cracking sitcom family.  And it is kind of like that at our house, <br/>
on my best nights. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Simpsons is a funny show that shows some of the ugly side of school in a very knowing way.  If you watch, there will be lots of classroom, playground and school bus scenes that you can discuss.<br/>
<br/>
**And I think he&#39;s wanting to feel just like everyone else.  What do I do with that?**<br/>
<br/>
(My first thought was read lots of Spiderman comics that show the loner as hero, but those might be too sad.)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s shake and rattle some of our assumptions about individuality as a good thing.  I do think individuality is important, but, on the other hand, learning how to blend in and function in groups can be a very useful skill.  (Nobody yell at me until reaching the end of this paragraph. &lt;g&gt;)  I *don&#39;t* think a classroom is a good way to learn this stuff, especially not a middle school classroom.  But doing some roleplaying at home about group dynamics, and reading Miss Manners at the breakfast table, and looking for some pleasant group activities and integrating more social coaching might help.  It is useful to be able to assess new group situations and understand their dynamics and join in that new community without making a lot of waves.  (I realize this may be tangential to what you asked.)<br/>
<br/>
Stretching even more, it&#39;s possible that doing some kind of volunteer work in the community is a way to meet the need to feel good about oneself and to feel happy about being connected to other people.<br/>
<br/>
(I wish there were more activities that welcomed kids and adults simultaneously.  But maybe I&#39;m just not using enough imagination right now.  There are certainly some activities that don&#39;t exclude kids.  Bird-watching?  Pickle-making?  umm...)<br/>
<br/>
I tend to be kind of chaotic person, but maybe Sam likes structure and predictability in his Saturday class.  Is it possible to have some structure at home, or would the younger kid be a &quot;destablizing force&quot;? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would you be offended if I suggested he try Fifth Grade instead of Sixth?  I really don&#39;t know anything about his &quot;academic skills&quot; except what you said about his handwriting.  I will happily admit that my son&#39;s academic development has been ideosyncratic and &quot;uneven&quot;.  Middle School seems so much worse than Grammar School.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t read this article in a long time, but I would think it&#39;s okay to talk about how much you like to have him at home and how much you will continue to make your interactions with him fun ;  just don&#39;t go in the guilt direction about how much you will miss him.  As if you were inviting and not coercing an adult friend to do something with you.  Lots of &quot;we&#39;d love to have you&quot; and &quot;we&#39;ve got food you like and the chance to stop whenever you want to...&quot; reassurance.  But no &quot;you&#39;ll be sorry you didn&#39;t&quot;, of course.</div>

I suggested Holly might want to do 7th instead of 8th grade, if she goes to  <br/>

stories about locker rooms and about people not liking PE.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533478004">Don&#39;t hold out on him by not giving him the benefit of your knowledge <br/>
and ideas. Let him know clearly why YOU chose not to send him to school <br/>
and what your concerns are about him going. Be honest. BUT - you can do <br/>
that while still honoring HIS opinions - you don&#39;t have to (I know you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t) make him feel like an idiot for wanting to try it out. It is <br/>
SO understandable that a kid who has never gone to school might think <br/>
that is THE answer if he&#39;s feeling out of sorts - socially, especially. <br/>
You can offer your information and ideas and listen carefully to his <br/>
AND you can even say, &quot;Well, it is part of my own philosophy to support <br/>
you when you have strong interests like this so that IS what I&#39;m going <br/>
to do.&quot; You don&#39;t want to lie to him by pretending that you think it is <br/>
a great idea - but you DO want to be honest with him that you&#39;re going <br/>
to help and support him in his choice even though it wouldn&#39;t be your <br/>
choice. AND - you can be honest with him that you&#39;re really pleased <br/>
that he&#39;s thinking for himself and trying to find FOR HIMSELF what <br/>
works. Also be REALLY sure that he understands that YOU understand that <br/>
he&#39;s making this decision without full knowledge of how it will work <br/>
out - create an attitude between you that he&#39;s experimenting - because <br/>
you definitely don&#39;t want to do anything that will make him feel stuck, <br/>
like he&#39;s failed or screwed up in some way if, after a day or a week or <br/>
a month, he wants to stop going.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just tossing this out there, because I don&#39;t know for sure, <br/>
obviously, but the friends you had a falling out with included kids <br/>
he&#39;d spent a lot of time with and to him this is almost like a death - <br/>
somebody he was very close to who is no longer available to him. I <br/>
think you said it has been around a year - maybe he&#39;s just coming to <br/>
terms with the fact that this is permanent - a bit like coming to terms <br/>
with death. So he&#39;s sort of deep inside decided it is time to do <br/>
something about developing a new social life, and school looks, from <br/>
the outside, like the prime place to do that.  Makes sense and is a <br/>
good and healthy and smart move on his part, if that is what is <br/>
motivating it. HE doesn&#39;t know what the social life of middle school is <br/>
really like - the miserable parts of it are made fun of on Malcolm in <br/>
the Middle, as if it is all a joke. So - if you respect that he <br/>
absolutely does have valid reasons for  wanting to go, and accept them <br/>
JUST like you&#39;ve accepted his interests in everything else for the past <br/>
10 years, treat it the same way as if he&#39;d said he wants to go to any <br/>
other activity - help him weigh the pros and cons, respect HIS <br/>
opinions, support his decisions, make sure he FEELS that his option to <br/>
change his mind is wide open, I think you&#39;re going to do fine with <br/>
this, Pam.<br/>
<br/>
You have to stop feeling it as a personal failure and see it as just <br/>
another interest of his - since it is problematic in so many ways, <br/>
you&#39;d want to explore what he wants out of it, what the problems are <br/>
that you (and he) see with it, etc. JUST as if he decided to take up <br/>
scuba diving or sky diving or something else that seems dangerous and <br/>
scary to you.<br/>

That&#39;s how we&#39;re talking with Holly about it. She&#39;d be going to school as  an <br/>
animal behavioralist would camp out with the coyotes or go to Africa to watch <br/>
 chimpanzees like Jane Goodall, only she&#39;d be disguised as one of the  <br/>
animals.<br/>
 <br/>
If she goes<br/>
and if she likes it<br/>
and if she stays<br/>
pretty soon I won&#39;t be an unschooling mom anymore!  Marty&#39;s already  sixteen <br/>
and a half.<br/>
 <br/>
But if she goes and just does it clinically and doesn&#39;t get invested and  <br/>
comes home, then we&#39;ll see whether she feels like she went to school to learn  <br/>
the material school presents in the classroom or whether she went to school like <br/>
 an anthropologist to study the behavior of teachers and students in  school.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you could try that idea out and see how he feels about it.<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I would tell the principal straight out that you&#39;d rather keep him at  <br/>
home and you don&#39;t trust the school not to do damage to his psyche and self  <br/>
esteem, and that if they can keep it to a minimum you&#39;d appreciate it.  I&#39;d  <br/>
tell them you&#39;ll be happy to bring him home in a heartbeat if he&#39;s unhappy, and  <br/>
that you&#39;re sure he&#39;ll really enjoy homeschooling even more when he comes  <br/>
home.<br/>

I was okay with PE - at least we could talk to each other. I was <br/>
reasonably athletic, so there weren&#39;t a LOT of traumas there for me - <br/>
just a few that stand out over the years. Oh - and the 7th and 8th <br/>
grade PE teacher (Miss Allard) who made us hold our towels over our <br/>
heads and turn around as we came out of the showers so she could look <br/>
at our whole naked bodies and &quot;make sure you washed.&quot; HUH?<br/>
<br/>
There was some kind of scandal and she was fired a couple of years <br/>
later when my sister was one of her students.<br/>
<br/>
In 9th grade I had Mrs. Wiley who was short and very fat - got out of <br/>
breath walking out to the PE fields. What kind of PE teacher is that? <br/>
GREAT one - we just played all the time - she graded us on showing up <br/>
and participating, not on skills.<br/>

Oh... forgot to say why I thought that was.  <br/>
Sex ed.  They backed it up, I think, rather than wait until the kids  are <br/>
already likely to be through puberty and sexually active (we were 14-16) and  try <br/>
to talk to the kids when they&#39;re 12/13 instead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - the whole POINT of my wording was the opposite. Everybody will <br/>
put things in their own words, but what I meant was to recommend that <br/>
the person tell the administrators that their priority is their child <br/>
being happy and having a good experience and that THAT is what the <br/>
parents would support. As opposed to supporting what the school <br/>
administrators might think ought to be their priority - like getting <br/>
good grades, perfect attendance, doing all their homework, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would tell the administrators that my priority was going to be to <br/>
support my child&#39;s happiness and that I wanted her experience at school <br/>
to be good.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking it was just a little bit of a reminder, maybe even could <br/>
be considered a threat, to the administrators that I wasn&#39;t going to be <br/>
supportive of anything that wasn&#39;t making her happy and making the <br/>
experience a good one for her.<br/>
<br/>
Hard to know in advance what is likely to come up, though.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose always-radically-unschooled daughter went to 8th <br/>
grade. The first day, the parent was called to bring her a change of <br/>
clothes - seems the school had a policy that nobody could dress all in <br/>
black. Mom was tempted to dress all in black when SHE showed up, but <br/>
daughter begged her to hide her indignation and just bring her some <br/>
other clothes. A few days later she was in the principal&#39;s office <br/>
again, they&#39;d decided her daughter&#39;s dyed hair was distracting and <br/>
wanted her to go home and recolor it to a normal color. Again, the <br/>
daughter WANTED to go along, even though mom was willing to fight for <br/>
her right to have her hair any color. For the first few weeks of <br/>
school, this poor girl accidentally broke several rules (another was <br/>
wearing a shirt with a banned logo on it) and the mom wore down a <br/>
pathway from their house to the principal&#39;s office. The mom did what <br/>
the girl wanted, though, just kept going along with things - the girl <br/>
really wanted to be there and wanted to manage to get the rules figured <br/>
out. The mom didn&#39;t make her daughter do homework or anything - just <br/>
kept her mouth shut &lt;G&gt; as per her daughter&#39;s wishes, which was hard <br/>
enough for her.<br/>
<br/>
Another mom I know whose always homeschooled girls went to school had <br/>
to insist that the school take care of the ants that had invaded her <br/>
daughter&#39;s locker. Poor kid wasn&#39;t eating her lunch - because she had <br/>
to leave it in her locker and it was attacked by ants every day.<br/>

<br/>
Makes sense.  Finding the way to do it is tricky.  I feel like since I&#39;ve <br/>
let him make just about all of his decisions his whole life, he has very <br/>
sensitive antennae as to whether I approve or not.  What other kids might <br/>
perceive as conversation, he perceives as criticism.  Have other <br/>
unschoolers experienced this?<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
Would you be offended if I suggested he try Fifth Grade instead of <br/>
Sixth?  I really don&#39;t know anything about his &quot;academic skills&quot; except <br/>
what you said about his handwriting.  I will happily admit that my son&#39;s <br/>
academic development has been ideosyncratic and &quot;uneven&quot;.  Middle School <br/>
seems so much worse than Grammar School.***<br/>
<br/>
It does, shudder... but that&#39;s where he wants to go.  I feel like I need to <br/>
get a whole lot more understanding of what he thinks he&#39;ll be getting out <br/>
of this. So far, in my (I hope) gentle probing, I&#39;ve gotten &quot;yeah, sort of&quot; <br/>
answers to questions about needing a larger group of friends and some <br/>
independence, wanting to be like everyone else and wanting to be around <br/>
kids more.  I got a &quot;not really that&quot; to questions about whether he <br/>
wondered if he could handle the work.<br/>
<br/>
   And I got a solid yes - I&#39;m both devestated by this and glad of it <br/>
because it&#39;s one I can do something about- when I asked if he was feeling <br/>
alone and not accepted in our family.  Wow.   But this kid springs back.  A <br/>
couple of days of me really working on my relationship with him, getting to <br/>
know him again it feels like and we both feel way more connected.  And <br/>
that&#39;s great (although the six year old suffers!  I can never find the <br/>
right balance.)  But he still says he wants to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
We have many more things to talk about.<br/>
<br/>
***Let him know clearly why YOU chose not to send him to school<br/>
and what your concerns are about him going. Be honest. BUT - you can do<br/>
that while still honoring HIS opinions - you don&#39;t have to (I know you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t) make him feel like an idiot for wanting to try it out. It is<br/>
SO understandable that a kid who has never gone to school might think<br/>
that is THE answer if he&#39;s feeling out of sorts - socially, especially.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Pam,  you are so very wise and positive.    I think my struggle as an <br/>
unschooling mom is ALWAYS about staying positive.  And I think that&#39;s a <br/>
good insight on how the falling out with friends played into this.  I also <br/>
like your approach about making the school people a little afraid.  Should <br/>
be easy enough as I was once a sixth grade teacher.  Except it won&#39;t <br/>
be!  One thing I&#39;m terrified of is them making him feel bad about his <br/>
academic skills, wanting to test him for special ed and all that.  Has <br/>
anybody here had a kid go to school who was way not at grade level?  The <br/>
thought of them labeling him...ugh<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone, for your help.<br/>

In the UK you have to go into grades or years as they are here at the age you are so no matter what grade level you are in you are in with everyone your age. My dd was tested - aged 6 -and found to be 2 years below her grade level.  Her teacher called me in and looked pityingly at me when I suggested as she is just 6 didn&#39;t she think it was all a lot about nothing and told me in front of my dd she would never achieve anything as she &quot;lacked necessary skills and did not retain them when taught.&quot;  I cried and raged alternatively  all the way home and we pulled her out.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I feel like since I&#39;ve <br/>
let him make just about all of his decisions his whole life, he has very <br/>
sensitive antennae as to whether I approve or not.  What other kids might <br/>
perceive as conversation, he perceives as criticism.  Have other <br/>
unschoolers experienced this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But if when he&#39;s made his decisions you were offering input (not just sneaky <br/>
visceral input, but verbal) then wouldn&#39;t he expect and WANT input on this <br/>
important decision too?<br/>
<br/>
My kids expect me to remind them of things they might be forgetting, or <br/>
factors of which they might&#39;ve been unaware.<br/>

In the UK you have to go into grades or years as they are here at the age you <br/>
are so no matter what grade level you are in you are in with everyone your <br/>
age.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here they generally (not universally, but commonly) have a three year or so <br/>
window.  If you&#39;re a year and a half younger or older, that&#39;s okay UNLESS/until <br/>
puberty is an issue.  Someone in early or later puberty would be more likely <br/>
to have that be taken into consideration.  They don&#39;t want a small kid bullied <br/>
and so wouldn&#39;t be as likely to place him &quot;high&quot; nor do they want an already <br/>
mature kid with babyish kids (fear of sexual abuse).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not talked about outside counsellors&#39; offices and teachers&#39; lounges.  <br/>
It has to do with fear of legal liability.<br/>
