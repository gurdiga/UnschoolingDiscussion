&lt;&lt; One of my <br/>
 friends who also homeschools got rid of a lot of her daughter&#39;s toys as she <br/>
 didn&#39;t seem to play with certain things and noticed that she didn&#39;t miss <br/>
 them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
                    From time to time-- maybe once or twice a year--my kids <br/>
help me gather up toys and clothes to give to the needy.  It helps them begin <br/>
to think of others less fortunate, as well as clearing out the surplus of <br/>
stuff accumulated.With the things I know we are keeping, I have put up lots <br/>
of floor-ceiling bookshelves.  Then I fill up baskets and contact paper <br/>
covered boxes with the &quot;stuff&quot;.  Also, I ran across an idea in a magazine <br/>
where they made 2 pc fabric covered ottomans for the living room that could <br/>
be filled with toys, papers and magazines.  They look like large hat boxes!)  <br/>
Something I have started doing this year , is in the kid&#39;s rooms, we are <br/>
putting up shelves  about a foot below where the ceiling and wall meets (up <br/>
high on the walls) with decorative brackets, and we are storing old toys, <br/>
stuffed animals, trophies, etc .  It makes a good place to put things that <br/>
are rarely played with, yet wanted to  be kept.  Hope some of this  helps, <br/>
Stella.  I understand how you feel; it drives me nuts to feel like everything <br/>
is overly cluttered-- then I get grouchy about it!  :)  BTW, welcome !!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380845667">I like the idea of giving to the needy.<br/>
i will try that with my girls. They may like the idea of helping<br/>
others out. At the moment we take things to a charity shop but I<br/>
don&#39;t think the children can relate to who is getting the benefit<br/>
with that as the items get sold to someone who wants to buy them<br/>
then the money goes to the needy.<br/>
We could maybe take something to the hospital - i know that they<br/>
need toys on the wards or in the clinics. When we visited the eye<br/>
clinic last week they were short on toys for children waiting<br/>
around.<br/>
I am working on providing suitable storage now for the things we<br/>
want to keep.<br/>
Thankyou Karen<br/>
