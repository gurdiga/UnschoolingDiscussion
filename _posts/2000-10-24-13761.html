<div id="ygrps-yiv-233378687">All my children went to ps - I removed my youngest from ps 6 months <br/>
ago, she is now 12yrs old<br/>
My eldest could read before he went to school.  He loves reading even <br/>
now<br/>
My 2nd could not read until he was about 7-8yrs old always hated <br/>
reading and still does. He never reads anything unless it is some <br/>
thing he needs to know<br/>
My 3rd was another late starter, 8-9yr - reads occasionally<br/>
My 4th could read at about 6-7yrs and still enjoys reading<br/>
My youngest was about 6-7yrs too - she very rarely reads.<br/>
I always read to all my children every bed time untill they didnt <br/>
want me to read.<br/>
Every child is different.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy to forget that, regardless of the propaganda put out by schools,<br/>
many, many &quot;normal&quot; children are not reading independently at the end of<br/>
grade 1.  Many aren&#39;t by the end of grade 2.  Many don&#39;t read for<br/>
enjoyment much before grade 4 or so, if they haven&#39;t been damaged by the<br/>
system and turned off from reading altogether.  My 7.5 yr old participates<br/>
in an America Reads program at our public library and tonight I took a<br/>
peek at his file.  *I* think he&#39;s still struggling to read and he rarely<br/>
reads for enjoyment or pleasure as opposed to achieve a specific goal<br/>
(like the directions to a Pokemon game).  He still makes lots of mistakes<br/>
and is clueless a lot of the time if the context isn&#39;t really clear.  <br/>
Yet, the tutors he has worked with have continually said that he is<br/>
significanlty &quot;abve grade level&quot; and has &quot;superior skills&quot; for his<br/>
age/grade.  So, OK, those comments give me some assurance, but they also<br/>
tell me that most 2nd graders don&#39;t read well, regardless of what people<br/>
say.  And, if allowed to grow on their own, these same kids *will* (most<br/>
likely) be independent readers one day.....<br/>
