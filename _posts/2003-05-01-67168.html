<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734461990">Hello Everybody!<br/>
My daughters and I were going through my old stamp collection I <br/>
happened to come across at my mothers. I was telling them about my <br/>
penpals from Japan and China I once had as a child. It got us to <br/>
thinking...would anyone like to be an &quot;old fashioned penpal?&quot; aka <br/>
snail mail. <br/>
My daughters are 10 and 7. Too many interest to really list. The <br/>
basics...LOVE art, reading & writing, anything outdoors, computers <br/>
and did I mention ART?! That&#39;s very big in our house.<br/>
If anyone is interested please contact us at our email address and we <br/>
can exchange addresses. Be sure to place *PenPals* in the subject <br/>
line to avoid being deleted by mistake.<br/>
**Mom&#39;s & Dad&#39;s....this is open to you as well if you would like to <br/>
write also. I love to write letters just as much as I like to receive <br/>
them. It&#39;s nice to find a friendly letter amoungst all the bills! <br/>
*grin*. I enjoy meeting new people and learning from their lives. <br/>
Excited to meet people from all over the world. I love playing games <br/>
with our children. Working with Stained Glass, Clay, Copper and all <br/>
other art forms. I love photography and scrapbooking. I would love to <br/>
learn about stamping. Love reading, writing and anything involving <br/>
nature for the most part. I love traveling, just can&#39;t afford to do <br/>
it as often as I would like. I enjoy working with our children as we <br/>
find and sell items on ebay. It has been such fun. check us <br/>
out...ebay seller name: online_annie <br/>
I hope to hear from you! You can write just about anything*, day to <br/>
day thoughts or experiences, life in general. (*except religion. <br/>
Sorry, not a religious person.)<br/>

I am new to this list, my two oldest girls are 7 and 6, they are still in <br/>
public school, only for the fact that my  dh wants them to finish out the <br/>
year.  Only four weeks left. Needless to say, they will not be returning in <br/>
the fall.  My youngest daughter is 3 1/2 and her brother is 1 1/2.  I know my <br/>
7 year old just LOVES to write letters... to anyone she can... so please let <br/>
me know your address or email me off list and I can send you ours. My girls <br/>
would love to have someone to write to besides their grandparents! Thanks!<br/>
