&lt;&lt; Our libraries here are a source for videos, <br/>
music cd&#39;s and tapes, cd-rom programs &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have to go downtown for those things--the branch libraries (there are <br/>
about ten of them, and that&#39;s cool--we have one 1/4 mile away).   My <br/>
complaint is with people&#39;s obsessions with &quot;book learning,&quot; and that the text <br/>
added &quot;libraries&quot; (I think) for that reason.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the original text:<br/>
CERTIFICATE OF EMPOWERMENT<br/>
<br/>
As bearer of this certificate you are no longer required to depend on the <br/>
advice of experts. You may step back and view the entire world-not just your <br/>
home, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth-as a learning experience, a <br/>
laboratory containing languages (and native speakers thereof), plants, <br/>
animals, history, geology, weather (real live weather, in the sky, not in a <br/>
book), music, art , mathematics, physics, engineering, foods, human dynamics, <br/>
and ideas without end. Although collections of these treasures have been <br/>
located in museums for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere <br/>
else, too. <br/>
<br/>
This authorizes you to experiment; to trust and enjoy your kids; to rejoice <br/>
when your children surpass you in skill, knowledge or wisdom; to make <br/>
mistakes, and to say &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Furthermore, you may allow your children <br/>
to experience boredom without taking full responsibility for finding them <br/>
something to do. <br/>
<br/>
Henceforth you shall neither be required nor expected to finish everything <br/>
you start. Projects, books, experiments and plans may be diked up again at <br/>
any time in the future (or never). <br/>
<br/>
You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, and take what steps you <br/>
feel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>
harm. <br/>
<br/>
You have leave to think your own thoughts, and to encourage your children to <br/>
think theirs. <br/>
<br/>
Each person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these <br/>
privileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by <br/>
creating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to <br/>
obtain approval to experiment, to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen <br/>
others do are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the first place. <br/>

It was originally a single-use thing, designed for distribution in a certain <br/>
workshop.  But it was fun and well received, so I&#39;ve always given them away <br/>
when I do workshops.  And sure enough, there&#39;s permission to change it.  But <br/>
that one single change seemed to me to show a lack of faith in real-world <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
They put &quot; Although collections of these treasures have been located in <br/>
libraries and museums for your convenience, they are to be found everywhere <br/>
else, too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LIBRARIES FIRST, even before museums.<br/>
But still said it was written by me. <br/>
<br/>
So for me, it&#39;s a (minor) problem because people who learn to use the whole <br/>
world will certainly consider libraries to be a part of that, but those who <br/>
stay library-dependent might not venture far beyond.  School seems to <br/>
consider the public library PLENTY of &quot;enrichment&quot; and resource.<br/>

that most people would associate with academics, since the other two <br/>
examples were of things that most people wouldn&#39;t associate with <br/>
academics.  I was looking for a balance.  I&#39;d be just as happy with museums <br/>
or Shakespeare or . . . .<br/>
<br/>
I certainly understand the problem with obsessing about book learning, <br/>
though it took my son to teach it to me.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
