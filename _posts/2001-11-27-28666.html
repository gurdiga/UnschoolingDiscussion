<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

It is *possible* that Sandra didn&#39;t like the lack of control she had on this list. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s not used to people calling her on stuff she says when so many other people treat her as an idol.  Right or wrong (and I&#39;m not getting into *that* discussion with anyone), she chose to  leave and start her own list with her own guidelines.  Nobody&#39;s being a bully... nobody&#39;s calling her ugly names here... in fact, the only posts I recall are ones begging her not to leave. The people who either didn&#39;t have an opinion on that or were glad have remained quiet about it. <br/>
There was no &quot;win&quot; or &quot;loss&quot;; only an evolution to another phase that this list will endure. <br/>
Sarah (coming out of lurkdom now that the person who was always snarky to her has left)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223048315">Right. I didn&#39;t phrase that as I should have. I&#39;ll try again.<br/>
I think Sandra has a lot of information that she has shared on this list. I also agree that she&#39;s been called to task on more than one occasion for what she has written. In the meantime, though, she&#39;s developed a following, if you will, of supporters. I&#39;m guessing but I&#39;m pretty sure she feels more comfortable being around those supporting her than around those who call her to task. (why else would she decide to leave?) <br/>
imo, if the &#39;debate&#39; between Sandra and &#39;the other two&#39; had remained with just them rather than the cheerleaders coming out and taking sides, this might have blown over. But, people felt inclined to take a position and post it to the list *rather* than adding a different perspective to the already heated debate. Rather than taking the debated topic to a different level, fuel was just added to the fire and we witnessed a cyber catfight . <br/>
I&#39;ve been &#39;around&#39; these boards since the old HEM days... about 9 years or so????... not that I think that matters but since you were pointing out how long you&#39;ve been reading Sandra&#39;s posts, I thought I should do the same. Back in the old days, every single time I posted something, she was lying in wait to ambush my posts. It didn&#39;t take long for me to go into silent mode and just watch the fur fly with someone else. She&#39;s been bickering for quite a long time. That&#39;s not to say she&#39;s not had some very informative advice or information... just that the tone has always been this way with Sandra. <br/>

her leaving affected many of us, in many different ways. I think <br/>
discussing what happened, the decision she made and the effect it has <br/>

  But why did the discussion have to become polarized into sides?<br/>
  reply: I don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t engage in that... I just lurked.<br/>
<br/>
  We are all homeschoolers, most of us are unschoolers.  Why did this<br/>
  list even have Sandra and anti-Sandra sides?  I didn&#39;t agree with<br/>
  her all the time but I don&#39;t expect to agree with anyone all the time.<br/>
  And I&#39;m sure there are some people with whom I&#39;d never agree!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  reply: me, too. I really don&#39;t have any answers... just speculation but perhaps it happened because over such a long period of time, whether by her own choosing or not, Sandra became a sort of &#39;standard&#39; and anyone new to the list who didn&#39;t want to make waves would refrain from posting any contradictory posts ....except for a few people who dared to do so. In an offlist conversation, someone said it (the fighting) turned so school-girlish and I&#39;d agree with that assessment. <br/>
  It seems to me that for those who post and I never agree with, I&#39;d just refrain from responding to those posts unless we&#39;re talking about factual information and not just opinions.  If it&#39;s about facts, I think one **should* post counter-information if they have it. Let the readers decide what to believe. Then, if opinions start to flow back and forth, well, recognize them as such and move on!<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Hopefully, that&#39;s over and Sandra can enjoy her newly formed group! <br/>
  &gt; Didn&#39;t you say you joined? <br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  No, I didn&#39;t say whether or not I joined.  I just said I wasn&#39;t sure about<br/>
  staying here. <br/>
<br/>
  I think this is an informative list and a needed resource for many folks new and old to homeschooling. I can come here and refuel my jets when I&#39;m feeling weary from the daily doldrums. I can refer newbies I meet at my dd&#39;s dance classes here for information or different perspectives that I personally don&#39;t hold. It&#39;s a list that fills a need. I&#39;m sure Sandra&#39;s will as well. <br/>

great regularity, since before I was around, and that&#39;s been 7 1/2 years.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Nobody&#39;s being a bully... nobody&#39;s<br/>
&gt; calling her ugly names here... in fact, the only posts I recall are ones<br/>
&gt; begging her not to leave.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The bullying has been over the past year (at least, that I&#39;ve been reading<br/>
this list), not since she&#39;s left. It&#39;s pretty silly to try to bully someone<br/>
who isn&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
You can sit around and say there is no bullying, I can sit around and say<br/>
there is. Some will agree with you and some with me, and there&#39;s really no<br/>
point to saying, &quot;no there isn&#39;t&quot; &quot;yes there is&quot; all day.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see it that way at all.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was misunderstanding and differences in communication. Sandra<br/>
felt she was attacking ideas and being personally attacked in return. That<br/>
others didn&#39;t see it that way I think was at the heart of it. (No we don&#39;t<br/>
need a parade of quotes to prove one side or the other ;-) I&#39;m talking about<br/>
perception.)<br/>
<br/>
Quite frankly I have a hard time understanding Sandra on occasion. As a<br/>
typical example, a year or so ago there was a TCS (Taking Children<br/>
Seriously) brouhaha. It looked like Sandra was beating TCS people up over<br/>
the TCS use of the phrase &quot;damaged by coercion&quot;. I asked questions and beat<br/>
my head against the screen in frustration for a couple of weeks trying to<br/>
figure out what she was objecting to. It wasn&#39;t until the TCS people used a<br/>
different word in a very specialized way that altered its standard meaning<br/>
that I finally understood. Once that lightbulb went on, *then* I could go<br/>
back and read what she was objecting to and understand. Then what she was<br/>
objecting to was crystal clear.<br/>
<br/>
I think too often there&#39;s a piece of the puzzle she has that others don&#39;t.<br/>
Sandra can&#39;t percieve the puzzle without that piece so can&#39;t conceive that<br/>
it might be missing. Others feel their puzzle is complete so don&#39;t even look<br/>
for a missing piece. So it just gets frustrating as though two sides were<br/>
certain they were using the same language but really aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s posting style too. Some people find it attacking. Some people<br/>
find it whacking up side the head. The fact that Sandra has found a style of<br/>
communication that&#39;s useful to get her unschooling ideas across to newbies,<br/>
makes the fact that others find it attacking irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not advocating rudeness by that. But, as an example, if I find a good<br/>
place to talk about unschooling with willing listeners and someone gets<br/>
upset that I&#39;m not discussing gardening, should I change to please them? If<br/>
my intent is to communicate unschooling to newbies and I&#39;ve found a style<br/>
that does that effectively, then anyone who finds that style irritating<br/>
should just avoid my posts.<br/>

style or whatever. But we don&#39;t have the right or the ability to choose it<br/>
for someone else. No one is obligated to anyone else but themselves. Because<br/>
we are naturally social creatures, most people do choose not to deliberately<br/>
create friction. *Not* because they have an obligation to others but because<br/>
they *want* to, it serves their own purposes. (Even selfless acts are<br/>
ultimately selfish.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a whole lot easier on the blood pressure when we finally realize we<br/>
don&#39;t have the right or the ability to control what others do (assuming they<br/>
aren&#39;t harming others). Everyone is entitled to live their life as they feel<br/>
they need to live it. No one owes us anything. Not even emoticons. So when<br/>
we find someone whose way of living their life annoys us our obligation to<br/>
ourselves is to avoid them as much as we can.<br/>

Holt are in the eye of the beholder. ;-) There is (arguably but certainly in<br/>
this case) no absolute truth that can be agreed on.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So in your imperfect world you will some how make sure all experts,<br/>
self-styled and otherwise, will all police themselves and make sure<br/>
everything they say and write is absolute truth and free from bias? You will<br/>
impose a moral obligation on them all and somehow get them all to adhere to<br/>
it and somehow get them to give up their imperfect humanity so that everyone<br/>
can absolute trust every thing they say?<br/>
<br/>
People have been trying to impose morality on humanity since the beginning<br/>
of time. We can&#39;t even get people to toe the line on big obvious morals like<br/>
killing is wrong and somehow you&#39;re going to get everyone to agree that as<br/>
soon as some people start seeing someone as an expert then they will police<br/>
themselves into saying nothing that can&#39;t be proved truth? What of people<br/>
who are looked on by others as experts who don&#39;t want that title? Just<br/>
because they have said a few insightful things to a few people they then are<br/>
obligated to the world to utter nothing but truth?<br/>
<br/>
As you say, the world is imperfect. Just because something should be a<br/>
certain way doesn&#39;t mean there is a way to make it so. We can&#39;t control what<br/>
others do. Whether it&#39;s believing in experts that lie or saying things that<br/>
aren&#39;t true. They only power we have is to control ourselves and that&#39;s<br/>
where the obligation -- to ourselves -- lies.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is we can only go so far to protect people from their own<br/>
stupidity. If we don&#39;t question experts for ourselves then we leave<br/>
ourselves open to exploitation by those who want us to believe they&#39;re<br/>
experts. Yes, it would make life a whole lot easier if we could trust<br/>
everything everyone says, but if we had the power to control people to make<br/>
that so, we could end poverty and hunger and deliberate harm to others.<br/>

&gt; Joyce <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree. That&#39;s why I questioned the resident list &quot;expert&quot; when she <br/>
replied to my first post about food allergies with a bunch of nonsense. <br/>
She was one who seems to like to say everything <br/>
about anything even when she knows nothing. When I broke it down point <br/>
by point to see if she had anything really to say about the topic, she <br/>
responded with hearsay about liars and <br/>
hypocrites, and a complaint about control issues. When I pointed out <br/>
the holes in her argument, she got angry and said I didn&#39;t know her at <br/>
all. I asked why the whole issue was so personal <br/>
for someone with no personal experience. She finally understood that <br/>
she was not on solid ground with her arguments, and was looking worse <br/>
with every round. She left. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I saw. Others complained about her being driven off by <br/>
longwinded attackers, maybe that was partly about me. I know that <br/>
things were happening before I joined the list, but <br/>
maybe my detailed point by point debate was the last straw.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she was helpful to many people to think about new ways to look at <br/>
life in general and unschooling specifically. She also refuses to <br/>
accept that her style affects her message, and that <br/>
maybe she isn&#39;t always right about everything for everybody. People are <br/>
different. She might get more people to listen to her theory about not <br/>
controlling our kids if she wasn&#39;t so fond of <br/>
control herself. It is more effective to communicate the value of <br/>
freedom in an atmosphere of freedom from personal attack. <br/>
<br/>
People called her style &quot;calling others on their being wrong&quot;. The <br/>
problem with that adversarial style is that it sets her up as the <br/>
expert who is telling you you&#39;re wrong, without even knowing <br/>
you, your kids, your life or where you are on your journey to freedom. <br/>
Those kind of experts are the very kind she&#39;s so against. <br/>
<br/>
Learning is a process that takes different people along many paths. Her <br/>
way is not the only way, nor is it entirely consistent. I think that&#39;s <br/>
what bothers her critics. Her own lack of logic or <br/>
consistency yet demanding others conform to her views.<br/>
<br/>
Her defense (and that of her followers) was that we don&#39;t know her very <br/>
well. That&#39;s her responsibility to convey herself so that we can know <br/>
her. We did know her better than she may have <br/>
wanted us to. Her posts revealed inconsistencies that she was <br/>
uncomfortable with, and instead of acknowledging them, she left and <br/>
blamed us.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt communicated his findings in an observational way, without <br/>
making those who hadn&#39;t seen all that yet, feel attacked. He said &quot;This <br/>
is what I&#39;ve found and seen. These are <br/>
experiences of others and what worked and didn&#39;t work for them.&quot; He was <br/>
not someone I followed, but someone whose experiences and observations <br/>
are so useful when I am finding my <br/>
own way.  <br/>
<br/>
Kathy B.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ps- for those that feel it is unfair to discuss someone behind their <br/>
back consider the following.<br/>
 <br/>
1- she left and is free to return at any time<br/>
2- she has many supporters on this list who have been defending       <br/>
(talking about) her still also<br/>
3- those friends are free to forward anything to her so she can defend <br/>
herself<br/>
4- I am sure she is pleased by the amount of residual celebrity that <br/>
she has carried on this list. A famous wit once observed &quot;The only <br/>
thing worse than being talked about, is not being talked about.&quot;<br/>
5- She felt strongly about isues of control and so do we. We don&#39;t want <br/>
anyone to control the list.<br/>
6- communication style is an ongoing issue for any list of diverse <br/>
viewpoints. </span></blockquote></div>

  replied to my first post about food allergies with a bunch of nonsense. <br/>
  She was one who seems to like to say everything <br/>
  about anything even when she knows nothing. When I broke it down point <br/>
  by point to see if she had anything really to say about the topic, she <br/>
  responded with hearsay about liars and <br/>
  hypocrites, and a complaint about control issues. When I pointed out <br/>
  the holes in her argument, she got angry and said I didn&#39;t know her at <br/>
  all. I asked why the whole issue was so personal <br/>
  for someone with no personal experience. She finally understood that <br/>
  she was not on solid ground with her arguments, and was looking worse <br/>
  with every round. She left. <br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s what I saw. Others complained about her being driven off by <br/>
  longwinded attackers, maybe that was partly about me. I know that <br/>
  things were happening before I joined the list, but <br/>
  maybe my detailed point by point debate was the last straw.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe she was helpful to many people to think about new ways to look at <br/>
  life in general and unschooling specifically. She also refuses to <br/>
  accept that her style affects her message, and that <br/>
  maybe she isn&#39;t always right about everything for everybody. People are <br/>
  different. She might get more people to listen to her theory about not <br/>
  controlling our kids if she wasn&#39;t so fond of <br/>
  control herself. It is more effective to communicate the value of <br/>
  freedom in an atmosphere of freedom from personal attack. <br/>
<br/>
  People called her style &quot;calling others on their being wrong&quot;. The <br/>
  problem with that adversarial style is that it sets her up as the <br/>
  expert who is telling you you&#39;re wrong, without even knowing <br/>
  you, your kids, your life or where you are on your journey to freedom. <br/>
  Those kind of experts are the very kind she&#39;s so against. <br/>
<br/>
  Learning is a process that takes different people along many paths. Her <br/>
  way is not the only way, nor is it entirely consistent. I think that&#39;s <br/>
  what bothers her critics. Her own lack of logic or <br/>
  consistency yet demanding others conform to her views.<br/>
<br/>
  Her defense (and that of her followers) was that we don&#39;t know her very <br/>
  well. That&#39;s her responsibility to convey herself so that we can know <br/>
  her. We did know her better than she may have <br/>
  wanted us to. Her posts revealed inconsistencies that she was <br/>
  uncomfortable with, and instead of acknowledging them, she left and <br/>
  blamed us.<br/>
<br/>
  John Holt communicated his findings in an observational way, without <br/>
  making those who hadn&#39;t seen all that yet, feel attacked. He said &quot;This <br/>
  is what I&#39;ve found and seen. These are <br/>
  experiences of others and what worked and didn&#39;t work for them.&quot; He was <br/>
  not someone I followed, but someone whose experiences and observations <br/>
  are so useful when I am finding my <br/>
  own way.  <br/>

<br/>
  ps- for those that feel it is unfair to discuss someone behind their <br/>
  back consider the following.<br/>
<br/>
  1- she left and is free to return at any time<br/>
  2- she has many supporters on this list who have been defending       <br/>
  (talking about) her still also<br/>
  3- those friends are free to forward anything to her so she can defend <br/>
  herself<br/>
  4- I am sure she is pleased by the amount of residual celebrity that <br/>
  she has carried on this list. A famous wit once observed &quot;The only <br/>
  thing worse than being talked about, is not being talked about.&quot;<br/>
  5- She felt strongly about isues of control and so do we. We don&#39;t want <br/>
  anyone to control the list.<br/>
  6- communication style is an ongoing issue for any list of diverse <br/>
  viewpoints.<br/>

By my observation, it appears that more work is needed  along the lines of &quot;I&quot;<br/>
statements of motive and actions rather than proclamations of personal<br/>
perceptions regarding the intent of other posters being infallible.<br/>
*I* have no need to validate my  beliefs by stomping on others.    Nor fear that<br/>
listening to a question  along the lines of &quot;is your experience truly different<br/>
than mine&quot;  necessarily  a surrender.<br/>

Interesting that Sandra was blamed as being just as responsible for the<br/>
nastiness on the list as the people who were so nasty to her, and yet<br/>
she&#39;s been unsubbed for over a week and the nastiness and personal<br/>
attacks are still here... <br/>

HEM (and other print newsletters) for at least 8 years is *hardly* hit and<br/>
run.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That&#39;s why I questioned the resident list &quot;expert&quot; when she<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, this is a really hard point to describe. It&#39;s one of those missing<br/>
puzzle pieces that I mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
She was arguing an entirely different point. It was more along the lines of<br/>
she was saying &quot;Breastfeeding is how babies naturally need to eat&quot; and<br/>
others were saying &quot;Yes, but what about a cleft palate child who needs a<br/>
bottle.&quot; (I&#39;m making that up since I can&#39;t think of something off the top of<br/>
my head that would prevent a child from breastfeeding.) The second doesn&#39;t<br/>
alter the truth of the first. If her argument had been that all babies need<br/>
to breastfeed, then the second *would* be a counterargument. But the second<br/>
*isn&#39;t* a counterargument against what is natural for babies. Does that make<br/>
sense?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s frustrating for those participating since there were (and not for the<br/>
first time) two separate arguments going on at the same time and each was<br/>
assuming the other was arguing about the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you dislike her style or whether you wanted her to argue something<br/>
different than she was arguing or whatever, she is who she is and is<br/>
entitled to that and doesn&#39;t need to change to be more like what others need<br/>
from someone.<br/>
<br/>
Second, if someone says she has a certain amount of experience that is<br/>
merely a statement of fact. If others interpret that to mean &quot;I&#39;m an expert&quot;<br/>
or assume it&#39;s inteded as a challenge or something to shame them into<br/>
silence then who is at fault, the one speaking facts or the one<br/>
interpretting them?<br/>
<br/>
If someone speaks strongly on things she cares deeply about, if others find<br/>
it difficult to argue with her (whether because of facts or writing style or<br/>
thinking style) does that automatically confer expert status on her?<br/>
<br/>
Since Sandra doesn&#39;t call herself an expert calling her a<br/>
quote-resident-expert-unquote (implying the so-called title is questionable<br/>
when *she* isn&#39;t doing the calling) would be a personal attack.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She finally understood that<br/>
&gt; she was not on solid ground with her arguments, and was looking worse<br/>
&gt; with every round. She left.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That might be a natural conclusion to draw if someone&#39;s only experience was<br/>
the tail end of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Just as a point of fact and not to be interpretted as being an expert on<br/>
Sandra, I&#39;ve seen her for 6 years in very heated discussions (in the<br/>
point/counterpoint folder on the AOL homeschooling boards set up for that<br/>
purpose) and being &quot;called&quot; on her beliefs doesn&#39;t make Sandra turn tail and<br/>
run. So the timing of her departure had nothing to do with you.<br/>
<br/>
What causes problems is when someone perceives her attacks on ideas as<br/>
personal attacks and then personally attacks her in return. That others<br/>
perceive the situation differently (and call up quotes to &quot;prove&quot; their<br/>
point) doesn&#39;t alter Sandra&#39;s intent. Nor, unfortunately, does her intent<br/>
alter some people&#39;s perceptions. Time usually takes care of that. Or makes<br/>
it worse. Perhaps some are destined never to &quot;get&quot; her.<br/>

something and can&#39;t see that they have, and someone else perceives it<br/>
differently, does that mean they have done it?<br/>
<br/>
Either they&#39;re lying or they are perceiving things in a very different way.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is known for honesty is there another possibility other than a<br/>
very different way of perceiving things? Someone is lying about being<br/>
honest? Others are mistaken in their perception of that someone&#39;s honesty?<br/>
Believing that one of those last two must be true in order for truth to<br/>
match perception doesn&#39;t make it so.<br/>
