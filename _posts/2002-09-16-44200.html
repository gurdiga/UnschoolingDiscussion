&gt; The person asking has already been very,very rude.People<br/>
&gt; that are  sensitive and well bred (as my Grandma used to say) don`t ask<br/>
personal questions. I am upset at the lack of courtesy  that seems to abound<br/>
now.Annamae </span></blockquote></div>

<br/>
How about saying &quot;what would you like to know&quot;?  It sounds open and<br/>
friendly but it has the possibility that you&#39;ll get more information<br/>
from the questioner before committing yourself.<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t get more specific about their question and their motive,<br/>
THEN drag out the big, vague, distracting answer.<br/>

<br/>
That does sound more friendly.  Like you&#39;re trying to do them a favor, <br/>
instead of trying to shut them out or brush them off.<br/>
<br/>
And honestly, I think half or more of the conversations about homeschooling <br/>
are no deeper or more real than the traditional dialog that adults have with <br/>
children they don&#39;t know very well or see very often.<br/>
<br/>
Hi!  What&#39;s your name?<br/>
[state your name]<br/>
Do you like school?  <br/>
or<br/>
Where do you go to school?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your teacher&#39;s name?<br/>
<br/>
What do you like best at school?<br/>
<br/>
And then the conversation&#39;s over.<br/>
<br/>
They could talk to kids about baseball or tv or bicycles or the sky or <br/>
Superman, but they say &quot;How do you like school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if someone&#39;s homeschooling, others will say &quot;So.  Are you still <br/>
homeschooling?&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;Have you started your school year?&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;How&#39;s the homeschooling going?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When people say &quot;SO.  How are you?&quot;<br/>
the answer is <br/>
Fine!  Thanks!  How are you?<br/>
or <br/>
Pretty good, and you?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even if your foot is a purple and green baseball and you can&#39;t walk.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe we just need some stock answers for those stock questions.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the answers are &quot;Great!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yeah!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yep!&quot;<br/>
&quot;So far so good!&quot;<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re having a good time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are they going to college?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sure they will.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Oh probably.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Maybe, but maybe not right away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All accompanied by a smile.<br/>
<br/>
Because they don&#39;t want to hear about John Holt, I&#39;ll bet you $5.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128823499">Someone else: How&#39;s the homeschooling going?<br/>
Me: I Love It!<br/>
<br/>
Shuts then up every single time. No one can possibly understand why<br/>
anyone would want to spend all day with their own  kids.... so, my<br/>
enthusiasm always leaves them speechless.<br/>

understand you and answer your question better kind of way. The nosey ones <br/>
and the ones looking for trouble will stammer. The interested ones <br/>
understand and ask specifics. I don&#39;t see where asking is any more rude than <br/>
yawning and looking bored and walking away.<br/>
