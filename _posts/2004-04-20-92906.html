<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313380765"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My 14 y.o. is fascinated with war history (watches &quot;Mail Call&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>frequently), weaponry of all eras AND many, many other complex <br/>
machines. He&#39;s also a peace activist.  <br/>
Why would I limit his interest in history and weapons, just because <br/>
there are other things to explore?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a pacifist. I didn&#39;t want &quot;war weapons&quot; in my house (with #1 son), but <br/>
eventually relented. I would move to another country to avoid sending my boys to <br/>
war. I avoid &quot;war news&quot; and articles.<br/>
<br/>
BUT.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t get enough of war movies (although I don&#39;t care for Viet Nam <br/>
movies----too close to home???)---especially WWII and earlier. I&#39;m married to a <br/>
Citadel graduate (never thought THAT would happen in a million years! &lt;g&gt;) who was <br/>
also Air Force and is now Air National Guard. I love Mail Call too----and the <br/>
History Channel is my favorite channel. I watched Spartacus the last two <br/>
nights----rather bloodless battles! Caesar and Napolean and Stalin and ----they&#39;re <br/>
all fair game. The Inquistion? Love it.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-gun weaponry----fascinating. Torture devices? Ugh! But fascinating. <br/>
<br/>
Hate war. Hate violence.<br/>
<br/>
Hate having no computer for ten days! &lt;g&gt; Sorry I&#39;m so late chiming in!<br/>

<br/>
And whoduthunk a Citadel graduate would be a huge advocate for <br/>
UNschooling!!?  Ben&#39;s a cool guy.<br/>
But then, you&#39;re a really cool gal Kelly...I&#39;m not surprised.<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you&#39;re back, I was just starting to worry!<br/>
