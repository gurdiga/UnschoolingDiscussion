<div id="ygrps-yiv-309154453">Joz, I am glad to see someone (like yourself) that is new to hsing-unschooling take a stand.  This problem of some continually trying to argue over what someone says is a major problem with a lot of lists.  What I wish is that each and every one would do is to take a few minutes to put theirselves in the other persons shoes and then to give encouragement to that person on what they did right, and then maybe give some courteous recommendations or suggestions on how they could do it better.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I may be putting my own foot in where it doesn&#39;t belong, because I am a homeshooling/unschooling father and so I&#39;m not one of the &#39;gals&#39;.  But I just want to say &#39;Welcome!&#39;<br/>

Hi Joz ---<br/>
<br/>
Just ignore what seems like face-slapping or whatever, to you, and read for <br/>
the content that is useful to you. That is the ONLY advice that will work <br/>
(that sounds so arrogant - but what I mean is to emphasize that I have had <br/>
years and years of experience watching lists and have never once seen any <br/>
other option work &lt;G&gt;). For one thing, what seems antagonistic to you might <br/>
not to people who might have known each other for years, as many people here <br/>
have. And - besides, it never ever ever does any good on any list to try to <br/>
change anybody else&#39;s posting style. It clogs up the list with posts about <br/>
posting style rather than content and nobody ever changes because someone <br/>
complains, they just dig in their heels. Things get uglier and nastier the <br/>
more people complain that they think things are ugly and nasty. Honest. <br/>
<br/>
So - use your delete key or just sigh and go on when something doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
nice to you. If there are ideas or information that are useful - take them <br/>
gladly and ignore anything that isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times the heated responses and disagreements generate a lot of light, <br/>
though, so don&#39;t be too eager to douse them. Sometimes it is easier to <br/>
articulate why we think the way we do when we&#39;re arguing against what someone <br/>
else thinks - we sometimes change our minds or we clarify or fine-tune our <br/>
own ideas and we have to think harder about WHY we believe what we do. It can <br/>
be argumentative and sound pretty hostile - but it is often very productive, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can be frustrating and annoying - because we often want &quot;answers&quot; <br/>
and what we get are a bunch of strongly held conflicting ideas. But if you <br/>
you let them sink in and float around and knock against each other in your <br/>
brain -- while you fool around with your kids and oberve other people with <br/>
their kids -- your own personal decisions and style will slowly develop out <br/>
of the mix.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Joz and welcome! Sorry you&#39;re feeling scared by all this talk and sorry <br/>
if I contributed to that feeling. :-/ My posts on the subject were supposed <br/>
to have the opposite effect. I truly believe that parents can calm down <br/>
about &quot;teaching&quot; their 6 year olds to read. I&#39;ve watched both of my kids <br/>
learn using the &quot;methods&quot; that worked best for them. It really did work best <br/>
when I did NOT impose any one method on them. It also helps to know that 6 <br/>
is not some magical reading age, no matter what the school system thinks. <br/>
Each kid is different and unschooling can allow for those differences.<br/>
<br/>
So, if your 6 year old is trying to sound out words, terrific! Help him <br/>
along and give him those letter sounds and blends. If he&#39;s trying to read <br/>
signs on the road, great! Help him read them without a long instruction <br/>
lesson on why the letters make those sounds. Give him the info he needs and <br/>
wants and watch him do the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Around here, we read tons of books at all different levels. We played with <br/>
those letters on the fridge (Hi Ned :o)), we labelled stuff in the house, <br/>
wrote words in the sand, made our names out of clay, read cereal boxes and <br/>
stop signs. We used Bob Books, Dr. Seuss, Magic Treehouse books, comics, <br/>
Pokemon cards, magazines, TV captioning, all of it. We did what was fun and <br/>
left behind the rest. Casey even loved workbooks when she was 3 and 4 and <br/>
did those non-stop it seemed. Conor did none. They are 8 and 13 now and both <br/>
reading. It happens. Please try not to worry.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Like Pam said, it&#39;s hard to change posting styles. (Except our own, that <br/>
is.) I know that lots of us like to have lively *debates* as it helps us <br/>
firm up our own ideas. I&#39;ve never seen a newbie (or anyone really) get <br/>
slapped around. You will get disagreed with, though, if you have an &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
right and you&#39;re wrong&quot; style of stating things. But that&#39;s how lots of us <br/>
have come to understand unschooling better, by challenging our own belief <br/>
systems. I, personally, try to be kind when disagreeing. I hope that comes <br/>
across in print like it does in my head as I type.<br/>

you&#39;re unlikely to find many other places. That can make it uncomfortable at <br/>
times and mind-blowingly wonderful at others.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well let&#39;s face it, phonics and multiplication are a part of real life. <br/>
Phonics is a basic part of reading and multiplication is used lots in real <br/>
life math.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion that comes up in unschooling is whether these real life <br/>
situations need to be &quot;taught&quot; in an artificial manner before the child ever <br/>
has a real life reason to use them. From an unschooling point of view, the <br/>
time to help a child with phonics is when they&#39;re eager to learn and asking <br/>
about letters and sounds and such. The time to stop with the phonics is when <br/>
their particular question has been answered and they&#39;ve moved on.<br/>
<br/>
The time for multiplication is when it would be useful for the child to <br/>
know. Like &quot;How many weeks allowance will it take for me to save up $100?&quot; <br/>
For that, it&#39;s pretty useful to be able to count by 5&#39;s or 10&#39;s or whatever <br/>
the weekly allowance is. That&#39;s a good intro into multiplication. Do they <br/>
need to memorize multiplication tables and do it by age 9? The schools would <br/>
tell us yes. An unschooler would say no, they need an understanding of how <br/>
numbers work and eventually some numbers rules to get to the answers they <br/>
need more easily. And they&#39;ll get that through using the numbers. Just like <br/>
they&#39;ll get the phonics concepts a little at a time as they&#39;re figuring out <br/>
reading.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:rachel@...">rachel@...</a> writes:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As an unschooler - I expect that my kids will learn to sound out words <br/>
(phonics) and will learn to multiply (multiplication tables). Unschooling <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean &quot;unlearning&quot; &lt;G&gt;. I don&#39;t &quot;make them learn&quot; and I don&#39;t plan <br/>
their learning in some systematic structured progressive bit-by-bit way. But <br/>
I do have a lot of ideas and fun and interesting possibilities always at my <br/>
fingertips -- that&#39;s how we live our lives. I treat multiplication tables as <br/>
a potentially interesting and useful thing to know or do in the same way I <br/>
treat riding a horse, clearing the dinner table, going to an opera, or <br/>
reading a book. <br/>
<br/>
So - you&#39;d have to know that, I guess, or you might think I was suggesting <br/>
sitting your kid down and telling them, &quot;Now is multiplication time - please <br/>
fill out this chart in this way using these colored pencils.&quot; No -- we&#39;re not <br/>
doing that. In fact, I&#39;m more likely to fool with it myself and then &quot;let&quot; <br/>
the kids do one too, if they ask. Or - I might say, &quot;Here - I had this cool <br/>
idea about multiplying - wanna see it?&quot; OR - a kid might moan and groan that <br/>
they don&#39;t know multiplication facts and it is slowing them down in some <br/>
other activity their trying to pursue - so I might tell them that I have some <br/>
pretty fun ways in mind that can help them learn them.<br/>
<br/>
It is always an offer and it is always something that they can take or leave <br/>
or expand or cut short or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I agree - a formal phonics or math program would not be appropriate to <br/>
suggest on an unschooling list. Thanks for pointing that out, Rachel, and <br/>
giving me the opportunity to clarify how I intended the multiplication stuff <br/>
to be considered - just as something fun that kids and parents might enjoy, <br/>
not as a &quot;lesson,&quot; by any means.<br/>
<br/>
You should have seen me sitting here drawing the spirolaterals the other day <br/>
-- I had a bunch of kids here and after 5 minutes they were all drawing and <br/>
coloring too. That&#39;s just for fun, not school &lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
