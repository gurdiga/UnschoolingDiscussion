 </span></blockquote>What happened is that he was taught that WOMEN cleaned<br/>
up these messes, not men.  My husband (Korean) was brought<br/>
up the very same way as your husband.  In his home, men never<br/>
lifted a finger.  From the moment they walked through the door, to<br/>
the moment they left the house, the women waited on them hand<br/>
and foot.  Food was brought to them, and dirty dishes were taken<br/>
away and washed.  They would dump dirty clothes on the floor and<br/>
the clothes were scooped up by the women, washed, folded and put<br/>
back into drawers.  When hubby needed new underwear, his Mom<br/>
ran out and bought them for him (this was when he was 25!!).  At <br/>
dinner, if his drink was almost finished, she would jump up to refill<br/>
it for him before it was empty.  Same with his rice bowl.  His mother<br/>
always cut up the meat for her husband so he wouldn&#39;t have to be<br/>
bothered cutting his own meat.  She also took the bones out of fish<br/>
for him, again, so he could eat without having to work at it.  The men <br/>
did NOTHING *in* the house!!   <br/>
<br/>
It has taken YEARS for me to get my husband to help around the<br/>
house.  When we were living with his parents, they would literally<br/>
scold him whenever he tried to help me out accusing me of being<br/>
a very lazy wife for not doing EVERYTHING for him.  <br/>
<br/>
One time, they literally jumped down my throat because I refused<br/>
to peel oranges for him, section them and present them to him on<br/>
a plate.  I figured, he&#39;s a grown man, he can peel his own oranges!<br/>
Nope, we&#39;ve had whole boxes of mandarin oranges go bad because<br/>
he refused to peel them himself.  So, I&#39;ve just quit buying oranges.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on,,,but I&#39;m sure you get the picture.<br/>

himself!!!!<br/>
