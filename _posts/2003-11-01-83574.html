<div id="ygrps-yiv-318883250">Sounds like an interesting story -- if we&#39;re ever in the same town I&#39;ll buy <br/>
you a beer and you can tell me the whole thing. &lt;g&gt;  If I understand your <br/>
point, you&#39;re saying that when kids do these things, they have their own <br/>
reasons, <br/>
and those reasons should be respected as much as our own?  I&#39;m not <br/>
disagreeing <br/>
-- just want to make sure I understand.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

Amy, sorry, I got confused there, so also sorry to Tia!  To answer your <br/>
question, yes, I think their reasons should be respected as much as ours, but also <br/>
I think we need to actually take the TIME to find out what their reasons are.  <br/>
And when they don&#39;t know, I try to help my children think a little further, <br/>
but if they can&#39;t figure it out, well, heck, sometimes I can&#39;t figure out why I <br/>
do things either.  But I think it all comes down to what was said <br/>
earlier-parents (from what I&#39;ve seen) use spanking because they either don&#39; t know or <br/>
don&#39;t want to take the time to figure out another solution.  How easy would it be <br/>
to explain to Rupert (tired of Johnny) that running out in front of a car <br/>
could kill you?  Why not tell him his body could be come mangled, etc.-why not <br/>
give him age/maturity appropriate information?  And if you have to do it more <br/>
than once, well, there are things that have had to be explained to me more than <br/>
once!  I just think if we respect our children like we do complete strangers <br/>
maybe -well, you get it.<br/>

PS.  Amy, if you are ever in the Orlando area, I&#39;ll take you up on that <br/>
drink.</div>
