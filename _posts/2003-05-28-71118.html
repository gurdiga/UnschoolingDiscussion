it&#39;d be &#39;good for&#39; my son to take swimming classes, and i set it up for him <br/>
without his input, that would clearly not be unschooling.  if i understand <br/>
correctly, it would still fit with the unschooling family if he wanted to <br/>
learn to swim by taking classes, and i told him we could go at such & such <br/>
a time regularly, and he wanted to do it.  the class itself would be <br/>
unschooling, but just because we&#39;re unschooling doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s forbidden <br/>
to choose to learn things by taking classes.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m a little less clear on who suggests taking a class, from the <br/>
description of the homeschooling classes in a previous message.  again <br/>
closer to home: if andre & i talk about swimming, and he says he wants to <br/>
learn how, i don&#39;t think he has to be the one to look for ways to learn to <br/>
swim.  i think i can suggest ways to learn (e.g. i could tell him that we <br/>
could go to a local pool & thrash around on our own, that i could give him <br/>
some pointers, or that he could take a swim class), and let him choose his <br/>
own way of learning.  then again, andre is only 4.  if he was 14, he&#39;d <br/>
probably know that classes exist, and he could be the one to search out <br/>
info about the local pools.  :-)<br/>
<br/>

that we&#39;re going to the zoo tomorrow, or having a friend over at 10am--as <br/>
well as lots of unstructured time.  and i need to have some rhythm for my <br/>

<br/>
Well, why would you present 4-H to them in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
OTH, if you went to the fair and saw 4-H presentations and your child<br/>
brought up that they would like to do that, that could be unschooling.  I<br/>
suppose that 4-H varies a lot depending on the leader, but their stuff looks<br/>
pretty schoolish to me.  Not that people can&#39;t do schoolish things as part<br/>
of unschooling.  But if the parent sees 4-H as a way to get their kids to<br/>
accomplish something, it really wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have erred with telling my kids about classes and getting them signed up<br/>
and haven&#39;t always had positive results.<br/>
I think that a child old enough to benefit from classes would probably<br/>
either know about their existence or would somehow be asking for help to<br/>
learn something.  I don&#39;t think the parent would NEED to tell the kid that<br/>
there are classes.<br/>
<br/>
I had to bite my tongue the other day when Jackie was playing drums with one<br/>
real drum and two overturned buckets.  I wanted to say &quot;You could take a<br/>
drum class.&quot;.  I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t.  She KNOWS there are classes for all<br/>
kinds of stuff.  She knows her cousin takes drum class and has required<br/>
practice time.  I&#39;m certain that if she ever wants drum lessons she will let<br/>
me know.  For now, she just wants to play her drums when she feels like it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also important to give a child an out if they sign up for a class and<br/>
don&#39;t like it.  Which is why its also important to not rush into signing up<br/>
for classes without exploring other options first.<br/>

Well, if you are thinking about coming over to my house and making ME<br/>

unschooling.  (I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you meant &lt;g&gt;, I just scare easily.)<br/>

You can structure your own life however suits you.  You can have a<br/>
schedule and try to stick to it religiously, or you can change your<br/>
schedule every day to suit your whims.  If you find yourself saying to<br/>
your kids a lot &quot;not now I&#39;m doing the laundry&quot; then you may want to<br/>
make adjustments for greater unschooling efficacy.  That is, being able<br/>
to be very responsive to questions and requests.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the kid, and what accomplishments are being considered.  If a <br/>
kid&#39;s really interested in livestock and they live in an apartment, it would be <br/>
vastly cheaper to drive the kid to all the 4-H meetings and fairs he wanted than <br/>
to buy land and get sheep or pigs.<br/>
<br/>
And for kids who are wanting social life and new friends, 4-H could be the <br/>
means to accomplish that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think that a child old enough to benefit from classes would probably<br/>
<br/>
either know about their existence or would somehow be asking for help to<br/>
<br/>
learn something. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I stumbled upon the Junior Police Academy here, while on a website looking <br/>
for something altogether unrelated.  I KNEW Marty would be interested.  Should I <br/>
have waited to see if he would stumble across it too?  That would be cruel.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s already signed up and has been to the orientation and fitted for his <br/>
uniform. It&#39;s all paid for by the Police Athletic League.  It lasts a week and <br/>
he&#39;s really excited about it.<br/>
<br/>
Two different friends of mine sent me information on a Weird Al concert <br/>
scheduled here for August.  I might eventually have discovered that on my own, but <br/>
they WANT me to go and they want us all to sit together.   So they told me <br/>
because they knew and they knew I would want to know.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m treating my kids the way I treat my friends.  Unschooling is not some <br/>
sort of test on which they can&#39;t cheat, and getting help from adults would be <br/>
cheating.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never signed them up for classes they didn&#39;t want to take, but letting <br/>
them know what&#39;s available doesn&#39;t violate any unschooling principles, for me.  <br/>
 Holly was in my office the other night and said &quot;what&#39;s this?&quot; about the UNM <br/>
Continuing Education catalog.  I picked it up and flipped through, reading <br/>
what kinds of classes they have, and explained that they&#39;re mostly one-day or <br/>
short-term things, not for college credit, just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to press her to enroll.  I was just answering her question <br/>
and giving her six or eight examples to give her the range.<br/>

Be proactive instead of reactive, I guess.  Don&#39;t wait for him to ask. <br/>
Don&#39;t expect a seven year old to &quot;take others&#39; needs into account.&quot;<br/>
HE has needs, and if you&#39;re going to homeschool, you should be spending at <br/>
least as much time with and on him as you would be if he were in school, <br/>
including &quot;school hours.&quot;  He shouldn&#39;t be having LESS adult attention and <br/>
involvement as a homeschooler than he would have if he were in school, he should have <br/>
more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-416582878">Sandra asks:  Why (and for whose benefit) should he &quot;do a project&quot;?****<br/>
<br/>
Why would he put it in those terms?  Probably because until March of this year he attended school or was homeschooled &quot;eclectically&quot;, and probably because he hears his parents talk about doing projects.  It&#39;s part of the language of the household, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine he expects to benefit from it because it was his idea.  I dont&#39; particularly like bugs.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Adn why, if he cares about insects, would a book be his first desire?*******<br/>
<br/>
I think his first inclination would be to get a book because he likes to read and also probably because he sees his mother reaching for a book when learning about something new.  Also probably because that&#39;s what he learned to do in school, albeit for a relatively short time.<br/>
<br/>
What about bug-catching equipment?  Videos of rainforest and desert insects?****<br/>
<br/>
We have bug-catching equipment around here somewhere.  We&#39;ve just moved, we&#39;re still unpacking.  We have an ant farm on hand, a Christmas gift, that had been sitting idle, but available, for ages.  I suggested we send away for the ants when he expressed this interest in insects.  The ants haven&#39;t arrived yet.    <br/>
<br/>
If you provide him lots of experiences and sights and sounds, he won&#39;t ever need to &quot;make requests,&quot; he&#39;ll just be learning all the time. *****<br/>

See, I feel he perceives it as pushy if I offer experiences (to go somewhere, for example), or he tells me he&#39;s too busy to do what I&#39;ve offered.  So I&#39;ve backed off, waiting for him to ask for what he wants.  And then I think to myself, &quot;how does he even know what&#39;s out there for the asking?&quot;.  And the brain goes round and round.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
He shouldn&#39;t be having LESS adult attention and involvement as a homeschooler than he would have if he were in school, he should have more.****<br/>
<br/>
Right, of course.  So I say, &quot;hey Matthew let&#39;s go get some cleats for baseball&quot; or some such thing.  His response is invariably, &quot;Not now, I&#39;m doing XYZ&quot;.  Then XYZ is followed by ABC and I figure ok I&#39;ll go throw in some laundry and then he wants me *now.  So I say, &quot;I&#39;ll be right there&quot;, and then he gets distracted and so the day goes.  He seems to have an agenda in his head, and being with Mom is not on it, or being with Mom is on the agenda when I&#39;m reaching into the washing machine or my toddler is running amuck.  I don&#39;t like this dynamic and I don&#39;t know what to do about it.<br/>

thanks for your thoughts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve had some of that too.  Holly wanted to go to Walmart Monday night.  I <br/>
was exhausted, we had a house full of dirty dishes, laundry and camping <br/>
equipment, five coolers to unload, etc., and she wanted me to take her to Walmart to <br/>
get an iron on patch.  I said no, sorry.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I said &quot;Let&#39;s go to Walmart!&quot; but she had planned to meet a friend <br/>
at the park.   <br/>
<br/>
So for Wednesday, each kid had an errand (or rather Kirby needed to go to <br/>
work and the other two had errands).   I had said in advance that when Kirby went <br/>
to work we should all go out and do what needed to be done.  It was great.  <br/>
We did Holly&#39;s Walmart run (and found the Snakes&#39;n&#39;ladders towels, but had no <br/>
other impulse buys), and then had a sit-down lunch where they told me stories <br/>
about the weekend (we hardly saw each other, even when I visited the camp to <br/>
bring them more food a few times), and we went to the uniform store to order <br/>
Marty&#39;s uniform for the camp/academy he&#39;s going to next week.<br/>
<br/>
We try to discuss each night what each person has promised or hopes to do the <br/>
next day, and we schedule in advance that way.  Sometimes there are sudden <br/>
impulse doings, and that&#39;s okay too.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you make a list of things to do (like buy cleats) and a time or two <br/>
a day go through the list and propose things that can be done in combo or one <br/>
trip out, and ask him when he wants to plan to do it it might help.  (or not, <br/>
but it might be worth a try)<br/>

An aside:  The chalkboard is helping my feeble attempts to peaceably plan dinner. Matthew saw tonight&#39;s menu and said, &quot;I&#39;ll take the garlic bread, but I&#39;ll make the rest of my dinner myself&quot;.  Okay by me, kiddo.<br/>

I find this very a very interesting request from a 7 yo unschooler.  <br/>
My kids when they were 7 they went out and watched or caught insects. <br/>
Sometimes they found books about insects in the library.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think an idea for a &quot;project&quot; ever popped into their heads.  Insects <br/>
were there, they enjoyed them and they didn&#39;t need me (except perhaps <br/>
to put holes in the top of a jar).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189810463">**Okay, so...does scheduling classes mean you&#39;re not unschooling? Is one <br/>
definition of unschooling &quot;Zero Structure&quot;?**<br/>
<br/>
**When I wrote that I meant classes that the parents schedule. Not that the <br/>
child is asking I dont think they did.  The group I was referring to more <br/>
closely <br/>
resembles School-in other places. They do piano, Mad Science, History get <br/>
togethers,writing classes and much more.**<br/>
<br/>
And it gets complicated because some kids are there because they saw the <br/>
announcement and yelled &quot;MOM! Can I pleeeeaaaaseee go?&quot; and others because Mom saw <br/>
the announcement and said &quot;Hey, you want to go?&quot; and still others are because <br/>
Mom signed her kids up for everything and they WILL go and like it too or <br/>
else. :)  Some &quot;unschooling&quot; groups run full fledged co-ops one day a week. Some <br/>
run &quot;enrichment days&quot; every month. Some really ought to call their groups <br/>
&quot;school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My son hopes to find some other kids who want to come play around with math <br/>
games and puzzles with him on a regular basis. We live on the outskirts of a <br/>
huge metro area, so there are bound to be at least a few unschoolers reasonably <br/>
close who&#39;d also be interested. My problem/task is how to find them without <br/>
having to fend off the many many parents who are bound to see &quot;math club&quot; or <br/>
whatever he decides to call it as a great way to sneak some instruction into <br/>
their reluctant child. When we were looking for kids to come play video games that <br/>
wasn&#39;t a problem, no one seems to think their kids &quot;need&quot; more exposure to <br/>
video games. LOL<br/>

I met a woman at the ice rink a few weeks ago who&#39;s a very new homeschooler, <br/>

Anyway, she said she&#39;d been reading The Well Trained Mind and I gave my honest <br/>
opinion of it. She said another homeschooler had told her that Well Trained Mind <br/>
is Unschooling. I think that qualifies as my mind boggler of the month.<br/>
