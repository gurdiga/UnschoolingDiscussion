<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082362145">My husband found an interesting article while he was perusing family.com (a <br/>
Disney site).  If you go to the front page of family.com, there is a link to <br/>
an article called &quot;One Mom&#39;s Homeschooling Saga&quot;.&lt;A <br/>
HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://family.go.com/&quot;">http://family.go.com/&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>
www.family.com&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
<br/>
This article really burned me up!  The mom who wrote it homeschooled her kids <br/>
for awhile (school-at-home).  She decided it was high time to get them back <br/>
in school when they became confident and mature enough to handle it.  She <br/>
discusses the &quot;homeschooling horror stories&quot; she heard during her <br/>
homeschooling time.  <br/>
If her opinion had appeared on a message board somewhere, it would have still <br/>
irritated me, but hey - it&#39;s her opinion.  The fact that Disney is featuring <br/>
on the front page of family.com, with no opportunity for rebuttal, is an <br/>
insult.  What do you think?  I plan to let Disney know that there are other <br/>
views that should be aired as well.  Ugh.  Of course, right under the article <br/>
is a banner for their annual national teacher award.  Makes me queasy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739787424">Okay, I read this article and I&#39;m burning up right up along with you.  I<br/>
guess some of us need to write to these folks!  Something that seems to<br/>
happen rather frequently is that the people that are following school at<br/>
home ideas are the ones that seem to get put out there in the media.  I also<br/>
notice that families that are trying to create a school at home have<br/>
children that usually want to return to school.  Drives me nuts!  No<br/>
creativity, no interesting life....dull, dull, dull.  My dd is 12 and can&#39;t<br/>
imagine going to a school...she doesn&#39;t have time for it.  The woman that<br/>
wrote the article had a deep attachment to this socialization thing of<br/>
teenagers...she painted this pathetic picture of a poor lonely boy at the<br/>
dining room table reading.  We lead a vibrant, active and interesting<br/>
life...all of us.  I pity those people that never open their eyes to drink<br/>
in the world around them.<br/>

                            HOMESCHOOLING&#39;S POPULARITY IS GROWING<br/>
                            by Anne Pyburn <br/>
                                                                   <br/>
                            George Washington. Ben<br/>
                            Franklin. Thomas Edison.<br/>
                            Abraham Lincoln. Franklin<br/>
                            Roosevelt. Douglas MacAuthur.<br/>
                            Whoopi Goldberg. Quick�what<br/>
                            do these people all have in<br/>
                            common?<br/>
<br/>
                            Most of us learned of these prominent people<br/>
within the<br/>
                            walls of a school building. (Okay, maybe not<br/>
Goldberg.)<br/>
                            What they have in common with each other is<br/>
that they<br/>
                            were all homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
                            Public education in a central location is<br/>
actually a fairly<br/>
                            recent development in human history, a<br/>
byproduct of the<br/>
                            industrial revolution which forced the roles of<br/>
family<br/>
                            members to change as parents left home to work. In<br/>
                            earlier times, whether in tutoring sessions at<br/>
the castle or<br/>
                            by following Mom and Dad around the field, barn or<br/>
                            shop, home was the place people learned the<br/>
skills they<br/>
                            needed to lead productive lives.<br/>
<br/>
                            But what about socialization? How do homeschooling<br/>
                            parents handle subjects in which they<br/>
themselves are not<br/>
                            well versed? Is the whole thing even legal?<br/>
<br/>
                            As a matter of fact, home schooling is legal in<br/>
all 50<br/>
                            states, subject to a variety of rules and<br/>
regulations. New<br/>
                            York requires that homeschoolers submit<br/>
individualized<br/>
                            home instruction plans (IHIPs), quarterly<br/>
reports and a<br/>
                            few other forms of documentation, but the<br/>
essential right<br/>
                            of parents to customize their children&#39;s<br/>
education has<br/>
                            been repeatedly upheld. Dissatisfaction with<br/>
public<br/>
                            schools and high private-school tuition costs<br/>
are leading<br/>
                            more and more parents to homeschool their<br/>
children.<br/>
                            Some parents teach at home because of<br/>
discomfort with<br/>
                            the values (or lack thereof) that their<br/>
children are being<br/>
                            exposed to in centralized schools. Others do it<br/>
simply<br/>
                            because they feel they can offer more enrichment.<br/>
<br/>
                            They are not just a handful of discontented<br/>
families. The<br/>
                            National Home Education Research Institute,<br/>
surveying<br/>
                            homeschooling families in 1996 found 1.23 million<br/>
                            homeschooled students. (Public school<br/>
enrollment in<br/>
                            1993 was about 43.5 million). Since the 1980s,<br/>
                            homeschooling has been growing between 10 and 30<br/>
                            percent each year. The growth rate of<br/>
homeschooling in<br/>
                            New York State is approximately 20 percent,<br/>
                            according to New York State Teacher&#39;s Union data.<br/>
<br/>
                            The reasons why so many families homeschool are as<br/>
                            various as the families involved. There are<br/>
                            fundamentalist Christian homeschooling networks<br/>
and<br/>
                            others dedicated to philosophies that lean<br/>
considerably<br/>
                            farther left.<br/>
<br/>
                            BUT WHAT ABOUT GYM?<br/>
                            While it is illegal in New York State for<br/>
school districts<br/>
                            to allow homeschooled students to participate in<br/>
                            interscholastic sports�this is due to a regulation<br/>
                            forbidding &quot;part-time instruction&quot;�the rule<br/>
does not<br/>
                            apply to community sports leagues like Little<br/>
League,<br/>
                            Pop Warner or youth soccer. Certainly, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t apply<br/>
                            to family bike rides, hikes or swim lessons.<br/>
                            Homeschoolers do not seem to find the mandate that<br/>
                            physical education be provided &quot;on a regular<br/>
basis&quot;<br/>
                            overly difficult to fulfill.<br/>
<br/>
                            Proponents of homeschooling say that even the more<br/>
                            esoteric subject areas are no problem. Sheryl<br/>
Samuel, a<br/>
                            Stone Ridge mother who homeschooled her son Seth<br/>
                            throughout his entire educational career, says<br/>
that one<br/>
                            fringe benefit is learning along with your child.<br/>
<br/>
                            &quot;Nothing says that you can&#39;t master algebra at<br/>
                            thirty-five, but if you&#39;d rather not, all you<br/>
need to do is<br/>
                            look around and find mentors. People who love a<br/>
                            subject are often eager to share it, whether<br/>
for money,<br/>
                            for barter�maybe the child comes and does yard<br/>
                            work�or just for the satisfaction of teaching,&quot;<br/>
Samuel<br/>
                            says. Her son went for long walks with a retired<br/>
                            physicist. &quot;They&#39;d kick a soccer ball around<br/>
and talk<br/>
                            about the physics of that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
                            THE SOCIAL SCENE<br/>
                            Samuel believes that although the socialization<br/>
children<br/>
                            receive while being homeschooled may be of a<br/>
different<br/>
                            variety than what takes place on the<br/>
playground, it is not<br/>
                            lacking. &quot;At one point, we started to get so<br/>
involved<br/>
                            with our homeschooling network that we had to<br/>
make a<br/>
                            conscious effort to pull back and take some<br/>
time for<br/>
                            ourselves. It&#39;s really as social or as private<br/>
as you want<br/>
                            it to be,&quot; she says.<br/>
<br/>
                            A &quot;typical&quot; day of homeschooling can contain any<br/>
                            number of ingredients. For example, a trip to<br/>
the store<br/>
                            can turn into a lesson in economics; a daily<br/>
newspaper<br/>
                            can become a lesson in language arts.<br/>
Homeschoolers<br/>
                            stress that not only are lessons all around,<br/>
but children<br/>
                            are, by nature, interested in learning them.<br/>
<br/>
                            THE LOCAL BUREAUCRACY<br/>
                            Dealing with school district personnel can be<br/>
easy or<br/>
                            onerous, depending on the person in charge. Some<br/>
                            school districts have appointed staff who deal<br/>
                            specifically with homeschooling. In other<br/>
places, this<br/>
                            task falls to anyone from the harassed<br/>
secretary to the<br/>
                            school superintendent.<br/>
<br/>
                            School districts are afforded a great deal of<br/>
latitude by<br/>
                            state regulations. They may decide on a case by<br/>
case<br/>
                            basis whether to assist homeschoolers by loaning<br/>
                            textbooks, allowing the use of libraries or<br/>
participation<br/>
                            in clubs and so on. Because some districts have<br/>
liability<br/>
                            and educational-process concerns, homeschoolers<br/>
often<br/>
                            cannot rely on them for much help, a situation<br/>
that has<br/>
                            contributed to the vitality of the networks<br/>
that these<br/>
                            people have formed on their own.<br/>
<br/>
                            THE EVALUATION PROCESS<br/>
                            How do homeschoolers do in life? As with the<br/>
reasons<br/>
                            for homeschooling and the structure used to<br/>
achieve it,<br/>
                            the answers are as varied as the families<br/>
involved. Those<br/>
                            who go on to college have attended schools such as<br/>
                            Antioch, Hampshire, Cornell, Harvard, Cal Poly<br/>
                            Technical and others. Obviously, there are<br/>
                            homeschoolers out there doing something right.<br/>
<br/>
                            But what about doing it wrong? What are the<br/>
pitfalls<br/>
                            that would cause home education to fail?<br/>
<br/>
                            Glenn Nystrup of the Hudson Valley Learning Center<br/>
                            has worked with many homeschoolers as a tutor and<br/>
                            mentor and has seen both highly successful<br/>
situations<br/>
                            and those that don&#39;t work as well. &quot;It can be<br/>
tough for<br/>
                            kids to accept that kind of authority from a<br/>
parent and<br/>
                            tough for them to start thinking of home as<br/>
school,&quot;<br/>
                            Nystrup says. &quot;I&#39;ve seen people start out with<br/>
very good<br/>
                            intentions, run into resistance from the kids<br/>
and just<br/>
                            never build up the momentum they need to<br/>
fulfill their<br/>
                            child&#39;s potential.&quot; He advises seeking<br/>
assistance from<br/>
                            individuals like mentors and tutors or from<br/>
programs like<br/>
                            the E-School�started by Nystrup and partner Bram<br/>
                            Morenis�which offers guidance for homeschooling<br/>
                            families.<br/>
<br/>
                            Clearly, the main requirements for success are<br/>
not a<br/>
                            teaching degree or an independent fortune, but<br/>
                            dedication, enthusiasm and sincere enjoyment of<br/>
your<br/>

&lt;&lt; und an interesting article while he was perusing family.com (a <br/>
 Disney site).  If you go to the front page of family.com, there is a link to <br/>
 an article called &quot;One Mom&#39;s Homeschooling Saga&quot;.&lt;A <br/>
HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://family.go.com/&quot;">http://family.go.com/&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>
 www.family.com&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
 This article really burned me up!  The mom who wrote it homeschooled her <br/>
kids <br/>
 for awhile (school-at-home).  She decided it was high time to get them back <br/>
 in school when they became confident and m &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it didn&#39;t burn me up.  And I thought it was somewhat balanced by the <br/>
article just below it -- also about hsing and a lot more positive.<br/>
<br/>
I think the reason I didn&#39;t get upset is that I think this woman made the <br/>
right choice for herself.  Now, I don&#39;t really think she needed to spend all <br/>
this time and effort coming up with this elaborate justification for and <br/>
rationalization of what seems to work best for her and her family.  But, <br/>
that&#39;s all I took it as.  Not a condemnation of hsing.  Just that it didn&#39;t <br/>
work long-term for her.  Not everyone homeschools until the kids are 18 and <br/>
that&#39;s OK too.  Not everyone is an unschooler and that&#39;s OK too.  <br/>
<br/>
IMO I thought it was more enlightened than I would expect from a big company <br/>
like Disney to include anything about hsing on their site.  These 2 articles <br/>
are just the tip of the iceberg on the different experiences and opinions <br/>
abounding in hsing but they were still more than I was expecting from Disney.<br/>
<br/>
IMO.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; yes I agree that the article is upsetting but check out the following<br/>
 article that was right below it in the same section. It isn&#39;t  bad at all. &gt;&gt;<br/>

You&#39;re right, that one is much better.  I wonder if they have had some <br/>
negative response to the first article, because when I visited the site <br/>
yesterday, the second one wasn&#39;t there.  Perhaps they felt they should <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420456417">I went there last night and read both articles for the first time - maybe if you had read the first article before the second one was posted, you are reading your cache version?  (I don&#39;t really know what that means, but my cyberwise husband told me that once :0)  Try refreshing your browser - it might help.  Or maybe it&#39;s just gone and I have no clue what I&#39;m talking about!!!!!!!!!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read both articles and found them both interesting, but rather bland.  I told dh they were fairly vague, and probably meant for the general population who has not a clue about homeschooling.  The rest of us are so much more familiar with hs/us that I thought it was pretty dull.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree that a homeschooling success story would have been a much better choice.  This lady obviously doesn&#39;t really want to stay home, or hasn&#39;t found a way to do it that makes them happy.  I thought it was sad that she says she likes having the few hours at night together to discuss what they all did in their separate lives.  I want my kids to formulate their ideas and direction based on their own experiences, within our loving and nurturing home, not by what society and the media says.  <br/>
<br/>
They just don&#39;t really understand the freedom you can have if you&#39;re willing to be different- IMHO.<br/>
(it&#39;s lots of fun too - LOL)<br/>

told me about the time I was a toddler and had pneumonia.  The doc was just <br/>
endlessly amused by my energy level during the illness, and told her I had <br/>
running pneumonia.  She said, &quot;Do you mean walking pneumonia?&quot;, and he said, <br/>
&quot;No, evidently she&#39;s immune to that.&quot;<br/>
