Did any of you birders see the movie &quot;Winged Migration&quot;?  It&#39;s <br/>
playing at artsy theaters...and it&#39;s a MUST-SEE for serious birders.  <br/>
I think you can check on-line to see where it&#39;s playing...put the <br/>
words in a google search.  It&#39;s fabulous.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

I heard that and saw the previews at our alternative theatre, but we missed <br/>
it. I&#39;m still bummed.<br/>
