<br/>
Don&#39;t mean to pick on you Rachel....just using this as a jumping off point.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that my kids can do sooooo much stuff that I don&#39;t know<br/>
about.  They are constantly amazing me.  Found out recently the 4yo can<br/>
drive the riding lawn mower without help, the 10yo can trim goat hooves by<br/>
herself, the 8yo can make pancakes and one of the 2yos is able to hold all<br/>
kinds of insects without getting bit or stung.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know these things until the kids took off independently and showed<br/>
me.  If I stayed with what I know they can do, I am holding them back.  I<br/>
prefer to go with what the kids are wondering themselves if they can do,<br/>
being within ear shot if they need help.  I believe that way we all learn<br/>
more.<br/>
