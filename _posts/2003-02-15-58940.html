<div id="ygrps-yiv-710888404">Okay.  I can&#39;t let this subject pass by without saying something.  My Dad <br/>
died 20 years ago on Thanksgiving day.  He was the best father in the world.  <br/>
He had five children, worked full time, yet found time to have an individual <br/>
relationship with each of us.  He was a very good artist, constantly drawing <br/>
our &quot;requests&quot; from cartoon characters to real looking people and animals.  <br/>
Sadly, I don&#39;t have one single example.  I guess I thought he&#39;d be here <br/>
drawing for me forever.  He also liked to make up silly songs and poems, and <br/>
some of these I still remember.  I remember sitting on his lap as he <br/>
patiently taught me to tie flies (for fly fishing).  We&#39;d take long walks in <br/>
the woods and spend quiet afternoons fishing.  He&#39;d read to us at night and <br/>
point out the reindeer tracks on the roof.  He&#39;d take me to work and show me <br/>
how the lin-o-type presses operated and was proud that I could read upside <br/>
down and backwards, too.  He apologized when he was wrong.  He was my taxi <br/>
service until I was old enough to get my own car, which he helped me pick <br/>
out.  He loved my kids for the few short years he knew them.  He never met my <br/>
youngest, his namesake.  Just a few years ago my sisters and I were <br/>
reminiscing, and I told my secret:  I always felt that I was his favorite.  <br/>
They admitted that each of them thought that THEY were his favorite.  I think <br/>
that it&#39;s remarkable that he could enjoy each of his children so much, and <br/>
lovingly show that, so that without the words, we still each believed we were <br/>
his favorite.  I try to be the best mother I can, because I had the best <br/>
father.<br/>
