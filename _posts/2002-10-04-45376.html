<div id="ygrps-yiv-409289411">Hi Pam,<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;d just like to say that if your daughter is really into horses she should <br/>
do anything and everything with them. I know 4H is really into doing a lot <br/>
with the horses. I never did it but I had a girlfriend who was in it when we <br/>
were younger and it was quite and exciting time for us. Everything is about <br/>
horses! Of course that&#39;s the way I like things. I never got into the showing <br/>
part but I have worked with horses one way or another all my adult life and <br/>
it has been great. Now I am a licensed Harness horse trainer after working my <br/>
way up through the ranks. If your daughter really wants to work with horses <br/>
then through 4H I think she would get a good idea of the work involved with <br/>
horses. Nobody in my family had or worked around horses so I just took the <br/>
leap and got into it one way or another. It has just been the best time. Now <br/>
I own a race horse and my 2 son&#39;s go to the farm every morning with me and my <br/>
8 year old has started to learn to jog the horses. It&#39;s not an easy life but <br/>
when you love something it makes it all the better. I also want to say that I <br/>
learned everything about horses and got my license all without school. In <br/>
fact I could have done it sooner if I hadn&#39;t been in school.<br/>
Just my 2 cents. When somebody talks horses I like to jump in.<br/>
