When he&#39;s grown, just think how much candy he&#39;ll feel justified in eating if <br/>
he repairs a dishwasher, or puts away ALL the dishes and washes all the pans, <br/>
or what if he were to pour concrete in the yard or plant trees!?  He would <br/>
earn POUNDS of candy.<br/>
<br/>
(I say this because I have that mentality, deep down, that if I&#39;m good I can <br/>
have candy, and THAT is not healthy.)<br/>

I was at a workshop where we were looking at different developmental stages, <br/>
and the good and bad things about them. When we got to Adult, everyone <br/>
brainstormed a long list of the disadvantages quickly, and were VERY slow to come up <br/>
with positives.<br/>
<br/>
Then we came up with two: Sex, and we can have candy whenever we want.<br/>
<br/>
We agreed that made it worth it.<br/>
