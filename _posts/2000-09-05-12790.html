&gt; What saints all these politicians are (LOL)... By rights we all out<br/>
&gt; to be Libertarians as they are only party that believes in<br/>
&gt; homeschooling/unschooling letting parents take care of their kids<br/>
&gt; education without intervention from the goverment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this hasn&#39;t started another flame war on politics because if it<br/>
&gt; does I&#39;m out this time... I&#39;ll just watch (LOL)<br/>
