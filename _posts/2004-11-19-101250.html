<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712392547">The kids and I did this survey today.  I loved some of their answers: <br/>
Hannah picked math as her easiest subject, Hayden answered video games <br/>
&lt;bg&gt;; for the &quot;waste of time&quot; question, both responded they don&#39;t DO <br/>
anything that is a waste of time &lt;vbg&gt;  Today, Hayden, 6,  reports <br/>
himself in 9th grade.  I hope she at least enjoys a different set of <br/>
answers than what she&#39;s expecting :)  ~diana<br/>
