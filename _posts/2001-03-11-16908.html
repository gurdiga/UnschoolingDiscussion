 </span></blockquote>You can write to owners and moderators by appending -owner to a group&#39;s<br/>
address.<br/>
<br/>
So to write to the owners and moderators of this group you&#39;d send an email<br/>
to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion-owner@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
so I&#39;m guessing the address would be:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-Resources-owner@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-Resources-owner@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
