&lt;&lt; It seems to me that, in our case, my intervention was allowing his <br/>
behavior <br/>
 to continue.  I supported it in some strange way... or maybe he&#39;d just <br/>
 coincidentally reached the point where he was ready to deal with his <br/>
 frustration in a more mature manner. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is so true for us also.<br/>
I was just SURE that the anger and frustration my son displayed was his <br/>
unique personality and the only way to help him was limit his time on the <br/>
games/tv.<br/>
Funny, but since lifting all restrictions I haven&#39;t seen this behavior.<br/>
When he gets frustrated with the game, he might cuss a little (damn, damn, <br/>
damn!!! mutterings from the room) then he&#39;ll walk out and vent a little, <br/>
telling me why the game is stupid. Usually he eats a snack, does some other <br/>
stuff, maybe gets online to find some information he needs about the game and <br/>
then goes back to it.<br/>
He&#39;s learned how to handle it his own way.<br/>
That never could have happened if I&#39;d kept interfering in his choices.<br/>
