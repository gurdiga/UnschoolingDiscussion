  My daughter, who is also 9 mos, is not very interested in solids either.  <br/>
She nurses very often, and will eat some baby foods- mostly applesauce and <br/>
bananas, but that&#39;s about it.  She&#39;s not crazy about cereals, but does like <br/>
dry cheerios.  When the time is right, she will be ready, so I am not trying <br/>

comforting to her to nurse, and that&#39;s ok with me.  ~Karen</div>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you could suggest The Family Nutrition Book by Sears or even The Baby Book by Sears to this mother. I think he&#39;s fairly nonthreatening to mainstreamers and has great nutrional advice. I haven&#39;t read this chapter yet, but a friend said the chapter on formula is excellent because he never directly says formula is horrible, but you end up thinking that anyway.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incredibly frustrating, though, when you know how much better it is for the child to take things slow and let them get to solids at their own pace rather than what the baby books tell you to do.<br>

formula, totally non-threatening, but as he says, it&#39;s not what we <br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess there&#39;s only so much we can do, huh? I suppose we&#39;ll just have to let other people make their own decisions. The positive part is that this woman has breastfed that long and both her and the baby have received so many benefits from that already.<br>
