Home-schoolers find vindication in contests<br/>

<br/>
Last year, home-schoolers startled the educational establishment when<br/>
they swept the top three places<br/>
in the prestigious Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee, nailing words<br/>
such as &quot;phrontistery&quot; and<br/>
&quot;sphingine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just a week earlier, home-schoolers took four of the top 10 spots at the<br/>
national geography bee.<br/>
<br/>
This month, students who are taught at home -- just 2 percent of all<br/>
school-age children -- will again<br/>
make up more than 10 percent of the national spelling bee&#39;s participants<br/>
and an even higher proportion<br/>
at the National Geographic Bee, sponsored by the National Geographic<br/>
Society.<br/>
<br/>
Their success is no accident. Parents who home-school, often on the<br/>
defensive about the quality of<br/>
education they provide, are looking to these contests for vindication.<br/>
<br/>
Some are spending thousands of dollars on specialized dictionaries,<br/>
atlases and computer programs,<br/>
and untold hours training their children for these high-profile proving<br/>
grounds.<br/>
<br/>
Critics argue that teaching to compete successfully in bees is more<br/>
about gamesmanship than lasting<br/>
educational achievement. But in a climate that puts a premium on the<br/>
results of standardized tests, the<br/>
bees give home-schoolers their own flashy scorecards to show the rest of<br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Clearly it makes a point that home-schooled parents can do the job,&quot;<br/>
said Richard Jefferson,<br/>
spokesman for the Home School Legal Defense Association. &quot;For years,<br/>
people were not convinced that<br/>
home-schoolers were really up to the job of teaching our own children.<br/>
So we&#39;ve had to fight extensively<br/>
in the public arena just to make sure people understood that we can do<br/>
it. If another school system<br/>
produced winners, what would they say? They would say, &#39;See our school<br/>
system works.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Home-schoolers in the Chicago area have four of their own spelling bees,<br/>
whose winners go on to<br/>
compete with schoolchildren in higher rounds. The geography bees have a<br/>
similar structure.<br/>
<br/>
Mom starts a bee<br/>
<br/>
Laura Yates of Antioch started a home-school spelling bee in Lake County<br/>
after hearing about a<br/>
home-schooler winning the national competition in 1997. For her, it was<br/>
a way to offer her children<br/>
academic competition.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, she has amassed a library of books on word stems and<br/>
etymology and thick dictionaries to<br/>
help find difficult terms. She has fed her kids&#39; appetite for new words<br/>
by visiting bees at neighboring<br/>
schools and purchasing word games on compact disc or tapes with strange<br/>
pronunciations of equally<br/>
curious-looking terms found in the Scripps Howard paideia, the spellers&#39;<br/>
bible of 3,600 words.<br/>
<br/>
Along with math on the living room couch, science at the lake in their<br/>
back yard and gym on a neighbor&#39;s<br/>
trampoline, the Yates children have spent five to eight hours a day<br/>
learning to decipher obscure<br/>
spellings.<br/>
<br/>
Lindsey, 15, qualified for the nationals last year, finishing 118th.<br/>
Elliott, 13, came in third at the Chicago<br/>
Tribune&#39;s suburban spelling bee in March. They both attribute it to<br/>
home-schooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It gives you so much freedom,&quot; Lindsey said. &quot;If I was in school, I<br/>
don&#39;t know how I&#39;d study for it because<br/>
I&#39;d be so worn out with homework and sports. It allows me to focus in on<br/>
something I enjoy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Linda Bolt, of South Bend, Ind., has created flash cards and stuck word<br/>
lists on windows and mirrors<br/>
throughout the house to help her son, Erik, 13, study for the spelling<br/>
bee. She entered him in the<br/>
geography bee after learning about a home-schooler winning it in 1999<br/>
and reading about the bees in a<br/>
home-schooling magazine.<br/>
<br/>
This year, the national geography bee, with a $25,000 scholarship at<br/>
stake, will be held in Washington,<br/>
D.C. Tuesday and May 23. The national spelling bee, with its $10,000<br/>
prize, will be held May 29 through<br/>
31.<br/>
<br/>
Home-schoolers reached the nationals of the spelling bee for the first<br/>
time in 1992, and 27 did it last<br/>
year. This year, 25 of the 248 competitors are home-schooled. The<br/>
geography bee started seeing<br/>
similar trends in the mid-1990s. A record eight home-schoolers are among<br/>
55 eligible contestants this<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Image-conscious<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, the Home School Legal Defense Association has helped<br/>
improve the public&#39;s image of<br/>
an estimated 1.2 million home-schoolers across the nation by emphasizing<br/>
high standardized test<br/>
scores. A 1998 study commissioned by the association showed that<br/>
children taught at home typically<br/>
score between the 70th and 80th percentiles in national tests.<br/>
<br/>
The association also highlights the bee results, which Penny Beihl of<br/>
Saluda, S.C. -- a former private<br/>
elementary school teacher -- believes are important to changing public<br/>
perception.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll be checking out of a store and people will ask the kids, &#39;Where do<br/>
you go to school? And they find out<br/>
and say, &#39;How do you know they&#39;re learning anything?&#39;&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
Beihl grills her sons daily on world facts and has compiled a<br/>
geography-version of the &quot;20 Questions&quot;<br/>
game for the dinner table. Her son, David, 15, won the national<br/>
geography bee in 1999, and now her<br/>
second son, Tommy, 13, will be in the national spelling and geography<br/>
bees this year.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think obviously they must be learning something,&quot; Beihl said. &quot;This<br/>
is my job. If my (son) wants to do it,<br/>
I&#39;m going to help him achieve it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A little Greek, Latin<br/>
<br/>
The kids often drive the process. George Thampy of suburban St. Louis,<br/>
the 2000 spelling bee champ,<br/>
developed his own list of 3,000 words from dictionaries and via Internet<br/>
Web sites. He dabbled in a little<br/>
Greek and Latin.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-year-old also came in second in the geography bee last year. This<br/>
year, his sister, Mallika, 12,<br/>
will be in the national spelling bee.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think one of the obvious benefits of a home-school education versus<br/>
any other trend is you can focus<br/>
on specific needs and interests in your education,&quot; said Paige Kimble,<br/>
director of the Scripps Howard<br/>
National Spelling Bee. &quot;Children in other types of schooling follow a<br/>
set program regardless of whether<br/>
they are interested or need that program.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Public educators don&#39;t think the bee victories mean much.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think they can prove that home-schooling is a viable alternative<br/>
without using that as an example,&quot; said<br/>
Paul Houston, executive director of the American Association of School<br/>
Administrators. &quot;If I was in<br/>
the home-schooling movement, I&#39;d say, is that the way you want kids to<br/>
spend their time, sitting around<br/>
all day and memorizing lists of spelling words or facts.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education is not &#39;The Weakest Link&#39; or &#39;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.&#39;<br/>
You&#39;re not an educated<br/>
person because you can memorize pages of esoteric words. That&#39;s why you<br/>
have spell check on<br/>
your computer.&quot; Jefferson dismisses the criticism. &quot;What is wrong with<br/>
memorizing?&quot; he said. &quot;How<br/>
else do we learn Spanish or another foreign language? How else do I know<br/>
how to drive? Memorizing,<br/>
we all do it.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
What I like about this editorial is that the ps doesnt think too much about the<br/>
bee victories, but they sure put focus on those darn report cards & tests huh?<br/>
And he certainly does not know what the hs teaching is really about or how it<br/>
works. Let them say that hs is full of overachievers! I hope my dd&#39;s to be in<br/>
that same category soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546056289">It&#39;s amazing how we are &quot;damned if we do, damned if we don&#39;t&quot;. <br/>
Why do you want to homeschool?  Your children will not be able to<br/>
&quot;socialize&quot; with other children?  They will be so far behind.<br/>
Later that decade....<br/>
Why do you want your children to enter contest that usually ps school kids<br/>
enter?  Do you want them to socialize with ps kids and prove that<br/>
homeschooling creates a positive learning environment?  <br/>
We will never please the masses - then again who wants to?<br/>
God forbid we should want our children to do well.<br/>
The statement about memorization doesn&#39;t mean your a &#39;well rounded educated<br/>
person&#39;, then why do the ps force students to memorize spelling list?  Ahh -<br/>
could it be that people are losing faith in the ps system and this scares<br/>
the educational system?  Is it only ps kids that win  the contest that are<br/>
&#39;well-rounded educated people&#39;?  I don&#39;t think so - sounds like a double<br/>
standard to me.<br/>
