&gt; <br/>
&gt; JJ, I am curious - what makes an unschooler hate math?  Lisa H.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       Good question! I&#39;d have to say it was the unschooling exception I <br/>
tried to make of it. <br/>
<br/>
       She is our first-born, and I am a recovering public school <br/>
professional &lt;grin&gt; so I pushed some arithmetic workbooks on her at one point, afraid she <br/>
was really &quot;behind&quot; in that one area. That, and some ill-fated music lessons <br/>
-- piano and violin -- when counting out the note values interfered with her <br/>
interest in the exquisite sounds she wanted to make. The counting and numbers <br/>
got in her way rather than helping her, so she resented them and the attention <br/>
grown-ups kept insisting she pay to them.<br/>
<br/>
       I really thought it was the opposite, that the numbers would help her <br/>
do what she wanted to do. Which is true, but it just doesn&#39;t matter if what <br/>
she learns is to avoid and dislike anything that looks like &quot;math.&quot; So I did <br/>
some wrong things for right reasons, things I dearly wish I could take back!<br/>
<br/>
       Having said that, I do think different individuals have different <br/>
affinities, things they&#39;re drawn to and things that don&#39;t resonate so easily with <br/>
their own intelligences and perceptions. My daughter was never going to love <br/>
numbers like my son does, or like she loves books and the arts, whether I <br/>
pushed or not. But you asked about the &quot;phobic&quot; nature of her reaction to math, and <br/>
I do think I contributed to that.<br/>
<br/>
       Fortunately, at long last, we seem to be finding small unschooling <br/>
opportunities for her to begin reconsidering this. So that&#39;s my answer as an <br/>
unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
       But as a professional educator and analyst, I just read something <br/>
about desensitizing people with real phobias, some scientific evidence suggesting <br/>
that one massive exposure to arouse maximum fear was a faster, more effective <br/>
way to extinguish a phobic response than the traditional therapy of gradually <br/>
introducing small, well-tolerated doses of the fear factor over time. I was <br/>
picturing not learning math but spiders and cliffs at the time, and thought it <br/>
sounded so horrible that I personally would rather live with the phobia. But as <br/>
a scientific question ONLY -- I wonder how that would fit with whatever we <br/>
did with arithmetic workbooks (was that math as an aggravating allergen, or a <br/>
desensitizing dose at that point? If I had made a whole week of math misery, <br/>
like the way John Rosemond recommends toilet training, would that have had the <br/>
same effect as overcoming response through a massive does? Et cetera.)<br/>
<br/>
       I don&#39;t know those answers, and barely can even think of reasonable <br/>
questions to frame! But I find thinking about it all is irresistible, and I&#39;m <br/>
beginning to see that same tendency in DD.  <br/>
<br/>
       So although it may happen much later than had I handled things <br/>
differently, I now predict (with secret delight) she will seize math by the throat <br/>
and demand that it help her do this!  JJ<br/>

Me, too!  Honestly, it sounds like it would create far more phobias than <br/>
it cures.<br/>

What makes it true if it didn&#39;t work though?<br/>

<br/>
Schools make years of math misery and it doesn&#39;t seem to do anything but shut <br/>
people down more, some to the point that they can be 40 years old and afraid <br/>
of their own checkbooks because it &quot;looks like math.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
School tells kids their own ideas are wrong.  Math teachers are infamous for <br/>
giving zero points if the work wasn&#39;t written out to their specifications.  <br/>
Finding the answer by other means is *wrong* and not acknowledged as legitimate <br/>
or useful in any way.  It&#39;s called harmful.  Not subtly.  Overtly.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not making it an unschooling anything, is it?  I think I know what you <br/>
meant, but what you seem to have done was to &quot;school it.&quot;  I don&#39;t think that <br/>
was an unschooling exception.  It was a not-at-all unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the kinds of damaging that schools do can be done at home.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Holly are both clearly mathematically minded.  They will start <br/>
speaking of patterns and liklihoods when others in the room are wholly in <br/>
linguistic mode, with analogies at most, and more likely in flowery or emotional <br/>
descriptions.  I think it&#39;s cool.  It&#39;s not about numbers, though.  It&#39;s not that <br/>
they&#39;re thinking in numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Numbers come on their own.  Math can too, if the parts of the brain where it <br/>
works haven&#39;t been loaded with numbers and math terminology that they might <br/>
want to use someday.  They need room inside to do cartwheels and they&#39;ll fill in <br/>
the numbers in their own way later.<br/>

just wrote down the correct answer without putting an &quot;equals&quot; sign in <br/>
front of it in a complete math sentence. What I mean is that she just <br/>
wrote the answer &quot;4&quot; instead of writing out &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot; and the teacher <br/>
marked off points every time, even though the answer was correct.<br/>
<br/>
Her answer, when Roya asks her to explain something, is to say, &quot;That <br/>
is the way we do it in this class.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277649502">JJ.  Thanks so much for your response to the &quot;math&quot; question.  I shared your original post and this reply with my husband.  It was a great opportunity to support what i&#39;ve been doing and for him to see other&#39;s who have had similar struggles as our own.   In response to his anxiety at times throughout the years I have succumbed to non-unschooling moments setting aside time for &quot;learning activities&quot; specifically math and reading based on his requirements not my dd&#39;s requests or interest.  Due to the absurdity of this approach - inevitably and fortunately these moments don&#39;t last long...  My dd defines herself as one who loves numbers but hates math &lt;lol&gt;.  <br/>
