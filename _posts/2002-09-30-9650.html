<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842574772">A friend recently took her son to a doctor for a itchy red rash and sinus<br/>
thing.  She homeschools, and when she went to the rest room, while the<br/>
doctor had her son alone he asked several questions.  = have you ever<br/>
thought you&#39;d like to go to school like other kids =  do you have<br/>
brothers and sisters at home or is it just you and your mom =  are you<br/>
alone with your mom all day =.   She didn&#39;t know about it until after,<br/>
when in the course of conversation her son mentioned these questions and<br/>
wondered why the doctor would be writing something down...<br/>
<br/>
It made me mad, and I saw conspiracy everywhere, but she seemed cool<br/>
about it at first.  Now she&#39;s wondering though, if this thing gets asked<br/>
of all homeschooler or was it just her,or what?  <br/>
Anyone ever hear of this?  Have I been watching too many movies?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113012298">what were the child&#39;s answers?<br/>
<br/>
yes, i would be concerned about a doctor who asked questions like this <br/>
without my knowledge and i would call the doctor and ask them about <br/>
those questions.  then i would find a different one.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s common for family physicians to ask personal questions about family <br/>
relations and personal happiness.  It can affect health.<br/>
<br/>
When kids are in school they ask the kids if they&#39;re liking school and <br/>
whether they get along with the other kids okay.  It&#39;s part of a profile they <br/>
want to have to understand people&#39;s attitudes and &quot;posture&quot; (not physical, <br/>
but facial, and responses).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if specialists would ask unless it was something they thought <br/>
could be stress related.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498243822">i think it&#39;s creepy too.  we have the same ped nurse pract that we&#39;ve <br/>
had since lexie was a few months old.  i saw her lead doc and hated him. <br/>
 he did not trust that i knew that there was something wrong with <br/>
lexie&#39;s eyes when there was, and i should have been more assertive.  but <br/>
anyway, the kids nurse pract is great.  she does do developmental stuff, <br/>
but she sort of chuckles when she does them with my girls.  like at <br/>
janene&#39;s 2 year appt she had her draw a line and a circle and a few <br/>
other things.  i think it&#39;s good she&#39;s keeping an eye on the <br/>
developmental stuff.  but it&#39;s very casual how she does it.  she also <br/>
has asked lexie if she likes homeschooling, and what types of things <br/>
she&#39;s working on but again, very casual and it&#39;s more because she&#39;s <br/>
interested and enjoys talking with lexie.<br/>
<br/>
we did have one doc who we saw twice in the same day when janene cut her <br/>
finger badly and the original glueing didn&#39;t stick.  the doc just <br/>
couldn&#39;t figure homeschoolingout.  lexie was trying to help.  he was <br/>
thinking that the kids are never around other kids.  lexie finally said <br/>
something like... &#39;don&#39;t you get it, we are never at home, my dad drives <br/>
us everywhere, we go have a good time with lots of other kids goign to <br/>
museums and the zoo and the park and we learn things in the world as <br/>
they should be learned, not in some closed up classroom!&#39;  i was <br/>
confused because how could he have a conversation with these two girls <br/>
and not know that they are well socialized.  <br/>
<br/>
but anyway, i do think the doc&#39;s questions were creepy and i&#39;m glad your <br/>
friend found another doc.<br/>

because of the notorious cases like the woman in Texas who drowned all her<br/>

homeschooling was the very best for academics.  (we didn&#39;t mention<br/>
unschooling then &lt;g&gt;)  I&#39;d assure him we got out of the house often enough<br/>

It seems that doctors have been more pro-active in the last several<br/>
years trying to find out if women are being abused by their partners. <br/>
There are likely to be similar efforts made to sniff out various forms<br/>
of child abuse and neglect.  I kind of have the impression that the<br/>
American Pediatrics Association, or some similar group, sent out a memo<br/>
(or whatever it would be) suggesting that doctors check that<br/>
homeschooled kids aren&#39;t being locked in closets and raised by wolves.  <br/>
(But I&#39;m really guessing.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506087300">My dd got asked some questions, but in a way any schooled child might as<br/>
well, and I was present.<br/>
<br/>
My son goes to a specialist weekly (he&#39;s 4).  The doctors haven&#39;t<br/>
questioned, but the child-life specialist has, but mostly from a curiosity<br/>
point of view, not threatening.  The meds my son is taking *may* cause some<br/>
learning disabilities, though from what I gather those are mostly<br/>
school-related problems, not learning from life problems (and ds hasn&#39;t<br/>
shown any signs of this).<br/>
