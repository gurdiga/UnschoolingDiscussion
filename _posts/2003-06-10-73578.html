Try a little at a time. They hate the smell when it comes out the other end. <br/>
Meat Tenderizer is fairly strong so just a little you wont need much, if it <br/>
doesn&#39;t work add a little more. Yes, it works on dry food and most dogs will eat <br/>
it going in. If that doesn&#39;t work I think there is something else you can try <br/>
it just slips my mind at the moment.<br/>

<br/>
I know of them too. I was trying to save myself the spending and sending<br/>
away for them. I&#39;ve only seen it in catalogs and not the stores. I hate<br/>
buying things I can&#39;t go and get right when I need them. I&#39;ll have to check<br/>
Petsmart again.<br/>
<br/>
Thank guys,<br/>
