<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Last night I was at a meeting for our unschooling resource center, and this <br/>
&gt; one dad said something that I just loved and agree with so much. . . that <br/>
&gt; young folks (and people in general) are just learning machines and if we <br/>
&gt; just <br/>
&gt; get out of their way they will learn what they need. Sometimes it may take <br/>
&gt; us <br/>
&gt; a lifetime to really &quot;get&quot; that, but it is so true.<br/>
