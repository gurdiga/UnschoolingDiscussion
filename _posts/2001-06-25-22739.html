<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595398521">I have just changed my i.d. from donMoreau to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:laura90713@...">laura90713@...</a>  I <br/>
would like to thank everyone who replied to an early May post.  For <br/>
some reason I couldn&#39;t get back on, so I just signed up again.  <br/>
<br/>
I have read a couple of times about kids going to public school part-<br/>
time.  How did they accomplish this?  I just can&#39;t imagine our school <br/>
district approving this.  Does anyone have some really good strategy <br/>
for this?  Also, one of my daughter&#39;s thinks she may want to return <br/>
to school, but I would need to &quot;dummy up&quot; a course of study with <br/>
grades.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughters also joined Pop-Warner Cheer.  They want a report card <br/>
for their records.  I told them we don&#39;t do grades. Of course this <br/>
totally confused them.  They were like, &quot;Well just bring the grades <br/>
you have to show to whoever you report to.&quot;  They don&#39;t get it.  I <br/>
told them I would copy my R-4 that I turned into the state.  I think <br/>
I just might make a fake report card and give it to them.  Maybe it <br/>
would just be easier than explaining it all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad to be back on this list.  <br/>

We do Pop-Warner soccer, did one year of<br/>
tee-ball.....have never been asked for a report card,<br/>
just birth cetrificate copy. And lots of money.  Older<br/>
boys did baseball, soccer, and one was a paid<br/>
referee......no report cards were ever asked for. I<br/>
did sit and watch all of the practices and games.  I<br/>
was often the ONLY parent at practice. Coaches<br/>
couldn&#39;t confuse the kids with odd questions and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501007534">I have this funny feeling that they will have their practices at <br/>
different locations.  I hope not.  During the month of August, <br/>
nicknamed &quot;hell month&quot;, they will practice for 2 to 2 1/2 hours <br/>
Monday - Friday.  Then it will calm down a bit for September (thank <br/>
goodness) and their practice will be 2 or 3 times a week for 2 hours <br/>
with a game on Saturday.  So far it has cost us around $800.00 for <br/>
all three girls to do this!!!!!  I told them they will have to sell <br/>
the candy bars for their fund-raiser because I will not shell out <br/>
another $100 to buy-out for each team.  I hope they have a good time <br/>
doing this for what it is costing us. <br/>

Yes, the children ARE glad when Mama (especially)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411411194">Dear Laura........sure do hope they get a lot out of<br/>
it too! Those &quot;so-far&quot; bucks didn&#39;t include gas,<br/>
eat-out meals, and all of the other &quot;little&quot; stuff<br/>
that adds up...and the yet to come expenses!  Maybe<br/>
they will all become disillusioned at the same time,<br/>
too.  <br/>
<br/>
Gosh, an unschooling cheerleading Mama.  Will you have<br/>
to do committee stuff with the other cheerleader<br/>
Mama&#39;s? Post game parties and such?  The whole thing<br/>
sounds like an extended &quot;hell month&quot;.  Too bad they<br/>
didn&#39;t all decide to be seamstresses or babysitters or<br/>
carpenters are gardeners or pastry chefs or puppeteers<br/>
<br/>
Is the littlest one a girl, too?<br/>
<br/>
Mucho sympathy.<br/>

&gt; nicknamed &quot;hell month&quot;, they will practice for 2 to<br/>
&gt; 2 1/2 hours <br/>
&gt; Monday - Friday.  Then it will calm down a bit for<br/>
&gt; September (thank <br/>
&gt; goodness) and their practice will be 2 or 3 times a<br/>
&gt; week for 2 hours <br/>
&gt; with a game on Saturday.  So far it has cost us<br/>
&gt; around $800.00 for <br/>
&gt; all three girls to do this!!!!!  I told them they<br/>
&gt; will have to sell <br/>
&gt; the candy bars for their fund-raiser because I will<br/>
&gt; not shell out <br/>
&gt; another $100 to buy-out for each team.  I hope they<br/>
&gt; have a good time <br/>
&gt; doing this for what it is costing us. <br/>
