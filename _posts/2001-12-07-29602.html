<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007614236">Speaking of geography, a neat way to do U.S. geography and history is, (big<br/>
pause &lt;g&gt;) Sunset Magazine!  About two or three years ago, the reason for<br/>
which I don&#39;t remember, the kidlets &quot;discovered&quot; those pull out cards in<br/>
Sunset that say they will send you free info on dozens of things, just mark<br/>
the box.<br/>
<br/>
Well, they did, then they found another one in some other magazine and then<br/>
they were off and running in the magazine racks at the stores.<br/>
<br/>
They got maps, BIG neat magazines, free offers, gifts and all kinds of<br/>
goodies from almost all of the states, Canada, QEII, etc.<br/>
<br/>
They had a ball watching the mail everyday and then they just about wore the<br/>
ink off reading their magazines and then comparing the things in different<br/>
states.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We have been homeschooling for a year (officially but actually her whole<br/>
life<br/>
&gt; &gt; LOL).  My Daughter is almost 8 and very bored.  We have been doing<br/>
workbooks<br/>
&gt; &gt; and she reads A LOT but only likes Babysitter Club books mostly.  She is<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; &gt; EXCELLENT reader.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How about reading *to* her. Listen to books on tape. Watch movies that<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; been made from books.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And then don&#39;t worry about what she reads. When you think about it, how<br/>
&gt; would you feel if you read romance novels for relaxation and your husband<br/>
&gt; looked at it with disapproval because he felt you should be reading more<br/>
&gt; important books?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is she drawn to books and TV shows and movies about people (as opposed to<br/>
&gt; animals or fantasy)? She probably has a high interpersonal intelligence.<br/>
And<br/>
&gt; she&#39;ll learn best by helping her explore people. There have been lots of<br/>
&gt; good book series recommended. Try some out to see if she&#39;s interested. She<br/>
&gt; may not want to read them herself, but she might enjoy having them read to<br/>
&gt; her. By learning about the people of the past then she&#39;ll absorb history<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; she&#39;ll be interested in the factoids of history to flesh out the times her<br/>
&gt; favorite characters lived in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, she doesn&#39;t know many Geography, History, etc facts.  How does she<br/>
learn<br/>
&gt; &gt; these if she has no interest?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By living life. By *needing* the information for *herself*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By making sure she has *access* to fun ways to learn them. And, very<br/>
&gt; importantly, by *not* seeing those as necessary for her to learn geography<br/>
&gt; and history. She should encounter these things in a multitude of ways,<br/>
&gt; primarily in context. A chapter on the geography and history of Japan and<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s imports and exports is just facts that look impressive if quizzed on.<br/>
&gt; But if she hasn&#39;t found a reason to know about Japan, the information is<br/>
&gt; just taking up valuable brain space. *But* if she gets intrigued by<br/>
Pokemon,<br/>
&gt; and sees the Pokemon names written in Japanese and gets intrigued by the<br/>
&gt; cultural references and listens to folk tales from Japan then where Japan<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; on the map and the Shogun/Emperor rulership of Japan become more<br/>
interesting<br/>
&gt; and useful bits of information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Strew her path with reasons for knowing about these things. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; to pick up all that you strew. It just needs to be there so she has access<br/>
&gt; to new interests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Or the multipication tables?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still have gaps in my multiplication tables and I managed to get through<br/>
&gt; engineering school ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Because of the way schools teach math and the schools&#39; need to have<br/>
&gt; documentation that the kids are progressing, schools need to teach in<br/>
*very*<br/>
&gt; different ways than kids naturally learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The most important thing you can help you daughter get is an understanding<br/>
&gt; of how numbers work. And the way she can get that is by *using* math as a<br/>
&gt; tool. Games. (If she needs help, help her. You don&#39;t want her to avoid an<br/>
&gt; opportunity to use math because she wants to avoid being quizzed on<br/>
&gt; arithmetic!) Allowance (and figuring out how much longer until she can<br/>
&gt; afford something.) Avoid pencil and paper math for now. It is *very*<br/>
&gt; abstract. Do it in your heads,that way you&#39;re forced to tear the problems<br/>
&gt; apart to make them as simple as possible. And by tearing the numbers apart<br/>
&gt; and putting them together in new ways she&#39;ll learn how numbers work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But *don&#39;t* see these as lessons she must do in order to learn. They&#39;re<br/>
&gt; *opportunities* for her *if* she finds the question intriguing. Lots of<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; she won&#39;t. That&#39;s okay. There&#39;s a whole world of other opportunities that<br/>
&gt; *will* tie into what she&#39;s drawn in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Specific things to do would be wonderful, I have NO imagination at all<br/>
on what<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do besides book work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps what might help the most is *you* getting interested in things.<br/>
Take<br/>
&gt; some time to explore hobbies and things that interest you. (Yes, easier<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; than done with 5 kids! But if you&#39;re modeling that life is all about<br/>
&gt; maintenance rather than joyful living, then that&#39;s the lesson they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; learn!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stop and wonder about things. Rather than seeing a web in the corner and<br/>
&gt; wondering where the broom is, wonder why the spider built it at that<br/>
&gt; particular location. And what do they eat in the winter? Watch a pot begin<br/>
&gt; to boil and notice what really happens. Call any kids who want to watch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Get some videos about something that you&#39;ve always wanted to know about<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; watch them *for yourself*. Find out something new just for the heck of it.<br/>
&gt; Let it lead to something else new. If we aren&#39;t learning for the sake of<br/>
&gt; learning, then is it fair to expect our kids to?<br/>
