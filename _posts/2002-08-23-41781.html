Please think about the literal meanings of those things, and also of the <br/>

thinking, but I don&#39;t think any loving parent should use, or even think, <br/>
about a child.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Casey and her friend got into a little tiff this afternoon. Nothing serious <br/>
and I knew they just needed a little space and time and they&#39;d then be able <br/>
to work it out. When I brought the friend home and explained that Niki might <br/>
still be a little upset, the babysitter said &quot;Was she being a brat? I&#39;m <br/>
sorry. She can really be a brat sometimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ugh. Oof. And OMG!<br/>
<br/>
I felt like *I* got punched in the stomach. Niki is just the sweetest little <br/>
munchkin in the world. How anyone could call that wonderful little person a <br/>
brat is beyond me. And FWIW, she&#39;s never even said a cross word at my house. <br/>
Much to her mom&#39;s (but not my) surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Niki and Casey worked it out by dinnertime BTW. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
