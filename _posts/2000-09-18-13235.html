 </span></blockquote>Dunno about writing the stuff in oneself, but I&#39;m really enjoying the <br/>
official site, www.olympics.com (snappy, isn&#39;t it?? LOL) tons of <br/>
info, a bit slow but then half the online world&#39;s probably trying to log <br/>
on at the same time.  Each sport has it&#39;s own medal table, us Brits <br/>
are doing particularly well in the track cycling, woohoo!  pd good <br/>
considering we only got one gold in the whole Atlanta games, and <br/>
that was the absolute put-your-shirt-on rowing of Redgrave and <br/>
Pinsent.  If Steve Redgrave doesn&#39;t get the BBC&#39;s Sports <br/>
Personality of the year this year, the sky will fall down!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent too much time surfing and watching, and it&#39;s on from <br/>
about midnight here so I really need to go to bed earlier (as per <br/>
usual, though)  Went to the chiro today, and she&#39;s from Sydney!  <br/>
She said she was feeling homesick, so I asked her what she&#39;s still <br/>
doing here!!  Ah, well, can&#39;t complain that someone who loves her <br/>
home town so much is happy to live in Yorkshire *grin*<br/>

so that you could make up your own chart on the computer?<br/>
