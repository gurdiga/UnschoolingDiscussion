<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095410916">this summer we are going to drive from our house in VA out to Phoenix <br/>
AZ to visit inlaws  and then out to California and back home by way of <br/>

I thought some of you might have some ideas for places to visit along <br/>
the way.  Our kids are young and they have requested a stop at Lego <br/>

I bought one of those National Park Passport Books when I worked at one of<br/>
the parks years ago and I enjoy filling it with the stamps from all the<br/>
sights I&#39;ve seen over the years.<br/>

had multiple car breakdowns and only made it to albuquerque before our <br/>
car blew up and i had to take a bus back home.  it was a great trip <br/>

we saw some indian dwellings.  really cool place but i have never <br/>

you&#39;re planning on I-15 & I-70?<br/>
<br/>
This will be out of your way, but just in case...Thanksgiving Point  <br/>
in Lehi, Utah.  The gardens &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thanksgivingpoint.com/visit/">http://www.thanksgivingpoint.com/visit/</a> <br/>

visit/museum_of_ancient_life/about.html&gt; was the best we&#39;ve ever been  <br/>

<br/>
In Colorado on I-70 the Hot springs &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hotspringspool.com/">http://www.hotspringspool.com/</a>&gt;  <br/>
at Glenwood Springs is a fun place to swim.  There&#39;s a cooler pool  <br/>

Gold mine tours and panning, on west of Denver.  &lt;http:// <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963657647">It&#39;s a long way. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m originally from Maryland and I have underestimated some of these <br/>
western states. :)  The county I now live in (Maricopa) in Mesa, <br/>
Arizona is only 600 square miles than the entire state of Maryland. :)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve made lots of trips across the US since my fam is stil in the <br/>
MD/PA area and here are some thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
Check out www.passportamerica.com for a discount membership to RV <br/>
parks as you travel - this works really well for the middle america <br/>
locations and you can look up places on your route to see if it will <br/>
work for you.<br/>
<br/>
I also like rvparkreviews.com to look up campgrounds in locations I&#39;m <br/>
not famillar with.<br/>
<br/>
In California, there&#39;s a nice park (Guajome County Park) in Oceanside, <br/>
California which is near Carlsbad, CA where Legoland is (it&#39;s not in <br/>
San Diego, but about an hour north  of San Diego).  You can also make <br/>
online reservations:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/parks/Camping/guajome.html">http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/parks/Camping/guajome.html</a><br/>
<br/>
In general, don&#39;t forget to check out County Parks as you drive across <br/>
and in California especially they can be very good values.  Cali is <br/>
very expensive compared to the rest of camping in america.<br/>
<br/>
Also in Albuquerque is the National Atomic Museum <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.atomicmuseum.com/)">http://www.atomicmuseum.com/)</a> and the Sandia Tramway  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandiapeak.com/">http://www.sandiapeak.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I use mapquest.com to layout my route and measure distances.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going through Kentucky, hit Cave City and visit Mammoth Cave <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nps.gov/maca/)">http://www.nps.gov/maca/)</a>.  I love the cave tours.  You don&#39;t say <br/>
what part of VA, but you can grab 64 West, then hit 65.  <br/>
<br/>
Probably not on your way, but a future day trip could be New River <br/>
Gorge (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nps.gov/neri/)">http://www.nps.gov/neri/)</a> in WV.  It&#39;s the highest bridge in <br/>
the US and second highest in the world. :)  It&#39;s also fun to drive the <br/>
crookedy road down to the original bridge and raft or kayak if you <br/>
have time or fly over the gorge.  I did this with five dollar frank <br/>
twenty years ago.  I&#39;m kind of doubting he&#39;s still around. :(  But <br/>
maybe his crazy museum still is.  It was at the airport near the <br/>
bridge.<br/>
<br/>
And if you head back east on I-10 from Phoenix, you can take a detour <br/>
on NM70 when you hit Las CrucesNM  and see White Sands <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nps.gov/whsa/)">http://www.nps.gov/whsa/)</a> then continue on to Carlsbad, NM (not the <br/>
legoland Carlsbad :) and see the Carlsbad Caverns <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nps.gov/cave/)">http://www.nps.gov/cave/)</a> and see the bats at sunset (there&#39;s an RV <br/>
park right near the entrance - not so fancy and with the heat you <br/>
might want to check into the motel there.  <br/>
<br/>
Then you can drop down 285 and pick up I-10 again just before <br/>
Dallas/Ft. Worth.  They have a major waterpark there if you&#39;re into <br/>
that. :)<br/>
<br/>
70 is another east west route that has the St. Louis Arch on it, but <br/>
anywhere you cross the Mississippi make time to stop and look and see <br/>
if you can camp overnight there.  If you are going on I-40, try <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tomsawyersrvpark.com/">http://www.tomsawyersrvpark.com/</a> and if you&#39;re going through Arkansas, <br/>
you can dig for diamonds if you go off the path a bit <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.craterofdiamondsstatepark.com/)">http://www.craterofdiamondsstatepark.com/)</a> and they have a nice <br/>
campground right there and a little waterpark type place and you might <br/>
want to stop at Hot Springs (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hotsprings.org/)">http://www.hotsprings.org/)</a><br/>
 which is near Crater of Diamonds.<br/>
<br/>
Do note that we travel in a motorhome, so check with each place to see <br/>
if they offer tent spaces if that&#39;s what you&#39;re using.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, those are some of the places we&#39;ve liked.  HTH!<br/>
<br/>
Take care, c.<br/>
<br/>
