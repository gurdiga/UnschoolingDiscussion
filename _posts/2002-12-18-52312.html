<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138863585">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I just posted about the topic of wild boys on a different list. Glad to know<br/>
that I am not the only one out there being called horrible names by my son.<br/>
Yesterday I asked him to stay with me while dropping off his sister at a play<br/>
rehersal with 250 kids. It was crowded and I felt the need to have him near.<br/>
He is not quite 6. You butt head ,at the top of his lungs, for a minute is<br/>
what I was called. I held his hand, brought his sister to her activity and hen<br/>
asked him what he wanted to look at. I really don&#39;t want to add to his misery<br/>
by giving him some punishment. Yet I want him to understand that it makes the<br/>
rest of us miserable to be called a bunch of names. My job of escorting his<br/>
sister was made more difficult because he ran away, called me names, and<br/>
refused to join me.<br/>
<br/>
I have no real helpful suggestion. I am a parent who deals with a beautiful<br/>
boy who explodes for seemingly small things. Losing at a game, being last,<br/>
being second,not getting his way, having to share. Keep up the suggestions<br/>
escpecially those families that have seen them mature.<br/>
<br/>
