<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Pam -- do you have an understanding of what the impetus was for the<br/>
&gt; reforms in math curriculums?  How much research, in reastic settings,<br/>
&gt; supported the newer approach to math?  (I&#39;m guessing that the NCASM<br/>
&gt; wrote volumes about this, I&#39;m just looking for something brief and <br/>
&gt; superficial.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the impetus was that kids weren&#39;t learning under the old traditional <br/>
methods.<br/>
The NCTM standards involve much high expectations of conceptual understanding <br/>
and skill development in many more areas than had been previously expected in <br/>
schools. And it was based on research that had shown that children don&#39;t <br/>
learn best by being &quot;taught&quot; or by rote drill - but learn best by <br/>
constructing their own understanding through investigation and invention and <br/>
collaboration and so on.<br/>
<br/>
There is a ton of research - Constance Kamii is one of the leading <br/>
researchers in this area - look under &quot;constructivist mathematics.&quot; A lot of <br/>
research is probably published in: Journal for Research in Mathematics <br/>
Education which is the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) <br/>
research journal. <br/>
<br/>
Try this article - it is in pdf and takes a while to load, longer than you <br/>
probably wanted, but is readable and very informative about research and the <br/>
NCTM standards.<br/>
