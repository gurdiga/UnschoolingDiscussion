<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784934637">Hi I am new here and have been reading for a few weeks. I find it quite<br/>
refreshing and totally natural.I wonder if you mind a few questions.<br/>
First, what is attachment parenting? And if that is self explanatory, would<br/>
normal parenting be de-tached? I find myself the at the end of many comments<br/>
too, and my dtrs friends seem to be jealous. I also hid the fact that my dtr<br/>
spent one night in her bassinette and the rest sleeping with me. Until she<br/>
was about 9. She also had her own room, but could sleep where she wanted.<br/>
Second, are there any contacts in NC? Tho I live on Cape Cod right now we<br/>
are selling our little condo to buy a small farm in NC.<br/>
Third, would anyone mind a suggestion to do a search on autism, asperger&#39;s<br/>
and Lyme disease? I am<br/>
co-director of a group of a nat&#39;l chapter of Lyme Disease Association and I<br/>
realize that I see the world as a different place knowing all that I do<br/>
about Borrelia(Lyme)...which is that its epidemic second only to AIDS in new<br/>
infection rate, and maybe surpassing it in current infection rate. Autism<br/>
and Aspergers are common diagnosis that many times clear with correct<br/>
treatment. There are good labs and ineffective ones, which are the ones most<br/>
hospitals and mds use. So unless you have sought out good info on labs, your<br/>
kids may be positive but test otherwise.<br/>
I hope no one minds me sharing that information too much.<br/>
I ended up here as we have homeschooled for a while and I have learned that<br/>
I can&#39;t alleviate stress for either one of us if I stick to a rigid schedule<br/>
and push for results. Those things are what we wanted to avoid by<br/>
homeschooling, and things are better now but there&#39;s always that twinge of<br/>
AM I doing the right thing? Will my dtr grow up educated? I can only compare<br/>
it to my rigid education in Catholic school. Knowledge thru kneeling.<br/>
thanks for being here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968190720">Welcome:-) <br/>
<br/>
You asked.... &quot;would normal parenting be de-tached?&quot; Well if you mean normal as in what the &quot;norm&quot; in today&#39;s society is, I would say yes. Daycare at 6 weeks, preschool at 1 etc. is not natural in any way in my book. Attachment to me is just what it implies. Holding baby(sling or arms), nursing on demand,co-sleeping. No unnecessary seperation from the child. Just being there for them. Sure as toddlers want to explore they will leave the safety of their mothers arms, but will also return often for comfort. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways that is interesting info about the lyme&#39;s disease. I&#39;ve been amazed at the number of people I run across lately saying their children have been diagnosed with one of these diseases. Of course while I&#39;m sure the information you have about some underlying medical condition such as lyme disease causing some of the cases/symptoms I also believe that many children are being diagnosed just because they aren&#39;t meeting what society calls &quot;normal milestone development&quot;. My 6 year old for example was severly speech delayed by society&#39;s standards, and also had what is now often referred to as SID symptoms. He is improving on his speech regularly and becoming much more comfortable with textures and sticky fingers and the works as he ages. I think we live in a society of overdiansosis on many things simply by increased expectations of parents. Years ago these issues wouldn&#39;t of even been a problem because children weren&#39;t starting school at 3. I do realize some cases are very real and even very severe. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s the norm.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m from NC btw. Do you have any idea what area you will be looking in?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t &quot;clear&quot;.  The traits can lessen.  I hear a lot lately <br/>
parents in an uproar about their children being &quot;flagged&quot; so to <br/>
speak.  The doctor&#39;s suggesting them to be evaluated.  I say to <br/>
myself that there isn&#39;t any harm.  Where were they when my daughter <br/>
was slipping away?  Where were they when by the age of 3yrs she was <br/>
only saying a few words? (when she spoke above age before).  I was <br/>
never asked some of the questions that may have triggered an <br/>
evaluation.  My daughter wasn&#39;t pretend playing.  Yes, she was happy <br/>
and healthy was she was alone with me and sorting things. <br/>
<br/>
My dh and I have brought her a long way from where she was at three.  <br/>
Emily is Aspergers will always be Aspergers no matter how well she <br/>
blends in with everyone else.  It is a different way of thinking and <br/>
seeing the world.  <br/>
<br/>
They have found the longer you wait to help them the harder it is to <br/>
gain ground.<br/>
