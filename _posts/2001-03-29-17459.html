 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to mention that the current issue of Working Mother has an<br/>
article about education alternatives, including homescholing.  It gives a<br/>

why she homeschools (unschools) her kids.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading this at the dentist (shudder!) and it brightened my day.<br/>
