<div id="ygrps-yiv-822299714">Dh and I are planning to move this year and California is at the top<br/>
of our list of choices in the US, we&#39;re in the northeast now.  brrrr.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read a little bit online about moving to California and what people <br/>
think once they did that but I&#39;d really like to know what the atmosphere<br/>
for unschoolers is and what location people would recommend looking into moving to<br/>
in California.  It&#39;s such a big place I&#39;m not sure where would be good.<br/>
<br/>
Any other information you can think of about good or bad points about certain<br/>
areas in California would be greatly appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that the monitors would want this discussion on the list, <br/>
please feel free to email me privately.   <br/>
<br/>
Thank You,<br/>
Joyce</div>

Yahoo is doing you all a favor and truncating addresses so that they can&#39;t be <br/>
&quot;harvested&quot; electronically.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to give your address to someone without it being an address cut <br/>
it in two or put in spaces that they need to take out later.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve sent those addresses to those two (others might have as well) because, <br/>
maybe, I can see them for being a moderator??<br/>
<br/>
My address is SandraDodd and then aol.com   You guys could supply the @<br/>
