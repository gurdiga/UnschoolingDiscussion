Back issues of National Geographic.<br/>
<br/>
The articles on the Middle East were frequent throughout the past forty years <br/>
(probably always, but the time I&#39;m remembering), in depth, CURRENT, and had <br/>
great photos.<br/>
<br/>
We can find National Geographics at thrift stores for a quarter to 45 cents.  <br/>
Well worth it.<br/>

Tia, <br/>
I have about 20 some odd years of back issues of National Geographic. If you <br/>
know what you want and can&#39;t find it near you, feel free to let me know and if <br/>
I have it I would be happy to send it to you. (You&#39;ve gotta send it back <br/>
though! &lt;g&gt;) If your son wants to talk to someone who lived in the middle east I <br/>
know there are many people, me included who would be happy to do so. Let me <br/>
know if I can help with the magazines.<br/>

He says that too!  I thought history was the dullest subject in school.  I used to have nightmares that at the last minute I found out I wouldn&#39;t graduate from college because I hadn&#39;t taken the required history courses.<br/>
<br/>
Not that it&#39;s the greatest thing ever written, but reading the Little House series (by LI Wilder) to my kids was the key to getting me excited about history.  A lightbulb went off when I realized that real history consists of stories - the stories of all the people who lived before us.<br/>

&lt;&lt;His major critique of high school history texts and course is that they try <br/>
to cover everything, and in so doing, don&#39;t give enough detail and background <br/>
to make the students care about any of it.  I&#39;m learning a lot from this <br/>

<br/>
True!  And instead of trying to &quot;expose&quot; kids to everything, if they could <br/>
just get them excited about a few things they might be happily curious enough to <br/>
find the rest.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just unschooling advice.   School isn&#39;t designed to get kids <br/>
happy, curious or excited.  It&#39;s designed to help them pass tests, and so some <br/>
facts are better than lots of curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532450504">&lt;&lt;Not that it&#39;s the greatest thing ever written, but reading the Little<br/>
House series (by LI Wilder) to my kids was the key to getting me excited<br/>
about history.  A lightbulb went off when I realized that real history<br/>
consists of stories - the stories of all the people who lived before<br/>
us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I purchased the boxed set at the Conference and was eager to read the<br/>
books. The detailed explanations of how things were made or done are<br/>
very interesting history. However I was horrified and shocked by the<br/>
stories of the parenting - mainly because somewhere I had gotten the<br/>
idea that these were books about enlightened and wonderful parenting.<br/>
Instead I found that Pa beat Laura with a belt, that she grew up<br/>
incessantly believing the idea that she was &quot;bad inside&quot;, and that she<br/>
must constantly repress all that was authentic and spirited about<br/>
herself in order to keep her parents&#39; approval. I guess compared to<br/>
other parents at the times these two were not authoritarian in the same<br/>
extreme, but it seemed to me that Laura&#39;s admiration of her parents was<br/>
by no means unmixed with a great deal of fear. Almonzo also lived in<br/>
absolute terror of beatings during his childhood.<br/>

If it&#39;s not a good example of current enlightened parenting, maybe it will be <br/>
good for kids to hear how common that used to be in the U.S. (and still is, <br/>
honestly).<br/>

I have read 5 books of the series to my boys. They enjoyed them up to The<br/>
Long Winter which they became bored with so we didn&#39;t finish it. Halfway<br/>
through Little House on the Prairie, Jess began to say how rude Ma was and<br/>
that he didn&#39;t like her. He would get really indignant at the way she spoke<br/>
to her girls and thought she was terrible for telling Laura she HAD to be a<br/>
teacher because she wanted one of girls to be one.  A homeschooling mum I<br/>
know wishes she could be like Ma, gentle and kind....but Jess thinks she is<br/>
the worst mum ever and if he ever meets her, she is going to get a piece of<br/>
his mind! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

big controversy when Laura wanted to wear blue ribbons in her hair instead of <br/>
pink. Ma said, No, Laura could only wear pink because her hair was brown and <br/>
Mary had to wear blue because her hair was blond. What was THAT all about? As a <br/>

Hi, Tia --<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if Lars would like it, but I like listening to NPR.  Shows <br/>
like Talk of the Nation discuss current events, sometimes with a strong <br/>
historical slant.  There are archives of old shows available on the <br/>
internet, at www.npr.org and then select the name of the show and the <br/>
topic or date.  These are playable on the computer with the free version <br/>
of the Real Player from Real Audio.  (You have to look in the footnotes <br/>
to find the free version on the Real Audio site.)<br/>
<br/>
I know very little about the historical situation in Iraq, but I know <br/>
that the boundaries of countries in the Middle East were redrawn right <br/>
after WWI, so that might be a place to start.<br/>
<br/>
If you and he don&#39;t know any history enthusiasts with better ideas, then <br/>
you might want to go to Amazon and search for books about Iraq and look <br/>
at the reviews and the related purchases.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003443015">wow, looks like it&#39;s time for another look at the LIttle House <br/>
Series! LOL I introduced them to my oldest girl when she was about <br/>
seven, and she couldn&#39;t get into them at all (she was already a <br/>
Tolkien freak by this time, having read The Hobbit...tut, giving her <br/>
such rich fare so early, spoiled her palate for other things LOL)<br/>
<br/>
and I read them as an older teen and liked them well enough, I <br/>
suppose. It&#39;s cool to go back to books, once you&#39;ve trod this ground <br/>
for a few years, and see how much you&#39;ve changed. :)<br/>
