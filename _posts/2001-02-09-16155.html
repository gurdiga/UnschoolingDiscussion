<div id="ygrps-yiv-12838427">One reason I immunized my boys was that my father was ill with leukemia for <br/>
years and his immune system was suppressed. The second boy got all the usual <br/>
vaccines plus the chicken pox vaccine because in my dad&#39;s condition he could <br/>
have gotten shingles from a kid with chicken pox. Chicken pox is most <br/>
contagious right before the rash shows up, so we  could have exposed my dad <br/>
unwittingly. Personally, I would also worry if my child got measles and gave <br/>
it to an infant or a pregnant woman. It could cause a miscarriage. It was an <br/>
issue for us because we attended a weekly playgroup until each child was <br/>
about 4.<br/>
<br/>
It was also nice not to have to go through that three weeks of quarantine <br/>
you do with chicken pox: 10 days after you&#39;re exposed, plus the whole time <br/>
you have the spots.<br/>
<br/>
To me it never made sense that a vaccine would give someone the disease. <br/>
Vaccines are made of killed cells. Killed cells can&#39;t reproduce.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of my children ever had side effects from their shots. I was careful <br/>
not to have them vaccinated on a day they seemed under the weather -- cold <br/>
or fever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834859637">Vaccines are not necessarily from &quot;killed&quot; cells.  Some vaccines are termed<br/>
&quot;modified live&quot; and some are &quot;live.&quot;  that is why your doc should have told<br/>
you that your child could get a mild case of whatever shots were given in<br/>
the case of measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox.<br/>
<br/>
Also, tetenus is &quot;modified live.&quot;  The tetenus antitoxin is the killed<br/>
vaccine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605438469">A few years ago I worked at a child care setting and we had a case of<br/>
chicken pox going around.<br/>
It was shocking to me the number of parents that thought their children<br/>
were immune to the illness bc they<br/>
had the vaccine. Lots of children who were vaccinated caught chicken pox<br/>
and we (child care workers) had to enlighten <br/>
the parents bc the doctors had not.  the same goes for other<br/>
vaccinations-people don&#39;t know what they are getting <br/>
and they are lead to believe it will save them. I strongly disagree with<br/>
the fear tactics that are used with immunizing.<br/>
We do not vaccinate and try not to medicate  (unless absolutely<br/>
necessary). My children are so much healthier than their peers.  I laugh<br/>
bc our doctor still gives me the antibiotic prescription (just in<br/>
case-says the dr.) and we have yet to use it. If we were a high risk<br/>
group maybe I would have to reconsider but for now it works for my<br/>
family.<br/>
