 You&#39;re in my thoughts too, and I&#39;m sure all will work out.  Just be <br/>
 yourself - you know, forceful and certain that you are right! :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Christy!<br/>
What a shocker after spending a lovely day with you guys....ugh.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
