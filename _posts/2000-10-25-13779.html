<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Last Sunday during the football games, the NFL aired a commercial that<br/>
they were joining the fight against breast cancer.  Here&#39;s the scoop:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On Tuesday, October 24, the NFL&#39;s Breast Cancer Awareness Day, the NFL<br/>
will donate $5 for every person that logs onto www.nfl.com and then clicks<br/>
on &quot;NFL for Her.&quot;  They will donate up to $50,000 to the Susan G. Komen<br/>
Breast Cancer Foundation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please forward this to people you believe will take a quick minute to make<br/>
a difference.<br/>
