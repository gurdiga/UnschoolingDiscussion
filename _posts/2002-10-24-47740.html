&gt; But pretty soon he was nipping us, even when we were careful to wash our<br/>
&gt; hands so no food smell was on them.<br/>
&gt;   I can not figure what we did wrong. We bought a really large homemade<br/>
&gt; wood and wire cage that allowed tons of room and he had lots of climbing<br/>
&gt; room.<br/>
&gt;   I found him another home as we had little ones and I was concerned they<br/>
&gt; would get their fingers nipped. Is it possible he did not have enough<br/>
&gt; physical attention or are males more aggressive?<br/>

We did a lot of research too. We heard that the boys are actually more <br/>
snuggly and quiet---easy-going. We all got females because they were <br/>
reportedly &quot;zippier&quot; and easier to train. But there are variations in lines <br/>
and types and colors.<br/>
<br/>
Did you buy from a breeder? I scream about this all the time with dogs (there <br/>
I go screaming again! &lt;G&gt;). A reputable breeder will advise all about the <br/>
positives and negatives--ESPECIALLY the negatives! <br/>
<br/>
The problems were probably 1) that you bought a rat that was bred as a feeder <br/>
rat (petshop purchase?), so he had no socialization at all. {Here we go <br/>
again---always that socialization issue! &lt;g&gt;} Reputable breeders gently <br/>
handle their babies from day one, so they&#39;re comfortable being handled---even <br/>
by strangers. Feedera are bred to feed snakes. No one should get too attached <br/>
to something they&#39;re going to feed to a snake! <br/>
<br/>
And 2) you only got one. Rats are EXTREMELY social animals. They can become <br/>
neurotic if kept as singles. A reputable breeder would NEVER have sold you an <br/>
only. They require twos or threes go together---usually same sex unless <br/>
you&#39;re buying to breed (then there&#39;s the breeder contract!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d try again, but look up breeders in your area on the rat sites (there are <br/>
a lot of them!). California and Florida are two of the hotbeds of rat shows.<br/>
<br/>
Most breeders will ship or meet you halfway by car (that&#39;s what ours did). <br/>
You&#39;ll pay a bit more from a reputable breeder, but the rat will be sweet and <br/>
clean (they seem not to stink as much as feeder rats).<br/>
<br/>
I can give you the names of my breeders in Florida if you&#39;d like.<br/>
