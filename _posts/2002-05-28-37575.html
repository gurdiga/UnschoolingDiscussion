 I admit it, I am a strewer of sorts.  My oldest boy does not like <br/>
 going to the library &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Strewing works fabulously here.<br/>
My oldest doesn&#39;t really like picking things out at the library as of late. <br/>
Not sure why.<br/>
So I will very often see something I think is interesting...a movie, book or <br/>
whatever. I check it out and leave it with the other library materials we got.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen him reading the books I&#39;ve checked out and really enjoying them.<br/>
So should I just ignore it when he says he doesn&#39;t want anything that day?<br/>
Is it manipulative to see something I think he may enjoy and bring it home?<br/>
No. Only if I hope to see him reading it and am disapointed when he doesn&#39;t.<br/>
A book sitting out where he can see it is simply available.<br/>
Some of them have sat until we return it. Others get picked up. It&#39;s totally <br/>
up to him.<br/>
That&#39;s no manipulative in any way.<br/>
I&#39;m simply giving him more choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447233908">Well Ren, <br/>
<br/>
It has already been established that that was not an accurate picture <br/>
of what was really going on here.  I don&#39;t have time to go back and <br/>
find when but I know it is there.  The lists were things agreed upon <br/>
and hashed out by all those involved and the control had more to do <br/>
with keeping Rachel from sliding into a depression and doing nothing <br/>
than anything else.  The lists BTW, are gone now.  Rachel is back on <br/>
anti-depressants and coping well.  Her activity level is not dropping <br/>
so there is no need for a list any more.<br/>
BUT if any of them start to slide into a place where they are not <br/>
contributing to the family, I will not ignore the situation and just <br/>
hope they get better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-426093470">**I guess because that isn&#39;t what I&#39;m saying.  The way some of you talk<br/>
about strewing sounds (to me anyway) as if you are saying that you<br/>
think about it all the time and are constantly finding things to<br/>
strew.  And what I have said is that that would have made big changes<br/>
in how my kids had turned out.  If I had spent any extra time<br/>
thinking about what to put in front of them and procuring it and<br/>
leaving it about for them, they would not have had any free time.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not the strewing queen, and I may not even being doing the strewing<br/>
thing &quot;right&quot;, but I&#39;ll add my two cents.<br/>
<br/>
Purposeful strewing is not something that I do or think about<br/>
constantly.  It really only comes up when we have a lull, or when my son<br/>
sleeps in a long time in the morning and I get bored.  (Not enough email<br/>
that day?)  Then, in the process of tidying up, I might find a book or a<br/>
toy that has never been used or not been used recently and I&#39;ll put it<br/>
in a prominent place.  The tiniest example I can think of is once I had<br/>
moved the K&#39;nex into a dresser drawer instead of a transparent storage<br/>
box.  I &quot;strewed&quot; them, when they hadn&#39;t been touched for awhile, by<br/>
just pulling the drawer open so he could see them and be reminded of<br/>
them.  Our board games are overflowing the storage that we have in the<br/>
living room, so every so often, when I&#39;m pondering whether I can get rid<br/>
of any of the overflow, I rotate one or two games back in from the<br/>
garage.  I bring them in and stick them on a table, rather than inside<br/>
the cabinet we have.  One of my main objectives with strewing is to<br/>
circulate things.  I believe if unschooling/life ever gets dull a fine<br/>
way to liven it up is to clean out a closet.<br/>
<br/>
I do strewing for a few minutes a couple of times a month, if I think<br/>
about it.  If I tidied up more often, I might strew more often.  When I<br/>
clean up I&#39;m always amazed at the things that I find that *I* have<br/>
forgotten we have.  If I have a problem, &lt;g&gt; it&#39;s compulsive shopping<br/>
(thrift shops), not compulsive strewing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure I waste more of my time stepping over stuff my son has<br/>
strewn on the floor than he could possibly waste swerving or detouring<br/>
over what I put out.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly think that school-at-home parents who make their kids spend<br/>
time on a subject they select are warping their kids, or at least<br/>
squandering some of their time that could be spent better.  However, I<br/>
don&#39;t think my kid is going to be lured away from his own developmental<br/>
journey because I&#39;m rolling golden apples across his path.  He has a<br/>
powerful ability to make his own choices and to say &quot;no&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014402639">I don&#39;t strew.  I share.<br/>
<br/>
A recent post (I think it was yesterday...this thread is long...) <br/>
mentioned that kids can sense *contrived*.  They can usually sense <br/>
contrived if they&#39;ve been manipulated in the past.  But kids who <br/>
trust their parents won&#39;t sense *contrived to elicit an educational <br/>
experience* if a mom leaves out a game or puzzle or gizmo gadget.  <br/>
They&#39;ll sense mom&#39;s love.<br/>
<br/>
I share all kinds of things with my kids.  Some they like and become <br/>
interested in; some they thank me but move easily on to something <br/>
else.  That&#39;s what a family does.  They share their lives and their <br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
We live in PA.  I need to provide records for the state.  As the <br/>
year goes on, if I see the science section of the portfolio is a <br/>
little anemic, I&#39;ll let my ds and dd know that.  They start hunting <br/>
around for something to do.  Sometimes they even ask me for <br/>
suggestions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851711314">Hello all.  I&#39;ve just been reading about strewing on Sandra&#39;s site  <br/>
and was wondering if it&#39;s the same thing as buying stuff that lays  <br/>
around the house for your children to use as they want and when they  <br/>
want.  I have not, so far, bought stuff on my own to just leave  <br/>
around the house, especially not with &quot;strewing&quot; in mind.  There may  <br/>
be things I buy (when dd is with me) that look like fun--ie: a giant  <br/>
tin of TinkerToys that she *never* would have asked for but enjoys  <br/>
immensely, or cool coloring books with coral reefs in them (that  <br/>
haven&#39;t been used although reefs were a recent topic of discussion).   <br/>
Most of &quot;her&quot; stuff is stuff she picks out to buy and plays with as  <br/>
she wishes.  Most of it lives in her room until she chooses to get it  <br/>
out and bring it downstairs.  I just don&#39;t feel very inspired in my  <br/>
strewing, but then I wonder if I&#39;m somehow failing my dd.<br/>

Just wondering.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you saying you&#39;re never using your own knowledge about what might  <br/>
interest her, but waiting for her to take the initiative all the  <br/>
time? That&#39;s too much waiting. I mean, just take the example of games  <br/>
- there are LOTS of times that kids can&#39;t imagine how much fun a game  <br/>
is going to be, just from looking at the box, for example. If YOU  <br/>
know that she LOVED Candyland, then you might pick up Chutes and  <br/>
Ladders because it is also likely to be fun for her - you don&#39;t need  <br/>
to wait for her to ask for it. She might never happen to see it and  <br/>
might very likely never realize that it is a game she&#39;d like a lot.  <br/>
Or maybe she loves CLUE - she&#39;d likely enjoy MASTERMIND - both  <br/>
involve the same kind of logical thinking. So - how is she going to  <br/>
know that?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of unschoolers who say they never bring home anything for  <br/>
their kids - because they feel that puts subtle pressure on them to  <br/>
learn what the parents are promoting. I say hogwash to that &lt;G&gt;. I  <br/>
pick up stuff ALL the time - STILL do it and mine are 14, 18, and  <br/>
almost 21. If I see an unusual fruit in the grocery store, I buy it  <br/>
and take it home and put it on the table for others to notice. If a  <br/>
kid is in the store with me I might say, &quot;Oooh look at this. Let&#39;s  <br/>
take it home and cut it open.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is why some of us dislike the term &quot;child-led&quot; or &quot;child- <br/>
directed&quot; learning --- unschooling is not child-led or child-directed  <br/>
learning - that makes it sound like the parent should just be a  <br/>
&quot;follower.&quot; Not so - parents are active participants and part of the  <br/>
job of an unschooling parent is to keep the child in mind and to fill  <br/>
his/her life with just the right amount of interesting new  <br/>
experience, chances to repeat experiences, down time, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to make it &quot;just right&quot; is to offer and not coerce. If  <br/>
you don&#39;t &quot;offer&quot; stuff/ideas/experiences, then the kids aren&#39;t going  <br/>
to even know what&#39;s out there. If you push too much on them, they can  <br/>
feel pressured and that their learning is being taken over by you.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t all that tricky, though, when you live with a kid and pay  <br/>
attention and care deeply - to keep that child in mind and provide  <br/>
him/her with a pretty steady stream of options/possibilities/ideas/ <br/>
stuff, etc. Invite and offer a lot - it is your job to create a  <br/>
stimulating and interesting environment around her.<br/>

<time> 8 Nov 2005, at 12:46am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431829198">In our family, kids are ages 12, 10, and 5, we&#39;ve found that certain<br/>
circumstances/preparations help optimize the strewing.  <br/>
 <br/>
1)  If the item being strewn(?) is somehow related to a recent interest,<br/>
that helps.  Recently, my kids have gone on an all out tan grams marathon.<br/>
They were never interested in them before but dh saw a puzzle in Family Math<br/>
and started to do it.  That led to dd cutting out pieces from a photocopy of<br/>
the book which led to a trip to the teacher store to find plastic ones (a<br/>
bargain at $1 per set)<br/>
 <br/>
2) If I clear off a table and provide an inviting work space, the item<br/>
offered becomes much more attractive.  I used to worry that the items I<br/>
bought and offered were being rejected a lot.  It occurred to me that it was<br/>
just too much to ask for them to both notice the thing amongst all the<br/>
clutter and also take the time to find a cleared off table to work at.  Now,<br/>
I will often clean off a table, put out some cushions or chairs, and place<br/>
the item neatly on the table. (Recently I put out  a variety of clay and<br/>
lots of tools along with nice plastic placemats to work on.  Didn&#39;t say a<br/>
word about it and the next thing I knew all three kids were sculpting away<br/>
making all kinds of things - I find this miraculous)<br/>
 <br/>
3) If something occurs to me, dh or one of the kids, we are in the habit of<br/>
hitting pause on the TV or computer game to interject.  Lightly, of course<br/>
so as not to be too annoying.  But we have the most wonderful conversations<br/>
and find new directions to explore when we take the time to do this.<br/>
Yesterday a friend brought over the DVD of a movie about the crusades which<br/>
we watched together and even though ds didn&#39;t stay for the whole flick, we<br/>
knew he&#39;d want to come back for the special features on castles and medieval<br/>
weapons.  We hit so many topics of interest and now I have a whole new<br/>
subset of things that the kids will notice when I get around to strewing<br/>
them.  (I recently ordered some castle blocks and now we have a previous<br/>
conversation and interest to tie that into.)<br/>
 <br/>
4) If it doesn&#39;t fly, I &#39;d better put it away and maybe try again later.  If<br/>
I appear to be pushing a particular book or game or something I *will*<br/>
encounter resistance and then that item may be snubbed for a long time.  If<br/>
I move on without too much fuss, or don&#39;t even mention it then the item can<br/>
more easily resurface later.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, It took a few years to recognize the patterns , and each family has<br/>
it&#39;s own quirks and family culture.  Your family might like to find their<br/>
books organized by topic or to get their games strewn by the game fairy in<br/>
the middle of the night.  I&#39;m still trying to figure out a way to read to my<br/>
older kids during the day instead of when they&#39;re ready to fall asleep at<br/>
night.  DD listens to Harry Potter books one or two pages at a time.LOL   It<br/>
takes months (nay, years) to get through each volume but she still loves<br/>
them.<br/>
 <br/>
Happy strewing,<br/>

Sandra wouldn&#39;t allow discussion of that.<br/>
<br/>
Not so.<br/>
<br/>
  In fact, twice you&#39;ve sent specific state information and Sandra  <br/>
reminded you of OUR (list owners) request that people not post about  <br/>
specific state laws on this list. There are people from every state  <br/>
and around the world, here, and so local information is generally a  <br/>
waste of time to most of the approximately 2,000 people. This list is  <br/>
for talking about learning/unschooling - not the local legal stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re wanting to give someone information about unschooling in a  <br/>
particular state, though, you could send that information to me, as  <br/>
I&#39;m collecting &quot;Unschooling Across the States&quot; information and will  <br/>
post it on the &lt;unschooling.info&gt; website when I have enough of it to  <br/>
make it worthwhile.<br/>

&gt; so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to violate her rules again.<br/>
&gt; feel free to contact me if you like-=-<br/>
