<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172727990">**I know that sometimes Home <br/>
Education Magazine is &quot;schooly&quot; and I stop my subscription for that <br/>
occasionally but usually go back for a while to try again,**<br/>
<br/>
This is what I felt about HEM for while but I&#39;ve seen alot of unschooling in it lately.   Then yesterday I was reading the latest issue and in the letters to the editor someone was saying they didn&#39;t like the fact the there was so much of an unschooling tilt!    Please!   How many things are out there that are curriculum based and how much is out there that is unschooling?   I kept thinking,  well, if its changing towards unschooling more, maybe more people are seeing the sense in it all!   I know Helen believes in it.   She had a great publishers note this month,  although I like all her notes.   Thank you Helen!<br/>

  &gt; I got sent a sample copy and found it too &quot;schooly&quot; for me-( I really wanted<br/>
  &gt; to like it too, because of GWS withdrawls).<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Is that not the case?  maybe it was a &quot;bad&quot; issue I read?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>

  You found Life Learning to be &quot;Schooly&quot;?  but I love Life <br/>
  Learning.  Maybe you did get a bad issue because I think their goal is to not <br/>
  be &quot;schooly&quot;.<br/>

great and a lot of great articles from people on this list.  That was a nice <br/>
issue.  Though not the norm from my experience.<br/>

I just wanted to echo this and say that although there&#39;s lots of<br/>
valuable stuff throughout an issue of HEM, it&#39;s Helen&#39;s notes, most<br/>
often, that really resonate for me in a deep way.<br/>
