<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067497110">I&#39;m receiving the digest version of this list and I have a suggestion.  It <br/>
would be much easier if the digest could only be lengthy enough to fill up an <br/>
e-mail and not have to be sent in an attachment.  I would rather get two or <br/>
more e-mails a day than have to fiddle around with downloading, saving and <br/>
later opening an attached file--in fact, usually I just delete them right <br/>
away due to lack of time.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone agree and, if so, where do I go with this suggestion?<br/>

<br/>
Is it because they are so big that they are attachments or are they<br/>
attachments regardless?  One suggestion is that people take the time to only<br/>
put small snippets into a reply rather than the whole e-mail they are<br/>
replying to.  I find it much easier to read that way then slogging through<br/>
the whole thing everytime.<br/>
