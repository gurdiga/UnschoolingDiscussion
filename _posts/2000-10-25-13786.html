<div id="ygrps-yiv-89717205">Very interesting.  Of course, the shrub crew was immediately out saying that<br/>
the study was bought and paid for by the demos which is clearly contradicted<br/>
by the fact that Rand has done several studies which were very critical of<br/>
some of the demo pushed agendas.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 -  The Texas education &quot;miracle,&quot; hailed by Republican<br/>
&gt; presidential nominee George W. Bush as proof of his power in the<br/>
classroom,<br/>
&gt; may well be a myth, according to a study to be released Tuesday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;        THE STUDY BY the nonprofit RAND Corp., a private think tank, found<br/>
&gt; that dramatic increases in tests administered by Texas are not reflected<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; national exams taken by the same youngsters.<br/>
&gt;        In fact, while Texas found the gaps in achievement shrinking<br/>
between<br/>
&gt; white and non-white students, the national tests showed them actually<br/>
&gt; increasing slightly in some areas.<br/>
&gt;        Researchers offered no definitive explanation for the &quot;stark<br/>
&gt; differences&quot; in results on the tests.<br/>
&gt;        But they said it may be that Texas educators, who are awarded for<br/>
&gt; student achievement, may coach youngsters to do well on state tests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &#39;THE &#39;TEXAS MIRACLE&#39; IS A MYTH&#39;<br/>
&gt;        &quot;I think &#39;the Texas miracle&#39; is a myth,&quot; said Stephen Klein, a<br/>
senior<br/>
&gt; RAND researcher who helped lead the study, &quot;What do Test Scores in Texas<br/>
&gt; Tell Us?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         &quot;There is nothing remarkable in Texas education,&quot; Klein told<br/>
&gt; Reuters. &quot;With few exceptions, notably fourth-grade math, gains in Texas<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; recent years were about the same as in the (rest of the) United States.&quot;<br/>
&gt;        Bush, Texas governor since 1995, has cited big increases in state<br/>
&gt; test scores as evidence he has turned around his schools and can upgrade<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; nation&#39;s classrooms.<br/>
&gt;        Mark Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager for Democratic presidential<br/>
&gt; nominee Al Gore, jumped on the RAND study, saying, &quot;The very foundation of<br/>
&gt; the Bush campaign just crumbled.&quot;<br/>
&gt;        &quot;This RAND report reveals serious questions about Mr. Bush&#39;s<br/>
repeated<br/>
&gt; claims that his education reforms have worked,&quot; Fabiani said.<br/>
&gt;        Gore&#39;s running mate, Joseph Lieberman, added, &quot;We all hope and pray<br/>
&gt; for miracles, but they are not occurring in the Texas school system.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; HEAT FROM BUSH CAMPAIGN<br/>
&gt;        The report immediately drew heat from the Bush campaign for its<br/>
&gt; narrow focus on the state of Texas, its seeming contradiction with an<br/>
&gt; earlier, more comprehensive Rand study praising the state&#39;s academic<br/>
&gt; achievements and the timing of its release.<br/>
&gt;        &quot;It&#39;s findings are erroneous,&quot; said Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes.<br/>
&gt; &quot;The timing is highly suspect.&quot;<br/>
&gt;        Rand President James Thomson said timing of the paper&#39;s release was<br/>
&gt; based only on completion of peer reviews and revision. &quot;We don&#39;t produce<br/>
&gt; findings for political reasons,&quot; he said.<br/>
&gt;        Klein said his research singled out Texas because its state test<br/>
&gt; scores rose sharply and were widely publicized. The work began last spring<br/>
&gt; and was funded by the think tank and not outside groups, he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; METHODOLOGY QUESTIONED<br/>
&gt;        Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said a number of other studies,<br/>
including<br/>
&gt; one released by the RAND Corp. in July, showed Texas among those leading<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; nation in reducing the achievement gap between white and non-white<br/>
students.<br/>
&gt; He also questioned the methodology used by the researchers.<br/>
&gt;        &quot;This new study is based on only 20 school districts out of 1,044<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; Texas,&quot; Bartlett said. &quot;It is not representative of Texas.&quot;<br/>
&gt;        &quot;He obviously didn&#39;t read the study,&quot; Klein replied. &quot;We looked at<br/>
&gt; schools in every district. This study has the latest data.&quot;<br/>
&gt;        &quot;We started this project in April and it has nothing to do with the<br/>
&gt; election,&quot; Klein said. &quot;We wanted to find out what was going on in Texas.&quot;<br/>
&gt;        The report compares scores from Texas&#39; own test, the Texas<br/>
Assessment<br/>
&gt; of Academic Skills test, with Texas students&#39; performance on the National<br/>
&gt; Assessment of Academic Progress, a national sampling test used voluntarily<br/>
&gt; by 44 states.<br/>
&gt;        Looking at how fourth- and eighth-graders scored in reading and<br/>
math<br/>
&gt; from 1994 to 1998, it found that Texas children made higher gains on the<br/>
&gt; state test than on the national test. For instance, Texas fourth-graders<br/>
&gt; improved in reading from 1994 to 1998 at about the same rate as other<br/>
&gt; children nationwide, but the state tests showed far greater gains in<br/>
&gt; reading.<br/>
&gt;        &quot;The large discrepancies between TAAS and NAEP results raise<br/>
serious<br/>
&gt; questions about the validity of the TAAS scores,&quot; RAND researchers wrote.<br/>
&gt;        &quot;We do not know the sources of these differences,&quot; they said.<br/>
&gt; &quot;However, one plausible explanation ... is that many schools are devoting<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; great deal of class time to highly specific TAAS preparation.&quot;<br/>
&gt;        The report said another factor can be that though the TAAS exam<br/>
&gt; changes year to year, &quot;one version looks a lot like another.&quot;<br/>
&gt;        &quot;Thus, giving students instruction and practice on how to answer<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; specific types of questions ... could very well improve their scores,&quot; it<br/>
&gt; said.<br/>
&gt;        &quot;In an effort to improve their TAAS scores, some schools have<br/>
&gt; retained outside contractors to work with teachers, students or both,&quot; it<br/>
&gt; said.<br/>
&gt;        The report said the starkest differences between Texas students&#39;<br/>
&gt; performance on the state test and the national test were among the race<br/>
gaps<br/>
&gt; between white and minority children. On the national test, the race gap<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; large and increased slightly. The Texas test showed a much smaller gap,<br/>
&gt; decreasing slightly.<br/>
&gt;        Klein said one possible explanation for the high number of students<br/>
&gt; doing well in the Texas exam is that TAAS is not particularly tough, so<br/>
even<br/>
&gt; less skilled youngsters are able to score as well - or nearly as well - as<br/>
&gt; more accomplished ones.<br/>
&gt;        The Texas tests are used to decide whether children move to the<br/>
next<br/>
&gt; grade or graduate - and to reward or punish their schools, mostly through<br/>
&gt; funding.<br/>
