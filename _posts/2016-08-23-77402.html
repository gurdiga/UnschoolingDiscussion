<div id="ygrps-yiv-845874195"><p>I thought there were, and I&#39;ve been searching for, previous threads about helping kids who get very upset about losing games. &nbsp;I can&#39;t seem to find them. &nbsp;Maybe I&#39;m not using the right search words. &nbsp;If anyone can point them out, thank you so much. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise, here&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for help with. &nbsp;My 10yo son has a very difficult time with losing any game. &nbsp;I can play cooperative games with him so we can just enjoy a game without a winner or loser, but he has friends who want to play games with him and he can&#39;t maintain control of his emotions when he is losing or is afraid is going to lose. &nbsp;He cries, screams, and tries to fix the game so he&#39;s not losing. &nbsp;His friends stare at him in disbelief. &nbsp;Some try to let him win because he&#39;s crying. &nbsp;Some call him a cheater and he gets more upset at being called a cheater. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Today, my son asked me to play a new made-up version of Connect4. &nbsp;There were several matches in a timed tournament. &nbsp;He had a higher score most of the game. &nbsp;He handled it well when I caught up to his score, didn&#39;t get upset, but instead focused on trying to win. &nbsp;Then, I won without really trying to, and he got very upset with yelling, screaming, and clear actions of anger with screaming through gritted teeth, strained and red face, banging his fist in his hands or on the table, and trying to reset the game so he could try to win instead. &nbsp;This is a very typical reaction when he loses a board game. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>When my son plays sports video games that are challenging (right now it&#39;s football), he cries, screams, yells, throws himself on the floor in a tantrum when he is losing or when the other team scores a few points even though he is really far ahead in points, but he&#39;s still afraid he&#39;s going to lose. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We&#39;ve talked so much about what he is feeling -- he really just HATES to lose and it angers him so much. &nbsp;I&#39;ve tried empathizing. &nbsp;I&#39;ve tried redirecting - offering the suggestion to take a break and come back to a video game later. &nbsp;Once in a while, he will do this. &nbsp;I&#39;ve tried talking to him at a later time when he&#39;s calm how he can help himself calm down (physical things like deep breathing, pausing for a quick run or time on the trampoline). &nbsp;I&#39;ve offered ideas of how to reframe the situation in his mind - that the main goal of a game is to enjoy playing regardless of the win/lose outcome, that a game isn&#39;t fun if it isn&#39;t challenging, that everybody loses games - even the best players in the world lose games, and I relayed to him something one of the Olympic swimmers said in an interview - that if you do your best, you&#39;ll feel good about yourself no matter the outcome win or lose, the metal is just a really awesome bonus (hugely paraphrasing). &nbsp;We&#39;ve also talked about anger and other emotions in a 3rd person scenario like from the Inside Out movie. &nbsp;He hears me, it seems to make sense, but in the end he says he just gets really angry in the moment, and he can&#39;t seem to control it. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This afternoon when he got upset that I won the Connect4 game, I was trying to stay present with him and help him calm down. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t working, and after a while I lost my cool. &nbsp;I yelled him that he needed to stop immediately. &nbsp;He did. &nbsp;I shocked him, and the rage ended immediately and he was able to move into a calmer form of being upset. &nbsp;It was like a switch flipped that he couldn&#39;t control. &nbsp;He calmly and kindly asked for me to give him some space. &nbsp;I apologized and gave him some space and said we&#39;ll come back to it when he&#39;s ready. &nbsp;I checked in with a couple times. &nbsp;I did some crying, talking to himself, and a little yelling to me; but mostly he talked himself down and through his upset. &nbsp;When he was ready, we reconnected and talked about it. This was when he said he just hates losing so much and it makes him angry. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The other day, we had a plumber here, and my son was playing his football game while the plumber was here without a peep. &nbsp;He may have taken a break at one point before he got upset; but as soon as the plumber left, he resumed his game, and the yelling and crying started again.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>So these examples tell me he can control the anger for a short time, but then it will burst up if he doesn&#39;t walk away. &nbsp;He has told me other times that he figured out that if he pretends to be the game announcer / commentator when he&#39;s playing Madden, then that helps him to not get angry because his role is more neutral even though he&#39;s actually controlling one team. &nbsp;Another time he has put tape on his mouth to help as a physical reminder to not yell and cry - totally his idea. &nbsp;So he&#39;s working on it, and he has had some little successes, but I&#39;m wearing down and&nbsp;<span style="line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;">it has affected his friendships. &nbsp;He is a child I have worked with since he was young on developing social skills to get along with other kids. &nbsp;Other kids want to play games, and he gets upset if he doesn&#39;t get his way or he loses. &nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p>And, honestly, it&#39;s getting really old to listen to all the time in the house with the video game playing. &nbsp;He is REALLY into tackle football right now. &nbsp;It has been a pleasure to watch the learning dance he has done around this new interest of his, and he really wants to play Madden and it&#39;s helping him to learn the game. &nbsp;I want him to have this fun resource, but my patience is worn down from the yelling and screaming, and I don&#39;t know how to help him any more. &nbsp;(My husband&#39;s patience is even thinner.) &nbsp;At one point, I asked my husband to take away the college football game because my son was really having a hard time with it. &nbsp;He was told that he could have it back after a few days if he thought he could play it without yelling and crying. &nbsp;I know it was a punishment, but I needed a break. &nbsp;He&#39;s been told he can only be allowed to play it if he can seem to be able to handle it. &nbsp;If not, then he&#39;s not ready to play it. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>On a side note, his dad has a similar history. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t play board games very often because he can&#39;t stand to lose either. &nbsp;He used to angrily shout while playing video games, but doesn&#39;t really do that any more. &nbsp;The first year I knew him, he flipped a checker board in a bit of anger because he thought I was going to win. &nbsp;I was so shocked, it seemed to come out of nowhere. &nbsp;So we don&#39;t play board games, other than once in a great while we will play as a family. &nbsp;He pretty much says he hates board games though. &nbsp;The other night, my son talked him into playing Connect4. &nbsp;The first game, my son was winning. &nbsp;My husband was trying to end the game prematurely stating no one would win. &nbsp;I suggested they play it out because I saw that my son could force a win. &nbsp;My husband dumped the checkers instead of giving my son the opportunity to play his winning piece. &nbsp;I left to run errands, and my son told me that they continued playing and my son won 5 games, and my husband won 4 games. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I admit I have a big fear that it&#39;s possible my son will not outgrow this because his dad hasn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know how else to help him or if what I&#39;m doing is having any effect. &nbsp;</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044662850">-=-And, if you suspect this difficulty in losing is somehow genetically linked, why are you so hard on yourself for not being able to change it?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I know!  I know the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Just because the dad wasn’t helped with ways to be calm doesn’t mean that an unschooled child whose parents are there to help him, can’t be gently coached toward ways to calm himself.<br/>
<br/>
it’s not “fixing him,” but helping him cope better with the realities of his own biochemistry.  Helping a child get around who has physical disabilities isn’t trying to “fix him.”  Helping a blind child with ways to get around the house or the neighborhood isn’t &quot;trying to fix him.”<br/>
<br/>
-=- One of the biggest shifts in my relationship with my daughter, who used to explode about things that seemed to me not to be worthy of such reactions, came when I realized that I didn&#39;t help her by trying to talk/yell/punish her out of those negative emotions.  If she was upset, I could focus on 1) being present and available to assist her, 2) keeping her and other people safe, and 3) keeping myself calm.   Frantic fixing was not helpful.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes to assistance and safety, but this all leaves out coaching, which I have seen help lots.<br/>
We can all picture the damage of going too far and trying to fix.  I have also seen the damage when a family believes there IS no “fix” and the thing to do is to allow any and all behavior, gently accepting it, and NOT attempting to change a thing.  It’s not being a good partner, to condone, encourage, or become complicit in behavior that harms the reputation or friendships of someone you love.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was explosive and didn’t like to lose, but within just a few years, others would never have known it.  We didn’t yell or punish.  We didn’t just focus on future prevention (though we got good at that, too).  We helped him with thoughts and awareness (talking to him just a bit, when he was calm) so that he could help himself when he was out and away from the house with friends, or at the gaming shop.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/coaching">http://sandradodd.com/coaching</a><br/>
I’m not home and have been really busy, and today and travelling across the UK, so I can’t be as thorough as sometimes.<br/>
I hope the person with the original question will find time to read carefully, over a few days, at the link above.<br/>
Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542616293">One thing that has helped my youngest is watching youtubers. A couple of years ago she was having a tough time with the game Octodad and raging off and on throughout the day. Since it was because she was stuck at one particular point in the game, I looked up some lets plays to see how to get past that point. We watched a Markiplier letsplay, which did indeed help her get past the hard part, but to my surprise, it helped her deal with her emotions. She began imitating his reactions. Raging, but in a funny way, laughing at herself or the situation. The more Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, etc. videos she watched, the more tools she had to deal with her emotions. I guess it helps seeing how older, more experienced gamers deal with the frustration that can come up. Now she has her own channel. :)</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:13px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:13px;">Sometimes Ethan sets up challenges for one or both of us in games. &nbsp;Like right now we are playing our own made-up version of the game &quot;Suspend&quot; in the evenings. &nbsp;Ethan will set up the initial structure in such a way as he thinks will be nearly impossible for Doug and I to build from. &nbsp;Then Ethan watches us try to navigate his challenge. &nbsp; Ethan wins if the structure falls as we&#39;re building, or he loses when we succeed to use all the pieces without the structure falling down. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t really see it as winning or losing though. &nbsp;It&#39;s about the fun of trying to complete a seemingly impossible task. &nbsp;He&#39;s actually routing for us, just as we are inspired by his challenge. &nbsp;Something like that might create some distance for your son, helping him see competitive play in a way that&#39;s less personal perhaps.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:13px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:13px;">Whether Ethan is a neutral player or actively trying to stump us with an impossible challenge, watching Doug and I work together seems to be very valuable to Ethan. Seeing how we embrace the challenge of the game or his challenges. &nbsp;Seeing how we handle defeat or victory. &nbsp;Watching us work together or further challenge the other. &nbsp;Watching us banter and/or encourage. &nbsp;I can see Ethan learns a lot. &nbsp;He seems to enjoys it very much, and has for years. &nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;line-height:13px;">Perhaps you could encourage your husband to join you in some sort of game play, being clear to your husband that his role would not be to win, but to help your son learn how to play a game for the fun of the challenge, winning or losing with grace and good gamesmanship.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;line-height:13px;">For some people, games are invaluable for skill building, and the fun is the improvement in ability. &nbsp;My husband has a group of friends who he enjoys playing Starcraft with. &nbsp;His friends play as intensely and as seriously as he does. &nbsp;They really push each other. &nbsp;Sometimes they do yell and get frustrated, but they are rarely (if ever) disrespectful of each other or the other team members. &nbsp;After a couple of years of playing together, their team has reached Masters level, which, for them, was really exciting and quite an accomplishment. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font color="#3f3f3f" face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto"><span style="line-height:13px;"><br></span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font color="#3f3f3f" face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto"><span style="line-height:13px;">Find the strength behind your son&#39;s motivation for playing games, and then find ways to help him achieve his goals. &nbsp;It&#39;s not likely as simple as he just always wants to win. &nbsp;There&#39;s probably more going on. &nbsp;Experiment with many ways of playing games with him. &nbsp;Find out what works and what doesn&#39;t. &nbsp;Build on what does work. &nbsp;Pay attention to why. &nbsp;Support that. &nbsp;His confidence and skills (and yours) will grow likely from there.</span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font color="#3f3f3f" face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto"><span style="line-height:13px;"><br></span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><font color="#3f3f3f" face="Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto"><span style="line-height:13px;">Karen James</span></font></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138119280">My daughter, now 14, has very big feelings.   When she was younger she behaved much like your son does with win/lose games.   My own family - I mean myself, my parents and siblings -  are very British middle class, and we go to great lengths to hide our emotions and feelings.  That stiff upper lip thing ;)    My husband&#39;s family are not like that at all, they tend to shout and throw and kick things when they are angry.   I suspect that truly good mental health exists somewhere between the two.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to help my daughter find ways to react less, or to hide her reactions.  She is very in touch with her emotions and likes to talk about them and analyse them.  She eventually told me that our attempts to help her hide her frustration at losing made her feel like we were asking her to not &#39;just be herself&#39;.    Like we wanted her to be someone different.  It seemed to me she was describing the &#39;authentic self&#39; that so many people who write about mental health talk about.  And our attempts to get her to tone down the volume on her emotions were perceived by her as denying her authentic self.   We continued to talk about these things over the years, but more about the concepts, not about her own behaviour, as such.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one time she had been playing cards at her Grandma&#39;s house, and her Grandparents had talked to her about the concept of a &#39;poker face&#39;, and had tried to encourage her to develop a poker face.   At their house she politely declined, saying she didn&#39;t think it was right to cover up her feelings to that extent.  Her Grandparents were struck by how fluently she talked and thought about the concept, but they were also completely nonplussed by how firmly she was convinced that a poker face was not for her.   <br/>
<br/>
I think we have lost a couple of friends partly because of this issue along the way.  But discussing it with my daughter enabled me to realise that I also felt somewhat stifled and on edge with these particular friends.   Letting these friends drift away has actually left us happier.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays my daughter avoids playing certain types of games with certain types of people.   She also has a punch bag, stress balls and other physical outlets for when her feelings are too big for her to contain them.   She has learned how to distract herself with movies, music or running around the garden when she starts feeling overwhelmed with her emotions and doesn&#39;t want to actually get upset.   Equally, sometimes, she allows herself to get upset, and lets it out.<br/>

Recent conversations in my real life have included people brushing up on skills by watching YouTube—repairing a swamp cooler, installing tile, and brain surgery (seriously—but not all the same person or the same video :-)—but I hadn’t thought about it helping someone to accept and deal with frustration.<br/>

They talk about it being a great match, or about how much they&#39;ve learned, instead of getting upset.

He spent a lot of time playing videogames with James (my husband/David&#39;s father) who&#39;d let him get the best weapons and give him headstarts so he could win, and James would often play the hard parts of games for him, letting David take over to deal the final blow to the boss, or collect the level rewards.

<br/>
When Pokemon collectible cards first came out, there was much noise among conservatives and among U.S. fundamentalist Christians about it being anti-Christian, and blasphemous (claims that in Japan there was a character called Peter ’n’ Paul or something like that—maybe someone here knows or remembers).  SO much noise and going on in hopes that if LOTS of other families objected, they wouldn’t feel as pressured to buy their kids the cards.  And the TV show was reviled as nothing but an advertisement for expensive cards that amounted to gambling because packets were bought sealed.  And there was “evolution” in there.  Even using the word denies “Creationism.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It’s possible, Bernadette, that your mom had been exposed to some of that flood of prejudice and argument.<br/>
<br/>
I love that you let your kids watch the show, and discovered and now have shared the sweetness and kindness in it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568460718">-=- He hears me, it seems to make sense, but in the end he says he just gets really angry in the moment, and he can&#39;t seem to control it.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
He won’t always be as young as he is now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This afternoon when he got upset that I won the Connect4 game, I was trying to stay present with him and help him calm down.  It wasn&#39;t working, and after a while I lost my cool.  I yelled him that he needed to stop immediately.  He did.  I shocked him, and the rage ended immediately and he was able to move into a calmer form of being upset. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think an honest angry response from someone who IS usually able to choose how to act can be powerful.  It’s reasonable, too. People DO get tired of over-the-top responses from a person.  And when a family pretends that bad behavior is okay, they become part of the problem.  By that I don’t mean that they should always point out the bad behavior, but neither should they say “No problem” about it.    Faking anger, or yelling in a cold-blooded attempt to shock a person isn’t the same as what’s described above—attempts to be calming, and then a loud exasperation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-it has affected his friendships.  He is a child I have worked with since he was young on developing social skills to get along with other kids.  Other kids want to play games, and he gets upset if he doesn&#39;t get his way or he loses.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
For a while, could you provide or recommend activities all the friends would enjoy that are less competitive?  Or maybe have a code word with your son so that if he’s getting angry, you can call him away from the game for a moment? And if calling him away from the game turns into you apologizing to the other kids and asking them if they want to finish the game without him, still it might save him some friendships.<br/>
<br/>
There were a few years when we avoided playing games with Kirby—when  he was 8, 9, maybe 10.  I would say I didn’t want to play if he was going to be angry about it.  So sometimes I gave him another chance and sometimes we ended the game early.  He didn’t want us to cheat to let him win.  He didn’t want Holly (five years younger than he is) to “play wrong.”  I used to let Holly make whatever move she wanted, on her turn, when she was too little to play, and even if it didn’t affect the other plays, it bothered him.  He wanted everyone to play right, and full-on, AND for him to be the winner.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe dice games would help a bit—dice can’t be controlled.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing we did with good benefit a few times was to play on teams, so that the adult on his team could comment on the likelihood of the next move, or discuss options for their team, and then voice “the team”’s response.  Kind of modelling better behavior, and partly keeping the emotion spread out and not focussed in one dangerous beam.<br/>
<br/>
We also helped him see when he was getting angry, and to help him breathe or stand up and stretch or something, to relax and let the adrenaline subside.<br/>
<br/>
But Kirby grew up to be a facilitator of other people’s gaming—was a Pokemon Gym Leader in the early card-tournament days, after he had played the game for a year or so at various book stores and gaming shops he was asked to oversee the game at a gaming shop, when he was 13.  They hired him when he was 14, so he was getting paid, and he went on to help organize and judge Magic the Gathering tournaments, and other Collectible Card events.  Later, he was a gamemaster for World of Warcraft, and was promoted to help train, oversee and encourage other gamemasters.<br/>
<br/>
So an intense interest in games, even in a kid who’s volatile, still might be the beginning of a life of peaceful gaming. :-)<br/>

The same biochemistry and quick adrenaline might be at play, but it’s possible that the dad had experiences that solidified his behaviors, and the son won’t have them.  Or it’s possible that the dad was not helped to see options, and the son IS being helped.<br/>

Watching his favorite YouTubers has been impactful in him handling his big feelings and reactions. They definitely still occur, but more and more often, he is willing and able to think of a situation in which Markiplier, Pewdiepie, Jack Septiceye (among others) handled a tough situation and to consider it. Recently, he was watching a YouTuber (his name is Corey but I can&#39;t think of the name of his channel) who moved to Alaska with his girlfriend and was experiencing somewhat of a culture shock. My son talked about how great it was that Corey could talk about his likes and dislikes and be willing to live in a new place even though it came with some discomfort. He said &quot;Maybe this will help other people see that new things can be good even if they are hard.&quot;<div><br></div><div>Another quick example - my daughter is 10 and when she needs to release some big feelings, she often watches or listens to sad stories/music on YouTube to help her access her feelings, and then comes to me and cries and shares how the music or video led to her thinking about her feelings.

Youtube is very useful; my kids spend loads of time doing many things online or using apps. They also talk to me about their needs- we hang out basically all the time- and they are usually positive and excited about their days and opportunities to do things, go places. I make sure they get time to relax and do their thing, and time to go out or socialize etc according to what is comfortable for them. We are introverts with lots of hobbies or interests, husband is an accommodating extrovert. <br/>
<br/>
I have never, ever heard that they hate either of us or that life sucks ( blanket statement). Maybe do more. Maybe BE with him more.</div>

Anyway, from watching some of these YouTube gamers he began to gain a language that helped him navigate these situations. &nbsp;He&#39;s developed a sort of &quot;spice&quot; that he has woven into his being, which allows him to remain his sweet laid back self, but also let kids know when he needs to that he is not to be messed with. &nbsp;He is respectful and clear and holds his space powerfully. He and I talk about how he feels on his teams and in competitions, we stay in dialog about it and he tells me he feels much more confident in these circles and hasn&#39;t wanted me to hover in a while. &nbsp;I was really surprised and didn&#39;t expect this type of learning from you-tube and this isn&#39;t the only example.. &nbsp;In the very beginning I had &quot;that Waldorfy Unschooler&quot; mentality which (tongue in cheek, but not really) felt all screens were evil. &nbsp;So it has been a beautiful opening that my son has gifted me, simply by being allowed to be and explore as he needs. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602006456">I have one child who screams &quot;I hate you!&quot; and one child who has never done that. It&#39;s a personality thing. The more volatile child needs space when he&#39;s angry; the more I try to fix it, the worse it is. When it happens I will tell him once, in the moment or not, that I don&#39;t like being spoken to like that. But I also know that he won&#39;t do it forever because his ability to communicate with words in the moment gets better all the time. If a child&#39;s emotions are ahead of their language, they can get really frustrated. I would imagine that even a ten year old, especially one with really strong emotions, could be short of words for his feelings. <div><br></div><div>It seems like kids are really emotionally resourceful. If you fill their cup completely, they get another cup! If no one fills the cup, they get used to an unfilled cup. So when I see that my kids have an unfilled cup, sometimes I have to assess whether it is in my power to fix the problem, or whether I have to just hang out with them and be with their problem with them, or whether they need space to navigate the problem themselves. My kids both need a lot of space. Most of what I can do is just acknowledge the crisis, express my feelings, and let it rest. </div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744004243">-=-It seems like kids are really emotionally resourceful. If you fill their cup completely, they get another cup! If no one fills the cup, they get used to an unfilled cup. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is not good unschooling advice.  You’ve set up a situation that suggests that emotional support is measurable and there can be more than a full cup.  Please don’t create constructs that aren’t defensible, or that aren’t clear.  Clarity is very important.<br/>
<br/>
If a mother is not providing some sort of support, it’s not good for the family.  A child who is used to an unfilled cup can become a danger to himself and others.  I don’t see a benefit in the analogy; I see flaws.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are problems with “have to” and with “just.”  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-So when I see that my kids have an unfilled cup, sometimes I have to assess whether it is in my power to fix the problem, or whether I have to just hang out with them and be with their problem with them, or whether they need space to navigate the problem themselves. My kids both need a lot of space. Most of what I can do is just acknowledge the crisis, express my feelings, and let it rest. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
A crisis shouldn’t be “an unfilled cup.”  <br/>
<br/>
If a child is expressing himself to others in a harmful way—in a way that hurts him as a person, and that can hurt those who hear it—a parent who doesn’t attempt to help him see the problem is no, in my opinion, being a good partner. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the problem can’t be fixed immediately, but “just” hanging out if negativity is huge seems to me to condone, accept, encourage.<br/>

<br/>
If they’re not aware of the strength of the words, they shouldn’t use them.  <br/>
<br/>
If I hit someone with my car, it doesn’t matter that I didn’t mean to.<br/>
If someone says something hurtful or harsh, or something that could (honestly, in some cases) harm the family’s reputation or acceptance among friends, or that could offend grandparents or neighbors or whatever, it’s not cool for the mom to calmly accept it.  <br/>
<br/>
I know a family whose youngish child watches videos with bad language but the original deal with the parents was that he could watch them IF he didn’t repeat the bad language. It was an easy, sensible deal to make and he stuck by it without difficulty or hardship.<br/>
<br/>
If any parent here is thinking that unschoolers should, or must, or have to allow children to use bad language or to say “my life sucks” or “I hate you” to a mother, please don’t think so.  And those who have for ANY reason come to think it’s no big deal, please reconsider.<br/>

Still he shrugs me off as if he&#39;s thinking I misunderstand his generation of language nuances.  And maybe he is right.  <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would say that he can be as negative as he wants when he’s grown and elsewhere, but that it’s not a good thing to do in your home, where it can hurt your feelings, or among your friends where it can harm your reputation.  If he’s old enough to discuss it, he’s old enough to be a partner in a solution.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I remind him that the story he tells about his life will shape it to a degree.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That is an understatement.  Negativity IS negativity.  It’s not “to a degree” negativity.  It’s pollution of the air, of the soul, of the relationships.  <br/>
<br/>
Just because “his generation” is that way doesn’t mean parents “have to” accept, hear, encourage it.<br/>

      <p>-=-It seems like kids are really emotionally resourceful. If you fill their cup completely, they get another cup! If no one fills the cup, they get used to an unfilled cup. -=-<br>
<br>
This is not good unschooling advice.  You’ve set up a situation that suggests that emotional support is measurable and there can be more than a full cup.  Please don’t create constructs that aren’t defensible, or that aren’t clear.  Clarity is very important.<br>
<br>
If a mother is not providing some sort of support, it’s not good for the family.  A child who is used to an unfilled cup can become a danger to himself and others.  I don’t see a benefit in the analogy; I see flaws.<br>
<br>
There are problems with “have to” and with “just.”  <br>
<br>
-=-So when I see that my kids have an unfilled cup, sometimes I have to assess whether it is in my power to fix the problem, or whether I have to just hang out with them and be with their problem with them, or whether they need space to navigate the problem themselves. My kids both need a lot of space. Most of what I can do is just acknowledge the crisis, express my feelings, and let it rest. <br>
-=-<br>
<br>
A crisis shouldn’t be “an unfilled cup.”  <br>
<br>
If a child is expressing himself to others in a harmful way—in a way that hurts him as a person, and that can hurt those who hear it—a parent who doesn’t attempt to help him see the problem is no, in my opinion, being a good partner. <br>
<br>
Perhaps the problem can’t be fixed immediately, but “just” hanging out if negativity is huge seems to me to condone, accept, encourage.<br>

Possibly, but I don’t think so.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think this is possibly a jump to conclusions without knowing more about the child or that family&#39;s dynamics.  My son is 9 and actually learned these phrases and some of the contexts in which they are used from watching YouTube gamers.  He&#39;s taken interest in YouTube in the recent past (about 6 months ago or so) and now says these things when he looses a game or is frustrated about something else.  My kid loves his life and says so all the time. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Is this about a child who loves his life and says so all the time?<br/>
That cannot also be a child who says “I hate you” (to a parent) and “My life sucks.”<br/>
<br/>

You did not “instantly have to” but you chose to.  If you’re thinking, and writing, and posting “have to” you’re not looking at choices.  Please catch any “have to” you’re about to post and rephrase.<br/>

<br/>
Either you’ve misunderstood me or are misrepresenting me.<br/>
<br/>
I didn’t ask you to keep talking at him.  I never ask anyone to “talk at” anyone.<br/>
When he is NOT asking you for space, ask if he hates you. If he does, change things up.  If he doesn’t, ask him not to say it.<br/>
<br/>
That’s talking to, not talking at.<br/>
<br/>
Very many parents talk too much.<br/>
Lots are sweet and sing-songy to their children even whether the children are being sweet and thoughtful or loud and rude.  It’s not a way to help children be more reasonable.  <br/>
<br/>
NOT helping a child see that words can harm is not being a good partner.  If the words “I hate you” don’t bother you, how will he learn not to say it to his dad or grandparents, siblings, cousins, neighbors?<br/>
<br/>
There are easy, direct possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
“I hate you.”<br/>
<br/>
“I hope you don’t; I love you.”  And no more.  Don’t stay, don’t encourage, don’t “talk at” (and please don’t suggest that I have asked you to “talk at” anyone).<br/>
<br/>
Words DO matter.  I’m glad for people to share stories, but words do matter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632890898">Hi there, I was the one who post about my son saying &quot;I hate you&quot; and &quot;My life sucks&quot; at times when he is angry. I&#39;d like to clarify and offer some more info; from the responses to my post, I think maybe I didn&#39;t include enough info. When my own nervous system is hyper-aroused and I&#39;m having huge feelings, I sometimes have thoughts similar to the ones my son expresses when he&#39;s angry. I don&#39;t say them aloud, though, and I am quickly able to shift my perspective from that level of negativity. He is less able to do that, at age 8, than I am at age 38.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">When he&#39;s happy, he readily expresses how much he loves his life and he often tells my husband and me how much he loves us.

He knows his words have an affect on others but talking at any length to him when he is flooded with big feelings is not helpful. Later, when he&#39;s calm, we sometimes talk about it while we are snuggling or playing but not every time. Sometimes, we answer with something very absurd and silly and it helps us move to a less negative space.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>My 10 year old has occasionally said similar things when she is very upset but very rarely these days...it was something she did more when she was younger.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>Clarissa</div><div><br></div><div><br><div><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1632890898ygroups-quoted"><br><br>---In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote :<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1632890898ygrps-yiv-2065388367">-=--I think this is possibly a jump to conclusions without knowing more about the child or that family&#39;s dynamics. -=-<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219565397">A couple of times when Kirby was young (+/- 11?) he expressed himself in what seemed too loud and negative a way and I said okay, then where DO you want to live?  I made a couple of concrete suggestions, with a relative (by name) or a friend (by name).  I said if that would be better we could provide money to help them with groceries and he could live there.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, I felt better letting him know there might actually be options.  Then when he was calmer he felt a bit that he was choosing to stay home—choosing not to pursue those options.  And he probably thought about them, and decided it wasn’t so bad where he was (compared to the nearish and stated alternatives).  At the same time, I tried to amend the factors that were frustrating him (sometimes having to do with younger siblings, or scheduling, or something I could help with to stave off a future problem).<br/>
<br/>
When someone feels stuck or crowded or powerless in some aspect, the pressure can build up and blast out in a seemingly unrelated direction.  Rather than accepting the blow-ups, backing up to what happened before that might help.  Hunger?  Lack of sleep?  Need for physical activitiy or more down time / alone time, in some people, can bring them near tears.<br/>
