<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389125545">well i just had to pop in on this discussion...but first let me <br/>
introduce myself...<br/>
<br/>
my name is tina and i am mommy to maeven, who will be 5 in november and <br/>
whom i just started loosely homeschooling, tend to lean towards <br/>
unschooling and have always had what i consider an enriching environment <br/>
at home with lots of books and art supplies available and only <br/>
open-ended toys that encourage imaginative play...which i would consider <br/>
an unschooling environment....lots of interesting things to explore on <br/>
her time at her own pace... and mommy to baelin, who is our angel baby <br/>
boy, fullterm stillborn. born in april 2004 8lbs 12oz and never took a <br/>
breath and no one knows why. and last but not least, tyren (TEAR-en), <br/>
our new baby boy who is a little over 2 months old now.<br/>
<br/>
i am a wahm (work at home mom) in that i have several home businesses, <br/>
all of which are online, that i do both for the money (small amount <br/>
though it is...but i&#39;m always trying to increase that) and for the joy <br/>
they bring me...they are my hobbies and work at the same time. :) <br/>
<br/>
and i am a flylady dropout. :)  i cannot seem to get a grip on my house <br/>
and am regularly stressed about it but keep trying. if i can get a <br/>
handle of this darn house (not to be perfectly spotless, mind you, but <br/>
to be free of all the mounds of clutter and dirtiness that we are living <br/>
in now that i don&#39;t feel is good for any of us) that my <br/>
unschooling/homeschooling will be all the better. :)<br/>
<br/>
now about names...you&#39;ve just read my children&#39;s names... maeven, <br/>
baelin, tyren....i dared anyone to challenge our names as we came up <br/>
with them, lol! we didn&#39;t really run them by my dh&#39;s family because i <br/>
knew they&#39;d think we were weird (they have to think that i&#39;ve just <br/>
corrupted their once normal son/brother, lol! i think they think i&#39;m <br/>
this weirdo hippie...heck i think being called a hippie is a compliment <br/>
but i am so not a hippie in so many ways...they don&#39;t even know what a <br/>
hippie is if they call me one, lol!) but my family has always supported <br/>
our choices...anyway what cracked me up was when we were thinking of <br/>
names for baelin and my mil told my dh that we shouldn&#39;t pick an unusual <br/>
name because children hate having unusual names because they will get <br/>
picked on. (her name is mary eloise and she&#39;s always gone by eloise...i <br/>
guess she thinks that&#39;s unusual) that just amused and irked me at the <br/>
same time...because we already had maeven, whom she never said a word <br/>
about the name and if she did i may have to hit her because i think her <br/>
name is about the most beautiful name on the planet! and so what was she <br/>
saying about our choice there because its definitely unusual...guess its <br/>
her way of disapproving of our choices...but anyway how in the world <br/>
could we go with a typical name like mike or sue after we had maeven? LOL!<br/>
<br/>
plus...nowadays i think the unusual names are becoming usual and the <br/>
normal names of the past are less common! LOL! just in our circle of <br/>
friends we have a tahlia, madhava, theo, thea, seren, clement, thor, <br/>
shraddha, and greydon.  maeven & tyren blend in well, LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617141191">Hi Tina, <br/>
<br/>
I just joined the loop a little while ago and was looking for mothers <br/>
working at home...good luck to you with your business - it looks <br/>
wonderful.  I&#39;m so glad to hear from other moms who are working from <br/>
home and unschooling and from moms whose partners aren&#39;t fully pro-<br/>
home schooling/unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My name is carol and my daughters, lily, 6 and kit, 4 1/2 are in the <br/>
public school&#39;s kindergarten and pre-k programs.  I enrolled them <br/>
because my husband isn&#39;t supportive of unschooling (yet) and the <br/>
private schools i&#39;ve looked at don&#39;t fit.  He was hoping i&#39;d restart <br/>
a career when they were in full-time. (what does it say that if i won <br/>
the lottery, the first thing i would do is keep my kids home or start <br/>
a school?)! <br/>
<br/>
My husband says, let&#39;s try the public school til it fails us - <br/>
meaning until the girls get into trouble as teenagers?  I&#39;m telling <br/>
him, it already fails me - aside from 10 minutes &quot;table time,&quot; no <br/>
play time in kindergarten, too much reprimanding, too much <br/>
regimentation, testing, etc., etc. - just doesn&#39;t fit my values or <br/>
world view. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m following the advice of one of the other mothers who said she <br/>
leaves articles around the house and i&#39;m working on manifesting even <br/>
more abundance in our lives.  I hope to do something creative from <br/>
home that the kids might even help with, so thanks Tina for the <br/>
inspiration!  <br/>
<br/>
So glad to find this site, Carol<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
