<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199247192">I think the social schedule depends on the child. It doesn&#39;t matter if<br/>
they&#39;re in school or not. I think the child should really love and want<br/>
to do what they are doing. I&#39;ve seen my own SIL who has kids in school<br/>
make them take a sport or music lesson because she feels like they<br/>
should have something to do. I&#39;ve seen many parents do this to their<br/>
children and yes some of them are homeschoolers. Maybe they are trying<br/>
to &quot;make up&quot; for something they feel is missing. I have also seen kids<br/>
that really want to do a lot and they have something going on every<br/>
night of the week. IMO, that&#39;s too much, even though they enjoy it. I<br/>
think following the child is the key and then moderation. <br/>

Well, I think it sounds great if your child likes it. My unschooler friend<br/>
Dawn goes to lots of stuff like dance, 4-H, etc. and loves it. However I<br/>
have another friends (homeschooled the veeeeery structured way) who&#39;s mother<br/>
makes her do all these activities to keep her busy -- that&#39;s why I never see<br/>
her anymore! :-( Activities are probably a good thing except when the parent<br/>
goes in overdrive, trying to make the child/teen do everything :} I&#39;d say to<br/>
you not to worry, though. :) ~Eryn<br/>

Definitely! My 8yo is a social butterfly and joins everything she can. She <br/>
wakes up in the morning and immediately wants to know what we are doing and <br/>
where we are going. My 6yo likes to take dance and swimming lessons, but she <br/>
prefers to stay home and hang out (kind of like me). <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well... Kim... My brother and sister both have their three kids in public<br/>
school.. ages vary from 2nd grad to Senior in high school next year.  All of<br/>
the kids are in so many extra curricular activities that they are seldom<br/>
home, from early morning till later evening, and on the weekends, they are<br/>
gone all the time.  I don&#39;t see how they can get their homework done!!  My<br/>
brothers kids are all in soccer, several teams each, and some track and<br/>
field.  My sisters kids are in various sports, clubs, and band.  Me I don&#39;t<br/>
get it.  I want my boys to have one or two extra out side classes a year..<br/>
but I&#39;m not getting as fanatical about it as my brother and sister.  Yikes,<br/>
I want a life too!  I want my kids to sit down and play a game with me once<br/>
in a while!  LOL!  I think really.. socialization is something that ya just<br/>
have to relax about.  If they want to be with more kids, they let you<br/>
know... if their extra activities are too much for them, they&#39;ll let you<br/>
know.  Just be open to listening to their wants and needs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This has been a concern in our family, but my mom and I came to realization<br/>
that I&#39;ve *always* LEARNED through socialization -- I&#39;m a &quot;talker&quot;, I find it<br/>
really hard to grasp anything if I can&#39;t talk it out with someone, which is<br/>
probably why I have a little more trouble with math than other subjects --<br/>
it&#39;s not as easy to talk about. In any case, my friends and I talk about some<br/>
&quot;intellectual&quot; things and that&#39;s helpful for obvious reasons, but even other<br/>
than that... I don&#39;t know how old your daughter is, so it may be kind of a<br/>
different issue, but I DO think it&#39;s natural for teenagers to be interested in<br/>
their friends, almost beyond their interest for anything else -- particuarly<br/>
teenage girls. It&#39;s important to keep other interests, and it sounds like if<br/>
she&#39;d doing cheerleading and softball, those are individual interests as well<br/>
as being socialization, and that&#39;s a great &quot;compromise&quot; -- I take drama,<br/>
classes, and do all kinds of education type things with my friends, so I can<br/>
hang out with them and &quot;learn&quot; in a quantifiable way... Although I think I&#39;m<br/>
learning w/ my frineds all the time anyway.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i suppose some folks do try to overcompensate--they do that everywhere. As <br/>
for us, my 11yo dd rides horses(and would live in the barn were that an <br/>
option!!), and takes fiddle lessons. My 7 1/2 yo dd takes karate twice <br/>
weekly.  They have 4H.<br/>
  This summer the 11 yo will do a 6 week twice weekly karate program and the <br/>
7 1/2 yo want to go to Cloverbud(4H) camp.  <br/>
 Busy? Yes. But the busy-ness also flows--some times we&#39;re doing lots and <br/>
other times we&#39;re homebodies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187580152">I think it&#39;s ironic how people &quot;outside&quot; of homeschooling worry about<br/>
our kids missing the &quot;socialization&quot; that public schooling (apparently)<br/>
provides, when the truth of the matter is, kids in public school are<br/>
FOREVER being punished precisely BECAUSE of &quot;socialization!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Johnny, since you enjoy talking with your neighbor so much, you can<br/>
stay after class and clean the chalkboard.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Susie, my classroom is NOT the place to visit with your friend; that<br/>
should take place AFTER school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Billy, being tardy for my class because you were visiting with your<br/>
friends in the hall will NOT be tolerated.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422945804">Cordelia: As a rebuttal to the socialization question (gently) ask your dh<br/>
how many friends he still has from school.  My guess is that he is not<br/>
still friends with anyone from his school days and that&#39;s a strong<br/>
indication (to me at least) that the type of socialization one gets from<br/>
school is not worth much.  School really &quot;pays&quot; no dividends in life long<br/>
friends.  For me, the people I&#39;m still friends with (or remember) from my<br/>
childhood are the friends I made from my dance classes -- I made those<br/>
friends outside of school -- and we became friends because of our common<br/>
and shared interests.  Being inmates together :)  is not a good way to<br/>
form friendships!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649063234">The thing that I love the most about our girls being &#39;socialized&#39; at home<br/>
is that now (after 6 years of hsing) they have no qualms talking to anyone<br/>
of any age; a &#39;Nana&#39; shopping for groceries, a family visiting the park, a<br/>
baby playing in the sand on the beach, all ages and stages. Our girls do<br/>
not define their socializing experience to just their own age (and stage)<br/>
group. They absolutely love the freedoms that homeschooling have given them<br/>
to make friends of all ages. Their &#39;socialization&#39; has developed in them a<br/>
love and respect and empathy for others.  In the big picture of<br/>
&#39;life&#39;...that is true  socialization.<br/>
<br/>
Oxford Dictionary;<br/>
sociable...&quot;...inclined to seek and enjoy the company of others; disposed<br/>
to be friendly or  affable in  company; willling to converse in a pleasant<br/>
manner...&quot;<br/>
Socialize  &quot;...to render social&quot;<br/>
Social     &quot; capable of being associated or united to others...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And listen to this description in the dictionary for social...I love it!<br/>
social  &quot;...of plants: growing in a wild state in patches or masses with<br/>
other members of the same species, esp. so as to cover a large area&quot;<br/>
lovely....<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking that after years of homeschooling that our daughters can now<br/>
receive an A+ in socialization. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Carry on...growing in wild and beautiful patches....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761480691">A homeschooling father was being interviewed by the local newspaper<br/>
reporter, who asked him all sorts of questions about curriculum,<br/>
schedules, athletics, and so forth.  But, of course, after all this, <br/>
the report had to ask THE question---&quot;What about socialization?&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
The father replied, &quot;We make sure he has the EXACTLY the same level of<br/>
socialization as he would get if he were in public school.&quot;<br/>

The reporter asked, &quot;How do you do that?&quot;<br/>
