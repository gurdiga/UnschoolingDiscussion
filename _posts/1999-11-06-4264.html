<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378877918">I think it is the relationship between Arthur and his sister and how she is<br/>
portrayed that I don&#39;t like.  Then again maybe I am thinking of some other show.<br/>
I do know that I don&#39;t like many values that are displayed on Arthur. Syrupy<br/>
doesn&#39;t faze me.  I like all sorts of over sentimentalized stuff which probably<br/>
sickens people with subtler tastes.  Every once in a while programs irritate me<br/>
when they throw in gratuitous death and disease just to yank on the heart<br/>
strings.<br/>
<br/>
Generally Michael Landonesque stories make me cry, for the most part unashamedly.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  How about &quot;Arthur&quot; for revolting?<br/>
&gt;    &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Believe it or not, my kids love Arthur! I don&#39;t think it is a hurtful<br/>
&gt;  show....they certainly promote reading, anyway. I am accentuating that<br/>
&gt;  positive! LOL<br/>
&gt;  Blessings, Lori in TX &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And, while Arthur does get a little syrup-y for me sometimes, I think it&#39;s OK<br/>
&gt; for my kids to know that most kids do go to school.  They are in the minority<br/>
&gt; after all.  And some shows (like Magic School Bus - and we love the books)<br/>
&gt; are so good that the whole school thing is a minor part of it.<br/>
