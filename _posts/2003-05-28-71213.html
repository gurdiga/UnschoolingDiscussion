<br/>
to help her see things from other people&#39;s perspectives.  Maybe just <br/>
<br/>
taking it incident by incident is all I can do.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe when you can talk to her in advance about how to act so she doesn&#39;t <br/>
make people feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  We went to a wedding in a chapel which is a memorial to veterans.  <br/>
I told Holly it would be a very bad place to make any war jokes.<br/>
<br/>
Does she miss other emotional clues?  Does she miss jokes, or not know when <br/>
someone&#39;s just sad or grumpy?  If so, I have two thoughts.  One, that she&#39;s <br/>
really young, and two, it might just be a lack of &quot;interpersonal intelligence&quot; <br/>
(in Gardner&#39;s terminology).  If that&#39;s so, then she might just need more <br/>
briefings or advice on how to act in various situations until she comes to understand <br/>
more on her own.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think many six year olds are very savvy about stressful situations, <br/>
though, and they DO have short attention spans, so even those who are <br/>
especially perceptive won&#39;t last an hour in one state of mind.   Some might freak and <br/>
some might just shut down.   <br/>
<br/>
Compassion is probably a pretty mature emotion.  Some things seem like parts <br/>
of compassion, like pity and fear and queasiness, but I think compassion is <br/>
higher and more philosophical than those things.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry, just coach her not to make things worse, and try not to be <br/>
angry with  her.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about your dad.  Back surgery is always very scary.  Keith had one at <br/>
18 years old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457684137">I was wondering that too about my own children. Though, I used to have very<br/>
little compassion for people, myself. Then when I dropped out of high school<br/>
(lol) and started learning more about other people, I started to really have<br/>
compassion on everyone... including some people who were very very mean to<br/>
me. <br/>
This is JMO, but I think it has to do with not being able to put yourself in<br/>
others place. Hopefully she will learn this, as I did. I hope this helps a<br/>
bit. I don&#39;t know about your religious convictions, but as a Believer,<br/>
following the life of Christ really helped me a lot as well. (I hope that&#39;s<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Compassion<br/>
 <br/>
I am not sure where to start with this, so I guess I will get right <br/>
to the question:  Is compassion something you can learn?  Is it <br/>
something a 6yo can learn?  Do some people just have it, and others <br/>
don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
Background:  My daughter is a very factual, literal, not-overly-<br/>
emotional child.  She is very lacking in intuition or compassion.  <br/>
She does not notice, or at least she does not seem affected by, <br/>
people in pain (physical or emotional.)  (She has millions of <br/>
wonderful qualities, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they are not the ones I <br/>
am concerned about.)<br/>
<br/>
She does not realize when something she does is hurtful until I <br/>
really sit her down and explain it.  Then she is very remorseful.  <br/>
That, I figure, may come with time.  What concerns me more is how <br/>
unaffected she is by people in pain.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, one morning during her gymnastics class I almost passed <br/>
out, and had to lay down on a mat and several people were gathered <br/>
around me.  It was near the end of class so the instructor led the <br/>
class to a side room so that they wouldn&#39;t see what was going on.  <br/>
(Although they had to walk by me to get there.)  Most of the kids had <br/>
looks on their faces like they were worried or wondering what was <br/>
going on.  All my daughter was concerned about was telling me she is <br/>
thirsty, can she get a drink.  The other kids all picked up on the <br/>
idea that something was wrong, but not her.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to tonight:  My dad had back surgery yesterday, and it <br/>
was a much more serious operation than any of us realized.  So <br/>
finally tonight he was moved out of recovery and into surgical <br/>
intensive care unit, so we went to visit him.  I took her, partly <br/>
because I knew it wouldn&#39;t phase her, partly because I was hoping it <br/>
would.  When we walked into his room, she asked, &quot;Is that Papa?&quot; <br/>
because he really looked different.  He was coming in and out of <br/>
consciousness, and kept wanting to change position (which hurt him <br/>
tremendously) and was trying to pull at his many tubes, so they had <br/>
to restrain him.  It was really pitiful.  But even in the midst of <br/>
it, all she was worried about was whether she would be home in time <br/>
for a tv show.  Then she asked why we were staying so long (about 40 <br/>
minutes) and I finally went over and explained to her that he had <br/>
been there all by himself (without family, anyway) all day, and he <br/>
was in pain, and then I asked her to think about what she would want <br/>
if she were in pain in a strange place.  I saw a glimmer of <br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect her to ever be an overly-compassionate, merciful type <br/>
of person.  But I do wonder if there is something I should be doing <br/>
to help her see things from other people&#39;s perspectives.  Maybe just <br/>
taking it incident by incident is all I can do.  I know I am in a lot <br/>
of conflict right now just over seeing my dad like that, so maybe I <br/>
am making more of this than I should.  I don&#39;t know.  I would <br/>
appreciate any thoughts.<br/>
<br/>

PS:  She did cry when she watched ET and Air Bud, so it is in there <br/>
somewhere.  Mainly for animals and extraterrestrials, though, it <br/>
seems.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that is funny that you bring up Gardner&#39;s interpersonal <br/>
intelligence because I was in a lecture this weekend that talked <br/>
about the different intelligences, and I felt that interpersonal is <br/>
one of her stronger ones.  I found a short definition as follows:  <br/>
<br/>
Interpersonal:  Children who are leaders among their peers, who are <br/>
good at communicating and who seem to understand others&#39; feelings and <br/>
motives possess interpersonal intelligence. <br/>
<br/>
She is so strong on the first two parts, and completely lacking on <br/>
the third.  In almost any group situation, she falls into the role of <br/>
leader, and most of the other kids are drawn to her in that <br/>
position.  But it is a no-nonsense type of leadership.  She is big on <br/>
things being fair--to anyone, not just her.  She is way beyond her <br/>
years in communication.  But boy, understanding others&#39; feelings, <br/>
well, that just doesn&#39;t even occur to her.<br/>
<br/>
I did talk to her before we went to the hospital.  I didn&#39;t make it a <br/>
real big deal, just explained that Papa had an operation on his <br/>
back.  <br/>
She asked what they did, so I told her that they cut open his lower <br/>
back and put in a long metal rod and ten 3&quot; screws into his bone.  <br/>
She made a face, then asked if she would have to have that surgery <br/>
when she was old, and I told her probably not, then she seemed fine <br/>
with it.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess compassion is a bit much to expect of her.  But I would have <br/>
expected to see a little bit of uneasiness with the situation.  I did <br/>
think about how she would probably make a good surgeon, something I <br/>
would be way too queasy to do.  She would just lack in those bedside <br/>
manners.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks.  None of us realized what bad shape his back was in.  Not <br/>
even the doctor.  When he actually got into his back and saw what it <br/>
looked like, he said that the only people he had ever seen with backs <br/>
that bad were invalids due to the pain.  (He was just out digging and <br/>
installing a water line three days before surgery.)  He has such a <br/>
high pain tolerance.  I think that is what makes it so hard to see <br/>
him in pain, just knowing how bad it must be.  But he was on morphine <br/>
and was about to get his next valium dose when we left, so he should <br/>
be feeling better now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325575237">I think compassion is both &quot;learned&quot; through experience and maturity as well <br/>
as a personality/character trait.   As adults, some folks are just more <br/>
compassionate and sensitive to others feelings than others.    I have seen the same <br/>
diversity in children.  One child may cry and show empathy if someone is hurt, <br/>
even a &quot;not close&quot; playmate.  Another one may show little concern if thier <br/>
own parent or sibling gets hurt.<br/>
<br/>
  My niece has always been super sensitive to others pain.  From as young as <br/>
1 yr old ( no kidding, I saw it myself first hand), she would pass out if  she <br/>
saw someone get hurt.  She is 8 now and she has learned to stop her passing <br/>
out because she can feel it coming, and she knows what situations cause her to <br/>
pass out.  Most recently, my mom stumped her toe over at my sis&#39; house and my <br/>
niece had to go out of the room to keep from passing out.  She was very <br/>
concerned when my grandpa died recently.  She really didnt know grandpa that well, <br/>
but her heart was just broken because her Grandma&#39;s daddy died.  She didn&#39;t go <br/>
to the funeral because she didn&#39;t want to see her Grandma so sad.  My nephew ( <br/>
different sister&#39;s child) who was 5 when Grandpa died.. he  sobbed at <br/>
Grandpa&#39;s funeral.   He is a really compassionate child too.  <br/>
<br/>
The story about your daughter not being too concerned about your Dad&#39;s <br/>
surgery reminded me of Landon when I had Jon Phillip.  I had forgotten all about <br/>
this, but a few days ago we were watching old home videos.  I was in the hospital <br/>
after having JP.  I called Landon on the phone to tell him about the arrival <br/>
of his baby brother.  He had been in school that day and his aunt picked him <br/>
up.  He didnt know I had had JP.  His reaction??  He was mad at me because I <br/>
was supposed to take him to Toys R us to get a new toy.  He was 8, and <br/>
obviously, his own self interests were more important than the fact that I was lying <br/>
flat on my back in the hospital from giving birth... LOL.     My sister took him <br/>
to Toys R us and they stopped back by the hospital on the way home.  Landon <br/>
was thrilled with his new toy.  The new baby?  Ahh, been there, done that, he <br/>
was not impressed.    He was ( still is) a great big brother.  But he has <br/>
always been more of a self focused person.    He IS compassionate, but mostly just <br/>
towards people/things that affect him personally.    I do not see that as <br/>
flawed.  I just see it as  part of his personality.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a child, I was ALWAYS sticking up for the underdog, or unliked kid, in <br/>
class.  I even have memories of this in 1st grade...being friends with anyone and <br/>
going out of my way to play with kids no one else wanted to be around.  <br/>
<br/>
Although I think much of it was just my personality, I know both my parents <br/>
were models of compassion.  My father was very soft spoken, almost a Mr. Rogers <br/>
type.  Would almost cry when my sister or I were hurt and would hold us <br/>
close.  Almost EVERY SINGLE time he got angry with us, he would later come to our <br/>
room later and apologize...even if he was right to be mad!!   I can also <br/>
remember my mom crying when she heard a neighbor man had died.  She kept saying she <br/>
felt awful for his son, only 8 years old.  We were also avid readers of <br/>
National Geographic and often saw the disturbing pictures of the lives many &quot;less <br/>
fortunate&quot; kids lived.<br/>
<br/>
I think the hard lives my parents lived as children taught them compassion, <br/>
and they passed it on to me.  My mother&#39;s dad left when she was young (about <br/>
5), she was molested by an uncle, very poor much of her life.  My father&#39;s dad <br/>
died when he was only 8 and he and his brother were raised by their mother <br/>
alone.  She was a nurse, so maybe her compassion and caring for people rubbed off <br/>
on them.  <br/>
<br/>
I also wonder if having siblings helps &quot;breed&quot; compassion.  I know my <br/>
children would bicker quite a bit when they were little, but when someone else got <br/>
hurt they cried as much as the injured child!!<br/>

&lt;&lt;I think compassion is both &quot;learned&quot; through experience and maturity as<br/>
well<br/>
as a personality/character trait.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well this has me thinking about something I never really have before. I<br/>
guess maybe it does have something to do with each persons experience, where<br/>
they were personally when they had those experiences and just who they are<br/>
in general. I was always very compassionate about animals. Hearing awful<br/>
things concerning people never bothered me. I mean I didn&#39;t think it was &quot;no<br/>
big deal&quot; but it never hit me as terribly sad. Have it be an animal, and<br/>
that was a whole different story. Well into my adult life, I was still the<br/>
same. Now forget about it, half the country songs out there send me to<br/>
tears. I&#39;m a total mush now. I know having my children had a lot to do with<br/>
my compassion level with other people. My age seems to be a factor also.<br/>
<br/>
With younger children, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it though. I think<br/>
maybe quite a few of them don&#39;t really &quot;get it&quot; when they are younger. I<br/>
think it&#39;s a good thing really and rather protects them.<br/>
<br/>
Tara has always been compassionate about animals and people from early on.<br/>
She sobbed hysterically the first time she watched Rudolph the Red Nosed<br/>
Reindeer. She was 2 and it was the part where Rudolph goes off by himself<br/>
because he feels so left out. Relatives that have died, ones she&#39;s hardly<br/>
knows affect her deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph and Sierra are a different story. I remember when they were around 3<br/>
and 4 and one of our pets had died at home. It was unexpected and very<br/>
sudden. I was alone with the kids, waiting for Joe to come home and take the<br/>
dog to the vets and she died in my arms. I was sobbing and here I had to<br/>
kids just running around and having the time of their life. I didn&#39;t want<br/>
them to hurt too, but it was hard for me to handle the situation with them<br/>
having so much fun! The next day it was like, &quot;well Maxi&#39;s dead!&quot;  &quot;She&#39;s<br/>
dead!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They haven&#39;t really had many experiences to deal with though. My BIL died<br/>
recently and they just didn&#39;t get the impact it was having on the family.<br/>
They were close to him too. They knew how sick he was. They felt bad but it<br/>
was a fleeting feeling. I don&#39;t do funeral homes and Joe didn&#39;t think they<br/>
should go either. But at the service, a few times I broke down, they were<br/>
totally surprised and also looked very puzzled as to why I was upset. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t really bother me, I feel like it&#39;s their way of coping right now<br/>
that they are still young. They are different from Tara and I know the<br/>
degree of compassion they will have will eventually change too, just like<br/>
mine did.<br/>

&gt; dog to the vets and she died in my arms. I was sobbing and here I had to<br/>
&gt; kids just running around and having the time of their life. I didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; them to hurt too, but it was hard for me to handle the situation with them<br/>
&gt; having so much fun! The next day it was like, &quot;well Maxi&#39;s dead!&quot;  &quot;She&#39;s<br/>
&gt; dead!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That reminds me of my son. Tommy is 7 and fairly egocentric, as is right for <br/>
his age. My aged Belgian Tervuren died very suddenly one day, and I ran in the <br/>
house sobbing and carrying him, and cried loudly and long over his body.Tommy <br/>
peered over the edge of the gate, and said &quot;Sorry Mom&quot; and walked off and <br/>
played, no big deal. <br/>
However, when his favorite chicken was very sick and needed to be put down, <br/>
there was a huge crying and sobbing, when we came in from doing the deed, he <br/>
ran to me and said&quot;It seems so empty around here without Red!&quot;<br/>
I worked hard not to giggle, and we talked alot about the chicken. I <br/>
empathized with him, and we cuddled.I felt better that he did have feelings, but all <br/>
along, I was thinking&quot;you little nut, what about my damn dog!!!!!!!&quot;&lt;G&gt;<br/>
It seems to me that for children of that age, they are supposed to be very <br/>
self-concerned. I do find Tommy stickingup for people and animals as well.<br/>
Just my experience.<br/>

don&#39;t?***<br/>
<br/>
I think six is really young and compassion, like everything else, will<br/>
come in it&#39;s own time.  <br/>
Unschooling compassion.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Her level of understanding of the feelings of others will come with<br/>
experience.  If her experience so far has been that everything turns out<br/>
ok, then that&#39;s what she&#39;ll be assuming.   I think that&#39;s nice, actually.<br/>
 I think in a way it shows her faith that you&#39;ll always be there and<br/>
things will always be fine.   When was the last time any of us felt that<br/>
secure?<br/>
<br/>
We have cats and dogs and other critters and have always talked about<br/>
what makes them happy or sad.      We don&#39;t have animals living with us<br/>
as a lesson, they showed up and we opened the door, but I think showing<br/>
compassion every day for others has been an example for Dylan. <br/>
<br/>
We also live near elderly parents and other relatives.   We&#39;re frequently<br/>
busy doing something for them they&#39;re not able to do for themselves and<br/>
we talk about it.   We talk about our own lives and joys and<br/>
disappointments.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry.   She&#39;s little.  If you&#39;re a compassionate person and<br/>
do things for others, she&#39;ll notice eventually. <br/>
The next moth you take outside, the next time you fill the bird feeders,<br/>
the next pot of soup you take to a sick neighbor will give her more<br/>
information and more things to think about. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137484801">Just the fact that she cried during ET and Airbud is<br/>
huge to me. My first child, Molly has been diagnosed<br/>
with ADD and Nonverbal Learning Disability and who<br/>
knows what else (depends on the doc and day, I guess)<br/>
I was so fixated on her lack of compassion because<br/>
after all I am a clinical Social Worker who works in<br/>
teh field of compassion. How could I have a kid that<br/>
lacked in this area. Molly teaches me so much<br/>
everyday. She has taught me over the last year to just<br/>
give her time. She is now almost 11 and works with the<br/>
elderly as a volunteer experience (something she<br/>
wanted to do). She still rarely cries in movies and<br/>
stuff, we watched Rabbit Proof Fence the other day and<br/>
I cried my eyes out, she just sat through it and took<br/>
it all in. I know now though that this is just Molly&#39;s<br/>
way. She is very different than me, much funnier and<br/>
lighter and gosh, in some ways she sleeps a heck of a<br/>
lot better than I do at night! Kelli<br/>

&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Compassion<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I am not sure where to start with this, so I guess I<br/>
&gt; will get right <br/>
&gt; to the question:  Is compassion something you can<br/>
&gt; learn?  Is it <br/>
&gt; something a 6yo can learn?  Do some people just have<br/>
&gt; it, and others <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Background:  My daughter is a very factual, literal,<br/>
&gt; not-overly-<br/>
&gt; emotional child.  She is very lacking in intuition<br/>
&gt; or compassion.  <br/>
&gt; She does not notice, or at least she does not seem<br/>
&gt; affected by, <br/>
&gt; people in pain (physical or emotional.)  (She has<br/>
&gt; millions of <br/>
&gt; wonderful qualities, don&#39;t get me wrong, but they<br/>
&gt; are not the ones I <br/>
&gt; am concerned about.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She does not realize when something she does is<br/>
&gt; hurtful until I <br/>
&gt; really sit her down and explain it.  Then she is<br/>
&gt; very remorseful.  <br/>
&gt; That, I figure, may come with time.  What concerns<br/>
&gt; me more is how <br/>
&gt; unaffected she is by people in pain.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For instance, one morning during her gymnastics<br/>
&gt; class I almost passed <br/>
&gt; out, and had to lay down on a mat and several people<br/>
&gt; were gathered <br/>
&gt; around me.  It was near the end of class so the<br/>
&gt; instructor led the <br/>
&gt; class to a side room so that they wouldn&#39;t see what<br/>
&gt; was going on.  <br/>
&gt; (Although they had to walk by me to get there.) <br/>
&gt; Most of the kids had <br/>
&gt; looks on their faces like they were worried or<br/>
&gt; wondering what was <br/>
&gt; going on.  All my daughter was concerned about was<br/>
&gt; telling me she is <br/>
&gt; thirsty, can she get a drink.  The other kids all<br/>
&gt; picked up on the <br/>
&gt; idea that something was wrong, but not her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fast forward to tonight:  My dad had back surgery<br/>
&gt; yesterday, and it <br/>
&gt; was a much more serious operation than any of us<br/>
&gt; realized.  So <br/>
&gt; finally tonight he was moved out of recovery and<br/>
&gt; into surgical <br/>
&gt; intensive care unit, so we went to visit him.  I<br/>
&gt; took her, partly <br/>
&gt; because I knew it wouldn&#39;t phase her, partly because<br/>
&gt; I was hoping it <br/>
&gt; would.  When we walked into his room, she asked, &quot;Is<br/>
&gt; that Papa?&quot; <br/>
&gt; because he really looked different.  He was coming<br/>
&gt; in and out of <br/>
&gt; consciousness, and kept wanting to change position<br/>
&gt; (which hurt him <br/>
&gt; tremendously) and was trying to pull at his many<br/>
&gt; tubes, so they had <br/>
&gt; to restrain him.  It was really pitiful.  But even<br/>
&gt; in the midst of <br/>
&gt; it, all she was worried about was whether she would<br/>
&gt; be home in time <br/>
&gt; for a tv show.  Then she asked why we were staying<br/>
&gt; so long (about 40 <br/>
&gt; minutes) and I finally went over and explained to<br/>
&gt; her that he had <br/>
&gt; been there all by himself (without family, anyway)<br/>
&gt; all day, and he <br/>
&gt; was in pain, and then I asked her to think about<br/>
&gt; what she would want <br/>
&gt; if she were in pain in a strange place.  I saw a<br/>
&gt; glimmer of <br/>
&gt; understanding.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t expect her to ever be an<br/>
&gt; overly-compassionate, merciful type <br/>
&gt; of person.  But I do wonder if there is something I<br/>
&gt; should be doing <br/>
&gt; to help her see things from other people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; perspectives.  Maybe just <br/>
&gt; taking it incident by incident is all I can do.  I<br/>
&gt; know I am in a lot <br/>
&gt; of conflict right now just over seeing my dad like<br/>
&gt; that, so maybe I <br/>
&gt; am making more of this than I should.  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt;  I would <br/>
&gt; appreciate any thoughts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tory<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS:  She did cry when she watched ET and Air Bud, so<br/>
&gt; it is in there <br/>
&gt; somewhere.  Mainly for animals and<br/>
&gt; extraterrestrials, though, it <br/>
&gt; seems.  :-)<br/>

person&#39;s shoes.  She also might have found it more overwhelming than you<br/>
thought, and that was her way of dealing with it.  I went to see my mother<br/>
yesterday.  She had fallen and broken her hip.  She was on her third day<br/>
after surgery, so I thought she&#39;d be perking up.  (She had sounded really<br/>
dozy on the phone the two nights before, which I thought was probably meds.)<br/>
When I got there, she looked so different from what I was expecting, I<br/>
actually had to ask the nurse if I had the right room.  She never really<br/>
woke up in the 3 hours I was there, and I have no idea whether she<br/>
recognized me.  She didn&#39;t seem to.  She&#39;s got pneumonia, so she was wearing<br/>
an oxygen mask.  It was *very* depressing, and I wanted to retreat a number<br/>
of times.  I *did* retreat into my book several times.  It was just too much<br/>
to take.  So maybe that&#39;s what was happening to your daughter.<br/>

and she believes in nothing.  To the rest of the world, she is a sweet,<br/>
kind and caring soul that cares about everyone and everything.  She says<br/>
the right words in a situation, then promptly forgets about the<br/>
situation.  I, on the other hand, take everything to heart and do<br/>

GOOD POINT.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m that way too, Lisa.  If somethings messed up I want to help fix it, not <br/>
sit around patting people and whimpering and saying &quot;This is just terrible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people see injustice and go into policework or law or politics or social <br/>
work without stopping to cry about it.  And all those services and pursuits <br/>
will never do away with injustice, but I think someone who cries and then goes <br/>
and fixes her makeup and watches a soap opera isn&#39;t showing the compassion <br/>
that someone who goes door to door to get on the petition to be elected to do <br/>
something is showing.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that compassion fades, after years of beating one&#39;s head against <br/>
the wall, but lots of people become nurses or teachers or ASPCA volunteers <br/>
because of tenderhearted compassion without many tears.<br/>

I am a huge crier, me and dh, cried through our whole wedding, the births of our children, a rainy day, ect. That&#39;s just us and the way that we deal with things, I dont run off to eat bon bons and watch TV though after (well alright a bon bon here or there does sound about right, but I digress) I am a social worker, volunteer and activist. Dh is a musician and teacher. We do a lot to initiate change and action after we have a good cry. We also do a tremendous amount of laughing in our house too! Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-134376783"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt; I, on the other hand, take everything to heart and do<br/>
&gt; everything in my power to rectify situations and I have never forgotten<br/>
&gt; a person&#39;s troubles once they&#39;ve told them to me.  As far as I know, my<br/>
&gt; sister sleeps just fine.  &gt;&gt;Lisa<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is me also.<br/>
 I am a do-er rather than a shed a few tears and walk away person.<br/>
At times it can be stressful as I often take on someone&#39;s worries, find a <br/>
solution and then find out that they have moved on or gave up.<br/>
<br/>
When my business, Country Moose Kids was running I had a woman form NY send <br/>
me a letter. I read it on my front lawn and broke out in tears. (I do Cry) She <br/>
had written a letter stating that she had nothing for her kids for Christmas, <br/>
he baby&#39;s crib was broken and that she had 6 kids (or 7).<br/>
I called a bunch of manufacturers and they donated roller blades, toys, <br/>
clothes, Gift Certificates from Children&#39;s place, baby toys and more.  Even Fed Ex <br/>
overnighter all the packages for free.<br/>
<br/>
 When I called Christmas Day to see if Fed Ex made it she said to me &quot;Where&#39;s <br/>
the crib&quot;! <br/>
Ugh, My heart sunk.  <br/>
It didn&#39;t take away my spirit but it almost ruined my Christmas.<br/>
That year we also gave gifts to 30 foster kids in Maine. That is what kept a <br/>
smile on my face.<br/>
<br/>
Three plus years later I am building a site for my sister very similar to my <br/>
old site. She hasn&#39;t had any sales yet.  I am not sleeping well. <br/>
I know she has a great deal of money into it. She has hopes that it will be <br/>
as successful as mine was.<br/>
 I feel great stress.  I took in over a hundred thousand my second year. She <br/>
wants the same but plans not to open the store front as I did and that&#39;s what <br/>
did me in. (No pressure though)<br/>
<br/>
I know I never gave up, cried or threw a fit. I gave it my all and made it. I <br/>
can say I did it and I am proud. Unless I do it for her she wont even get off <br/>
the ground (she is getting ready to throw in the towel).  I spent day and <br/>
night, hour after hour on line, handing out business cards, web submissions and <br/>
advertising.  I want to just do it all for her but I cant, she needs to learn <br/>
how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I have compassion but I almost take it too far.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the Christmas story but it&#39;s all been weighing on my mind the past <br/>
couple months......<br/>
