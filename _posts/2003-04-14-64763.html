<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498130209">...<br/>
<br/>
kind of off topic maybe, but I noticed this a lot<br/>
lately, maybe b/c it is spring...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When Ted is playing in the mud or planting seeds or<br/>
sorting his toys while talking quietly to himself,<br/>
when Carla is surrounded by her Barbies, attending to<br/>
all the small details she loves or precisely shredding<br/>
paper (we are getting a WORM-COMPOSTER soon--hooray) <br/>
or doing the repetitive but meticulous can-crushing<br/>
she initiated for recycling...I feel the same kind of<br/>
endorphin, hormone rush thingie as I did while nursing<br/>
when I watch them....but I don&#39;t SAY a word--hehe. <br/>
That satisfied,  happy feeling that &#39;all is GOOD&#39;<br/>
comes over me like a WAVE. <br/>
<br/>
Same feeling for me when they help each other or are<br/>
spontaneously kind for NO particular reason (like when<br/>
Carla won the watch and immediately handed it to<br/>
Ted)...<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes these are just VERY fleeting moments, a<br/>
nanosecond of realization, but SO very important to<br/>
me.   I am SO glad I can sometimes catch a glimpse of<br/>
the enormity of the effects of this whole way of<br/>
living in such a tiny gesture, but that&#39;s the way it<br/>
happens, I KNOW..I just know, it is a good thing. ( I<br/>
know there is a quote about &#39;a world in a grain of<br/>
sand&#39; but I can&#39;t remember where or who...).<br/>
<br/>
When Ted was in school, even though he was only there<br/>
for 2 months of kindergarten, he &#39;shut down&#39; and this<br/>
quiet joy and &#39;ease&#39; was suddenly GONE--how scary...he<br/>
also ground his teeth at night and cried out in his<br/>
sleep most nights...When Carla (no kindergarten, a fun<br/>
1st grade for her) started 2nd grade she suddenly got<br/>
a &#39;not nice&#39; teacher and homework and a strict<br/>
classroom regime with shaming rules, nothing like at<br/>
home...I brought them home when I saw unsmiling faces<br/>
every day when they got off the bus.  I was SO scared.<br/>
 I didn&#39;t know it would be ok or what I would do or<br/>
how. I am 37, my kids are 8 and 6, I have a High<br/>
School Diploma, 3 semesters of college before I<br/>
flunked out, on purpose, my family saw I was &#39;smart<br/>
enough&#39; to major in &#39;something good&#39; when I WANTED to<br/>
major in art and history. I am one of those pagan,<br/>
laid-back, funky, artsy people, married to a shaming<br/>
family-youngest son-catholic-raised government worker<br/>
(&#39;deity of choice&#39;-help us)--oh shit.<br/>
 <br/>
That was October 2002 and I haven&#39;t done a &#39;schooly&#39;<br/>
thing since unless the kids asked for it.  We are SO<br/>
happy!!!!!     &lt;big wicked grin&gt;<br/>

I know what you mean!<br/>
<br/>
I get this when I&#39;m watching Dylan sometimes.   Whoosh, it&#39;s like someone<br/>
melted love and poured it all over you.<br/>
<br/>
We went to see some friends who where camping along the Missouri river<br/>
yesterday.   We fed the mooching ducks and geese from the dock and lazed<br/>
there, on our backs, being rocked by the water and holding bread up for<br/>
the seagulls.    He was glorious, happy, smiling, laughing, delighted and<br/>
I was amazed all over again that he came from my body and shared my<br/>
world.   <br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean.  <br/>
<br/>
That was a great post Kim.<br/>
