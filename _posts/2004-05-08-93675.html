<div id="ygrps-yiv-534780967">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We all slept in this AM, even the early bird.<br/>
Andrew said, &quot;Mom can we have pancakes&quot;...pause...&quot;I will mix them up.&quot;<br/>
So as Andrew and Jess mixed the batter, I got the grill warming.  They each wanted to then pour the batter and add the chips (or not) and then flip the cakes.  Even the oldest had a turn as he stirred from bed because of the commotion. <br/>
The kids are fed, the kitchen is a mess. (How do you get flour out of the blender buttons?).  Life is good.  Are they reading my email &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Beth in MD who likes pecans in her pancakes and eats them like cookies.  <br/>

dripping between grill grates... LOL Took me a minute to get my brain in gear! <br/>
LOL<br/>

Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771812553">With uncooked flour and batters the trick is to use cold water for the first<br/>
clean up - hot water and detergent after the batter is all gone to clean up<br/>
the residual oils or butter.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any canned air - like is used for cleaning dust from electrical<br/>
equipment or computer interiors?<br/>
