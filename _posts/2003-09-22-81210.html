&lt;&lt; My first impression is one of the list&#39;s atmosphere being<br/>
somewhat judgemental--at least when one particular button is pushed.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
People who read without judgement aren&#39;t thinking or learning.<br/>
<br/>
The particular button is &quot;this will make it harder for people to be good <br/>
unschoolers,&quot; and your post didn&#39;t push that button for me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;welcoming the first real rain to fall in over 2 months--too late to save<br/>
our pastures--and wishing she could change the apparent physical reality<br/>
of the world to not include drought &lt;g&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
May daughter&#39;s name is Holly too.   She has a fascination for a little town <br/>
here called Madrid, pronounced &quot;wrong,&quot; with emphasis on the MAD.  It was a big <br/>
coal mining town founded in the 1880&#39;s, which was a ghost town when WWII <br/>
came, and was repopulated by hippie artists in the 1970&#39;s.   We drove up there <br/>
yesterday to have lunch and for her to show her friend some nice grafitti under a <br/>
bridge that used to be a car bridge over an arroyo, but now is just a <br/>
footbridge.   The book that was under there in May was still there.  We looked at the <br/>
wood joinery on the handrail, and talked about wood construction with simpler <br/>
tools and methods.   <br/>
<br/>
But as to drought, that area is high and dry, no regularly running water at <br/>
all, and without mining, nobody would have lived there.  Without deep wells for <br/>
drinking water and other modern adaptations it would be uninhabitable.   We <br/>
saw dead evergreens on the way.  These are not giant trees, but they&#39;re old <br/>
trees.   Pi√±on and juniper, squat stuff that doesn&#39;t get more than maybe ten or <br/>
fifteen feet high, even the big ones.  Round evergreens that look like crumbs <br/>
from a distance, like the hills were sprinkled with some kind of cake-shop <br/>
decorations.   In some places a fourth of them were dead, and that creates quite a <br/>
fire danger.   <br/>
<br/>
The town itself was made of wooden shacks (there are a few little stone <br/>
houses from 1915 or so, and the newer construction is county code) and some of <br/>
those mining shacks still stand in their state of deterioration.   The ground is <br/>
coal dust in most places.   There are little paper signs around town that say <br/>
&quot;Your cigarette could burn our town: watch your butts&quot; or something very like <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t talk about any of that much.  I know Holly didn&#39;t miss any of it.<br/>
<br/>
We thought the restaurant/tavern would be kind of empty, but there was a <br/>
biker group in town, and also a family reunion.  It was really crowded, but there <br/>
was a band.<br/>
<br/>
Nice day.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list, Holly who has a name like my daughter&#39;s!<br/>

<br/>
I used the word &quot;judgmental&quot;, which I judge &lt;g&gt; to be quite different<br/>
from using &quot;judgment&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I use &quot;judgmental&quot; to mean being highly critical in a very negative<br/>
sense.  <br/>
<br/>
I would say using &quot;judgment&quot; means weighing what has been communicated<br/>
against one&#39;s own experience and deciding for oneself what is worthy and<br/>
what not, what&#39;s positive and what&#39;s negative.<br/>
<br/>
I use judgment based on my personal experience every time I read a post,<br/>
take a phone call, write a letter, drive a car, assess a yarn I&#39;ve spun,<br/>
decide what veggies to grow next year.  The emotional tone of using<br/>
judgment is, for me, positive--the goal is to learn from any mistakes so<br/>
my judgment is better each time.  When others are present, using good<br/>
judgment fosters open dialog--or, occasionally, I withdraw from the<br/>
dialog because my judgment tells me it will not be a positive<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
If I were judgmental about the above examples, I might decide the poster<br/>
had rocks for brains, or that I&#39;m a bad spinner, or that I&#39;ll never<br/>
learn how to grow enough vegetables for us to be self-sufficient.  The<br/>
tone and experience are both negative and unpleasant, and has a strong<br/>
tendency to kill any open exchange of ideas.  I grew up with a mother<br/>
like this, so I know what I&#39;m talking about :)<br/>
<br/>
In my observation of my own and others&#39; tendencies toward being<br/>
judgmental, the purpose generally seems to be a need to prove oneself to<br/>
be &#39;better&#39; than the other.  As when I figured out why I kept being<br/>
critical (only to myself, but it was still a negative thing) about<br/>
another Holly&#39;s hair.  She never seemed to trim it or comb it--and I&#39;m<br/>
not talking going to the beauty shop weekly :)  I finally realized it<br/>
was the only thing I could feel superior to her about.  Exploring why I<br/>
needed to feel superior led me to greater understanding of the impacts<br/>
of growing up with a severely judgmental mother, and has in turn led to<br/>
much less need to privately find ways to be superior to others.<br/>
<br/>
IOW, I used my judgment to understand why I was judgmental.<br/>
