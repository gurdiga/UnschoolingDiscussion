Don&#39;t you realize that when children have been on medication, that they <br/>
cannot<br/>
go COLD TURKEY??? You are very fortunate that these two boys didn&#39;t <br/>
experience<br/>
withdrawl, and may I remind you that you took a very BIG chance in doing <br/>
this?<br/>
Please anyone that reads this letter please be aware that cold turkey is <br/>
wrong<br/>
even if it involves you as an adult. These medications alter the chemicals in<br/>
the body, and are there for a purpose and by no means are gone and out of<br/>
the system within a week. I think you better investigate medications and<br/>
withdrawl before you take a chance like this again, especially with some<br/>
one elses children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, that&#39;s not true with the stimulants<br/>
prescribed for ADHD (ritalin, adderol, concerta,<br/>
etc.). There are actually &quot;breaks&quot; (cold turkey<br/>
breaks) built into the treatment schedule for this<br/>
drug, to give your body a &quot;rest&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I know this because a physician recommended this drug<br/>
for both my son and me, but I turned them down on both<br/>
accounts. But not without researching and asking lots<br/>
of questions, which is how I found out about this.<br/>
<br/>
Doctors sometimes prescribe anti-depressants for ADHD,<br/>
and the case may be different for them, but as for the<br/>
stimulants, &quot;cold turkey&quot; is not only ok, but is, at<br/>
least by some physicians (I&#39;ve spoken to more than one<br/>
and done lots of research) built right into the<br/>
treatment plan.<br/>

Hi Shelly,<br/>
I wasn&#39;t really responding to you directly to counter your arguement, I was<br/>
thinking about writing that post for a few days, your&#39;s just happened to be<br/>
easier to &quot;reply to&quot; than to compose a new one.<br/>
I thought that this was an important point to make. I wanted to take the<br/>
current conversation in a slightly different direction in order to point out<br/>
somethings that I had been thinking about.<br/>

unsupervised. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you need to trust them before you let them take the kid.<br/>
<br/>
If I let my kids spend a week with other relatives the the relatives try to <br/>
teach them algebra or something during that time, the kids will either go <br/>
along with it or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m presuming the child agreed (probably happily) not to take the ritalin.  I <br/>
would never make a child take a drug against his will, so for me that would <br/>
come under that category.  If they offered him a week OFF the drug (and why <br/>
should he take it during a vacation without schedule or expectation of <br/>
behavior?) and he accepted, then that&#39;s less invasive of his privacy than <br/>
trying to teach formal algebra to an unschooler would be.   Drugs can be <br/>
reinstated.  Math pressure and shame can&#39;t be undone after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;WHat really bothered me was someone deliberately violated a<br/>
parent&#39;s wishes and decisions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To take this to an extreme, some parents wish and decide to use corporal <br/>
punishment and some are sexual abusers.  The uncles and aunts don&#39;t have to <br/>
keep THAT up on weeks when the kids are with them.   Many are verbal abusers <br/>
and schedule-abusers (I don&#39;t care WHAT you&#39;re doing, it&#39;s 9:00, go to bed&quot;) <br/>
and relatives don&#39;t have to keep THAT up.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Would we stand by when someone purposely and deliberately did<br/>
something in direct opposition to OUR parenting beliefs?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a health food nut, but if my kids stay with friends who are, they <br/>
eat what that other family is eating.   I don&#39;t take my kids to church, but <br/>
when other people have, I haven&#39;t made a big deal, because the kids can say <br/>
no if they really don&#39;t want to go.   Even if someone took Holly and marched <br/>
her through a full week of Vacation Bible School and Baptist-life to try to <br/>
convince her that she had to be born again, I could be calm about that, <br/>
because Holly knows enough to be analytical and is not easily led.  <br/>
<br/>
I would consider all those things to be educational opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s different with younger kids or newer unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We allow TV watching at our house, and video games.  I would NOT even begin <br/>
to agree to keep someone else&#39;s child for a week (nephews, neighbors, <br/>
friends) on the parents&#39; terms if they were to say &quot;Don&#39;t let him watch TV&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Make him go to bed at 9:00&quot; or &quot;If he says a bad word he has to be <br/>
spanked.&quot;   They can keep him themselves.<br/>
<br/>
And if a family drugs their child even when he&#39;s home because a doctor said <br/>
it was a good idea, if his being drugged daily is crucial to their peace of <br/>
mind, they should keep him with them ever moment, because not all people are <br/>
willing to give children stupifying drugs.<br/>
