<div id="ygrps-yiv-922884374">At 4:13 PM +0000 10/29/03, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a> wrote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>
&gt;I would like to discuss unschooling on an unschooling list and let<br/>
&gt;fundamentalist political activists discuss their stuff on their lists.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The discussion will undoubtedly have moved on by the time I get this <br/>
reply posted, because I&#39;m on digest mode and replying offline and I&#39;m <br/>
in the farthest western time zone. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But nevertheless, I thought it important to take this opportunity - <br/>
with apologies to Sandra - to note that this &quot;stuff&quot; doesn&#39;t only <br/>
concern political activists - it concerns everyone who homeschools - <br/>
or unschools - their kids. It&#39;s important to discuss the hows and <br/>
whys and wherefores of unschooling, but it is likewise important to <br/>
be aware of the very real forces that would put unnecessary legal <br/>
restrictions, restraints and controls on what parents and their <br/>
children do in the privacy of their own home. Unschoolers should <br/>
inform themselves about what&#39;s happening in the state and national <br/>
political arenas (especially with HSLDA pushing for federal <br/>
legislation), what the national media is fussing about (with all <br/>
these recent child abuse articles), and how those dynamics will <br/>
affect the freedoms of homeschoolers down the road.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, we at HEM have tracked the political atmosphere <br/>
of homeschooling for over 20 years, and we&#39;re seeing more reasons for <br/>
concern right now than at any time in the past. Because this is no <br/>
longer my list I&#39;ll respect Sandra&#39;s wishes not to discuss it here <br/>
(at least not any more than with this post), but if anyone does want <br/>
to discuss what&#39;s going on I recommend these resources:<br/>
