Everyone here seems human....except Bridget.  She seems to be &quot;above&quot; it!<br/>
Susan...who&#39;s still ROTFL so much from some of Bridget&#39;s recent ridiculous*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553070094">&lt;&lt;You really can&#39;t have it both ways&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, nobody complained the first 20 or so times you complained about<br/>
Sandra.  It was after you repeatedly turned topics that had nothing to do<br/>
with Sandra around, so you could complain about your perceived mistreatment<br/>
at her hand.  Which is actually pretty funny considering you say the<br/>
connotation of words have no effect on you.<br/>
<br/>
And yes....I can have it both ways.  I enjoy Sandra&#39;s posts and find them to<br/>
be tremendously useful to my family and myself.<br/>
