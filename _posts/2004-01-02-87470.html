 Mixing stuff to see what would happen.  Perfume and powder doesn&#39;t do much, <br/>
but alka seltzer and iodine!!!  And I used to do commecials for Avon in the <br/>
mirror, holding various products lovingly to my cheek, smiling convincingly.<br/>

<br/>
I did too.  I used to stare at my eyes in the mirror and almost<br/>
self-hypnotize myself.  I would think about the possibilities of alternate<br/>
realities...what if our big important world was really just a red blood cell<br/>
in a giant being?  What if dreams were reality and reality was really just<br/>
dreams?  Wierd stuff....but I knew nobody would interrrupt me in the<br/>
bathroom.<br/>
