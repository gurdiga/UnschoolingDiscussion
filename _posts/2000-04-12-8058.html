<div id="ygrps-yiv-232262821">Kyle,  I enjoyed your post-- sounds like something fantastic to pursue!  I <br/>
don&#39;t how many people would have a chance to build on land that their <br/>
grandparents lived on.  Sounds like a great idea to me-- also sounds like  it <br/>
could be a great book in the making given the historical background...  Hope <br/>
it all happens for you!                                                         <br/>
                            Karen</div>
