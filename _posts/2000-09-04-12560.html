<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022114969">I had a bit of a surprise today when I read the CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION & <br/>
TREATMENT ACT/WHAT DEFINES ABUSE? regarding &quot;EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT&quot;  It said <br/>
that one form of educ. neglect was &quot;failure to enroll a child of mandatory <br/>
school age&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers, do you enroll your child once they are school age???<br/>

&gt; &gt; ps Our tooth fairy gives a silver dollar for the first tooth lost, and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; quarter after that. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shirley says:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How can I get your tooth fairy to work my neighborhood. The going price <br/>
&gt;here<br/>
&gt;is a dollar a tooth!!(Arrrgh!) My dad told my kids that if they were in his<br/>
&gt;neighborhood, thry&#39;d get $5 a tooth. I suggested that they spend the night<br/>
&gt;with Grandpa each time they lost a tooth!! (Sheesh-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Valerie says:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sheesh is right. I think this should go beyond the suggesting<br/>
&gt;stage....arrange a sleep-over when at least two of your children have loose<br/>
&gt;teeth, preferably two teeth each. Don&#39;t let them come home without cash. <br/>
&gt;So,<br/>
&gt;when you were little, did the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; leave _you_ large amounts of<br/>
&gt;money, or is this one of those &quot;We couldn&#39;t do for you, but we&#39;ll do for <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;grandchildren&quot; situations?<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: Differences with DH<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To be very open and honest Nicoletta, I am from an abusive family as<br/>
&gt;well. There was abuse left and right and I was the one who received<br/>
&gt;the brunt of the abuse mostly in the form of emotional and some<br/>
&gt;physical by my father when I was a teenager. By physical I mean that<br/>
&gt;he would taunt me till I was fuming mad and then walk away laughing.<br/>
&gt;This was something that he did to me starting when I was very young.<br/>
&gt;When I became a teenager I learned that I had a right to not be<br/>
&gt;treated this way. The years of emotional abuse came out physically<br/>
&gt;when he would do this. He was good at knowing when I had reached the<br/>
&gt;point of physical anger and when I would walk away he would dare me<br/>
&gt;to come back and fight him. And I did. And although my mother is from<br/>
&gt;an abusive family as well, she was my advocate. With the problems I<br/>
&gt;had in ps she was the one who stood up for me when I wasn&#39;t able to<br/>
&gt;stand up for myself. In the end it was my mother who was able to<br/>
&gt;acknowledge that she wasn&#39;t perfect and admit to me when she made a<br/>
&gt;mistake in her parenting, and there were many mistakes, however, none<br/>
&gt;that were as bad as what my father inflicted on me. He, by the way,<br/>
&gt;to this day admits nothing wrong. He sees himself as infalable in<br/>
&gt;every aspect of his life. The point I am wanting make here and<br/>
&gt;getting off the subject of is that although I come from a family of<br/>
&gt;abuse, somehow, someway I was able to look at what was happening to<br/>
&gt;me and realize that it was wrong. That this isn&#39;t the way it is<br/>
&gt;supposed to be. And then figure out how to do it better, I will even<br/>
&gt;say right. That isn&#39;t to say that I am always right but that the<br/>
&gt;environment that I have been able to provide for my children is<br/>
&gt;happy, loving and not abusive. Meaning, they will never know what it<br/>
&gt;is like to grow up with anything close to what I did. I have been<br/>
&gt;able to figure out how to give them the type of environment I wanted<br/>
&gt;to and deserved to grow up in. How do I know I am doing this with the<br/>
&gt;background I just described? I used to wonder that myself. I began<br/>
&gt;looking at what the &quot;experts&quot; say and suggest and found that I was<br/>
&gt;already doing the majority of it. This isn&#39;t to say that I am perfect<br/>
&gt;in my parenting skills. It is to say that I don&#39;t have the problems<br/>
&gt;of parenting my children that most survivors of abuse do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do apreciate your openness and your opinion. And thank you for your<br/>
&gt;sensitivity in you last post. To be very honest I was extremely<br/>
&gt;offended by the email you had sent.: ) however, all is forgotten. : )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am curious as to some of the things you have learned in your class<br/>
&gt;with DH. How have you come to terms and found common ground with the<br/>
&gt;differences you have in your childrenrearing techniques?<br/>

&gt; &gt; BTW I did some spanking when my girls where younger, before I knew<br/>
&gt;about Aletha Solter&#39;s work and before I joined a Self-Healing Circle.<br/>
&gt;I wasn&#39;t judging you personally. However I still believe that<br/>
&gt;spanking is abusive. Therefore I have to admit that &quot;I used to abuse<br/>
&gt;my children&quot;. I have changed. But I could only begin to change once I<br/>
&gt;realized what I was doing and acknowledging it openly, while at the<br/>
&gt;same time being gentle with myself, not beating myself up or judging<br/>
&gt;myself. Corporal punishment is not the only type of child abuse - a<br/>
&gt;lot of emotional abuse goes unnoticed. I have been &quot;guilty&quot; of that,<br/>
&gt;too. Realizing that my behaviours originated in my own childhood is<br/>
&gt;not an excuse or a reason to blame my upbringing, but a place to<br/>
&gt;begin changing. I am working on it every day. So I would like to join<br/>
&gt;someone else here who said &quot;try not to take it personally&quot;. I know<br/>
&gt;that is not easy sometimes, and I see every day how &#39;taking things<br/>
&gt;personally and getting defensive&#39; gets in way more than anything when<br/>
&gt;it comes to opening up to change. I thank you, Corallyn, for posting<br/>
&gt;you original message. In my emotionality I was maybe too quick to<br/>
&gt;react by sending all the Aletha Solter info (I still think everyone<br/>
&gt;could benefit from knowing her stuff), without acknowledging that I<br/>
&gt;have been where you are, Corallyn, and I do hav sympathy for you and<br/>
&gt;your situation. My husband and I recently joined a Couples&#39; Self-<br/>
&gt;Healing Circle. It has been most valuable in helping us deal with<br/>
&gt;some of our issues - differences in childrearing being one,<br/>
&gt;especially since we are blended family (I have two girls from a<br/>
&gt;previous marriage, he has a son and a daughter from two previous<br/>
&gt;marriages and together we have Benjamin who is three). Anyway, I<br/>
&gt;apologize for not being more sensitive to begin with. That doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;mean I feel any different or less passionate about the subject of<br/>
&gt;spanking or other forms of punishment.<br/>

&gt;I can see that it is your opinion that it doesn&#39;t matter what the<br/>
&gt;situation was. There is absolutely no good reason for spanking your<br/>
&gt;child. I can respect that opinion and I don&#39;t agree with it. I am not<br/>
&gt;going to defend myself any further because it is pointless. I agree<br/>
&gt;to disagree, as my mother tells me. And I can accept that. No hard<br/>
&gt;feelings. Corallyn : )<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You are absulutely right. It is my responsibility. I am responsible<br/>
&gt; &gt; for how I teach my children and at preasant the choices they make<br/>
&gt;and how I deal with those choices.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think Lynda was trying to say (correct me if I&#39;m wrong<br/>
&gt;Lynda)...that you as the adult were responsible for your child<br/>
&gt;running away and punishing the child for your lack of responsibility<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t seem to make any sense... There is no judgement in that...<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s just a fact... If you are the responsible one for a situation<br/>
&gt;and something happens in that situations, then I would be apologizing<br/>
&gt;to my son for not watching him well enough that he could get away<br/>
&gt;from me, not hitting him for something that children do... They don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;understand at 4 yrs old they could get lost or someone could hurt<br/>
&gt;them...They just see things that they like and off they go, which is<br/>
&gt;why it&#39;s our job as adults to not let that happen.  But why should<br/>
&gt;your son suffer consequences for your inability to take care of him?<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s just a thought...and one I only just thought off....It doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;make you a bad parent, just a typical reaction to the thought that<br/>
&gt;you are not perfect and chose to take an action that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;appropriate given the situation.  Why is it so difficult to admit a<br/>
&gt;mistake.  Spanking a child because they ran away when it was the<br/>
&gt;responsibility of the adult to make sure they didn&#39;t run away doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;make any logical sense to me and it certainly wouldn&#39;t make any to a<br/>
&gt;child. Just thinking out loud...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;It might be helpful if everyone who hasn&#39;t been through it once knows that <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;list discussion on spanking usually becomes very controversial and <br/>
&gt;outraged.<br/>
&gt;Such a discussion is likely to TRIPLE the volume of posts on the list for a<br/>
&gt;couple of weeks and include some rather startling ranting and raving.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But people who like to kick rotten logs, turn rocks over, and poke<br/>
&gt;rattlesnakes with sticks may enjoy some of those aspects. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt;Anyway, like I said before the problem I have with<br/>
&gt;replies to my inicial post is the accuations that seem to be implied<br/>
&gt;not the opinions themselves.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For the record, every spanking debate I have ever seen includes people<br/>
&gt;criticizing spanking as a method and people who spank (even occasionally)<br/>
&gt;feeling upset, as if they were personally reviled.  In the heat of the<br/>
&gt;moment, it&#39;s hard to be aware of subtleties, like the actual pronouns used <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;a sentence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(And sometimes people do say &quot;You spank?  That&#39;s terrible&quot;.  But I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think THIS debate has dipped down to that personal level yet.  I can&#39;t <br/>
&gt;speak<br/>
&gt;for any private flames that might have been mailed.)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a question about Waldorf.  As I understand it, Waldorf is pretty<br/>
&gt;structured.  But I know a fair number of families who profess to be<br/>
&gt;unschoolers but talk of using Waldorf or Oak Meadow or have their kids in<br/>

&gt;Subject: moving, need help<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi all,<br/>
&gt;I have been a lurker/sometimes poster on the list for quite a while now and<br/>
&gt;need some help.  We currently live in SW Virginia and will be moving back <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;NC in the next few months.  I need your help in finding inclusive groups in<br/>
&gt;the Charlotte area. I&#39;ve already checked NHEN and NCHE.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We will probably be moving north of Charlotte, possibly back to <br/>
&gt;Mooresville,<br/>
&gt;maybe to Lincoln county.  Yet we may be closer to Charlotte, possibly<br/>
&gt;Davidson or Huntersville.  Do any of you know of any groups we can connect<br/>
&gt;with?  At this point, I would love to know of ANY inclusive group within a<br/>
&gt;40 mile radius of Charlotte, not just on the north side.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;TIA!<br/>
&gt;Cindy<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve used white vinegar for getting smell out of carpet.  I used a<br/>
&gt;clumping<br/>
&gt; &gt; litter & checked it several times a day.  Pre-DH I had 7 cats in an<br/>
&gt; &gt; apartment owned by a friend who didn&#39;t allow pets.  But he came into my<br/>
&gt; &gt; prior apartment & was surprised when he saw all the cats.  Now I have 2<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; are outside & 5 children (2 step).  It was a lot quieter then & not<br/>
&gt;nearly<br/>
&gt; &gt; the work but I wouldn&#39;t trade for anything.  Now dd 7 wants a Husky.<br/>

&gt; &gt; probably send their kids to daycare...so I don&#39;t see the connection with<br/>

&gt;Subject: RE: censorship-sex ed<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;There we are, hubby and I watching a grownup movie.  Kids are in their<br/>
&gt;rooms.<br/>
&gt;  Of course, just when the violent part of the movie starts, in waltzes the <br/>
&gt;5<br/>
&gt;yo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So I, being the fantastic mom that I am, switch the station off of the <br/>
&gt;movie<br/>
&gt;to the cooking channel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Where they are hurling chunks of raw meat to the tiger in the zoo!!!!   And<br/>
&gt;going on and on about how they feed X pounds of horse and other meat to the<br/>
&gt;tiger every day, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Auugghhhhh!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At least it was real violence and not people shooting at each other in a<br/>
&gt;movie, but it was more nature channel that I was ready for at that moment!<br/>
&gt;:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nance&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;LOL! Mmm Mmm! Raw meat! Hungry kitty! Lol! :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We keep our t.v. in our bedroom and usually, if there&#39;s a show that is too<br/>
&gt;adult for our kids on, I tell then point blank-&quot;Seamus, this show is too<br/>
&gt;grown up for you to watch.  Please leave the room, I&#39;ll be there in a<br/>
&gt;minute.&quot; I say that if there&#39;s a particularly good part on, or if it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;boring I&#39;ll say &quot;Let&#39;s leave the room so we can talk&quot;.  I prefer to do it<br/>
&gt;this way because it helps me reinforce that there&#39;s programs on t.v. that <br/>
&gt;ds<br/>
&gt;is not ready for, and sometimes it can lead to discussion about what is<br/>
&gt;appropriate t.v. and what is not.  Ds will say &quot;Why can&#39;t I watch it?&quot; and<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll answer saying &quot;Well, they use bad language&quot; or &quot;There&#39;s too much<br/>
&gt;pretend violence&quot; or something to that effect. And normally I end it with<br/>
&gt;&quot;When you get older you can decide for yourself if you want to watch it.&quot;<br/>
&gt;He may not understand completely, but he likes to have a reason and feel in<br/>
&gt;control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Although, if there&#39;s nekkid folks on the screen (not very often, but<br/>
&gt;still..) CLICK! Off goes the t.v.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regardless, when they walk into that room and there&#39;s something adult on,<br/>
&gt;boy-there&#39;s a moment of squirming nervousness.  I&#39;m like-eek! Shut your<br/>
&gt;eyes! Which is funny, because I remember my mom letting me come into the<br/>
&gt;room where a movie was on to get a goodnight kiss so long as I shut my <br/>
&gt;eyes.<br/>
&gt;:-) I walked blindly into the room and usually tripped over the hassock.<br/>
&gt;Hmmm.  I can remember my parents laughing.  I wonder why. ;-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sent this from the wrong mailbox originally- thats why it looks fwded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am very new to this list, just started with this thread ( and baby<br/>
&gt; &gt; teeth ),  I have been impressed with much of the grace & wisdom offered<br/>
&gt; &gt; here.  I can clearly see all sides to this particular discussion, and I <br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt; &gt; so glad it has continued.  Although the subject may be uncomfortable, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think everyone seems to agree that it is one of most importantance .  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; seems to be making some progress though, where people are starting to<br/>
&gt;listen<br/>
&gt; &gt; and therefore actually be able to affect one another.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think compassion is the key here.  I read Corallyn&#39;s initial post as<br/>
&gt;being<br/>
&gt; &gt; brave & quite worthy of  responses.  It is very difficult to bring up <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion of discipline, and it touches on very sensitive ground for <br/>
&gt;most<br/>
&gt; &gt; of us.  But, the only way to effectively change often involves some<br/>
&gt; &gt; discomfort.  I am always grateful to those who are braver than I at<br/>
&gt; &gt; broaching &#39;dangerous&#39; subjects, and I always learn something no matter <br/>
&gt;how<br/>
&gt; &gt; much I already think I know.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, thank you to Corallyn & thank you to Nicoletta ( I appreciated both <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; your posts), and thank you to everyone else who contributed to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion one way or the other.  I&#39;ve been on lists where discussion <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt; &gt; shut down when things got even slightly controversial, and that level of<br/>
&gt; &gt; censorship doesn&#39;t seem to reflect the ideas of unschooling in my mind<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I look forward to many more discussions with all of you!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With all this said I do respect each  person&#39;s right to their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oppinion. That doesn&#39;t mean I do/have to agree/like that opinion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Corallyn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s right, Corallyn.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW I did some spanking when my girls where younger, before I knew <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Aletha Solter&#39;s work and before I joined a Self-Healing Circle.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I wasn&#39;t judging you personally. However I still believe that spanking<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; abusive. Therefore I have to admit that &quot;I used to abuse my children&quot;. <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have changed. But I could only begin to change once I realized what I<br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing and acknowledging it openly, while at the same time being gentle<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; myself, not beating myself up or judging myself. Corporal punishment <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the only type of child abuse - a lot of emotional abuse goes <br/>
&gt;unnoticed.<br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been &quot;guilty&quot; of that, too. Realizing that my behaviours <br/>
&gt;originated<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my own childhood is not an excuse or a reason to blame my upbringing,<br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; place to begin changing. I am working on it every day.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So I would like to join someone else here who said &quot;try not to take it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; personally&quot;. I know that is not easy sometimes, and I see every day <br/>
&gt;how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;taking things personally and getting defensive&#39; gets in way more than<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything when it comes to opening up to change.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thank you, Corallyn, for posting you original message. In my<br/>
&gt; &gt; emotionality<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was maybe too quick to react by sending all the Aletha Solter info <br/>
&gt;(I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still think everyone could benefit from knowing her stuff), without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; acknowledging that I have been where you are, Corallyn, and I do have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sympathy for you and your situation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My husband and I recently joined a Couples&#39; Self-Healing Circle. It <br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most valuable in helping us deal with some of our issues - differences<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; childrearing being one, especially since we are blended family (I have<br/>
&gt;two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; girls from a previous marriage, he has a son and a daughter from two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; previous marriages and together we have Benjamin who is three).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I apologize for not being more sensitive to begin with. That<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean I feel any different or less passionate about the subject of<br/>
&gt;spanking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or other forms of punishment.<br/>

&gt;lives in various parts of MO (Central, West and a few South).  I am a<br/>
&gt;transplant to Florida now and have been here many years.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I agree with you, even though we &quot;go down that road again&quot; each time I take<br/>
&gt;the journey I learn more and think more about life, children and<br/>
&gt;parenting....Thanks everyone!<br/>

&gt;One component of physical injury is defined by CPS, the police and the<br/>
&gt;medical profession as leaving marks which can result in bruising.  Hence,<br/>
&gt;repeated blows to the bare fanny of a small child would be defined as<br/>
&gt;physical injury.<br/>

&gt;What Is Child Abuse & NeglectThe ringer in the definition seems to be the<br/>
&gt;requirement that physical injury take place. It says nothing about<br/>
&gt;offending other people&#39;s sense of political correctness!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I hope this clears up any disagreement over &quot;what defines abuse&quot; Here is<br/>
&gt;the law in black and white. It applies to all 50 states.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &quot;CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT&quot;<br/>
&gt;   The Public Law 100-294<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Defines child abuse and neglect as being any physical or mental injury,<br/>
&gt;act of sexual abuse or exploitation, negligent treatment, or maltreatment<br/>
&gt;of any child under the age of 18, unless the child protection law of the<br/>
&gt;State in, which the child resides specifies a younger age for cases not<br/>
&gt;involving sexual abuse, by a person, including any employee of a<br/>
&gt;residential facility or any staff person providing out-of- home care, who<br/>
&gt;is responsible for the child&#39;s welfare under circumstances, which indicate<br/>
&gt;that the child&#39;s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The Act defines sexual abuse as: the use, employment, persuasion,<br/>
&gt;inducement, enticement or coercion of any child to engage in, or assist any<br/>
&gt;other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct (or any simulation<br/>
&gt;of such conduct) for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such<br/>
&gt;conduct, or rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual<br/>
&gt;exploitation of children, or incest with children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   1984 Child Abuse Amendments of (P.L. 98-457)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   As a result of the above amendment to the Child Abuse Act, the act now<br/>
&gt;also includes the withholding of medically indicated treatment for an<br/>
&gt;infant&#39;s life-threatening conditions as child abuse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   WHAT IS MALTREATMENT ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The following categories basically all fit under the heading<br/>
&gt;Maltreatment:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   PHYSICAL ABUSE<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Physical abuse is defined by inflicting any type of physical injury by<br/>
&gt;punching, slapping, hitting, beating, kicking, biting, arm twisting, hair<br/>
&gt;pulling, burning, or otherwise harming a child. The parent or care giver<br/>
&gt;may not have intended to hurt the child and injury may have resulted from<br/>
&gt;over-discipline or physical punishment that is inappropriate to the child&#39;s<br/>
&gt;age. However, it is still abuse. Any physical act causing harm to a child<br/>
&gt;is abuse whether it was intended or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   CHILD NEGLECT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Child neglect is defined by failure on the parents or care givers part <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;provide for the child&#39;s basic needs, food, water, shelter, clothing and so<br/>
&gt;on. Child neglect can be a combination of the following: physical,<br/>
&gt;educational, or emotional or can be just one alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The latest national incidence study defines these three types of neglect<br/>
&gt;as follows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   PHYSICAL NEGLECT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Physical neglect includes refusal of or delay in seeking health care or<br/>
&gt;emergency medical services, abandonment, kicking an under aged child out of<br/>
&gt;the home. Not allowing a runaway to return home. Inadequate supervision,<br/>
&gt;leaving the child unattended for long periods of time. Leaving an under<br/>
&gt;aged child home alone to be responsible for younger siblings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Educational neglect includes allowing your school aged child to commit<br/>
&gt;the act of chronic truancy, failure to enroll a child of mandatory school<br/>
&gt;age, every child has the right to education and should be in school<br/>
&gt;according to your states guidelines. Inattention to a special educational<br/>
&gt;need, such as knowing your child is in need of special education classes<br/>
&gt;and doing nothing about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   EMOTIONAL NEGLECT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Emotional neglect includes such actions as chronic or extreme spouse<br/>
&gt;abuse in the child&#39;s presence. Knowledge of drug or alcohol use by the<br/>
&gt;child, or permission. Refusal of or failure to allow or provide needed<br/>
&gt;psychological care.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It is extremely important to distinguish between willful neglect and a<br/>
&gt;parent&#39;s or caretaker&#39;s failure to provide necessities of life because of<br/>
&gt;poverty or cultural norms. Say for example, willful neglect is acts that<br/>
&gt;call for Child Protective Services intervention. Whereas, if a parent who<br/>
&gt;is unable to provide the necessities of life due to poverty may, instead,<br/>
&gt;seek assistance from the governmental agencies charged with providing<br/>
&gt;financial assistance, health services, housing, or other basic services.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   EMOTIONAL ABUSE<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Emotional abuse includes but is not limited to: Screaming, yelling,<br/>
&gt;belittling, name calling, emotional detachment, lack of love and affection,<br/>
&gt;scapegoating, such as blaming the child for the adults problems or<br/>
&gt;financial state.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   As you&#39;ve seen there are many forms of child maltreatment more often <br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt;not we find them occurring in combinations. Emotional/psychological will<br/>
&gt;most likely always be present as well. Emotional abuse and neglect includes<br/>
&gt;acts or omissions by the parents, guardians or any other person responsible<br/>
&gt;for the child&#39;s care that have caused, or could possibly cause, serious<br/>
&gt;behavioral, emotional, or mental disorders.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   In some cases of emotional/psychological abuse the acts of parents or<br/>
&gt;other caretakers alone, without any harm evident in the child&#39;s behavior or<br/>
&gt;condition, such as parents, guardian or care givers use excessive, extreme<br/>
&gt;even sometimes bizarre forms of punishment, such as torture, or locking a<br/>
&gt;child in a dark closet. These also are sufficient to warrant the<br/>
&gt;intervention of Child Protective Services.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, that&#39;s it.  Also, anyone who has ever raised children knows that<br/>
&gt;although we can try to teach children responsibility for their actions, the<br/>
&gt;degree of responsibility is directly tied to the age and maturity of a<br/>
&gt;child.  A child at that age has the responsibility attention span of a gnat<br/>
&gt;(not a bad thing &lt;g&gt;), the curiosity of a cat and the urge to flutter<br/>
&gt;around like a butterfly from one magnet to another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of the true joys of unschooling is being able to let that imagination<br/>
&gt;run free to all those natural (and quite frequently messy &lt;g&gt;) conclusions.<br/>
&gt;  Attempts to stifle that with unrealistic expectations that don&#39;t match <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;age of the child coupled with the given outside stimulus usually results in<br/>
&gt;failure.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; A four year old is a child and if the child got away from an adult,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is the ADULT&#39;s responsibility!  Period!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You are absulutely right. It is my responsibility. I am responsible<br/>
&gt; &gt; for how I teach my children and at preasant the choices they make and<br/>
&gt; &gt; how I deal with those choices.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think Lynda was trying to say (correct me if I&#39;m wrong Lynda)... that<br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt; as the adult were responsible for your child running away and punishing<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; child for your lack of responsibility doesn&#39;t seem to make any sense...<br/>
&gt;There<br/>
&gt; &gt; is no judgement in that... It&#39;s just a fact... If you are the <br/>
&gt;responsible<br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a situation and something happens in that situations, then I would <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; apologizing to my son for not watching him well enough that he could get<br/>
&gt;away<br/>
&gt; &gt; from me, not hitting him for something that children do... They don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand at 4 yrs old they could get lost or someone could hurt <br/>
&gt;them...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They just see things that they like and off they go, which is why it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt; &gt; job as adults to not let that happen.  But why should your son suffer<br/>
&gt; &gt; consequences for your inability to take care of him?  It&#39;s just a<br/>
&gt;thought...<br/>
&gt; &gt; and one I only just thought off....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It doesn&#39;t make you a bad parent, just a typical reaction to the thought<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; you are not perfect and chose to take an action that wasn&#39;t appropriate<br/>
&gt;given<br/>
&gt; &gt; the situation.  Why is it so difficult to admit a mistake.  Spanking a<br/>
&gt;child<br/>
&gt; &gt; because they ran away when it was the responsibility of the adult to <br/>
&gt;make<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure they didn&#39;t run away doesn&#39;t make any logical sense to me and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; certainly wouldn&#39;t make any to a child.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;The problem I had was that you stated that you hit your child until your<br/>
&gt;hand hurt.  That presents a picture of going beyond a mere spanking and<br/>
&gt;certainly far beyond a swat on the fanny.  And the only reason that one<br/>
&gt;could have for pulling down the pants and hitting the bare bottom is to<br/>
&gt;make the experience more painful.  I have no problem with someone getting a<br/>
&gt;wake-up call such as a swift swat on their sitting down end or even a<br/>
&gt;couple of swift ones with their clothing on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The experience of having the pants pulled down is one which creates a<br/>
&gt;feeling of defenselessness, embarassment and degredation of self-esteem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, I am sure that there are other folks on the list that feel the same<br/>
&gt;as I do, children do not belong to us, they are simply put into our care<br/>
&gt;and they are not a sub species, they are simply SMALL people.  I would not<br/>
&gt;expect an adult to have their pants pulled down and get a beating,<br/>
&gt;therefore I do not do that to a child simply because they are smaller and I<br/>
&gt;have them in my power.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But what was the real clincher were a few other statements that you made.<br/>
&gt;Namely that your hubby feels they need a switch taken to them, that now is<br/>
&gt;the time to begin using a switch (like there is some rule written that says<br/>
&gt;at a certain age we begin using objects to hit children with) and you<br/>
&gt;repeated saying that you would probably do it again.  It was the sum total<br/>
&gt;of what you did added to what you said and what you said you would still<br/>
&gt;do.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I can see that it is your opinion that it doesn&#39;t matter what the<br/>
&gt; &gt; situation was. There is absolutely no good reason for spanking your<br/>
&gt; &gt; child. I can respect that opinion and I don&#39;t agree with it. I am not<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to defend myself any further because it is pointless. I agree<br/>
&gt; &gt; to disagree, as my mother tells me. And I can accept that. No hard<br/>

&gt;I found out why it&#39;s called &quot;_Wild_ Discovery&quot; when my two daughters <br/>
&gt;watched<br/>
&gt;the one about snakes. I never really thought about how snakes reproduce. I<br/>
&gt;kind of wish we still didn&#39;t know...I was in bed with a bad back when all<br/>
&gt;this happened. The next thing I hear is, &quot;Mommy! Snakes have penises!&quot; Oy.<br/>
&gt;It was a wild discovery, all right.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;This whole thread has reminded me of something I did when I<br/>
&gt;was little (3 or 4yo, I think).  Mum used to clean, and my big sis<br/>
&gt;babysit (I don&#39;t think we ever got sat on, but I couldn&#39;t swear to<br/>
&gt;that) for a neighbour of ours, and I used to go too.  Well this<br/>
&gt;woman had painted, in big red letters &#39;Don&#39;t let the b******s grind<br/>
&gt;you down!!!&#39; on her magnolia living room walls.  I took the<br/>
&gt;daughter of the house to get the can of paint, got it down, but it<br/>
&gt;fell, and got EVERYWHERE!!!  Well, we tried to clean it up, but<br/>
&gt;failed (I need to explain that my babysitting big sis was asleep at<br/>
&gt;this time) and went to the bathroom to clean ourselves.  And<br/>
&gt;accidentally made handprints (bright red paint, remember?) all the<br/>
&gt;way up the wall.  We were still upstairs when Mum came in, and<br/>
&gt;the front door opened onto the stairway, so she saw all these<br/>
&gt;handprints and thought someone had been slaughtered!  There<br/>
&gt;was paint everywhere.  It&#39;s one of those famous family tales now.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;On the subject of &#39;body-art&#39; my dh has a bit of a problem with<br/>
&gt;that, but I don&#39;t.  Particularly since dd2 (or ds2, for &#39;demon-spawn&#39;<br/>
&gt;not dear son...any fellow Dungeon Keepers out there?  LOL) told<br/>
&gt;me that she was drawing on herself &#39;for protection,&#39; totally<br/>
&gt;unprompted (ie i hadn&#39;t asked her what she was doing or why she<br/>
&gt;was doing it.)  I don&#39;t mess with natural talent *grin*<br/>

&gt;Mum tells a story of giving precise instructions to kids.  A friend<br/>
&gt;of hers was in bed feeling rough, and they were skint, too.  Her<br/>
&gt;daughter asked her if they had a clean hankercheif, they didn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;The mum told the girl to cut a square from a curtain.  She did.<br/>
&gt;Right in the middle of the curtain...  What can you do?  The child<br/>
&gt;did as she was told...<br/>

&gt; I had a bit of a surprise today when I read the CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION &<br/>
&gt; TREATMENT ACT/WHAT DEFINES ABUSE? regarding &quot;EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT&quot;  It said<br/>
&gt; that one form of educ. neglect was &quot;failure to enroll a child of mandatory<br/>
&gt; school age&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As unschoolers, do you enroll your child once they are school age???<br/>
<br/>
I do. Well, I submit a letter of intent to homeschool. Where we are, that&#39;s<br/>
conscidered having your child enrolled. I think what the act was refering to<br/>
is those that don&#39;t tell anyone they&#39;re hsing.<br/>

reporting your decission to hs to the state/school. If you do <br/>
call/write to inform the state, they basicly send out a packet that <br/>
gives very general info about sorces to use but don&#39;t endorce any one <br/>
sorce and if a truent officer comes to your door all you have to do <br/>
is tell them you are homeschooling. If they continue to come to your <br/>
door and press the issue they have a law suit on their hands. Corallyn</div>

We live in Florida and it is the law that the children be registered with the <br/>
county.  I have sent in a letter.  Once -- at the beginning of their hsing <br/>
career.  Then an annual evaluation after that.   <br/>
