&gt; I don&#39;t sweat that!  I&#39;m a long time confirmed office supply junky!  For two<br/>
&gt; of my longest term jobs that was part of my job.  Yummy fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Think of it as a bonus sale and just shop for yourself.<br/>

unschoolers paradise! We laugh and get excited and then we watch other people with <br/>
their lists of what &quot;school&quot; requires in supplies. Then we talk about how sad <br/>
it is that their purchases are based on someone elses wants, not to mention <br/>
the economic downfall that has devestated public schools. We were at Walmart <br/>
the other day and saw a teacher purchasing crayons for her whole class. It was <br/>
sad in so many ways.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we hope you all enjoy the great sales out there. I love buying stuff <br/>
we may never use, just because it was too cheap to pass up!!!<br/>

preschool.  It is LOADED with lots of great stuff.  I probably wont <br/>
buy anything from the catalog, but it gives me great ideas of things <br/>
to look for on Ebay!<br/>
