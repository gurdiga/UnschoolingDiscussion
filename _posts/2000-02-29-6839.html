This just reconfirms my choice to homeschool! And if this can happen in a<br/>
FIRST grade, then I don&#39;t even want to CONSIDER letting them go to high<br/>
school!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680552583">It&#39;s so wierd to come home and find this article on my email.  My in-laws just told me about this.  They live just a few miles from there and asked me if I had heard about it.  This is the kind of town where &quot;regular&quot; hard working families live - probably like where most of us live.  It&#39;s just sad.  I am so glad I have the priviledge of staying home with my kids and protecting them from a lot of this.  Can you imagine what a tragedy like this does to those little minds and emotions?<br/>
