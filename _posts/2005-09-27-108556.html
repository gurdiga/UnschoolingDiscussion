-=-So we&#39;re not very structured and if there is something more interesting <br/>
going on, or if the boys are reading a good book that they just can&#39;t put down <br/>
or are playing a game (not a video game or watching TV because my husband is <br/>
still against these things before 5pm), then we&#39;ll just skip &quot;lessons&quot; for the <br/>
day.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Compared to math-at-9:00, reading-at-10:00 it&#39;s not very structured, but <br/>
compared to unschooling, it&#39;s EXTREMELY structured.<br/>
<br/>
If your husband cares whether kids watch a movie or play a computer game <br/>
before 5:00 as opposed to after 5:00, he was not NEARLY ready for eliminating <br/>
bedtimes.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should buy Rue Kream&#39;s new book.   It might be what you both could <br/>
use.   <br/>

I know, but we WERE math-at-9:00, reading-at-10:00, so this is a HUGE step forward for us.  I would love to just drop all lessons completely, but it was like pulling teeth to get my husband to agree to even the relaxed version of things...unschooling is going to take him a while longer.  I would like to just do things my way, but I have to consider his feelings and input even if I don&#39;t always agree.<br/>

It&#39;s funny, but that is the thing he has had the least problem with.  He just can&#39;t/won&#39;t believe that the kids will choose wisely if allowed to choose what to learn.  But we are making progress...<br/>

This book sounds great. It seems like it addresses a lot of ideas that books like Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves didn&#39;t.  Thanks<br/>

before the horse?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe concentrate on making what you do really enjoyable, giving the  <br/>
kids a greater and greater voice in it?<br/>
<br/>
For example, SAXON MATH??? I just cannot imagine a 9 year old  <br/>
choosing Saxon 5/4 over all the absolutely WONDERFUL math materials  <br/>
out there in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Look at &lt;www.livingmath.net&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Julie Brennan - homeschooling mom in San Diego - has the best math  <br/>
website in the world there.<br/>
