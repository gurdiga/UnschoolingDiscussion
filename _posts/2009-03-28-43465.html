It&#39;s a shareware thing for $29.<br/>
I respond to the list by e-mail, and I have a spelling option for that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that spell checker will work when someone typing on a  <br/>
webpage.<br/>

When Holly was younger and wanted to spell more words, we got her a  <br/>
little handheld spelling dictionary from Radio Shack that would guess  <br/>
your word from a bad spelling, and play spelling games, and define  <br/>
words and show how to write them in cursive, with an animation  <br/>
program. She enjoyed that and I haven&#39;t mentioned it for a while.<br/>
