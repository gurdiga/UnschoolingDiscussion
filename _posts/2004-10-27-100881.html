<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008271636">I really liked the end bit:<br/>
<br/>
The notion of computer games as a potential teaching tool was <br/>
yesterday welcomed as worthy of further consideration by John <br/>
Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Potentially this has a lot to offer in making lessons interesting,&quot; <br/>
Dr Dunford said. &quot;As a maths teacher, I used games including darts to <br/>
teach multiplication and subtraction - we didn&#39;t actually play, but <br/>
we used the idea of points.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He did not play computer games himself, Dr Dunford admitted, &quot;but I <br/>
can see they use a logical thought process.&quot;<br/>
