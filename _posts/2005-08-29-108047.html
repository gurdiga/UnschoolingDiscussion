<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916656747">Great story.  When we start getting into a &quot;I thought you knew&quot; I always<br/>
tell them I cannot read their minds. I tell my girls...&quot;keep me informed of<br/>
what your plans are, you don&#39;t really want me to try to read you minds, do<br/>
you?!&quot;  The answer is always a resounding NO!<br/>
