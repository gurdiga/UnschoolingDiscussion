<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426400930">I&#39;ve realized I seem to post here when I mess up and/or need advice a <br/>
lot so I thought I&#39;d post a really good unschooling day.  I made a <br/>
lot of unschooling vs. schooling observations and a lot of <br/>
observations about the way I relate to my children compared to the <br/>
way I used to relate to my children.  <br/>
<br/>
We went to the Crayola Factory yesterday, which is a 2 hour car trip <br/>
for us.  We went at the request of Matt, who is usually a stay at <br/>
home kind of guy but really wanted to do this trip.   I used to be <br/>
pretty anal about us getting up at 6 am and getting there as soon as <br/>
a place opens. I used to have this weird desire to take in every <br/>
single possible thing there is to take in about every single place we <br/>
go instead of just enjoying our trips in the moment.  I realized that <br/>
everyone is grumpy when I do that, so I let us sleep in longer and we <br/>
didn&#39;t leave until 9:30.  We still had a full day and enjoyed <br/>
ourselves thoroughly, so I&#39;m glad I let go of that. <br/>
<br/>
When we got there Matt looked out the window of the parking garage <br/>
and said, &quot;Hey!  It says Crayola!&quot;  He&#39;s had moments of frustration <br/>
lately that he&#39;s not reading yet and he wishes he could read, so I <br/>
said, &quot;Cool!  And how fun that you read that!&quot;  He said, &quot;I didn&#39;t <br/>
read that.  I just remember what that word looks like from the <br/>
crayons&quot;.  I told him that&#39;s part of what reading is, and he seemed <br/>
happy about that.  <br/>
<br/>
When we got inside I realized that Alisha and I had forgotten our <br/>
cameras in the car.  I suggested going back out and get them but all <br/>
the kids said that they really didn&#39;t want to go back out to the <br/>
garage, so I gave up my &quot;need&quot; to follow them around taking pictures <br/>
of everything they do and just had fun without the camera.  <br/>
<br/>
The very first thing we came to in the Crayola factory was a <br/>
demonstration of how they make crayons.  We saw this 2 years ago when <br/>
we went to the Crayola factory and they didn&#39;t want to watch it. Nor <br/>
did they want to do a  paper bag puppet craft. (They&#39;ve made lots of <br/>
paper bag puppets at home).  Instantly, a voice in my head starting <br/>
worrying that they wouldn&#39;t want to do enough cool things and that <br/>
feeling of wanting to do every single thing we possibly could do hit <br/>
me for a second, but instead of listening to that voice and that <br/>
feeling, I said, &quot;Okay!&quot; and we moved on to some neat stuff.  Fun <br/>
house mirrors and writing on the glass wall with special markers.  <br/>
<br/>
At this time of the year there are often school groups at the Crayola <br/>
factory, and they&#39;re on a time schedule because they have to get back <br/>
to the school at a certain time.  They&#39;re always in groups of about 4 <br/>
plus an adult--I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a Crayola requirement.  I <br/>
noticed when we were writing on the films with markers and putting <br/>
them under the light so that the picture is projected onto the wall <br/>
that the school kids got to do it for just a few minutes and then <br/>
were rushed on to the next activity.  My kids played in that area for <br/>
a loooooong time and really did some creative slides.  <br/>
<br/>
In the model magic area, they gave out feathers and pipe cleaners <br/>
with the model magic and suggested making birds.  They also had <br/>
cookie cutters and rolling pins available.  I watched a lot of the <br/>
kids making their model magic creations and I didn&#39;t see any kids <br/>
other than mine who made things other than the suggested birds or <br/>
something from a cookie cutter.  Not that there&#39;s anything at all <br/>
wrong with making the suggested bird or using a cookie cutter, but it <br/>
was fun to see that it was the unschooled kids making unusual <br/>
characters with funny names.  They were also the only ones that I saw <br/>
laughing and having a REALLY good time with it.  Not that the other <br/>
kids weren&#39;t having a pleasant time, but my kids were obviously <br/>
having a REALLY good time.  <br/>
<br/>
Another activity was a painting activity.  You paint the paper and <br/>
then send it through a drying machine, then take it in and glue a <br/>
birds egg that looks like it&#39;s hatching onto it.  Luke wanted to <br/>
paint because he wanted to use the drying machine but he didn&#39;t want <br/>
to do the rest of the activity.  The old school-at-home me would have <br/>
insisted he did the craft the way they said to do it, but I let him <br/>
paint and do the drying machine and then move on.  There were two <br/>
boys standing by the drying machine who looked very excited about <br/>
getting their pictures out of the drying machine and the 2 women with <br/>
them (I think their moms) kept yelling and nagging at them to not <br/>
touch the conveyer belt and not stand so close to the machine, and <br/>
just stupid stuff.  Luke just stood there looking at those moms like <br/>
he couldn&#39;t figure them out (lol).  When the boys&#39; pictures were <br/>
through the machine, one of them  wanted to send them through a <br/>
second time but the mom said, &quot;No!  We&#39;re doing something else now! <br/>
Get away from there!&quot;  Yikes!  Why could the boys have not sent their <br/>
pictures through the drying machine again?  Luke got his picture out <br/>
and happily went on his way.  He knew I would have let him put it <br/>
through the drying machine as many times as he wanted.  <br/>
<br/>
On the top floor of the Crayola factory is the Canal Museum.  There&#39;s <br/>
a really cool water canal table there and all 3 kids really got into <br/>
it.  Then a school group of 4 girls came and just kind of pushed <br/>
their way into the table and took over.  Alisha and Matt just backed <br/>
off and sat beside me on the bench but Luke played for awhile <br/>
longer.  Alisha had me cracking up in her reactions to the chaperone <br/>
who was with them.  It&#39;s hard to describe in written form the <br/>
dramatic tone of voice he used when talking to these kids, but it was <br/>
pathetic.  Before they even got to the table he said (in a tone of <br/>
voice that indicated that he thought the people he was talking to had <br/>
very little intelligence and could barely understand English), before <br/>
you play in the water I want you to push up your sleeves.  And if you <br/>
can&#39;t push them up, ROLL them up (and he gestured with his hand to <br/>
show what rolling up looked like, lol).  These girls were maybe 7 or <br/>
8 years old.  I hadn&#39;t even thought to tell my kids to roll up their <br/>
sleeves first.  They did, without me telling them, and if they hadn&#39;t <br/>
I might have suggested it...but this guy didn&#39;t give these kids a <br/>
chance.  And then he stood there trying to explain stuff to them <br/>
about how he thought they should build their canal pieces instead of <br/>
just letting them play and figure some things out on their own. He <br/>
gave them a lecture about how when they got to the gift shop they <br/>
were to pick something little and how big things are for Christmas <br/>
and birthdays but not school field trips (and used his hands to show <br/>
the difference between big and litle in case a 7 year old child <br/>
didn&#39;t know the difference.  It was rather odd I thought, because I&#39;m <br/>
assuming his point was that they shouldn&#39;t expect to spend a lot of <br/>
money there, but he described it as though expensive things are big <br/>
in size and inexpensive things are small in size). Then when it was <br/>
time to go he told them to make sure they stayed together because <br/>
he&#39;d be SO SAD if he lost one of them.  If you heard his tone of <br/>
voice you&#39;d realize how hilarious yet sad it was.  Alisha (who&#39;s 11) <br/>
had no idea that I was spending so much time thinking about the <br/>
differences between schooled kids on a field trip and unschooling <br/>
kids having a fun day out.  She kept looking at me and raising her <br/>
eyebrows and rolling her eyes whenever he said something insulting to <br/>
the intelligence of those poor kids, and then when they left she <br/>
shook her head and did a perfect imitation of &quot;So sad...&quot;  But then <br/>
she pointed out that the guy kept telling all them all kinds of <br/>
stupid stuff but didn&#39;t point out to them that they had just taken <br/>
over something that someone else was working on.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a level of the canal museum about fabric.  One part lets <br/>
you design an outfit on a dummy using material.  Alisha designed an <br/>
outfit that she thought was neat and then wished she had her camera <br/>
because she wanted to remember it.  I told her we could go out and <br/>
get it although there would be a chance that someone else would come <br/>
along and change the outfit.  We took the chance and rushed to the <br/>
parking garage for the camera.  They were running along the sidewalk <br/>
racing to the parking garage and I was tempted to complain about how <br/>
fast they were going but then I told myself to just consider it <br/>
exercise and to be glad to see them so excited about being out and <br/>
doing something like this.  We got back up to the top floor with her <br/>
camera and it was still there.  She took lots of pictures of it and  <br/>
is now talking about trying to actually make a real outfit based on <br/>
that design.  I&#39;m going to have to really stretch myself to help her <br/>
out on that since I&#39;m NOT good at sewing and the sewing machine <br/>
intimidates me.  But I&#39;m determined to not model a bad attitude about <br/>
it to her.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a weaving wall, where you get these big rubbery things and <br/>
weave them in and out of poles.  Matt did his weaving the &quot;right&quot; way <br/>
on one side and Luke did his own thing on his side of the wall.  When <br/>
Luke was done he announced that he had made the place where Petey <br/>
piranha lives (from Sunshine Mario). Then he got his model magic out <br/>
of his bag (he ended up making Petey Piranha with model magic, lol) <br/>
and Petey Piranha &quot;hatched&quot; out of his nest and went around the <br/>
museum looking for places where he could eat dirt (it&#39;s a Sunshine <br/>
Mario thing).  We spent at least half an hour in the weaving <br/>
wall/fabric designing area and had SO much fun with it.  It was <br/>
another area that made me say, &quot;Wow!&quot;  with comparing another group <br/>
of kids.  It was either a school group or maybe even a homeschool <br/>
group of very conservative Christian kids.  The girls all had long <br/>
skirts and long hair pulled up in buns.  They came to the weaving <br/>
wall, listened to the talk that the volunteer museum guide offered <br/>
about weaving, and dutifully each took a turn weaving exactly the way <br/>
they were &quot;supposed&quot; to.  Then they moved on to the next display.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t see much joy in their faces.  I was sad for them, because it <br/>
was a place that was REALLY conducive to joy and creativity.  <br/>
<br/>
Luke was hungry and wanted to go to the mcdonalds that they have in <br/>
the building, so we went and got him a kids&#39; meal.  Alisha wanted a <br/>
kids meal for the toy, drink, and fries but didn&#39;t want the <br/>
cheeseburger or nuggets, so I got it for her anyway. (and it ended up <br/>
that Luke was extra hungry--growth spurt?--and ate her <br/>
cheeseburger).  I remembered that even hanging out at Mcdonalds can <br/>
be a fun place to be and learn so I didn&#39;t rush them through to get <br/>
to the next &quot;educational&quot; part of the trip.  We hung out in Mcdonalds <br/>
for awhile and played with the toys and it was just a really happy <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
We got some fun stuff in the Crayola store and will have lots and <br/>
lots of fun with them at home.  <br/>
<br/>
We stopped at the Pez museum on the way to the parking garage and we <br/>
found that interesting. Alisha is now very interested in adding to <br/>
our Pez dispenser collection.  (Which is cool because today while <br/>
shopping in a grocery liquidation store I found 6 pez dispensers for <br/>
a quarter each that I bought to add to our collection and she was <br/>
THRILLED).  <br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;m directionally challenged &lt;grin&gt;, I got us lost on the way <br/>
home.  When we were driving to Easton (the city where the Crayola <br/>
factory is) on route 22E, I mentioned to the kids that it said that <br/>
Easton&#39;s  exit is the last exit in Pennsylvania.  Well, on the way <br/>
back instead of getting on route 22 W I somehow ended up in the next <br/>
city--which is in New Jersey.  I found my way onto route 22W in that <br/>
city, but had to pay a 75 cent toll to get back into Pennsylvania.  <br/>
We laughed when we saw the &quot;Welcome to Pennsylvania&quot; sign.  Luke <br/>
said, &quot;Way to waste our money, Mom&quot; in a way that wasn&#39;t rude or <br/>
disrespectful but just kind of dry humor.  It was especially funny to <br/>
hear that kind of dry humor from a 5 year old, and very cool for me <br/>
to realize that he understood that we crossed a state line and came <br/>
back over it again and paid a toll to do so.  I was glad that, even <br/>
though I was kind of stressed out until I knew where I was going, I <br/>
kept talking to the kids and let them know what was going on.  <br/>
<br/>
We stopped at a pizza place on the way home.  The placemats were maps <br/>
of Italy, and Luke wanted to know if it was a map of all the pizza <br/>
places you could go to. ;)  I explained that since this is an Italian <br/>
restaurant they had a map of Italy. Luke said okay, but he was going <br/>
to pretend it&#39;s a map of pizza places.  Alisha read some of the facts <br/>
on the map to Matt, and they started being goofy and changing the <br/>
names of things to silly names.  After we ate our pizza we shared a <br/>
large cannoli.  It was the first time they&#39;d ever eaten a Cannoli and <br/>
we all enjoyed it. <br/>
<br/>
We got home and they told their dad all about their day before he <br/>
went to bed, and then we did our usualy night time routine of me <br/>
reading to Alisha and Matt and rubbing Luke&#39;s back to help him get to <br/>
sleep.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208704519">Sheila- thanks for that terrific story.  As a new unschooler, I so understand <br/>
what its like to let go of those rigid schooly ways, and how great it feels <br/>
when you see the results.  Unschooling is as much about how we parent as how <br/>
our children learn, until the two really become inseparable.  Even though I&#39;m <br/>
not religious, I compare becoming an unschooler to being a Born Again; it makes <br/>
you feel so sad for those who aren&#39;t &quot;saved.&quot;  It makes me want to rescue all <br/>
those children trapped in a world where the adults can&#39;t or won&#39;t listen to <br/>
their needs.<br/>
    Last night I took Skyler and Aric to see the highschool production of <br/>
Suessical, which was terrific.  But the huge crowd of talking people was really <br/>
tough on my HS boys.  We found  seats, and I suggested I sit in the middle.  <br/>
Aric seemed to panic, but couldn&#39;t tell me why.  Somehow I realized he was <br/>
afraid to have a stranger sit next to him.  Skyler really understood and <br/>
uncharacteristically gave up sitting next to me.  He was proud to be Aric&#39;s &quot;buffer.&quot;  <br/>
Aric covered his ears until the show began, and then chewed his shirt till <br/>
intermission.  It took a lot of silent reminders to myself, not to stop him for <br/>
the sake of the SHIRT?!  At intermission, figuring it was too much for them, I <br/>
gave them the option of leaving.  They totally wanted to stay!  We found an <br/>
empty section of the lobby to have our snack, and Skyler began imitating <br/>
different animals, sliding and crawling around the floor and under a table.  My knee <br/>
jerk reaction was Inappropriate! but I only said, &quot;You&#39;re going to get dirty,&quot; <br/>
hoping that would do the trick.  It was so hard for me to have people seeing <br/>
him behave this way and worrying how that reflected on my parenting.  Would <br/>
people think there was something wrong with this child?  Well, he sat up, and <br/>
calmly announced,&quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot;  So I stopped myself from saying anything and he <br/>
buffed up that floor for the next 10 minutes.  A tiny boy, maybe two years <br/>
old, watched transfixed, then got down and slid around and crawled too.  I was <br/>
telling myself, Skyler&#39;s &quot;acting out&quot; because he&#39;s stressed.  But then it <br/>
finally occurred to me that This Was Fun!  He may have been inspired by some of the <br/>
animal characters in the play and the acrobatic dancing, but mostly he was <br/>
just being my son, who sees this wide polished floor as a real opportunity for <br/>
fun.  It made me sad to think how highschool kids never got to use it that way, <br/>
maybe never even saw the possibilities.   At the end of intermission, we went <br/>
back in, all in a good mood, the boys because they&#39;d had their freedom, me <br/>
because I&#39;d had this ah ha moment.<br/>
    We drove home making lots of silly Dr. Suess-like rhymes, laughing our <br/>
butts off the whole way.  What a great night!  The kind of night I once would <br/>
have avoided; would have called a recipe for disaster, because I just couldn&#39;t <br/>
let go of how others would perceive my children and myself.  Thank God for <br/>
unschooling and all of my little mentors here on this list.<br/>
<br/>

Sheila, I loved reading about your day.  Thanks for posting it!  The <br/>
Crayola factory was recently featured on John Ratzenbrger&#39;s Made in <br/>
America on the Travel Channel and it looked like so much fun!  I really <br/>
enjoy that show and get ideas for neat places to visit and see how <br/>
various things are made.  <br/>

------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
School groups do tend to move through like it&#39;s miniature golf or an  <br/>
obstacle course, sometimes.   It&#39;s the school tradition of  &quot;They  told us we had to <br/>
do this, and we did it; give us our credit.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Four to an adult is better than larger groups, but it does mean lots of the  <br/>
adults will be parents who don&#39;t know those kids and aren&#39;t used to dealing <br/>
with  kids.  Not that teachers are always better than a volunteer adult, but  <br/>
sometimes the adults are REALLY green to the level of communications the kids  <br/>
need or can stand.<br/>
 <br/>
SOmetimes people criticize unschoolers (any homeschoolers) for badmouthing  <br/>
school.  Nothing causes school-shock in my kids like being in a public  place <br/>
surrounded by a school group.   I&#39;ve tried to tell them that  field trips are <br/>
the worst, because the kids are so excited to be OUT and have  some room to <br/>
move and to see some new surroundings.<br/>

Maybe mention to him that it&#39;s not standard to have to pay to cross state  <br/>
lines, nor even to drive on roads. you&#39;re in a part of  the country with  more <br/>
turnpikes and toll roads than are normal for the country in general.   He might <br/>
know that already, and he might not care yet.  Or he might just  think he&#39;s <br/>
saving a LOT Of money when he gets older and drives around the  country for <br/>
free (not counting gas, snacks, car upkeep, motels....  &lt;bwg&gt;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146037197">When I was a kid we went to a church with a big Parish Hall, and the <br/>
floor was polished wood, with tables along the sides, and nothing in <br/>
the center, from the entry to the end. It was mine and my brother&#39;s <br/>
favorite thing to do, to take off our shoes, get a running start, and <br/>
slide along that floor! The priest&#39;s wife (Episcopalian priests <br/>
marry) was quite controlling. Not a bad soul, but definitely had her <br/>
ideas about what children should and shouldn&#39;t do. She always ALWAYS <br/>
scolded us for doing that.<br/>
<br/>
So, we always ALWAYS waited for Mrs. E to be out of range, when we <br/>
started! LOL <br/>
<br/>
And we ALWAYS started! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259789615">Holly and Marty and I went to the zoo for a few hours, rode the new little  <br/>
train, saw a baby gorilla being raised by its OWN MOTHER!!!! WOW.  The zoo  has <br/>
another one, ten months old, being human-raised (and it spends its days  <br/>
where people can see it, and it wears a diaper and plays with toys, and a person  <br/>
rocks it can carries it all the time), but this younger one, four months, is  <br/>
with his own mom and it was really sweet to see her carry him around.  She  <br/>
was captivity-born too, in Albuquerque too.  (Yes, it would be better if no  <br/>
gorillas had ever been in zoos, I know, but things being what they are, this was  <br/>
relatively nice to see.)<br/>
 <br/>
New hippopotamus, some red river pigs (African pig with cool ears and  little <br/>
mane all down the ridge of its back), some new monkeys who weren&#39;t  labelled <br/>
yet.<br/>
 <br/>
We went to lunch and then went to Explora briefly to see their new heat  <br/>
exhibit (what Marty called it).  It&#39;s a thermal camera (I don&#39;t know its  real <br/>
name) and whatever is warm shows whiter and whatever&#39;s cooler is  darker.  There <br/>
were sheets of metal and heat-sensitive plastic and  plexiglass to play with, <br/>
for reflections and blockers and see-throughs.   There was a purple balloon <br/>
that only showed up like a soap bubble  (see-through).   Holly&#39;s nose was BLACK, <br/>
because for some reason it  was cold, and her fingers were dark too (cold) so <br/>
where she would touch her own  face or Marty&#39;s, it made dark finger prints.  <br/>
It was SO COOL.  <br/>
 <br/>
Marty said when they toured a fire station (dad of some unschoolers is a  <br/>
fireman and took some of the kids in one day to see a COOL tour), the most  <br/>
expensive piece of equipment they had was thermal-imagery binoculars they could  <br/>
use to try to find people who might be asleep or unconscious (I think that&#39;s  <br/>
what they were for).  <br/>
 <br/>
It was a fine afternoon, not planned in advance, just impromptu and  sweet.<br/>

I keep a diary in a WORD file on the computer, for each child.   Sometimes I <br/>
write a lot, sometimes very little.  Sometimes I write  something online and <br/>
save it in one kid&#39;s diary or another, too.  I should  print them out so even <br/>
if computers melt or fritz it&#39;s somewhere.  I have  backups on disk, but <br/>
magnetic media... fragile.<br/>

I love that I have my journal not only for me to go back and read, but for<br/>
my kids to have/read at some point.  Sometimes I already go back and read<br/>
things to them, like on their birthdays of the past or the first week we had<br/>
our horse, or some such thing.  It&#39;s really fun because I&#39;d never have<br/>
remembered the details on my own.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I tried to journal for years.  I&#39;d start with good intentions and then stop.<br/>
I actually hate the process of writing.physically holding the pencil and<br/>
making words.  What helped me was to get a journal program for the computer.<br/>
(I have Loki Diary, but there are a lot out there.) I don&#39;t mind typing at<br/>
all and that was the key to my success at keeping my journal.  I dropped all<br/>
writing expectations and made my goal to write something, anything down each<br/>
day for a week.  That got me started. Here and there I&#39;d forget to write for<br/>
a week or so, but then I&#39;d remember and start again.  I haven&#39;t missed many<br/>
days this last year.  I keep it right on my desk top so I see it when I sit<br/>
down at my computer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I actually started out by saving emails I&#39;d written and moved on to the<br/>
computer journal.  It has search features too, so if I want to look up<br/>
something I can search by word.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299230317">Hi Angela<br/>
I started a unschooling journal for each child 4 years ago. Some weeks it is hard to fit in time to write it but I am glad I did as it is a brilliant record of life now. It also serves duel purpose as I can explain what we have done ot the education people as well.  My older ones also keep journals of their own I have not sen and two do journals of places we visit with postcards in and tickets and pictures they have drawn and if they like the place or not lol e.t.c<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986865087">Some of my best writings now have been because I came across a quote from <br/>
when the kids were little, written at the time and I can &quot;update it&quot; with what&#39;s <br/>
happened since.  And on the other hand, some of the writings (things on the <br/>

I should link some of those from my page too!  It&#39;s a shame for them to fade <br/>
into the background totally.     If anyone knows where she is and could hook <br/>
me up on the side to ask her, maybe she has other, more recent writings she&#39;d <br/>
let me post.  <br/>

Kathleen Creech.  And I don&#39;t think that was her real, literal name (problems <br/>
with her ex, if I&#39;m not confusing her with another mom), so maybe one of you <br/>
is her and just can&#39;t tell us. &lt;g&gt;  That&#39;s always kind of comforted me, the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429065175">I am not in a state where record keeping is required by law, but I am very<br/>
curious how those of you who are, do keep track of what your children are<br/>
learning and if they are meeting the requirements.  Also, how do you know<br/>
what the requirements are?  I am very confident and comfortable with<br/>
unschooling, but my husband needs more reassurance.  So I was thinking of<br/>
doing some of this record keeping and keeping track of things as we learn<br/>
them so he can see what we learn while we are unschooling.  I am just not<br/>
sure how to do it.  Does anyone have advice?<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I am very interested in opinions on guiding children.  I do not force<br/>
my kids to do anything, but sometimes their creativity is lacking and I want<br/>
to make productive use of the &quot;mom what do I do&quot; time.  So how would I pick<br/>
something that would be &quot;useful&quot; and gently guide them into wanting to learn<br/>
about something new?<br/>
 <br/>
I am sure I will have tons more questions as I am new to the group but have<br/>
been reading through the posts.  Just a little about myself, we live in<br/>
Texas, and have 4 boys, ages 8,6,4, and 12 weeks.  We have been<br/>
homeschooling pretty much from the get go, we have used a variety of methods<br/>
from unschooling, notebooking, curriculum, etc.  I believe unschooling is<br/>
where I am happiest and so are they.  I look forward to getting to know you<br/>
all!<br/>

He may  have been inspired by some of the <br/>
animal characters in the play and the  acrobatic dancing, but mostly he was <br/>
just being my son, who sees this wide  polished floor as a real opportunity <br/>
for <br/>
fun.  It made me sad to  think how highschool kids never got to use it that <br/>
way, <br/>
maybe never even  saw the possibilities.   At the end of intermission, we <br/>
went  <br/>
back in, all in a good mood, the boys because they&#39;d had their freedom, me  <br/>
because I&#39;d had this ah ha moment.<br/>

You ARE NOT ALONE MOM.  You described my son to a T.  After 3  years of <br/>
unschooling, I have watched, observed and tracked the different  patterns that my <br/>
son exhibits.  I learned what triggers different things,  and through lots of <br/>
very gentle communication I have listened to my son&#39;s  interpretations of <br/>
different actions.  Now, he has adjusted his actions to  different settings.  I <br/>
totally understand what you used to react and how  hard it is to resist those <br/>
urges.  It&#39;s totally worth every minute of  unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933316101">thanks, Pam<br/>
<br/>
I clicked on the link Sandra provided and found two of *my* days, <br/>
from two years ago, on there! What a boost THAT was, I&#39;ll tell you. <br/>
It really has been a rough couple of years, and pretty easy to fall <br/>
into old patterns. I think we stayed in mode, mostly, but I got even <br/>
more doldrum-y and introspective than usual.<br/>
<br/>
I figure, that could just count as finishing up the deschooling <br/>
process for myself! right? Now time to get back in gear again.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, heidiC<br/>
