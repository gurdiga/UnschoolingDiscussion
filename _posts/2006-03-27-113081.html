<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999371305">My daughter has a friend through ballet whom she loves dearly.  She is<br/>
a beautiful dancer and an intelligent, creative, and spirited young<br/>
woman like both of her parents.  My daughter would like to spend more<br/>
time with her, but her mother does homeschooling in a different way<br/>
from us.  They use a classical curriculum that involves a lot of<br/>
reading and regular schoolwork.  I respect this family a lot and do<br/>
not want to seem a &quot;bad&quot; influence on their daughter when I do not<br/>
force schoolwork on my daughter.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, sometimes when I am around them I must admit that I begin to<br/>
feel like I have not done enough for my kids and that I must be lazy<br/>
or something.  I really do not want to impose a curriculum on my kids.<br/>
 I know that they are constantly learning and that it is real learning<br/>
only when it comes from a desire inside of them.  But, in the high<br/>
school years I sometimes hear that little voice asking me if I have<br/>
prepared them enough for whatever they decide to do, if I should be<br/>
pushing them more. Do you know what I mean?  I believe that they use<br/>
Ambleside Online which looks like a very demanding curriculum.  <br/>
<br/>
I have basically been avoiding the issue of how we homeschool in our<br/>
discussions.  This young woman may be coming over to visit this week,<br/>
but she says that she will have to bring her schoolwork with her.  I<br/>
guess my daughter can do something to keep herself busy while she is<br/>
here, but it seems so silly.  I know they would rather interact<br/>
instead.  These girls have a couple of hours of ballet a day and<br/>
finding time for them to be together otherwise is difficult.  <br/>
<br/>
Should I just come out of the closet?  <br/>

<br/>
Whose idea is it for your visitor to bring her schoolwork? I mean hers or<br/>
her Mom&#39;s? That would make a difference to how I might handle it, although<br/>
expressing your hope that the girls could just hang out together would<br/>
probably be helpful either way.<br/>
<br/>
Oh is your dd happy, enthusiastic and enjoying her life? You&#39;re probably<br/>
doing &quot;enough&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am really good at &quot;sour grapes&quot;.  I am fantastic at coming up with <br/>
ways in which my life is wonderful and other people&#39;s lives, who choose <br/>
not to live as I do, aren&#39;t as good.  So, with that in mind, is she <br/>
bringing the schoolwork because she wants to, truly wants to, or because <br/>
1) it is the only way her mother would let her come over to your house <br/>
for an undirected activity or 2) because she has bought into the idea <br/>
that the only way to get ahead in life is to strive, strive, strive?  In <br/>
the end, I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter.  In the end the only thing for me <br/>
that matters is my relationship with my children.  So, if this young, <br/>
intelligent, creative young woman and her family have a wonderful <br/>
relationship in spite of the pressures being placed on that relationship <br/>
through the use of a demanding curriculum, or any curriculum, than, <br/>
well, good for them.  For me, I don&#39;t think my relationship with Simon <br/>
and Linnaea would be as glorious as it is with the added burden of me <br/>
being the director of their educational attainment.  It would limit how <br/>
I see them.  It would put me in a position of monitoring their <br/>
activities to make sure they were achieving at an appropriate level, and <br/>
I could set that bar as high as I wanted.  I would reduce their <br/>
childhoods to a college application with appropriate extra-curricular <br/>
activities and achievement tests and grades based on whatever curriculum <br/>
I was using.  Instead everything they do is just about them doing <br/>
something.  Their lives are rich with now and not limited by some future <br/>
goal.  So, however down I might be in comparing my child with some other <br/>
child I would quickly be able to turn that around to feeling so happy <br/>
and so full of joy about who we are that there would be nothing to feel <br/>
sour about.<br/>
<br/>
About &quot;coming out&quot; as an unschooler, women are good at competition.  We <br/>
can be really good at subtly implying personal superiority that make <br/>
others feel somehow less than.  Not only have you been unwilling to <br/>
share your information, but you know exactly what curriculum the other <br/>
family is using.  This other family has made available to you <br/>
information about how they homeschool in such a way that lets you know <br/>
just how hard they work, how perfect and good they are.  Simon has a <br/>
friend who is in school whose mother is good at touting his skills.  She <br/>
is good at talking up his scholastic achievements.  However, she is also <br/>
really good at moaning about how burdensome he can be.  How hard it is <br/>
to keep him from playing on his PS2 and how they have to limit him to a <br/>
specific amount of time per day.  How he can be a complete klutz and an <br/>
absolute idiot about remembering things.  How he could get lost in his <br/>
own backyard.  So, because I listen I know she is willing to belittle <br/>
her child, her son to someone else in the hopes of painting a more <br/>
amusing picture of her life, as well as using him to raise her status by <br/>
demonstrating his academic competence. I know that her relationship with <br/>
him is defined by  1) advancing him through academic achievement and 2) <br/>
minimizing his leisure activities to (arbitrarily defined) reasonable <br/>
limits. Maybe if you listen to your daughter&#39;s friend and your <br/>
daughter&#39;s friend&#39;s mother you will see the cracks that can exist in a <br/>
relationship that is not based on the holism that unschooling tends to <br/>
lead to.  You may want to choose not to publicly state that you are <br/>
unschooling while not actively hiding your light under a bushel. You may <br/>
want to talk to your daughter about what she thinks would happen if you <br/>
&quot;came out&quot; to her friend and her friend&#39;s family. And you may just want <br/>
to follow your daughter&#39;s lead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This has been on my mind lately with neighbors that can&#39;t play because of  <br/>
homework and my kids &quot;best friends&quot; who happen to be their cousins unavailable  <br/>
because of all their &quot;school-work&quot; and chores at home. <br/>
 <br/>
My sister &quot;schools at home&quot; and we run into this often.  We always  call <br/>
first before going over because her kids are doing school and we really  never <br/>
know when they will finish.<br/>
My younger niece (11) has math, history, writing, reading, violin and more  <br/>
as well as household chores that must be complete before she can  play.  <br/>
Sometimes, she can&#39;t come over if she hasn&#39;t  completed  them.   Logan doesn&#39;t mind <br/>
at all helping his cousin  finish up her math but sometimes I get the idea <br/>
that my sister thinks that&#39;s  &quot;cheating&quot;  Very weird for us.<br/>
 <br/>
The older niece is 16 and is swamped with work.  She plays the piano 4  hours <br/>
a day, goes to music, voice, dance classes, takes online classes in  Spanish, <br/>
Chemistry, and Algebra 2, is studying for the SAT and goes to a  Huntington <br/>
learning center twice a week for tutoring  where they also give  her work to do <br/>
at home.  All with the ultimate goal of her getting into a  private college <br/>
next year and winning scholarships.  Certainly a different  path than we are on.<br/>
 <br/>
They have multiple performances with either the symphony or chamber music  or <br/>
music conservatory.  I&#39;m exhausted just writing about it.<br/>
 <br/>
These 4 cousins have been inseparable since they were very young but their  <br/>
work load now doesn&#39;t leave much time for them to just hang out.  We often  <br/>
stop by to see my mom who lives with them and the kids are just  not available.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it will be a great comparison story in about 5 years of 2 families  <br/>
who didn&#39;t have their kids in school but one was traditionally homeschooled  <br/>
and the other unschooled.  For now, though, it can be weird for me in  <br/>
conversations or even the morning phone call from Grandma...&quot;What are ya&#39;ll  doing?&quot;  <br/>
Well...the kids are still asleep but when Logan gets up we&#39;re  going to play <br/>
Halo 2 for awhile and figure out how to connect to X-Box  Live.  I&#39;m reading <br/>
e-mail and Brenna and I are going to make some  ATC&#39;s this afternoon.  We may <br/>
jump on the new trampoline for  awhile...&lt;g&gt;  Sounds like a great day to me!   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571341033">My sisters (one has since moved several states away) are<br/>
school-at-home moms.  Ds is by far the youngest cousin of the bunch. <br/>
He&#39;s 2 1/2 and the others are all at least 8 or 9.  My side of the<br/>
family is the one that gives me grief for &quot;still&quot; nursing ds.  Not fun<br/>
for me to visit.  Ds used to love it but now more than ever the<br/>
cousins are busy and rather schoolishly and parentally burdened.  <br/>
<br/>
So for our won peace of mind I quit calling for the embarrassing news<br/>
that they didn&#39;t have time for us to come over.  So much formality, so<br/>
little family.  Bleh.  Not worth it.  <br/>
<br/>
I decided it&#39;s more worth my time to go to playgroups once a week. <br/>
Our car&#39;s out of commission right now and we are stuck anyway but once<br/>
we get transportation up and running again, I&#39;ll be there so fast.  Ds<br/>
needs it and even at 2 1/2, he asks for it.  We&#39;re supposed to go<br/>
tomorrow but ds&#39; schedule is very late in the day getting up so I<br/>
doubt if we make it to take Daddy to work early so we can use his car.<br/>
 Maybe next week I&#39;ll have my car.  Fingers crossed.<br/>

If the international average age of weaning is 4 yrs. old, then how many 6-7-8,etc., yr. olds are nursing in other countries to offset the very young age of weaning in this country?

relates to academics or learning anything<br/>

He will complete work that I give him but not with heart. I have always  seen <br/>
that he has a high interest level in what he learns because he has always  <br/>
chosen the material.<br/>

Now all of a sudden he says he is not interested in anything just having  fun <br/>

and I currently have a fourteen year old girl.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re not unschooling, if you don&#39;t see his non-academic  <br/>
life as part of learning, or if you&#39;re LOOKING for or at an academic  <br/>
life, honestly.<br/>
<br/>
Just last fall you were sending me things about Saxon math.  Until  <br/>
you let go of those things and those ideas, unschooling will not be  <br/>
happening at your house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He will complete work that I give him but not with heart. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I started to ask what kind of work you&#39;re giving him, but I really,  <br/>
truly, don&#39;t want to know.<br/>
Schoolwork does wound kids&#39; hearts and souls.  It doesn&#39;t matter  <br/>
whether the schoolwork is given at school or at home, but if you&#39;ve  <br/>
told him you&#39;re unschooling and THEN giving him work, no wonder his  <br/>
heart isn&#39;t in it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have always  seen<br/>
that he has a high interest level in what he learns because he has  <br/>
always<br/>
chosen the material.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the chosen material was anything LIKE &quot;school material&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;academic material,&quot; then you have created your bed and you will  <br/>
either have to lie in it or get out, completely disassemble it and  <br/>
start on a new and very different path.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Now all of a sudden he says he is not interested in anything just  <br/>
having  fun<br/>
and no learning is not &quot;fun&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
No, learning is NOT fun when it is made separate from a happy life.<br/>
Learning is fun when you&#39;re learning from playing and watching movies  <br/>
and singing songs and going places with your family and having  <br/>
interesting people over and playing with stuff and reading fun trivia  <br/>
magazines and goofing around.<br/>
<br/>
Were you picturing unschooling to be something other than that?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am sure many go through this but it ils my first time with the  <br/>
challenge. -=-<br/>
<br/>
What you described is not a part of unschooling, so I&#39;m sure many go  <br/>
through it, but not unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Hope to get some good ideas, what do you  think????-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think you should NOT respond to this post, but take your energy to  <br/>
these two pages<br/>

and don&#39;t just let the words wash over you like a momentary massage,  <br/>
but DO those things.  CHANGE your life, change your thinking, your  <br/>
words, your responses, your expectations, be different.  Don&#39;t go  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106218159">Today, I called my dad. I forgot to tell him happy<br/>
birthday yesterday. I&#39;ve been so sick. SO,<br/>
understandably I forgot. However, my parents have<br/>
never said they support or don&#39;t support my<br/>
homeschooling efforts with my son. They just kinda<br/>
ignore me if I ask what their thoughts are. <br/>
Through our conversation, I told my dad what my son<br/>
did yesterday. He watched The Simpson&#39;s all day long.<br/>
I was surprised when my dad supported it. It got us<br/>
talking about how some colleges have classes in tv and<br/>
games. I was just surprised. <br/>
The Simpson&#39;s got my husband and I talking too. We<br/>
talked about the episode called Bart&#39;s a genius. It&#39;s<br/>
so sad, how parents don&#39;t give their children what<br/>
they need unless they excel/prove themselves worthy,<br/>
especially of something so essenital as love. <br/>
Sorry if this is clouded, my head is spinning. Time to<br/>
go back to bed. <br/>

Unschoolingbasics explores how to GET to unschooling. This list is a<br/>
bit advanced if you&#39;re still giving him work!!<br/>
<br/>
Let go of your ideas of what learning looks like. Trust that anything<br/>
your child is interested in, is learning. Read some books about<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772492702">I don&#39;t even go there.  Stats would be so unconvincing and some folk<br/>
are &quot;always&quot; right.  Another &quot;not worth it&quot; ---to me anyway.  YMMV. <br/>
I&#39;ve had zero luck convincing people (other than dh who has to live<br/>
with me too, ya know... ;).  And anyway, even though it would feel<br/>
wonderful to have agreement, I can live without it too.  Some say I<br/>
like to do things backwards for purposes of calling attention to<br/>
myself.  I&#39;m just here at home.  I don&#39;t feel the need for an audience<br/>
so not sure where that idea originates but from being miffed.<br/>
<br/>
Especially since I&#39;m only 42 ;0 (old? mommy) and may not end up having<br/>
another child, I&#39;m in NO hurry to wean for petee&#39;s sake.  :-ppp~~~~ <br/>
I&#39;m having too much fun being a mom to worry with anyone&#39;s opinion of<br/>
how I should be one.  <br/>
<br/>
Although I find *some* opinions to be really quite wonderfully the<br/>
most helpful things imaginable.  Imagine that.  <br/>

&gt; never said they support or don&#39;t support my<br/>

&gt; Through our conversation, I told my dad what my son<br/>
&gt; did yesterday. He watched The Simpson&#39;s all day long.<br/>
&gt; I was surprised when my dad supported it. It got us<br/>
&gt; talking about how some colleges have classes in tv and<br/>

offer classes in porn and related issues (women&#39;s studies, legal <br/>
issues, cultural issues, and so on). Some actually screen porn <br/>
movies in class while others &quot;only&quot; have issues of magazines and <br/>
lists of links to websites.<br/>
<br/>
DH is currently taking a continuing ed class (5 weeks one night per <br/>
week) in C++ game programming, just for fun. If you have digital <br/>
cable, check out the G4 channel at 10 pm or later some night - ads <br/>
galore for degree programs and certificates and stuff in things like <br/>
game programming, graphics, and all things game related.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040530253">I wont say I am completely THERE yet but some of the things that my boys 10 and 12 have shown an interest in include.... Making fossils, Freezing insects, blogging, building things, measuring things, working out my taxes with me.<br/>
<br/>
Other things which they have shown an interest in include making a science fair project, making a history fair project, art and painting studies, sculpture, photography and sport.<br/>
<br/>
I admit I still do a few formal things with them during the week and have certain expectations on them such as expecting them to do some form of writing each day, some form of reading each day and some form of math each day. These can all be done in line with their interests or I will assign something if they can&#39;t come up with something for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I also limit their electronic entertainment as I find that when this is not available they come up with so many more creative pursuits and interests that I rarely have to guide or direct them at all.<br/>
<br/>
We are also making an effort to find somewhere interesting to go each week that will broaden their education and interests.<br/>
<br/>
So I am far from a perfect unschooler but I do take a relaxed interest based approach as much as I possible can. Incidentally I actually prefer not to wear any label as we are constantly evolving and growing in our homeschooling journey.<br/>

&gt; This subject just brought to mind something related but a bit off of the  <br/>
&gt; subject<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I am hoping to get some of your thoughts and ideas about what are some  <br/>
&gt; things to do when you see your child(14 boy) not interested in doing anything  that <br/>
&gt; relates to academics or learning anything<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; He will complete work that I give him but not with heart. I have always  seen <br/>
&gt; that he has a high interest level in what he learns because he has always  <br/>
&gt; chosen the material.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Now all of a sudden he says he is not interested in anything just having  fun <br/>
&gt; and no learning is not &quot;fun&quot;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I am sure many go through this but it ils my first time with the challenge. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Hope to get some good ideas, what do you  think????<br/>

<br/>
This is a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I admit I still do a few formal things with them during the week  <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
If you didn&#39;t have a house you would probably manage to find a  <br/>
creative place to sleep.  But the purpose of unschooling is learning,  <br/>
not control.  The purpose of pursuits and interests isn&#39;t to find the  <br/>
second best.   You will never need to guide or direct your children at  <br/>
all if you engage in learning *with them* every day, all the time.   <br/>
You won&#39;t need to fear &quot;electronic entertainment&quot; (do you call books  <br/>
&quot;paper entertainment&quot;?) if you would look into it some more and see  <br/>
how much is really involved.<br/>
<br/>
Recommendations that will lead people away from unschooling aren&#39;t  <br/>
good for the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
The joy you could have with your children now and in the future is  <br/>
beyond most people&#39;s imagination.  I had no idea, when I started 18  <br/>
years ago how fantastic it could be.  I had no idea, no models, for  <br/>
the kind of relationship I have with my kids who are nearly-18,  <br/>
nearly-21 and 23.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone on this list says &quot;Oh; no problem&quot; or &quot;good job&quot; to a  <br/>
description of limiting life and teaching &quot;formal things&quot; and  <br/>
assigning writing and math, they will be assisting you down the path  <br/>
that leads away from unschooling to &quot;just whatever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there is a &quot;just whatever&quot; discussion list, but this isn&#39;t it.<br/>

There&#39;s more here, but here&#39;s part of it:<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
The Deeper Effect of a Child Learning to Read: Confidence<br/>
<br/>
a Mom in a discussion online: A homeschooling friend has shared that  <br/>
she feels we need to teach the basics then unschool them.<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll:Your friend is wrong. If she&#39;s never experienced a  <br/>
child who learned to read or do math without instruction then of  <br/>
course she&#39;s not going to be able to imagine it&#39;s possible.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd: If what the friend is imagining is that a child who reads  <br/>
will then acquire all the other knowledge on her own, that&#39;s not the  <br/>
worst vision in the world If what the friend is hoping is the child  <br/>
will get past the point that the mom worries about getting in trouble  <br/>
or failing entirely, I can understand her reasoning.</div>
