PS _ having worked in Hotels, I have to say I agree about the Red Cross. <br/>
The send vouchers to get people rooms but it is like pulling teeth to get<br/>
them dealt with.  I&#39;ll take trucking companies and insurance claims<br/>
anyday over a Red Cross voucher!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Bridget &lt;waving&gt; good to see you too! Life has kept me very busy <br/>
lately but I was in the mood to get plugged in for some unschool <br/>
support. I&#39;ve been on this list a few times but usually as a quiet <br/>
lurker.... believe that or not. :-)<br/>
<br/>
in peace,<br/>

is just a matter of finding time. DH is working at the firehouse 36 <br/>
out of every 72 hours so its been crazy around here.<br/>
Glad to see familiar faces. Love the conversations and I look forward <br/>
to chatting more.<br/>
