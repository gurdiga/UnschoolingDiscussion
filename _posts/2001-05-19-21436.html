<div id="ygrps-yiv-511959730">I&#39;ve been reading the digests of this list for weeks now.  I even hesitate<br/>
to point this out, knowing I&#39;ll probably get dumped on by some major<br/>
pyrotechnics, but here goes.<br/>
<br/>
One of the greatest factors for success of homeschooling is the fact that we<br/>
can individualize for our children and our family needs.  No one solution is<br/>
going to work for each and every situation ... thus the various methods of<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The flames are getting high and writers are allowing personalities to<br/>
overshadow the concept of homeschooling here.  In fact, I haven&#39;t heard much<br/>
on unschooling at all ... mostly flames being sprayed venemously when<br/>
opinions differ.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling at its very heart means complete individualization for the<br/>
child&#39;s sake.  Since each child is so individual, the parental approach to<br/>
the child and the child&#39;s need (regardless of what that need is) will also<br/>
be individual.  Sarcasm and irony are carrying definitions to extreme on<br/>
both sides (i.e., stress, boundaries, fundamentalism, discipline, etc.)<br/>
rather than accepting individualization needs and definitions.<br/>
<br/>
One person may have a child who never needs to be taught about dangers (such<br/>
as a hot stove) because the information seems innate.  On the other hand,<br/>
this same parent may have another child who tests the boundaries of common<br/>
sense at every turn requiring a stronger discipline by the parent.<br/>
Personally I have four children and each child requires a different tact ...<br/>
from an almost hands-off approach to one that requires much more strong<br/>
boundaries of behavior and consequences.<br/>
<br/>
A list that is supposed to be discussing unschooling is not, in my opinion,<br/>
the best venue for discussing parenting issues and choices.  So, for the<br/>
sake of the continued viability of this group and the  members that are<br/>
trying to get information on unschooling and how best to implement this<br/>
approach, please either moderate your discussions to be more civil, send<br/>
your emails off-list, or take them to another list all together where<br/>
parenting issues are the topic.<br/>
<br/>
There are 505 members (number checked on 5/19) belonging to this group and<br/>
only a very small percentage are participating in the flames; however, the<br/>
small percentage doing so, are basically &quot;shouting&quot; so much that there is<br/>
much less opportunity to discuss the method of unschooling and are driving<br/>
away members who could really offer some wonderful suggestions on how the<br/>
unschooling method has worked for them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-740125720">Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I do see what you are saying; however, I did say that unschooling was <br/>
a way of meeting the child&#39;s needs &quot;no matter what those needs might <br/>
be&quot; referring to whether the need was educational or otherwise ... <br/>
including parental issues.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I agree that unschooling requires that boundaries be <br/>
explored and concepts loosened.  On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily mean that ALL boundaries are transient and loose ALL the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I successfully unschool one of my four children because that is the <br/>
method that works best with her ... based on needs and <br/>
personality ... but do not unschool the other three.  On the other <br/>
hand we have set rules and consequences in this house that some would <br/>
view as authoritarian in style.  So, in my personal opinion and <br/>
experience, unschooling and authoritarianism do not necessarily <br/>
preclude one another.<br/>
<br/>
As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some <br/>
of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to <br/>
education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called <br/>
most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are <br/>
completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable <br/>
solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would <br/>
say is patently false.<br/>
<br/>
I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and <br/>
apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with <br/>
any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for <br/>
it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the <br/>
open what I felt was a serious concern.  Again, my apologies.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>is the only viable solution to meeting our needs. It is not a way of <br/>
educating or really even a way of learning, but a way of life, a way of being <br/>
in this world. It encompasses everything we say and do in our home and how we <br/>
approach those outside of it. At times I feel a failure at it, but then I <br/>
realize that failure is not possible, as the journey is what is important and <br/>
being able to accept all that the journey entails.<br/>
<br/>
It may not be for everyone, but one might assume that unschooling is the <br/>
approach those on this list have chosen and are interested in discussing. <br/>
Email lists always go through ebbs and flows of discussing things . . . the <br/>
beauty is in letting them be whatever or wherever they are at any given <br/>
moment. . . hmmm, sounds kind of like how I describe unschooling. Go figure! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434480367">Kathy -- I&#39;m interested in how you define unschooling. I personally have <br/>
found unschooling to be a door that has opened that requires me to question <br/>
EVERYTHING. Everything that I accepted growing up as an unquestionable truth, <br/>
bestowed upon me by trusted grown-ups, is now open for me to hold up to the <br/>
light and judge for myself. <br/>
<br/>
For my children and myself, unschooling can&#39;t be described as a &quot;method of <br/>
education&quot; (like &quot;classical education&quot; &quot;structured education&quot;, &quot;school at <br/>
home&quot;). It truly is a lifestyle choice. Help me to understand how you view <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;. I&#39;ve heard people say that for them, unschooling is about what <br/>
works for a particular child. (&quot;Works?&quot;) That is way too broad a definition <br/>
of  what I hold to be unschooling. Besides, who is deciding what works? I&#39;m <br/>
betting not the child.<br/>
<br/>
More and more on this and other lists, I&#39;m seeing two camps of people who <br/>
call themselves unschoolers. And I&#39;m confused.<br/>

on this list for a few months now and it seems this list is manipulated by a<br/>
few very opinionated loudmouths that don&#39;t have much to say, but to belittle<br/>
and screw words around!  When someone comes on this list that does have<br/>
something useful to say, like Valerie for example, she is shut-up and by the<br/>
list moderator no doubt!   This list should be called flame-schooling!  I am<br/>
going to find an unschooling list that doesn&#39;t tolerate this type of thing<br/>
by the moderator and allows people with something useful to say, talk.<br/>
Like my mother always said, &quot;Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one<br/>
and they all stink!&quot;<br/>
Good-bye to all of the nice people that are still trying to work it out and<br/>
to all of the newbies that are trying to get good information, run, run as<br/>
fast as you can to a real unschooling list!  And good riddance to the<br/>

Subject: Sandra, I see part of your point<br/>
<br/>
Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I do see what you are saying; however, I did say that unschooling was<br/>
a way of meeting the child&#39;s needs &quot;no matter what those needs might<br/>
be&quot; referring to whether the need was educational or otherwise ...<br/>
including parental issues.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I agree that unschooling requires that boundaries be<br/>
explored and concepts loosened.  On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily mean that ALL boundaries are transient and loose ALL the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I successfully unschool one of my four children because that is the<br/>
method that works best with her ... based on needs and<br/>
personality ... but do not unschool the other three.  On the other<br/>
hand we have set rules and consequences in this house that some would<br/>
view as authoritarian in style.  So, in my personal opinion and<br/>
experience, unschooling and authoritarianism do not necessarily<br/>
preclude one another.<br/>
<br/>
As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some<br/>
of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to<br/>
education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called<br/>
most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are<br/>
completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable<br/>
solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would<br/>
say is patently false.<br/>
<br/>
I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and<br/>
apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with<br/>
any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for<br/>
it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>
open what I felt was a serious concern.  Again, my apologies.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433303100">Laura,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read this a couple of times and admit that it could be taken the <br/>
wrong way, but I&#39;ve made a real effort to be objective yet truthful <br/>
and hope that I don&#39;t upset you or hurt your feelings.  I&#39;ve tried to <br/>
knock off the rough edges.  Your questions gave me the opportunity to <br/>
try and put into words things I don&#39;t normally have to.  Labels and <br/>
absolute definitions are something that I have always found only <br/>
questionalbly useful; although I do believe that some absolutes are <br/>
fact rather than transient.  So anywho, here it is ..... &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, let me try and answer your first question.  I define <br/>
homeschooling as the lifestyle, and unschooling as one method to <br/>
implement that lifestyle.  This isn&#39;t exactly what I mean but it is <br/>
very close.  To me homeschooling isn&#39;t just an educational choice but <br/>
the way we live our lives ... we chose to be in control of our family <br/>
choices, including the education of our children.  Now I don&#39;t mean <br/>
control as in &quot;strangle hold&quot; with no flexibility or sensibilities to <br/>
our children&#39;s needs and wants (or of the beliefs of others), but <br/>
more as in belief in the right to be self-directed without the gross <br/>
interference of family, friends, or &quot;well-meaning&quot; agencies or <br/>
groups.  Self-directed as parents, as children, and as a family.  <br/>
But, with the realization that we are fully accountable for all of <br/>
our choices and actions.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, you say that you see unschooling as a door that &quot;requires&quot; <br/>
you &quot;to question EVERYTHING. Everything that I accepted growing up as <br/>
an unquestionable truth, bestowed upon me by trusted grown-ups, is <br/>
now open for me to hold up to the light and judge for myself.&quot;  <br/>
Actually that is the definition my husband and I were raised to <br/>
believe came with adulthood in general.  Our parents, traditional in <br/>
their parenting styles and discipline, raised us to understand that <br/>
they could raise us as children, but adulthood came after we were <br/>
capable of making our own decisions based on our own beliefs ... even <br/>
if those beliefs wound up being different from theirs.  It is often <br/>
called the &quot;age of accountablility.&quot;  I guess the analogy is that you <br/>
can only hold a child&#39;s hand so long before they need to learn to <br/>
walk on their own ... and they have the right to fall down or succeed <br/>
based on their own choices and skills.  That is also the way we are <br/>
raising our children ... but more as an issue of maturity than of <br/>
ideology.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the best way that one of my children learn.  Self-<br/>
directed, experiential, with lots of real life application.  She <br/>
needs to have more control over things going on around her or she <br/>
over reacts and stresses out.  I don&#39;t mean that she is bossy or <br/>
selfish ... just that her personality is best suited towards this <br/>
method at this time.  So long as she continues to progress, as <br/>
opposed to going stale or plateauing, I will allow her that freedom <br/>
wihtout putting suggestions in.  Its a choice that I&#39;ve had to make <br/>
as a parent for her (she is only 5 years old) based on her learning <br/>
style and regardless of how I was at her age.  On the other hand my <br/>
older two do much better with directed study and with parameters to <br/>
work inside.  My oldest does well with this and will then go into <br/>
self-directed study ... but won&#39;t do so on her own initially.  My <br/>
son, 8 years, does not do well without boundaries at all.  He <br/>
exhibits very poor thinking and decision skills although he has <br/>
improved dramatically over the last year.  While it may partly be an <br/>
issue of maturity ... I know him well enough to know though that this <br/>
is not the only issue causing these behaviors.  He is a tester and is <br/>
not happy until he has found the boundaries that he must live with.  <br/>
He has done some very foolish and unsafe behaviors and we have had to <br/>
chose how to deal with them.  My two year old lies somewhere amidst <br/>
these differences and we aren&#39;t pushing her.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that I&#39;ve been able to clarify my stance without sounding <br/>
pompous.  It drives me crazy to read something I wrote and later find <br/>
that it sounded like I was lecturing.  This is certainly not my <br/>
intent!  One of the best things about homeschooling to me is the <br/>
ability to individualize for the children and the family.  What works <br/>
for me is not necessarily going to work for anyone else.  Even <br/>
lifestyle choices, methods of implementation, and ideology concerning <br/>
all of these differ from person to person and family to family.<br/>

&gt;You are so right and I have had it up to here with this list!  I have been<br/>
&gt;on this list for a few months now and it seems this list is manipulated by <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;few very opinionated loudmouths that don&#39;t have much to say, but to <br/>
&gt;belittle<br/>
&gt;and screw words around!  When someone comes on this list that does have<br/>
&gt;something useful to say, like Valerie for example, she is shut-up and by <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;list moderator no doubt!   This list should be called flame-schooling!  I <br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt;going to find an unschooling list that doesn&#39;t tolerate this type of thing<br/>
&gt;by the moderator and allows people with something useful to say, talk.<br/>
&gt;Like my mother always said, &quot;Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one<br/>
&gt;and they all stink!&quot;<br/>
&gt;Good-bye to all of the nice people that are still trying to work it out and<br/>
&gt;to all of the newbies that are trying to get good information, run, run as<br/>
&gt;fast as you can to a real unschooling list!  And good riddance to the<br/>
&gt;big-mouthed, frustrated, opinionated bitches that have no life except to <br/>
&gt;try<br/>
&gt;to run down someone else&#39;s opinions, I feel sorry for your children!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of the greatest factors for success of homeschooling is the fact that <br/>
&gt;we<br/>

&gt;much<br/>
&gt;on unschooling at all ... mostly flames being sprayed venomously when<br/>
&gt;opinions differ.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unschooling at its very heart means complete individualization for the<br/>
&gt;child&#39;s sake.  Since each child is so individual, the parental approach to<br/>
&gt;the child and the child&#39;s need (regardless of what that need is) will also<br/>
&gt;be individual.  Sarcasm and irony are carrying definitions to extreme on<br/>
&gt;both sides (i.e., stress, boundaries, fundamentalism, discipline, etc.)<br/>
&gt;rather than accepting individualization needs and definitions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One person may have a child who never needs to be taught about dangers <br/>
&gt;(such<br/>
&gt;as a hot stove) because the information seems innate.  On the other hand,<br/>
&gt;this same parent may have another child who tests the boundaries of common<br/>
&gt;sense at every turn requiring a stronger discipline by the parent.<br/>
&gt;Personally I have four children and each child requires a different tact <br/>
&gt;...<br/>
&gt;from an almost hands-off approach to one that requires much more strong<br/>
&gt;boundaries of behavior and consequences.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;My apologies.  I went and re-read the list description and it<br/>
&gt;basically told me that if I wanted info on unschooling, I&#39;d only get<br/>
&gt;it at the website ... this list being strictly networking, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I still say that some of you all are way too rough with one another<br/>
&gt;as concerns differing opinions ... I&#39;m sure this is not how you would<br/>
&gt;handle your own children or normal public conversation.  This list<br/>
&gt;could be a great place to network on unschooling info ... but its not<br/>
&gt;described that way, nor has it been working that way ... so I am<br/>
&gt;bowing out and taking my feet with me so that I don&#39;t trip all over<br/>
&gt;them again &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While I might describe this as an interesting experience, its been a<br/>
&gt;bit nasty and venomously confrontational, neither of which is<br/>
&gt;something that I espouse or wish my kids to learn in their<br/>
&gt;homeschooling or home life.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the greatest factors for success of<br/>

&gt; allowing personalities to<br/>
&gt; overshadow the concept of homeschooling here. <br/>
&gt; In fact, I haven&#39;t heard much<br/>
&gt; on unschooling at all ... mostly flames being<br/>
&gt; sprayed venemously when<br/>
&gt; opinions differ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling at its very heart means complete<br/>
&gt; individualization for the<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s sake.  Since each child is so<br/>
&gt; individual, the parental approach to<br/>
&gt; the child and the child&#39;s need (regardless of<br/>
&gt; what that need is) will also<br/>
&gt; be individual.  Sarcasm and irony are carrying<br/>
&gt; definitions to extreme on<br/>
&gt; both sides (i.e., stress, boundaries,<br/>
&gt; fundamentalism, discipline, etc.)<br/>
&gt; rather than accepting individualization needs<br/>
&gt; and definitions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One person may have a child who never needs to<br/>
&gt; be taught about dangers (such<br/>
&gt; as a hot stove) because the information seems<br/>
&gt; innate.  On the other hand,<br/>
&gt; this same parent may have another child who<br/>
&gt; tests the boundaries of common<br/>
&gt; sense at every turn requiring a stronger<br/>
&gt; discipline by the parent.<br/>
&gt; Personally I have four children and each child<br/>
&gt; requires a different tact ...<br/>
&gt; from an almost hands-off approach to one that<br/>
&gt; requires much more strong<br/>
&gt; boundaries of behavior and consequences.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A list that is supposed to be discussing<br/>
&gt; unschooling is not, in my opinion,<br/>
&gt; the best venue for discussing parenting issues<br/>
&gt; and choices.  So, for the<br/>
&gt; sake of the continued viability of this group<br/>

&gt; parenting issues are the topic.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are 505 members (number checked on 5/19)<br/>
&gt; belonging to this group and<br/>
&gt; only a very small percentage are participating<br/>

&gt; You are so right and I have had it up to here with this list!  I have been<br/>
&gt; on this list for a few months now and it seems this list is manipulated by<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; few very opinionated loudmouths that don&#39;t have much to say, but to<br/>
belittle<br/>
&gt; and screw words around!  When someone comes on this list that does have<br/>
&gt; something useful to say, like Valerie for example, she is shut-up and by<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; list moderator no doubt!   This list should be called flame-schooling!  I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; going to find an unschooling list that doesn&#39;t tolerate this type of thing<br/>
&gt; by the moderator and allows people with something useful to say, talk.<br/>
&gt; Like my mother always said, &quot;Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one<br/>
&gt; and they all stink!&quot;<br/>
&gt; Good-bye to all of the nice people that are still trying to work it out<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; to all of the newbies that are trying to get good information, run, run as<br/>
&gt; fast as you can to a real unschooling list!  And good riddance to the<br/>
&gt; big-mouthed, frustrated, opinionated bitches that have no life except to<br/>
try<br/>
&gt; to run down someone else&#39;s opinions, I feel sorry for your children!<br/>

&gt; &gt; pyrotechnics, but here goes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One of the greatest factors for success of homeschooling is the<br/>
&gt; fact that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; can individualize for our children and our family needs.  No one<br/>
&gt; solution is<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to work for each and every situation ... thus the various<br/>
&gt; methods of<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The flames are getting high and writers are allowing personalities<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; overshadow the concept of homeschooling here.  In fact, I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; heard much<br/>
&gt; &gt; on unschooling at all ... mostly flames being sprayed venomously<br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinions differ.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unschooling at its very heart means complete individualization for<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; child&#39;s sake.  Since each child is so individual, the parental<br/>
&gt; approach to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the child and the child&#39;s need (regardless of what that need is)<br/>
&gt; will also<br/>
&gt; &gt; be individual.  Sarcasm and irony are carrying definitions to<br/>
&gt; extreme on<br/>
&gt; &gt; both sides (i.e., stress, boundaries, fundamentalism, discipline,<br/>
&gt; etc.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; rather than accepting individualization needs and definitions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One person may have a child who never needs to be taught about<br/>
&gt; dangers (such<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a hot stove) because the information seems innate.  On the other<br/>
&gt; hand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; this same parent may have another child who tests the boundaries of<br/>
&gt; common<br/>
&gt; &gt; sense at every turn requiring a stronger discipline by the parent.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Personally I have four children and each child requires a different<br/>
&gt; tact ...<br/>
&gt; &gt; from an almost hands-off approach to one that requires much more<br/>
&gt; strong<br/>
&gt; &gt; boundaries of behavior and consequences.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A list that is supposed to be discussing unschooling is not, in my<br/>
&gt; opinion,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the best venue for discussing parenting issues and choices.  So,<br/>
&gt; for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; sake of the continued viability of this group and the  members that<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to get information on unschooling and how best to implement<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; approach, please either moderate your discussions to be more civil,<br/>
&gt; send<br/>
&gt; &gt; your emails off-list, or take them to another list all together<br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt; &gt; parenting issues are the topic.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are 505 members (number checked on 5/19) belonging to this<br/>
&gt; group and<br/>
&gt; &gt; only a very small percentage are participating in the flames;<br/>
&gt; however, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; small percentage doing so, are basically &quot;shouting&quot; so much that<br/>
&gt; there is<br/>
&gt; &gt; much less opportunity to discuss the method of unschooling and are<br/>
&gt; driving<br/>
&gt; &gt; away members who could really offer some wonderful suggestions on<br/>
&gt; how the<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling method has worked for them.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Sandra, I see part of your point<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sandra,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do see what you are saying; however, I did say that unschooling was<br/>
&gt; a way of meeting the child&#39;s needs &quot;no matter what those needs might<br/>
&gt; be&quot; referring to whether the need was educational or otherwise ...<br/>
&gt; including parental issues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And yes, I agree that unschooling requires that boundaries be<br/>
&gt; explored and concepts loosened.  On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; necessarily mean that ALL boundaries are transient and loose ALL the<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I successfully unschool one of my four children because that is the<br/>
&gt; method that works best with her ... based on needs and<br/>
&gt; personality ... but do not unschool the other three.  On the other<br/>
&gt; hand we have set rules and consequences in this house that some would<br/>
&gt; view as authoritarian in style.  So, in my personal opinion and<br/>
&gt; experience, unschooling and authoritarianism do not necessarily<br/>
&gt; preclude one another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some<br/>
&gt; of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to<br/>
&gt; education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called<br/>
&gt; most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are<br/>
&gt; completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable<br/>
&gt; solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would<br/>
&gt; say is patently false.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and<br/>
&gt; apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with<br/>
&gt; any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for<br/>
&gt; it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>
&gt; open what I felt was a serious concern.  Again, my apologies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But unschooling is a parenting issue and a parenting choice, and<br/>
&gt; without<br/>
&gt; &gt; loosening some controls, parents cannot successfully unschool.<br/>
&gt; Nine years<br/>
&gt; &gt; ago I might have said &quot;might not be able to successfully unschool,&quot;<br/>
&gt; but after<br/>
&gt; &gt; years of being at, in and around unschooling, I have seen<br/>
&gt; repeatedly that<br/>
&gt; &gt; families unable to loosen up don&#39;t succeed at unschooling, and<br/>
&gt; families who<br/>
&gt; &gt; do succeed at unschooling loosen up in other areas.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Options are not unlimited, and the definition of unschooing doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; encompass<br/>
&gt; &gt; all educational options on the whole planet.<br/>

&gt;This list isn&#39;t moderated and no one has ever been &quot;shut-up&quot; by the<br/>
&gt;imaginary moderator as long as I&#39;ve been on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And, just a hint for folks that are new to the net, profiles are public<br/>
&gt;information and quite a few folks (moi being one &lt;g&gt;) believe in giving<br/>
&gt;&quot;mis&quot; information as they don&#39;t believe that any of that sort of info is<br/>
&gt;anyone else&#39;s business.  Soooo, if you read profiles and expect to learn<br/>
&gt;anything, take them with a grain of salt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course, then again, if one had the sense god gave a rutabaga one might<br/>
&gt;have gotten a hint from the rest of the profile which lists my age as 99 <br/>

&gt; &gt; You are so right and I have had it up to here with this list!  I have <br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt; &gt; on this list for a few months now and it seems this list is manipulated <br/>
&gt;by<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few very opinionated loudmouths that don&#39;t have much to say, but to<br/>
&gt;belittle<br/>
&gt; &gt; and screw words around!  When someone comes on this list that does have<br/>
&gt; &gt; something useful to say, like Valerie for example, she is shut-up and by<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; list moderator no doubt!   This list should be called flame-schooling!  <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to find an unschooling list that doesn&#39;t tolerate this type of <br/>
&gt;thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; by the moderator and allows people with something useful to say, talk.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Like my mother always said, &quot;Opinions are like assholes, everyone has <br/>
&gt;one<br/>
&gt; &gt; and they all stink!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good-bye to all of the nice people that are still trying to work it out<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; to all of the newbies that are trying to get good information, run, run <br/>
&gt;as<br/>
&gt; &gt; fast as you can to a real unschooling list!  And good riddance to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; big-mouthed, frustrated, opinionated bitches that have no life except to<br/>
&gt;try<br/>
&gt; &gt; to run down someone else&#39;s opinions, I feel sorry for your children!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Kim<br/>

&gt; &gt; p.s.  Isn&#39;t it so nice to have such wonderful hobbies?  This is from <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My apologies.  I went and re-read the list description and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; basically told me that if I wanted info on unschooling, I&#39;d only get<br/>
&gt; &gt; it at the website ... this list being strictly networking, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I still say that some of you all are way too rough with one another<br/>
&gt; &gt; as concerns differing opinions ... I&#39;m sure this is not how you would<br/>
&gt; &gt; handle your own children or normal public conversation.  This list<br/>
&gt; &gt; could be a great place to network on unschooling info ... but its not<br/>
&gt; &gt; described that way, nor has it been working that way ... so I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; bowing out and taking my feet with me so that I don&#39;t trip all over<br/>
&gt; &gt; them again &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; While I might describe this as an interesting experience, its been a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit nasty and venomously confrontational, neither of which is<br/>

&gt; &gt; As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to<br/>
&gt; &gt; education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called<br/>
&gt; &gt; most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable<br/>
&gt; &gt; solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would<br/>
&gt; &gt; say is patently false.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and<br/>
&gt; &gt; apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with<br/>
&gt; &gt; any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>
&gt; &gt; open what I felt was a serious concern.  Again, my apologies.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A list that is supposed to be discussing unschooling is not, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my opinion,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best venue for discussing parenting issues and choices.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But unschooling is a parenting issue and a parenting choice, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; loosening some controls, parents cannot successfully unschool.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nine years<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ago I might have said &quot;might not be able to successfully unschool,&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; but after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; years of being at, in and around unschooling, I have seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; repeatedly that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; families unable to loosen up don&#39;t succeed at unschooling, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; families who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do succeed at unschooling loosen up in other areas.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Options are not unlimited, and the definition of unschooing doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; encompass<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all educational options on the whole planet.<br/>

discussions as we are of those earnestly wanting to learn about how <br/>
unschooling can best work.<br/>
<br/>
This is the shorter version:<br/>

&lt;&lt;It sounds like unschooling isn&#39;t for you if you don&#39;t like any opinions at <br/>
all. Kimme&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;This list isn&#39;t moderated and no one has ever been &quot;shut-up&quot; by the<br/>
&gt; &gt;imaginary moderator as long as I&#39;ve been on it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;And, just a hint for folks that are new to the net, profiles are public<br/>
&gt; &gt;information and quite a few folks (moi being one &lt;g&gt;) believe in giving<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;mis&quot; information as they don&#39;t believe that any of that sort of info is<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone else&#39;s business.  Soooo, if you read profiles and expect to learn<br/>
&gt; &gt;anything, take them with a grain of salt.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Of course, then again, if one had the sense god gave a rutabaga one might<br/>
&gt; &gt;have gotten a hint from the rest of the profile which lists my age as 99<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; You are so right and I have had it up to here with this list!  I have<br/>
&gt; &gt;been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on this list for a few months now and it seems this list is<br/>
manipulated<br/>
&gt; &gt;by<br/>
&gt; &gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few very opinionated loudmouths that don&#39;t have much to say, but to<br/>
&gt; &gt;belittle<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and screw words around!  When someone comes on this list that does<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something useful to say, like Valerie for example, she is shut-up and<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; list moderator no doubt!   This list should be called flame-schooling!<br/>
&gt; &gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to find an unschooling list that doesn&#39;t tolerate this type of<br/>
&gt; &gt;thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the moderator and allows people with something useful to say, talk.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Like my mother always said, &quot;Opinions are like assholes, everyone has<br/>
&gt; &gt;one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and they all stink!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Good-bye to all of the nice people that are still trying to work it<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to all of the newbies that are trying to get good information, run,<br/>
run<br/>
&gt; &gt;as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fast as you can to a real unschooling list!  And good riddance to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; big-mouthed, frustrated, opinionated bitches that have no life except<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to run down someone else&#39;s opinions, I feel sorry for your children!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been reading the digests of this list for weeks now.  I even<br/>
&gt; &gt;hesitate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to point this out, knowing I&#39;ll probably get dumped on by some major<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pyrotechnics, but here goes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest factors for success of homeschooling is the fact<br/>
&gt; &gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt;we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can individualize for our children and our family needs.  No one<br/>
&gt; &gt;solution<br/>
&gt; &gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to work for each and every situation ... thus the various<br/>
methods<br/>
&gt; &gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; homeschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The flames are getting high and writers are allowing personalities to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; overshadow the concept of homeschooling here.  In fact, I haven&#39;t<br/>
heard<br/>
&gt; &gt;much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on unschooling at all ... mostly flames being sprayed venomously when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinions differ.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Unschooling at its very heart means complete individualization for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; child&#39;s sake.  Since each child is so individual, the parental<br/>
approach<br/>
&gt; &gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the child and the child&#39;s need (regardless of what that need is) will<br/>
&gt; &gt;also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be individual.  Sarcasm and irony are carrying definitions to extreme<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; both sides (i.e., stress, boundaries, fundamentalism, discipline,<br/>
etc.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than accepting individualization needs and definitions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; One person may have a child who never needs to be taught about dangers<br/>
&gt; &gt;(such<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a hot stove) because the information seems innate.  On the other<br/>
&gt; &gt;hand,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this same parent may have another child who tests the boundaries of<br/>
&gt; &gt;common<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sense at every turn requiring a stronger discipline by the parent.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I have four children and each child requires a different<br/>
tact<br/>
&gt; &gt;...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from an almost hands-off approach to one that requires much more<br/>
strong<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boundaries of behavior and consequences.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A list that is supposed to be discussing unschooling is not, in my<br/>
&gt; &gt;opinion,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the best venue for discussing parenting issues and choices.  So, for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sake of the continued viability of this group and the  members that<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to get information on unschooling and how best to implement<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; approach, please either moderate your discussions to be more civil,<br/>
send<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; your emails off-list, or take them to another list all together where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parenting issues are the topic.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are 505 members (number checked on 5/19) belonging to this group<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only a very small percentage are participating in the flames; however,<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; small percentage doing so, are basically &quot;shouting&quot; so much that there<br/>
&gt; &gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; much less opportunity to discuss the method of unschooling and are<br/>
&gt; &gt;driving<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; away members who could really offer some wonderful suggestions on how<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My apologies.  I went and re-read the list description and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; basically told me that if I wanted info on unschooling, I&#39;d only get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it at the website ... this list being strictly networking, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I still say that some of you all are way too rough with one another<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as concerns differing opinions ... I&#39;m sure this is not how you would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handle your own children or normal public conversation.  This list<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could be a great place to network on unschooling info ... but its not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; described that way, nor has it been working that way ... so I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bowing out and taking my feet with me so that I don&#39;t trip all over<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them again &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; While I might describe this as an interesting experience, its been a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bit nasty and venomously confrontational, neither of which is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something that I espouse or wish my kids to learn in their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; homeschooling or home life.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; there is<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Sandra, I see part of your point<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sandra,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do see what you are saying; however, I did say that unschooling was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a way of meeting the child&#39;s needs &quot;no matter what those needs might<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be&quot; referring to whether the need was educational or otherwise ...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; including parental issues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And yes, I agree that unschooling requires that boundaries be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; explored and concepts loosened.  On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily mean that ALL boundaries are transient and loose ALL the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I successfully unschool one of my four children because that is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; method that works best with her ... based on needs and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; personality ... but do not unschool the other three.  On the other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hand we have set rules and consequences in this house that some would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; view as authoritarian in style.  So, in my personal opinion and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience, unschooling and authoritarianism do not necessarily<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; preclude one another.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; say is patently false.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; open what I felt was a serious concern.  Again, my apologies.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A list that is supposed to be discussing unschooling is not, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my opinion,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best venue for discussing parenting issues and choices.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But unschooling is a parenting issue and a parenting choice, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loosening some controls, parents cannot successfully unschool.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nine years<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ago I might have said &quot;might not be able to successfully unschool,&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years of being at, in and around unschooling, I have seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; repeatedly that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; families unable to loosen up don&#39;t succeed at unschooling, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; families who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do succeed at unschooling loosen up in other areas.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Options are not unlimited, and the definition of unschooing doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; encompass<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all educational options on the whole planet.<br/>

  Hey, the silly thing wouldn&#39;t accept OAD (Old As Dirt) and wouldn&#39;t take an<br/>
  age over 99.  Personally I was thinking more in the hundreds.  I mean, I&#39;ve<br/>
  survived the teen years of 4 birth kidlets, 7 foster kidlets and multiple<br/>
  &quot;walking wounded&quot; the kidlets have &quot;adopted&quot; and brought home.  That&#39;s gotta<br/>
  count when you tally up the years, right &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  &gt; &gt;This list isn&#39;t moderated and no one has ever been &quot;shut-up&quot; by the<br/>
  &gt; &gt;imaginary moderator as long as I&#39;ve been on it.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;And, just a hint for folks that are new to the net, profiles are public<br/>
  &gt; &gt;information and quite a few folks (moi being one &lt;g&gt;) believe in giving<br/>
  &gt; &gt;&quot;mis&quot; information as they don&#39;t believe that any of that sort of info is<br/>
  &gt; &gt;anyone else&#39;s business.  Soooo, if you read profiles and expect to learn<br/>
  &gt; &gt;anything, take them with a grain of salt.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;Of course, then again, if one had the sense god gave a rutabaga one might<br/>
  &gt; &gt;have gotten a hint from the rest of the profile which lists my age as 99<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: the flames are getting a bit high around here<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been reading the digests of this list for weeks now.  I even<br/>
  &gt; &gt;hesitate<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; to point this out, knowing I&#39;ll probably get dumped on by some major<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; pyrotechnics, but here goes.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest factors for success of homeschooling is the fact<br/>
  &gt; &gt;that<br/>
  &gt; &gt;we<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; can individualize for our children and our family needs.  No one<br/>
  &gt; &gt;solution<br/>
  &gt; &gt;is<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; going to work for each and every situation ... thus the various<br/>
  methods<br/>
  &gt; &gt;of<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; homeschooling.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; The flames are getting high and writers are allowing personalities to<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; overshadow the concept of homeschooling here.  In fact, I haven&#39;t<br/>
  heard<br/>
  &gt; &gt;much<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; on unschooling at all ... mostly flames being sprayed venomously when<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; opinions differ.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Unschooling at its very heart means complete individualization for the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; child&#39;s sake.  Since each child is so individual, the parental<br/>
  approach<br/>
  &gt; &gt;to<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; the child and the child&#39;s need (regardless of what that need is) will<br/>
  &gt; &gt;also<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; be individual.  Sarcasm and irony are carrying definitions to extreme<br/>
  on<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; both sides (i.e., stress, boundaries, fundamentalism, discipline,<br/>
  etc.)<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; rather than accepting individualization needs and definitions.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; One person may have a child who never needs to be taught about dangers<br/>
  &gt; &gt;(such<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; as a hot stove) because the information seems innate.  On the other<br/>
  &gt; &gt;hand,<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; A list that is supposed to be discussing unschooling is not, in my<br/>
  &gt; &gt;opinion,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; the best venue for discussing parenting issues and choices.  So, for<br/>
  the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; sake of the continued viability of this group and the  members that<br/>
  are<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to get information on unschooling and how best to implement<br/>
  this<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; approach, please either moderate your discussions to be more civil,<br/>
  send<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; your emails off-list, or take them to another list all together where<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; parenting issues are the topic.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 505 members (number checked on 5/19) belonging to this group<br/>
  &gt; &gt;and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; only a very small percentage are participating in the flames; however,<br/>
  &gt; &gt;the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; small percentage doing so, are basically &quot;shouting&quot; so much that there<br/>
  &gt; &gt;is<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; much less opportunity to discuss the method of unschooling and are<br/>
  &gt; &gt;driving<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; away members who could really offer some wonderful suggestions on how<br/>
  &gt; &gt;the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; unschooling method has worked for them.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: the flames are getting a bit high around here<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; My apologies.  I went and re-read the list description and it<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; basically told me that if I wanted info on unschooling, I&#39;d only get<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; it at the website ... this list being strictly networking, etc.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I still say that some of you all are way too rough with one another<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; as concerns differing opinions ... I&#39;m sure this is not how you would<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; handle your own children or normal public conversation.  This list<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; could be a great place to network on unschooling info ... but its not<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; described that way, nor has it been working that way ... so I am<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; bowing out and taking my feet with me so that I don&#39;t trip all over<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; them again &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; While I might describe this as an interesting experience, its been a<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; bit nasty and venomously confrontational, neither of which is<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; something that I espouse or wish my kids to learn in their<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; homeschooling or home life.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been reading the digests of this list for weeks now.  I even<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; hesitate<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to point this out, knowing I&#39;ll probably get dumped on by some major<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pyrotechnics, but here goes.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest factors for success of homeschooling is the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; fact that we<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can individualize for our children and our family needs.  No one<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; solution is<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to work for each and every situation ... thus the various<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; methods of<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; homeschooling.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The flames are getting high and writers are allowing personalities<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overshadow the concept of homeschooling here.  In fact, I haven&#39;t<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; heard much<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on unschooling at all ... mostly flames being sprayed venomously<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; when<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opinions differ.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unschooling at its very heart means complete individualization for<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; child&#39;s sake.  Since each child is so individual, the parental<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; approach to<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the child and the child&#39;s need (regardless of what that need is)<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; will also<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be individual.  Sarcasm and irony are carrying definitions to<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; extreme on<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both sides (i.e., stress, boundaries, fundamentalism, discipline,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; etc.)<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather than accepting individualization needs and definitions.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One person may have a child who never needs to be taught about<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; dangers (such<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a hot stove) because the information seems innate.  On the other<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; hand,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this same parent may have another child who tests the boundaries of<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; common<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Sandra, I see part of your point<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Sandra,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I do see what you are saying; however, I did say that unschooling was<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; a way of meeting the child&#39;s needs &quot;no matter what those needs might<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; be&quot; referring to whether the need was educational or otherwise ...<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; including parental issues.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; And yes, I agree that unschooling requires that boundaries be<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; explored and concepts loosened.  On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily mean that ALL boundaries are transient and loose ALL the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; time.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I successfully unschool one of my four children because that is the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; method that works best with her ... based on needs and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; personality ... but do not unschool the other three.  On the other<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; hand we have set rules and consequences in this house that some would<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; view as authoritarian in style.  So, in my personal opinion and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; experience, unschooling and authoritarianism do not necessarily<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; preclude one another.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; As for necessity of &quot;loosening up&quot; ... that could well describe some<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; of the posts to this list lately.  Unschooling is not THE approach to<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; education or parenting ... it is one of them.  Some so-called<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; most &quot;open minded&quot; individuals are actually writing as if they are<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; completely closed minded in that Unschooling is the ONLY viable<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; solution to a family and/or child&#39;s needs which I believe many would<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; say is patently false.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I posted that I had mistaken the description of this list and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; apologized for it.  I will remain on here long enough to deal with<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; any fall out from my original post because I feel responsible for<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; it.  It was not meant to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings but to bring into the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; open what I felt was a serious concern.  Again, my apologies.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But unschooling is a parenting issue and a parenting choice, and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; without<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loosening some controls, parents cannot successfully unschool.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Nine years<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ago I might have said &quot;might not be able to successfully unschool,&quot;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; but after<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years of being at, in and around unschooling, I have seen<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; repeatedly that<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; families unable to loosen up don&#39;t succeed at unschooling, and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; families who<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do succeed at unschooling loosen up in other areas.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Options are not unlimited, and the definition of unschooing doesn&#39;t<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; encompass<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all educational options on the whole planet.<br/>
