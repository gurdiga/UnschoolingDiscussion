<br/>
In general (with plenty of exceptions), children seem to prefer fruits and<br/>
sweeter veggies.  I remember disliking or refusing certain vegetables as a<br/>
child, that I now LOVE (Brussels sprouts to name one).  My husband wouldn&#39;t<br/>
taste tomatoes until he was 18.  Now he eats them.<br/>
<br/>
A common idea is that children will eat any vegetable if they have ranch dip<br/>
with it.  My kids hate ranch dip.<br/>
<br/>
Fruits and vegetables are somewhat interchangeable nutritionally, since they<br/>
all provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber but tend to be low in protein and<br/>
mostly non-fat.  Fruits are mostly higher in calories than vegetables.  Not<br/>
usually a concern for kids.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids like smoothies, blends of fruits and vegetables might be<br/>
appealing to them.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best thing is to make both fruits and vegetables available, eat<br/>
both yourself, and not worry about it.<br/>

I tend to put out veggie on a platter along with other things. So ds <br/>
asked for marshmellows and I put them, some carrots, grapes, and <br/>
pretzels on a plate. The kids finished the marshmellows quickly and <br/>
asked for more, which I got without hestitation. Then they polished <br/>
off everything on the plate!<br/>
<br/>
A summer favorite here is frozen peas and corn. <br/>
