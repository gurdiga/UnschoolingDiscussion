<div id="ygrps-yiv-790604240">Well, I do think stress can play a part in asthma.  I&#39;ve had attacks that<br/>
were partly stress related.  BUT, I&#39;ve never had an attack that was<br/>
entirely due to stress.  I have however, had attacks that were entirely<br/>
due to allergens in my environment.<br/>
