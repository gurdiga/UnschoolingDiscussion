<br/>
This website is wonderful.  While not as large as I am sure it will be one day, it is full of many more things than Pagan Childcare.  It has Playgroup listings, family ritual and holiday activities, links to Pagan homeschooling and Unschooling Website and message boards, and many other things.  It is a wonderful thing for a Pagan family like ours.  Thanks again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051132646">I&#39;ll tell Lisa you said so!  She also sells home-made skin-care <br/>
products, all natural ingredients.  She&#39;s in Oregon, so if you can <br/>
get to any of the country fairs around there, you might find her.  <br/>
This is a shameless plug for my bestest bestest friend &lt;g&gt;<br/>
