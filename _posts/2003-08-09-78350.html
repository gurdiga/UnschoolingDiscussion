master (DH runs the games for the kids) and the rest are the &#39;characters&#39;.<br/>

Borders. The books tell you how to roll the characters etc etc. Simple <br/>
scenarios can be bought from games shops if your Dungeon Master doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to design his own world and scenario.<br/>
Ebay has a whole bunch of &#39;used&#39; Guides and scenarios.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I really have no idea where you get one.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The gaming shop people took Marty to last year.<br/>
A new edition just came out.  You might be able to get the prior edition <br/>
cheap now.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you call a big used book store they will have one OR they&#39;ll know <br/>
which book store deals in used gaming stuff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen the books in Barnes and Noble and other big book stores.<br/>
<br/>
TSR also put out a beginner&#39;s game that has a bunch of short scenarios that<br/>
introduce the rules and slowly build up the complexity of the game. It&#39;s<br/>
called the Dungeon and Dragon&#39;s Adventure Game: The Adventure Begins Here!<br/>
It&#39;s in a flat box, about the size of one of the manuals. You don&#39;t need<br/>
anything extra to play it. It comes with the relevant portions of the<br/>
manuals. It was only $9.99 at Barnes and Noble.<br/>
