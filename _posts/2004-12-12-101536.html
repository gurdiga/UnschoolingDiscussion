<div id="ygrps-yiv-316549953">&lt;&lt; 2. Don&#39;t respond to tattling.<br/>
Once they figure out that you aren&#39;t listening, they&#39;ll stop doing it so <br/>
much. Or when they&#39;re mid-bicker, ignore them and do something odd -- like <br/>
crawl <br/>
under the dining room table with a book. That&#39;ll stop the argument in its <br/>
tracks, and they might even come join you. (Works for tantrums too!)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ignore them and they&#39;ll go away.<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s true.<br/>
But first they might do some REAL damage to themselves or others.<br/>
And the parent will have done irreparable damage to the relationship between <br/>
herself and the children.<br/>
<br/>
If I called the police a few times and they ignored me, I would stop doing it <br/>
so much.  But is that the role of safety officers, to ignore calls for help?  <br/>
I think a mother&#39;s prime job is the immediate safety of her young children.   <br/>
Children who are treated as this suggestion recommends, ignored by the adults <br/>
around them, might NEVER be as safe when they&#39;re out and about as those who <br/>
have been helped to develop sensible solutions to disagreements, based on p<br/>
rinciples of consideration and peaceful interactions and safe behavior.<br/>
<br/>
The distraction and humor suggestion isn&#39;t so bad, but it seems a trick for <br/>
the use of a mom who HAS no better ideas than to turn clownish.  And the <br/>
dispute between the kids wasn&#39;t resolved at all, and when it comes up again they&#39;ll <br/>
know no more than they do this time about how to make peace or to get help <br/>
when the problem is beyond their three- or five- or ten-year-old understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I think first that there&#39;s a deep problem in wording.  &quot;Tattling&quot; has a bad <br/>
connotation, and &quot;tattling is bad.&quot;  &quot;Tattlers&quot; are bad.   So I have never ever <br/>
used that word with my kids.   If they want to tell me about a problem <br/>
they&#39;re having, or report something that scared them or that they didn&#39;t know how to <br/>
handle, that&#39;s WONDERFUL.  That&#39;s what our relationship has been about <br/>
always.  It&#39;s not &quot;tattling&quot; to come and say &quot;Marc is throwing sand in the babies&#39; <br/>
eyes&quot; at the park.  It&#39;s not &quot;tattling&quot; to say &quot;Laurie has my bike and won&#39;t <br/>
give it back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If an adult was being pelted with rocks (the equivalent of sand to babies), <br/>
or someone had his car and wouldn&#39;t give it back, the police would be there <br/>
pretty quickly.  They wouldn&#39;t respond to a 911 call with &quot;Don&#39;t tattle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So these special &quot;ignore it&quot; rules for children are just another way to treat <br/>
them as less than fully human, and I don&#39;t like that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my kids were really little my mom had told me to differentiate <br/>
between &quot;tattling&quot; and &quot;reporting&quot; and to make sure that the kids knew <br/>
that &quot;reporting&quot; was great for them to do. So that is how I thought of <br/>
it, from the beginning. And - lots of times what somebody else calls <br/>
&quot;tattling&quot; is really very clearly &quot;reporting,&quot; such as &quot;Marc is <br/>
throwing sand in the babies&#39; eyes.&quot; This is information that the kid <br/>
thinks the adult should have. Sometimes the parent doesn&#39;t need to know <br/>
or need to act on it, but the kid doesn&#39;t know that. Sometimes kids <br/>
come to Krisula at the park and say, &quot;Anika is up really high on the <br/>
slide.&quot; They think she&#39;s too high and that her mom needs to do <br/>
something, but Krisula knows that she&#39;s okay up there. That&#39;s still <br/>
&quot;reporting&quot; and not &quot;tattling.&quot; The correct response is to thank the <br/>
child for reporting and either do something about it - stop Marc from <br/>
throwing sand at the babies - or reassure the reporter that things are <br/>
fine - &quot;Thank you so much for telling me that you&#39;re worried about <br/>
Anika and I&#39;ll keep a close eye on her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - what would actual &quot;tattling&quot; look like? The idea was that if the <br/>
kid is &quot;just&quot; trying to get another kid into trouble, that would be <br/>
tattling. And, in fact, that happens and my response as a parent IS <br/>
different than to &quot;real&quot; reporting. But my response is not to ignore it <br/>
or punish it or otherwise just try to make it stop. My response was to <br/>
respond to what seemed to me to be the real problem or to talk to the <br/>
&quot;tattler&quot; about what was going on and see if I could help or to just go <br/>
be more present and see if things cooled down a little. For example, if <br/>
Rosie came in the house angrily saying, &quot;Roxana is stomping on the <br/>
flowers in the garden,&quot; I&#39;d go see what was happening - if it turned <br/>
out Rox had accidentally stepped on a flower - and Rosie knew it was <br/>
not going to happen again, it was just an accident, nobody or no thing <br/>
was in any danger, and her report was for no reason OTHER than to get <br/>
Roxana into trouble - then that could be called &quot;tattling.&quot; So - I <br/>
STILL wouldn&#39;t chew out Rosie for bothering me with tattling - because <br/>
really it would indicate there was some other problem going on between <br/>
them that she was frustrated with and couldn&#39;t figure out how to <br/>
resolve on her own and that was what would have brought her to me. I <br/>
might just stay out there to be nearby and able to see and hear what <br/>
happens when they start to play together again. I might ask, straight <br/>
out, &quot;How are things going out here - you having problems of some <br/>
kind?&quot; If the so-called &quot;tattler&quot; is upset - I might take her aside and <br/>
say, &quot;So, what&#39;s going on - you seem upset?&quot; Etc.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is that reporting and tattling ARE different - <br/>
one comes from true concern about a situation and the other comes from <br/>
frustration or anger at another person - but either one represents a <br/>
child coming to an adult for help and both should be encouraged, not <br/>
discouraged.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t like it either.  <br/>
<br/>
If I had a party guest who was becoming a problem and I went to my<br/>
husband and said &quot;He&#39;s belligerent and insulting the others.&quot;  I&#39;d be<br/>
pretty damn disgusted if my husband said &quot;Stop tattling!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If my husband came home from work with a complaint about a coworker and I<br/>
ignored him and crawled under the table, how would that help him?  How<br/>
would that convey my love and concern for him?   It would be insulting<br/>
and insensitive and crazy.<br/>
<br/>
People we love deserve to have someone to go to if they run into a<br/>
problem they need help with.  I can guess what would happen to and be<br/>
said about a child who ignored his mother and crawled under the table if<br/>
the mom had asked for help or expressed a concern.   <br/>
<br/>
Children are people we should be spending a lot of time talking to,<br/>
listening to and helping because they&#39;re new here.  Instead it&#39;s standard<br/>
operating procedure to be short with them, shush them and limit them.  <br/>
We make them small.   <br/>

thinks the adult should have.<br/>
<br/>
=====<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always tried to focus on the person &quot;reporting&quot; and the way <br/>
they&#39;re feeling. So, instead of so-and-so&#39;s-doing-x, I&#39;ll try to <br/>
redirect the conversation from the person doing x to the reporter: &quot;And <br/>
that makes you feel sad/ scared/ angry/ whatever?&quot; I&#39;m not sure where I <br/>
got this idea from, but it always seemed important to me to tell about <br/>
oneself rather than someone else and to work at identifying the feeling <br/>
inside. I think this is how I always differentiated the reporting from <br/>
the tattling in my mind. So, a scenario in our home might be Emily or <br/>
Julia coming to tell me that Sam is swinging a rope around downstairs. I <br/>
would reflect back to them something like, &quot;When Sam swings the rope <br/>
like that you&#39;re afraid you might get hurt or something might get <br/>
broken? Do you need some help in handling it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That second question, &quot;Do you need some help in handling it?&quot; is an <br/>
important part for us, too. Sometimes we will talk about how they can <br/>
handle a problem by themselves, and run different scenarios or things to <br/>
say, sometimes they want me to come help. I do differentiate somewhat <br/>
between the more interpersonal situations that they might handle by <br/>
themselves and more immediate situations, drawing upon groundwork that <br/>
we&#39;ve already done. I&#39;ll ask if they&#39;ve tried to negotiate and what <br/>
they&#39;ve tried and offer suggestions before I jump in as arbiter. Truth <br/>
is, however, I&#39;m often in the same room with them, so things don&#39;t <br/>
usually escalate too far without my intervention. Handling it alone most <br/>
often happens with Emily (7) and Julia (almost 6) who share a room, so <br/>
often play by themselves and are emotionally adept at problem solving in <br/>
ways that my youngest guy isn&#39;t yet.<br/>
<br/>
I think a parent who is quick to help negotiate and model important <br/>
communication skills when the children are young lays the groundwork for <br/>
the kids to be able to handle situations themselves in the future. By <br/>
being available and willing to help negotiate, identify the problem and <br/>
name the feelings, we give our kids the tools to handle conflict in an <br/>
emotionally intelligent way. Telling them to handle conflict without <br/>
offering the tools that will help is very much like throwing them in the <br/>
water and telling them to swim as we walk away.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in my head I&#39;m thinkig of reporting physical actions and immediate <br/>
dangers, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my kids&#39; jobs to negotiate physical situations <br/>
with the other kids.  If Marty&#39;s up on the roof for no good reason I know of, <br/>
that&#39;s neither Kirby&#39;s responsibility nor Holly&#39;s.  I still remember my mom <br/>
putting me in charge of my little sister when my mom was even right in the house. <br/>
 It&#39;s not good and it&#39;s not fair, and my sister was hurt BADLY once when my <br/>
mom wasn&#39;t out there and I was.  It wasn&#39;t my fault, my mom said, but I knew my <br/>
mom wouldn&#39;t have let it happen had she been standing there.  So it was my <br/>
mom&#39;s fault but happened &quot;on my watch,&quot; and that wasn&#39;t cool for her to do to me.<br/>
<br/>
We had been playing with a big tub of water outside, and my sister was two, <br/>
so I was  five.   She stood on the seat of a little stroller, backwards and was <br/>
holding on to the handle, fell forward with her mouth open and cut the inside <br/>
roof of her mouth on a rock.  She got up on her own and ran to the door of <br/>
the house which was only about six feet away, and there was blood running to her <br/>
feet by the time my mom came to the door, just seconds later (because she was <br/>
screaming horribly).   She was in the hospital a couple of days with stitches <br/>
in the roof of her mouth and everybody freaking out, while I was left to stay <br/>
with a childless aunt and uncle who had not one toy or book.  A porch swing <br/>
on an upstairs balcony (one of those quad apartments where the entry way has an <br/>
apartment on either side, stairs up the middle and two apartments upstairs, <br/>
that are or used to be common in Fort Worth where we were, and other such <br/>
places).<br/>
<br/>
But what would my mom have expected me to do?   I was too little to <br/>
physically take my sister down, even if I had known enough to see the danger of the <br/>
likelihood of that stroller falling over.  Had I walked away to the house I would <br/>
probably be in trouble for leaving my sister too close to water.    <br/>
<br/>
Partly because of situations like that, I never wanted to leave my children <br/>
feeling responsible for siblings, ever.  They&#39;re not the parents.  They don&#39;t <br/>
have to learn to handle those situations.  When I was helpful enough to all of <br/>
them, they came to want to help voluntarily, and to react with the same kind <br/>
of concern they were receiving when they were unhappy or frustrated.<br/>

=====<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think it does matter how the child is feeling, especially young <br/>
children. Helping them identify their feelings, sort them out, put names <br/>
to them, especially in reactionary situations, is really valuable for <br/>
lots of reasons: communication, self-awareness, conflict resolution. All <br/>
of this can be said while walking to the next room, holding hands or <br/>
carrying the child if s/he&#39;s really upset. Talking about what&#39;s going on <br/>
also helps to keep things in a rational perspective for both of us, <br/>
helping me stay calm as well, and get some more details. I can&#39;t think <br/>
of too many scenarios where I&#39;ve had to be at a full run--in fact, I <br/>
can&#39;t think of any.<br/>

<br/>
======<br/>
<br/>
Which, is why I pointed out that I *differentiate* between the more <br/>
interpersonal versus immediate needs. I have three young children (7, <br/>
almost 6 and 4), so much of the stuff I&#39;m dealing with on a regular <br/>
basis is more about interpersonal and less about someone climbing on a <br/>
roof. I don&#39;t put my kids in charge of each other--ever. What I&#39;m <br/>
talking about is along the lines of &quot;Julia has the Polly Pockets with <br/>
the ponytails and I really want her&quot; or &quot;Em and Julia are in their room <br/>
and don&#39;t want me in there&quot; or &quot;Sam&#39;s taking my legos.&quot; Helping kids <br/>
learn the skills for negotiating the countless interpersonal scenarios <br/>
that come up each day is what I&#39;m talking about, not children out on <br/>
roofs or drowning in tubs of water. With my kids being so close in age, <br/>
there is no way I would put anyone &quot;in charge,&quot; but there&#39;s lots of <br/>
interpersonal negotiation going on *all* day long.<br/>
<br/>
I think, perhaps, too, there&#39;s a significant difference between the ages <br/>
of the children we&#39;re talking about. When my 4 yo or 6 yo come to me, <br/>
it&#39;s different than an 8 or a 10 or a 12 yo who already has a pretty <br/>
good grasp of how she&#39;s feeling. Asking the question &quot;And you need my <br/>
help?&quot; is more about reflective listening and validating the child&#39;s <br/>
feelings than about a cynical, eye-brow-raised, &quot;And you really need my <br/>
help?&quot;  With younger children, at least in my home, there&#39;s a lot more <br/>
immediate parental presence anyway that makes it possible to intervene <br/>
before things come to blows or dire circumstances. The farthest away I <br/>
usually am is making dinner.<br/>

You raise some really great points. WHat we have done so far is to <br/>
come up with a definition of tattling and telling. At our house, <br/>
tattling is when you are trying to get someone INTO trouble, and <br/>
telling is when you are trying to stop trouble. IF you aren&#39;t sure, <br/>
come tell, because it&#39;s better to tell when you shouldn&#39;t than to <br/>
not tell when you should.<br/>
