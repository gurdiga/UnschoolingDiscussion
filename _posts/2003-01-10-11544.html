<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173762314">I was in the car heading to The National Plastics Museum with Julian, who is <br/>
13, the other day. (I bet you didn&#39;t know there WAS one! Neither did I.) We <br/>
were talking about his friend Nick, who is his best friend and the son of my <br/>
best friend, who had just spent a week with us. This was made possible <br/>
because Nick this year started attending a new Sudbury Valley School in CT, <br/>
where he lives. Nick has just been glowing talking about school, for the <br/>
first time ever. <br/>
<br/>
I asked Julian if he ever wished that he could go to a school like that. He <br/>
said that if he had to go to school he would want it to be a Sudbury Valley <br/>
school, but that mostly he&#39;d actually rather be with me.<br/>
<br/>
I told him it was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to me. <br/>

I have met Nick and he is a really neat kid.  I know he was on the founder&#39;s<br/>
committee for that Sudbury school and was very excited for it to open.  My<br/>
dd is currently attending the other  Sudbury School in CT (her choice; she&#39;s<br/>
my social butterfly!), the only type of school we&#39;d ever send her to.<br/>
