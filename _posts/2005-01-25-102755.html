<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558545543">Apologies to new members or those with little kids, and anyone should feel <br/>
free to skip this by.  Kirby is  18 and taking a few classes at the community <br/>
college.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby loves his math class.  When they&#39;ve had in-class things they&#39;ve scored, <br/>
he&#39;s gotten 8 out of ten and 7 out of ten.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He likes the college success class.  Today they made 3x5 cards of their <br/>
priority projects.  Here&#39;s what his says: <br/>
1  Work on my essey     (he misspelled it)<br/>
Get a place to do it<br/>
Get moms help<br/>
follow the step by step walkthrough<br/>
Do it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t seen that before he came in today and asked me to help him with his <br/>
English homework.<br/>
It&#39;s due Wednesday.  <br/>
I asked if we could do it in the library,our upstairs room, which has a clean <br/>
table this week.  (I didn&#39;t know he had a list that said &#39;get a place.&#39;)<br/>
<br/>
When I saw his pages and PAGES of instructions and policies and samples, I <br/>
was not a bit hopeful.  I thought there was no way it would be finished in time. <br/>
 I have singing practice tomorrow night.  He has math tomorrow, and karate <br/>
for hours.  <br/>
<br/>
The assignment was daunting and the details were making me cranky and I was <br/>
trying to be calm and hopeful and peaceful.  <br/>
<br/>
He needed a &quot;sentence outline.&quot;  The sample we finally found in the depths of <br/>
his stuff was unclear, but we did one.  I could&#39;ve guessed wrong.   I thought <br/>
that would be a stopping place, but Kirby was upstairs writing while I was <br/>
downstairs printing the outline.  My computer&#39;s the only one with a printer.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s finished!  Finished a day and a half early.<br/>
<br/>
I never finished anything a day and a half early when I was in college.<br/>
<br/>
Two things bother me:  This is the kind of English class to make people <br/>
despise English classes.  I&#39;m sad about that.   It&#39;s over-blown pomposity and <br/>
obfuscation.<br/>
<br/>
Second thing: <br/>
&quot;A paragraph must consist of at least 100 words.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is not qualified, no &quot;for the purposes of this class,&quot; or anything.  <br/>
There it is, just as though it&#39;s fact, law, definition.<br/>
<br/>
And furthermore, it&#39;s in a paragraph that&#39;s maybe 45 words long.  But here it <br/>
is with its explanation:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A paragraph must consist of at least 100 words.  Short paragraphs result in <br/>
inadequate development of your thesis.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told Kirby just not to count.  I told him if it&#39;s interesting enough, the <br/>
teacher won&#39;t count.  <br/>
Now I hope I&#39;m right.  <br/>
<br/>
I have the urge to liberate him, &lt;g&gt; but he&#39;s still having fun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read LOTS and lots of long paragraphs which were the result of lack of <br/>
friggin&#39; CLUE about thesis or development, but reeked of the hyperawareness of <br/>
word count.<br/>
<br/>
His handwritten language is very tacky looking and hard to read, and he types <br/>
fast and well.  He&#39;s still iffy on the commas and apostrophes and quotation <br/>
marks.  He usedtoo many quotation marks on his hand-written first draft, and he <br/>
didn&#39;t use paragraphs, but there were some good phrases and most of them <br/>
ended up in the final, though it had a different slant.   <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the assignment:<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
&quot;New Directions,&quot; by Maya Angelou, is a narrative essay about Mrs. Annie <br/>
Johnson, an African-American woman who lived int he American South one hundred <br/>
years ago.  Identify at least three personal attributes that the author obviously <br/>
admires in this woman.  Explain why she admires these traits.  Use examples <br/>
from the text to support your statements.<br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
Huh.  <br/>
Just noticed Kirby answered another question.<br/>
He wrote about three personal attributes HE admired.<br/>
<br/>
How could he explain why Maya Angelou admires the traits?  He would be <br/>
guessing, not explaining.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s marked down for that, I&#39;m liberating him.  Might need some ninja-moms <br/>
to help me...<br/>
(No, probably I&#39;ll just let him do what he wants to do, as usual.)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s finished,and it didn&#39;t take all the hours I thought it <br/>
would, and that he rejected some of my ideas.  (Good for him all the way <br/>
around.)<br/>
<br/>
Maya Angelou wouldn&#39;t get a good grade on her essay if she had written it for <br/>
this class, if the teacher is going to be as much a stickler for her <br/>
particular rules as she claims to be.  And Kirby says the teacher keeps mentioning <br/>
Stephen King.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;s had some paragraphs shorter than 100 words, and kept <br/>
a lot of his thesis to himself so the reader can do some of the thinking.  <br/>
(Yeah, yeah... novels and not essays.  Still, being a person who has habitually <br/>
written essays designed to get people to think, I don&#39;t think writing until <br/>
there&#39;s nothing left to discover makes the best essay.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry for even writing this.  I&#39;m torn between reporting this <br/>
stuff and just not saying any schoolish thing ever, EVER, on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Yuck, and I&#39;m sorry.<br/>

<br/>
I believe Mr. King doesn&#39;t like adverbs.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote a book &quot;On Writing&quot; that is more a memoir than a how-to-write <br/>
book, but it is quite entertaining.  (I got it on tape from the library.)<br/>
<br/>
He mentions a childhood babysitter named either Eulah or Beulah who used <br/>
to knock him down and sit on him and fart stupefyingly in his face.  He <br/>
said this was great preparation for enduring literary criticism later in <br/>
life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267608765">Sandra, I appreciate the comments about Kirby&#39;s college experience. Kate is<br/>
also taking classes, not her first, but her first at the college she&#39;s<br/>
planning on getting her degree from. It&#39;s been an interesting transition.<br/>
And mostly positive.  Like Kirby, she&#39;s never had academic deadlines, never<br/>
had to get up for school (oh, the comments I&#39;ve heard-&quot;how will she know how<br/>
to get up when she has to work?&quot;). She followed her interests and lived<br/>
life. Now she is taking three classes, works two jobs, volunteers.  She has<br/>
yet to be late for class, is far more contientious than I ever was about<br/>
doing homework and is complaining about a teacher because she figured out in<br/>
the first week that in the psych class you don&#39;t have to do any reading if<br/>
you go to class and listen. Homework is answering questions by lifting the<br/>
correct paragraph from the book. No thinking required. Kate says it&#39;s a<br/>
waste....but she needs the class.  And I think these discussions are<br/>
applicable to unschooling because so many parents have fears of what will<br/>
happen when the kids get older.  I know I did. I heard all kinds of horror<br/>
stories about what could happen if my children didn&#39;t learn at a young age<br/>
how to get up with an alarm, how to structure their day, if they didn&#39;t have<br/>
deadlines and rules to get used to....none of the dire predictions have come<br/>
true. For any of my kids.  I&#39;m not trying to imply that college is the only<br/>
path either...it&#39;s  the path Kate chose. But she chose it deliberately, not<br/>
because that&#39;s &#39;what you&#39;re supposed to do at 18&#39;.  And not all of my kids<br/>
may choose college...but I believe they&#39;ll each find their own way as they<br/>
get older and will be successful at whatever they do.<br/>

If Kirby had been in school, he&#39;d know that this was one of the abitraries  <br/>
of school, and if that instruction had not been in there, he would have known <br/>
to  ask, &quot;How long should our paragraphs be?&quot;  :)  He&#39;d just take it in  strid<br/>

 <br/>
It&#39;s better that he doesn&#39;t take those things in stride, of course.<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm.....  He&#39;s smart already. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little afraid this irritating English class will cause him to decide <br/>
college is stupid.  If he comes to that conclusion, I&#39;d like for it to be on the <br/>
basis of several assorted classes, not just one. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, anyone who would slavishly do every single thing this teacher <br/>
claims to want would be learning to follow arbitrary rules without having a stroke, <br/>
not learning to write.<br/>

Yeah, I guess.<br/>
It just sits in stark contrast to our many years of lack of bullshit.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t told him things ARE or MUST BE.  We&#39;ve always really talked about things <br/>
truthfully and now he runs up against truth that exists because someone has a <br/>
PhD or Master&#39;s degree and an academic position.   I knew of those pockets of <br/>
Truth Lite and Truth Temporary, but I hadn&#39;t thought he&#39;d need to know so soon <br/>
(or maybe, I fantasized, *ever*).<br/>

Well thanks, and while I kind of see the point I think my concern is that <br/>
it&#39;s not only about school and schoolishness, but I&#39;m afraid someone will pass <br/>
through quickly and think that I thought college was really an important <br/>
end-goal.   I don&#39;t anymore, though when we first started I just kind of assumed the <br/>
kids would all go to college.  <br/>
<br/>
My view of the world hs changed because of unschooling.<br/>

a piece of writing by a New Zealand author: not only did most of the <br/>
kids get the answers &#39;wrong&#39;, but the author came out and said he would <br/>
have got the answers wrong also.  The interpretation given by the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This seems like a good time to bring up something that I have been <br/>
thinking about a lot lately.  When I don&#39;t have small children to raise <br/>
and a house to build, I sometimes work part time as a biology instructor <br/>
at TVI (the same place where Kirby is going).  I teach courses for <br/>
biology majors and for non-majors, and by far my favorite is Biology 100 <br/>
for non-majors.  In this course I am able to offer a semester long <br/>
project where the students can choose to either write a paper or <br/>
volunteer at a local agency that is involved in biology in some way.  <br/>
TVI sponsors this program, which is known as &quot;experiential learning&quot; <br/>
(which totally cracks me up now that I have a better understanding of <br/>
unschooling).  Anyway, since I have learned more about unschooling I <br/>
have been thinking of ways to apply some of the principles of <br/>
unschooling to a college course, especially an introductory one like <br/>
this (the one for majors is pretty inflexible in terms of assessment).  <br/>
I&#39;d like the students to know that I trust that they will learn as much <br/>
or as little as they desire.  Some of them are in the course because <br/>
they want to be, while others are there to fulfill a requirement.  I <br/>
have some broad thoughts about how I might approach this, which I&#39;ll run <br/>
by y&#39;all later, but right now I&#39;m wondering if anyone else out there <br/>
teaches in a traditional setting with required syllabi, testing, and so <br/>
on.  I guess that&#39;s where I&#39;d like to start--by asking if any of you <br/>
have BTDT?<br/>

   Kirby actually managed to turn this assignment in to something <br/>
WORTHWHILE! What a wonderfully gifted young man! To gain insight into <br/>
a character and thus gain understanding and insight into ourselves is <br/>
so much more powerful then attempting to explain what the author <br/>
thinks. That is, like you said, just a guess at best anyway.  If <br/>
education were geared to open the doorways into our own thoughts, <br/>
beliefs, and desires then and only then could it actually serve a <br/>
necesasary function.  But alas no, education serves only to tell us <br/>
what to think not how to think, furthering the notion that are own <br/>
thoughts are just not good enough. <br/>
  I do hope as you do that his teacher is not all rules and form. In <br/>
short, I hope she sees the genuis in Kirby but I fear that may not be <br/>
the case. Luckily for Kirby he has a mother who stands behind him to <br/>
let him know that his thoughts do have value, think of all the kids <br/>
in all forms of school who have parents that stand along side the <br/>
teacher. These childern are really left believing that their thoughts <br/>
are wrong and therefore worthless.  <br/>

We&#39;ll know more after this paper&#39;s graded, I guess.   <br/>
<br/>
His five paragraphs were 408 words (Macs like to do word count &lt;g&gt;).  The <br/>
checklist (a full page long) reiterated the 100 words per paragraph thing, and I <br/>
asked him last night before we printed the final copy whether he wanted to pad <br/>
it out.  He said no, because sh had also said to use as few words as <br/>
necessary to say what you want to say.   He seemed not a bit anxious or worried, and <br/>
happy with it as it was.<br/>

<br/>
She has the right to make her arbitrary rules, and he has the right to follow <br/>
or ignore or whatever.  He can drop the class or change to an ungraded option <br/>
if he wants.  I don&#39;t think he cares enough to spend the time to go up there <br/>
and talk to her.  He might later, but right now, he&#39;s had to make room in his <br/>
busy social life for these classes already. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith the dad is having a GREAT time living vicariously through Kirby.  Keith <br/>
had some friends at that age, but Kirby has LOTS.  Keith was ridiculed at <br/>
home and at school for being fat and he had a lot of closed-down posture and <br/>
attitude and some over-the-top bravado when he was a teen.  Kirby has none of <br/>
that, and Keith LOVES seeing him be whole and tall and confident.  (Not literally <br/>
as tall as Keith was, but spiritually and emotionally tall and upright.)<br/>

If he were headed straight toward a degree for a purpose, that would make <br/>

dynamic is not such at this point that he has the urge to negotiate for a grade <br/>
or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t need her positive regard to feel whole.    It&#39;s so weird to see <br/>

traditionally (except I use a variety of activities from a book called: <br/>
&quot;Teaching Economics as if People Mattered&quot;) but I work with each <br/>
individual student to come up with a semester project of their own and <br/>
I encourage them to be creative in designing their project AND I let <br/>
them combine it with something they might be doing for another course, <br/>
if the other professor also agrees. A great example was a student who <br/>
was taking a photography course - she took pictures to show the <br/>
disparity between high-income housing and low-income housing in Los <br/>
Angeles.  The pictures were captioned with current information about <br/>
income distribution. Her photography teacher liked them so much that <br/>
she was chosen as one of the few students to have her own show in the <br/>
photo department&#39;s gallery that semester.  It was a FAR more valuable <br/>
activity than having her write a research paper.<br/>
<br/>
I also offer them a choice of reading a couple of science fiction books <br/>
as their semester project, such as Frederick Pohl&#39;s &quot;Midas World&quot; or <br/>
George Orwell&#39;s, &quot;1984.&quot; I make suggestions - they can choose. I was <br/>
THRILLED today after class - a former student came up and told me he <br/>
had never read for pleasure at all - only reads for school (he is <br/>
planning to be a pharmacist). But he read decided to choose to read a <br/>
couple of science fiction books off my list, for my class, and it got <br/>
him hooked and now he reads all the time. He said he&#39;d thought science <br/>
fiction wasn&#39;t very good literature, before, but found out that it is <br/>
really thought-provoking and entertaining.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293440763">Couple quick thoughts to help out Kirby (and you). :)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Second thing: <br/>
&gt; &quot;A paragraph must consist of at least 100 words.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These &quot;rules&quot; in school are for kids who are used to doing the minimum of work. Most kids <br/>
want to know &quot;what&#39;s required&quot; so they can do that and no more. By stating what a <br/>
paragraph &quot;is&quot; in no unequivocal terms, the student cannot just say to the teacher he <br/>
didn&#39;t know how long the teacher was expecting... and so it goes.<br/>
<br/>
If Kirby writes *well* and is in depth in his support (if his syntax is strong and clear and <br/>
natural) those &quot;rules&quot; won&#39;t even be noticed by the teacher, nine times out of ten.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I told Kirby just not to count.  I told him if it&#39;s interesting enough, the <br/>
&gt; teacher won&#39;t count.  <br/>
&gt; Now I hope I&#39;m right.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re right.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I have the urge to liberate him, &lt;g&gt; but he&#39;s still having fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve read LOTS and lots of long paragraphs which were the result of lack of <br/>
&gt; friggin&#39; CLUE about thesis or development, but reeked of the hyperawareness of <br/>
&gt; word count.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hope I&#39;m not out of line here. I would suggest not worrying too much about all the details <br/>
or the professor. Instead, use the professor to get what he needs to become an effective <br/>
writer. My husband teaches freshman comp (has for fifteen years). I teach composition too <br/>
and substitute at the college level.<br/>
<br/>
What impresses teachers the most (imho) is a student who is eager to learn, who takes <br/>
input seriously and who is wanting to improve the piece because it can be improved, not <br/>
because he needs a better grade.<br/>
<br/>
Most comp professors love to teach and wish more students loved to learn.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; His handwritten language is very tacky looking and hard to read, and he types <br/>
&gt; fast and well.  He&#39;s still iffy on the commas and apostrophes and quotation <br/>
&gt; marks.  He usedtoo many quotation marks on his hand-written first draft, and he <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t use paragraphs, but there were some good phrases and most of them <br/>
&gt; ended up in the final, though it had a different slant.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For first drafts, that will work. But it is a deterrent to reading quality writing (prose) if it&#39;s a <br/>
mess mechanically. Just a fact of human nature. I would work as his editor (as his mom) <br/>
and help him to make corrections before turning in the final draft.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just noticed Kirby answered another question.<br/>
&gt; He wrote about three personal attributes HE admired.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How could he explain why Maya Angelou admires the traits?  He would be <br/>
&gt; guessing, not explaining.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The prompt is asking you to surmise Angelou&#39;s opinion through the writing. It&#39;s a fair <br/>
question I think.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If he&#39;s marked down for that, I&#39;m liberating him.  Might need some ninja-moms <br/>

&gt; (No, probably I&#39;ll just let him do what he wants to do, as usual.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey it&#39;s a first essay. This is just the one the prof uses to get a feel for what level the class <br/>
is.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s finished,and it didn&#39;t take all the hours I thought it <br/>
&gt; would, and that he rejected some of my ideas.  (Good for him all the way <br/>
&gt; around.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maya Angelou wouldn&#39;t get a good grade on her essay if she had written it for <br/>
&gt; this class, if the teacher is going to be as much a stickler for her <br/>
&gt; particular rules as she claims to be.  And Kirby says the teacher keeps mentioning <br/>
&gt; Stephen King.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;s had some paragraphs shorter than 100 words, and kept <br/>
&gt; a lot of his thesis to himself so the reader can do some of the thinking.  <br/>
&gt; (Yeah, yeah... novels and not essays.  Still, being a person who has habitually <br/>
&gt; written essays designed to get people to think, I don&#39;t think writing until <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s nothing left to discover makes the best essay.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lol. Sandra, relax! &lt;bg&gt; Remember, most kids don&#39;t want to write more than the <br/>
minimum. That&#39;s all that rule meant, I&#39;m sure of it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m really sorry for even writing this.  I&#39;m torn between reporting this <br/>
&gt; stuff and just not saying any schoolish thing ever, EVER, on this list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lol. We all like to hear real life examples. The transition to someone else&#39;s agenda is so <br/>
shocking, don&#39;t you think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686290963">The most important things I learned through college writing (English classes and writing assignments in other classes) are:<br/>
<br/>
The importance of repeat drafts.  The first draft is to get your ideas out.  Then you modify your ideas.  Then you go over with a fine tooth comb for spelling, punctuation, and grammar.  Then you have someone else check it and you fix any errors they found.<br/>
<br/>
The value of peer editing and editors.  Professional writers always have someone else go over their stuff, both for content and accuracy.  My favorite writing prof had us edit each other in the class and also hand in 3 drafts of each assignment before the final paper.  English and writing weren&#39;t my major, but I took extra classes from her because I enjoyed the first one I took from her so much.<br/>
<br/>
Format does matter.  If a student bothers to take care with spelling, punctuation, and grammar, it is easier for the prof to focus on whether the assignment accomplished what it was supposed to.  However, as someone else said, if the student covers the assignment well and bothers to edit, the prof will be likely to overlook minor details such as exact word count.<br/>
<br/>
As for total length, OSU required lots of majors to take a particular technical writing course.  Most of the teachers assigned 20 page papers for the final project.  The teacher I had assigned a 5 page final.  He said nobody in the business world has time to read lengthy reports.  He stressed brevity and clarity.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, this is an interesting question.  What is it that students do want<br/>
out of a class?  It doesn&#39;t take too many years as a child of being<br/>
rewarded for pursuing the extrinsic goal of good grades and being<br/>
punished for pursuing the intrinsic goals of personal interest and<br/>
pleasure in learning (at the expense of grades) before you get a student<br/>
population skewed pretty heavily in the grade oriented direction.  If<br/>
your students are primarily motivated by getting good grades, then they<br/>
do in fact have to play you; you are in charge of grading them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m intrigued by your desires to bring an unschooling sensibility to<br/>
conventional classes, but somewhat skeptical about the possibility. <br/>
What changes are you willing to make to demonstrate that your students<br/>
don&#39;t have to &quot;play&quot; you for grades?  How much of the system to you feel<br/>
is worthwhile?  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, I took a scientific computing course in college from an<br/>
emeritus professor who&#39;s whole life was his research.  He maintained<br/>
formal ties to the college in order to get access to computing<br/>
facilities and suchlike, and the college pretty much left him alone to<br/>
do his thing because he published great stuff.  Every now and again he<br/>
would teach this course, and it would basically be a series of lectures<br/>
about the current state of the art in research in a bunch of areas of<br/>
scientific computing, and students would pick research problems and try<br/>
to make progress on them.  He always told the class at the beginning<br/>
that he was going to give everyone an A, and he always followed<br/>
through.  He just wanted to explore interesting problems, and get the<br/>
class to do so as well.  He was disturbingly smart, and it was one of<br/>
the most challenging courses I ever took.<br/>
<br/>
Would you ever pursue this method of letting students pursue their own<br/>
interests?  If not, why not?  It was very disturbing to many students;<br/>
once you&#39;ve been convinced to care about the grade, then arbitrariness<br/>
in their awarding is very painful, and profoundly unfair feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Children as if They Mattered&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
Great idea.  We have a culture that disrespects the abilities of <br/>
children and a school system that sometimes uses dishonesty to get kids <br/>
to perform.  These things become so ingrained and seem so &quot;normal&quot; that <br/>
it can be difficult to assess them clearly.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to connect this back to the lengthy discussion a monthh ago <br/>
about the (hypothetical) mom looking through a microscope and possibly <br/>
remarking &quot;Gee, this is interesting.  Come take a look.&quot;  (My phrasing <br/>
added).  I believe it should go without saying that one doesn&#39;t say <br/>
&quot;Gee, this is interesting&quot; to one&#39;s kids unless the item IS interesting <br/>
and the parent is speaking truthfully.  This seems like a pretty simple <br/>
standard of honesty.  But there can be so much dishonesty and faking of <br/>
interest by teachers in school, that one may start to suspect dishonesty <br/>
will follow whenever a schoolish agenda is present.<br/>

Yes, and I feel the sinking feeling of having protected him from arbitrary <br/>
school craziness all these years and now he wants me to help him with it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the problem.  If he were off far away someone else could help <br/>
him who wouldn&#39;t be personally traumatized. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the good thing about me helping him is I can say &quot;100 words is HER rule, <br/>
for this class, not the definition of a paragraph the world over.&quot;  I&#39;d like <br/>
to do that without the full-on eye-rolling and clucking that might make him <br/>
think I think the whole thing is stupid.  Because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s stupid, I <br/>
just wish she hadn&#39;t built it up hugely and then laid it out to calcify.  It&#39;s <br/>
such a concrete block sculpture where it could have been a butterfly.    <br/>
Language is alive, but not the way it&#39;s being taught in that class.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby doesn&#39;t know anyone else in that class.  He said in his other two <br/>
classes they work in groups and talk and joke, but in the English class nobody <br/>
chats–-they don&#39;t even look at each other.<br/>
