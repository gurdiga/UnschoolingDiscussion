 </span></blockquote>Wow, raising blackberries. That seems so strange coming from where we live.<br/>
The entire field behind our house is full of them, as is every roadside,<br/>
abandoned garden shed, or anyplace that someone hasn&#39;t actively planted<br/>
something else or mowed them down. They may be nuisances (I have to cut them<br/>
out of my garden a thousand times a year) but ummmmm.... are they great!<br/>
As for the finest blackberries on earth, they grow in Jacksonville, OR.<br/>
which must have the perfect climate for them. Bigger than a big thumb and<br/>
juicy and sweet. Yumm! That&#39;s where I grew up, and I can&#39;t eat a blackberry<br/>
without thinking of home...<br/>
