&lt;&lt; I suppose I should change my thinking and actually use this health <br/>
 insurance!!! No point paying out each month when we never go! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well....we haven&#39;t done physicals in YEARS. So some of my children have never <br/>
had them. Two to be exact. The other two not since they were very, very <br/>
little.<br/>
But we have appointments because we have insurance and I want to USE IT!! haha<br/>
Mainly I think it&#39;s a good idea to have the eyes checked, which they do at a <br/>
regular doctor appointment and then refer you if anything is iffy.<br/>
And they feel the abdominal region for anything abnormal and stuff like that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I keep tryin&#39; real hard to get my kids exposed, whenever one of these <br/>
diseases makes the rounds. Unfortunately, they&#39;re just too hang <br/>
healthy. They have yet to get any of the things I&#39;ve tried to get <br/>
them natural immunity to, including chicken pox!<br/>
As for whether or not to worry about it when they get older and <br/>
haven&#39;t gotten these things, I&#39;ll cross that bridge when I come to <br/>
it. I think there&#39;s a huge difference in choosing vaccines <br/>
selectively in bigger/older children, and sticking newborn babes full <br/>
of 10 different vaccines in huge doses.<br/>
Plus, DH and I love to travel and thus have been innoculated against <br/>
just about everything as we&#39;ve been to several continents. Eventually <br/>
if the kids want to travel, that will probably be a necessity. Many <br/>
countries require certain immunizations for entrance. It will be <br/>
something to think about at that point. Right now, I&#39;m not worried, <br/>
especially considering their natural resilience right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503479657">None of my kids have had the chicken pox vaccine - Brett had the pox before the vaccine was widely used, so he had no need for the vaccine. Tyler hasn&#39;t had the vaccine, and I&#39;ve put him in contact with 3 kids who had it, but he hasn&#39;t gotten it yet. I&#39;m still hoping he&#39;ll get it! If he doesn&#39;t by the time he&#39;s a teenager, I&#39;ll probably tell him about the risks and let him decide if he wants to get the vaccine then. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most kids get chickenpox in the UK cos so far the vaccination <br/>
hasn&#39;t been introduced (I bet it will soon) so my 3 have had it and <br/>
so had everyone we knew.<br/>
I don&#39;t vaccinate and I certainly wouldn&#39;t have gone for one like that. <br/>
The illness is generally mild and there are indications that the <br/>
vaccination can wear off by adulthood, making young adults <br/>
vunerable. (That isn&#39;t even with going into all the poisons inside <br/>
these things and the damage to the immune system....)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not worried about any of the others although when my daughter <br/>
reaches 15 she can havea blood test to check her immunity to <br/>
Rubella. I think she&#39;s had it but its another very mild disease in that <br/>
there is a slight or no temp rise and a very mild rash. My doctor <br/>
didn&#39;t know if the various viral rashes she had as a toddler were <br/>
Rubella cos they all look the same.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are all pretty healthy. They rarely ever get colds (having <br/>
said that, they have their first cold in 3 years right now but I blame <br/>
polluted Virginia for that maybe a bit unfairly but the air was so <br/>
dirty last week you could see it)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Do you worry about them getting <br/>

<br/>
I had it when I was 19.  Not a very severe case.<br/>
<br/>
All my kids  had it.  We were in a babysitting co-op and almost all the kids <br/>
got it.  The moms were happy enough with it.  My poor friend Carol, though <br/>
(who wrote the late reading article that&#39;s at unschooling.com) had four kids, <br/>
and they got it separately.  A week sick, a week incubation, then ONE more <br/>
kid got it, a week sick, a week incubation...<br/>
<br/>
One or two families weren&#39;t wanting in on this, but those whose moms wanted <br/>
to get it over with were also willing to babysit the sick kids from the other <br/>
families even after the kids had it.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was still really little when she had it.  Not walking, I think.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom tried to expose me when i was a kid and for some reason i didn&#39;t get <br/>
it then.  All three of the other kids at our house had it the same time, when <br/>
I was about ten, but even though she said &quot;Sleep together, play together, <br/>
drink out of the same cup!!&quot; I waited until I was a junior in college to <br/>
catch it from a four year old.<br/>

So you think vaccines in general aren&#39;t really harmful if given when one is <br/>

<br/>
I knew of one lady from Australia that moved here with her kids and hadn&#39;t <br/>
had any of them vaccinated and had no problem moving here. I thought it <br/>
wasn&#39;t mandated that to travel you needed vaccines unless going to a part of <br/>
a country that may have very poor sanitary conditions. Can&#39;t military people <br/>
get out of being vaccinated?<br/>

My first daugher is totally vaccinated with everything. Well except chicken <br/>
pox but that came out after she already had them. My next 2 kids are <br/>
vaccinated half way and my last nothing at all. I just worry that maybe the <br/>
chicken pox caught in adulthood could be bad. That&#39;s really the only one I <br/>
worry about.<br/>
<br/>
My mom swears I never had chicken pox. She was a nurse and I find it hard to <br/>
believe as an only child I had it and it slipped by her, no matter how mild <br/>
of a case. You have to know my mom!!!! So for years I would panic everytime <br/>
I heard the word. Didn&#39;t want to be almost 30 and have them. Well my first <br/>
child came down with them and I was like 33-34 and I thought well here we <br/>
go. She had a lot of them but not real bad like I&#39;ve heard others say. The <br/>
Dr. told me I would get them for sure. When I didn&#39;t, he told me I had to <br/>
have had a case in my childhood, never mentioned a word about natural <br/>
immunity. I still don&#39;t think I had them and hopefully passed on some <br/>
immunity to my kids.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;As for whether or not to worry about it when they get older and<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t gotten these things, I&#39;ll cross that bridge when I come to it.<br/>
&gt; I think there&#39;s a huge difference in choosing vaccines selectively in<br/>
&gt; bigger/older children, and sticking newborn babes full of 10 different<br/>
&gt; vaccines in huge doses. Plus, DH and I love to travel and thus have<br/>
&gt; been innoculated against just about everything as we&#39;ve been to<br/>
&gt; several continents. Eventually if the kids want to travel, that will<br/>
&gt; probably be a necessity. Many countries require certain immunizations<br/>
&gt; for entrance. It will be something to think about at that point. Right<br/>
&gt; now, I&#39;m not worried, especially considering their natural resilience<br/>
&gt; right now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So you think vaccines in general aren&#39;t really harmful if given when<br/>
&gt; one is older?? That it&#39;s just with babies that can be a problem??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I knew of one lady from Australia that moved here with her kids and<br/>
&gt; hadn&#39;t had any of them vaccinated and had no problem moving here. I<br/>
&gt; thought it wasn&#39;t mandated that to travel you needed vaccines unless<br/>
&gt; going to a part of a country that may have very poor sanitary<br/>
&gt; conditions. Can&#39;t military people get out of being vaccinated?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mary B<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Everyone, including military personnel can avoid being vaccinated.<br/>
As for travel vaccines, they aren&#39;t really necassary if you keep <br/>
healthy and take precautions. I&#39;ve been all over Europe, India, <br/>
South East Asia and Central America without a single jab.<br/>
Some countries require proof of yellow fever vaccination as a <br/>
condition of entry - some African ones - but a health certficate from <br/>
a US/UK doc or a fake vaccintaion cert works just as well.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I know a fair bit about US vaccination requirements is <br/>
cos me and the kids had our immigration visa turned down <br/>
because we are non-vaccinated and we had to obtain a waiver. This <br/>
meant months of research into US law on vaccinations. Grrrrrrrr<br/>
<br/>
While vaccines are not *as* toxic to an adult, mainly because of <br/>
body size there are numerous documented cases of death, <br/>
paralysis, ill-health etc after a shot for adults.<br/>
I&#39;d avoid &#39;em all.<br/>

before we go trying to &quot;fix&quot; other countries and install some kind of new <br/>
