&lt;&lt;     can someone tell me what green chili is please. Ren! I&#39;m on the same <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s green chile with an &quot;e&quot;--technically, &quot;Serano peppers,&quot; but in New <br/>
Mexico, just &quot;green chile.&quot;  It&#39;s used as an ingredient (roasted, peeled and <br/>
chopped), as a casing (roasted, peeled NOT chopped, stuffed with cheese; then <br/>
battered and cooked; then covered in cream sauce--kind of the Scotch Egg of <br/>
northern New Mexico,  called &quot;chile relleno&quot;), and as the main ingredient in <br/>
a sauce which is used on enchiladas and other &quot;plate-meals&quot; and at home in <br/>
casseroles.<br/>
<br/>
People make salsa with it too.  Commercial salsa these days has jalape単o.  <br/>
Jalape単o isn&#39;t from around here.  It&#39;s often stored in oil, it&#39;s HOT hot hot <br/>
with no discernable taste, it&#39;s kind of daredevil food.  But green chile is <br/>
JUST food.  It has a taste.  It has lots of vitamin C and it&#39;s just good for <br/>
colds and stuffed up noses because it unstuffs your nose right then and there <br/>
(and then you get the vegetable and vitamin C effect too).<br/>

<br/>
What you see is RED chile.  I&#39;ll tell about that in a minute.<br/>
<br/>
But if you click on &quot;frozen green chile&quot; they&#39;ll show you a case of fresh <br/>
green.<br/>
(If you click on &quot;fresh&quot; they won&#39;t show you anything. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re four to eight inches long, in real life.  They sell it loose at the <br/>
grocery stores as long as it&#39;s in season.  You can buy it canned or frozen <br/>
anytime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Red is the green stuff, at the end of the season, dried.  Those strings of <br/>
chiles are called &quot;ristras,&quot; and people who make red chile sauce (which I do <br/>
not) just take a few and grind them up and make a sauce, kind of like a <br/>
gravy, and that can be used on enchiladas and other stuff too.  If it&#39;s put <br/>
on fried eggs, that&#39;s &quot;huevos rancheros.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152369207">Let me just add that it is very addictive.  Having lived for the <br/>
past 7 years in New Mexico and just moved to England both Red and <br/>
Green are desperately missed around here.  Fortunatly we have a <br/>
couple of sources who are sending care packages.  And we are trying <br/>
to fend off some of the cravings with curries, but they just aren&#39;t <br/>
the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033332362">Thanks for the info Sandra. We get quite a few chilli ( chili chillie?) <br/>
varieties over here now but no the large green ones you refered to as being <br/>
the green chile.<br/>
We do get big red chillis of the same size and shape as the green chile <br/>
which are very mild and used for stuffing, they look very similar. We also <br/>
get birdseye chillis (Thai) and scotch bonnet (Jamaican) plus the most <br/>
common which are small bullet chillis that are used in Indian cooking.<br/>
