<div id="ygrps-yiv-568091170">&lt;&lt;     I&#39;ve never written my dd&#39;s or ds&#39;s real names on the Internet <br/>
anywhere -- maybe someone can persuade me this is a foolish precaution even <br/>
for a <br/>
worrywart like me? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you should do what seems comfortable and wise for you yourself.<br/>
<br/>
There has been some side discussion lately about whether we should maybe have <br/>
had a policy added that told people not to reveal personal information about <br/>
their children.  (That&#39;s a bad paraphrase, but I don&#39;t want to quote.)<br/>
<br/>
It came up because I told my suspicions about Kirby&#39;s experiences.<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; lives have been lived in an unschooling spotlight.  They know.  We <br/>
discuss it.  They know they&#39;re &quot;poster children.&quot;  If they weren&#39;t there would <br/>
be people who might have wanted to unschool but couldn&#39;t grasp how it might <br/>
work, and so just bought a curriculum and then after a while put their kids back <br/>
in school.     Not just my kids, but other people&#39;s kids.  Julian getting a <br/>
B+.  Roya and Roxana Sorooshian taking college courses.  Lots of parents tell <br/>
lots of stories.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a rule or policy or even a reminder is appropriate.   Each <br/>
person who writes and hits &quot;send&quot; has made a decision.  We can&#39;t legislate common <br/>
sense.   If one person thinks I&#39;m telling too much about my kids and that it <br/>
will come back to bite me in the butt, I just know that it&#39;s a person who <br/>
doesn&#39;t know me and my kids.   If my stories are making any individuals <br/>
uncomfortable, should I stop telling them or shouldn&#39;t that person stop reading them?<br/>
<br/>
Home Education Magazine is full of parents telling real stories about their <br/>
real children.  It&#39;s the only way others can see it.  We don&#39;t have test scores <br/>
and statistics.  We don&#39;t have scientific proofs.  We have evidence, but it&#39;s <br/>
not anonymous, &quot;objective&quot; evidence.  It&#39;s real life real people.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have to agree on the level of sharing we do.  I&#39;m going to continue <br/>
to do my level.  Some lurk only, and they can continue to do their level.  <br/>
Some are vague and that&#39;s fine too.<br/>
<br/>
My only objection is when someone comes to the list and seems to be here with <br/>
a purpose or agenda other than sharing their personal knowledge of <br/>
unschooling.  Then I want them to show their hand (not necessarily with full names of <br/>
children!  just to tell us enough about their own experience so that we can <br/>
decide whether to listen to their opinions or to run them off, and sometimes just <br/>
asking makes thems skulk on away).<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t go to La Leche League without a nursing baby or without a <br/>
pregnancy.  I wouldn&#39;t go to Parents Without Partners while I was married.   I don&#39;t <br/>
think people should be on unschooling lists without involvement or serious <br/>
interest in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t happen often, but it happened lately.<br/>
