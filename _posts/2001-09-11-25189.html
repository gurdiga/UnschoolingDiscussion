<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561822860">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a request -- when changing or adding to a subject please write <br/>
something like &quot;Legos (was: learning  math) and please remember to <br/>
change the subject line to the topic rather then the digest #.  A lot <br/>
of us do not read every post and it makes it much easier to follow <br/>
threads that are of interest to us.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
Debbie</div>
