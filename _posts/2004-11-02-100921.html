<div id="ygrps-yiv-894845159">Hi!<br/>
My oldest daughter (12) is really having a hard time connecting with <br/>
other at home kids in our area.  She has plenty of social <br/>
interaction afternoon hours when she&#39;s in her perf. arts programs, <br/>
hanging out with kids after school hours, but would like to connect <br/>
with some at home peers.  We get involved with some homeschool <br/>
groups activities, but since we are unschoolers, it&#39;s hard for my dd <br/>
to connect with other kids that are often SO regimented...she feels <br/>
very guarded when she discusses things like music, movies.  In many <br/>
ways, she&#39;s found that she can relate to her public school peers <br/>
better socially...does this make sense at all?<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, we don&#39;t have a lot of unschoolers in our area.  And over <br/>
the course of time, we&#39;ve come to question whether <br/>
some &quot;unschoolers&quot; really were unschooling when you find out that <br/>
they use book lists, curriculum, etc. and seem to really &quot;guide&quot; <br/>
their childrens&#39; interests and activities.  And I&#39;m sure that some <br/>
of them see our &quot;liberal&quot; lifestyle as a possible &quot;bad influence&quot;.  <br/>
It&#39;s kind of funny, because when my daughters walk in the room, a <br/>
bunch of the kids get really excited and light up (they&#39;re fun to be <br/>
around!)...but then you see them get really guarded again around the <br/>
parents.  The girls notice it, too and have kind of pointed it out <br/>
to me (like why do the kids act different around their moms?).<br/>
<br/>
We talk a lot about how you can&#39;t look to just one &quot;group&quot; of people <br/>
to meet your needs socially, that you&#39;ll have friends, etc. that <br/>
you&#39;ll connect with in all walks of life.  And my daughter does, in <br/>
fact, have quite an interesting assortment, especially the perf. <br/>
arts crowd :)!  But understandably she would still like to make some <br/>
connections with other kids at home, even just to communicate on-<br/>
line.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any safe place that unschooling kids can chat?  <br/>
Is there a Yahoo group, pen-pal system, etc.? My dd has a lot of <br/>
penpals, but is starting to get frustrated with one line responses, <br/>
would love to have a good &quot;e-conversation&quot; with someone else, <br/>
similar to what we all do here!  In fact, she said to me tonight <br/>
that it wasn&#39;t fair that there were so many places I could go for <br/>
unschooling support and no place for her!  She&#39;s got a point...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I seemed to be all over the place here, trying to play SIMS <br/>
with the dd and type at the same time is quite challenging!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892328124">Cyndi,  does your daughter do IMing?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I know my daughter(10) does this with kids she met at the Live and Learn Conference.  There are a lot of teens that get together in a chat room every once in a while too.  My dd doesn&#39;t talk much at the chat room,  but they invite her in.  She has a couple of friends that she does IM with a lot.  It really helps her to feel connected.  Most of her friends online are 12 or older.<br/>
 <br/>
Does she know of the www.unschooling.info and www.unschooling.com websites?  There are teen areas at both of those sites too.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure my daughter would introduce her to some of these other unschooled teens if she wants to IM.   Let me know.  And Abbi, my dd, would probably like to talk with another unschooled friend too.  I can ask her later, as she&#39;s sleeping now,  a late night with her Sims 2 game.  :)<br/>

And a good book is Sam&#39;s How to Use Macromedia Flash MX: Visually in Full<br/>
