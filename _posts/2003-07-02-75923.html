OREGON TRAIL EDUCATION RESOURCE GUIDE<br/>

<br/>
The Oregon Trail Education Resource Guide was developed by BLM staff,<br/>
Trail Tender Volunteers, and Eastern Oregon University. The 158-page<br/>
Resource Guide is designed for use by teachers and other educators<br/>
who are teaching Oregon Trail history. Some activities are designed<br/>
for the classroom while others are specific to the Interpretive<br/>
Center and would necessitate a field trip to the site.  The guide is<br/>
designed for use by fourth grade teachers who traditionally teach<br/>
Oregon history, but many activities can be adapted to younger or<br/>
older students.  Copies are available at no charge to educators.<br/>
Copies may be downloaded, or a hard copy can be mailed upon request.<br/>
Teachers may make copies of any portion of the guide for classroom use.<br/>
Special notice: hard copies of the Education Resource Guide are<br/>
currently out of print. The Guide may be downloaded using the link<br/>
below. The Education Resource Guide will be reprinted and available<br/>
again in the near future.<br/>
A CD of the Education Resource Guide is now available. Contact us if<br/>
you would like a CD mailed to you or if you wish to be put on a<br/>
waiting list for a hard copy. Please e-mail us at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NHOTIC_mail@...">NHOTIC_mail@...</a> or telephone 541-523-1845 or contact the<br/>

SAVE THE BILL OF RIGHTS!<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.constitutioncenter.org/">http://www.constitutioncenter.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
The National Constitution Center opens this month in Philadelphia,<br/>
PA. The Center&#39;s Web site includes a &quot;Save the Bill of Rights&quot; game<br/>
in which &quot;your mission&quot; is to &quot;rebuild the document by finding the<br/>
missing rights and freedoms.&quot; Once the job is done, you can print out<br/>
and sign a copy of the Bill of Rights.<br/>
The site also offers lesson plans, and visitors can search by<br/>
subject, grade level or keyword.<br/>

HOMESCHOOLING AND THE TYPE A DAD<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/204/jadad.html">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/204/jadad.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Whether we came to homeschooling as a refuge from the barking dogs of<br/>
formal education or to the conclusion of a long study of all the<br/>
options, we all want many of the same things-the opportunity to grow<br/>
together as a family and the opportunity to remain primary movers and<br/>
shakers in our children&#39;s lives, rather than merely providing respite<br/>
from their real world. The freedom to wander, explore, create, and<br/>
rest on our own timetables. Unschooling, like no other approach,<br/>
sells these opportunities in spades.<br/>
The picture of unschooling, as drawn by any number of authors and<br/>
online purveyors of the practice, is surely a pretty one. After no<br/>
small amount of study, I was left with a vision of the<br/>
picture-perfect family. My own. In perfect harmony. Learning without<br/>
trying, succeeding without sweat. If I were to pursue marketing as a<br/>
vocation, and homeschoolers as my target population, I would be<br/>
peddling unschooling. Everyone loves a product that sells itself.<br/>
The way I&#39;ve come to see it, if homeschooling is like jumping off a<br/>
cliff into the great unknown, then a structured approach can be<br/>
likened to diligently getting that net up to break the fall.<br/>
Unschooling is more like enjoying the ride down.<br/>
The thing is, I don&#39;t want to die.<br/>
The tethers of unschooling can be too long for comfort, although I am<br/>
certainly not in it for the comfort. I have thought more about this,<br/>
now that my kids are getting older, and my commitment to<br/>
homeschooling has grown from an attractive idea to a lifestyle. I&#39;ve<br/>
had to look at who I am, and how close I really am to this perfect<br/>
unschooling guy I&#39;ve had dancing around my imagination since the idea<br/>
first took hold.<br/>
I don&#39;t think when Holt formulated the unschooling approach, he ever<br/>
really planned on it appealing to individuals with type A<br/>
personalities. I am sure it was assumed that those who have trust and<br/>
control issues, and are prone to nervous disorders, would be<br/>
attracted to school-in-a-box approaches. With a multitude of self<br/>
assessment tests available, and, if you pay for it, education<br/>
&quot;professionals&quot; available for consultation via phone, email or fax<br/>
anytime, it doesn&#39;t make sense that these people would even consider<br/>
the unschooling approach.<br/>
And yet, here I am.<br/>

<br/>
LEMONADE STAND ECONOMICS<br/>
<br/>
	I still have the first dime I ever made. It&#39;s a mercury head<br/>
coin that I received as payment for a cup of lemonade I sold from my<br/>
sidewalk stand. Our elderly neighbor, Mr. Landry, was my first<br/>
customer on that hot summer day about 35 years ago. I was proud that<br/>
my lemonade was made with real lemon juice and was refreshingly cold,<br/>
and my neighbor&#39;s response to it told me I had made the right choice.<br/>
	Entrepreneurship is a fantastic way for children to learn<br/>
broad lessons. Becoming a successful young businessperson includes<br/>
not just understanding money and budgeting, it also consists of<br/>
developing concern for quality, creating a market, learning to sell<br/>
yourself and your product, communication skills, and the ability to<br/>
stick to the task. It may even involve creating a partnership or<br/>
hiring others, and the wider issues that come with those.<br/>
&quot;Young Entrepreneurs&quot; were featured at Virginia Home Education<br/>
Association&#39;s Conference and Curriculum Fair, and it was wonderful to<br/>
see the children&#39;s ideas and products. Some of the offerings were<br/>
hand painted items, herb plants started from seed, pet treats, and,<br/>
most imaginatively, a board game that teaches the legislative process<br/>
in our state. So impressed was I by these children and their<br/>
entrepreneurial spirit that I invited young businesspeople in my area<br/>
to present their wares at our local Not Back to School Picnic and<br/>
Curriculum Swap/Sale last fall.<br/>
Maybe some of the products weren&#39;t the highest quality, but the kids<br/>
were still learning, and their selling methods endearing, so I<br/>
couldn&#39;t stop myself from buying from them with some of the cash I&#39;d<br/>
made from selling my unneeded supplies. The transparent glycerin<br/>
soaps with bugs inside were too fun to pass up, and I was sure my<br/>
friend&#39;s dog would enjoy a pack of those handmade peanutbutter dog<br/>
biscuits.<br/>
I clearly remember selling my first cup of lemonade-an event that<br/>
occurred over 3 decades ago-which means that interaction was<br/>
significant in my life. As an adult, I vowed to never pass up a<br/>
child&#39;s lemonade stand. Indeed, my children were startled when,<br/>
passing a stand on a lonely country road two summers ago, I turned<br/>
the car around and bought 3 glasses from the two little children<br/>
behind the table. Their product was...well, made with one of those<br/>
insipid mixes I can&#39;t stand. So, while I still do not pass up a<br/>
lemonade stand, I ask about ingredients before I buy more than one<br/>
glass. And if the answer isn&#39;t &quot;lemon juice, sugar and water,&quot; I will<br/>
give them my tip for success.<br/>

FINAL WORD<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parents are their children&#39;s first and most influential teachers.<br/>
What parents do to help their children learn is more important to<br/>
academic success than how well off the family is.&quot;<br/>
