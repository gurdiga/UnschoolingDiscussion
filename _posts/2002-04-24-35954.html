<div id="ygrps-yiv-949780509">Betsy,<br/>
I really appreciated your comments about learned helplessness. I agree<br/>
totally about schools being in the business of keeping kids dependent. As<br/>
example I hear comments all the time from my neighbors that they are<br/>
frustrated because they are not being able to help their 4th grader with<br/>
their math homework.<br/>
Ooops, got carried away there. Let me back up and introduce myself. I just<br/>
joined the list and have been lurking for a while. I am Cathy, Mom to an<br/>
almost 10 year old boy and a 7 year old girl. Both tremendous kids who were<br/>
in public schools until this year. We are really enjoying being with each<br/>
other.<br/>
I read a lot about the concept of learned helplessness when my son was<br/>
younger. He was born with down syndrome and as you can imagine I always<br/>
wanted to jump in and do for him. But because we pulled back  I have seen<br/>
over the years in him such growth in his desire to be independent.  Which is<br/>
great but the biggest surprise has been the growth in his problem solving<br/>
skills. My husband and I have had to resist every urge to make life easier<br/>
and less challenging for him. We could see that by just jumping in  we would<br/>
be taking away from him the opportunity to figure life out on his own.<br/>
I have enjoyed the energy on this list and look forward to learning a lot!<br/>
Cathy<br/>

I have had this explained to me as the prisonner missing the structure of prison after being released.  My daughter, who has been out of school for two years is a free spirit - she was the &quot;It&#39;s about time!&quot; kid.<br/>
<br/>
My son came out of a school which took &quot;structure&quot; to new heights, or depths, as it were.  He has been home for one year.<br/>
<br/>
Any helpful suggestions on ways to help a child who misses/needs? structure, yet remain true to unschooloing?<br/>
<br/>
How long can it take to &quot;deschool&quot;?  Could we still be experiencing &quot;deschooling&quot; after a year?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Shelly<br/>
<br/>
(I plan to check on the internet as well - thanks for the suggestion.)<br/>

<br/>
Yes!<br/>
<br/>
Let him create his own structure.  Get him a daytimer or a big wall calendar, <br/>
and let him plan to his heart&#39;s content!  <br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would provide whatever a structure-requesting kid wanted and <br/>
then would politely decline to enforce any of their self-imposed rules and <br/>
deadlines.<br/>
<br/>
Several times Holly has proposed some structure or schedule or &quot;rules&quot; and I <br/>
ask why, or just kind of chat with her about what she hopes to accomplish, <br/>
and it&#39;s never gone past one day.  But she does like to THINK about things <br/>
like what if she had to do five things by 11:00 a.m., and such.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How long can it take to &quot;deschool&quot;?  Could we still be experiencing <br/>
&quot;deschooling&quot; after a year?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t figure deschooling can even START until after the parents and <br/>
children are really intending to unschool.  Until unschooling is the true <br/>
goal, the kids might just see it as vacation between sessions--the lull <br/>
before the inevitable curricular storm, perhaps, to their way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t start counting the deschooling until AFTER you commit to not going <br/>
back to the actual or home-style &quot;school.&quot;<br/>

on him. If he wants classes or homework, help him set those things up for <br/>
himself. But don&#39;t check if he attends or grade his work. Whatever he&#39;s <br/>
looking for, help him make it *his* project.<br/>
<br/>
And while he&#39;s possibly phasing out of some of the structure, you can also <br/>
be offering some very cool alternatives  for him. :o)<br/>

there&#39;s no good reason to leave her there another minute IMO. You can still <br/>

worry about the school work or grades or anything that schools deem <br/>
important(except for behavior rules).<br/>
I would let her go if she felt like it and not go on days she didn&#39;t.<br/>
I would let her enjoy it for what she wants from it and not stress <br/>
about any of the acedemics.<br/>
That would probably be a hard thing to do for both of you.<br/>
She would probably just go along with the program, since she wants to <br/>
be there, but atleast the attitude would be different.  It would be <br/>
her choice.  If she doesn&#39;t go along, she probably doesn&#39;t really <br/>
want to be there, and you can take her out.  You really are free!<br/>

into unschooling or not let her finish the school year if that&#39;s what she <br/>
wants to do. That would certainly defeat the purpose of handing her back <br/>
some control over her own life/education wouldn&#39;t it? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stick by this statement, though. &quot;You can still start your<br/>

out into experiences and doing and watching and learning, you all might get <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Joanna -- I let Roya (who is now 17) finish her last 6 weeks of 4th grade <br/>
after &quot;I&quot; had decided she was going to homeschool after that. She didn&#39;t want <br/>
to try it. I asked her to give me a few months and promised we&#39;d reconsider <br/>
then. After a few weeks there was NO WAY she was wanting to go back. We <br/>
started out doing &quot;unit studies&quot; and our first one was &quot;the oceans.&quot; We went <br/>
to Sea World, the aquarium, and to the BEACH almost every single day. And I <br/>
did not fail to gently mention, &quot;Look at those kids in school, while WE are <br/>
going to the beach,&quot; as we passed by. We rented tapes of sea chanteys and <br/>
drew lifesize whales (in chalk) in the street and  went to a museum to see <br/>
seascapes and visited a &quot;tall ship&quot; and on and on. We had a great time and <br/>
Roya was thrilled and could absolutely see that this was REAL learning as <br/>
opposed to wasting her time in school.<br/>
<br/>
And - she was worried about friends, so I put a big calendar on the <br/>
refrigerator and made playdates for her, in advance, and put them, along with <br/>
Girl Scout meetings and soccer practice times, on the calendar. That was <br/>
enough for her - knowing that she&#39;d still have time with friends.<br/>
<br/>
I let her finish school because she was happy there - it was ME who could see <br/>
how much better things could be - I was the one with the homeschooling <br/>
vision, not her. She had projects and performances and end-of-year activities <br/>
she was looking forward to.<br/>
