<div id="ygrps-yiv-588715368">My husband thought I was crazy when I told him that the dogs (we have <br/>
three) love carrots.  I read somewhere that carrots should be given <br/>
in lieu of dog treats/buscuits because they are better for the dog <br/>
(and cheaper).  We buy baby carrots for my 6.75 year old and she lets <br/>
them beg for them!  Regards, sheree</div>
