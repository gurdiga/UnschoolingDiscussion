<div id="ygrps-yiv-864605724">I am sorry for the cross post to various lists....hope you don&#39;t get <br/>
too annoyed with me.<br/>
<br/>
We are an unschooling family of 4 and will be going away for two trips. <br/>
We would *love* to have another unschooling or homeschooling family <br/>
come stay at our house. There would be no cost, but we ask that you <br/>
take care of our 3 dogs (Lab, smaller mutt, Shih Tzu) and our 3 cats <br/>
and one Ball python. You could use one of our cars if you didn&#39;t bring <br/>
your own.<br/>
We live on 5 acres in Benson, AZ, which is town of 5000, about 45 <br/>
minutes form Tucson. Our house has 3 bedrooms (master, dd 9, ds 13), <br/>
DSL, XBox, Gamecube, NO television (other then many, many foreign <br/>
channels). We own some movies though and have two video stores in town <br/>
for rentals.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for these dates: Saturday, April 14 through Saturday, <br/>
April 28. And Wednesday, June 20 through Tuesday, July 10.<br/>
Arrival could be on earlier date, departure on later, but not the other <br/>
way around. Naturally we do not expect one family to come for both <br/>
dates...<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, please contact me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:arbinsy@...">arbinsy@...</a>. Feel free <br/>
to pass on this mail to any local lists you may be on. We do prefer a <br/>
home- or unschooling family, but if you know of someone else perfect, <br/>
that would be good too.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
