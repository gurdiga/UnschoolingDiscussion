<div id="ygrps-yiv-534382901"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can&#39;t understand why a child would claim to be addicted to something,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>unless they somehow got the idea from someone else that they shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
spending so much time on that activity or that that activity is somehow a<br/>
negative thing. Would any of us ever think that our child was addicted to<br/>
playing in the sandbox or riding their bike?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of negative talk about &quot;addictions&quot; that aren&#39;t really <br/>
addictions---but rather intense focus. I believe whole-heartedly that intense focus is <br/>
a GOOD thing. And that they can come and go, wax and wane. Addictions aren&#39;t <br/>
like that.<br/>
<br/>
My focal points have changed over the years---at different points in my life, <br/>
I&#39;ve been EXTREMELY focused on dogs: their breeding, training, grooming, <br/>
showing, judging. Horses: their training, handling, grooming, racing, tack, and <br/>
showing. Travel. Food, parties, and entertaining. Remodeling and decorating old <br/>
houses. Gardening. Ancient civilizations and sociology. Astronomy.  And land <br/>
searching. And beekeeping and alpacas. Unschooling is my main focus now---and I <br/>
had to throw myself into conferences for a while. Occasionally to the <br/>
detriment of other, more minor, things.<br/>
<br/>
Focus is HARD for many people. And I think that maybe THEY see focus as an <br/>
addiction. Could that be possible?<br/>
<br/>
Ben&#39;s  most recent issue of The Wine Spectator had a full page ad with a hand <br/>
holding a trout. Underneath was this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He never learned to fly-fish. Or play a trombone. Or waterski. Or learn <br/>
German. Here&#39;s to 90 years of focus!<br/>
<br/>
Happy 90th bithday, Robert Mondavi!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Made my day! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

AMEN!!!  I look at an addiction as something someone does repeatedly that is <br/>
harmful to themselves, such as drugs, over eating, etc.  I read every day, is <br/>
that an addiction?  Absolutely  not.  Sometimes I enjoy a book so much that I <br/>
will read until I am finished, do nothing else except the <br/>
necessaries-bathroom, eating, etc.  Still, not an addiction.  A choice; there&#39;s a difference.  <br/>
<br/>
And thank you for saying &quot;screw wellroundedness&quot;!!!  I feel the same way.  <br/>
Why should I know the price in China when (a) I&#39;m never going there and (b) <br/>
don&#39;t eat it anyway.  And there are many other reasons not to know the price of <br/>
rice in China.  There are many things I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t feel less of a <br/>
person for not filling myself up with a bunch of information that I will <br/>
eventually forget and never use anyway.  What I do know, I know well, and what I <br/>
don&#39;t know, well, I have the internet and the library for that IF I actually want <br/>
to learn it!<br/>
<br/>
Am I getting the hang of this unschooling or what??<br/>
