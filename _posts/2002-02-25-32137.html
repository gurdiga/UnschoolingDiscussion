<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213185288">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m divorced and have been unschooling my now 14 yo son since last <br/>
spring when he begged me to let him stay home. He was becoming very <br/>
depressed because of the social situation with other kids teasing him <br/>
about his appearance and what I consider a very sweet, lovable <br/>
nature. The teacher&#39;s punitive attitude was another problem, although <br/>
he wasn&#39;t personally getting into any real trouble - she just yelled <br/>
a lot. Not a happy educational experience.<br/>
<br/>
I had done some research on unschooling already, so when he asked, I <br/>
said yes without hesitation. He&#39;s been &#39;decompressing&#39; since then, <br/>
mostly playing video games and surfing the web. I was worried about <br/>
that and have been working on getting him interested in other things, <br/>
and he&#39;s starting to show some interest.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that people are now starting to ask a lot of questions <br/>
about what we &#39;do&#39; all day, and I don&#39;t know what to say. I stammer <br/>
and say, &quot;Well, I&#39;ve read a lot about it and you can&#39;t really <br/>
understand until you read this stuff,&quot; etc. Very lame response. <br/>
<br/>
I need an explanation that will get people off my back, particularly <br/>
relatives, and particularly about socialization which seems to be <br/>
more important to them than education. I want to print it out, <br/>
memorize it and even hand it out to all the critics. I&#39;m really tired <br/>
of defending my choices as a parent.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-751035197">Hi:  I am by no means an expert but I&#39;m in my fifth year of homeschooling my chldren ages 16 down<br/>
to 6.  I, too, have received a lot of questions over the years.  The best way to respond that I&#39;ve<br/>
found is to tell the person asking that we compile our learning around each child&#39;s individual<br/>
needs.  They usually don&#39;t know exactly what that means and they feel embarrassed to ask any more<br/>
questions.  I&#39;ve learned I don&#39;t have to go into any great detail.  As for socialization, my<br/>
children are involved in various musical lessons and Church so I tell people they are very happy<br/>
with our situation.  That being a &quot;joiner&quot; isn&#39;t important to them.  I hope this helps.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
where you are and still am getting the questions after 5 years.  Blessings to you and your son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471365155">Lavonne, I can relate.  You will get a lot of responses, and I know you<br/>
will be able to find some way of explaining it in your own words.  When<br/>
people asked my husband how we know our kids learn without tests, I<br/>
pointed him to a quote of John Holt in How Children Learn. &quot;We do not<br/>
need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning. <br/>
What we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world<br/>
as we can into the school and the classroom{home}; give children as much<br/>
help and guidance as they need and ask for; listen respectfully when they<br/>
feel like talking; and then get out of the way.  We can trust them to do<br/>
the rest.&quot;  I say &quot;I homeschool&quot; to avoid unnecessary confusion about<br/>
unschooling.  But when they question me, my canned response is, &quot;well,<br/>
they pursue their own interests and I help them along the way.&quot;  When<br/>
they ask if the children are learning the basic curriculum, I say, &quot;in<br/>
the process of learning they become well rounded.&quot;  You might say that<br/>
your son gets most of his education using the internet and playing<br/>
educational games.  I know it&#39;s sort of b.s., but so is what they are<br/>
thinking when they ask such things.  I guess what I am saying is more of<br/>
a response to someone you don&#39;t trust or don&#39;t know well enough to be<br/>
entirely forthcoming with.  But John Holt&#39;s quote isn&#39;t b.s. for those<br/>
people who really are interested in knowing how to unschool.<br/>
