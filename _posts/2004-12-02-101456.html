Curious about this...<br/>

<br/>
I figured I needed to change my train of thoughts and letting my <br/>
kids &#39;learn as we go thru life&#39; but what I think makes it hard is <br/>
trying not to compare my kids with their government-schooled <br/>
cousins.  And having 13 educators in our family sort of puts me in <br/>
the mode of wanting to prove we&#39;re learning, even if it isn&#39;t the <br/>
way &#39;they&#39; are doing in.  KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks again!  I have so much to learn!<br/>

<br/>
The comforting fact about this is that *he* knew he had accomplishments, and<br/>
his distress was over his girlfriend&#39;s obtuseness, rather than becoming<br/>
discouraged and self-deprecating and *believing* her point of view that he<br/>
had no accomplishments. That self-esteem is an important and wonderful<br/>
factor for you to hold on to - maybe even remind him of somehow.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  He started two years ago but this is his first fulltime, <br/>
academic semester.  He&#39;s a drama major so all his classes up until <br/>
now have been performance.  He still had to take tests and write <br/>
papers and reports but the load was lighter.  He knows that the <br/>
classes he&#39;s taking are just hoops (though he loves learning about <br/>
new subjects but he&#39;d rather just have dinner with the professors and <br/>
discuss things :-) and he just wants to jump through them ASAP.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re forced into it because it&#39;s the standard that society has and <br/>
it&#39;s constantly being thrown in our faces, educators in the family or <br/>
not.  I was reading an article recently that said something parents <br/>
in functional families meet the current needs of their children <br/>
without worrying about the future.  That&#39;s exactly what unschooling <br/>
does and the opposite of what schools do.  <br/>
