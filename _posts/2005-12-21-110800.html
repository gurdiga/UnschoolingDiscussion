Subject: Sibling  Fighting<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any advice on sibling  fighting? It&#39;s usually the same <br/>
story my older son picks on the younger  one until he gets mad and <br/>
pounces on his brother. It doesn&#39;t seem that  anything we try is <br/>
working. Today the older one woke up with a black eye  and scratches <br/>
all over his face which was the result of Starwars play gone  bad.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the Help.<br/>
<br/>

Maybe try to help the younger one through his feelings. <br/>
I have 4 and they do get on each others nerves at times. Usually it&#39;s bc I  <br/>
missed a child who needed to snuggle or snack. <br/>
 <br/>
I too have older and younger who play games together and there have been  <br/>
battles. They refuse to not play together so it&#39;s something that needs  time to <br/>
grow and we work it out. <br/>
 <br/>
I would be just as concerned about the older child&#39;s space though...<br/>
