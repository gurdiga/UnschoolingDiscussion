<div id="ygrps-yiv-653639807">Hi all, <br/>
I have been homelearning with my girls for 9 years now and we love it. Once<br/>
in a while I hit a &quot;wall&quot; and I wonder how to go around it, over it or through<br/>
it. <br/>
My eldest is doing grade 7 - 9 ...not really defined , thank goodness!....and<br/>
she is wanting more structure. She has embraced and looked for structure in<br/>
everything except writing...but she wants to be better at composition and the<br/>
like. I have tried &quot;Writing Strands&quot; and other style-type books but have not<br/>
found anything that is inspiring for her as well as being instructive. She<br/>
reads and comprehends at a high level (like most home learners) and has definite<br/>
opinions (like most home learners)  about what type of texts (the few she has<br/>
used) and books she enjoys.<br/>
But she has never written anything in paragraph form or done a book report<br/>
or anything like that. <br/>
So...where would I get a great and inspiring text or workbook.<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
I would appreciate any suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

fiction out there on the web - TV shows, movies, book series, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Brooke,<br/>
Nice to &quot;see&quot; you here.  I wonder if your daughter might like to be part of <br/>
an online critique group.  I&#39;m not sure where she might find one, but <br/>
joining a list for people who write things similar to what she likes to <br/>
write or wants to write might be a place to find one.  I joined one that <br/>
was an offshoot of the children&#39;s writing list I&#39;m on.  When that one <br/>
didn&#39;t work out for me, I just put out a call on the list for people <br/>
wanting a group.  It&#39;s working well.  We send work to the list when we want <br/>
it critiqued and the rest send it back to the list with their <br/>
comments.  It&#39;s quite informal, and members can contribute as much as they <br/>
want as long as they critique as much or more as they send in for <br/>
critiqueing.  The only real rule is that we try to be kind about what we <br/>
say, honest but kind.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are teens whose parents are on this list or hs-ca or another <br/>
list who would be interested in such a group.<br/>
