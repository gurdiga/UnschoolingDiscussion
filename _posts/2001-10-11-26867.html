 </span></blockquote>Authoritative.  Which it is not, as it contains previously collected <br/>
material, as does Indispensable.  Our favorite is Scientific Progress <br/>
goes Boink?.  It contains that delightful story/series as well as a <br/>
couple with Roslyn, the evil babysitter.  Go with ANY of them and you <br/>
can&#39;t go wrong.  Max started reading because of Calvin & Hobbes -- he <br/>
wanted me to read them to him 24/7, and I wasn&#39;t always available, or <br/>
my throat would get hoarse from so much reading, so he finally got <br/>
through them on his own.  I have a friend whose daughter was <br/>
diagnosed with hyperlexia -- she could read very well at an early <br/>
age, but didn&#39;t converse with people.  She would repeat back whatever <br/>
you said to her, or just quote from books.  Her parents (along with <br/>
other therapy) started reading C&H to her, and because of the <br/>
conversational style of the writing -- well, it IS conversation -- <br/>
she began conversing with fellow humans.  I&#39;ve always wondered if a <br/>
study&#39;s been done about C&H and reading abilities, etc.  Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
Lazy Sunday is ONLY the Sunday color comics, not a collection of all the <br/>
strips. Maybe Authoritative is actually from #3 and #4?<br/>
