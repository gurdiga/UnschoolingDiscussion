<div id="ygrps-yiv-957088338">Many unschoolers enjoy a childhood untrammeled by social pressure to conform<br/>
at the expense of individuality.  Unfortunately, as they approach college<br/>
age, more than a few &quot;throw in the towel&quot; so to speak in their often<br/>
well-intentioned quest to &quot;get ahead&quot; and/or qualify for college admission<br/>
and later the working world.  There is nothing wrong with going to college<br/>
and subsequently getting a job.  There is, however, something wrong when<br/>
those pursuits turn learning into something for power rather than pleasure.<br/>
I&#39;m convinced that sort of thing happens more often than most people would<br/>
care to admit.<br/>
<br/>
I like to believe that unschooled children can grow up and enjoy the same or<br/>
even greater freedom as unschooled adults.  They can do this while accepting<br/>
adult responsibilities, financially providing for themselves and their<br/>
family, and being active contributors to their communities.<br/>
<br/>
There are many other people who agree with me on this point.  A few of them<br/>
have created a fascinating non-commercial website with over 100 pages which<br/>
explores many aspects of what they describe as &quot;creating livable<br/>
alternatives to wage slavery.  It may give young unschoolers the inspiration<br/>
to continue following their bliss even as adults.  You can find it at:<br/>
