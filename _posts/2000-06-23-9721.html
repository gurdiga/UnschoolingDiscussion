&lt;&lt; And where are the fathers? &gt;&gt;<br/>
they marry the &quot;wrong men&quot; to start with and make babies because they think <br/>
that will solve the problems of the relationship, which of course it doesn&#39;t. <br/>
 Having children is much harder on a relationship that is rocky and it takes <br/>
a solid relationship where the couple are on the same page to deal with kids.<br/>
<br/>
if they haven&#39;t married the wrong man, they have just used him as a sperm <br/>
donor and he didn&#39;t bother to stay around and they don&#39;t think it&#39;s important <br/>
that men are in their kids lives.  (Yes I have some interesting clients)<br/>
<br/>
I cannot personally understand that mentality.... I could not and would not <br/>
do this without my husband (unless he died and I had no choice)...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;Feminism<br/>
 </span></blockquote>didn&#39;t invent our economic system nor our materialism/consumerism.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
it may have not invented it but it has gone a long way to help the break up <br/>
of families and to encourage women to have kids on their own as if it only <br/>
takes a female to have and  raise a child instead of it taking both to create <br/>
and both to raise it.  With my line of work the &quot;norm&quot; are people who put <br/>
themselves and their egos first above and beyond what&#39;s best for their kids.  <br/>
Ego wins everytime and that ego need to be feed with money and being in the <br/>
work place where they can catch the next man.. This is not a cynical view but <br/>
a realistic one considering the number of women I talk with on a weekly basis.<br/>

But you are talking to a self-selected sample of women. Women who call you<br/>
call just because things are not right.  There are many millions of women<br/>
living very different lives.  Different from you AND me.<br/>
<br/>
And I would lay wager that if you could have a slumber party with most of<br/>
these women, you would find ego really isn&#39;t in their heart of<br/>
hearts.....they just no longer know how to strip things down to the core and<br/>
live there.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My friend that I described on an earlier post ( we drifted apart when I <br/>
decided to quit my job,and homeschool)  is probably a good example of this.  <br/>
She has said several times that she  hates her job, or is thinking of <br/>
quitting, but deep down, I think she can&#39;t let herself do that.  She  has <br/>
worked for so long now, that it&#39;s like she can&#39;t change that part of her <br/>
life, in her perspective.  To her, they need her income.  Some people are not <br/>
willing to pare down their lifestyles, in order for a parent to be home more <br/>
with children, and she is an example of this.  A few years ago she inherited <br/>
$100,000.  They could have made it work where one parent could have been home <br/>
more-- one of the parents could have at least opted to work part time.  But, <br/>
they spent most of the money, and refinanced their home for a lower payment, <br/>
when they could have paid it off or almost paid it off.  They are just into a <br/>
lot of materialism, and  are somewhat competitive about having and doing <br/>
things.  I think she did not have a lot materialistically  as a child, so it <br/>
seems important to her and her dh, to have as much as they can now.   At any <br/>
rate, it seems that they are in a mindset that will not change.  ~Karen</div>

<br/>
Actually that&#39;s not the only reason women call... I do have plenty of healthy <br/>
clients as well that are looking for spiritual guidance or want a change in <br/>
their careers (they don&#39;t have kids to consider)... Of course in their heart <br/>
of hearts they want to be happy or with their kids... they just don&#39;t have <br/>
faith you can have both.  They think it has to be money or happiness and <br/>
that&#39;s not true.<br/>
