<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090233487">My 10 yr old dd is very sensitive about everything.  I&#39;m way different than I used to be in the parenting department and I don&#39;t know that she is adjusting to my changes.  Now instead of making them do what I say I ask them if they feel like helping me do some thing and generally they say no to a chore but yes to most other things.  Well, she will never say no, she will begrudgingly do the thing(if it is a chore like help pick up a room or something like that), even if I say she doesn&#39;t have to I just wondered if she wanted to.  Do I just lay off or should I explain what I&#39;m trying to accomplish with our new lives by unschooling?  She seems to have the mentality (all my fault) that if she helps mom, she is good, and if she doesn&#39;t she is not good.  How do I wash away this way misguided thought I put into her?  I guess maybe just de-compress as long as it takes?  Now that I&#39;m typing it out.it looks like I want to push her into trust.  I guess I need some de-parenting, huh?  My 8 yo is somewhat this way also but not as intense.  My others are 5 and 2 and demand to be their own person.. I don&#39;t know if they would even allow me to &quot;teach&quot; them anything! lol<br/>
comments welcome and appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I would avoid making any announcements or pronouncements about the <br/>
big change. (g) It may be difficult for her to accept it and she may be <br/>
wary of it or wondering when things are going to go back to &quot;normal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You might consider though changing the way you approach these topics.  The <br/>
advice I have seen here that I *really* resonate with is visualizing how <br/>
you might like your husband to talk to you about, say, clearing off the <br/>
table or picking up the stuff off the floor in the living room.  Or, how <br/>
you might ask a really good friend.  You know, something like, &quot;Hey, if <br/>
you&#39;re not too busy right now, would you mind giving me a hand with...?&quot; <br/>
Or, &quot;Ooh, I see you&#39;re really involved with ____. When you&#39;re done with <br/>
that, do you think you would have a minute to help me with ______?&quot;  Then, <br/>
be prepared to hear a &quot;No, I can&#39;t.&quot;  And if you do hear a &quot;no,&quot; accept it <br/>
in a friendly way, the way you would want someone to accept your &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, let your change be your announcement.  That&#39;s putting your <br/>
money where your mouth is!  (g)  I hope that helps.<br/>

Ah yes!  I can see that now, and quite understandable for her, too, <br/>
considering all the big changes in such a short span of her life.  <br/>
Thank you..that helps alot.<br/>

You know, this is exactly how I explain it to my husband when <br/>
discussing speaking to the children...funny how I sometimes forget my <br/>
own advice..lol. Thanks for the reminder. :)<br/>
