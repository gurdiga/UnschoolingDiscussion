<div id="ygrps-yiv-491415181">Okay, anyone who&#39;s known me from this and other lists, know how much <br/>
I beleive in treading lightly on this earth, using organic food, <br/>
natural cleaners and working for the balance.<br/>
<br/>
WELL! I&#39;ve been staying at a hotel for the past two weeks and my son <br/>
and I discovered the microwave. Okay, I will never buy one, or use it <br/>
more than a 2 - 3 times a year BUT, can you imagine how we felt when <br/>
we popped popcorn???? I mean, what an amazing thing!! I&#39;m in shock, <br/>
I&#39;m overwhelmed with disbelief!!!<br/>
<br/>
WOW! I must say for people who use pre-packaged foods and modern <br/>
conveniences such as this.. geez.. life must be so much *easier*!!!<br/>
<br/>
Cooking and preparing and shopping at obscure places not only hurts <br/>
our budget dramatically, it also eats away time I would like to spend <br/>
with my family... I know I won&#39;t change my ways.. but<br/>
<br/>
Wowza!!! <br/>

Eating the raw lifestyle is even easier than the fast food way, I think. <br/>
Of course, I live next to Eugene Oregon, where there is a natural foods<br/>
store on every corner practically.  I used to live in Arkansas where I<br/>
had to drive an hour to find one health food store and two hours to find<br/>
the other one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We mostly use ours for grilled cheese sandwiches.  You can only do meat <br/>
that doesn&#39;t have bones, which we don&#39;t often do.  My son recently figured <br/>
out that he can heat up frozen perogies faster in the grill than any other way.<br/>

friends say that his grills off-gas from the teflon worse than most pans.<br/>
