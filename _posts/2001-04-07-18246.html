<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247707425">I&#39;m finally sorting out all the great things people said in response <br/>
to my post about Aubrey so I can answer some of the comments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Aspergers, Autism, Tony Atwood, and bipolar.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks! I&#39;ll look into this stuff. I know an Aspergers person, though <br/>
and I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s Aubrey.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Have you been able to talk to your daughter since this happened? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is she withdrawn? Have you reassured her of your love? She may feel <br/>
like she betrayed you. Does your son realize how unfair his question <br/>
was? Why did he ask her that in the first place? Do you still notice <br/>
the mood swing periods since you have been homeschooling? Does she <br/>
communicate her feelings much when she seems down? &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we&#39;ve talked about it a couple times. No, she&#39;s  very &quot;up&quot; now <br/>
intensely so. In fact, she lapsed into what I can only describe as <br/>
manic hysteria earlier. Yes, I&#39;m always telling her I love her. Yes, <br/>
I talked to my son about asking the question. Today, probably because <br/>
of the incident, Aubrey asked me out of the blue who I loved more, <br/>
her or dh, her or ds, dh or ds? To each question I said I love both <br/>
as much as I could possibly love anyone. Then she said it&#39;s the same <br/>
for her, with me and the blanket. Yes, the mood swings are unchanged <br/>
since homeschooling, even though she absolutely loves homeschooling. <br/>
No, when she&#39;s down, she withdraws and won&#39;t speak or interact. She <br/>
hides in her room, curled up in a ball in bed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe you could keep a mood journal of sorts and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>see if you notice a pattern or possibly something that triggers her <br/>
moods.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a fantastic idea, and I&#39;ve already started! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;she never really did out-grow the thing&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of people wrote about older kids still needing blankets or <br/>
dolls. I&#39;ve known people like that, and the blanket and thumb haven&#39;t <br/>
been a problem, really, except trying to convince her the blanket <br/>
needs washing when it smells. It was the incident where my son <br/>
questioned her and I felt hurt and she went into a withdrawn stage <br/>
that was the problem, not the long-term blanket attachment itself.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;You are right to be concerned about how children can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>often be over-medicated these days. Maybe the day will come when she<br/>
could benefit from medication but I wouldn&#39;t think that day is <br/>
here.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think I&#39;m feeling strong agreement with that at this point. <br/>
Someone mentioned someone who was like Aubrey and said it wasn&#39;t a <br/>
problem until he started self-medicating with alcohol and drugs. I <br/>
guess if I see Aubrey heading in that direction, I&#39;ll consider <br/>
medication.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If you become truly concerned with moodiness and unhappiness as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time goes on perhaps experimenting with the herbal St. John&#39;s Wort <br/>
could indicate some change.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought of that in the past, but I&#39;ve been hesitant because SJW <br/>
makes *me* burn to a crisp in the sun, and Aubrey has my skin. But <br/>
maybe I could start her on it in the fall when it&#39;s less sunny and <br/>
see if it helps.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Our 7yo, Owen, chews his clothes.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A few people wrote about this. Both my kids chew their clothes until <br/>
there are holes in them. Actually, Erik (10yo ds) mostly stopped at <br/>
around 9yo. It&#39;s not a big issue, except when I see something new <br/>
getting holes chewed into it. Then I just ask them to change clothes. <br/>
But her blankey is chewed, on and off, all day, every day, for the <br/>
past 6 years, ever since she got teeth. In fact, most of the dye has <br/>
been chewed out of it, and it&#39;s significantly smaller than it used to <br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I would really hate to see them start to wonder if something <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is &quot;wrong with me&quot;. To me THAT is much more damaging &quot;Is something <br/>
wrong with me?&quot; is a question that haunts many of us from our <br/>
childhood, and it breaks my heart when a child starts to wonder <br/>
this.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This really hit home. I keep thinking about it. I was always made to <br/>
feel there was something wrong with me as a kid. It was my parents&#39; <br/>
style to be very critical and unaccepting. I hope that I haven&#39;t made <br/>
Aubrey feel this way. I&#39;m pretty sure she knows how wonderful I think <br/>
she is. She&#39;s self-confident and she likes herself, so she probably <br/>
does. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The first was that it sounds to me like your daughter&#39;s reaction <br/>
 </span></blockquote>may be more from feeling like she&#39;s being pushed to give up the <br/>
blanket than how she separates her attachment to others.  She may be <br/>
reluctant to admit that it&#39;s not as important as any other loved <br/>
thing or person for fear it will mean she has to give it up.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This also hit home. I think you&#39;re right. She is always afraid when <br/>
it&#39;s misplaced for a minute or two. Her brother does comment <br/>
disparagingly about it sometimes. I mean, it *IS* a very ugly, <br/>
tattered thing, and it *DOES* smell sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The good thing about homeschooling is that Aubrey won&#39;t HAVE <br/>
 </span></blockquote>teachers and counselors and other kids making her moods worse, or <br/>
spotlighting them, or praising her for being &quot;up&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I don&#39;t like when friends or relatives praise her for being <br/>
cheerful. (Oh! I see you&#39;re in a better mood today! That&#39;s great!) I <br/>
think that&#39;s done less with boys, so it gets my feminist hackles up. <br/>
I like to think that BOTH the up and down moods are still Aubrey, and <br/>
I don&#39;t like it implied that a significant part of her personality is <br/>
bad, or that she should pretend to be happy when she&#39;s feeling down. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I would recommend dealing gently with Aubrey in the moment.  It&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>possible that the dye and bacteria aren&#39;t as bad as the shaming and <br/>
pressure.   So because I was that way as a kid too, I teach him <br/>
tricks which nobody thought to teach me.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This comment made me blush, because of the words &quot;shame&quot; <br/>
and &quot;pressure.&quot; I&#39;m embarrassed to think I implied that I shame or <br/>
pressure her about her moods, her blanket, her thumb, or anything <br/>
else. We are the sort of family where, rather than forbid kids to <br/>
swear, we tell them we don&#39;t believe certain words are inherently <br/>
bad, but that name calling is hurtful and using certain words in <br/>
public offendes people who do believe they&#39;re bad.So we&#39;d rather they <br/>
say shit when they stub their toes than call someone a jerk. But that <br/>
lots of people disagree, so saying shit in public isn&#39;t a good idea. <br/>
This is just an example. We&#39;re really not a shaming or pressuring <br/>
family at all. However, ds may make her feel shame when he lets her <br/>
know he thinks the blanket is gross.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;allergy-related behavioral issues.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a very good point. We all have allergies and asthma. I <br/>
bookmarked the website you mentioned to look at when I get a chance. <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;d suggest maybe contacting La Leche League to see if they have <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the name of someone who is pro-attachment and can give you a balanced <br/>
viewpoint on whether or not you should seek additional help&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is good advice I hadn&#39;t thought of. Thanks! I will do that.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all of you, who amazed me with the time you were <br/>
willing to take to offer advice and support. I&#39;m SO glad I found this <br/>
group!  Love and gratitude, Juli</div>

<br/>
Can you just hang it outside on the line to let the sun &quot;sanitize it&quot; some <br/>
without removing all the juju?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Her brother does comment <br/>

<br/>
I think the best thing you can do is persuade the brother to hush up totally. <br/>
 <br/>
I hope he&#39;s not saying worse things when you&#39;re not around.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We&#39;re really not a shaming or pressuring <br/>
family at all. However, ds may make her feel shame when he lets her <br/>
know he thinks the blanket is gross.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No doubt.<br/>
But the question of what she&#39;d rather give up was really unfair, and <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have been answered (shouldn&#39;t have been asked).  There can be <br/>
inherent and subtle shaming (even about words which are allowed).  If the <br/>
blanket she loves stinks (or even &quot;smells bad&quot;), that is shame.  IT stinks, <br/>
or she herself MADE it stink.  And because of that stink it is (even <br/>
temporarily) taken away from her.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she can sit out near it when it&#39;s on the line.<br/>
It can be called &quot;warmed up&quot; instead of &quot;aired out&quot; maybe, or...  I don&#39;t <br/>
know.  But if she loves the blanket it might make her feel better to think <br/>
her family at least didn&#39;t hate the blanket, or had some respect for it.<br/>
