<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330521951">Geez Louise, how to say this without starting a real controversy.  Oh well,<br/>
guess I&#39;ll just jump right in.<br/>
<br/>
The Education of Little Tree is a fraud.  The author was not an orphan, he<br/>
wasn&#39;t raised by his grandparents, he was a racist of the first order (KKK),<br/>
is NOT Cherokee, it is not an autobiography and he didn&#39;t know from anything<br/>
about the Cherokee culture.  He invented the words he used in the novel,<br/>
they are NOT even Cherokee.  In fact, he was the speech writer that came up<br/>
with the now enfamous, (don&#39;t remember exact words but these are close<br/>
enough for MOST people &lt;g&gt;), &quot;Segregation then, segregation now, segregation<br/>
forever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And before anyone gets their bloomers in a bunch or knots in their thong<br/>
(which is probably more current &lt;g&gt;), here are tons of references:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-620865066">Lynda, you wrote<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; And before anyone gets their bloomers in a bunch or knots in their thong<br/>
(which is probably more current &lt;g&gt;) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would like to ask as calmly and respectfully as possible that you try not <br/>
to be so antagonistic and insulting.<br/>
<br/>
The Education of Little Tree is indeed fraudulent as it was originally <br/>
presented.  It was published by the University of New Mexico Press and so the <br/>
unfolding of the discovery was big in local news.  In the long run, the book <br/>
was recategorized as fiction and is still found useful by lots of people for <br/>
its philosophy and inspiration, I suppose, which is what lots of novels are <br/>
good for.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not defending the book.  I haven&#39;t read it.  I have friends who have and <br/>
liked it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m defending balance and calm.  Lots of writers and artists and musicians <br/>
were drunks or addicts or perverts or gamblers or whatever.  We&#39;re not <br/>
building religions out of them.  I see no reason to reject all of an artist&#39;s <br/>
product because of his or her political or sexual or biochemical bent.  I <br/>
know some people will disagree with me.  Photographs by a heterosexual with <br/>
no discovered sexual misconduct are more respected by some people (whether <br/>
they&#39;re good or not) than photographs by someone who is gay or lesbian.  <br/>
People who believe that way would probably not say &quot;gay or lesbian,&quot; though.  <br/>
Prejudices are all around us and it seems to me we might as well not make <br/>
them worse unnecessarily.<br/>

&gt; Really?? Hmm. . . my experience has not been this. A group of &quot;new-agers&quot; <br/>
&gt; as you call them was welcomed with open hearts and arms into a Lakota-Sioux <br/>
&gt; sundance. They are open to hearing of others experiences and seeing if they <br/>
&gt; can use that information to benefit their journey.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was thinking about this the other day after discussing vision quest <br/>
&gt; things with a friend of mine. She has incorporated some of the native <br/>
&gt; things and some things she has gathered on her own to create  her own way <br/>
&gt; of leading vision quests. Of course, it is not the &quot;true&quot; Lakota way, <br/>
&gt; rather it is her own way that she has felt led to lead (that sounds kinda <br/>
&gt; funny!). Anyway, my point is that different cultures and belief systems can <br/>
&gt; &quot;borrow&quot; ideas and ways of doing things and have their own thing. I can <br/>
&gt; &quot;borrow&quot; some of the ideas in Little Tree and use them in my own life. We <br/>
&gt; can get all caught up in the truth and what that may or may not be <br/>
&gt; according to some expert. I prefer to trust my own intuition about what is <br/>

I had been interesting in digging into before, though my mother has been<br/>
passionate about her studies,<br/>

requests for documentation of details you have presented.  Please answer <br/>
these questions, or drop out of the discussion (or throw a fit and insult me, <br/>
but the third is certainly not the best choice):<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?<br/>
Are you &quot;a real American Indian [getting tired of all the new-agers and all <br/>
the bull...]?<br/>
How old are your children?<br/>
Have you always homeschooled?<br/>
Are you an unschooler?<br/>

Do you believe that lies are always bad?  (Like fictionalized profiles which <br/>

I&#39;m not being hypothetical in the least.<br/>

<br/>
When my kids ask me if such things are true, I say &quot;Some of it might be, but <br/>
other stories were added.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other night I was reading some Robin Hood to Holly for bedtime.  It <br/>
mentioned Robin Hood ballads and Holly asked if I knew any.  I know one.  <br/>
I&#39;ve heard several, and I have a book full, but I was able to sing her the <br/>
one I knew (Robin Hood and the Friars) and she was impressed.  (I was <br/>
impressed to remember it all! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty inspiring.  But it&#39;s not a lie.  It&#39;s tradition.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424297862">As this is a direct invitation to flame, I have taken my answer off-list.<br/>
Although, Sandra does have my permission to post to the list but only if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t do anymore creative editing.<br/>
<br/>
However, I will answer one part on the list.  Do I believe that lies are<br/>
always bad?  Well, I believe we took up a lot of list space discussing just<br/>
this thing not to long ago.  My answer stands.  Define lie.  Like child<br/>
abuse, religion, and politics, everyone has their own definition.<br/>
<br/>
However, I find that lies that harm others to be totally unacceptable.  Lies<br/>
that steal from another I find to be totally unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t find &quot;misinformation&quot; in an age when the U.S. has become the next<br/>
thing to being a police state to be unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
And, I think it is down right silly to jump from misinformation on an<br/>
internet profile to a comparision with someone who invented a whole new<br/>
persona with the intent to defraud the general public and to make money off<br/>
of it.  A persona that stole its identify from a group of people that have<br/>
reached their saturation point with things stolen by white men.<br/>

How old does a good yarn have to be to stop being a falsehood and start<br/>

<br/>
I used to think that the difference between art and propaganda is that art<br/>
has the intention to tell the truth, whereas propaganda&#39;s clear intention<br/>
is to manipulate and deceive.  But, fiction and mythology are &quot;true&quot; on a<br/>
gut level, but not so much factually true.  That messes up my idea.<br/>

Anyone have enough ideas about philosophy to take on &quot;What is Truth?&quot; and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624340100">We worked on a few disney and disney type films and had a couple (or was it<br/>
three) Hitchcock films done in our &quot;backyard&quot; and none of them were done<br/>
where they were suppose to.<br/>
<br/>
The Birds is supposedly set in a Cornish village, quite a ways from Bodega<br/>
Bay where it was actually filmed.  Pollyanna is supposed to be set in &quot;small<br/>
town America&quot; in the midwest.  It is set on a street of multi-million dollar<br/>
homes on a busy street in a city of 130,000.  The &quot;farm house&quot; is actually<br/>
the &quot;McDonald&quot; Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Salem&#39;s Lot was filmed on the opposite coast and about as un-East coast as<br/>
you can get.  The same little village (Ferndale, which is across the Eel<br/>
River from the location of Halloween III) which was transformed into the set<br/>
of &quot;Outbreak.&quot;  The &quot;little people&quot; in &quot;The Gnome Mobile&quot; weren&#39;t playing<br/>
anywhere near the blarney stone, they were playing across the highway from<br/>
&quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; up here in the redwoods.<br/>
<br/>
So, here&#39;s some movie trivia.  What do &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer,&quot;<br/>
&quot;Finian&#39;s Rainbow&quot; and &quot;The Birds&quot; have in common?  They were all filmed in<br/>
Bodega Bay.<br/>
<br/>
What do &quot;Stop Or My Mom Will Shot,&quot; &quot;Die Hard 2,&quot; &quot;It&#39;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad<br/>
World,&quot; &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;Cujo&quot; all have in common?  They were all filmed within<br/>
a couple of miles of the filming location for Pollyanna.<br/>
<br/>
What do &quot;The Goonies,&quot; &quot;The Horse Whisperer,&quot; &quot;Giant,&quot; &quot;Basic Instinct,&quot;<br/>
&quot;Howard the Duck,&quot; &quot;Flubber,&quot; &quot;Tucker&quot; and &quot;Being John Malcovich&quot; have in<br/>
common with &quot;American Graffitti.&quot;  Yep, you guessed it, filmed in Sonoma<br/>
County.<br/>
<br/>
So with the &quot;magic of Hollywood,&quot; one never knows where one actually is.<br/>

&gt; I had been interesting in digging into before, though my mother has been<br/>

&gt; That you brought up the fraudulent past of the author/movie, is not what I<br/>

That my response to you had nothing to do with your feeling<br/>
a need to clarify *information* to the list, but with a seemingly<br/>
way-too-intense<br/>
response to a post of mine in which I said that I liked a movie. I don&#39;t<br/>
participate<br/>
in this list on a daily basis, though I&#39;d like to. I skim and lurk and<br/>
occasionally<br/>
have a comment, so my comment had nothing to do with previous frustrations<br/>
you have with other posters on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the things that you&#39;ve talked about in your posts, are<br/>
talked about in a non manipulative way, in that movie. The visuals are<br/>
just *there.*<br/>
<br/>
It is okay that someone can&#39;t find enjoyment in something<br/>
because of various principles they personally hold. It is okay that they<br/>
say as much.<br/>
And yet, I think that with most Art, people have to be able to stand back<br/>
and objectively view the content of a work...which is not sold now<br/>
as an autobiographical work. I didn&#39;t say that it was, and yet was dealt<br/>
with<br/>
by you as a person not worthy to be an unschooler?? ICK.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should be more careful, about taking<br/>
out your frustrations on people. You don&#39;t get to define what<br/>
an Unschooler is for me, or where I personally get inspiration from.<br/>
You understand so much about some people not imposing their<br/>
all-mighty will on others but seem to have not had a grip on that yourself<br/>
where my simple, non-offensive post was concerned.<br/>
<br/>
In answer to your question, that is what I meant be &quot;misplaced.&quot;<br/>

With Robin Hood and other historical characters (Paul Bunyon NOT among them, <br/>
btw, as that was totally composed 19th century propaganda, and not folklore), <br/>
as things are added over centuries it becomes no longer the clear single <br/>
creation of any one person or even neighborhood and becomes the joint <br/>
property of a culture or language.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really interested in ballads, and my interest is to preserve them as <br/>
they&#39;re found.   Others are into changing them.  Now obviously they&#39;ve been <br/>
changed, or there wouldn&#39;t be so many different versions.  But gradual, <br/>
natural changes in something people are attempting to preserve are appealing <br/>
to me personally, as a study in geography and time and distance.   So I&#39;m <br/>
conservative about folklore versions.  I want purer and older, an <br/>
anthropological &quot;clean catch.&quot;  Others think &quot;What the heck, I&#39;m putting <br/>
names to the characters and changing the ending!&quot;  Not purists. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Robin Hood wouldn&#39;t have so many adventures were it not for ballads.  And <br/>
Robin Hood might be barely known to us at all if it weren&#39;t for Howard Pyle <br/>
and some of the other Victorian medievalists.  <br/>
<br/>
I love that stuff!  It&#39;s fun when my kids show an interest, but I don&#39;t press <br/>
it on them.<br/>

(My boys can recite &quot;Men in Tights&quot; and I&#39;ve never even been able to watch <br/>
the whole show...)<br/>

I have been oft ridiculed because I don&#39;t let my children believe Santa Claus comes to peoples houses. He is a fun myth and my children know it. Why do I do this? I remember being six years old and being told Santa Claus wasn&#39;t real in the sandbox at school. (rather viciously, I might add) I was furious my mother had lied to me. She spent much time teaching me to tell the truth. I didn&#39;t trust her after that. Truth can be used as an excuse for rudeness also. Where is the line between tact and truthfulness? I have often wrestled with it.<br/>

Just to let you know, Johanna, you are not alone in this.  We have not<br/>
succumbed to the &quot;Santa thing&quot;  either.  Just a matter of choice, but boy,<br/>
do we get flack about it from family...grin...We don&#39;t do the tooth-fairy,<br/>
easter bunny, etc, either, just in case you are wondering. And, we do still<br/>
celebrate these holidays, just put the emphasis on a different perspective<br/>
than what most people do.  And my children know that some families chose to<br/>
enjoy the santa, toothfairy, etc, and that it is NOT alright for them to<br/>
disclose the truth, that they might hurt someones feelings, and that it is<br/>
up to each family to decide when to disclose that these things are just for<br/>
fun. They just play along w/ cousins, etc. when they are talking about these<br/>
things. anyway, i will go back into &quot;lurk-mode&quot;  again.   grin<br/>

<br/>
I would have to say that Elsie Dinesmore sounds like propaganda -- a book<br/>
designed to tell children how they should feel, rather than how they are<br/>
likely to feel.<br/>
<br/>
I think Little Woman must have been very refreshing when it was published. <br/>
Jo struggles to be good, but she sometimes fails.  Readers can really<br/>
identify with her, rather than feel inferior to her.<br/>
