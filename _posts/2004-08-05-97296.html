<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618771568">Someone left the list and gave this feedback:<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was offered fairly harsh advice when I had not asked for any. I prefer to<br/>
<br/>
be treated with respect.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If anyone&#39;s new to the list and skipped the intro, please go to the <br/>
yahoogroups website and read the policies and description. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/</a><br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re here, too (easier to access):<br/>

<br/>
But two to note are:<br/>
<br/>
2 Expect your beliefs to be challenged. Welcome this as an opportunity to <br/>
critically examine your own ideas. <br/>
<br/>
4. If you have a belief or practice that you don&#39;t want held up to public <br/>
examination, don&#39;t post it to the list. <br/>
<br/>
Whether people ask for advice or not, the purpose of the list is to discuss <br/>
the ideas presented, for the benefit of anyone who might be reading and <br/>
considering what can help unschooling work better.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, the focus of respect on the list is respect for unschooling <br/>
and respect for children.   I know there is a traditional kind of  support <br/>
which is hand-holding and soothing and clucking and tends toward &quot;there there, <br/>
those children will be the death of us, you&#39;re doing a great job, don&#39;t think <br/>
about it anymore.&quot;   It&#39;s not the best sort of &quot;support&quot; for someone who wants <br/>
to get to unschooling and more mindful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
So while I&#39;m sorry when someone has misunderstood, the policies have been <br/>
clearly stated for a long time, and each new member gets an e-mail with links to <br/>
them (if not an e-mail with the rules themselves).  I know school and charge <br/>
card contracts can help people want to ignore details and directions, but if <br/>
individuals are unaware of the purpose of the list, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the fault <br/>
of the moderators.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
