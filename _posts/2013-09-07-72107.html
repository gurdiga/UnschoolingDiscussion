<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138132017"><p>&nbsp;I absolutely love this group, and I am so frustrated with the new format. I have also been unable to search archives (the way we used to on the old site). I realize this is not in your control Sandra, and also slightly off topic. I really have benefitted in the past from searching and reading older posts, which is not working now since the search goes to a normal yahoo search engine. Is there any way to be able to search in the archives anymore?? Hopefully we can celebrate another twelve years!</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-2138132017ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> --- In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div>It seems that with yahoogroups&#39; &quot;improvements,&quot; the &quot;About&quot; page (which is no longer the intro page when you open up here) has lost its links.<div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysLearning/info">http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/AlwaysLearning/info</a></div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m very sorry about that. &nbsp;I don&#39;t seem able to add links, either, so I will add the John Holt link to the one link that&#39;s still working, which does have the description, and links to the info for new members, and about how to post. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Please everyone who wonders even a little bit how this group is intended to work, read at this link: &nbsp;</div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning" style="color:rgb(131, 132, 200);text-decoration:none;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;font-size:13px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning</a></div><div><br></div><div>If yahoo doesn&#39;t ruin it completely, Always Learning will be twelve years old in November, in just a couple of months.</div><div><br></div><div>Sandra</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693102746"><div dir="ltr"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1693102746gmail_extra">Yes I can tell you how to search. Lots of the features of the old format are actually there but hard to find. Some buttons don&#39;t work (yet - I say that hopefully). And some are a bit mislabeled.<br>
<br>The message search function is badly labeled. When you&#39;re on the group site it is at the top of the page. There is a box and on the right it says: &quot;search groups&quot; and next to that says &quot;Search Web.&quot; Put your search term in the box and click on &quot;Search Groups.&quot; That actually searches the messages in that group.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606676563"><html><head></head>Thank you.<div>I got so frustrated I cried one night. &nbsp;I think the messages used to be public and now they&#39;re not (maybe I touched something I shouldn&#39;t have; I&#39;m not sure) and so now there are lots of links on my site that lead to discussions in Always Learning that people won&#39;t be able to see. &nbsp;If they join, they can. &nbsp;And people used to be able to freely join, but whether it&#39;s Yahoo&#39;s fault or whatever I might have fumbled that night, each member needs to be approved now.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Pretty frustrating, after so many years of smooth operation. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>-=-<span class="ygrps-yiv-1606676563Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Hopefully we can celebrate another twelve years!-=-</span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1606676563Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1606676563Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">That would be dreamy!!</span></div><div><br></div><div>Over the years there were favorite places I was so used to I could post and navigate just about in my sleep—AOL unschooling forum, then the wonderful message board that used to be (long ago) at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://Unschooling.com">Unschooling.com</a>. &nbsp;Unschooling.info was solidly great for a few years after that, but things dissolve and change and the fact that this group lasted over 11 years in a stable, accessible way is a marvel, even if it, too, disappears at some point.</div><div><br></div><div>Photobuket changed severely, affecting Just Add Light and Stir, and my personal peace (my smooth routine no longer worked, and options I had disappeared). &nbsp; Today I noticed that the logo was different on Yahoo small business (formerly Geocities, which is where <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://SandraDodd.com">SandraDodd.com</a> resides). &nbsp;If I can&#39;t edit my website the same way anymore that will be a serious problem for me. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So for now, the more stable platform from me is probably this:</div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com</a></div><div><br></div><div>Each entry has a link and then three other &quot;You might also like...&quot; &nbsp;so it&#39;s an easy way to meander here and there among unschooling ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>Sandra</div><div><br></div></html></div>
