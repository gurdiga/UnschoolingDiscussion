<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591152038">Well we are in NC. It is pretty easy to homeschool here. The only requirement is that you have to test once a year, BUT you can give the test yourself (even though they reccommend that someone else gives it, you don&#39;t have to) and you can test at any grade level you want. So you could actually test a 13 year old on a grade one test if you really wanted to. I have an online computer test that I give that is like a game and it meets the requirements because it gives the percentiles etc. in the score.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the country?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know a number of (what I consider to be) unschoolers who have <br/>
homeschooled here in WV fairly happily for years now. <br/>
<br/>
For the plan of instruction that we have to submit, I adapted Carol <br/>
Narigon&#39;s curriculum (I think there&#39;s a link to this from the <br/>
unschooling list, or at least from Sandra Dodd&#39;s site) this year and <br/>
my county BOE people had no comments. <br/>
<br/>
You have to assess annually in WV and send the results to the BOE <br/>
but there are 4 options. We&#39;ve always tested thru WVHEA because that <br/>
has seemed the least invasive to me, and my boys don&#39;t mind them and <br/>
do reasonably well on the tests. You can also test in the ps for <br/>
certain grades, but my bet is no unschoolers do this. Many <br/>
unschoolers here assess via portfolio evaluation, meaning the family <br/>
assembles a selection of the child&#39;s work, selecting items to <br/>
include that will show progress in the 5 subject areas the law <br/>
mentions and indicate what the child has been doing throughout the <br/>
year (include brochures from places visited, listing of videos <br/>
watched, websites visited, etc). (We just printed an article on <br/>
portfolios in the latest WVHEA newsletter, but haven&#39;t got it up on <br/>
the website yet.) The portfolio is evaluated by a certified teacher. <br/>
Selecting the teacher is very important, as you can imagine. <br/>
Personally I know of only one teacher, a homeschool consultant, who <br/>
does evaluations and is unschooler friendly, but I have heard of a <br/>
few others who understand unschooling. If I ever decide to do a <br/>
portfolio (we might this year for my younger son), I will use her; <br/>
she&#39;s become a friend. The 4th assessment option is alternative <br/>
assessment; you and your county BOE agree on a way to evaluate your <br/>
children. I don&#39;t know of any unschoolers who have used this.<br/>
<br/>
That pretty much covers the legal bits that might seem like hurdles <br/>
to any new hser, unschooler or not. I&#39;m not sure what area you&#39;re <br/>
in, but I do see an ad for meer.net on 79 so i&#39;m guessing you might <br/>
be in the Fairmont area. We live SW of Clarksburg, but we found a <br/>
group of  relaxed unschoolers in the Fairmont area so that&#39;s where <br/>
we go once a week. The kids&#39; ages range from 13 (almost 14) to <br/>
infant. There&#39;s usually a balance of organized/planned activities <br/>
with unstructured stuff. The site isn&#39;t the best but they&#39;re working <br/>
on finding a better spot. If you are in the area and are curious to <br/>
meet other homeschoolers/unschoolers, please let me know and I&#39;ll <br/>
give directions. If you&#39;re closer to Morgantown, there is a really <br/>
great group up there, Monongalia Area Homeschoolers Assn. People <br/>
from Fairmont, Preston County and even we have gone to some of their <br/>
activities. You should check out the support group listings at <br/>
www.wvhea.org. This also has info about the law and a bit about how <br/>
to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
I should add that I wish I had considered NC more carefully before <br/>
we moved here from VA a few years ago. I understand that in NC while <br/>
you have to test annually, you don&#39;t report the scores. That&#39;s what <br/>
my friend in NC (met her after we moved) told me anyway. So whatever <br/>
legal threat testing might pose to a NC unschooler seems to be <br/>
without teeth. RE: other states in the area: I am told that WV&#39;s law <br/>
was pretty much copied from OH&#39;s. PA&#39;s law is burdensome but I have <br/>
heard that there are unschoolers living quite happily there (well, <br/>
as happy as anyone can be with PA&#39;s hsing laws). I found VA fairly <br/>
easy to hs in; there are plenty of unschoolers there. The MD <br/>
unschoolers I know use an umbrella school. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know <br/>
much of anything about Kentucky. NHEN (www.nhen.org) should have <br/>
info about its regs and ways to find other hsers there. Also, Ann <br/>
Zeise&#39;s site is good for comparing regs in the various states.<br/>

Carol&#39;s unschooling curriculum and expanded it using the California <br/>
state educational standards&#39; language so it is a little more likely to <br/>
meet with approval, if someone has to submit something to a school <br/>
official. You could also use it as a &quot;suggestion list&quot; to stick <br/>
different activities under educationeze-sounding headings - for <br/>
after-the-fact recordkeeping if you have to turn something in, like a <br/>
portfolio. It is in the files area of the list and called &quot;ACME Academy <br/>
Course of Study....&quot; Here is the link:<br/>

********************************************************************<br/>
Sorry it took me forever to reply to this, I know it&#39;s an older message, but <br/>
we&#39;re in the throes (throws?) of lambing season with 4 orphans I&#39;m bottle <br/>
feeding.  <br/>
<br/>
 I just wanted to say that homeschooling/unschooling in WV is not too bad.  <br/>
It really varies from county to county.  Elkins (Randolph) allows children to <br/>
come part time to school, and if the child enters high school partway through <br/>
they will give credit for homeschooling done.  Other counties (like Upshur, <br/>
Lewis, etc) won&#39;t let children attend sport or music programs, and will give no <br/>
credit for any schooling done at home.  Also, in WV if you are not in school <br/>
(or officially homeschooling) you cannot get your driver&#39;s license until you are <br/>
18.  So, it&#39;s not an option to quit the evaluations when the child reaches <br/>
16, or their driver&#39;s license will not be renewable.  <br/>
<br/>
We have always done the portfolio evaluations, and it&#39;s something the kids <br/>
actually enjoy doing....putting together almost a scrapbook of all the stuff <br/>
they&#39;ve done all year.  We know of 2 licensed teachers who are very friendly to <br/>
homeschoolers/unschoolers and the evaluations are not problem, no pressure.  <br/>
One portfolio evaluator we used was licensed in the states of Louisiana and <br/>
Ohio, and was working on getting her WV certificate.  Our school board had no <br/>
problem but another county&#39;s superintendant had a problem with another evaluation <br/>
done by her.  It just depends a lot on where you live.  <br/>
<br/>
It IS a WONDERFUL place to live, and unschool, especially if nature and the <br/>
outdoors is a big part of your life.  Sort of harder if you&#39;re the symphony, <br/>
museum, theater type of family.  Not a whole lot of those here in Central WV.  <br/>
But if you love appalachian culture, music, folklore, dance, and life, it&#39;s <br/>
heaven.<br/>
