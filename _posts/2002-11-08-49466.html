<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513595877">Gosh is that next week already? We&#39;ll go see it at some point, but Dday at our house is Dec 18th (LOTR) which is a workday for me. Guess I&#39;ll have to be off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818765641">Cool,  Deborah,  I am jealous!   We can&#39;t even do that here.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ll probably end up standing with the masses and usually get turned away the first tries!<br/>
 <br/>
On Sunday our family will be helping with a Pre-Potter Party at our Science Center to get us geared up.  The kids worked on robotics projects the last 3 Saturdays that have Harry Potter as a theme.  My daughter and I built a robotic owl,  my son built the flying car,   pretty fun!!<br/>
 <br/>
We are counting down the days,<br/>
And of course to the Two Towers too!<br/>
 <br/>
Take Care,<br/>
