can for them if we aren&#39;t questioning every move we make and worry so<br/>
much about how our children will turn out ?<br/>
Questioning is what brought me to unschooling. Questioning is what  enabled <br/>
me to have two out of hospital births.<br/>
Questioning is how we learn.<br/>

And if it built character to have disrespect and tough situations doled out <br/>
to you by your parents, then abused kids should be the most prepared for <br/>
difficulties in life.<br/>
We know that the exact opposite is true.<br/>
<br/>
Children that are loved and nurtured deeply are the best prepared to deal <br/>
with life.<br/>
