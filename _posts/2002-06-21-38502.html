 </span></blockquote>My daughter had problems with constipation at that age. One thing that<br/>
helped was to keep her very well hydrated - even getting slightly<br/>
dehydrated made things worse. In the summer, we&#39;d do contsnat<br/>
juice-popsicles, water bottles, homemade snowcones, cool straws,<br/>
anything...She also liked prune baby food, which helped some - maybe now<br/>
you can get it without the starch, which would be better - and I think<br/>
part of the appeal was the teeny tiny jars and a teeny tiny spoon....<br/>
grapes helped, too, and grape juice.<br/>
<br/>
And, not to be gross, but when it got really bad, sometimes it was easily<br/>
to finally poop in a nice warm tub... I&#39;d try it, anyway, usually she&#39;d<br/>
freak out when she realized what was happening, but I&#39;d grab her out<br/>
quick...<br/>
<br/>
We actually landed in the ER for this once, because she was cold and<br/>
clammy and it was scary. After that, I used a laxative (magnesium<br/>
citrate) when it had been too many days - it worked out to maybe once or<br/>
twice a year for two or three years...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270674426">My kids think Cracklin&#39; Oat Bran is a treat and it works quickly.  My son<br/>
has always had this problem so we make sure he gets lots of water and lots<br/>
of fruit.  We avoid dairy products and keep the bananas to a minimum.<br/>
Drinking several glasses of orange juice usually works pretty well for him<br/>
too.  Maybe it is the extra vitamin C?  From what I understand, that&#39;s how<br/>
you tell if you are taking too much vitamin C - you get the runs.<br/>
<br/>
Our last resort is kid&#39;s Senekot.  It&#39;s natural, it tastes like chocolate<br/>
syrup and he doesn&#39;t mind taking it.  Our Dr. had us forcing MoM down his<br/>
throat daily when he was little...that was a horrible experience!  It&#39;s one<br/>
of the experiences that started me looking into &quot;alternatives.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If she&#39;s not used to a high fiber diet, you&#39;ll want to go easy on this to<br/>
begin with. Suddenly introducing a lot of fiber can cause cramps.<br/>
<br/>
Someone told me for diarrheaÂ to do the BRAT diet: bananas, rice, apples and<br/>
tea so for the opposite problem it seems those should be avoided!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lots of people have suggested prune juice (ewww, in my book!)  But how about<br/>
straight prunes?  Some kids don&#39;t like them, but many do.  If she won&#39;t eat<br/>
them, try making brownies, but substitute babyfood prunes for the butter.<br/>
Those always go over well.  (that&#39;s also a good trick for reducing the fat<br/>
in your brownies.  the texture is a little different, but they taste fine.)<br/>

Well, there is the &quot;less invasive&quot; category and then there is...   enema.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If kids had no memories whatsoever of childhood, enemas would be just ideal.<br/>
<br/>
But there is a song about it at our house.  Remember the muppets/Jim Henson <br/>
song they did with little worm puppets or muppets?  The lead part just went <br/>
&quot;manamana&quot; and the backup singers went &quot;Dee deeee dee deedeet&quot;<br/>
&quot;Manamana...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;An enema...&quot; fits just as well.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853911362">baby fleet was our close friend until we found out that our doctors <br/>
remedy was what was causing the constipation.  it took 3 weeks from when <br/>
we stopped giving her apples for the constipation to go away, now she <br/>
can eat bananas and they dont giver her problems, but apples,,, they <br/>
made her poop so hard she had rectal bleeding.<br/>
