<div id="ygrps-yiv-951576532">Ok here goes.  You guys always say you want to discuss &quot;real&quot; situations.<br/>
<br/>
Well, here is a real situation for you that involves a real unschooler who practices real unschooling and mindful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 year old daughter (remember her, the one with the friend issues and the one who has started smoking?) has gotten into some BIG trouble this time.  <br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t go into the details but its big enough to be taken out of my hands if the offended party chooses to go that route.<br/>
<br/>
At this point I feel she is forcing me to restrict her freedom.  Honestly, I don&#39;t know what else to do.  She is deliberately doing things that she *knows* are wrong.  Its not a matter of not knowing or being confused.  She *does* know.  There is no question about it.<br/>
<br/>
Why she is doing this I cannot guess, other than she wants to it in with the people she is hanging out with.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t make much difference who she is hanging out with.  SHE has to be able to draw the line when she knows something is wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem is she doesn&#39;t *want* to say &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
She has freedom, unconditional love, and parents who are involved in her life.  She has been encouraged and supported in every single one of her interests.  Why does she need to &quot;fit in&quot; with this kind of crowd? And in fact, I think she wants to be the ringleader.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone really tell me that they would not step in and set limits on freedom in this situation for their child&#39;s own protection and long term well being?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The reason is what eludes me, but here is what I think is happening.  I think the internal restlessness she feels (maybe its boredom but it seems like more than that) is something that is uncomfortable for her (as it is with most people).<br/>
<br/>
But rather than explore who she is, and become comfortable with herself, she is avoiding it altogether and burying herself in the identity of her &quot;friends&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I was a lot like her when I was her age.  I remember the feelings.  And I did the same thing.  But, I had a positive peer group and that kept me safe until I finally *did* work through my feelings and my identity.  <br/>
<br/>
My plan is to get more positive people into her life but that will take some time.  <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I want her to spend more time with me and her dad and less time with her &quot;friends&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t intend this as a punishment, but I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll see it that way.  I do intend it to be a safety net, and a way for her to proactively work through her feelings with guidance and support.  <br/>

==============<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that *is* her way of exploring who she is--by trying on other kinds of<br/>
identities to see which fit and which don&#39;t. I think it&#39;s a legitimate<br/>
(albeit potentially dangerous) way of figuring out who we want to be. Maybe<br/>
try acknowledging that instead of dismissing it as an escape or easy way<br/>
out. Try talking to her about the different kinds of identities out there<br/>
and the logical extension of those identities. &quot;Rebel&quot; or &quot;bad girl&quot; are two<br/>
very attractive identities in our culture for various reasons. Perhaps try<br/>
to find better ways for her to try out those modes of being.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could buy several different teen magazines, go through them with<br/>
her and help her identify what kinds of people she sees in there and which<br/>
traits she finds attractive. I&#39;m thinking that the more positive ways you<br/>
can interact with her through this the better. Let her think you&#39;re helping<br/>
her figure out and become who she is rather than preventing her from<br/>
becoming who she thinks she wants to be. Know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
Of course it&#39;s tricky. And my girls are still young, so this is all<br/>
hypothetical advice based on what I remember having gone through and what<br/>
might have helped me. My mom pretty much did it all wrong. Don&#39;t make that<br/>
mistake or you might end up pushing her in the exact directions you wish to<br/>
avoid.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
I understand that you think some of her friends are risky.<br/>
<br/>
 From some of your posts earlier this week (?) my perception is that you <br/>
don&#39;t want to allow her to just hang out with friends (or with these <br/>
friends).  I feel that you may have some disapproval issues about <br/>
&quot;hanging out&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe her age is one of those brain reorganization ages when kids don&#39;t <br/>
focus well and may need lots of idle time to &quot;find themselves&quot;.  You and <br/>
she seem to be in conflict about whether hanging out type socializing is <br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t allow her to hang out with her current friends, please try <br/>
to support other hanging out options.  Don&#39;t make the mistake of <br/>
pressuring her to use her time &quot;constructively&quot;.<br/>

I have absolutely no problem with &#39;hanging out&#39;.  What I object to is what they are doing *while* they are hanging out.  <br/>
<br/>
I absolutely agree that kids go through a period of &quot;idle time&quot; and I would never insist on interrupting that to do &quot;constructive&quot; things.<br/>
<br/>
However, &quot;idle time&quot; is not what is happening here.  They aren&#39;t idly hanging out.  They are actively being destructive in a way that hurts themselves and others.  My daughter feels the need to be &quot;busy&quot; with things, so I will help her stay busy by &quot;strewing new things in her path&quot;, but the goal isn&#39;t so much to &quot;do constructive things&quot;.  The goal is just to help her find herself.<br/>

What is it that you think setting limits is going to accomplish?  If she<br/>
isn&#39;t interested in following the limits set by the law, if she isn&#39;t<br/>
interested in doing what she knows is right, if she isn&#39;t interested in<br/>
listening to the people who love her......what is locking her in her room<br/>
going to do?<br/>
<br/>
My bet would be she would just sneak out as soon as you weren&#39;t looking (at<br/>
best) or she would no longer be willing to have a working relationship with<br/>
you (at worst).<br/>

Okay.  I noticed that you were suggesting activities and she was <br/>
shooting down your suggestions.  That, suggested to me that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to take suggestions.  I&#39;m still kind of contrary when my mom <br/>

goal isn&#39;t so much to &quot;do constructive things&quot;.  The goal is just to help<br/>
her find herself.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would imagine that everyone&#39;s circumstances concerning teenagers who seem<br/>
to rebel are different. No two families are alike, and that makes advice<br/>
hard to work into personal situations.<br/>
<br/>
I had a lot of problems with my daughter when she was younger. Mine with her<br/>
were due to depression, divorce and school situations, not to mention family<br/>
that did everything wrong when it came to loving her. Myself included.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, we did find our way and now she&#39;s 18, and for quite awhile, we have had<br/>
a wonderful relationship. I still have people marvel at how she is with me.<br/>
In fact, she&#39;s coming along on our next big homeschool picnic just to hang<br/>
out with me and the other kids. But it wasn&#39;t easy getting here. Just know<br/>
it is possible.<br/>
<br/>
When the problems came at 12 and 13 with her, I was into taking away<br/>
priveleges. Didn&#39;t phase her in the least. Just made her more angry. She was<br/>
never grounded for long but had at one time, everything taken away from her.<br/>
That made her good around the house, just hell on wheels when she was away<br/>
from us.<br/>
<br/>
We went through her sneaking out. (not at our house, at her cousins) She<br/>
hung out with all the wrong kids. We&#39;ve been called by the police to come<br/>
and get her. She&#39;s lied about where she was, who she was with and what she<br/>
was doing. She&#39;s had physical problems of her own because of her actions.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing we were actually &quot;doing&quot; was working at all. So we stopped doing<br/>
anything. She came and went as she pleased while we all calmed down. Then we<br/>
talked. A lot! About how we felt, what we were scared of and what could<br/>
possibly happen. We made a game plan, all 3 of us, as to alternatives in her<br/>
life. Different paths she could take. She was free to chose any one she<br/>
wanted. We made it clear that what we would not allow was for her behavior<br/>
to interfere with the safety of the other people in this house. That we<br/>
still did have a legal responsibility for her because of her age. That there<br/>
were things she did that would cost us our comfort here at home.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on what was going on at the time, we let her know exactly what we<br/>
would do to help and what we wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t do. Then we left it all up<br/>
to her. That was the defining point in her life and our relationship.<br/>
<br/>
She also had told us that as much as she listened to what we had to say, and<br/>
as much as she valued our opionions, she had the need to find out for<br/>
herself. That was her way of learning and finding herself. She learns by<br/>
doing and a lot of the times, it&#39;s the hard way.<br/>
<br/>
So as much as I wished she would have waited to do all sorts of things,<br/>
she&#39;s so much more grounded now than kids her age. I also have to say we<br/>
didn&#39;t freak out over what a lot of kids do. (for this example I&#39;m talking<br/>
school kids) The sex, drugs, drinking and smoking had to not be a major big<br/>
deal in order to be able to talk to her about these things. If I freaked at<br/>
the mention of sex or smoking, then talking about it would be out of the<br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
She still makes choices that I would prefer were different. But it&#39;s not my<br/>
life, it&#39;s hers.<br/>
<br/>
I will also say too that when it came to a matter of safety, we did what we<br/>
could. But even at that, we talked about the choices, what our fears were,<br/>
what could happen to her, and when we would step in and make a decision. We<br/>
did have 3 smaller kids to consider.<br/>
<br/>
We would do things so differently if we had it all over again. But we did<br/>
what we knew at the time. For us it worked out well. We&#39;re not only very<br/>
proud of how far she&#39;s come, and love her dearly, but we also really like<br/>
her a lot!!!<br/>

and just listening? I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not easy to get her to talk. <br/>
You might have to come out and tell her that you&#39;re not going to <br/>
talk/lecture/comment about this situation or her life in general <br/>
until she asks your opinion. Let her think about it, have the option <br/>
to talk to go without judgement, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I say this is because of an experience of mine as a <br/>
teenager. Some other kids were doing something mean to one girl and <br/>
for some reason I told my parents about it and was laughing. I was <br/>
trying to work out how it could be so mean and yet be funny at the <br/>
same time. I also was thinking about telling the girl that she was <br/>
being tricked, so it&#39;s not like all my thoughts were evil, ya know! <br/>
Anywho, my parents jumped all over me and lectured me, never letting <br/>
me get a word in. Needless to say, I never said another word about <br/>
it. If they had tried to have a conversation or just asked me what I <br/>
thought or gave me space to figure out what I thought, it would have <br/>
been great.<br/>
<br/>
So I find myself wondering what your daughter thinks about what she&#39;d <br/>
done. She might be telling you she doesn&#39;t feel guilty and enjoys <br/>
being bad, but there&#39;s a good chance that&#39;s just her arguing with <br/>
you. Can&#39;t count the times I said I didn&#39;t feel bad when I sure did <br/>
inside. I just think there&#39;s a chance that if you aren&#39;t telling her <br/>
she&#39;s being bad, she might turn around and tell you that. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I don&#39;t think you told us what your reaction has been, so <br/>
forgive me for assuming you&#39;ve said something along those lines!<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, Kristen. I can only imagine how scared I would be in <br/>
your place.<br/>

Some of the best conversations I&#39;ve had with Madelyn dd13 have <br/>
started by me reading her things from this list or unschooling.com <br/>
and asking her opinion on what the best advice would be.<br/>
<br/>
This has done at least 2 things for us:<br/>
<br/>
1. allowed us to discuss what-could-be-heated topics in a non-charged <br/>
atmosphere <br/>
2. let her in on exactly what mindful parenting is and what the <br/>
alternative could be<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Guess I&#39;m just trying to give you some ideas for conversation <br/>
starters that might allow you to listen to where your dd is coming <br/>
from and what her perspectives are. . . . . and at the same time let <br/>
her know (without directly telling her) where you are trying to go in <br/>
your relationship with her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I second (or third) the <br/>
&quot;Parent/Teen Breakthrough: the Relationship Approach&quot; <br/>
recommendation - really helped me in my journey to mindful <br/>
parenting.  <br/>

Your story is very encouraging.  I believe in her.  And I believe this will all work out.  I know what you mean about not freaking out.  <br/>
<br/>
We had an incident a year ago that caught me so totally off guard that I *did* freak out.  I think that was the beginning of growing pains for me, realizing that she was becoming her own person *already*.  I wasn&#39;t ready like I was with my son.<br/>

<br/>
  I haven&#39;t read it yet, but the current issue of Time Magazine is about <br/>
  teenager&#39;s brains.<br/>
<br/>
  Funny you should mention the TIME article.  I didn&#39;t get a chance to read it, but I saw it sitting on the desk at work.  If I have time tonight, I&#39;ll read it.<br/>
<br/>
  And yes, I do think its a real possibility that she is &quot;trying on identities&quot;.  In fact, that was my first thought. I am just perplexed that she would feel the need to try on such &quot;dangerous&quot; personalities when we really haven&#39;t given her any reason to.  That was what made me think there might be more to it, like trying to escape oneself.<br/>
<br/>
  I have read about half of the book you recommended (Forgot I actually had a copy!).  I&#39;m coming up with other possibilities for why this might be happening.  I won&#39;t really know though till I talk with her.<br/>
<br/>
  The good news is that she *does* talk to me.  We&#39;ve been working on that for quite awhile now.  I guess we&#39;ll just have to keep at it.<br/>

I could use the suggestion for the teen magazine thing, and maybe go to the teen question and answer section.  We could talk about that too.<br/>

That is a really brilliant suggestion.<br/>

It might not work in the primary situation under discussion but I bet there <br/>
are a few dozen others here who might add that to their options/ideas list for <br/>
next time!<br/>
