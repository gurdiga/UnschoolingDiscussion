<div id="ygrps-yiv-541355369">I&#39;ve read a couple of blurbs about a book, by Stephanie Tolan, about a<br/>
wacky family of creative homeschoolers.  (I think it was a selected as a<br/>
Newbery honor book.  The book is called Surviving the Applewhites.  Has<br/>
anyone read it?  It looks like it&#39;s only available in hardback right now.<br/>

just won a Newbery award.  Some folks didn&#39;t think much of it.  I didn&#39;t see<br/>
any mention of homeschooling in connection with it.  Our library has it on<br/>
order, so I&#39;ll have to wait to see.<br/>

I posted a question about a book about a foster kid living with an<br/>
eccentric homeschooling family, titled Surviving the Applewhites.  It<br/>
was just published this year, I haven&#39;t read it yet but will look for it<br/>
at the library, and I wondered if anyone else had read it.<br/>
