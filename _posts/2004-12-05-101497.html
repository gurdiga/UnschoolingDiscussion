<div id="ygrps-yiv-74333823">Someone sent this to me about information gathered by Yahoo and a way to opt<br/>
out -- Joyce<br/>
<br/>
=====<br/>
Yahoo is now using something called &quot;Web Beacons&quot; to track Yahoo Group users<br/>
around the net and see what you&#39;re doing and where you are going similar to<br/>
cookies. Yahoo is recording every website and every group you visit.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at their updated privacy statement:<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy)">http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy)</a><br/>
<br/>
About half-way down the page, in the section on cookies, you will see a link<br/>
that says web beacons.<br/>
<br/>
Click on the phrase web beacons.<br/>
<br/>
That will bring you to a paragraph entitled &quot;Outside the Yahoo Network.&quot; In<br/>
this section you&#39;ll see a little &quot;click here to opt out&quot; link that will let<br/>
you opt-out of their new method of snooping.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have clicked that link, you are exempted.<br/>
<br/>
Notice the &quot;Success&quot; message on the top of the next page.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful because on that page there is a &quot;Cancel Opt-out&quot; button that, if<br/>
clicked, will *undo* the opt-out.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571278555">Yes, thanks for the info!!<br/>
<br/>
And, along those lines, we recently downloaded for free SpyBot to <br/>
cleanse our computer of Spywares. (We had 29!!)  It came highly <br/>
recommended, and was able to easily remove all except for one, a <br/>
DSO Exploit which keeps popping up every time I run it.  If anyone <br/>
has any insight on this, I sure would appreciate it as I don&#39;t like <br/>
being &#39;spied&#39; on.<br/>
