<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know a little about these CDC folks... these aren&#39;t people who went into<br/>
&gt; medicine to make a profit.  The researchers and statisticians who join the<br/>
&gt; CDC are passionate about solving the world&#39;s diseases.  While some of these<br/>
&gt; folks might be described as bleeding heart liberals, at least they have<br/>
&gt; hearts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And those hearts are often controlled by politics, unfortunately. Their <br/>
history shows (most significantly in the work of AIDs) that they at times <br/>
have little say over what is given priority, and politics plays a strong hand <br/>
in that. I certainly would never trash CDC completely. I believe their work <br/>
is invaluable, but temper it with the knowledge that they are just people. <br/>
Much the same way I feel about the FBI and other governmental bueracracies.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Regarding the homeopathic approach of giving a child camomilla??? I agree<br/>
&gt; with your warning about following that plan... Camomilla is one of the<br/>
&gt; strongest and most commonly known carcinogens.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hadn&#39;t heard that one. Where did you get that information? Let&#39;s not forget <br/>
that many things are carcinogenic used inappropiately or incorrectly, <br/>
including the petrol derivative that aspirin is made from, and ordinary black <br/>
tea.<br/>
Anyone that would give that<br/>

You don&#39;t seem to be familiar with the principle of homeopathy. Firstly, <br/>
chamomilla is the botanical name for Chamomile. Secondly, the principles of <br/>
homeopathy are such that one never receives a substantial dose of ANYTHING. <br/>
From Dana Ulman, MPH, Homeopathy, A-Z:<br/>
Homeopathic medicines are made from various plants, minerals, animals, or <br/>
chemical. Ultimately, every substance on the planet  is a potential medicine, <br/>
and that&#39;s because every substance on the planet is also potentially toxic.<br/>
The way that homeopaths reduce the potential for toxicity and actually <br/>
increase the potential for healing is through a specific pharmaceutical <br/>
process that is unique to homepathy call potentization. Potentization refers <br/>
to a process of sequential dilution with vigorous shaking in between each <br/>
dilution.<br/>
More specifically, the tincture of a plant may be diluted in double distilled <br/>
water (usually in a 1:10 or 1:100 dilution). This mixture is vigorously <br/>
shaken then diluted again 1:10 or 1:100. This process is diluted 3, 6, 12, <br/>
30, 200, 1000, 10,000, 50,000 or more times.<br/>
When a substance is diluted 1:10 six times it is called &quot;6X&quot; potency. When a <br/>
substance is diluted 1:100 six times, it is called a 6C potency.<br/>
