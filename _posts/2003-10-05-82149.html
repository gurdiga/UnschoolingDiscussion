<div id="ygrps-yiv-76379619">&lt;<br/>
I guess you are going to have to clarify what the difference is between <br/>
playing like a 6 or 7 year old and playing like a 3 or 4 year old is. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I wish you&#39;d describe what you mean - because just saying &quot;playing like<br/>
<br/>
3 and 4 year olds&quot; versus like &quot;6 and 7 year olds&quot; does not mean a darn <br/>
thing to me. Honestly.<br/>
<br/>
And - I was also hoping you&#39;d describe what you&#39;ve heard 6 and 7 yo <br/>
unschoolers, in particular, play like?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On giving it more thought, I think part of my origional angst orginated<br/>
from unfair comparisons. When I look at my children, they are &quot;less<br/>
sophisticated&quot; than thier peer counterparts around us. Now, the painful<br/>
irony of it is, this &quot;sophistication&quot; and rapid maturing is one of the<br/>
main things I was hoping to avoid with non-traditional schooling! It<br/>
isnt&#39; the first time I&#39;ve gotten my way about something and wondered if<br/>
it was really what I want...<br/>
<br/>
At 2 my son got his first real hammer. No plastic tools here, we went<br/>
right for the real stuff. This has been complicated when dealing with<br/>
other kids from families who lock away real tools. But my kids know how<br/>
to use them safely and correctly. So, with that context in mind, they <br/>
have &quot;played&quot; in ways that most young toddlers don&#39;t. Now five years<br/>
later, they are still playing that way, and I wonder sometimes why they<br/>
haven&#39;t moved onto &quot;grander&quot; things.<br/>
<br/>
I *think* it was Sandra that answered early on that her 11 year old<br/>
daughter was thought of as mature by others but to her still showed many<br/>
signs of being a young girl. I think that&#39;s kind of where I was picking.<br/>
My kids are not exposed to alot of the older-kid stuff that ps kids<br/>
are... yet those ps kids are who I often compare them too by virtue of<br/>
the fact that they are here every day.It&#39;s wrong, but I fall prey to it.<br/>
They often use grown up activities, like cooking and building and<br/>
creating as their &quot;play&quot; but also play with blocks and dolls...something<br/>
the ps kids no longer do. I hear alot of non-public schooled kids at home<br/>
(no matter the method) reading by now or doing complicated science<br/>
projects. Mine do neither of that. They also, for a large part, turn to<br/>
me for thier entertainment, maybe even increasingly so. I don&#39;t see the<br/>
level of self-motivation that I seem to hear others talk about so much.<br/>
<br/>
So, both because they started playing with &quot;real&quot; things young and<br/>
because they are allowed to still be kids and play with what they want,<br/>
their days look almost exactly like they did 2-3 years ago. Why am I<br/>
worried? Oh who knows? They are fine I guess. I think I just need to be<br/>
assured of that sometimes. I&#39;m surrounded by voices of &quot;they are not&quot;<br/>
much more.<br/>
<br/>
Does that explain it better? Tia in Fl<br/>

and well, her friend said she hadn&#39;t thought about them for a long time.<br/>
They were both 11 and her friend was dressed like a teen. (She has 3 older<br/>
sisters so that&#39;s a factor too.)<br/>
<br/>
Is her friend artificially advanced or is my daughter artificially retarded?<br/>

<br/>
The schooled kids have independence forced on them so they have to go<br/>
through the motions of acting independent. They don&#39;t have a choice. I&#39;d bet<br/>
most of them are scared inside even if they don&#39;t show it or even realize<br/>
it. (It&#39;s a natural feeling for them so they wouldn&#39;t recognize it.)<br/>

How much more &quot;grand&quot; can you get than a real tool?<br/>

But what are they THINKING when they play?  <br/>
The thoughts of a two year old playing with Duplo aren&#39;t the thoughts of an <br/>
adult playing with Duplo, but still it can be defined as &quot;just playing with <br/>
Duplo.&quot;  There is no &quot;just&quot; when it comes to learning.  Learning is learning, and <br/>
it&#39;s real and if it happens joyfully it can last a lifetime.  The short-term <br/>

<br/>
If you leave them alone to play as they will, they will. It is natural. <br/>
It is good. It is what many adults LONG to be able to do, but can&#39;t let <br/>
themselves, anymore.<br/>
<br/>
My 16 yo daughter goes to college where she takes exams and writes <br/>
essays, performs in theater productions (called &#39;plays&#39; &lt;G&gt;) and comes <br/>
home and plays with stuffed animals and American Girl dolls. She plays <br/>
with dolls a whole lot less than she did, even a year ago, but she can <br/>
still do it. How many 16 yo&#39;s are just &quot;beyond it&quot; and can&#39;t even <br/>
manage to play that way anymore - they&#39;ve lost the ability.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen imaginative/dramatic play turn into some incredible creative <br/>
writing and into more &quot;sophisticated&quot; role playing in many unschooled <br/>
kids. I&#39;ve also seen that they often have that mix of mature and <br/>
childlike that Sandra mentioned people notice in Holly. I&#39;ve seen it in <br/>
Holly, too, and in Marty and Kirby and in my own kids and in lots of <br/>
other unschooled kids. These are kids that, as adults, will certainly <br/>
still have that childlikeness - not a bad thing at all - a very <br/>
appealing thing and I think most people would be a whole lot happier in <br/>
their adult lives if they&#39;d been able to retain that childlikeness.<br/>
<br/>
Are they responsible? Yes. Not OVER responsible though - they don&#39;t <br/>
tend to do things just because they &quot;should.&quot; They tend to think about <br/>
things and make conscious decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting how they tend to live more conscious thoughtful lives and <br/>
yet are more able to drop into fantasy easily, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989342384">On NPR radio, a psychological program was on one Sunday evening, <br/>
citing the &quot;fact&quot; that imaginary friends are very normal, and not to <br/>
worry about. The imaginary friends will go away by about age five.<br/>

<br/>
!!!!!!?????<br/>
<br/>
really? LOL then my kids are slow, too, because my almost 11 year old <br/>
boy has &quot;10,000 robots&quot; (who, btw, all get to vote, when we&#39;re <br/>
deciding Rummikubes or Kings in the Corner) and my 9 year old girl has<br/>
robots, too. Enemy robots and friend robots. Always battling things <br/>
out, not infrequently, in the grocery store with LOTS of noise. LOL<br/>

<br/>
This afternoon Keith and I went with Keith&#39;s dad and brother over to the park <br/>
where the kids were playing &quot;ork ball.&quot;  Keith explained the rules and <br/>
strategies.  All three of my kids were playing.  That&#39;s unusual; Kirby doesn&#39;t, <br/>
usually, but a friend of theirs was in from out-of-town college, and likes to <br/>
play, and they were short a player, so Kirby went.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a goofy kind of game.  Strenuous and dangerous, but there&#39;s a <br/>
four-square ball with a wig glued onto it, they all have padded boffers, and you can hit <br/>
the carrier, who has to go to one shoulder or hip before he can get up again, <br/>
and you can just throw down your sword and tackle.  Holly prevented a point <br/>
today by just grabbing their guy by the arm and holding on to him so he <br/>
couldn&#39;t run to get a pass.<br/>
<br/>
The kids playing were 11 to 20 years old.  Keith would have played but he has <br/>
a hurt shoulder.  Now, several of them are upstairs in the library <br/>
recuperating.   The one kid is driving back to Las Cruces, but the others are all <br/>
homeschoolers.  It&#39;s interesting to sit around with them and see how the <br/>
conversation goes from light to entirely serious, back to sweet, over to <br/>
personal/current, back to light...  Just like the conversations of really ineresting, <br/>
intelligent adults.  But they&#39;re kids, definitely, and play with the dogs and tease <br/>
each other about body changes and crushes (not meanly, they&#39;re never mean except <br/>
for Logan, and he wasn&#39;t there today).  <br/>
<br/>
Holly dresses like a teen sometimes.  Sometimes she dresses like a little <br/>
kid, or a hippie from 1969. She wears something appropriate to the activity, in a <br/>
color she feels like wearing, or something to match her new nail polish or s<br/>
omething to match her friend&#39;s outfit.   <br/>
<br/>
School tells kids how to act.  If the teachers don&#39;t sufficiently shame and <br/>
limit them to &quot;acting their age,&quot; the other kids are sure to finish the job.<br/>

make your different stacks, but a friend of mine plays it with just a <br/>
deck of cards.<br/>
<br/>
Fun game, but my kids love rummikubes best of all.<br/>
