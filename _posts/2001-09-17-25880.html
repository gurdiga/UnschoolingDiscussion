<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815703699">I had spoken with Helen and out of respect for her and all she is going<br/>
through with her father I have sat here biting my lip and not taking apart a<br/>
certain party because of lies, blantant, pure, unadultered LIES and<br/>
inuendos.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe I shouldn&#39;t have been silent because then the LIES become truth or<br/>
at least repeated as though they are the truth &quot;people coming from other<br/>
lists to help stir up trouble.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, as was made clear in prior posts but was obviously ignored as<br/>
it didn&#39;t fit the agenda of some folks, Bridget and I have argued<br/>
extensively on that other list.  The difference is that on that &quot;other list&quot;<br/>
people do NOT play tag team nor do they wait for the next opportunity to<br/>
disect something said by the party they are bent out of shape at.<br/>
<br/>
I, the big mean evil person who has the audacity to question the resident<br/>
hero, did not invite Bridget to join the list.  In fact, I wouldn&#39;t invite<br/>
anyone from that list to join this list, never have, never will.  That other<br/>
list is inclusive, not exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
And, just a thought, to repeat as fact unfounded gossip is not the &quot;way to<br/>
create community.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, who will now go back to lurking<br/>

&gt; The way to create community is by writing what is meaninful and useful to<br/>

&gt; how things can be better.  But, in order for this to be the kind of place<br/>
&gt; where unschooling is the topic, we have to stop making targets out of<br/>
