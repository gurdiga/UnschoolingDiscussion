  Are these like Shonen Jump? Do you have a website? Thanks! We are really<br/>
missing the Direct TV. It could be a welcome replacement. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve always loved Japanese culture and cuisine, from<br/>
the time the children were little and we were<br/>
introduced to My neighbor Totoro.<br/>
<br/>
We found out about Kenshin from cartoon network,<br/>
actually, as they were playing the series every<br/>
evening.  It made dinner very exciting around here.<br/>
<br/>
Someone on here mentioned their child reading Kenshin<br/>
graphic novels.  I was thinking, what in the world is<br/>
a graphic novel!?  I checked them out on Amazon,<br/>
though, and they are basically comic books! LOL!  The<br/>
cool thing is that though they are in English, you<br/>
still have to read them back to front like Japanese<br/>
comics.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to a website with lots of info about<br/>
Kenshin and his adventures. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kenshinscans.anxious-anime.com/">http://kenshinscans.anxious-anime.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, do you want links to the DVDs or to the books?<br/>
 The books are available at amazon.com, and the DVDs<br/>
are too, I think.  Cartoon network still plays the<br/>
series on sunday nights at 11pm (ET).<br/>
<br/>
Just google &quot;Kenshin&quot; and you will have almost a<br/>
million web hits.<br/>

Except they&#39;re novels, and not the kinds of scenes or jokes or short-stories <br/>
that form the articles in comic books.  Comic books tend to be a series of <br/>
gags or situations, or a long drawn out confusing soap opera (the super-hero <br/>
comics).    The Japanese things are real stories, well-developed, with plot and <br/>
characters.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right.  I should have said they are *similar* to<br/>
comics in that they are drawn in frames, with the same<br/>
sound effects in bold, and sweat on the brow, and<br/>
written almost entirely in dialog.  Much more detailed<br/>
and developed than a Richie Rich comic book, for sure!<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
I am buying them one at a time, strewing them before<br/>
the 12yo as he indicates he is ready for the next one.<br/>
<br/>
In the past I would have glombed on to the fact that<br/>
he liked the first one and bought the whole series at<br/>
some extravagant price, then been disappointed if he<br/>
had satiated his need for them with the first two.<br/>

at all I never thought to actually go OUT to the<br/>
bookstore to get them.<br/>
<br/>
Kenshin is my hero...he got my son to read! LOL!  You<br/>
have no idea how much fun it was to tell my mom that<br/>
he spent all afternoon reading a book!<br/>

    Thanks so much! The &quot;million websites&quot; is why I asked. LOL! I&#39;ll check<br/>
out amazon too. We don&#39;t have Cartoon Network anymore. :-( I miss it almost<br/>
as much as James. We also miss Knights of the Zodiac and Zoid Fusion (sp).<br/>
If one of us missed on we&#39;d catch the other one up. :-)<br/>
