<div id="ygrps-yiv-690962484">oh yes, I have those same feelings.  Our children also love to see hubby and<br/>
I snuggle and be affectionate.   They get warm and fuzzy and always want to<br/>
join in, so we usually end up piled up on each other..lol.  That was never<br/>
the case with my own parents, they have rooms on opposite ends of the house<br/>
and I&#39;m not sure why they stayed together (maybe didn&#39;t know otherwise).  It<br/>
took quite a long time for me to show affection when I started dating and<br/>
having relationships (unhealthy ones, at that), then I met hubby and started<br/>
a family, somehow it became easier.   I guess I wanted the children to see<br/>
that relationships opposite of the way I did as a child. tammy<br/>

For me, I love my time with the five of us all laying around, out to the<br/>
movies, beach , park ect but my dh and I just had this discussion the other<br/>
day about how refreshed and wonderful we both feel when we spend time alone<br/>
together for a walk even or just a quick night out. It restores my love for<br/>
him which is totally different than that of my children. Dont get me wrong<br/>
my love for my children is immeasurable but just different. I also feel more<br/>
connected to my children when I have taken care of some of my own interests<br/>
and when I have spent alone time with Gary. I think it shows my girls how<br/>
important and lovely a marriage can be. I look at my inlaws who totally just<br/>
live for my dh. They now sleep in seperate beds (have for 20 years) and have<br/>
no real relationship. My dh feels indebted to them and somehow it is so<br/>
difficult for him to leave his mother&#39;s nest because he is leaving her, who<br/>
lives for him. Anyway, I also think that it is equally important to spend<br/>
alone time with each individual child once in awhile too. Kelli<br/>

talk on the phone to a good friend for a couple hours.. those things let me<br/>
come back in with a refreshed outlook. Although I can only be away 2 or 3<br/>
hours before I miss the kids terribly..&lt;bg&gt;<br/>

This post keeps calling me.<br/>
I&#39;ve read it and read it again.<br/>
 <br/>
I can see it, but I can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; it.<br/>
 <br/>
Honest.<br/>
There&#39;s no &quot;me&quot; in there. Some one, maybe Charlotte Gilman called it a <br/>
Chinese closet&#39; - a place that is yours - totally - <br/>
a place & time to grow & nurture the you that is the fundamental of you.<br/>
 <br/>
I walk w/o Brianna.<br/>
I walk our dog.<br/>
I will be going back to the gym - w/o Brianna.<br/>
 <br/>
I need things like that - things that I do totally w/ me and for me.<br/>
 <br/>
But - obviously, this works for you.....<br/>
That&#39;s great:)<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Well this was one recent post that caught my eye. <br/>
 <br/>
If someone were to ask me what I do for myself I would have to answer take<br/>
care of my family. That&#39;s really what I do.<br/>
 <br/>
After seeing that my children have all their needs met, making sure all the<br/>
pets have the same, my husband&#39;s needs and taking care of the house, I have<br/>
no time or energy for anything else. And I can honestly say I have no desire<br/>
to get out with friends or have an interest that is solely my own. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t go out with the girls. Our local homeschool group did a moms night<br/>
out. I never went. I have no desire in the evening to be away from my<br/>
children and my husband. Once in awhile I may take a trip to the grocery<br/>
store or Target without any children but that&#39;s it. My husband and I do<br/>
dinner or a movie alone maybe once or twice at the most in a month. It&#39;s<br/>
actually been about 2 months though since we did that. Everything we pretty<br/>
much do is with our children. Everything I pretty much do is with my<br/>
children. I never do any kind of tupperware or such parties because that<br/>
would take me away from my famliy to be with a bunch of women instead. Not<br/>
my idea of fun. <br/>
 <br/>
The only time I have been away from my children is when I had one and was in<br/>
the hospital, spent the night out briefly 2 Valentines days ago and went to<br/>
Chicago for Oprah with Tara. In 9 years, that&#39;s the extent of my away from<br/>
the children time. I get my grown up talk when my children meet with others<br/>
and I have their moms to talk with. I have this list that gets read when the<br/>
kids are eating or like right now, totally into playing with their hermit<br/>
crabs. I also stay up until 2 a.m. so I have plenty of time then to read the<br/>
news and check out this list or anything else on the web I&#39;m searching for.<br/>
I get an occasional magazine to read once in awhile but mostly the new issue<br/>
is out before I&#39;ve read the old one. I do vedge with my husband and a tv<br/>
show every so often but that&#39;s totally with the children either watching<br/>
with us or coming back and forth to interact. Movies that we only want to<br/>
watch alone are done after midnight on the weekends when the kids for the<br/>
most part are alseep.<br/>
 <br/>
I really am happy with the way things are. If our health holds up, my<br/>
husband and I will have plenty of time when the children won&#39;t want to hang<br/>
around us all the time. We&#39;ll have our alone time then. I see it already<br/>
with Tara. And if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, I would have no regrets at<br/>
all as to how I parent. <br/>
