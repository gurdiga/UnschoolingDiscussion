<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092239294">Dear Tammy,<br/>
 I&#39;m Sarah... the one who recently posted about her dd wanting to become a<br/>
doctor, etc etc etc. Remember me?<br/>
<br/>
We went through the SAME things you mentioned. It was six months to the DAY<br/>
(!) that we de-schooled and I was in a panic. If it hadn&#39;t been for my best<br/>
friend trying this radical thing called UNschooling alongside me, I would&#39;ve<br/>
given in. Some of the things you mentioned made bells ring in my head and<br/>
I&#39;m going to throw them out there for consideration. I&#39;m sure we&#39; ve read<br/>
the same books... Teenage Liberation Handbook, Real Lives, John HOlt<br/>
stuff...<br/>
<br/>
I got the feeling from reading your post that you are still giving your dd<br/>
the impression that *you* hold the strings and yet you don&#39;t realize you&#39;re<br/>
doing it. By purchasing all these goodies (I can&#39;t blame you... I did it<br/>
too), she still senses your control. And she still sits. Now, I don&#39;t think<br/>
you can blame her... she&#39;s just doing what comes naturally.  But as long as<br/>
she feels like these things are around for her to do, *she&#39;s* not in control<br/>
(in her mind, anyway).<br/>
Example: When we took Katie out of kindergarten years ago, I did the school<br/>
at home thing, too... complete with blackboard, desk, textbooks<br/>
:-P It was a fight daily and Katie grew to HATE to read. HATE to... and<br/>
still doesn&#39;t choose to read for pleasure but only for information.  Anyway,<br/>
when I began the unschooling thing around 3rd grade with her, that six<br/>
months was the longest time of my life. Several times I wanted to shake her<br/>
and say, &quot;wake up!! READ THIS GOOD BOOK!&quot;  But I refrained, thanks to my<br/>
friend Lili, who shared this venture with me. ( I often returned the favor,<br/>
BTW). So, at that six month point, Katie came to me one day  and said,<br/>
&quot;remember that Miquan Math we used to do?&quot;<br/>
Yes, I said.<br/>
&quot;well,&quot; says she, &quot;where is it?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Look on my closet shelf, behind the blah blah blah.&quot;<br/>
She went to my closet, got the Miquan and returned to her room closing the<br/>
door behind her. Frantically and happily, I called Lili and told her of the<br/>
events :-). I said to Lili, &quot;well, I gotta get off the phone and go help<br/>
Katie with this math stuff&quot; only to have Lili shout in my ear, &quot;OH NO YOU<br/>
DON&quot;T!!!! You&#39;ll undo all the de-schooling we&#39;ve been through!&quot; Lili was<br/>
right. If I had gone to Katie, I would&#39;ve been taking ownership of it again.<br/>
I know... I know... you&#39;re thinking this is ridiculous. But I don&#39;t think so<br/>
from a child&#39;s perspective, anyway.<br/>
So, I stayed away... sucked on the stub of MY tongue &lt;g&gt; and during that<br/>
first &quot;unschooled&quot; day, she went through 20-some pages of Miquan all by<br/>
herself.  When she had a question, she&#39;d come to me, I&#39;d answer *just* the<br/>
question and nothing more. It&#39;s been like this ever since.  It took time for<br/>
me to adapt to her method of madness.... one subject, intently, for a while<br/>
then off to something completely different.  Then back again...There were<br/>
also lulls of a few weeks where she would not do anything I considered<br/>
educational but since she&#39;s now focused on medicine, she&#39;s stopped doing<br/>
that.<br/>
It just sounds to me like you&#39;re at that same point... where you have to let<br/>
her *completely* take ownership of her education and her goals in life.  So,<br/>
go grab another cup of coffee, *another* good book (try Punished by Rewards<br/>
by Alfie Kohn) and kick back. It&#39;ll happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245064340">Hi Sarah,<br/>
Boy does that sound  good!! To hear somebody else is/was feeling this way. I <br/>
know I have read it all over these message boards, and keep going back to <br/>
make sure I have not missed some vital info. I feel like if I dont sit on my <br/>
hands, gag my mouth and roll into fetal position Im going to explode.So for <br/>
your story, I Thank You!!! How old is your dd now? Is she focused and has she <br/>
spoken with you about the process? Im sorry to drill you but my mind is <br/>
always going a mile a minute. Its all I ever think about. I have also <br/>
reverted to hiding how much time I spend on the computer , because she seems <br/>
to think every time I suggest something, its because somebody on the computer <br/>
told me too. I feel like a thief in the night just waiting for my chance to <br/>
steal some time online. (really its not that bad , but she does comment about <br/>
it alot.) <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again<br/>

      response to Tammy</div>
      <div><br></div><tt>Hi Sarah,<br>Boy does that sound&nbsp; good!! To hear 
      somebody else is/was feeling this way. I <br>know I have read it all over 
      these message boards, and keep going back to <br>make sure I have not 
      missed some vital info. I feel like if I dont sit on my <br>hands, gag my 
      mouth and roll into fetal position Im going to explode.So for <br>your 
      story, I Thank You!!! How old is your dd now? Is she focused and has she 
      <br>spoken with you about the process? Im sorry to drill you but my mind 
      is <br>always going a mile a minute. Its all I ever think about. I have 
      also <br>reverted to hiding how much time I spend on the computer , 
      because she seems <br>to think every time I suggest something, its because 
      somebody on the computer <br>told me too. I feel like a thief in the night 
      just waiting for my chance to <br>steal some time online. (really its not 
      that bad , but she does comment about <br>it alot.) <br><br>Thanks 
      Again<br>Tamie<br></tt><br><br><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a free
