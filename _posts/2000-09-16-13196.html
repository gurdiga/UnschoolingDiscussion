I have been interested in spinning and weaving as well.  Although I would not <br/>
like to give up all modern conveniences and go back t pioneer days, something <br/>
about making and crafting all your belongings appeals to me.  <br/>
<br/>
An acquittance of mine owns a huge farm in western Maryland.  Every year they <br/>
have a folk days event where they have musicians playing folk music as well <br/>
as several crafters.  Last year when we went we saw a black smith and ds was <br/>
able to observe some of steps involved and take home a horse shoe with his <br/>
name engraved on it.  I was very interested watching the spinner and weaver.  <br/>
The items they made were beautiful.  One of the wheels they were using had <br/>
been in the family for over a hundred years. My kids are always really <br/>
interested in handcrafted things, especially those they can help with or do <br/>
on their own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Boy, that sounds like it was a fun outing.  We have lots of renaissance and <br/>
Shakespearean festivals in this part of the country (Western WA/OR).  <br/>
Unfortunately, I never seem to find out a about them when I have <br/>
time/money/transportation/energy.  I went to a small one 15 years ago and <br/>
loved it.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve only gotten better since then.  <br/>
<br/>
I love living museums; places where you can go and watch the museums guides <br/>
living life in that time period.  They are wonderful.  We&#39;ll be moving soon, <br/>
that&#39;s another something to add to my find-in-our-new-home list.  Thanks for <br/>
the reminder!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too.  I would love to be able to do both spinning and weaving.  Now is not the time to expend a lot of energy getting that project going, but sometime when our current projects wind towards completion (or at least are more established) I will work on that.<br/>
