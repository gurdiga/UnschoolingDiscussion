<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010507417">Hello all!  Sorry for the cross posting!        <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       Tis the season for piling in the car and driving 16 hours to another <br/>
country to hang out at a lake for a week with 40 of your closest relatives!  <br/>
Well, for us anyway!  We&#39;re driving from Chicago, thru Detroit, and half way <br/>
thru Ont, Canada to meet up for a reunion and my grandparent&#39;s 50th anniversary.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;ve been anxious about Alex being bored, and have found some things <br/>
that should help, printable games, etc.  ( <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://travelwithkids.about.com/cs/printgames/index.htm)">http://travelwithkids.about.com/cs/printgames/index.htm)</a>  I would appreciate any ideas for tried and true games, <br/>
snacks, whatever you all have done to keep a car full of people happy.  <br/>
<br/>
       Background, it&#39;s me and dh plus my 9 year old son, Alex.  He has the <br/>
whole backseat to himself, well, along with the cooler, pillows, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
       He has a Game Boy Advance, and last year I bought him a new game and <br/>
gave it to him in the car, but this year finances don&#39;t allow for that, too <br/>
bad, because that was great for the whole trip.  <br/>
<br/>
Help!?!<br/>

<br/>
Or, if he has a game he hasn&#39;t beaten yet, you could print off a guide /<br/>
walkthrough (try www.gamefaqs.com) and he could work on that.  Even more<br/>
fun, you can read it to him while he plays.  Whenever I do that I am always<br/>
amazed at the level of detail and all the logic and stuff they have to work<br/>
through.  Sometimes I&#39;m even a bit of a help!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even a game he hasn&#39;t played in a while can be played in a new way following<br/>
someone else&#39;s walkthrough or just concentrating on collecting all the<br/>
&quot;whatever&quot; ... pokemon, heart pieces etc.  There are usually specialized<br/>
guides for those as well at gamefaqs.<br/>

    I&#39;m working on some of these for the SC Conference Raffle.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org/2003conference.html">http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org/2003conference.html</a><br/>
<br/>
    Take a Medium to small cookie sheet. Cover inside with the White contact<br/>
paper. On the back use a large envelope type expanding folder to hold the<br/>
paper game mats, wipe off/or coloring crayon, wipe off markers (put bits of<br/>
magnetic tape on these too), cutout sheets, magnetic words/letter/numbers<br/>
and signs, etc. Attatch the envelope by using magnetic tape. I&#39;ve found that<br/>
two long strips on top and bottum work best. Oh and there&#39;s velcro to keep<br/>
it closed. The wipe off markers can be used for tic tac toe, drawing etc. Oh<br/>
also don&#39;t forget to get some large button magnets for playing peices. A<br/>
piece of felt would be your eraser.<br/>
<br/>
    Book on tape are our best friend on long trips. If everyone doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to listen then take along a tape or CD player and headphones. Sounds like a<br/>
fun trip. :-)<br/>

of the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>
and guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
We have neither ;-(  We have to decide by consensus, hehehe.  <br/>

<br/>
We do it every year, and it&#39;s always lots of fun....<br/>
<br/>
But last year&#39;s car ride wasn&#39;t, so I want to be better prepared this time.  <br/>
