<div id="ygrps-yiv-460695204">I agree with you Joyce,  I find my kids (so far anyway) have picked books<br/>
and movies they are &quot;ready&quot; for.  They also seem to self-regulate what they<br/>
want to see or read, for instance my daughter will simply up and leave if<br/>
the movie we are watching is too much for her...my middle son will tell me<br/>
if a book is too much for him and we&#39;ll stop reading it ...sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
the Hardy Boys he won&#39;t want and then he&#39;ll go ahead and watch something &quot;I&quot;<br/>
think  is scary...which leads us into lots of squealing (mostly me!) and<br/>
snuggling.  I think too as Tia said, a lot of it goes over their heads.<br/>
They really are not capable of understanding some of the more adult concepts<br/>
being brought up.  But some of it gets us into many discussions on morality,<br/>
other people&#39;s viewpoints and world events that we may not have entered into<br/>
had we not watched something &quot;age inappropriate&quot;.<br/>
