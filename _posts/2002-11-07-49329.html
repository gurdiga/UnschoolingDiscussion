&lt;&lt; &quot;We aren&#39;t Christian that much&quot;.   The neighbor kid yelled, &quot;WELL, <br/>
 IT&#39;S ALL TRUE, AND YOU&#39;RE GOING TO HELL IF YOU DON&#39;T BELIEVE IT!&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
 It&#39;s experience, not prejudice. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
The next door neighbor kids (up in WA) told my children they were going to <br/>
hell because we had a small party with music and wine, oooooh!<br/>
Being around an organized support group here that is full of fundamentalist <br/>
homeschoolers has given me an inside view of exactly what they think.<br/>
Now we&#39;re going to hell because my kids watch Harry Potter, play with Yugio <br/>
and Pokemon etc....<br/>
It&#39;s experience with these types that have formed my (and obviously a lot of <br/>
other people here) views.<br/>
I think Mike is not aware of just how insidious and powerful the messages <br/>
they send are. Nor how huge of a group of Christians this is....and they seem <br/>
to represent the Christian mindset to a LOT of people.<br/>
You&#39;re really more of a minority in your views Mike, as am I.  But don&#39;t <br/>
discount what Sandra and others are saying about the Christian religion as a <br/>
whole, cuz it&#39;s true.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My point is, imho, to assert that &quot;The Bible&quot; is the unerring &quot;Word of <br/>
 God&quot; (as some do) -- well, which version? The original manuscripts? All <br/>
 of the original manuscripts?  If not, then which parts, which <br/>
 translations? It gets complicated fast. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YEP! It sure does.<br/>
There were a lot of scrolls left out and I believe many put in that have <br/>
nothing to do with spirituality (the Song of Solomon).<br/>
I disagree that the King James is one of the most inaccurate translations <br/>
though, I&#39;ve got the actual Greek writings and the direct, literal <br/>
translation next to it, and I don&#39;t see any huge errors. Other than that <br/>
stuffy,English wording that is so outdated and hard to understand!! There is <br/>
always stuff lost or mangled with translations, but as far as Bibles go, I <br/>
enjoy the King James due to the poetic feel of it.<br/>
Here&#39;s a cool examply of my Greek text Bible, with the New World translation <br/>
first:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Seeing, therefore, that we are the progeny of God, we ought not to imagine <br/>
that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone, like somthing <br/>
sculptured by the art and contrivance of man.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Literal translation looks something like this:<br/>
&quot;Race therefore existing of the God not we are owing to be opining to gold or <br/>
to silver or to stone, to  sculptured (thing) of art and of contrivance of <br/>
man, the divine being to be like.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ugh. Can you imagine trying to make heads and tails of THAT!<br/>
So there is a lot of room for different groups of people to read their own <br/>
meaning into these writings BEFORE it even gets to our hands.<br/>
And then everyone interprets it differently. What a mess religion can make of <br/>
the simple things like love!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963157457">I&#39;m not a biblical scholar, but I participate on again off again on a <br/>
list with a number of folks from different faiths who are, and I was <br/>
merely repeating what I had learned there. Once there was a long <br/>
discussion on the translation of one word, and the implications that <br/>
followed. I believe it was the greek word &quot;diakanons&quot; (sp? sorry, too <br/>
early, doesn&#39;t look quite right) which some texts translate as deacon <br/>
and others don&#39;t, and this all went to a discussion as to whether or not <br/>
women being priests was supported in the bible. I find religious history <br/>
and learning about different faiths fascinating. Right now I&#39;m reading a <br/>
lot about the gnostics. good stuff. The recent discovery of what may be <br/>
the ossary (burial box) of James, brother of Jesus, is also interesting. <br/>
Sort of real life Indiana Jones stuff.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
