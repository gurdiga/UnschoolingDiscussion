<br/>
On May 4th, sky watchers in Europe, Africa and parts of Asia can see a <br/>
total lunar eclipse. The full moon will glide through Earth&#39;s shadow and <br/>
turn a lovely shade of sunset-red. The eclipse begins at 18:48 GMT (2:48 <br/>
p.m. EDT) and becomes total at 19:52 GMT (3:52 p.m. EDT).<br/>
<br/>
North Americans won&#39;t be able to see the event--not directly--but they can <br/>
view it over the Internet.  Visit Spaceweather.com for links to live <br/>
webcasts of the eclipse, along with visibility maps and more information.<br/>
