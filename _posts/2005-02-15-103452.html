<div id="ygrps-yiv-476118506">I love having my kids around.  I love it that they are interested<br/>
in all the seemingly little things that go on in our lives.  Today<br/>
we were headed down to the social security office to get our baby<br/>
a #(tax time is near:), and on the way our 8yo dd asked why we had<br/>
to go there.  I told her the baby needs a ss #.  Then she asked if<br/>
she could get one too.  When I told her she had one, she was so <br/>
excited and wanted to what it was(hers personally and why a person<br/>
needed one in general).  I had printed the application off the <br/>
ss website, and in looking for it had discovered some fun facts<br/>
about ss #&#39;s and printed them off for dh and I to read.  We had<br/>
brought that all along w/us so I passed back the printouts for my<br/>
kids to see and incredibly enough, they loved it!  One was the <br/>
history of ss, one was about the most misused ss card in history, <br/>
and then one was about wether or not you can tell where someone<br/>
was born based on their ss #.  All of it dh and I found interesting, <br/>
so I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that the kids did too.  It&#39;s just<br/>
really *fun* to have your kids share your interest in something :)<br/>
It hasn&#39;t gotten old yet, and I&#39;m hoping it never does :) krista</div>
