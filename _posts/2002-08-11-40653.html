 </span></blockquote>Ned bites: Thanks, DeWes. I hope you&#39;re not being sarcastic. I think you<br/>
speak for many people.<br/>
<br/>
The Declaration of Independence tells me that when our government creates<br/>
unnecessary burdens for us, it is not just our right, but our &quot;Duty&quot; to<br/>
change it.  Americans are born with rights. Our rights are not bestowed by<br/>
governments, they are ours by birth. And governments, in this country, are<br/>
created for the purpose of protecting those rights, not to trample them, as<br/>
MA does to all homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
The Declaration says: &quot;...whenever any form of government becomes<br/>
destructive of these Ends [our unalienable rights to life, liberty and the<br/>
pursuit of happiness], it is the Right of the people to alter or to abolish<br/>
it, and to institute new government...&quot; Later on, it says...it is their<br/>
right, their Duty, to throw off such governments that reduce our rights<br/>
under despotism. <br/>
<br/>
The Bryants, as I see it, are trying to answer that call, to begin to change<br/>
things for the better, even though they know how simple (but dishonest) it<br/>
would be to comply with the bad law. Americans put up with bad government<br/>
for a long time, but finally, they had had enough. What say we..? When will<br/>
we have had enough of bad laws, of being treated like naughty unruly<br/>
ignorant children by people who usually don&#39;t know their butt from a<br/>
bicycle, but have bad law behind them.<br/>
<br/>
DeWes does what most people do, but at the risk/cost of violating his/her<br/>
own convictions of right and wrong, honesty and dishonesty. Is it OK for<br/>
homeschoolers to be expected to lie to the state in order to be &quot;approved&quot;<br/>
by a clerk? We can&#39;t blame DeWes or anyone else, but more importantly, we<br/>
should be ashamed of talking about the Bryants as though they are fools for<br/>
not following simple, but stupid and coercive and despotic rules. They are<br/>
being punished for honestly making their convictions, and their<br/>
homeschooling practice known -- even up for ridicule -- by the courts. But<br/>
that shows the court&#39;s lack of enlightenment, not theirs.<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants are heroes. We need thousands of Bryant families. Unfortunately<br/>
there are few such people, but they are the minutemen of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What do we have, if not a few principles? If we stand for nothing, we fall<br/>
for anything.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that we all owe the Bryants a huge debt of gratitude (and<br/>
financial help with legal fees if we can afford to share) for being willing<br/>
and courageous enough to try to make things better for us all.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there&#39;s a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts, Carla Howell. Like<br/>
me, she&#39;s a libertarian and, as you know, the Libertarian Party is 100% in<br/>
favor of Homeschooling. I consider myself a friend of hers (I was the LP<br/>
candidate for Gov of CT in &#39;98) and I know that she will work to eliminate<br/>
any and all restrictions to homeschooling freedoms.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was about to ask this very thing! It&#39;s been kind of baffling to me that<br/>
people would want to discuss something without being able to discuss the<br/>
facts and talk with the people involved. It just seems to me if people<br/>
really were interested in the case they&#39;d *want* to go to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MAhomeschoolers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MAhomeschoolers/</a> to find out what Kim Bryant<br/>
herself had to say. And what the arguments for and against their position<br/>
were. (That list started late in April 2001. For discussion before that<br/>
you&#39;ll need to go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/masshomelearningassoc/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/masshomelearningassoc/)</a><br/>
<br/>
Doing it here we can&#39;t do more than guess and speculate. All we could do is<br/>
create something that *we want* the case to have been about and *want* the<br/>
Bryants to have been fighting for and *want* the Bryants themselves to have<br/>
been. Heroes. We want heroes to rally behind.<br/>
<br/>
So I can see how it&#39;s equally baffling to others that the homeschoolers of<br/>
MA have seemingly rejected a hero right here in our very midst.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to have been there. Every time I tuned into the list Kim was trying<br/>
to explain her interpretation of the state constitution and why she was<br/>
right and the state was wrong. There was no hint of &quot;I know you guys don&#39;t<br/>
understand or agree with our tactics, but we think fighting this particular<br/>
battle will help all homeschoolers.&quot; Nope. Just her interpretation of the<br/>
constitution.<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants weren&#39;t Minute Men. The Minute Men were organized groups in a<br/>
town who got together to fight the enemy they all agreed was the enemy. The<br/>
Bryants were off on their own firing their muskets at targets of their own<br/>
choosing. The difference is neither good nor bad, better nor worse. It&#39;s<br/>
just different.<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants appeared to be engaged in a *personal* battle with the state. As<br/>
a *side effect* it could have benefited other homeschoolers. But the battle<br/>
appeared to be *personal*. Which *suggested* that whether it benefited other<br/>
homeschoolers was not was not their primary goal.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was a false appearance. Maybe the Bryants were so deeply into the<br/>
court battle that they couldn&#39;t see the forest for the trees. But we can&#39;t<br/>
judge by other than what we&#39;re given to see. And all we were given was a<br/>
tiny view of the trees the Bryants were most concerned about and no hint<br/>
that they cared about the forest at all.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want it to appear I&#39;m demonizing the Bryants. I don&#39;t think they<br/>
should have fought a different battle than they did or in a different way<br/>
than they did it. They fought a battle they believed in. That&#39;s what they<br/>
should have done! I won&#39;t judge them for what they did because I don&#39;t<br/>
understand what or why they did it. But I won&#39;t participate in pretending<br/>
they were fighting some battle other than what it appeared they were<br/>
fighting just because people want heroes.<br/>
<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.educationalfreedom.com/pages/bryant.html">http://www.educationalfreedom.com/pages/bryant.html</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also Justice for Families (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.justiceforfamilies.com/)">http://www.justiceforfamilies.com/)</a> who<br/>
are fighting abuse by DSS. They were involved with the Bryants during the<br/>
court battles. It started in MA so the above links to the MA site. But<br/>
others are opening up chapters across the US and those are listed at the<br/>
bottom of: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.justiceforfamilies.com/Chapters.htm">http://www.justiceforfamilies.com/Chapters.htm</a> (There&#39;s a Florida<br/>
chapter too!) They have an email list also that the Bryants are apparently<br/>
active on: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/justiceforfamilies">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/justiceforfamilies</a><br/>
<br/>
If people are really interested in getting the laws changed in their state,<br/>
it&#39;s perhaps even better to find your state homeschooling group and get on<br/>
their email list or read their website. Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org">http://www.nhen.org</a> for a list<br/>
of state homeschooling groups. You may have to dig some. It may be your<br/>
state group isn&#39;t interested in some advocacy going on so is ignoring it.<br/>
You&#39;ll need to ask. And perhaps even be the person who starts the advocacy!<br/>

Do you really know anything about this case?  Have you talked to MA hsers and <br/>
what they think about all this?  Have you talked to the Bryants?<br/>
<br/>
Most hsers in MA I know don&#39;t support or appreciate what the Bryants did.  <br/>
What they did didn&#39;t help hsers in MA either.  It may cause problems in the <br/>
future for other hsers there.  <br/>
<br/>
Any hsers I know there think the Bryants are extreme Constitutionalists and <br/>
were willing to put their kids at risk.  <br/>
<br/>
Any list the Bryants are on is dominated by their Constitutionists views (and <br/>
a couple of other posters) and that&#39;s why a second MA hsing list was started <br/>
that doesn&#39;t allow such political discussions.  <br/>
