<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512298819">&lt;&lt; Ok,so I&#39;m still confused,is there supposed to be learning from doing these<br/>
normal everyday things,for example,do you make dinner a math project or what<br/>
learning is going on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t make dinner a math project.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It is tempting to think of unschooling as turning everyday life into a <br/>
nonstop series of &quot;teachable moments,&quot; but that is not unschooling. <br/>
Unschooling is much more natural than that - it is not artificially making <br/>
sure the kids learn something from things like cooking dinner or watching a <br/>
movie. It is often described as &quot;just living life&quot; and &quot;trusting that kids <br/>
will learn,&quot; and that is exactly what it feels like to long-time <br/>
unschoolers. But there is more to it, I think -- an attitude and a basic <br/>
principle.<br/>
<br/>
The attitude is that the impulse to learn is a built-in natural automatic <br/>
instrinsic part of human nature that teachers and schools and, <br/>
unfortunately, parents often interfere with but which can, instead, be <br/>
gently and calmly protected and nurtured by enlightened parents.<br/>
<br/>
The basic principle is that kids don&#39;t have to be taught or bribed or <br/>
threatened to get them to learn, but that they need to be supported and <br/>
engaged and facilitated and helped to learn what they want to learn when <br/>
they want to learn it and how they want to learn it. A corollary is that <br/>
everything counts - you can facilitate learning in any direction they want <br/>
to go, learning anything and everything in any way, and one thing leads to <br/>
another and over years of living a life filled with that kind of support, <br/>
they will learn what they need to learn to live the life they want to live.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the learning that anyone does builds a web of information, like a big <br/>
grid, with each new idea or fact or skill attached inside that learner&#39;s head <br/>
to the things which are like it, which need to go with it, which remind him <br/>
of it, which are the opposite of it.  And the more strands in that web, the <br/>
more quickly the person can access useful information to tie it to the other <br/>
new things being learned every day, all the time.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t  know what our children will need to know in ten or twenty years.  <br/>
We really do not know.<br/>
