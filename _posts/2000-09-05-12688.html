&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi All: especially Valerie and Carollyn:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Having just read Melissa&#39;s e-mail jarred something inside of me... I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>need<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; apologize to all for my hick comments... It was uncalled for and<br/>
&gt; &gt; unnecessary.. If I can&#39;t get my point across without resorting to<br/>
&gt; insulting<br/>
&gt; &gt; people, then I ought to think again about how to reinforce my argument.<br/>
&gt; My<br/>
&gt; &gt; behavior was inappropriate and child like (well that&#39;s PS child<br/>
 </span></blockquote>like)...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I do hope you all accept my apologies... I will continue to disagree on<br/>
&gt; &gt; subject such as spanking, but not to resort to namecalling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

Come to think of it, we&#39;ve had a cooler than average summer here in SW Ohio<br/>
also. Not as cool as yours, apparently, Lynda, but I think we have had very<br/>
few days in the 90&#39;s, which is unusual. I was so busy enjoying not roasting<br/>
slowly that I missed the reasons why!! (Duh!)</div>
