<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018359651">To Leslie, and others whose children have been damaged by schools:<br/>
<br/>
You write: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My feelings on the subject are that he needs<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to heal himself from his long school career which was<br/>
one of ridicule from both teachers as well as<br/>
students, and that I should allow him to progress at<br/>
his own rate.  My gut tells me he needs the closeness<br/>
of the family.  My family tells me I am being too<br/>
protective.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never too late to heal. It takes time. The first step is to take<br/>
children out of the damaging environment. You&#39;ve done that.<br/>
The problem is that the young man has been under the control of, and has<br/>
been the victim of people who saw him as flawed, and not as someone who is<br/>
gifted in his own ways. They wanted to change him to fit their harmful<br/>
oppressive mold. That&#39;s what the government schools do. They are wrong, and<br/>
their attitude has terrible consequences for children.<br/>
<br/>
The young man needs to begin to take control of his own life. He needs to<br/>
feel the power that comes from making one&#39;s own decisions, and choosing<br/>
one&#39;s own activities and goals. My oldest son (32) also learn to play music<br/>
by himself -- very well.  Only after he quit school was he able to do that.<br/>
It is now his profession and his passion.<br/>
<br/>
The main lesson of this egroup, of course, is that school is not only<br/>
damaging in many ways, but it is unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly agree with you. Your son needs to feel as much support as<br/>
possible instead of criticism.<br/>
<br/>
Your family is wrong. Their attitude makes me angry. It is the same as those<br/>
who say, &quot;Life is terrible, so put your kids in school where they&#39;ll learn<br/>
how bad life is and get used to it.&quot;  From what you say, your family wants<br/>
your son to continue to suffer at the hands of people who don&#39;t respect him.<br/>
WOW.<br/>
Unfortunately, families are often the worst people to hang around with.<br/>
<br/>
You have rescued your son from the school; now your job is to protect him<br/>
from your family by all means.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238408399">I think it is hard to balance the tender heart of a<br/>
child with lifes hard lessons.  The thing I have tried<br/>
to do is empower my son or all of my children for that<br/>
matter against those who do not feel as we feel.  Also<br/>
by showing them in my own actions that what people say<br/>
do not effect how I feel about myself and the way I<br/>
respond to people and forgive people who say things<br/>
that are hurtful.  Only we can allow others opinions<br/>
and comments to hurt us.  Unfortunately it has taken<br/>
me 46 years to learn this.  I only hope that I have<br/>
started early with my children so that they will<br/>
always hear this in their heads.  My son, I think,<br/>
still has to learn to forgive those students and<br/>
teachers who persecuted him in order to move forward<br/>
in his own life.  It is the process of healing and<br/>
dealing with life&#39;s hardship where were learn the most<br/>
lessons.  As a parent it is hard to watch this<br/>
process, sometimes we want to rush in and make it all<br/>
better instead of having faith in them and in<br/>
ourselves as parents that if we are patient it will<br/>
all work out.<br/>

&quot;make&quot; our children contend with anything. The best we can do is love and<br/>
protect them as much as we are able.<br/>
<br/>
Children are born with perseverance and all the other &quot;good traits&quot; they<br/>
need to survive. They are taught *not to persevere* whenever someone comes<br/>
along and insists (or ever so sweetly suggests) they stop whatever they&#39;re<br/>
doing and get busy with something *educational*.<br/>

As I was shown clearly today when my son was confronted with a nasty little boy (older at 6 to Shawn&#39;s 3.75 yrs). This boy sneered at Shawn and then stuck out his tongue and gave him a rasberry. I told the boy that that wasn&#39;t nice and how would he feel if someone did that to him. Well, this child obviously has not been taught to show respect to adults and looked me straight in the eye and said with a truly superior tone that no one has ever done it to him. I told him he must have some really nice friends. I then asked Shawn to come away and told him that I did not like the behavior that little boy was showing and that if Shawn was uncomfortable to leave him alone. When I was telling my husband about it this evening (the mom is a firm believer of Ferber and thinks that I may be causing developmental problems with Shawn and Shannon since they sleep with their parents (Shawn with dh and Shannon with me) thereby explaining, in my mind, the yucky behavior of the son) Shawn whispered to me that the boy also called him a &quot;loser&quot;. This is probably the first time Shawn had been called a name, so I asked him how that made him feel and he said bad and then when on to say &quot;I don&#39;t like that boy. I don&#39;t like his behavior. He wasn&#39;t nice at all.&quot; I told him he was right and that if he ever heard someone being mean to someone else it was his job to to tell that person not to be mean to others.<br/>
<br/>
It sucks that we can&#39;t protect our children from ALL the mean and thoughtless people in the world...but homeschooling and unschooling certainly helps!!<br/>
