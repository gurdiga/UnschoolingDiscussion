<div id="ygrps-yiv-81876721">&lt;Anyway the teacher had cards they had to flip when they were bad. They<br/>
went from green, to yellow, to red. My son always ended up on red.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Laura-<br/>
That&#39;s the exact system this school uses!  They call them tickets.  The first thing my da says<br/>
when she comes home from kinderg. is &quot;I stayed on green today.&quot; or &quot;I didn&#39;t stay on green<br/>
today.&quot;  Lately, when her 3 yr old sister does something to annoy her she tells her to &quot;move a<br/>
ticket&quot;.  I&#39;ve told her we don&#39;t have tickets in our home.  you need to tell her kindly what you<br/>
don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 yr old son moved a lot of tickets!  And all because he refused to do his homework.  Who<br/>
could blame him?  It didn&#39;t bother him at all to move tickets.<br/>
<br/>
YYYyou&#39;re right about the labels.  My da is very aware who moves alot of tickets (and it&#39;s<br/>
always the little boys).  It&#39;s sad.  I&#39;ll never make it with her in until June.  I guess we&#39;ll<br/>
be singing, &quot;I&#39;ll be home for Christmas.&quot; . . .<br/>

is so resiliant. I did move him out of that class to a half day class in the <br/>
same school around the last couple mos. of school. I can&#39;t believe what I let <br/>
the principal put me through to move him. I had to say it was so I could work <br/>
with him one on one in the mornings to catch him up.AND I WAS PAYING FOR <br/>
THIS, IT WAS A PRIVATE SCHOOL!!!! I have had some pretty stupid days. I now <br/>
know my guy just can&#39;t sit still long yet. My oldest son was just like this <br/>
and he does fine now. Can you see them making people flip a card at work.<br/>

&lt;&lt; hat&#39;s the exact system this school uses!  They call them tickets &gt;&gt;<br/>
When my now 11 1/2 dd was in kdgn(we took her out after Christmas vacation), <br/>
they also had a system--there was a chart on the blackboard with several <br/>
columns: smiley face, frownie face, squiggly line face, straight line <br/>
face...kids&#39; names started in the smiley face column and if there was any <br/>
infraction of rules, the child had to move his/her name to the next column. <br/>
Kids would get tickets for having their names in the smiley face column and <br/>
at the end of a specified time, they could go &quot;to the ticket store&quot; and buy <br/>
something.    There was a lot of shaming--my dd had to move her name because <br/>
she picked up a piece of paper another child had dropped and handed it to <br/>
her.     she was admonished by the teacher for &quot;messy coloring&quot;--my dh and I <br/>
are both artists and we have never colored in the lines!!!!!    And on and on <br/>
it goes--from the teacher telling the kids that they could not have angry <br/>
feeling in school, only happy ones, to telling them that they couldn&#39;t miss <br/>
their moms...<br/>
 My then 5 yo exhibited many symptoms of childhood stress!!!<br/>
   Anyway, we have been homeschooling for 6 yrs.<br/>

<br/>
I belong to a e-mail loop called &quot;multi-class&quot; something or other...Anyway, <br/>
they were discussing ways to keep the kids quiet during class. One teacher <br/>
recommended punishing the whole row when one child acted up, thus forcing the <br/>
other children to shame the offender. Well, needless to say, my response <br/>
resulted in me getting kicked off the list! They screen the mail before it <br/>
goes out I guess, and the censor didn&#39;t like me asking them to think about <br/>
the shooters at Columbine before they instituted a practice like that. So, as <br/>
I said before, the long term reprocussions are not important. It is just <br/>
another thing to reassure us we are doing the best thing for our kids.<br/>

Bless me!  I am shocked.....sort of....that you should say such a thing...lol!<br/>
Give me the name of this list.  I&#39;ve never been kicked off a list before and it<br/>
sounds like it would be an honor.<br/>
