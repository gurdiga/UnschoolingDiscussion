<div id="ygrps-yiv-497768608">I was looking for one of my favorite British comedians a while ago and <br/>
stumbled across the pc versus mac ads. So when the mention of them came up I <br/>
figured they were running the UK ones in the US. Nope, turns out there is a <br/>
whole different series there. So, for those of you who like a British take <br/>
on things: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/uk/getamac/">http://www.apple.com/uk/getamac/</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55712581">I like David Mitchell and Robert Webb. Their myspace page is filled with <br/>
some of their stuff: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/mitchellandwebb">http://www.myspace.com/mitchellandwebb</a><br/>
<br/>
David Mitchell is on some of the gameshows like QI and Have I got News for <br/>
You as well as a radio gameshow he hosts called Pants on Fire (I think) that <br/>
I heard the other week accidently--I think dinner prep ran late one day and <br/>
the show came on the radio.<br/>
<br/>
But I like their mac ads.<br/>
