<div id="ygrps-yiv-716765001">I&#39;m not even sure how to describe my situation here to ask for help.  But I <br/>
know you all will be able to help me.  <br/>
<br/>
As you know, I fell down the basement stairs a week and a half ago and broke <br/>
my ankle - a plate and 8 screws were required in surgery.  It hurt.  A lot.  <br/>
I was home alone with my three and four year olds at the time.  They were <br/>
happily watching Angelina Ballerina (!) when I decided to take too much stuff <br/>
down the stairs to do laundry.  <br/>
<br/>
After falling and trying, unsuccessfully, to correct the ankle, I called up <br/>
to my boy, Nathan, to bring me the phone.  I was not calm.  In the first few <br/>
minutes, at some conscious level, I knew I had to remain calm.  Nathan first <br/>
didn&#39;t want to look for the phone, I begged him.  Probably loudly.  Then he <br/>
couldn&#39;t find it.  It&#39;s a cordless and I probably moved it.  So I dragged <br/>
myself up, foot suspended, screaming in pain.  I remember screaming moments <br/>
followed by calm moments, chanting to myself to remain calm and get a phone.  <br/>
Sort of like &quot;ok, you can do it, get the phone&quot; repeated several times <br/>
followed by a scream and panting to calm down.  I know I was loud because my <br/>
throat hurt in the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
Nathan did find me my purse with my cell phone in it and I managed to call <br/>
911.  I think I was in shock.  I kept begging them to hurry and the operator <br/>
was trying to calm me down.  They called my neighbors and tried to get my <br/>
husband at work.  I scooted to get my palm pilot, it was chaos.  Paramedics <br/>
broke down the door.  My neighbor came to get the kids, I kept chanting &quot;my <br/>
son is allergic to peanuts,&quot; they took me out.  Nathan asked them not to turn <br/>
the siren on.  I spoke to both my kids when I could, trying to tell them it <br/>
would be ok.  They both got kissed before I was carried out.<br/>
<br/>
OK, that&#39;s what I remember of the fall.  And then they played all day with <br/>
friends.  My parents came and they played with them.  They visited me in the <br/>
hospital.  They were shuttled from house to house on the block, well taken <br/>
care of.  I came home a few days later, Mark&#39;s Mom was here to help out.  We <br/>
hired a nanny who started on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Nathan had a really bad day today.  It&#39;s been raining and cold since I got <br/>
home, so the kids haven&#39;t been playing outside.  They wanted a friend to come <br/>
over to play, so I arranged that.  Julia and Luke played with trains, Nathan <br/>
didn&#39;t want to.  I chatted with Luke&#39;s Mom, Dana (the nanny) supervised the <br/>
kids.  So far, so good.<br/>
<br/>
Then the village people showed up.  Our streets have been torn up and to <br/>
complicate things we have been unable to get in our car in the driveway.  I <br/>
called the village to see if I would be able to get in and they stopped by to <br/>
talk to me about it.<br/>
<br/>
Then another friend came by with her four year old son and the noise level <br/>
increased.  Then my physical therapist arrived.  It was chaos.  Nathan hit <br/>
one of his friends and they left in tears.  Nathan was hysterical and I held <br/>
him for a bit.  The pt was behind schedule and needed me to do the stairs.  <br/>
Eventually Nathan calmed down and I successfully made it down and up the <br/>
outside stairs.  I came back in and he and his friend were at it screaming.  <br/>
His other friend left in tears.  With his Mom.  The therapist left.  The <br/>
nanny announced that she couldn&#39;t work like this and Nathan was still <br/>
hysterical upstairs.  Eventually she calmed down and comforted him.  He slept <br/>
for two hours.<br/>
<br/>
Julia and the nanny went for a walk so Nathan and I could snuggle when he got <br/>
up.  He was completely refreshed and we had a great conversation.  Now I <br/>
understand that Nathan thinks he made me fall.  He thinks he pushed me down <br/>
the stairs.  He thinks the screaming was an awful person with an evil laugh <br/>
in our front yard.  He thinks he causes me pain.  I know it&#39;s normal for a <br/>
four year old to blame himself for things, but I had no idea the extent.  <br/>
<br/>
Aside from talking about it a lot, how can I comfort my son?  I used to yell <br/>
a lot more than I do now, he probably has a two year old memory of my <br/>
yelling.  I do still lose my cool on occasion, so when I yell its because <br/>
I&#39;ve reached my limit on whatever is driving me crazy.  So, he&#39;s interpreted <br/>
my screaming in pain as screaming at him for some horrible thing.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s had a lot of anger at me the past few days - since the Nanny came.  I&#39;m <br/>
right here in the house with them, but I think he feels like I&#39;m passing him <br/>
off on her.  My daughter is doing better in this, but she just peed on my <br/>
bed.  She&#39;s had her temper tantrums.  But she has even fewer words to express <br/>
her fears than my son, really.  In the hospital we talked about how scary it <br/>
all was (my father in law dies in a hospital this past spring) and she said <br/>
&quot;yeah, mommy, you died yesterday, but you are ok now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My poor babies!  <br/>

<br/>
Poor thing!!<br/>
<br/>
And poor mom.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, Marty is 13 and he was blaming himself for my falling.  Because we <br/>
had just been joking on the way to the elevators that he didn&#39;t want to be <br/>
seen with me, and so as part of the whole humorous conversation he got in a <br/>
different elevator.  He thought that if he had been right with me he could <br/>
have caught me and I wouldn&#39;t have fallen.<br/>
<br/>
I had to talk to him a couple of times to convince him it was NOT his fault <br/>
and I didn&#39;t ever think so for a minute.  He thought so for at least fifteen <br/>
hours, though.<br/>
<br/>
So for a four year old, I think telling him the story of your fall now that <br/>
you&#39;re calm would help.  Just telling it like a &quot;when I fell&quot; story.  You <br/>
could tell him how afraid you were, and how you wished you could see the <br/>
phone.  And how sorry you were that your crying was scary to him, but how <br/>
much you were hurting and how afraid YOU were too.  I think if you repeat it <br/>
every couple of days he will start to remember that instead of the version he <br/>
has now in his head, which is filled in with speculation and guessing.<br/>
<br/>
I was traumatized by Kirby&#39;s birth.  I went to a counsellor who specialized <br/>
in women/birth/ACoA stuff, to talk about it.  She said I should talk to Kirby <br/>
about it, even though he was too young to understand, that he would <br/>
understand some of it, and that it would be healing for me.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was about a year old.  He was nursing at naptime, and I was telling him <br/>
the story, lying on the bed with him.  I was crying when I was telling it.  I <br/>
said I was so sorry that when he was first born they had to take him away and <br/>
nurses washed him and measured him and weighed him, but I didn&#39;t get to be <br/>
there right away, and that they gave him to his daddy first, and that his dad <br/>
loved him and held him until I got to be in the room and see him.   <br/>
<br/>
When I mentioned Keith holding him first, Kirby pulled off the breast with <br/>
his mouth open and milk still unswallowed and looked at my face with big <br/>
eyes.   He listened to some more of the story, and he reached over and got my <br/>
hand and kissed it.  <br/>
<br/>
He had never kissed my hand like that.  I lay with him and rubbed his head <br/>
and he fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
I went and called Keith at work and said, &quot;When you had Kirby in the hospital <br/>
room, when he was born, what were you doing before I came in?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said, &quot;Just talking to him.  And kissing his hands and his feet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think going through the story of your fall will help both of you.  All <br/>
three of you.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just the pain killers talking here, but I&#39;m crying while <br/>
reading your post.  It&#39;s exactly what I needed to hear.<br/>
<br/>
I used to tell both my kids their birth stories while nursing and rmember <br/>
those tender moments so well.  I&#39;ve worked on reconstructing my falling story <br/>
and will repeat it to my little buddies as often as they will listen.  Last <br/>
night Nathan was playing with my electric bed while I was in the wheelchair.  <br/>
He looked up, smiled brightly and said &quot;Mommy, I DIDN&quot;T push you down the <br/>
stairs!&quot;  Hopefully some day he will believe it.  <br/>
<br/>
Julia, my three year old, I think I haven&#39;t been talking to enough about the <br/>
fall.  I assume she doesn&#39;t understand, but know that is wrong.  Last year <br/>
Nathan was three on september 11th.  He watched 5 to 1 minutes of the <br/>
coverage before I realized he was WATCHING it.  And he understood and was <br/>
frightened.  Don&#39;t know why i thought Julia didn&#39;t get it except that she is <br/>
so verbal and hasn&#39;t talked about it.  But I think now that she&#39;s just <br/>
internalizing the experience and I want to change the tape in her head too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, all this is to say a big thank you.  I feel more confident that it <br/>
will be all right after some work.<br/>
