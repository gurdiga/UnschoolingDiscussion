Please give me some more ideas for protein snacks that would be fun and interesting for my family of finicky hypoglycemics. They make my brain hurt trying to come up with them. So far the three year old has expanded her culinary choices to cottage cheese, rolled up lunch meat and peanut butter. Everything else I suggest is on her NO list. She once was a happy eater but not presently. It is all good.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t ussually allow any sugar in the house. I know it is difficult to understand but ......... living on the road full time as we do and being at music festivals on a weekly basis exposes her to others ways of eating more. I have much less control over our environment. <br/>
<br/>
The marshmellows were acquired around a fire where kids were roasting and gave her a bag. I do not feel comfortable saying no. I do feel comfortable negotiating with her about having some protein and watching the sugar intake. The fruit snacks are an alternative to the jelly beans, chocolate bars, cotton candy, candy apples, kettle corn yada yada yada that surrounds her little life almost daily. <br/>
<br/>
It is also about learning to handle her hypoglycemia in &quot;her&quot; real world. If I was still homesteading on the acerage her world would be different. I guess I see it as allowing her to learn how to handle it rather than just denying it or saying &quot;nope you can&#39;t have any of that in my home&quot;. I fear she would then just sneak snacks (which she constantly has the oportunity to do with kids coming buy offering her shares). Presently she tells them, no thanks I can&#39;t but I have fruit snacks in the bus.<br/>

My kids like:<br/>
hard-boiled eggs,<br/>
<br/>
tortillas with melted cheese,<br/>
<br/>
tortillas spread with peanut butter and wrapped around a banana (gross!!),<br/>
<br/>
cheese in cubes and toothpicks to eat it with,<br/>
<br/>
peanut butter mixed with cream cheese and eaten with apples.<br/>

chucks of firm tofu with ketchup (rolls eyes here - but they like it) <br/>

I haven&#39;t checked -- but has the current lowcarb/high protein craze given rise to any high protein snack chips? that don&#39;t taste like cardboard and/or contain hydrogenated gunk? might be worth investigating<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please give me some more ideas for protein snacks that would be fun <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I found a recipe recently that we all like.  Protein Popsicles from a <br/>
cookbook by Bill Phillips called Eating For Life.  There are good ideas for other <br/>
protein snacks in the book and I checked it out from the library.<br/>
<br/>
              1 1/2 cups lowfat large curd cottage cheese  <br/>
               1/2 to 1 can of No Fat Evaporated Milk<br/>
              1 Package of No Fat-No Sugar Instant Pudding Mix<br/>
                    (I&#39;ve used Chocolate and the Banana Flavor but they come <br/>
in others)<br/>
<br/>
Blend the cottage cheese and milk in a blender under smooth...45 seconds or <br/>
so. Add the Pudding Mix and freeze in plastic popsicle holders.  They have an <br/>
unusual flavor but my kids, husband and the neighbors eat them as fast as I can <br/>
make them!<br/>
<br/>
I like them best just as pudding so I keep some in the refrigerator not <br/>
frozen when I need a quick protein snack. I&#39;ve found life is just much better <br/>
around here if we all have some protein several times a day...especially  me.<br/>

Don&#39;t suggest it then.  Make it and set it out and eat some in front of her.  <br/>
If it doesn&#39;t go, put it in the fridge.<br/>

Not much different, though.   Some chocolate bars are better than some fruit <br/>

<br/>
There was a list a while back.  I hope someone kept it.  If not we could make <br/>
another and I should put it on a website.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes little quantities of something can make it more attractive to kids <br/>
than a big pile of it (whatever it is).<br/>
<br/>
Some things my kids have liked when they were very young:<br/>
<br/>
the Kirby-designed tuna combo:  pineapple cream cheese and tuna, mixed half <br/>
and half or however you want, on folded over bread.   (Or crackers, or in <br/>
celery, or with a spoon or eaten with a popsicle stick or however your kid might <br/>
like it.)<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s contribution to our family regulars:<br/>
peanut butter and cream cheese sandwiches.<br/>
block cream cheese works best.  Slice it thin, cover one slice of bread with <br/>
peanut butter, the other with honey, put cream cheese slices on.  Sliced green <br/>
seedless grapes make it heavenly and moist enough you might not need a drink <br/>
with it, even.  Slice them in three or four so not every slice has the skin, <br/>
as that&#39;s hard for little kid.<br/>
<br/>
When making pancakes, thin down the last bit and make a few thin enough you <br/>
can put cream cheese and roll them up.  Holly likes strawberry cream cheese in <br/>
buttermilk pancakes.  They&#39;re good hot or cold.<br/>
<br/>
monkey platter (inspired by a visit to the zoo when Marty was two or three):<br/>
<br/>
a tray with pineapple chunks and some or all of whatever else of this you <br/>
have:  <br/>
cut up hot dogs or ham, apple slices or chunks, cheese cubes, string cheese <br/>
strung out smaller, cherries or grapes or watermelon cubes, crackers or tiny <br/>
bread slices (sometimes we make small loaves when I make bread in the winter).  <br/>
Stick a dozen toothpicks in things here or there, and the kids can eat with <br/>
toothpicks.  Good for when you have other kids visiting.  <br/>
<br/>
quesadillas<br/>
flour tortillas, spread refried beans on one, put grated cheese on it, cover <br/>
with another tortilla, put it in a toaster oven or microwave until the cheese <br/>
is melting, cut it up like a pizza, or in little squares.<br/>
<br/>
You can put shredded chicken in it too.<br/>

<br/>
Oooh.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you have any of the plastic &quot;boomerings&quot; from Discovery Toys, you <br/>
can make little popsicles by putting the stuff in an ice tray, and one of those <br/>
rings into each.  Totally easy, washable in the dishwasher.  We have some in <br/>
our freezer with  cranberry juice even at this moment, with my youngest being <br/>
12.  We made them because of babysitting a baby, but we&#39;ve done them every <br/>
summer anyway because they&#39;re easy and small and they&#39;re comfort food for my <br/>
kids.   We always had them when they were little, so they&#39;re always glad to see <br/>
them now.   Apple juice is another regular, but cran-whatever is fun.  And I&#39;m <br/>
thinking of trying those pudding pops with them.<br/>

=========<br/>
<br/>
--cream cheese or peanut butter on celery logs<br/>
--cream cheese sandwiches with cucumber slices, cut out in shapes with a<br/>
large cookie cutter<br/>
--cream cheese rolled in lebanon boloney (sounds gross, but good!)<br/>
--cheese cubes, or cheese cut in shapes with small cookie cutters<br/>
--peanut butter on pretty much anything--apples, crackers, tortillas,<br/>
bagels, rice cakes<br/>
--peanut butter and jelly or cinnamen & sugar/ thin marshmellow fluff (yes,<br/>
sugar but may make her want to eat the peanut butter and you could go light<br/>
on the sugary stuff)<br/>
--cream cheese rolled in tortilla--good with grated carrot<br/>
--nuts<br/>
--trailmix with choc. chips (though my kids invariably just pick out the<br/>
chocolate and leave the rest)<br/>
--chicken sandwiches<br/>
--lunchmeat rolls<br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of snack trays with several choices during the afternoon.<br/>
Sometimes I do these with color themes like green, red or orange. Tooth<br/>
picks and cookie cutters make everything more attractive.<br/>

My  husband&#39;s most popular sandwich creation is the chicken cream cheese <br/>
bagel.  (Sprinkled with a little paprika.)  This is a cold sandwich.  <br/>
The protein to carb ratio would be improved by using a less enormous <br/>
type of bread.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a recipe in the old LLL cookbook that is not a quickie, but REALLY <br/>
good, called Chicken and Walnuts in Pita.  It&#39;s got a cream cheese base, and <br/>
sage, and I should really make some tomorrow.  &lt;g&gt;  Not for little kids, though.  <br/>
Too...  bitter?  fancy?  something my kids didn&#39;t like about it.  But they&#39;re <br/>
pretty.  I&#39;d make them with 1/4 pita and stuff alfalfa sprouts in, and they&#39;d <br/>
stick to the chicken stuff and so not even be messy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821123233">Rosie (13) and I dropped into a little &quot;homeschool shop&quot; - just to see <br/>
what it was like. It is very Christian and not unschoolish. But lots of <br/>
&quot;cute&quot; stuff. Lots of tote bags, for example, with funny/cute <br/>
homeschool sayings on them. None unschooling-friendly - things like, &quot;I <br/>
Love My Teacher-Mom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But - Rosie saw one and called me to look at it - thought it was cool. <br/>
It had a big juicy red apple and said &quot;UNGRADED.&quot; Yeah - that one was <br/>
nice. We nodded at each other happily - thinking it was neat that some <br/>
of these people at least appreciated not having grade levels or giving <br/>
grades!<br/>
<br/>
Except - I turned it over, and on the back it had the same apple design <br/>
and it said, &quot;GRADED.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm - noticed that there was a divider in the bag, and one side was <br/>
for mom/teacher to put already-graded papers and the other side was for <br/>
not-yet-graded papers.<br/>
<br/>
We carefully hung it back on the rack. Silence until we got out the <br/>
door - then we both BURST into laughter - how FAR from that reality - <br/>
&quot;graded versus ungraded&quot; - we are!!!<br/>
