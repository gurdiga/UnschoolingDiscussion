<br/>
I am relatively new to the list--having been lurking for sometime but just<br/>
have to jump into this.  I have one son left at home out of 6 children.<br/>
This was my 40th birthday surprise child.  He still sleeps in our room at<br/>
age 9 1/2, he nursed only to 14 month--broke my heart when he self weaned,<br/>
he toilet trained himself just past his second birthday, has never been in<br/>
public school.  Since our other children were adopted as toddlers & older, I<br/>
was not able to do the strong attachment type parenting of them I wanted to.<br/>
Also due to their multiple special needs they often required more<br/>
therapeutic parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Now, to my situation--we are licensed therapeutic foster parents.  Our<br/>
current placement is a 13 year old boy with borderline mental retardation as<br/>
well as several mental illness diagnosis, he must be in public school.  If I<br/>
allow him some of the freedom of choices that I would like to give, he does<br/>
not know what to do.  An example--food:  my 9 year old will only eat when he<br/>
is hungry and usually makes pretty wise choices about what to eat, balancing<br/>
his diet over the course of several days.  However, the 13 year old will eat<br/>
regardless of hunger and he craves sweets and carbohydrates of all kinds.<br/>
Since he is only 5&#39;4&quot; and already weighs nearly 200 lbs and one of the goals<br/>
of his treatment plan is to learn healthy eating habits, I can not give him<br/>
control of his diet.  I am giving him guidance thru only having healthy<br/>
options for snacks, making meals attractive and healthy, but I still must<br/>
say no when he asks for 3rd or 4th servings or wants a snack immediately<br/>
prior to a meal.  TV and games systems are very much the same deal--the 9<br/>
year old will veg out for several hours occassionally--the 13 year old does<br/>
not know any other way to entertain himself, he has no other interests.<br/>
Therefore, I limit his time in front of a screen and insist that he go<br/>
outside to play.  We will only have this child for a few more months before<br/>
he returns home where he will be very rule bound--I&#39;ve watched his mother in<br/>
action with him and don&#39;t see a lot of changes in that area.  Okay, there<br/>
really is a question here--how can I incorporate the same style of parenting<br/>
with this child and still give his the strong guidance that he needs to<br/>
learn how to make good choices?  I think that this will take more time than<br/>
we have with him--that the best I can hope for is to be able to show him a<br/>
better way to live and help him learn to make the best choices out of what<br/>
he has available.  It does create some conflict when he sees that we do<br/>
treat the 9 year old differently, but remind him that fair does not always<br/>
mean equal--that each child is different and has different needs therefore<br/>
will be treated differently.  Having rules for one child and a more<br/>
principle led life for the other is difficult--not saying that we aren&#39;t<br/>
principle driven for the other child, it&#39;s just that he is not principle<br/>
driven he is rule driven.  Has anyone else had experience in this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

with friends and neighbors who spend a lot of time here which is <br/>
different, obviously.  But it sounds to me like you&#39;re handling the <br/>
situation as best you can under the circumstances.<br/>
If you were going to be adopting him I&#39;d say heavy duty de-coercing <br/>
and unschooling would be the best plan, but that wouldn&#39;t be fair to <br/>
him to get used to that and then have to go back to his rule-bound <br/>
household in such a short time (plus a couple of months probably <br/>
isn&#39;t even long enough *to* de-coerce/deschool anyway).<br/>
I&#39;m curious why he can be with his own mother in a few months but <br/>
not right now...<br/>

<br/>
Give him limited choices.  <br/>
Give him a choice of two things, like you might with a really young child.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my suggestion.<br/>
I learned it from a psychiatrist in the mid 70&#39;s when I was guardian (with my <br/>
first husband) of his brother and sister, whose parents had died separately <br/>
but within just a couple of years.  The boy was ten and almost paralyzed with <br/>
the inability to make decisions.   So we would ask him which of two things he <br/>
wanted, and he worked into decision making that way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Having rules for one child and a more<br/>
<br/>
principle led life for the other is difficult--not saying that we aren&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
principle driven for the other child, it&#39;s just that he is not principle<br/>
<br/>
driven he is rule driven.  Has anyone else had experience in this?-=-<br/>
<br/>
That would be really difficult for foster kids, to be where they&#39;re not <br/>
treated truly like a member of the family, I think.  I hope you help your son <br/>
exercise his freedoms out of the other boy&#39;s line of sight as much as possible.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If we could adopt, or even do long term foster care/guardianship, I would be<br/>
willing to make the changes.  He is in our care while working on family<br/>
issues that made it unsafe for him to remain at home.  Those issues are<br/>
being addressed and it should be safe for him to return home in the few<br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;That would be really difficult for foster kids, to be where they&#39;re not<br/>

son<br/>
exercise his freedoms out of the other boy&#39;s line of sight as much as<br/>
possible&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We try very hard to treat him as if he has always been here and will always<br/>
be here.  We are giving as much freedom as he can handle, but that just does<br/>
not seem to be as much as the younger child can handle.  He is never<br/>
referred to as our foster child in his presence--he is the newest addition<br/>
to our family.  Since our first 5 children were adopted as slightly older<br/>
children most of our friends understand our committment to kids and their<br/>
needs and know that we are likely to have additional family members at any<br/>
given time.  I have hoped that allowing  the younger to excercise his<br/>
freedoms and make his own choices would be the role model for the 13 year<br/>
old (who developmentally is much younger than the 9 yo).  Right now it is<br/>
feeling as if every time I give the older child the freedom to make his<br/>
choices he sabatoges it--it is as if this scares the bejeebbies out of him.<br/>
Even though we are very experienced parents/foster parents, this is the<br/>
first time that I have blended parenting--previous experience was while<br/>
waiting to adopt.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me sound off and giving me additonal things to think<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
