 </span></blockquote>  have you tried the search engine <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.northernlight.com">http://www.northernlight.com</a><br/>
<br/>
  i did a quick search for keywords homeschooling guam and the top <br/>
result is a site <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heptune.com">http://www.heptune.com</a><br/>
<br/>
  their homeschooling FAQ page is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heptune.com/school.html">http://www.heptune.com/school.html</a> <br/>
<br/>
  which also leads to their email address:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:heptune@...">heptune@...</a><br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s a start but they might have a list of support groups or other <br/>
contacts to share!  you might want to poke around some more at <br/>
northernlights too.  good luck!<br/>
