&lt;&lt; So it&#39;s ok for him to have a responsibility to others, but not OK <br/>
for him to have a responsibility to ME?<br/>

&lt;&lt;This is just making me crazy? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t you just read it and think about it a day or two without always coming <br/>
back and seeming to accuse us of something?   No one is trying to hurt you.  <br/>
We&#39;re trying to help.  You seem angry with your children and your husband, <br/>
and <br/>
now you seem angry with us.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will re-read what people have written, knowing that people are <br/>
trying voluntarily to help you have a more peaceful and productive <br/>
relationship <br/>
with your family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really not.  We&#39;ve been unschooling over two years, We haven&#39;t <br/>
done anything remotely like school.  My older son is 18, we consider <br/>
him &quot;graduated&quot; but he chose this computer repair course as a way to <br/>
possible make money in the future.  I ordered this course for my 13 <br/>
year old last month and it has just sat here on the table.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
said anything to him, nothing has happened, there has been no <br/>
disaster, we&#39;ve had no conflict, I was just asking some simple <br/>
what-if type questions about why he possibly hasn&#39;t done anything <br/>
with it yet.  Last night I went to bed feeling really crappy like I <br/>
was a failure, and today I got up realizing that really our <br/>
lives are very pleasant and lovely.  We DON&#39;T argue about chores, or <br/>
anything else.  My kids know they are free to do whatever they want. <br/>
I feel some simple questions about responsibility have gotten blown <br/>
out of proportion.  <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your responses, and am sorry to have troubled you.<br/>
