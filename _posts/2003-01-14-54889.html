<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905033055">So I&#39;m one week into this new way of thinking about life (I can&#39;t <br/>
think about it as school any more) and I have some thoughts and <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve suddenly seen my paradigm shift about how we view our <br/>
own lives! It&#39;s as though I had been trained to think about life one <br/>
way and suddenly I&#39;m seeing it in a  new light.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has an Algebra II class at the local hs. He has decided <br/>
to keep taking it. It destabilized me completely in the fall as he <br/>
failed the first two tests and then bounced back to an A- and B+ <br/>
only to fail another one yseterday. But he&#39;s kept at it. He&#39;s actually <br/>
very good at the mathematics. He just makes little errors in the <br/>
arithmetic. The teacher chuckled at his mathematical orientation <br/>
with all these little errors as his primary weakness. In fact, in <br/>
yesterday&#39;s exam, he got the hardest page of problems all <br/>
correct (the only one in the class) even though he made so many <br/>
little mistakes on the first page that his grade was below 70.<br/>
<br/>
It frustrates me no end. I want him to get the grade to prove that <br/>
he is learning math. isn&#39;t that incredible? I hdan&#39;t realized how <br/>
much I felt this way! Yet if we were using a tutor or he was doing <br/>
Algebra II at home with a video curricula, I wouldn&#39;t even flinch at <br/>
his scores or grades. He woudn&#39;t have any. Instead he&#39;d have <br/>
knowledge of Algebra II. And that would be what we were after.<br/>
<br/>
After this week&#39;s worth of reading this list, I suddenly got it last <br/>
night. I don&#39;t care what grade he gets on his final on Wed. I&#39;m <br/>
convinced he understands as much of the math as he has <br/>
learned. What difference does it all make, really? College? As <br/>
though he can&#39;t prove to a college in other ways that he is a <br/>
worthy candidate?<br/>
<br/>
I was stunned to think that if his errors are in the arithmetic <br/>
mostly (silly mistakes in multiplying or subtracting), isn&#39;t it crazy <br/>
that the students like him end up penalized, instead of shown <br/>
their errors and allowed to improve? Then I started thinking <br/>
about the damage of being graded period. The goal is to sort by <br/>
test abilities and no attention is paid to whether a child can <br/>
regroup and learn a second time or a third time. And these <br/>
grades mark kids for life. They come to evaluate their intelligence <br/>
and aptitude in light of them.<br/>
<br/>
I felt distressed about that grade until I finally faced my real <br/>
feelings. I am still a slave to the grade. It makes me even more <br/>
wary of school for any of them seeing how quickly it changes <br/>
how I see learning and my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your insights that are helping me sort our reality.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a calculus teacher who put mathematics into perspective for me, and <br/>
I still remember it to this day.  He said &quot;Anyone can plug and chug &lt;do <br/>
the arithmetic&gt;, but the real work comes in setting up the problem&quot;.  It <br/>
sounds like your son&#39;s teacher has a similar view.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not the permanent record that follows them for life, as the teachers <br/>
always ominously told us.  It&#39;s the internal shame, or the false pride and <br/>
confidence, or the profound &quot;averageness&quot; that pervades people&#39;s souls when <br/>
they have grades and test scores, whether high or average or low.<br/>
<br/>
And when homeschoolers say (hope, claim) that they will test their kids, but <br/>
they won&#39;t tell the kids the scores and it won&#39;t change their behavior toward <br/>
the child, they find they were wrong and its impossible NOT to have the <br/>
overlay of test scores affect their relationship with their child.     The <br/>
kids will read those scores in their parents&#39; eyes (if they have any <br/>
interpersonal skills at all).  They will feel it in their touch.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my best recommendation about tests:  Avoid them.<br/>
<br/>
