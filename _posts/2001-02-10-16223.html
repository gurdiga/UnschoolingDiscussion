First, I live in a country where guns at not the norm.  In New <br/>
Zealand the ordinary person does not own a gun.  Only those who hunt <br/>
or belong to a gun club have guns - and the person has to be <br/>
licensed. So I have been brought up without guns any way.  I have <br/>
never had a gun in the house, even as a child. A friend did have a <br/>
gun. I was at his home one day when he was showing dh it.  It was not <br/>
loaded and I new this - but it scared me to death.<br/>
<br/>
OK so I do get your point re. toys and cars etc - infact I guess we <br/>
are at more risk just crossing the road..........<br/>
<br/>
But I still dont like guns<br/>
