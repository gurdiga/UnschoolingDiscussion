<div id="ygrps-yiv-790771728">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
This is an open invitation to any homeschool related groups that publish an online newsletter and also to anyone that would like to read these newsletters.<br/>
<br/>
From the site:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is a moderated list is for homeschool support group newsletter editors to post their group&#39;s newsletters for other homeschoolers to read. It is NOT a discussion list.   <br/>
The main purpose of the list is to help each other with our homeschooling newsletters. Hopefully, new &quot;editors&quot; and those &quot;oldies&quot; that are not comfortable with the e-mail versions or delivery of newsletters can learn from this list.   Permission is NOT necessarily given for any of these newsletters to be used, reposted, copied, etc. You must ask permission of the author if you would like to use any of the information.      Think: &quot;Copyright&quot;   If your group would like to give permission to forward or copy whole or parts of it&#39;s newsletter, please indicate in each newsletter listing. All groups are welcome to post. Please feel free to forward the yahoo site for registering with this group. &quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It is suggested that local groups remove personal contact information such as names, phone numbers and email addresess from the newsletters posted to this list.  This is just a precaution, as it is an open list.<br/>
