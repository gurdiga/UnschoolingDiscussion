<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054663395">Hi everyone,<br/>
I am so new to this posting thing but I want to thank you all for the <br/>
feedback.  I think it is probably a wealth of information and could <br/>
be an awesome reference book (gotta love those)but I&#39;m not into it if <br/>
I have to do it that is why I love unschooling LOL......<br/>
Anyway is it only one book or a series of books ?? <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember who that was that wrote about the whole that we do <br/>
to keep our freedom as homeschoolers but I really liked it and <br/>
agreed.  We do have to have everything look nice so we can have our <br/>
freedom to home school.  Hey, @ this point I&#39;m just happy not to be <br/>
bothered.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the feedback<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872578820">Hi Sonya<br/>
<br/>
I think KONOS comes in three volumes, and there is a timeline and <br/>
figures to put on the timeline, which are a separate purchase. If you <br/>
find one at a yard sale, grab it. It&#39;s kind of pricey, if I remember <br/>
rightly. It does have some very clever ideas in it...we made a model <br/>
ear, which you could crawl through. One of the books they recommend, <br/>
when Robby wanted to explore planets, is what gave us the idea of <br/>
putting up a construction paper solar system this past winter, in our <br/>
dining room. <br/>
<br/>
KONOS, with its hands-on emphasis, and Robinson with its &quot;your kids <br/>
are their own best teachers&quot; emphasis, are two methods we&#39;ve had <br/>
floating around this home academy :) that set me up for the ideas <br/>
behind Natural Learning.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, heidiC<br/>
