stronger or something to get family off my back. I don&#39;t get their concerns <br/>
really. When they speak to my dd or hear stories of what she said etc. she <br/>
speaks like and adult at 5. She uses larger words than most kids her age and <br/>
correctly. Why are they so damn concerned?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But I do believe being brought up w/ a parent who had no confidence in me <br/>
makes me the people pleaser that I am. Do as your told ruffle no feathers. I <br/>
did try and fight w/ my mother but she was so dominant I never got my point <br/>
across. She feels differently.<br/>

I really am not sure. . . .I would guess it is more than any one thing or <br/>
person and more of a over the years they have gotten the sense or feeling <br/>
that it is best not to get into it. I think I simply will not tolerate it. . <br/>
. it is a known off limits. . . something I project I guess. But also with my <br/>
family, anything that is deemed unpleasant or uncomfortable is not talked <br/>
about. . . so I would guess that has something to do with it as well.<br/>

The love that you withhold is the pain that you carry - from lifetime<br/>
to lifetime.<br/>
