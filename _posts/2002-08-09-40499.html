<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101500972"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Germany was once considered the epitome of an educated people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To this day, no one dreams of jay walking in Germany, even on an empty<br/>
&gt; street. As I see it, Germans will need many more generations to overcome<br/>
&gt; their unspeakable shame at being such obedient, horrific sheep.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Growing up, I knew a man from Austria who told of the &quot;old (Prussian) army.&quot;<br/>
&gt; There, the motto was, &quot;Let the horse think !&quot;  In other words, &quot;Do what<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re told -- don&#39;t think for yourself !&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know when you might have most recently visited Germany, Ned.<br/>
However, I live in Germany right now, so I&#39;d like to address a couple of<br/>
these statements.  <br/>
<br/>
First, I see people jaywalking regularly.  German culture is much more<br/>
proper and formal than American, but they&#39;re really not *that* uptight!  I<br/>
have also observed that the horrors of the Third Reich are not unspeakable<br/>
to Germans today.  They speak of them, they have created art to represent<br/>
and memoralize them, and they live with the problems of being blamed (still)<br/>
by the world for something they personally had no part in.<br/>
<br/>
Germany has changed since you were growing up, Ned.  That&#39;s a number of<br/>
years ago, now.  I spent several days in the former East Germany and also<br/>
East Berlin this summer.  Can you tell the difference between the West and<br/>
East?  Yes.  By the buildings.  But not by the people.  It&#39;s only been a<br/>
decade.  But the people have changed.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the German school system is still the envy of many a country, if<br/>
not America.  German children attend school only in the mornings, and their<br/>
education includes many things eliminated in American schools: art,<br/>
swimming, music, etc.  The schools here are not perfect, by any means, but<br/>
it&#39;s still a good education.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My purpose was not to create unnecessary fear<br/>
&gt;among our troops, but to point out that the reason school employees treat<br/>
&gt;homeschoolers with disrespect, distrust, disdain and often contempt is that<br/>
&gt;they see us as their enemy...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just for the record, I have encountered very polite, respectful people in<br/>
the schools here.   Furthermore, I don&#39;t think that your above statement<br/>
describes my parents, who have now each dedicated 50 years of their lives to<br/>
public education.  We may disagree on my son&#39;s education, but I know that<br/>
they have made a positive mark on many children&#39;s educations.<br/>
<br/>
You are fully entitled to your opinion, Ned.  However, I personally have<br/>
been offended by some of your sweeping generalities.  I hope that you can be<br/>
open to the idea that very few concepts are as black and white as you are<br/>
painting them.<br/>
