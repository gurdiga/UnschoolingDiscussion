<div id="ygrps-yiv-966285488">My 2 year old is a little Dennis the Menace. You can track her path all <br/>
around the house with the path she leaves behind. Has anyone been able to <br/>
keep up with a little kid like this who has plenty of resources to choose <br/>
from to spread all around? The thing is, it&#39;s not all her stuff. She takes <br/>
things of Sierra&#39;s and Joseph&#39;s without asking and of course never puts any <br/>
of it away and leaves it all for them or me to clean up. Now I understand <br/>
that&#39;s all a part of being 2. I let her play and clean it all up. The thing <br/>
is when she takes things that belong to Joseph and Sierra. They get upset <br/>
and if we put things up so she can&#39;t get it, well neight can Joseph and <br/>
Sierra. Some things they are willing to do that with, like paints and <br/>
pictures they are working on. But the rest of their things we can&#39;t put up. <br/>
It&#39;s getting to the point where they don&#39;t want her playing with their <br/>
things anymore because of the mess she leaves. Usually they have no problem <br/>
with her playing with their stuff. She doesn&#39;t break anything, just strews <br/>
it about and sometimes misplacing things so they can&#39;t find them. Eventually <br/>
we usually do but not always. I explain to them about her age and they <br/>
understand. It&#39;s just not fair for them and as much as I watch her, well she <br/>
gets into many things anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668646265">&lt;G&gt; I have one as well. Well she will be 3 on the 12th of this<br/>
month. <br/>
Now, she is something. {no, I am not partial~ LOL} She has always<br/>
been much more {to say it nicely} active. Wanting to see the ends<br/>
and outs of how everything is put together, much more then her<br/>
sisters ever were. No is not an option.<br/>
When she was a baby I couldn&#39;t keep a diaper on her, ever. Never<br/>
liked clothes either.  Anytime she had a &quot;doodie&quot; diaper she had it<br/>
off and if i didn&#39;t catch it right away I got another fine mess. {I<br/>
kept humor close by} One big mess after another. LOL I thought she<br/>
might want to potty train early because she hated a soiled diaper so<br/>
much then. Nope, she will do it in her own good time. &lt;S&gt; And I have<br/>
to defend that now with others. Except for my husband and I,<br/>
everyone is trying to &quot;encourage&quot; her to potty because her cousin<br/>
Who is 8 months is younger is doing it.  <br/>
Anyway my husband and I learned from the other two, our family does<br/>
best when not pushed in to something. She is getting easier to<br/>
cooperate with as she gets a little older. Her sisters {especially<br/>
the oldest} are learning to make deals with her to make things more<br/>
tolerable. Me relaxing more seems to help. And I have to admit I<br/>
really like they wild spirit she has engrained in herself. :)<br/>

&gt; oh the joys of the two year old. We have one ourselves. We have a 3 month<br/>
old and a ten year old as well. I have found that getting her to help me<br/>
really gets her out of the way of her siblings, especially when Molly (the<br/>
ten year old) needs some space to herself. Sadie (the two year old) loves to<br/>

&gt; &gt; things of Sierra&#39;s and Joseph&#39;s without asking and of course never puts<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; &gt; of it away and leaves it all for them or me to clean up. Now I<br/>
understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; that&#39;s all a part of being 2. I let her play and clean it all up. The<br/>
&gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; is when she takes things that belong to Joseph and Sierra. They get<br/>
upset<br/>
&gt; &gt; and if we put things up so she can&#39;t get it, well neight can Joseph and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sierra. Some things they are willing to do that with, like paints and<br/>
&gt; &gt; pictures they are working on. But the rest of their things we can&#39;t put<br/>
&gt; up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s getting to the point where they don&#39;t want her playing with their<br/>
&gt; &gt; things anymore because of the mess she leaves. Usually they have no<br/>
&gt; problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; with her playing with their stuff. She doesn&#39;t break anything, just<br/>
strews<br/>
&gt; &gt; it about and sometimes misplacing things so they can&#39;t find them.<br/>
&gt; Eventually<br/>
&gt; &gt; we usually do but not always. I explain to them about her age and they<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand. It&#39;s just not fair for them and as much as I watch her, well<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; gets into many things anyway.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have two children my son is 20 mths and my daughter is 2 1/2 but<br/>
&gt; advanced for her age. I am having people ask me why she isn&#39;t in school<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; ask her age all the time. She asks to help me!Help she is into everything<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; cds, baby powder, legos. I am now having her clean up her messes yes.  A<br/>
wet<br/>
&gt; rag and let her wipe up every bit I assisted . I also took a garbage bag<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; picked up her toys and took them away. We asked her 5 times and we always<br/>
&gt; helps her since her brother makes a mess right along with her.  Sometimes<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; it gets out of hand I have her play with one thing at a time.  It helps to<br/>
&gt; have a place for each item. Legos in the bucket, Books, . Small steps one<br/>
&gt; thing at a time so they dont get over welmed. I have also resorted to time<br/>
&gt; out when they both start and it is way out of hand they go to their bed<br/>
&gt; until I get things back in a bit of order. 5 min.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have two children my son is 20 mths and my daughter is 2 1/2<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; advanced for her age. I am having people ask me why she isn&#39;t in<br/>
&gt; school and<br/>
&gt; ask her age all the time. She asks to help me!Help she is into<br/>
&gt; everything to<br/>
&gt; cds, baby powder, legos. I am now having her clean up her messes<br/>
&gt; yes. A wet<br/>
&gt; rag and let her wipe up every bit I assisted . I also took a<br/>
&gt; garbage bag and<br/>
&gt; picked up her toys and took them away. We asked her 5 times and we<br/>
&gt; always<br/>
&gt; helps her since her brother makes a mess right along with her. <br/>
&gt; Sometimes if<br/>
&gt; it gets out of hand I have her play with one thing at a time. It<br/>
&gt; helps to<br/>
&gt; have a place for each item. Legos in the bucket, Books, . Small<br/>
&gt; steps one<br/>
&gt; thing at a time so they dont get over welmed. I have also resorted<br/>
&gt; to time<br/>
&gt; out when they both start and it is way out of hand they go to<br/>
&gt; their bed<br/>
&gt; until I get things back in a bit of order. 5 min.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my youngest (the dervish) was 2, I set aside a corner of our <br/>
upstairs for my oldest and put his Lego table in there, and used a <br/>
baby gate to gate it off. She was quite a terror, and not content <br/>
with just making a mess, but she would wreck anything he built in a <br/>
heartbeat, and would go up and pull big chunks of his hair out or hit <br/>
him with a wood block or bite him or whatever. So it was important <br/>
for him to have a safe space both for himself and for his creations. <br/>
Now that she&#39;s old enough to understand, they play together all the <br/>
time and they trade Lego creations back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
She definitely has challenged the complacency I had when parenting my <br/>
son as a toddler. He would&#39;ve never thought of climbing on the dining <br/>
room table and swinging from the chandelier, like she was doing by 17 <br/>
months old! She&#39;s still a mover and a shaker, but at least the rest <br/>
of us are safe now. My folks tell me that they always wondered if I&#39;d <br/>
get a kid just like me (I was visiting the ER by her age for doing <br/>
things like jumping off walls to see if I could fly).<br/>

entertaining when you are around the uptight folks, and get the<br/>
pleasure of seeing their reactions too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Have fun with her, she&#39;ll be grown before you know it. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL, gotta love that. My littlest one is a nudist as well. We got out <br/>
of the pool the other day, and were walking to the locker room, she <br/>
was slightly behind me. All of a sudden she goes streaking past me <br/>
towards the locker room naked as can be. The swimming suit is in a <br/>
puddle back on the pool deck - obviously no longer necessary! They <br/>
are just too cute at this age.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526876946">happens all the time... reminds me of when I was an adolescent and decided that the spelling of my name was not eccentric enough and had to change it to Kheli to be different. My mom totally supported this idea until I sickened of it a year later. We still laugh about it:) <br/>
