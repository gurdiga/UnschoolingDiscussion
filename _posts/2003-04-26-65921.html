homeschooling!<br/>
<br/>
It was incredible! The workshops were wonderful, and the place was amazing. <br/>
Julian was just 8, and he had always pretty much been around an adult most of <br/>
the time all his life. There, however, he found things he wanted to do, and <br/>
met me at specific times. It was cool, because it felt safe to let him do <br/>
that, and he felt good. He spent one whole afternoon in a kayak, and fell in <br/>
love. Now he has his own, and it&#39;s still a passion.<br/>
<br/>
What a cool conference that was!<br/>

Let&#39;s have a New England Unschooling Conference!<br/>
