 A little humor ...<br/>
<br/>
[Nix, Jody P]  Parallels to the Darwin awards...<br/>
<br/>
In 1994, a New Mexico jury awarded $ 2.9 million U.S. in  damages to<br/>
81-year-old Stella Liebeck who suffered third-degree burns to  her legs,<br/>
groin and buttocks after spilling a cup of McDonald&#39;s coffee on herself.<br/>
<br/>
This case inspired an annual award - The &quot;Stella&quot; Award - for  the most<br/>
frivolous lawsuit in the U.S. The ones listed below are clear candidates.<br/>
All these cases are verging on the outright ridiculous and yet (in the good<br/>
old USA) with the right attorney you could win anything!<br/>
<br/>
1. January 2000: Kathleen Robertson of Austin Texas was awarded  $780,000 by<br/>
a jury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a  toddler who<br/>
was running amuck inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were<br/>
understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little<br/>
brat was Ms. Robertson&#39;s own son.<br/>
<br/>
2. June 1998: A 19 year old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and<br/>
medical expenses when  his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda  Accord.<br/>
Mr. Truman apparently didn&#39;t notice there was someone at the wheel of the<br/>
car, when he was trying to steal his neighbor&#39;s hubcaps.<br/>
<br/>
3. October 1998: A Terrence Dickson of Bristol Pennsylvania was leaving a<br/>
house he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to<br/>
get the garage door to go up, because the automatic door opener was<br/>
malfunctioning. He couldn&#39;t re-enter the house because the door connecting<br/>
the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut.  The family was on<br/>
vacation. Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days. He<br/>
subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found, and a large bag of dry dog food. Mr.<br/>
Dickson sued the homeowner&#39;s insurance claiming the situation caused him<br/>
undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of half a million dollars.<br/>
<br/>
4. October 1999: Jerry Williams  of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, was awarded<br/>
$14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks  by his<br/>
next door neighbor&#39;s beagle. The beagle was on  a chain in it&#39;s owner&#39;s<br/>
fenced-in yard, as was Mr. Williams. The award  was less than sought because<br/>
the jury felt the dog may  have been provoked by Mr. Williams who, at the<br/>
time, was shooting   it repeatedly with a pellet gun.<br/>
<br/>
5. May 2000: A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of<br/>
Lancaster, Pennsylvania $113,500 after she  slipped on a soft drink and<br/>
broke her coccyx. The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson threw it<br/>
at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.<br/>
<br/>
6. December 1997: Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware successfully sued the<br/>
owner of a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom<br/>
window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while<br/>
Ms.Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid<br/>
paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.<br/>
<br/>
7. And just so you know that cooler heads do occasionally prevail: Kenmore<br/>
Inc., the makers of Dorothy Johnson&#39;s microwave, were found not liable for<br/>
the death of Mrs. Johnson&#39;s poodle after she gave it a bath and attempted to<br/>
dry it by putting the poor creature in her microwave  for, &quot;just a few<br/>
minutes, on low.&quot; The case was quickly dismissed.<br/>
