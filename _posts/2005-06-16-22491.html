<div id="ygrps-yiv-957518057">I don&#39;t post very often, but had to share what happened today. We were at the library and my 11 yo son came over to me, stating he was going to sign up for the reading program. I asked him why he wanted to and he said they&#39;d give him prices. He does not read much himself (started reading on his own about a year ago), but is an avid recorded book listener. So, he said that if he listened to his Harry Potter book another time (he&#39;s in the middle of the second time on the same book), he&#39;d be done and could collect the prizes....He&#39;s obviously not going to listen to the books for the reward, but if they&#39;re going to give him rewards for what he&#39;s doing, he&#39;s going to take them, I guess.So he signed up. <br/>
When I asked if my 7 yo daughter wanted to win prizes too she said no, thank you!<br/>
