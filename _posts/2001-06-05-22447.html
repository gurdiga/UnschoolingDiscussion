<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025888572">Many people who have illnesses known as wasting diseases die of malnutrition<br/>
and dehydration.  However the death certificate will read &quot;Cause of death:<br/>
malnutrition and dehydration secondary to [fill in the blank]&quot;  The person<br/>
who reported that as the cause of his death later retracted that statement<br/>
and gave the full explanation.<br/>
<br/>
Reporting the cause of death like he did is the same as saying AIDS patient<br/>
so and so died of pneumonia.  Or saying the victim in a car accident died of<br/>
cerebral hemmorage.  The death certs don&#39;t stop with the first statement,<br/>
they give the immediate and primary causes of death.  The car accident<br/>
victim would read cerebral hemmorage due to blunt force trama/auto accident.<br/>
