<br/>
My 22yo dd did this as her science project in about 1st or 2nd grade. <br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure she put her baby tooth in cherry soda.<br/>
The reaction was that even though the carbonation from the soda<br/>
had dissapated within some given time (2, 4, 6 hours?); a small stream<br/>
of bubbles continued to erupt from the tooth socket indicating that the<br/>
soda was eating away the tooth.  This continued throughout <br/>
the duration of the science fair.  I don&#39;t remember actually seeing<br/>
any considerable sized hole in the tooth, or if any hole was visible<br/>
at all, however, I do remember the bubble stream continuing for some<br/>
time that was not from the carbonation.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if the chemical reaction was from the phosphoric acid,<br/>
the sweetner, or any other additive for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
So cute, she won a ribbon for this project.  Her report stated<br/>
something like &quot;if you eat sweets, little guys will get in your mouth <br/>
at night and eat away your teeth.  These little guys are called plaque&quot;.<br/>
I think she won for being the sole child who did their own science<br/>
project without their parent doing it for them.  (It was her desire to<br/>
enter the science fair in that grade, not a requirement.) <br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; 1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid.<br/>
&gt; Its Ph is 2.8.  It<br/>
&gt; will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then how can it stay in a can for weeks/months/years?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I know it dissolves teeth in a couple of days, we did<br/>
&gt; that one at school... -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly  just lost a tooth.  Maybe she&#39;ll be willing to sacrifice it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems to me that if any of these things were true, we&#39;d all know<br/>
&gt; for sure<br/>
&gt; because it would have dissolved many paper cups, plastic cups,<br/>
&gt; straws...  it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t dissolve aluminum but it would dissolve a steel nail?   It<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; hurt a straw, but it would dissolve a tooth?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve heard &quot;my uncle dissolved a steak&quot; but as with much urban legend,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; always &quot;my cousin&quot; and if traced back it&#39;s &quot;my cousin&#39;s neighbor.&quot;<br/>
