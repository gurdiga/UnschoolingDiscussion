&lt;&lt; Hey, we don&#39;t have a car - by choice! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy my car very much and am thankful for all the places I get to go and <br/>
people I can visit because of it. BUT, we are constantly lamenting the fact <br/>
that most towns in America aren&#39;t very bike friendly.  We saw a picture in <br/>
China and the blurb said most of them in that area use bikes for day to day <br/>
commuting. How cool!! <br/>
I would love to use my bike more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When we lived in Germany we hardly ever used the car.  The biking trails were <br/>
out of traffic and went from home to the grocery to different towns.  We <br/>
easily put my oldest in the bike seat and biked out to eat or to the <br/>
beergarten, to the grocery or bread stand.  Down to the city center to shop <br/>
and eat.  Out to the country to look at the gardens etc.  And he was close to <br/>
base so he biked to work and back.  Loved that.  Here, where I live, there is <br/>
no room on the road for a bike.  I would easily be run over.  No sidewalk and <br/>
sometimes not enough room for two cars to pass by each other.  The store is <br/>
too far away and I have to drive about 40 min to get to the play group.  Just <br/>
couldn&#39;t get around very far without a car here.<br/>

&lt;&lt; For example, if I feel like eating just before bed and do so, then the <br/>
body will not properly digest the food and that can lead to not only weight <br/>
gain, but to digestive problems later on down the road. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I trust my body to tell me what it needs and when it needs it. That&#39;s why all <br/>

Disorders aren&#39;t caused by listening to your body, they&#39;re caused by ignoring <br/>
it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m with you Ren. On most workout days, if I don&#39;t eat before I go to bed, I<br/>
wake up at 1:30 a.m. hungry as heck. I eat so frequently during the day it<br/>
sometimes freaks people out, but if your metabolism is constantly being<br/>
stimulated and you don&#39;t eat big meals, you end up eating small amounts for<br/>
most of the day and right up to bedtime. When I trained for half-ironman to<br/>
ironman distance, I ate in the middle of the night too. If my body wasn&#39;t<br/>
digesting that food, I&#39;m not sure what it was doing with it!<br/>

mouth feels dry. Now I can actually feel it on some sort of cellular level<br/>
long before the thirst reaches my throat. It&#39;s the same thing with food. You<br/>
can tell when you&#39;re low on protein, fat, carbos or various things once you<br/>
start really listening and feeling what your body is telling you.<br/>

Yep, same here!!<br/>
I don&#39;t even THINK about doing half-ironman level, just sprint distance...AND <br/>
I&#39;m not training at all right now really, just barely maintaining a low level <br/>
of fitness, but I still eat all the time.<br/>
My metabolism has always been high, if I work out it&#39;s through the roof.<br/>
I get hungry frequently and like you said, I can cue into whether I need <br/>
protein or carbs or fresh veggies and fruit etc...<br/>
I&#39;m very aware of what my body wants/needs.<br/>
And sometimes it&#39;s that big, gooey, chocolate brownie!!! :)<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  At first I didn&#39;t believe myself. &lt;g&gt;  Sometimes I just want a bowl of <br/>
noodles, or of rice.  And I thought to myself (in the voice of my 9th grade <br/>
health teacher) that I should at least put some vegetables in there, but my <br/>
body said &quot;nah.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I just want vegetables.  Sometimes I have a desire for something <br/>
wet like celery or lettuce.<br/>
<br/>
And my kids are way better at knowing than I am, though Marty seems to want <br/>
pizza more than anyone else! <br/>
