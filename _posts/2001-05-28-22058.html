<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619059279">Bonnie---you can join our club! How long have you been quilting? As you&#39;ll read in my long post on quilting, I&#39;ve only been doing it since December, but love it and don&#39;t want to quit to eat or do much else....even sleep. Late at night after everyone&#39;s gone to bed is the best time---nice and quiet and no one comes to ask me any questions.....<br/>
<br/>
Read a poem the other day...made it into a sign over my new sewing table (which by the way, is actually a workplace desk--the office supply place had a going out of business sale yesterday and I got it &quot;cheep-cheep&quot;--they also thought I was strange when I said it wasn&#39;t for my computer or office, just to sew on. It&#39;s long and I can put my machine on one end and my rotary cutting mat on the other....I guess quilter&#39;s really do look at things a little different, huh?)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the poem--can you see yourselves in it?? My husband thought it was hysterical--he just doesn&#39;t understand!<br/>
<br/>
I am a quilter<br/>
<br/>
The beds are not made, the dishes not done...<br/>
I&#39;m at my machine, sewing up fun!<br/>
My only gardening is Grandmother&#39;s Flower.<br/>
Only TV? Eleanor Burn&#39;s hour.<br/>
As I munch lunch, I read quilt magazines<br/>
Or peruse Country Living for equitable scenes.<br/>
I write quilt poetry, attend quilt guilds and shows,<br/>
Work on my quilt if it rains, shines or snows. <br/>
Only ironing I do is to flatten a square, <br/>
Only cooking I do is chocolate fare.<br/>
Only math that gets done helps me build blocks, <br/>
leaving no time for sorting of socks.<br/>
My stash is on shelves--glorious rainbow display--<br/>
Yards crammed in boxes, bought more today...<br/>
Dinner&#39;s not on. <br/>
Nothing is dusted. <br/>
Husband comes home---<br/>
Quilter is busted!!<br/>

     &gt;P.S.  When typing in www.bookfinder.com,  don&#39;t accidentally put an &quot;s&quot;<br/>
     after<br/>
     &gt;bookifinder (thus creating &quot;bookfinders&quot; ) unless you&#39;re in the mood for <br/>
  a<br/>
<br/>
     &gt;sleazy thrill. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     Thanks, Becky!  Now I can find either books OR sleazy thrills whenever I<br/>
     need &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
     (And since it&#39;s also possible to shop for fabric online, I&#39;m now in hog<br/>
     heaven.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597084738">I love it Terri. My favorite time to quilt is after the little ones have gone to bed too. I have tried to work during the day, but the constant questions mess with my concentration and I make dumb mistakes like sewing the wrong side together. I have a christmas card I saved that has a picture I want to convert to a stained glass quilt. I found this great tape at a quilt show that is much easier to work with than bias tape and can hardly wait to use it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263469899">Dear Quilting Unschoolers and other Fiber Artists:<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link that may be of interest. -<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://quilting.about">http://quilting.about</a><br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there is a relationship between fiber<br/>
arts, or arts and/or craftspersons and the inclination<br/>
of do-it-yourself and unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
My handle was meant to be Bearspaw, but that was<br/>
already taken, hence, Bearspawprint.  I used to belong<br/>
to quilting and weaving lists, they were a lot of fun,<br/>
but took too much time away from actually engaging in<br/>
the activities.  <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of WONDERFUL quilting and weaving sites<br/>
that are easily accessed through most of the search<br/>
engines.  Also, children can easily weave on cardboard<br/>
looms, or even straws, or food-trays! And then there<br/>
are BEADS.  Children love to work with beads.  Pony<br/>
beads are a good size to start with.  Or beads can be<br/>
made from all sort of materials <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve taught quilting in and adult ed. class. And in a<br/>
pre-school!  If anybody needs a few pointers on simple<br/>
ways for kids to start, I&#39;d be happy to help.  (On or<br/>
off list)  I&#39;ve made quilts by hand, on my old treadle<br/>
machine, and on electric machines, but I haven&#39;t<br/>
gotten to it yet on my new  Viking! (A Christmas gift<br/>
from my husband) But I am sorting through my scraps<br/>
and old clothes.  I got into a braided rug kick last<br/>
year. Made 5 about four feet in diameter.<br/>
<br/>
Still.....fiber arts are what I like to indulge myself<br/>
in.  Guiding children in that direction is a way to<br/>
keep it on topic!  Actually in oder to indulge<br/>
oneself, with children all around all the time, you<br/>
HAVE to involve them.  With stories of where the<br/>
little bits of fabric came from, or letting them make<br/>
things too (bags, doll things, puppets, kite tails,<br/>
pockets, presents, decorations, pot holders, the<br/>
possibilities are endless, costumes, things related to<br/>
ethnic origins) The possibilities are endless. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Sharon --<br/>
<br/>
I want to confess that I am actually afraid to take quilting classes.  I&#39;m<br/>
worried that I might make mistakes (gasp!!), and the teacher and other<br/>
students will see my mistakes.  It&#39;s kind of a sad leftover from all those<br/>
years of institutional schooling.<br/>
<br/>
(So, I just stay home and make my mistakes privately.)<br/>

 My dh and I have a pottery studio w/a small gallery.  We will be advising  our (mostly homeschooled) 4H club in the creating of an intergenerational art project w/a nursing home.  It will be a porcelain tile mural comprised of hand made porcelain &quot;quilt squares&quot; depicting shared memories. It will be surrounded by porcelain hands that will represent the 3 or 4 generations working on it.<br/>

<br/>
......the biggest part of any instruction is<br/>
encouragement!  You mentioned that you encouraged the<br/>
non-sewing Moms who wanted to participate in your<br/>
quilting circle.  It is just the same!  There aren&#39;t<br/>
really any mistakes to make, unless you are trying for<br/>
a juried show or a contest or something like that.<br/>
Just new things to try for personalizing your<br/>
creation.<br/>

Don&#39;t quit now!! <br/>

 My sister-in-law in Louisiana says there is a very<br/>
active home(?)schoolers 4H in her community.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never done anything with 4H but have heard good things<br/>
about it.  Do you have informaitonal links that you<br/>
could post or can you briefly tell us more.  As I am<br/>
becoming more hermit-like myself I may not follow<br/>
through, but my child has interests that I&#39;ve seen in<br/>
parades and such with 4H banners (he has a horse,<br/>
goat, rabbits, we have chickens, dogs, cats, etc.) and<br/>
at county fairs (haven&#39;t been myself in years, but<br/>
children have).  Do you have to start your own<br/>
interest group or what?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196960272">Your list of critters are all 4-H project areas.  In larger clubs these are<br/>
usually covered.  You can also start your own interest area.  Contact your<br/>
local ag extension office and ask for the names and numbers of clubs in your<br/>
area.  Then talk to each of them and find out which has the groups you are<br/>
interested in.<br/>
<br/>
And you have lots of options in each project area.  For example, with the<br/>
goats you would have show, breeding and milking/production.<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets have really enjoyed it over the years and really liked showing<br/>
at the local fairs.<br/>
