<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844864135">HI folks,<br/>
<br/>
We are basically a Pagan family.  I do attend a United Methodist Church<br/>
because I get something out of it and the Pastor is Pagan friendly<br/>
(though he&#39;s the only one who knows  my background).  My son is 6 and we<br/>
make it a point to tell him which families are Pagan friendly, because<br/>
some of the families wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with our beliefs.  Our son<br/>
has also pointed out that we are Christian friendly.  I think it&#39;s my<br/>
job to give him information about different religions and beliefs to<br/>
help us all understand each other.  We are part of a basically Christian<br/>
homeschooling group here in upper Michigan.  Only two families knows of<br/>
our Pagan beliefs.<br/>

I know it&#39;s probably just my perception, but this comes across as a very <br/>
difficult existence to me, not having those around you know what your beliefs <br/>
are. Maybe there is no real reason for them to know, as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
We are a Christian family. My daughter&#39;s best friend is Christian also, but <br/>
her mom is Pagan. It never crossed our minds to judge her because of this. We <br/>
recognize that <br/>
not everyone holds our beliefs and we don&#39;t feel it is our place to try to <br/>
change them.<br/>
It is our pleasure to learn more about her belief system.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all have so much to learn from each other. I have also found that <br/>
Pagans and Christians have the important things in common. (Not that I&#39;m an <br/>
expert, and I know that comment will offend some Pagans and Christians, but I <br/>
believe it to be true.)<br/>
<br/>
I applaud you for your efforts in trying to expand minds. I find that knowing <br/>
someone&#39;s religious beliefs, the real beliefs instead of just labels, is <br/>
fundamental to knowing the person. I am so glad I have known Pagans, <br/>
Christians (of many stripes), Jews, Muslims, Black Muslims, atheists, <br/>
agnostics, etc., and hope my children will have the same privilege.<br/>
