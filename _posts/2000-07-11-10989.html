<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714985626">Thank you all so much. After I read everyones posts on<br/>
this matter I sat down and to DS that he was right,<br/>
Daddy could get shot at work. Then explained that<br/>
everybody does things everyday that could cause them<br/>
to get hurt. I gave him senarios like driving, playing<br/>
outside, and just last week DH was chopping down a<br/>
tree with a brand new ax when the head flew off and<br/>
landed in my bil&#39;s knee (DH&#39;s brother). He had to get<br/>
stitches but he will be okay. I also told him that it<br/>
was possible for a terrible storm to come and blow out<br/>
the windows of the house and a tree could fall on the<br/>
house as well. Then I said that any of these things<br/>
could happen, but they probbably won&#39;t. I also gave he<br/>
knows about DH&#39;s vest and has even tried it on and<br/>
worn it around the house. I told him that daddy wears<br/>
the vest to protect him in case he gets shot and told<br/>
him about an officer in our town just last week who<br/>
got shot and went to the hospital and then they sent<br/>
him home that night. His vest saved him. (I didn&#39;t<br/>
tell DS that the officer was also shot in both hands.)<br/>
I also told him that it was good for us to pray that<br/>
we are all kept safe, not just daddy. He said he felt<br/>
a little better after. I think it is something that<br/>
still bothers him but I don&#39;t think that it will<br/>
constantly be in the back of his mind. Thanks again. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Corallyn, Hi-- my dh is a police officer, too.  I<br/>
&gt; have a 5 yo son, and a 3 yo <br/>
&gt; son, and a 10 mo daughter.  For most of my<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s lives, my dh has worked <br/>
&gt; day shift.  Sounds like yours is working 3rd shift<br/>
&gt; now.    Where do you live? <br/>
&gt;  We live in So. Indiana.  You have said that you are<br/>
&gt; very open with him... <br/>
&gt; how much does he know about police work?  Our boys<br/>
&gt; really have not asked much <br/>
&gt; about getting shot.  They have very limited<br/>
&gt; knowledge about guns.  I think <br/>
&gt; our oldest has asked if dh has ever shot anyone, <br/>
&gt; and dh told him that he had <br/>
&gt; not, and hoped that he never has to.  Dh explained<br/>
&gt; that the gun was there to <br/>
&gt; be used only for protection when he was at work.  He<br/>
&gt; keeps the explanations <br/>
&gt; &quot;short and sweet&quot; at this time in their lives.  Then<br/>
&gt; he makes sure that the <br/>
&gt; kids get exposed to the many aspects of police work,<br/>
&gt; such as helping people <br/>
&gt; in different ways.  They enjoy hearing the sirens on<br/>
&gt; the squad car, visiting <br/>
&gt; the station, and wearing old uniform shirts.  Has<br/>
&gt; your son watched much tv <br/>
&gt; where police dramas might be on?  Or does he have<br/>
&gt; friends that have said <br/>
&gt; something to scare him , maybe?  One thing you can<br/>
&gt; do is let your son see the <br/>
&gt; protective vest and maybe even put it on, so he can<br/>
&gt; see how heavy it is.  You <br/>
&gt; can help him see how it is there to protect his<br/>
&gt; daddy , just in case there <br/>
&gt; would ever be a &quot;bad guy&quot; that had a gun.  And then<br/>
&gt; express that most police <br/>
&gt; officers don&#39;t get shot and don&#39;t use their guns<br/>
&gt; very often.  Hopefully he <br/>
&gt; will begin to feel re-assured.  Maybe some library<br/>
&gt; books on police officers <br/>
&gt; could be helpful, as they are light-hearted in<br/>
&gt; nature, and maybe will be <br/>
&gt; helpful in lessening his worries.  Most of all,<br/>
&gt; stress that police officers <br/>
&gt; are there to help people, and that is their main<br/>
&gt; purpose.  Give examples such <br/>
&gt; as helping people if their cars break down, helping<br/>
&gt; people settle arguments, <br/>
&gt; help to find someone who is lost, etc...  Just keep<br/>
&gt; trying to reinforce the <br/>
&gt; other aspects of this line  of work, and keep<br/>
&gt; reassuring him that most <br/>
&gt; officers never have to shoot people, and that most<br/>
&gt; officers never get shot.  <br/>
&gt; I hope this helps a little!  Take care.  ~Karen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-345537445">I am aware of this. I get confronted by people all the<br/>
time on the safety of his job and then inform them<br/>
that they have a better chance of getting shot walking<br/>
down the street than DH does at work. I had concidered<br/>
telling this to DS today but I don&#39;t think he would be<br/>
able to understand or relate to that. When he went to<br/>
bed tonight, I asked him if he felt better about daddy<br/>
to night and he said he did. I also reminded him that<br/>
sometimes bad things happen but that they aren&#39;t<br/>
always as bad as they could be. He recently was<br/>
hospitalised for a snake bite. At the time we let him<br/>
know that he could have lost his whole leg and that he<br/>
was lucky that it was a baby snake. I reminded him of<br/>
this and told him that Heavenly Father is watching out<br/>
for daddy and that He knows DS needs his daddy still<br/>
and that He is protecting him. DS said, &quot;And Jesus<br/>
too?&quot; I asured him that Jesus was protecting daddy as<br/>
well. I think he feels better about it. I expect that<br/>
it will take some time for him to get completely<br/>
comfortable (as completely as can be). But he&#39;s better<br/>
tonight and that is what counts.<br/>
