<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044081251">Hi Sandra!<br/>
 <br/>
Just wanted to put in a second good word for the Australian Blue Heeler. We  <br/>
had Dorothy for 5 years and we got her from a family that was divorcing. Best  <br/>
dog we ever had! <br/>
 <br/>
On another dog note, we now have a Chocolate Lab/German Shepherd who is 5.  <br/>
She had a seizure the other day and scared us all, we thought she was dying!  <br/>
Turns out the retreiver family of dogs is known for having seizure/epilepsy  <br/>
problems. Anyway, she is fine now, the whole thing only lasted a couple of  <br/>
minutes. We have had her since she was 5 weeks old so we are praying that this  is <br/>
one of those once in a very long while things. In the meantime, we have had  <br/>
lots of visits to the vet, but she is worth it. <br/>
 <br/>
One note on training. One of the best ways to train a dog/puppy is to get a  <br/>
leash that you can clip on your belt loop. You keep the dog with you all of <br/>
the  time except when you let them out and crate them at night. After about 3-4 <br/>
weeks  of this you should have a well trained dog that will always stay by <br/>
your side.  Make sure to give commands each time you need to get up or sit down <br/>
and praise  when they obey. I NEVER EVER use hitting or abuse of any kind, not <br/>
even a raised  voice.<br/>
 <br/>
Love reading all of the posts!<br/>
