<div id="ygrps-yiv-809049628">Wish I could help with the two yr. old thing, it is a tuff age.<br/>
One day when Cassidy pushed Nicholas down I just sat her down and told her <br/>
that she is his sister and he loves her. That pushing him will hurt him and <br/>
that hurts his feelings. Yours is a bit young for reasoning. I would guess <br/>
that she is a bit jealous but what can you do? I often had my husband take <br/>
Cassidy some place special.<br/>
<br/>
When Nicholas was nursing I had to sleep with him, he just would not sleep <br/>
without me. When we moved him to his crib I put something that smelled like <br/>
Mommy in there and he was fine after a couple days of reassuring him.  He was <br/>
also an almost 10 pound baby smaller than my daughter at 11-9 and I knew his <br/>
between nursing would be almost like hers so if I wanted sleep they had to <br/>
sleep with me until they where done nursing.  My children, well the last two <br/>
nursed so much I was told they where using me as a pacifier. They where <br/>
content, I got well needed sleep that&#39;s was important.<br/>
Sorry, im going in to this nursing thing and I dont even know if you are <br/>
nursing.<br/>
I will say that when I thought it would never happen it finally did. We where <br/>
at about 6 months when Nicholas went into his crib at night time.<br/>
Dont worry about what every one else does or says they do that&#39;s why we <br/>
Unschool right?<br/>
