<div id="ygrps-yiv-350592341">A couple of weeks ago I took the great advice I got<br/>
here and told Tyler that I won&#39;t make him stay home or<br/>
go to school, that if he needs to take a day off from<br/>
school (5th grade) he can with no questions asked.<br/>
He&#39;s gone every day since with a smile on his face and<br/>
has managed his own work load with just the one<br/>
reminder he asked me to give him in the evening. Then<br/>
someone told me about their experience with that<br/>
growing up-how her Mom would let her take mental<br/>
health days but that she had to have some activity or<br/>
project planned. Apparently that stuck in my school<br/>
mode head as a &quot;good idea.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So when Tyler told me last night that he wanted to<br/>
take today off, I blurted out &quot;Well, fine. But you&#39;re<br/>
not going to stay home and play gameboy all day like<br/>
you did today. You&#39;ll need to plan some kind of<br/>
project or have some kind of work you can do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Uh. <br/>
<br/>
Duh.<br/>
<br/>
So he said never mind (of course), but then we all<br/>
overslept this morning and he missed the bus. He<br/>
wanted me to drive him, but I couldn&#39;t immediately<br/>
because I had to get breakfast for the baby. <br/>
<br/>
We started discussing school/no school. I have<br/>
succeeded in confusing the hell out of the poor kid<br/>
and now he doesn&#39;t know what he &quot;should&quot; do. He said<br/>
that if he stays home he just wants to lay around and<br/>
do nothing. Of course! He needs to deschool! I am<br/>
learning to speak more openly with him, but struggling<br/>
with allowing him to see that I am not *in control* of<br/>
my own thinking.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s home and I told him that if he has a ton of work<br/>
to make up, it&#39;s up to him if he wants to do it or<br/>
not. I also offered to help if he wants help.<br/>
<br/>
See, his grandpa pays him $10 for every A he gets, so<br/>
he&#39;s invested in grades. I think that&#39;s a huge<br/>
mistake, and am trying to find a way to gently pull<br/>
out of that, but don&#39;t think there is a gentle way. He<br/>
wants to do all of the homework and classwork, even<br/>
though he knows the material already; because each<br/>
assignment counts towards final grade. It&#39;s not about<br/>
the material, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
He said that if he doesn&#39;t do his work, he feels like<br/>
he&#39;s not doing his best work, then got mad and said<br/>
&quot;Now I&#39;m starting to sound like the stupid principal!<br/>
He&#39;s brainwashing me!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes he is!!! and alas, so am I!<br/>
<br/>
He then made the observation that he feels like the<br/>
principal is like the owner of a big company and that<br/>
the students are all like little workers.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah! They&#39;re not LIKE that, they ARE that. So we<br/>
talked about how the education system is a business<br/>
that employs a lot of people who are all invested in<br/>
the success of the school in terms of #&#39;s-grades and<br/>
test scores-because then the govt. gives the school<br/>
more money!<br/>
<br/>
So some backpedalling today and praying. He spent an<br/>
hour or so on the floor in his room playing with all<br/>
of his Mage Knight figures. He hasn&#39;t played with<br/>
those in months. He&#39;s got out the wooden blocks and is<br/>
building fortresses for them and making a big battle<br/>
plan. <br/>
<br/>
Now he just got the acoustic guitar we bought at a<br/>
yard sale out of the garage and cleaned it up. We<br/>
watched *School of Rock* the other night and it<br/>
convinced him of what he&#39;s been thinking for a few<br/>
months, that he wants to learn to play electric<br/>
guitar. We can&#39;t swing that right at the moment, would<br/>
have to save for a bit, but we do have this acoustic<br/>
one that sounds great, and only cost us $2. So I<br/>
called our local music store and after the baby wakes<br/>
from her nap we&#39;re going to drop the guitar off to be<br/>
restrung and tuned and to ask some questions. We have<br/>
a computer program for learning guitar that he can&#39;t<br/>
wait to dig into. I want to learn too.<br/>
<br/>
This is tricky. I realize that I am trying to<br/>
manipulate him into the realization that he doesn&#39;t<br/>
need school to learn. I keep leaving The Teenage<br/>
Liberation Handbook around, on the couch, on the<br/>
coffee table, on the kitchen table, on the bathroom<br/>
sink. So far he hasn&#39;t said a word or picked it up.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like we&#39;re THIS close. I also think I&#39;m going<br/>
to make it impossible if I keep getting my signals<br/>
crossed like I did last night. I know I have to get<br/>
rid of school thinking. I just keep reading more and<br/>
more material about unschooling and questioning myself<br/>
and my husband. We talk about it daily and examine how<br/>
school has taught us to think about everything and<br/>
anything in our lives. I want to let it go and just<br/>
when I think I&#39;ve got it, some new layer appears. It&#39;s<br/>
insidious how deep it runs. I know it can&#39;t be<br/>
overnight.<br/>
<br/>
It just takes a lot of practice, right? Just keep<br/>
going and keep questioning and keep talking? It will<br/>
get better?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326230666">Kelly - sounds like you&#39;re doing a great job.  Recognizing yourself and your words when they don&#39;t make sense and being willing and able to adjust.  Nothing wrong with making mistakes.  That&#39;s a big part of learning and a great lesson for our kids to see us gracefully adjust from our own &quot;oops- that&#39;s not really how I want to sound or be, let&#39;s rephrase this...&quot;  Just don&#39;t beat yourself up.  <br/>
<br/>
It does get better and easier and then it gets harder again and then it gets better and easier and then harder again....ha!  It just keeps getting.....<br/>
<br/>
I like to say &quot;practice makes progress.&quot; <br/>

Yes, to all of that.<br/>

When you think you&#39;ve made progress, and have reached a good plateau, <br/>
something can happen to throw you again.  Some family pressure or being sick or <br/>
worried about money, and you can blurt out the fears of 50 years ago in the voice <br/>

Tell him that.  Say that when people are stressed sometimes they fall back on <br/>
bad messages and bad fears and they&#39;re not doing their best thinking.  Then <br/>
help him avoid stress and fear, and he can learn to help you avoid it too.<br/>

<br/>
You are right about it taking time, and this is one of my ongoing struggles<br/>
also - and it has gotten easier for me with the help of the discussions on<br/>
this list. You will not get rid of it completely until you are out of school<br/>
for good.<br/>
Just a thought about Teen.Lib.Han. - he may not be picking it up because he<br/>
is still tied up with certain books being &quot;studied&quot; at a certain grade -<br/>
perhaps he doesn&#39;t see himself as a teen??? Is this a crazy notion? I<br/>
remember thinking that way in school - and having the converse that once I<br/>
had read a certain book for school it was forever tied to that age/grade as<br/>
being &quot;simpler&quot; or &quot;easier&quot; than the later books. This did not apply to the<br/>
books I was reading for pleasure outside of school. We read &quot;Romeo and<br/>
Juliet&quot; in Year 7, &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot; in Year 10, but &quot;Othello&quot; in Year<br/>
12.<br/>
It must be hard to have his Grandfather&#39;s love so tied to performance and<br/>
external things. I suppose he fears that he would lose that love if he was<br/>
out of school without the &quot;objective&quot; measure of grades. Since the amount of<br/>
money is pretty sizeable, it is easy to see it as a measure of love. What<br/>
else do they do together? Have you read &quot;Punished By Rewards&quot; (Alfie Kohn)?<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be great if your son was freely given gifts of money or stuff he<br/>
likes, with no strings attached, just for the pleasure of the giver, without<br/>
any kind of notion that he was being prepared for &quot;The Real World&quot; where you<br/>
have to work for a living. There are excerpts at www.naturalchild.org .<br/>

I really needed to read this today.  Our family has been under tremendous amounts of stress for the last 5 months.   We left our last church (we have been in ministry for the last 15 years) over issues we could not support.  It was our decision but that still didn&#39;t make it any easier.  We lived with my dh parents for the first 2.5 months and are now with mine.  We have finally made a decision on the where in the world we will live and now we are searching for a home.  We have made major transitions in career, etc... There are days I feel like a complete failure with my girls.  Just about everything we own is in storage.  They don&#39;t have the normal access to stuff to do like their art, games, etc., etc..  Our youngest has really had a hard time with all of this.  Then of course I have had my MIL say unkind things about the way we homeshool.  My mother has been kind in her questions but sometimes just the questions send me reeling.  I guess because she will say things like &quot;they need to know what a indirect object is or they need to know this higher level math&quot;, and on and on....  And then when I am alone the voices of &quot;50 years ago&quot;  come rushing to my mind.  Voices that say things like I am not doing all I should do or what if they can&#39;t get into a college if that is what they desire......  I tell myself this is only a temporary time in our lives.  Soon we will have our own space.  And then there are times when I say things to my girls that I don&#39;t mean to say.  Just old tapes, old junk!  I guess this is especially worse since this is our first year homeschooling/unschooling.  We are still very much deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I guess today is just a low day for me.  My dh and I did a wedding for a girl from the town we left this past weekend.  It was hard being there and our girls didn&#39;t want to leave.  Our horses are still there being taken care of by a friend and that just compounds everything for our 11yo.  And our 8yo stood outside my van refusing to leave her friend&#39;s house.   As the mommy, I just want to fix the hurt in my girls and make life come together faster....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; when people are stressed sometimes they fall back on <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bad messages and bad fears and they&#39;re not doing their best thinking. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am just not doing my best thinking today.....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me vent... You all are great!  This list has been my salvation through this time in our lives.  <br/>

&gt; I really needed to read this today.  Our family has been under tremendous<br/>

It was our decision but that still didn&#39;t make it any easier.  We lived with<br/>
my dh parents for the first 2.5 months and are now with mine.  We have<br/>
finally made a decision on the where in the world we will live and now we<br/>
are searching for a home.  We have made major transitions in career, etc...<br/>
There are days I feel like a complete failure with my girls.  Just about<br/>
everything we own is in storage.  They don&#39;t have the normal access to stuff<br/>
to do like their art, games, etc., etc..  Our youngest has really had a hard<br/>
time with all of this.  Then of course I have had my MIL say unkind things<br/>
about the way we homeshool.  My mother has been kind in her questions but<br/>
sometimes just the questions send me reeling.  I guess because she will say<br/>
things like &quot;they need to know what a indirect object is or they need to<br/>
know this higher level math&quot;, and on and on....  And then when I am alone<br/>
the voices of &quot;50 years ago&quot;  come rushing to my mind.  Voices that say<br/>
things like I am not doing all I should do or what if they can&#39;t get into a<br/>
college if that is what they desire......  I tell myself this is only a<br/>
temporary time in our lives.  Soon we will have our own space.  And then<br/>
there are times when I say things to my girls that I don&#39;t mean to say.<br/>
Just old tapes, old junk!  I guess this is especially worse since this is<br/>
our first year homeschooling/unschooling.  We are still very much<br/>
deschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess today is just a low day for me.  My dh and I did a wedding for a<br/>
girl from the town we left this past weekend.  It was hard being there and<br/>
our girls didn&#39;t want to leave.  Our horses are still there being taken care<br/>
of by a friend and that just compounds everything for our 11yo.  And our 8yo<br/>
stood outside my van refusing to leave her friend&#39;s house.   As the mommy, I<br/>
just want to fix the hurt in my girls and make life come together faster....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; when people are stressed sometimes they fall back on<br/>

Kristen S graduated in the top fourth of her high school class with an SAT of somewhere around 1200, and graduated from Nursing School with a 3.3 GPA.  <br/>
<br/>
She went on and finished her BSN with a minor in Biology, and has been working for the past 16 years in a Trauma Intensive Care Unit.  <br/>
<br/>
In addition, she has worked in the Recovery Room, the Emergency Dept, does Conscious Sedation on the floors, and helps out in the Imaging Department.<br/>
<br/>
SHE doesn&#39;t know what an indirect object is either, and her mom is a College English Professor!!!<br/>
<br/>
Kristen, who doesn&#39;t give a flying fig either since she is very happy being an Unschooling mom while she also turns her rural suburban home into an energy conscious homestead complete with chickens, ducks, and a pig!<br/>

  Hi Tracey,<br/>
<br/>
  I have a new message for your brain recorder.  When ever you hear your<br/>
  mother&#39;s voice saying &quot;But they need to know what an indirect object is...&quot;<br/>
  I want you to respond to yourself with &quot;Julie S. graduated in the top 10% of<br/>
  her high school class, she made over 1300 on her SAT, she has a Master&#39;s<br/>
  degree.....and she doesn&#39;t have a clue what an indirect object is....and she<br/>
  doesn&#39;t give a flying fig either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Julie S.---who after many years of school and corporate success finally<br/>
  figured out her dream is to be a goat farmer and she couldn&#39;t be happier<br/>

summer &quot;break&quot; - especially if they start unschooling immediately - by which<br/>
I mean allowing the process of deschooling to begin with all the freedom to<br/>
vegetate in front of the tv, read or play computer games &quot;all day&quot; ;), and<br/>
never worry about back-to-school preparation, reading any of the books for<br/>
next session, or looking back at the report cards. Think of how much more<br/>
