<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508216259"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I believe that children should be taught at home by parents or in very small groups.  (I might consider retaining the one-room schoolhouse.)  School is the worst way to provide for a child&#39;s -- any child&#39;s --  education.  And because I am sure to get flamed, I might as well say that of course some people, single parents, those few families in which both parents must work, or for those few families that just don&#39;t have the temperment, must make provision for their children.  Personally, I would much rather see those children in the arms of a nice cooperating homeschooling family during the <br/>
&gt;day than warehoused in a school.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know it&#39;s a big chunk for me to paste, but I just could not bear to cut any of it out.  How many ways are there to say that I agree with you wholeheartedly?  I feel the very same way, and one room schools, mixing kids of various ages, and skill levels, and peer tutoring one another as they are led in their studies by a caring adult is a much healthier model for school than our current ideal, which I refer to as Kiddie Prison.<br/>
<br/>
I would make one amendment to your statement, however.  When you said that school was the worst way to provide for any child&#39;s education.  My amendment would be to say that I think you should not stop at children.  It is the worst way for ANYONE of ANY AGE to learn.<br/>

i am dealing with the same thing here with my local support groups and i used <br/>
to plan open-aged trips 2 to 3 times a month. i pretty much have stepped back <br/>
from the group--their loss, not mine--and i am planning trips for people i <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552303822">Have you noticed that although some folks profess to want out of the whole<br/>
ps nightmare that they just can&#39;t let go.  They just have to take all the<br/>
basic rules and make them their own, put their own twist on them but there<br/>
are still the same rules.<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest is 8 and the big kids (16 and 17 yo boys and their<br/>
girlfriends) drag her around with them and it is a two-way learning street<br/>
for both age groups.  Age (as Cindy knows) is one of my pet peeves &lt;g&gt;  It<br/>
is such an arbitary thing to judge an individual by.  I mean, #2 son was<br/>
born OLD, age had nothing to do with anything he did/does.  Eldest daughter<br/>
I&#39;m not sure is ever going to reach an age beyond about 18.  The calendar<br/>
tells us absolutely nothing and, IMHO, should only be used to schedule fun<br/>
things to do!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-529565764">I agree with the age thing.  And what is really funny is that in the never <br/>
ending effort for schools to bring real life into the classroom, my nephew&#39;s <br/>
elementary school has a buddy system where older kids are paired with younger <br/>
kids and they do projects together and homework help - stuff like that.  It <br/>
just is natural for kids to hang out with kids of all ages, if given the <br/>
opportunity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045063735">Cindy, we have a Homeschool Resource Center near, where any one who wants to <br/>
throw a class can, sometimes they do seperate them by ages, but most have <br/>
been pretty open minded. We had a really great environmental education class <br/>
last year. Many kids wanted to take it, so there was one class time for <br/>
youngers and one for older kids. They did some different experiments in each <br/>
class, but when we had a speaker or a field trip all the kids went together. <br/>
Our trip to the landfill had kids from 2 to 16 and lots of Moms. The kids <br/>
were all attentive and asked good questions and were very well <br/>
informed-little ones as well as teens. While we waited for our turn in the <br/>
tour van they all played around together. It worked out very well for all, I <br/>
think. Btw, the mom who planned this class got a grant from the Keep <br/>
Franklin County Beautiful Committee and had enough money to buy test kits <br/>
and a tv and vcr for the center and pay for the guests and trips-there are <br/>
alot of possabilities out there.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you Nanci, for your kind words.  With all the hullaballoo on the list <br/>
the last few days (I&#39;m about 2 days behind in reading it all!), I really <br/>
wondered after I sent the post whether I&#39;d be trashed for having such a <br/>
strong opinion.  It&#39;s nice to know that I&#39;m not alone out there.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I almost agree with your comment about school and ANYONE.  But, I have <br/>
to admit I am a little biased.  Once a year I teach a college course or two <br/>
to a bunch of undergraduates in a legal studies program.  It&#39;s an elective, <br/>
so the students are somewhat more motivated, in fact, they are generally <br/>
delightful.  Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t yet figured out to make my courses more <br/>
unschoolish.  <br/>
<br/>
As to college on the whole, I do not agree with having broad based <br/>
requirements (like social studies for a math major).  I would allow students <br/>
to take whatever they want to.  I would also have more seminars and <br/>
independent study programs.  I wouldn&#39;t do away with college.  Come to think <br/>
of it, my ideal college would look at lot like a homeschooling support group <br/>
with co-op classes!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most of our activities are not segregated by age.  But, this is the second <br/>
year of our co-op classes, and the teachers have put age restrictions on <br/>
their classes.  For instance, we have two choir groups.  This has worked well <br/>
because the younger kids get very fidgetty after about a 1/2 hour, and the <br/>
older kids have been able to work on more complicated material.  The science <br/>
teacher has segregated her classes by grade, 4-6th grades, 7&8th grades, and <br/>
high school.  We&#39;ve had some younger children who were perfectly capable of <br/>
handling material for the older grades, but she&#39;s made a firm policy of not <br/>
allowing the kids into the classes unless they were age appropriate for the <br/>
grades she&#39;s covering.  She says she&#39;s had too many parents ask for <br/>
exceptions.  At home she&#39;s a more structured homeschooler, too.  So, I&#39;m sure <br/>
that enters into her thinking.  <br/>

the kids did not segregate themselves by age when they played.  The younger <br/>
kids were included with the older ones.  And that was not imposed by the <br/>
grown-ups.  The kids played together because they wanted to play together.  I <br/>
thought that was so neat!  <br/>
