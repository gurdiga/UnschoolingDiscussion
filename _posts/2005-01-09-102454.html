Kirby  will be taking English 101<br/>
Math 99 (not college credit)<br/>
and CSE 100 (not  for credit, and an interesting thing)<br/>

 <br/>
I had intended to say, for the benefit of those who live where the English  <br/>
school system is, that English 101 is the writing class most first-year  <br/>
university students have to take.  It&#39;s not universal, but it&#39;s largely on  semester <br/>
of English 101 for writing (essays, exposition, reports) and then a  semester <br/>
of English 102, which is commentary on readings.  Analytical  writing based <br/>
on short literature, articles--that varies.<br/>
 <br/>
With test scores such as ACT or SAT, sometimes new college students can  <br/>
&quot;test out&quot; of those and go on to particular topics.  Few care to do  so.  English <br/>
majors sometimes like to pad their hours with easier things,  and those who <br/>
don&#39;t intend to take lots of English classes often take those two  (IF they&#39;re <br/>
required) and no more, ever.<br/>
 <br/>
A young friend of mine once said, in the midst of re-taking English  102 <br/>
after having failed it, that he was going to join the army as a paratrooper  <br/>
because he hated that class so much.  He said &quot;I would rather jump out of  an <br/>
airplane with a rifle than take English 102.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Because writing was easy for me, I enjoyed it.<br/>
