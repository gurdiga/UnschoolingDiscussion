<div id="ygrps-yiv-10879109">**Can anybody share new ideas for storing children&#39;s clothing?  Jackie <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to use the closet and doesn&#39;t enjoy digging in the drawers.  We&#39;re <br/>
thinking of trying cubes.  Any other ideas?**<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son had a bed that was several feet off the floor. We used tall <br/>
plastic tubs shoved under the bed to hold his clothes. Huge ones. Only half full. <br/>
Then when he rummaged through them things didn&#39;t end up all over the floor. <br/>
<br/>
Pat and Sarah have a cubical wall storage thingie from Ikea that holds their <br/>
clothes. Most things are stacked in the cubes, but they have baskets that fit <br/>
the cubes for socks and underwear. They don&#39;t keep them super neatly stacked <br/>
but it&#39;s easy to redo when stuff starts falling out. We just recently switched <br/>
over their room to all shelves, taking out the big dressers. There was too <br/>
much wasted space with the dressers, and the drawers were constantly getting <br/>
stuck from having too much shoved in them, or they were hanging out in the way. <br/>
With shelves they don&#39;t have to leave room for sliding in and out, and packing <br/>
stuff in just looks messy but doesn&#39;t risk clothing damage. <br/>
<br/>
We also put a tall bookcase beside their bunk bed so they both have storage <br/>
space they can reach from their beds, for books and game boys and cd players <br/>
and journals and whatever else one might want while winding down.<br/>
<br/>
There are hooks over the bedroom door for robes or whatever. I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
putting a couple hooks up somewhere for stuff clean enough to wear again.<br/>
