<div id="ygrps-yiv-746530008">HELP! My heart is breaking. I think it is a foreshadowing of how I <br/>
will feel when any of my kids are ready to leave the nest. We began <br/>
unschooling in february 2002, after many years of public school <br/>
troubles. We pulled her out, and began deschooling/unschooling. A lot <br/>
of damage was repaired. I saw a spark and happiness that I had not <br/>
seen since before preschool. I have seen a maturity in this 10yo that <br/>
has surprised me. To listen to her explain why she loves <br/>
homeschooling to grandparents and friends has been a great <br/>
affirmation to this way of life. But now she wants to go back to <br/>
school. She insists I have &quot;trained&quot; her to stand up for herself, be <br/>
disciplined, do things right the first time, and she knows she can <br/>
succeed. I have never seen this maturity and confidence from her. <br/>
What do I do? I worry that her kinesthetic on the move/ADD style of <br/>
learning will be snuffed out again. I do not endorse public school <br/>
after all i have learned through researching homeschooling. <br/>
Ultimately I have told her it is her decision. I don&#39;t want to stifle <br/>
her courage and confidence to go back to a place that was such a <br/>
relief to get away from. I want her to spread her wings and fly when <br/>
she feels she is ready. I was hoping she would never want to back to <br/>
school. I thought she would at least wait until middle school or high <br/>
school before she started wondering what she is missing. I believe it <br/>
is still unschooling if she goes to school by her choice. I am <br/>
wondering if they can let her attend half days and still let me be <br/>
responsible for her education. I hesistate to call the school, i <br/>
don&#39;t think they have her best interests in mind. I need some serious <br/>
advice. I am in Ohio, if anyone can give specific advice. Ironically <br/>
we have a portfolio review scheduled for monday, and school started <br/>
yesterday. Do i cancel the review and call the school? HELP</div>

 </span></blockquote>Can you talk her into giving it one more year before heading back?  <br/>
What kinds of things does she feel she is missing by not going to <br/>
school?  Maybe you could brainstorm other ways to meet those needs.<br/>
Have you looked into all your options in your community for her to <br/>
socialize and have a sense of belonging to something other than your <br/>
family?<br/>
I&#39;m just throwing ideas out.  <br/>
If it were me, I would try really hard to figure out why she wants to <br/>
go, and talk my child into just why I don&#39;t think schools will meet <br/>
those needs.  And find other ways that will.<br/>
If in the end of me trying really hard to convince her that we can do <br/>
way better, she still wanted to go, I would not stop any of my kids.<br/>
But I have no problems with stating my case strongly.<br/>
I didn&#39;t do that for my son who went to K.  When he was deciding <br/>
about 1st grade, I decided that giving him a choice did not mean not <br/>
giving him my opinion and I told him exactly why I didn&#39;t want him to <br/>
go, and what we would do to make sure he was happy at home.  He <br/>
immediately said he didn&#39;t want to go to 1st and asked me in a sort <br/>
of aggrivated way, why I hadn&#39;t told him all that last year!?.<br/>
Maybe your dd needs more time away to really understand and believe <br/>
in herself.  To really break away from the school system.  <br/>
I would not jump right back in without some long serious talks and <br/>
lots of soul searching and brainstorming for other options.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Why not let her do FULL days so she&#39;ll get tired of it sooner?<br/>
<br/>
Let HER be responsible for her education, not you or the school.  She&#39;ll <br/>
learn all kinds of things, and probably the biggest will be that unschooling <br/>
and being home are huge gifts the other kids would love to have.<br/>

library book.  But if you get hauled into juvenile court because your <br/>
kid doesn&#39;t go to school--$5,000 max (so much per day, but I can&#39;t <br/>
remember what it is).  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like she might think she failed in some way and that she wasn&#39;t <br/>
up to the task of school. Maybe she somehow thinks she couldn&#39;t cut it at <br/>
school and that&#39;s why she &quot;had to&quot; be homeschooled. Now that she&#39;s feeling a <br/>
bit more confidence in her abilities, she might want to be going back to <br/>
prove something to herself and others.<br/>
<br/>
Conor told me much later that he sort of felt this way at first. It took <br/>
awhile before he realized that it was the school system that failed him and <br/>
NOT the other way around. He also said that he had looked forward to 5th <br/>
grade and being the oldest kids in the school. (Not enough to ask to go back <br/>
though.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have never seen this maturity and confidence from her. What do I do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Support her, talk to her, try to get at what she&#39;s really hoping for from <br/>
another school year. Congratulate her on how mature and confident she seems. <br/>
Assure her that you KNOW she&#39;ll make the decision that feels right for her <br/>
*right now*. That keeps the door open for changing her mind and her decision <br/>
if circumstances change. You know, like if school is boring and tedious and <br/>
she wants to stop after a few weeks, days or hours. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I worry that her kinesthetic on the move/ADD style of learning will be <br/>
&gt;&gt;snuffed out again.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would also worry about her picking up too much on those labels and <br/>
worrying that she&#39;s somehow damaged goods. Labels like that tend to have us <br/>
thinking that there are the &quot;regular/normal&quot; learners and then there are <br/>
those ADD/kinesthetic types. :-P~~~~<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve discovered with unschooling, true learning doesn&#39;t come <br/>
with a label. It doesn&#39;t come prepackaged or neatly ordered or by grade <br/>
levels. It comes in leaps and bounds and fits and starts. It swirls up and <br/>
then settles down. It comes from a place of joyful inquiry and sometimes <br/>
frustrated investigation. It comes from the learner.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter does ultimately decide to try school again, help her to <br/>
makeit a true learning experience. Take away the school&#39;s power over her and <br/>
let her approach it on her own terms. Each assignment, book, or activity <br/>
will be her decision to do. She will own the experience or whe will decide <br/>
it&#39;s not worth her effort. And either way you will be in her corner, ready <br/>
to help and support her.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108788663">Oh, you&#39;ll love this.  I didn&#39;t realize other states didn&#39;t have <br/>
truancy fines...How do they enforce compulsory education laws?  <br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers have trouble with this all the time in PA.  Our messed <br/>
up law says that if a school district feels satisfactory education <br/>
isn&#39;t occurring, he should initiate a due process hearing. BUT!  No <br/>
districts ever do.  That would cost them money.  So instead, they <br/>
throw truancy fines.  And guess who gets to keep the money from <br/>
truancy fines?  Yep, the district.  Isn&#39;t that sweet?  <br/>
<br/>
So, for example, the law doesn&#39;t say that we need to show a copy of <br/>
our highschool diploma in order to homeschool, but many homeschoolers <br/>
attach it anyway.  (According to the law, we simply need to attest to <br/>
having a highschool diploma in the affidavit).  So if a district <br/>
wants to demand something--like a highschool diploma, or evidence of <br/>
immunization, or even a daily teacher&#39;s plan book, they often charge <br/>
homeschoolers with truancy.  <br/>
<br/>
If a homeschooler forgets to hand in an affidavit in PA, they get <br/>
fined for every day their children are &quot;truant&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
When my brother was a teenager my parents couldn&#39;t get him to go to <br/>
school.  They allowed him to become an emancipated minor so that they <br/>
didn&#39;t have to keep paying the fines. (They didn&#39;t understand or know <br/>
much about homeschooling at the time).  I think it got to the point <br/>
where the fines were 100 a day.  <br/>
<br/>
I know a lady who felt convicted that she didn&#39;t want to answer to <br/>
the state about her kids&#39; education and tried to <br/>
homeschool &quot;underground&quot;.  (No affidavit filed, no portfolio turned <br/>
in, no tests, no evaluations).  She got away with it for awhile and <br/>
then got reported (You know, the usual, &quot;So and so&#39;s kids are never <br/>
in school report).  They charged her with truancy and fined her.  She <br/>
didn&#39;t pay the fines.  Her husband did some jail time over unpaid <br/>
truancy fines.  Officials came for him and aimed a loaded shot gun at <br/>
her and her children (over unpaid truancy fines).  She was in court <br/>
for a long, long time and ended up losing anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
I copied the following from this website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.elc-pa.org/brochures/School%20Attendance%20%20Truancy.htm">http://www.elc-pa.org/brochures/School%20Attendance%20%20Truancy.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
ºIf a judge finds a child truant, what can the judge do to the <br/>
parents and the child?<br/>
<br/>
 The judge can order a variety of penalties if the judge finds that <br/>
the child is truant.  The parent can be found guilty of a summary <br/>
offense and fined up to $300 for each truancy violation.  Or, the <br/>
judge could require the parent to complete a &quot;parenting education <br/>
program.&quot;  The judge can also decide that instead of, or in addition <br/>
to, the fine or education program, the parent must perform community <br/>
service in the school district where the child lives for up to six <br/>
months.  <br/>
<br/>
 If the parent fails to comply with the court order, they can be <br/>
sentenced to serve up to five (5) days in a county jail.  However, if <br/>
the parents haven&#39;t paid the fine that the court has ordered, they <br/>
can only be sent to jail after a hearing is held to determine whether <br/>
they had the financial ability to pay the fine.<br/>
<br/>
Depending upon the child&#39;s age, the judge can fine the child up to <br/>
$300 for each truancy violation, if the parents can show they tried <br/>
to try to get the child to go to school.  Or, the judge can assign <br/>
the child to an &quot;adjudication alternative program&quot; (such as an <br/>
education program or community service).<br/>
<br/>
A child who is found to be truant can also have his or her driver&#39;s <br/>
license suspended for 90 days if it is the child&#39;s first truancy <br/>
conviction.  The child&#39;s driver&#39;s license will be suspended for six <br/>
(6) months for any additional truancy conviction.  If the child does <br/>
not have a driver&#39;s license, the chance to apply for one will be <br/>
suspended for 90 days for the first truancy offense, and six (6) <br/>
months for additional offenses.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; ºIf a judge finds a child truant, what can the judge do to the <br/>
&gt; parents and the child?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The judge can order a variety of penalties if the judge finds that <br/>
&gt; the child is truant.  The parent can be found guilty of a summary <br/>
&gt; offense and fined up to $300 for each truancy violation.  Or, the <br/>
&gt; judge could require the parent to complete a &quot;parenting education <br/>
&gt; program.&quot;  The judge can also decide that instead of, or in addition <br/>
&gt; to, the fine or education program, the parent must perform community <br/>
&gt; service in the school district where the child lives for up to six <br/>
&gt; months.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the parent fails to comply with the court order, they can be <br/>
&gt; sentenced to serve up to five (5) days in a county jail.  However, if <br/>
&gt; the parents haven&#39;t paid the fine that the court has ordered, they <br/>
&gt; can only be sent to jail after a hearing is held to determine whether <br/>
&gt; they had the financial ability to pay the fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Depending upon the child&#39;s age, the judge can fine the child up to <br/>
&gt; $300 for each truancy violation, if the parents can show they tried <br/>
&gt; to try to get the child to go to school.  Or, the judge can assign <br/>
&gt; the child to an &quot;adjudication alternative program&quot; (such as an <br/>
&gt; education program or community service).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A child who is found to be truant can also have his or her driver&#39;s <br/>
&gt; license suspended for 90 days if it is the child&#39;s first truancy <br/>
&gt; conviction.  The child&#39;s driver&#39;s license will be suspended for six <br/>
&gt; (6) months for any additional truancy conviction.  If the child does <br/>
&gt; not have a driver&#39;s license, the chance to apply for one will be <br/>
&gt; suspended for 90 days for the first truancy offense, and six (6) <br/>
&gt; months for additional offenses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-657395685">**How can anyone read what Sheran has written and then say that this is<br/>
not a forum for politics? **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that both Joyce and I posted that there are 50 states in the US<br/>
and that the political details are different in every state.  In<br/>
addition, this list has an international scope.  Detailed state<br/>
information is likely to be irrelevant to nearly 49 out of every 50<br/>
people on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in California and some of our legal issues that were mentioned here<br/>
recently were covered in much much more exhaustive detail on my<br/>
California HSC list.  I really doubt that the majority on this list<br/>
wants to hear about it in more depth, over and over as we are doing on<br/>
our state list right now.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage everyone to participate in local political action and<br/>
subscribe to their own state and local (or provincial) lists **in<br/>

<br/>
Betsy makes a good point.<br/>
<br/>
From years in SCA management (Society for Creative Anachronism) I learned <br/>
that people often don&#39;t know the difference between local policy and <br/>
corporate rules.  So someone would write to the board of directors of an <br/>
international corporation all het up about how they had to report, or about <br/>
the rules about lenghts of swords or something, and we would have to point <br/>
out to them that it was the rules of their own kingdom or region they were <br/>
upset about, and that rule had not been made by the corporation.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S. there ARE no federal laws which affect homeschoolers.  The <br/>
federal law which benefits homeschoolers is the absolute freedom of Americans <br/>
(barring custody conditions or court orders of some rare sort) to move from <br/>
state to state without even having to tell anyone they&#39;re going to do it.<br/>
<br/>
If someone in Pennsylvania thinks that their restrictions are typical, it <br/>
helps for them to know it&#39;s local and unusual.  For them to say <br/>
&quot;Homeschoolers are required to do these unreasonable things,&quot; the right <br/>
response is &quot;only in Pennsylvania.&quot;   There ARE people who work on changing <br/>
laws.  And there is a mailing list for unschoolers in Pennsylvania.<br/>
<br/>
But the way people learn doesn&#39;t have to do with what country they live in.  <br/>
Natural learning works the same way in New Zealand as it does in Germany.   <br/>
And that&#39;s what unschoolers have in common, and what we can best use an <br/>
international unschooling list for.<br/>

and talked. She is positive this is what she wants to do. She misses friends, <br/>

Why not give her a safe haven and a welcoming alternative?<br/>

Why can&#39;t she go to school on her own terms?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, someone sent the link to your &quot;Public School on Your Own <br/>
Terms&quot;. Dh and I had a long talk about what we will expect from her <br/>
if she goes to school. He thinks if she goes, she has to follow <br/>
certain rules. He doesn&#39;t want to be charged with Truancy in the name <br/>
of schooling freedom. He agrees that WE won&#39;t fight with her over <br/>
homework, but she will have the school&#39;s consequences, and we will be <br/>
neutral. Now it is irrelevant, at least until next year. SHe decided <br/>
she isn&#39;t quite ready. Thanks for the frank advice, as always :0)<br/>
I took my nose out of &quot;Homeschooling Book of Answers&quot; for the summer, <br/>
and the article reminded me to get my nose back in it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348020518">Hi Sandra, sorry it&#39;s taken me weeks to reply to your query. We have been very busy and I got behind with this busy group&#39;s post! Of course the more behind I get the less likely I am to approach the task! Until today. Yes, I have found two good groups in Australia: one unschool one homeschool. Of course there are others but this may help.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/australianhomeschool/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/australianhomeschool/</a><br/>
I am finding the posts here about unschooling helpful, sorry to be lurking at teh moment!<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Leonie (Oz)<br/>
