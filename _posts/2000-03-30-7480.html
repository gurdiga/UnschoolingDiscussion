<div id="ygrps-yiv-30688877">Dear Brynn,<br/>
   We live just south of the golf course, actually 2 blocks south of Grove <br/>
Street!  This is too cool!  At the moment, I have a 9 1/2 year-old son, but <br/>
we will soon be licensed for foster care and we plan to adopt two more <br/>
children.  I am new to unschooling, but I am finding it a fascinating <br/>
lifestyle.  I am a member of the Marysville Support Group, but I don&#39;t attend <br/>
very regularly.  We will have to get together and share ideas!<br/>
<br/>
