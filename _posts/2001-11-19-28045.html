My son does not belong to me, except in that we belong to each other out of <br/>
love.  There are certainly times when I have made decisions for him based on <br/>

be safe, emotionally or physically.  I trust Julian to make good decisions. <br/>
(Unfortunately, there are others in world who we cannot trust. When Julian <br/>
was little I fought to keep his otherwise excellent father from allowing his <br/>
mother unsupervised time with Julian, because she had a history of physically <br/>
abusing her children.) <br/>
<br/>
I do not believe our children belong to us. I believe it&#39;s wrong to control <br/>
them for our own reasons.  We have many more responsibilities to them than <br/>
they have to us. In a right relationship, our children will treat us with <br/>
love and respect (because that is what they have learned and experienced), <br/>
but I don&#39;t believe they OWE us anything.<br/>

What you wrote above is precisely why I do not call our family a<br/>
homeschooling family.  We are an UNSCHOOLING family.  I do not want to<br/>
be confused with those type of people you described.  So many parents<br/>
seem to be homeschooling for precisely the opposite reason why we are<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
By talking to them about what you&#39;re doing and when and how and why.<br/>
<br/>
By treating them like people instead of &quot;children&quot; (in the worst ownership <br/>
ways).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re already hooked up with the Christian unschooling <br/>
site/community.  Their explanations might be more to your liking.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing people to do things is very often training them NOT to do it when <br/>
you&#39;re not there forcing them to do it.  Behavior, reading, eating, anything.<br/>
<br/>
