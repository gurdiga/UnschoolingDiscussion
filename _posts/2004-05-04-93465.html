<div id="ygrps-yiv-946299021">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
We have finally decided to make the big move back to our rural roots.  <br/>
Unfortunately, there are not a lot of homeschoolers in the area we are headed.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been doing some research and making some calls and have found 1 Christian <br/>
support group in the area which has about 45 families involved.  We are not <br/>
Christian homeschoolers.  Well, we go to church with my parents sometimes, but <br/>
would not put myself in the same league as those hsing for religious reasons.<br/>
Anyways, I&#39;m hoping to perhaps find some more like-minded hsers, but if not <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if anyone has experience with Christian groups?  I&#39;m sure each <br/>
one is different and I guess I&#39;ll find out how &quot;strict&quot; they are about <br/>
membership policies etc when we get there.  Just looking for other people&#39;s <br/>
experiences.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Amanda<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448808613">I&#39;ve done a few activities with a Christian group before and while (as a<br/>
whole) they welcomed me and were friendly and didn&#39;t inquire as to my faith<br/>
( although I think they assumed I held the same beliefs as them), I still<br/>
felt like I didn&#39;t fit because my ideas were so different from the majority<br/>
of the group.  (And I&#39;m not much of a group person anyways.)<br/>
 <br/>
They spent time discussing their home schooling problems and curriculum and<br/>
I felt like I had nothing to add to the conversation most of the time.  When<br/>
I did add my two cents worth from an unschooling perspective, *I* felt like<br/>
I they thought I was off my rocker or that only people with precocious kids<br/>
could unschool.  It couldn&#39;t work for them.  Their kids just aren&#39;t that<br/>
motivated.  yada yada yada.  They were respectful of my choice though.<br/>
 <br/>
One example:  Someone was looking for a math curriculum that had teaching<br/>
time in it for a second grader.  I replied that time was one of those things<br/>
that kids pick up easily from asking ...what time is it?  so often.  It<br/>
isn&#39;t necessary to have it covered in a curriculum.  Her response....I don&#39;t<br/>
have time to answer &quot;what time is it&quot; all day long.  I am too busy teaching<br/>
the kids.  It needs to be covered in the curriculum so he will learn it.   I<br/>
just felt so out of place that it wasn&#39;t a comfortable place for me by my<br/>
own choice.  <br/>
 <br/>
That said, my unschooling talk did influence one person who at least &quot;tried<br/>
unschooling&quot; for a little while.  I am afraid she didn&#39;t quite grasp the<br/>
concept completely though and eventually gave up and sent her kids to public<br/>
school.  :0(  Later on I found out that another person who participated in<br/>
that group (but didn&#39;t go to the same church, like everyone else) is a very<br/>
laid back homeschooler who basically teaches with games.   I just hadn&#39;t<br/>
really talked with her much at the group events. <br/>
 <br/>
It is certainly possible to meet other people in a Christian group who are<br/>
more laid back in their approach to home schooling.  Maybe your kids will<br/>
hit it off and you will be able to keep the conversation on anything *but*<br/>
religion.  I&#39;d give it a try if it were my only choice.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope you enjoy living in the country again.  :0)<br/>

<br/>
The buzzword to use when you inquire would be &quot;statement of faith.&quot;  If you <br/>
wonder what those might be like, just go to google.com and put in homeschool <br/>
group statement of faith.<br/>
<br/>
Some groups require the statement be signed by any family participating.  <br/>
Others only require it for the officers.  Some call themselves &quot;inclusive&quot; and <br/>
the fact that that there&#39;s a statement of faith required for officers or <br/>
organizers isn&#39;t openly discussed.<br/>
<br/>
If they say they&#39;re &quot;not a statement of faith group,&quot; that would mean they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind you being there even though you might not be exactly their kind of <br/>
Christian.  (Depending what other impurities your life has, you might still <br/>
be welcome, I mean.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ll find another group anyway and it won&#39;t matter.<br/>

<br/>
Or MAKE your own group. Yahoogroups are free and easy to establish. Then <br/>
&quot;advertise&quot; in your area. Make it inclusive or secular or unschoolers only or <br/>
whatever you&#39;re comfortable with. You&#39;d be surprised who will come out of the <br/>
woodwork!<br/>

In a court of parenting, that should put into question her suitability to be <br/>
a homeschooling mom.  I mean if I were the judge. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she had time to tell them what time it was all day long, in no time they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to ask anymore, and she wouldn&#39;t have to EVER teach if she&#39;d just <br/>
have time to answer questions all day long!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661784382">If it&#39;s the only homeschooling support group in the area, odds are that you <br/>
may find yourself a match in the group.  However, it will take some time, <br/>
considerable restraint, and diplomacy to determine who the like-minded <br/>
families are.  You may not want to or feel comfortable enough to speak up <br/>
publicly about your methods and philosophies, but will rather hold <br/>
one-on-one chit chats on the side as you get to know the individual parents <br/>
during the various activities.  In the meantime though, you and your <br/>
children will make friends and acquaintances of all kinds.  The kids in <br/>
particular usually don&#39;t care what brand of homeschooling a family is <br/>
using!  It&#39;s worth at least a try.  Be prepared for the prayer before and <br/>
end of every meeting though....and prepare the kids.<br/>
