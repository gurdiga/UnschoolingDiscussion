 </span></blockquote>I think you touched on the heart of it.  <br/>
<br/>
My life revolves around my children, my family.  I come here because I need <br/>
ideas, help, inspiration.  But my life is my home, my family, our farm, art, <br/>
music.  That&#39;s where I get my &quot;self worth&quot; and good feelings about myself.  I <br/>
don&#39;t look to a group of people I&#39;ve never met (IRL) to fulfil my self esteem <br/>
and to make me feel included.  <br/>
<br/>
It just happens that if you post, banter back and forth, joke, and share <br/>
without taking anything personally, your self worth and good feelings WILL grow.  <br/>
How can they not, when you&#39;re learning to relax, trust, and be a kinder and <br/>
gentler parent?  Then you won&#39;t feel like an outsider because you &quot;get&quot; what the <br/>
long-timers so passionately have &quot;gotten&quot; for years.<br/>
