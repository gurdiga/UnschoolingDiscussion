<div id="ygrps-yiv-517035679">Argh!!  My children are acting like beasts on a daily basis lately!  Stella, the 4 yo, screams bloody murder at Annie, the 3 yo (wonder where she got that...sigh), but usually doesn&#39;t physically hurt anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Annie, my almost 3.5 yo, has always been a bit brutish towards people for no apparent reason.  She is often very sweet and loving as well, but for some reason, she will haul off and hit or kick Stella, the 4 yo, for no apparent reason, or she&#39;ll poke her in the eyes, just because. (Sometimes the reason is apparent--Stella has been annoying her in some way, but there are definitely many times when Annie just gets a wild a hair and hurts Stella or the baby.)  She has been doing this alot lately for whatever reason--oh, I&#39;m sure there is one, but it&#39;s still not okay.  Just now, she slapped Stella hard in the face.  She did the same thing last night and yesterday afternoon.  Yesterday in the bathtub, she kicked her repeatedly in the neck and head, while I was changing the baby&#39;s diaper.  This morning, after removing her from the scene (they were all playing with blocks in the bedroom), and telling her that I will not allow her to hurt Stella, I asked her why she hit her.  She smiled and said, &quot;I just wanted to.&quot;  She was using this &quot;little miss innocent, aren&#39;t I funny?&quot; voice that she uses for just this sort of occasion.  I don&#39;t like it at all.  I didn&#39;t let her go back in to play for a little while.  I told her that when she hurts the other kids, I have to protect them by removing her until I trust she can play without hurting anyone. I was quite stern with her. When I did let her go back in after about 2 minutes, she wasted no time jumping on Evan, the 13 mo old, and wouldn&#39;t let him up!  ARGH!  I brought her back out, explaining again, that it&#39;s not okay for her to hurt the other kids.  I again told her that I am her mommy and also Stella and Evan&#39;s mommy, and I won&#39;t allow anyone to hurt any of them, including her.  She bellowed at the top of her lungs and strenuously resisted her removal and pitched a serious fit while in my company.  Finally she calmed down, and I hugged her and told her she could play again, but would be removed if she hurt anyone.  Now I am wondering when it will happen again, because my experience tells me that it will, and probably very soon.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, Annie is the most difficult to raise of all my children.  She is as cute as can be (actually looks like some renaissance painting of a cherub--she&#39;s chubby with rosy cheeks, big blue eyes and curly golden hair) and  she&#39;s very lovey, huggy, and also very imaginative.  She is very good at creating her own entertainment, even with just her fingers to animate.  I love her dearly, of course. She is, however, VERY contrary and stubborn.  She does everything in her own way and time. She first crawled when she was 13 months old.  She first walked at 18 mos.  Didn&#39;t really trying talking in earnest until she was close to turning 3.  Not only did she not seem ready, but she seemed to prefer just yelling and making awful noises.  She is still deciding whether she wants to use the toilet or her pants, though, thankfully, she seems to be choosing the toilet more. (Always refused to use the little potty, even though she is very short compared to other kids her age.)  Before I had her, I thought I had a handle on most parenting issues.  HA!  She challenges almost everything at some point.  She is and always has been extremely difficult to redirect.  Used to be she wouldn&#39;t let you hold her when she was angry, but would freak out when you put her down.  (She&#39;s grown out of that for the most part, though, and welcomes my hugs when she is upset now.) She would fuss and kick me hard all night when I was still nursing her, digging her toes into my thighs when she was still sleeping with me, but would yell and yell if I tried to get her to sleep elsewhere.  She is unusually loud, too.  More than once, someone from several houses away has come to my door to see if &quot;everything was okay.&quot;  We laugh about it, especially now, but man, she was and is a trip!  She is the only child that has actually embarrased me enough that I left a store (a thrift store at that!) without getting what I went in for! I wouldn&#39;t let her play with a broken glass vase, and she went ballistic.  She started yelling so loudly it actually startled me and several other shoppers who looked over in amazement, and then she smacked me hard, right in the face, in front of them all.  The two older ladies shopping the same aisle were astonished.  I actually stayed quite calm,  I held her hands to keep her from doing it again (she was trying), told Stella I was sorry but because of the way Annie was behaving, we had to go, and I hightailed it straight out of there without purchasing anything I had in my cart.  Actually, I never had any trouble at all in stores or restaurants--just fun--until Annie.  I hate to say it, but if there is a cog in the wheel of our family plans, you can bet Annie put it there!  Anyway, she is an original, at least in our family.  I welcome any unschooling advice, for dealing with her, because I have found nothing that really consistently works.  And I don&#39;t know what to do about all this hitting and kicking of the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my one year old is starting to be very aggressive when he&#39;s frustrated.  He hits and he bites...hard.  He drew blood on me the other day.  I know some of it is because he is getting his one year molars, but he clearly bites when he is being thwarted in some way.  I usually deal with it by moving him away from me if he is biting me, and saying, &quot;biting hurts.&quot;  I do the same when he is biting the kids.  I will say that it is interesting that Annie is getting a bit of her own medicine, though she has never really been a biter (thank goodness!)  The other day, she actually had three visible bite marks on her.  And he is driven to pull her hair when she is watching a movie or is otherwise occupied.  It helps that I can show her that I won&#39;t let Evan keep biting her and pulling her hair, just like I won&#39;t let her hit and push him.  I think it is helping her to have something else to think about in relation to what she does.  Does that make sense?  Anyway, if there is something else I can do to help them all to learn to treat each other better, I welcome the ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-908407417">Hi. I don&#39;t post here too often because my DD is only 14 months old, but <br/>
we are committed to unschooling. I read the list as much as I can in <br/>
between chasing her around. She didn&#39;t crawl until 10 months and didn&#39;t <br/>
walk until 13 but she has always managed to be quite a handful, no <br/>
matter how mobile she was at the time. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to hear that your kids are frustrating you so much. It must <br/>
be difficult to deal with that sort of behavior and keep your patience. <br/>
I send you hugs and soothing vibes.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say that while I don&#39;t have experience dealing with <br/>
these issues with a 3 or 4 y.o. I did have some problems with DD hitting <br/>
and biting (me) over the past few months and got some great advice at an <br/>
AP discipline group that was just started recently.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you consider your style attachment parenting but the <br/>
more experienced parents in that group really helped me with my issues <br/>
and maybe could help you too. You could just post that exact same <br/>
message that you already wrote (I know it&#39;s hard to find time to write <br/>
with one kid, let alone 3) and see what they say.<br/>

<br/>
I just have to say that as I read your post, my head literally began to<br/>
swim.  It was like you were talking very loud and very fast with tremendous<br/>
energy.<br/>
<br/>
I may be way off base here but my guess would be that your house is feeling<br/>
that way right now.  Breathe deep.  Meditate or something.  Make a smoothie.<br/>
Whatever but calm down.  Your kids cannot calm down until you do.<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Hitting, Biting, etc... (longish)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Argh!!  My children are acting like beasts on a daily basis lately!<br/>
Stella, the 4 yo, screams bloody murder at Annie, the 3 yo (wonder where she<br/>
got that...sigh), but usually doesn&#39;t physically hurt anyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Annie, my almost 3.5 yo, has always been a bit brutish towards people for<br/>
no apparent reason.  She is often very sweet and loving as well, but for<br/>
some reason, she will haul off and hit or kick Stella, the 4 yo, for no<br/>
apparent reason, or she&#39;ll poke her in the eyes, just because. (Sometimes<br/>
the reason is apparent--Stella has been annoying her in some way, but there<br/>
are definitely many times when Annie just gets a wild a hair and hurts<br/>
Stella or the baby.)  She has been doing this alot lately for whatever<br/>
reason--oh, I&#39;m sure there is one, but it&#39;s still not okay.  Just now, she<br/>
slapped Stella hard in the face.  She did the same thing last night and<br/>
yesterday afternoon.  Yesterday in the bathtub, she kicked her repeatedly in<br/>
the neck and head, while I was changing the baby&#39;s diaper.  This morning,<br/>
after removing her from the scene (they were all playing with blocks in the<br/>
bedroom), and telling her that I will not allow her to hurt Stella, I asked<br/>
her why she hit her.  She smiled and said, &quot;I just wanted to.&quot;  She was<br/>
using this &quot;little miss innocent, aren&#39;t I funny?&quot; voice that she uses for<br/>
just this sort of occasion.  I don&#39;t like it at all.  I didn&#39;t let her go<br/>
back in to play for a little while.  I told her that when she hurts the<br/>
other kids, I have to protect them by removing her until I trust she can<br/>
play without hurting anyone. I was quite stern with her. When I did let her<br/>
go back in after about 2 minutes, she wasted no time jumping on Evan, the 13<br/>
mo old, and wouldn&#39;t let him up!  ARGH!  I brought her back out, explaining<br/>
again, that it&#39;s not okay for her to hurt the other kids.  I again told her<br/>
that I am her mommy and also Stella and Evan&#39;s mommy, and I won&#39;t allow<br/>
anyone to hurt any of them, including her.  She bellowed at the top of her<br/>
lungs and strenuously resisted her removal and pitched a serious fit while<br/>
in my company.  Finally she calmed down, and I hugged her and told her she<br/>
could play again, but would be removed if she hurt anyone.  Now I am<br/>
wondering when it will happen again, because my experience tells me that it<br/>
will, and probably very soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, Annie is the most difficult to raise of all my children.  She is<br/>
as cute as can be (actually looks like some renaissance painting of a<br/>
cherub--she&#39;s chubby with rosy cheeks, big blue eyes and curly golden hair)<br/>
and  she&#39;s very lovey, huggy, and also very imaginative.  She is very good<br/>
at creating her own entertainment, even with just her fingers to animate.  I<br/>
love her dearly, of course. She is, however, VERY contrary and stubborn.<br/>
She does everything in her own way and time. She first crawled when she was<br/>
13 months old.  She first walked at 18 mos.  Didn&#39;t really trying talking in<br/>
earnest until she was close to turning 3.  Not only did she not seem ready,<br/>
but she seemed to prefer just yelling and making awful noises.  She is still<br/>
deciding whether she wants to use the toilet or her pants, though,<br/>
thankfully, she seems to be choosing the toilet more. (Always refused to use<br/>
the little potty, even though she is very short compared to other kids her<br/>
age.)  Before I had her, I thought I had a handle on most parenting issues.<br/>
HA!  She challenges almost everything at some point.  She is and always has<br/>
been extremely difficult to redirect.  Used to be she wouldn&#39;t let you hold<br/>
her when she was angry, but would freak out when you put her down.  (She&#39;s<br/>
grown out of that for the most part, though, and welcomes my hugs when she<br/>
is upset now.) She would fuss and kick me hard all night when I was still<br/>
nursing her, digging her toes into my thighs when she was still sleeping<br/>
with me, but would yell and yell if I tried to get her to sleep elsewhere.<br/>
She is unusually loud, too.  More than once, someone from several houses<br/>
away has come to my door to see if &quot;everything was okay.&quot;  We laugh about<br/>
it, especially now, but man, she was and is a trip!  She is the only child<br/>
that has actually embarrased me enough that I left a store (a thrift store<br/>
at that!) without getting what I went in for! I wouldn&#39;t let her play with a<br/>
broken glass vase, and she went ballistic.  She started yelling so loudly it<br/>
actually startled me and several other shoppers who looked over in<br/>
amazement, and then she smacked me hard, right in the face, in front of them<br/>
all.  The two older ladies shopping the same aisle were astonished.  I<br/>
actually stayed quite calm,  I held her hands to keep her from doing it<br/>
again (she was trying), told Stella I was sorry but because of the way Annie<br/>
was behaving, we had to go, and I hightailed it straight out of there<br/>
without purchasing anything I had in my cart.  Actually, I never had any<br/>
trouble at all in stores or restaurants--just fun--until Annie.  I hate to<br/>
say it, but if there is a cog in the wheel of our family plans, you can bet<br/>
Annie put it there!  Anyway, she is an original, at least in our family.  I<br/>
welcome any unschooling advice, for dealing with her, because I have found<br/>
nothing that really consistently works.  And I don&#39;t know what to do about<br/>
all this hitting and kicking of the other kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, my one year old is starting to be very aggressive when he&#39;s<br/>
frustrated.  He hits and he bites...hard.  He drew blood on me the other<br/>
day.  I know some of it is because he is getting his one year molars, but he<br/>
clearly bites when he is being thwarted in some way.  I usually deal with it<br/>
by moving him away from me if he is biting me, and saying, &quot;biting hurts.&quot;<br/>
I do the same when he is biting the kids.  I will say that it is interesting<br/>
that Annie is getting a bit of her own medicine, though she has never really<br/>
been a biter (thank goodness!)  The other day, she actually had three<br/>
visible bite marks on her.  And he is driven to pull her hair when she is<br/>
watching a movie or is otherwise occupied.  It helps that I can show her<br/>
that I won&#39;t let Evan keep biting her and pulling her hair, just like I<br/>
won&#39;t let her hit and push him.  I think it is helping her to have something<br/>
else to think about in relation to what she does.  Does that make sense?<br/>
Anyway, if there is something else I can do to help them all to learn to<br/>
treat each other better, I welcome the ideas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for reading this long post.<br/>

<br/>
**parenthesis mine--Andrea<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have read Siblings Without Rivalry and How to Talk so Your Kids Will<br/>
Listen, and How to Listen so Your Kids<br/>
Will Talk.  They were helpful.  I think I will look at them again.  Maybe<br/>
I&#39;m forgetting something that I could be doing.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; engaged in something more fun than fighting, I believe you will see<br/>
&gt; them having fun instead.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is true that when we are out and about, either at the beach or out<br/>
hiking, or at the library or wherever and they are having fun, they don&#39;t<br/>
fight.  I do have to stay home some days and clean up some so we can enjoy<br/>
our home.  On those days, there is lots of bickering.  Also--and I think<br/>
that this is part of why I&#39;m finding things so overwhelming lately--my<br/>
youngest is really getting around well now, and into EVERYTHING.  I now<br/>
cannot have any chairs at the dining room table, unless we are eating or<br/>
someone is already sitting in them, because he will climb up there over and<br/>
over again, relentlessly!  He also wants to make art with the girls, but<br/>
always ends up eating the supplies.  Now that he&#39;s able to get up on the<br/>
table so easily, they are having a hard time finding a place to create that<br/>
he can&#39;t interrupt.  I have to keep after him and console him when he is<br/>
thwarted yet again!  Plus, Annie is still peeing on the floor (or the bed,<br/>
or the chairs and her clothes) every other day.  Just when I think she&#39;s got<br/>
it under control, she decides she doesn&#39;t want to bother again and just pees<br/>
where she is.  Ugh...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess I&#39;m just frustrated because things are intense right now,<br/>
and I can&#39;t catch a break.  There hasn&#39;t been a really calm day at home for<br/>
quite awhile.  Guess I need to wait for the cycle to come around again to a<br/>
time of more equilibrium!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I find that after I post that I feel bad, because it seems like<br/>
I&#39;m bashing my kids behind their backs to total strangers.  Yet I find that<br/>
I need to talk, because I get so caught up in the experience that I can&#39;t<br/>
think straight.  I do want to say that I also have ALOT of fun with my kids.<br/>
They are funny and interesting.  They are beautiful and full of life and<br/>
energy.  Many times during the day, they do nice things for me and for each<br/>
other.  Sometimes I am amazed at the things they do to help each other!  And<br/>
they show me so much about the world, sometimes things that I hadn&#39;t thought<br/>
of before.  Sometime when I&#39;m not feeling so overwhelmed by parenthood, I&#39;ll<br/>
post  about why I so enjoy being with them and wouldn&#39;t want it any other<br/>
way!<br/>

==Hi Andrea,<br/>
<br/>
I just have to say that as I read your post, my head literally began to<br/>
swim.  It was like you were talking very loud and very fast with tremendous<br/>
energy.<br/>
<br/>
I may be way off base here but my guess would be that your house is feeling<br/>
that way right now.  Breathe deep.  Meditate or something.  Make a smoothie.<br/>
Whatever but calm down.  Your kids cannot calm down until you do.==<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what to say, because it is certain that I don&#39;t feel very calm.<br/>
On the other hand, it&#39;s not for lack of trying.  I&#39;m actually a very calm<br/>
person for the most part--never had high blood pressure at any checkup, love<br/>
to lounge with a good book, never stay mad long.  I do get upset, and it can<br/>
be explosive (loud and energetic), but I calm down quickly and relaxing<br/>
isn&#39;t really a problem for me normally.  Problem is, my children have lately<br/>
kept me from relaxing at all (unintentionally, of course.)  If I sit down<br/>
with a cup of tea after playing with them or serving lunch and cleaning the<br/>
kitchen, I can&#39;t even finish it without getting up several times to deal<br/>
with something.  I don&#39;t suppose that this is unsual for a mother with 3<br/>
young children, and I guess that&#39;s the crux of it.  I&#39;m thinking that unless<br/>
I can come up with some money for an occasional sitter or mother&#39;s helper,<br/>
then this is it for awhile.  I can&#39;t tell you how much I wish I could truly<br/>
relax for a WHOLE day! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sorry to overwhelm everyone with my long and intense post.  I&#39;m kind<br/>
of embarrassed now.  Oh well, I&#39;m embarrassed even when I&#39;m all alone with<br/>
myself.  I hear this voice in my head, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?  Breathe.<br/>
How can this be so hard?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675745756">I have a 16 y/o girl come to play for two hours once or twice a week, <br/>
$10 for two hours. I can live without many other things in order to <br/>
have her come help me remain sane. I need the time too. You need the <br/>
time. If it is important to have some time for yourself you need to <br/>
create it. <br/>
<br/>
I have found that trying to &quot;have time for myself&quot; while doing the <br/>
full time mama job makes me feel stretched too far. It works better <br/>
for me to have a little uninterrupted time. When I am on duty, mama <br/>
doesn&#39;t get time for Pat. It sets Pat up for failure when mama is on <br/>
duty. Make time for Andrea instead of trying to steal it all day and <br/>
being frustrated. Three little ones can&#39;t wait, so it is a self-<br/>
defeating proposition if you don&#39;t refill your reserves occasionally <br/>
with time &quot;off&quot; by yourself. So, someone needs to be &quot;on duty&quot; for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
You are evidently an extrovert who thinks out loud. I know this is <br/>
cathartic and helpful for you to work through this process. I am the <br/>
same way. My friends helped me to learn to care for myself. You need <br/>
to do the same.<br/>

I had three in a five and a half year span.<br/>

Today they were all out of the house at same time for a while, all in <br/>
different places.  It was very quiet.  Now Kirby&#39;s birthday party is in progress.  <br/>
There are 20+ people, 16 of them playing Halo on a web of four TVs, and the <br/>

It did seem, when I had two in diapers, that I would never have any quiet or <br/>

<br/>
I have a fantasy that comforts me sometimes.  I wish for Sundays childless, <br/>
Monday infant, Tuesday a toddler, Wednesday a six year old...  Older through <br/>

childless.  Then infant...    and somewhere in here I&#39;ll have all adults and <br/>
it will be over.  But it seems so long, and in each phase it gets kind of old, <br/>

<br/>
Sandra, thank you for this post.  I appreciate the thought that went into<br/>
it, and seemingly all of the things you post.<br/>
<br/>
My mil who had her first three  children all within a year of each other,<br/>
was concerned about me when I told her I was pregnant with the last baby.<br/>
She told me that the one thing that really helped her get through those<br/>
early years was to repeat to herself that &quot;this won&#39;t last forever.&quot;  It<br/>
seems so simple, yet, I often find myself grasping for that very mantra.<br/>
Your post, while essentially saying the same thing, added that gentle<br/>
reminder that I will miss these years too, so I should enjoy what I can<br/>
while it&#39;s here.  I know this!  My oldest is 15, but he is so independent<br/>
and has chosen to live with his dad in Alaska.  I miss the little golden boy<br/>
who was my constant companion, even while I have these new little<br/>
companions.  To be reminded in such a beautiful way...well, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought:  My mil has 5 kids.  The first three and then 10 years<br/>
later, my husband, and THEN 8 years after that, her youngest daughter.  She<br/>
tells me all the time, that there were times when it was so hard, but that<br/>
she loves her big family and how much fun it was/is.  I look forward to my<br/>
family enjoying things together too as my children grow up.<br/>

&gt; ==Hi Andrea,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just have to say that as I read your post, my head literally began to<br/>
&gt; swim.  It was like you were talking very loud and very fast with<br/>
tremendous<br/>
&gt; energy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I may be way off base here but my guess would be that your house is<br/>
feeling<br/>
&gt; that way right now.  Breathe deep.  Meditate or something.  Make a<br/>
smoothie.<br/>
&gt; Whatever but calm down.  Your kids cannot calm down until you do.==<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure what to say, because it is certain that I don&#39;t feel very<br/>
calm.<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, it&#39;s not for lack of trying.  I&#39;m actually a very calm<br/>
&gt; person for the most part--never had high blood pressure at any checkup,<br/>
love<br/>
&gt; to lounge with a good book, never stay mad long.  I do get upset, and it<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; be explosive (loud and energetic), but I calm down quickly and relaxing<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t really a problem for me normally.  Problem is, my children have<br/>
lately<br/>
&gt; kept me from relaxing at all (unintentionally, of course.)  If I sit down<br/>
&gt; with a cup of tea after playing with them or serving lunch and cleaning<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; kitchen, I can&#39;t even finish it without getting up several times to deal<br/>
&gt; with something.  I don&#39;t suppose that this is unsual for a mother with 3<br/>
&gt; young children, and I guess that&#39;s the crux of it.  I&#39;m thinking that<br/>
unless<br/>
&gt; I can come up with some money for an occasional sitter or mother&#39;s helper,<br/>
&gt; then this is it for awhile.  I can&#39;t tell you how much I wish I could<br/>
truly<br/>
&gt; relax for a WHOLE day! LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, sorry to overwhelm everyone with my long and intense post.  I&#39;m<br/>
kind<br/>
&gt; of embarrassed now.  Oh well, I&#39;m embarrassed even when I&#39;m all alone with<br/>
&gt; myself.  I hear this voice in my head, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?  Breathe.<br/>
&gt; How can this be so hard?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998734677">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the sentiment.  I have also slipped outside to breathe fresh air<br/>
and try to regain calm.  I often have to rush back in because I hear<br/>
screaming and crying, most of the time that is a help.  Plus, my kids seem<br/>
to know, if they&#39;ve realized I&#39;ve stepped out to calm down, that it&#39;s time<br/>
for everyone to take a breath.  Not always, but this does happen.  Perhaps<br/>
if I practice it more often.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Andrea<br/>

I have  experienced some aggresssion with my son hitting me. He is 11 <br/>
years  old.  Since my husband and I are vegetarians, and we allow him <br/>
to  make his own choices when we are out, he eats meat sometimes.  I  <br/>
discovered that, on the day after he has had a lot of meat, he is <br/>
much  more aggressive and even combative. When he is on a strictly <br/>
vegetarian  diet, he is very calm and cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
No matter what may have caused his actions, there is no cause ever for you  <br/>
to accept hitting from a child as old as 11.  No one should hit anyone  ever.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope you find out what is really causing it.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is true that when we are out and about, either at the beach or out<br/>
hiking, or at the library or wherever and they are having fun, they don&#39;t<br/>
fight.  I do have to stay home some days and clean up some so we can enjoy<br/>
our home.  On those days, there is lots of bickering.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never really realized it until now, but that&#39;s how it is in my home<br/>
also. I will have to give alot of thought to this! Start making life more<br/>
fun for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also--and I think that this is part of why I&#39;m finding things so<br/>
overwhelming lately--my youngest is really getting around well now, and into<br/>
EVERYTHING.  I now cannot have any chairs at the dining room table, unless<br/>
we are eating or someone is already sitting in them, because he will climb<br/>
up there over and over again, relentlessly!  He also wants to make art with<br/>
the girls, but always ends up eating the supplies.  Now that he&#39;s able to<br/>
get up on the table so easily, they are having a hard time finding a place<br/>
to create that he can&#39;t interrupt.  I have to keep after him and console him<br/>
when he is thwarted yet again!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh wow, that is about my biggest problem also! My youngest is 21 months and<br/>
she is up on the table if my back is turned. I have to bring her to the<br/>
bathroom with me so she doesn&#39;t crack her head! Sometimes the oldest will<br/>
color with her, but the &quot;colors&quot; end up being eaten, like yours :o) Some of<br/>
them are so much work, aren&#39;t they! I had no idea a toddler could be so<br/>
exhausting, my first two weren&#39;t. Third time&#39;s the charm and all that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes I find that after I post that I feel bad, because it seems like<br/>
I&#39;m bashing my kids behind their backs to total strangers.  Yet I find that<br/>
I need to talk, because I get so caught up in the experience that I can&#39;t<br/>
think straight.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is important to talk about it, and get help sorting it all out in your<br/>
head! I don&#39;t do it enough really, my family thinks I should spank to solve<br/>
the problems (that or send them to school) and that I should go to work.<br/>
Being a houseslob just isn&#39;t healthy you know lol. You shouldn&#39;t feel bad or<br/>
guilty at all...do you think your kids will speak of you in positive terms<br/>
their whole lives? ;o)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I do want to say that I also have ALOT of fun with my kids. They are funny<br/>
and interesting.  They are beautiful and full of life and energy.  Many<br/>
times during the day, they do nice things for me and for each other.<br/>
Sometimes I am amazed at the things they do to help each other!  And they<br/>
show me so much about the world, sometimes things that I hadn&#39;t thought of<br/>
before.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by my kids, too, really you just said most of<br/>
what I&#39;d say to describe them (funny, beautiful,...)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometime when I&#39;m not feeling so overwhelmed by parenthood, I&#39;ll post<br/>
about why I so enjoy being with them and wouldn&#39;t want it any other way!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and save the post to read on a bad day :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It just is. I remember. Try reminding yourself that you&#39;re lucky to be <br/>
interrupted by your active, healthy, inquisitive, energetic kids. I <br/>
don&#39;t mean this as a criticism - not saying you should not complain <br/>
because others have it worse, or anything like that. I&#39;m saying to try, <br/>
specifically, to say say specific words to yourself at the moment that <br/>
you&#39;re being stressed by the kids&#39; behavior. Right then, at that <br/>
moment, say to yourself, &quot;I have healthy, inquisitive, <br/>
energetic....kids.&quot; Self-talk is important. Use it to get yourself over <br/>
the rougher times - don&#39;t allow it to make rough times even rougher.<br/>
