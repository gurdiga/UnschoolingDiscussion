Jackie is in the kitchen drinking lemonade with two of her friends.  I have a USA map and a WA state map hanging on the wall.  Keely, age 9, asked, &quot;Isn&#39;t Michigan supposed to be yellow?&quot;  I asked her why that should be so and she said because that&#39;s what color it is on the map at school.<br/>
