OUT TO DINNER MATHEMATICS<br/>
<br/>
This is pretty neat how it works out.<br/>
DON&#39;T CHEAT BY SCROLLING DOWN FIRST<br/>
It takes less than a minute.......<br/>
Work this out as you read.<br/>
Don&#39;t cheat and read the bottom until you&#39;ve worked through it!<br/>
<br/>
This is fun!<br/>
<br/>
1. First of all, pick the number of times a week that you would like to<br/>
have dinner out. (try for more than once but less than 10)<br/>
<br/>
2. Multiply this number by 2 (Just to be bold)<br/>
<br/>
3. Add 5. (for Sunday)<br/>
<br/>
4. Multiply it by 50 - I&#39;ll wait while you get the<br/>
calculator................<br/>
<br/>
5. If you have already had your birthday this year add 1753.... If you<br/>
haven&#39;t, add 1752..........<br/>
<br/>
6. Now subtract the four digit year that you were born.<br/>
<br/>
You should have a three digit number ..<br/>
<br/>
The first digit of this was your original number<br/>
<br/>
(I.e., how many times you want to have eat out each week.)<br/>
<br/>
The next two numbers are...<br/>
<br/>
YOUR AGE! (Oh YES, it IS!!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS THE ONLY YEAR (2003) IT WILL EVER WORK, SO SPREAD IT AROUND<br/>
WHILE IT LASTS. IMPRESSIVE, ISN&#39;T IT?<br/>

<br/>
Though strictly speaking, this one will only work for 2003, you can make it<br/>
work for any year if you just increment 1753/1752 each year. (It&#39;s not<br/>
coincidence that 2003 and 1753 both end in 3.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>((EatOut x 2) + 5) x 50<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just a tricky way of multiplying the number of times you want to eat<br/>
out by 100. In other words, it will move the number of times you want to eat<br/>
out over to the hundreds position. So if you want to eat out 4 time a week,<br/>
you&#39;ll end up with 400 (plus some extra that gets subtracted off later).<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s really:<br/>
<br/>
((Eatout x 2) x 50) + 5 x 50) =<br/>
(Eatout x 100) + 250<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 5. If you have already had your birthday this year add 1753.... If you<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t, add 1752..........<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 6. Now subtract the four digit year that you were born.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All this does is subtract your birth year from 2003. Notice that if you add<br/>
250 (the extra number added to (Eatout x 100)) to 1753 you get ... 2003.<br/>
<br/>
(Eatout x 100) + ((250 + 1753) - 1956)<br/>
<br/>
or (Eatout x 100) + 2003-1956 :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641449148">My daughter and I had such a fun time with this!  It took her about two <br/>
hours to find the formula but she was SO proud when she figured out the <br/>
&#39;trick&#39;. &lt;bg&gt;  She called two of her friends and they all worked it out <br/>
together on three-way.  If only word problems were more like THIS when I was <br/>
in  school! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367427732">They weren&#39;t like that because you had to do a WHOLE page of them and <br/>
you HAD to get them done in one night, combined with assignments from <br/>
other subjects.  I remember doing math in highschool and actually <br/>
thinking to myself, &quot;This might actually be fun, but there must be <br/>
something wrong with me because I need a WHOLE lot longer to really <br/>
think these problems through so that I can REALLY understand them&quot;.  <br/>
I wanted a deeper understanding of the math I was doing and assuming <br/>
that everyone else had it.  <br/>

Thank you Joyce for the *simple* explanantion! (I don&#39;t know math much past <br/>
the basics. Probably because my dad would hover over me, smacking me hard on <br/>
the head when I gave a wrong answer to the time-table flash cards he was <br/>
holding in front of me. I&#39;ve run screaming from math ever since.)     <br/>
