<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636500846">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
Need some input... I went to my library this morning and talked to the Branch <br/>
Manager who was wonderful..  I told her there were no books on unschooling <br/>
and 7 on homeschooling and she asked me if I could suggest some. She said <br/>
they had plenty of money in their budget for those books.  I quickly whipped <br/>
out my copy of The Unschooling Handbook and she ordered it from Amazon.com as <br/>
we were talking.  She asked me if there were anymore I could recommend.  I <br/>
could only think of the Colfax&#39;s book and didn&#39;t know if that was unschooling <br/>
or homeschooling.  Anyway she ordered that.<br/>
<br/>
I told her about the unschooling loop and she asked me to ask you for <br/>
recommendations of unschooling books.  She is more than willing to buy <br/>
several more books if I can give her the names and authors...<br/>
<br/>
So please let me have the names of books that you guys would recommend for <br/>
people who are insterested in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
