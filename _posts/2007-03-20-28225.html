<br/>
I&#39;m using this post as a jumping-off point for a discussion I&#39;ve wanted<br/>
to have with unschoolers for a long time:<br/>
<br/>
How do we unschool kids with learning disabilities/differences, autism,<br/>
dyslexia, sensory integration problems, etc.?  If it&#39;s the school which<br/>
often identifies these problems, and we never send our kids, how do we<br/>
know if they&#39;re just following their own timetable, or if they need<br/>
some kind of intervention?  What happens if we miss a developmental<br/>
window?  Are there truly such things?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked on the edges of these issues for a few years now, in my<br/>
capacity as a volunteer with therapeutic horseback riding programs.<br/>
I&#39;ve talked to lots of parents whose kids suffer in mainstream classes<br/>
or special ed., yet they often find the idea of homeschooling appalling<br/>
because they have enough trouble as it is.  Unschooling is simply<br/>
beyond their capacity to consider, and frankly, I don&#39;t know if it<br/>
would be helpful for their kids.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I have no idea what, if anything, is &quot;wrong&quot; with the child<br/>
described above, and that&#39;s my point -- the parent who wrote doesn&#39;t,<br/>
either, and has chosen to ask this list.  Can anyone here shed light on<br/>
the problem (other than suggesting we not view our unique children as<br/>
&quot;problems&quot; ;-) ?  Would professional evaluation be helpful to the<br/>
child?  Would that open the door to all kinds of problems, legal or<br/>
otherwise, for the family?<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you live your lives as if school did not exist, what would they look <br/>
like?<br/>
<br/>
If there were no &quot;standards&quot; to judge children by, who would seem <br/>
abnormal?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, some children are different---VERY different from the norm. But if <br/>
you treat EACH child as an individual ---each with his own strengths, <br/>
WHY would that be an issue? I have a &quot;normal&quot; (by all societal <br/>
measures---not ADHD, not autistic, not aspie, not ODD, not delayed in <br/>
any way) 11 year old son. Can&#39;t ride a bike and can&#39;t tie his shoes. He <br/>
fell trying to ride when he was four and has had zero interest since <br/>
them. Has always had velcro shoes or slip-ons. Is he developmentally <br/>
delayed? Because he doesn&#39;t ride a bike or tie bows?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t ride a bike. Used to, not any more. I only own one pair of <br/>
lace-up shoes. Problem?<br/>
<br/>
Each and every one of us is unique. Some do things faster and/or better <br/>
than others. Some are slower and/or not as good as others. It&#39;s truly <br/>
ALL OK!<br/>
<br/>
I definitely think that unschooling children who are considered <br/>
&quot;behind&quot; or &quot;different&quot; is ZILLIONZ times better than sending them to a <br/>
&quot;life-in-a-box&quot; existence where everything they say or do is criticized <br/>
or corrected by experts. At home with folks who love and honor <br/>
them---and most importantly, who accept them how and for who they <br/>
are!--- they will have many more opportunities to thrive and become <br/>
they best persons they can be!<br/>
<br/>
Schools dont&#39; want &#39;em---not really. I mean: the schools may love the <br/>
extra $$$, but these children can be extremely disruptive. They never <br/>
feel wanted there. How can you feel worthy if you don&#39;t even feel <br/>
wanted???<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a BETTER place than with loving parents who understand <br/>
and work with your strengths. We ALL have something to share---even <br/>
those with &quot;problems.&quot;<br/>

dyslexia, for instance; if we ignore the fact a child is &quot;behind&quot; in <br/>

<br/>
This is NOT to say the schools are the answer -- far from it.  It&#39;s <br/>
just something that&#39;s rattled around in my head for a few years, <br/>
prompted by discussions with parents of kids in the riding programs.  <br/>
Many of those kids are in very intensive therapies; for some, riding <br/>
was their one break in the week, and even that was done for therapeutic <br/>
reasons.  The parents are convinced the kids need all of it, but is <br/>
there a home/unschooling alternative?   (Of course, for some, the time <br/>
a child is with the &quot;expert&quot; is the only break they get from what can <br/>
be a very stressful relationship, and the thought of having that child <br/>
24/7 is appalling.  The usual response I get when a parent learns I <br/>
homeschool is &quot;Oh, my god, I could never do that!  You&#39;re such a <br/>
saint!&quot; or similar.)<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I&#39;ve worked with pretty extreme cases of autism, cerebral palsy, <br/>
fetal alcohol syndrome, etc., but also with kids whose reason for <br/>
admission to the program were primarily learning disabilities such as <br/>
dyslexia or ADHD.  The former I would imagine were identified by their <br/>
pediatricians, and would have had appropriate intervention, but the <br/>
latter were most likely recognized by teachers or parents.<br/>

since she&#39;s at home, with no pressure, no one making fun that she <br/>

even suggest learning to read. Kids decide everything in their day there,<br/>
and year after year kids just start to read when they&#39;re ready, and some<br/>
kids are 12 before they decide it is time. If all children were left to<br/>
their own devices, maybe dyslexia would never even exist. I think it is a<br/>
possibility.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923429077">&lt;Listen, engage with, support, enrich,<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is the point, in all of this, to me.  In order for a parent to<br/>
unschool, they need to be tuned in with their child and doing all they can<br/>
to meet their needs. (not trying to catch them up with other kids but meet<br/>
them where they are, where ever that might be)  There might be something a<br/>
parent can learn from professionals who have dealt with similar issues with<br/>
kids, but most often if the child isn&#39;t in the school setting and being<br/>
expected to be on the same level as the other kids his age, then where ever<br/>
he is shouldn&#39;t be an issue.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Some kids with differences are parented by parents who are very disconnected<br/>
from them.  They have no idea what to do or how to engage them, or they just<br/>
choose not to. ??   I saw one example of this on a reality show (super nanny<br/>
or one similar) and sadly I&#39;ve seen it in real life too in my own extended<br/>
family.  They had a child with speech issues (and he was slightly autistic<br/>
too, I think) but they did nothing to engage him at all.  The nanny had a<br/>
speech therapist come to help him but she also had the parents sit down and<br/>
play a board game with him and actually talk to him and this was the first<br/>
time the parents had ever played a board game with their 6 or 7 year old,<br/>
though he was quite capable and he really enjoyed it.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It seemed like (and who knows how they edited it) he was never engaged with<br/>
them in speech in a close and personal way in which he might naturally learn<br/>
to annunciate correctly.  They did their adult thing and he played with his<br/>
siblings or alone.  There was no personal interaction.  It doesn&#39;t seem like<br/>
an unschooling parent would be in this position if they had their child&#39;s<br/>
best interests at heart.  Hopefully they would have been engaging him since<br/>
he was a baby and he would have learned to annunciate correctly in time on<br/>
his own.   Maybe not at the same speed as other 6 year olds but at the speed<br/>
that this child was capable of learning. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so hard to speculate when there isn&#39;t a real concern about a real child<br/>
though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know; without special training or a lot of research, how would <br/>
a parent know?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you an example from my own life:  No one, not teachers or <br/>
parents, realized I was nearsighted.  I started having trouble seeing <br/>
in third grade; for over a year, I was unable to read the blackboard.  <br/>
I&#39;d be asked to answer a math problem, for instance, and see an 8 <br/>
instead of a 3, answer incorrectly, and be ridiculed by teacher and <br/>
class alike.  It was about then that I gave up on school.<br/>
<br/>
Even at home, when I&#39;d scoot closer to the TV, I&#39;d be admonished to <br/>
move back; my &quot;but I can&#39;t see it&quot; was ignored.  It wasn&#39;t until we <br/>
were in the car one day and I couldn&#39;t see the billboard everyone else <br/>
had noticed that anyone began to consider I might really NOT be able to <br/>
see.  When I got my first pair of glasses -- after the school did eye <br/>
tests in fourth grade -- my mom was properly mortified by my excitement <br/>
over seeing all those road signs I didn&#39;t know were there.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a simple thing, really, compared to some &quot;disabilities.&quot;  <br/>
Lately, I&#39;ve wondered about a math related learning disability called <br/>
dyscalculia -- do I have some kind of LD, or am I just stupid, as I was <br/>
taught?  Could some kind of intervention have helped -- and would that <br/>
intervention have started with removing me from the school environment? <br/>
  Like the example below of dyslexia at Sudbury, would I have had <br/>
problems with math if I had never gone to school?  (That, btw, was my <br/>
reason for not doing formal math with my kids at home.  My 19 y.o. <br/>
daughter struggled through a college basic math class last fall and <br/>
passed; she also decided she hates school and refused to enroll for <br/>
another semester.)<br/>

enlightening discussion with people who no doubt have, collectively, <br/>
more experience than I.  I&#39;m happy to say I&#39;m getting it :-)  Thanks!<br/>

help in a timely fashion?  What if the help is something as simple as <br/>
glasses?  My parents weren&#39;t stupid or inattentive -- they had never <br/>
been nearsighted themselves, had never known a family member who was -- <br/>
they just didn&#39;t know how to identify the problem.<br/>

severe, though, that it impacted the rest of their lives, not just <br/>
reading.  Difficulty reading was just a diagnostic tool with them.  The <br/>
horseback riding helps greatly, as following directions while riding <br/>
provides immediate feedback in a fun way -- if the instructor says <br/>
&quot;turn right, then weave the poles&quot; and you go left and find no poles... <br/>
;-)  These are kids who will never be able to drive, possibly never <br/>
live on their own, etc.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; child?&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Behind what? Who decides what and when is &quot;behind&quot;. These are the <br/>
&gt; questions<br/>
&gt; that pop up for me when I read this sentence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, me too, trust me!  I&#39;m relaying the questions people have asked <br/>
*me.*<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can assure you that the<br/>
&gt; standards set in most people&#39;s minds of when a child should be reading<br/>
&gt; originated from a person&#39;s best guess based on partial information. <br/>
&gt; And from<br/>
&gt; there, suddenly all children who aren&#39;t reading by 8 are &quot;behind&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Many of those kids are in very intensive therapies;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a child that some people would say I was negligent with for not<br/>
&gt; engaging in all these therapies. I thank God we didn&#39;t jump onto that<br/>
&gt; bandwagon!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for some, riding<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; was their one break in the week,&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So sad.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No kidding.  There was one boy who would show up, right from a full day <br/>
at school,  so stressed out!  We&#39;d make sure he had a fun, relaxing <br/>
time.  Another went from bowling to riding to tennis to baseball, all <br/>
on the same Saturday, every week.  He was really competitive!  He&#39;d <br/>
lash out at his horse if he lost a game in class; it took quite a bit <br/>
to help him understand the rider&#39;s maxim: It&#39;s never the horse&#39;s fault. <br/>
  That alone was worthwhile for him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The parents are convinced the kids need all of it, but is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; there a home/unschooling alternative?&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even in the cases of children who are away from &quot;the norm&quot;, the <br/>
&gt; principles<br/>
&gt; of unschooling remain. Listen, engage with, support, enrich,<br/>
&gt; appreciate...know your children. And maybe an outside source of help <br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; does seem to be a good thing, as long as it is not a decision based on<br/>
&gt; parent anxiety. Start with what the child would love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453829112">&quot;Without special training or a lot of research, how would a parent <br/>
know?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IMHO - There are no people more specially trained than those who <br/>
gestate (in the womb or heart) and raise their children.  In our <br/>
faith, we call this the priesthood of motherhood.  Consulting experts <br/>
and making use of their gifts is one thing.  Letting an expert <br/>
institution define who our children are as human beings is quite <br/>
another.  How a parent could not notice is beyond me.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;and be ridiculed by teacher and class alike&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry about your vision and math experiences!  It&#39;s SO unfair, <br/>
grrrr!! Perhaps if your parents and you had been taught to express <br/>
and investigate your discomforts and cognitive limits - rather than <br/>
rely on the experts in school to alert of problems - it would have <br/>
been different?  Again, I don&#39;t know just ideas.  You made it <br/>
different for your daughter though and that is laudable! <br/>
<br/>
&quot;for some, riding was their one break in the week&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have pondered this since your post because I worked with horses for <br/>
years.  When I was at the stable we had SO many mentally & <br/>
developmentally &quot;disabled&quot; clients (child and adult) that riding with <br/>
them was just a normal part of our day.  I have seen many labels and <br/>
many ends of their respective spectrums but my experiences were <br/>
positive.<br/>
<br/>
So it made me wonder - Was it because we just served caring people <br/>
who took their &quot;disabled&quot; children, parents, siblings, friends, etc. <br/>
riding because it brought them joy? Rather than putting them in a <br/>
a &quot;therapy program&quot;? I don&#39;t know..I&#39;m not questioning your program, <br/>
I think what you do is so wonderful, horses are special creatures <br/>
with an uncanny ability to reach and comfort people in pain.  I&#39;ve <br/>
heard dolphins are the same way.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;primarily learning disabilities such as dyslexia or ADHD.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have heard many contend that these disorders are grossly over-<br/>
diagnosed and even when the diagnosis is correct the institutional <br/>
method of treatment is innefective at best, damaging at worst.<br/>
<br/>
Be well & thank you for the discussion, it is engaging!<br/>

<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; child end up scarred and resentful because the parents neglected to<br/>

&gt; been nearsighted themselves, had never known a family member who was -- <br/>
&gt; they just didn&#39;t know how to identify the problem.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The teachers who should have been trained to recognize this kind of problem <br/>
evidently didn&#39;t know how to identify your problem either!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t usually make sweeping generalized statements, but I feel reasonably <br/>
secure this time saying here are some things that Unschooling parents don&#39;t <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents don&#39;t ridicule their children.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents aren&#39;t waiting for school teachers or people outside of <br/>
the family to identify problems.  I&#39;m sorry your parents weren&#39;t <br/>
sufficiently observant or helpful and left you with some resentments. I <br/>
really think that this eyesight thing was something, especially in another <br/>
era, that parents did expect the schools to keep track of. This story of the <br/>
smart kid unable to see and thought to be dumb and then being saved by a <br/>
caring teacher is kind of folklore. There is even an episode of &quot;The <br/>
Waltons&quot; dealing with it - Mrs. Walton found the poverty stricken kid <br/>
glasses out of a pile at the second hand store and presto he became clever. <br/>
It is a shame you got stuck with a bad teacher.<br/>
<br/>
It is comparing apples and oranges to use one&#39;s negative school experiences <br/>
as a template for how to Unschool, other than in a &quot;won&#39;t do THAT&quot; kind of <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
In households where Unschooling is flourishing the parents are beyond merely <br/>
&quot;attentive&quot;; we are truly connected and engaged. Connected relationships are <br/>
the primary goal and result of Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; Even at home, when I&#39;d scoot closer to the TV, I&#39;d be admonished to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; move back; my &quot;but I can&#39;t see it&quot; was ignored. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling parents don&#39;t ignore their children&#39;s statements of discomfort!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; Lately, I&#39;ve wondered about a math related learning disability called<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dyscalculia -- do I have some kind of LD, or am I just stupid, as I was<br/>
&gt; taught?  Could some kind of intervention have helped -- and would that<br/>
&gt; intervention have started with removing me from the school environment? <br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My heart goes out to you, having been told by school that you have a choice <br/>
of seeing yourself as either disabled or stupid. I am betting that you are <br/>
*neither*.<br/>
<br/>
The information about different types of intelligences, that Sandra has <br/>
already posted the link to on her website, really is something that you <br/>
could read for your own comfort.<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/intelligences<br/>
<br/>
When Unschoolers remove their children from the school environment, or never <br/>
put them in it in the first place, they do not stop there. School is inside <br/>
our heads and it requires active work to get it out of our thinking. It is a <br/>
hydra that will pop up just when we thought we had purged it utterly.<br/>
<br/>
Also simply removing the child from one environment is not enough. The next <br/>
part of the work is making home and real life MORE than school - more fun, <br/>
more interesting, more peaceful, more engaging, more positively challenging, <br/>
more safe. It is not leaving a bad space and replacing it with a void or <br/>
with an equality.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;  Like the example below of dyslexia at Sudbury, would I have had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; problems with math if I had never gone to school?  (That, btw, was my<br/>
&gt; reason for not doing formal math with my kids at home.  My 19 y.o.<br/>
&gt; daughter struggled through a college basic math class last fall and<br/>
&gt; passed; she also decided she hates school and refused to enroll for<br/>
&gt; another semester.) &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like a really unfortunate example of passing on math anxiety all <br/>
unwittingly - or your dd could simply have more emphasis on some of the <br/>
other seven or eight intelligences that Gardner lists. It is also an example <br/>
of all-or-nothing thinking. One subject is difficult, so all of college is <br/>
hateful. She probably needs time to heal. &quot;Refused&quot; is an active verb that <br/>
suggests that someone is pushing her to do something she doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your dd hasn&#39;t found her true calling. Why was she going to college <br/>
in the first place? I went to college initially straight from high school, <br/>
studying the wrong courses for the wrong reasons, and struggled eventually <br/>
leaving. However after several years I returned to study something I really <br/>
loved and it was a totally different and wonderful experience. Often the <br/>
admissions criteria for mature age students are different also, and maybe <br/>
some of the irrelevant basic classes will no longer be required.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; That&#39;s certainly possible.  The dyslexics I&#39;ve worked with have been <br/>
so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; severe, though, that it impacted the rest of their lives, not just<br/>
&gt; reading.  Difficulty reading was just a diagnostic tool with them.  The<br/>
&gt; horseback riding helps greatly, as following directions while riding<br/>
&gt; provides immediate feedback in a fun way -- if the instructor says<br/>
&gt; &quot;turn right, then weave the poles&quot; and you go left and find no poles...<br/>
&gt; ;-)  These are kids who will never be able to drive, possibly never<br/>
&gt; live on their own, etc. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One question that all Unschooling parents are likely to be asking is &quot;how <br/>
can I help my unique child engage in their passions to be able to blossom to <br/>
their fullest potentials and live their happiest life TODAY?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This question is asked regardless of any intellectual or physical challenges <br/>
the child might have, which is where the idea that the principles behind <br/>
Unschooling are the same regardless of the challenge (Happiness, Competence, <br/>
Success, Contentment, Passion). It is the kind of question that helps us <br/>
remove the idea of useful skills becoming &quot;diagnostic tools&quot; from our <br/>
thinking and interactions. I don&#39;t think Unschoolers recommend never helping <br/>
your children, or trying to be everything to your child. The key is finding <br/>
the help, including the people, who are willing to accept that the child is <br/>
in charge of their own journey by their parents&#39; wish and design and with <br/>
their parents&#39; blessing and facilitation. We can choose to empower our <br/>
children that way to the fullest extent of their abilities and developmental <br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it is easy for me since my child is, AFAIK, completely ordinary <br/>
from a schooly POV. I suspect that in school she would be in the middle of <br/>
the pack average, with the things that she really adores being only <br/>
marginally valued. Or she might be tagged as discipline problem because she <br/>
resents correction fairly forcibly. Or they might decide she can&#39;t focus, <br/>
because she wants to be the person designating the worthiness of any <br/>
activity and prioritizing her own time.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps not using the word &quot;dyslexics&quot; as a kind of all encompassing <br/>
descriptor, as if that was the primary or only important characteristic, <br/>
would help you move closer to seeing how Unschooling could work beautifully <br/>
for some of these children. I know you are probably just using it as a kind <br/>
of shorthand. But one of the things that helps in moving towards Unschooling <br/>
is examining really closely the words we use habitually or as shorthand, <br/>
looking for the shadow assumptions behind them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like hypotheticals much, but in the spirit of analogy ..... I guess <br/>
if, as an Unschooler, Jayn found much of regular life difficult, but loved <br/>
and valued horseback riding, and we found that it was a conduit of the <br/>
pleasures of mastery and feelings of competence, we (dh and I) would do all <br/>
we could to ensure that she had the chance to do it all she wanted. Perhaps <br/>
we would find additional other ways for her to interact with horses, like <br/>
being at a stable. It might take sacrifice on our part (since this can be an <br/>
expensive undertaking) but we would prioritize it because Jayn loved it, not <br/>
because it was doing her good. We wouldn&#39;t feel the need to use this passion <br/>
as a tool for improving her or addressing perceived (ie by society at large) <br/>
deficits - even though I would expect that other parts of her life would <br/>
become better and fuller as a side effect and that she would feel better <br/>
about herself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  if we ignore the fact a child is &quot;behind&quot; in reading, are we going to <br/>
miss the opportunity to intervene for that child?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The fact&quot; is not a fact at all. It is a subjective judgement, an <br/>
evaluation, that is coming from schoolish thinking. This is also another <br/>
example of unexamined colloquialism.<br/>
<br/>
I think it worth examining this &quot;window of opportunity&quot; idea, the idea that <br/>
outside of a certain window skills aquisition becomes at best very difficult <br/>
if not impossible.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that for most children this concept is one that is very schooly. <br/>
Schools have their schedules - for the &quot;gifted&quot;, for the average, for the <br/>
&quot;learning disabled&quot;. The idea that a child has missed the window could be <br/>
the very one that causes that child to give up on himself and feel bad about <br/>
herself and never try again. I don&#39;t like it. I think it is a barrier to <br/>
natural learning. See John Holt, &quot;Never Too Late&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I recently listened to an NPR interview with a European man who in his 40&#39;s <br/>
(!) went to China to learn Chinese Opera - a hugely physically demanding <br/>
study despite no prior experience with gymnastics. He became expert and is <br/>
now bringing traditional Chinese Opera to his home country after some years <br/>
of great pain and detemination. Another is one of the young martial arts <br/>
stars on TV talks about how he discovered Karate in his late teens (again in <br/>
China) and then devoted himself to it every day for several years to <br/>
accelerate his development to expert status.<br/>
<br/>
I think these are extreme examples and I suspect that most of our Unschooled <br/>
kids who discover a calling to a physically demanding vocation (eg dance, <br/>
athletics, ice skating) probably do so early enough to make their process <br/>
physically easier. Naturally we do all we can to help them with their goals. <br/>
My point is that even these physical development &quot;windows&quot; don&#39;t have to be <br/>
seen as closed. Even adults who are scarred by school experiences can learn <br/>
to read or do arithmetic, and may have a great many skills that demonstrate <br/>
their intellectual abilities that they just haven&#39;t realized are versions of <br/>
&quot;smart&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Truth be told, I&#39;m sorry for kids who are struggling in schools, or who have <br/>
to devote hours to school work that they would prefer to be spending on <br/>
their Joy. I would love it if every parent were ready and willing to fully <br/>
engage in Unschooling for however many years a full time parental presence <br/>
is needed - which may be longer in kids with intellectual challenges or <br/>
physical disabilities. However the world evidently isn&#39;t ready for that kind <br/>
of sweeping cultural alteration. I just can&#39;t give over my energy to talking <br/>
about everything that is wrong with how schools approach/create/exaccerbate <br/>
learning problems.<br/>
<br/>
No one gets to &quot;intervene&quot; with my child. Granny can ask &quot;Is she reading <br/>
yet?&quot; and go on about how she read early til she turns blue; I am not going <br/>
to make one single change in how I interact with Jayn until/unless Jayn <br/>
shows me she wants something different.<br/>

lazy all the time.  I assisted this particular girl each week, and <br/>
discovered that if you praised even one thing she did, the rest <br/>
improved too.  I convinced the instructor to stop correcting any faults <br/>
in favor of praising whatever she could that was good; it made all the <br/>

&gt; our heads and it requires active work to get it out of our thinking. <br/>
&gt; It is a<br/>
&gt; hydra that will pop up just when we thought we had purged it utterly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like your analogy &lt;g&gt;  I think you have to burn the stump after you <br/>
slice off a head ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Also simply removing the child from one environment is not enough. The <br/>
&gt; next<br/>
&gt; part of the work is making home and real life MORE than school - more <br/>
&gt; fun,<br/>
&gt; more interesting, more peaceful, more engaging, more positively <br/>
&gt; challenging,<br/>
&gt; more safe. It is not leaving a bad space and replacing it with a void <br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; with an equality.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that would be a tough sell to a lot of these parents.  Some of <br/>
these kids aren&#39;t even school age yet, so that&#39;s not the issue.  Again, <br/>
though, it was conversations with parents already dealing with special <br/>
needs kids that got me thinking about it, but the question was really <br/>
about kids already in unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;  Like the example below of dyslexia at Sudbury, would I have had<br/>
&gt;&gt; problems with math if I had never gone to school?  (That, btw, was my<br/>
&gt;&gt; reason for not doing formal math with my kids at home.  My 19 y.o.<br/>
&gt;&gt; daughter struggled through a college basic math class last fall and<br/>
&gt;&gt; passed; she also decided she hates school and refused to enroll for<br/>
&gt;&gt; another semester.) &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This sounds like a really unfortunate example of passing on math <br/>
&gt; anxiety all<br/>
&gt; unwittingly<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She wasn&#39;t anxious; she just didn&#39;t like school.  She liked her other <br/>
classes, got A&#39;s and B&#39;s, but still didn&#39;t want to go.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  - or your dd could simply have more emphasis on some of the<br/>
&gt; other seven or eight intelligences that Gardner lists. It is also an <br/>
&gt; example<br/>
&gt; of all-or-nothing thinking. One subject is difficult, so all of <br/>
&gt; college is<br/>
&gt; hateful. She probably needs time to heal. &quot;Refused&quot; is an active verb <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; suggests that someone is pushing her to do something she doesn&#39;t want <br/>
&gt; to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps your dd hasn&#39;t found her true calling. Why was she going to <br/>
&gt; college<br/>
&gt; in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Health insurance.  She&#39;s really scared about being without it, and the <br/>
only way to stay on dad&#39;s plan was to go to school.  Now, she&#39;s <br/>
applying to jobs that provide it.  She doesn&#39;t know what she wants to <br/>
do yet, and the idea that she could get the general ed. credits out of <br/>
the way while living at home and having her insurance covered while she <br/>
gains some perspective isn&#39;t motivation enough at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I went to college initially straight from high school,<br/>
&gt; studying the wrong courses for the wrong reasons, and struggled <br/>
&gt; eventually<br/>
&gt; leaving. However after several years I returned to study something I <br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; loved and it was a totally different and wonderful experience. Often <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; admissions criteria for mature age students are different also, and <br/>
&gt; maybe<br/>
&gt; some of the irrelevant basic classes will no longer be required.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; That&#39;s certainly possible.  The dyslexics I&#39;ve worked with have <br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt;&gt; severe, though, that it impacted the rest of their lives, not just<br/>
&gt;&gt; reading.  Difficulty reading was just a diagnostic tool with them.  <br/>
&gt;&gt; The<br/>
&gt;&gt; horseback riding helps greatly, as following directions while riding<br/>
&gt;&gt; provides immediate feedback in a fun way -- if the instructor says<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;turn right, then weave the poles&quot; and you go left and find no <br/>
&gt;&gt; poles...<br/>
&gt;&gt; ;-)  These are kids who will never be able to drive, possibly never<br/>
&gt;&gt; live on their own, etc. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One question that all Unschooling parents are likely to be asking is <br/>
&gt; &quot;how<br/>
&gt; can I help my unique child engage in their passions to be able to <br/>
&gt; blossom to<br/>
&gt; their fullest potentials and live their happiest life TODAY?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, that gets to the core of my question.  I think, though, that <br/>
parents of special needs kids don&#39;t have that luxury; they are immersed <br/>
in a world focused on the future.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; This question is asked regardless of any intellectual or physical <br/>
&gt; challenges<br/>
&gt; the child might have, which is where the idea that the principles <br/>
&gt; behind<br/>
&gt; Unschooling are the same regardless of the challenge (Happiness, <br/>
&gt; Competence,<br/>
&gt; Success, Contentment, Passion). It is the kind of question that helps <br/>
&gt; us<br/>
&gt; remove the idea of useful skills becoming &quot;diagnostic tools&quot; from our<br/>
&gt; thinking and interactions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But how else would someone know a child&#39;s brain is not functioning or <br/>
developing &quot;normally,&quot; except by observing what the child does?  What <br/>
else do these kind, supportive, loving unschooling parents, who don&#39;t <br/>
send the child to school, observe, if not the child&#39;s skills?  Yes, <br/>
kids develop on their own timetable -- that&#39;s not to say that <br/>
development doesn&#39;t exist, right?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another example from my experience:  My daughter didn&#39;t use the <br/>
potty until she was almost four.  There was nothing physically wrong <br/>
with her; she wasn&#39;t interested.  *I* finally had had it -- two kids in <br/>
diapers, one nearly old enough to change the other, was just too much <br/>
(we had no washer or dryer, either).  I stepped in and *trained* her, <br/>
using positive reinforcement, in about two hours&#39; time.  I had people <br/>
around me suggesting, as gently as they could, that maybe she should <br/>
use the potty; I really didn&#39;t know how old kids usually were when they <br/>
did this, that there was anything &quot;abnormal,&quot; just that I was really <br/>
tired and going broke buying Huggies ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I don&#39;t think Unschoolers recommend never helping<br/>
&gt; your children, or trying to be everything to your child. The key is <br/>
&gt; finding<br/>
&gt; the help, including the people, who are willing to accept that the <br/>
&gt; child is<br/>
&gt; in charge of their own journey by their parents&#39; wish and design and <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; their parents&#39; blessing and facilitation. We can choose to empower our<br/>
&gt; children that way to the fullest extent of their abilities and <br/>
&gt; developmental<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where would a parent find such a facilitator, though?  It seems many <br/>
are very set in their (schooly) ways, and would find an unschooling <br/>
approach tantamount to abuse.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I suppose it is easy for me since my child is, AFAIK, completely <br/>
&gt; ordinary<br/>
&gt; from a schooly POV. I suspect that in school she would be in the <br/>
&gt; middle of<br/>
&gt; the pack average, with the things that she really adores being only<br/>
&gt; marginally valued. Or she might be tagged as discipline problem <br/>
&gt; because she<br/>
&gt; resents correction fairly forcibly. Or they might decide she can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; focus,<br/>
&gt; because she wants to be the person designating the worthiness of any<br/>
&gt; activity and prioritizing her own time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps not using the word &quot;dyslexics&quot; as a kind of all encompassing<br/>
&gt; descriptor, as if that was the primary or only important <br/>
&gt; characteristic,<br/>
&gt; would help you move closer to seeing how Unschooling could work <br/>
&gt; beautifully<br/>
&gt; for some of these children. I know you are probably just using it as a <br/>
&gt; kind<br/>
&gt; of shorthand.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Catch-all for brain-related dysfunctions that effect learning, yes.  I <br/>
mean, there are other kids I&#39;ve worked with that have much more obvious <br/>
issues, like Down&#39;s Syndrome, cerebral palsy, etc.  I would imagine any <br/>
unschooling family with a Down&#39;s child would know it; they wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
writing to an email list trying to figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But one of the things that helps in moving towards Unschooling<br/>
&gt; is examining really closely the words we use habitually or as <br/>
&gt; shorthand,<br/>
&gt; looking for the shadow assumptions behind them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course.  I&#39;ve been unschooling a long time, but I talk to people who <br/>
can&#39;t even begin to think outside the special ed box.  The <br/>
conversations between parents at the barn always focus on the latest <br/>
drug or diagnosis or therapy; it&#39;s sad, but that&#39;s their world.  The <br/>
first thing we hear when they arrive is how the child did at school <br/>
that week, or what discipline issue we might need to cope with because <br/>
this or that med has been changed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t like hypotheticals much, but in the spirit of analogy ..... I <br/>
&gt; guess<br/>
&gt; if, as an Unschooler, Jayn found much of regular life difficult, but <br/>
&gt; loved<br/>
&gt; and valued horseback riding, and we found that it was a conduit of the<br/>
&gt; pleasures of mastery and feelings of competence, we (dh and I) would <br/>
&gt; do all<br/>
&gt; we could to ensure that she had the chance to do it all she wanted. <br/>
&gt; Perhaps<br/>
&gt; we would find additional other ways for her to interact with horses, <br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; being at a stable. It might take sacrifice on our part (since this can <br/>
&gt; be an<br/>
&gt; expensive undertaking)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But if she had a diagnosed difficulty, she could ride at a program like <br/>
ours for little or no cost; it&#39;s all volunteer-run :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  but we would prioritize it because Jayn loved it, not<br/>
&gt; because it was doing her good. We wouldn&#39;t feel the need to use this <br/>
&gt; passion<br/>
&gt; as a tool for improving her or addressing perceived (ie by society at <br/>
&gt; large)<br/>
&gt; deficits - even though I would expect that other parts of her life <br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; become better and fuller as a side effect and that she would feel <br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; about herself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, depending on the child&#39;s problem, riding can work miracles.  I&#39;ve <br/>
seen kids with CP walk for the first time, and heard an autistic boy <br/>
say his first sentence -- to the horse:  &quot;Walk on.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  if we ignore the fact a child is &quot;behind&quot; in reading, are we <br/>
&gt; going to<br/>
&gt; miss the opportunity to intervene for that child?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The fact&quot; is not a fact at all. It is a subjective judgement, an<br/>
&gt; evaluation, that is coming from schoolish thinking. This is also <br/>
&gt; another<br/>
&gt; example of unexamined colloquialism.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right.  What about potty training, then?  Should I have <br/>
continued to ignore the fact that my kid wore diapers at three years, <br/>
ten months of age?  The two hours of training resulted in a child who <br/>
felt competent and happy about her new skill, though she started out <br/>
screaming at me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it worth examining this &quot;window of opportunity&quot; idea, the idea <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; outside of a certain window skills aquisition becomes at best very <br/>
&gt; difficult<br/>
&gt; if not impossible.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking of brain development, which the experts identify by <br/>
their skills timetable, not the skills themselves.  If something like <br/>
rocking a baby is good for baby brain development, will it do any good <br/>
to rock a fourteen year old if that kid missed out on rocking?  (I <br/>
know, I know -- these ideas come and go, and what one generation <br/>
thought was great turns out to be bull, etc.  Trust me, I&#39;ve had this <br/>
discussion in my head enough times!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I suspect that for most children this concept is one that is very <br/>
&gt; schooly.<br/>
&gt; Schools have their schedules - for the &quot;gifted&quot;, for the average, for <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &quot;learning disabled&quot;. The idea that a child has missed the window could <br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; the very one that causes that child to give up on himself and feel bad <br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; herself and never try again. I don&#39;t like it. I think it is a barrier <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; natural learning. See John Holt, &quot;Never Too Late&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read that.  I also tried to learn to play the cello as an adult -- <br/>
ROFL!  I didn&#39;t get very far, but I did enjoy it.  (I broke a finger on <br/>
my left hand which healed bent, so I can&#39;t play anymore.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I recently listened to an NPR interview with a European man who in his <br/>
&gt; 40&#39;s<br/>
&gt; (!) went to China to learn Chinese Opera - a hugely physically <br/>
&gt; demanding<br/>
&gt; study despite no prior experience with gymnastics. He became expert <br/>
&gt; and is<br/>
&gt; now bringing traditional Chinese Opera to his home country after some <br/>
&gt; years<br/>
&gt; of great pain and detemination. Another is one of the young martial <br/>
&gt; arts<br/>
&gt; stars on TV talks about how he discovered Karate in his late teens <br/>
&gt; (again in<br/>
&gt; China) and then devoted himself to it every day for several years to<br/>
&gt; accelerate his development to expert status.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think these are extreme examples and I suspect that most of our <br/>
&gt; Unschooled<br/>
&gt; kids who discover a calling to a physically demanding vocation (eg <br/>
&gt; dance,<br/>
&gt; athletics, ice skating) probably do so early enough to make their <br/>
&gt; process<br/>
&gt; physically easier. Naturally we do all we can to help them with their <br/>
&gt; goals.<br/>
&gt; My point is that even these physical development &quot;windows&quot; don&#39;t have <br/>
&gt; to be<br/>
&gt; seen as closed. Even adults who are scarred by school experiences can <br/>
&gt; learn<br/>
&gt; to read or do arithmetic, and may have a great many skills that <br/>
&gt; demonstrate<br/>
&gt; their intellectual abilities that they just haven&#39;t realized are <br/>
&gt; versions of<br/>
&gt; &quot;smart&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Truth be told, I&#39;m sorry for kids who are struggling in schools, or <br/>
&gt; who have<br/>
&gt; to devote hours to school work that they would prefer to be spending on<br/>
&gt; their Joy. I would love it if every parent were ready and willing to <br/>
&gt; fully<br/>
&gt; engage in Unschooling for however many years a full time parental <br/>
&gt; presence<br/>
&gt; is needed - which may be longer in kids with intellectual challenges or<br/>
&gt; physical disabilities. However the world evidently isn&#39;t ready for <br/>
&gt; that kind<br/>
&gt; of sweeping cultural alteration. I just can&#39;t give over my energy to <br/>
&gt; talking<br/>
&gt; about everything that is wrong with how schools <br/>
&gt; approach/create/exaccerbate<br/>
&gt; learning problems.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hear you.  Thanks for what you have contributed -- it&#39;s very helpful.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; No one gets to &quot;intervene&quot; with my child. Granny can ask &quot;Is she <br/>
&gt; reading<br/>
&gt; yet?&quot; and go on about how she read early til she turns blue; I am not <br/>
&gt; going<br/>
&gt; to make one single change in how I interact with Jayn until/unless Jayn<br/>
&gt; shows me she wants something different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son wanted me to &quot;teach&quot; him a couple of times over the years; I <br/>
asked him what he wanted to learn, but he couldn&#39;t come up with <br/>
anything &lt;g&gt;  So we went back to reading, playing games, watching TV... <br/>
the usual.  He&#39;s quite fine now, at nearly 17.<br/>

&gt; they just didn&#39;t know how to identify the problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t notice you scooting up close to the tv? They didn&#39;t  <br/>
notice all the many other times that you probably had to move closer  <br/>
than others in order to see things? So - that is pretty much a  <br/>
definition of inattentive - they didn&#39;t notice.<br/>
<br/>
So - unschooling is a big responsibility in the sense that we can&#39;t  <br/>
count on outside experts (using the term &quot;expert&quot; very loosely) to  <br/>
notice such things for us.<br/>
<br/>
About the math - I am firmly and absolutely and totally completely  <br/>
(strong enough words?) convinced that nearly all math &quot;problems&quot; -  <br/>
what is called dyscalculia or any other kinds of math-related  <br/>
learning problems, are entirely due to schooling - whether schooling  <br/>
at school or schooling at home - it is the teaching methods that  <br/>
create it. I can&#39;t prove it, but I&#39;ve worked with hundreds, actually  <br/>
thousands, of high school and college students and adults and I truly  <br/>
have no doubt at all about the cause of most people&#39;s math problems.  <br/>
While it is true that most people aren&#39;t born to be math geniuses,  <br/>
they are pretty much all born with the ability to do all arithmetic  <br/>
and mathematics up to and including calculus. Most people aren&#39;t born  <br/>
to be musical geniuses, either, and yet most people have the ability  <br/>
to learn to sing or play piano, if they have the interest in doing  <br/>
so. Same with math. The difference is that most kids are not forced  <br/>
to &quot;do music&quot; every day for most of their childhood years - taught  <br/>
music using horribly ridiculous teaching methods that introduce  <br/>
abstract notation before the child&#39;s brain is capable of  <br/>
understanding it, and most kids aren&#39;t shamed and made to feel stupid  <br/>
about music on an almost-daily basis. Oh yeah, and we don&#39;t expect  <br/>
kids to learn music without actually being exposed to any real music.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think math learning disabilities are inevitable, natural,  <br/>
or in-born, and I fully believe it when Sudbury claims they&#39;ve never  <br/>
had a kid with a learning disability.<br/>
<br/>
However, because so many of us parents DO have math anxieties, we  <br/>
have a problem in that we can so easily pass those along to our kids.  <br/>
I think lots of the time our math anxieties are passed along to our  <br/>
kids because of how we avoid math as well as because of our negative  <br/>
attitude toward it. So - I encourage unschooling parents to face up  <br/>
to their math anxieties, for the sake of their kids, and get  <br/>
themselves over it enough that they can (at least) put on a good show  <br/>
of loving learning things that have to do with math.<br/>

<h4>Gold Standard</h4>
<time>22 Mar 2007, at 12:21am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34174174"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;what started me on this thread was the idea of a<br/>
&gt;&gt;home/unschooling parent asking for help from strangers on an email list<br/>
&gt;&gt;who&#39;ve never met the child.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still get the feeling from your posts that there is the ever-so-slight<br/>
differentiation of &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; and the importance of designating<br/>
the two. It seems to be a remnant of school-think.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The thought &quot;What if there is something<br/>
&gt;&gt;seriously wrong with a child, but the home/unschooler never recognizes<br/>
&gt;&gt;it?&quot;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Seriously wrong, imho, is something life-threatening. Ds was born with a<br/>
severe congenital heart defect that has required three open-heart surgeries<br/>
over 15 years, and the last surgery caused him to bleed out and lose his<br/>
life for a bit. He sustained long-term neurological damage that he lives<br/>
with daily. In all of these situations, this unschooling parent recognized<br/>
&quot;it&quot; that was seriously wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of that, if you live life with what brings joy to you and your<br/>
children, what difference does the differences between you matter?<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until we connected with schoolers that the first label of &quot;autism&quot;<br/>
was mentioned in regards to ds. How important was it for this unschooling<br/>
parent to have that information from &quot;experts&quot;? Eh. It helped some with my<br/>
own reading here and there, but ultimately, my son was who he was and I<br/>
could only know who he was by being an attentive parent. I could see what<br/>
gave him joy and what didn&#39;t. I could see what helped him be successful and<br/>
what didn&#39;t. I was pretty shocked to read the recommendations by the<br/>
&quot;experts&quot;...have a rigid schedule, make the child do things so that they<br/>
learn to do them, etc. I do believe ds has had a much more fulfilling life<br/>
unschooling than any of that mumbo jumbo would have brought.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think, though, that<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s their choice and they don&#39;t have to be. It is perfectly possible to<br/>
live joyfully in this moment day after day with kids who have different<br/>
issues. It is not mandated that anyone be immersed in a world focused on the<br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;But how else would someone know a child&#39;s brain is not functioning or<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My daughter didn&#39;t use the<br/>
&gt;&gt;potty until she was almost four. *I* finally had had it -- two kids in<br/>

&gt;&gt;(we had no washer or dryer, either). I stepped in and *trained* her&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is impossible to know what would have happened if you continued to let<br/>
her choose. But I have not met anyone whose child went too much over 5 in<br/>
diapers. Does it matter if it is 5 or 3 or 2 when a child uses the toilet?<br/>
The whole &quot;potty-trained by 3&quot; is again, someone&#39;s opinion, with limited<br/>
information (doesn&#39;t know every individual child in the world). It is<br/>
understood that you made this decision because of your financial situation,<br/>
but that doesn&#39;t mean that it was the best thing for your child.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, some kids learn from immediate reinforcement, particularly<br/>
kids with neurological issues, and when you are talking about something that<br/>
will be very useful in life, like using a bathroom, this kind of approach<br/>
may be best. But it would be VERY rare it seems, and at a later age rather<br/>
than an earlier age.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For us this has been another life-learning thing. We have had many, many<br/>
people in our lives for different reasons/hobbies/lessons/support, etc, and<br/>
all of us have learned what we each like and don&#39;t like with people. We&#39;ve<br/>
learned to ask specifically for what we want (right down to &quot;if you want me<br/>
to do something differently, please ask me courteously&quot;) and when to let go<br/>
of people/relationships because they don&#39;t work for us. We have also somehow<br/>
attracted many very cool and flexible people in our lives and have formed<br/>
special relationships, individually and collectively. I think people have<br/>
been attracted to us as well because of our lifestyle and attitudes. People<br/>
have changed their thinking and learned from being around us as much as<br/>
vice-versa.<br/>
<br/>
So put out there what you want, be watchful of who is around you. Ask for<br/>
exactly what you want. That&#39;s how we found the people we needed.<br/>

Roxana had a lisp and I wasn&#39;t sure about whether to &quot;do something&quot;  <br/>
about it, or not. I talked to people on AOL&#39;s Homeschool Connection  <br/>
and an unschooling mom who was a speech therapist responded and we  <br/>
talked back and forth and she told me some stuff that they&#39;d be doing  <br/>
in speech therapy for it. I didn&#39;t do speech therapy, per se, at  <br/>
home, but I realized that just by doing what we did (lots of reading,  <br/>
playing with sounds and rhymes and with a strong interest in words  <br/>
and music/songs, we were pretty much doing way more than could have  <br/>
been done in once or twice per week speech therapy, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
(She got over the lisp and is now known for her clear articulation -  <br/>
she&#39;s a singer and an actress. Today she&#39;s been working on her  <br/>
Yorkshire accent - playing Martha in &quot;The Secret Garden.&quot; )<br/>

know I couldn&#39;t see as well as anyone else.  I was really shocked when <br/>
I got my first glasses and things were suddenly in focus.  Becoming <br/>
nearsighted was gradual.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; So - unschooling is a big responsibility in the sense that we can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; count on outside experts (using the term &quot;expert&quot; very loosely) to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; About the math - I am firmly and absolutely and totally completely<br/>
&gt; (strong enough words?) convinced that nearly all math &quot;problems&quot; -<br/>
&gt; what is called dyscalculia or any other kinds of math-related<br/>
&gt; learning problems, are entirely due to schooling - whether schooling<br/>
&gt; at school or schooling at home - it is the teaching methods that<br/>
&gt; create it. I can&#39;t prove it, but I&#39;ve worked with hundreds, actually<br/>
&gt; thousands, of high school and college students and adults and I truly<br/>
&gt; have no doubt at all about the cause of most people&#39;s math problems.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So why don&#39;t the schools do something about it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll answer that -- politics.  There was a move years ago in my area to <br/>
introduce new math teaching methods (sorry I don&#39;t know what they were, <br/>
but there was some organization of math teachers behind it); it was <br/>
overridden by the Back to Basics types who thought drilling and more <br/>
drilling was the way to go, and they had more power.  They also had the <br/>
test scores to &quot;prove&quot; it.  You&#39;ve got one camp pushing one method, <br/>
another something else, everyone on the school boards remembering the <br/>
New Math debacle (or at least the Tom Lehrer song ridiculing it) and, <br/>
not wanting to repeat that...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; While it is true that most people aren&#39;t born to be math geniuses,<br/>
&gt; they are pretty much all born with the ability to do all arithmetic<br/>
&gt; and mathematics up to and including calculus.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought mathematics and arithmetic weren&#39;t the same thing?  That <br/>
people get screwed up because arithmetic is taught too early, bad <br/>
feelings get associated with it, and any possibility of doing well in <br/>
mathematics is ruined.  I could certainly be wrong, though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Most people aren&#39;t born<br/>
&gt; to be musical geniuses, either, and yet most people have the ability<br/>
&gt; to learn to sing or play piano, if they have the interest in doing<br/>
&gt; so. Same with math. The difference is that most kids are not forced<br/>
&gt; to &quot;do music&quot; every day for most of their childhood years - taught<br/>
&gt; music using horribly ridiculous teaching methods that introduce<br/>
&gt; abstract notation before the child&#39;s brain is capable of<br/>
&gt; understanding it,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing that really messed me up was that third grade was the year we <br/>
had to learn cursive writing, after starting with printing.  At the <br/>
same time, we started times tables and division.  I don&#39;t think my <br/>
brain could cope with all the new symbols.  (I was half a year younger <br/>
than my class, too, and much smaller.  That didn&#39;t help.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;The Glass Wall: Why Mathematics Can Seem <br/>
Difficult,&quot; btw; what I remember of it is that verbal language and math <br/>
language don&#39;t translate well.  One of the other things about math <br/>
education that boggled my mind was when the symbols started changing -- <br/>
X for times was replaced by a dot, then by a number next to a <br/>
parenthesis, then X started meaning &quot;fill in the blank&quot; instead of <br/>
times...  (Hey, I&#39;ve even read &quot;Overcoming Math Anxiety&quot; &lt;ggg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and most kids aren&#39;t shamed and made to feel stupid<br/>
&gt; about music on an almost-daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a piano teacher who did that.  Guess how?  By writing COUNT! in <br/>
inch-high letters across the first page of my practice book.  I still <br/>
can&#39;t count time, but I can tap it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oh yeah, and we don&#39;t expect<br/>
&gt; kids to learn music without actually being exposed to any real music.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, what&#39;s &quot;real math&quot; then?  It&#39;s not balancing a checkbook, <br/>
counting change, figuring percentages in a store, reading a clock?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; No, I don&#39;t think math learning disabilities are inevitable, natural,<br/>
&gt; or in-born, and I fully believe it when Sudbury claims they&#39;ve never<br/>
&gt; had a kid with a learning disability.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, because so many of us parents DO have math anxieties, we<br/>
&gt; have a problem in that we can so easily pass those along to our kids.<br/>
&gt; I think lots of the time our math anxieties are passed along to our<br/>
&gt; kids because of how we avoid math as well as because of our negative<br/>
&gt; attitude toward it. So - I encourage unschooling parents to face up<br/>
&gt; to their math anxieties, for the sake of their kids, and get<br/>
&gt; themselves over it enough that they can (at least) put on a good show<br/>
&gt; of loving learning things that have to do with math.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to play Set with my kids all the time; bought tesselating <br/>
puzzles, pattern blocks, tangrams at homeschool conferences, which I <br/>
think I played with more than they did.  (I don&#39;t do these any longer <br/>
because the kids started having their own lives &lt;g&gt;)  Alex couldn&#39;t <br/>
possibly be math anxious and still play Pokemon cards at the level he <br/>
does; a tournament means spending 8 to 10 hours doing mental math.  I <br/>
never tried to teach him Pokemon, of course ;-)  He&#39;s never tried to <br/>
teach me, either!<br/>

&gt; differentiation of &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; and the importance of <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seriously wrong, imho, is something life-threatening. Ds was born with <br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; severe congenital heart defect that has required three open-heart <br/>
&gt; surgeries<br/>
&gt; over 15 years, and the last surgery caused him to bleed out and lose <br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; life for a bit. He sustained long-term neurological damage that he <br/>
&gt; lives<br/>
&gt; with daily. In all of these situations, this unschooling parent <br/>
&gt; recognized<br/>
&gt; &quot;it&quot; that was seriously wrong.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your obstetrician and pediatrician knew about the congenital heart, and <br/>
the cardiac surgeon no doubt knew that neurological damage could occur <br/>
with surgical complications.  You didn&#39;t recognize (diagnose) these <br/>
things all on your own.<br/>
<br/>
I would define seriously as not life-threatening; chronic, perhaps, but <br/>
not critical.<br/>

&gt; Outside of that, if you live life with what brings joy to you and your<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; It wasn&#39;t until we connected with schoolers that the first label of <br/>
&gt; &quot;autism&quot;<br/>
&gt; was mentioned in regards to ds. How important was it for this <br/>
&gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; parent to have that information from &quot;experts&quot;? Eh. It helped some <br/>
&gt; with my<br/>
&gt; own reading here and there, but ultimately, my son was who he was and I<br/>
&gt; could only know who he was by being an attentive parent. I could see <br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; gave him joy and what didn&#39;t. I could see what helped him be <br/>
&gt; successful and<br/>
&gt; what didn&#39;t. I was pretty shocked to read the recommendations by the<br/>
&gt; &quot;experts&quot;...have a rigid schedule, make the child do things so that <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; learn to do them, etc. I do believe ds has had a much more fulfilling <br/>
&gt; life<br/>
&gt; unschooling than any of that mumbo jumbo would have brought.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you, that&#39;s helpful.  I&#39;ve seen families really struggling to do <br/>
what they&#39;ve been told is necessary, who can&#39;t imagine giving it all up <br/>
because they don&#39;t want to harm their child.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; in a world focused on the future.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s their choice and they don&#39;t have to be. It is perfectly <br/>

little brother was still getting changed.  Without me saying so, she <br/>
began to call herself a big girl, announcing she was no longer a baby.  <br/>

&gt; I&#39;ll answer that -- politics.<br/>
<br/>
Or economics.<br/>
<br/>
And - that is combined with massive ignorance in the k-12 education  <br/>
community about how children&#39;s brains really work, how learning  <br/>
really happens. Brain researchers/educational psychologists know a  <br/>
lot, but almost none of it gets utilized in schools because, of  <br/>
course, it isn&#39;t easy, in a classroom environment, to break away from  <br/>
a predetermined one-size-fits-all curriculum and it isn&#39;t easy to  <br/>
just stop grading children and stop testing and stop trying to  <br/>
manipulate them into learning what, how, and when, all based on the  <br/>
opinions of some appointed committee of adults who don&#39;t even know  <br/>
the child and have little to no awareness of the reality of the  <br/>
child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Math facility is key to many careers - most high-paying careers  <br/>
require significant math skills. Math grades are used as a &quot;filter&quot; -  <br/>
it reduces the supply of &quot;qualified&quot; new entrants to lucrative fields  <br/>
and thereby keeps those fields lucrative. Another way to put it: it  <br/>
keeps the riffraff out.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not saying that the math teachers have this in mind when they  <br/>
engage in teaching methods that systematically destroy young  <br/>
children&#39;s early love of math and then go on to create significant  <br/>
and often debilitating math anxiety in most older kids and teens.  <br/>
They&#39;re usually doing what they believe is right for the kids. EVEN  <br/>
though most elementary school teachers THEMSELVES have significant  <br/>
math anxiety, they usually blame the teaching methods used on them  <br/>
and they teach differently in response. What they don&#39;t see is that  <br/>
the aspect of their teaching approach that causes the most problems  <br/>
is still the same - introduction of too much material, too soon, with  <br/>
too much formal notation and abstract thinking required before the  <br/>
child has had enough chance to &quot;play around&quot; with materials, become  <br/>
motivated to understand mathematical relationships, grasp the purpose  <br/>
of math techniques, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., at least, it is like we&#39;re all constantly swimming in an  <br/>
ocean of negative influences around math. Kids absorb this and even  <br/>
those lucky kids who aren&#39;t schooled (at home or at school) often  <br/>
pick up on their parents&#39; negative feelings about math. I really  <br/>
encourage parents of young children to start now to change their OWN  <br/>
relationship with math - start by snuggling up with your little ones  <br/>
and reading math-related stories - don&#39;t shy away from them, revel in  <br/>
them, instead. There are wonderful math-related picture books - just  <br/>
start with those and then move on to having fun together in natural  <br/>
ways, as things come up. I&#39;m pretty convinced that most of us have a  <br/>
certain amount of handicap to overcome in this area and so it is  <br/>
worth it to make a conscious effort to compensate for any tendency we  <br/>
may have to avoid math. If this sounds to people like it goes against  <br/>
unschooling principles - (like it is dividing the world into  <br/>
artificial subjects or it is overly &quot;parent-initiated&quot;) then I think  <br/>
you should reconsider. Think of other phobias you might have that you  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to pass along to your child. If you&#39;re terrified of  <br/>
water, scared of swimming, then you can either cringe and gasp and  <br/>
grab your child back every time he gets near water, and pretty soon  <br/>
your child will be afraid of water, too, or you can find ways to give  <br/>
your child enjoyable and relaxed exposure to water and swimming and  <br/>
you can, for your child&#39;s sake, hide your own fear or at least make  <br/>
it clear that your child doesn&#39;t need to share it.<br/>

came out when she was about 5, so she was lucky to be able to wear  <br/>
those to kindergarten. She still wore them to sleep in for a long  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m hoping to collect some of the math stories, but I can tell some  <br/>
music stories.<br/>
<br/>
I play baroque music on the piano, because I like the mechanicalness  <br/>
of it.  It&#39;s like clockwork, with patterns that go together very  <br/>
intricately.  It&#39;s fun to see how far I can get sightreading without  <br/>
making a mistake, and then on pieces I know, it&#39;s fun to see how far  <br/>
I can get without getting my fingers stuck in an awkward place.<br/>
<br/>
With partsongs and madrigals, it&#39;s like building a sculpture of sound  <br/>
in the air.  And it takes three or four people--sometimes five or  <br/>
six, and while it can be done with more, it can&#39;t be done without  <br/>
several people, doing their parts at the same time.  And when it  <br/>
works, it makes something that cannot exist otherwise.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
what&#39;s on the  paper--it&#39;s only in the air.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen two live productions of West Side Story in the past few  <br/>
weeks.  I shivered.  I got physical shivers a couple of times from  <br/>
Maria&#39;s songs (both singers did it for me/to me).  I cried.  The  <br/>
music moved my nervous system in real, physical, intense ways.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend learning to play recorder by ear.  He&#39;s learning so  <br/>
fast it awes me.  Then we thought we&#39;d teach him one page of a  <br/>
madrigal we&#39;re going to teach a group tomorrow night.  He learned two  <br/>
pages of the bass part super fast, and remembered it four days  <br/>
later.  That was exciting, to see someone learn something so quickly.<br/>

-- patterns.  Music reading was and is a struggle.   I bought a book <br/>
classical works produced by William F. Buckley, which uses the method <br/>
he found worked for him: every black-key note is printed in red.  That <br/>
helped some.<br/>

&quot;Love.&quot;  The opening number represents their last concert, on the roof <br/>

Glass Onion; while the people are dancing, the set begins to come <br/>
apart, ending in bombed ruins for Eleanor Rigby.  Overhead screens <br/>
display text about the Beatles having been born during WWII.  <br/>
Separately, those songs don&#39;t have that effect (although there are a <br/>
few songs that will always make me cry).<br/>

like trills were bothersome.<br/>
<br/>
When I was about 7, our next-door neighbor would let me play her piano. <br/>
  I *loved* to &quot;bang&quot; as she called it -- it sounded like music to me!  <br/>
She got tired of it, though, and, being a school teacher, brought out a <br/>
beginning piano book.  She gave me some basic instruction, then told me <br/>
I could continue to play, but ONLY what was written on the page.  I&#39;m <br/>
surprised she didn&#39;t get sick of &quot;yertle the turtle&quot; sooner than I did. <br/>
  That lesson stuck, though; I still can&#39;t memorize music, not even the <br/>
next measure on a page that needs turning.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy to report that our piano was banged daily by my kids.  Alex <br/>
liked to have music in front of him, though, so he&#39;d write his own.  <br/>
He&#39;d occasionally ask me to play it, though, which was a problem ;-)  <br/>
We had a cool duet once, with me on cello; he described what the music <br/>
represented, and we improvised accordingly; I think it involved tigers <br/>
in the jungle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My experiences in playing with numbers is similar in many ways to Sandra&#39;s experience <br/>
with music.  I experience number patterns and combinations as 3 dimensional sculptures.  <br/>
They have different &quot;feelings&quot;.  Some are all angles and points.  Others are rounded or <br/>
spiral - some even bulbous.  I have always enjoyed playing with numbers in my head <br/>
finding how they relate in different combinations and how the patterns feel as they form.  I <br/>
have always counted things like steps I take or as the water fills a cup - those 2 things are <br/>
really different.  The steps are regulated and methodical.  The water is usually cyclical and <br/>
synchopated.   I am a dancer and my dances are often physical expressions of number <br/>
combinations - not in a counting way though - more as complex combinations and <br/>
patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the other part of the story:  I was a miserable failure with &quot;math&quot; in school!  In the <br/>
3rd grade I still loved #&#39;s until we had to learn the times tables by a specific date.  I <br/>
&quot;understood&quot; the times table- I had been using #s in that way for a long time.  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
seem to get them to pop into my head at random the way they wanted us to, however.  <br/>
There was no way for me to connect 6x9 to anything real when someone else wanted an <br/>
answer.  I needed it to be poetry or motion. The stress was physical for me and even today <br/>
I can remember the panic feeling of &quot;I&#39;m never going to pull this out of thin air before the <br/>
time is up!&quot;  When the date to have them memorized came the class was &quot;rewarded&quot; with <br/>
an ice cream party while I sat in the library as the only kid who didn&#39;t know my <br/>
multiplication tables!<br/>
<br/>
My Dad has a PhD in math and science education.  He sees #s as brilliant possiblity.  I saw <br/>
myself as his daughter the math failure.  Even he, the most patient and loving man in the <br/>
world, seemed not to be able to understand how I would just become paralyzed by my <br/>
basic high school algebra book open before me.  I loved the beauty and simplicity of <br/>
geometry.  There was something I could feast my eyes on! - but expressing it all in <br/>
mathmatical formulas on paper brought back that physical stress from 3rd grade.  I truly <br/>
understood geometry - in my bones- if you had asked me to dance it I could have done so  <br/>
with such depth it would have blown your mind,  but that wouldn&#39;t have worked in high <br/>
school or on the SAT! I got a C in geometry and still consider that my big school math <br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
In spite of my school math misery I still love the possibilities of #s and the ways they go <br/>
together.  I still dance them.  My Dh and DS can get positively fired up and giddy over a <br/>
good math puzzler in ways I don&#39;t get at all!  Some people don&#39;t &quot;get &quot; absract art. Some <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the poetry of baseball.  There is no &quot;failure&quot; there - it&#39;s just not their thing.  The <br/>
beauty or fun of math just may not be your thing. The way I see it as long as you don&#39;t <br/>
dismiss that it can be magical for someone else just because it isn&#39;t for you than there is <br/>
no harm. <br/>

I also don&#39;t get jazz, and sci-fi/fantasy usually irritates the hell  <br/>

Lots of my smartest friends love football and I can&#39;t get it and  <br/>
don&#39;t want to.  So I feel stupid when I&#39;m around them so I just get  <br/>
away from the jazz and football and fantasy-author discussions.<br/>
<br/>
But math &quot;counts.&quot;  Not liking jazz doesn&#39;t make someone retarded.   <br/>
So there&#39;s stress with math.<br/>

him the Schoolhouse Rock song he is singing is about math and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t believe it until I write out the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
I remember once he tried figure out a math problem and he got really <br/>
frustrated and said &quot;I hate numbers!&quot;.  I told him to count kittens not <br/>
numbers, and that changed his perspective.  Since he really loves cats, <br/>
he feels it is worth counting kittens, being off by just one kitten is <br/>
a big deal.  I don&#39;t know if this kid will ever enjoy math and that&#39;s <br/>
okay with me.  He is completely capable as a math utilitarian.<br/>
