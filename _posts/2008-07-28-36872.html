<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500234978">This summer has been a whirlwind of changes for my family.  Mainly<br/>
because dd (11) has decided to give school a try.  She has been going<br/>
back and forth on this subject for a few years now and has finally<br/>
decided that she is going to do it.   I&#39;ve felt happy, sad, proud,<br/>
rejected, confused and have questioned all I&#39;ve done and wonder if I<br/>
could have been more fun, more involved, less involved, etc.  I know<br/>
these decisions aren&#39;t about me so I keep them to myself and just be<br/>
supportive.<br/>
<br/>
My son (9) joined a lego league through a Montessori school and was so<br/>
impressed with the kids he thought he wanted to try school part time too<br/>
(probably influenced by dd and his bff who is going to go to school this<br/>
year).  I feel this same emotions as I listed above only I&#39;m a bit more<br/>
apprehensive with him because he&#39;s still not reading (which I&#39;m ok with<br/>
but I&#39;m not sure how this will affect his school experience and how this<br/>
will make him feel about himself).  I&#39;m going to set it up so he&#39;s there<br/>
during the &quot;specials&quot; (the fun stuff).<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m dealing with those changes and hoping that they decide to come<br/>
home.  I&#39;ll be ok if they like it and decide to stay and they are happy<br/>
too.  I need to stop taking it personally.   I appreciate that they<br/>
don&#39;t take peoples words for things and like to find things out on their<br/>
own (meaning my word, about school).<br/>
<br/>
On top of all that dd, has been pulling away from me and it&#39;s just<br/>
really confusing me (again, is this normal, am I doing something wrong,<br/>
is it a phase??)!  She has a close friend (new in the last year) who is<br/>
13.  This past weekend dd and friend were off bike riding with a couple<br/>
boys, 12 and 13.  I know friend is a little boy crazy (and really likes<br/>
one of these boys) and dd has never really felt that way (boy crazy) but<br/>
she did tell me this summer that she would like a boy friend (no one in<br/>
mind at that time).  I called dd when they were out riding and told her<br/>
I ordered a couple pizza&#39;s and for all of them to come over and eat when<br/>
they were hungry.  The girls showed up the boys didn&#39;t (well ds and his<br/>
buddies did... [:)] ).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should explain that friends dad live on our street and I really<br/>
like him and his wife (young couple, I think friend was born when he was<br/>
still a teenager).  She lives with her mom part of the time a few miles<br/>
away and I don&#39;t know her mom (met her once) but know she&#39;s alone there<br/>
during the day, a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Then last night dd was making plans for today.  She asked if she could<br/>
go swimming at they boys house or in friends neighborhood pool.  I said<br/>
yes (cause we always try to say yes) BUT (I know friend does not have<br/>
any parental supervision at home and I don&#39;t know these boys at all so I<br/>
don&#39;t know if there&#39;s supervision).   The BUTS, I would like to meet the<br/>
boys (just say hi, not like an interview) and make sure there is<br/>
supervision there.  If you go to friends house wait until her mom&#39;s home<br/>
from work this afternoon.  OR they can come over here, I&#39;ll take them to<br/>
a public pool and hang out.<br/>
<br/>
This made dd very upset.  Said we never let her do anything (this isn&#39;t<br/>
true but I know she feels this way now), and that other parents don&#39;t<br/>
act this way.     I&#39;ve seen this 13yo be manipulative and try to get<br/>
Lydia to do things (tells her what to say to me) that are sneaky.  I<br/>
also overheard friend trying to create a &quot;double date&quot; so I feel like<br/>
Lydia is just being used to get closer to this boy.  I don&#39;t think Lydia<br/>
likes this other boy this way and I don&#39;t want Lydia to feel used by<br/>
this friend, so I don&#39;t want to say that to her.  Lydia has never been<br/>
sneaky and tells me most everything but I&#39;ve noticed that change this <br/>
summer too (just not telling me everything like she used to).  And I<br/>
don&#39;t want the above scenario to cause her to be sneaky or stop telling<br/>
me things.  Lydia is a trustworthy kid who always let&#39;s me know where<br/>
she is, and what she is doing.  And to be honest I think I give her more<br/>
freedom than most 11 yo&#39;s that I know.<br/>
<br/>
I almost always try to yes to her.  And I feel like we tried to say yes<br/>
to the above scenario but it&#39;s not making her happy.   But the yes she<br/>
wants is way out of my comfort zone.<br/>
<br/>
I should say that I&#39;ve also noticed Lydia being more snarky and<br/>
irritated by me this summer too.  To be honest I think she sees other<br/>
friends talk to their parents like this and thinks that is normal. <br/>
She&#39;s also been irritated with hubby (dad) and her brother.  I just<br/>
don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on and am worried that it may get worse when she<br/>
gets to school.<br/>
<br/>
So, I thought I&#39;d ask here.  I&#39;m feeling like my emotions are clouding<br/>
my judgment.  And I&#39;m not even pmsing yet... [:D] !!  What am I doing<br/>
wrong????????<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071280219">Maybe without telling her everything you&#39;re thinking,  maybe say  <br/>
that&#39;s one of the things about school that worries you--it creates  <br/>
distance between parents and children, and she&#39;ll meet lots of kids  <br/>
who are sneaky and needy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible these boys are nicer than the girl you&#39;re worried  <br/>
about.  I would&#39;ve never thought such a thing possible when I was  <br/>
young in a family of all girls and boys were the dangerous &quot;others,&quot;  <br/>
but now that I have two boys who are very gentlemanly, and I see some  <br/>
of Holly&#39;s younger female friends who are emotionally needy and not  <br/>
very nice or honest (and have seen in years past a couple of girls  <br/>
the boys knew that I did NOT trust), it&#39;s not always the boys who  <br/>
create the pressures.<br/>
<br/>
It would&#39;ve been good if those boys had come over for pizza.<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, in this situation, I might ask if the other girl&#39;s  <br/>
parents know the boys.  Who are these boys and where do they live?   <br/>
If your daughter has no idea, maybe you could ask her if it&#39;s good to  <br/>
get wet and mostly naked with strangers.  (Depends on her sense of  <br/>
humor and propriety, whether that would be a thought-provoking  <br/>
question or just irritating.  For Holly, it would be sobering.)<br/>
<br/>
Is your daughter aware that &quot;double dates&quot; have traditions?  God  <br/>
knows, terminology changes.  It&#39;s hard to translate and keep straight  <br/>
all the terms of the past with the present, and that&#39;s probably  <br/>
regional and ever-changing too.  &quot;Hooking up&quot; and &quot;going out&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;hanging out&quot; don&#39;t mean the same to Holly&#39;s friends as they did (or  <br/>
do, on the surface) to  mine, and the old terms have to be translated  <br/>
to these kids sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried talking directly to the other girl, maybe without your  <br/>
daughter in the room?  Maybe you could get a feel for what her  <br/>
intentions are and do some direct intimidation.  If she&#39;s not afraid  <br/>
of her own parents, maybe she could still be wary of your reaction,  <br/>
if you could alpha-female her off to the side.<br/>
<br/>
Or if that&#39;s not appropriate or isn&#39;t going to work, maybe offer to  <br/>
be a person she can talk to if these boys aren&#39;t as nice as she  <br/>
expects they&#39;ll be or something.  Somehow create a relationship with  <br/>
the girl without your own daughter as triangulation.  That would keep  <br/>
your daughter from being the only hinge in the structure.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure here.  Normally we could joke around like this.  Last<br/>
night I said something to the effect of &quot;I have no idea what these<br/>
boys are interested in.&quot;  I realize now I shouldn&#39;t have said anything<br/>
like this because this really upset her.  She really isn&#39;t thinking of<br/>
them like that and I don&#39;t think she wants to think that these boys<br/>
think of her like that.  Her and this 13yo friend are really at<br/>
different places.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the plans today...we decided I would pick the friend up and bring<br/>
her over here and they could go back and swim when her mom got home. <br/>
The friend called back and got a big old NO from her mom.  So, I said<br/>
to Lydia (with a smile)&quot;all that grief and she can&#39;t do it!!&quot;  I saw<br/>
Lydia try to hide her smile.  But I have to say I think I won some<br/>
points today!  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a learning experience for me to say the least.  And she&#39;s<br/>
being raised very differently than I was and maybe I&#39;m putting my own<br/>
hangups onto her.  If I could just turn the emotions off occasionally!  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the tips, I will think about talking to her and her<br/>
parents and see if an opportunity comes up naturally.<br/>

Perfect!<br/>
<br/>
It might be a good idea to talk to the mom if you get a chance to  <br/>
make sure the friend isn&#39;t using Lydia as a reason/excuse to want to  <br/>
do more, like &quot;Well her parents said yes, and she&#39;s only 11.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my oldest was 11, I liked to know where she was physically.  If she<br/>
had been invited to go swimming at someone&#39;s house that I didn&#39;t know, I<br/>
would&#39;ve walked her over there and introduced myself and found out for<br/>
sure if she&#39;d been invited and perhaps left a phone number with the<br/>
parents of the that house in case of emergency.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not out of the realm of reasonability.  If you had an emergency<br/>
at your house with another persons kid, you&#39;d like to know how to get in<br/>
contact with the parents.  If you&#39;d had an emergency while your daughter<br/>
was elsewhere and had to leave the house, it would be good to be able to<br/>
contact her to let her know that nobody is home and that she&#39;d need to<br/>
stay there or come with you.<br/>
<br/>
The friend&#39;s neighborhood pool might be a more neutral place where you<br/>
could go to check up on them and bring them cold drinks and snacks. <br/>
Pools sometimes have rules about age requirements for being there<br/>
without an adult.<br/>
<br/>
If the friend is doing this as an arrangement to hang out with these<br/>
boys without supervision, it puts your dd in an awkward position wether<br/>
she realizes it or not.  Have you talked to the parents of the friend<br/>
about what limits they have in place?  If the friend is defying their<br/>
rules and your dd is going along with it, that could jeopardize their<br/>
friendship.  These are all things that your dd should be made aware of,<br/>
wether she likes that info or not.  I can totally understand how that<br/>
would be really frustrating for her too!</div>
