<div id="ygrps-yiv-672790793">I don&#39;t want to send out unwanted stuff here, but I have some news to share,<br/>
my family has a condo in Florida and none of us can make it there this year<br/>
due to extenuated circumstances in our families, we would be willing to rent<br/>
it out to anyone who might be interested, the weeks are one two or three in<br/>
a row in Feb and it is large enough to hold more than one family!  close to<br/>
lots of great homeschool adventures like Kennedy space center! I hope this<br/>
is not taken as an advertisement, as it is not meant that way, I just know<br/>
it will go empty  and  people are always looking for a place to stay!.<br/>
thanks<br/>
<br/>
Tanya  please respond privately if interested thanks <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:michigan@...">michigan@...</a></div>
