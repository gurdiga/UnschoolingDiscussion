I like this, and I&#39;m going to use it the next time someone says something like that to me.<br/>
<br/>
We are all G-d&#39;s creatures (ok I know that not everyone believes in Gd, but indulge me for a moment :o)).  And unlike so many people, G-d cares about how we treat animals.<br/>
<br/>
Loving and caring for animals can be very healing and can enable us to love people at times when they *aren&#39;t* so easily loved.  At least that has been my experience.<br/>

  This is wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
  We recently lost Simone, a cat who has been part of my life for almost 21 <br/>
  years. We are down to one cat (16 years old) after years of having three. These <br/>
  cats have been part of my life longer than my kid, and have always been there <br/>
  for him! <br/>
