&lt;&lt; no, never heard of Chasing Amy.. is that a movie? What&#39;s it about. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hate to say.<br/>
Comic book authors and their social lives.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to look up and read about it before just committing to having <br/>
a copy in your house even temporarily.  It&#39;s a Jay and Silent Bob movie.  <br/>
Stars a young Ben Affleck.  It&#39;s one of the five (soon to be six) movies <br/>
directed by Kevin Smith:<br/>
Clerks<br/>
Mall Rats<br/>
Chasing Amy<br/>
Dogma<br/>
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back<br/>
<br/>
I know these things because of Marty, who has an interest.<br/>
