<div id="ygrps-yiv-358809289">Yesterday was the Autumnal Equinox...the First Day of Fall.<br/>
<br/>
And we celebrated with a Middle Earth Feast. Abbie has a book out <br/>
from the library, which has several recipes in it, based on foods <br/>
mentioned in Tolkien&#39;s books.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Maggot&#39;s Cottage Pie...basically a simple shepherd&#39;s pie with <br/>
beef, carrots, and onion topped with mashed potatoes. THAT was good! <br/>
I&#39;m making it for the next potluck at church. <br/>
<br/>
Seed Cakes for Gimli...poppy seed muffins, actually!  they were a <br/>
good accompaniment to the Cottage Pie. <br/>
<br/>
We really should have had a Strider Salad or something  and will, the <br/>
next time we plan a Middle Earth Feast. Or fruit something.<br/>
<br/>
And for dessert, Goldberry Pie, wherein we modified a basic berry pie <br/>
to a cheesecake bottom, berry topped open face pie that was <br/>
scrumptious!<br/>
<br/>
Part of the &quot;goodness&quot; of the day was shopping for the ingredients. <br/>
The kids got their allowance and had fun buying &quot;whatever you <br/>
want&quot;...which was candy. And we hit the library while we were out.<br/>
<br/>
There is this very cool thing there: magnetic poetry. Only, instead <br/>
of stuck to the fridge, it came with this board and a tray. I spent <br/>
about 45 minutes putting together such deep and meaningful phrases as:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
tingle mortal tongue<br/>
may his vow taste like<br/>
an eternity<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
mischance beneath a wicked moon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That was so much fun, I&#39;m going to look for that set for my own self! <br/>
The kids played a computer game and checked out a few books, and we <br/>
found out we have a video out that is nine days overdue!!! but the <br/>
librarian had mercy on us and let us check out. We&#39;ll owe a chunk <br/>
o&#39;money on that baby, though. ack.<br/>
<br/>
Listened to Hank the Cow Dog on the way home, and then Abbie and I <br/>
busied ourselves in the kitchen, putting together our Feast. Katie <br/>
helped by chopping the potatoes and she also mashed them when ready.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is the cool thing. Robby is my non-helper boy. The girls <br/>
will pitch in whenever, but Robby usually needs to be asked, and <br/>
though he usually does when asked...eh, he&#39;s just my non-helper. So <br/>
last night, the dishes needed doing. We had finished eating and had <br/>
digested for a little while, and the time had come. Inexorably, <br/>
indubitably, undeniably DISH TIME! <br/>
<br/>
Robby was reading a book and I said &quot;come and help with these dishes, <br/>
wouldja?&quot; He glanced up and said &quot;I&#39;m reading&quot; so instead of &quot;putting <br/>
my foot down&quot; and insisting, I said &quot;okay. I thought we&#39;d get some <br/>
visiting in. You don&#39;t have to, but if you want, you can come and dry <br/>
while I wash.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
half a minute later, he was in there with me,  dish towel in hand, <br/>
chatting about the Hulk and Rockman. It was absolutely THE BEST part <br/>
of the day for me. He did not wander away, he did not leave, he kept <br/>
on going until we had finished the entire job: dishes washed, dried, <br/>
and put away. Isn&#39;t that COOL?<br/>
<br/>
And for bed, we had pretty much giggle gas and chaos. My hubby&#39;s out <br/>
on a job for the week, and when one of us has to be gone, we usually <br/>
open up the bedroom to a kid to sleep with us. Well, I couldn&#39;t <br/>
choose between them last night, so we all ended up, all four of us, <br/>
in my queen size bed. Which was fine. Until someone started giggling <br/>
about something, and then it was just hysteria, and I&#39;m not kidding. <br/>
More than an hour later, after we&#39;d moved into the front room, on the <br/>
floor where there was actually ROOM for us all, we were still <br/>
laughing about nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Hank the Cow Dog put us to sleep, and I moved back to my bed about <br/>
2:30 because I was getting a major kink in my neck. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone else is still sleeping and I&#39;m enjoying my reminiscences.<br/>
<br/>
a Good Day!<br/>
