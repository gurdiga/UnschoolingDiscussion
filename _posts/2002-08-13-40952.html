<div id="ygrps-yiv-7982547">Somewhere over the years I picked up two bits of readiness<br/>
trivia, which are pretty handy general guides if you, like me,<br/>
periodically find you house full of kidlet friends of varying<br/>
ages and skills.<br/>
<br/>
A child is probably physically able to learn to read and write<br/>
when he can reach over his head with his right arm and grab his<br/>
left earlobe.  A child is probably ready to use shading and<br/>
perspective type skills in art, if, when he draws a picture of a<br/>
house and himself and someone he loves, his own head is below the<br/>
ridgepole of the house (both work equally well for girl<br/>
children).  If you have a game/craft/ activity planned for a<br/>
party or suddenly present group, these can be handy dandy<br/>
benchmarks to make sure you are neither frustrating nor boring<br/>
most of the participants.  I was told by a teacher friend from<br/>
Zimbabwe that the arm over the head trick is commonly used as<br/>
part of school admission.<br/>
