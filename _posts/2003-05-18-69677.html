&gt; new and ask the easy questions.  (After a week of reading.)  And it is<br/>
&gt; *definitely* okay to ask about the SC conference, even if you are the<br/>
&gt; umpty-umpth person asking.  In fact, even though it would be tad<br/>
&gt; repetitive, it would be GREAT to have someone new, or newly &quot;aware&quot; ask<br/>
&gt; about it every single day between now and August.<br/>

Californian coming through! Robyn & her crew will be here! YAY!<br/>

I seem to be able to draw folks from all over the country, but getting people <br/>
from SC is TOUGH! <br/>
