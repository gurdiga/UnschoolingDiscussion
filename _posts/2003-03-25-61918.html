TV. He just got a Star Wars board game, which he loves, so he&#39;s been<br/>
thinking a lot about SW. Yesterday he asked us to get the original trilogy<br/>
to watch again. We did. Between the time he got up this morning - around<br/>
10:30 - and the time he went to bed - 11:30, he watched all three movies AND<br/>
Friends and That 70&#39;s Show.<br/>
<br/>
He also did the following (at least):<br/>
Rode his bike.<br/>
Played with some friends on the block, outside and in.<br/>
Talked with a friend on the phone.<br/>
Ate three meals (well, maybe 2.5)<br/>
Played his Star Wars board game with himself.<br/>
Went over his lines with me from &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; for our class tomorrow<br/>
Played with the dog<br/>
Cuddled with me and his sister<br/>
Read Ranger Rick<br/>
Told me stories and ideas he has<br/>
Danced<br/>
<br/>
YMMV,<br/>

In our house, we spent 3 hours watching Don Giovanni (it&#39;s really long and it <br/>
has swords!), napping part of the time.  Before that we spend 3 1/2 hours at <br/>
the park.  After Don Giovanni we played in the sanbox, the dirt pile, with <br/>
neighborhood kids, screamed and hit Daddy for a while when it was time to <br/>
come in and then napped again watching Don Giovanni.  Oh, and we colored in a <br/>
paperdoll cut out like Joe from Blues Clues and used scissors and lots of <br/>
tape to make a house for him.  (I got a pack of 40 paperdoll cut outs from an <br/>
arts supply catalogue and they come in a variety of skin tones.  We have an <br/>
asian Joe right now.)  We also fed the cats, fish and worms that eat our <br/>
garbage.  And we played a new Freddy Fish game on the computer and spent an <br/>
hour in the tub.<br/>

cool because we were at a pond yesterday watching some Canada geese. Trevor <br/>
talked about the geese migrating and then moved on to Monarch butterflies and <br/>
sea turtles migrating. He then brought me a bird field guide and read to me <br/>
about the Canada geese. <br/>
  Right now, we&#39;re watching The Wizard of Oz. (Great movie but my God, it&#39;s <br/>
LONG when you watch it 4 or 5 times per week.) <br/>

gets just a bit longer.  I tried The Magic Flute, which I think Tia suggested <br/>
eons ago, but they haven&#39;t been as interested in it as Don Giovanni.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago I was getting too much Tchaikovsky with The Nutcracker and <br/>
Swan Lake.  Now I&#39;m wondering if there is such a thing as too much Mozart?  <br/>
They&#39;ve been helping their father burn cds too and love to watch the cd play <br/>
on the screen.  My little 3 and 4 year old apples sure didn&#39;t fall too far <br/>
from that tree!<br/>
