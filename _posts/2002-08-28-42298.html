<div id="ygrps-yiv-960216560">After all the discussuion about movies, music, morlaity, etc... I did have a question that I would like some input for - although I may already know what the response will be ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I rented Lord of the Rings. My 8 yr. old really wanted to see it. It was late when we sat down to watch it - so she was already in bed. After viewing it - I thought it too scary, with the monsters and all...  I told her this, and she &quot;promised not to have nightmares&quot; - like one could promise such a thing ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be irresponsible. If we watch it and it seems to scary - she will still want to watch it. She is not going to self-regulate and say...&quot;this is too scary...&quot; we went through this with Jurassic park.  <br/>
<br/>
I then thought that we could read the book together, because then the monsters aren&#39;t always so vivid - but I remembered that I attempted to read Stephen King&#39;s Pet Cemetary as a 5th grader - and never finished because it was too scary...<br/>
<br/>
So what do you think...<br/>

  &gt; And Shakespeare is too intense for young kids, or at least my young <br/>
  &gt; kids.  But when they&#39;re older, I would read Shakespeare with my kids. <br/>
  &gt; Books and even some tv shows and movies are  more comfortable for me <br/>
  &gt; because I can sit and pause the reading or pause the movie and <br/>
  &gt; discuss what is immoral with my kids. I can say this person is acting <br/>
  &gt; wrong and these were the consequences of their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
  Hmmm....I read Shakespeare to my young ones (mostly sonnets though.)  Really, <br/>
  I read them whatever I&#39;m reading...my oldest loves to be read to.<br/>
<br/>
  However, if you make a point to know what your children are reading, or <br/>
  watching or listening to in music can&#39;t you discuss the consequences.  Here <br/>
  is much milder version than raping a 12 yr old or other things discussed.<br/>
<br/>
  My son Andrew adores Thomas the Tank Engine.  He reads the books (even on his <br/>
  own he&#39;ll look at the pictures for hours), collects the trains, watches the <br/>
  videos, wears the clothes ect (I think you get the idea.)  One day I was <br/>
  watching the video with him and heard the following &quot;Thomas and Henry felt <br/>
  sorry for James but they teased him anyway.&quot;  Well, I don&#39;t want my son to <br/>
  learn that it is ok to tease people no matter what the circumstances.  For a <br/>
  while, I took the videos away.  However, that didn&#39;t seem entirely fair.  He <br/>
  derived so much pleasure and learned so much from the Thomas stuff I gave <br/>
  them back.  I watched this particular one with him several times and pointed <br/>
  out that wasn&#39;t very nice.<br/>
<br/>
  My point is: it doesn&#39;t matter if it is books or videos or music they will be <br/>
  exposed to things that go against any family&#39;s personal values.  Just the <br/>
  same way as we point out wrong in a book or video can&#39;t we do the same with <br/>
  music (if we know what they are listening to?)<br/>
<br/>
  I was a child that the more something was forbidden the more I wanted <br/>
  it...leading to dabblings in over drinking and other unsavory things...I hope <br/>
  that I learned enough from that to give my children reasonable freedom.  How <br/>
  much that is depends a lot on how the world is 10 yrs from now!<br/>

<br/>
I think it depends on  the child. My then 6 yo saw it at the movies  - he sat on dh&#39;s lap and talked about special fx - he is really into how they make movies and so the scenes were less frightening for him as he knew they weren&#39;t real.I have read/am reading the books to him and some ithers..They all love the books, talk lots about the film and the novels, the characters and choices, and ove watching our DVD of the film...Leonie W. <br/>

pain of having nightmares.<br/>
<br/>
I have watched movies with Rain, and whsipered to her at certain scenes<br/>
&quot;this part is scary&quot; or gross or sad or whatever. Not so much anymore,<br/>
but a couple of years ago it helped her to be prepared. Sometimes she&#39;d<br/>
leave the room during a scene, or cover her eyes and ask me to tell her<br/>
when that part was over. <br/>
<br/>
I think, though, that if she were worried that I&#39;d decide the movie was<br/>
too scary for her and not let her watch the rest, she&#39;d probably do her<br/>
best to hide her fear or discomfort. She might not feel comfortable<br/>
covering her eyes or leaving the room, either. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not really self regulating if you still have the power to take the<br/>
video away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033411111">I also am going through the same dilemma, 9 yr old son wants to see it.  My husband and I have seen it also and I was so stressed out after watching it I felt like a basketcase.  Very intense!!  Loved it but intense!  I really want to watch it with my son but I am so torn over it.  IMO  I have a responsibility to try and protect my children from things that they aren&#39;t emotionally ready to handle, But,  I also don&#39;t want to stifle or keep them too sheltered.  I do think that age appropriateness does have a place somewhere in parenting, but it is so hard to know where.  We had the same issue with Jurassic Park too.  Did let him watch it tho&#39; and he loved it but now he has said some &quot;swear&quot; words to other kids and they hadn&#39;t heard them before, so then of course I bore the brunt of that from the other parents.  It is so hard to know!  Kelli<br/>

  something like this will be forbidden if she ends up with nightmares, she<br/>
  may force herself to stay for parts that trouble her because the opportunity<br/>
  to watch something like this may be taken away and this may be her only<br/>
  chance. If she knows it will always be an option to use her own judgement<br/>
  and learn from misjudgements, she&#39;ll test and get a feel for her own limits.<br/>
  She will misjudge some things, but that&#39;s part of the process.<br/>

Yes, that has always been bothersome to me as a visual reader.<br/>
(DARN that look-say, although in this case even people who move their lips to <br/>
read are likely to confuse those two characters!)<br/>
<br/>
In the movie, I suppose maybe to make the races easier to distinguish, the <br/>
two humans (Boromir and Aragon) looked quite a bit too much like one another <br/>
for my tastes.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes in casting a movie people aren&#39;t careful to get really different <br/>
looking people and it&#39;s hard for me to get the characters straight at first.  <br/>
That happened with Sum of all Fears.<br/>

body shapes and face shapes.<br/>
<br/>
You realize there&#39;s no legitimate excuse for having characters be visually<br/>
confusing after seeing Seven Samurai. The movie&#39;s Japanese so there&#39;s no<br/>
variation in hair color or race. (And it&#39;s black and white to boot.) Yet<br/>
each character is distictive.<br/>
<br/>
England is really good at choosing actors with very intersting, distinctive<br/>
faces. Maybe it&#39;s because they have a good foundation of local theater so<br/>
there&#39;s lots of actors but an awareness that there&#39;s not a vast enough pool<br/>
that they can make do with just the beautiful ones. So they have to resort<br/>
to relying purely on talent alone ;-)<br/>

If it&#39;s any consolation, I was well into my first reading of the Lord of the<br/>

I realized that those were 2 different people, not 1!  I was vastly confused<br/>

are others they must live down by the river! Wait! I live down by the <br/>
river... Anyway, today Darin was off work (first day in a few months! yea!) <br/>
and we were just having fun, catching up on some errands, hanging out and <br/>
Jack wore his Spiderman mask almost all day. (I talked him out of his full <br/>
costume, as it is getting a tad too small.) It is a cloth *mask* that fits <br/>
over his head with two eye holes. It fits just like the *real* Spiderman <br/>
mask. He wore it through Lowe&#39;s, Walmart, Pets Smart, the car wash, Olive <br/>
Garden (he lifted it up to just above his mouth) and Barnes and Noble. We got <br/>
stares, we got glares, we got smiles and heard whispered comments and laughs. <br/>
He climbed under a shelving unit at Lowe&#39;s and got turned around. I was <br/>
measuring some wood and wasn&#39;t being a good pay-attention Mom and he found <br/>
himself lost. So Jack did what Jack is supposed to do and went to the front <br/>
of the store and asked to have his Mom and Dad paged. Problem! Jack wouldn&#39;t <br/>
tell them his name, he insisted he IS Spiderman, and his parents are dead and <br/>
he is being raised by his Aunt and Uncle... Needless to say I knew who they <br/>
meant when over the intercom I heard, &quot;Would the parents or aunt and uncle of <br/>
Spiderman please come to the customer service desk. Your child is waiting,&quot; <br/>
then after just a few seconds, we heard this &quot;Ummm Your Spiderman is <br/>
waiting.&quot; &lt;g&gt; Darin couldn&#39;t go to the desk, he was laughing too hard.<br/>
I know we are different, weird, unusual, funny, people and I love it! I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. <br/>

a  different area to Woods. Umm, I can&#39;t remeber what Merry&#39;s <br/>

cyber-space :-)<br/>
I&#39;m off to the Maryland Rennaissance Festival later this month to <br/>
listen to people putting on fake british accents. Last year I got <br/>
complimented on my attempt but was told I said some words <br/>
badly. Ahem.<br/>
