<div id="ygrps-yiv-719392091">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question about children&#39;s tempers. How do you all deal with your children&#39;s tempers? My child had quite a short fuse and I may be wrong, but it appears like he over-reacts to things that not worth getting so upset over. An example of this would be playstation games. He gets so frustrated that he yells at the screen, throws things. I&#39;m baffled. <br/>
<br/>
I would like suggestions on how to handle such things. This also occurs when I ask him to help with certain things or activities. Anger is fine, but throwing things or knocking things over in fury is a bit much for me and not a very constructive way to deal with anger. I&#39;m fairly laid back, and thought I&#39;d ask for input on this as I don&#39;t feel this is a learned behavior, but just one of his personality traits I would guess??? <br/>

of which I&#39;m not aware (or didn&#39;t make the top three).<br/>

We helped him &quot;learn to breathe&quot;--to calm down by deep breathing when he felt <br/>
frustration rise.<br/>
<br/>
He started learning karate when he was nine.  He still goes.  It&#39;s good in <br/>
lots of ways for that.<br/>
<br/>
He outgrew it, but it&#39;s hard to say &quot;outgrew&quot; with the other factors.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think kids will keep the frustration for a lifetime if the parents are <br/>
supportive and patient.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402379569">We have dealt with this somewhat here with Joseph. Sierra too but her&#39;s<br/>
wasn&#39;t anger. It was more her just getting upset about something and<br/>
crying.....a lot. For her, it helped to let her cry and be alone and calm<br/>
down some. Nothing we did would help right away. After a while, I would hold<br/>
her and tell her to breath. She would then calm down some more. Talking at<br/>
that time didn&#39;t help at all. I would only be able to talk to her about what<br/>
happened long after she was calm.<br/>
<br/>
With Joseph, he would get angry. Real angry over things, like you said, that<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to be a big deal. What really helped me help him, was to see<br/>
that it *was* a problem for him. It helped for me to try and understand what<br/>
he was feeling. To really understand that for him to get that upset, it was<br/>
a very big deal to him. So once I looked at it that way, I was able to talk<br/>
to him about what he felt and why and how we could both figure something out<br/>
so that he could handle it better when it happened again. Talking a lot to<br/>
Joseph, and empathizing with him about how he felt helped him to manage it<br/>
better. He seemed to take some comfort in me just trying tounderstand. I&#39;m<br/>
sure his getting older was a key too. It took a lot of patience and<br/>
understanding and talking on our part first though in order for him to take<br/>
care of what he was feeling.<br/>

 <br/>
Hi,  I’m new to the group but this one really caught my attention,  my 6<br/>
year old is like that especially with his PS2 games… he gets so upset<br/>
that you can just hear him yelling and literally crying at the screen….<br/>
Anyhow what worked for us….  I took him aside and told him it was only a<br/>
game and he could keep trying and then I told him that when he felt that<br/>
way about a game he needed to pause it,  put the controller down,  and<br/>
take 10 deep breaths… then go back to the game,  he’s been doing it ever<br/>
since and it’s worked…  <br/>
 <br/>
Just my 2 cents..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-514060759">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I did something similar to this last night with Max. Today was much <br/>
better. We talked about anger, frustration, and dealing with it. He <br/>
gets so uptight that I&#39;m afraid he&#39;s going to break the controller or <br/>
something else. So it&#39;s something we&#39;ll continue to work on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766131538">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for replying. With Max, we discussed this quite a bit last <br/>
night. I also mentioned to him a relative that we have who is a real <br/>
King Baby and as an adult throws tantrums. Max and I have discussed <br/>
how silly this person looks, and refuse to go to holiday family <br/>
gatherings or dinners if he&#39;s there since you can bet he&#39;ll make some <br/>
dramatic move. We discussed this person&#39;s angry tantrums, as we have <br/>
in the past,  and how silly this man looks acting this way. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Max realized until I mentioned this person how he <br/>
appeared to others who witness his extreme anger. So this was good. <br/>
Hopefully by our plan. like your&#39;s, to have a time out to become <br/>
centered again we will work through this. It&#39;s only a game. Today was <br/>
a lot better!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150553025">When my Amanda (12 1/2) gets over-frustrated and angry, she resorts to<br/>
yelling and crying.  I have tried all kinds of things, but what works for<br/>
her is for me to come over and sit next to her and say very calmly, &quot;It<br/>
sounds like you are frustrated/angry/upset.  What happened?  Can  you tell<br/>
me?&quot;  Then I let her vent and explain what happened.  Often times, it is her<br/>
not being able to get a bead set straight in her beadwork, or something not<br/>
cooking properly.  If she cannot tell me right then in the midst of it, I<br/>
will sit with her a while to help her feel comforted.  Then she will be able<br/>
to tell me.  I try to see things from her perspective and that helps me to<br/>
understand why she is so upset.  We go through this fairly often.  Amanda<br/>
has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome and ADHD so she is not emotionally at her age level.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14495231">I&#39;ve been wanting to respond to this thread.<br/>
<br/>
As we&#39;ve said we don&#39;t always know how things are being handled in other<br/>
people&#39;s homes.  Maybe people are doing more than they are saying.   That<br/>
being said,,,,<br/>
<br/>
 I hate to hear that people are cutting off something from their children<br/>
that could really be a passion for them.<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s is video games, puzzles and such.   And yes,  he does get upset<br/>
sometimes with the games,  but then we stop for a little  and talk about how<br/>
to deal with those feelings.  We are learning all the time about how to do<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
You all might be doing that, you might not be.   But if we just remove our<br/>
children from those situations and not help them to work through it?   How<br/>
are they going to learn?<br/>
<br/>
Every person gets energy in different ways,  my son gets it from video<br/>
games, I don&#39;t.   I love being outside, he doesn&#39;t.  But I will not tell him<br/>
that he can&#39;t play them.  Or try and stear him away from it.   I want him to<br/>
know himself.<br/>
<br/>
I will continue to talk with him and encourage him in what he likes.  Do<br/>
those things with him.<br/>
<br/>
If I say,  &quot;OK, its time to go out and do this now....&quot;   it&#39;s not<br/>
benefitting anyone and its not allowing unschooling to unfold in a way that<br/>
can be amazing.<br/>

&gt; Yes it does help Heather, thanks! I can&#39;t handle that stuff either or<br/>
&gt; extreme violence. I will have nightmares. I&#39;m just too sensitive. So yes,<br/>
&gt; perhaps it&#39;s having a negative effect on Max. He&#39;s building a wood model<br/>
&gt; tonight and is MUCH calmer. I&#39;ll encourage more of this.  Perhaps<br/>
encourage<br/>
&gt; other things besides so much PS2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you!<br/>

&gt; &gt; My 6 year old son is like this.  He gets easily<br/>
&gt; &gt; overstimulated.  &gt; I am the same way, so I totally understand.  If I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t get out I can&#39;t sleep at night and feel really<br/>
&gt; &gt; angry.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s got something to do with<br/>
&gt; &gt; personality.  I&#39;m pretty laid back, just high energy<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I can&#39;t stop thinking about stuff =)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does that help?<br/>
