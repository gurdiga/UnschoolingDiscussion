<div id="ygrps-yiv-941877071">i wouldnt worry about reading. isaac said he couldnt read and the truth is<br/>
that he didnt like reading and he didnt read often. but he would read any<br/>
lego catalog and that eventually led to chess manuals. and he is almost 9<br/>
and just read his first novel. so relax and trust your kid. they all read<br/>
eventually given the opportunity and support.<br/>
