Ned, I would hate to see you go.......If I didn&#39;t like what you said,  and I <br/>
wanted to tell you in a way that it was said above,I would tell you <br/>
personally. Honestly, I would not even respond and would have just deleted <br/>
it. It would have just wasted my time and energy.<br/>
Ned, you have changed my life in a way that I was getting comfortable about <br/>
certain things and I needed a jolt back. <br/>
Now they have pass the legislation about medical records no longer need you <br/>
permission to share and view your medical records......which will cause me to <br/>
get more private. So, I wonder how many people will be taking a look.....They <br/>
are already using you grocery store cards against you....<br/>
I guy had slipped on the floor and they was able to obtain his store card <br/>
info (cause when you sign up with some of them, your have to use your SS#) <br/>
and saw that bought alcohol. Well, the case was dropped because of that.<br/>
Now they are looking at purchases like who buys mid eastern products.....<br/>
I don&#39;t take being invaded like that very well.......<br/>
There was a question on a registration for an eye exam. It ask if you had any <br/>
sexual diseases... ( looked crazed for a moment....they ask this of a 6 year <br/>
old....)<br/>
I am just wondering.....how many computers will that go into and who is <br/>
peaking.....<br/>
