<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077443670">Not sure how different your American edition of Time is from ours, but<br/>
the Canadian Feb. 20 edition has an incredible article about the<br/>
Google guys (Larry Page, etc): &quot;an exclusive look at the $100 billion<br/>
empire...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is that it shows these guys at meetings, with Lego<br/>
strewn all over the table, also shows a recruiting tool they used for<br/>
hiring -- a billboard with this question: First 10-digit prime found<br/>
in consecutive digits of e (the inquisitive and accurate could then<br/>
type in the answer, followed by .com, answer another (trickier)<br/>
question, and could then get info leading to a job interview with Google!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s a great read, and I found it reassuring to know there are<br/>
all these creative minds out there finding homes (and incomes) for<br/>
themselves! <br/>

ï¿½Google has long excelled at tracking down Web links on obscure  <br/>
topics, from Asian floral designs to Zambian hairstyles. But now its  <br/>
improved search box also provides quick, direct answers to many  <br/>
common queries. Here are some tips and tricks: Why hasn&#39;t my package  <br/>
arrived? To find out, type in a tracking number for any major  <br/>
shipping service. Is my father&#39;s flight on time? Enter the name of an  <br/>
airline followed by a flight number to check on a plane&#39;s status. Is  <br/>
it going to snow? Type in &quot; weather&quot; and any city and state for a  <br/>
quick (illustrated) report. How good is Brokeback Mountain? Type &quot;  <br/>
movie:...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the article that ended up with DH taking a class on C++ game <br/>
programming - the billboard in the article led him to look up &quot;e&quot; <br/>
which then got him to thinking how cool it would be to write a program <br/>
to solve the question on the billboard which then led to downloading a <br/>
free C++ compiler and getting a book on C++ and making a program that <br/>
calculates prime numbers and prime factorizations of input numbers and <br/>
then a class (at a local comm coll taught by a co-worker of mine, <br/>
turns out there are 3 students in the class). He&#39;s having a great time.<br/>
