<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198413299">I just saw on another list that there is an egroup dedicated to &quot;those who<br/>
like to view naked little girls aged 4-10&quot;.<br/>

I would like to write to the Powers That Be of eGroups and get this trash<br/>
dumped. Who do I contact?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844399657">just reviewed the TOS for egroups, and if they follow thier own rules, they<br/>
should remove the group.<br/>
Please email  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:support@egroups.com">support@egroups.com</a>?subject=TOS Violation<br/>
Please tell them to refer to Item 4 b - Member Conduct, as well as Item<br/>
5 - Special Admonitions for International Use. Also, make sure you tell<br/>
them which group you&#39;re referring to.<br/>

eGroups does have adult content groups, but they do have provisions for<br/>
groups that &quot;harm minors in any way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As of now, a &quot;lolita&quot; site has been removed but the group still exists. The<br/>
FBI has been contacted.&gt;<br/>

<div>I wrote into egroups custumer service and demanded that they take out that 
list.&nbsp; I should have gone further and demanded they file a complaint with 
the proper authorities.&nbsp; At the bottom of every list site homepage, there 
is a link to the customer service.&nbsp; </div>

don&#39;t know who you contact or even if you can do anything about it.&nbsp; 
Apparently that is accurate though.&nbsp; I went there and checked it out.&nbsp; 
There are not messages in their archives, and the group was formed Aug. 29 of 
this year.&nbsp; Also they put the description (which is translated word for 
word above in Valerie&#39;s post,) in french.&nbsp; My french was good enough to 
translate and verify that it does indeed say what Valerie reported.&nbsp; I 
suppose they thought to hide their intent by putting it in french...who 
knows?&gt;&gt;<br><br>Nanci K.<br></p></html></div>
