<div id="ygrps-yiv-431125511">I just joined this list a couple of days ago and have been too <br/>
overwhelmed by the abundance of posts to read everything, but this <br/>
message stood out for me because I have the opposite situation.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 6yod, too, who is in 1st grade, but she is falling behind in <br/>
reading. She has been diagnosed with ADD and the school is saying she <br/>
will need a tutor for the summer in order to catch up to the reading <br/>
level of her classmates.<br/>
<br/>
I considered homeschooling or unschooling when she was little and <br/>
decided to put her in public schools because it was the easy route. I <br/>
figured if it didn&#39;t work, I could always change tactics later. Well, <br/>
it&#39;s not working. I want my daughter to learn to read at her own pace. I <br/>
don&#39;t want her to feel there is something wrong with her because she&#39;s <br/>
not meeting her school&#39;s expectations. She&#39;s not dumb by any means, and <br/>
I&#39;m worried that if she continues in public school, she will begin to <br/>
feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
She loves to read and write when it&#39;s on her own terms, usually in <br/>
conjunction with some art project that she has come up with, but she <br/>
dreads the homework from school. I&#39;m not sure I can get through the rest <br/>
of the school year without losing my mind. I&#39;m tired of struggling with <br/>
her every night to do her homework. I&#39;m tired of struggling with her <br/>
every morning to get ready for school.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to stop; I want out of the stress. I want to get the public <br/>
school environment out of our house, out of our family life. I want to <br/>
love my kids for who they are and I want to be able to stop focussing on <br/>
who they aren&#39;t. I find myself getting so aggravated by the whole <br/>
situation that sometimes I actually wish for medication that might help <br/>
my daughter pay attention to what the school wants her to pay attention <br/>
to. When I find myself wanting to medicate her, which is the last place <br/>
I want to go, I know something major has to change.<br/>
<br/>
I trust that life will teach her what she needs to know. I hate to see <br/>
her love for learning disappear. So I&#39;m thinking some form of <br/>
homeschooling or unschooling might be the answer, but I don&#39;t want her <br/>
to feel isolated from the world and from friends. How do I find other <br/>
families in my area who are doing this, too?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice.<br/>

Go places during &quot;school hours&quot;.  The happy kids you find are not<br/>
in school then.  In my experience, morning hours are more likely<br/>
to be unschoolers - afternoon homeschoolers, but YMMV.<br/>

Most kids have way more enemies and tormenters at school than they have <br/>

<br/>
Release her from being imprisoned with torment and enemies.<br/>

Read this to feel better about the reading, and don&#39;t send her to school <br/>
tomorrow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131856693">Hello to all - I am new to this group - I felt the urge to respond to Cheryl&#39;s posting .... so here goes! <br/>
I have 3 kids: boy - 9; girl - 7 & boy - 5. I started homeschooling (& deschooling) them 2 years ago because my then 2nd grade son did not meet the schools reading level requirements. They told me &quot;he is above average on most of the other areas, however since he cannot read well he does not produce enough work to pass&quot;. They wanted to hold him back in 2nd grade again. No way. How boring would that be for him? And how stupid of them to think this would help him learn to read better? He was also always getting in trouble for making &quot;doodles&quot; on his worksheets instead of doing the work. <br/>
<br/>
We have been out of the ps system for 2 years now & I am happy to report, things are going great. Since my younger two were never in school - they are fine. My oldest, who according to the ps had reading problems, is reading away!!!! He LOVES to read now - the trick was to let him work at his own pace (unschooling :o) and to let him read what he likes (Harry Potter! -- he can&#39;t put the books down!!). His doodles have improved too - he is a far better artist than anyone in the house. I bought him an M.C. Escher book & he took off from there. Had I left him in ps, we might not have discovered this talent (he surely would have still been getting in trouble for it!!!). <br/>
<br/>
I am a firm believer that children belong at home with Mom & Dad showing them the ropes - my son tells me all the time how he is so glad he is not going to ps anymore. If only I had realized my true feelings before he was forced through 3 years of ps. My other children are very happy too. They love being able to stay with me all day (and I feel I am very blessed to have them with me all day). <br/>
<br/>
If you do not like how things are going, you should follow your gut. You are her mother & mother knows best!  It sounds like things are pretty stressful for her (and you) -- if it continues in this way, she might start shutting down / blocking out what is bothering her. Maybe ... just a thought. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps, <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Listen to your heart, Cheryl. It&#39;s as simple as that. Just don&#39;t <br/>
bring her back to school tomorrow. Let them know she will be <br/>
homeschooling from now on. Lots of us here have done just that. It <br/>
really is that easy to get back to a sane, joyous, healthy lifestyle <br/>
for your family.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I trust that life will teach her what she needs to know.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! Unschooling will allow her to unfold and blossom at her own <br/>
rate. Don&#39;t make her spend another day in a school system that is <br/>
hurting her. Get her out of there and start living your life together <br/>
NOW without the interference of school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;So I&#39;m thinking some form of homeschooling or unschooling might be <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the answer, but I don&#39;t want her to feel isolated from the world and <br/>
from friends. How do I find other families in my area who are doing <br/>
this, too?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live? There are lots of homeschooling groups around. We <br/>
can help you find them.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

Yep just how i met my unregular husband. Being out and up late. I don&#39;t go out much anymore cause we are pretty happy staying up together. Especially after the kids finally fall asleep.  :-b<br/>

and do stuff in the afternoon, than the morning.  We tend to stay up later<br/>
and get up later than some.<br/>
<br/>
I think I know what you mean though.  Lots of home&quot;schoolers&quot; do their<br/>
