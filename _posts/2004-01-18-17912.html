<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060816359">Janene is playing.  She walks up to Lexie and says, &quot;see my new baby?  <br/>
She&#39;s a new baby, she was just born.  And I was just married last week.  <br/>
Would you like to see my groom?  I get to keep it.&quot;  I had just been <br/>
listening, without looking.  but at this I turn around to look and I see <br/>
her with a dress up bit of lace.  Lexie is laughing, and says it&#39;s not a <br/>
groom, silly, it&#39;s a veil (I can&#39;t spell it), a groom is the man you <br/>
marry.&quot;  Janene laughs and said, oops, I guess I got confussed. <br/>
