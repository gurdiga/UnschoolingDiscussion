<div id="ygrps-yiv-655310719">-=-&quot;Babies should be fed on their mother&#39;s milk until they are six months <br/>
old. If they are weaned later than this, they remain much too connected with the <br/>
maternal forces of inheritance and become over-dependent upon these forces. We <br/>
can readily understand this statement made by Rudolf Steiner. At the end of <br/>
its first half year, the child is already trying to sit up. In this striving, <br/>
as will be more fully explained later, those forces of uprightness show <br/>
themselves that are working in the baby. They are a sign of how the individuality is <br/>
taking possession of the physical body. At six months, the child may reach <br/>
such a stage of development that it can to a certain extent free itself from the <br/>
forces of inheritance. This freedom is most easily achieved in the domain of <br/>
nutrition. At half a year the child is able to digest other than the mother&#39;s <br/>
milk without any difficulty. Besides this, observation teaches us that the <br/>
child who remains too long at the breast comes to resemble its parent closely. In <br/>
the past, when people loved to see in a child the image of its mother, <br/>
children were still given the breast, even when they could already run about. Among <br/>
peasants and gypsies this was the usual thing - and may still be.&quot;<br/>

So....  <br/>
This guy and his followers thought children looked like their mothers becuase <br/>
they nursed too long??  I guess he ignored physical resemblance in kids <br/>
adopted out, or bottlefed?   So teaching this made-up kind of science is as crazy <br/>
as some of the revisionist kind of science and history taught in some of the <br/>
homeschooling curriculae of the Christian homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s embarrassing when it&#39;s homeschooling. When it&#39;s for big bucks in a <br/>
private school, you get what you pay for, and if you pay extra you can get <br/>
extra-crazy.<br/>

Quotes from an article of someone who is somewhat a practicing Waldorf mom:<br/>
<br/>
-=-He is not in a Waldorf school at this time, but has been raised saying <br/>
morning greetings, food blessings, and under carefully planned &quot;good modeled <br/>
behavior&quot;. He is not in a class, but we do circle songs, bake bread & make soup, <br/>
cut vegetables, wet on wet paint, and do many of the things that I know do go <br/>
on in the kindergarten setting. The children he plays with are all in the <br/>
Waldorf school. He is a happy, well adjusted and friendly little boy. Very well <br/>
rounded and very smart!<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is my belief, that whether a child is fed from the breast, bottle, or <br/>
spoon, it is important to look at the whole picture before making wild <br/>
assumptions about developmental or character flaws and blaming it on breastfeeding, <br/>
co-family sleeping, eating grains, or meats, wearing red or yellow, sleeping <br/>
upstairs or downstairs, etc. It seems purely ridiculous to me. And has anyone <br/>
even considered temperament in labeling and behavioral problems?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
(Off to see what wearing red or yellow or sleeping upstairs or downstairs is <br/>
supposed to do. Gypsies wore red and yellow and HAD no upstairs.  Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
more anti-gypsy sentiment. &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>

In your travels, would you post anything you might come across that says  <br/>
contemporary Waldorf people have disavowed the racist and non-breastfeeding  <br/>
stuff?  I&#39;ll try to look around, too.<br/>
 <br/>
The Waldorf families I know are all home-birthing, extended breastfeeding  <br/>
co-sleepers, so these quotes don&#39;t make sense in light of my experience.   I&#39;m <br/>
thinking these people, my friends, are rationalizing the ugly parts of  <br/>
Steiner&#39;s history away in order to be claiming his philosophy.  I&#39;d like to  know <br/>
what that rationalization is.  <br/>

I went to the breastfeeding link.  It seems her rationalization was  &quot;do what <br/>
you think is right for yourself and your kids.&quot;  The same one the  <br/>
school-at-homers on our local list use for forcing their kids to do their school  work <br/>
before they can go on the field trip.  <br/>
 <br/>
Oh well.  I guess I&#39;ll have to ask my friends what their actual  <br/>
rationalizations are.<br/>
