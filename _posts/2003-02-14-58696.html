Fascinating.  What do you mean when you say &quot;&#39;unschooling&#39; way.&quot;  Can you <br/>
explain in a little more detail.  All the folks I have met have been willing <br/>
to put in the time and effort if the goal was important enough.  And lead <br/>
very fulfilled lives college or not.  This has not been your experience?<br/>
