<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mother is like this and her mother was too (&quot;oooohh!  you kids <br/>
are making me nervous!&quot; she would shriek all the time, while <br/>
nervously rubbing her shoulders.), and now as I grow older I see <br/>
more of this in myself.  Or maybe it isn&#39;t my age, but the level of <br/>
stress I have now with more children after all those 10 years with <br/>
one very laid back kid!  In any case I recognize some of these <br/>
characteristics people are describing in myself.  I have always <br/>
cried too easily in my opinion, and when I am concentrating on <br/>
something, I will practically jump out of my skin if someone <br/>
suddenly says something to me or comes into my periphiral(sp?) <br/>
vision from another room or touches me when I didn&#39;t know they were <br/>
so close, etc...  My girlfriend has told me for the past several <br/>
years that she doesn&#39;t like to talk to me while I drive!! I have <br/>
trouble doing simple things if there is too much going on in the <br/>
room.  I often don&#39;t like any help in the kitchen because of this, <br/>
and that bothers me because I want my children to be able to come in <br/>
and learn from watching and doing with me.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when I am present in the moment, or just very relaxed and <br/>
well-rested, this isn&#39;t an issue.  I can drive well and talk <br/>
fluidly, watch a movie while knitting (without making mistakes!), <br/>
read a story to my children while the 3 year old hums,  read a <br/>
recipe while my children ask me to lick the bowl or the beaters, <br/>
etc, etc, etc....<br/>
<br/>
Basically, what I&#39;m realizing is that I&#39;m not always a basket-case.  <br/>
There are times when everything just flows and nothing bothers me.  <br/>
It seems like this could also be helped by practising mindfulness <br/>
and breathing!  And, of course, getting enough rest...hmmm....This <br/>
is interesting to me.  Sorry to think &quot;outloud&quot;...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people are high strung.  Some of us would be considered very mellow!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true.  Most people consider me very laid-back and I am as long as I<br/>
can control the amount of energy bouncing around me.  I can take almost any<br/>
amount of chaos outside...but in the kitchen, even someone talking to me<br/>
stresses me out.<br/>
<br/>
I think sensitive people can be very mellow but finding out how to work your<br/>
environment is key, particularly if you want to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I absolutely must spend some time outside everyday if I want to<br/>
be pleasant by the end of the day.<br/>
