is that what you would recommend for any child who is healing from the school <br/>
experience?  what a great idea!  it seems particularly good for older kids.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of our best conversations and discoveries and jumping-off places have <br/>
been movies.  Videos, much better, because you can rewind and watch again and <br/>
pause to discuss.  Someone can watch it all again after the group is done.  <br/>
Conversations and comparisons will come up for years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching all Sam Rockwell&#39;s movies.  I&#39;m not in a big hurry, but <br/>
it&#39;s a project.  Some I&#39;m getting on DVD from Netflix.  They&#39;re not all <br/>
things I&#39;m keen to share with kids, but I do show them some good parts.  <br/>
Jerry and Tom is about violence and stupidity, but the scene changes are <br/>
really artsy, and some of the scenes (although violent and stupid) are <br/>
interesting, and funny.  And the acting is good.  So that&#39;s just for me, not <br/>
for me-and-kids.  But I did show my husband one scene in which Ted Danson has <br/>
a dramatic monolog, and there&#39;s a movie showing (made as part of the <br/>
production, so that the scenes fit in with the dialog) and that was fun.<br/>
<br/>
Other ways to get kids relaxed and talking are just games, toys, puzzles you <br/>
can work with them.  Riding in a car.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an essay I wrote a few years ago which was lost (sort of) for a while, <br/>
but it on line now.  I call it &quot;Leaning on a Truck&quot; but that&#39;s not its real <br/>
name:<br/>
