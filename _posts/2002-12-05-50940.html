<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911643363">In a book I am currently reading &quot;Bread Alone&quot; by Judith Ryan Hendricks<br/>
(not a particularly great novel - one I call a fine beach read) the<br/>
following dialogue takes place between two people in their early 30s (who<br/>
will end up together in the end, I can already surmise!) -<br/>
******************************************************************************<br/>
	&quot;Why did you drop out of school?&quot; I ask. He doesn&#39;t look up from his<br/>
coffee. &quot;Don&#39;t you want a degree?&quot;<br/>
	A tolerant smile. &quot;It&#39;s just a piece of paper that says you did what&#39;s<br/>
expected.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;It&#39;s too easy to trivialize things like education--or marriage--by saying<br/>
it&#39;s just a piece of paper.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Those things have already been trivialized. The purpose of going to<br/>
college isn&#39;t to learn, it&#39;s to get the paper. The purpose of the paper is<br/>
to get you the job so you can keep on doing what&#39;s expected.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;Are you really that cynical?&quot; I blow on my coffee to cool it, take a<br/>
tentative sip.<br/>
	&quot;I&#39;m not cynical. I&#39;m realistic. I like my life. I don&#39;t need any more<br/>
than what I have.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;That&#39; fine for now. You&#39;re young and strong. What about the future?&quot;<br/>
	&quot;The future is something dreamed up by insurance companies and high school<br/>
guidance counselors to keep you from enjoying the present.&quot;<br/>
	&quot;You&#39;re going to get old, Peter Pan. What if you get sick? What if--&quot;<br/>
	He laughs. &quot;I prefer to burn my bridges as I come to them.&quot;<br/>
******************************************************************************<br/>
Thought this list might enjoy it!<br/>
In aloha, Lee<br/>
