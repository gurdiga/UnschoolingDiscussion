<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658616236">Hello all! <br/>
The book &quot;How to talk so kids will listen & listen so kids will talk&quot; <br/>
was recently reccomended to me. I started reading it last night, and <br/>
it brought me to tears. All the things I learned from my parents I <br/>
had been passing on to my kids without realizing it. I was being so <br/>
hurtful! I feel like I could&#39;ve written that book, IF I had managed <br/>
to see the light BEFORE I read it. <br/>
We are new to homeschooling, newer to unschooling. My husband and I <br/>
are making major changes in our parenting and this book is our <br/>
new &quot;bible&quot;. If there is anyone who hasn&#39;t yet read this book- READ <br/>
IT! Its so simple and yet makes so much sense to me! <br/>
For the &quot;experts&quot;- Are there any other books you&#39;r reccommend to a <br/>
friend just starting this adventure? I have read so much, and I keep <br/>
finding books that really speak to me. I&#39;d love some suggestions.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Kerry<br/>
PS. I also started &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; this week- CAN YOU SAY <br/>
FABULOUS?!</div>

reinforced some of the odd beliefs I had picked up.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590427052">I&#39;ve lost her email address & wanted to give an update on Alice & the boys.<br/>
<br/>
We got to see them Thurs & Fri for the day & had a great time.  My 3 didn&#39;t<br/>
want them to leave.  Now all they&#39;ve been talking about is &quot;when can we go<br/>
to Maine & see Sam, Frank & Henry&quot;.  Now I&#39;m excited & looking at taking a<br/>
trip with just the kids myself.  Not as long as Alice.  I don&#39;t think my<br/>
husband would take us being gone for 2 months very well.  But we&#39;re looking<br/>
at some areas close to & in Fla.<br/>
<br/>
A really great idea they did was take Polaroid pics every day of something<br/>
to remind them of that day.  Alice made a notebook with protective sleaves<br/>
containing notebook paper to capture the day, where they were, who they<br/>
spent their day with & what they did.  It was so fascinating to thumb<br/>
through.  She plans to have the boys expanding it with more information when<br/>
they return home.  It was a great memory book.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best thing about their trip was what the boys spoke of as their<br/>
favorite experience.  Disney, Epcot & MGM were not even on the list.  They<br/>
talked about the Grand Canyon, the Pacific coastline, the redwood forests &<br/>
the people they met.  They made lots of new friends from Friends, friends of<br/>
friends & homeschool families, as well as all the family they were able to<br/>
reunit with on the trip.  The boys never even mentioned Disney.  My point is<br/>
the tourist stops & all their expenses were not even a highlight for the<br/>
kids, though Alice said they had a great time when they were there.  It&#39;s<br/>
nice to see kids enjoy the &quot;real America&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law will die when she hears of my plans for a trip alone with<br/>
the kids.  She couldn&#39;t believe anyone would attempt it.  So I&#39;ll have the<br/>
EMTs on standby when I get my plans lined up.</div>
