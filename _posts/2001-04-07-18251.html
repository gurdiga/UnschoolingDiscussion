&gt; If you think about it,legos uses a lot of math. My kids will go<br/>
&gt; hunting through the lego bin saying I need a double eight or a single<br/>
&gt; ten flat etc. They will figure out exactly how many blocks are<br/>
&gt; equivalent to what they need. Johanna<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, tons and tons of maths with Lego!  Spatial awareness, <br/>
planning, estimating, oh, i could go on!  But you know that he <br/>
plays with Lego cos he likes to, not becasue it&#39;s &#39;educational&#39; and I <br/>
think that&#39;s much more important ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If he wants help and support with formal maths learning, fine, find <br/>
out what he wants to do and help (she said, who&#39;s being a bit do-as-<br/>
I-say here) but you can also let him know that maths is just <br/>
another part of life, something in and around almost everything we <br/>
do (even writing essays, I kid you not, figuring out whether that <br/>
word will fit on this line or whether you need to start a new one, <br/>
knowing how big a piece of paper/how much paper you&#39;re going to <br/>
need for what you&#39;re doing...) and maybe he doesn&#39;t have to learn <br/>
all that formal stuff if he doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
Clear as mud?  oh, well, that&#39;s me *grin*<br/>

<br/>
Ratios.  Then know the different lengths of blocks and how to offset them and <br/>
how many to one and on and on.  They might not know the term &quot;ratio,&quot; but <br/>
when they learn it, pictures of different-length Lego blocks will certainly <br/>
make it easy for them to understand.<br/>
