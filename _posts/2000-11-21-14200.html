<div id="ygrps-yiv-462609537">When I asked if unschooling had failed, I wasnt talking about <br/>
children growing into failures.  I agree that money position statues <br/>
have nothing to do with failing or winning. I wanted to know if any <br/>
one out there had found that ps was a better option for their <br/>
children.Had unschooling itself failed them.  It was just a general <br/>
question.  <br/>
3 of my 4 older children left school with no qualifications.  One is <br/>
a mechanic, one head storeman and one a receptionist. My eldest, who <br/>
did get qualifictons, is in banking.  I would not say any of them had <br/>
failed.<br/>
