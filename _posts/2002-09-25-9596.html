<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661607090">Hi everyone:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So after that heading you are probably wondering whether it&#39;s drugs or<br/>
alcohol I&#39;m going to be referring too!!!  Neither.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the problem. I&#39;ve written before about my controlling mother who<br/>
not only doesn&#39;t believe in homeschooling (knows nothing about it), but<br/>
doesn&#39;t think I can &quot;do&quot; it, says we are hurting our kids, won&#39;t read<br/>
anything about homeschooling, let alone unschooling, blah blah blah..<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well I have found myself everytime she comes over to the house parading<br/>
Zak in front of her and showing her what he can do.  I bought a social<br/>
sciences book from E-Bay for grade 2 (whatever that is). Not only did it<br/>
turn out to be written in what looked liked the 70&#39;s but Zak answered<br/>
all the questions easily.  So I bought this book out in front of her<br/>
yesterday and was &quot;quizzing&quot; Zak on what he knew.  Naturally he (1) did<br/>
not want to be quizzed (2) I was interupting some other play of his for<br/>
this book stuff that he kept telling me was silly and he was busy.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have noticed a pattern of this behavior from myself.. So who has<br/>
experience of this and is there hope for me overcoming this addiction to<br/>
prove to my mother that Zak is learning &quot;something&quot; and I&#39;m not damaging<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Today the boys are happy and building tunnels and towers and generally<br/>
having a great time, without book quizzing or forcing them to read or<br/>
write about anything.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Your experiences, thoughts and comments would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

Hi, Dawn --<br/>
<br/>
I want to be encouraging, but I don&#39;t really know what to say.  I have<br/>
family members who are disapproving of homeschooling, but they keep<br/>
their comments mild with me.  Perhaps my (well-earned) reputation as a<br/>
tantrum-throwing bitch helps restrain them?  (I don&#39;t recommend the<br/>
tantrums, too demeaning, but a fierce reputation can have advantages. &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Do you feel free to cut down on the amount of time you spend with your<br/>
mom, or is that treated completely as her decision?<br/>
<br/>

PS  On a side subject, I acquired a current 2nd grade &quot;Social Studies<br/>
text&quot; just for grins, and I have to say I find it very mockable. (I paid<br/>
25 cents for it.) Here&#39;s a sample of the shallow information contained<br/>
within it:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Holidays are fun.  They are also interesting.  We have a reason for<br/>
celebrating each holiday.  You know why we celebrate Thanksgiving.  You<br/>
can learn why we celebrate Columbus Day, too.<br/>
    You can find out about Columbus Day or any other holiday in the<br/>
library.  A library is a place where you will find many books.  Some<br/>
books tell about a holiday, a person, or any other idea.  The librarian<br/>
can help you find books in the library.<br/>
    What is the reason that we celebrate Columbus Day?  We remember<br/>
Christopher Columbus on this day.  You can find out more about him in<br/>
the library.  The librarian will show you where to find books with<br/>
information.  then you can learn more about Columbus.&quot;</div>

The volume I bought is stamped &quot;discarded&quot;.  However, it&#39;s from the<br/>
Houghton-Mifflin series that seems to be one of the main approved Social<br/>
Studies series in California.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even want to imagine what the total dollars are spent on K-12<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234103407">Instead of trying to get the kids to perform, maybe you should just keep a <br/>
journal of the cool stuff, and send your mom copies from time to time.  Or <br/>
put it on a webpage where she can look when she wants to.  And the other <br/>
benefit would be you would have it someday to look back on.<br/>

I agree with Nancy!<br/>
<br/>
I went to Adult Children of Alcoholics weekly or more from before Kirby was <br/>
born until after Marty could express that he didn&#39;t want to stay in the <br/>
nursery.  Four years.   <br/>
<br/>
Changed my life hugely.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe a similar kind of experience that I had with my ex would help.<br/>
I had always sworn that I would never do the &quot;fighting in front of the<br/>
kids&quot;, nasty divorce<br/>
stuff.  Then I ended up repeatedly becoming infuriated with him, usually in<br/>
front of the kids.<br/>
It got really ugly.  He always seemed to be able to push my buttons<br/>
and get me fighting with him.  I&#39;m afraid it took a number of years to<br/>
finally figure out what<br/>
the main button was.  While I had long stopped caring what he thought of me<br/>
as a person<br/>
(I knew he wasn&#39;t ever going think I was a good person, but I knew I was),<br/>
I had this<br/>
need for him to believe that I was a good mother.  (I think that came from<br/>
my insecurities<br/>
about being a stay-at-home mother at a time when so many mothers were<br/>
entering the work force.)<br/>
When I finally realized that *nothing* I<br/>
did would change his beliefs on that subject (he had a strong need for me<br/>
*not* to be a good<br/>
mother) I was able to let go of it.  After that, he could annoy me, but he<br/>
never was able to<br/>
get me really angry again.  It really rotted his socks.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
