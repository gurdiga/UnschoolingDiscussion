<div id="ygrps-yiv-368214796">I am new to the group.  My son is only 3, but I taught him the majority<br/>
of stuff he knows online at safe kid sites and through books and<br/>
television.  We had to teach him the alphabet and phonics through<br/>
singing and reading so he could talk, he has never done a work sheet but<br/>
is learning how to print letters and read small words already.<br/>
<br/>
We do all this through games and just having fun.  I set no specific<br/>
time for it and when he gets tired of what we are doing he gets breaks<br/>
until he is ready for more.  <br/>
<br/>
I also made folders in my favorite file and bookmarked fun sites for<br/>
each thing like math and science and others.  When he wants to play with<br/>
the sites I just open one that is appropriate for him and let him have<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
You could set a time period and let the method prove itself to your dh,<br/>
kids learn better when they aren&#39;t forced to do something they don&#39;t<br/>
want to.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-190611257">Well, drop me an e-mail if he wants to. DH will be home Sunday, and every evening. Yes, no matter what, when it comes to doing new things with our children, uncertainy and nervousness are perfectly natural! We wouldn&#39;t be moms otherwise. &lt;g&gt; Playing is wonderful!!! Watch them carefully, and see what they&#39;re learning. Sharing, probably. Compromise maybe? Fine motor skills, definitely. Perhaps some math skills as they keep up with the number of cars they have? Go drag out some wooden blocks and sit down with them.... make some bridges and jumps and mazes/obstical courses for the cars, tables and chairs for the dolls. They&#39;ll probably join in and get some geometry and thinking and problem-solving practice. If they don&#39;t join in, no biggie, they&#39;ll remember it for sometime in the future. Unschooling isn&#39;t just about leaving them alone to do what they want to do, it&#39;s about doing things together and learning together. When lunchtime comes, ask who wants to help you cook. Use a recipe, and have your readers tell your non-readers what to get and how much of it you need. There&#39;s more math, and home ec - not to mention a big feeling of accomplishment they&#39;ll have. Eventually, you&#39;ll get to where you won&#39;t look for the educational value in things at all, but to begin with, it really helps to realize that they&#39;re learning no matter what they&#39;re doing.<br/>

<br/>
Well, you failed them by doing the other, right?  At least you&#39;re moving to <br/>
something cheaper!!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It definatly feels like I am being a lazy momma and they are having a ball <br/>
playing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They are having a ball LEARNING.  When you yourself change your view of what <br/>
learning looks like, you can be a happy unschooler!<br/>
<br/>
Save a copy of the post you made to begin this thread so you can look at it <br/>
again in a year and in five years.  Honestly.  You&#39;ll amaze yourself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I asked them whet they wanted to learn about and got 4 diff answers so we <br/>
went to the library yesterday and they all picked out books.  Some are <br/>
picture books BUT they are still books. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you said that in way of it being GOOD that they got books.  But did <br/>
you consider videos?  Kits?  A day trip to a nearby town with a supply shop, <br/>
museum, or something which could have given one of your kids an opportunity <br/>
to see their interest live and hands-on?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My 12 you is not and really does not like to read.  He checks out magic <br/>
books, and books with pictures mainly so I worry about him. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please consider looking into Howard Gardner&#39;s writings on multiple <br/>
intelligences.  You can find stuff to read online to give you an idea.  Go to <br/>
www.google.com and put in &quot;multiple intelligences&quot; and read!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My family does not accept HSing at all and when my mom calls mid morning <br/>
and asks if school is over for the day I get the &quot;hmmmm&quot; when I tell her we <br/>
are. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then tell her no, that learning doesn&#39;t tell time, and learning doesn&#39;t quit <br/>
for the day.  Learning doesn&#39;t have days off.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is it possible that my kids will suffer from this type of NON schooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t change your views of learning, yes.  They will suffer in the <br/>
reviews of whether unschooling reproduces using a curriculum.  It doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If you DO change your views, your family will benefit in many ways beyond <br/>
learning.<br/>

<br/>
Yes and yes.<br/>
<br/>
You should do the math to make you feel better.  In a &quot;school year,&quot; how many <br/>
hours are expected to be &quot;learning time&quot;?  Probably 180 days, six hours (NOT <br/>
six full hours, the middles of the hours aside from the lesson beginning, <br/>
getting settled in, putting stuff up, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Figure out how many hours are LEFT, and those are the hours you should <br/>
completely lighten up.<br/>
<br/>
Every time someone is intently learning, or even accidentally, casually <br/>
learning, count that one of the &quot;on&quot; hours.  <br/>
<br/>
After a few weeks, you&#39;ll stop counting.  But it will help for you to change <br/>
your perspective.<br/>
<br/>
And try to see what can be learned from dolls and trucks.<br/>

Just keep reading and reading,  to learn more about the unschooling part.  Unschooling.com message boards are great,   as far as your dh,  it probably will take more time for him to understand because if he&#39;s like mine, he&#39;s out working, not reading and researching.     <br/>
 <br/>
I am always printing out articles and ideas for mine,   I started with books, but that was too much for him.   Just nice little articles work for him.   That way he can read them before heading off for his work day.   Also, as I am reading I will often read him a passage that addresses his questions.<br/>
 <br/>
So many people have and have had all the same questions and frustrations that you are facing.  Very normal.     And for me,  about the time I think I&#39;m feeling really comfortable with the whole thing, something else pops up.     Back to reading and researching I go.<br/>
  <br/>
Heck,  if your children are excited to go to the library and check out interesting books,  that&#39;s great!   I&#39;ve had to even step back from that,  I think my son has somewhat ODed on reading,  don&#39;t know if that&#39;s possible,  but he&#39;s not interested in that right now.   He first read all Harry Potter books at age 6,  he is now 9.  Right now he is the official video game expert in residence,   I think for him its all part of deschooling or whatever you want to call in.    <br/>
 <br/>
I can also relate to the isolated feeling, I&#39;m having a hard time finding unschoolers around me too,  but I havn&#39;t posted anything yet either,  so that&#39;s my next step.<br/>
<br/>
Just relax your worries,   start each day with peace and enjoy it.    You will love your new life and your kids will amaze you each day!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<br/>
You might want to see if your library has Franks Smith&#39;s book titled The<br/>
Book of Learning and Forgetting.  Mary Griffith&#39;s book, The Unschooling<br/>
Handbook is also excellent.<br/>
<br/>
A new homeschooling book, The Fundamentals of Homeschooling, by Ann<br/>
Lahrson-Fisher, is also very supportive of unschooling ideas without<br/>
being &quot;all about unschooling&quot;.  Anything by Linda Dobson is also good,<br/>
and unschooling-friendly.<br/>
<br/>
A much cheaper and more thorough approach, if you have time, is to read<br/>
the message boards at unschooling.com.  They are searchable by topic.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;curriculum isn&#39;t working&quot; and putting it away is a starting<br/>
point for unschooling, but it&#39;s far from the whole idea.  I believe that<br/>
to be successful unschooling and to minimize worrying parents need to<br/>
get past a lot of the myths about education that are big in our culture.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; My son is only 3, but I taught him the majority<br/>
of stuff he knows online at safe kid sites and through books and<br/>
television.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you think of it as his learning instead of your teaching?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We had to teach him the alphabet and phonics through<br/>
singing and reading so he could talk&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How would knowing phonics and the alphabet help anyone speak?  They only have <br/>
to do with reading.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I set no specific time for it and when he gets tired of what we are doing <br/>
he gets breaks<br/>
until he is ready for more.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can he take his own break, or does it have to be given to him by parents?<br/>
Ready for more... being taught?  Ready to be taught again?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425736281">I have been listening and reading this list for sometime. There have been<br/>
some wonderful stories about kids having *ah-ha* moments. I usually wonder<br/>
to myself if my kids have ever had one of those. Well today I witnessed one.<br/>
A neighbor was having a room added onto their house. A week ago I asked the<br/>
construction dudes if we could have any scrap lumber. The kids love to<br/>
*make* things. So they have been dropping off pieces here and there. Today<br/>
my 7 year old took two long pieces and nailed them together in a *t* shape.<br/>
But was frowning because she wanted the top piece to be like an arm that<br/>
swung around (to take the beanie babies for a ride at the amusement park)<br/>
but it just drug on the ground. So to fix the problem she took two small<br/>
blocks and lifted the whole *t* up and put it on the blocks. But then told<br/>
me she forgot about the weight of the beanies and wasn&#39;t sure still if it<br/>
would work. She was right, the beanies weighed it down. Finally she asked me<br/>
to take the nail out of the middle of the *t*, she then put a small block<br/>
between the bottom and top piece, nailed it together and swung those beanies<br/>
happily for at least an hour.  I was so surprised at her and it just made me<br/>
laugh.<br/>
Thanks for letting me share!<br/>
