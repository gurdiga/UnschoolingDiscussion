<div id="ygrps-yiv-582120067">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in need of some unschooling support/advice.  My oldest (11) is taking a grade 8 math course so that he&#39;ll be able to take some course he wants to take.  He agreed to this!  He wanted this!<br/>
<br/>
But...now the course is incredibly boring!  He has a very good &quot;math sense&quot; so even if it&#39;s stuff he doesn&#39;t know he &quot;gets&quot; it right away.  So now he doesn&#39;t want to do the course.  I&#39;ve reminded him that there&#39;s a reason he has to get it done (to take the course he does like).  So he says in true 11 year old fashion &quot;FINE, I don&#39;t want the other courses!&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the problem...I know he does.  How much push should I give him?  If he quits, he&#39;ll regrett it later.  I&#39;ve tried explaining to him that sometimes you need to play the game.  Which I hate, but it&#39;s true.  In my own career I have to &quot;play the game&quot; to succeed, because I don&#39;t have a degree.  <br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is all coming out wrong and going to sound very un-unschoolish :), but still some words of wisdom perhaps?<br/>

&lt;&lt; If he quits, he&#39;ll regrett it later.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he stays, he&#39;ll regret it now.  And it might turn him against ever wanting <br/>
whatever the next course up is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He agreed to this!  He wanted this!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He agreed without knowing what it would be like.   You can&#39;t hold an eleven <br/>
year old to something he had never experienced before.  <br/>
<br/>
Would you hold yourself to finish a course you really hated?<br/>
<br/>
If he has good math sense and understands the concepts, would the second <br/>
course let him test in by showing he understands the prerequisite concepts?<br/>
<br/>
If the second course is likewise boring, will he want to drop that one?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious about what course could be so wonderful that you want to press <br/>
boredom, but so useful that he can&#39;t find the information elsewhere and learn <br/>
it quickly as he&#39;s learning the math in this course.<br/>
<br/>
There are websites and videos and CDRom games for all kinds of math.  What&#39;s <br/>
the second course?  Maybe people here can give you resources for him to <br/>
explore that information on his own.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know this problem very well. It takes a TON of maturity to do something <br/>
unpleasant now, especially something that drags on a while, just to get the <br/>
chance to do something else that we want to do later.<br/>
<br/>
Here is one idea for you to chew on. Let it go knowing he&#39;ll learn something <br/>
from the process anyway. It isn&#39;t the end of the world if he gives up and <br/>
doesn&#39;t do the math course and, therefore, doesn&#39;t get to do the other thing <br/>
and regrets it later. He&#39;ll learn from that, too, about how NOT perservering <br/>
has consequences. Understanding that,  he&#39;ll eventually be able to cope with <br/>
having to &quot;play the game&quot; if it is necessary and he wants something enough.<br/>
<br/>
Also - another good skill is to figure out another way to &quot;play the game.&quot; Is <br/>
there really no other way to get what he wants? Try brainstorming, together, <br/>
all the possible ways - include even the most farfetched silly unlikely <br/>
ideas. Then look at them and see if any can be turned into something that <br/>
might be actually workable. Thinking outside the box is hard - we often <br/>
reject ideas that seem outlandish - but are really doable if we just have <br/>
enough willingness to try something different.<br/>
<br/>
We could do some brainstorming here, too, if you tell us what it is he wants <br/>
to do and why the math course is required.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465312489">Have you considered challenging the course?  Some schools let you do<br/>
this.  They give you a test and if you pass it by a certain percentage,<br/>
they pass you on to the next course.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960100865">Does he actually &quot;have&quot; to take the coarse or can you talk to the instructor<br/>
of the other coarse and ask if the prerequisite if taking the class or<br/>
having the knowledge the class provides.<br/>
<br/>
In college you can challenge the coarse and show you have the knowledge,<br/>
perhaps this would work for your son.<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>

Is this correspondance or an actual classroom thing?  What is the exact <br/>
requirement for the course he wants to take?  Would they accept his just <br/>
writing the final test?  Maybe he could just study the stuff on his own and <br/>
write each chapter test.<br/>

to do this?  That would make a difference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d probably have to &quot;play the game&quot; even if you had a degree.  The <br/>
question is, does he want it badly enough to play the game?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412268796">Thanks guys!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really hard to reply to digests, because I can&#39;t pick and choose easily what to copy.<br/>
<br/>
So anyways....the advice was just what the doctor ordered!  I realized almost instantly that I have the problem not my son.  The reasons for him taking the course at all are not as important as learning what he wants.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, just to go against me I&#39;m sure LOL, he went ahead and worked on his math this morning and said &quot;gee that was easy, I should just do this every morning!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m leaving it in his hands (I hope I can keep my mouth shut).  Yes there are otherways for him to do it, but at this point in time he wants the easiest and fastest and this is it.  Same for the course he actually wants (computer programming and 3d stuff).  I know there&#39;s lots of places to get it as does he, but he wants a course so he can just do what he&#39;s told for a while (it&#39;s correspondence)  I think that&#39;s a fair want.  Sometimes I like courses that just &quot;tell me what to do&quot; also.  It gives my brain a rest! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again...I&#39;m trying to stick to the path.  I know what&#39;s right, but have a heck of a lot of old tapes playing!<br/>
