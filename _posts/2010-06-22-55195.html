&quot;what I can say in your defense is that, in the real world working for someone else, most of the time that is the only reason a boss will give you when he tells you to do something. Or, if working for yourself, it is the only thing a client will give you for a reason. You suck it up to earn a living.

Now, I&#39;ve thought about and think I have some great rebuttals, but was wondering if we could discuss &quot;because I said so&quot; a little here before I respond on FB.<br/>

<br/>
And that&#39;s why there are employees who cheat their bosses royally. Seriously, employees who understand *why* the rules and proceedures are what they are are better employees, more likely to make good decisions, more likely to support the structure even when they don&#39;t agree with everything 100%. Its employees who are stuck with only ideas or comply or resist that damage companies, big and small. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to accept rules or even laws *just* because they are there. I want them to think about reasons and think about whether they agree or disagree. If they disagree with the reasons, I want them to know they have more options than rebellion or sneakiness. Not all rules and laws are good, after all!<br/>

<br/>
My first thought is that if an adult is in the working world and someone says &quot;because I said so...&quot;, then your reason for just doing it, is pretty clear, you want to get a paycheck and keep your job or your client.  Even with paying taxes, you do it because it&#39;s the law.  You have a reason and a choice with consequences.<br/>
<br/>
When a parent says that to a child, there is an assumption that there is no choice in the matter.  To me, that&#39;s a big difference!<br/>

That&#39;s from the time I was 14 and working at a summer camp, then a pizza parlor, a golf course, retail, and property management.  I have never had a boss say or imply &quot;because I said so.&quot;  I am just sitting here scratching my head.  Now maybe the *way* they want some things done is not always the *way* I would do it and I do it that way because they said so.  But I still always understood why this particular aspect of the job needed to be done.  Even if I didn&#39;t agree it was best, there was some understanding of where they were coming from and that there was some semblance of logic and a reason behind it.  <br/>
<br/>
I can say having been a manager at several of those jobs that any decent employer WANTS his employees to know why they are doing what they are doing because it creates a team environment, gives the employee more ownership in her job, she might come up with a better idea, she&#39;ll probably stick around longer, decreases resentment, and so many other things.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the government telling us what to do &quot;just because&quot; that is just scary that anyone would think that is ok!  WE are supposed to run the government, not the other way around.  The people working for the government are hired SERVANTS of the people.  We tell them what to do, so if anyone should be saying &quot;because I said so&quot; it&#39;s the people TO the government.  If someone doesn&#39;t understand why a law is in place, they should go research it and find out why it was passed.  Then if they don&#39;t agree with it, make efforts to change it.  Not just sit there and say &quot;well I was told to do it so I guess I have to.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to be kind to my friends and family members who don&#39;t get <br/>
unschooling, and never will, by NOT saying things on facebook that will <br/>
really offend them or get them arguing with me. Only a couple of times <br/>
have I risked it and only once has one of my sisters responded to <br/>
something - it was an anti-school thing I posted and she&#39;s an elementary <br/>
school teacher with several different teaching credentials. She posted <br/>
&quot;yawn.&quot;  I left it without responding and, thank you, none of my friends <br/>
responded, either. I have no idea what it meant, but she and I just <br/>
spent the last 3 hours having coffee together and just hanging out and <br/>
I&#39;m really glad we can ignore our sometimes-glaring differences of <br/>
opinion about schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Maturity is NOT feeling a need to convince others around us that we&#39;re <br/>
right. I know unschooling is awesome - it doesn&#39;t really matter what <br/>
anybody else thinks, I don&#39;t need to argue with them, I can let them <br/>
just keep thinking whatever they think as LONG as they treat my kids <br/>
well. And my sisters are super super nice and sweet to my kids - they <br/>
obviously love them like crazy.<br/>
<br/>
It is very possible to have a good and sweet relationship with someone <br/>
who doesn&#39;t get unschoolingat all. I overlook the kind of conventional <br/>
comments my extended family might occasionally make about kids. I <br/>
overlook that they are pretty convinced that what messes kids up is a <br/>
lack of rules and boundaries and limits. They mean well and they don&#39;t <br/>
try to impose anything on my kids. They may believe in consistent rules <br/>
and all that, they may impose chores and have regular fusses with their <br/>
own kids over them, but how does that keep us from playing games <br/>
together and talking about books we&#39;ve read and going to a movie or <br/>
bowling?<br/>
<br/>
Things could have been different in my family. I could have been prickly <br/>
and insisted that they acknowledge that unschooling is wonderful. I <br/>
could have alienated my sisters. I could STILL do that if I responded <br/>
when they say things like, &quot;Kids need limits.&quot; But, it isn&#39;t my job to <br/>
tell them how to parent. I don&#39;t let them tell me, either - if they ever <br/>
said anything about it I&#39;d just smile and say, &quot;Hey, you know how I am, <br/>
I always do things differently.&quot; They&#39;d smile and agree.<br/>
<br/>
I love to talk about unschooling - but only to those with a sincere <br/>
interest. One of my sisters is somewhat interested, the other not at <br/>
all. So - I let their interest be my guide. If they seem interested, I <br/>
give them a bit of info, but if they wanted to just argue, I&#39;d say, &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t want to argue - let&#39;s just not talk about it.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My boss, the dean of my college dvision, told me to do something. I <br/>
questioned it. She said, more or less, &quot;Do it because I said so.&quot; I <br/>
said, &quot;I see problems with it.&quot; She said, &quot;It is how I want it.&quot; I said, <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not willing to do it that way.&quot; So - we were at a seeming impasse <br/>
(and, no, I don&#39;t have tenure). Then I said, &quot;Here is what would make it <br/>
doable for me,&quot; and I told her a modified version of what she wanted, <br/>
that I was okay with. She agreed. It has worked that way for the past <br/>
three years and we&#39;re both happy.  She&#39;s not used to being questioned by <br/>
adjunct faculty, but I&#39;m not used to being ordered around without being <br/>
given explanations, either. She could have done a lot better. I don&#39;t go <br/>
to her for any help or information or for any reason  if I can possibly <br/>
help it because I don&#39;t trust her not to make arbitrary decisions and <br/>
give orders.<br/>
<br/>
So - yeah - if you want your kids to avoid you, just give them orders to <br/>
&quot;Do it because I say so.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680223594">The problem I have is less about the phrase &quot;I said so&quot; itself, than with the concept that somehow in my relationship with my sons, I should attempt to emulate an employer. Why would I want to have a boss-like relationship with my boys? I&#39;m their mom. Treating them like a controlling boss might treat them won&#39;t help our relationship thrive - it would only serve to alienate them. How would that help their learning? How would that help develop trust?<br/>
<br/>
People often give &quot;It&#39;s a rough world out there, best prepare them for it&quot; as an excuse to treat their kids terribly. I decided long ago that if, indeed, the world was such a terrible place, I&#39;d rather provide a gentle loving respite from it, a kind nest to escape to, than make a replica of it.<br/>
<br/>
In doing so, I found that the BEST defense against a rough world is a strong sense of SELF and self-worth, backed up by loving support. A kid won&#39;t develop that sense of self, knowing and valuing themselves, if they hear &quot;because I said so&quot; too many times. That kind of phrase shuts kids down, and creates disconnection - from their own selves, and from parents. Who wants that?<br/>
<br/>
And whaddaya know? The world is actually pretty cool where we are. It&#39;s not populated by the bullies school proponents believe kids must prepare for, nor is it filled with people who say, &quot;Because I said so.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965320238">***most of the time that is the only reason a boss will give you when he tells you to do something.***<br/>
<br/>
Adults can quit a boss who is an asshole.   Kid&#39;s don&#39;t have the option to quit parents.  Unless you count running away or suicide. <br/>
<br/>
If a person doesn&#39;t have any idea why his boss is asking him to do something, maybe he doesn&#39;t understand his job very well.   I&#39;m forty seven.  I&#39;ve worked for lots of different people.  No one ever said, &quot;Because I said so.&quot;     <br/>
<br/>
If the boss is just some power trippy nut, then at any time an employee can decide the job isn&#39;t worth feeding the bosses power trip.    Adults have choices kids don&#39;t have.  <br/>
<br/>
If a mom or dad thinks a thing is important then there must be a  reason it&#39;s important    Why not share the reason?    &quot;Because I said so&quot; is what parents use when there is no real justification for the thing they&#39;re telling their kid to do, or, used because the parents have little consideration for the feelings or intelligence of the kid.  <br/>

<br/>
Pam, your post really made me question why I felt the need to respond. <br/>
<br/>
My dad rarely gives advice. Most of the time he&#39;s just encouraging of the things he finds positive. You&#39;ll notice he even started his comment with &quot;in your defense&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
He and his wife are coming to visit next week and it will be the first time we&#39;ve seen them in over 3 years. While my dad generally keeps his thoughts to himself, his wife loves to comment on everything we do. For example, the last time they were here she spent most of the time critiquing our diet. We&#39;re mostly vegetarians that eat fish and eggs occasionally and she is a vegan. She went on and on about how bad fish is for you (mercury poisoning and all) and how we should really be more conscious about having the kids eat more protein (when my girls chose to eat the salad bar when we went out to eat and didn&#39;t put any beans on their plate).<br/>
<br/>
While I talk to my dad 3 or 4 times a week, I haven&#39;t discussed unschooling at all with my dad and I don&#39;t ever talk to his wife unless she happens to answer the phone. He does have access to my 13 year old&#39;s blog, however, and she discusses unschooling in many of her posts, so he may know that we&#39;re unschooling, but I&#39;m not sure how much he knows about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The last time we saw them, we had not started unschooling, and my dad&#39;s wife was an elementary school teacher for a long time. The last time we saw my husband&#39;s aunt, a high school English teacher, she had pulled my girls to the side when I was engaged in a conversation with someone else and asked them a bunch of questions about what they were doing. We were traditional homeschoolers at the time and she was very positive about what we were doing with the girls, but I&#39;m not so sure she would have been quite so positive had we been unschoolers at the time. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still in our infancy stage of unschooling and, while I&#39;ll be fine with anything she says to me, I&#39;m not sure how our girls will handle any questioning by my step-mother. <br/>

It might also be good to let the kids know that grandma doesn&#39;t have any business asking about their &quot;education&quot; and if they&#39;re uncomforable they can just refer her to you and not answer, or insist that its &quot;not time for school right now&quot; and not answer. <br/>

that is because she is an extreme conflict-avoider - she&#39;ll usually do <br/>
almost anything to avoid conflict. It would just be completely out of <br/>
character for her to comment in a way that was intended to be critical <br/>
at all, much less hostile. She runs a program at an elemenary school, <br/>
but it is for 3 and 4 year olds who have severe physical disabilities - <br/>
like she has a child in her class who has no arms or legs. So she&#39;s not <br/>
a regular classroom teacher. She tells stories about things that happen <br/>
in her school that she strongly disagrees with and dislikes - she&#39;s all <br/>
about kids learning through free play, for example, at least for young <br/>
children. She hasn&#39;t got the idea of how that same philosophy applies to <br/>
older kids and adults and she&#39;s been the sole breadwinner in her family <br/>
for years, so I think she just never thought much about it - she focused <br/>
on getting her kids into a little private school that she was happy with.<br/>
<br/>
Some relationships are worth preserving even though we don&#39;t agree about <br/>
child-rearing practices because the kids will grow up and we still have <br/>
our relationship. Turns out our KIDS are super close to each other too - <br/>
in spite of having been raised in very very different ways. I know my <br/>
niece has felt some anger that she was misled into thinking that she had <br/>
to work so hard in high school to be successful in college - since now <br/>
she&#39;s seen that her cousins, who didn&#39;t even go to high school, have <br/>
been just as successful in college. I don&#39;t think she really gets what <br/>
we did (or didn&#39;t do - schooling). It isn&#39;t really conceivable to her.<br/>
<br/>
Schooling or not schooling isn&#39;t the center of my kids&#39; lives - and less <br/>
and less significant in my life. My sister and I have sort of just set <br/>
that aside and we relate in a zillion other ways. Now that my kids are <br/>
grown, hers almost  - what is there really to say?<br/>
<br/>
She has asked me for advice, very rarely. My advice is always - let it <br/>
go. She asks when her inclination is to loosen up, but she needs some <br/>
justification - all her teacher friends would probably be telling her to <br/>
tighten up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400019781">I&#39;m not my child&#39;s boss.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like my child to enjoy dialogue with me rather than &#39;get used to&#39; me<br/>
slamming conversation shut.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand that explanations can be complex in some situations, but I<br/>
would try to request for trust till I could talk about things rather than an<br/>
order.<br/>
<br/>
I have experienced many &#39;because I say so&#39;s in life and the only common<br/>
factor they have had is that I have experienced each one as distancing and<br/>
disrespectful of my involvement. I have avoided the persons saying this to<br/>
me to the best of my capacity. As a child I tuned them out. As a teenager I<br/>
rebelled to the extent of causing a lot of risks to my well being. As I<br/>
grew, I learned to initiate conversation among them, but the &#39;because I said<br/>
so&#39;s didn&#39;t teach me that. I learned from a few wonderful people who were<br/>
able to gently ask &#39;why&#39; or &#39;what is the value you see&#39; in response to them.<br/>
<br/>
I think those &#39;because I said so&#39;s in my teenage environment in particular<br/>
have left me with a deep mistrust of people&#39;s intentions by default and<br/>
caused damage to many relationships because my automatic responses when the<br/>
&#39;whole picture&#39; was not shared were defensive. I assumed that they were not<br/>
interested in my involvement and simply wanted me to act as they desired.<br/>
Sometimes, my hostility caused damage, when the other had not shared their<br/>
thinking but had no issue to sharing it if I was interested. It causes<br/>
trouble in my relationship with my husband, it makes me need to really<br/>
examine my responses when dealing with authority figures, because I can<br/>
often unknowingly be distancing in anticipation of that distancing of me.<br/>
While I have no way of knowing if things would be different if I had<br/>
experienced respect and involvement with my family, I remember longing to be<br/>
a part of the deciding rather than having to go along with whatever was<br/>
decided &#39;because people said so&#39; and &#39;for my good&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
My parents still see nothing wrong with such attitudes and have no clue why<br/>
I ask them to respect my son. To them, he suddenly becomes capable of making<br/>
decisions at legal maturity, like I did. They forget that my first big<br/>
decision was to move out of their house as a young, beautiful, broke girl<br/>
with no knowledge of how to make good choices because I couldn&#39;t have the<br/>
opportunity till I literally had to swim out with the sharks to grab it.<br/>
