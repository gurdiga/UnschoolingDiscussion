<br/>
Thank you for you input, it was very informative!  I know that ritalin made a <br/>
HUGE difference in my younger sons life (currently 18).  His older brother <br/>
took ritalin for maybe six months or less and we stopped because he was <br/>
having problems being excused from class to take it (before the long acting <br/>
one came out) so he stopped. He later had a drug problem, not heroin or <br/>
cocaine, but after intensive rehab they told us he was self medicating.  Is <br/>
that a cop out?  Who knows, but I hear lots of people who agree with it, lots <br/>
who disagree too.<br/>
<br/>
Only my experiences... the one who has taken ritalin for five or six years is <br/>
not the one with the drug problem in my family, it&#39;s the one who found it too <br/>
complicated to work a daily medication into his schedule, but drugs fit?  Go <br/>
figure!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, there are LOTS of choices, one being doing nothing and letting your child <br/>
feel frustrated and trapped and less than, that is probably even worse than a <br/>
medication would do to a child.  Hard to overcome those feelings in life but <br/>
medication can be discontinued fairly easily.<br/>
<br/>
I know I waited a long time for &quot;proof&quot; that my son needed medication in <br/>
order to fully be himself.  The only proof is AFTER the medication, in my <br/>
experience anyway.  No one could have made me understand the difference it <br/>
would make in my son.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, I want to add that he was in no way a behaviour problem.  His problems <br/>
were with himself and his ability to do the things he wanted to do and trying <br/>
to deal with his frustrations and his inability to process and concentrate.<br/>
<br/>
We tried LOTS of things trying to avoid the &quot;medication trap&quot;, none worked <br/>
for him.  I guess it&#39;s like the doctor told me you wouldn&#39;t deprive him of <br/>
insulin if he were diabetic or anti depressants if he were maniac depressive <br/>
so why is this different?  He then said, if it doesn&#39;t work for him, then we <br/>
stop it, end of story and look for another way to help him.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t get is the multitude of children who are placed on ritalin or <br/>
similar drugs because they can&#39;t sit still?  I guess in that sense it would <br/>
be hard to tell the difference between a normal child with abundant energy <br/>
and one who was compensating for not being able to fully concentrate.<br/>
<br/>
It might have been even a harder decision for me if John had also manifested <br/>
ADD with a hyper activity component.  I would have wondered if they were <br/>
really suggesting he was just too active or if John really just had other <br/>
things he wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
Guess I was lucky in that John really is the one who was clear in what he was <br/>
experiencing and he was LOOKING for some help of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I&#39;m just grateful that it worked for him and there are none of the side <br/>
affects I&#39;ve read about.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I hope I didn&#39;t start too much of a sidetrack with this, but I think <br/>
it applies to both worlds.  Your unschooling ADD child may discover <br/>
different paths of learning that work for him/her, and that&#39;s <br/>
terrific!  But for those unschooling kids who *want* to be able to <br/>
________ (fill in the blank: program computers, take ballet lessons, <br/>
read for hours at a time) and *can&#39;t* because of a lack of <br/>
concentration, maybe this is one option.  It&#39;s certainly not the <br/>
only option, but it may be the one that allows your child to <br/>
function as best fits his/her interests and needs.<br/>
<br/>
I think one has to get beyond the mindset that ADD is all a matter <br/>
of environment: if it&#39;s not, then a child with ADD may not be able <br/>
to explore the world much better at home, then they would at <br/>
school.  The question then becomes, what do parents and children do?<br/>
<br/>
... okay, I&#39;ll stop now. :)<br/>

Kids who don&#39;t hear every day that there is something wrong with them<br/>
don&#39;t believe they need to be fixed.<br/>
  <br/>
I know kids on ritalin who have been brainwashed into believing there is<br/>
something wrong with them and brainwashed into believing if they could<br/>
only act the *right* way, everything would be fine.<br/>
<br/>
I knew a woman SPANKED her little boys for touching their OWN penises and<br/>
told them so frequently they&#39;d go to hell if they had dirty thoughts, she<br/>
had them brainwashed into coming to her if they accidentally touched<br/>
themselves or saw a picture or word that was *bad* and asking PLEASE<br/>
spank me mommy so I don&#39;t go to hell.   <br/>
<br/>
Just because you&#39;ve convinced a kid he&#39;s flawed doesn&#39;t make it so.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a broad range of NORMAL human behaviors that don&#39;t fit the neat<br/>
little school package of &quot;agreeable, still and quiet&quot;.     <br/>

matter where it took place.  Learning to play video games, learning to see <br/>
the beauty in a bird that nested outside his window, learning, learning, <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, he was in school when he started medication, but I can tell you that at <br/>
age 12/13 his biggest priority was NOT what went on in the classroom.  His <br/>
grades were not the issue, with us anyway.  We didn&#39;t even look at report <br/>
cards after elementary school, basically we found them useless.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to go investigate NASA, we went to the Space Center in FL.  He got <br/>
wonderful VIP tours, he felt frustrated that he couldn&#39;t concentrate fully to <br/>
absorb all he wanted to.  There are many other instances of things/events <br/>
that were directed by him that left him completely frustrated and feeling <br/>
less than in his own eyes.<br/>
<br/>
I recognize that in some instances children are medicated to fit the PS <br/>
standards or molds to make things easier for them in the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
In my son&#39;s case, even the homeschooling adventures were frustrating for him, <br/>
not for anyone else trying to make him fit a mold or pattern or live up or <br/>
down to any set standards of learning but to his own self.<br/>
<br/>
So in this particular situation it has to do with children and difficulties <br/>
learning/doing ANYTHING they want to absorb and that there was/is a remedy <br/>
that works miracles for some people anyway.<br/>

I wonder what a child with these traits would be like as a teen if <br/>
they were always allowed to learn and do at their own pace. If they <br/>
were never exposed to the concept of there being one right way to pay <br/>
attention or gather information. Maybe their brains would grow and <br/>
adapt to itself so that they wouldn&#39;t feel frustrated with their <br/>
inability to pay attention. They would have just learned a completely <br/>
different (from the norm) way of getting and retaining the info they <br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve seen some of this in my own kids. Just throwing an idea <br/>
out there for discussion.<br/>

<br/>
How were the tours presented? Did he get to structure the flow of <br/>
information in any way? Was it someone talking and him listening, or <br/>
did he get to poke around on his own, asking questions and seeking <br/>
information? <br/>
<br/>
I have definitely noticed that unschoolers don&#39;t always accept the <br/>
first way information is being presented as the only way. They can <br/>
actually be kind of annoying &lt;g&gt; in their quest to gather information <br/>
in the way they want and need it. They don&#39;t feel flawed, they feel <br/>
empowered.<br/>

&gt; you that at age 12/13 his biggest priority was NOT what went on in <br/>
&gt; the classroom.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wonder what a child with these traits would be like as a teen if <br/>
&gt; they were always allowed to learn and do at their own pace. If they <br/>
&gt; were never exposed to the concept of there being one right way to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>pay <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; attention or gather information. Maybe their brains would grow and <br/>
&gt; adapt to itself so that they wouldn&#39;t feel frustrated with their <br/>
&gt; inability to pay attention. They would have just learned a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>completely <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; different (from the norm) way of getting and retaining the info <br/>
 </span></blockquote>they <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know I&#39;ve seen some of this in my own kids. Just throwing an idea <br/>
&gt; out there for discussion.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;He wanted to go investigate NASA, we went to the Space Center in <br/>
&gt; FL.  He got wonderful VIP tours, he felt frustrated that he <br/>
 </span></blockquote>couldn&#39;t <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; concentrate fully to absorb all he wanted to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How were the tours presented? Did he get to structure the flow of <br/>
&gt; information in any way? Was it someone talking and him listening, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; did he get to poke around on his own, asking questions and seeking <br/>
&gt; information? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have definitely noticed that unschoolers don&#39;t always accept the <br/>
&gt; first way information is being presented as the only way. They can <br/>
&gt; actually be kind of annoying &lt;g&gt; in their quest to gather <br/>
 </span></blockquote>information <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in the way they want and need it. They don&#39;t feel flawed, they feel <br/>
&gt; empowered.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Life is good.<br/>
&gt; ~Mary<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;m not explaining the problem correctly.  It wasn&#39;t that he <br/>
had a problem learning a certain way.  He couldn&#39;t focus or <br/>
concentrate on anything as long as he would have liked to.  Making <br/>
EVERYTHING he wanted to do frustrating for him.<br/>
<br/>
Like the NASA thing, he was pretty much in control.  We had a NASA <br/>
astronaut that was showing him around, he got to touch, manipulate, <br/>
talk, ask, do basically whatever he wanted.  He was the one that was <br/>
greatly interested, so it was lead by him for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there were probably some places that were off limits but it <br/>
didn&#39;t seem like it, anything he asked about, he got to see and <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
After we left the first day (several day experience) he said he felt <br/>
like he really wasn&#39;t able to &quot;get&quot; what he wanted to from the <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
Just like he would choose a book he really wanted to read.  He just <br/>
couldn&#39;t concentrate long enough to read it.  Book on tape?  Great <br/>
for some people, not for him, to him after only a few minutes it <br/>
sounded like a forgein language.<br/>
<br/>
So for him there really wasn&#39;t another way around this.  We tried <br/>
LOTS of things.  Books on tape being one, me reading to him another, <br/>
both his suggestions, both just didn&#39;t work for him.<br/>
<br/>
HE wanted something to change, he made adjustments, we made <br/>
adjustments, we tried every remedy we were suggested.  Finally after <br/>
more than a year, we tried the ritalin, I was scared.  I had heard <br/>
many horror stories, kids crushing it and sniffing it for one.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I agreed to TRY the ritalin.  I had no expectations of it <br/>
really working.  The only kids I had personally known on the drug <br/>
were VERY hyper, very high strung and it seemed their mothers gave it <br/>
to them like candy almost.  Oh, come here and get your <br/>
ritalin.  &quot;Little Jimmie, you can&#39;t sit still today, get me your <br/>
ritalin right NOW!&quot;.  Those types of things.<br/>
<br/>
John was NOT like that in any sense.  A very quiet kid, a thoughtful <br/>
always seeming in deep thought kind of child.  What could this drug <br/>
possibly do to help him?<br/>
<br/>
LOTS, for him anyway.  I&#39;m not saying that this is the path for <br/>
anyone&#39;s child but for mine it was right.  I feel badly that I made <br/>
him wait so long for something that so obviously worked wonders for <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
He likes putting together model cars and airplanes, he NEVER finished <br/>
even one until he started medication.  He NEVER had mastered a video <br/>
game until he started medication.  He had never sat through a movie <br/>
at the theater before medication.  So many things that once sounded <br/>
like wa wa wa wa after a few minutes are now such an enjoyable part <br/>
of his life.  Because of one tiny pill twice a day.<br/>
<br/>
He did find a way around his problem, a way to learn, a way to be <br/>
less frustrated, a way to cope and explore, for him his way was <br/>
ritalin.<br/>
<br/>
I still think it&#39;s over used, over prescribed and probably for many <br/>
wrong reasons but I&#39;m just saying there are some children who it <br/>
makes a difference in living in a dull colorless world and a bright <br/>
sunny vibrant one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-232065954">I&#39;ve been reading and re-reading as I often do and I felt I really wanted to <br/>
say that I am not suggesting that ANYONE go and put their child on ritalin.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to be clear that it has worked wonderfully for my son.<br/>
<br/>
I also wish someone had said to me a year earlier, go ahead and try it for a <br/>
month and if it doesn&#39;t work, just stop taking it.  Would have probably saved <br/>
a LOT of frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not trying to steer anyone to the ritalin but if you were <br/>
considering it and wondering, for SOME people it does work.<br/>
