It really is possible to show a statistical relationship between two  <br/>
random concepts. :&gt;)<br/>

The article my husband just sent me is this:<br/>
<br/>
Breakfast link to unwanted pregnancies, Japanese research<br/>
<br/>
The Daily Telegraph<br/>
December 29, 2008 12:00am<br/>
&quot;TEENS who skip breakfast tend to have sex at an earlier age than  <br/>
those who start the day with a proper meal, a government-backed  <br/>
Japanese medical researcher said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The link between breakfast and sex probably lies in the teens&#39;  <br/>
family life, Kunio Kitamura, executive director of the Japan Family  <br/>
Planning Association, who conducted the survey, told Reuters news  <br/>
agency.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The survey examined sexual experiences as well as family  <br/>
relationships and lifestyle habits of Japanese females and males aged  <br/>
16 to 49. It was carried out in September and was based on about  <br/>
1,500 people.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The average age of first-time sex for those who said they ate  <br/>
breakfast every day as a middle school student was 19.4, while for  <br/>
those who skipped breakfast, the average age was 17.5. ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and it continues and one of the best parts is this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People who said they disliked their mother had sex for the first  <br/>
time at the average age of 16, while the average age for those who  <br/>
appreciated their mother was 19, Kitamura said.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s partly a statistical lark (and the site has it under  <br/>
&quot;entertainment,&quot; but I think it does say something about parenting  <br/>
that&#39;s important to unschoolers!<br/>
