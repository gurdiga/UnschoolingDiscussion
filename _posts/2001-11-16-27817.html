<div id="ygrps-yiv-669928707">Please read the entire post and then reply to content as written, not what<br/>
you choose to read into it.  This wasn&#39;t a post about &quot;little Kirby&quot; or even<br/>
about fads or kewl.  It was an answer to a statement that karate had been<br/>
around for umpteen zillion years.<br/>
<br/>
Karate has been around forever.  It only became a &quot;fad&quot; after<br/>
television/movies made it &quot;kewl.&quot;  That does NOT say that karate IS a fad,<br/>
only that it &quot;viewed&quot; as a fad by certain elements in society.  Nor does it<br/>
say that &quot;little Kirby&quot; took up karate because it was a fad.  However, since<br/>
we do not live in a culture where karate is part of life, then exposure to<br/>
it usually comes from the fact that it has become a &quot;fad&quot; or &quot;in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Things can be fads without people doing them because they are fads.<br/>
<br/>
SUVs are fads, they are &quot;in,&quot; they are &quot;kewl.&quot;  I own an SUV but not because<br/>
of those reasons.  Do I care or get my bloomers in a bunch if folks think I<br/>
have one because they are &quot;in?&quot;  NOT!  I know why I own one and I am the<br/>
only one whose opinions counts on this.  Though, it would be kinda cutting<br/>
off my nose to spite my face if I got rid of it so that folks wouldn&#39;t think<br/>
I was following a &quot;fad.&quot;  I mean, it is kinda hard to pull a boat with a<br/>
nice little family car.<br/>
<br/>
I had a big 4x4 pickup before movies made them &quot;in.&quot;  I wore Tony Lamas<br/>
before movies made them &quot;in.&quot;  I don&#39;t worry about &quot;keeping up with the<br/>
Jones&quot; NOR do I worry about what other folks think about what we are doing<br/>
and I guess I can&#39;t understand why others do.<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, I guess I&#39;m having a blonde moment here &lt;g&gt;  If you&#39;re<br/>
going to teach them &quot;kewl&quot; sucks, why would you teach them to do things so<br/>
they &quot;will then be kewl.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ah, Karate has been around but it wasn&#39;t a &quot;fad&quot; until the U.S. decided<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Should I teach my kids that kewl sucks?<br/>
&gt; To only choose things that are not mainstream so they themselves will then<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; kewl?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kirby&#39;s been at this karate school, which was chosen after calling and<br/>
&gt; researching the parent schools to find one that was more involved with<br/>
&gt; philosophy and culture and health than with tournaments (they do none) and<br/>
&gt; quick advancement.  He started at nine (somewhat late for that school) and<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; still there at 15.  The two teens who outranked him have left for<br/>
&gt; extracurricular school stuff now, and he&#39;s the ranking kid.  The school<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t allow black belts before the age of 18, but he cares nothing for<br/>
&gt; that, because a large part of their training is personal best and team<br/>
&gt; effort, respect for the tradition, and not advancement or glory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those who know about such things, it&#39;s Shorin-Ryu, and Ed Erler is the<br/>
&gt; Sensei.  Kirby has participated in some of the regional seminars they<br/>
sponsor<br/>
&gt; with visiting teachers.  In those he&#39;s usually been the youngest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He went because he wants to.  He stays because he wants to.  How faddish<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126310037">Karate hasn&#39;t been around forever.  The style Kirby is learning has a <br/>
specific origin in Okinawa after they were forbidden to have weapons and <br/>
learned to use oars and crank handles and such as weapons.  Forbidden to have <br/>
swords and knives, they continued training with alternate &quot;tools.&quot;    It <br/>
parallels Scottish mouth music, in a tradition-building way.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-!  I know why I own one and I am the<br/>
only one whose opinions counts on this.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t affect what others think of why you have it, and that probably <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter, but opinions are a reality too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt;  If you&#39;re going to teach them &quot;kewl&quot; sucks, why would you teach them to <br/>
do things so they &quot;will then be kewl.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do either one.<br/>
It was commentary about how some people consider it cool to do what is not <br/>
cool.<br/>
It was sarcasm, in part, and the full circule of the &quot;kewl&quot; comment in larger <br/>
part.<br/>
