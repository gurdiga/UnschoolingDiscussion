<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294350868">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m new to the group and am coming in the middle of this discussion but we use<br/>
the anno&#39;s books.  it&#39;s kind of a series that is more about a way of thinking<br/>
mathematically than actual rote stuff.  the books are recommended for ages 4 to 8<br/>
and have really great drawings.   our son (whose 4) loves them so much we spend<br/>
an hour or so before bed (certainly not every night) doing math and he now says<br/>
&#39;lets play math&#39;.  i think if one could think mathematically then all the other<br/>
stuff will fall into place much like reading.  what i try to do is keep the<br/>
desire alive and for math this series works for rene&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
also if anyone uses this series i would love to talk about it.  i have a very<br/>
weak grasp of math (i&#39;ve learned a lot from the anno&#39;s book as well) and am<br/>
reading a number of different books on the subject of mathematical thinking.<br/>
i&#39;ve also found a web site naturalmath.com which we are considering using (they<br/>
have an online program).<br/>

<br/>
&gt;OR do I agree with my friend, who, if she had to do it over again with her<br/>
&gt;unschooled son, said she would definitely have unschooled everything EXCEPT<br/>
&gt;math because it&#39;s something you need constant reiteration on for basic facts,<br/>
&gt;and there are many advanced principles (geometry, fractions, algebra, etc.)<br/>
&gt;that need &quot;book time,&quot; where you sit down and teach them math just about once<br/>
&gt;every day....?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a whiz at basic math calculations. I know my multiplication tables<br/>
really well and I can quickly and efficiently add and subtract even large<br/>
numbers in my head. I loathe and fear higher math, and have since I flunked<br/>
Algebra. I have spent my life in three main careers -- dog trainer (not a<br/>
lot of advanced math required), bookseller (ditto) and... accountant. I was<br/>
a fine accountant. :) Worked my way up from Accounts Payable clerk to Cost<br/>
Accountant and never had to think about &quot;higher math&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Now, take my husband (please! Da da dum! &lt;g&gt;). He can do no basic math<br/>
calculations in his head. He does not know his multiplication tables. He<br/>
uses a calculator to add 10 + 12, okay? But he&#39;s *really* good at advanced<br/>
math. He plays math games with his father (computer programmer) and they<br/>
think up math puzzles to challenge each other that make my teeth fall asleep<br/>
(the last one involved the calculation of the diameter of a roll of toilet<br/>
paper given some incredibly obscure variables that I can&#39;t even remember,<br/>
much less calculate). My husband is a Chief Estimator for a multi-million<br/>
dollar construction company and his JOB is to develop forumulas for<br/>
calculating such simple things as the cost of esoteric non-standard-sized<br/>
tiles and shelves in circular non-level rooms south of the Equator. <br/>
<br/>
10 + 12, however, still eludes him.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; constant reiteration for basic facts, math or otherwise. I<br/>
learned my basic math facts in the wink of an eye because I found them<br/>
useful and enjoyable. My husband, drilled like most of us for 12 full years,<br/>
still does not know them because he did *not* find them useful and<br/>
enjoyable. He uses his calculator for those and goes on to what he *does*<br/>
find useful and enjoyable. He also did not need &quot;book time&quot; to learn higher<br/>
math, just the interest to do so. Sure, many people who are interested in<br/>
higher math *do* sit down with books (Wally, though it is incomprehensible<br/>
to me &lt;g&gt;, wants to buy a bunch of math computer CDs and do the &quot;book<br/>
learning&quot; that he never did in school. He&#39;s 43. This woman&#39;s teenage son has<br/>
years yet.)<br/>
<br/>
Math gets a bad rap. So many of us buy into the &quot;it&#39;s hard&quot; or &quot;it has to be<br/>
repeated daily&quot; or &quot;it must be taught in certain steps&quot; that shaking free of<br/>
that can be a real feat.<br/>
<br/>
Math is no harder than training a dog.<br/>
Math is no more useful than knowing how to sew a straight seam.<br/>
Math does not require slavish, daily repetition to master basic concepts.<br/>
<br/>
The surest way to kill a child&#39;s (or adult&#39;s) interest in something is to<br/>
force it. Your friend obviously wishes her son were more interested in and<br/>
skilled in math, but if he&#39;s not, he&#39;s not, and there is nothing holding him<br/>
back but himself. He can sit down tomorrow with a stack of math books and<br/>
provided he has the real interest, he can learn it. He could have been<br/>
drilled at the kitchen table daily for 10 years and if he found it<br/>
mind-numbing and boring and not pertinent to his life, he&#39;d be like my<br/>
husband.<br/>
<br/>
We have until we die to learn 10 + 12, and if we die and we still haven&#39;t<br/>
learned it, obviously we didn&#39;t need it after all. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966084742">I think that what you are talking about is calculation--which is a small part <br/>
of math.<br/>
We all use math constantly--when we cook, go to the store, rearrange <br/>
furniture(proportion), select clothing (also proportion). Look at the centers <br/>
of flowers, and observe the patterns in nature.  Listen to music (the scale <br/>
is 8 notes). Put together puzzles. Make tessalations..... We are surrounded <br/>
by mathmatical thinking--where we tend to get stuck is arithmetic IMO<br/>

Thanks for this.  This is one of the best posts and best stories I&#39;ve heard <br/>
shared about the math anxiety question that always comes up on unschooling <br/>
lists (and in my mind, too!)<br/>
I&#39;m printing it out to read at those shaky times!<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

Same here.  It&#39;s wonderful.  Great examples of learning differences.  I hope<br/>
you don&#39;t mind but I&#39;m keeping this to give to others when they question me<br/>

I had never thought about this like you put it. I too caught on to all basic <br/>
math functions very easy. With just a bit of refresher I can still do <br/>
anything with fractions and decimals too. Measurement is no problem, I have <br/>
my math facts down pat. I loved arithmetic right off. Reading never gave me a <br/>
problem either but....I have an advanced math phobia. I could probably do it <br/>
if I had to, however since I&#39;ve never needed it for anything other than <br/>
helping with homework I haven&#39;t bothered. I have been able to get by having <br/>
an older child help out. <br/>
    It does bug me though that I don&#39;t know calculus, etc. Maybe someday I&#39;ll <br/>
try.<br/>

Come to think of it I think your right, but it looks so good on paper.LOL<br/>
I really love to have those nice little papers to show daddy that we are <br/>
learning here in hs land. Unschooling is so hard to do.<br/>
