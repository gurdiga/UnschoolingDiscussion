<div id="ygrps-yiv-76202346">I just wanted to apologize for my messy posts!  I am having a problem <br/>
with my mail, and I have been forwarding it rather than rewriting it.  But <br/>
there is a lot of other stuff on the page because of it!  Please bear with me <br/>
while I try to teach this computer who&#39;s boss!     jackie</div>
