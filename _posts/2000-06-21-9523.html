<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; I have a friend whose 9 yr old daughter has just been tested and diagnosed<br/>
&gt; as ADD and Dyslexic.  Before taking her out of public school she was on<br/>
&gt; medication, but only for a short while.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She would like to try something, anything, before putting her child back<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; medication.  I know there are books out there and/or programs which<br/>
address<br/>
&gt; diet and homeopathic remedies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can any of you make suggestions?<br/>
&gt; TIA<br/>
&gt; Cindy<br/>
&gt;<br/>

This is so true!  I would suggest that she try modifying her child&#39;s diet.  <br/>
Restrict white flour products and all other refined sugary foods for a period <br/>
of at least 6 weeks.  If she has not done this before, and is willing to do <br/>
so, make sure she knows to expect &quot;withdrawal&quot; symptoms initially, as the <br/>
body adjusts.  It is not uncommon to feel worse before better; so she needs <br/>
at least 6 weeks before assessing if her child is improving.  Tell her to <br/>
cook more fresh foods, and stay away from packaged, additive/ food color <br/>
filled foods.  Hope she will try this!  :)  ~Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040429516">a friend of mine swears by the Feingold diet for her fm ... all four dch<br/>
suffer from ADD/ADHD and were prescribed Ritalin by their ped but mom<br/>
refused to medicate, instead uses the Feingold diet and so far, it&#39;s working<br/>
beautifully!!!  also, I&#39;ve been having a *lot* of probs w/ my asthma lately<br/>
(suffered from severe asthma for yrs, *ack*) and she suggested trying the<br/>
Feingold diet b/c it&#39;s also supposed to be a great help for asthmatics, too<br/>
...   tonight I decided to poke around on their website and it&#39;s really<br/>
interesting and I figure @ this point, it couldn&#39;t *hurt*!!!   so, I thought<br/>
I&#39;d pass this along and maybe someone might find it helpful for their fm,<br/>
too ... of course, I&#39;m usually a day late and a $$$ short w/ things like<br/>
this, ya&#39;ll have prob already discussed Feingold until the cows have come<br/>
home, oh well, she tries &lt;G&gt;<br/>
