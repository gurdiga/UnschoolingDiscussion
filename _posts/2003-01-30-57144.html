Thanks so much for words of wisdom.  I have really considered asking him to <br/>
read through some messages.   As far as him posting here.. I kind of have to <br/>
chuckle.. Oh, I KNOW he would do it.. But, if you guys think I am tough to <br/>
deal with... he woud be 10 times worse.   He would be VERY aggressive, <br/>
probably downright disprectful, argumentative, and plain stubborn.  Heck, <br/>
he&#39;s like this with ME, his own mother, Lord knows he aint gonna give <br/>
&quot;strangers&quot; the benefit of a doubt.  He thinks you guys have brainwashed me <br/>
and he resents the hell out of it.   I am afraid getting into confrontations <br/>
here might even alientate him further from my efforts.   I daresay, if he <br/>
came on this group, you would be very surprised to know is just turned 16.. <br/>
Precocious does not even begin to describe him.    Now, let me offer a <br/>
&quot;disclaimer&quot; .. Landon is a GREAT kid..   Gosh, for most parents of teens, <br/>
they would be thrilled to have a kid like him.  He does not drink, do drugs, <br/>
smoke, .. hes open and honest and  has a job.    Our relationship is ideal <br/>
and I am so proud of him and I trust him completely.   Our recent conflicts <br/>
are directly because of the homeschooling/unschooling changes we have made in <br/>
our lifestyle.   This is another situation ( like the bed time with Dh)  that <br/>
I cant wait out for months to resolve itself.  It affects all of us day to <br/>
day.   He and I DO have private conversations.. but he still cops his <br/>
attitude and lets his opinions be known when he sees something going on that <br/>
he feels should be handled differently.  What he says REALLY affects Anna <br/>
because she idolizes him as a big brother and he has a lot of influence over <br/>
her.  The boys, they just resent him and avoid him because he hurts thier <br/>
feelings.    Again, another tough quandry<br/>
