<div id="ygrps-yiv-634459732">Hey, all!  I posted earlier about suggested reading.  Maybe I was too <br/>
specific about one type of book I was looking for.  I&#39;d love to read <br/>
something related to my life, but I am not just looking for that.<br/>
<br/>
What books have made an impact in your life as unschooling families?  <br/>
What books do you suggest for those new to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tina</div>

<br/>
I think Frank Smith&#39;s book, _The Book of Learning and Forgetting_, is <br/>
very persuasive and it&#39;s a pretty short, light read.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll bet you that you can&#39;t read it and then run around quoting it to <br/>
people! &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

of the name right now.)<br/>

Any suggestions...<br/>
