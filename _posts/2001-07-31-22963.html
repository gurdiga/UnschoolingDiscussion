<br/>
After spending two years living with the Borensteins, an American<br/>
homeschooling family, acclaimed filmmaker Fernanda Rossi engages the most<br/>
skeptical audiences with an entertaining and original film.<br/>
<br/>
Told from the perspective of a funny and inquisitive nine-year old, this<br/>
groundbreaking documentary asks -and answers- 20 essential questions about<br/>
homeschooling: How do you learn? Can you go to college? Do you take any<br/>
classes?Ö<br/>
<br/>
Inventing a Girl is the first documentary on homeschooling ideal for:<br/>
<br/>
ï	Homeschoolers curious to learn about the experiences of other<br/>
homeschooled kids. And their in-laws and neighbors who are still asking<br/>
&quot;How are those kids being socialized?<br/>
<br/>
ï	Parents considering alternative education.<br/>
<br/>
ï	Teachers and administrators who want to fully understand what<br/>
homeschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
ï	Schools and homeschooling organizations as a reference tool.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;A charming and honest film... a must see for parents and educators.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;I loudly applaud Ms. Rossi&#39;s efforts to share this unique approach to<br/>
living and learning, to bring new understanding about homeschooling to a<br/>
wider audience.&quot;<br/>
