some way with guidelines, he would spend the day playing nintendo and game <br/>
boy with pokemon games.  For example, today he told me he was going to read <br/>
(yeah!) but he chose reading the Pokemon Silver handbook.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My first impulse was to ask you to try to get over the &quot;ADD&quot; and &quot;IQ&quot; <br/>
obstacles.  <br/>
Okay.  I&#39;ve gone with my first impulse.<br/>
<br/>
Reading about ships is NOT better than reading about Pokemon.<br/>
Your first impulse was probably to read the sentence before and think I was <br/>
an idiot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not an idiot.  If you want unschooling to work, you need to get over your <br/>
own prejudices about what has &quot;educational value.&quot;   Now that I&#39;ve probably <br/>
totally irritated you, I recommend marking this date on the calendar with <br/>
&quot;Sandra Dodd really pissed me off&quot; or whatever, and then go ahead and do, and <br/>
read, and observe, and live, and see how long it takes for you to realize <br/>
what good advice I gave you on January 9th, and how much you wish you&#39;d&#39;ve <br/>
just taken it then instead of waiting X# of days/weeks/months.  I hope it&#39;s <br/>
not years.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve only allowed &quot;educational games&quot; to be purchased so she&#39;s<br/>
doing math, geography, science, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There really is a HUGE amount of learning to be had outside of &quot;educational&quot; <br/>
materials.  My kids, too, have played many long hours of educational computer <br/>
games, and still do, but my boys have learned tons from the battle and <br/>
strategy games like Civilization and Legions.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;However, if I dont direct him in <br/>
some way with guidelines, he would...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is something you do not know.<br/>
If you always direct him in some way,  you will never, as long as you live, <br/>
know what would have happened if you hadn&#39;t directed him.  And until you stop <br/>
directing, he will not be learning on his own.<br/>

the school system as &quot;hyperactive&quot; andI was told of his genius level IQ, and<br/>
how he wasn&#39;t working to his potential so I should have him drugged...<br/>
Like Hell I told them, the fault is in the system not my kid, if he can&#39;t<br/>
sit still and be bored all day without being disruptive, so what as neither<br/>
could most adults I know.<br/>
Both of these are just labels with little significance in the scheme of<br/>
things, I&#39;ll always recall how the teachers and my Mother reacted to the<br/>
news of my IQ...  I always wished I had purposely flunked the dumb test.<br/>
After the fact I was always being nagged at school and at home about how I<br/>
should be the top of my grade.. blah, blah, blah...   I HATED it, my Mother<br/>
wanted me to join Mensa, but I had no desire to be a part of such an eletist<br/>
organisation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So right, it&#39;s like never allowing a toddler to walk because he might fall.<br/>
If you never give a child the freedom to learn on his/her own, how will you<br/>
ever know what the child will do.  My kids in basically forcing me to allow<br/>
them to unschool did themselves and me a great favor... no more playing<br/>
teacher and trying to work out what the important facts they HAD to know<br/>
were.   They figured it out for themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874493009">This is maybe but isn&#39;t directly related to this<br/>
thread. But I have been thinking about the gifts each<br/>
of has to bring to this world, homschooling/<br/>
unschooling, and the stories/books we read about many<br/>
homeschoolers/ unschoolers that makes it appear that<br/>
of we homeschool out children we can create genius&#39;s<br/>
or gifted children.<br/>
<br/>
Its seems that some of the most popular books out<br/>
thier about homeschooling that talk mostly about kids<br/>
that are gifted (atleasts thats how I percieve it). <br/>
<br/>
So I guess its hard to not fall into this axiety trap<br/>
of wanting out children to excell in something. I know<br/>
I have in the past and go through times of wanting to<br/>
find those gifts in my children. <br/>
<br/>
I see it to some extent currently with my son (only 2<br/>
years). When ever we go anywhere with a piano he is<br/>
drawn to it. So do we bite the bullet and figure out<br/>
how to get one? I have a small desire to learn to play<br/>
piano again. I didn&#39;t take lessons until I was in<br/>
highschool. I loved playing the &#39;moonlight sonata&#39; and<br/>
some scot joplin. We have plenty of hand held<br/>
intruments around. <br/>
<br/>
I see my dd who is very dramatic both in her<br/>
personality and her play. She likes to look herself in<br/>
the mirror and play with her facial expressions when<br/>
she is talking. So I often think oh acting for her<br/>
maybe.<br/>
<br/>
So when I see these things and think I am projecting<br/>
or maybe not. Or I wanting something special/<br/>
something to put my kids in a box to be something. Or<br/>
maybe its the trap up &quot;keeping up with the Jones&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Got any words of wisdom anyone? Sandra?<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

The Colfax kids are also very impressive, although I don&#39;t think the books<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539258229">Hello all<br/>
this point comes up alot when I try to explain our way of life to others.  I<br/>
use the research to point out that home-educated children outperform their<br/>
schooled peers in just about everything.  But my belief in &quot;unschooling&#39;<br/>
means that I often do not teach them anything.  I am here to help them live<br/>
their lives the way they want, not treating childhood as a training ground<br/>
for adulthood.  I find it distressing when people unschool as long as their<br/>
children are doing things that they approve of, or doing lots of academic<br/>
stuff, but then become strict and stifling as soon as it appears that the<br/>
children are going in their own direction.  That people sometimes talk about<br/>
unschooling as a teaching method is ridiculous. That people think<br/>
unschooling is okay as long as you have children who are accomplishing<br/>
things also disturbs me.  I know of children who do not read, but are read<br/>
to, and they have immense thinking abilities.  I know children who are<br/>
amazing who have never done anything but play Magic and Playstation and<br/>
other war games.  I know children who are thought of as slow, but their<br/>
parents dedication to unschooling meant that it was not as issue, and one<br/>
day they woke up and wanted to do exams and go to university (and did).  I<br/>
think that the use of the genius example has its place.  It helps to explain<br/>
to outsiders, it helps many of us to see that our children are not going to<br/>
suffer BECAUSE they are home- educated, but it does often undremine our<br/>
confidence in ourselves and our children to read about all of these<br/>
exceptional people.<br/>
<br/>
I remember hearing John Taylor Gatto talk at a conference in London.  He<br/>
used the word &quot;miracle&quot; to describe young people who had accomplished much<br/>
while they were young, settign up businesses etc.  The problem is that it<br/>
isn&#39;t a miracle.  So many young people would accomplish so much if they were<br/>
not held back by institutions and people who force them to live lives<br/>
according to external motivation.  But wehter or not WE see them as<br/>
accomplishing much is not the point.  It is whether or not THEY feel that<br/>
they have accomplished something that is important.  Winning the regional<br/>
Pokemon tournement may not be held up by home-educators as  great an<br/>
accomplishment as winning the regional spelling bee, but that is not for us<br/>
to decide. It is still a great accomplishment.  Finding the courage to<br/>
partake when you know you are going to lose is equally great.<br/>
I am beginning to ramble but I think my point is that achievemnt and success<br/>
are only relevant according to our own personal goals.  To objectify them<br/>
and use, money or status or academics as a measure of success only leads to<br/>
disatisfied human beings.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
