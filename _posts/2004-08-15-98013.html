<div id="ygrps-yiv-555614843">Greetings,<br/>
 <br/>
I have been on this list for a few months just silently reading your posts. We  have two children, 18 & 10. Both of my sons attended private school last year due to a serious car accident one of our relatives was in and some other personal issues.<br/>
 <br/>
I have been fascinated by homeschooling and especially unschooling. MY 10 year old has begged to homeschool this year. His classroom size would be 24 in this private school and he really wants to be home. He would be attending fourth grade due to the high academic regiment. Yuk!<br/>
I am sure many of you have faced trails in your own families. Where do I start? What can I do for him to make his year easier and also not have family/friends question my ability to homeschool him since we have had trauma in our family from these accidents? Why do people think we need to put our children in school and this will be better for them when they beg you to keep them home? I know I am ranting a little here...Unschooling just seems to fit our family. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for reading and I enjoy getting to know you all alittle more. <br/>
<br/>
Debbie<br/>

<br/>
One thing you could do would be to say &quot;We&#39;re going to try this this year&quot; or <br/>
&quot;It seems he could use some more time with me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Making it seem temporary or tentative will probably keep some pressure off, <br/>
and by the time you get to the second phase, your confidence will be up too.<br/>
