<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659551884">&lt;&lt;2$ a day turns into 8$ a week (if we go to the park 4 times), etc.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I get a $3.25 coffee at least three times per week and I get my FAVORITE gas <br/>
station $1.00 coffee several times per week.  Can you tell I LOVE coffee <br/>
(any coffee) and it makes me happy.  Sorscha is 10 1/2 and it would not go <br/>
over well if I said, &quot;You can&#39;t have that ice cream because we can&#39;t afford <br/>
it, it&#39;s not a priority, etc.&quot;  She would see that I was getting &#39;my <br/>
passion&#39; but denying her hers.  That could cause some serious resentment <br/>
between us.<br/>
<br/>
Last summer, the ice cream man KNEW our Tribe was at the park every Monday. <br/>
I swear, every week like clockwork he&#39;d show up.  All the kids would run <br/>
like wild banshees and line-up (well, not really line-up - it was more like <br/>
a mushed pile against the truck).  A few of us parents would all just take <br/>
orders and pay for whoever&#39;s kids.  EVERY KID got an ice cream.  It was <br/>
beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
WOW, how nostalgic!  I&#39;m all softy right now.  Where&#39;s that darn ice cream <br/>
truck this year?!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791308251">There is something about an ice cream truck that is just irresistible!  The anticipation, the colors, the sounds, ordering what you want, and getting a frozen treat from a truck on a hot day.  It is magic!  <br/>
<br/>
About two years ago an ice cream truck drove down our street.  By the time Dennis found shoes and some cash he had to chase the ice cream truck down.  He was running, yelling, and waving his hand in the air (he was carrying Megan too).  The truck finally stopped and Megan got her ice cream.  She might have eaten it all, but maybe not.  I don&#39;t remember and she probably doesn&#39;t either.  But she remembers her the time her dad chased down an ice cream truck just for her.<br/>
<br/>
If an ice cream truck stops anywhere near us, I know Megan is going to want ice cream.  As someone else said, it is sort of the cost of being there.  Just like I know that if Megan and I go to the mall we will be stopping at the play area, looking at Webkinz and buying a pretzel.  And if I go to the mall with Dennis add Radio Shack & Sharper Image to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Megan&#39;s birthday is coming up in a few weeks.  Balloons and decorations are a must.  But birthdays only come once a year.  I love finding opportunities to make her smile every day.  <br/>
