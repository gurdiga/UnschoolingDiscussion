 </span></blockquote>Well, it would probably help if I&#39;d given you the right author--Benedict <br/>
Anderson wrote _Imagined Communities_ not Chatterjee, though he wrote <br/>
some really cool stuff too. Anderson&#39;s chapter 5,  &quot;Old Languages, New <br/>
Models&quot; probably touches most specifically on his idea of print <br/>
capitalism&#39;s impact on nationalism.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a little blurb about it, though I think it makes it sound very <br/>
dry and boring--much too academic-speak for my taste, shame:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The close of the era of successful national liberation movements in the <br/>
Americas coincided with the onset of the age of nationalism in Europe. <br/>
These &#39;&#39;new nationalisms&#39;&#39; were different in two respects: 1.) national <br/>
print languages were of central ideological and political importance, <br/>
and 2.) the nation became something capable of being consciously aspired <br/>
to from early on due to the &#39;&#39;models&#39;&#39; set forth by the Creole pioneers. <br/>
Vernacular print capitalism is important to class formation, <br/>
particularly the rise of the bourgeoisie. Prior to this, solidarities <br/>
were the products of kinship, clientship, and personal loyalties. The <br/>
bourgeoisie, however, achieved solidarities on an imaginary basis <br/>
through print capitalism. That is, they didn&#39;t know one another because <br/>
of marriage or proper transactions, but because they came to visualize <br/>
others like themselves through print. The nobility then were potential <br/>
consumers of the philological revolution. As soon as the events of the <br/>
Americas reached the European nobility through print, the imagined <br/>
realities of nation-states became models for Europe. &quot; (source: <br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s a review that paints a better picture, I think:<br/>
&quot;Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and <br/>
Spread of Nationalism - This is the book that most history students <br/>
venturing into the study of either cultural history or nationalism are <br/>
all assigned to read. It also happens to be fairly interesting, <br/>
well-written and rather useful. The premise is that communities cannot <br/>
be created by simply drawing some borders and declaring a nation, they <br/>
must be imagined, or understood by those people who are part of them. In <br/>
order for a nation of people to feel like a nation they have to see <br/>
themselves as somehow similiar and connected to other people in that <br/>
nation, no matter how far away or strange they may be. Anderson outlines <br/>
the many ways in which this can be achieved through language, the <br/>
reading of newspapers, national holidays, the development of roads and <br/>
cities and even though symbols and clothing. This is well worth the time <br/>
if you&#39;re interested in constructions of the social, the development of <br/>
nationalism or the creation of the modern nation state.&quot; (source: <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t have a lot of time right now, with getting the house ready to <br/>
sell and all, but I&#39;m sure you could get a copy of the book at the UNM <br/>
library and just xerox the relevent chapter. Some scribbled notes I have <br/>
in the margins for that chapter are: &quot;rise of dictionaries and <br/>
philology, expansion of linguistic study, discovery of other ancient <br/>
languages participated in the leveling of great Western languages, open <br/>
field of comparison with travel, impact of exploration, entrance of <br/>
comparative critique, print created a &quot;thing&quot; out of revolution and <br/>
provided a model for other revolutions, coinciding of nation with <br/>
national languages, rise of the bourgeoisie depended upon print and <br/>
imagination, coalition readerships.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s somewhat helpful. Sorry about the wrong name.<br/>

The author of Imagined Communities is Benedict Anderson. Here are<br/>
links to a couple of summaries, and amazon.com has tons of reviews. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
In Partha Chatterjee&#39;s book The Nation and Its Fragments, he critiques<br/>
Anderson&#39;s book, and I&#39;ve also found references to a critique of<br/>
Anderson in Chatterjee&#39;s book Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World.<br/>
<br/>
I read some of this stuff in a graduate course on Gender, Sexuality<br/>
and Colonialism a few years ago. It&#39;s been a while, but as I recall,<br/>
the critique of Chatterjee and others (in the Subaltern Studies<br/>
Collective, if anyone is interested) is partly that Anderson looks<br/>
only at the way that nationalism developed in Europe and the ruling<br/>
classes of the colonies, and did not look at the very different forms<br/>
of nationalism that were/are anti-colonial--and based less on common<br/>
language and print capitalism, and more on struggles for social<br/>
justice and independence.<br/>
