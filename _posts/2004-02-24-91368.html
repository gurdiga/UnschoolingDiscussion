Stunt people often come from martial arts. Fighting and just falling down is<br/>
the most common stunt work. Despite the (usually exaggerated) claims of some<br/>
actors about doing their own stunts, most actors are too precious to be<br/>
risked even say falling off a chair. (Obvious exception Jackie Chan) There<br/>
are tricks that stunt doubles learn about putting up an arm as they fall to<br/>
hide their face, or turning so that they land looking the other way to<br/>
facilitate the switch back to the actor. Then there are people who<br/>
specialize in high falls, and there are people who specialize in driving. <br/>
<br/>
Some are coming from engineering or rigging backgrounds who develop the<br/>
equipment for stunts. (see Fear Factor). Closely linked to stunt work is<br/>
mechanical effects and pyrotechnics. These are people who like to blow stuff<br/>
up. The person staggering about on fire is a stunt person. The link is so<br/>
close that many companies describe themselves as stunts and effects<br/>
companies. The stunt department works closely with art department (for<br/>
exploding windows etc) and wardrobe. Another area for stunt work is camera �<br/>
sometimes the camera operator is doing a stunt also � going down the<br/>
building on a wire or leaping out of an airplane. Stunt people are experts<br/>
about safety precautions, and always examine and set up their own boxes or<br/>
airbags.<br/>
