&lt;&lt; WHY should we let the law define who is and who <br/>
isn&#39;t a real homeschooler? I&#39;m discouraged that people don&#39;t think about the <br/>
further ramifications of that kind of thinking. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understood the argument made here, though, about the law eventually <br/>
changing to make homeschooling all as accountable as those enrolled directly <br/>
with the schools.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, I&#39;m coming from a place of concern about methodology and learning <br/>
theory while others are being more politically minded.<br/>
<br/>
I would really hate to use my child as a political pawn one way or another.  <br/>
For some people, though, they think of government first (how to bring it <br/>
down, how to abide by it, how to hide from it, or whatever) and non-political <br/>
realities later.<br/>
<br/>
When I speak at conferences, I run through my notes before to try to make <br/>
sure what I&#39;m saying will be as true anywhere, regardless of state law.  And <br/>
when people ask me about state law, I tell them they need to ask the locals.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the way it works because of the way people work.  It works, <br/>
if allowed to work, because of the relationships between people, and because <br/>
it uses people&#39;s natural proclivities, working with human nature instead of <br/>
against it.  It works, when it works, without regard to the physical point on <br/>
earth of the family practicing that philosophy.  <br/>
<br/>
Now if a family&#39;s in a state that requires annual testing, that&#39;s <br/>
unfortunate, and they might not be able to relax into unschooling, or just <br/>
might have to be eclectic if they intend to fulfill all state laws.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t volunteered to tweak families&#39; lives to match a certain state or <br/>
country&#39;s laws.  I&#39;ve volunteered to help people see how kids learn naturally.<br/>
<br/>
So politics are out of my chosen and accepted arena.  I learn what I know <br/>
about it  peripherally, and with resistence.  I&#39;m grateful that there are <br/>
people who do pay attention to such things, but we don&#39;t ALL have to live <br/>
right at that point of awareness.<br/>
<br/>
But still, I wouldn&#39;t care if our local school was getting the money they <br/>
would get if my kids were in.  I wish they would.  I wish our departure would <br/>
mean better student-teacher ratios, and more money to go around for the kids <br/>
remaining.<br/>
