I know, I&#39;m late as usual, but wanted to offer some suggestions for reading<br/>
material for boys.  Depending on what level they are reading for themselves,<br/>
some of the following are things my son loved to read himself:<br/>
Billy and Blaze books by C.W. Anderson<br/>
The Treasure of the Lost Lagoon and other Otto and Uncle Tooth Adventures by<br/>
Geoffrey Hayes (these are step into reading books for grades 2-3)<br/>
<br/>
He liked other Step Into Reading books like The True Story of Balto<br/>
(Standiford) and Ice Mummy (Dubowski) but once he got the hang of reading we<br/>
moved into &quot;real&quot; books.  He still prefers picture books to chapter books<br/>
(he&#39;s 8 1/2 and reading aprx 5th grade level on his own).  When he was<br/>
younger he liked the Henry and Mudge books and Mr Putter and Tabby books.<br/>
<br/>
If your sons likes King Arthur, as mine does, try Robert D. SanSouci&#39;s 4<br/>
picture books: Young Arthur, Young Lancelot, Young Guinivere and Young<br/>
Merlin.  I can give you LOTS of suggestions on medieval/Celtic books if<br/>
that&#39;s what they like.<br/>
<br/>
If they are nature buffs, try Jim Arnosky...he&#39;s got real easy books to<br/>
moderate books.  Jane Yolen has some good picture books and chapter books.<br/>
Bruce Coville is very funny, my ds really liked Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon<br/>
Hatcher.  If they&#39;ve not read Captain Underpants by Dav Pilkey they should,<br/>
boys especially like these funny books.  And don&#39;t forget James Howe<br/>
(Bunnicula, Howl-aday Inn, et al).<br/>
<br/>
My son also loves books on tape and is able to &quot;read&quot; books intended for<br/>
older kids this way.  We always have a book aloud going at home (right now<br/>
it&#39;s Lord of the Rings) but we spend ALOT of time in the car so he listens<br/>
to lots of good stuff on books on tape.  Many of the books mentioned above<br/>
can be found in the books on tape section in your local library.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to post off list if you&#39;d like more ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952603493">We just finished &quot;Lady Daisy&quot;.  A 9 year old boy finds a Victorian era<br/>
doll in his Grandmother&#39;s attic.  She lets him keep it, but he has to<br/>
deal with his Dad and a boy at school giving him a hard time about it. <br/>
(The parts about school are only very small parts of the story.)  The<br/>
doll talks, but of course, grownups can&#39;t hear it.  An absolutely<br/>
wonderful story, that had me with tears in my eyes at the end.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774636312">Thanks Cindy,<br/>
       These sound really GREAT!  I&#39;m impressed that your son is reading at a<br/>
5th grade level at 81/2! My son really struggles with reading. He has incredible<br/>
comprehension and enjoy a  story when I read it to him but when he reads it<br/>
himself the mechanics of reading just make it not fun for him. He is definitely<br/>
a 3-d visual thinker and learner (right brain).  We now have earphones and a<br/>
cassette player that he can listen to books on tape. I like the idea of playing<br/>
the books out loud. My biggest challenge is not to worry so much about the<br/>
reading stuff and just keep giving him the story (which he loves) by my reading<br/>
aloud or by books on tape. Anyway - thanks again    Karen   p.s- I think both my<br/>
sons will like  captain underpants -just a hunch :)<br/>

Thanks Mary Ellen, I&#39;m excited about the book list I typed up as I was
receiving the book suggestions. I really am glad I found this list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138400461">ok, I have to ask, cuz this sounds like a great story<br/>
for ds, cuz he loves dolls, but he can only handle so<br/>
much emotional-ness in his stories and movies. (he<br/>
cried in the movie &quot;We&#39;re Back, A dinosaur story&quot;) Why<br/>
did it leave you with tears? Of joy? Or of the &quot;the<br/>
gramma dies and he learns this huge lesson of love and<br/>
acceptance and has the doll to remember her by...&quot;<br/>
sort of thing? Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with<br/>
the latter, but I know I can&#39;t start a book that ends<br/>
like that cuz my kids just lost their grampa who they<br/>
were very close to a year ago, but they still get sad<br/>
over it. You can email me privately to answer, so it<br/>
doesn&#39;t ruin the ending for the rest of the list. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456268016">Hi Bobbie,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to ruin it for you either!  It was just such a sweet<br/>
sentimental twist at the end.  My girls didn&#39;t cry.  They just asked me<br/>
why I was crying.<br/>
<br/>
Several times during the story the grandma said things about &quot;when I&#39;m in<br/>
my box&quot;, referring to after she died, and the boy, Ned, would ask her not<br/>
to talk about it.  The doll didn&#39;t actually belong to the grandmother. <br/>
It was a house that had been in the family for generations, and the doll<br/>
had belonged to the grandma&#39;s husband&#39;s aunt, who had died at the age of<br/>
5 from scarlet fever or something.  (Ned&#39;s great-aunt)  Ned found the<br/>
doll while helping his grandma clean the attic and she said he could keep<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If you still want to know exactly what happened, let me know and I will<br/>
e-mail you off list about it.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s me here, being &#39;devil&#39;s advocate&#39; again *grin* <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sounds to me like it would be cathartic to &#39;open the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; floodgates.&#39;  But that&#39;s JMO, of course...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tracy<br/>
&gt; who would frogmarch her little&#39;un to the nearest<br/>
&gt; school <br/>
&gt; right now if it wasn&#39;t 2am...  Small child + piece<br/>

&gt; crystal + 19&quot; &#39;puter monitor = bloody cross<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896277308">I guess you&#39;ll know when you are ready, Bobbie!  After our yellow lab<br/>
died, we listened to Old Yeller on tape, and then got the video too. <br/>
That&#39;s not quite the same as losing a human family member though.  I am<br/>
sorry to hear about your Dad.  Even though we expect our parents to go<br/>
before us, it is still such a loss.  More so once we have kids and sense<br/>
their loss of a grandparent as well.<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me of a scene at my mil&#39;s funeral.  Caitlyn, (whose<br/>
grandmother is mil&#39;s sister who is still alive) told her cousin that she<br/>
would share her grandma with her.  They were about 5 or 6 and she was so<br/>
sincere.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Ellen<br/>
The other day, she caught herself about to tell someone<br/>
her hair looked nice on the phone.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-40809302">:)<br/>
that reallymakes me smile. When my dad died, we were<br/>
all there at the hospital afterwards(I&#39;m the 5th of 6<br/>
kids) and all of our cousins (dad&#39;s bro&#39;s kids...7 of<br/>
them) and their wives and my uncledave (prounounced as<br/>
one word, mind you) ...who everyone calls uncledave,<br/>
even my friends...we&#39;re one of those families that<br/>
just adopts people into it all the time...was there<br/>
and someone, I don&#39;t remember who turned to him and<br/>
said &quot;well, you&#39;ve inherited 6 more kids, plus<br/>
grankids and a second wife. hope you can handle it&quot;<br/>
and we all laughed (we&#39;re that kind of family too) and<br/>
he honestly is shared with us now. :) It wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
odd for him to give me away at my wedding. :)<br/>
thanks for sharing that. Kids are wonderful. Such<br/>
clear pictures of love and innocence.<br/>
