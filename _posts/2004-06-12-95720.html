<div id="ygrps-yiv-760061589">Stanley, on the Disney channel, is about the closest thing to an <br/>
unschooling show. Stanley and his friends learn about an animal <br/>
because it&#39;s relevant to what&#39;s going on in their lives. A trip to <br/>
the dentist leads to learning about walruses and their teeth, not <br/>
wanting to wear elbow and knee pads leads to learning about rhinos <br/>
and their protective skin, etc. On the one where he gets a scooter <br/>
and doesn&#39;t want to wear the padding, it&#39;s not a matter of his <br/>
parents telling him he _has_ to wear it, but of him making the <br/>
decision that it&#39;s a good idea. <br/>
<br/>
They also don&#39;t dumb things down too much and just say &quot;nocturnal&quot; as <br/>
though young kids were capable of understanding it!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else a big Stanley fan?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387376487">This is funny,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also just recently realized, that I like Stanley.  If we&#39;re <br/>
flipping through the tv show guide, I catch myself saying, &quot;can we <br/>
watch Stanley?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love it when the, is it the dog and cat?, break into song.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt; &quot;Its the great big book of everything&quot;.   Its so cheesy, gotta <br/>
love it.  Then they sit back down.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always loved encyclopedias, dictionaries and, of course, <br/>
google.  So it makes sense that I like the great big book of <br/>
everything.   Its a lot like my huge new dictonary that I just <br/>
got.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768368702">Jaiden (5.5) loves Stanley too, although he is frequently muttering under his breath while watching the show &quot;it isn&#39;t the great big book of EVERYTHING, it&#39;s the great big book of EVERY animal. If it was everything in it, it&#39;d have more than animals&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The fact that it only seems to have animals and not everything, but they call it &quot;eveything&quot; really bothers him. <br/>
 <br/>
He wants to make a real great big book of everything, and it really will have everything...:)<br/>

Even the internet doesn&#39;t have everything, DARN IT!<br/>
<br/>
A book that shows unschooling (though it didn&#39;t mean to) almost perfectly is <br/>
Grover and the Everything in the Whole Wide World Museum.   He might like that <br/>
book.   You can get them used at Amazon, I think.   There&#39;s a link to it from <br/>
here:<br/>

It was still in print a few years ago and I ordered a batch, but am down to <br/>
one, I think, somewhere.  I still have the softer, older one from when my kids <br/>
were little.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670601270">I think it was on this list that we were talking about unschooling movies<br/>
and tv shows.<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to me, since Jayn put it on this evening, that &quot;Kiki&#39;s Delivery<br/>
Service&quot; would certainly fall into that category. The heroine is 13 years<br/>
old, on her witch training year, and the whole movie unfolds as if school<br/>
simply did not exist both for her, and the other young people she meets. It<br/>
also has the ideas of learning being passed down from mother to daughter,<br/>
following your own heart (the magic within), children as responsible people,<br/>
and finding friends and mentors of all ages. <br/>
