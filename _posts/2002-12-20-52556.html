&lt;&lt; I think it was Ren who also <br/>
noticed that maybe the shirt chewing is the &quot;public&quot; equivalent to the thumb <br/>
sucking at home or other comfortable places.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe sometimes, but Marty and Holly  never sucked their thumbs yet were seen <br/>
many times with their own t-shirts hanging from their mouths.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s not &quot;part of a set&quot; of behaviors anyway, but just one independent <br/>
thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I pick.  Holly picks.  My boys don&#39;t so much as pop their own zits.  They can <br/>
ENTIRELY leave their bodies alone to heal.  I got six or seven fleabites in <br/>
SC.  I&#39;m more allergic to those than anything I know.  They don&#39;t heal up <br/>
quickly, and often get infected.  I mess with them, on top of all that.   I <br/>
have to use bandaids and tell myself to leave the bandaid alone.  Holly does <br/>
too, but not from watching me.  She has a great scab fascination.  Hers or <br/>
anyone else&#39;s.  <br/>

<br/>
yeah.  But I get fleabites when I go to California too, both of the places I <br/>
ever regularly stayed there.  The people who were living there either were <br/>
immune or didn&#39;t taste like candy.  Fleas like me espcially.   Marty had a <br/>
few, but his just went away (because he left them alone, probably).<br/>
<br/>
The first time I broke a leg, long ago, I had some kind of mountain-bug bites <br/>
(a spider, maybe) on my abdomen and I kept showing them and asking for <br/>
something for the, and nobody at the hospital cared at all for a whole week.  <br/>
So this time, I didn&#39;t bother to tell anyone in the hospital, &quot;Look!  A flea <br/>
bit me.&quot;   I learn, but not very fast!  <br/>
