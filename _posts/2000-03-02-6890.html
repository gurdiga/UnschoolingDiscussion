 I was wondering if you knew of any boy Ballet students who may wish to<br/>
 correspond with a Canadian 10 year old boy who enjoys Ballet? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Sonia!<br/>
<br/>
My 10yo son just started taking tap, jazz & acro-dance lessons about 2 weeks <br/>
ago (and started BMX bike-racing at the same time - go figure LOL)  He&#39;s <br/>
thinking about ballet as well, but he&#39;s not quite there yet.  I know he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be much in the way of encouragement (yet :), but I thought I&#39;d let <br/>
you know that there are others out here!  <br/>
<br/>
If I can help in any way, just email me - I&#39;m usually here :)<br/>
