<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I whole heartedly agree with you. I never minded 
being an only. My point was that people have a misconception that raising an 
only is less demanding. I was trying to negate that. Beleive me, I understand 
the pluses of being an only. No one to fight with, all the toys are yours, you 
have control of the tv, if you want quiet time you just go home. On the other 
hand, raising an only can be very demanding. The child wants to play a game and 
no one&#39;s around you&#39;re it, the child gets bored in the car you have to entertain 
them, etc. As Olivia said every family situation has positives and 
negatives.</font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I was an only, My husband was an only, and our 
  son, at this point , is an only.&nbsp; We have constant oppurtunities to be 
  around others.&nbsp; All day, everyday.&nbsp; I kind of value the time spent, 
  as an only.&nbsp; I think the first person in the world we should really get 
  to know is ourselves.&nbsp; Don&#39;t get me wrong, I long, at times , to be in 
  sibling company, my friend for instance has 5 kids..we love to spend time with 
  them..we are today, in fact.&nbsp; Extended family really.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think 
  it&#39;s so bad to be an only, perhaps their are experiences there, that others 
  don&#39;t have time for.&nbsp; We rarely , actually have just , quiet time 
  alone.&nbsp; Few people do, I think it a healthy, meditative practice, if we 
  had some time for it, which we have to &quot;make&quot; time for too.&nbsp; But being an 
  only is cool, too.&nbsp; My 50 cents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle*</font></div><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a
