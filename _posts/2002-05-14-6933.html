<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718341867">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Who was it that was looking for a polka partner in So. CA?  I talked to my <br/>
folk dancing polka dancing friend -- he said most of the action was up nearer <br/>
Riverside than here.  Let me know who you are again, and I&#39;ll forward the <br/>
stuff he sent to me.<br/>
