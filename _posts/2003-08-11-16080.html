<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035065282">No, E.E. Cummings didn&#39;t write his name lower case. He used punctuation,<br/>
white space and capitalization as a tool in his poetry for visual effect.<br/>
Sometimes he capitalizes, sometimes he doesn&#39;t. He did sign his name in the<br/>
usual manner, though, and his widow has tried to get people to use the upper<br/>
case in referring to him. Of course, it&#39;s a little more complicated than<br/>
that, if you want to follow the trail: <br/>

I&#39;ll see if I can find the quote within its poem in my Complete Works. I&#39;m<br/>
pretty sure it&#39;s written as &quot;nobody-but-yourself,&quot; but it may have different<br/>
spacing as well. It&#39;s difficult to transfer his poetry on email and<br/>
webpages, because often the spacing is lost. <br/>

Who&#39;s an even bigger Cummings fan than Patinkin fan....<br/>

I&#39;d rather learn from one bird how to sing<br/>
than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Barb, are you making a visual pun by capitalizing e.e. cummings, <br/>
&gt; making him, who is known for using lower case, &quot;like everybody else&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nancy, who notices such things but can&#39;t remember most phone numbers <br/>
