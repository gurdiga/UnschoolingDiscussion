What I meant by for profit wasn&#39;t that there shouldn&#39;t be any profit <br/>
at all.  I just don&#39;t like how the logging companies strip the land.<br/>
<br/>
Also the 5 forests I know of are owned by 3 neighbors.  They chose to <br/>
strip the land for money.  Not b/c of hardships but because they <br/>
wanted new things.  A new yacht.  A huge new house.  Other examples.<br/>
With no regard to the land or animals.<br/>
<br/>
That is what makes me sick.<br/>

if they don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; it.  In other words, I&#39;d have a problem with <br/>
clear-cutting even if the owner needed the money because of hardship.  I <br/>
prefer the native attitude toward land, in the sense of it being our <br/>
responsibility to care for it rather than wreck it.<br/>
