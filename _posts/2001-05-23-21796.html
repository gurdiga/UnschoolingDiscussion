<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085754549">I received this yesterday from a friend&#39;s friend.  Although she lives in <br/>
Albuquerque, we&#39;ve never met! &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s close friends with a family I know <br/>
well in Bonfield, Ontario.  I find that really amusing, but I&#39;m glad to be <br/>
one of her e-mail pals, and she&#39;s a really great writer.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her permission to send this to this list, and she wrote &lt;&lt;Share all <br/>
you want. I knew you are a home schooler who doesn&#39;t want to marry off her 12 <br/>
year old to a patriarch. That is why I e-mailed you. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
--------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Last week I found six Elsie Dinsmore books at a store off Central Avenue. I<br/>
<br/>
immediately bought all that weren&#39;t duplicates to mine even though I paid<br/>
<br/>
$1. apiece for the last ones I laid hands on (in Washburn, Wisconsin 15<br/>
<br/>
years ago) and these had escalated to $14.   &quot;You were lucky to get so<br/>
<br/>
many,&quot; the bookstore owner said. &quot; These just came in. They are very<br/>
<br/>
popular. They just fly off the shelves once I put them on my mailing<br/>
<br/>
lists.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was amazed since, for many years, I was the only person I knew who was<br/>
<br/>
intimately acquainted with Elsie---or even acquainted at all. My<br/>
<br/>
grandmother, a huge fan in her youth (we are now back to around 1906)  had<br/>
<br/>
read every single Elsie book as a child. Since no one in my family ever<br/>
<br/>
threw out a book, I&#39;d read several a good fifty years after they&#39;d gone out<br/>
<br/>
of print.  Curiosity piqued, I went to the Net to find 2,110 entries for<br/>
<br/>
Elsie. I discovered, to my horror, that Elsie is being pushed by Christian<br/>
<br/>
Fundamentalists as achild,<br/>
<br/>
exemplifies the idea that character counts in the face of tribulation. The<br/>
<br/>
books accurately picture 19th century life.&quot;  It turns out that the<br/>
<br/>
Fundamentalist press has even reprinted the first four Elsie books. The<br/>
<br/>
first is now titled Elsie, the Endless Wait  (this is when she is pilloried<br/>
<br/>
by her cousins while longing for her absent father). There is even a line<br/>
<br/>
of Elsie dolls illustrating pertinent moments in the stories.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A bit of literary background: The Elsie Dinsmore series, written by Martha<br/>
<br/>
Finlay) was quite possibly the first set of &quot;girls&quot; books. The Dodd Company<br/>
<br/>
(before Meade came along) published the first story in 1868. This antedates<br/>
<br/>
even Little Women though Louisa was a far better writer. In their day,<br/>
<br/>
which lasted about fifty years, Elsie sold hugely. There were eventually<br/>
<br/>
perhaps twenty five or thirty books and the story was  terminated only<br/>
<br/>
because Finlay died.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Despite the fact that I dote on Elsie, I am horrified that defenseless<br/>
<br/>
Christian children are being assigned this book  because---for those of you<br/>
<br/>
that are not Elsie fans---Elsie is NOT Nancy Drew in a hoopskirt . A brief<br/>
<br/>
summary:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elsie is a Southern heiress who came to be because her father and mother<br/>
<br/>
fell in love and eloped when he was seventeen and she was fifteen. Elsie&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
mother died in childbirth at 16. Her father Horace, horrified, took off for<br/>
<br/>
Europe leaving Elsie to be raised by Mrs. Murray, a Scotch-Presyterian<br/>
<br/>
housekeeper and Chloe, Elsie&#39;s beloved black Mammie, who adores all white<br/>
<br/>
folk but particularly adores Elsie. When Mrs. Murray kicks the bucket,<br/>
<br/>
Elsie is sent to live with her paternal Grandfather and his second wife, a<br/>
<br/>
social climber with a passel of awful children, most notably Enna, who<br/>
<br/>
abuses Elsie daily. The story opens as Horace arrives home from Europe when<br/>
<br/>
Elsie is eight. He cannot stand the sight of her, because she looks exactly<br/>
<br/>
like his dead wife, and he cannot stand listening to her either, because<br/>
<br/>
she is a devout Christian who won&#39;t play secular songs on Sunday or wear<br/>
<br/>
new clothes to church because they would take her mind off worship in God&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
house. Elsie falls off piano benches, passes into brain fever and suffers<br/>
<br/>
other horrors too numerous to mention until such a time as she convinces<br/>
<br/>
her father to be saved too. Now mind you, all of the above is not a world<br/>
<br/>
that I embrace but although narrowly righteous, it&#39;s not  deviant. What IS<br/>
<br/>
horrifying about the assignment of these books to unknowing children is<br/>
<br/>
that the following elements ALSO figure in Elsie&#39;s perennial saga:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Elsie owns three hundred slaves in her own name and, in book four, buys<br/>
<br/>
several more. She always calls them &quot;my people&quot; as in,&quot; my possessions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. All the black people in the book (with the exception of Chloe&#39;s &quot;unruly<br/>
<br/>
buck husband&quot; who is sold away from her) love the Massa and give thanks<br/>
<br/>
practically daily for their servitude. Chloe&#39;s husband, in his old age,<br/>
<br/>
sees the light of God and becomes a willing slave once more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. Elsie&#39;s relationship with her father is most peculiar, involving as it<br/>
<br/>
does many mouth-to-mouth kisses and caresses. She strokes him regularly and<br/>
<br/>
speaks of her adoration. He returns it. Every day she sits on his lap as he<br/>
<br/>
instructs her. This goes on until she is fifteen or so. She does nothing<br/>
<br/>
without his permission, because to obey one&#39;s parents is absolute filial<br/>
<br/>
duty,  even unto her 25th year. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. After a brief interlude with a fortune hunter in Book 3 (a man that<br/>
<br/>
Horace quickly dispatches to the state pen), Elsie marries her father&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
best friend, who is 20 years older than she is and whom she has known since<br/>
<br/>
she was eight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is for reasons 3 and 4 that I, while in high school, wrote an essay<br/>
<br/>
called &quot;Elsie Dinsmore Meets Sigmund Freud.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5. Elsie is not an inclusive Christian. In books one and two she is<br/>
<br/>
threatened with convent school. She knows this is the end for her because<br/>
<br/>
what the priests and nuns do in those places is unspeakable. Mrs. Murray,<br/>
<br/>
her old housekeeper, told her all about it. At the very least she will be<br/>
<br/>
locked away and tortured until she converts. Papists are condemned in<br/>
<br/>
several of the following books too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6. Anti-semitism crops up in Book 5, &quot;Elsie&#39;s Children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7. The KKK is a force for good, Cousin Enna becomes a Confederate spy and<br/>
<br/>
the Dinsmore darkies (all of whom speak perfect Jim Crow and Zip Coon)<br/>
<br/>
resist freedom, lingering into the 1890&#39;s as &quot;servants&quot; whose wages are<br/>
<br/>
never mentioned. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8.Not to misrepresent things: Elsie is a model slaveowner. She forbids<br/>
<br/>
flogging, substituting loss of privileges and imprisonment on bread and<br/>
<br/>
water as punishments for failure to work. She lectures her New England<br/>
<br/>
overseer about how one must allow for the indolent nature of the black folk<br/>
<br/>
and arranges the services of a chaplain for &quot;her people.&quot; Her children are<br/>
<br/>
unfailingly thoughtful to their slave playmates, teaching them that when<br/>
<br/>
they go to heaven, they will turn white like their masters.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
9. Did I mention that Elsie, besides being a bigot, is an insufferable<br/>
<br/>
prig?  She  suffers nervous prostrations and is given to dialogue like,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you vexed with me, Papa?&quot; Following this line,  she frequently kneels<br/>
<br/>
at his feet.  Later, when she is a woman, Elsie says &quot;Unhand me this<br/>
<br/>
instant, sir!&quot; and the like.  Naturally, she is utterly beautiful and<br/>
<br/>
worshipped by all. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love Elsie---the way I love to study poisonous reptiles. As a role model<br/>
<br/>
OR as history OR as as example of good English composition, Elsie is a<br/>
<br/>
disaster. That she is now being touted as a Christian example to malleable<br/>
<br/>
children indicates what the Fundamentalist Right may be all about, a<br/>
<br/>
strange world of racial privilege, religious intolerance and child<br/>
<br/>
marriage. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our current president is supported by the religious right who consider him<br/>
<br/>
one of their own. I worry. sk</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881388419">While I appreciate the history lesson, to say that all Christians are<br/>
embracing this book and enforcing it on their children is a bit of a<br/>
stretch.  If you want to share propaganda regarding the Religious Right and<br/>
the current President of the United States is this the appropriate place to<br/>
do so??<br/>
I would be interested to know where the information came from that the<br/>
&quot;Religious Right&quot; were forcing this book,&quot;Elsie&quot; on malleable children.  Is<br/>
this something the writer has observed first hand?  Has she really<br/>
researched her information? Talked with parents that are using this material<br/>
to see in what manner the book is used for?  <br/>
I personally have never heard of the Elsie books till this post.  I am a<br/>
Christian.  I support the current President of the United States.  I am not<br/>
forcing my children to read &quot;Elsie&quot; books or to practice any of the<br/>
questionable behaviors that the writer has listed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761858486">I had commented on this list earlier about sexism in literature from the <br/>
1950&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
If the books are listed on ANY reading lists sold to or used by <br/>
homeschoolers, her comments are valid.  A homeschooler on a list like this <br/>
once said her family used no books written past the 19th century (referring <br/>
to children&#39;s literature) because they wanted to instill 19th century values <br/>
in their children.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone said &quot;all Christians,&quot; but there are truly many who are <br/>
of that bent.  Little House on the Prairie has a curriculum to go with it.  <br/>
There are (or used to be, I don&#39;t know if the programs are still in use) <br/>
Christian families who use a different curriculum for girls and boys.  Same <br/>
company, a female curriculum for homeschoolrs, and another for males.  It is <br/>
very Christian-oriented (if it&#39;s still there).  The girls&#39; was called Pearl <br/>
of Great Price, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Because to outsiders all homeschoolers share the same general reputation and <br/>
are painted with the same social and statistical brushes, I think more <br/>
homeschoolers should know about the range of belief and practice which is out <br/>
there.  If it hurts us to know, it hurts us (and others) more NOT to know, if <br/>
we end up in conversations where we are informed by people who aren&#39;t even <br/>
homeschooling about things which turn out to be true.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t personally like to be blindsided.  I like to say, &quot;Yes, I know...&quot; <br/>
and have a response thought out.  Sometimes it&#39;s just &quot;Not all homeschoolers <br/>
are that way.&quot;  But if I say &quot;I&#39;m a homeschooler, and I don&#39;t do that&quot; it <br/>
doesn&#39;t change the fact that other homeschoolers do [whatever it is].<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-336562010">very interesting post Sandra. I had recently heard of the Elsie Dinsmore books through a fundamentalist christian catalog I get. I have never read one and now I will have to just to see what she is talking about. I love old books, but read them with the understanding of the context they come from. A small child may not have the maturity to do so, and I can see how a lot of prejudices could be assimilated by imitating a heroine like Elsie. I am a christian who is often disgusted with how easily some christians blindly follow others opinions and never question things out for themselves.<br/>

  I received this yesterday from a friend&#39;s friend.  Although she lives in <br/>
  Albuquerque, we&#39;ve never met! &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s close friends with a family I know <br/>
  well in Bonfield, Ontario.  I find that really amusing, but I&#39;m glad to be <br/>
  one of her e-mail pals, and she&#39;s a really great writer.<br/>
<br/>
  I asked her permission to send this to this list, and she wrote &lt;&lt;Share all <br/>
  you want. I knew you are a home schooler who doesn&#39;t want to marry off her 12 <br/>
  year old to a patriarch. That is why I e-mailed you. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  All below this line is by Sharon Karpinski, of Albuquerque, who&#39;s not a <br/>
  homeschooler but who is a fine writer and home-philosopher of the highest <br/>
  nature &lt;bwg&gt;:<br/>
<br/>
  --------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
  Last week I found six Elsie Dinsmore books at a store off Central Avenue. I<br/>
<br/>
  immediately bought all that weren&#39;t duplicates to mine even though I paid<br/>
<br/>
  $1. apiece for the last ones I laid hands on (in Washburn, Wisconsin 15<br/>
<br/>
  years ago) and these had escalated to $14.   &quot;You were lucky to get so<br/>
<br/>
  many,&quot; the bookstore owner said. &quot; These just came in. They are very<br/>
<br/>
  popular. They just fly off the shelves once I put them on my mailing<br/>
<br/>
  lists.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I was amazed since, for many years, I was the only person I knew who was<br/>
<br/>
  intimately acquainted with Elsie---or even acquainted at all. My<br/>
<br/>
  grandmother, a huge fan in her youth (we are now back to around 1906)  had<br/>
<br/>
  read every single Elsie book as a child. Since no one in my family ever<br/>
<br/>
  threw out a book, I&#39;d read several a good fifty years after they&#39;d gone out<br/>
<br/>
  of print.  Curiosity piqued, I went to the Net to find 2,110 entries for<br/>
<br/>
  Elsie. I discovered, to my horror, that Elsie is being pushed by Christian<br/>
<br/>
  Fundamentalists as achild,<br/>
<br/>
  exemplifies the idea that character counts in the face of tribulation. The<br/>
<br/>
  books accurately picture 19th century life.&quot;  It turns out that the<br/>
<br/>
  Fundamentalist press has even reprinted the first four Elsie books. The<br/>
<br/>
  first is now titled Elsie, the Endless Wait  (this is when she is pilloried<br/>
<br/>
  by her cousins while longing for her absent father). There is even a line<br/>
<br/>
  of Elsie dolls illustrating pertinent moments in the stories.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  A bit of literary background: The Elsie Dinsmore series, written by Martha<br/>
<br/>
  Finlay) was quite possibly the first set of &quot;girls&quot; books. The Dodd Company<br/>
<br/>
  (before Meade came along) published the first story in 1868. This antedates<br/>
<br/>
  even Little Women though Louisa was a far better writer. In their day,<br/>
<br/>
  which lasted about fifty years, Elsie sold hugely. There were eventually<br/>
<br/>
  perhaps twenty five or thirty books and the story was  terminated only<br/>
<br/>
  because Finlay died.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Despite the fact that I dote on Elsie, I am horrified that defenseless<br/>
<br/>
  Christian children are being assigned this book  because---for those of you<br/>
<br/>
  that are not Elsie fans---Elsie is NOT Nancy Drew in a hoopskirt . A brief<br/>
<br/>
  summary:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Elsie is a Southern heiress who came to be because her father and mother<br/>
<br/>
  fell in love and eloped when he was seventeen and she was fifteen. Elsie&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
  mother died in childbirth at 16. Her father Horace, horrified, took off for<br/>
<br/>
  Europe leaving Elsie to be raised by Mrs. Murray, a Scotch-Presyterian<br/>
<br/>
  housekeeper and Chloe, Elsie&#39;s beloved black Mammie, who adores all white<br/>
<br/>
  folk but particularly adores Elsie. When Mrs. Murray kicks the bucket,<br/>
<br/>
  Elsie is sent to live with her paternal Grandfather and his second wife, a<br/>
<br/>
  social climber with a passel of awful children, most notably Enna, who<br/>
<br/>
  abuses Elsie daily. The story opens as Horace arrives home from Europe when<br/>
<br/>
  Elsie is eight. He cannot stand the sight of her, because she looks exactly<br/>
<br/>
  like his dead wife, and he cannot stand listening to her either, because<br/>
<br/>
  she is a devout Christian who won&#39;t play secular songs on Sunday or wear<br/>
<br/>
  new clothes to church because they would take her mind off worship in God&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
  house. Elsie falls off piano benches, passes into brain fever and suffers<br/>
<br/>
  other horrors too numerous to mention until such a time as she convinces<br/>
<br/>
  her father to be saved too. Now mind you, all of the above is not a world<br/>
<br/>
  that I embrace but although narrowly righteous, it&#39;s not  deviant. What IS<br/>
<br/>
  horrifying about the assignment of these books to unknowing children is<br/>
<br/>
  that the following elements ALSO figure in Elsie&#39;s perennial saga:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  1. Elsie owns three hundred slaves in her own name and, in book four, buys<br/>
<br/>
  several more. She always calls them &quot;my people&quot; as in,&quot; my possessions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  2. All the black people in the book (with the exception of Chloe&#39;s &quot;unruly<br/>
<br/>
  buck husband&quot; who is sold away from her) love the Massa and give thanks<br/>
<br/>
  practically daily for their servitude. Chloe&#39;s husband, in his old age,<br/>
<br/>
  sees the light of God and becomes a willing slave once more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  3. Elsie&#39;s relationship with her father is most peculiar, involving as it<br/>
<br/>
  does many mouth-to-mouth kisses and caresses. She strokes him regularly and<br/>
<br/>
  speaks of her adoration. He returns it. Every day she sits on his lap as he<br/>
<br/>
  instructs her. This goes on until she is fifteen or so. She does nothing<br/>
<br/>
  without his permission, because to obey one&#39;s parents is absolute filial<br/>
<br/>
  duty,  even unto her 25th year. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  4. After a brief interlude with a fortune hunter in Book 3 (a man that<br/>
<br/>
  Horace quickly dispatches to the state pen), Elsie marries her father&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
  best friend, who is 20 years older than she is and whom she has known since<br/>
<br/>
  she was eight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  It is for reasons 3 and 4 that I, while in high school, wrote an essay<br/>
<br/>
  called &quot;Elsie Dinsmore Meets Sigmund Freud.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  5. Elsie is not an inclusive Christian. In books one and two she is<br/>
<br/>
  threatened with convent school. She knows this is the end for her because<br/>
<br/>
  what the priests and nuns do in those places is unspeakable. Mrs. Murray,<br/>
<br/>
  her old housekeeper, told her all about it. At the very least she will be<br/>
<br/>
  locked away and tortured until she converts. Papists are condemned in<br/>
<br/>
  several of the following books too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  6. Anti-semitism crops up in Book 5, &quot;Elsie&#39;s Children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  7. The KKK is a force for good, Cousin Enna becomes a Confederate spy and<br/>
<br/>
  the Dinsmore darkies (all of whom speak perfect Jim Crow and Zip Coon)<br/>
<br/>
  resist freedom, lingering into the 1890&#39;s as &quot;servants&quot; whose wages are<br/>
<br/>
  never mentioned. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  8.Not to misrepresent things: Elsie is a model slaveowner. She forbids<br/>
<br/>
  flogging, substituting loss of privileges and imprisonment on bread and<br/>
<br/>
  water as punishments for failure to work. She lectures her New England<br/>
<br/>
  overseer about how one must allow for the indolent nature of the black folk<br/>
<br/>
  and arranges the services of a chaplain for &quot;her people.&quot; Her children are<br/>
<br/>
  unfailingly thoughtful to their slave playmates, teaching them that when<br/>
<br/>
  they go to heaven, they will turn white like their masters.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  9. Did I mention that Elsie, besides being a bigot, is an insufferable<br/>
<br/>
  prig?  She  suffers nervous prostrations and is given to dialogue like,<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Are you vexed with me, Papa?&quot; Following this line,  she frequently kneels<br/>
<br/>
  at his feet.  Later, when she is a woman, Elsie says &quot;Unhand me this<br/>
<br/>
  instant, sir!&quot; and the like.  Naturally, she is utterly beautiful and<br/>
<br/>
  worshipped by all. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I love Elsie---the way I love to study poisonous reptiles. As a role model<br/>
<br/>
  OR as history OR as as example of good English composition, Elsie is a<br/>
<br/>
  disaster. That she is now being touted as a Christian example to malleable<br/>
<br/>
  children indicates what the Fundamentalist Right may be all about, a<br/>
<br/>
  strange world of racial privilege, religious intolerance and child<br/>
<br/>
  marriage. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Our current president is supported by the religious right who consider him<br/>
<br/>
  one of their own. I worry. sk<br/>

 and an excerpt from the first page:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have been over and over it,&quot; replied the little girl in a tone of <br/>
despondency, &quot;and still there are two figures that will not come right.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do you know they are not right, little puss?&quot; shaking her curls as he <br/>
spoke. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh! please, Arthur, don&#39;t pull my hair. I have the answer—that&#39;s the way I <br/>
know.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, then, why don&#39;t you just set the figures down. I would.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh! no, indeed; that would not be honest.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pooh! nonsense! nobody would be the wiser, nor the poorer.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, but it would be just like telling a lie. But I can never get it right <br/>
while you are bothering me so,&quot; said Elsie, laying her slate aside in <br/>
despair. Then taking out her geography, she began studying most diligently. <br/>
But Arthur continued his persecutions tickling her, pulling her hair, <br/>
twitching the book out of her band, and talking almost incessantly, making <br/>
remarks, and asking questions; till at last Elsie said, as if just ready to <br/>
cry, <br/>
&quot;Indeed, Arthur, if you don&#39;t let me alone, I shall never be able to get my <br/>
lessons.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Go away then; take your book out on the veranda, and learn your lessons <br/>
there,&quot; said Louise. &quot;I&#39;ll call you when Miss Day comes.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh! no, Louise, I cannot do that, because it would be disobedience,&quot; replied <br/>
Elsie, taking out her writing materials. <br/>
<br/>
Arthur stood over her criticising every letter she made, and finally jogged <br/>
her elbow in such a way as to cause her to drop all the ink in her pen upon <br/>
the paper, making quite a large blot. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh!&quot; cried the little girl, bursting into tears, &quot;now I shall lose my ride, <br/>
for Miss Day will not let me go; and I was so anxious to see all those <br/>
beautiful flowers.&quot; Arthur, who was really not very vicious, felt some <br/>
compunction when he saw the mischief he had done.</div>

  While I appreciate the history lesson, to say that all Christians are<br/>
  embracing this book and enforcing it on their children is a bit of a<br/>
  stretch.  If you want to share propaganda regarding the Religious Right and<br/>
  the current President of the United States is this the appropriate place to<br/>
  do so??<br/>
  I would be interested to know where the information came from that the<br/>
  &quot;Religious Right&quot; were forcing this book,&quot;Elsie&quot; on malleable children.  Is<br/>
  this something the writer has observed first hand?  Has she really<br/>
  researched her information? Talked with parents that are using this material<br/>
  to see in what manner the book is used for?  <br/>
  I personally have never heard of the Elsie books till this post.  I am a<br/>
  Christian.  I support the current President of the United States.  I am not<br/>
  forcing my children to read &quot;Elsie&quot; books or to practice any of the<br/>
  questionable behaviors that the writer has listed.<br/>

  &gt;  first is now titled Elsie, the Endless Wait  (this is when she is<br/>
  pilloried<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  by her cousins while longing for her absent father). There is even a line<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  of Elsie dolls illustrating pertinent moments in the stories.<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  A bit of literary background: The Elsie Dinsmore series, written by<br/>
  Martha<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  Finlay) was quite possibly the first set of &quot;girls&quot; books. The Dodd<br/>
  Company<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  (before Meade came along) published the first story in 1868. This<br/>
  antedates<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  even Little Women though Louisa was a far better writer. In their day,<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  which lasted about fifty years, Elsie sold hugely. There were eventually<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  perhaps twenty five or thirty books and the story was  terminated only<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  because Finlay died.<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  Despite the fact that I dote on Elsie, I am horrified that defenseless<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  Christian children are being assigned this book  because---for those of<br/>
  you<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  that are not Elsie fans---Elsie is NOT Nancy Drew in a hoopskirt . A<br/>
  brief<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  summary:<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  Elsie is a Southern heiress who came to be because her father and mother<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  fell in love and eloped when he was seventeen and she was fifteen.<br/>
  Elsie&#39;s<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  mother died in childbirth at 16. Her father Horace, horrified, took off<br/>
  for<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  Europe leaving Elsie to be raised by Mrs. Murray, a Scotch-Presyterian<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  housekeeper and Chloe, Elsie&#39;s beloved black Mammie, who adores all white<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  folk but particularly adores Elsie. When Mrs. Murray kicks the bucket,<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  Elsie is sent to live with her paternal Grandfather and his second wife,<br/>
  a<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  social climber with a passel of awful children, most notably Enna, who<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  abuses Elsie daily. The story opens as Horace arrives home from Europe<br/>
  when<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  Elsie is eight. He cannot stand the sight of her, because she looks<br/>
  exactly<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  like his dead wife, and he cannot stand listening to her either, because<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  she is a devout Christian who won&#39;t play secular songs on Sunday or wear<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  new clothes to church because they would take her mind off worship in<br/>
  God&#39;s<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  house. Elsie falls off piano benches, passes into brain fever and suffers<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  other horrors too numerous to mention until such a time as she convinces<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  her father to be saved too. Now mind you, all of the above is not a world<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  that I embrace but although narrowly righteous, it&#39;s not  deviant. What<br/>
  IS<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  horrifying about the assignment of these books to unknowing children is<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  that the following elements ALSO figure in Elsie&#39;s perennial saga:<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  1. Elsie owns three hundred slaves in her own name and, in book four,<br/>
  buys<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  several more. She always calls them &quot;my people&quot; as in,&quot; my possessions.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  2. All the black people in the book (with the exception of Chloe&#39;s<br/>
  &quot;unruly<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  buck husband&quot; who is sold away from her) love the Massa and give thanks<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  practically daily for their servitude. Chloe&#39;s husband, in his old age,<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  sees the light of God and becomes a willing slave once more.<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  3. Elsie&#39;s relationship with her father is most peculiar, involving as it<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  does many mouth-to-mouth kisses and caresses. She strokes him regularly<br/>
  and<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  speaks of her adoration. He returns it. Every day she sits on his lap as<br/>
  he<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  instructs her. This goes on until she is fifteen or so. She does nothing<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  without his permission, because to obey one&#39;s parents is absolute filial<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  duty,  even unto her 25th year. <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  4. After a brief interlude with a fortune hunter in Book 3 (a man that<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  Horace quickly dispatches to the state pen), Elsie marries her father&#39;s<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  best friend, who is 20 years older than she is and whom she has known<br/>
  since<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  she was eight.<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  It is for reasons 3 and 4 that I, while in high school, wrote an essay<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  called &quot;Elsie Dinsmore Meets Sigmund Freud.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  5. Elsie is not an inclusive Christian. In books one and two she is<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  threatened with convent school. She knows this is the end for her because<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  what the priests and nuns do in those places is unspeakable. Mrs. Murray,<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  her old housekeeper, told her all about it. At the very least she will be<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  locked away and tortured until she converts. Papists are condemned in<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  several of the following books too.<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  6. Anti-semitism crops up in Book 5, &quot;Elsie&#39;s Children.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  7. The KKK is a force for good, Cousin Enna becomes a Confederate spy and<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  the Dinsmore darkies (all of whom speak perfect Jim Crow and Zip Coon)<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  resist freedom, lingering into the 1890&#39;s as &quot;servants&quot; whose wages are<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  never mentioned. <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  8.Not to misrepresent things: Elsie is a model slaveowner. She forbids<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  flogging, substituting loss of privileges and imprisonment on bread and<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  water as punishments for failure to work. She lectures her New England<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  overseer about how one must allow for the indolent nature of the black<br/>
  folk<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  and arranges the services of a chaplain for &quot;her people.&quot; Her children<br/>
  are<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  unfailingly thoughtful to their slave playmates, teaching them that when<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  they go to heaven, they will turn white like their masters.  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  9. Did I mention that Elsie, besides being a bigot, is an insufferable<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  prig?  She  suffers nervous prostrations and is given to dialogue like,<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  &quot;Are you vexed with me, Papa?&quot; Following this line,  she frequently<br/>
  kneels<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  at his feet.  Later, when she is a woman, Elsie says &quot;Unhand me this<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  instant, sir!&quot; and the like.  Naturally, she is utterly beautiful and<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  worshipped by all. <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  I love Elsie---the way I love to study poisonous reptiles. As a role<br/>
  model<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  OR as history OR as as example of good English composition, Elsie is a<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  disaster. That she is now being touted as a Christian example to<br/>
  malleable<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  children indicates what the Fundamentalist Right may be all about, a<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  strange world of racial privilege, religious intolerance and child<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  marriage. <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  Our current president is supported by the religious right who consider<br/>
  him<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt;  one of their own. I worry. sk<br/>

  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hshangout.com/elsie.html">http://www.hshangout.com/elsie.html</a><br/>
  and an excerpt from the first page:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I have been over and over it,&quot; replied the little girl in a tone of <br/>
  despondency, &quot;and still there are two figures that will not come right.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;How do you know they are not right, little puss?&quot; shaking her curls as he <br/>
  spoke. <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Oh! please, Arthur, don&#39;t pull my hair. I have the answer—that&#39;s the way I <br/>
  know.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Well, then, why don&#39;t you just set the figures down. I would.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Oh! no, indeed; that would not be honest.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Pooh! nonsense! nobody would be the wiser, nor the poorer.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;No, but it would be just like telling a lie. But I can never get it right <br/>
  while you are bothering me so,&quot; said Elsie, laying her slate aside in <br/>
  despair. Then taking out her geography, she began studying most diligently. <br/>
  But Arthur continued his persecutions tickling her, pulling her hair, <br/>
  twitching the book out of her band, and talking almost incessantly, making <br/>
  remarks, and asking questions; till at last Elsie said, as if just ready to <br/>
  cry, <br/>
  &quot;Indeed, Arthur, if you don&#39;t let me alone, I shall never be able to get my <br/>
  lessons.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Go away then; take your book out on the veranda, and learn your lessons <br/>
  there,&quot; said Louise. &quot;I&#39;ll call you when Miss Day comes.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Oh! no, Louise, I cannot do that, because it would be disobedience,&quot; replied <br/>
  Elsie, taking out her writing materials. <br/>
<br/>
  Arthur stood over her criticising every letter she made, and finally jogged <br/>
  her elbow in such a way as to cause her to drop all the ink in her pen upon <br/>
  the paper, making quite a large blot. <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Oh!&quot; cried the little girl, bursting into tears, &quot;now I shall lose my ride, <br/>
  for Miss Day will not let me go; and I was so anxious to see all those <br/>
  beautiful flowers.&quot; Arthur, who was really not very vicious, felt some <br/>
  compunction when he saw the mischief he had done. <br/>

<br/>
About that anti-review, their objections is that it&#39;s not stern enough and <br/>
the child is being supported (by the author) in having thought for herself!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-Setting the Sabbath question aside, we must ask ourselves if children <br/>
should obey their parents or decide right and wrong for themselves. Miss <br/>
Finley bolsters the thought in the reader’s mind that the child should <br/>
decide. Now, if an unbelieving parent is commanding a child to commit <br/>
adultery, murder, incest, or some other serious ill, a child might know to do <br/>
right. However, in laying down the fine points of Christian practice, young <br/>
children are not likely to be doctrinal experts. In these matters, if the <br/>
Bible teaches women to listen and be under the authority of their <br/>
husbands. Certainly children should follow suit. If women are easily <br/>
deceiveF䅃䔽≇敮敶愢⁆䅍䥌夽十乓卅剉䘾-=-<br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s the reviewer, about an incident in which Elsie refused to read <br/>
secular texts to her dying non-Christian father on the Sabbath; reviewer <br/>
seems I guess to think she should have, since it was her father.)<br/>
<br/>
And the insult about women being easily decieved is extra interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-There is a danger for children to have such an independent spirit <br/>
concerning spiritual matters. For instance, suppose the parents are against <br/>
Christian rock music, but the children see nothing wrong with it, and <br/>
therefore, according to Elsie, can follow their own spiritual convictions <br/>
concerning music. However, it is presumable that eight-year-old children are <br/>
not likely to be wiser than their parents in these matters.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I guess reading Elsie Dinsmore can speak over the years (in her newly edited <br/>
voice) to cause children to want Christian rock music.  I guess it&#39;s more <br/>
abominable than anyone ever thought.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There is also a terrible reference to the &quot;rod&quot; on page 94 of book two. It <br/>
is considered an ignominious and revolting punishment. Also, as we can see, <br/>
if Elsie had been biblically reprimanded for her disobedience, an <br/>
eight-year-old’s continuing battle of wills with her father would not have <br/>
developed into a melodrama spanning two entire books, and which the author <br/>
Christianizes by culminating it with a confession of faith on the father’s <br/>
part. Oh, what we can’t blame on God in fiction!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh no.  A 19th century book critical of &quot;the rod&quot; which might cause <br/>
unhappiness in children on which rods are used in the 21st century!?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That sucks.<br/>
That powerful sucks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What will THE family of THIS Christian father be compelled to read for <br/>
inspirational fiction?<br/>

-=-Oh, and by the way, Mr. Travilla had wanted the obedience vow removed from <br/>
their marriage ceremony because he never intended that dear Elsie should ever <br/>
be required to obey him, but should only do those things she wanted to do. So <br/>
we see that Miss Finley’s outspoken adherence to the Word of God extends only <br/>
into areas of her own preference. Though Elsie is adamant about Sabbath <br/>
issues and her own perceived code of Christianity, her readers seem to be <br/>
continually learning confusing ideas about obeying parents, and now husbands <br/>
also. Authors like Miss Finley and Mrs. Wilder of the Little House on the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642952568">wow and they call us unschoolers radical. Obey your husband to death, no matter what... I don&#39;t think that is exactly what God intended. I have known too many women who were abused and didn&#39;t get help because they had to obey their husbands and the church turned their back on them. The other side of this scripture says a husband is to love his wife as the Lord loved the church and gave himself up for her. Most abusers totally omit this half of the scripture. I obey my husband, but my husband is not abusive. He on the other hand will listen to me when I don&#39;t agree and sometimes changes his mind. This is a relationship, not a power trip.<br/>
