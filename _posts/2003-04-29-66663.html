<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213728969">This was forwarded to me and I thought I&#39;d pass it along.  My daughter <br/>
really enjoys these books, especially as reference when she sees something <br/>
interesting related on tv.  She&#39;s really in to history right now!  Maybe <br/>
some of you could use these!!<br/>

I just found Joy Hakim&#39;s complete 10 volume *hardcover* A History of US<br/>
set<br/>
at 73% off!<br/>
<br/>
The most recent update is the 3rd edition, April 2003 (it brings the<br/>
series<br/>
up-to-date to include September 11th and events since then) so<br/>
Amazon.com<br/>
is selling the 2nd edition sets at an incredible 73% off! Quantities are<br/>
limited and may sell out very quickly!<br/>
<br/>
The list price on this 2nd edition set is $219.45 and Amazon is now<br/>
selling<br/>
it for $58.16 plus $6.88 for shipping!<br/>
