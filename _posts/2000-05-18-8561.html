<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928236519">Do you consider yourself an unschooler? Are you willing to let a reporter<br/>
visit you to find out what a typical day is like? If so, your 15 minutes of<br/>
fame may be at hand.<br/>
<br/>
I have been talking with Peter Kilvorn of the New York Times. He is<br/>
intrigued by the idea of unschooling and would like to find out more for an<br/>
article he is writing. What he really wants to do is to spend some time with<br/>
a family to see what kind of things go on during a &quot;typical&quot; day. I&#39;ve<br/>
explained to him that there is no such thing as a typical unschooler or a<br/>
typical unschooling day, but he is hoping to catch one of those &quot;aha!&quot;<br/>
moments when a kid gets excited by something they are doing or finally<br/>
catches on to something they have been trying to understand.<br/>
<br/>
He assures me that he is not out to blast unschoolers but just wants to<br/>
present unschooling as an interesting alternative to other learning<br/>
approaches.<br/>
<br/>
Peter Kilvorn is in the Washington D.C. Bureau of the New York Times, but is<br/>
willing to travel outside the area if necessary. If you would like to<br/>
contact him for more information or to offer your family for an interview,<br/>
you can call him at (202) 862-0361, or e-mail him at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:PeKilv@...">PeKilv@...</a><br/>
<br/>
He is interested in doing something soon, so please do not respond to this<br/>
after May 27, 2000. Also, he is only interested in unschoolers, NOT<br/>
homeshoolers in general, so don&#39;t respond unless you consider yourself an<br/>
unschooler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536385776">A few weeks ago I asked if any of you were interested in being interviewed<br/>
by Peter Kilborn for a New York Times article on unschooling. By now, most<br/>
of you have seen the resulting article<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/052400home-edu.html?Partner)">http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/052400home-edu.html?Partner)</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I now have an opportunity for families who are willing to be filmed for a<br/>
program on homeschooling by &quot;Extra&quot; - a half hour newsmagazine show that<br/>
airs all over the country on different networks at various times. Farrell<br/>
Roth is looking for a homeschooling family willing to invite a few people<br/>
(producer, camera man, sound man, etc) to spend 4 or 5 hours with them to<br/>
film some of their homeschooling activities. She seems to be interested in<br/>
the idea of unschooling, but the family to be filmed does not have to be an<br/>
unschooling family. They do not pay for interviews and hope to interview<br/>
both parents and the children.<br/>
<br/>
Farrell indicates they have readily available production crews for Maryland,<br/>
New York and surrounding states, and the Los Angeles area, but they are<br/>
willing to come to families in any area.<br/>
<br/>
They are interested in doing something soon, so let her know right away if<br/>
your are interested. Feel free to pass this message on to anyone you think<br/>
may be interested, but please include the entire message and ask that they<br/>
not respond after Friday, June 2, 2000.<br/>
<br/>
You can reach her by phone at (212) 506-4938 or by e-mail at<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182402840">Boy, you guys are fast! Farrell Roth has contacted me to say she got a bunch<br/>
of responses and already has the families she needs for filming.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s asked that we please not send her any more responses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366119713">If you missed the last opportunity I mentioned for a chance to be<br/>
interviewed on television, here&#39;s another one. The Washington, DC based<br/>
correspondent of a Norwegian Television program is very interested in<br/>
putting together a tv story on unschooling. This would be for broadcast in<br/>
Norway. They want to film the children going about daily activities and they<br/>
want to interview the parents and children.<br/>
<br/>
This has a few more requirements than the last opportunity. The family needs<br/>
to be within about 1 hour&#39;s drive from DC, and the filming would be done on<br/>
Wednesday or Thursday of next week (May 31, 2000 or June 1, 2000).<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, please contact Kelli Taylor right away. Her phone<br/>
number is 703-241-7496, or you can e-mail her at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Kellitaylor@...">Kellitaylor@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Feel free to pass this on to any families you think might be interested.<br/>
Just be sure to let them know that the deadline for filming is June 1, 2000<br/>
