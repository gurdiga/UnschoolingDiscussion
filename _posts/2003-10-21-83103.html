AOL today...It happened after we switched to 9.0.  Must be a glitch.  I think <br/>
we&#39;ll go back to 8.0.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977467885">The list is REALLY slow right now. I wonder if it&#39;s genuinely slow, <br/>
or if lots of emails are not making it to post.<br/>
<br/>
I read from the website, and have found it slow for the past about <br/>
four days (unprecedented in my experience w/this list).<br/>

I&#39;ve had the same trouble.  With my lists that I like to stay current on, I <br/>
have to check at the group&#39;s web site for messages.   I have missed quite a few <br/>
in my mailbox.. my own replies as well as other members posts.    I havent <br/>
recieved many posts from this list, but I haven&#39;t checked at the group site to <br/>
see if I missed any..<br/>

We are bouncing! And AOL tech help told me there were no complaints of the <br/>
same nature as mine! They did say they would resolve the problem within 24 to 48 <br/>
hours. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

I talked to the *live help* at AOL Tuesday nite.  She thought it was my spam <br/>
block, but we checked and that&#39;s not it.  A report was sent to the *powers <br/>
that be* and today I seem to have all my mail (or at least a lot more than the <br/>
past week!)<br/>

Its nice to feel &quot;in touch&quot; again.  As a fairly new unschooler in a really <br/>
conservative<br/>
&quot;school-at-home&quot; homeschooling area, the support I feel from just reading <br/>
these e-mails and the message boards has been both enlightening and empowering.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted much because I&#39;m still in the reading, reading, reading <br/>
stage.  I mostly continue to just be in awe of all the postive changes in my <br/>
children and our family since we embraced unschooling.  There is so much wisdom as <br/>
well as some superb writing being shared by those of you who post on both this <br/>
discussion group and the message boards. <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say Thanks!<br/>
