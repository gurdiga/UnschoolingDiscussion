The International Children&#39;s Conference on the Environment, which is being <br/>
held in cooperation with the United Nations Environment Programme, is still <br/>
looking for 10-12 year olds to come to the conference, May 21-25 in <br/>
Victoria. I wonder if you could put the word out to your contacts <br/>
internationally.<br/>
