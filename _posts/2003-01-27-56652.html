Well biking is my favorite part of the triathlon, and what I&#39;m best at.<br/>
I can see continuing the bike part after I decide to move on from triathlon, <br/>
definitely!<br/>
I have a mountain bike for those trails up at the University and it also fits <br/>
the purpose your hybrid does for quick jaunts to the store or whatever.<br/>
My awesome bike is my Giant, I got the OCR2 with all Ultegra components!!  <br/>
ooh yeah.<br/>
I can jam on that bike. <br/>

bike 40 miles or even 10... shows you what I know about biking!<br/>
<br/>
But if you are talking about an activity you do as an adult on your own or <br/>
with your spouse, then it can&#39;t be compared to the family meal time.  Not the <br/>

Now we are going to have to figure out how we will get our bikes down there,    maybe we will drive.<br/>
 <br/>
We are bikers too,  not 30 or 40 miles at a time or anything but maybe 10 or so,  I&#39;m also excited that we are almost to riding all of our own!   Bye, bye  trailer and  burley!   My bike is so light after pulling something for so many years!<br/>

of four we had 10 bikes, a Burley trailer and the Burley Piccolo <br/>
(tandem attachment for kids). Pretty ridiculous, eh? But I&#39;m with <br/>
you, I have my street bike, my road bike, and my triathlon bike <br/>
(except I drove into the garage with that one on my roof rack this <br/>
summer, ouch!). I&#39;d like a nice mountain bike too, and now I have to <br/>
replace my triathlon bike. Heading up to the Seattle bike show in <br/>
March for a little vacation and drooling over titanium ;-)<br/>
And then there&#39;s not only the bikes, but all the cool gear out these <br/>
days...<br/>

I know what you mean. Luckily we live in Eugene, OR (aka Bike <br/>
Central) and you see all kinds of people on all kinds of bikes here <br/>
(in all kinds of clothes as well!). I thought some day I&#39;d do a photo <br/>
essay on the things I&#39;ve seen people carrying on bikes and in <br/>
trailers here (cats, dogs, once saw a guy riding to the airport in a <br/>
3 piece suit towing his suitcase on a bunjy cord behind his bike, and <br/>
once saw a whole tree sticking out of a Burley trailer!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our whole family bikes together. Most of the year it&#39;s our primary <br/>
mode of transport as well, so we get to spend a lot of time together <br/>
on bikes. We often take picnics down the bike trail by the river in <br/>
the summertime. With the Burley trailer, you can just stuff <br/>
everything in the back and go! Doesn&#39;t take any time at all. The <br/>
thing hauls over a 100 pounds! We can split the kids up and one takes <br/>
the oldest on the tandem and the other hauls the youngest in the <br/>
Burley (for longer distances), or to travel light we can put the <br/>
youngest in the seat and the oldest rides his own bike (for shorter <br/>
distances). If it&#39;s just me and the kids, I can haul the Burley <br/>
behind the tandem - what a train!<br/>
<br/>
The thing I like best about biking is that we get a lot of time to <br/>
talk, and we get to interact with the world as it goes by - smelling <br/>
the flowers together, so to speak. For us, it&#39;s a great way to spend <br/>
time together while being active, which we all love and need. For us <br/>
it works, but that doesn&#39;t mean I think it&#39;s the best thing for <br/>
everyone, just one of the many ways we get to spend time as a family <br/>
and enjoy each other&#39;s company. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have my sympathies.<br/>
The MS causes muscle weakness and pain so sometimes I have to walk with a stick. So far I&#39;ve never needed a wheelchair. MS comes and goes and at the moment is in remission apart from numb fingertips. As<br/>
for the fibro, some of the symptons are similar but its biggest characteristic is pain. Cycling is my way of taking control of my body and making it do stuff. If I gave in to the pain I&#39;d spend all day<br/>
on the couch feeling worse. There are some days when its too painful to move so those days are video or computer days for me. There are days when 5 miles on the bike isa struggle and I feel fustrated<br/>
and angry that I have this disease.<br/>
<br/>
I really feel for you with chronic fatigue as well. My neuro says I might develop it and on days when I feel I can hardly move and am so tired I could sleep all day  I give myself nightmares that its<br/>
arrived. But so far fingers crossed.<br/>
<br/>
The MS has been in remission for a year at the moment which is the longest I&#39;ve ever gone. Weird really considering how stressed and depressed I feel.<br/>
Hope you get more good days that bad days Tia.<br/>
