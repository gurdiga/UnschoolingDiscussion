<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824639513"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I believe that he asks for ice cream because he really wants it, and not <br/>
&gt;&gt;because he thinks the question bugs me.  In fact, the question doesn&#39;t bug <br/>
&gt;&gt;me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So then I&#39;m curious. What would be the problem with him having it everyday? <br/>
Why does he need to throw a tantrum because you said no? (That was your <br/>
original post, I think.) If the question doesn&#39;t bother you, is it the <br/>
eating of ice cream for breakfast rather than desert that bothers you? The <br/>
eating of ice cream rather than the breakfast you&#39;ve already prepared? I&#39;m <br/>
not trying to start an argument BTW. I&#39;m really interested in your answers <br/>
and experiences. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I&#39;m not Olivia or a TCSer (too rigid, and at times absurd for <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;me),but that doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t found some value in thinking outside <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the box on some of my formerlly held parenting beliefs. :o)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Yeah, me too.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool! :o) Then let&#39;s keep on with this part of the discussion.<br/>
