<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980561685">Just a question: what is dd, dh and so on? I simply don&#39;t know.  I assume if <br/>
I don&#39;t know, then surely there are at least a few others who don&#39;t.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

You can do a Google search for e-mail abbreviations or emoticons and find<br/>
a list of them.  There are some here:<br/>

dd is dear daughter. <br/>
dh is dear husband (or dastardly, or something else depending on your<br/>
mood and your husband)<br/>
ds is dear son.<br/>
mil is mother in law.<br/>
fil is father in law.<br/>
sil is sister in law. <br/>
bil is brother in law.<br/>
tia  is thanks in advance.  That one can be confusing because there are<br/>
one or two list members named Tia. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 &lt;g&gt; means grin.<br/>
<br/>
Google around and you&#39;ll find all kinds of stuff. <br/>
