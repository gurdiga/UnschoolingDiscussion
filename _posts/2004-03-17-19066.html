<div id="ygrps-yiv-690935456">I agree about the HOP thing, if your child wants it you should try <br/>
and get if for them if possible, if not look it up online and show <br/>
your child what it includes and see if he would like to make his own <br/>
version or if he would allow allow you to work with you etc. If he <br/>
does it for awhile and backs out then that is okey too, kids need to <br/>
do things at their own pace. I also wanted to let you know about <br/>
this free online reading help place that my almost 6 yo (oh oh his <br/>
birthday is this week!!!) goes because he thinks it is sooo <br/>
wonderful, I think it&#39;s better than the reading rabbit software as <br/>
well so you could ask him if he would like for you to save the link <br/>
in his favorites so he can get to it on his own. I hope all is going <br/>
well for you! Moza<br/>
