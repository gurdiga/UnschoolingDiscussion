&gt;&quot;Yesterday.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&quot;COOL!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>cool indeed. :)  we are currently enjoying exposing our kids to all the<br/>
shows/movies/books we (dh & i) loved as kids...marveling at how<br/>
timelessly fabulous they are, including the first few seasons of peewee&#39;s<br/>
playhouse.  peewee in particular is so amusing to watch as an adult, i&#39;m<br/>
finding.  much like sesame street and the simpsons, there are so many<br/>
levels of interest involved...it&#39;s brilliant!<br/>
