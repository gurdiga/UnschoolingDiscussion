<br>Really? &nbsp;I don&#39;t get that feeling at all. &nbsp;We have only been doing this for a 
<br>couple of years, so I guess my two aren&#39;t completely screwed up yet. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;But 
<br>we have made a few changes so far and probably will make many more as we 
<br>figure things out. &nbsp;But I never get the feeling (or the response) that anyone 
<br>around here thinks we aren&#39;t doing the right thing by keeping the kids out of 
<br>ps.
<br>
<br>Hmmm. . . maybe things are getting better as far as the public&#39;s perception 
<br>of hsing. &nbsp;At least in our tiny town.
