 </span></blockquote>Yes, yes, yes.  Equally is the key to me too.  In our family, as opposed <br/>
to the family I and my Dh grew up in, we try to make decision and to do <br/>
things together. We each grew up in families were the parents were the <br/>
ultimate authority and were the children should be seen but not heard. <br/>
 It was normal for their generation, and I realize that it is still <br/>
normal for a lot of family out there.<br/>
 And yes, empowering  people  makes them powerful.  Commanding them <br/>
makes them small and dependent.  Schooling is a commanding and <br/>
controlling system.  Unschooling  perhaps imply that it is not.<br/>
But I also get the feeling (wrongly perhaps)  that some parents want to <br/>
go from one extreme to the other.  Instead of all the control in the <br/>
hand of  one or two parents they have no control, Chaos?  No commanding <br/>
system can mean that the activities are accomplished and decided by <br/>
consensus or never together.  I prefer consensus.  I find other <br/>
options... lonely.  Beside I love doing things with my sons.<br/>
Did I make more sense?   Anyway, they&#39;re waiting for me to go shovel <br/>
more snow.  Bye for now.<br/>
