<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363511991">Another  take:<br/>
Children do produce. They produce for their  schooled<br/>
parents/grandparents/teachers/neighbors/other<br/>
children/etc., and  from <br/>
a<br/>
process of binging & purging, those coveted  A&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, I think that&#39;s just the literal &quot;grading&quot; of the<br/>
products owned by  <br/>
those <br/>
parents.<br/>
&quot;My product is GradeA quality, and yours is  not.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
this brings up my favorite ps pet peeve from my own<br/>
6th grade. straight A&#39;s up until Teacher told me that<br/>
6th grade Math was all review of grades 1 thru 5 and I<br/>
decided not to do my homework, got 100% on all my<br/>
quizzes, got a &quot;0&quot; entered M thru Thurs for homework<br/>
and a &quot;100&quot; entered for quiz which supposedly tested<br/>
concepts learned (reviewed!) from the homework. I<br/>
assumed I would get an A in Math since I got all the<br/>
quizzes right every Friday, no, grade card came home<br/>
with a D. <br/>
I learned a lot from that experience about the purpose<br/>
of public school.<br/>
Also, my son got good grades in public school up until<br/>
the 4th grade, but all this was ignored by the system<br/>
in favor of my status as a single mom and the fact<br/>
that son was frequently late or absent (even in my ps<br/>
days, I had this odd idea that if he needed to curl up<br/>
with me on a rainy day, why not?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He was not producing the budget for the ps that day, I<br/>
was not producing the proper results for their<br/>
program, as I was supposed to be learning obedience to<br/>
rote behavior, not math concepts<br/>
<br/>
both of us were judged substandard as we both were<br/>
raised by countercultural parents<br/>
education had nothing to do with it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668965766"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m interested to hear how others <br/>
 </span></blockquote>answer these questions because it&#39;s coming up more now<br/>
that the kids <br/>
are getting older and joining more stuff outside the<br/>
house.  When they <br/>
see an activity they want to do, I let them be in<br/>
whatever grade the<br/>
 activity requires them to be.  For instance when my<br/>
daughter saw an <br/>
opportunity to go to a summer camp and it said you<br/>
needed to be in at <br/>
least 6th grade, that&#39;s what grade she was in, but<br/>
when she needed to be a <br/>
fifth grader in order to play on the same softball<br/>
team as her friend, <br/>
then she became a 5th grader.  I&#39;m curious to hear how<br/>
others handle <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m realizing as I&#39;m reading these very interesting<br/>
discussions that I have been unschooling all along,<br/>
even when he was at daycare, school, etc. altho&#39; I was<br/>
calling it attachment parenting since I read that term<br/>
somewhere, and calling it using my intuition or just<br/>
&quot;parent child bonding&quot; before that...<br/>
I follow my son&#39;s lead on talking to other people. at<br/>
first we were both very defensive as we had a crisis<br/>
in public school and had to leave unexpectedly and got<br/>
flack from everyone...<br/>
he is gaining in confidence the more TIME I spend with<br/>
him (even just yacking with him about his fantasy<br/>
video games)<br/>
the other day we rode our bikes downtown during school<br/>
hours. i was surprised that he wanted to go to grocery<br/>
store alone while i watched the bikes but I let him.<br/>
if I overhear him getting into a conversation with an<br/>
adult that he seems not to know how to respond to, I<br/>
may step in and say firmly & cheerfully &quot;we<br/>
homeschool.&quot; and leave it at that.<br/>
I&#39;m still working with my EX on the fact that I<br/>
homeschool, don&#39;t know that I will ever discuss<br/>
unschooling with THAT adult.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
If unschooling has nothing to do with being out of school, it becomes  <br/>
meaningless.<br/>
 <br/>
I have no doubt you were being a mindful parent and all, but &quot;unschooling  <br/>
all along&quot; can&#39;t co-exist with daycare and school.<br/>
 <br/>
How does attachment parenting even coexist with daycare?<br/>
 <br/>
Things get better fast when kids and parents can be together for long  <br/>
stretches of time without pressures.  It&#39;s cool.<br/>
