<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am angry.   Is anger not a viable emotion?  When words are twisted, <br/>
implications and accusations made without forethought or consideration for <br/>
others, it makes me angry.  I could go back and cut and paste the entire <br/>
thread of who said what.   But, it doesnt matter.   Someone could post in big <br/>
block letters.. TERESA IS A HATEFUL, VINDICITIVE PERSON WHO DOES NOT CARE <br/>
ABOUT HER CHILDRENS NEEDS .  SHE IS ARROGANT AND DISTRUPTIVE.    They could <br/>
sign their name to it and say  BECAUSE I SAID SO.  And other folks would say <br/>
it was  general statment made to &quot;help&quot; and not aimed at anyone in <br/>
particular.   I wont apologize for harming your flow of conversation.    You <br/>
are acting like middle schoolers.. Hey, we dont like you and we cant talk <br/>
about what we like, so get out of here.    Name calling and exclusion is an <br/>
immature action as well. <br/>
<br/>
AND I am angry because things are taken out of context.  <br/>
<br/>
 You sad<br/>

<br/>
I am the &quot;she&quot; that wrote the post about the pancakes!!.. It was all in one <br/>
post .. from beginning to end.  Did you happen to read it?  If you did. then <br/>
you would know that I told the whole event in one post.    Elissa replied in <br/>
one tone, then after reading Joyces response, she came back and tried to make <br/>
nice.    Where is the confusion in that???   <br/>

unschooling.<br/>

believe what you want. SO let&#39;s just stop it. Let&#39;s not telk about each other <br/>
at all. Let&#39;s let it go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Teresa...I am by no means an old timer here. I started reading somewhere around<br/>
Sept or Oct. I consider myself an extremely relaxed parent...not controlling<br/>
at all. My parents think that I do not have enough discipline with my kids<br/>
and most of my friends can not believe what I &quot;let my kids get away with&quot;. But I<br/>
came here and read posts about not controlling junk food that their kids eat,<br/>
not controlling tv their kids watch, about seeing things from the kids point of<br/>
view and not making decisions for my kids &quot;because I am the parent&quot;. I started <br/>
getting ticked off, because here I was, this great relaxed parent and they were <br/>
saying that things that I did were &quot;controlling&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that they were just pointing <br/>
out the truth...limiting junk food *is* controlling what my kids eat, limiting tv <br/>
*is* controlling what my kids watch, telling my kids that they can&#39;t have/do something <br/>
until they do what I want *is* disrespectful. Does that mean that I am some <br/>
terrible, controlling parent who never respects my children? No. There are <br/>
lots of areas where I am great at seeing my kids point of view. They do have a lot<br/>
of freedom (especially when compared with some of my friends). BUT what I have<br/>
found by listening here is that there are even more areas where I can give my kids<br/>
freedom and control and not have wild unmanageable kids. This is the only place that I<br/>
hear that...mainstream parenting is full of dire warnings, my friends and even my <br/>
family keep telling me that I *have* to do things a certain way. It is so refreshing<br/>
to hear what Joyce and Sandra and Ren and others are saying. That there is another<br/>
level of parenting where you can see yourself as a partner with your children rather<br/>
then as a gatekeeper. This one concept has improved so many of my interactions with my<br/>
kids. I do not feel that I have to take the advice given and do it 100%. But it does<br/>
get me thinking about options that I might not have thought about. There are still<br/>
areas where I control my kids more then some here, but right now it is working and<br/>
when it doesn&#39;t, I know I can do differently. But I am also not going to come on <br/>
this list and try to convince them (or anyone else) that in these areas I am right<br/>
and they are wrong. <br/>
<br/>
I can see where you can feel jumped on, you offer something that works for you and <br/>
people here say that it is not the best way. It is easy to translate that into<br/>
people saying that you are not a good parent. But that is NOT what they said.<br/>
Since then, some things have gotten personal and heated and that is a shame.<br/>
And Joyce has been doing her best to explain where the disconnects are happening,<br/>
with possible explanations as to why and handling things off list when needed. You can <br/>
believe or not believe her when she says that no one has said that you are this <br/>
horrible parent. <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents as a relative newbie who has gone from being ticked off to <br/>
learning a lot.<br/>

debates result in the best in depth posts about unschooling (just check out <br/>

Thank you Stephanie. I love a good, loud exchange of ideas as much as the next guy. But, I think it has dissolved into something far less than that here.<br/>
There is nothing like a debate to clarify your own ideas and beliefs. Mudslinging and name calling are another matter.<br/>
I&#39;ll be sticking around, I like it here.<br/>
I am afraid I&#39;m going to delete something worthwhile as I am flying past all the bickering &lt;G&gt; <br/>
