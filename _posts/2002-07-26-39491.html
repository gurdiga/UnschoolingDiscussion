&lt;&lt;  He sees pictures in his head when he reads. Much more <br/>
vivid than any image I get. When he reads a story there&#39;s an actual movie <br/>
running in his brain. It&#39;s a movie he can rewind, pause or fast forward too. <br/>
That&#39;s a HUGE strength. But it  didn&#39;t work well with phonics for him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lest anyone say that&#39;s not the right way, it&#39;s the way manual sign languages <br/>
work.   They show actions and things and ideas by whole-picture symbols.  <br/>
What gets spelled out will only be the names of people and places, <br/>
books--&quot;Proper nouns.&quot;  And similarly with reading, it&#39;s possible to read by <br/>
sight without thinking of the sounds of the words--straight from word to <br/>
idea, only having to stop and read phonetically the names of places and <br/>
people (and new words).<br/>
<br/>
When I read music I don&#39;t think of the names of the notes first.   I have to <br/>
warm up with the instrument I&#39;m using (whether a C or an F recorder) and <br/>
sometimes I have to remind my hands with an easy piece about bass clef if I <br/>
haven&#39;t played piano for a while.  But once the brain says &quot;I remember,&quot; the <br/>
verbal part of it drops out completely, and my eyes translate the music <br/>
straight to what my hands are doing.<br/>
<br/>
I can play piano and talk, if the music is familiar.<br/>
<br/>
On rhythms, I read them in phrase, as pictures.  I don&#39;t count triplets or <br/>
quarters and sixteenths.  I see the picture and if it&#39;s a familiar rhythm I <br/>
read it like reading  a sight word.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think letters when I type.  So when I play typing games which have <br/>
letters in isolation from words, I have a harder time than if the game <br/>
involves typing words.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!  I do that.  And as a horn player, I frequently have to <br/>
transpose music at sight.  I just click my brain into the new key.  If I <br/>
have to play in E, my mind just automatically fingers each note a half step <br/>
down.  If it&#39;s Eb, I&#39;ll play down a whole step, without thinking about <br/>
it.  If a piece changes key in the middle, I sometimes have to write in the <br/>
names of the first few notes, just to get me in gear.  I&#39;ll have to write <br/>
in more of the notes if it&#39;s a key I don&#39;t play in very often or there are <br/>
lots of accidentals to confuse things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I can play piano and talk, if the music is familiar.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t do that with the horn.  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m learning to do it with the <br/>
cello.  It&#39;s just that I&#39;m not used to being able to talk and play at the <br/>
same time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  And with unfamiliar rhythms I sometimes have to actually mark the <br/>
down and up beats.  That would be like sounding out unfamiliar words.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can type quite fast if I have the use of both my hands.  If I&#39;m doing <br/>
something with my left hand and trying to type with just my right hand, my <br/>
speed goes *way* down because I have to actually think about where all the <br/>
letters are.  My fingers know where they are without my thinking about them <br/>
when I use both hands.<br/>
