&gt; VERMONT HOMESCHOOLING MOM JAILED<br/>
&gt; (From a wide variety of Vermont newspapers and forwarded personal<br/>
&gt; papers)<br/>
&gt; The story begins so typically. Seventh-grader Trevor Maple was<br/>
&gt; bored at school, displayed a short attention span, and read at a second<br/>
&gt; grade level. Academic problems escalated into social problems. He even<br/>
&gt; went<br/>
&gt; to live with his grandparents to give another school system a try, but<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; no avail.<br/>
&gt; While discussing Trevor&#39;s problems with his school&#39;s<br/>
&gt; vice-principal, he advised Trevor&#39;s mom that homeschooling could be a<br/>
&gt; perfect alternative. Considering her options, schedule, and abilities,<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; two and a half months into the school year, Karen Maples decided to<br/>
&gt; become<br/>
&gt; a homeschooling mom.<br/>
&gt; Vermont&#39;s homeschooling requirements are neither easy nor<br/>
&gt; difficult: submit a portfolio to the Board of Education or provide a<br/>
&gt; Stanford Achievement Test score. Karen submitted a portfolio the first<br/>
&gt; year, but for efficiency she switched to the standardized test the next<br/>
&gt; year, and the year after. Trevor&#39;s score improved markedly, as did his<br/>
&gt; self-confidence when he was in a learning environment that didn&#39;t call<br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; &quot;learning disabled.&quot; School officials deemed the test results suspect.<br/>
&gt; Then one day, eighteen months after homeschooling began, the school<br/>
&gt; called to ask if Trevor was absent because of illness. Karen thought<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; strange, but was assured it was a clerical mistake. This was before the<br/>
&gt; school sent a letter to the state&#39;s attorney claiming that Trevor was a<br/>
&gt; child in need of supervision.<br/>
&gt; Enter several court appearances over two years, always with a<br/>
&gt; public defender, always denied the ability to submit SAT scores into<br/>
&gt; evidence. The state, in its all-powerful wisdom, decided Trevor needed a<br/>
&gt; tutor.<br/>
&gt; But the tutor quit after one lesson. Allegedly, the tutor told<br/>
&gt; Karen she was asked to lie about the condition of Karen&#39;s home - and<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t. Because he had been labeled &quot;learning disabled,&quot; the school<br/>
&gt; demanded to evaluate Trevor&#39;s education. Karen refused.<br/>
&gt; A social service employee followed Karen around the grocery store.<br/>
&gt; Social service employees have been found banging on Karen&#39;s front door<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; she arrived home. The children now run upstairs to hide when strangers<br/>
&gt; approach the house.<br/>
&gt; To date Karen has had three public defenders, as has Trevor. She<br/>
&gt; has seen three judges, one of whom, Judge Kupersmith, must hold a<br/>
&gt; grudge.<br/>
&gt; When Judge Cashman filled in for Kupersmith once this summer and read<br/>
&gt; Karen&#39;s case, he said the entire matter should have been thrown out.<br/>
&gt; While Judge Cashman had heard cases all day, Judge Kupersmith<br/>
&gt; walked in to take care of Karen. Even though she had a &quot;real&quot; lawyer who<br/>
&gt; was given 30 hours to prepare, Karen was arrested at this appearance,<br/>
&gt; found<br/>
&gt; in contempt of court for failure to bring Trevor to a juvenile court<br/>
&gt; hearing on August 13. (Karen had informed the judge they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; appear,<br/>
&gt; at which time Kupersmith told her Trevor would be placed in permanent<br/>
&gt; custory of Vermont Social and Rehabilitative Services. With this threat,<br/>
&gt; Karen and family went into hiding until she appeared in court on<br/>
&gt; September<br/>
&gt; 1, 1999 - without Trevor.)<br/>
&gt; Karen is such a horrid criminal bail is being denied, as is a<br/>
&gt; breast pump for this nursing mother. Diane Wheeler, Franklin County<br/>
&gt; deputy<br/>
&gt; state&#39;s attorney acting as prosecutor, states, &quot;Essentially, Ms. Maple<br/>
&gt; holds the key to the cell door,&quot; meaning they don&#39;t intend to release<br/>
&gt; her<br/>
&gt; until she offers up custody of Trevor as her bail.<br/>
&gt; A sorely needed defense fund has been established. Donations may be<br/>
&gt; sent to Karen Maple Defense Fund, c/o Richard Gadbois, Esq., RFD,<br/>
