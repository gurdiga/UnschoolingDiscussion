We had a toddler size table that the grandparents bought.  I finally bribed<br/>
my son to use it one day so I could take a picture to send them.  It was<br/>
sold when we moved, since he was too big for it now.<br/>
<br/>
We paint at the kitchen table sometimes, but it keeps getting used for<br/>
meals.  We have a table for the keyboard, and a small one that our chess set<br/>
seems to permanently live at now.  Otherwise, everything is done on a bed,<br/>
the sofa, or the floor.  Oh, and I have a desk.  But it&#39;s a dumping ground.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397068395">Everyone in my family has ended up with full-size office type desks in <br/>
some form or another.  Dh scored us two nice ones from his company years <br/>
ago when we were both working at home.  Over the years I&#39;ve collected <br/>
others at garage sales, etc.  We all need desks because we all have <br/>
computers.  (Some day I&#39;m getting a laptop, tho, and won&#39;t be needing <br/>
this big old desk anymore.  I&#39;m going to read my email in bed!)<br/>
<br/>
Dh won me a very nice office chair by putting his business card in a <br/>
hat.  I bought him a nice one a few years ago, so that meant the kids <br/>
got the old ones for their desks.  So it looks like we bought everyone <br/>
desks by design, but that&#39;s not really true.  We&#39;d get a computer, and <br/>
then get a desk.  The computer would need upgrading and handed down and <br/>
so the recipient would get a desk for his &quot;new&quot; computer.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a Fisher-Price picnic table in the library that we have always <br/>
used for painting and gluing.  But the youngest has outgrown it now.  It <br/>
will be sold at the next garage sale.  <br/>
<br/>
School desks are totally unnecessary in our house.  I just don&#39;t see the <br/>
point.  <br/>

sales of surplus office equipment.  Here in Victoria, we can get big <br/>
office-sized desks for about $25.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422784500">Look in the paper at the end of the school year and you may be able to find<br/>
some of those kid sized tables that are used in Pre-K and K. I&#39;ve always<br/>
wanted to get one of the half circle sharped ones for myself to scrapbook<br/>
on.<br/>
Of course, I would have to sit on teh floor1<br/>
