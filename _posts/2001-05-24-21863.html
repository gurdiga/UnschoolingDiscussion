We&#39;re with you.  We don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; Santa like other people &quot;do&quot; Santa.  We<br/>
do play a Santa game, and set out cookies, but we make it known that it<br/>
is just a game.  We talk about the idea of giving, unconditional love,<br/>
the spirit of the season, all the holidays celebrated during the season,<br/>
etc.  We&#39;ve made this decision based on a few factors.  We don&#39;t want to<br/>
lie.  We want to make it known that one can get what one wants in<br/>
reality.  The capitalism factor.<br/>
<br/>
And though we&#39;re not religious, I certainly don&#39;t want to hear, &quot;You<br/>
told me there was a Santa, and there isn&#39;t.  You told me there was an<br/>
Easter bunny, and there isn&#39;t.  Now you&#39;re talking about an higher power<br/>
. . . &quot;  You get the idea.<br/>
