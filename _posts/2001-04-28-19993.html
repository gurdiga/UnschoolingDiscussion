<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been wondering about those electronic bug deterrent devices. <br/>
&gt;Anyone have any experience with them? Do they really do what they <br/>
&gt;claim to do, which is keep all the creepy crawlies at bay? Apparently <br/>
&gt;some even work for rodents...<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My DH said they tested those in the Forest Service and they don&#39;t work.  But then, who can trust the government!!<br/>

My  parents were VERY skeptical, but they thought<br/>
they&#39;d try anyway, nothing to lose but the cost of the<br/>
device, and they were willing to risk that. And the<br/>
devices really work, they say. I was there visiting<br/>
them, in Corpus Christi, and I saw not a single bug or<br/>
lizard or anthing like that in their house. Juli<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe certain brands work and certain brands don&#39;t?  Or they work on <br/>
certain bugs (the ones they have in Texas) and not on other bugs (the <br/>
ones they have in places where people say they don&#39;t work)?  They&#39;re <br/>
pretty popular in Japan - or they were last year when I was there.  <br/>
But I never got one.<br/>
