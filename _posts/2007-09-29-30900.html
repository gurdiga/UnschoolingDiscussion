<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899678946">An intriguing little thought I chanced on:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If there are five birds sitting on a fence and you shoot one of them <br/>
how many are left sitting on the fence?<br/>
<br/>
A teacher will tell you the answer is four.<br/>
<br/>
The real life answer is none. The other birds would have flown away <br/>
when the shot was fired.&quot;<br/>
