definitely believe in alternate realities, and being able to be <br/>
present in the past, present, and future at the same time, to glean <br/>
insight from those past and future experiences.  I know it has <br/>
nothing to do with unschooling, so if you want to talk about it <br/>
off-list, I&#39;d welcome it.<br/>

&gt; I am in total agreement with your philosophy, with the exception that <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe everything is pre-determined.  I believe in free <br/>
&gt; will, but we freely made our choices before we came here, so that <br/>
&gt; while things may seem pre-determined (the kind of life we have, when <br/>
&gt; and how we will die, etc.) that WE are the ones that pre-determined <br/>
&gt; it, so we really did have freedom of choice, it&#39;s just that we chose <br/>
&gt; before we were born, and now we just have to learn lessons from those <br/>
&gt; choices. <br/>
