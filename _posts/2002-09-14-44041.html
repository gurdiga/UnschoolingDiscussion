<br/>
&gt;The truth is that I allowed myself to be minimally medicated so that I <br/>
&gt;would sleep occasionally and so that I can function as a quasi- normal <br/>
&gt;parent. I have a child, have been married three times, have never killed <br/>
&gt;any one and I only get mildly deranged while suffering once a month from <br/>
&gt;PMS (According to my son that&#39;s Pre Monster Syndrome). I can laugh at the <br/>
&gt;label I have. My son cannot laugh at his.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;This label is all over his school paperwork. Teachers make assumptions <br/>
&gt;right from the beginning when they see that label and it colors their <br/>
&gt;interaction for the rest of the year. They say my son is disruptive. I have <br/>
&gt;been in class and witnessed this. He is excited to be learning and not shy <br/>
&gt;about speaking out. He is impatient to show you that he knows the answer <br/>
&gt;and gets frustrated with classmates who lag behind. He is ready to move <br/>
&gt;on.right now. It causes problems, to be sure. But he is not being the <br/>
&gt;monster that they describe in notes home to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome Virginia,<br/>
<br/>
I loved reading your post from someone who has and does live with the <br/>
&quot;labels&quot; and also because I thought you put it all down so very well. Good <br/>
for you for not accepting them in regards to your son and it sounds like you <br/>
know your decision already is the right one. I&#39;m sure your son will prosper <br/>
greatly from that.<br/>
<br/>
When you mentioned that your son is not the monster the teachers make him <br/>
out to be, it made me think of my son too. I think most of the time, any <br/>
child who will not do exactly as they are told and sit still in the <br/>
classroom will be labeled something. Whether it&#39;s ADHD or just hard to <br/>
control, etc. My husband and I joke a lot to ourselves on how if our son was <br/>
in school, we would be there every day. I don&#39;t think they would label him <br/>
ADHD but I have no doubt they would find him hard to deal with. He hasn&#39;t <br/>
grown up having someone tell him what to do all the time and just wouldn&#39;t <br/>
sit well at all with being corraled and roped and tied up all day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure exactly how I feel about the whole &quot;is ADD and ADHD real or <br/>
not?&quot; I&#39;ve heard a lot of the aruguments on how it is very real and how many <br/>
think there is no such thing. I must say I tend to sway to the latter. Then <br/>
again I think there are very real circumstances where people and children <br/>
can benefit from some type of medication. Been there and done that and I&#39;m <br/>
glad I did.<br/>
<br/>
So good for you and welcome and enjoy.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I am new to unschooling. In fact, I am still waiting for my paperwork to <br/>
be approved. My son will still be in school until early October. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WHY?<br/>
What state are you in?  Who needs to &quot;approve&quot; your keeping your son in an <br/>
environment which is good for him?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have been keeping him home a day or two a week and beginning the process <br/>
of unschooling him, getting him used to the idea of it and the rhythm of it. <br/>

<br/>
School&#39;s probably his only problem.  Bring him home and run around with him!  <br/>

Welcome to the list!<br/>

I just found a list called THINKINGMOMS on yahoogroups a few days ago for moms that are for natural living, attachment parenting, homeschooling, etc. It seems to be really slow but people answer if you talk! LOL<br/>

  Why would an unschooler choose the path of  medicating their children?<br/>
  There&#39;s no need for ritalin, since the child doesn&#39;t need to be <br/>
  confined in a classroom and forced to sit and behave.  There&#39;s no <br/>
  need for medication for Tourettes, since there is no classroom to be <br/>
  complaining about the child&#39;s tics.  Please tell me, why do you <br/>
  choose to medicate?<br/>
<br/>
  It is very rare to hear that parents of schooled children take the <br/>
  stand of not-medicating their children, because they are usually <br/>
  pressured to do so by the school system.  <br/>
<br/>
  Ideally, if there&#39;s such a list out there, I&#39;d like to join which <br/>
  advocates for attachment parenting, unschooling, healthy living, <br/>
  homesteading, with gifted special needs children.  <br/>

  &gt; Many homeschooling parents choose to use medication as part of <br/>
  therapy for disorders such as ADD and Tourettes. Many parents (and <br/>
  more all the tie) who send children to schools are choosing to forego <br/>
  the use of medication if they feel it&#39;s not warranted to not helpful.<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt; Some of us adults who are homeschooling our children have chosen to <br/>
  use medication in remediating our own neurological stumbling blocks. <br/>
  (And precious few of us were diagnosed when we were in school.)<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
  &gt; It really isn&#39;t a cut-and-dried homeschooling issue.  There are <br/>
  about a kazillion email lists out there now, and it may take a while <br/>
  before you find the list where you feel comfortable. <br/>

  majority of<br/>
  &gt; &gt;the list members advocated medication --- this list &gt;is not a <br/>
  homeschool<br/>
  &gt; &gt;list, so I don&#39;t think the members can relate to me &gt;very well.  <br/>
