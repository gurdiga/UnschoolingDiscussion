<div id="ygrps-yiv-985091296">and besides.. someone disagreeing with one&#39;s views or even putting down one&#39;s views does not necessarily constitute the personal attack we often take it as.. i have learned to simply ignore messages that disagree unless there is something useful for me in them.. or new information i want in them.. <br/>
<br/>
getting angry over disagreements in philosophies of learning (or anything else) is directly related to our own insecurities and need for validation.. <br/>
<br/>
so what if someone disagrees with your ideas or my ideas.. i dont take that as a personal attack.. it&#39;s not.. i may think some people are really nuts .. but that doesnt MAKE them nuts.. it&#39;s just my own ideas..<br/>
<br/>
i mean for one thing.. i find SO MANY rules on this list.. i have seen as many rules for UNschooling as i have for SCHOOLING... hahhaahaha.. but then .... some people need rules..<br/>

  I&#39;m sorry, but it doesn&#39;t make any sense at all to me to try to compare<br/>
  physical abuse and corporal punishment of children...to rude posts.  And<br/>
  to disagree very strongly with a co-members unschooling view and put up<br/>
  an argument in defense of your own views _can_ be done tactfully.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - let&#39;s take off from this post and talk about this idea that there are <br/>
&quot;rules&quot; for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve seen I didn&#39;t take as &quot;rules&quot; so much as people talking about what <br/>
they really mean by unschooling. Rules implies there is some kind of enforcer <br/>
-- some standard that we are required to follow. But - this is just email - <br/>
just a discussion list. You don&#39;t have to register as an unschooler and <br/>
nobody is authorized to check up on us &lt;G&gt;. People might say, &quot;That isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.&quot; So what? THAT itself is just something to consider -- think <br/>
about - &quot;Hey, maybe there is MORE to unschooling than I understood before - <br/>
let me ask some more or write some more and get more feedback about this new <br/>
development.&quot; Or they might think, &quot;Whoa - I think I was totally <br/>
misunderstood - let me clarify what I meant because I really DO think it is <br/>
unschooling. Let&#39;s see if my clarification changes the response.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here on this list we often seem to talk about what unschooling really is -- <br/>
and when people do that, try to describe what they see as &quot;unschooling,&quot;  <br/>
sometimes other people feel like they are trying to impose rules.<br/>
<br/>
I think it does have to do, as Mary said, with how confident people are with <br/>
their own decisions. Some people feel personally criticized when someone <br/>
says, &quot;That isn&#39;t unschooling.&quot; Some people feel they are having rules <br/>
imposed on them when someone says: &quot;Using a formal phonics program is not <br/>
unschooling.&quot; Some people really have a desire to &quot;be&quot; unschoolers and it <br/>
feels bad to them when people take it farther than they really want to take <br/>
it. They see it as a power struggle over who gets the bragging rights - to <br/>
call themselves unschoolers. But REALLY it isn&#39;t about that - it is just <br/>
about exchanging ideas -- that&#39;s ALL.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of feeling imposed on - a more confident person would say, to <br/>
themselves, &quot;Oh - interesting - that person doesn&#39;t think this is <br/>
unschooling. I wonder why not? I wonder what, in her opinion, an unschooler <br/>
WOULD do in this situation? I wonder if she really understood what I meant? I <br/>
wonder if there COULD be another way that would work better? I wonder if this <br/>
might actually have some deleterious side effects? I wonder what they might <br/>
be? Hmmm - I don&#39;t think I agree with this point she made - let me say on the <br/>
list why I don&#39;t agree and find out what the response will be - give me and <br/>
others something more to consider.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
AND they might say, to themselves, &quot;Hmmm - I really like what we&#39;re already <br/>
doing - it is really working for us - so that comment didn&#39;t really hit home <br/>
for me. Maybe we&#39;re not as radical unschoolers as some others are  - <br/>
interesting to hear how far some people do take this, though. Should I change <br/>
what we&#39;re doing? I don&#39;t really want to. Well, at least I can consider other <br/>
options and know that there are people out there doing things differently. <br/>
Worth being aware of that in case I do decide that what we&#39;re now doing is no <br/>
longer working well for us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546835711">I too have found the communication exchange on this list rather bizarre<br/>
and rude. There are plenty of interesting ideas, but a tendency by a few<br/>
to say &quot;That&#39;s not unschooling!&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s not valid.&quot;  It would make a<br/>
lot more sense to say, &quot; I got what you said, but I see it<br/>
differently....&quot; Or ask questions as you suggest. But it happened to me<br/>
when I first jumped in. Even when I posted again, I got back some absurd<br/>
post from one person suggesting I had done, thought, viewed things a way<br/>
I had not, and she wasn&#39;t interested or gonna ask me what I thought!<br/>
Anyway, I decided to mainly lurk and take what ideas I respected and<br/>
wanted, but not really post or not much - because there are a vocal few<br/>
who seem more interested in their own pat answers than new thoughts or<br/>
exchange to develop ideas further. .. My actual views are probably way<br/>
more radical than anyone here could actually stomach. <br/>
Oh, well. I still enjoy quite a few of the posts. I guess there are<br/>
enough speakers on here already.<br/>
