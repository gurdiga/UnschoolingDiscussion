<div id="ygrps-yiv-383045414">Well for the first time in a week I took some time to look at my bible and the first thing that came up was this first.....<br/>
    Philippians 4:8  Finally brethren whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.  <br/>
    So after spending time thinking about this I realized that this list is not any of these things.  In fact it has prompted me to act in total opposition of these ideals.  I&#39;m leaving the list in light of this and I would urge any Christians on this list that end up feeling like they are beat up, angry and disgusted by what they read here to reconsider your reasons why you are on this list.  There are lists out there that are diverse and allow all kinds of views but which aren&#39;t quite so hateful toward one another.  I would ask you to consider adding your support to these lists.  Good luck in your unschooling adventure.<br/>
