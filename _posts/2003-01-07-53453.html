&lt;&lt;  That&#39;s a really hard thing to tell new unschoolers, too, who are <br/>

I was advocating the mother healing her lack of confidence in herself by <br/>
pursuing her passions...that does not equal ignore the kids in my world.<br/>
But I can see where some people may take it that way. It&#39;s more like don&#39;t <br/>
ignore your own passions and focus so hard on what your kids are learning and <br/>
pretty soon unschooling will be joyfully bubbling along!!<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I meant right at the very beginning of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Some moms think they can&#39;t do ANYTHING else until their children&#39;s &quot;program&quot; <br/>
is in place.  And sometimes the thing they need to do is let their kids play <br/>
and get their own &quot;program&quot; in place, start to deschool, start to see what <br/>
they like doing and remember things they have learned without lessons.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s more like don&#39;t <br/>
ignore your own passions and focus so hard on what your kids are learning and <br/>
pretty soon unschooling will be joyfully bubbling along!!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I mean.  Don&#39;t focus so hard on what your kids are learning right <br/>
at first.<br/>
Because right at first most parents are looking for their kids to learn <br/>
school-looking stuff.  They&#39;re waiting with bated breath for how their kids <br/>
will learn algebraic equations or diagramming sentences, and all that <br/>
breath-holding does NO good whatsoever.<br/>
