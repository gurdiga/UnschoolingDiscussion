 </span></blockquote>Hmm I&#39;m seeing a connection there between books and people. I think <br/>
people are a big source of changes, large and small, on other people <br/>
like a bag of stones being shaken - what &#39;shapes&#39; you are the other <br/>
stones you come in contact with. How the ideas, attitudes, information <br/>
get from one person to another can vary - books are one way, but so is <br/>
conversation, speech (like hearing a moving or aggravating speaker), <br/>
movies, plays, music (with or without lyrics), paintings, photographs, <br/>
dance, touch, and more recently electronic media - TV, video, video <br/>
games, computers (here we are touching each other on the Internet and <br/>
email). Different cultures do use different combinations but they are <br/>
all a means to touching and connecting, one to another. And in that <br/>
connecting, we are shaped.<br/>

<br/>
I changed a LOT in the last few years.  I think my changes came from a combination of: <br/>
<br/>
-talking things through with my husband<br/>
-being online and reading stuff people were saying about different philosophies and ideas<br/>
-coming to this list specifically, and having people like you (Sandra) and others being able to take my arguing (at first) and my insecure questioning later and come back at me with REALLY good blunt, to the point, mindful, honest, helpful, insightful  answers.  <br/>
-talking things through with my homeopath<br/>
-I guess I should give myself a bit of credit for being willing to at least think about things that might cause me to change. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband came first...he helped me be open minded enough to even consider the stuff I was reading here.  Then I came here and showed him stuff and helped him be open minded about different stuff.  Then my homeopath helped me even further after that...without the progress I made here and research about alternative healthcare that I did online the homeopath wouldn&#39;t have gotten anywhere with me <br/>
<br/>
So I guess the answer for me is people.  But not just the hanging out with friends locally kind of people interaction.  The &quot;getting on the internet and deeply discussing issues with people you never would have met without the internet&quot; kind of talking to people.  <br/>
<br/>
Books were fun too, but mostly they were affirmations of what I already had acknowledged and understood from talking to people.  <br/>

Frank Smith repeats the old adage that &quot;you learn from the company you <br/>

books as &quot;company&quot;, I think.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945885038">Hey Sandra�<br/>
<br/>
You probably know this, but one of the essays in �Deschooling Our Lives�<br/>
touches on book worship.  It�s �The Intimate and The Ultimate�  by Vinoba<br/>
Bhave (sure sounds like an Austin Powers character��Oh Behave!�).   The<br/>
author is from India.   Here�s a quote:<br/>
<br/>
�If a man�s house is full of medicine bottles, we infer that the man is<br/>
probably ill.  But if his house is full of books, we conclude that he is<br/>
intelligent.  Surely that  is not right?  The first rule of health is to<br/>
take medicine only when it is absolutely necessary.  By the same token, the<br/>
first rule of intelligence ought to be to avoid, so far as possible, burying<br/>
one�s eyes in books.  WE consider medicine bottles to be a sign of a sick<br/>
body; we out to consider books, whether secular or religious, as the sign of<br/>
a sick mind!�<br/>
<br/>
I always thought that a clean house was a sign of a sick mind�if it�s books,<br/>
I�m in BAD trouble! :-)<br/>
<br/>
The article has other good stuff too� more than I can comment on now,<br/>
though.  I love books, and live pretty close to the edge of worshiping them,<br/>
but I sure don�t believe that they are one of the two �things� that have<br/>
changed me.  Yeah, I guess both books and people have shaped me as a person<br/>
(as have pop tarts and cheeseburgers :-)) but so have other things.  Here<br/>
are some:<br/>
<br/>
***As a college student, I spent 6 months in Germany.  I backpacked around<br/>
Europe, spent Christmas in Paris, and did the usual student stuff.  When I<br/>
got back to the states, I felt like I could do anything.  I had not felt<br/>
that way before.  I did read books and interact with people in Europe, but<br/>
those are not what made me feel invincible.<br/>
<br/>
***Before my oldest child was born, I lost two babies.  My first was<br/>
stillborn at 39 weeks.  I miscarried my second 5 months later at 9 weeks.<br/>
That changed me.  Yes, these babies were people, but I didn�t �hang out�<br/>
with them in the sense that the freecycle poster meant.  The experience<br/>
changed me.<br/>
<br/>
***Living in Japan as a military family member has changed me.  Not because<br/>
I hang out with military or non-military people, but since we don�t live on<br/>
the base, my day-to-day life is lived in Japanese society.  Since I speak<br/>
only minimal Japanese and don�t read it at all, I�m living as a functional<br/>
illiterate here.  I�ve definitely changed.<br/>
<br/>
Okay�my brain is stormed out.  Thanks for the mental exercise!<br/>
<br/>
Tami<br/>
(who struggles with trying to learn the 2 phonetic alphabets in Japanese and<br/>
so far can recognize the words for �beer� and �baseball�  Go figure! :-)).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030545501">Just yesterday I grabbed a DVD from the library of old Twilight Zone episodes.  We watched one from 1959, in which the main character is criticized by his boss and by his wife because he wants to read all the time  -  books, newspapers, even cereal boxes (or something like that).  He sneaks down into the bank vault during his lunch break, to read in peace.  The screen shows him reading a newspaper with a headline about A bombs.<br/>

We got into a discussion about the old ones I just told her all about this very episode since it is my favorite.  She really wants to see it now...need to figure out when it is on or get it on dvd or something (is older Twilight Zones on dvd yet?).<br/>

Lots of things within the broader category of nature change me.  Other living things change me.  My cat, Sasha, certainly does -- through my own home monitoring, I have discovered that having her curl up in my lap can lower my systolic blood pressure by 20 points within just 3 minutes (and I don&#39;t even have high blood pressure).  Obviously an intense experience with various forces of nature, like tornadoes, floods and hurricanes, can change people dramatically.  Not only by the change it creates when it damages their physical surroundings, but it quite often changes them emotionally as well.  Even experiencing the simple beauty of a sunset changes me when I am open to it.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re looking forward to a Mother&#39;s Day weekend of severe weather potential here in Oklahoma -- so I&#39;m hoping I don&#39;t have to face too much change in the next few days!<br/>

First thing that came to mine was illness.  I think any life- <br/>
threatening illness would change a person.  My most recent experience  <br/>
was my kids contracting Pertussis last year.  Ds developed a nasty  <br/>
habit cough, undiagnosed at the time, which required nearly total bed  <br/>
rest until we figured out what it was and beat it.  Weeks of no  <br/>
diagnosis, isolation and maybe too much introspection triggered  <br/>
exteme anxieties about lots of schoolish things we&#39;d been having him  <br/>
do.  After Pertussis we made the ultimate turn around into what some  <br/>
would call radical unschooling!  What a &quot;blessing&quot; as some, but not  <br/>
usually me, would say,  Pertussis was in our lives!<br/>

taught me not to look at life through the eyes of a  typical homeschool mom <br/>
anymore.  Has taught me to appreciate my parents,  and to not take our imperfect, <br/>
quirky family for granted.  Has  taught me to be really happy with small <br/>
changes and steps forward. <br/>
 <br/>
2.  Becoming real friends with our parish nun, an older lady with  Parkinsons <br/>
disease with a wonderful outlook and great sense of humor.  She  has really <br/>

<br/>
   I agree that relationships with animals can change a person.  Think <br/>
about<br/>
those programs for inmates who train dogs for adoption or even (I think <br/>
I<br/>
heard this) for helping humans like seeing eye dogs.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
You heard right. SouthEastern Guide Dogs, Inc has a program in SC <br/>
called IMPACT in which inmates receive puppies to raise as guide dogs.<br/>
<br/>
We have one of the SEGDI pupppies now. Ryan. In fact, I&#39;m off today to <br/>
exchange him for a little black lab bitch named Rotey. Ryan and Rotey <br/>
will exchange families for three weeks for puppy camp. Leaving Ryan <br/>
today will be like cutting off my left arm!<br/>
<br/>
But the IMPACT program has been highly successful---for SEGDI, the <br/>
pups, and the inmates. You can see the program featured on Animal <br/>
Planet occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
Now back to your regularly scheduled Book Worship Thread....<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; --Deb<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the kind of thing I was thinking of when I read the quote <br/>
about people and books changing someone.  Books are one way we <br/>
connect with people.  A person could be changed just as much by a <br/>
movie, a musical piece, etc.(see list above &lt;g&gt;)  To say that people <br/>
are changed by books is really just saying that they are changed by <br/>
people because books are just an expression of ideas.  The person <br/>
stating that &#39;only people and books change you&#39; might argue that it <br/>
is the actual book format that helps create change. But it seems to <br/>
me that it was a not very well thought out statement.<br/>
<br/>
Other posts have given examples of change not directly connected to <br/>
other people.  I think these would fit into the broad category <br/>
of &#39;experience&#39;.  Here are a couple of my own examples:<br/>
<br/>
With my first pregnancy I began to pay attention to my body in a way <br/>
I never had before. I started making all kinds of connections <br/>
between my actions and the way my body responded. I gained a new <br/>
awareness that very much changed me.<br/>
<br/>
When I stood on the beach at the ocean for the first time, I felt <br/>
changed.  All the pictures, paintings, and movies had not prepared <br/>
me for actually BEING there.<br/>

women, I don&#39;t know. I remember vividly being on a beach in southern <br/>
France as the sun set on my birthday and it was almost 17 yrs ago - <br/>
the birds, the wet sand smell, a man riding his horse along the <br/>
beach...mmm I remember experiencing lots of things, the Alps, the <br/>
Mississippi River, lots of stuff but some of the deepest are large, <br/>
living waters (grew up in NJ so there&#39;s lots of ocean scents, <br/>
sounds, sensations tucked away).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The most profound thing that changes me is the passage of time. Plain <br/>
and simple.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I&#39;m going to suggest a book. ;) Seriously, an <br/>
interesting and compelling argument (as I see it) for the importance of <br/>
print can be found in Partha Chatterjee&#39;s book _Imagined Communities_. <br/>
In it, he tracks the rise of the vernacular (English taking over in <br/>
print from Greek and Latin) as it coincides with the rise of <br/>
nationalism--the American and French Revolutions and all the smaller <br/>
national revolutions in Europe and South America that took them as a <br/>
model. His argument is that as the vernacular became available in print <br/>
(newspapers grew astoundingly in this period) and literacy rates rose <br/>
because people could read stuff in their own language, a broader <br/>
community that spanned geographical space and time became possible. A <br/>
colonist in America, the Virgin Islands or South America could read the <br/>
same newspaper as the citizen in the mother county, creating an imagined <br/>
sense of simultaneous community and connection with those far away in <br/>
space and time (could take weeks for the newspapers to arrive to the <br/>
colonies). His argument is that this print culture made nationalism as <br/>
we know it possible--prior to that religion (think crusades) was the <br/>
organizing principle. He traces this phenomenon through several <br/>
countries, looking at the importance of coffee houses during the <br/>
Revolutionary period, the importance of papers and pamphlets, the rise <br/>
of secret societies and the papers associated with them, that kind of <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an interesting argument for the importance of print culture in <br/>
English even though &quot;the novel&quot; was denigrated in its early development, <br/>
though I have my own arguments as to the purpose novels served during <br/>
the formation of modern nationalism.<br/>

Other things I can think of that changed me...<br/>
<br/>
sometimes a move can really change you.<br/>
having kids is another thing that can(and usually does) change how <br/>
you look at everything. <br/>
Getting married.<br/>
Getting divorced.<br/>
Having someone close to you die.<br/>
Becoming a survivor of something. (rape, abuse, etc)<br/>
Leaving home and creating your own place in the world for the first <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I can think of for now....<br/>

Definitely illness.  For me, a brain tumor at age 35 was life  changing.  I <br/>
had been married 10 years, career oriented with no plans for  children.  The <br/>
realization that I would live, led to a re-evaluation of my  life choices and at <br/>
36 Brenna was born.  At 40, I had Logan.   Definitely changed me and all for <br/>
the better. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
And divorce.  That hit me like a train wreck.  Many, many changes  in my <br/>
previous ability to trust without question.  It helped me find  strength that I <br/>
never knew I had and led me to a relationship that was healthy  and loving.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Having children.  That was the biggest life changer for  me.  Being mom to <br/>
these two beautiful children. Led me to joy....led  me to unschooling.  Led me <br/>
to this morning when I woke up to find tulips  from Brenna and a card she <br/>
made...It&#39;s says simply, To Mom--I love you so much  today and everyday. Happy <br/>
Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>
 <br/>
Gail<br/>
Feeling a bit &quot;mushy&quot; this morning and thankful for all the life  changing <br/>
events that have brought me to today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094519202">I had ideas, but wanted to see what others thought too.  I&#39;m collecting this <br/>
stuff, and have been thinking about it all the time I&#39;m pulling weeds.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always liked books.  I like books now.  I like magazines and pamphlets.  <br/>
I like liner notes for CDs.  I like the sides of cereal boxes.  I like the <br/>
yellow pages of phone books in cities where I don&#39;t live, to see what they <br/>
advertise that Albuquerque never even heard of, like dehumidifiers and earthquake <br/>
preparedness kids and training.   <br/>
<br/>
What my shortlist of &quot;things that change people&quot; was has been named by <br/>
others, all by one.  My ideas were:<br/>
meditation/prayer<br/>
time (maturity)<br/>
parenthood/marriage/divorce/jobs (which I would categorize as &quot;change of <br/>
status,&quot; and say &quot;responsibility can changes a person&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Self reflection changes me, but maybe that should go with meditation/prayer.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked what non-spiritual explanation/term for changes after illness <br/>
might be, and I think maybe it&#39;s that adversity brings on different <br/>
biochemistry, and new neural pathways (and emotional &quot;sets&quot;) are created during <br/>
adversity.  We learn to cope.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking (and it&#39;s just an early idea, not a theory or a conviction) that <br/>
maybe ALL those things (books, people and all the rest) change us only at the <br/>
point at which we learn.  Learning changes us.<br/>
<br/>
And if so, that brings me back to the first question.  Did this person mean <br/>
to suggest that the only things we learn from are people and books?   <br/>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
What about atmosphere?  A stimulating atmosphere vs. a sterile boring atmosphere has to change a person.  A kid who grows up in a house where he can&#39;t touch anything and it just feels stuffy and stifling would probably have a different outlook on the world than he would have if he had grown up in a stimulating house where he had freedom to create and make messes.  And a person who goes from having her own house to be institutionalized is sometimes changed so much that they give up and die (I&#39;m thinking old people who want to remain in their home but are forced into nursing homes).  <br/>
<br/>
But that takes us right back to your theory (or early idea &lt;g&gt;) again.  Because atmosphere affects how you learn.  It also affects emotions though too.  A little old lady happy and content in her home can become despondent when she has to leave it...is it because she can&#39;t learn and think the way she wants to in the institution?  Maybe! <br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s love and shame and acceptance and fear and other emotions.  Someone could learn a lot academically even though she&#39;s made fun of or ignored by most of the people around her.  A kid who&#39;s abused at home and never learned to be herself and is withdrawn so much into a shell that the other kids make fun of her and so she just throws herself into academic work in school because it&#39;s all she has.  She&#39;s learning, but not learning the same things she would have learned if she had been loved and accepted and free to be herself.  <br/>
<br/>

adversity.  We learn to cope.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The movie What the Bleep Do we Know hit on that a little bit. It talked about how the chemical patterns in our brain affect everything about us, and how we can consciously change the chemical patterns in our brain to create what we want to see in our lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, so I think movies could be added to the list!   <br/>
I have heard people say that What the Bleep  was life changing.  Several people on other lists said that they actually think they&#39;ll be able to break addictions because of watching the movie. <br/>
 I watched the movie and enjoyed it, but I really got the most insight from it when talking to my husband and friend about it.  (That&#39;s an interesting thing I&#39;m learning about myself...I always thought of myself as such an introvert, yet I&#39;m realizing as I&#39;ve been reflecting on this thread that I really do learn and change the most when I discuss ideas with other people. )  <br/>
<br/>
I remember as a kid our church would show those end time movies.  Anyone else from a conservative Christian background remember them?  Thief in the night, Mark of the Beast, Distant thunder (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amfchristianvideos.com/Thief_Night.htm)">http://www.amfchristianvideos.com/Thief_Night.htm)</a>.  LOTS of people &quot;went forward&quot; to commit their lives to Christ after those movies.  Lots of little kids (including me!) had nightmares after those movies.  So there&#39;s another example of life-changing (maybe in a not so positive way, imo) movie.  <br/>
