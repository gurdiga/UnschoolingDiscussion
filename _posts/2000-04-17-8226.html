<div id="ygrps-yiv-366878215">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I received a call this afternoon from a reporter working on an article for<br/>
a professional magazine in the Washington, DC area. She&#39;s trying to<br/>
determine if there are any statistics available on the racial/ethnic<br/>
diversity of homeschooling families. Anyone know any resources, articles,<br/>
or websites I could send her to? Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Helen<br/>
