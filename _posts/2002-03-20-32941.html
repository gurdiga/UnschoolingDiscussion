 </span></blockquote>My posts seem to be doing okay today.  Yesterday though I&#39;d write something<br/>
and sometimes it showed up right away and other times it took hours to get<br/>
there.  Something is whacky right now - could be Yahoo or it could be<br/>
the web - maybe a major router is down.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s 4:02 here now (pacific time) so it did take some time to get thru.<br/>

I got it at precisely 4:49 p.m. Arizona Time. I&#39;m not sure what that is<br/>
right now (Mountain? Pacific?) We just never change the clock!<br/>

Ummm, never mind that last post. That was wrong.<br/>
I REALLY received it at 4:51 p.m. (which would be 2 minutes after you sent<br/>
it factoring in the time change difference).<br/>
