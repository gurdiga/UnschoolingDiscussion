<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912652716">&quot; I have been reading a lot about families, even unschoolers, who say<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their three year olds help set the table every day and their two year<br/>
&gt; olds always bring their plates over to the sink after eating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HA! Even my 16 and 12 y.o.&#39;s don&#39;t remember to bring their dishes out<br/>
of their room every day. They eventually get them to the sink, or I&#39;ll<br/>
remind them if I notice and grab a couple on my way out.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra loves to help set the table and stuff like that. Jalen(almost5)<br/>
hates anything that even resembles a &quot;chore&quot;, but if it&#39;s fun, heck<br/>
yeah. He&#39;ll  use the swiffer or small vacuum cleaner like a maniac.<br/>
He&#39;ll even help me fold laundry if he comes in while I&#39;m doing<br/>
it...but dishes and pick up are not his  thing right now.<br/>
<br/>
The cool parts about not making a big issue out of household tasks, is<br/>
everyone is much more pleasant when they do help. I helped Sierra<br/>
rearrange her room today and the boys apparently got inspired. I guess<br/>
it was Trevor&#39;s idea (he and Jared share a room temporarily) and they<br/>
both cleaned it up, vacuumed etc... It looked great and no one said a<br/>
thing about it...they just decided they wanted a clean room. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
The ways each person helps are very different, the commonality is it<br/>
comes from a desire within them.<br/>
