<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873597540">A few colleagues and I were discussing unschooling the other day, and <br/>
Amy Hollingsworth (she&#39;s written many good articles for Home <br/>
Education Magazine and is now our PR/Media Liaison), made the <br/>
following observation (shared here with her kind permission):<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of unschooling, I was pleased to see that John Holzmann of <br/>
Sonlight has amended his commentary on unschooling in his April 2001 <br/>
catalogue (which I received in the mail yesterday).  The catalogue <br/>
used to say (at least for the last three years):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Though we believe we ought to capitalize on our children&#39;s <br/>
inquisitive natures ... we do not adopt the philosophy most <br/>
&#39;unschoolers&#39; seem to prefer.  As we said before, we believe we have <br/>
a responsibility before God to help our children acquire the maximum <br/>
knowledge possible while they are young, under our care, and have the <br/>
time. ... We require them to study and practice certain skills or <br/>
behaviors even though they don&#39;t think it is fun, fulfilling or <br/>
profitable.  We try, always, to explain why we are convinced that <br/>
this unpleasant task is profitable.  But whether the child is <br/>
convinced or not, we believe that, as parents, we must take the lead <br/>
and guide our children to maximal achievement.&quot; [Italics mine]<br/>
<br/>
Now it says:  &quot;Sonlight is structured .... That doesn&#39;t mean you are <br/>
under obligation to the structure. ... But if you are committed to a <br/>
spontaneous lifestyle, or an educational philosophy that dictates you<br/>
follow your child&#39;s heart interests, you may find you have to &quot;buck <br/>
[our] system&quot; more than you&#39;d prefer in order to maintain your sense <br/>
of spontaneity. ... Several unschoolers have told us they think we <br/>
fit right in with what they want to do:  we give them the books, they <br/>
work our structure around their interests and inspiration. ... Still, <br/>
if you are committed to go with the flow and prefer not having to <br/>
&#39;check yourself&#39; against someone else&#39;s plan, we fully understand. <br/>
While you may enjoy buying many of our books, you will want to <br/>
proceed with caution when you consider the possibility of purchasing <br/>
a Sonlight Curriculum Basic program.&quot;<br/>
