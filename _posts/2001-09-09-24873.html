<div id="ygrps-yiv-152801019">Interesting groups of posts in this digest:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;. . . &quot;Unschooling needs positive regard.  It needs sweetness and light.  <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;It needs more &quot;yes!&quot; than &quot;NO!&quot;  It needs a lot more of &quot;This is so cool&quot; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;than &quot;This is stupid.&quot;  Some people move in a cloud of disdain, . . . who <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;still had a big cloud of that negativity themselves. . .&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find this amusing because it was promptly followed by the following <br/>
message:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Bridgett are you in your 20&#39;s?  Are you frustrated with your life?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you here just to argue?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Because you&#39;re doing the written version of batting the palms of your hands <br/>
&gt;over your ears and saying LA LA LA LA LA LA LA and I can&#39;t figure out why <br/>
&gt;you would think that&#39;s a good use of your time or ours.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From this dialogue one would, probably quite properly, be led to believe <br/>
that the advise is a one way street.  Search as I might for even a <br/>
microscopic hint of &quot;sweetness,&quot; &quot;light&quot; or &quot;positive&quot; energy, I could find <br/>
none.  It does however fairly reek of &quot;negativity&quot; and &quot;disdain.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And just a thought for those that have no clinical experience working with <br/>
addictive personality, a little research as to successfully working with <br/>
children who have this disease might go a long way to making &quot;conversations&quot; <br/>
with Bridget a little more paletable for all parties concerned.<br/>
<br/>
A person, particularly a child who has an addictive personality in a <br/>
noticable majority of the clinically examed cased do not have an inborn <br/>
ability to &quot;control&quot; behaviors that can be detrimental to them.  There are <br/>
several recommended methods of &quot;teaching&quot; to modify their behaviors and once <br/>
they have learned this they can then regulate themselves.  It is quite <br/>
possible and is documented that without an outside control they are at risk <br/>
to harming themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Television is frequently not allowed in group homes for those who have <br/>
severe cases of addictive, and/or obsessive compulsive behaviors unless the <br/>
televisions are on a timer.  This personality type has been known to <br/>
&quot;forget&quot; to eat or even use the bathroom.  There have been instances when <br/>
their obsession was a walkman and they have walked into traffic with fatal <br/>
results.<br/>
<br/>
From what I have read thus far, it would appear that Bridget is doing what <br/>
is necessary for both her and her son&#39;s situation.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps posters would be better advised to first follow Sandra&#39;s advise <br/>
about not conferring &quot;stupid&quot; on anyone and then doing a little research <br/>
before jumping in with assumptions with no basis in fact.<br/>

quite frequently.  I forget to eat when my problems flare up - but then<br/>
my obsessions are a bit more productive - I sew and knit and research for<br/>
writing!  So at least my addictions might earn us a little money - but<br/>
seriously, it took me years to recognize my problems and even longer to<br/>
get them under control.  I&#39;m hoping to help Wyndham through his with a<br/>
little less pain!<br/>
