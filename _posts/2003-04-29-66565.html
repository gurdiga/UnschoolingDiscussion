This is a beautiful post!!!  (No, not just because my love of Alaska is <br/>
mentioned either. &lt;BG&gt;)  I just want to add that MY love of Alaska has <br/>
spilled over into my entire household.  I actually DO all those things you <br/>
mentioned.  It is my obsession.  My husband rolls his eyes here and there, <br/>
hehe, but my family definitely KNOWS how much I love it.  In turn, my kids <br/>
rush in to tell me everytime Alaska is on TV.  They bring ME books at the <br/>
library, they tell me tidbits they have learned on their own about Alaska.  <br/>
Because *I* love it so much, THEY want to gobble up every word associated <br/>
with it.  My oldest daughter doesn&#39;t like the fact that it is so cold, so <br/>
she is hesitant to want to live there, but she &quot;plans&quot; trips with me, we <br/>
daydream about fun things to do there, fun things we DID there.  She sees my <br/>
adoration and jumps right in to enjoy it with me.  There is a fervent <br/>
&#39;arctic air&#39; in our house, brought on because of MY love of Alaska.  I don&#39;t <br/>
force them to watch documentaries with me.  I don&#39;t call family gatherings <br/>
to peruse every Alaskan book in our home.  I don&#39;t throw Alaskan brochures <br/>
all over their rooms, hoping they, too will learn to love it.  I just love <br/>
it fervently, completely and passionately and they can&#39;t help but want to <br/>
jump in on my dreams.<br/>
<br/>
My children are unschooling ME!  It is a beautiful thing!<br/>

Glena, this post kind of summed up to me why you seemed to be missing what<br/>
people are trying to tell you. And I really do believe it&#39;s just a matter of<br/>
that one little spark of &quot;getting it&quot; that hasn&#39;t happened yet, rather than<br/>
your not WANTING to get it.<br/>
<br/>
The best way in the world to unschool, that I have seen, is to live your <br/>
life<br/>
beside your children and to support them in living their own. Someone<br/>
mentioned that it was unlikely that if Tiger Woods had kids that they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t more or less have golf in their blood. They might not be champions,<br/>
or even like it much....but being around someone who had a passion for it,<br/>
being part the culture of tournaments, etc...the child would Get Golf.<br/>
Likewise, lots of children of musicians become musicians, because music is<br/>
just a part of what they live with.<br/>
<br/>
I think to unschool effectively means that we parents have to have lives and<br/>
interests. We have to have a passion for learning stuff, to like to do <br/>
stuff.<br/>
We CAN&#39;T just do it for the kids. Then it becomes a sacrifice, which IS <br/>
about<br/>
us. Kids don&#39;t want us to sacrifice ourselves...that&#39;s leads to guilt.<br/>
<br/>
My parents did not homeschool me (although my mom said it was too bad they<br/>
didn&#39;t know about that, because it would have been perfect for me), but in<br/>
their own way, they did kind of unschool us. They had interesting lives, and<br/>
we were always welcome to be there. If they had interesting folks over to<br/>
visit, we were never sent to our rooms -- we were welcomed into the<br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
When we had interests, we were always encouraged and supported in them, and<br/>
never told it was silly or impossible.<br/>
<br/>
So, reading the above... I was a bit baffled. Sure, there&#39;s nothing wrong<br/>
with buying the brand of toilet paper your family likes -- but why are you<br/>
the only one who replaces the roll? (I can&#39;t remember how old your kids are,<br/>
but if there&#39;s a concern about algebra and med school, I assume they&#39;re not<br/>
3). If your child likes her linens sprayed with linen spray, why isn&#39;t it<br/>
next to her bed for HER to do it?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that it isn&#39;t fine for you to have a couple of &quot;Lovey Nurturey&quot;<br/>
things you do for your family, but the impression I get is that these are<br/>
just the tip of the iceberg. I think the first thing you need to do is to <br/>
Get<br/>
a Life.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean that in a mean, nasty way. I mean that to model to kids that<br/>
there&#39;s a cool world of stuff to learn and experience, we need to DO it. <br/>
What<br/>
have YOU always wanted to learn or do?  What are YOUR dreams?  Someone here<br/>
mentioned that she&#39;d love to live in Alaska, but it just isn&#39;t in the cards<br/>
for her family right now. But I bet she reads about it, watches<br/>
documentaries, and spend lots of time planning her next trips there. Her <br/>
kids<br/>
may never care about Alaska, but they&#39;ll see that Mom is a person with her<br/>
own dreams, and see how she gets tastes of Alaska in her life. They&#39;ll learn<br/>
how to apply that to their own lives.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think maybe you DO need to do stuff that&#39;s about YOU, but not having <br/>
to<br/>
do with your kids. Most of us, particularly early in unschooling, have had<br/>
those panicked moments where we blow it. This is scary stuff!  So we<br/>
apologize and move on. She may never like algebra. If she really wants to <br/>
get<br/>
to Med School, and it&#39;s a real dream for her, she&#39;ll figure out what she<br/>
needs to get there and do it.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite unschooling book isn&#39;t about unschooling or even parenting at<br/>
all. It&#39;s called Wishcraft: How to Get What You Really Want, by Barbara <br/>
Sher.<br/>
I believe if we all just raised our kids that way everyone would be happier.<br/>

questioning unschooling possibilities. I have them reading at unschooling.com <br/>
and Sandra&#39;s articles, but that was great!<br/>
