<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289312572">&quot;I still haven&#39;t found a roommate, so if you&#39;re interested, email me<br/>
privately.  Rooms are around $80-100 for one night.  We need 2 nights with<br/>
the cost split in half.<br/>

I&#39;m not absolutely sure yet, but it looks like the second room Marji booked will not be needed. I thought my sister was coming...then I thought a family here was coming, but it&#39;s not looking good. So there might be a room already reserved under Marji&#39;s name that is an extra (Do you still have that one Marji?)<br/>
I am supposed to call LeaAnn Monday to find out for sure, but if they aren&#39;t coming that would make a room available.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25838881">Thank you Ren and Marji.  If the room is available, I will use it.  I would<br/>
still like to have a roommate to defray the cost, if anyone is interested.<br/>
