They want your money. It is a competitive industry. I bet you can work <br/>
something out. Roya and lots of her friends here in California did it by <br/>
correspondence course that is approved by our Dept of Motor Vehicles - but <br/>
I don&#39;t think that it is allowed in New Mexico. Before we settled on her <br/>
doing it that way, I talked to driver ed schools. One had an interesting <br/>
way of doing it - they had class every weeknight - you had to go to a <br/>
certain number of hours of class, but they didn&#39;t care which ones. They <br/>
offered &quot;lesson 1&quot; on Mondays, &quot;Lesson 2&quot; on Tuesdays, etc. So - I asked <br/>
them, &quot;What if they only come on Mondays, won&#39;t they only get Lesson 1 over <br/>
and over?&quot; Answer: &quot;Well, yes, that&#39;s true, but the law doesn&#39;t say that <br/>
they have to actually attend all the different lessons, just that this <br/>
material has to be offered and they have to attend a certain number of hours.&quot;<br/>
