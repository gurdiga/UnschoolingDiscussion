    I had told them that if they filled the whole book up with <br/>
  writing, single sides, any writing, copying from comics or anything, and that <br/>
  I would buy that kid a video game cartridge of his or her choice.<br/>
<br/>
  Not one of them did it.  Holly&#39;s has lots of drawings.  Marty&#39;s has notes for <br/>
  a video game.  Kirby&#39;s is lost (he looked for it when he took driver&#39;s ed, <br/>
  said he had seen it when they cleaned his room the week before).  <br/>
<br/>
  Notebooks last a long time here! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

Rewards,&quot; by Alfie Kohn (sp?).  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.  Bribery isn&#39;t a good unschooling tool.<br/>
<br/>
They were starting to whine about having bad handwriting, and I figured <br/>
rather than &quot;lessons&quot; I would make a simple challenge to them with a payment <br/>
at the end.  IF they had done it, they would have been writing by the end of <br/>
120 pages or whatever it was.  They didn&#39;t.  So what I gained was they didn&#39;t <br/>
complain to me anymore about not having been taught to print or write cursive <br/>
either one.<br/>
<br/>
Holly writes more than the boys did at her age.  Marty has a notebook where <br/>
he prints in caps, small and neatly, the notes for a game he&#39;s designing.  <br/>
Holly writes a very girly, artsy mostly illegible (too artsy) cursive.  Kirby <br/>
prints tiny.  <br/>

I&#39;ve heard this suggested quite a few times though. Paying a child to do<br/>
something no one else wants to do. Or paying a child to do something they<br/>
really don&#39;t want to do but you want them to. So if it&#39;s isn&#39;t a good tool,<br/>
why suggest it??<br/>

Because sometimes it&#39;s the best tool at the moment.<br/>

forgot to say...<br/>
<br/>
Not all jobs have anything to do with unschooling and learning.<br/>
<br/>
Researchers have proven that people will work for nothing rather than just <br/>
sit around with nothing to do.   Kirby goes to work and gets paid.  That&#39;s no <br/>
crime.  Marty helps people move sometimes, and they pay him, and buy him <br/>
lunch.  His biggest benefit is hanging out with adult friends, though, and <br/>
seeing other people&#39;s housefuls of stuff, and playing truck-tetris.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a difference between paying someone to practice handwriting for his <br/>
own benefit and paying someone to strip the paint off the deck and stairs.<br/>

<br/>
We move a lot.  a LOT.  And I always look at loading the truck as playing <br/>
Tetris.   Unfortunately, my husband always loads the truck, and he sucks at <br/>
Tetris.  So we argue a lot during truck-tetris.  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
And I worked in the Fed Ex hub pushing boxes off a conveyor, and sometimes I <br/>
would put them in the containers that go in the airplanes.  And that was <br/>
container-tetris.  I would find myself putting groceries in the cart in <br/>
container-tetris fashion.  Sometimes I still do.  <br/>
<br/>
Tetris rocks!<br/>
