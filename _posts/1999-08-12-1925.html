<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342356214">I&#39;ve been lurking too much and decided I&#39;d better post something!<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of unschooling/potty training;  We are in the midst of it<br/>
right now in our house.  Emma has taken it upon herself this week to start<br/>
using the potty.  With her sister I fell into the trap of &quot;it is time&quot; and<br/>
&quot;trained&quot; her and as a result endured a lot of accidents and tears etc.  I<br/>
wasn&#39;t even going to bring the topic up for many more months when little<br/>
Emma asked one day to sit on the potty and did her thing!  She has spent<br/>
most of her at home time running around naked and has a stool in front of<br/>
the toilet so she can reach and she just goes in when she needs to.  No<br/>
accidents yesterday.  Now she&#39;s claimed ownership of that bathroom and<br/>
whenever her sister or I go in to use it she says, &quot;no! my poopa!&quot;  Lucky we<br/>
have two others!LOL<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of reading:  I got the &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy<br/>
Lessons&quot; last spring for Sarah because she was asking to learn to read.  We<br/>
did a few lessons and quite frankly, she was bored by it.  Lately I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed she is picking up words and figuring out how to sound out things on<br/>
her own.  We read a lot to her.  She just finished the &quot;Read to Me&quot; summer<br/>
reading program at the library and we read over 100 books to her since June.<br/>
Those are just the library books, we read a lot of our own too!<br/>
<br/>
On raising Spirited Children:  Sarah and I are definately Spirited.  When I<br/>
read that book when she was about 2 I had a big light bulb go on over my<br/>
head!!!  She is more extroverted whereas I am introverted.  This is<br/>
definately tiring some days.  Fortunately we&#39;ve recently had some girls her<br/>
age move into the neighborhood and she has been having daily playdates with<br/>
them.  She comes home though so wound up and full of energy it takes a while<br/>
to cool her down and regroup!  If she were in school she would probably be<br/>
given many labels; gifted in art and language, maybe ADD (she had about 14<br/>
of the traits listed) and who knows what else.  I agree about teaching your<br/>
children to respect others.  That has been our #1 lesson since she was born.<br/>
Recently I&#39;ve had older woman at church (the toughest critics!LOL) come up<br/>
to me and comment on how polite and friendly Sarah is and how considerate<br/>
she is of others.  This makes me happier than someone saying how &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>
she is etc.<br/>
<br/>
Well gee, when I come out of lurking I do it up don&#39;t I??!!!  Sorry for the<br/>
long post!<br/>
