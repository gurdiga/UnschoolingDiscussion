<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833532426">-=-You have restored (somewhat) my faith in Humanity.<br/>
<br/>
( or at least in you...)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Interesting idea, &quot;Faith in Humanity.&quot;<br/>
Disappointment in all of humanity is as bad as &quot;faith&quot; in all of  <br/>
humanity.<br/>
<br/>
I never thought of it before.  Thanks for the new thought you didn&#39;t  <br/>
mean to plant!<br/>
<br/>
==================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Oh sheesh...<br/>
<br/>
Today for the second time I&#39;ve read e-mail from a male-person who  <br/>
found my site looking for something or other and wrote to complain  <br/>
(one was only half complaining, one was QUITE a-rant).<br/>
<br/>
I had already written something up about the first e-mail and it&#39;s here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
That&#39;s a blog I hadn&#39;t told anyone about because I hadn&#39;t had time to  <br/>
think of what I wanted to say about it, but basically it&#39;s intended  <br/>
as a place to put things that are off topic or too deep or too odd  <br/>
for this list or UnschoolingDiscussion.  It&#39;s not about how  <br/>
unschooling works, but about those odd issues that come up in and  <br/>
around the discussions of unschooling.  It&#39;s for the hard stuff that  <br/>
many people think is worthless and not worth discussing.  It&#39;s for  <br/>
the stuff most people don&#39;t get or don&#39;t have time or energy to  <br/>
wonder about anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, after I wrote and posted that, I got this other e-mail.   <br/>
The topic of the other e-mail is my Dumbledore page.   That one was  <br/>
announced at unschoolinginfo.com/forum, way back.  Harry Potter  <br/>
speculation.  Don&#39;t go read it.  But someone came across it and was  <br/>
furious that I had said something right near the top that spoiled the  <br/>
book for him.  I think that because the book had been out for six  <br/>
months or more that was his problem, but still I felt bad.  I like to  <br/>
be surprised by the endings of movies others have seen already.<br/>
<br/>
So I added a long silly intro to the page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/dumbledore">http://sandradodd.com/dumbledore</a><br/>
and if you want to look at the intro, just don&#39;t read any more of it.<br/>
If you do read more of it, don&#39;t complain to me.<br/>
<br/>
But for doing that, which I did months back (this guy doesn&#39;t check  <br/>
his e-mail much!), I restored someone&#39;s faith in humanity.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Faith in humanity&quot; is one of those idiomatic expressions people use  <br/>
without dissection.  I know perfectly well what &quot;You&#39;ve restored my  <br/>
faith in humanity&quot; means, and how it&#39;s used and what it&#39;s intended to  <br/>
mean, but not until today did I see it for what it REALLY means.<br/>
<br/>
All of &quot;faith&quot; hinged on me.  My action (putting up silly photos and  <br/>
spur-of-the-moment words) changed someone&#39;s faith in humanity (so  <br/>
someone said).  I guess before I changed that webpage, faith in  <br/>
humanity had been lost.  Gone.  No faith in humanity.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s crazy!<br/>
<br/>
First, no one should have &quot;faith&quot; in humanity.  In what, ALL OF  <br/>
THEM?  ALL humans are worthy of faith?  Faith in what way--trust?   <br/>
Support?  Acceptance?  Humanity robs banks and kills people.   <br/>
Humanity abuses children and steals stereos out of cars.<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re not a team.  And if we WERE a team, neither democracy nor  <br/>
consensus would cause us all to agree and act as a single unit  <br/>
without renegades or detractors.<br/>
<br/>
So where SHOULD faith be?<br/>
<br/>
I think now (as of about fifteen minutes ago) that faith is what some  <br/>
people come to unschooling discussions to find.  They want to find  <br/>
some people in whom they can &quot;put their faith.&quot;  They have some faith  <br/>
and the urge to &quot;put it,&quot; and they look at unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
IF they  have faith, then they will... what?<br/>
Trust what EVERY unschooler says?<br/>
<br/>
And when one unschooler says something unreliable or off, then the  <br/>
person&#39;s faith is broken?  Dead?  Betrayed? Lost?<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll move this to that &quot;About Unschooling&quot; blog too.<br/>
<br/>
And while I&#39;m announcing one blog, I&#39;ll remind people of (or  <br/>
announce) another:<br/>
unschooling.blogspot.com<br/>
It&#39;s for announcements of publication of news, articles or research  <br/>
regarding unschooling or homeschooling.  I wasn&#39;t the originator of  <br/>
that one, but have power-to-post now (along with Laura Derrick, Joyce  <br/>
Fetteroll and Pam Sorooshian).<br/>
