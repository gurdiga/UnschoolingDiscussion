<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128332962">TCS chats and advocates, I think, come across very bold.  The vocal and<br/>
firm TCS supporters are undeniably honest.  I suppose this is what I<br/>
like.  It is incredibly challenging to look at one&#39;s self honestly.<br/>
Identifying unhealthy, unfounded, and imbedded forms of thinking and<br/>
trying to change these ideas is difficult, at best.  The results of<br/>
looking inward and doing the work and changing unproductive thought<br/>
patterns is liberating.  People who ask questions in a TCS forum are<br/>
searching for answers, they are opening themselves up to critical and<br/>
rational thinking in order to improve their lives and open their minds.<br/>
<br/>
I have to respectfully disagree with the following statement:<br/>
&quot;Pro-common preferences parents convey, to me, impression that they are<br/>
raising a &quot;superior&quot; brand of child by using a &quot;superior&quot; brand of<br/>
parenting..&quot;  I understand why this appears to be true.  TCS supporters,<br/>
however, don&#39;t view parenting as producing a product.  They are not<br/>
concerned with superior and inferior labels.  In fact, I would say TCS<br/>
people have to get over any kind of notion of superior to fully embrace<br/>
a TCS philosophy.  The philosophy is about embracing what is unique<br/>
about each individual.  If that means re-evaluating priorities, faith,<br/>
education, social standing, etc., they do so.<br/>
<br/>
TCS parents seem, to me, to be continually searching for a better way to<br/>
parent, a better understanding of themselves, and a way to become more<br/>
open to an array of possibilities.  I don&#39;t see TCS parents as seeing<br/>
themselves as superior.  I think most of them are trying to better<br/>
*themselves*.  When they do respond to a query in a forum, they are<br/>
trying to help other people open their own minds.  TCS parents are more<br/>
willing to look at honest criticism than any other group I have<br/>
encountered.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it sounds pretty rough when your ideas are dissected.   I, for<br/>
one, love to have my ideas challenged.  I either face the fact that they<br/>
are antiquated and work on changing, or I grow firmer in my resolve.<br/>
