<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To help me not do this anymore...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ...what parenting books do I need?  Is this TCS or<br/>
&gt; another style?  I just need to know where to start.: )<br/>

<br/>
Sandra&#39;s line on this one is, &quot;Start where you&#39;re not&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I often tell people to just start, because you have to start somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Meaning, have you considered not waiting for the right expert to tell you<br/>
something, but just live your life with a serious attempt at a different<br/>
mindset?  Maybe you&#39;re not quite ready to go there, but at some point, drop<br/>
the books, decide what kind of parent *you* are desperatly wanting to be,<br/>
and today, attempt to live it.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us grew up with our parents parenting in a way we don&#39;t care to<br/>
repeat.  I have controlling parents who thought they did it for love.  I<br/>
work so hard at not being controlling; it&#39;s what is easy and natural.  And<br/>
wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
Today, or whatever day, try considering everything from a different angle<br/>
than what you normally would.  Ask your children to be patient, Mom&#39;s<br/>
unschooling today is going to look like a lot of stop and think moments.<br/>
Heck, unless you have a child in imminent danger, you probably can afford<br/>
the time to think.  What difference is the minute or so it takes really<br/>
going to be?  It might be a greatly different life than you planned on, and<br/>
wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
I have never been much of a journal or diary person, but for homeschooling<br/>
it&#39;s helped me to periodically scribble something down.  It helps me see<br/>
where I was and where I am now, and also to see where I&#39;m going.  It lets me<br/>
write my own book, rather than seeking some expert&#39;s book.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524205308">Thank you for this.  It is so much easier for my children to unschool than it is for me.  I am a mom who was looking for the &quot;systematic approach&quot; to unschooling.lol  At least now I can laugh about it. : )  <br/>
