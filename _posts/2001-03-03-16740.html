Subject: Breastfeeding Research<br/>
<br/>
From: Stephanie Weeks, a doctoral student in social psychology at North<br/>
Carolina State University. In a message dated 2/20/1 8:33:58 AM:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This message is regarding a new study being undertaken to look at<br/>
breastfeeding practices. Unlike previous research, this study proposes to<br/>
examine breastfeeding in mainstream American women. Past studies have<br/>
largely looked at low-income mothers, adolescent mothers, and mothers in<br/>
developing nations. We want to look at mainstream American women for a<br/>
variety of reasons. One of these reasons is that this group seems to be<br/>
more committed to breastfeeding and more successful at it than other<br/>
groups. Thus, <br/>
part of our aim is to see what factors predict successful breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
I am writing to you to ask your support in obtaining women to participate<br/>
in this study. Participation requires answering a brief survey by<br/>
anonymous email. It is our hope that you will ask the members of your<br/>
respective lists to respond. The larger our final sample size, the better<br/>
we will be able to predict what engenders successful breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
The survey and instructions for completion are located at<br/>
<br/>
www4.ncsu.edu/unity/users/s/swweeks/www/breastfeeding_survey.htm<br/>
<br/>
All participants should first read the informed consent statement located<br/>
at<br/>
<br/>
www4.ncsu.edu/unity/users/s/swweeks/www/informedconsent.htm<br/>
<br/>
All responses must be received by March 5, 2001 to be included in the<br/>
study.<br/>
<br/>
Any questions should be sent to the Principal Investigator at<br/>
