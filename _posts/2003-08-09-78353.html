<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945675625">You can start with a few basic books -- the Players Handbook, Monster<br/>
Manual, Deities and Demigods, the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide -- which may<br/>
actually be at your library. There are now three different versions of the<br/>
game, but until your son starts to play with other kids it doesn&#39;t really<br/>
matter. My older son started poring over my husband&#39;s old D&D books when he<br/>
was 5, and he&#39;s been fascinated ever since. It&#39;s just this year (he&#39;s 11)<br/>
that he&#39;s found other kids to play with.<br/>

    Ask at gaming stores, comic book shops, etc. I think I&#39;ve seen books at<br/>
the card shop we go to. If you can&#39;t find any lie me know I&#39;ll take a look<br/>
here before our trip down and bring you what you want. You&#39;ll have to tell<br/>
me what to get. Looks like Lillian has a pretty good list there. My oldest<br/>
is just starting to play one. MAGE I haven&#39;t a clue but he&#39;s having fun. :-)<br/>

totally into D&D right now, and we bought the D&D guide while we were in New<br/>
Mexico.  They can learn together, I played a couple times, 20+ years ago,<br/>
with a friend helping me every step of the way.  I remember nothing.  They<br/>
can muddle through it together!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003110886">I have two major D&D fans here...Jared says you need the &quot;Player&#39;s <br/>
handbook 3.5&quot;, a set of dice for each player (unless you don&#39;t mind <br/>
sharing) and the &quot;monsters manual&quot;. Those are for learning the very <br/>
basics.<br/>
<br/>
He recommends adding &quot;Dungeon Masters guide&quot; if you actually want to <br/>
play games...somebody has to be the dungeon master, therefore it&#39;s <br/>
more fun with four or more players. That&#39;s why D&D groups are a nice <br/>
way to start. Many comic shops have D&D days. Barnes and Noble carries <br/>
some of the books too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you&#39;ll also need graph paper, pencils and erasers (Jared says <br/>
mechanical pencils are best) for playing. The Players handbook has <br/>
originals in the back for you to zerox for use in the game, but you <br/>
can also get the forms online.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, it&#39;s a fabulous game!<br/>

Borders sometimes carries a boxed set of D&D.  It is very basic, with<br/>
four two sided dungeon gameboard pieces, dice, a rule book and dungeon<br/>
masters guide, little figures, character stat cards, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It sort of takes the fun out of creating and imagining your own<br/>
character, but then again, it has been wonderful for helping my 7 year<br/>
old grasp the concepts, and he can be the dungeon master.  <br/>
<br/>
Borders stores also carry all the books you will need.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up playing D&D with friends in the basement after school and on<br/>
weekends, only to later be convinced by certain people that it was<br/>
actually a portal for Satan to take over my soul (ahem), and then just<br/>
recently given myself permission to rediscover the joy of creating a<br/>
character, pondering dungeons and traps and treasure, and learning to<br/>
play all over again.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Susan.  I bought this a few days ago to start with, but was <br/>
overwhelmed at the number of other stuff there is out there.  Today I <br/>
ordered a Players Manual and a Dungeon Masters manual, version 3.5, I think.<br/>
<br/>
**only to later be convinced by certain people that it was<br/>

<br/>
I played D&D for awhile in college because I wanted to get next to a <br/>
very cute young man, but that was about as sinful as it got. &lt;g&gt;  (My <br/>
evil stratagem was not very successful.)<br/>
