I honestly think the conference would be THE ideal situation for you---you <br/>
would be SOOO busy with all these unschoolers that you would completely forget <br/>
about that little one-month old. You *really* need to give it some more <br/>
thought---can&#39;t you see it has your name written all over it?! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

You are not only the grammar Nazi, you&#39;re the conference Nazi as well!!<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to be joining you all.  I guess we&#39;re going the other direction,<br/>
driving to the Oregon coast.  I can get all the way there (gas money) for<br/>
what the motel would cost in Columbia.  I know it&#39;s not right but I just<br/>
couldn&#39;t find enough cash in my mattress to get Dylan and I all the way<br/>
to SC from Montana.   I can rent a yurt at Cape Lookout National Park for<br/>
twenty seven dollars a night and drive, walk and cartwheel the Oregon<br/>
coast with my little son.  It&#39;ll do.   And I&#39;ll try for Kathryn&#39;s<br/>
conference next year and hope to see you there.  You can steer me away<br/>
from heartbreaking babies... maybe we can find some Basenjis...<br/>

<br/>
Maybe in September?   I&#39;m hardly ever home. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We went camping in the Big Hole and got evicted because of the threat of<br/>
fire.  That fire near Wisdom crept to within twenty miles and we were<br/>
very smokey.  We had to come out behind a pilot car  - finished up our<br/>
camping time at Georgetown. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing a lot of hiking in the Pintlars.  Just day hikes, David<br/>
was worried about bears and didn&#39;t want Dylan and I alone in our little<br/>
tent if big, bad Mr. Bear showed up.  Why on earth he thinks a bear is<br/>
more dangerous than I am I&#39;ll never know.   Bears don&#39;t eat hikers, only<br/>
campers?  Hmm... <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve seen exactly one bear this year, in Refrigerator canyon (over near<br/>
you, in that Helena direction) and he was very interested in leaving us<br/>
to ourselves.   <br/>
<br/>
David&#39;s out of work again for a while and MY HECK I&#39;m getting sick of<br/>
beans and rice, but I saved enough for a quick trip to Yellowstone<br/>
sometime this month.   Dylan has a dog sitting job this weekend but after<br/>
that we&#39;re free.   It&#39;s thirty dollars a night to pitch a tent in West,<br/>
which is crazy but our tent doesn&#39;t qualify for camping in the park.  <br/>
We&#39;ll see some bears at Grizzly discovery center, if no where else. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
When I was a foolish teen we used to hitchhike to West Yellowstone and<br/>
skinny dip in the hot springs and camp FREE anywhere there.   The times<br/>
they are a changin&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re off today to Georgetown again if it doesn&#39;t hail and sink us, we<br/>
should have some fun.  <br/>
