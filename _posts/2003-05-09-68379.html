<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339245686">This is FUN! From the book &quot;The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions&quot; <br/>
which we have out from the library (but may just have to buy)<br/>
<br/>
It makes a slick, shiny, malleable stuff, like Slime(tm) without the <br/>
stickiness. I thought we&#39;d have  probs with the color staining <br/>
things, but nope. It&#39;s just gloppy and stretchy and gooey. <br/>
<br/>
WHAT YOU WILL NEED:<br/>
Solution A<br/>
1 c. water<br/>
1 c. white glue<br/>
2 TBSP. liquid tempera paint or 7-10 drops food coloring<br/>
<br/>
Solution B<br/>
1 1/3 c. warm water<br/>
4 tsp borax laundry booster<br/>
<br/>
HOW TO CONCOCT IT:<br/>
1. Mix ingredients in solution A together in a medium bowl<br/>
2. In a second medium bowl, mix the ingredients in solution B <br/>
together until the borax is completely dissovled.<br/>
3. Slowly pour solution A into solution B (Do not mix!)<br/>
4. Roll solution A around in solution B 4-5 times<br/>
5. Lift solution A out of Solution B and knead for 2-3 minutes.<br/>
6. Store Gunk in an airtight container or plastic zip bag.<br/>
<br/>
when Robby lifted the stuff out of Solution B(step 5), it dripped <br/>
between his fingers in big globules, and was sort of sticky, but as <br/>
he kneaded it, it transformed into a sort of quivery, gooshy stuff. <br/>
He did black, but we thought a brownish red would be good. In <br/>
brownish red, the thing would look like a liver, laying there! L As <br/>
is, he has black gooey gunk, and everyone is having fun with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274434980">Thanks for posting this - it looks like fun! My daughter will love trying this- <br/>
<br/>
She had a slimy science kit that made something like this( and lots of other neat stuff). It then turned into a trip to the plastics museum in Leominster, MA. I wasn&#39;t very pro - plastics - but the museum was really cool. They had a whole program for homeschoolers with all kinds of stuff to do. They  made a sort of silly putty and a &quot;rubber&quot; ball to take home. She also explained how latex is used to make parachutes and they made their own &quot;strings&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was funny -the lady said they make the school kids leave their concoctions because they tend to get all over the bus - and balls bouncing off the bus drivers heads etc. but since our kids were homeschooled - they could take them home.(minus the parachute thing - I guess it could be toxic -)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - if anyone is near Leominster, MA it was a fun excursion. <br/>
