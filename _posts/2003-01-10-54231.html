<div id="ygrps-yiv-414529468">I need a game or activity or idea or path to follow on the subject of &quot;Seek <br/>
Beauty&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Seek Beauty is part of the Camp Fire law and we are taking each portion and <br/>
emphasizing it at the next few meetings.  It is defined in the literature as <br/>
&quot;look for the good in all things, places, people and nature&quot; (something like <br/>
that).  <br/>
<br/>
We could do crafts and focus on art, but we do crafts almost all the time.  <br/>
Will thinks we need a game, which the kids always love.  I&#39;m coming up empty. <br/>
 A game that wouldn&#39;t require a whole bunch of pieces and not storebought <br/>
would be ideal.  Websites with games ideas for learning would be great, too!<br/>
<br/>
I want the kids to get the idea that beauty is subjective in some ways, but <br/>
objective in others.  Any discussion on this topic will be helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I need it by tomorrow morning at 10:00.  ;)  <br/>

What ages are the participants.  I have a few ideas, but not sure if they are <br/>
appropiate.<br/>

I usually have most of the stuff I need in the house.  Participants are from <br/>
age 6 to 11.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507874552">Hmm, OK.. I was thinking about giving the kids those $5 disposable cameras <br/>
and taking pix of &quot;stuff&quot; .. generally not considered beautiful.. . Then of <br/>
course,  re examining the pictures to find the beauty.. BUT, that does <br/>
require a good deal of cost and time  and maybe be a bit too much for kids <br/>
that age.. SOO.. Im thinking. how about looking through magazines.. Maybe <br/>
news mags or .. heck, something that is typcially &quot;not&quot; aethestic.   HEY, how <br/>
about a treasure hunt?  The kids can look for   &quot;beautiful&quot; object in the <br/>
least likely places..   Then they can share about what makes the item <br/>
beautiful in thier eyes.. OR, even hide items for them to search for in <br/>
unlikely places..  Seeking Beauty.. that is a wonderful concept.... is a <br/>
&quot;field trip&quot; possible.. To the town dump?  ( there may be a safety issue <br/>
there)  Or maybe just through a rundown part of town.. some junked up houses <br/>
or buildings..  To me, the key in this experience is seeing beauty where you <br/>
least expect it.   I may be WAY off in your goals for this &quot;exercise&quot;  ..I am <br/>
just approaching it from what I percieve you are trying to do... Let us know <br/>
what you come up with<br/>
<br/>
Teresa<br/>
<br/>
OH. another idea.. I know you said you do a lot of crafts, but if you decide <br/>
to do crafts again, maybe try making something out of trash.  scraps of <br/>
paper, cans, containers,  broken things around your house.. That could be <br/>
cool.. Taking something &quot;disposed of&quot;  &quot;not usable&quot; and making something <br/>
beautiful out of it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545142294">Do you want a &quot;traditional&quot; board type game - or a circle type<br/>
game?<br/>
<br/>
One thing that occurred to me would be to take pictures (not<br/>
necessarily beautiful ones) from magazines, newspapers, wherever<br/>
and glue them onto more or less uniform cardstock. Put the stack<br/>
face down in the center of the group.  One player at a time takes<br/>
the top card, looks at it and describes the most beautiful thing<br/>
in the picture.<br/>
<br/>
If you want an element of competition, the card can get handed<br/>
around until no more beautiful things can be found and that<br/>
player is &quot;out&quot; - you could also use a spinner to limit the<br/>
number of passes any picture makes.  ..and you could have each<br/>
kid repeat what was identified earlier.  I have mixed emotions<br/>
about competition for that age range, but you know the kids<br/>
presumably.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873850360">What about having all the girls bring their grandmother in for the<br/>
meeting and giving them makeovers. If possible, have the grandmothers<br/>
bring along a picture of themselves when they were a child. If a child<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a grandmother to do this, she could adopt one from a<br/>
retirement home for the day.   The girls will love doing the hair and<br/>
makeup thing. They can discuss what beauty means to them now, and what<br/>
beauty meant to them when they were young, showing how the perceptions of<br/>
beauty change over time, as priorities in life change. It could be<br/>
enlightening for all involved. I wasn&#39;t sure if you needed the idea by<br/>
10:00am, or have everything prepared for 10:00am, but this may need more<br/>
planning time than you have. Just a thought.<br/>
