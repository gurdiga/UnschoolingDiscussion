<div id="ygrps-yiv-317569314">My 8yo ds wants to draw pictures of Pokemon on his wall in his new <br/>
bedroom downstairs.  I&#39;m all for it, I think it&#39;s neat and something <br/>
I wanted to do when I was his age, but my husband doesn&#39;t agree and <br/>
sees it as something that will turn into a huge disaster because then <br/>
everyone will want to write and paint on walls all over the house!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve pointed out that we&#39;d make guidelines and I feel as though our <br/>
children respect those pretty well when they understand them.  Also, <br/>
we know people who have their children&#39;s bedrooms painted in murals <br/>
by professional artists and that&#39;s o.k.  How&#39;s my son going to become <br/>
the next Michaelangelo :&gt;}<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering, any others that have let their children <br/>
have &quot;artistic freedom&quot; on their bedroom walls??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br>Well, by 8 maybe he will be able to do it and be happy enough with it to look 
<br>at it for a loooooong time. &nbsp;That wouldn&#39;t (yet?) be the case here. &nbsp;So we 
<br>have all kinds of things hung up -- one cool geometric design my daughter did 
<br>-- we took to the Office Depot and ran off &nbsp;a bunch of color copies and 
<br>strung them across the wall in a sort of big banner. &nbsp;Very pretty and bright 
<br>and original -- but not quite permanent.
<br>
<br>But that&#39;s just me. &nbsp;The walls aren&#39;t in any better shape because nothing is 
<br>permanent. &nbsp;Things are just more changeable.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065829479">My kids do have murals on their walls.  I have seen someone (magazine, tv?)<br/>
paint on a huge sheet of canvas and hang that up on hooks or with velcro.<br/>
That way it can be removed, but you can still save the artwork.  The one I<br/>
saw was as big as the wall, and it really looked like the wall itself was<br/>
painted.  -Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808174438">We were just discussing how we are going to create an &quot;art wall&quot; in our <br/>
dining room.  It&#39;s not drawing on the walls, but we are going to cover a <br/>
large piece of cork board with nice fabric that matches the dining room <br/>
&quot;theme&quot; and then buy some multicolored thumbtacks and let them go to town.  <br/>
Their own perpetual art gallery!<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you as long as you know that they will be respectful of the <br/>
boundaries. I know that my 4 yo dd would not, so therefore, we are creating <br/>
our art wall instead.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with whatever you decide.<br/>

Hi--I am new to this list. I also wanted to do this when I was young but was <br/>
never able:0) <br/>
Just recently we decided that we are going to let our kids paint on the walls <br/>
in the playroom. We will let them paint however they want but may suggest <br/>
that they leave some room to paint new pictures as they get older. My kids <br/>
are still young obviously--my oldest is 5yo. They have not painted on their <br/>
bedroom walls but I do let them hang anything they want on them (magazine <br/>
pics, their own artwork, stickers, etc.) I don&#39;t think one picture is up <br/>
straight but they love it and it&#39;s theirs!  I think your idea about setting <br/>
guidelines first is all that you&#39;ll need. Have fun :0) Merri</div>

My sister came to visit last year, and she is a terrific artist for anything....
<br>She painted all over our kids walls (new addition).&nbsp; They loved
it.&nbsp; She did most, but made sure that she gave them a spot to do their
own thing.&nbsp; It was a sort of out of the way spot, but somewhere they
could see for themselves.&nbsp; They were very proud to show anyone who
came in just what they had done, but the overall effect was wonderful.&nbsp;
The oldest at the time was 6.&nbsp; Some of it was done with foam stencils,
which even I could do!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; The oldest at 6, did his own.&nbsp;
It is <i>rather <u>creative, </u></i>but he loves it, and is very proud
of it.&nbsp; That is all that matters.....&nbsp; After all, it is only
seen by those that close his door completely.
<br>When all is said and done...and painted...it can always be painted
over.&nbsp; It is not forever.&nbsp; And......&nbsp; What we think at &quot;hmmm
not so great&quot;&nbsp; is complete and total art to them.&nbsp; That is OK!&nbsp;
Their faces, and pride in their work is worth it!!&nbsp; And.... our homes
are not supposed to be works of art...they are to reflect and enhance our
lives, right???
<br>So....Paint Away!!!!!
<br>A
<p>BTW...After my sister left, I was so inspired, I added to my daughters
room.&nbsp; Believe me, before this I would have never even considered
doing this.....</p></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57650893">Um.  My dh seems to want this house to be one of those <br/>
in a mag.  (although we still have a string of xmas <br/>
cards up in the hallway...) I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d feel <br/>
about it, basically I probably wouldn&#39;t really care as <br/>
long as I had a space that was &#39;mine&#39; that they didn&#39;t <br/>
do anything to which I didn&#39;t want.  I&#39;m lacking that <br/>
now, anyway.  When I was little, the bathroom walls <br/>
were covered in artwork, from my sis and her boyfriend, <br/>
(amazing conceptual &#39;alien-ish&#39; stuff) and jokes and <br/>
stuff.  Made sitting there a little less dull :-) and <br/>
we couldn&#39;t afford to decorate...<br/>
