<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491096264">Hi,<br/>
  Loking for resources for my 6.5yo son who is really into Greek mythology <br/>
right now. We have read the D&#39;Auliere&#39;s book and Marcia William&#39;s Greek Myths <br/>
for Young Children which he LOVED (the cartoon strip style really appealed to <br/>
him.) I&#39;m thinking that he might like to watch some videos, but he would prefer <br/>
something animated. Thanks for any suggestions!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907806615">There are some tapes we&#39;ve listened to .....oh my, what is the name of them?<br/>
I think there is at least one that was by either Jim Weiss (my first guess) or Odds Bodkin.<br/>
Odds is our favorite storyteller, but I&#39;m pretty sure Jim did the greek myth tape.<br/>
We found them at our library.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610516">My dd (6) is also really into mythology and ancient civilizations. Two<br/>
computer games she *loves* (along with dh!) are Ages of Empire and Ages of<br/>
Mythology. There a bit advanced, but dh is a pretty patient coach, and she<br/>
can play a scenario pretty independently now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yup. Completely wrong retelling but it sparked an interest in greek myths for my daughter and we spent last summer reading them. It&#39;s also meant that a little toy of Fluffy from Harry Potter has been named Cerebus and it also led to a brief interest in the solar system.<br/>
  Disney movies may suck for the most part in my mind ( I DID like Hercules though) but they prove the point that kids will take what they need and learn unexpected things from even the worst, most inaccurate sources. &#39;6 Million Years BC&#39; went a long way to proving that for me too though. Catherine loved that one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, this interest in Greek mythology actually started with an interest in <br/>
monsters and monster movies, which led to mythological craetures, which has now <br/>
led to mythology and Greek gods and godesses. There&#39;s a great Greek mythology <br/>
website for kids called Winged Sandals : <br/>

<br/>
So obviously the Ray Harryhausen masterpiece &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; is a<br/>
huge favorite, right?<br/>
