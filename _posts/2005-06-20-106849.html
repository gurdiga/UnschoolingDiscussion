Okay, to this, which was by e-mail from someone I&#39;d never heard  of:<br/>
==============================================================================<br/>
======================<br/>
 <br/>
I was just reading your articles and I had a question for you.<br/>
 <br/>
Our two girls, ages 7 and 8 1/2 are very smart and expressive. They are  <br/>
outspoken and upset when they don&#39;t get their way.<br/>
 <br/>
It always happens that when we spend a day out with them and buy them  things <br/>
or take them places, and then they may not get just one thing because  either <br/>
it is too late, or we just don&#39;t have the money - they get angry, yell,  tell <br/>
us they hate us, etc. The older one more than the younger. I end up getting  <br/>
really angry at them and try to defend our situation. Then I have told them <br/>
they  are spoiled and not grateful for everything we have tried to do for them.<br/>
 <br/>
I should add that we haven&#39;t had a lot of money lately because I have been  a <br/>
stay at home mom. Life has been miserable not being able to enjoy things the  <br/>
way we used to. But I think I am returning to work in a few weeks and I am  <br/>
afraid that now they will really be thinking they can have everything they <br/>
want.  Mostly because I am so happy to finally get some money in my hands. But I <br/>
want  to teach some values.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I need some help on how to address this problem. I know I over react. It  <br/>
really hurts my feelings. I try to talk to them about how we want to take them  <br/>
places and do things, but they have to understand we can only do so much. They  <br/>
seem to understand, but when it actually happens, they just can&#39;t be patient <br/>
or  just enjoy all the other things they had going for them throughout the  <br/>
day.<br/>
 <br/>
Any suggestions greatly appreciated.<br/>
 <br/>
===============================================<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 Are you homeschooling?  <br/>
Are you on the UnschoolingDiscussion list or AlwaysLearning?<br/>
 <br/>
If your girls are in school, the things I write might be removed from the  <br/>
realities of your life.  <br/>
 <br/>
Let me know a little more about your situation.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I can say that saying &quot;you are spoiled and ungrateful&quot; wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
recommended by anyone, I&#39;m pretty sure.  Saying &quot;That makes me wish we  hadn&#39;t gone, <br/>
because it spoiled all the fun&quot; might be closer.  Talking  about yourself is <br/>
fair.  Telling them they&#39;re bad is insult to  injury.  Should they not have felt <br/>
injured?  Maybe.  But telling  them their feelings are wrong is only going to <br/>
make it worse.<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
===============================<br/>
 <br/>
I agree. I definitely reacted in a way that I shouldn&#39;t. But they are very  <br/>
strong willed kids, very creative and have no problems expressing their  <br/>
feelings. That can be difficult at times, because they often hurt mine when they  <br/>
don&#39;t get their way.<br/>
 <br/>
No, they are not home schooled. I have to work and I don&#39;t have the  patience <br/>
to teach academics. I love the school they are in.<br/>
 <br/>
I want to teach them to enjoy the things we can do for them, but not be so  <br/>
angry when they don&#39;t get their way. I want them to learn patience. I know that <br/>
 their behavior comes from some of our behaviors as parents, it is just hard <br/>
to  recognize them when they are happening.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for your input.<br/>

<br/>
But they  are very strong willed kids, very creative and have no problems <br/>
expressing  their feelings. That can be difficult at times, because they often <br/>
hurt mine  when they don&#39;t get their way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I used to get my feelings hurt when my kids were younger, but I worked  <br/>
consciously on getting over that.  They need to have a safe place to  practice <br/>
interpersonals, and they NEED home as a haven to relax, especially as  they go to <br/>
school.<br/>
 <br/>
School is stressful.  It is a HUGE wad of not getting your way.  <br/>
 <br/>
Kids at home get lots of their parents in all kinds of ways.   Schoolkids <br/>
often get a lot of parents-backing-up-school time about homework and  bedtimes <br/>
and get-your-clothes-ready.<br/>
 <br/>
Trying to make home less school focussed might help.  Spending more  <br/>
one-on-one time with the girls might help.  <br/>
 <br/>
With my kids to keep them from being competitive at a time and dollar  level, <br/>
we purposely and early on did very different things and got them very  <br/>
different things, discussing all the while why this or that thing would be ideal  <br/>
for this particular child.  They all knew they would have special stuff and  <br/>
experiences too, so they haven&#39;t been the kinds of kids who say &quot;You spent $10  <br/>
on her, you have to spend $10 on me.&quot;   We spent time recently with a  family <br/>
that was exactly that way, but partly it might be because the dad  died a few <br/>
years ago and the kids don&#39;t have as much opportunity to be alone  with the mom.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
If you weren&#39;t invested in schooling, I could say some things about  this.  <br/>
Teaching and learning rarely happen in conjunction.  There are  things you <br/>
can&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them, but you can help them learn.  It would help  if you, at least, <br/>
would look into the difference.  If you see opportunities  through which they <br/>
can learn, and you could discuss the situation with them  without feeling <br/>
like you&#39;re &quot;teaching&quot; them, it would change your relationships  in good ways.<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s something about that:<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
My overriding guess is the kids are feeling needy and don&#39;t feel they  <br/>
should.  You don&#39;t need to discuss that with them, just give them more of  yourself, <br/>
more casual touch, more attention, more listening, more personal  cushion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638950733">I wanted to comment on some of this - I feel that sometimes my children are not &quot;thankful&quot;. There are days when I feel there is no end to their &quot;wants&quot;. I know there are times that I am not &quot;thankful&quot; inwardly..... but perhaps they are more vocal or they can somehow &quot;feel&quot; my &quot;negative unthankful-ness &quot;?  I also think that maybe in my case, I am more conscious of non-thankful behavior because I am worried about it within myself.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don &#39;t yell I hate you or anything - but I could buy them 20 things they ask for in a store and when they ask for the 21st and its like the sky is falling I will say - &quot;we&#39;ll have to wait a bit - because we have a limited budget here - if you wanted to put back something else and get this instead that would be ok&quot; . There have been other times where they have wanted something that I know I can&#39;t get this week - and I will say &quot;That would make a great b-day present for you&quot; and sometimes this is well received.  I can understand the mothers frustration with the stress of providing more and more.  Where does it end? For me one of the things I notice is that some adults - myself included do not always behave in the best possible way - and yet we somehow expect kids to behave perfectly. There is a learning curve for everyone involved. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds that the issue here is the resentment the mother is feeling - whether she wants to work or not it seems that it is motivated by the desire for material things rather then time and energy. I think it boils down to what you said about the kids being needy - and maybe they are not sure what exactly their &quot;need&quot; is but are trying to fill it with outside things. Adults often do this with shopping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know it is interesting that she is reading your pages. I am sure that there are people out there that may read them - and they aren&#39;t going to jump into unschooling overnight....and they may never... but it is sowing seeds and you never know when something you wrote may stimulate them to change their behavior.<br/>

I get non-unschoolers finding the video games page quite a bit, and a few  <br/>
have found the anti-spanking page.  I guess she was looking for info on  spoiled <br/>
children and found that article, sandradodd/spoiled.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe, though, with her kids in school, some of the suggestions I made are  <br/>
just dangerous. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m kinda joking but not totally.  I think  having a kid <br/>
in high school who doesn&#39;t have a bedtime or curfew would be  insanely <br/>
dangerous.   With my kids, though, it works great.  I  think the biggest difference is <br/>
their lack of school-assigned &quot;peers&quot; to  pressure them to get away with <br/>
more, more, more.  They just never did learn  to be sneaky.  They never felt the <br/>
anger and resentment many teens have  against their parents and other adults.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks.<br/>
What I often think when I&#39;m being patient with someone is that there is a <br/>
child on the other side of that communication whose life   might be about to <br/>
become a lot happier.   I do it for their children, and for the hope that my <br/>
children (and yours; other unschoolers&#39;) will have more adults to run into when <br/>
they&#39;re grown who were also brought up gently and happily and richly (regardless <br/>
of money--not financial riches, but a richly textured life).<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m impatient (which my detractors will tell you is ALL THE TIME), it&#39;s <br/>
when it seems the person asking the questions is unwilling to change, <br/>
uninterested in focussing on her children&#39;s happiness, and unlikely to add positively <br/>
to the group experience.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are easily swayed, either because they&#39;re insecure or they&#39;re SO <br/>
balanced on the fence that they really haven&#39;t begun to decide whether <br/>
unschooling will work for them.   When someone comes along who&#39;s honestly curious, <br/>
it&#39;s fun to answer those questions and pursue those &quot;what ifs,&quot; but when one is <br/>
hostile and defensive and seems intent on showing that unschooling is stupid, <br/>
that their children are bigger/better/smarter than the average everyday <br/>
unschoolers discussed on the list, etc., my patience evaporates in the heat.   I can <br/>
only last a little while when I feel I&#39;m assisting someone (however ind<br/>
irectly) to plant doubts and negativity in discussions that can be otherwise really <br/>
postive and hope-filled.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m moving files from two older computers to a new computer, and came across <br/>
a ten year old set of writings, chats mostly, which were once up on a time <br/>
sent out on request as &quot;The Unschooling Barrage.&quot;   I read some of a couple of <br/>
them, and remembered why &quot;the AOL days&quot; were so vibrant and lifechanging.   It <br/>
was the days before personal webpages, and sometimes the best one could hope <br/>
for was to download a text file, or to join a users&#39; group.   The message boards <br/>
at AOL were the most modern and easily accessible thing going at the time.   <br/>
Once a week I ran a two-hour live chat on unschooling.   Deb Cunefare helped <br/>
on lots of them, when they were hosted by the homeschooling forum and we (and <br/>
some others still around) were volunteering at AOL.   For each hour of work we <br/>
did, we got one free hour of AOL, which was then $3 an hour for online time.   <br/>
Then for a while I did chats for Home Education Magazine (after AOL went to a <br/>
fixed-rate and volunteering was much more frustration than it was worth).<br/>
<br/>
Not long after, AOL put people in charge of the homeschooling area who <br/>
weren&#39;t even homeschoolers at   all, and the magic all ebbed away.   But by then the <br/>
internet was accessible to lots of people, and people scattered.   <br/>
<br/>
The only reason it&#39;s related to the question of patience and motive, I <br/>
suppose, is that I was just this morning reading answers to the same kinds of <br/>
questions, but ten years ago. &lt;bwg&gt;   I&#39;m planning to make those old documents <br/>
available to read online, too.   I&#39;ll announce it here when I have them up.<br/>
