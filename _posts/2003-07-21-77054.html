incident as an example of when it was a good tool to employ. She isn&#39;t<br/>
saying she&#39;d do anything differently. She&#39;s suggesting she&#39;d do the exact<br/>
same thing even after 9 years of thought.<br/>

that spanking is a useful parenting tool.<br/>
<br/>
The incident may or may not be forgotten. Whether it is or not isn&#39;t<br/>
important. The important thing is that a philosophy or punishment *could*<br/>
cause that side effect. That&#39;s one of the things that makes that philosophy<br/>
a bad one. There are much better philosophies that don&#39;t have the potential<br/>
for psychologically damaging side effects.<br/>

She&#39;s still justifying it and saying it was necessary.  How can she <br/>
handle a regrettable situation differently next time if she still <br/>
thinks she actually handled it well to begin with?  Perhaps her kids <br/>
are older and it doesn&#39;t matter for her any more, but there are many <br/>
lurkers reading who might be forming ideas about whether spanking is <br/>
ever necessary or not, so if someone is insisting that with certain <br/>
children in certain situations spanking is necessary and good and <br/>
that&#39;s that, then I think that&#39;s very much worth debating.<br/>

do it differently if I could have that moment over again.&quot;  That <br/>

of herself and proud of the cheering crowd&#39;s applause.  She has no <br/>
apparent regrets as far as I can see.  <br/>

they felt their child was just out of control and they were afraid he&#39;d <br/>
run into traffic and they resorted to spanking him because they felt <br/>
they HAD to do something to keep him safe -- IF someone came in saying <br/>
those things - they&#39;d get our sympathy, for sure. MOST parents have <br/>
been there - almost ALL parents have swatted a kid at least a time or <br/>
two, even those who don&#39;t believe it is a good idea. Young humans are <br/>
very forgiving - they want to trust and love the adult humans around <br/>
them. You&#39;re right about that. Kids can tolerate even pretty terrible <br/>
abuse and get over it and even move on into good relationships with <br/>
their former abusers.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll all have regrets. It is part of life.<br/>
<br/>
The difference here is that Oom keeps arguing that it was the BEST <br/>
thing for her son - that there was nothing else that might have been a <br/>
better answer.<br/>
<br/>
It is annoying.<br/>
<br/>
To come to a list asking if people here really believe that no <br/>
punishment is necessary and then to argue and argue and argue and argue <br/>
that spanking children up to 4 years old is good for them -- indicates <br/>
to the rest of us that she has no interest in what people who never <br/>
punish have to say - just wants to argue. How respectful is that to <br/>
come to a list with that intention?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663181616">I have got toreply to the post about children being forgiving. I have witnessed this to be true but I have two things <br/>
<br/>
to add that make this idea hard to swallow. First I don&#39;t believe it is their job and that it is too much to put them in <br/>
<br/>
a position with our violence to have to forgive or understand us. When we act against our children they still want <br/>
<br/>
to love us but they can not see that it is our issue. They believe it is their issue, something they have caused. I <br/>
<br/>
have some highly sensitive children and the oldest has bore the brunt of my &quot;learning&quot;. She loves me of this I <br/>
<br/>
am sure just as I am equally sure that her anger and some of her intensity now is because she still carries the <br/>
<br/>
weight of abuse she received from my mistakes. She has taken my anger deep into her body and is likely <br/>
<br/>
aware of it but just because she has forgiven me does not mean it did not abuse damage even lifelong work for <br/>
<br/>
her.<br/>

it hasn&#39;t affected them and leave them with issues they have to deal <br/>
with in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Good point, Maureen!<br/>
<br/>
I know my kids have some stuff to deal with because of my mistakes. For <br/>
sure. But - still - we are learning on the job and, unfortunately, <br/>
sometimes through trial and error. We have to also forgive ourselves <br/>
and move on when we&#39;re really making progress, doing better all the <br/>
time.<br/>
