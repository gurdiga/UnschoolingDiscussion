<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004220921">Hi ~<br/>
   I let my son (7) quit his guitar lessons today. <br/>
(He also takes piano, which he is PASSIONATE about).<br/>
   <br/>
   We talked together yesterday and he said that he LIKES the guitar but <br/>
doesn&#39;t like having to go to LESSONS. But he doesn&#39;t want his teacher to be <br/>
mad...or sad. <br/>
Not a good enough reason to keep taking lessons to me &lt;&lt;G&gt;.<br/>
    <br/>
  I told him I would still get him the new guitar ( the next step up) and <br/>
that he can play when he WANTS to. I also told him his teacher said anytime he <br/>
wants to learn a few more songs he would fit him in. <br/>
His teacher&#39;s advice was above all &quot;to love music&quot;.<br/>
    <br/>
   Chad was beaming, and I could feel an even closer bond between us. I <br/>
LISTENED to him and RESPECTED him. ( A few months ago I would have encouraged him <br/>
to continue until summer).<br/>
     <br/>
   I told him we will keep the guitar accessible, as well as bring down the <br/>
other instruments that are in the back of the upstairs closet , and he can play <br/>
them when HE chooses. ( Thanks Rue!)<br/>
     <br/>
  He just called to me from upstairs and said &quot;Mom ,you know that new guitar? <br/>
Can I pay half with my own money?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 ~Marcia ..who is VERY sure she made the right decision..   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112402688">I would agree that you and he have made a good decision! I hope he continues to enjoy the piano, and the guitar and any other instruments he may later decide to learn!<br/>
