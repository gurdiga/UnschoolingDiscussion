<div id="ygrps-yiv-898942318">Thank you Thea!  It was such a surprise!  We haven&#39;t worked too awfully hard<br/>
at making sure the rest of the world knows we are here.  Serving the current<br/>
unschooling community has been our focus, and of course  will remain our<br/>
primary focus.  Still though, it was great to be noticed by someone else!<br/>

child of 7 needs to know about the holocaust. Of course if she was<br/>
interested I would do it.<br/>
<br/>
The holocaust is the hostory of unimaginable terror. unless there is a<br/>
reason for her to learn it I would wait. At 7 isaac was learning bits and<br/>
pieces about the holocaust. it is introduced in the jewish religion very<br/>
early. we have many references to it in our prayer books. SO the word was<br/>
familiar to him. I answered the questions slowly but did not give out more<br/>
info then he needed at the time. I do not yet think he needs to see the<br/>
pictures of starving children or the mass graves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742635045">IMHO, I&#39;d introduce her to the topic of diaries & Anne Frank.  (my 6 yo is <br/>
very hands on type learner-can&#39;t grasp tragedies such as war, slavery & <br/>
murder, etc)  My MIL has a porcelain replica of the Anne Frank house.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677105682">Kathie, why would you want to introduce this topic to a child of seven?  I<br/>
can hardly assimilate the enormity of this part of history.  A 7 year old<br/>
will be defenseless in coping with these kind of events.   I see no reason<br/>
to ask her to deal with this.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest child ran into the topic at nearly 12.  She had friends visiting<br/>
us and we lived near DC at the time.  They had planned a trip to the<br/>
Holocaust museum.  Sara went and she literally walked around the house in a<br/>
daze for 3 solid days.  It took months to process what she had been exposed<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
I agree the kids should be exposed, but 7 seems way to little, to tender to<br/>
me.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kathie, then I would take her resistance as a sign that she&#39;s really not<br/>
ready for this on a deep level.   Trust the children to know what they are<br/>
ready for, even if it&#39;s just surface level knowledge to you.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned before about my daughter spending 3 days in a daze over her trip<br/>
to the Holocaust museum.  This had an interesing legacy for us.  From that<br/>
point on I could use it as an example of being exposed to something that was<br/>
beyond her.  We talked quite a bit about not being able to go back to *not<br/>
knowing*.    There have been times in her life since where I would say, once<br/>
you do this you won&#39;t ever not know again.... things like dates/boys/drugs/<br/>
and other adult issues.  Each time it&#39;s been her deicion, but I have seen<br/>
her choose to hang on to her little girlhood and choose to NOT KNOW<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
I think she&#39;s telling you she wants to stay a little girl for now.  You<br/>
should trust her.<br/>
