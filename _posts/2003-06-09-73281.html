&gt; <br/>
&gt; I laugh about that every time!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the last year or so, since my husband has been away a lot and I&#39;m getting<br/>
more adventerous about food, Tim and I have been trying out new restaurants.<br/>
We order one thing and try it, and if we like it, we get more or something<br/>
else, or whatever.  Occasionally the food comes and we look at each other<br/>
and whisper, &quot;What IS that?&quot; and giggle.  Sometimes he&#39;ll take the first<br/>
taste and tell me, &quot;You can try it if you want to, but it&#39;s awful.&quot;  I<br/>
almost always do try it.  Sometimes it is awful!<br/>
<br/>
Today we were at an International festival in Frankfurt and decided to try<br/>
out the Egyptian food booth.  We got the sampler plate, and several things<br/>
we both poked at a bit before summoning the courage to try them.  I liked<br/>
most of it, but I definitely need to bring peanut butter to Egypt for Tim if<br/>
we ever go there!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
