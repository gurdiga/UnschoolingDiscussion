<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052381989">I&#39;m asking this more out of curiosity than panic, wondering if anyone has experience to share.&nbsp;<p></p><div><br></div><div>My youngest turned eight yesterday and he doesn&#39;t know how old he is. As far as I can remember, he&#39;s never known. We tell him, and two second later it&#39;s gone from his memory. He knows his full name, my full name and my husband&#39;s, the street city and state where we live... just not his age.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It isn&#39;t a problem -- the only time it might be an issue is our library&#39;s policy about unattended children. Kids six and under found without a parent will be escorted to the police station next door, so even though he&#39;s more than old enough and capable enough to start picking out his own books while I&#39;m getting our reserves, I don&#39;t feel comfortable letting him head for the children&#39;s section alone. &nbsp;He&#39;s very tiny (was a premie) and most moms guess he&#39;s a lot younger than he is. I&#39;ve asked the librarians what they&#39;d do about a child who looks too young and they&#39;d ask him his age. So we&#39;d be fine if he didn&#39;t get that deer in the headlights look. Probably fine even if he did, since most of the librarians know us, but I don&#39;t want to borrow trouble just in case. It easy enough to keep him close to me or a sibling who can answer for him.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It seems like every little kid I&#39;ve ever been around was proud to announce their age. Mine absolutely doesn&#39;t care. Which might not be a totally bad thing, since the kids he finds to play with at the park are his size but a lot younger. I don&#39;t think my son has ever realized that he&#39;s so small for his size.</div><div><br></div><div>Honestly, I don&#39;t know how old I am unless I stop and do the math, so I know it&#39;s less and less important as we age. &nbsp;And I&#39;ve also considered the fact that he might know exactly how old he is and just enjoy messing with us.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Michelle&nbsp;</div></div>
