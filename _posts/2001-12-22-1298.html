 </span></blockquote>We did a Buggy tour when we were in Lancaster county a few years ago, and the <br/>
Mennonite driver told us a lot about Amish and Mennonite beliefs. Quite a few <br/>
Amish people have phones in little booths OUTSIDE their homes. In addition, <br/>
they can ride in cars, just not drive them. The kids are (generally) schooled <br/>
in private one room schools through the eighth grade, then they are home <br/>
working and learning more important stuff.  Their homes are often pretty <br/>
luxurious, complete with convenient appliances using power that is not <br/>
attached to electrical power lines.<br/>
<br/>
Amish don&#39;t use computers generally, though.<br/>

about 20 minutes from Amish country and in the summer go there regularly for <br/>
produce, fresh meat and chicken and egggs. I met an old lady this summer <br/>
while buying potatoes who took me into her garden for me to have whatever I <br/>
wanted . . .onions, cucumbers, etc. . . the food was so good. There is also a <br/>
sect of Amish. . . I forget their name (not Mennonite) that do have phones  <br/>
in the house. I will ask my daughter because I am sure she remembers it. <br/>
<br/>
living in abundance<br/>

I cannot judge my own path and SELF, having the knowledge that I have chosen <br/>
to come here to experience these specific issues and grow, learn, and <br/>
Remember Who I Am.<br/>
