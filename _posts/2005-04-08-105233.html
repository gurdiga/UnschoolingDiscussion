<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181334494">Hi<br/>
    Thought this might be of concern to you, it starts about half way <br/>

Opposed<br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s anything like the database proposed in the UK it will have <br/>
tentacles everywhere and will infringe privacy much more than it <br/>
actually states it will.<br/>
