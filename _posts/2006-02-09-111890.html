<div id="ygrps-yiv-716127383">&quot;I&#39;m all for talking naturally around children and using &quot;real<br/>
words&quot;, but there&#39;s absolutely no need to &quot;limit yourself&quot;. Thank<br/>
heavens Dr. Seuss didn&#39;t!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about Shakespeare?!! Wow...talk about creative use of language.<br/>
The man used made-up words in his work all the time...and they became<br/>
part of our language and are now in the dictionary! Cool.<br/>
Here&#39;s a bit about him: <br/>

I remember calling those pajamas that cover your feet and zip up,<br/>
&quot;chubbies&quot; when we were kids. We still call them that and laugh at our<br/>
made-up word.:)  One of my favorite Jalen sayings is &quot;bird leaves&quot;<br/>
which is really a &quot;feather&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849945085">&quot;Those are real words in another language. But some of the words they<br/>
&quot;know&quot; were combinations of English and Farsi and those are very<br/>
precious to us - my oldest used to have a &quot;khirs-bear&quot; - khirs is<br/>
bear in Farsi, so that&#39;s really saying &quot;bear bear.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend in high school whose parents were linguists. They lived<br/>
and studied in Africa when Colin was very little (toddler ages).<br/>
Living in a more remote area, none of the tribe spoke english. When<br/>
Colin and a wee tribe member became friends, they formed their own<br/>
pigeon language, a combination of English and whatever language that<br/>
child knew ( I don&#39;t remember).  Colin didn&#39;t use this language with<br/>
anyone but that child. He instinctively knew that his parents spoke<br/>
English, the rest of the tribe spoke another language and this child<br/>
and himself had their very own language.<br/>
<br/>
We use Spanish words here and there. It&#39;s fun and sometimes it has<br/>
more impact than the English equivilent (when I say &quot;escuche!&quot;, Jalen<br/>
is way more likely to listen to me).<br/>
