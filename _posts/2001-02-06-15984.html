&lt;&lt; I think you were right to share that with the list Sandra.  Things get <br/>
 really nasty when personal attacks occur.  If it started on the list, it <br/>
 should be kept on the list unless otherwise invited to take it off list.  <br/>
 Taking it off list without the other&#39;s permission is harassment and invasion <br/>
 of privacy, imho.<br/>

are similar. On others they are far apart. In any case, I think it is <br/>
inappropriate to email anyone off-list without permission. If you stand <br/>
behind what you say, then say it to the whole list. If you think it is <br/>
off-topic, which is almost nothing here, then *ask* if that person wishes to <br/>
participate in an offlist discussion. Anonymity does not excuse disrespect.</div>
