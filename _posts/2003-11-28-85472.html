<div id="ygrps-yiv-869769199">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
As you may remember, we&#39;re pretty new to unschooling (2-3 weeks).  One of the <br/>
deciding factors that helped me take the plunge and pull Fisher (age 6) out <br/>
of school was that he was acting like he felt that he had no time of his own.  <br/>
For instance, a friend at church invited him to go to her house and stamp, <br/>
something he loves to do with her.  He agreed.  But the day of the event, he <br/>
cried and negotiated with us for nearly an hour before finally agreeing to go -- I <br/>
would have let him out of it, but I knew she&#39;d gone to considerable trouble <br/>
to have snacks and stamping materials available, and I felt it would be rude to <br/>
cancel last minute.  (You can tell me if you disagree -- it was a very hard <br/>
call as I tried to find the balance between respecting him and respecting <br/>
others.  The friend was an adult and might have understood, but still would have <br/>
definitely been disappointed.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I figured as we left school behind, this behavior would resolve <br/>
itself.  But it hasn&#39;t, at least not yet.  Nearly every time we&#39;ve been scheduled <br/>
to get together with family or friends over the past couple weeks, he&#39;s put up <br/>
a lot of resistance right when we need to be getting out the door.  I let him <br/>
know that it&#39;s okay to feel as he feels, but we have other people counting on <br/>
us and it would be rude to back out now.  I often give him input on the <br/>
planning, or at least give him plenty of notice (usually with reminders the day <br/>
before and then a few hours before).  I try to remind him that outside of these <br/>
get-togethers (which we are trying to keep to a minimum, in deference to his <br/>
desire to be at home), he can follow his own interests to his heart&#39;s content, <br/>
that now he has plenty of time to be at home and that time is not going to run <br/>
out.  When I asked him (at a time other than when we were trying to leave) if <br/>
he can tell me why he&#39;s not wanting to go places, he just said that he can&#39;t <br/>
explain. <br/>
<br/>
Everything else is going great -- we&#39;re having a great time together, <br/>
learning and getting excited about everything from Scooby-Doo (him) to the deer in <br/>
the backyard (me) and all kinds of other things (both of us).  Do I just need to <br/>
give this more time, or am I missing a piece of the puzzle?  (Or both?  Or <br/>
neither? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
Thanks in advance-<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy<br/>

the book, &quot;The Highly Sensitive Person&quot;?  <br/>

<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve learned is that he can handle about one outing a week <br/>
pretty well, but more than that is too much.  So if someone invites <br/>
us to go to their house on a Tuesday, the other 6 days of the week <br/>
have to be spent at home for the most part.  Little trips to the <br/>
grocery store here and there are usually ok.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that helps me is that he&#39;s one of three kids, so if <br/>
someone invites us to something and he doesn&#39;t go, I can go, <br/>
apologize that he&#39;s not there but at least the rest of us are so it&#39;s <br/>
not as big of a deal that one of us is missing. <br/>

<br/>
Jayn (4) is like this sometimes, and yet usually enjoys the event once we<br/>
get there. I try to limit the other-than-us activities to one-on-one<br/>
playdates, since she has scheduled a Park Day and a Dance class weekly - my<br/>
dh says she needs more socializing opportunities sometimes. I think her<br/>
reasons for fussing are about not being in control of the transition from<br/>
one mode (playing at home) to another. I also thinks she takes after her<br/>
father - doesn&#39;t mind doing less liked stuff as long as she gets to grumble<br/>
about it. (LOL) One thing that I tried with her, is to say &quot;let&#39;s drive<br/>
over, but if you still don&#39;t want to do it, we&#39;ll go home again.&quot; I said<br/>
this with ice skating, and ultimately she decided she really didn&#39;t want to<br/>
skate any more just now. Sometimes she gets dressed in the car also, since<br/>
changing her clothes is one of the challenges to her ability to transition -<br/>
unless she&#39;s playing dress up of course!<br/>
<br/>
However I suspect the issue with your son might be related to the need to<br/>
deschool for longer. (which is why I chose the snip above) It may be that he<br/>
is still expecting to be sent back, or hasn&#39;t grasped just how much free<br/>
time he has at home now. 2-3 weeks is a very short time really. Maybe he&#39;s<br/>
not ready to share you just yet? Maybe he&#39;s seeing scheduled activities of<br/>
any sort - even enjoyable crafting stuff - as being school like, with<br/>
expectations and judgments. Maybe I&#39;m reading too much into your<br/>
description. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Amy, your son sounds like he might have some personality in common with <br/>
my eight-year-old, Eric. Eric likes to spend most of his time at home, <br/>
preferably in his underwear :-) The problem comes when his two brothers <br/>
want to go out and he refuses.<br/>
<br/>
I find I have to give him lots of warning about outings. I remind him on <br/>
the morning when he gets up and let him know exactly when we will be <br/>
leaving. We don&#39;t have a car, so if we have to catch the bus I get us all <br/>
ready early if I can because he hates to be rushed and him resisting makes <br/>
me tense so we all end up unhappy. He might decide he hates the socks he <br/>
has on, or his jacket is annoying, or he can&#39;t get his shoes on exactly <br/>
right, so I like to have lots of time to calmly help him get ready.<br/>
<br/>
I do sometimes tell him we are going when he doesn&#39;t want to go. In the <br/>
case of your friend who was going to stamp with your son, I would have <br/>
convinced Eric to go just as you did. We don&#39;t go out a lot through the <br/>
week, now, just gym day, library, usually a visit to a friend&#39;s house. In <br/>
the summer he would go to the beach quite happily most of the time. We <br/>
usually have another family over once a week or so and he enjoys that.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest son, Simon, age 4, likes to go out and stay out - he never <br/>
wants to go home. I often take him out on at least one weekend day when his <br/>
Dad is home. We go to the library drop-in program, the farmer&#39;s market, <br/>
Discovery centre, a park when the weather is good, shopping - just about <br/>
anywhere.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286727582">I wanted to add my opinion that most children in school know they have no <br/>
choice but to go to school, day after day, no matter how much they dislike <br/>
it. When they learn they can say no to things, that they can choose not to <br/>
go to places and events they don&#39;t want to attend, there might be a lot of <br/>
refusal :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Fisher needs a good long time of refusing before he will say yes <br/>
again, or maybe his true nature is coming through and he is a person who is <br/>
content doing his own thing at home most of the time.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Do I just need to <br/>
give this more time, or am I missing a piece of the puzzle? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing both.<br/>
Give it LOTS more time, and give him time to grow up and through different <br/>
stages of maturity.  He&#39;s really young.  <br/>
<br/>
Is here something he wants to be doing more of at home?  Is he afraid he&#39;ll <br/>
miss something at home?   <br/>
<br/>
It helps Holly if she knows the day before what she&#39;s going to wear, which <br/>
jacket looks good with it, what time she&#39;s leaving, who&#39;s driving, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It helps Marty to wake up over an hour before, and to arrange his stuff at <br/>
the house so that he feels really ready to go.  <br/>
<br/>
Would it help Fisher to do two things?  And errand on the way to the <br/>
get-together?  It might seem more &quot;worth it&quot; to go if the desination is one of two or <br/>
three places, and not just a foreign/other thing that&#39;s pulling him out of his <br/>
nest.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing, based on things my kids have balked at in years past.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I get the feeling it&#39;s something like this that&#39;s missing -- we&#39;re <br/>
working toward finding that piece that will help him feel in control of his part <br/>
of the situation.  He has certain TV shows that he wants to watch everyday, so <br/>
I always make sure we tape those if there&#39;s any chance we&#39;ll be gone during <br/>
them.  And it may be that he&#39;s not willing to share his papa and me with others <br/>
yet -- he already has to share with his baby brother, a still-new experience <br/>
in his life.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel better hearing that others have kids like this -- I don&#39;t know any in <br/>
&quot;real life,&quot; so I feel like I keep having to explain (&quot;no thanks, Fisher <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel like playing today, or tomorrow, or this week -- try us in a year or <br/>
two&quot; &lt;g&gt;)  On a personal level, I get it -- I&#39;m a total homebody myself.  But <br/>
he&#39;s always been a very sunny kid (though very clear on his own tasks and <br/>
interests) -- I guess I was scared that he was becoming &quot;anti-social.&quot;  Old <br/>
homeschooling fears arising, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the input, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
