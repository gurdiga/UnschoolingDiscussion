<div id="ygrps-yiv-934104974">Hi all,<br/>
My name is Heidi and I am the unschooling mom of three, ages 10, 8 and<br/>
1.  I jsut joined and I know I&#39;m supposed to lurk for a while and see if<br/>
this is where I belong but I&#39;m already sure that it is.<br/>
<br/>
My immediate concern is the fact that I have a 10 year old who is still<br/>
not reading.  I am hanging on by my fingernails waiting for the<br/>
lightning bolt of compregension to hit her.  She knows &quot;how&quot; to read (ie<br/>
she can sound out words and recognize a few on their own) but she<br/>
steadfastly refuses to spend any time really getting comfortable with<br/>
it.  She LOVES to be read to.  She is outrageously creative<br/>
artistically.  She enjoys physical persuits (karate, fencing, biking<br/>
swimming...).  I know this kids wants to read btu she wants the magic<br/>
wand method of learning and I can&#39;t find it.  My concern is that her<br/>
self esteem is now getting involved.  Other people assume that she can<br/>
read and it is going to get increasingly difficult to cover the fact<br/>
that she can&#39;t (or more accurately, won&#39;t).  Of course this pushes all<br/>
my buttons because one of my issues on the self-improvement front is to<br/>
let go of others&#39; expectations.  AARGH&gt;  This is such a tough place to<br/>
be in.  I want her to maintain all her self confidence but I don&#39;t want<br/>
to teach her to cave to the expectations of others.<br/>
<br/>
You are all saved from further rambling by a crying baby.<br/>
<br/>
TIA for any advice!<br/>

Holly turned 11 in November.   It was only around then that she said when she <br/>
walks into a room she sees words and reads them the second she sees them.  <br/>
Like the names of books or the month on the calendar, or the labels on boxes.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still not reading &quot;chapter books&quot; with enough speed to make her happy.  <br/>
She&#39;s working on The Boxcar Children, but slowly.  She&#39;s reading Harry Potter <br/>
cards, though, and pretty fluently.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is such a tough place to<br/>
be in.  I want her to maintain all her self confidence but I don&#39;t want<br/>
to teach her to cave to the expectations of others.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;(snipped)but she<br/>

&gt;it.  She LOVES to be read to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, so have you considered NOT asking her to spend time getting <br/>
comfortable with reading and just keep reading to her?  Books on CD are <br/>
really good too.  We do a lot of those.  Read the signs while driving down <br/>
the street.  Read billboards out loud.  License plates.  Bumper <br/>
stickers.  Activate the CC (closed caption) option on the TV.  Watch <br/>
spanish language stations that are CC&#39;d and try to pronounce THAT out loud <br/>
(we aren&#39;t spanish speakers here and it gets pretty silly sometimes.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let her go with you to the library (don&#39;t force it) while you choose books <br/>
on karate, fencing, biking, swimming, stained glass, painting, etc that YOU <br/>
will enjoy, then take them home and read them to yourself.  If she asks, <br/>
read to her.  Make it so tasty that maybe she&#39;ll want to spend some time <br/>
with them, but don&#39;t ask her to or require her to or suggest she might want <br/>
to...  etc.  I mean, you want her reading to be her-powered, not <br/>
you-powered, eh?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   My concern is that her<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you do to &#39;cover&#39;?  I like the line, &quot;Oh, he&#39;s so busy with <br/>
building remote control gliders that he doesn&#39;t bother much with books <br/>
yet.  Have you ever built a remote control glider from scratch?  ... <br/>
etc.&quot;  or, &quot;We&#39;re following the Nordic tradition where kids are taught to <br/>
read at a much later age.  It&#39;s so effective that way.  Higher literacy <br/>
rates in Norway than just about anywhere else, wouldn&#39;t you know <br/>
it...&quot;  Blow it right back at them.<br/>
<br/>

to have others second-guessing you or your child...<br/>
... but are you very sure that she&#39;s not trying to live up to *your* <br/>
expectations of her needing to be able to read because it&#39;s getting hard to <br/>
cover in front of other folks?  I mean, it&#39;s an awareness point to take a <br/>
look at.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I know this kids wants to read btu she wants the magic wand method of <br/>
&gt;&gt;learning and I can&#39;t find it.&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;)))))))))    Okay maybe not. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But I do have a son who was a later reader. His magic wand was to be left <br/>
alone to understand it at his own pace. I read to him, provided him with <br/>
lots of books, magazines and comics, got him books on tape and answered any <br/>
reading question he had without making it a big deal. I told him he didn&#39;t <br/>
have to sound out or read aloud to show anyone he could read. Comics from <br/>
the newspaper were his best tool. He wanted to be able to read them and he&#39;d <br/>
ask for words all the timew. After awhile he didn&#39;t ask so many, now he <br/>
hardly asks at all.<br/>
<br/>
I would reassure her that *when* she learns the rest of the tricks of <br/>
reading is no big deal because you&#39;re confident she will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636443311">I have found the late reader stories very reassuring, but I wonder if there<br/>
are very many unschooling early readers?<br/>
<br/>
My first dd learned to read pretty easily at 6 1/2, but we were not<br/>
unschooling then.  It was my first year HS and I was homeschooling<br/>
kindergarten.  If I had thought school at home was critical, I would have<br/>
failed very quickly.  We had no set schedule, and when I think back on it, I<br/>
realize that reading was the one thing I really focused on, because I<br/>
figured that the most important thing in kindergarten was learning letter<br/>
sounds.  (I think differently now, but that is where I was then.)   I had<br/>
always read a lot to her, ever since she was an infant.  I also often read<br/>
to myself while she nursed.  I also talked to her a lot.  I know that isn&#39;t<br/>
unusual, but one of my parenting things said it is important to talk to<br/>
babies, so I would talk about anything just to be saying words aloud to this<br/>
little person who didn&#39;t talk yet.  &quot;Now mommy is putting the plate in the<br/>
cupboard.&quot;  She was an early talker too, one of those who used complete<br/>
sentences by age two, so I do think that she is a more verbal person anyway,<br/>
and that might be one reason why reading came easier to her?  Anyway, she<br/>
was reading on her own before I had a chance to teach her much phonics<br/>
beyond a few basic consonant and vowel sounds, so she helped me to see that<br/>
some kids can learn to read with very little direct instruction.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have a point here?  I guess I&#39;m just wondering if the bell curve for<br/>
reading is much higher than what the schools think.  It seems that schools<br/>
expect all kids to read by second grade or age 7 or 8, yet many stories I<br/>
hear of kids who never had &quot;school&quot; (whether at home or at school) actually<br/>
do tend to read much later.  Or are there lots of early unschooled readers<br/>
too, and we just aren&#39;t hearing those stories?<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the answer is that there is a very broad range of when kids<br/>
acquire the skills needed to read, and we tend to think of the ages in the<br/>
middle of the curve as being normal, when the outliers are normal too, just<br/>
not as common.<br/>

try to help by listing off the later readers they know who are doing well<br/>
now.  Those fretting parents don&#39;t really need to hear about the early<br/>
readers, and the parents of the early readers aren&#39;t usually fretting about<br/>
it.<br/>

<br/>
There are some, but I&#39;m SURE the school&#39;s curve is set around seven instead <br/>
of around nine or ten where it should be.<br/>
<br/>
There are thousands and millions of things schools could teach non-readers so <br/>
that by the time they&#39;re reading they would have something real to read <br/>
about.  But they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Another curve and factor to look at might be how many unschoolers will end up <br/>
being NON-readers.  We know that the schools&#39; labelling and pushing and <br/>
shaming creates non readers.  There are people who hate books, and refuse to <br/>
read unless they &quot;have to.&quot;  I don&#39;t think unschooling has the tools to do <br/>
that.  School uses those tools on every student.   Some are just resilient.<br/>

too, and we just aren&#39;t hearing those stories?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My 3 youngest have always been unschooled. They are 8,7 and 2. For a while <br/>
when the middle ones were almost 5 and 6, they started doing this program I <br/>
had leftover from my oldest. It was phonics stuff. They enjoyed it and did <br/>
it maybe 2-3 times a week. They also loved workbook stuff. Like finding <br/>
ending or beginning sounds to pictures on the sheets. They were going along <br/>
so well and seemed to enjoy it so much that I thought they would be reading <br/>
very soon. This all lasted for about a month and a half. The phonics program <br/>
was the first to go. That lasted about 2 weeks. They slowed down a bit on <br/>
the worksheets and finally stopped those altogether. They had been doing <br/>
them maybe twice a week. When they finished what they had, they said they <br/>
didn&#39;t want to do anymore. At this same time, I was hearing about other <br/>
unschoolers who had very late readers by school standards. I also had a <br/>
friend who&#39;s son wasn&#39;t reading yet at 12 and wasn&#39;t concerned at all. The <br/>
more I heard, the more I figured to be ready not to freak if our kids did <br/>
the same. I was actually okay with it and asked my husband how he would feel <br/>
if the kids weren&#39;t reading at the age of 12. He said as long as they could <br/>
read at 18, he would be okay with it. I knew we&#39;d be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since then, the kids haven&#39;t done one worksheet or book or program. My <br/>
son and daughter just both turned 8 and 7 and both are reading. My son reads <br/>
a bit faster than my daughter but both do well enough to read like a Boxcar <br/>
kids book and even the info books they have let alone all the golden books <br/>
and such they read to the baby. I still read to both of them anyway. They <br/>
love for me to read the Boxcar books to them just because it&#39;s more fun to <br/>
have me read. And I always do. I can&#39;t say I taught them to read at all. <br/>
Somewhere along the line they picked it up themselves. I saw it start with <br/>
their Pokemon cards and it went from there. Next was the video games on the <br/>
playstation and road signs. I was very ready for them to not be reading. <br/>
Made sure no relatives made them feel bad about it either. We were very <br/>
relaxed around here with them reading or not reading. They have no idea <br/>
about when kids &quot;should&quot; be reading either. My kids really don&#39;t get school <br/>
at all and don&#39;t understand what is expected of them. They have no friends <br/>
that go to school. So I think some kids will get it earlier and some will <br/>
get it later. Same as if they were in school but then again the schools <br/>
don&#39;t really give them that chance. My kids are actually reading sooner than <br/>
I expected.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of think about it like potty training. (I hate that term) You can <br/>
start a baby early and you can get them to do it. You can coax them a bit <br/>
and have them either do it or fight back and not do it all. You can leave <br/>
them alone and they either do it when they &quot;should&quot; or do it a lot later. 3 <br/>
of my kids have been in the later category so maybe that&#39;s why I don&#39;t sweat <br/>
other stuff they &quot;should&quot; know.<br/>

skipped bits...&#39;Mummy, read ALL the story!&#39;<br/>
The thing is, when they got to school, the school taught phonetics. Judged this way my kids couldn&#39;t read. They had no idea how to break words up or what sounds letters made so the teacher started them<br/>
with early readers and other boring stuff. When I explained that they could read, and even had Heather read a passage out of the daily newspaper, the teacher told me it was the *wrong* sort of reading<br/>
and that Heather would have to go back to the beginning and learn letters.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034865772">I just finshed a heated disscussion with my mom about my little brother (he&#39;s 9 and attends p.s) he loves/loved to read as long as he has chosen the book, but in his class he has a list of pre-aproved books that he has to choose one a month from. He just fininshed the 4th Harry Potter book, by the end of it he was in tears and begging to not have to finish it, but the school requires it. In fact they require 3 hrs. a day of reading, outside of school, for points and the only books that count are on this list that the teacher/school has deemed acceptable. It makes me sick. My little bro, a year ago was reading anyhting and everything and now he&#39;s crying because he can&#39;t read Captain Underpants and Choose Your Own Adventures anymore because they arn&#39;t good enough. AAAAAAHHHHHGGGGHHHH!!!!  <br/>
Sorry about that, I just get so mad, that his love of books and reading is being squashed and my mom is letting it happen, and she sits here and tells me that it is for his own good and that if I was smart I would put Jaiden and Avery in school because the teachers really want what is best for the kids and they&#39;ll learn so much more, and don&#39;t I wan&#39;t some time for myself?<br/>

I watch him 3 days a week, he get&#39;s to be a kid here. I don&#39;t make him read. He can if he want&#39;s to, or I&#39;ll read it to him, although, that&#39;s aginst the rules... I love being a rule breaker &lt;beg&gt;<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
  I just finshed a heated disscussion with my mom about my little brother (he&#39;s 9 and attends p.s) he loves/loved to read as long as he has chosen the book, but in his class he has a list of pre-aproved books that he has to choose one a month from. He just fininshed the 4th Harry Potter book, by the end of it he was in tears and begging to not have to finish it, but the school requires it. In fact they require 3 hrs. a day of reading, outside of school, for points and the only books that count are on this list that the teacher/school has deemed acceptable. It makes me sick. My little bro, a year ago was reading anyhting and everything and now he&#39;s crying because he can&#39;t read Captain Underpants and Choose Your Own Adventures anymore because they arn&#39;t good enough. AAAAAAHHHHHGGGGHHHH!!!!  <br/>
  Sorry about that, I just get so mad, that his love of books and reading is being squashed and my mom is letting it happen, and she sits here and tells me that it is for his own good and that if I was smart I would put Jaiden and Avery in school because the teachers really want what is best for the kids and they&#39;ll learn so much more, and don&#39;t I wan&#39;t some time for myself?<br/>

I&#39;m not sure if any where or not, but we scour the thrift stores on a weekly <br/>

About Lone Wolf books for Kirby...<br/>
He&#39;s asleep and has an 8:30 staff meeting at work, but I&#39;ll try to remember <br/>
to update the list we had at one time.    We bought some online at one time.  <br/>
I bet they&#39;re even much easier to find now.  I should just try there and not <br/>
burden people with thrift store lists!!<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ll try to put a list here.  Thanks!<br/>

Kidnap him and take him to the library.  CHILDREN&#39;S section.  Send your mom<br/>
a<br/>
cute letter with words cut out of obvious Harry Potter posters and ads<br/>
saying<br/>
she can&#39;t have him back until she remembers what bad things school did to<br/>
her, and you.<br/>
<br/>
Then take him home in time for dinner. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yep, and thats at home, that 3 hours a day doesn&#39;t count the time he has to<br/>
read at school, OR all of the other homework he has to do. He&#39;s in 4th grade<br/>
and has more homework than Jason(dh) does, and he&#39;s going to collage.<br/>
I watch him 3 days a week, he get&#39;s to be a kid here. I don&#39;t make him read.<br/>
He can if he want&#39;s to, or I&#39;ll read it to him, although, that&#39;s aginst the<br/>
rules... I love being a rule breaker &lt;beg&gt;<br/>

should read whatever interested you--she had a class FULL of kids reading. My <br/>
eight grade teacher did NOT. He required us to read:<br/>
Death Be Not Proud<br/>
A Separate Peace<br/>
Lost Horizons<br/>
Puddinhead Wilson<br/>
Great Expectations<br/>
Assorted Shakespeare among others<br/>
<br/>
With his 50 vocabulary words a week (placate, mollify, assuage, pacify, <br/>
mitigate, allay), HIS reading, and his damned grammar workbooks, I didn&#39;t <br/>
have TIME to read my own books.The SOB even made me hate TWAIN! (for a while)<br/>

That&#39;s very sad about your brother. I know. I&#39;ve been there!<br/>
