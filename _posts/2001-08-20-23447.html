<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205794652">Hi everyone! For those interested, I wanted to send out some updated <br/>
information about the L.L.G. - Lifetime Learners of Georgia <br/>
Homeschooling Support Group. We are starting up 4 new Area Groups, <br/>
bringing us to 10 total area groups that we hope will be of great <br/>
help to homeschoolers in Georgia! Below is a listing of all our Area <br/>
Groups including the 4 new ones. The *new* Area Groups will <br/>
officially be starting up in September though we already have some <br/>
members for all of them. Also included is a little information about <br/>
the L.L.G. Group. If you have any questions about our group, please <br/>
feel free to contact me! :)<br/>

The L.L.G. Homeschooling Support Group caters to the diverse society <br/>
we live in, and all homeschooling families are welcome! However, our <br/>
members prefer their religious and political beliefs not be a part of <br/>
the group&#39;s identity and purpose. We are in no way related with the <br/>
Secular Humanists, nor are we anti-Christian, or any other religious <br/>
or political belief, in any way. Our group is an eclectic mix of many <br/>
personal religious and political beliefs. Our main focus is to <br/>
support learning lifestyles.<br/>
<br/>
As the group grows, we plan to continue incorporating many resources <br/>
for our members. These resources include: Weekly Social Days, a <br/>
Member&#39;s Only Website (with Monthly Event Calendars and other <br/>
happenings within the group), our Monthly Newsletter, an &quot;Older Youth <br/>
Group&quot;, Group 4-H Club, Youth Book Clubs, Monthly Homeschooling <br/>
Information Night, Special group classes for youth members, field <br/>
trips, other events and activities, and more!  Field Trips are <br/>
usually geared towards all age groups, however some events will be of <br/>
more interest to one age group than another. Children of all ages are <br/>
welcome in our group! <br/>
<br/>
Our group also meets year round so feel free to join us at any time!<br/>
<br/>
Each Area Group within L.L.G. has their own Monthly Calendar of <br/>
Events that includes Social Days, Field Trips, and Classes, as well <br/>
as any special events done by that Area Group. The Older Youth Group, <br/>
4-H Clubs, Book Clubs, Special Classes, and a variety of other <br/>
activities, are open to all members of L.L.G. regardless of your Area <br/>
Group.<br/>
<br/>
To cover the costs of mailings, printings, and other expenses <br/>
involved with maintaining the Support Group, we do collect a Yearly <br/>
Membership Fee in the amount of $20. If you are interested in <br/>
becoming a Member of the Lifetime Learners of Georgia Homeschooling <br/>
Support Group, you can find an application for the group on our <br/>
website at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://llg.freeyellow.com/postalmemin.html">http://llg.freeyellow.com/postalmemin.html</a> , or you may <br/>
call or email me your postal mailing address to receive one.  Again, <br/>
if you have any questions about our Support Group, please feel free <br/>
to call or email me.  <br/>
