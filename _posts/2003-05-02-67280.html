&lt;&lt;Mary,<br/>
It&#39;s about a boy&#39;s &quot;camp&quot;, kinda like a detention camp for wayward boys.<br/>
Their punishment is to dig holes every day.  It sounds like it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
much of a storyline huh?  LOL  That&#39;s what I said before my kids insisted we<br/>
go see the movie.  They had both read the book & couldn&#39;t wait for the<br/>
movie.  I have to say, I was entertained myself!  Especially not knowing the<br/>
whole plot - it was pretty interesting - lots of stuff to figure out.  The<br/>
book & movie are marketed toward the &quot;tweens&quot; but I really enjoyed the<br/>
movie, and plan to read the book now!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was somehow getting the idea it was a scary movie. Is that wrong? I&#39;ll<br/>
have to go and look it up. I had forgotten about it recently. I&#39;ll have to<br/>
see if it sounds like something Joseph would like. What was more enjoyable,<br/>
the book or movie?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631806916">It is a &quot;disturbing&quot; story - and suspenseful, but not really scary.<br/>
<br/>
The book is absolutely wonderfully crafted - I&#39;d definitely read it BEFORE seeing the movie, just so as not to already know what is going to happen. <br/>

  Anybody see Holes yet?  Lars wants to see it.  We both liked the book.  It&#39;s<br/>
  gotten good reviews on my children&#39;s writing list.  The author wrote the<br/>
  screenplay.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; We saw it last week.. The kids loved it.. They hadn&#39;t read the book, but<br/>
  now<br/>
  they want to.  We are going back sometime soon with DH and Landon&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been meaning to ask about this movie. I&#39;m not familiar with the book<br/>
  and when the kids saw the preview for the movie, they were intrigued. Both<br/>
  with the movie and book. What&#39;s it about in general?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The &quot;wardens&quot; at the camp are cruel to the boys.   The other campers are mean <br/>
to the newcomers.   Nothing bloody or real graphic, mostly verbal abuse.   <br/>
(OH, Anna just reminded me.. there was one &quot;bloody moment&quot;... a bad scratch)  <br/>
  I think the PG-13 rating is right on.   It&#39;s really  a judgment call for <br/>
each parent depending on how much your child your child can handle.   My <br/>
kids, 8, 11 and 13 really liked it.   In reality, it&#39;s no more cruel or <br/>
violent than most animated Disney Movies,  it&#39;s just that the folks are real, <br/>
and not &quot;cartoons&quot;.  Which brings me to the point I never really understood <br/>
about Disney( and other animated) movies.  All the animated ones ( I think) <br/>
are rated G.. But some of them are VERY scary for kids.  If they were &quot;rea;&quot; <br/>
people, I know they would be rated PG for PG-13.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647155307">Mary, the kids said the book was better (of course, aren&#39;t they usually?).  I haven&#39;t read the book yet, so I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s not a scary movie - not in the horror-movie kind of way anyway.  It&#39;s more of a mystery - who did what, why they did it, what are their motives?<br/>
