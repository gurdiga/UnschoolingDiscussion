<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783685603">This thread makes me think of a concern I sometimes wonder about. At what <br/>
age (your children&#39;s age) should parents cover up? We both sleep in the <br/>
buff, except for when I was weaning my youngest, and the boys often come in <br/>
as we&#39;re waking up a getting in the shower. I&#39;m comfortable with this, but <br/>
wonder if it will cause problems later on. (At least they will have a <br/>
realistic picture of the average female body!) I remember reading about <br/>
fathers should stay covered because little boys may compare the size of <br/>
their penis and think they are lacking and this could set them up for <br/>
inadequacy issues. But then I also think that in some cultures nudity was <br/>
not issue.<br/>
<br/>
What are your opinions?<br/>

particularly careful about not being nekkid around my kids.  All three <br/>
of them at about age 9 started looking away out of politenes (not <br/>
embarrassment).<br/>
