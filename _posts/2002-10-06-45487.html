I blame him, for his self-centeredness, and inability to anyone elses needs beyond his own.  And he gets to have more children.  It is frightening....<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

  How about a remedy for a selfish, totally unsupportive husband??  Her <br/>
  husband had never even *changed a diaper*. From what I&#39;ve read, it was all <br/>
  about him, and what he wanted.  I know that when my three (only three!) kids <br/>
  were little I felt like there was nothing I could do well.  That gets better <br/>
  with time, but this woman had NO BREAKS.  Don&#39;t get me started...<br/>

  &gt;The hormones that were causing post partum depression could have been<br/>
  &gt;cured.  There are homeopathic remedies that treat people with post<br/>
  &gt;partum depression and even remedies that treat people who feel that<br/>
  &gt;there is something wrong with their children so they should kill<br/>
  &gt;them.<br/>
