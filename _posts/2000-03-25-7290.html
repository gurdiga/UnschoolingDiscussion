<br/>
Here&#39;s a great Microsoft joke I got from my brother (he runs with scissors <br/>
also):<br/>
<br/>
At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the <br/>
computer industry with the auto industry and stated, &quot;(i)f GM had kept up <br/>
with the technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving <br/>
$25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon.&quot;<br/>
In response to Bill&#39;s comments, General Motors issued a press release <br/>
stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be <br/>
driving cars with the following characteristics:<br/>
1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.<br/>
2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a <br/>
new car.<br/>
3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would <br/>
have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off <br/>
the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For <br/>
some reason you would simply accept this.<br/>
4. Occasionally, executing maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car <br/>
to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall <br/>
the engine.<br/>
5. Only one person at a time could use the car unless you bought &quot;CarNT,&quot; but <br/>
then you would have to buy more seats.<br/>
6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five <br/>
times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but it would only run on five <br/>
percent of the roads.<br/>
7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would all be <br/>
replaced by a single &quot;general protection fault&quot; warning light.<br/>
8. New seats would force everyone to have the same sized butt.<br/>
9. The airbag system would ask &quot;are you sure?&quot; before deploying.<br/>
10. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, you car would lock you out and <br/>
refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned <br/>
the key and grabbed hold of the antenna.<br/>
11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand <br/>
McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need nor <br/>
want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the cars <br/>
performance to diminish by 50 percent or more. Moreover, GM would become a <br/>
target for investigation by the Justice Department.<br/>
12. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to <br/>
drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same <br/>
manner as the old car.<br/>
13. You&#39;d have to press the &quot;start&quot; button to turn the engine off.<br/>
