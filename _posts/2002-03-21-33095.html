&gt; <br/>
&gt; But an idea *can* be way off-track (does that equal BAD?) while the person<br/>
&gt; stating it is still fabulous. I, for one, have had some real dillies<br/>
&gt; (lulu&#39;s?) in my lifetime. Is my saying, &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea&quot;,<br/>
&gt; a BAD idea?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends on how you say it.  If I said &quot;Mary, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good<br/>
idea&quot; you would most likely have one reaction.  If I said &quot;Mary,<br/>
that is the most ridiculous, stupid idea I&#39;ve heard in my life!&quot; I think <br/>
you&#39;d have a different reaction - and you probably wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>
share your ideas with me again or you&#39;d do so guardedly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it better to let less than stellar ideas float around on this list to be<br/>
&gt; seen and maybe utilized by 100&#39;s of lurkers and posters? Or is it better to<br/>
&gt; challenge an idea that may be off-base, or could be done easier or better?<br/>
&gt; For me, having to really think and tweak my ideas and beliefs has been<br/>
&gt; enlightening.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Challenging ideas without also making snide comments about the person <br/>
expressing those ideas is a good thing(tm) in my opinion.  By snide<br/>
comments I mean things like spelling or grammar corrections in a thread<br/>
not related to those, and generalizing put-downs of people who have <br/>
*those* ideas. If the challenge is expressed with respect for the person <br/>
who has those less than stellar ideas, it could and hopefully would<br/>
encourage dialog between members of this community.  I would like to<br/>
see seekers welcome here.  Some of them may not understand they are<br/>
mistaken (in their core practices).  Challenging them with a &quot;but you&#39;re<br/>
not an unschooler - go find an eclectic list&quot; will most likely mean<br/>
they leave or a major fight ensues or both. Putting people on the<br/>
defensive is not the best way to help them see where changes might<br/>
be made in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;That is the cycle this conversation and list seemed to have gone through.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Letting it slide from one.. and then getting messages from the moderator<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;from another. Very interesting dynamics.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How do we know who is, and isn&#39;t, getting a moderator note? Is it posted<br/>
&gt; somewhere?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>As one of the moderators, I&#39;d like to keep that between individuals rather<br/>
than letting the whole list know.  Maybe it would help to post the warning<br/>
to the list but it seems way too punitive to me!  One of the reasons I<br/>
became a moderator is that I&#39;d like to see this list move so that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t need one.  I&#39;ve been on-line a long, long time and I firmly<br/>
believe in self-policing lists.  I&#39;m talking with some friends who have<br/>
been on-line as long or longer than me about what is necessary to achieve<br/>
that!  One key ingredient we have identified is respect for others<br/>
and their opinions; if that is missing, it will be impossible.  I may<br/>
not agree with someone but they have the right to express themselves.<br/>
And I will fight so their voice isn&#39;t silenced. Voltaire summed it up well IMO.<br/>
A person may not engage in a debate the way I&#39;d wish; they might not<br/>
cite sources when requested; they may make snide sarcastic comments.<br/>
But none of those mean they should be silenced.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;Style, no style. Differing opinions does not include putting another&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;down.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is questioning someone&#39;s firmly held belief putting someone<br/>
&gt; down?(&lt;----note: real question, not attempting to be argumentative. :o))<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this is a real answer, not an argumentative one!&lt;g&gt;  It depends on the<br/>
phrasing.  Saying &quot;why do you believe the world is flat?&quot; is one way;<br/>
saying &quot;why are you stupid enough to ignore all the scientific evidence<br/>
about the shape of the world?&quot; is another.  I&#39;m trying to come up with<br/>
obviously extreme examples here - there are a lot of ways to ask a question.<br/>
Some of them will be perceived as a put-down, others won&#39;t.  That perception<br/>
will most likely depend on how people are feeling and what is going on<br/>
in their life at that point in time too which makes it even more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I have more to say but I need to get off-line and do things with my<br/>
children.  I would be happy to continue a dialog on this topic with<br/>
anyone who wants to participate!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen that happen here quite a few times, and those people have stuck <br/>
around and learned.  I really enjoy this debate about what unschooling is <br/>
and is not, and I&#39;ve learned from it.  If we can keep the &quot;That&#39;s not <br/>
unschooling&quot; on a general rather than personal level, we should be able to <br/>
debate it without hurting anyone&#39;s feelings.  And those who don&#39;t want to <br/>
take part in it don&#39;t have to.<br/>

This is true only if the moderators are perfect and unbiased.  I <br/>
personally would prefer that &quot;nudges&quot; be public because then there is <br/>
less of a chance of a misguided nudge doing harm unnoticed.<br/>
