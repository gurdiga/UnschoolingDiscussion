<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243217866">Oh dear. I think I am becoming a radical unschooler.....<br/>
I have a 9yr old grandson.  I had to go to the local school the other <br/>
day - nothing to do with grandson - but while there i saw him in the <br/>
library with his class, wearing his new glasses.  I watched him for a <br/>
while before going over to him very quietly whispering how cool he <br/>
looked in his glasses and then got on with my job at hand.<br/>
The teacher *glared* at me......<br/>
My grandson was not the vibrant - fun loving - happy - pied piper he <br/>
is at home.  He sat there (even before he saw me) very subdue, almost <br/>
in fear.<br/>
I wanted to run to my daughter - in - law and say &quot;HOMESCHOOL _ <br/>
HOMESCHOOL.before school robs him of his identity.&quot;  And this from a <br/>
VERY new Homeschooler.......<br/>
