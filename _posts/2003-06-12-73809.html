&gt; Thank you Barb, my biggest thing is that I&#39;m just plain scared to drive with<br/>
&gt; 4 kids all by myself.  Plus I don&#39;t like to drive and get sleepy headed<br/>
&gt; after 3-4 hours.   When&#39;s the deadline for the family rate? </span></blockquote></div>

Yes, August 19th. My birthday! &lt;g&gt; 43.  The Early Bird Deadline is over, but <br/>
regular registration is until August 19th. You can still register at the door, <br/>
but then the price is per person. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Barb!<br/>
