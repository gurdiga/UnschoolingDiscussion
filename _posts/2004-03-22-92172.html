<div id="ygrps-yiv-438351538">I&#39;m sending this along not because it sounds like unschooling, but it sounds <br/>
like something some of you might be interested in for one reason or another.   <br/>
Some new homeschoolers haven&#39;t been around unschooling input of many kinds, <br/>
and this could be interesting for them.     MAYBE just maybe there are <br/>
unschoolers there too.  Maybe some of them would like to know unschooling&#39;s out here.<br/>

Dear Home School Group,<br/>
<br/>
I would like to invite your group members to a weekly home schooling open <br/>
house held in a Talking Communities voice web conferencing room. Participants <br/>
from around the world will be able to share web projects, curriculum, ideas, <br/>
experiences and home schooling products. The conferences will be a family <br/>
oriented, moderated environment.<br/>
<br/>
Please join us every Wednesday from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM Pacific Standard Time.<br/>
To enter go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://events.talkingcommunities.com">http://events.talkingcommunities.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Future possibilities for conferences may include actual training sessions, <br/>
vendor demonstrations or rooms for home school children to interact with each <br/>
other. I will look for recommendations and suggestions from the participants at <br/>
our meetings.<br/>
<br/>
I am frequently on-line and available to answer any questions that you may <br/>
have. Please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me by email or in person.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
Bob Zwick<br/>
