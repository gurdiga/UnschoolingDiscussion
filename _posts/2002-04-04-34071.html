<div id="ygrps-yiv-85091451">My son is nine.  He wanted to join the local homeschool band.  We <br/>
said &quot;yes&quot;, he chose to play snare drums, we paid the band fee, <br/>
rental fees, and as he asked for lessons, signed him up, and of <br/>
course paid for the lessons.  After a few lessons, he wanted to quit <br/>
lessons, so we let him.  After a couple of months of band, he wanted <br/>
to quit, and so we let him.  After seeing his sister perform with the <br/>
band at the winter concert he wanted to join again.  The director <br/>
said &quot;no&quot; as he would be too far behind the &quot;beginner&quot; group, but <br/>
suggested that he rent drums again and practice on his own until the <br/>
beginner band starts again in September.  She suggested that if he <br/>
was beyond &quot;beginner&quot; by that time, he could play w/ the &quot;advanced&quot; <br/>
band.  <br/>
<br/>
Soooooooo, what do we do?  Do we incur the expenses of drums all over <br/>
again?  When parents pay for lessons / equipment rental / buy <br/>
uniforms etc., is it reasonable to require our children to practice?  <br/>
My unschooling gut says &quot;no&quot;, it needs to come from the child, <br/>
whether it&#39;s practice, or finishing a session / class that has been <br/>
paid for.  But I must admit, I feel frustrated with the expense (we <br/>
have three children) and with the &quot;I want to do it - I don&#39;t like it <br/>
anymore - I want to try it again&quot; roller coaster.  This has happened <br/>
with both of our older children in many different activities - <br/>
soccer, gymnastics, drama, bowling, guitar, violin, piano, science <br/>
classes, and the list goes on!<br/>
<br/>
And it isn&#39;t just trying an activity and deciding it&#39;s not their cup <br/>
of tea - after quitting for a while, they will often want to rejoin <br/>
that same activity.  I&#39;ve noticed other recurring situations as <br/>
well.  My daughter loves singing & acting (she is ten), but if she is <br/>
engrossed in an activity e.g. computer game, reading a book, playing <br/>
barbies, she will downright throw a tantrum about going to choir or <br/>
acting class (which she begged to join - and often talks excitedly <br/>
about after class!).  <br/>
<br/>
And what about the children who are along for the ride in the car as <br/>
one child attends their particular activity?  How much of this is <br/>
reasonable or sane?  I want to honor and respect their moods, and <br/>
support what they are interested in learning about, but... this feels <br/>
a bit indulgent for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any and all suggestions  regarding this topic - <br/>
especially as to how unschoolers handle similar situations!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m interested to hear the responses to this because I am also a newbie and <br/>
have been wondering about this very thing. It seems to me that one of the <br/>
things you learn in life is that when you make a commitment (having a pet, <br/>
peace corps, getting married, having children, whatever) there are going to <br/>
be times you wish you could take a break from it, or step aside, or even <br/>
quit, but the end result is valuable enough that you want to sustain through <br/>
the rough patches so you get to that end result.<br/>
<br/>
My mother had me in piano lessons from 4 to 16. There were times I wanted to <br/>
quit, hated it, rebelled against practicing, etc. but now that I&#39;m an adult <br/>
I see that it was worth that half hour a day (when I could have been talking <br/>
on the phone or watching television, which seemed VERY important to me as a <br/>
12-year-old) to be able to sit down at a piano and play whatever I want.<br/>
<br/>
My parents exposed me to a bajillion different activities as a young kid, <br/>
and let me pick which ones I wanted to pursue (with the exception of piano <br/>
and swimming, which were mandatory to a competence level). I chose horses, <br/>
and eventually they bought me a horse. However, there was a lot of <br/>
discussion of &quot;when you get this horse...&quot; to clarify that the horse meant a <br/>
commitment. I couldn&#39;t have turned up the next day saying I didn&#39;t much care <br/>
for horses after all. I mean, I suppose I could have, but it wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
been well received. There were lots of days where I would rather not have <br/>
had the responsibility -- but I learned that the long term benefits were <br/>
worth the short term irritation of winter days and cleaning tack, etc. <br/>
Actually there was never ever a moment where I wanted to quit horses - I was <br/>
in love. And I blame this on the fact that they let me really explore LOTS <br/>
of different things on a short term, no-commitment basis, before making a <br/>
commitment to one.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess my feelings about this are mixed. I hate the idea of the parent <br/>
actualizing his/her own dreams through the child -- making him play football <br/>
or the violin or whatever because the parent wants him to. On the other <br/>
hand, I wouldn&#39;t want to let my child drift from thing to thing, quitting <br/>
whenever it got difficult or bothersome. There are lots of things in life <br/>
that have moments of difficulty or irritation, when you wish you could bag <br/>
it. Having a child not the least of these! But if it&#39;s your passion, you <br/>
persevere. I guess putting the time in at the outset to let the kid find his <br/>
real passion (for me it was horses) will save agony with indecision later -- <br/>
but there are some things (like the piano lessons for me) that a child just <br/>
may not be able to see long term benefits of, and should be taught that you <br/>
stay with it and persevere regardless of your feelings at the time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hate to see a child learn to approach commitment with the idea that you <br/>
can always quit if you don&#39;t feel like it one day. But I&#39;m just a novice, so <br/>
feel free to cheerfully disregard!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646926014">Thanks Bonni,<br/>
<br/>
This is a great suggestion for our family - since activities outside <br/>
the home do affect everyone in one way or another.  <br/>
<br/>
My dh was raised by a single mom who struggled to make ends meet - he <br/>
washed the same pair of jeans every night for school the next day - <br/>
so he about goes into cardiac arrest over the <br/>
whole &quot;quitting/starting multiple activities&quot; issue.  He perceives it <br/>
as waste.  <br/>
<br/>
A family meeting might allow us to come up with something we can all <br/>
live with!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977181047">We are going through very similar things at times. At the moment, it is braces. Her grandmother offered to pay for them, she decided she wanted to do it and is about 5 months into it. At this point, she is re-evaulating that decision. And I support that. Her grandmother may get very upset with her if she decides to take them off. But it is Lil&#39;s body and life, and ultimately, her choice as to what she does. <br/>
<br/>
She has decided she didn&#39;t like a few things she has tried and she has stopped and we really had no big deal over it. If I were doing an activity and I didn&#39;t like it, I would quit as well. I think the best we can do is share with them what we would do in that situation, if they ask (and my daughter almost always ask this question). She recently had been asked to go on a trip with someone to the Bahamas, which she scheduled to go and we bought an airline ticket. Then, a class that she had been waiting for on songwriting was scheduled for the day she was to leave. She agonized over it for over a week, and decided to forgo the trip and do the class. We will lose some money on the ticket, perhaps all of it if we don&#39;t take a trip to the Bahama&#39;s in the next year. I will consider it an expensive but probably well worth it class. But it is something she values greatly, and she gave up something she really wanted to do as well. I think it was a great experience and opportunity in making decisions and how that process works. . . .something very valuable to learn I think. I think each experience presents to us an opportunity. It may not be the exact one we were thinking of, but always one is there.<br/>

Well, I know it isn&#39;t a very prevalent opinion, but I don&#39;t believe that being made to sit down and practice everyday is the right way to go. I also can sit down at the piano and play whatever I want, and I also regularly play at church, etc. I will even brag a bit and say that I am a very good piano player. However, I was never forced to practice - in fact, I never even took a lesson. I totally unschooled myself in this regard. I read a few lesson books and taught myself to play, because I loved it. I did practice a lot, but only when I felt like it (which might have at times been everyday, and at other times might have been pushing it at once a month - with a couple of years in there of no piano at all), and only because I enjoyed it. I never did the &#39;right&#39; exercises, etc, I just played what I wanted to play. And now, at 29 years of age, I play just as well as my best friend who was forced her whole life to take lessons and practice, and who now teaches others how to play for money. <br/>
I really am just wondering how many people that think that they can only play now due to all of the &#39;forced practicing&#39; of their youth would have been able to play just as well without it? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Well, I took lessons for many years. I don&#39;t ever remember being forced to practice. I loved it so much that I just played all the time. I still play now and have never stopped. In college I used to tromp about a mile or so to these little practice rooms they had for music students (I was not one) and play for hours. My brother did not like it as much I don&#39;t think. . .he really wasn&#39;t a natural at it and he does not play anymore. I have two other brothers who never took lessons but they love to play music and still do. It goes back to what your passion is . . . if you have a passion for something you will do it whether you are taking lessons or not. At least thats what it seems like to me.<br/>

I don&#39;t think anyone truly &quot;learns&quot; by being forced to do anything, they may memorize things... I taught myself the piano as well, although just a small sample of songs. One day when we actually have a piano in the house, I will teach myself more.<br/>

the Joy of It by Stephanie Judy.  I *highly* recommend it.  She even has a <br/>
section - I think it&#39;s in the appendix - on how to help someone train their <br/>
ear.  Unless a person actually speaks in a complete monotone, they are not <br/>
tone deaf.  They simply haven&#39;t trained their ear to hear the differences <br/>
in notes.  Some people come by that naturally, but anyone who isn&#39;t <br/>
actually tone deaf can learn it.<br/>

read it straight through.  You just flip to the sections that interest <br/>

convey meaning? (Many words have the exact same pronounciation and the<br/>
meaning is conveyed through the tone.) So are there some Chinese people<br/>
who&#39;ve grown up with Chinese who can&#39;t understand Chinese?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps tone deafness has been totally eliminated from the Chinese people<br/>
since someone who couldn&#39;t understand wasn&#39;t likely to mate and reproduce.<br/>
So that thought exercise is no help at all ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The kids who start out in Suzuki having their instruments tuned by the <br/>
teacher or parent eventually learn to hear it themselves.  Better to start <br/>
out playing an instrument that&#39;s in tune, and gradually learning to hear <br/>
when it isn&#39;t, than to try to learn to play a string instrument that&#39;s out <br/>
of tune.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, perfect pitch is completely unnecessary and often gets in the <br/>
way.  Imagine having perfect pitch and trying to transpose something.  It <br/>
sounds completely wrong to someone with perfect pitch. (All perfect pitch <br/>
is, is being able to say what note is playing or sing a specific note, <br/>
without any reference note.  What&#39;s needed to play most instruments is <br/>
relative pitch, being able to hear a note in relation to another note.)<br/>

the A string to the oboe, tuning fork or electronic tuner.  Then they play <br/>
two strings together and listen or feel for the beating that happens when <br/>
the strings are not in tune with each other.  (I don&#39;t quite understand the <br/>
physics involved.)  The farther out of tune the strings are, the wider the <br/>
beating.  When they&#39;re in tune, it goes away.  That said, I haven&#39;t been <br/>

that I&#39;m playing the same (harmonic) note on both strings.<br/>

With the violin, you &quot;feel&quot; the tune in your fingers.  The dulcimer is a bit<br/>
tricky because you have three strings that are the same and one that is<br/>
different and you normally use a bar to play, and not your fingers across<br/>
the strings.<br/>

&gt; &gt;There is still hope, Bridget.  Tuning is also hands-on and I&#39;ve had<br/>
success<br/>
&gt; &gt;(violin, dulcimer) and so has hubby (guitar [6, 12 and bass], saxophone)<br/>
&gt; &gt;with teaching people how to tune that are kenetic, visual or textile<br/>
&gt; &gt;learners.  He does all tuning by ear with a final using the piano.  I use<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt;tuning fork.  You can learn to tune by feel (vibrations) if not by<br/>
hearing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;It takes a little longer but it can be done and quite successfully.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; String (non-fretted anyway) players do that almost exclusively.  They tune<br/>
&gt; the A string to the oboe, tuning fork or electronic tuner.  Then they play<br/>
&gt; two strings together and listen or feel for the beating that happens when<br/>
&gt; the strings are not in tune with each other.  (I don&#39;t quite understand<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; physics involved.)  The farther out of tune the strings are, the wider the<br/>
&gt; beating.  When they&#39;re in tune, it goes away.  That said, I haven&#39;t been<br/>
&gt; able to learn how to do it yet on the cello.  I tune using harmonics, so<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;m playing the same (harmonic) note on both strings.<br/>

&gt; Guess what, Bridget.  You&#39;ve just described me!  &lt;g&gt;  And I play <br/>
French <br/>
&gt; horn and cello. . . . in tune.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I&#39;m *not* suggesting that you should develop your relative <br/>
pitch, just <br/>
&gt; that if it was still a burning desire of yours, you could.<br/>

dah if they do it slowly.  If they carried keyers around with them I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get it, it&#39;s the electronic noises I can&#39;t distinguish.  But <br/>
it still wouldn&#39;t matter &#39;cause I don&#39;t pry into their secrets.<br/>
