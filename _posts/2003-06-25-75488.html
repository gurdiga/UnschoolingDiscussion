&gt; Julian!&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What about sweets?  If a kid is eating cake and cookies he&#39;s getting<br/>
&gt; sugar but he&#39;s also getting flour and oil, which are in bread and other<br/>
&gt; foods, and unless you&#39;re vegan, milk and/or eggs which are considered by<br/>
&gt; some to be food products in their own right.  Maybe they&#39;re getting<br/>
&gt; peanut butter or oatmeal, too. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly!  And he eats a lot of other things too, not JUST sugary treats. But, <br/>
in fact, I&#39;ve never seen him sit and eat sugar. Honey. Maple syrup. But <br/>
refined sugar, no. And in restaurants with it sitting there, he mostly wants to <br/>
play table football with the packets.<br/>
