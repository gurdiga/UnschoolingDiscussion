&gt;I don&#39;t know whether if you put it right out here on this list if <br/>
&gt;that would make it less desireable for HEM, or if Helen and Mark <br/>
&gt;have decided they can&#39;t use it or what.  But I would put it where <br/>
&gt;those really serious about considering video games as real and good <br/>
&gt;could find it easily.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I guess I need to clarify here. We have a firm policy of only <br/>
publishing articles which have not appeared elsewhere in print or <br/>
online - so publishing it on a website would totally remove it from <br/>
our consideration, as we do not accept reprints or second rights to <br/>
work which has appeared previously in any format. After publication <br/>
the author is free to do whatever they want to with their writing (we <br/>
only buy first publication rights), but we work hard to make sure <br/>
everything that appears in Home Education Magazine hasn&#39;t already <br/>
appeared anywhere else, online or off.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a writer myself, and was a writer long before I was an editor, so <br/>
when it came time to decide on editorial policy it was my writer-side <br/>
that made the relevant decisions about rights. Even when we decide to <br/>
re-use a writer&#39;s work from HEM, as we did in The Homeschool Reader, <br/>
we pay to reprint the articles as just a rightful part of the <br/>
production costs. Too many publications treat writers like some kind <br/>
of disposable commodity, probably figuring there are always more <br/>
where they came from. As a writer I&#39;ve never agreed to sell all <br/>
rights, and in fact many publications which say they only purchase <br/>
all rights will often back off and agree to other arrangements if a <br/>
writer refuses to sell their rights.<br/>
