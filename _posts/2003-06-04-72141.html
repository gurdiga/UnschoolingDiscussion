<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; My parents used to live on Cudjoe,. . . . Cool place :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oooooh, creepy name.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For someone from far away who never heard of it, it sounds like a place where<br/>
&gt; snarling, barking, unnaturally big and hairy vines grow that attack at night.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my husband did his counselling intership, he was called out one night<br/>
to place a child who refused to go home because of some major problem.<br/>
Anway, the police called Alan in to take the report and deliver her to the<br/>
foster home.<br/>
<br/>
The place was at 666 Bloody Gulch Road.  Alan said he about fell over when<br/>
he read the name, and the poor girl looked terrified when they turned onto<br/>
the road.  His supervisor told him later that they were really a great<br/>
foster family, though.<br/>
