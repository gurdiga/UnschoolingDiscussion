<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357411234">Hello, unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I am tip-toeing out of lurkdom here for several reasons.  I have been <br/>
lurking here for a little while and I have read many of the posts with great <br/>
interest.<br/>
<br/>
Let me introduce us.  I am Marsha.  I am married to Kevin, who is <br/>
step-father to my two boys, Gary (almost 12 and entering sixth grade and his <br/>
third year of homeschooling/unschooling) and Alex (7 and entering first <br/>
grade or second grade or third grade depending on what subject you wish to <br/>
talk about and how tied to public school curriculum you want to be and his <br/>
second official year of homeschooling/unschooling).  I have been married to <br/>
dh for five years.<br/>
<br/>
I have followed the &quot;choices&quot; thread with interest because of my own <br/>
choices.  I work fulltime outside the home, but that doesn&#39;t make me any <br/>
less of a full-time mom.  I am first and foremost mother to my boys.  I work <br/>
because i have the education that my dh does not have and will never have.  <br/>
Therefore i can make more money than he.  Now, before i get fried, let me <br/>
tell you that i am talking about a difference between living on minimum <br/>
wage, which is all dh can muster, or living on a salary barely above the <br/>
national poverty line, so don&#39;t get the idea that we are even comfortably <br/>
well-off.  Less than $20G annually barely pays the rent, utilities, <br/>
gasoline, and food, but we manage.  DH stays with the boys for now.  He is <br/>
probably going back to work after we move into a house here in a couple of <br/>
weeks.  We&#39;ve been spending the summer living in tents in a state forest <br/>
campground, as volunteer campground hosts.  Lots of fun, lots of education, <br/>
lots of hassle (but it was worth it).  when he does go back to work, we will <br/>
work our schedules around so that the boys can stay at home ... no day-care, <br/>
no sitters.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to learning much from this list and I hope I am able to <br/>
contribute some as we go along.<br/>
