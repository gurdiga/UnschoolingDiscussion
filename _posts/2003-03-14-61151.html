Announcing a new state group:<br/>
Homeschool Alliance of North Carolina<br/>
(HA-NC)<br/>
Website coming soon.......<br/>
<br/>
Enclosed are sections of HA-NC&#39;s constitution to give everybody an <br/>
idea of our<br/>
mission, purpose, membership and finances. The full constitution <br/>
will be<br/>
available at the website once it is completed.<br/>
Information on membership contacts are listed at the bottom of this <br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MISSION<br/>
The Homeschool Alliance of North Carolina was created to provide a <br/>
forum for<br/>
individuals and local groups to obtain and share information, as<br/>
well <br/>
as, to<br/>
network<br/>
on a statewide level.<br/>
We believe there is great strength in networking within the<br/>
diversity <br/>
of<br/>
homeschoolers and we support the freedom of all individual families <br/>
to choose home<br/>
education and to direct such education. All homeschoolers&#39; interests<br/>
<br/>
are served<br/>
when we are seen by the government, the news media, and the general <br/>
public as a<br/>
diverse people united in our love for our children and in our<br/>
valuing <br/>
freedom to<br/>
teach and learn at home.<br/>
HA-NC is an all volunteer alliance: homeschoolers supporting <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
ARTICLE II - PURPOSE<br/>
The Homeschool Alliance of North Carolina is established for the <br/>
following<br/>
reasons:<br/>
*to provide an online forum to bring together homeschool families<br/>
for <br/>
sharing<br/>
mutual homeschooling interests;<br/>
*to support new home educators by providing referrals to available <br/>
local<br/>
organizations, website and e-lists;<br/>
*to provide e-list committees that facilitate networking and the <br/>
mission/purpose<br/>
of HA-NC, solely based on the interests and participation of<br/>
members;<br/>
*to promote home education as a viable educational option by <br/>
supplying an accurate<br/>
portrayal of homeschooling that includes positive representation of <br/>
homeschooler&#39;s<br/>
diversity of philosophies, theologies and methodologies to the<br/>
public;<br/>
*to provide news and information of value to home educators<br/>
utilizing <br/>
a variety of<br/>
media including an online newsletter and may include phone, e-mail, <br/>
special<br/>
mailings, world wide web pages and local, regional and state <br/>
gatherings;<br/>
*to provide a legislative committee;<br/>
*to encourage self-advocacy and legislative awareness by...:<br/>
1. encouraging all members/all homeschoolers to monitor for bills <br/>
that may affect<br/>
our homeschooling freedoms;<br/>
2. encouraging self-empowerment by providing necessary literature <br/>
and/or<br/>
discussion;<br/>
3. encouraging all members to cultivate relationships with their <br/>
representatives<br/>
in order to promote positive images of homeschoolers in the NC <br/>
General Assembly;<br/>
4. promoting participation in the Governor&#39;s or Legislative Page<br/>
Programs for interested teens(15 and older)<br/>
...because we want homeschool families to continue to be empowered<br/>
to <br/>
make the<br/>
choices that respect the rights, needs, and aspirations of their <br/>
children;<br/>
*to provide an alliance that takes no position: on religion,<br/>
partisan <br/>
politics and<br/>
non-homeschooling issues<br/>
[Clarification - Nonsectarian Policy]<br/>
In order to avoid the perception of association, or implied <br/>
affiliation, with any<br/>
particular religious denomination, it is inappropriate for HA-NC to <br/>
include a<br/>
religious service, ceremony or practice as part of its sponsored <br/>
activities,<br/>
events, or presentations. In those instances, where HA-NC is <br/>
providing a framework<br/>
for the individual expression of homeschooling experiences, styles, <br/>
perspectives<br/>
or preferences (i.e., graduation parent statements, convention <br/>
workshops,<br/>
curriculum<br/>
vendors, student exhibits) HA-NC will not attempt to control or <br/>
censor that<br/>
expression in terms of religious content.<br/>
ARTICLE III - MEMBERSHIP<br/>
Membership is open to individuals, local groups and other <br/>
organizations that<br/>
support the<br/>
mission and Constitution of HA-NC. Membership shall consist of those<br/>
<br/>
who have<br/>
provided a name, address, phone, and email address (as available).<br/>
No statement of faith or philosophy shall be imposed as a condition <br/>
of membership.<br/>
Each member shall have one vote in such affairs of the Homeschool <br/>
Alliance that<br/>
are put before the members for vote.<br/>
Clarification: A member shall be one person from a family or <br/>
spokesperson from a<br/>
group.<br/>
ARTICLE IV - FINANCES<br/>
Donations will be accepted towards specific projects that the board<br/>
approves.(ie.website, flyers)<br/>
Members working on providing services that will require monetary <br/>
expenditures to<br/>
proceed (i.e., regional conferences, academic competitions), shall <br/>
fund raise or<br/>
ask<br/>
for contributions (or fees) of participating members to cover their <br/>
expenses.<br/>
HA-NC<br/>
will assume no liability of financial endeavors and the committments<br/>
<br/>
made by its<br/>
members, not approved by the BOD.<br/>
If it becomes necessary to require annual dues for membership and/or<br/>
<br/>
newsletter<br/>
subscription, the amount shall be determined by the HA-NC Board of <br/>
Directors.<br/>
