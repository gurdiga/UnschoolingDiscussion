 </span></blockquote>Yeah. I have printed off some posts and usually leave them in the bathroom. ;o)<br/>
I actually have started to feel sorry for the poor guy lately! I think that <br/>
sometimes he wishes that he married a more normal (mainstream) person. His dad<br/>
was navy and ran a very tight ship. They did not talk back to him or they would<br/>
get spanked. (The funny thing is that his dad is now the sweetest teddy bear of<br/>
a grandfather. My MIL has mentioned a few times that it is a shame that he could<br/>
not have relaxed and enjoyed his own boys as much as he enjoys his grandsons.) SO <br/>
Jeff really has a farther way to come to get to where I am. I know that there are <br/>
times when he does not feel like he has to explain himself and that Jason should<br/>
just do what he said because he said it. I am working on getting him to not take<br/>
Jason&#39;s actions so personally...they are not acts of defiance against him, but <br/>
rather very normal reactions from a little boy who is still learning. That<br/>
punishments are not the only way to teach him (and that in reality they do not <br/>
really do much to teach him at all). <br/>
<br/>
In fact, I was talking with a friend of mine today about unschooling/un-tving/un-junk <br/>
fooding etc and it hit me that if kids learn better by observing and being in life, <br/>
then why can&#39;t this apply to learning right from wrong and other life lessons? I <br/>
think that I had been unconsciously viewing parenting as teaching them lessons <br/>
(about what to eat, how much tv to watch, how many toys to buy, how much money <br/>
to spend) and if I did not teach them, they would not learn. But I can see that <br/>
is not true. The past couple of days I have been trying to just enjoy them. To not <br/>
worry about whether they are watching too much tv or if Jason has been playing his <br/>
bionicle game on the computer for too long. And things seem to be going smoother.<br/>
<br/>
I still have these nagging thoughts in my head however...things like kids need (and want)<br/>
parents to set the limits...that &quot;good&quot; parents are supposed to control tv viewing <br/>
and junk food  etc etc etc. Still working on it though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening...not sure if everything I wrote here makes sense or not!<br/>

<br/>
***** A passive approach worked for us. Laurie did as she pleased. <br/>
Since she could do as she pleased, it wasn&#39;t necessary for her to try <br/>
to defy rules or &quot;get away with&quot; something. She never had a moral <br/>
dilemma to deal with. Her only rules were that she couldn&#39;t hurt <br/>
herself or anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
 Cuz if that is the case it makes me think of the book &quot;The Lord Of <br/>
The Flies&quot;.  I believe that one&#39;s education and learning can have a <br/>
relaxed attitude and atmosphere, but I also believe that in life <br/>
there are rights and wrongs and consequences for our actions.  It is <br/>
all part of being in a society.<br/>
<br/>
***** One&#39;s education and learning with unschooling is relaxed. Think <br/>
of how *you* learn best. Is it with someone insisting that you have <br/>
to know it, or is it when you decide it&#39;s something you want to know <br/>
more about? Consequences for actions happen naturally. No one has to <br/>
force unnatural consequences on a child. For instance, if Laurie <br/>
ripped one of her books to shreds (as she did a few times as a child) <br/>
she learned quickly that the book could no longer be read. No one <br/>
said, &quot;Now Laurie, look what you did to your book. Now you can&#39;t read <br/>
it.&quot; It was obvious what she had done. The same when she disassembled <br/>
a favorite toy and lost some of the parts. <br/>

<br/>
**** Worry was not a part of our unschooling. We just let go of power <br/>
trips and joined life. Being taught is a pleasurable experience IF <br/>
it&#39;s your choice to be taught. We&#39;re all teachers to some extent, but <br/>
if we&#39;re wise, we only teach what someone asks us to teach. Then we <br/>
know the person honestly wants to hear what we have to say. We also <br/>
have no fear of asking others to teach what they know. Hence, the <br/>
message boards. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could ask your father-in-law to talk to your husband about relaxing.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have limits, they&#39;re just different kinds of limits.  Last night from <br/>
the next room I heard Marty say FOUR TIMES in about two minutes, &quot;Kirby, it&#39;s <br/>
not your turn,&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s still my turn.&quot;  Kirby, my turn&#39;s not over&quot; and I <br/>
yelled for Kirby.  He came to the door and I said &quot;I&#39;m tired of hearing Marty <br/>
say it&#39;s not your turn, do something about that!&quot; and they both laughed and I <br/>
laughed and he played more carefully.<br/>
<br/>
I had asked Kirby to clean his room (&#39;make a path&#39; is actually what I said, <br/>
so he cleaned out the floor).  And in that expanse of flat space, his friend <br/>
Chris and he set out all Chris&#39;s boxes of CCG cards and sorted them, and now <br/>
the floor has 6 square feet or so of boxes of cards.  Kirby said voluntarily <br/>
&quot;Sorry Chris&#39;s cards are here.  We&#39;re going to get them out of here and back <br/>
to his house in a few days.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly went to ride bikes and wasn&#39;t back at twilight.  I was worried.  She <br/>
came in the house saying &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late!&quot; and explaining the adventures <br/>
which caused it.<br/>
<br/>
With them that willing to amend little things out of consideration for <br/>
others, I can&#39;t worry about whether they&#39;re gong to grow up to be good <br/>
adults.  They are!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s our main limiting factor:  Be considerate.<br/>
<br/>
When kids have a ton of specific rules, if they&#39;ve followed 40 rules, they&#39;re <br/>
going to feel they&#39;ve earned the right to kick back and be selfish, <br/>
sometimes.  If there weren&#39;t a bunch of rules, but a few principles, they can <br/>
calmly live within those principles.<br/>
<br/>
Our house isn&#39;t neat and clean, but we can clean up for a party when we need <br/>
to, and we can usually find something (one CD portable CD player is missing, <br/>
and an unrelated CD...).<br/>

<br/>
No.  It&#39;s more like taking an ACTIVE approach to everything your child does.  <br/>
To live WITH him rather than in opposition to him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is there a point where one <br/>

<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about teaching and teachers.  Some of HOMEschooling is, but <br/>
the subset of homeschooling which is unschooling is about natural learning, <br/>
and learning together, and learning for fun, and the inevitable learning <br/>
which happens constantly if teaching doesn&#39;t mess things up.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I also believe that in life there are rights and wrongs and consequences <br/>
for our <br/>
actions.  It is all part of being in a society. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids are in a society.  They&#39;re not outside of the society in an artifical <br/>
kid-environment, but in the real world with people of all ages.  They do very <br/>
well!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Just pondering here as I try to pick up on the subtle and not so subtle <br/>
differences of the &quot;homeschooling&quot; lifestyle.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As you read about different kinds of homeschooling you&#39;ll understand better.<br/>
<br/>
If you started cold in unschooling and you believe in lots of teaching and <br/>
discipline, you might be happier reading about structured homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437238014">I also am trying to unlimit myself in regards to my children and eating and TV. And have a good story.<br/>
Yesterday my son 9, asked to have some chocolate milk and I said sure, you can have that any time you want. And he stops and looks at me and then stops and says, oh, I guess I don&#39;t want any I think I already had enough sugar today,  And walks away.  Wow.  <br/>
Then we were talking about soda(pop), he loves Mountain Dew, and I was tellling him that I really just want him to be able to make good choices with regards to his eating and drinking because I want him to stay healthy and feeling good.  And he said that&#39;s why I&#39;ve limited myself to one caffeine pop a week and one noncaffeine pop  a week.  I&#39;m like, isn&#39;t that what I wanted a few months ago?  But here he had decided that was what he wanted.  <br/>
So there ya go, they do self regulate,  yeah Sandra you were right.<br/>

down to get it straight in my head....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm. Maybe I did not explain myself very well. I didn&#39;t mean that I would<br/>
let them run around wreaking havoc! LOL! What I have been grappling with though<br/>
is that there are times where I feel that I make a decision solely because I have to<br/>
teach them a lesson. For example, I don&#39;t usually buy them candy or small items<br/>
when we go shopping. Why? Because they have to learn (i.e., I have to teach them)<br/>
that they can not have everything they want. What I have been thinking lately is <br/>
that I need to really look at this...do I *really* think that they will not learn<br/>
that they can not have everything they want unless I purposefully deprive them?<br/>
There will be plenty of times in the course of their lives where they will learn<br/>
that. So what I have started doing is looking at it on a case by case basis. If<br/>
there is a real reason why I don&#39;t want to get something (don&#39;t have enough<br/>
money on me or something like that) then we won&#39;t get it. But what am I afraid will<br/>
really happen if I buy them a .50 candy bar? <br/>
<br/>
I kind of feel like there are all these things that I *should* do as a parent. I have<br/>
overcome many of them, but now I kind of feel like I am going to another level. When<br/>
Jason was 9 months old, I remember my mom telling me that I needed to teach him how<br/>
to play by himself (by doing the dishes even if he was sitting on the floor crying) or<br/>
he would always need me to entertain him. Well, I didn&#39;t follow her advice and at 5<br/>
Jason will play by himself, not as much as other kids, and always in the same room that<br/>
I am in. But I have also come to realize that this is just part of who Jason is. It<br/>
was not until I had Kyle that I realized that people could actually get household <br/>
chores done with little kids around! Of course my mom also worried that Jason would<br/>
never learn to wear pjs because I let him sleep in his clothes to avoid getting <br/>
dressed issues (yes...we really had this conversation LOL! And I am happy to report<br/>
that Jason does sleep in pjs (at least sometimes!)) So you would think that I would<br/>
be good at ignoring those &quot;shoulds&quot; by now!<br/>

From the time Kirby was a baby I had decided to always say yes if there was <br/>
no real reason of safety or law or consideration for others to say no.  When <br/>
&quot;yes&quot; is the default answer and not &quot;NO!&quot; life is soft and open, not dark and <br/>
closed up.  How can children grow up sweet and light if they&#39;re treated like <br/>
criminals?<br/>
<br/>
There are cultural and religious reasons that many children are treated as <br/>
criminals.  I reject the idea that my children are born in sin or have to <br/>
have their wills broken.  So yes becomes part of love and caring, and a mean, <br/>
thoughtless &quot;NO&quot; is rejected with cutting insults, spankings, and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Stephanie, your mom sounds like my mother in law, who told me that we have to <br/>
frustrate our kids so they&#39;ll learn to deal with frustration.<br/>
<br/>
My husband would be a happier man if he hadn&#39;t been frustrated by his <br/>
self-satisfied mother.<br/>
<br/>
We figured frustration is natural, and they&#39;ll get PLENTY without us devising <br/>
some fake frustrations.<br/>

Stephanie, It sounds like you are thinking my thoughts!!  It must have been the way alot of us were raised,  I know I always felt that saying no was the &#39;good&#39; parent thing.

<br/>
I kind of feel like there are all these things that I *should* do as a parent. I have<br/>
overcome many of them, but now I kind of feel like I am going to another level. When<br/>
Jason was 9 months old, I remember my mom telling me that I needed to teach him how<br/>
to play by himself (by doing the dishes even if he was sitting on the floor crying) or<br/>
he would always need me to entertain him. Well, I didn&#39;t follow her advice and at 5<br/>
Jason will play by himself, not as much as other kids, and always in the same room that<br/>
I am in. But I have also come to realize that this is just part of who Jason is. It<br/>
was not until I had Kyle that I realized that people could actually get household <br/>
chores done with little kids around! Of course my mom also worried that Jason would<br/>
never learn to wear pjs because I let him sleep in his clothes to avoid getting <br/>
dressed issues (yes...we really had this conversation LOL! And I am happy to report<br/>
that Jason does sleep in pjs (at least sometimes!)) So you would think that I would<br/>
be good at ignoring those &quot;shoulds&quot; by now!<br/>

Right now this very minute I have clarified it with myself that there are certain values that I would like to see my children adopt.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one of the concepts I have been wrestling with too. I think where<br/>
I am now, though is realizing that I really can not instill (teach) my<br/>
value system. All I can do is model and explain why I make the choices<br/>
that I make. I can not *make* my kids choose the same way that I do (and<br/>
in trying to force them to, will make it more likely that they will not).<br/>
By not buying my kids something that they want I am not modeling, but rather<br/>
am forcing them to live by my value system. Modeling would be to see <br/>
something that *I* want and choose to put it back and not<br/>
buy it.  Interestingly, I had a conversation with my 5 yo at little while ago, <br/>
where I mentioned how I wanted a new sofa, but have not gotten one because we have <br/>
decided to get other things so far. This seems to have had more impact on him <br/>
(he asks me about it periodically) then any of our other conversations about <br/>
priorities (usually when I would not buy *him* something). <br/>
<br/>
The other piece of this that I am wrestling with is about deciding what my kids need.<br/>
Is it really my place to decide what they really need? Can I really determine what<br/>
value they will get out of something? When I was in elementary school, my brother <br/>
and I want to the store with my dad to pick up a last minute something. He (after<br/>
some whining) bought me a *very* cheap plastic angel ornament and my brother a snowman.<br/>
We played with these ornaments extensively...making up scenes, carrying them around.<br/>
It for some reason became one of my favorite ornaments and I *still* have it and<br/>
put it on my tree every year. It brings back wonderful memories. If my kids wanted<br/>
something like this ornament, I most likely would have said no (extremely cheaply made<br/>
and plastic).<br/>
<br/>
So where do I draw the line and how do I make these decisions...I really am trying to<br/>
look at it from the boys perspective and not make arbitrary (in their eyes) decisions. <br/>
For example...I hate to pay vending machine prices (especially $1 for a coke!). So <br/>
if we were leaving somewhere for home, I would tell the boys no (and why) and that <br/>
we could have a coke when we got home (or at least now I would since I am trying to <br/>
ease up on the food restrictions LOL!). But if we were out and not going home, I <br/>
would be more likely to go ahead and buy it (if I had the money on me).<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping that once the boys see that I *am* willing to get them things, they will<br/>
be more open to hearing about why I make the choices for myself that I do. And that<br/>
they will start thinking more about the choices that they make. Funny thing happened<br/>
in the grocery store a couple of days ago...we were going down the cereal aisle when<br/>
Jason saw a Capt Crunch box advertising Bionicle cards with purchase. He of course wanted it<br/>
(he LOVES bionicles!). Instead of just immediately saying, no, it is junk cereal, I <br/>
went over and looked at the box (I decided that if he really wanted it I would say yes).<br/>
He looked at all the boxes and I read them and we realized that you only got the one<br/>
card that was taped to the front. When he realized that, *he* decided that it was not<br/>
worth buying the box of cereal to get one card! Could have blown me away....<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Sandra&#39;s article on spoiling? It was a real eye opener...told me things that<br/>
I already knew, but had a hard time believe as everyone has been telling me the exact <br/>
opposite....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918113577">I&#39;m glad Stephanie mentioned these experiences - the warnings, her<br/>
exasperation, envy of parents who have certainty, almost fear of talking<br/>
to friends about the non-controlling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I have been going through a lot of that lately.  My marriage is in<br/>
turmoil - in addition to many other issues that we haven&#39;t got around to<br/>
discussing my dh will not discuss (or read about) unschooling and<br/>
resents both that I have chosen to support the children without<br/>
schooling and that I wish to be a non-coercive parent.  In our<br/>
counselling the counsellor asked what I feared if I would &quot;compromise&quot;<br/>
with my dh in the homeschooling.  When I couldn&#39;t answer the question<br/>
because of the ambiguities - particularly her desire to &quot;leave the<br/>
children out of the issue&quot; and I became annoyed with her insistence she<br/>
ends up telling me that it sounds to her that I have made the<br/>
homeschooling choice because of my own experiences and that I am afraid<br/>
to compromise with my dh because of a control issue relating to the way<br/>
my father was!  At the end of that session she intended to &quot;consult&quot;<br/>
with her colleagues and now I&#39;m wondering what all she wants to consult<br/>
on, and I hate the paranoia of wondering if she is checking out whether<br/>
and how to interfere with our (boys & I) educational choice!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling vulnerable and uncertain.  I&#39;ve checked with the oldest - he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go to school still.  The youngest is nearly 5 enjoys<br/>
kindergarten and is aware that all the other kids will be going to<br/>
school next year.  Last year he was happy with doing &quot;little homeschool&quot;<br/>
but with the tension surrounding the issue of homeschooling in the<br/>
family I&#39;m not sure if he might ask to go to school just because that is<br/>
what his dad wants him to do.  I&#39;ve tried structuring activities - it<br/>
just doesn&#39;t work with these independent boys - they like to choose<br/>
their own activities, which unfortunately don&#39;t appear educational to my<br/>
dh (tv, computer, playing outside, computer, tv, reading only Asterix<br/>
books).<br/>
<br/>
Why am I writing?  Oh yeah - there is just no-one to talk to around here<br/>
who can support me.  My mother, while she is a supportive, loving<br/>
darling, cannot understand my parenting objectives or educational<br/>
choice.  My sister is a catholic school teacher, my brother has no<br/>
children and we are the only unschooling family in the area.  My friends<br/>
are the &quot;benevolent&quot; authoritarian kinds of parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504455136">Hi, Mica.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll probably get a lot of wonderful answers to these questions, but the <br/>
one thing that strikes me is that your husband and counselor seem to be <br/>
putting you on the defensive without being well enough informed about the <br/>
issue.  Sandra Dodd has pointed this out before (much more eloquently than <br/>
I am), and I have always been very impressed with this argument.  Until <br/>
your husband (especially) and counselor read up and inform themselves about <br/>
the validity of your educated and informed choices, they have no business <br/>
challenging you on them because they have no idea where you are coming <br/>
from!  You have taken the time to read up on exactly why unschooling is a <br/>
good choice for you and your kids; they have not.  Until they have boned up <br/>
on exactly what unschooling and non-coercive parenting are, how can they <br/>
intelligently discuss these, or their alternatives, with you?<br/>
<br/>
How would it feel for you to give both of them a list of recommended <br/>
reading materials and then tell them that after they have read some of the <br/>
list you would be more willing to entertain their concerns?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280619038">Well, of course if the counselor  will not allow the children to enter into the discussion of why you want to unschool it will sound controlling.  It is kind of like asking someone why you want to breastfeed your baby, but don&#39;t mention the child. If the child isn&#39;t in there that leaves you or the world at large.  I&#39;m bfing my baby to save the worlds soybeans for the starving I guess could pass muster, but it sounds silly.<br/>
<br/>
She put you in a no-win situation. There was no possible way for you to answer the question without it becoming about you.<br/>

I would call her on it the next time you see her.  Your reasons for unschooling are sound: this is the best way for your children to learn.  End of sentence.  The proof isn&#39;t in showing that they are at grade level, it is showing that they readily and rapidly, and hungrily, every day, seek out and learn new things.  <br/>
<br/>
hope things work out.  I really don&#39;t like how this counselor operates...<br/>

  their own activities, which unfortunately don&#39;t appear educational to my<br/>
  dh (tv, computer, playing outside, computer, tv, reading only Asterix<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453158562">Hi Mica! Feel free to e-mail me if you ever want to chat! I also have no support from family for the way I&#39;m choosing to raise my children, instead I get alot of criticism.

I wish I had other good suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
For the husband and counselor, I would say something appropriate to the <br/>
situation about something your husband understands and does (fixing your car, <br/>
or whatever his job is) that you don&#39;t tell him how to do because he has <br/>
researched it and knows what he&#39;s doing.  And you have researched methods of <br/>
homeschooling and have REALLY paid close attention to your children&#39;s fears <br/>
and concerns and needs and learning styles, and you don&#39;t think that those <br/>
who are unwilling to look into to it (including counselors) can really <br/>
discuss it with you in an informed fashion.<br/>

I feel like so many people just discount things they don&#39;t understand, instead of trying to understand it.  Maybe its all those years in school being told &quot;this is what you need to learn&quot;.  If its not in those parameters its not &#39;right&#39;.  &lt;BigSigh&gt;<br/>

junk food&quot; if you say you let them eat what they choose.<br/>
There is very little trust or respect for children in our society. In fact, <br/>
children are probably the most horribly mistreated group of citizens out <br/>

Sad but true. Prejudice abounds where these smaller people are concerned. <br/>

&quot;compromise&quot; with my dh in the homeschooling. **<br/>
<br/>
Can there even BE a compromise without cutting the boys in half?  (The<br/>
way King Solomon proposed?)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think sending them to school half day is a workable compromise. <br/>
And even homeschooling in alternate years would stink.  Maybe<br/>
homeschooling them the first half of 12 years of schooling would be<br/>
good.  You might get what you want for 6 years and then live to fight,<br/>
or run away, or re-negotiate at some date in the future.  (Actually, how<br/>
many years of school do you have in Australia, before university, and<br/>
how is it broken up?  In my state (CA) it&#39;s mostly K-5, 6-8, and 9-12 in<br/>
separate schools.)<br/>
<br/>
Is your husband compromising at all or does the therapist expect *you*<br/>
to compromise in a one-sided way?<br/>

some&gt;of these things...they look at me like I have horns on my head or like <br/>
I am seriously deluding myself.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I too know how you feel with this. My in laws were always trying to give me <br/>
their doubts and make me feel wrong. I never felt wrong because I was so <br/>
convinced I was doing the right thing. My husband and I both. What I did <br/>
feel was frustration as they never really wanted to listen or understand the <br/>
why&#39;s of what we did. I don&#39;t see them anymore and we are so much better for <br/>
it. They really aren&#39;t the kind of people I want around my kids now anyway. <br/>
My MIL does stop by once a week to see the kids and it&#39;s tolerable. Although <br/>
she did just ask me when we start school. I&#39;ve been trying to explain what <br/>
we do for almost 6 years now!!!!! It&#39;s not even worth the effort anymore <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
As far as your dh goes, keep plugging and maybe just by doing, he&#39;ll get it. <br/>
I&#39;ve seen plenty of husbands finally come around when one would think they <br/>
never would. People just get afraid of what they don&#39;t know and kids I think <br/>
for the most part, have that &#39;should be seen and not heard&#39; label. I think <br/>
what we do is not the &#39;norm&#39; if you will and that&#39;s scares people into not <br/>
even wanting to understand.<br/>
