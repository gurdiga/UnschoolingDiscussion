<div id="ygrps-yiv-464815734">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i think you&#39;re right.   i wish difficult childhoods would always lead to<br/>
profound understand and compassion but i think more often than not it leads to<br/>
tremendous stress and distortions which make it very difficult to perceive the<br/>
world as a safe place full of potential.   in my family, which i&#39;m the<br/>
youngest of 5,  the abuse still continues (though much more subtle) and some<br/>
of us have developed compassion and other have developed a hypersensitivity to<br/>
themselves and their own pain, making it impossible to see things from<br/>
another&#39;s point of view, leaving them with twisted perceptions and a sad take<br/>
on the world.<br/>
<br/>
it is so sad to experience the loss and/or lack of love especially when one is<br/>
a child but when you can, as an adult, allow it in your life, it is a<br/>
wonderful triumph of the spirit.  it&#39;s nice that after 30 years you can purge<br/>
this from your being.  i had to be stricken with an autoimmune disease ( i<br/>
would recommend a less stubborn way of learning:) to begin to break down the<br/>
tremendous armor i had built to protect myself from the destruction of abuse.<br/>
but anything is possible if you desire it - as a kid, around 7,  i remember<br/>
fighting with my mother about happiness.  she said &#39;life is not to be happy&#39;<br/>
and i said &#39;maybe yours isn&#39;t but mine is&#39; - it was one of those pivotal<br/>
moments - and the search for happiness had begun though it took me a long time<br/>
my life is completely about happiness even the saddest event are now shrouded<br/>
in it.<br/>

&gt; Thankyou for your sensitive email.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You did not overstep any bounds, you expressed compassion from what I<br/>
&gt; perceive to be a Christian viewpoint, and that is fine with me.  I have no<br/>
&gt; problems with anyone elses faith or convictions.  What I do have problems<br/>
&gt; is with the way some try to force their beliefs down the throats of others<br/>
&gt; and by doing so they devalue the beliefs of others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everyone&#39;s own beliefs are very important and very personal and should not<br/>
&gt; be belittled by others.  I know many fine Chrisitians and like their<br/>
&gt; company, they are able to accept that I do not believe what they do and<br/>
&gt; just get on with our relationship, whatever that may be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW I suffered at the hands of more than one person, for some strange<br/>
&gt; reason working in a children&#39;s home seems to dehumanize people, or maybe it<br/>
&gt; attracts the type of people who feel powerless in their own lives and<br/>
&gt; realize that when in control of a group of orphans, unwanted children etc<br/>
&gt; they are all powerfull.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think I&#39;m mostly over it now, it took me over 30 years before I could<br/>
&gt; talk about it, and only then could the healing really start to take effect.<br/>
&gt;  In some ways I do think a difficult childhood can lead to increased<br/>
&gt; compassion for others, but I think it more often goes the other way and<br/>
&gt; produces people who pass the suffering on to their own children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
