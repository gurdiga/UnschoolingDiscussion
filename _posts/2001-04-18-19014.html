<div id="ygrps-yiv-151614714">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve enjoyed listening to you.  However, I don&#39;t have time right now to<br/>
keep up.  I&#39;m working very hard at my homebased business and looking at<br/>
having my husband retire in a year and join me.  Maybe I&#39;ll rejoin by<br/>
next fall.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and Success,<br/>
Sherry</div>
