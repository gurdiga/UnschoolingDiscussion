<div id="ygrps-yiv-67590127">I had never given this much thought until my ex and I split. Now my son has &quot;two Daddies&quot; but he&#39;s kind of weird about it. When his dad is visiting, he calls both Cary (my ex) and Michael (my husband) daddy. It gets very confusing. When his father isn&#39;t here he vacillates between calling Michael &quot;Daddy&quot; or Michael. I have always been &quot;Mama&quot;. He called me Virginia one time, to introduce me to his teacher and I thought the child would die of embarrassment. He even apologized later because he thought he had been disrespectful. I just told him not to worry about it, that it was ok.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Mike and I do not fuss at him about this. We are in the south (SC) and I was raised with strict adherence to kids never calling parents by their names and using sir and mam. He uses sir and mam because I think it is respectful but the whole issue of who to call what has always been a non-issue. Life is too short to waste on such trivia&lt;G&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is an interesting topic though. I never realized there were so many differing views on something I just sort of take for granted. Thank you to whomever started the thread.<br/>

Brightest Blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673234606">Well we&#39;ve always been mom and dad. Not even in a joking way has any of the <br/>
kids ever called me Mary. I guess we&#39;ll always be mom and dad then too. My <br/>
16 year old in fact still calls me Mommy most of the time. Even in front of <br/>
her friends. When she was on a cruise for a week, they made fun of her <br/>
because every night she would cry that she missed her Mommy!! Didn&#39;t bother <br/>
her in the least.<br/>
