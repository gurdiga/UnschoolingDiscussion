Sorry I do not have time to respond.  My grandbabies are here until late<br/>

Here&#39;s more about Dr. Emoto: &quot;Messages of Water&quot; which was amazing.  The<br/>
link below talks a bit about the gist of the movie, but without the<br/>
science behind it.  <br/>
It shows why it&#39;s a great idea to watch our thoughts and words.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that it demonstrates why we should watch our thoughts and<br/>
words as much as it demonstrates personal gulliability.  Or maybe it<br/>
is the desire to believe that each of us controls the world just by<br/>
thinking &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; thoughts.  It makes super powers of us all.<br/>
Masura Emoto has found that taping the words &quot;thank you&quot; and the word<br/>
&quot;arigato&quot; to a glass bottle produce different effects.  He has found<br/>
that &quot;arigato&quot; (Japanese thank you) gives rise to a much more pleasing<br/>
crystal than does the English equivalent<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.randi.org/jr/052303.html">http://www.randi.org/jr/052303.html</a> about half way down the page). I<br/>
wonder what the word &quot;ethnocentric&quot; would produce?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453292316">The &quot;researchers&quot; take a sample of water that has been frozen in a  <br/>
container with certain words written on it (like &quot;People are fools&quot;).  <br/>
The &quot;researchers&quot; KNOW what words were written on it - they search  <br/>
through all the crystals in the sample, looking for ones that are  <br/>
ugly (if the message is an &quot;ugly&quot; one) or pretty (if the message is a  <br/>
nice one). Then they take pictures.<br/>
<br/>
The crystals are not being formed by anybody&#39;s thoughts - they&#39;re  <br/>
being formed by freezing the water.<br/>
<br/>
Having a bit of skepticism and trying to think clearly and not being  <br/>
gullible is good for unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please, please, please -- don&#39;t raise your kids with this message.  I <br/>
was raised in the Religious Science church, a &quot;New Thought&quot; religion, <br/>
where we believed our thoughts controlled the universe around us.  It&#39;s <br/>
a terrifying thing for a child.  Kids should be free to think whatever <br/>
thoughts arise, to examine them, enjoy them, reject them, as they <br/>
choose.  To be told we have to watch what we *think* when our young <br/>
imaginations run wild, beyond our control, is too great a burden for a <br/>
child.  Kids need to be free to try out ideas; how many kids don&#39;t <br/>
think about what life would be like if their parents died?  Now, <br/>
imagine that child has been taught her thoughts make things happen.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, kids, who tend to take things literally, will test the theory -- <br/>
No matter how hard I thought, I never manifested a pony on Christmas <br/>
morning.  Teaching a kid their thoughts or words have power is a real <br/>
faith-killer.  When he discovers he can&#39;t move mountains, he&#39;ll cease <br/>
to trust you or himself, and telling him they&#39;re rhetorical mountains <br/>
won&#39;t do any good; it will be too late.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point. We were originally talking about other&#39;s thoughts and words<br/>
coming into our space through movies and TV. We always have the power to<br/>
choose our own thoughts and words, no matter what is going on around us.<br/>
