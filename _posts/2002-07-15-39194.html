<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384522912">Are there any speech pathologists/therapists on the list?  I am <br/>
wondering if there&#39;s a &quot;golden hour&quot; so to speak after which speech <br/>
therapy becomes more difficult? I am asking because my almost 7 yo <br/>
has a minor lisp.  He was evaluated while still in ps and qualified <br/>
for some therapy.  However, we&#39;ve since taken him out of school and <br/>
our district will not provide therapy to hs kids.  My inclination is <br/>
to ignore it until it bothers him.  The lisp is minor and doesn&#39;t <br/>
interfere with his speech or with other people understanding what <br/>
he&#39;s saying.  Should I follow my insticts or should we get therapy <br/>

I have to laugh, because I had to endure speach therapy in elementary school when they decided that I had a lisp ( I do and because of that am self concious of it now!)<br/>
anyway they had me stand on my head everyday in my spare time (at home all the time) and say while standing on my head silly sally sat on the seashore selling seashells!<br/>
 anyway that was supposed to help me feel where my tounge should be when making the s sound!<br/>
I think if nobody told me I had a lisp and nobody said things like my mother did like &quot; oh susies sweat shop heh thats a real mouth full for you!&quot; stuff like that .<br/>
so you may want to just let him be and not mention it or offer simple suggestions like just practicing letter sounds or something .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159118224">Anyone that asks Bridget to teach them knitting must have spent some <br/>
time standing on their heads!! Just kidding!!  I think you are right. <br/>
I really don&#39;t notice the lisp that much. It&#39;s obvious when he says <br/>
some words but not others.  I think we&#39;ll let it slide for a while at <br/>
least until his permanent teeth come in all the way.  Then we&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the laugh!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670150393">My sister took her 2 year old boy for speech therapy because he was &quot;delayed&quot;. This was totally ludicrous to me and I commented to her about this. She began to lay off the pressure when I talked about variations in levels, learning, stages etc..<br/>
Now here is the interesting thing I babysit him on a regular basis as she works and he is now just short of three and boom one day he is talking clearly and in sentences. Speech therapy was not necessary. What I believe was needed was to lay off on the high expectations and not trusting his natural development.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did that too and regret it now!  He tested at their 15 month level when he <br/>
was 2 and then tested at their 4 year level when he was 3.  I was so sure he <br/>
was behind, so into comparing him with other kids, it was all my pushing.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter and I went with him to each session, I refused to wait somewhere <br/>
while they worked with him.  Nathan thought they had the best toys and <br/>
enjoyed going.  I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t need the therapy and that he would have <br/>
spoken when he was good and ready.  He understood everything and just needed <br/>
some time.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope the whole experience was more damaging to my self esteem than to his.  <br/>
  I&#39;ve learned a lot since then.<br/>
