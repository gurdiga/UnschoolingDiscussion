When people are strident and inflexible they can&#39;t then say &quot;to each his <br/>
own.&quot;  A person can&#39;t really (for example) be a serious fundamentalist <br/>
Christian and then say &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t fault you for your religious beliefs&quot; <br/>
unless that other person is a born again Christian.   For someone to say <br/>
abortion is absolutely and always wrong and should be criminalized, they <br/>
cannot in good faith tell someone, &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t mean You and YOUR <br/>
abortion... I certainly understand where you were coming from and I don&#39;t <br/>
judge you.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a hypocricy which either dissolves the power of their first position, or <br/>
which shows them to be cowardly in the face of their real <br/>
originally-proclaimed target.<br/>
<br/>
If a person really truly believes that each person should make his or her own <br/>
decisions about religion, politics and educational options, then there&#39;s no <br/>
sense, really, in dedicating much time or energy to one or the other of those <br/>
options.  A to-each-his-own believer should, it seems, spend time making sure <br/>
people HAVE options.<br/>
<br/>
There are few to no political positions which can match this, though.  One <br/>
person&#39;s extreme beliefs stomp the life out of another&#39;s.  You can&#39;t save the <br/>
rainforest without putting some people and companies out of livlihood and <br/>
possibly in jail.  You can&#39;t be pro-choice and then tell your brother in law <br/>
you love him just the same even though he burned down the Planned Parenthood <br/>
building around the corner from his house (unless you never liked him and you <br/>
still don&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
There will always be people who will say &quot;sorry; whatever&quot; though and not <br/>
hold their positions strongly.  I think it&#39;s worth pointing it out to them <br/>
sometimes.  If I read the original tirade and then have to witness the <br/>
waffling, I get to say &quot;waffle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ll try not to so much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420896125">Hi and thanks to everyone for the great posts. I wanted to expand on them a <br/>
little. We all choose a path in our life and when someone thinks they have <br/>
found a small spark of truth it is very hard not to let everyone know about <br/>
it. The hard part is to do it in a respectful, loving, caring way. We all <br/>
put our foot in our mouths to many times. I have personally tried to choose <br/>
a life path of love, compassion, and nonviolence to all. I believe their are <br/>
definite universal rights and wrongs. I try to live a life abiding by those <br/>
truths. I don&#39;t feel exceptions can be made for these universal truths. Does <br/>
this mean I cannot treat people in a caring, empathetic way? Does this mean <br/>
I feel I am above everyone else? No Way! For example, if I feel <br/>
homosexuality is wrong does that mean I cannot speak to homosexuals and have <br/>
to shun them? Does that mean if I do talk to them I am not being truthful to <br/>
my own beliefs? The answer once again is a big fat no! &quot;All men are created <br/>
equal.&quot; So if I were to met a homosexual it would be wrong of me to treat <br/>
him with any less dignity, empathy or compassion than I would the Pope. We <br/>
are all one in the same on different life paths. We are created by one <br/>
creator, connecting us all together. On the same note, it would also be my <br/>
responsibility when a mutual opportunity became available to express my <br/>
feelings respectfully and with love on homosexuality. If I did not I would <br/>
not be living and abiding by my own truth. This is the only way to make <br/>
change in such a chaotic world. Everyone knows the story of the &quot;Good <br/>
Samaritan&quot;, it is possible to be a caring neighbor to all without giving up <br/>
any of your own beliefs. Arguing and preaching will never accomplish <br/>
anything. It is only love, compassion, and truth that will break down these <br/>
walls.<br/>
<br/>
