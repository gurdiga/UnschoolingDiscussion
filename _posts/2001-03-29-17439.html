<div>Valerie and Bethany,</div>
<div>Just like many of the post here have a different view of what being a 
unschooled is I think there are different ideas associated with the word 
Christian.&nbsp; And you probably would not be accepted into the there group 
anyways.&nbsp; It has just been my own personnel experience that has formed my 
opinion of there closed off group.&nbsp; Bonnie</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><tt>But I will say this, even though I am a<br>Christian and could in all 
good conscience sign a statement of faith and<br>join such a group, I probably 
would not.&nbsp; I did not choose to keep my kids<br>out of<br>school in order 
to keep them isolated from the greater world, but to immerse<br>them in it. Part 
of that is meeting people who do not share our beliefs and<br>learning from 
them. So, while I assume you were in jest, please do not<br>include a statement 
of lack of faith in your group, because then where would<br>I 
go?<br><br>***Bethany, you&#39;re right. I was kidding about the Lack of Faith 
Statement.<br>I&#39;m right there with you...I am a Christian, but I could never 
join a<br>Christian-only homeschooling group for the very reasons you 
stated.<br><br>Valerie in Tacoma<br></tt></div>
