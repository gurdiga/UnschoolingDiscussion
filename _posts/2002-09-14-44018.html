&lt;&lt;  Still tryign to find other ways to <br/>
 throw reading in, but it&#39;s a good start with bug books and the satin <br/>
 hands.  I think I may also re bottle all the shampooes, bubble baths <br/>
 and conditioners in the house.  Put them in same types of bottles, <br/>
 where they can&#39;t see the colors, and just put plain labels on them, <br/>
 then let them pick them out as they take thier baths, so they will <br/>
 learn those words without realizing it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really think you&#39;re getting closer, but this type of thinking has to stop <br/>
for unschooling to truly unfold.<br/>
Quit trying. Just live. Don&#39;t look for teachable moments, just enjoy life <br/>
with them.<br/>
Let them learn from real bottles, not some contrived scheme by you to get <br/>
them to read.<br/>
They will read in their own time, it&#39;s only the first day of this....what <br/>
happens if one of them shows no interest in reading for some months?<br/>
That should be ok.<br/>
I think your day sounded very nice and peaceful. You&#39;re getting <br/>
there......but some thinking still sounds very schoolish.<br/>
Give yourself time too....it doesn&#39;t happen overnight.<br/>
