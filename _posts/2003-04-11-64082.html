&lt;&lt; You&#39;re in a store and your child wants something you don&#39;t have the money <br/>
for <br/>
 or you don&#39;t think they need (candy, toy, etc) and they begin to throw a <br/>
 tantrum.  What would you do instead of spanking?  Another...Child is asked <br/>
 repeatedly to put their things away, they don&#39;t do it, and if told again <br/>
look <br/>
 the parent in the face and say, &quot;No! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would assume the child has other priorities and put it away myself.<br/>
OR I would say &quot;could you help me put these away really quick&quot; and help her <br/>
do it.<br/>
If my child has a total meltdown in a store I try to calm them but if that <br/>
isn&#39;t possible we will leave. Better to come back when the child is capable <br/>
of being calm.<br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t punish them. I&#39;d assume they were tired or hungry or needy in <br/>
some way and simply without the tools to tell me any other way.<br/>
Keeping snacks with us is a good way of avoiding toddler meltdowns, and a <br/>
good distraction too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600726900">One of the ways that works for us; Brianna & I have discussed environmental impact. We have, in the past bought this plastic junk - doesn&#39;t last, wastes money and it&#39;s made in China and shipped here. We&#39;ve discussed the energy it takes to manufacture, to transport and how, when we buy this stuff - we are &#39;voting&#39; for this company that is disrespectful/destructive of the environment.<br/>
Further more, we also discuss how much money we have and what we really want to do with it. Sure, she may want this $4.99 toy or that .99 cent candy bar - but more and more, she&#39;ll say - herself- no, I&#39;d rather save the money. A few months ago, her bio-mom was shopping w/ us. She was buying her other two kids some junk toys. Brianna said she&#39;d rather have the money - Thank you very much -she told her bio-mom that the company exploited the planet and the kids and that she&#39;d rather save her money for her animal refuge  that she wants to build.<br/>
Another aspect of this -- I don&#39;t buy chips. We both gave them up and we save the money. It&#39;s about $15.00 per month. At the end of the year, we&#39;ll invest it somewhere, somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we are on the pow wow trail. We know people that have little or nothing. Many reservations are like third world countries. So we try to spend wisely.<br/>
<br/>
As for manners. Again, on the pow wow trail - manners are everywhere. How we act & interact w/ elders, how we act & interact w/ other kids. There&#39;s no cutting ahead in line; there&#39;s no interrupting; lies are not tolerated as it hurts the People. Things like that. I find the pow wow trail very, very helpful in her development.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666492399"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;One of the ways that works for us; Brianna & I have discussed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>environmental impact.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s a very important point.  My sons, at two and five, can&#39;t really<br/>
grasp the environmental impact of a tiny plastic toy, but I&#39;ve told my<br/>
husband and parents that I absolutely don&#39;t want them picking up &quot;cute&quot;<br/>
little plastic things for the kids that have two minutes of pleasure and<br/>
then go to a landfill.  <br/>
 <br/>
If each child in America had only ten small plastic toys that broke<br/>
right away and went to a landfill, that&#39;s millions of toys.  And it&#39;s<br/>
not ten per child; it&#39;s hundreds.  Thousands, for some kids.<br/>
 <br/>
My children have a lot of toys, and many of them are plastic, but it&#39;s<br/>
important to me that if they&#39;re going to have a plastic toy, that it<br/>
will last for a long time and be passed to other children when they&#39;re<br/>
done with it.  Like Fisher Price Little People.  They have a lot of<br/>
these toys.  But they never break, my older son has played with them<br/>
nonstop for three years, I know they will last many more years before my<br/>
kids are done with them, and then they&#39;ll still be good enough for<br/>
another child to enjoy them. Quality is very important to me in<br/>
children&#39;s toys.  Is something going to last many years and give many<br/>
hours of enjoyment, or is it going to end up in the dumpster after five<br/>
minutes?  I can&#39;t justify bringing things into the home that are going<br/>
to go straight to a landfill.<br/>
 <br/>
I also shop for my children in used clothing and toy stores.  I<br/>
frequently find things that are brand new, even in their original<br/>
package or with tags still attached.  In affluent neighborhoods, parents<br/>
overbuy and the kids never even use some of the stuff.  The stuff in<br/>
resale shops is so nice that I&#39;d challenge anyone who thinks it&#39;s cruel<br/>
to make my kids have used stuff (there are people who think this) to go<br/>
through my children&#39;s things and point out which ones I&#39;ve bought used,<br/>
which ones their grandparents have bought new, and which ones I&#39;ve found<br/>
sitting next to a dumpster.  (I live in an apartment complex, and when<br/>
people move at the end of the month, they put tons of perfectly good<br/>
stuff they don&#39;t feel like taking with them right next to the dumpster.)<br/>

<h4>coyote&#39;s corner</h4>
<time>11 Apr 2003, at  8:41am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652999911">I have a beautiful gray suede suit (jacket; skirt) that is fabulous. Came out of &#39;trash&#39; that I found next to a chest of drawers. The chest of drawers was cleaned, fixed and sits in my bedroom. It&#39;s over 100 years old! The suit looks pretty good on me!<br/>
I buy many of our things at Savers (Used clothing and items). We have a brand new Pokemon Monopoly game that we paid 1.00 for. I have a beautiful black leather bag - 50 cents!!<br/>
Our grill - 4.00<br/>
<br/>
Also, friends bring things over because we send stuff to some of the reservations. We can&#39;t afford to send everything - so we barter some things. Some things we keep  - glasses and other breakables, some books ( I can&#39;t justify shipping romance novels about young white virgins and middle aged very wealthy white men to the rez!!) just go directly to Savers. <br/>
Brianna&#39;s bio-mom had a real big problem with this. She felt that all of Brianna&#39;s things should be new. She doesn&#39;t pay my bills. I just smile and say &quot;That&#39;s nice.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong w/ buying used. It saves money and frankly - Brianna is so hard on clothes, plus - she doesn&#39;t care what she wears or how she looks. She doesn&#39;t understand her friends that have tons of clothing.....Brianna feels the money should be spent on other things.<br/>
I buy underwear and socks new. I buy her shoes & sneakers new. I sometimes get her winter boots used. Sometimes not. She really doesn&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
One of the big problems I had w/ school was the consumerism that was taught.<br/>

Lots of stores here have candy-free aisles.   You can choose to go through <br/>
where all the kids see are disposable razors and chapstick and little <br/>
flashlights.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There&#39;s no reason<br/>
for my kids to beg for a little bag of M&Ms when they know there&#39;s a<br/>
huge bag of them at home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you offer the kids candy, they will stop being candy-needy, too.<br/>
My kids don&#39;t beg for candy because I&#39;ve offered it so many times.   <br/>
<br/>
Kind of related to this:<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s traditional advice even for parents without children to eat before going <br/>
to the grocery store so you don&#39;t shop hungry.   If you&#39;re waiting until <br/>
starvation is there to go to the store, you waited too long and a kid&#39;s <br/>
meltdown is YOUR fault.<br/>
<br/>
But taking from that and what we&#39;ve learned about kids not being needy, when <br/>
we&#39;re going to the movies now we usually make microwave popcorn just before <br/>
we go, and eat it on the way.  Then when we get to the theatre, the popcorn <br/>
doesn&#39;t smell so good, and the $4.75 price looks AWFUL since we just shared a <br/>
dollar&#39;s worth, all four or five of us.  Innoculated for about a quarter <br/>
apiece!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same here. Something that they re-learned today. Mother-in Law bought them 10 bars each of an English candy bar called a &#39;Tasty&#39;. Rhodri has just eaten every single one, one after the other. After 5 I<br/>
suggested that maybe he save the rest as we can&#39;t get them here plus he would feel sick.<br/>
he&#39;s 7. He ate all of them. He now feels sick. I&#39;ve given him a homeopathic remedy but I know he&#39;s learned a valuable lesson that me just ordering him to stop would not have taught him. In future I<br/>
imagine he&#39;ll save his candy just like the other two do.<br/>
<br/>
Now, anyone know what I can give him to relieve the discomfort of a tummy full of chocolate and toffee and rice-crispies?<br/>

  &lt;&lt;&lt;I also shop for my children in used clothing and toy stores.  I<br/>
  frequently find things that are brand new, even in their original<br/>
  package or with tags still attached.  In affluent neighborhoods, parents<br/>
  overbuy and the kids never even use some of the stuff.  The stuff in<br/>
  resale shops is so nice that I&#39;d challenge anyone who thinks it&#39;s cruel<br/>
  to make my kids have used stuff (there are people who think this) to go<br/>
  through my children&#39;s things and point out which ones I&#39;ve bought used,<br/>
  which ones their grandparents have bought new, and which ones I&#39;ve found<br/>
  sitting next to a dumpster.  (I live in an apartment complex, and when<br/>
  people move at the end of the month, they put tons of perfectly good<br/>
  stuff they don&#39;t feel like taking with them right next to the dumpster.)<br/>

&lt;&lt; I mean, they were just going to hell unless they became <br/>

<br/>
True!  It works just like ecology. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Souls count, &quot;the earth&quot; is only the platform we wait on while God sorts <br/>
people into heaven and hell, and animals don&#39;t have souls, they&#39;re just here <br/>
for us to eat or to pull our stuff around, so it&#39;s okay if species die out.  <br/>
They&#39;re not going to heaven anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason NOT to destroy all of any foreign culture is because some of <br/>
them might convert to Christianity if they live.<br/>

literally had about $16 per week available for groceries.  It didn&#39;t<br/>
seem so cheap then.  So I&#39;m already in the habit of not buying extras at<br/>

All of a sudden, Brianna looked up and across the width of the mall (keep in mind, this is RI - the malls here aren&#39;t as large as some I&#39;ve seen elsewhere!). Brianna nigh on climbed out of her umbrella stroller! She was crying, scared, almost panic stricken. She was looking at a little girl of around 8 or 10 years old. The little girl was staring at Brianna with such a look of hatred - pure hatred.<br/>
My aunt and I were trying to comfort Brianna. Brianna finally told us that when she was a little girl &#39;before&#39; that girl had hurt her allot.<br/>
Brianna told me that before she was born, she was star &#39;up there but not these&#39;.<br/>
I&#39;ve always felt that Brianna was meant for me to raise. I&#39;ve told her that her bio-mom had to have her because I couldn&#39;t. Have you read anything about reincarnation?

&lt;&lt; Is this fundy christian thing something you made up or for real? So<br/>
 fundamentalist christians aren&#39;t necessarily the spanking restricting<br/>
 parents that some say they are??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do know some people that take the bible literally, are extreme <br/>
conservatives BUT try to be positive parents that don&#39;t spank and let their <br/>
kids watch Harry Potter and what not.<br/>
I think that&#39;s where the separate term FUNDY came in.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I also was instructed (INSTRUCTED) to take out a quote by Shel Silverstein <br/>

I did an art class for a group like this once. Never again!  I had to be all <br/>
careful about the nudity in my art materials and such, it was ridiculous.<br/>
It&#39;s NOT worth the money.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from a storytelling home (my Mom was really into storytelling) I am <br/>
curious if you ever performed in Jonesboro, at the Storytelling festival?<br/>
That was one of the most magical weekends of my life, I hope to return one <br/>
day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004604998">I can bring you to a town that I had never been in - in fact - it&#39;s been a ghost town since well before my (this) birth. It&#39;s off the beaten track. I went to this town on instinct. I described to the people I was with. I even described the area on the far side of town and two of the structures - one of which was long gone.<br/>
<br/>
BTW-- have you read Nag Hammadi Library?<br/>
Are you aware that in non European versions of the bible - reincarnation is mentioned?<br/>
<br/>
Are you aware that many other people wrote of the life, times, death and resurrection of Jesus? Did you know that not all of these gospels were put into the New Testament? Some were rejected by Constantine & his wife for very political reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I often point out to people that through out history, people have believed in a great many religions. Each and every religion had very devout followers. What is the difference between a family of ancient Athens. A family that truly, in their heart and spirit knew - that Athena would/could bestow this ; they knew that the Labyrinth would do that - what is the difference?? So very many religions have taught re-incarnation. Furthermore - if you look at the natural world - everything is recycled - why not souls??<br/>
See - that, to me - makes perfect sense.<br/>

  &gt; Hmmm...if I may, I have been here before. There are many like me. We have <br/>
  &gt; lived before. Now, whether anyone believes or not is none of my business or <br/>
  &gt; my concern. I know I have lived and died at least three other times.<br/>

  You can prove that as easily as I can prove there is a heaven.   Again, all <br/>
  beliefs are questionable and upeach individual to accept or reject.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-276451571">Had the same type experience with my oldest child. She {being about 4 or so}said remembered when she had different parents but her sister {then a very young toddler} was her sister before, and she had a brother but her parents were different. She talked about her house and family and drew pictures. She remembered dying as well. {as far as I know she had nothing to give her ideas and I didn&#39;t praise her for this information, just listened and it was before I talked about them coosing me as a parent, which is what I believe} Now, later she doesn&#39;t remember it as well {she is 9 now} and we don&#39;t talk about it as much because she doesn&#39;t seem interested.My personal belief is we have things to learn and we carry over many things from previous lifetimes {that is one thing my MIL who is Christian and I do agree on}. My youngest from the time she was an infant has never liked to feel she is restrained, to the extream. She has basicly been EXTREAMLY clostraphobic since she was a tiny baby. And she was determined not to be enclosed {like of I had something to do and I tried to put her in a safe place til I could get it done. She would break out in a matter of a couple of minutesAll my children from the time they were born came in to this world with very different things that made them who they are. I learned the best way for us was for me to honor those differences so they could really trust me. And so they do. :)Tracy<br/>

All of a sudden, Brianna looked up and across the width of the mall (keep in mind, this is RI - the malls here aren&#39;t as large as some I&#39;ve seen elsewhere!). Brianna nigh on climbed out of her umbrella stroller! She was crying, scared, almost panic stricken. She was looking at a little girl of around 8 or 10 years old. The little girl was staring at Brianna with such a look of hatred - pure hatred.<br/>
My aunt and I were trying to comfort Brianna. Brianna finally told us that when she was a little girl &#39;before&#39; that girl had hurt her allot.<br/>
Brianna told me that before she was born, she was star &#39;up there but not these&#39;.<br/>
I&#39;ve always felt that Brianna was meant for me to raise. I&#39;ve told her that her bio-mom had to have her because I couldn&#39;t. Have you read anything about reincarnation? If you&#39;d like, we can talk of this off list. Although, reincarnation has much to do w/ my decision to unschool!!<br/>
