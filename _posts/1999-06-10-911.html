<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535665482">HI!<br/>
I just joined this list and wanted to introduce myself. I am still unclear <br/>
how it works so forgive any mistakes, please.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kelly and we have 2 sons ages 6 years and 6 months. We always knew <br/>
we wanted to homeschool but gave into pressure last year and sent our son to <br/>
public Kindergarten last year. We didn&#39;t last through November! Its amazing <br/>
what 3 months in that environment did to his creativity. <br/>
Since pulling him out we have been on a journey to find what will work best <br/>
for our family. We are clearly unschoolers but still have the panic attacks <br/>
now and then worrying if he should be doing more....it always passes.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041272718">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list and I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Wendy and I <br/>
live in Little Rock, Arkansas. We&#39;re homeschooling leaning toward more of an <br/>
unschooling approach. My son Dylan is six and Tristan is four. The past two <br/>
years, I&#39;ve purchased Oak Meadow which I really like. However, we haven&#39;t <br/>
picked it up for a couple months now so I would say we are on our way to <br/>
unschooling. My son Dylan LOVES numbers and money. He really is doing well in <br/>
math. On the other hand, he hates reading. I totally believe in unschooling <br/>
but honestly, it has been hard for me to not worry. I&#39;m not asking for any <br/>
advice or anything. It&#39;s just nice to know there are others out there like <br/>
me.  I guess I&#39;m still dealing with a husband who doesn&#39;t really &quot;get it&quot;. <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m glad to be here and look forward to participating in this group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-359070086">Hi, my name is Denise and I have two daughters.  Five and two.  My <br/>
husband pushed for homeschooling because of how scary it has gotten <br/>
for kids.  I really did not want to but I am so glad I have.  My <br/>
daughter really enjoys it but sees my sister (7) and my nephew (6) <br/>
just rave about school.  But I listen to them and it has nothing to <br/>
do with learning.  It usually what they did at lunch or someone <br/>
getting into trouble because of talking. This board has been so <br/>
helpful and has actually calmed my nerves a bit.  Thanks so much for <br/>
the great advise between everyone.  I usally sit on the sidelines and <br/>
just read but I had to say hello.</div>

goes...AH...about 3 weeks.  I dropped all the curriculum when I found <br/>
out I spend most of my time hurrying the kids along with their work <br/>
so we could get it ALL done in one day.  It was to stressful on us <br/>
all.  Right now the only thing I require them to do is math and a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-258764060">Hi all.<br/>
My name is Cathy, married to Craig, and living in South-Africa. I have 5<br/>
children, who have always been homeschooled, oldest is nearly 12, youngest<br/>
is 5 months.<br/>
I have always been a fairly flexible/relaxed homeschooler, and<br/>
have never used a pre-packaged curriculum (very unusual around here!!! -<br/>
many people in RSA, I think because of the HS movement still being so young<br/>
here, would feel VERY insecure without the guidance of their friendly<br/>
curriculum provider...)<br/>
I have been much inspired by the writings of Charlotte Mason, and to a large<br/>
extent it is due to her that I have become interested in Unschooling -<br/>
although she was not an unschooler, her incredible insights about the mind<br/>
of the child and having respect for children have laid a definite foundation<br/>
in my thinking.<br/>
I am particularly interested to clarify whether or not I can be both a<br/>
Christian and an Unschooler without compromising on one or the other - there<br/>
is fairly heated debate on this topic in homeschooling circles I notice! In<br/>
the short time that I have been conducting my &#39;&#39;research&#39;&#39;, I have become<br/>
convinced that it is possible, but I don&#39;t yet know how to explain how or<br/>
why!! As a result one of the things I am interested in is in<br/>
communicating with people who are Unschooling, and who are Christians, and<br/>
who feel that it is possible to reconcile the two.<br/>
We are currently conducting an &quot;Unschooling Experiment&quot; in our home (we have<br/>
been Unschooling since 9 October), and I am pretty excited (UNDERSTATEMENT)<br/>
with what I am observing. I am reading John Holt, who, I think,<br/>
introduced the seminal ideas that led to Unschooling, and I am challenged<br/>
and intrigued. I have also been reading the posts over the last 2 weeks, and<br/>
am really inspired<br/>
and encouraged.<br/>
I would like to know more, so I am here to learn....I hope all you veterans<br/>
won&#39;t mind too much answering the same old questions that I am bound to<br/>
ask!! My husband and I have been involved with the leadership of a<br/>
home-schooling association, and therefore know how much patience is required<br/>
when those really basic, level I questions keep being asked... :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028218332">Hello Cathy,<br/>
<br/>
I have come to a peaceful place knowing that I can be a Christian and an unschooler too.  I came out of a very school-at-home group of home schoolers and it was hard.  That is why I signed up for this list.  Virtually every home school co-op, mom&#39;s group, or any other hs group seemed very curriculum/scheduled/schoolie.  I knew that this wasn&#39;t right for me or my family.  It came down to having to stay away from these meetings, which left me little support.  I do know these folks as friends and fellow believers, but usually we stay away from &quot;education&quot; as a topic.  I find I have too much explaining to do, they know that I am relaxed and that&#39;s enough for them.  Maybe when I have more time, but then they seem very intimidated and threatened sometimes by what I say.  I really don&#39;t mean to say that what they are doing is wrong, but sometimes just telling them what I think is threatening to them.<br/>
<br/>
My faith does not say that I need to have lessons at a certain time of the day, Christianity does not say to me that I have to make my children learn certain things at certain times of the day or even certain times in their lives.  My example and the work of the Holy Spirit in THEIR HEARTS  is the key.  I provide all the learning tools (as my budget and time allow), my own curiosity of life and living and learning as an example, and trust God to work as well in their lives as he does in mine.<br/>

<h4>Angela</h4>
<p><small><time>11 Jan 2002, at  2:27pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74174252">Hi Cathy,<br/>
I have only been lurking here for a week or so, so will give a quick<br/>
intro....  I was on this list awhile back, but I couldn&#39;t take the volume of<br/>
e-mails.  I am trying it again, since I have a little more time to read.  I<br/>
am a Christian and an  unschooler.  My kids are 5 and 7 and we have always<br/>
unschooled.  I came to unschooling much like you did.  I first read &quot;A<br/>
Patchwork of Days&quot; by Nancy Lande.  Then I moved on the &quot;The Charlotte Mason<br/>
Companion&quot; and finally to John Holt&#39;s &quot;Teach Your Own&quot;, among other works.<br/>
<br/>
I personally feel that how our children learn has nothing to do with my<br/>
faith.  I value  the unschooling lists I am on  because they are the only<br/>
support I have for this way of life.  I am not really a part of a real life<br/>
support group on a regular basis, but I do some activities with a local<br/>
Christian group of a different denomination.  (My sil is part of the group)<br/>
I have shared what we do with a few people who have asked and I have gotten<br/>
a fairly positive response.  Two people said that they should try playing<br/>
more games with their kids instead of battling the workbooks.  I certainly<br/>
teach my children about God and Jesus, but I will never keep them from<br/>
learning about other faiths.  When it comes right down to it, you have a<br/>
stronger faith when you have explored all the other options and still<br/>
believe.  I actually enjoy learning about other faiths and cultures.<br/>
<br/>
O.K. about the quick intro. I mentioned.....I am Angela (insatiably<br/>
curious), Unschooling Mom to Leigh (7) and Lilly (5).  We live on a<br/>
want-to-be farm in Maine with a myriad of animals.  (cats, goats, guinea<br/>
pigs, hamster, rabbit, fish, laying hens)  Leigh loves cats and board games,<br/>
takes quite awhile to warm up to new people, and is quirky and sweet.  Lilly<br/>
loves to pretend more than anything.  She is learning to read and also likes<br/>
board games.  Her favorite pets are the guinea pigs.  She is cuddly and<br/>
cute.  And of course both are very bright!!  (I can say that, I am their<br/>
mom!)<br/>
<br/>
I strongly believe in unschooling, however I still get the doubts now and<br/>
then.  Should I make them read to me so they improve more quickly?  Will<br/>
they ever choose to do anything that is difficult  and not fun on their own?<br/>
Do I care what other people think?  I do know the answer to these questions,<br/>
yet they still plague me now and then; esp.. after talking with other people<br/>
who doubt what I say.  My mom is generally supportive, yet the other day she<br/>
asked me if I thought there would ever come a day when I had to make them do<br/>
something they don&#39;t want.  I take life one day at a time.  If I ever get to<br/>
the point where I feel that I must force them to learn, I will deal with it<br/>
then.  For right now, what we are doing is working fine.  When I start to<br/>
question myself, I journal what they are doing more.  This definitely helps.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, being unschooling Christians works for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119178937">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
       My name is Michelle.  I am new to this group.  I was refered to this <br/>
group by a very good friend of mine.  She does the unschooling for her <br/>
children and I was wanting something to try with my child.  My son starts <br/>
school in August and I don&#39;t think that he will benefit very much from it.  <br/>
He was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 4 and it is hard for him to just set <br/>
still for that long of time.  I don&#39;t know if I should keep him out of school <br/>
and unschool him at home or home school hime or send him to school yet.  That <br/>
is why I joined this group.  I wanted some ideas about unschooling and the <br/>
different things I can do to teach him and my 3 year old daughter at home.  I <br/>
just want them to be happy and enjoy learning because I remember when I was <br/>
in school and I didn&#39;t want to do my work because either it was to hard or to <br/>
easy or I was just bored.  I had a hard time in school and didn&#39;t want my <br/>
kids to go through that.  Besides keeping them away from at least some bad <br/>
things like drugs and so on are good for me :-).  I guess one of my questions <br/>
is are they going to get a proper education and is it OK to kept them out of <br/>
school like that without being fined?  Anyway, I hope to talk to each one of <br/>
you and here all your great ideas.  Have a good day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668693036">Hi Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
For plenty of excellent information about unschooling, I would suggest the message boards at unschooling.com. You can look things up by topic which I find an invaluable tool when looking for information pertaining to something I am interested in. This list will also be a big help to you in a more day to day way I think. Regardless, welcome, and there will be plenty of good advice coming your way.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling does not really concern itself with a &quot;proper education&quot;, but is child led learning based on their interests. For our family it is basically living and learning all the time, with each situation we encounter. There is never a time when school is on or off, we live our lives the best way we can, following our passions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815780374">The thing with little kids is not what you can teach them--their love of learning is so great, and no one has got it out of them yet.<br/>
The big thing with little kids is just to let them--and help them--learn.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 2 and 4 and we like to play (preschool physics, you know, gravity and densities and such, and interpersonal relations),<br/>
read together, go places (social sciences, if you will), and just live. There&#39;s not much you can do with kids that age that they&#39;re<br/>
not going to learn from, except making them sit down and shut up.<br/>
<br/>
It is entirely proper and legal for them to be educated in the real world, watching your real transactions with other real people and<br/>
things and processing them on their own level. They do not have to be in a room with other children their own age to learn what they<br/>
need in their lifetimes.<br/>
<br/>
Laws vary from state to state, but there are legal unschoolers in every state. Unschooling.com has a state message board that may<br/>
have traffic from your state, and there are other resources if you have legal questions.<br/>

down and shut up. I guess I used to create all sorts of ways to torture<br/>
and kill the people making me do it, but I&#39;m not sure that counts.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter and I go to the theater because we enjoy it, and we remain<br/>
seated and silent out of respect for the actors. &quot;Made&quot; and &quot;shut up&quot;<br/>
aren&#39;t part of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663104242">While I agree that many people learn a great deal while sitting quietly, I<br/>
don&#39;t think we do so when artificially forced to sit down and shut up. If I<br/>
dragged my kids to the theater and made them sit down and shut up, they&#39;d<br/>
probably resent it and get precious little from whatever the presentation was.<br/>
<br/>
When we decide to go to something, they enjoy it as long as their attention<br/>
remains on the presentation, but we leave soon after it wanes and I would have<br/>
to focus on keeping them quiet. Keep in mind, too, that it was very young<br/>
children under discussion.<br/>
<br/>
My own kids spent much of this week being quiet and contained as we waited for<br/>
our car to be fixed, then shopped for new cars and financing. They learned some<br/>
about the process, and some about people&#39;s tolerance for activity in various<br/>
adult settings, and they learned some about whatever was in the books they&#39;d<br/>
brought.<br/>

not include things like, &quot;your opinion is not worth listening to.&quot;  <br/>
There is a huge difference between sitting still and quiet at the <br/>
theater and being made to sit still and quiet 7 hours a day while <br/>
someone &quot;teaches&#39; you stuff.<br/>
<br/>
And in the kids talk a lot category . . .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669298324">Hi Mary,<br/>
<br/>
What do I learn when someone &quot;makes&quot; me sit down and shut up?  Me, personally?<br/>
<br/>
Well, that depends entirely on the situation.  If, for example, I am standing <br/>
at the theatre, and the usher shushes me and &quot;makes&quot; me sit down and shut up, <br/>
then I would learn about the play, or the ballet, or the music, or whatever <br/>
other event I was attending that evening.<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, I am rushing around the house trying to clean or cook, <br/>
and my husband takes a dirty dish or pan from my hands and &quot;makes&quot; me sit <br/>
down on the back porch with him and silently watch the sunset with him, then <br/>
I would learn how to be calm again, and centered, and to feel a part of the <br/>
beauty of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if I am merely talking to somebody, and they interrupt me, and &quot;make&quot; me <br/>
shut up and listen to them speak, then I would learn whatever it is they are <br/>
saying to me.<br/>
<br/>
I was not being facetious.  I was merely reminding myself (and anyone else <br/>
who wished to be reminded) that many times we learn much just from sitting <br/>
still and being silent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351193064">Soemthing that all three of mine seem to have learned somehow.  The <br/>
girls are quite comfortable being quiet, whether we are talking about <br/>
the quietness of solitude in the woods or the quiet that comes from <br/>
sitting in a crowd and just watching.  They&#39;ve learned there is value <br/>
in not speaking up, just as there is value in speaking up when you <br/>
feel strongly.<br/>
<br/>
And Wyndham, even my talker can sometimes find value in silence.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen often, but it does happen.<br/>

does.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I learned which adults were smarter and kinder than others.<br/>
I learned who I was going to try to avoid being around and darned if one of <br/>
those was not my MOTHER who said &quot;sit down and shut up&quot; WAY more than <br/>
necessary, and usually out of fear of what others would think.  Or out of a <br/>
kneejerk habit learned at her mother&#39;s knee.  (Somewhere in there, someone <br/>
was a jerk.)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had any problems with my kids in theatres.  We&#39;ve taken them to <br/>
movies since they were nurslings.  They&#39;ve gone to concerts and musical <br/>
theatre and plays.  <br/>
<br/>
If I take them to a place where they will lose interest and prefer to run <br/>
around, that is MY fault and my problem, not theirs.  And there have been <br/>
lots of times one of the adults there took a toddler to the back where he <br/>
could stretch and squat and wiggle without being in anyone else&#39;s line of <br/>
vision.  <br/>
<br/>
To command someone else to be interested in something is crazy.  It can&#39;t <br/>
happen.  That&#39;s why so  many school kids are drugged, so they can at least <br/>
feign an interest in what&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
If the parent is aware of the child&#39;s interests and prepares him for the play <br/>
or whatever, it can be great!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sit down and shut up&quot; is entirely disrespectful and counter-productive, and <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be encouraged.<br/>

<br/>
       I have a few questions please.  First, can someone tell me what the <br/>
difference is between home schooling and unschooling?  I was just wondering <br/>
being as I don&#39;t know that much about either one of them.  Also, if <br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t involve something like school books to teach from how do <br/>
you teach your child everything they need to learn to go to college with in <br/>
the future?  Finally, how many of you had unschooling when you were a child?<br/>
       I hope no one takes offence to these questions.  I was just wondering <br/>
because I just heard about unschooling the day I signed up to this group.  <br/>

then, but we realize now that&#39;s what it was, by golly. My brother and <br/>
I spent long days of doing whatever we pleased, exploring and <br/>
examining and going on endless field trips and travels and pretty <br/>
much left to our own devices as far as &quot;education&quot; went. I remember <br/>
endless hours of listening to stories, doing arts and crafts, <br/>
visiting museums, and just playing... We learned about so many <br/>
different things, in so many different ways, and met the most <br/>
fascinating people all the time.<br/>
<br/>
That was in the sixties. I was a normal schoolkid up until about the <br/>
fifth grade, when my teachers announced one day that I was too smart <br/>
for fifth grade and moved me up into sixth, causing me to leave all <br/>
my friends behind and try to fit in with a group of kids that I <br/>
simply couldn&#39;t relate to, no matter how hard I tried. Things went <br/>
downhill rapidly and when my parents realized how unhappy I was they <br/>
said if I was bright enough to skip a whole grade I was bright enough <br/>
to take charge of my own learning and so I did. Of course it didn&#39;t <br/>
take long for my brother to decide he&#39;d rather skip going to school <br/>
too and that was okay with Mom and Dad. My youngest brother and <br/>
sister (now in their late 30&#39;s) never went to school at all because <br/>
by the time they came along our folks had figured out that schooling <br/>
isn&#39;t all that important in assuring a child&#39;s true happiness.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, unschooling isn&#39;t something you do to a child. It&#39;s a way of living<br/>
life. :-) It isn&#39;t leading them somewhere. It&#39;s helping them grow into who<br/>
they are and who they will become, rather than who society insists they<br/>
should become.<br/>
<br/>
Did you make sure to teach them English? Or was English a useful tool they<br/>
used while living their lives? There are skills that adults find useful<br/>
(speaking, reading, arithmetic) and your job is to make sure they&#39;re useful<br/>
to your kids at home.<br/>
<br/>
How, you&#39;re probably asking ;-) By recognizing that, like English, reading<br/>
and arithmetic and geography and history and everything is part of life.<br/>
There really is no separate entity called &quot;history&quot; or &quot;science&quot;. It&#39;s just<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
They learn to read because they find it useful and because they have<br/>
pleasant associations with it. (Snuggling up reading in bed, listening to<br/>
books on tape, gaming guides and so forth.)<br/>
<br/>
They learn math because people around them speak math and it&#39;s a handy and<br/>
fascinating tool. Speaking math means figuring out the answers to questions<br/>
out loud.:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How long until Daddy gets home?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, it&#39;s 3 now and Daddy gets home at 6 so&quot; counting on fingers &quot;3 to 4<br/>
is one hour, 4 to 5 is another, 5 to 6 is another. So 3 hours.&quot; And I<br/>
usually converted that into number of favorite half hour shows since that<br/>
was a familiar chunk of time and it immerses them in fractions and<br/>
multiplication too. &quot;There are 2 Magic Schoolbuses in an hour, so 3 2&#39;s is 6<br/>
Magic Schoolbuses until he gets home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And, &quot;How long until Christmas?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, it&#39;s April now and Christmas is in December.&quot; counting on fingers<br/>
&quot;April, May, June, July, August, September, October, Novermber, December, so<br/>
9 months. Each month has 4 weeks. And 9 4&#39;s is 36.&quot; (Or you could do days.<br/>
Or be more exact as they get older and as Christmas gets nearer.)<br/>
<br/>
And, &quot;I&#39;ve got 58 cents and I found a quarter. Do I have enough for the $1<br/>
baseball card pack yet?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, 2 from the 25 gets the 58 up to 60, so we&#39;ve got 60 + 20 + 3 or 83<br/>
cents. Which is 7 to get the 83 up to 90 and 10 to get the 90 up to 100, so<br/>
you need 17 more cents.&quot; (That&#39;s *one* way of breaking up the problem.<br/>
There&#39;s oodles of ways. I think it&#39;s vitally important to avoid pencil and<br/>
paper math -- unless they like it of course! Break problems up in your head<br/>
so you can solve them outloud. That way kids can see how numbers work.)<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need to fully grasp it, just get the jist of it. Just as they<br/>
don&#39;t understand every word we use. They just get the sense of what we&#39;re<br/>
saying from the words they do understand. But the presence of the words (and<br/>
the math concepts) they don&#39;t fully understand are just as important as the<br/>
words they do understand because they&#39;re in the process of understanding<br/>
them. They can&#39;t acquire new words unless they&#39;re available.<br/>
<br/>
History is reading books and watching movies set in the past. And then<br/>
talking about how their lives were different, perhaps immediately, perhaps a<br/>
month later, whenever they ask. Usually kids will be more fascinated by the<br/>
physical aspects (bathrooms, eating, traveling) when they&#39;re young. Later<br/>
the social aspects. (Back then there were very very few women doctors<br/>
because society thought women shouldn&#39;t work outside the home.) And still<br/>
later the political aspects. (Teddy Roosevelt was president then and he had<br/>
different ideas about how the country should be run.)<br/>
<br/>
(But none of that is a given. They may only want to hear stories set in the<br/>
here and now. They may grasp politics at 5. ;-) Whatever they&#39;re drawn to is<br/>
what&#39;s right for them. :-)<br/>

&gt; in school and I didn&#39;t want to do my work because either it was to hard or to<br/>
&gt; easy or I was just bored.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the way to enjoy learning is by pursuing what interests them, and being<br/>
able to stumble across new things that are intriging. (And just as<br/>
important, being able to explore something only for a moment, or ignore<br/>
something they don&#39;t find fascinating yet. (No matter how vital you think it<br/>
is for their future! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess one of my questions<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will depend how you define &quot;proper education&quot;. If you hold onto the idea<br/>
that schools have an exclusive monopoly on what constitutes a proper<br/>
education then unschooling will frustrate you. If you can embrace a new<br/>
model of &quot;proper education&quot; as helping your children become themselves then<br/>
you&#39;ll all do great :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565986170">---if <br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t involve something like school books to teach from how<br/>
do <br/>
you teach your child everything they need to learn to go to college with<br/>
in <br/>
the future?---<br/>
I think if you go to unschooling.com and some other unschooling sites you<br/>
can find a lot of answers to your questions.  <br/>
I came upon unschooling by accident last year when I read a book at the<br/>
library in the homeschooling section.  My kids were all in school, (I<br/>
have four kids).  But I did not feel it was how I wanted to live.  The<br/>
only problem was, I had homeschooled before but always felt like a<br/>
failure.  I had mostly homeschooled my oldest because he was energetic<br/>
and expressive in ways that didn&#39;t suit the teachers.  Homeschooling<br/>
didn&#39;t work for me because I always felt like I was supposed to make my<br/>
kids do so much work on so many subjects, just like at school.  Then they<br/>
either wouldn&#39;t do it, or they would do it but later on tests wouldn&#39;t<br/>
remember it.  I would see other moms who were probably unschoolers who<br/>
said they let their kids find their own curriculum.  I thought, &quot;Man,<br/>
these moms really have their act together.  I could never be that smart.&quot;<br/>
 But, when I read that book at the library called The Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook, my eyes were opened.  It doesn&#39;t take a lot of smarts, or<br/>
organizational skills, it just takes listening to the children like they<br/>
are important individuals with a mind of their own and dreams of their<br/>
own.  Which of course, they are.  I remember how much passion I had for<br/>
music growing up, yet my parents never noticed that I was passionately in<br/>
love with music.  So, I floundered along doing school when all I really<br/>
was interested in was writing, reading, foreign languages and music.  The<br/>
most learning I got in music was from choir.  Yet, I wanted to learn<br/>
instruments.  I lived with my sister for a while and she had a piano so I<br/>
paid for lessons with my babysitting money.  My piano teacher encouraged<br/>
me to continue since I had a talent for it.  But when I moved, we had no<br/>
piano and no one would pay for lessons.  I would have taught myself if I<br/>
had even known it was possible.  School had taught me that I could only<br/>
do what I was told, not what I sought out and figured out on my own.  If<br/>
my parents would have paid for my music lessons, bought a piano (or<br/>
helped me figure out how to find one to use or pay for one myself), then<br/>
turned me loose at the library, I would have been perfectly happy.<br/>
Anyway, along with unschooling came a whole new thought system.  I had to<br/>
really see my children as the wonder that they are.  To really listen. <br/>
And with that came the realization that I have tried to conform them to a<br/>
false standard of acceptability.  I have had to change my thinking that<br/>
the parent&#39;s job is to control the children.  The adversarial<br/>
relationship is no more.  Now we have communication.  I have had to read<br/>
many books, because it is hard to grasp some of these new concepts.  So,<br/>
I have been unschooling myself as well.<br/>
Today I was getting ready to go somewhere, and babysitting.  I enlisted<br/>
the help of two of my sons to straighten up a bit.  I asked my oldest to<br/>
clean the kitchen-it wasn&#39;t very messy.  He whined and said he had<br/>
cleaned it yesterday.  I said, &quot;Well, what would you prefer to clean?&quot; <br/>
He chose the living/dining area.  My younger son cleaned the kitchen, but<br/>
I noticed he was goofing off when it came time to do the dishes.  I<br/>
thought maybe he did not understand how to do them, so, holding the baby,<br/>
I went in and said I would guide him to show him how to do it.  He said,<br/>
&quot;I already know how to do it, Mom.  I just hate to clean the dishes.&quot;  I<br/>
said, &quot;What do you like to clean?&quot;  He said, &quot;I like to pick up things<br/>
and put them away, but I hate to wash the dishes.&quot;  So, he picked up the<br/>
dirty dishes and put away the clean ones, then I buckled the baby in the<br/>
stroller and washed them.<br/>
Now, here is how it would have happened in the past.  I ask for help. <br/>
Kids whine or do half-hearted job.  I whine or put-down kids.  Either I<br/>
just give up,(forget it, I&#39;ll do it), or I get mad(power struggle).  Kids<br/>
lose &#39;cause I&#39;m bigger or I lose &#39;cause kids have more energy. <br/>
Now I&#39;m not discouraged by their whines or their body language that says<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t want to do what you want me to do.&quot;  Now, we talk about it.  I<br/>
see their whining or their body language not as a challenge to my<br/>
authority but as an attempt to communicate.  It is an opportunity to<br/>
really listen.<br/>
This is what unschooling has done for me in less than a year.  Life is so<br/>
much more pleasant.  I absolutely love it!<br/>
