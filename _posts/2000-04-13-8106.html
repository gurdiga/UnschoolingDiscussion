&gt; Anyway, I&#39;d love some feedback on this- what do you tell your children<br/>
&gt; about your homeschooling methods?<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Lyn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I started homeschooling in Jan. this year... I started out &quot;schooling&quot; but<br/>
quickly moved over into unchooling.  At first I just did it, but after a<br/>
month or so, I felt they deserved an explaination of why daddy wasnt making<br/>
them do any schoolwork they didnt want to.  I explained to them that I<br/>
believed children learn best when they are interested in what they are<br/>
learning... and that as long as they were at home I didn&#39;t intend to force<br/>
any learning on them.  I also explained that learning is like breathing...<br/>
you are always learning every moment.  We had this conversation a few<br/>
times... Once it went no-where.  The next times the boys really cought on to<br/>
the idea... saying that in that moment they had just learned that they were<br/>
always learning , and then going on giving me a play by play announcement of<br/>
all the things they were learning as they sat there talking to me.<br/>
<br/>
The other day our 6 yo floored us all by proclaiming to some people my wife<br/>
was introducing him to, when asked what he did at home for school,  &quot;I am in<br/>
the school of life.... God is my teacher!&quot; Pretty surprizing since we are<br/>
not at all religous.  We do talk about spiritual matters freely though...<br/>
But I still get the &quot;we didnt do anything&quot; routine from them often as well.<br/>
I have tried going through with them all the worthwhile things that I saw<br/>
happen during a day when they say something like this.  I think it makes an<br/>
impression about how playing at this and that are valued equally to doing a<br/>
math work-sheet in my eyes.. I think it helps them realize that they are not<br/>
wasting their time at all... but in fact are learning in their own style.<br/>
Things like pointing out the amount of addition and division required to<br/>
play risk, or the strategy involved in chess, the science in making bread,<br/>
or the care and effort involved in emptying the dishwasher.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey that is the name of our &quot;school&quot;<br/>
Evolve<br/>
The school of life<br/>
WOW<br/>
My kids tell people freely that they are home schooled (although at times I <br/>
see them try to avoid saying much because people say &quot;really oh&quot; and then <br/>
kind of don&#39;t give them much input.  I think they feel as though they are <br/>
aliens in those situations and have realized that it is best to avoid <br/>
telling these types of people.......<br/>
When we first started unschooling.....before that we were just <br/>
playing!.....they did tell people that they played all day (and I DO <br/>
still), but now they will tell them other things like we sold candy or we <br/>
made cookies.  In PA you have to keep a journal and they help me with it <br/>
and see what I record so they know that their playing amounts to <br/>
something.  They just took their tests the other day and shocked and <br/>
surprised me to no end what they DID learn!<br/>
Whew! IT WORKS!!<br/>
Anyways<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say that my 9 year old has not started developing nor has my 11 <br/>
year old BUT there was a point where I thought that Brittany&#39;s hormones <br/>
were pumping (she is 11) BUT it was actually too much socialization ---she <br/>
was giving me the attitude (that I thought was normal---NOPE) and other <br/>
such things that you would relate to maturity...<br/>
SO I locked her back up in the dungeon (NO really I am kidding)<br/>
So I said Brittany I think that you are picking up some bad habits from all <br/>
this socialization (brownies, dance, etc) and I cannot live like this and <br/>
you are not happy either so I think that we need to cut back and come back <br/>
home and if you think that you can pull together and realize that it is not <br/>
acceptable to behave in such a negative fashion then we can try it <br/>
again.  We did not leave her classes as she saw the errror of mimicking <br/>
this behavior.....And I saw where she was just asking for some <br/>
companionship (instead of rocking and boob) that she had moved on to <br/>
another level in out relationship and instead of moving away or out she had <br/>
moved closer and freer to me<br/>
<br/>
It is wonderful that she is growing and I enjoy every moment of it!<br/>
<br/>
I cannot wait till she has more growth and I can share in her life on <br/>
another level<br/>
Love POD....who is up at 5 AM with a stiff neck (I fear the chiro)<br/>

<div><font size="2">Ha!&nbsp; This reminds me of something I read once in an old 
Preschool Playgroups Association Handbook (I think, though it may have been 
something about empathetic response) about how children react to being asked 
stuff.&nbsp; That a parent had overheard another asking her son how school had 
been that day, saying &#39;did you have fun?&#39;&nbsp; The reply was, &#39;nah it was 
boring.&#39;&nbsp; The mother just said &#39;Oh.&#39;&nbsp; It tickled me at the time to 
think that this child (who would still have been at the &#39;nursery&#39; or kindy stage 
of school) would say this although he&#39;d probably spent the whole time doing 
everything in sight.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Anyway, we haven&#39;t actually discussed what we do, just that 
they&#39;re not going, but they are quite often with me when I start talking to 
others about it, and so I think they get to know what I think from that.&nbsp; 
And since it&#39;s one thing that I&#39;m clear on my stance on :-) I&#39;m not going to 
give them mixed messages that way.</font></div>

 Anyway, I&#39;d love some feedback on this- what do you tell your children<br/>
 about your homeschooling methods?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember one time at the grocery store when the checker asked if my dd<br/>
was in school and she said no we homeschool.  The checker said to dd &quot;oh<br/>
your mom teaches you?&quot;  and dd said &quot;no my mom doesn&#39;t teach me anything&quot;<br/>
LOL, talk about a cringing moment.  My children have never been to school,<br/>
so they don&#39;t know that there  are different hsing methods.  What I explained<br/>
to my children how school was and what they actually did there and then <br/>
explained to her that we learn from the world around us and from reading<br/>
books and playiing and doing things, she really picked up on it right away.<br/>
She was almost 5 at the time.  She will now tell you that you don&#39;t have to go<br/>
to school to learn things, but by going places and doing things and exploring.<br/>
Every evening my kids ask me if tomorrow is a day off (meaning are we going<br/>
anywhere, be it fun/park/or just running errands).  Tonight they asked me and<br/>
I said yes, tomorrow is but on Sunday we have a fun nature walk planned with<br/>
some of our friends.  They were all excited and wished it were tomorrow.  <br/>
After<br/>
a moment, my dd asks me&quot;mom, do kids who go to school get a day off on their<br/>
birthdays?&quot;  I said &quot;no they don&#39;t&quot; and you should have seen and heard her <br/>
expression!!  &quot;They don&#39;t ?!?!  I don&#39;t ever want to go to school!!&quot;  She was<br/>
just incredulous!  She said do they get any days off?  I told her yes they do <br/>
and<br/>
went on to explain that there are 7 days in a week and on Monday when our <br/>
secretary is here, kids go to school every day for five days including Friday<br/>
when we go to the Farmers Market, but that the next day, tomorrow , Saturday, <br/>
would be their day off and that they would have two days off together before <br/>
they would go back to school. (I also threw in that they would have to do <br/>
schoolwork on their days off too &lt;eg&gt;) Oh and when dad comes home from<br/>
work and says what did you do today, they often say play, but if they can&#39;t<br/>
remember, he chimes in for them and says did you play today?!  I guess he <br/>
sees the value in play and just being a kid too!! <br/>
