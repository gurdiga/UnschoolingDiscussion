<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; One of my finest memories is of finding one of the Ninja Turtles worshipping <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jesus in a creche scene one Christmas when Kirby was four or five.  One of <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; shepherds was off fighting the Foot.   He had that cool staff (crook).<br/>

manger and put it in weird positions. Sometimes he rode the mule, sometimes he hung <br/>
up at the top with the angel.<br/>

Something I haven&#39;t seen discussed on this list before is whether or <br/>
not anyone has ever considered hiring someone to help with <br/>
housework?  You can find people to clean for 5-10 dollars an hour.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been toying with the idea...if someone came once or twice a week <br/>
for a few hours at a time...<br/>
******************************************<br/>
We have someone who comes every two weeks to clean, and it makes us a very <br/>
happy family. We are not particularly neat people, so every two weeks we need to <br/>
straighten up and put stuff away so that Rose can come in and clean. She does <br/>
floors, dusting, and all kinds of other stuff that we never get around to. <br/>
When we come back the house looks and smells clean and nice.  For us it&#39;s <br/>
definitely worth it.<br/>
