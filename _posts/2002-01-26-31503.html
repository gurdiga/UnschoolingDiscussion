<div id="ygrps-yiv-28073216">Here is a link to a local story:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Read the first few headlines and you&#39;ll have nothing but empathy for the <br/>
overcrowding in ps that has brought a split session for these poor <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Some of them start class at 7am and go until 12 WITHOUT a break, the <br/>
others start at 12 and go until 5.<br/>
<br/>
These children have to go to school in the dark, or return in the dark. <br/>
In a city that is definately not a safe place.<br/>
<br/>
My heart goes out to them and their misinformed parents for feeling they <br/>
have no alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
with deep empathy,<br/>
