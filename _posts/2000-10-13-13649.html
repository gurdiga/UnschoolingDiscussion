<div id="ygrps-yiv-116209584">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
A news story has been published today on &quot;education reform&quot; in Japan and <br/>
how such reform is being handled by the Japanese government.<br/>
<br/>
Prime Minister Mori is not entirely clear on how he wants to &quot;revise&quot; the <br/>
current Constitution-based &quot;Fundamental Law of Education&quot; in Japan, but <br/>
it would appear that he is aiming for much tighter reform of state <br/>
education, not looser.<br/>
<br/>
According to an earlier news account, Mori intends to include &quot;patriotic <br/>
sentiment and respect for Japanese culture and tradition&quot; in the revised <br/>
law he is pushing for (Daily Yomiuri, 5 Oct. 2000).<br/>
<br/>
As the article below shows, Prime Minister Mori may actually be turning <br/>
back the educational clock more than a century in Japan when it comes to <br/>
his so-called &quot;reform package.&quot; Mori apparently wants to revise the <br/>
current Constitution-based &quot;Fundamental Law of Education&quot; (adopted in <br/>
postwar 1947) to be more reflective of the former Shinto religion-based <br/>
&quot;Imperial Rescript on Education&quot; (issued in 1890 -- yes, that&#39;s *1890*, <br/>
folks).<br/>
<br/>
The latter, issued by the then-reigning emperor of Japan, calls on the <br/>
nation as loyal, educated &quot;subjects&quot; to &quot;guard and maintain the <br/>
prosperity of Our Imperial Throne coeval with heaven and earth&quot; <br/>
(quote-unquote).<br/>
<br/>
Which all goes to show that the Japanese government can kick around an <br/>
education football just as well as any other government in the world can.<br/>
<br/>

MORI REQUESTS EDUCATION LAW REVISION REPORT BY NEXT SPRING<br/>
<br/>
Yomiuri Shimbun<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Wednesday asked Hirofumi Shimomura, the <br/>
vice chairman of a Liberal Democratic Party committee on education, to <br/>
compile a report detailing LDP opinions on the revision of the <br/>
Fundamental Law of Education by next spring.<br/>
<br/>
While Mori expressed a strong desire to revise the law in the hope that <br/>
the LDP will be able to use the revision as a focal point in the House of <br/>
Councillors election campaign next summer, LDP ruling coalition ally New <br/>
Komeito is strongly opposed to a hasty revision of the law.<br/>
<br/>
Shimomura told Mori that the discussion on the law&#39;s revision -- which <br/>
was being conducted by an LDP research group on education reform and <br/>
chaired by former Education Minister Kosuke Hori -- had been delayed.<br/>
<br/>
Shimomura then told Mori that the LDP should take the revision of the law <br/>
seriously, partly to promote Mori as an education reform advocate.<br/>
<br/>
Mori asked Shimomura to draw up a report on the law&#39;s revision by next <br/>
spring so that the party could use it in the upper house election <br/>
campaign next summer.<br/>
<br/>
Mori&#39;s willingness to revise the law comes after some LDP members voiced <br/>
strong support for the revision.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We need to consider revising the law as various education problems have <br/>
emerged under the current Fundamental Law of Education,&quot; said an LDP <br/>
member who has long been involved in education matters.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, an LDP faction led by Takami Eto and LDP Policy <br/>
Research Council Chairman Shizuka Kamei, with which Mori has aligned <br/>
himself in an attempt to strengthen his base within the party, agreed at <br/>
a meeting to work to revise the law.<br/>
<br/>
Kamei told Mori that an outline of the revision should be compiled before <br/>
the upper house election, and urged him to advance the government&#39;s <br/>
schedule to work on the revision.<br/>
<br/>
The government intends to revise the law after the next ordinary Diet <br/>
session, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hidenao Nakagawa.<br/>
<br/>
Kamei met Mori on Wednesday and said: &quot;Education reform is the raison <br/>
d&#39;etre of the Mori Cabinet. We should use a proposal on the revision of <br/>
the Fundamental Law of Education as a focal point in the upper house <br/>
election campaign.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
New Komeito leader Takenori Kanzaki said at a press conference the same <br/>
day that he had no reason to give his opinions on what other political <br/>
parties would do individually.<br/>
<br/>
Kanzaki then said, &quot;However, as a coalition ally, we will express our <br/>
opinion in the discussions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kanzaki said in an article in the party&#39;s gazette dated Sunday, &quot;It is <br/>
overly simplistic and anachronistic to blame the Fundamental Education <br/>
Law for (current child-related) problems, and to call for a reevaluation <br/>
of the defunct Imperial Rescript on Education.&quot;<br/>
