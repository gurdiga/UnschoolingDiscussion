&lt;&lt; So - if I put out a box load of pattern blocks on the coffee table and <br/>
wake up in the morning to discover that kids have played with them --- <br/>
that is unschooling or not, depending on what I was THINKING when I did <br/>
it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that&#39;s beyond rational.<br/>
<br/>
YES, mothers need to deschool themselves.  Yes.<br/>
And one thing that helps the most is for the to really see their kid learning <br/>
without being taught.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom wanted to try unschooling but she was skeptical and didn&#39;t think it <br/>
would work, still if she put some things out and discovered her children were <br/>
learning, she would be a step closer to believing it could work lifelong.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m in the middle of reading George Orwell&#39;s &quot;1984&quot; and I can&#39;t help <br/>
reading things like the above and thinking &quot;Thought Police.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people are better at reading other people&#39;s thoughts than others <br/>
(--Howard Gardner&#39;s interpersonal intelligence writings), and most kids wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
or care what their mother intended.  Those who had been in school recently or <br/>
been schooled at home recently REALLY wouldn&#39;t care, as long as they weren&#39;t <br/>
being assigned to do a particular thing.  And they  might just avoid the <br/>
presented whatever, but that has always been a part of the &quot;leave stuff out&quot; <br/>
advice.  Let them take it or leave it, and let your reactions to that be a further <br/>
part of your work to get to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-A parent who thinks her kids might benefit from and enjoy learning a <br/>
bit more about mathematical shapes strews pattern blocks in their path. <br/>
Leaving a pile of pattern blocks on the table for kids to discover on <br/>
their own and to DECIDE on their own if they are, or are not, <br/>
interested and to play with them in their own way - is NOT a &quot;schoolish <br/>
agenda.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a learning agenda, maybe.<br/>
I&#39;ve always hoped my kids would learn.  Gosh and golly, I still do.  But I&#39;ve <br/>
never *made* them learn (or thought I could).  I&#39;ve never prided myself on <br/>
being their only teacher and I&#39;ve never thought it was because of me that they <br/>
could walk or talk.  But I have thought it was because of me that they could be <br/>
left alone to learn to read in their own ways.   I manipulated the rest of <br/>
the world to leave them alone, I didn&#39;t manipulate the kids.<br/>
