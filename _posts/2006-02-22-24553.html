<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596215072">I was explaining in an earlier post, that it seems the only time I mop<br/>
is after some huge &quot;experiment&quot; disaster around here.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this morning, Sierra pulls something out from under the couch<br/>
and comes to show me...giggling to herself the entire time. When she<br/>
opens her hand to show me, it&#39;s a film canister lid, encrusted with<br/>
baking soda (from our &quot;rocket&quot; fun).<br/>
Yeah, we find weird stuff here and there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-483358019">We don&#39;t have a dog, but sometimes take care of a bijon frisee here in our home.  Sasha was here for two weeks this month (her family went to Italy!).  She is on a strict diet and spends a great deal of her waking hours combing the floor for food.  I didn&#39;t notice until after she had been gone for about a week, but my kitchen floor stayed so clean while she was here.  She must have been actually licking the floor or something...<br/>
<br/>
Last night I noticed it was looking pretty grungy.  It&#39;s a small area.  I used to clean it with a wet rag, but my mom bought me a swifter - the basic one that attaches to a special cloth.<br/>
<br/>
I was using it and commenting to Jackie (who was watching the Olympics nearby) how much more I enjoyed the swifter over the way I used to do it.  I said it might not clean it quite as good, but it was easier and more pleasant.  She said she remembered when she used to wash the floor by skating on wet rags and asked if she could do that.  I helped her get two old washcloths, which she tied around her feet.  That worked for a few minutes but came untied fairly quick, and she asked if she could just get her socks wet and skate in them.  She did, with great pleasure.<br/>

feet and they have a blast skating through the house.  <br/>
We have a black lab and I can&#39;t believe how much dog hair gets on <br/>
the sheets even after I have swept and mopped the floors (the <br/>
skating works a lot better if the floors are clean)<br/>
