<div id="ygrps-yiv-518660971">Hello, I&#39;m Tracy in West Yorkshire, England.  My 2 daughters are 14 months<br/>
apart almost 4 and 2&1/2, and one is &#39;more sensitive,&#39; while the other is<br/>
&#39;more physical.&#39;  I&#39;m on my way to check out the Born to Explore website<br/>
right now!  My husband works at home, and I&#39;m a volunteer, I&#39;ll tell you<br/>
about that later, and I&#39;ve recently started writing atricles for a website.<br/>
<br/>
Our state school system seems to becoming intensly focused on league tables,<br/>
and literacy and numeracy, seemingly to the exclusion of everything else.<br/>
The more I look at where I want my girls to be (and me too!) the more I feel<br/>
that school is just not it!<br/>
<br/>
I hope to get encouragement and support as well as infromation from this<br/>
list, and I&#39;ll try to add my twopennerth as often as poss!  Starting with...<br/>
on the subject of motivation, the featured article last week(?  perhaps the<br/>
week before) on Unschooling.com was excellent on this subject.  I know<br/>
nothing about ADD or depression, (except the severely introspective variety<br/>
I found myself mired in during dd1&#39;s first year) but the food allergy is a<br/>
definite maybe.  It might seem odd for a child of your son&#39;s age but perhaps<br/>
an LLL Leader would have good info on local resources for allergy problems.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know you all!<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
Tracy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026006241">Hi Tracey.  Nice to meet you.  I&#39;m new to this loop too.  My sister lives in<br/>
England.  I&#39;ll introduce myself in a bit.  Just a quick question, maybe the<br/>
terminology is different in America, what are league tables?<br/>
