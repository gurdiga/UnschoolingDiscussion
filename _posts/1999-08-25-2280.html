<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059384101"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I know that it may not be a popular stance today, but why are people<br/>
 </span></blockquote>having children if they are trying to unload them?� The excuse that the<br/>
parent has to work is not a legitimate one-I know people who do have to<br/>
support the family and still homeschool.� Sorry, just my 2 cents!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>life<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; WAS a mother. I&#39;ve had a similar discussion with my sis-in-laws and it<br/>
&gt;&gt; shocked me that some people feel it&#39;s their right to be able to &quot;unload&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; their children on the schools. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, I&#39;ll add my .02 cents, since this discussion seems to be getting hot.<br/>
While I am very supportive of mothers having careers and being able to work<br/>
if they choose, I feel the same as the above statements.  Financial needs<br/>
are a percieved reason for both parents working.  It is not a necessity.<br/>
Folks in this country are so brainwashed by the media and the consumer<br/>
culture that they think they &quot;need&quot; much more than they really do.  It is a<br/>
lifestyle &quot;choice&quot; which many claim to be unable to change.  <br/>
<br/>
We do not &quot;NEED&quot; to buy clothes new in retail outlets, with so many options<br/>
for second hand goods and wholesale or wharehouse shopping.  That is a<br/>
choice.  We do not &quot;NEED&quot; to eat meat every day or other expensive foods,<br/>
nor buy convenience foods.  That is a choice.  We do not &quot;NEED&quot; to have a<br/>
buying orgy for gift giving during the holiday season.  That is a choice.<br/>
We do not &quot;NEED&quot; to purchase gifts based on TV shows or movies for our<br/>
children, buy video games, computer programs, or computers for that matter.<br/>
 We do not need cable, VCRs or even TVs.  Those are ALL lifestyle choices.<br/>
<br/>
The quality of your life does not have anything to do with how much money<br/>
you make.  But your luxury level DOES have to do with money, and Wants and<br/>
Needs are two very different things.  The choice of how to parent, whether<br/>
one chooses homeschooling and Stay at Home, Institutionalized Schooling and<br/>
Working, or some other combination of these and other factors, is a luxury<br/>
that we have as citizens in a modern and wealthy nation.  The cop-out of<br/>
saying that one has &quot;no choice&quot; when that is probably not the case, is<br/>
often done unconciously.  People (whom I think of as &quot;Sleepwalkers,&quot; going<br/>
through the motions of life and are not really growing or thinking deeply,)<br/>
often do not see their choices for what they are, or do not see that they<br/>
even HAVE choices until they really WAKE UP and start thinking in new ways.<br/>
 These people are not READY to do it any other way, and it has to happen<br/>
for them in their own time, sometimes not at all.  <br/>
<br/>
I made a choice when I became a mother (and long before that) to stay home<br/>
with my children.  My choice must then be supported by and reflected in the<br/>
other choices I make for my life.  Where to work and what to do (work at<br/>
home could have been an option had I been a single mother,) What I do with<br/>
my children, etc, are choices too.  I choose to be a very active in my<br/>
children&#39;s upbringing and I do not want to send them off to be raised by<br/>
someone(S) else I hardly know, if at all, for most of their waking hours.<br/>
That is MY choice and what works for me.  But that does not mean that I do<br/>
not respect and accept the choices of others, and try not to be<br/>
judgemental.  Everyone is at a different place in this life, and most<br/>
people move up and down the path, and diverge onto those less beaten tracks<br/>
as well, throughout their lifetimes.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457140874">Nanci, an everyone else,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say that I really liked what you said about it being a cop out <br/>
when people say they dont have a choice, they have to work.  I hate this too, <br/>
because we make daily sacrifices to homeschool, and to be with our kids full <br/>
time.  I wish people took more responsibilities for thoier choices.<br/>
<br/>
However, I dont think its fair to say that these people work to pay for more <br/>
expensive cars or groceries, or whatever.  I work part time at night when my <br/>
husband is with the kids, because we couldn&#39;t make the bills otherwise.  We <br/>
dont have cable, we get the internet free, we dont have a/c, we dont eat meat <br/>
at all, all our clothes are hand me downs, we do our own car repairs, we <br/>
stopped drinking soda, we recieve financial aid for college, etc.  It isnt a <br/>
matter of giving up luxuries, because the only one left to give up is staying <br/>
home with the kids, and we wont give that one up.  <br/>
<br/>
I dont mean to offend anyone at all by this-- I just mean to say that we <br/>
should all be supportive of one another-- just like us at home moms hate when <br/>
the stereotypes of us are passed around (bon bons and the soap operas, right? <br/>
LOL) I wouldnt want to pass on the stereotype that parents who work outside <br/>
the home do it for more luxuries.  I know sometimes its hard to believe that <br/>
people cant live on one income, but its true in some cases.  My ideal <br/>
situation would be that we both would work part time!  Maybe someday :)<br/>

from firsthand experience and from close family members experiences what it<br/>
is like to struggle to get your basic needs met in this economy, and I get<br/>
irritated myself when someone online implies that something like a few<br/>
thousand dollars (or more) is &quot;No big deal&quot; and easy for anyone to come up<br/>
with.  In the process of our adoption research I have run across many folks<br/>
who think this way, and are obviously coming from a much more privileged<br/>
lifestyle than we are.<br/>
<br/>
I still do believe that many people who think that they have no choice,<br/>
really do.  They just cannot differentiate between their needs and their<br/>
wants enough to be able to cut some of the superfluous.  My SIL would LOVE<br/>
to stay home with her girls, but they just cannot afford to right now, and<br/>
THAT IS the truth, much like your situation.  But that is not always the<br/>
case for folks who claim that they HAVE to work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281695958">I have to jump in here with another perspective. I choose to work outside the<br/>
home, first off because I love what I do (I teach child development at the<br/>
community college). It affords me a flexible schedule, only 3 mornings a week and<br/>
7 Saturdays (at least for this 18 week semester, my schedule changes every few<br/>
months), with lots of time off. Second, my dh is a much better housekeeper than I<br/>
am:) He is in school full-time and we often do tag team parenting, but he does<br/>
most of the child care and housework and cooking. My dh will never have a<br/>
fulltime job, he doesn&#39;t want one and he is not a good employee (ah, authority;),<br/>
I knew that when I married him. I am the one with the ambitions and the ability<br/>
to make money.<br/>
<br/>
I have just read the Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Lewellyn (sp?),<br/>
eventhough we don&#39;t have teenagers (my kids are 26 mos and 5 mos). I have to say<br/>
it was liberating for me and my schooled mind. The first section in her book<br/>
directly addresses this line of discussion and makes so much sense. I recommend<br/>
everyone read this book, for yourself and your journey whether or not you have<br/>
teenagers. I wish I had read it 15 years ago!<br/>
<br/>
Not being able to differentiate between needs and wants is only a small part of<br/>
the issue. Realizing that you actually have a choice is the biggest hurdle. We<br/>
have friends who really believe they do not have a choice in their jobs. They<br/>
have gone to school for a certain reason and therefore they must not waste their<br/>
education. They have been taught that work is the only thing that shows success.<br/>
Identity is wrapped up in work and profession, which is reflected in your house,<br/>
car, tv, and even your therapist:) Schooling has closed people&#39;s minds to options<br/>
and choice. Grace L. demonstrates it so well in her Teenage Liberation Handbook!<br/>

I agree.  In our case, we&#39;re fortunate enough that I&#39;ll be able to work at <br/>
home or I could quit altogether and we could still make it.  But I know I&#39;m <br/>
lucky.  Also, I feel the need to point out that some people actually enjoy <br/>
their careers.  There are women who are doctors, lawyers, professors, <br/>
artists, etc. who do make a lot of money and whose &quot;extra&quot; income is not <br/>
needed for the household, but who worked hard to establish their careers and <br/>
are very fulfilled by them.  I&#39;m not saying that sacrifices shouldn&#39;t be made <br/>
when one becomes a parent, but I think to lump all working mothers into the <br/>
same &quot;they&#39;re working to own three tvs and two DVD players&quot; basket is unfair. <br/>
 I&#39;m not particularly wild about my job so it&#39;s not a big sacrifice for me to <br/>
give it up.  But if I were directing movies it would be a different story.  <br/>

<br/>
Yes!  This is largely what I&#39;ve been trying to say.  I think choice is key <br/>
(again, that&#39;s one reason I like unschooling).   That&#39;s also why I reject the <br/>
idea of men&#39;s and women&#39;s &quot;roles&quot; in family or society.  Assigning positions <br/>
like this limits or eliminates choice.  I had been thinking about reading <br/>
this book but figured I&#39;d wait because I didn&#39;t think it would apply to me <br/>
yet.  However, it looks like it could be quite inspiring.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202288373">I do find it fascinating! I teach human development, child development, early<br/>
childhood education, school-age care, etc. at the community college level:) It is<br/>
fascinating. I&#39;ve taught at every level possible from infant through adulthood so<br/>
I have a lot of experience (which is probably why I&#39;m unschooling:). I like the<br/>
freedom I&#39;m afforded at the community college level. I assess the students the<br/>
way I want to, which means no in class tests, multiple choice type things. I try<br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; in a way that the students are not actually &quot;learning&quot; from me, they<br/>
are just using new vocabulary words to describe their experiences. My whole point<br/>
in teaching is to help students to become aware of the theories they have already<br/>
developed about how children grow and learn. I love to read my students reactions<br/>
and hear their empowering experiences. With every class I learn so much about my<br/>
own beliefs and theories. The more I learn about unschooling, too, the more I<br/>
&#39;let go&#39; in the classroom and let the students lead discussions and teach the<br/>
class. I&#39;m rejuvenated every time I step into the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking, I love to talk about my teaching experiences and how I&#39;m<br/>
changing every day as a teacher and as a learner:)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

&gt; What do you teach, btw?  Just wondering! :)  Sounds like you find it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t that lame?  As if one needn&#39;t bother with an education if they will<br/>
&quot;ONLY&quot; be raising children!  Then why do teachers need a college degree? <br/>
Another case of twisted logic, methinks.<br/>
Besides, many degrees serve only to create elitist fields of employment. <br/>
There was very little I learned in college that I couldn&#39;t have learned<br/>
without a teacher.  And those few things could have been learned with a<br/>
mentor, or as an apprentice.  I&#39;m the only one of my siblings with a<br/>
college degree -- when I had a full-time job I earned much LESS than they<br/>
did!<br/>

<br/>
We need more &quot;teaching&quot; like that in the system.  Keep it up!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097004440">&lt;&lt;He often doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; until he experiences consequences that are<br/>
painful to him&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do think it is often personality.  My son also must experience<br/>
consequences to learn very often.  Example:  We have been bothered lately by<br/>
Zach&#39;s procrastination in getting ready to go places, all places including<br/>
places he really enjoys.  Even with fair warning that we are going some<br/>
place later in the day and later that we are leaving in so many minutes, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t even attempt to find his shoes, go to the bathroom or whatever until<br/>
everyone else is getting in the van. Then the entire family is supposed to<br/>
wait for him to change clothes, etc.. We have waited on him many, many times<br/>
and the family is tired of it.  We talked about it.  He agrees it is a<br/>
problem and I said I would continue to let him know the plan and a warning<br/>
of when we are to be leaving but I will no longer cause the rest of us to be<br/>
late because he dawdles.  He agreed......but then just this morning I had to<br/>
drive off and leave him.  He was furious for about 10 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
This is an ongoing thing with Zach.  He is very experiential and just<br/>
talking about possible consequences, how he would feel if such and such<br/>
happens, etc., doesn&#39;t do it for him.  I try as much as possible to make<br/>
sure that the consequences are natural.  If he has to learn the hard way, I<br/>
don&#39;t want to be the bad guy all the time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After all your efforts to talk about consequences, and the entire <br/>
family&#39;s patience in waiting for him over and over, I think your choice <br/>
to drive away was well overdue!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you continue to do this so the entire family doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
suffer one person&#39;s consequences.<br/>
<br/>
There are no bad guys in this situation. Just a family trying to make <br/>
things work so everyone can get on with their life. So taking that label <br/>
upon yourself is your choice.<br/>
<br/>
I have a nephew who is the same way. My sister resorted to bribery (PS2) <br/>
and that only worked for a week. Extrinsic rewards are not my idea of <br/>
learning. So when I spent a considerable amount of time staying at their <br/>
house, we went on with family matters. Of course it wasn&#39;t done with <br/>
malice or coldness, or without patience after a few discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Now he either gets it together or he gets left behind and he waits until <br/>
someone is home to drive him where he needs to be. He knows its his own <br/>
doing and he accepts it.<br/>
<br/>
In our house we have a law about infringing on other people&#39;s rights to <br/>
have their freedom. Its the only way everyone can enjoy freedoms from <br/>
control and agendas.<br/>
