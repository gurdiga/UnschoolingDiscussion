<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076755896">I was off reading speculation about the next Harry Potter book, and on a <br/>
discussion board I found something in passing that I think I&#39;ll add to my book <br/>
worship collection.   It&#39;s   not a gem, but it&#39;s a fairly good rock. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-When Dumbledore mentions him to hagrid, he implies that Aberforth might <br/>
not be able to read which means its likely that Aberforth, while his intentions <br/>
are good, might not have inherited Dumbledore&#39;s wisdom.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Equating the ability to read with wisdom seems a jump.   <br/>
Thing is, this isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve heard this. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And on a slightly-related (in that both involve teens, I suppose) thing, on <br/>
Neopets, intelligence comes from reading books, not being great at the math <br/>
puzzles. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My book worship collection is starting here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/bookworship">http://sandradodd.com/bookworship</a><br/>
<br/>
and the artistic rendering of that is this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/bookmotif.html">http://www.sandradodd.com/bookmotif.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I like that motif, but still I think it can send a bad message in the context <br/>
of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you have additions for those pages, I&#39;d love to have them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-995349686">I think society in general views intelligence this way. Schools have<br/>
created an environment where reading-related ability is valued above<br/>
all else. I&#39;m glad that Howard Gardener has brought the idea of<br/>
multiple intelligences to the forefront. Unfortunately, educators<br/>
don&#39;t really get it. Fortunately, we parents do.<br/>
