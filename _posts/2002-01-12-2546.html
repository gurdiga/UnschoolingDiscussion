Marmite is another favorite in our house (except husband whose American and<br/>

putting Heinz baked beans in Chili has worked out very well (LOL)...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781738343">I just saw crumpets (8 for $1.39) and lemon curd (10.5 oz for $2.39) at Trader Joes today. Had to think of you all.<br/>
I LOVE Trader Joes. ;-)<br/>
