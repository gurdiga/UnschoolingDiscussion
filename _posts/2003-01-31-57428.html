***Occasionally (like this week, most recently!) I feel really<br/>
uncomfortable <br/>
with the speed at which people are introduced to the most radical vision<br/>
of <br/>
living respectfully with their children--***<br/>
<br/>
Yes.   It must be like going from darkness to light in an instant and<br/>
you&#39;re left stunned and blinking there in the glare until you can adjust<br/>
your vision. <br/>
<br/>
What I am so uncomfortable with is the starting places are all different.<br/>
  I sort of tend to assume everyone is starting at the same place and<br/>
they&#39;re not. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a smart person.  I&#39;m just average in everything, but I *get*<br/>
unschooling.  I *get* living respectfully with children and if I can get<br/>
it it seems anyone can.    I don&#39;t have the unfailing patience Joyce has<br/>
nor the steadfast  dedication to helping others that Sandra has.    I&#39;m<br/>
ashamed that I get frustrated sometimes with new people, because I really<br/>
DO respect people who are trying to get this.  I really DO admire people<br/>
who are trying to make life better for their kids.   Maybe I&#39;m just not<br/>
good at helping someone else get there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why respecting children isn&#39;t simply the natural<br/>
starting point for mothers.   I know about religious teaching that say<br/>
children are born with sin and I know about the long history of parenting<br/>
practices and I know what society says about children.   I just don&#39;t<br/>
know why all of that isn&#39;t simply washed away the instant a new mother<br/>
holds that new baby.   THAT&#39;s what I don&#39;t get.   And if this seems harsh<br/>
or snarky please believe I don&#39;t mean it that way.    I&#39;m passionate<br/>
about unschooling.  I believe it can change the world.  I want everyone<br/>
to get there.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe because pregnancies before Dylan didn&#39;t culminate with a warm,<br/>
sweet baby in my arms, or maybe because I was afraid of loosing him or<br/>
maybe because I knew he was the only child I would have I  cherished him<br/>
from the start.    I didn&#39;t think for a minute that my job as a parent<br/>
was to make him obey or to teach him respect.   So, like Sandra we<br/>
started from a place of really noticing he was a capable person, right<br/>
from the start.   This is hard, because I seem to get the impression<br/>
often that other parents think their kids are a project.  Something they<br/>
have to build and perfect and finish.   The starting place is different.<br/>
<br/>
I want my son to be happy and fulfilled.   I live with him the way I<br/>
would live with a loved and respected friend or partner and I talk to him<br/>
the way I hope others have the kindness to talk to me.   I don&#39;t assume<br/>
his desires are less than mine because he&#39;s small I don&#39;t assume his<br/>
needs are not as important as mine or his problems are not as troubling<br/>
as mine because he&#39;s a child.    I knew he&#39;d need help getting where he<br/>
wanted to go, literally and figuratively.   I knew he&#39;d need protection<br/>
from harm until he could identify things that could hurt him and until he<br/>
could protect himself.   I didn&#39;t have him because I wanted help with<br/>
housework, and I didn&#39;t assume I was a better judge of what kind of<br/>
person he should.<br/>
<br/>
If any newbies have read this far, you can see you are not the only ones<br/>
who feel like you&#39;re wandering in a strange land.  Because when I hear<br/>
moms complain their kids won&#39;t do anything around the house or just want<br/>
to watch TV or are lazy or mean or uncooperative I feel like I&#39;m talking<br/>
to someone from another planet.    I get super annoyed with folks who<br/>
insult Sandra, because she devotes so much time to helping others<br/>
understand.   Every minute she&#39;s here answering questions and clarifying<br/>
ideas and giving examples is time spent away from her family and she&#39;s<br/>
not soliciting funds from anyone.   She has the determination to help<br/>
others get it that very few people have.   She&#39;s gone on and on helping<br/>
despite having answered questions a million times and despite being<br/>
abused and insulted.   She&#39;s a hero, in my opinion and if any new person<br/>
thinks getting unschooling is a difficult task helping people get it is<br/>
infinitely more difficult.    She made a choice to help others and she<br/>
makes it over and over again.   But people who come to learn about<br/>
unschooling have made a choice too.  No one is helpless here, if new<br/>
people need more help or clarification then it&#39;s their responsibility to<br/>
say so.   New people don&#39;t have the right to blame anyone here if they<br/>
don&#39;t understand.  It&#39;s up to the seeker to find understanding.   No one<br/>
here is putting barriers in the way.<br/>
<br/>
For new people, try treating your children they way you would like to be<br/>
treated.   If you spilled milk on the floor, would you want someone<br/>
yelling at you about it, telling you to be more careful?   Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
nicer to have someone say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, let me help you.&quot; ?    <br/>
What is so difficult about treating children with respect?   <br/>
<br/>
Really, newbies are not the only ones dealing with frustrations here.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that that&#39;s a very good point.  I don&#39;t know Sandra, or <br/>
anyone on the list personally at all.  I am a homebody for the most <br/>
part and don&#39;t go out to conferences to meet other unschoolers or <br/>
anything like that.  I have been reading from this list for awhile, <br/>
and have interjected a few comments here and there, but I am <br/>
basically new to this list.  I joined it to get ideas really, and I <br/>
have gotten a lot of good ideas just by reading.  I don&#39;t agree with <br/>
every single thing every single person says, but I can take what I <br/>
need and don&#39;t really feel the need to argue.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say in response to the above, that I think that <br/>
people don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; that people who are already happily going about <br/>
their business of unschooling, and it is working for them, don&#39;t <br/>
really need to discuss back and forth that much -- that they are <br/>
probably just putting in extra time to try to shed some light on the <br/>
topic for people who are just trying all this out.  It&#39;s like if you <br/>
are good at something, you can tell other people what you are up to <br/>
and maybe they can learn something from you.  So, in some ways, it&#39;s <br/>
a service they have been generous enough to offer to people who are <br/>
looking for information and ideas.  I don&#39;t think people look at it <br/>
that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think it&#39;s very generous of people to offer what they <br/>
have.  I appreciate it.<br/>

Awesome post. The whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so sad sometimes that I left the track I started on when I <br/>
had a new baby and was in love. I have tried really hard to live a <br/>
life that respects children&#39;s emotional needs on par with their <br/>
physical ones.<br/>
<br/>
And I believe we&#39;ve been more successful at it than some. But <br/>
we&#39;ve also bee inundated with Christian parenting strategies <br/>
and homeschooling talks. I find myself ambivalent at times abut <br/>
what to expect and why.<br/>
<br/>
This radical unschooling philosophy has taken all my thoughts <br/>
to an entirely new level and I feel FREE! I told my dh today: the <br/>
old sense of being the home regulator and rule enforcer is gone. <br/>
Life feels so much easier! And everyone&#39;s so much nicer to each <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
And just to empathize more, we are discussing some of these <br/>
ideas on my website www.trapdoorsociety.com and I am feeling <br/>
the kinds of frustrations you must feel. Women get pretty feisty <br/>
about protecting their rights to make children obey. Geesh. I&#39;m <br/>
trying to offer some of the principles to them since we&#39;ve had <br/>
heart-rending discussions about raising teens. Not working. The <br/>
fear of giving up parental authority is huge!<br/>
<br/>
It occured to me: when do these mothers ever stop regulating <br/>
everything their kids think and do? There are a hundred <br/>
justifications for requiring... everything from how to eat and <br/>
where, to when to pick up clothes and how to fold them in <br/>
drawers.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder we go bonkers in college!<br/>
<br/>
I feel I&#39;ve had a huge Aha here and am grateful for the patience of <br/>
those of you who are trying to offer your insights when it feels like <br/>
old hat to you and we sound insane! :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and my kids thank you profusely too. :)<br/>

&lt;&lt; This radical unschooling philosophy has taken all my thoughts <br/>
to an entirely new level and I feel FREE! I told my dh today: the <br/>
old sense of being the home regulator and rule enforcer is gone. <br/>
Life feels so much easier! And everyone&#39;s so much nicer to each <br/>
other.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It IS easy, when it comes to work.  It seems easy to me, anyway.  <br/>
I liked your account.<br/>
<br/>
When I tell people how easy and sweet it is with my kids sometimes, they look <br/>
entirely aghast or suspicious or disgusted.  Partly they don&#39;t want to <br/>
believe me.  Partly, if it IS easy then they&#39;re wasting their own time and <br/>
wasting their relationship with their children on something unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
Something like that was said to me on the New Mexico homeschooling list last <br/>
week, but a  mom who didn&#39;t want me bragging up unschooling as though it were <br/>
the only option.  (I hadn&#39;t been.)  The quote is:  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;it has been bothering me for a long <br/>
time, ever since I first joined here asking questions about how to <br/>
get started. I recall feeling more confused then anything else at <br/>
times, and sometimes felt *jumped on* for things I felt I needed to <br/>
do that others felt was.. well.. unnecessary, etc...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So do I &quot;feel&quot; that teaching a child to read is unnecessary?  Or do I *KNOW* <br/>
it to unnecessary?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t argue that point there.  It&#39;s not an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
Do I feel that spanking is unnecessary?  Yes.  And not only unnecessary, but <br/>
harmful.<br/>
<br/>
But if my children&#39;s lives are fun and sweet and they go to bed smiling, <br/>
people whose children&#39;s lives are not fun, and not sweet, who go to bed sad <br/>
and frustrated, are likely to be angry with me from the get go.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this will work with every one.  I don&#39;t think every parent is <br/>
capable of doing it.  Does that mean that out of &quot;fairness&quot; none of us <br/>
should?  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a serious question, not just rhetorical.  Are we being elitist on <br/>
beyond posh private schools to give our kids freedom and peace at home?<br/>

&gt; ***Occasionally (like this week, most recently!) I feel really<br/>
&gt; uncomfortable<br/>
&gt; with the speed at which people are introduced to the most radical vision<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; living respectfully with their children--***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes.   It must be like going from darkness to light in an instant and<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re left stunned and blinking there in the glare until you can adjust<br/>
&gt; your vision.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What I am so uncomfortable with is the starting places are all different.<br/>
&gt;   I sort of tend to assume everyone is starting at the same place and<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not a smart person.  I&#39;m just average in everything, but I *get*<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  I *get* living respectfully with children and if I can get<br/>
&gt; it it seems anyone can.    I don&#39;t have the unfailing patience Joyce has<br/>
&gt; nor the steadfast  dedication to helping others that Sandra has.    I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; ashamed that I get frustrated sometimes with new people, because I really<br/>
&gt; DO respect people who are trying to get this.  I really DO admire people<br/>
&gt; who are trying to make life better for their kids.   Maybe I&#39;m just not<br/>
&gt; good at helping someone else get there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t understand why respecting children isn&#39;t simply the natural<br/>
&gt; starting point for mothers.   I know about religious teaching that say<br/>
&gt; children are born with sin and I know about the long history of parenting<br/>
&gt; practices and I know what society says about children.   I just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know why all of that isn&#39;t simply washed away the instant a new mother<br/>
&gt; holds that new baby.   THAT&#39;s what I don&#39;t get.   And if this seems harsh<br/>
&gt; or snarky please believe I don&#39;t mean it that way.    I&#39;m passionate<br/>
&gt; about unschooling.  I believe it can change the world.  I want everyone<br/>
&gt; to get there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe because pregnancies before Dylan didn&#39;t culminate with a warm,<br/>
&gt; sweet baby in my arms, or maybe because I was afraid of loosing him or<br/>
&gt; maybe because I knew he was the only child I would have I  cherished him<br/>
&gt; from the start.    I didn&#39;t think for a minute that my job as a parent<br/>
&gt; was to make him obey or to teach him respect.   So, like Sandra we<br/>
&gt; started from a place of really noticing he was a capable person, right<br/>
&gt; from the start.   This is hard, because I seem to get the impression<br/>
&gt; often that other parents think their kids are a project.  Something they<br/>
&gt; have to build and perfect and finish.   The starting place is different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I want my son to be happy and fulfilled.   I live with him the way I<br/>
&gt; would live with a loved and respected friend or partner and I talk to him<br/>
&gt; the way I hope others have the kindness to talk to me.   I don&#39;t assume<br/>
&gt; his desires are less than mine because he&#39;s small I don&#39;t assume his<br/>
&gt; needs are not as important as mine or his problems are not as troubling<br/>
&gt; as mine because he&#39;s a child.    I knew he&#39;d need help getting where he<br/>
&gt; wanted to go, literally and figuratively.   I knew he&#39;d need protection<br/>
&gt; from harm until he could identify things that could hurt him and until he<br/>
&gt; could protect himself.   I didn&#39;t have him because I wanted help with<br/>
&gt; housework, and I didn&#39;t assume I was a better judge of what kind of<br/>
&gt; person he should.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If any newbies have read this far, you can see you are not the only ones<br/>
&gt; who feel like you&#39;re wandering in a strange land.  Because when I hear<br/>
&gt; moms complain their kids won&#39;t do anything around the house or just want<br/>
&gt; to watch TV or are lazy or mean or uncooperative I feel like I&#39;m talking<br/>
&gt; to someone from another planet.    I get super annoyed with folks who<br/>
&gt; insult Sandra, because she devotes so much time to helping others<br/>
&gt; understand.   Every minute she&#39;s here answering questions and clarifying<br/>
&gt; ideas and giving examples is time spent away from her family and she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not soliciting funds from anyone.   She has the determination to help<br/>
&gt; others get it that very few people have.   She&#39;s gone on and on helping<br/>
&gt; despite having answered questions a million times and despite being<br/>
&gt; abused and insulted.   She&#39;s a hero, in my opinion and if any new person<br/>
&gt; thinks getting unschooling is a difficult task helping people get it is<br/>
&gt; infinitely more difficult.    She made a choice to help others and she<br/>
&gt; makes it over and over again.   But people who come to learn about<br/>
&gt; unschooling have made a choice too.  No one is helpless here, if new<br/>
&gt; people need more help or clarification then it&#39;s their responsibility to<br/>
&gt; say so.   New people don&#39;t have the right to blame anyone here if they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t understand.  It&#39;s up to the seeker to find understanding.   No one<br/>
&gt; here is putting barriers in the way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For new people, try treating your children they way you would like to be<br/>
&gt; treated.   If you spilled milk on the floor, would you want someone<br/>
&gt; yelling at you about it, telling you to be more careful?   Wouldn&#39;t it be<br/>
&gt; nicer to have someone say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, let me help you.&quot; ?<br/>
&gt; What is so difficult about treating children with respect?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Really, newbies are not the only ones dealing with frustrations here.<br/>

as child I wasnt respected. I am struggling with this. Lately i find the<br/>
more time i spend doing things with them getting right involved with what<br/>
there doing. The more I respect them at treat them as equals. It should come<br/>
natural and if we raise our chilren with respect they will pass it on to<br/>
their children. I fine the more I respect my daughter the more she respects<br/>
me. They learn by the example we set. </span></blockquote></div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh this is so true!!! (It was me who used the yard work/.husband <br/>
example, btw). Last night my husband and I tried to figure out if <br/>
ther is anything we feel we can say to our kids about their <br/>
choices and how they spend their time.<br/>
<br/>
I realized that in the old paradigm, parents are constantly <br/>
justifying their decisions this way:<br/>
<br/>
I want her to learn to value her clothes so I won&#39;t let her leave <br/>
them in a heap on the floor. If she doesn&#39;t pick them up, then... <br/>
Fill in the blank<br/>
<br/>
Or<br/>
<br/>
If I can&#39;t trust my kids to obey in the little things, how will I be able <br/>
to trus tthem in the big ones like driving a car?<br/>
<br/>
But the expectations and regulations keep piling up on each <br/>
other. And by the time these kids are teens (when almost all <br/>
these parents said their kids would have *more* freedom, not <br/>
less), they feel paralyzed to actually give them that freedom.<br/>
<br/>
it occured to me last night that it&#39;s because they haven&#39;t got <br/>
evidence for themselves that their kids *can* function reliably, <br/>
with good sense and integrity for them *without* parental <br/>
intervention, coercion or supervision.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s often treating<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids as though they have adult needs and understandings as <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a way of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; instilling those adult needs and understandings.<br/>

As to treating our children better than we were treated, it can be really <br/>
healing.<br/>
<br/>
If you see it as healing your own inner child (much was written of that <br/>
fifteen years ago, and you can probably find it on the internet, under <br/>
recovery from dysfunction or similar topics, using www.google.com) it might <br/>
be easier.   It changed my life profoundly when I was involved in Adult <br/>
Children of Alcoholics meetings during the pregnancies and births of my first <br/>
two children.<br/>
<br/>
When I made a decision about what to do with Kirby I thought &quot;What do I wish <br/>
my mom had done?&quot;  And as I did that thing--whether pick him up, or talk <br/>
nicely to him, or swing him longer than I had planned to, or play with him on <br/>
the floor, whatever it was--I thought of how much nicer it would have been <br/>
for me, and how much nicer for my mom and our relationship if she had found <br/>
some way to be more patient with me, and more generous with energy and <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
So while I was becoming the mom I wished I had had, Kirby was getting a <br/>
better mom than  he would have had otherwise.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323226250">Hi Julie! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And I believe we&#39;ve been more successful at it than some. But <br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve also bee inundated with Christian parenting strategies <br/>
&gt; and homeschooling talks. I find myself ambivalent at times abut <br/>
&gt; what to expect and why.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, I&#39;ve been wracking my brains and looking into the Bible, and <br/>
comparing what I&#39;ve read here, with things I&#39;ve read elsewhere. &quot;Is <br/>
this unschooling thing Biblical?&quot; I asked myself. The Bible has a lot <br/>
to say about training children, and the rod, and fatherly oversight <br/>
of their children. <br/>
I&#39;ve read Michael and Debi Pearl&#39;s writings, and agree with some, and <br/>
disagree with some. In fact, would you be surprised, you unschoolers, <br/>
to read Michael Pearl&#39;s advice about math and kids? He says &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
make them sit down and do math problems. Bring them into contact with <br/>
math in their lives, and they&#39;ll pick up what they need to know about <br/>
math.&quot; That&#39;s a paraphrase, but it&#39;s a paraphrase of Michael Pearl. <br/>
When I read, here on this board, about kids picking up math via <br/>
living, I am reminded of Pearls, more than any other author I&#39;ve read.<br/>
<br/>
Before you jump my case, let me say, much of the Pearls&#39; advice about <br/>
the rod is one area where I do differ with them. I don&#39;t want to talk <br/>
about spanking.<br/>
<br/>
As I have researched and thought about it, yes training is something <br/>
mentioned in the Bible. Parental training of children. But you know <br/>
what it says &quot;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he <br/>
is old, he will not depart from it.&quot; Well, how many kids, <br/>
rigidly &quot;trained&quot; in &quot;Christianity&quot; have grown up to be solid <br/>
Christians? Um, I know more who have abandoned the faith, than have <br/>
stayed with the faith. What if there&#39;s a big-time misuse of <br/>
these &quot;training&quot; passages? What if &quot;in the way in which he should go&quot; <br/>
has to do with knowing your kids well enough to see which direction <br/>
they are heading, and then guiding them in that way? And in a <br/>
Christian life, letting God saturate that way? What if Christian <br/>
parents developed and maintained fellowship with their kids (another <br/>
Pearlism) and lived with them together in joy, rather than making <br/>
them always tow the line without a deviation? and the ensuing <br/>
frustration and anger at the kids when they DIDN&#39;T tow the line!<br/>
<br/>
I know that much of evangelicalism is more rigid, but my opinion is <br/>
that much of evangelicalism is NOT Biblical living. There&#39;s a lot of <br/>
stuff out there, coming from Christian leadership, which isn&#39;t <br/>
Biblical parenting. Believe it or not, the writings of some <br/>
conservative Christian leaders are closer to unschooling than to the <br/>
current trends, and I&#39;ve read them. Closer to this &quot;in the way in <br/>
which they should go,&quot; this, &quot;know them and see where their talents <br/>
and interests lie, and let them go in that direction.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This radical unschooling philosophy has taken all my thoughts <br/>
&gt; to an entirely new level and I feel FREE! I told my dh today: the <br/>
&gt; old sense of being the home regulator and rule enforcer is gone. <br/>
&gt; Life feels so much easier! And everyone&#39;s so much nicer to each <br/>
&gt; other.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am just exactly at this point, too, Julie. And my husband, who has <br/>
an innate rigidity, who had a hard time accepting that you can put <br/>
Ranch salad dressing on potatoes and broccoli...I&#39;ve been watching <br/>
him just open up with the kids MAJORLY these past couple of weeks. <br/>
Mr. &quot;No Computer Today At All, You&#39;ve Had Enough&quot; actually stayed up <br/>
last night playing computer games with Robby until the wee hours of <br/>
the morning. And just day before yesterday, when someone (Julie B?) <br/>
mentioned her hubby and son playing computer all night, I gave a <br/>
little *snork* and said &quot;That&#39;s not going to happen around here&quot; L my <br/>
non-playful husband, playing. wow.<br/>
<br/>
Everything about our home feels easier and more joyful. Where <br/>
frustration over &quot;those disobedient, mischievous kids&quot; was, there is <br/>
now playfulness, as we parents join them in THEIR games and THEIR <br/>
explorations. It&#39;s very cool. I&#39;m liking it a LOT.<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi</div>

&lt;&lt; What if there&#39;s a big-time misuse of <br/>
these &quot;training&quot; passages? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have trained morning glories and pea plants to grow up on a fence.<br/>
Hitting them doesn&#39;t help. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Only gently putting the end of the vine near something it can wrap itself <br/>
around helps.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if &quot;in the way in which he should go&quot; <br/>
has to do with knowing your kids well enough to see which direction <br/>
they are heading, and then guiding them in that way? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kinda like that.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;This almost made me cry! I guess it is hard to respect your children when<br/>

&gt; as child I wasnt respected. I am struggling with this. Lately i find the<br/>
&gt; more time i spend doing things with them getting right involved with what<br/>
&gt; there doing. The more I respect them at treat them as equals. It should come<br/>
&gt; natural and if we raise our chilren with respect they will pass it on to<br/>
&gt; their children. I fine the more I respect my daughter the more she respects<br/>
&gt; me. They learn by the example we set.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for writing this, it is so true. It sure is hard to find the <br/>
strength to give our children the respect that we weren&#39;t given as <br/>
children.  And it is even harder, as a parent, to admit we might not <br/>
have given our own children the respect they needed and that their <br/>
actions might have something to do with that lack of respect.<br/>
<br/>
It is much easier to blame someone else, anything else, even a email <br/>
list and play all kinds of games to distract oneself from that reality. <br/>
It is however, a colossal waste of one&#39;s own time and everyone else <br/>
reading that denial. So, to those that would blame unschooling rather <br/>
than take responsibility for their own actions, why? No one here said <br/>
this is the easy way to go. There are places all over the net to hang <br/>
out where the parent&#39;s feelings are ALWAYS protected and no one would <br/>
even suggest that a parent had any responsibility for a lack of <br/>
sensitivity or echoing respect in their children. Why not hang out in an <br/>
easy place like that instead of endlessly bitching and moaning about <br/>
this place and sucking up *any* attention and never mind that it&#39;s <br/>
negative. Wait, I answered my own question. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Peggy, feeling cranky this morning.</div>

&lt;&lt; Occasionally (like this week, most recently!) I feel really<br/>
uncomfortable with the speed at which people are introduced to the most <br/>
radical vision<br/>
of living respectfully with their children--***<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t get this statement.  Are there different visions of living <br/>
respectfully with  children?  I believe it is either living respectfully or <br/>
not.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just about to catch up with the e-mail I was so behind on.  Sorry to be <br/>
late.  This one was directly to me, and although I think Joyce or others have <br/>
answered (I was reading in swirly-fashion, some new and some old every day), <br/>
here&#39;s my own attempt to defend my statement.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t get this statement.  Are there different visions of living <br/>
respectfully with  children? -=-<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to tell me she spanked me because she loved me.<br/>
<br/>
If someone &quot;respects a child&#39;s privacy&quot; to the point of not noticing they <br/>
have ants in their bedroom and socks behind the toilet which COULD be washed, <br/>
is that respect, really?<br/>
<br/>
Words ALWAYS have multiple shadings and meanings.  And when philosophy and <br/>
behavior become factors, a word which is about an attitude and a mindset is <br/>
absolutely going to be about as broad as the world.<br/>
<br/>
Does &quot;respect for the environment&quot; mean never stepping on grass? Or never <br/>
building a sidewalk to avoid stepping on grass?   <br/>
<br/>
Often when someone says &quot;I respect your opinion,&quot; they really mean &quot;I <br/>
acknowledge that you have the right to an opinion and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re brave <br/>
enough to have expressed your opinion.&quot;  That&#39;s long to say and involves a <br/>
lot of thought, though, so they say &quot;I respect your opinion,&quot; even when they <br/>
think the opinion is proof of idiocy and dumb-assedness.<br/>
<br/>
If someone who believes unsaved souls will burn unquenched for eternity says <br/>
&quot;I respect my child&#39;s choices&quot; it will mean something entirely different, and <br/>
COMPLETELY different, than if the same words are thought, uttered or written <br/>
by someone who is an atheist or who believes in reincarnation.  If I believed <br/>
in hell and though Jesus was coming back &#39;might be today,&#39;  my &quot;respect&quot; for <br/>
my child could not include being lax about reminding him to accept Jesus as <br/>
his Savior.  It would be the utmost in neglectful DISrespect for me to say <br/>
&quot;Yeah, whatever about you.  *I*&#39;m going to heaven.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So with unschooling, there is this starting place about natural learning.  <br/>
And with that starting place, that people can learn from whatever interests <br/>
them, in ways that are interesting and workable for them, then we begin to <br/>
see that we  need to respect our children&#39;s interests and styles of learning <br/>
and being.<br/>
<br/>
From that little grain of a start, understanding that one loves Lego and <br/>
silence while another loves books and soft cushions and the third loves loud <br/>
music and roller blades, we wonder maybe whether it&#39;s okay if one doesn&#39;t <br/>
like vegetarian food, or one wants to feng-shui-ify the rec room.  And from <br/>
there it  just all unravels into a whole new world of respect for each child <br/>
as the full human he has always been, instead of the kid we sometimes imagine <br/>
we built and own.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy to describe or discuss.  If it were easy, we&#39;d have nothing <br/>
much to discuss here.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants more attempt at explanation, say so.  Ask other questions.  <br/>
Or just let it soak in a year.   It&#39;s okay if you think &quot;I respect your <br/>
opinion&quot; even if you think more deeply &quot;What idiocy and dumb-assedness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
