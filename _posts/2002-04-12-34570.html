<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683290569">Gotta share what Jody did yesterday. She and I were headed to town <br/>
yesterday morning, which means first winding down a dirt road about <br/>
half a mile to the state highway below the little mountain valley we <br/>
live in. When we got down to the highway there was a helicopter, a <br/>
horse trailer, and several other vehicles sitting in a field just off <br/>
the road, and we both wondered what was up, helicopters being pretty <br/>
rare in these parts. So we went over and asked them; turned out they <br/>
were wildlife biologists setting up to check out the local mule deer <br/>
population. Jody asked if they&#39;d mind if she hung out with them, they <br/>
said no problem, so she hopped out of the truck and I went on to town.<br/>
<br/>
She spent the day helping the biologists track, shoot (with sedative <br/>
darts), haul (in the helicopter sling), and examine the deer. She <br/>
said they&#39;d locate deer already wearing radio collars with a radio <br/>
tracking device on the front of the helicopter. The marksman would <br/>
lean out and shoot the deer, then they&#39;d land and put it into a sling <br/>
and haul it back to their base camp. There they&#39;d do a sonogram for <br/>
pregnancy, an overall health check, pull a tooth (she said they&#39;re <br/>
like rings on a tree and will tell the biologists a lot about the <br/>
deer&#39;s overall health), give it shots of some kind and then help it <br/>
back to the herd.<br/>
<br/>
Jody got to ride in the helicopter (WAAAAAY COOL, she says), help <br/>
with the deer, ask all the questions she wanted and answered lots of <br/>
questions for the out-of-area biologists. She said they seemed as <br/>
happy to have her there as she was to be there! She said she learned <br/>
SO MUCH, not only about deer and how the biologists work with them, <br/>
but she found out they&#39;ve recently released 600 wild turkeys just up <br/>
the creek from us (!), they&#39;re *very* concerned about the cougar <br/>
problem in this area (our dogs tangled with cougars last year), and <br/>
the bighorn sheep population just north of us is making a comeback!<br/>
<br/>
Not your typical unschooler&#39;s day, but I thought one worth sharing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099742055">Maybe the fascinating helicopter ride and interaction with the bioligists was not the &quot;typical&quot; unschoolers day, but these opportunities are non-existent in public school.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine how the whole scene would have played out if it had been planned as a field trip for a class of twenty-seven students!<br/>
