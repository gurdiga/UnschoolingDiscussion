<div id="ygrps-yiv-529166024">Mary, did you realize you were writing poetry? Read it again! It IS poetry, like life is poetry, too, and to be fully enjoyed!!<br/>
<br/>
Bake something, make something, go somewhere, clean something, read something-anything, take a nap-dream,<br/>
Look up a word-something absurd, have a big bowl of ice-cream.<br/>
Life is for learning, living, doing. How far will your imagination go?<br/>
Be, see, climb a tree. <br/>
Beyond texts there is so much to know.<br/>
Life is an education, a journey where anything goes.<br/>
And the only limits that slow you down are the ones that are self imposed.<br/>

&gt;&gt;To anyone who uses daily journals, logs and portfolios to satisfy their<br/>
&gt;&gt;state&#39;s assessment requirement:  how much detail about daily or weekly<br/>
&gt;&gt;activities do you provide?  Do you just list some highlights or write<br/>
&gt;&gt;in-depth descriptions of activities?  How much material do you put in a<br/>
&gt;&gt;portfolio? Should I start collecting it throughout the year, or just gather<br/>
&gt;&gt;up things near the time when the assessment is due?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i save some special stuff i save. but check the law. ours only reqiers that<br/>
&gt;we show sustained progress. you dont need alot to do that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, my school dept. required me to agree to a &quot;minimum of 900 hours of<br/>
&gt;&gt;instruction.&quot;  How can I prove (or the school dept. disprove) that I met<br/>
&gt;&gt;this requirement through what I write in our log?  I know my son is<br/>
&gt;&gt;learning something every day, but my daily journal may not reflect this to<br/>
&gt;&gt;the satisfaction of the school superintendent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;check and see what they by law reqiere, in PA it is either 900 hours or 180<br/>
&gt;days. I do days. I just put a check mark next to each day. sometimes i<br/>
&gt;write some of what we do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;if you need to do hours well, here is what i would do<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;brush teeth--- health<br/>
&gt;eat-----nutritian<br/>
&gt;walk the dog--- gym<br/>
&gt;play a game with dice- math<br/>
&gt;etc<br/>

&gt;Jill, I think you and I are in the same boat! I feel okay about my kids <br/>
&gt;watching Nova (that&#39;s obviously educational) But what about Arthur??? They <br/>
&gt;sit for hours making things out of newspaper...okay I can see value in that. <br/>
&gt;But what about my daughter&#39;s tea parties with her dolls? I am so tainted by <br/>
&gt;my public school education that I don&#39;t know how much to put in their hands. <br/>
&gt;I can&#39;t wait to read the responses to your mail.<br/>

&gt;Hi Jill,<br/>
&gt;What did you do on Saturday? Sunday? etc? Unschooling is life. We are all<br/>
&gt;learning all the time.  What are their interests?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bake something, make something, go somewhere, clean something, read<br/>
&gt;something-anything, take a nap-dream,<br/>
&gt;Look up a word-something absurd, have a big bowl of ice-cream.<br/>
&gt;Life is for learning, living, doing. How far will your imagination go?<br/>
&gt;Be, see, climb a tree. Beyond texts there is so much to know.<br/>
&gt;Life is an education, a journey where anything goes.<br/>
&gt;And the only limits that slow you down are the ones that are self imposed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, the moment you stopped making them &#39;do&#39; school you were unschooling. If<br/>
&gt;they ask a question, answer it. If they want to know something help them<br/>
&gt;find out as much as they want your help. Include them in what you are doing<br/>
&gt;and let them include you in what they are doing.  And once in a while let<br/>
&gt;them sleep in!<br/>

&gt;Jill and Lori,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think one of the easiest ways to think about unschooling is to <br/>
&gt;think about continuing on the same path that you followed when they <br/>
&gt;were little toddlers.  You live your life with them.  You engage them <br/>
&gt;in things that interest you or that might interest them.  You cheer <br/>
&gt;when they&#39;re bored because out of that boredom may come a wonderful <br/>
&gt;idea for a new project.  One of the most helpful things we did when <br/>
&gt;we first started was to do anything but school-like stuff.  We took a <br/>
&gt;lot of field trips, nature walks, etc. - just celebrating the fact <br/>
&gt;that we were free.  We read aloud until my voice was shot and then <br/>
&gt;read some more.  We also watched tv and played video games - still <br/>
&gt;do.  In fact yesterday  my 13 year old spent lots of time with a <br/>
&gt;video game,  but to help him through it,  he drew a map to scale as <br/>
&gt;the game progressed.  We have learned so much from television shows <br/>
&gt;and games.  With unlimited tv and video games here,  my kids became <br/>
&gt;more selective on their own.  Enjoy your kids and your family and the <br/>
&gt;learning will come.  There will be many times that you won&#39;t be able <br/>
&gt;to figure out where they learned what they know because with an <br/>
&gt;unschooling lifestyle their brains seem so much more receptive to <br/>
&gt;little snippets of info that pass others by.  Have fun!<br/>

&gt;&quot;Educationese&quot; in<br/>
&gt;my search engine and it pulled up several.  This was from a  Ohio Teacher<br/>
&gt;resource<br/>
&gt;site. Try this <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ohea.org/home.htm">http://www.ohea.org/home.htm</a><br/>
&gt;Then,click on the Reasource Library button on the left side of the<br/>
&gt;page.then, use the<br/>
&gt;pull down menu on the page it takes you to.  Choose &quot;Lexicon of<br/>
&gt;Eucationese&quot; and click<br/>
&gt;go.  That takes you to the page.  Whew!  Shirley<br/>

&gt;Joel, as a public school teacher for 23 years, your description of Educationese as &quot;gobblelygook and bafflegab&quot; made me laugh out loud. When I am alone and laugh out loud, I KNOW it is funny! Not really funny in the long run, however! I taught in public schools, knowing full well that classroom education is a poor last resort for parents who just don&#39;t have time to teach their own children! I am excited now to be participating in the home education of my granddaughter. As a teacher, I participated in the search for the appropriate educational phrase for something simple. It is an ongoing thing, this search for the bafflegab that will satisfy the reader and keep him from asking more questions! I think it is done more for the purpose of making &quot;education&quot; sound &quot;professional&quot; than for any other reason. Some people really do not know what professional means!<br/>
&gt;Keep on keeping on! I really enjoy this list. Also, unless you write and tell me not to do it, I would like to post that short reference to g and b to my home list, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.heartofalabama.com">http://www.heartofalabama.com</a> We would all enjoy it.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Somebody should provide a service wherein you send the activities of daily living of your child and then they send you back a log with everything translated into educational gobblelygook and bafflegab.  I&#39;ve seen something like this in Growing Without Schools newsletter wherein someone did just that by which I<br/>
&gt;&gt;mean they wrote an article translating their kid&#39;s everyday play into  &gt;educational goals stated in that arcane blather educators use.  They eat it up.<br/>
&gt;&gt;And what&#39;s more it was all true.  Tossing a rock, doing somersaults, playing with Playmobile, all contain every aspect of &quot;Education&quot; and many that schools don&#39;t provide.<br/>

&gt;Jill,<br/>
&gt;Good luck.  The tv question is an issue for me.  My wanting them to do<br/>
&gt;what they want to do is certainly challenged by the lulling, siren call<br/>
&gt;of TV.  I would suggest you check out the Holt site:<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/index.htm">http://www.holtgws.com/index.htm</a> for information and support.  Also<br/>
&gt;check out naturalchild project (see below)  Read &quot;The Fear of Being<br/>
&gt;Permissive&quot; archived there.  If you have limits on your internet access<br/>
&gt;I could email you a copy of that article.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would imagine if you were doing the &quot;homeschool&quot; route with an<br/>
&gt;emphasis on the school part there will be a considerable period of<br/>
&gt;adjustment while you get up to speed on what unschooling really means<br/>
&gt;and for your kids to adjust to the idea that they really are trusted to<br/>
&gt;come to know themselves and their own interests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My six year old has just started to pick out words she recognizes.  Her<br/>
&gt;sister did this at three.  I really have 95% come to believe that it<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t make any difference when people get to the things they think are<br/>
&gt;important except that they be the one&#39;s to decide what those things are<br/>
&gt;and when they should learn them.<br/>

&gt;I just can&#39;t resist.....I detest Arthur.  Talking to my daughter (10) about it<br/>
&gt;she describes how stereotyped the roles of the boys and girls are.  Anyway<br/>
&gt;talking with my daughter reaffirms my tentative belief that self-determination<br/>
&gt;is more important than my anxiety over TV.  Which is not to say that I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have something to say about the TV going for hours at a time because I live here<br/>
&gt;too. It really is not a big problem for us only episodically.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Jill, I think you and I are in the same boat! I feel okay about my kids<br/>
&gt;&gt; watching Nova (that&#39;s obviously educational) But what about Arthur??? They<br/>
&gt;&gt; sit for hours making things out of newspaper...okay I can see value in that.<br/>
&gt;&gt; But what about my daughter&#39;s tea parties with her dolls? I am so tainted by<br/>
&gt;&gt; my public school education that I don&#39;t know how much to put in their hands.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t wait to read the responses to your mail.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Diane, would you mind sharing some titles that helped your kids?  My almost<br/>
&gt;&gt;13 yr. old really responds to gleaning info. from books, but so many of the<br/>

&gt;&gt; Hi Jill,<br/>
&gt;&gt; What did you do on Saturday? Sunday? etc? Unschooling is life. We are all<br/>
&gt;&gt; learning all the time.  What are their interests?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Bake something, make something, go somewhere, clean something, read<br/>
&gt;&gt; something-anything, take a nap-dream,<br/>
&gt;&gt; Look up a word-something absurd, have a big bowl of ice-cream.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Life is for learning, living, doing. How far will your imagination go?<br/>
&gt;&gt; Be, see, climb a tree. Beyond texts there is so much to know.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Life is an education, a journey where anything goes.<br/>
&gt;&gt; And the only limits that slow you down are the ones that are self imposed.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; So, the moment you stopped making them &#39;do&#39; school you were unschooling. If<br/>
&gt;&gt; they ask a question, answer it. If they want to know something help them<br/>
&gt;&gt; find out as much as they want your help. Include them in what you are doing<br/>
&gt;&gt; and let them include you in what they are doing.  And once in a while let<br/>

&gt;It&#39;s not so much what you do as what your kids do. Did they shower? are they<br/>
&gt;getting breakfast, watching tv, talking, breathing? Then you have begun:) Talk<br/>
&gt;with them, listen to them, enjoy the world around you. Have fun and remember<br/>
&gt;learning is involved in everything you do, whether or not you can *see* it. I&#39;d<br/>

&gt;Hi Olivia,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have been talking about this on our local e-mail loop as our school<br/>
&gt;district has also asked more from us than what is required by law.  Get a<br/>
&gt;copy of your state laws and find out what is required of you.  If it does<br/>
&gt;not state that you are required to have a certain amt. of days or hours<br/>
&gt;then you don&#39;t need to provide that info.  If you know that your school<br/>
&gt;board is very thorough on looking at your portfoilo and you feel that<br/>
&gt;they could give you extra problems by questioning everything that you do-<br/>
&gt;maybe you should comply OR recieve counsel from the HOMESCHOOL LEGAL<br/>
&gt;DEFENSE ASSOCIATION-  www.hslda.com.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here in Florida attendance is not required or a daily log needed , but<br/>
&gt;they ( here in Osceola Co.) wanted a daily log and hours recorded from<br/>
&gt;us.  I was able to find help through our state orginization called the<br/>
&gt;Florida Parent Educators Association.  <br/>

&gt;Subject: journals and portfolios<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Question...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To anyone who uses daily journals, logs and portfolios to satisfy their<br/>
&gt;state&#39;s assessment requirement:  how much detail about daily or weekly<br/>
&gt;activities do you provide?  Do you just list some highlights or write<br/>
&gt;in-depth descriptions of activities?  How much material do you put in a<br/>
&gt;portfolio? Should I start collecting it throughout the year, or just<br/>
&gt;gather<br/>
&gt;up things near the time when the assessment is due? <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, my school dept. required me to agree to a &quot;minimum of 900 hours of<br/>
&gt;instruction.&quot;  How can I prove (or the school dept. disprove) that I met<br/>
&gt;this requirement through what I write in our log?  I know my son is<br/>
&gt;learning something every day, but my daily journal may not reflect this<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;the satisfaction of the school superintendent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
&gt;Olivia<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dear Nancy --<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Glad to see you&#39;re out there!  After my new homeschooling book comes out<br/>
&gt;(in about a month), I&#39;m starting work on another on &quot;Teacher<br/>
&gt;Turncoats&quot;.  There will be information on it when my website goes up<br/>
&gt;(www.skylarksings.com) in about two weeks, but I thought I&#39;d send along<br/>
&gt;a snippet of description so if you know anyone...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And that&#39;s true for the whole list too!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;TEACHER TURNCOATS&quot;  I&#39;m putting together a book on schoolteachers<br/>
&gt;(mostly public school, but I&#39;ll accept material from all kinds) who have<br/>
&gt;chosen to homeschool their own kids.  Some of you may still have<br/>
&gt;continued in your teaching careers; others of you may have deserted.  I<br/>
&gt;want to know about your own teaching experiences, and what prompted you<br/>
&gt;to teach your child(ren) at home.  Was it a difficult decision for you?<br/>
&gt;If you continued schoolteaching, what kind of response did you get in<br/>
&gt;the school?  Were there things which you learned in your teacher<br/>
&gt;education that was helpful or harmful in providing a better learning<br/>
&gt;environment for your child?  Were there things the school could have<br/>
&gt;done differentily which would have convinced you to keep your child<br/>
&gt;there?  What does the decision look like in hindsight (and how are your<br/>
&gt;kids doing?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again, I&#39;d love to receive your recollections and your thoughts on the<br/>
&gt;subject.  As above no names will be used in the book, though it is<br/>
&gt;possible my publisher will end up preferring full interviews with a<br/>
&gt;small number of you, so I may contact you again via e-mail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Also, don&#39;t forget to check out the adult non-fiction section on a<br/>
&gt;&gt; regular basis for books for your kids.  As one library fiend to<br/>
&gt;&gt; another, I have realized that some books written for adults on<br/>
&gt;&gt; particular subjects appeal more to my children than the children&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; versions.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Thanks for the tip Carol!   <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Although, I do have to say that children&#39;s non-fiction<br/>
&gt;&gt; choices have improved dramatically over the past few years. My son<br/>
&gt;&gt; loves anything about woodworking and tools, so we find lots for him<br/>
&gt;&gt; in the adult section.  I also find that adult titles about wildlife,<br/>
&gt;&gt; art, crafts, cooking, etc. tend to interest my children more than<br/>
&gt;&gt; the children&#39;s books. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  yes, even out of our own bookshelves at home i&#39;ve been surprised by <br/>
&gt;what Sterling has pulled out and sat down with for quite some time - <br/>
&gt;the gardening books, home repair books (but then he loves to take <br/>
&gt;things apart!), etc.<br/>

<br/>
The moment ice-cream hit the screen I realized that I was waxing poetic. It<br/>
has been a while, just a bit rusty, but it was fun. I used to write all<br/>
sorts of sappy deep love poem stuff when I first got together with my<br/>
wonderful husband so many years ago (five now, but with 4 kids under 7 it<br/>
seems an eternity).  Thanks for noticing. &lt;smile&gt;<br/>

Thank you Allison, I am really glad that some folks have enjoyed my words.<br/>
Maybe this will motivate me to do a little more writing, something I have<br/>
largely put aside with 5 little ones running around.  I appreciate you<br/>
taking the time to let me know you like what I wrote.  Blessings<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Okay.  I&#39;m ready.  We homeschooled last year, pretty unsuccessfully, I&#39;d<br/>
say.<br/>
  I&#39;ve decided to go the &quot;unschooling&quot; route.  I&#39;m ready to start now.  What<br/>
do I do?????  Got up this morning and showered, etc.  Reading my e-mail now.<br/>
Kids are in my room watching TV.  How do I engage them?<br/>
<br/>

(and in response this is what I wrote, the poem is the middle paragraph, it<br/>
did not start out as poetry-MinID)<br/>
<br/>
Hi Jill,<br/>
What did you do on Saturday? Sunday? etc? Unschooling is life. We are all<br/>
learning all the time.  What are their interests?<br/>
<br/>
Bake something, make something, go somewhere, clean something, read<br/>
something-anything, take a nap-dream,<br/>
Look up a word-something absurd, have a big bowl of ice-cream.<br/>
Life is for learning, living, doing. How far will your imagination go?<br/>
Be, see, climb a tree. Beyond texts there is so much to know.<br/>
Life is an education, a journey where anything goes.<br/>
And the only limits that slow you down are the ones that are self imposed.<br/>
<br/>
So, the moment you stopped making them &#39;do&#39; school you were unschooling. If<br/>
they ask a question, answer it. If they want to know something help them<br/>
find out as much as they want your help. Include them in what you are doing<br/>
and let them include you in what they are doing.  And once in a while let<br/>
them sleep in!<br/>
<br/>
