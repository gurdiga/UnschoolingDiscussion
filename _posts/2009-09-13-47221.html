<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093314704">Hi Ally-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about single parents online, and I am not single,  though I <br/>
know couple locally who do homeschool or unschool as single parents. One <br/>
does daycare in her home and has little to no help from the dad.  The <br/>
other works in restaurants and often takes her child to work or works <br/>
while the child is with her dad.<br/>
<br/>
There is this group, though, Working Radical Unschoolers. It isn&#39;t very <br/>
active, but if you post, someone will answer. Moms here work part time <br/>
or full time at home or out of the home. Mostly those with older kids, <br/>
over 10, but the ones with younger kids may not have time to post.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And sleep deprivation can be a part of the equation at times when you <br/>
work and unschool, yes. And we have gone through many years with a lower <br/>
than adequate income. And sometimes the kids are stuck at home with less <br/>
options while I am working, though as they get older our options have <br/>
increased.<br/>
<br/>
But I would say that it is all absolutely worth it. My son is 16 and is <br/>
attending school (by choice) for the first time. And I am SO GLAD we <br/>
have chosen this life, even though at times it has been difficult. He is <br/>
not enjoying school at all - the other kids aren&#39;t enjoying it, and it <br/>
seems like a huge waste of time to him.  And he CAN come back home. My <br/>
daughter, 12 has never been to school.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that you are probably going to want to stay flexible and <br/>
that at different times different things might work for you and your <br/>
daughter. Try to find some other unschooling famlies near you, some of <br/>
whom might even do daycare in their home (there is one near us who has <br/>
in the past).<br/>
<br/>
good luck -<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970564592">I was single for the first year I homeschooled, and worked at home for the following 4 years, right up until recently.  I unschooled my son who is now 9 yo.  By the age of 3 or 4, you child should be able to do things on her own quite a bit, and as long as you have a quality environment for her to learn from, she should be good.  I&#39;m not sure what your at home job is like, so I can&#39;t really give any further suggestions.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling, natural learning, and &quot;Always Learning&quot; are pretty much synonymous and occur even in spite of forced schooling. I.E., your toddler is learning every waking minute even tho no one is &quot;teaching&quot; her. So you are already unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226732131">I don&#39;t agree.  If income and sleep become too deprived, no one is going to<br/>
be learning anything as a person can&#39;t function properly without enough of<br/>
either, especially sleep.  There won&#39;t be much happiness if mommy is always<br/>
a zombie and stressed about money.  Are you a single parent, Brad?  Do you<br/>
have personal experience with unschooling as a single parent?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wanted to add something here because I have a 3 year old presently :-) My 3 year old probably COULD do a lot more on her own but still pretty much wants ME with her all the time. She does NOT want to be alone ever, even if it is just another adult in the room. She lets us know this very clearly. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this as a problem, I know that she will do more things on her &quot;own&quot; as she is ready and as I have seen her do in the past. I think a statement like the one above doesn&#39;t take into account individual differences... many 3 year olds MAY do more things on their own... but maybe many wish they didn&#39;t have to also! Also it doesn&#39;t take into account that humans don&#39;t &quot;progress&quot; in a straight line-- usually taking steps forwards and what seems to be backwards. So a previously &quot;independent&quot; child may go through a period where he/she may need more help, attention, time etc. For instance in my house where we have a newborn, my daughter is needing more reassurance whereas a couple of months ago she would play on her own much more... <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This may have been true of Chamille at the age of 3 or 4.  She played well alongside of me.  Margaux, not at all at that age.  I think we have a pretty quality environment to learn from here, but her environment wasn&#39;t quality in her mind, unless it directly involved a parent.<br/>
That continued to be true up until recently and even now it is still sometimes true, like right now at this very moment, she is playing a video game, but it had to include her dad.<br/>
I think it depends on the kid and the parent, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s problematic to assume that a 3 or 4 your old can do things on their own in a quality environment, would suffice.  <br/>
The way in which the original post read, it sounded like the parent wanted to be able to unschool and maximize her time while still being able to work.  Something always has to give.  If it&#39;s the child, even for the sake of an income, it makes it more difficult to unschool.   <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Technically, you aren&#39;t unschooling.  The one single unschooling parent that I knew of, is still unschooling as far as I know, but I&#39;m not sure what she was doing when her child was a baby.  I only first heard about her and met her when her child was 6, he&#39;s now a teen.<br/>
If I were in a similar situation, I would work towards independence, so that by the time my child was legally school age, I would be able to keep that child home.<br/>
When my oldest was 4, she went to a preschool/daycare and my husband and I worked full time.  The only way that I was able to do this is because she actually wanted to be there.  She got up excited to go there every morning, and didn&#39;t want to leave her friends in the evening.  I hadn&#39;t intended on homeschooling at all, let alone unschooling.  If she had hated going, I still would have found a way to get her out, even though, at the time we needed both incomes.<br/>
She didn&#39;t mind leaving either.  When she stopped going, it coincided with her best friend not going and all of us moving in together to save money on housing, which allowed me to quit my job since my plan was to enroll her in a co-op public school that required parent involvement.<br/>
Unschooling takes a huge time commitment!  It doesn&#39;t get any less so as they get older, although older kids will let you get work done here and there if you&#39;ve built up that kind of relationship in which the child isn&#39;t needy for the parent&#39;s attention.<br/>
If an 18 mo old baby feels desperate and needy because mom is working, that neediness won&#39;t go away simply because the child gets older.  I used to work in daycare centers.  They are full of desperately needy children.  I&#39;m not trying to be unsympathetic to the need to work and still raise a baby.  It&#39;ll be about choices each and everyday.  Sometimes you may choose to put a child in daycare to work, sometimes you work really hard to find another way, even if, in the meantime you have a baby in daycare.  It may help to have short term and long term goals with time frames, so that you reach the seemingly unattainable.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586159155">As always, posts are intended for anyone who is interested, not  <br/>
necessarily directed at the original poster. Ideas sent to the list  <br/>

&gt; well<br/>
&gt; behaved.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For relationship building purposes it&#39;s better not to label these  <br/>
kinds of behaviors good and bad. I do notice you but &quot;good&quot; in  <br/>
quotes, but without another word to substitute, it will be hard to  <br/>
not think of the child as willfully choosing their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Easy and spirited might be better term to help a parent see their  <br/>
child in a more positive light and help the parent respond in more  <br/>
positive ways. Easy kids certainly make life easier for the  <br/>
parents! ;-) But kids aren&#39;t intended to be convenient. If someone  <br/>
wants convenience they should get a virtual fish tank for their TV. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
For mindful parenting it&#39;s helpful to let go of &quot;listening&quot; or &quot;well  <br/>
behaved&quot; being the goal. Listening and well behaved are often  <br/>
euphemisms for obedient. When a child doesn&#39;t &quot;listen&quot; it suggests  <br/>
they&#39;re being rude and performing other deliberate anti-social acts.  <br/>
When in truth they&#39;re trying to meet their own needs. If they aren&#39;t  <br/>
listening it&#39;s because mom isn&#39;t listening to them. Mom isn&#39;t meeting  <br/>
their needs so they&#39;re trying to do it themselves. Not listening is  <br/>
in reality fierce determination.<br/>
<br/>
Tantrums are last ditch attempts to communicate. It means the child  <br/>
has tried every way they know (though their repertoire may be small  <br/>
when they&#39;re only 3!)  to let you know they are in need and they&#39;ve  <br/>
broken down in utter frustration. Imagine your husband dragging you  <br/>
around to every fly fishing store in town and you&#39;re trying to let  <br/>
him know you&#39;ve reached your fly fishing limit and you&#39;re hungry and  <br/>
your back hurts and you&#39;re tired ... and he just keeps saying &quot;Soon.  <br/>
I&#39;ll be done soon. And you can have something to eat at home. The  <br/>
food here is too expensive.&quot;  How long before you reached the point  <br/>
where you just couldn&#39;t be polite any more?<br/>
<br/>
Meeting their needs doesn&#39;t mean dropping everything and doing  <br/>
exactly what the child is asking for. It means being responsive and  <br/>
helping the child. It means being attentive and understanding the  <br/>
child&#39;s limits. One more minute to a child can feel like hours.  <br/>
&quot;We&#39;ll get food at home,&quot; doesn&#39;t sound practical and frugal to the  <br/>
child. It sounds like money and what mom has to do is more important  <br/>
than their needs.<br/>
<br/>
To communicate with kids, to build relationships with them, it&#39;s  <br/>
helpful to see and feel what the world is like through them. When  <br/>
we&#39;re seeing the world in the way we wish or want them to see it  <br/>
instead of the way they see it, our words and actions often send a  <br/>
very different message than we intend. And as far as the relationship  <br/>
goes, a misfelt message is the same as if we actually meant the  <br/>
message we sent.<br/>

kids will mean being sleep deprived. It will be lots easier to  <br/>
function if a mom accepts that catching what sleep she can when she  <br/>
can is how her life is in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Though the &quot;always&quot; in your wording suggest a touch of martyrdom as  <br/>
though the only choices were to stuff down your needs in deference to  <br/>
children&#39;s needs or respond to your needs regardless of the kids&#39;  <br/>
needs. Stuffing needs down isn&#39;t healthy for a person. Responding to  <br/>
them because &quot;Mommy has needs&quot; at the expense of kids isn&#39;t healthy  <br/>
for relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Better is accepting the reality of now for now, so when you get more  <br/>
than the little life normally allows it feels like a bonus rather  <br/>
than a constant state of deprivation with moments of sufficiency.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean someone can&#39;t find clever ways to get more. Or  <br/>
ask on a list like this one :-) Neediness can make it especially hard  <br/>
to think outside the box so it can help to ask people who are already  <br/>
outside the box for some ideas :-)<br/>

But what I meant to convey is that we only have two choices in the situation of being the only one available to care for our child: 1.) either sleep and leave them to their own devices, or 2.) stay awake while they are awake.

I do agree with you that when one becomes sleep deprived and or stressed, well being suffers. But make no mistake, learning occurs even in those times, but it might not be the things you desire your child to learn.<br/>

&gt; Unschooling, natural learning, and &quot;Always Learning&quot; are pretty much<br/>

This list exists to discuss unschooling.  No one list member gets to  <br/>
customize or limit the purpose of the list.  Be nice and consider all  <br/>
the advice you get without being critical of it.  Take what you can  <br/>
use and don&#39;t be hateful about the rest.  I&#39;m writing this as the  <br/>
owner of the list, and I&#39;m quite serious.<br/>
<br/>
Divorced people shouldn&#39;t get all their relationship advice from other  <br/>
divorced people.<br/>
Single unschoolers shouldn&#39;t get all their parenting advice from other  <br/>
single unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been a single unschooler, but I could have been a divorced  <br/>
unschooler had I not been careful with my marriage.  I have  discussed  <br/>
details of unschooling lives with other unschoolers for about eighteen  <br/>
years.  Some of them were divorced or unmarried.  Some of them avoided  <br/>
divorce because of discussions on lists like this.  Some, past the  <br/>
point of that, figured out ways to justify paying more attention to  <br/>
their children rather than falling into the mainstream justifications  <br/>
for paying less attention to them.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think we don&#39;t know those other arguments about &quot;no one is going  <br/>
to be learning if...&quot; the mother isn&#39;t taking care of herself first.   <br/>
The mother isn&#39;t going to be learning anything if she settles for  <br/>
those platitudes.   Here are lots of them if you like that kind of  <br/>
message better than the honest attempts to shake you into another kind  <br/>
of thinking that can be beneficial for your children longterm.<br/>

<h4>emiLy Q.</h4>
<time>17 Sep 2009, at 12:13pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429254407">I have an almost six year old and a two year old and even with my husband<br/>
and I both working at home, I still find it easier to work while they sleep.<br/>
If they are awake, they want to be with me.  My husband is with them about<br/>
half of every day, but even if I go into another room with a closed door,<br/>
they usually come in to see me several times an hour.  This is just how it<br/>
is.  Hopefully your work allows for this, and you can work around your<br/>
child.  Maybe you can set up a computer alongside yours and you and your<br/>
child can work side by side.  Or if your work is physical (some of mine<br/>
includes packing orders), your child may be able to help a bit, or just get<br/>
in the way but at least you can get it done while they are awake so you have<br/>
more time to sleep.  My kids are interested in actually helping me for about<br/>
5-10 minutes, they will tape a few boxes together or gather some products.<br/>
My six year old likes to read the packing slip and gather the products into<br/>
a pile, which is great.  Of course this is way slower than if I did it, and<br/>
it is frustrating sometimes, but I choose this over having them in school or<br/>
daycare.<br/>
<br/>
If I were a single parent, I would most likely keep up with the part time<br/>
daycare schedule for as long as possible.  Maybe you can meet other<br/>
homeschoolers and trade off playdates so you have a few hours a week to<br/>
catch up on sleep or work or housework.<br/>
<br/>
I am never caught up on anything.  :)  My parents are coming to visit this<br/>
Sunday, though, so I better get back to cleaning!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766436401">-=-Yes, 3 and 4 year olds should be doing thing independently for  <br/>

<br/>
That repeats the words, but doesn&#39;t clarify at all.<br/>
Putting their own shoes on?  Finding toys and playing by themselves?   <br/>
Wiping their own butts?  Getting their own food?<br/>
This doesn&#39;t need an answer, it needs to be a reminder that vague  <br/>
overreaching statements are pretty worthless.  They sound like  <br/>
important pronouncements, but in the context of discussing  <br/>
unschooling, they&#39;re not helpful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If the child were in daycare she certainly would be doing things  <br/>
for significant periods of time with no adult interaction.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And if the child were in an orphanage, she would be doing even MORE  <br/>
things without adult interaction, and also building up a big case of  <br/>
the inability to attach to humans in the future and probably a little  <br/>
case of lack of growth hormone stimulation.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not talking about what the least a mom can get by with might  <br/>
be.  We&#39;re talking about what&#39;s the most a mom might be able to do for  <br/>
her children.<br/>
<br/>
-= This mother has to work. Not working is probably not an option. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Probably not?<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Things&quot; as in educational toys and activities. &quot;She should be  <br/>
good&quot; was probably a bad choice of terms.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not probably.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;She should be set&quot; would be a better choice I suppose.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She should be set to take care of herself?  To find or to engage,  <br/>
alone, in educational toys and activities?<br/>
<br/>
-=I&#39;m not suggestion the child be locked in a room by herself for 8  <br/>
hours a day for heavens sakes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Okay, but four hours?  Two hours?  Twenty five minutes?<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone can unschool.  We can&#39;t vote or petition the government  <br/>
to let a mom unschool under special circumstances.  Unschooling is  <br/>
going to need to be providing as much attention and input as school- <br/>
life would be doing, and each family individually needs to really  <br/>
understand and be involved to the point that they can understand and  <br/>
justify and defend their unschooling under the laws where they are, or  <br/>
they need to hide out and be prepared to meet the possible  <br/>
consequences of being brought in for questioning by the county child  <br/>
protective services or whatever agency deals with homeschoolers where  <br/>
they are.<br/>
<br/>
EVERY single child can go to government funded school, I think, in  <br/>
every English-speaking jurisdiction, when compulsory school-age  <br/>
comes.  Before then, there are pre-schools and day-cares.  If a mother  <br/>
has to work and that&#39;s not (or as the poster put, &quot;probably not&quot;) an  <br/>
option, then unschooling might not be an option, nor any kind of  <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You know what IS an option?  Put the kids up for adoption.  Relinquish  <br/>
parental rights.   Nobody is MAKING anyone keep their kids.  If you  <br/>
have never considered putting children up for adoption you haven&#39;t  <br/>
really chosen to keep them.  By thinking about whether adoption might  <br/>
be a good option, then (and only then) can one really choose to keep  <br/>
the kids.  Having chosen to keep them, now what might be good for  <br/>
them?  I would rather have my kids in school than to expect them, at  <br/>
three or four, or ten or twelve, to take care of themselves for a few  <br/>
hours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655164352">-=- NEVER suggested young children could take care of themselves. I  <br/>
suggested that they could be taught some independence.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is very clearly marked as an unschooling discussion list for  <br/>
those committed to unschooling.  It&#39;s not a list about teaching  <br/>
children *anything.*<br/>
Independence develops naturally from confidence and safety and  <br/>
caring.  It&#39;s not taught, to three year olds.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And yes, I agree with Ally that this conversation has been blown  <br/>
out of proportion-=-<br/>
<br/>
Out of proportion to what?  Proportion has to have a comparison.  In  <br/>
proportion to the glorious potential of unschooling, a suggestion that  <br/>
a three year old can take care of herself is HUGELY out of proportion  <br/>
from the beginning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Should be?  Really?  Some kids might be able to while others really can&#39;t or won&#39;t.  Daycare isn&#39;t optimal for raising healthy connected children, in a large part, because they do everything independent of their parents.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;This mother has to work.  Not working is probably not an option.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even if this is true, acknowledging that daycare isn&#39;t the best place for a child to be, will help her get to a place where she doesn&#39;t have to use that option.  If you can&#39;t see that there is a better option, you might never seek it out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Things&quot; as in educational toys and activities.&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do they have to be educational toys and activities?  What about helping a child do the things they want to do?  If it happens to be &quot;educational&quot; then that&#39;s what it is.  Kids will learn from non educational things too.  Kids learn from everything around them.<br/>
