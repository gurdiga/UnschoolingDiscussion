&#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me bows<br/>
to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones, our tired<br/>
feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a dimension that is<br/>
more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the &#39;trappings and the<br/>
suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39;<br/>
and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all that, a space for the<br/>
eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>

places, skateboards and roller blades are banned in the downtown area where<br/>
the most pedestrians are.  (And they recently made that area smaller.)  Is<br/>
there a skate park in your area?  You might at least use the passage of the<br/>
law to lobby for one.  Or argue that they aren&#39;t providing any other place<br/>
for them to be used, so why not uncongested sidewalks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802493570">It&#39;s in Kulpmont, PA.  It&#39;s a little residential town, no busy <br/>
downtown or anything.  Just a bunch of old people who like to <br/>
complain.  That might sound harsh, but it really is true.  Once I was <br/>
taking a walk with my kids right after a snowstorm and was told by <br/>
two grumpy old people that if I wanted to be out in this that I <br/>
should do it at my own place.  They were probably mad because the <br/>
schools had a snow day and a lot of kids were out and about.  <br/>
<br/>
I do plan to fight this.  I&#39;ve left a message on the machine at the <br/>
ACLU, I&#39;m calling the mayor at his home tonight (He has a full time <br/>
job and is only available in his office twice a week).  My daughter <br/>
wants to walk the streets of our town and get as many signatures on a <br/>
petition as possible.  I will try to round up some others to help and <br/>
attend the meeting as well.  <br/>

If you couldn&#39;t access the link I gave and want to read it, go to <br/>

October 9 called &quot;Kulpmont looks to adopt skateboard, scooter <br/>

       The proposed law described in the news article seems like the typical <br/>
knee-jerk response -- one person or small group of people causes a problem, <br/>
so everyone gets punished. I remember the injustice of it as a grade school <br/>
child, sitting at my desk getting my knuckles struck with a ruler because one <br/>
or two students had been disruptive. <br/>
       This is not fair to the children of Kulpmont who just want to ride <br/>
their scooters up and down the sidewalks in front of their houses. Yes, there <br/>
are the foul-mouthed,extreme sporters that can give this group a bad name. <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that most of the people act in such a manner.<br/>
       In Charlottesville, VA we are lucky enough to have Dave Matthews as a <br/>
local celebrity (not originally from here, but made his name here). Dave was <br/>
instrumental in providing funding for a city skatepark. What a great place. <br/>
Many are hesitant at first (assumed behavior) but quickly find out what a <br/>
great place for all ages. There are rules, and they are enforced (the guys <br/>
who run the place are boarders). This seems to be done in such a way that <br/>
empowers the participants. It is their park; they need to keep things running <br/>
smoothly. It&#39;s impressive to watch their responses to new or younger riders <br/>
or if anyone falls. The group does not tolerate foul language or risky (not <br/>
meaning some of the stunts that they try) behavior.<br/>
       I would personally push this solution (skatepark) plus try to soften <br/>
the knee-jerk law (people not engaging in activities that damage property). <br/>
Maybe enlist the help of the skating community. If they want a park bad <br/>
enough, they&#39;ll find a way. There has bound to be somebody out there who&#39;s <br/>
willing to front money for a skatepark. Find out information from other <br/>
cities with similar programs. Come armed to meet with the mayor. Let the <br/>
mayor know that you agree that the skaters should not be destroying property <br/>
and should respect the other citizens in the community, but what harm is a <br/>
small child riding her scooter do? Then present your proposal with any <br/>
research that you&#39;ve done.<br/>
       I&#39;m climbing down from my soapbox now. Good luck with all this.<br/>
