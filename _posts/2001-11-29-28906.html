Before somebody goes off on me about grades :-), I don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; grades but they are all around us... on the back of books, on the corner of toy boxes, on software (well, that&#39;s usually ages). It&#39;s hard to hide that sort of stuff... I&#39;ve thought about stickers on the back of the books but that just seems to call even *more* attention to it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you look deep down, and really look at the substance, its possible (I <br/>
said possible, not probable) that the child wants to PLEASE the parents <br/>
so they initiate it.<br/>
<br/>
Like the kid who waits for the clap at the end of everything they do <br/>
because thats how they LEARNED to do things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If she gets deflated at seeing the &#39;level 1&#39; words, instead of elated <br/>
that she read a book, then the issue isn&#39;t with reading. <br/>
<br/>
Its an outrageous concept. One has to mull it around like fine wine for a <br/>
time...<br/>

fact that it bothers you that is the issue here.<br/>

Have patience with yourself if you truly *want* to unschool, it takes <br/>
time to unlearn the pressures of society.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you get a sense of just where her difficulty lies?  Does she have <br/>
difficulty with phonics, or has she not developed enough of a sight <br/>
vocabulary so she has to sound out every word?  If it&#39;s phonics, I worked <br/>
with Lars using a book called The Road to Reading.  It isn&#39;t geared toward <br/>
really young kids, and it really helped with his phonics.  (The fact that I <br/>
was insisting that he do it caused other problems, but if your daughter is <br/>
really wanting to learn, it shouldn&#39;t cause her any.)  If the problem is <br/>
with sight words or other fluency difficulties, there are sites on the <br/>
internet that offer exercises in increasing reading fluency.  I&#39;m afraid I <br/>
don&#39;t have any urls for you, but searching on reading fluency found me a <br/>
bunch when I looked before.  They didn&#39;t help my son, again because he <br/>
didn&#39;t want help at that time.  The other thing is just lots of <br/>
practise.  Maybe you could get right away from the books with reading <br/>
levels.  Go to the library and get short picture books or early chapter <br/>
books without any grade levels on them for her to read.  If you can get <br/>
book and tape sets, all the better, though you might need to sit with her <br/>
and help her keep her place.  A lot of them go too fast for the early reader.<br/>
<br/>
The more you can pinpoint where the problem is, the easier it will be for <br/>
us to come up with suggestions.  Above all, help her find books she <br/>
enjoys.  You do still read to her don&#39;t you?  A lot of people find that <br/>
getting the child to read every second chapter or page or even paragraph <br/>
can improve the reading skills with less frustration than asking them to do <br/>
all the reading.  Even asking her to read the first paragraph of every <br/>
chapter or something would give her practise.<br/>
