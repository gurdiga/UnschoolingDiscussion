<div id="ygrps-yiv-352429561">I&#39;m just overwhelmed with the wonder of it all today.  These <br/>
children are so happy and so endlessly curious.  My 13yo dd--who <br/>
just left school this year and claims she doesn&#39;t like to read--<br/>
spending an hour poring over an article in the Smithsonian about Ken <br/>
Kesey.  &quot;Oh, Mom, this is so cool!  Have you ever heard of &quot;One Flew <br/>
Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest?&quot;  The livingroom floor covered in Star Wars <br/>
Legos after my 10yo ds watched the new DVD release with extras.  Now <br/>
he&#39;s doing something with string and a Batman action figure and the <br/>
spiral staircase to the basement.  Teaching Corrina new guitar <br/>
chords.  Talking about the History of Rock and Roll video we watched <br/>
last week.  Beethoven booming on the stereo.  Listening to an <br/>
audiobook of &quot;Animal Farm&quot; on the way to choir and talking about <br/>
communism.  Homestar Runner!  Baking cookies.  &quot;Why is it half white <br/>
sugar and half brown sugar?  I&#39;m going to try it with all <br/>
brown.&quot;  &quot;OK.&quot;  &quot;Mom, how to you spell &#39;undaunted?&#39;&quot;  Going to the <br/>
gym together and spending an hour without talking--everyone <br/>
following his/her own program.  Resting together.<br/>
<br/>
This is just the sweetest way to live.  It is moment after moment of <br/>
pure grace.  When I tell people I &quot;homeschool,&quot;  they give me kind <br/>
of a sad, sympathetic look and say how difficult that must be.  I <br/>
tell them it&#39;s the easiest and best part of my life.<br/>
<br/>
Just had to tell someone.  Thanks for listening!<br/>

That&#39;s exactly how I feel almost all the time.  We are SO lucky to have<br/>
discovered this lifestyle and to have settled into it comfortably without<br/>
all the worries that many homeschoolers have.  (are they keeping up with<br/>
their peers?)  It just feels so right and good.  I used to shout it from the<br/>
roof tops, but no one understood what I was shouting about.  ;0)  We just<br/>
happily go along every day and it feels so right and good.  The parenting<br/>
changes that I&#39;ve made after reading on these lists have made our<br/>
unschooling lives twice as sweet too.  I am so thankful to all the people<br/>
who participate here and on other unschooling lists.  Life is good!<br/>
