<div id="ygrps-yiv-622852826"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Dear Kim ,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your little one might just have a different<br/>
temperment. Some folks are more sensitive and their<br/>
nervous systems are more exposed or delicate or<br/>
something. I have had children who cried a lot. I just<br/>
held them and comforted and realized it was just who<br/>
they were. They are very content folks today.<br/>
Sometimes comforting was not what they wanted.. That<br/>
is okay. There is nothing that says we will all be<br/>
happy all the time. Babies have times they are more<br/>
fussy. Just keep him close to you. I know this a real<br/>
challenge when you have other little ones around. They<br/>
really are only little for a tiny while, let the dirt<br/>
pile up and snuggle the babies. Have hubby pitch in<br/>
and help get the house stuff done when the kids are<br/>
down for the night. Also try to stay relaxed. Babies<br/>
are so sensitive to our signals and emotions and<br/>
especially evenning tends to get to be a busy time for<br/>
lots of us.<br/>
Do not panic about your guy who wants his bottle. I<br/>
liked getting special cups from the dollar store, you<br/>
know ones with Santas at Christmas, whatever. Then at<br/>
meal times have the cups out. He will ask when he<br/>
wants one. It is fun to use theme cups for the older<br/>
kids too. My kids still want them. And my little ones<br/>
generally do not want to be far behind the older ones.<br/>
No pressure from you just the availability of another<br/>
option. <br/>
Kim are you interested in moving towards unschooling? <br/>

<br/>
Really good advice.  The more patient and giving you can be now, the  <br/>
sooner it will be better, I think.<br/>
<br/>
My kids all really liked backpacks.  Some moms can use a Snuggli or  <br/>
the equivalent kind of sling even with bigger kids, but I never got  <br/>
the hang of it.  But I did use an aluminum frame backpack like people  <br/>
use for hiking, and would just carry a baby around that way lots of  <br/>
times.  They can see what&#39;s going on, and they can touch you and see  <br/>
you and feel your heart beating.  If one fell asleep up there I&#39;d  <br/>
take the pack off and get them safe and comfortable, sometimes not  <br/>
even taking them out (it had a stand that could be folded out).<br/>
<br/>
Children who  need more closeness just need more closeness.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t already sleep with him, maybe try that.  If he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
take a bath with you, maybe do that.  The more touch and togetherness  <br/>
you can manage, the sooner he&#39;ll have enough.<br/>

My 4 yo still uses bottles and sippy cups, but also likes straws a <br/>

little holes in most of her bottle nipples and likes certain holy <br/>

a while I thought that the nipples were just getting old and wearing <br/>

And I guess I wasn&#39;t clear in my other posts, but I do NOT let him cry, I<br/>
hold him or sit with him when he wants me too.  The only time he is not<br/>

could give him more of myself.  He has my whole self all the time, because I<br/>

<br/>
I think you are referring to drinking out of a cup?<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s step back for a minute.  I think it&#39;s a generally accepted <br/>
unschooling idea that *kids can and will learn things when they are <br/>
ready** (and interested).  It helps unschooling flourish if you and I <br/>
believe that our kids can and will learn necessary skills and don&#39;t need <br/>
us to push them past their resistance.  &quot;Respect the resistance&quot;, I say.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a real hang-up in our culture about getting kids to do <br/>
things at the youngest possible ages.  Letting go of that will help <br/>
unschooling in general, I believe.<br/>

straws that insert into the nipple of the bottle. That way the child doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to hold the bottle upside down to drink. They work great and me and the<br/>
kids loved them!<br/>

<br/>
Good!! He&#39;s way too young. Is there a reason he isn&#39;t nursing still? <br/>
Kids have a natural desire to suck until around 6 years old or so <br/>
usually. It varies from child to child of course, but it&#39;s very <br/>
natural to have a strong desire to suck at that age.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine trying to wean a baby that young.<br/>
<br/>
In other countries he&#39;d still be getting nursed on demand. Heck, if it <br/>
were my child he&#39;d still be getting nursed on demand!!:) I realize <br/>
there are real life reasons for not nursing (adoption, health issues <br/>
etc...) but the need/desire is still there.<br/>
