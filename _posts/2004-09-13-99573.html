<div id="ygrps-yiv-40922468">Do you have a farmer&#39;s market?  She could make things<br/>
through the Winter and have quite a stand in the<br/>
Spring.  Also, she could sell things on e-bay.  Maybe<br/>
she could even start her own webpage and put a link to<br/>
it on her ebay pages, or you could add it to your<br/>
signature.  We have craft stores here that let you<br/>
rent a booth...they are fairly inexpensive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-224999304">Perhaps a  table in a Christmas Craft Faire  might be an idea. My husband has had booths for his woodworking  at our big local one for  almost 20  years . When the girls mom (adopted grandaughter) was 9-11 or so she made bracelets  and key rigs out of gimp (plastic lacing) and sold them to other kids  from our tables. She sold them from 50 cents-$1 as I recall. don&#39;t know if it covered the costs of the findings but I guess it did. Actually I bought most of the stuff and she made and sold it.<br/>
She helped in the shop whenever she  wanted to  and  when she was a bit older she made  a lot of the cedar  planters etc. and she was paid  by us for that. She was fast and good  at running the chop saw and air nailer. <br/>
The girls , age 9 have gotten very good at using the scroll saw and can turn out some pieces that you cant, tell from some of the adult stuff I see but they arent really interested in doing it for sale right now.<br/>
They do love the craft faire which is a November institution for us but as they get older they want to buy more from the other booths -that can get a bit crazy.<br/>
There is  &quot;always&quot; a sale for stuff priced from 25 c. to about 2$  -the kids at the sale usually have some change  to spend on themselves or friends.I see a few kids every year doing that even though the balance of the craft sale is geared to bigger bucks. <br/>
they sell-baking ( cupcakes-cookies etc by the each-plastic bead  things. bead animal key rings, -candles-decorated candies -can&#39;t think what all.<br/>
a few of the kids go on to produce a range of quality items as they get older.Some help a parent produce and sell. <br/>
 A lot just try it once but they  get a kick out of the personal interaction of selling .<br/>
sometimes it is sad when  a bunch of kids have a whole table full of   higher priced but poorer quality things and they are so embarrased when no one buys. <br/>
A homeschooling family in our area did that and I just felt so badly for them. the parent just didnt check out the type of sale beforehand.<br/>
What I have seen that doesn&#39;t work is poorly made stuff  that they try to sell to adults.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your daughter might gear her things for other kids to buy for their moms-grandmas etc. (little calendars-)<br/>
If you live in an area with lots of sales you will probably have to begin checking it out now to book a table. <br/>
If she is having fun with the whole thing  it might work.<br/>

I got the first book for my unschooling community&#39;s library.  We have an almost-five-year-old who is entrepreneurial-minded and she and her mom have been reading it and coming up with all kinds of great ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
The other book, by Kyosaki is great reading.  He has other books and games to go along with the first one, but I&#39;d recommend reading that first.  I&#39;m sure you can find it at the library.<br/>
