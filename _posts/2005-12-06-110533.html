source...<br/>
<br/>
...The X in Xmas is the 22nd letter of the greek alphabet. <br/>
pronounced &quot;chi,&quot; is has been the symbol for &quot;Christ&quot; among christians <br/>
since the earliest days of gentile christianity, when the followers <br/>
spoke greek.  Chi is the first letter of the greek word &quot;Christos&quot; in <br/>
english letters, which means &quot;anointed&quot; and is a translation of the <br/>
hebrew/aramaic term &quot;messias&quot; or &quot;messiah.&quot;  It was later translated <br/>
into english as &quot;Christ.&quot;  The term &quot;Xmas&quot; has been used by religious <br/>
christians in europe since the 16th century.  Carol</div>
