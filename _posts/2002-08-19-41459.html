<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932677533"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If a kid is making<br/>
&gt; one mark on a piece of paper and throwing it away repeatedly, I<br/>

just cut the pieces in quarters.  He loved the size, it was &quot;just right&quot; for<br/>
what he saw in his mind&#39;s eye, and we got four drawings per paper without me<br/>
nagging about using all of the paper.<br/>
