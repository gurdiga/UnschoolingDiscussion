like &quot;The What Your _th Grader Needs to Know books are great if you want your <br/>

This is really true.  If a nationwide curriculum was strongly enforced<br/>
it could have a narrowing effect on the diversity of ideas found in the<br/>
American population.  Just like plants need to be diverse and evolving<br/>
to create a healthy ecosystem, ideas need to flourish individually and<br/>
differently, not be &quot;planted&quot; in a &quot;monoculture&quot; consisting of a single<br/>
truth that is the right answer on the test.<br/>
<br/>
If everyone always believed the same &quot;party line&quot; about everything, how<br/>
would the knowledge base ever expand and change.  I think there needs to<br/>
be conflict and competition and destruction for ideas to grow and improve.<br/>
<br/>
Homogenized ideas fed alike into all young citizens is a scary idea to me!<br/>
