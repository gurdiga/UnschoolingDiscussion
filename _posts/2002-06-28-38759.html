&gt; am really having to bite my tongue.  It is really starting to get on my<br/>

&gt; tempting.  But that would just make me look bad &lt;sigh&gt;.  So I am venting<br/>

I&#39;ve dealt with persistant people, and I agree that these comments get very<br/>
annoying after a while.  Is it possible to have a &quot;we like you and value our<br/>
friendship, but can we please declare a truce on religion&quot; sort of<br/>
conversation?  To agree that you are different from each other, and leave it<br/>
at that?  Maybe being politely frank would help them see that you&#39;re not<br/>
interested and dislike the religious push, rather than letting them believe<br/>
that maybe, just maybe, if they keep asking, someday they&#39;ll get you to be<br/>
what they want you to be.  Changing the subject and all helps, in the short<br/>
term, but for long-term results, you maybe have to address the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, <br/>

make?!&quot;  Funny thing is the older girl was asking my husband if she could go<br/>
too while he and my son were loading the car with their gear last night.<br/>
She is just taking it all in.  She doesn&#39;t question everything we do like<br/>
her sister does.  I see her watching and taking it all in....<br/>
