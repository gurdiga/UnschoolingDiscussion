<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671840209">Hi,  I&#39;m hoping some of you have helped a child change his/her sleep-wake cycle?  My 14 year old son typically stays up on his computer/Skype until 2-4am and wakes between 12-2pm.  He needs/wants to start waking at 7:30am in a few days for a camp counselor position he accepted.  <br/>
<br/>
Over the last week he has tried to shift his schedule, but his body is having trouble!  I thought it would be as simple as waking him up early a few days and then he would be tired earlier and shift.  But he just can&#39;t wake up early!  And he can&#39;t fall asleep earlier.   His body is  really resisting this change!<br/>
<br/>
He has turned off the computer around 10 the last 2 nights and laid in bed trying to sleep with not much luck.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else here had success making an intentional shift in sleep cycle?  Did you find anything to help especially well?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924151387"><p dir="ltr">My son also goes to bed quite late and when he knows he needs to wake up early for something (like today,  he has to be up by 8:30am for video game testing), he gets himself ready for early sleep the following ways:<br>

1. Shuts off all electronic devices one hour prior to the time he wants to fall asleep at.<br>
2. Drinks a glass of warm milk, which has tryptophan. <br>
3. We have black out shades in his room so the room gets really dark.<br>
4. Sometimes he uses a sleep mask for extra darkness.<br>
5. He usually reads in bed for about 30 minutes to an hour to help him settle down.<br>
 <br>
Some other tips for sleeping are journaling in bed if your son likes to write. Keeping the temperature cool (68-70 degrees Fahrenheit).  And lastly, listening to relaxation CDs or on his ipod (or whatever music device you have) can help lull the mind to sleep.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Good luck! I&#39;m sure like Joyce said, just knowing he has to wake up will be a driving force to solve his challenge. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Warmly,<br>
Megan</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919993502">And I thought I had asked a straight-forward question!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Needs/wants to&quot;?<br/>
He has commited to be at a certain place at a certain time.  Hasn&#39;t this happened before for your family?  Have you all gotten up early because you were leaving on a trip, or because there was something scheduled or someone was coming over?<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about this, I realize I&#39;m worried he will not be able to do it.  There have been many times he has a class he wants to take, tries to go to sleep earlier but has a lot of trouble falling asleep.  Then in the morning he wakes up and feels too sick to go.  By 2 or 3:00 he is feeling fine, but is truly feeling sick at the time he would need to walk out the door and ends up not going.   This doesn&#39;t happen every time.<br/>
<br/>
And going deeper, I realize I&#39;m trying to prevent him from failing or not living up to the commitment the way I would.  So I&#39;ve started to take charge of the process, which is silly!  <br/>
<br/>
There have been lots of great tips and suggestions which I will pass on to him.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!!<br/>

So I&#39;ve started to take charge of the process, which is silly!&lt;&lt;&lt;</span><br style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;"><br> </span></div></div></div></span></blockquote><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s silly. &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;I think it&#39;s largely conditioning. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.666666984558105px;font-family:arial, sans-serif;word-spacing:normal;">I was in school for 18 years. &nbsp;For 13 of those years, every morning, five days a week, ten months of the year, I was awakened at the same time. And every night I was told (at least in elementary and high school) that I needed to be in bed by a certain time in order to function well enough for school the next day. In following this routine, I and my parents were trained to believe that I was setting a pattern of living that would lead to things like responsibility, drive, ambition, independence, etc.</span><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.666666984558105px;"><br></span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><font face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.666666984558105px;">If and when children are given a routine to follow, how do *they* come to know when they are authentically driven toward a goal? I do not believe that children who go to school never discover what really motivates them. But I do think that having an artificial system in place could make it more difficult to differentiate true initiative from the derivative of routine experience and reward. And, I wonder how that, in turn, influences their choices and/or even limits their options.</span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font face="arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12.666666984558105px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">I asked a similar question to your own a couple/few years ago. You can find it in the archives. I told myself Ethan had a sleeping disorder -- phase shift disorder or something like that. I received very insightful replies, like yourself. Like yourself, my question was motivated by my own fear of him not being able to fulfill his commitments, both at that particular time, and into his future. The advice I received gave me the confidence to continue moving forward in my partnership with Ethan. In time, I&#39;ve had the wonderful opportunity to witness my son become very clear about where he wants to spend his energy. He has a great deal of integrity. If he makes a commitment, he keeps it. Consequently, he makes commitments thoughtfully and cautiously. Sometimes I&#39;ll ask him if he wants to do something and he&#39;ll say &quot;Let me think about that.&quot; His decision to agree or not to agree is based on what he has learned about himself through the choices that are made available to him. &nbsp;That&#39;s been pretty cool and hugely enlightening to see.</span><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:12.666666984558105px;">Karen James.</span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-945099384ygrps-yiv-717899542"><br></div></div>
