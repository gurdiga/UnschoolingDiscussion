<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621680130">Question...<br/>
<br/>
To anyone who uses daily journals, logs and portfolios to satisfy their<br/>
state&#39;s assessment requirement:  how much detail about daily or weekly<br/>
activities do you provide?  Do you just list some highlights or write<br/>
in-depth descriptions of activities?  How much material do you put in a<br/>
portfolio? Should I start collecting it throughout the year, or just gather<br/>
up things near the time when the assessment is due? <br/>
<br/>
Also, my school dept. required me to agree to a &quot;minimum of 900 hours of<br/>
instruction.&quot;  How can I prove (or the school dept. disprove) that I met<br/>
this requirement through what I write in our log?  I know my son is<br/>
learning something every day, but my daily journal may not reflect this to<br/>
the satisfaction of the school superintendent.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493456821">Somebody should provide a service wherein you send the activities of daily<br/>
living<br/>
of your child and then they send you back a log with everything translated into<br/>
educational gobblelygook and bafflegab.  I&#39;ve seen something like this in<br/>
Growing Without Schools newsletter wherein someone did just that by which I<br/>
mean they wrote an article translating their kid&#39;s everyday play into<br/>
educational goals stated in that arcane blather educators use.  They eat it up.<br/>
And what&#39;s more it was all true.  Tossing a rock, doing somersaults, playing<br/>
with Playmobile, all contain every aspect of &quot;Education&quot; and many that schools<br/>
don&#39;t provide.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look around for that article and try and post it if I can get permission.<br/>
<br/>
Do they look at your &quot;journal&quot; or are you just required to have it available<br/>
for them to look at?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820948952">Thanks to all who responded to my question about what to do about portfolio<br/>
assessments.<br/>
Seeing as we just returned from a weekend away camping, and I have a long<br/>
list of emails, I&#39;ll respond to all the posts here.<br/>
<br/>
Joel:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if they will actually look at my journal or if they just<br/>
&quot;might&quot; look at it. The other homeschoolers from my town that I have met<br/>
all use standardized tests as assessments. I think the superintendent was<br/>
quoted in a local newspaper as saying he was &quot;very involved&quot; with local<br/>
homeschoolers (ie: keeping an eye on them??) So he might very well look at<br/>
the journal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Debra:<br/>
<br/>
I am in Massachusetts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Natalie:<br/>
<br/>
The state can only require an &quot;equivalent&quot; program at home. So I guess (and<br/>
this seems a little vague) they can request a minimum of 900 hours because<br/>
it&#39;s equivalent to the public schools, but they can&#39;t specify how or when<br/>
the 900 hours take place. They also don&#39;t seem to be able to make you<br/>
document the 900 hours, as in a daily log of subjects covered...which is<br/>
good because they wouldn&#39;t get that anyway..*g*. I just don&#39;t know what<br/>
they would ask for if they did want me to prove the 900 hours, or if anyone<br/>
has ever experienced this. Maybe it&#39;s good that it&#39;s all so vague!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Andi:<br/>
<br/>
Your descriptions are similar to what I have been doing. Perhaps I need to<br/>
be more descriptive though; sometimes I just list an activity and don&#39;t<br/>
specify what skills are being used (eg: &quot;one hour of shooting hoops in the<br/>
backyard&quot; to me assumes one hour of phys. ed. in school terms, but I don&#39;t<br/>
put it in the journal that way.) Sometimes I just take the insert that<br/>
comes with a piece of computer software and copy parts of it to detail the<br/>
skills my son practices when he uses it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s aggravating to have to look at each little part of the day and have to<br/>
think in terms of analyzing everything in such detail in case somebody at<br/>
the school dept., who doesn&#39;t live in your home and doesn&#39;t know your<br/>
child, wants to read about it and be critical!  Perhaps I am overreacting<br/>
because I am so new to all of this &quot;reporting&quot; stuff and I don&#39;t know what<br/>
to expect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627304892">yes, vague (in the law) is good!  <br/>
<br/>
i agree it is exhausting to try to record everything!  whew, i tried it for a <br/>
while and simply could not keep up.  but fortunately i am not required to <br/>
provide all of that in tennessee.  <br/>
<br/>
we have begun doing scrapbooking as a part of our recordkeeping.  it helps <br/>
that i have been a creative memories consultant for 8+ years...(so i have <br/>
easy access to great supplies and an appreciation for the value of recording <br/>
our living history...) but i have just last year had my oldest two children <br/>
begin memorybooks of their schoolage years (they are now 9.75 & 7.)  this can <br/>
cover a lot of areas if you put an emphasis on journaling, both by you and <br/>
your child about whatever things youve been into, no matter what the area.   <br/>
and they love it!  it also provides a permanent sample of their handwriting <br/>
(& drawing if you let them draw a bit) and it would be impressive to show to <br/>
whoever was required, while also being a unique and valuable contribution to <br/>
your family&#39;s photo/history compilation when using long lasting materials.  :)<br/>
<br/>
another recordkeeping note: i just noticed that the game rummy roots from <br/>
eternal hearts has a little blurb of &quot;skills learned&quot; that would be a good <br/>
reference for putting together the schoolish sounding portfolio at the end of <br/>
the year.  i personally would just record on my calendar &quot;rummy roots&quot; if <br/>
they played it that day and then later when putting together the required <br/>
stuff would refer to the &quot;skills&quot; list (vocabulary, word comprehension, <br/>
alphabetical skills, math computation, memorization, listening skills, etc.)  <br/>
to fill in.<br/>
<br/>
perhaps many of the homeschool family produced games and activities will <br/>
include lists like these, or maybe many already do?<br/>
<br/>
question:  what are your favorite learning games?  i have just rec&#39;d an order <br/>
of fun things for our &quot;school year&quot; that include some aristoplay games: hive <br/>
alive (math strategy) moneywise and a greek myths card game.<br/>
<br/>
we love lots of familiar games too like: uno, checkers and chess, scrabble, <br/>
clue, etc.<br/>

It&#39;s probably not as bad as it seems here. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m nervous about<br/>
how things work in this town, being our first year and all. I have a friend<br/>
who homeschools in the town next to ours and she never sends in any<br/>
proposal or assessment and they never ask for one. The school<br/>
superintendent told her that he has relatives who homeschool and he is very<br/>
open to the idea. Maybe I should start looking at real estate listings in<br/>
her town. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

The scrapbook sounds fun for kids, and easy too. Right now my son takes<br/>
pictures of his projects with a Polaroid instant camera and we keep them in<br/>
a photo album. He likes to be able to look at the photos later in case he<br/>
wants to recreate a project.<br/>
<br/>
Favorite learning games? Hmm..that&#39;s hard because although we have a lot of<br/>
games (the usual Monopoly, Pente, Chinese Checkers, Scrabble, etc.) my son<br/>
has one or two that he always wants to play. His top favorite is Nascar<br/>
Champions (he loves cars and racing) which does have some &quot;learning&quot;<br/>
elements like reading (instruction cards), math (adding up to five dice),<br/>
and strategy. Every once in a while I&#39;ll suggest playing something else:<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s greeted with enthusiasm, sometimes with a no. Right now he<br/>
is stuck on this one game. We did recently add a GeoSafari board game and<br/>
Battleship, and he likes Connect Four also.<br/>
