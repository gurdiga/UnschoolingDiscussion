&lt;&lt;  if <br/>
 it is important to us, or to our children, to take the SAT, then we should <br/>
 incorporate preparation for that at some point.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m finding out about unschooling for us is that it needs to be <br/>
important to Zak and whether it&#39;s important to me is not that relevant, <br/>
unless it&#39;s a safety, health, issue.  Thankfully, being from England, I have <br/>
no idea about the Grade system in American Schools, I just can&#39;t figure it <br/>
out and as for these SAT, ACT or whatever they are... I haven&#39;t got a clue as <br/>
to what they are and why anyone would want to take them (presumably that&#39;s <br/>
what you do)... I don&#39;t want to know either.  If and when it becomes <br/>
important then it will be put in front of us.<br/>

&lt;&lt; until after my third child was<br/>
born.  Now I just need to be &quot;off duty&quot;.  I get very resentful if they<br/>
aren&#39;t going to bed and asking me for help &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
kathy and corallyn-- i feel similar to you about these things, thriving when <br/>
i get some solitude in my days...  and my dh has done the tv thing, too...  <br/>
tho over the years he has gotten so much better.  so much of what is on tv is <br/>
not appropriate for our littlest ones that he doesnt have much to watch if <br/>
they are in the room anyway!  but he usually is tired and so wants to not put <br/>
too much effort forth in playing when he comes home.  we are at a better <br/>
stage now bc our girls (10 & 8) enjoy talking with him or playing <br/>
(non-taxing) games, and the boys (4 & 2) like to pretend he is a jumping gym! <br/>
 the new baby doesnt end up with much of his attention these days, but he <br/>
gets much of mine... so things keep shifting as we all grow.<br/>

&lt;&lt; But how do you unschool and provide a structure to your <br/>
day? ...  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
corallyn,<br/>
i love the question you posed!  it is true!  i never thought about it that <br/>
way, and it can be a source of frustration, or of distraction, or (most <br/>
likely for me) leave me scheduling myself lots of things for me to do, <br/>
without enough extra time to attend to what will be without question needs <br/>
from my children.  it is silly and seems sooo obvious especially with the <br/>
ages of my little ones, but i always have a looong list of things to do, and <br/>
since some days (very few, but...) i actually get to attempt a lot of them, i <br/>
just have to enjoy the moment on the days (much more often) that i dont get <br/>
to attempt much of anything on the list!<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;If there is something I need/want them to do <br/>
then I tell them they have to do &quot;this&quot; first and then they can do <br/>
what they want. Also, if they start running wild in the house they <br/>
get sent outside and have to stay out till they are ready to be calm.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i do this too!  i think it teaches them respect for others, and self control, <br/>
too!<br/>
