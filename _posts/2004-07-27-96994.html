<div id="ygrps-yiv-112966991">I thought I&#39;d share what&#39;s been going on here today.<br/>
Sarah, age 8, has spent the day playing with<br/>
Tetris-like puzzles on her Jumpstart games and working<br/>
to solve a mystery game on another CD she has. She&#39;s<br/>
requested that I call her &quot;Secret Agent Sarah&quot; when<br/>
she&#39;s on the computer. <br/>
<br/>
Logan has been spending as much time as he can on the<br/>
computer too. I think we&#39;re going to end up having to<br/>
build 3 more computers so that everyone has their own!<br/>
But he&#39;s also begun spending quite a bit of time<br/>
building towns to drive his Hot Wheels cars through,<br/>
which is nice. <br/>
<br/>
Megan just plays a little of this and a little of<br/>
that, but here lately I&#39;ve often found her sitting<br/>
quietly looking at books. <br/>
<br/>
Gracie has figured out that she can make the recorder<br/>
toot, so she&#39;s often just walking through the house<br/>
tooting and laughing, or playing in the playroom. <br/>
