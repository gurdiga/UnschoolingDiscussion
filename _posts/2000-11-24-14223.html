&lt;&lt;  It seems the oldest one usually starts a project and<br/>
 then the younger joins in to the best of her ability. We read together<br/>
 allot. I read out-loud for an hour or two everyday to both of the girls.<br/>
 Not sure what you are wanting to know exactly.. feel free to ask again.. I<br/>
 don&#39;t feel &#39;pounced on&#39; at all..LOL.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Julie, i appreciate that.  I think because we planned another child to <br/>
be born already, it is more of a focus for me (a bit of a sense of lack) due <br/>
to it taking so long, and my wanting about 2-3 kids running around. It is <br/>
amazing what crops up in mind when one feels a &#39;lack&#39; in ones&#39; life! It <br/>
sounds like you have a great situation there.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just thought I&#39;d step in and add my 2 cents worth here...we also have an <br/>
unplanned gap in the spacing of our children; two boys with 10 years between <br/>
them.  It was very hard for us to wait and it appears there will be no more <br/>
children.  We are at the other end of the spectrum, so maybe my thoughts <br/>
might be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest is now married and has a 2 yr old daughter.  We began <br/>
homeschooling when the oldest was in the middle of his 8th grade year, the <br/>
youngest (now 12) has never been to public school (except to visit his <br/>
cousins for lunch &lt;G&gt;).  With a 10 year age gap and so much of our lives <br/>
focused on getting the second child here for so long, there have been a lot <br/>
of disappointments, challenges and joys.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, it was wonderful to have such an age gap once we got our prayers <br/>
answered and had the youngest boy in our family...for one thing we had a <br/>
built in babysitter (not that we left our darlings home much, mind you!  I&#39;m <br/>
afraid we are definitely doting parents toward both our boys).  <br/>
<br/>
We found that the older boy was generally willing to include the younger in <br/>
most of his projects.  In fact, the older son often taught the younger <br/>
something about what he was doing.  I&#39;m convinced it helped the older boy <br/>
learn even more because he was having to explain what he was doing, either to <br/>
convince little brother to leave him alone or to include him in the <br/>
activities.  Either way it became teaching opportunities.  It didn&#39;t take us <br/>
long to figure out it was much easier to simply include all family members <br/>
than to separate ourselves to different activities.  Since sharing time <br/>
together is a very strong priority for our family, that has worked out quite <br/>
nicely.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think either boy is harmed in any way with the age gap.  There have <br/>
been a lot of changes over the last few years with the oldest child striking <br/>
out on his own.  The boys have a close relationship and we have no regrets <br/>
about the difference in their ages.  It&#39;s just part of their (and our) life <br/>
experiences.  Different from the experiences they&#39;d have had if there were <br/>
lots of siblings, but no less significant.  <br/>
<br/>
FWIW, <br/>
