<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774317471">Let&#39;s see...<br/>
<br/>
Once I read about unschooling in the &quot;Homeschooling book of Answers&quot;...I knew <br/>
that was the route for us...It was kinda hard to imagine exactly what or how <br/>
to teach my children...in fact when I looked at the home idea of home <br/>
schooling, choosing curriculums, setting up &#39;academic learning&#39; time...I felt <br/>
kida overwhelmed...<br/>
<br/>
Then I got into the Unschooling Handbook...what the author said makes so much <br/>
sense...I already instill alot of trust in my boys to figure things out on <br/>
their own and to be able to make choices that further thier own interests...<br/>
<br/>
Also I experienced a sense of relief with the idea that I didn&#39;t have to go <br/>
and buy a curriculum...I have made some plans to create a more learning <br/>
encouraged environment in my den/home office space...I keep my sewing machine <br/>
there but soon that will be moved to my bedroom...(it was in my bedroom when <br/>
I lived in a two bedroom apt...)  I am moving a sofa and loveseat to the den <br/>
and adding some bookshelves...and I wanted to get some books that are more <br/>
like reference books rite now...such as a basic math book...that can help me <br/>
and the boys understand what we are learning...not so much a text book...but <br/>
like a how to book...if that makes sense and I also want to get a book on <br/>
grammar that explains all the &#39;rules&#39; so that we can understand them...I had <br/>
one a while back when I did alot of writing and aspired to be a sci fi and <br/>
fantasy author (I have some great ideas)...now I got the APA manual on how to <br/>
write journal articles related to the medical and nursing fields (a <br/>
requirement for college)  now I just want something basic that is easy to <br/>
understand that can answer on the spot questions...as for science and social <br/>
studies and other educational &#39;requirements&#39;...well I don&#39;t feel that there <br/>
is any one book we should have so I plan on acquiring whatever seems <br/>
interesting at the time...there are some field trips planned in the near <br/>
future (especially around paydays) to several of the local bookstores...(wink)<br/>
<br/>
So far the hardest thing has been sharing my computer with the boys...but <br/>
since I have a laptop as well as a pc...that isn&#39;t as hard as I thought it <br/>
would be...<br/>
<br/>
I am having fun and wish that I had gotten the inspiration for this desision <br/>
a year or so ago...but as I place my faith in God...God brings into our life <br/>
what we need when we need it...<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon...the boys again asked...&quot;When does homeschool start?&quot;  so I <br/>
asked<br/>
what is homeschool and we talked about all the things we did in the last few <br/>
days that helped us to learn something new and exciting...I happened to pick <br/>
up a couple of grade appropriate &#39;curriculum&#39; work books at costco and let <br/>
them know that anytime they felt a need to sit down and do &#39;class work&#39; they <br/>
were welcome to...we laughed at that...then they promptly went outside to <br/>
play with friends...it is so nice to have the wieght of ps off our <br/>
shoulders...and I feel like I am getting some quality time with them...I <br/>
always felt that I was competing with ps for thier time...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This letter must be all over the place...I am just excited about unschooling <br/>
and having a forum to share our experiences!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really like the handbooks from Great Source. We have Write Source 2000,<br/>
and there are several others for different ages. I just got Math on Call,<br/>
and it&#39;s a fantastic, easy to read reference for your basic math stuff.<br/>
There&#39;s a book for younger kids called Math at Hand. I&#39;ve seen these at<br/>
bookstores and you can also order directly from the publisher at<br/>
www.greatsource.com.<br/>

shop for $3.  The booshop I go into most often was impressed with my find.<br/>
;)  We have the student sourebooks for 11th and 12th grades as reference<br/>
resources and I really like those.  There are examples of student and<br/>
professional writing in each *style* area.<br/>
