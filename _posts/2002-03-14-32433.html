with anyone..... but most of my own life i have not fit in and then in my <br/>
30&#39;s i realized i didnt want to!!!!!!! SO my kids have wonderful associations <br/>
with my piano/voice students, some neighbors, friends that stop over, <br/>
babysitters who &quot;grew up&quot; with us, restaurant and store people we frequent! <br/>
IT works out!!! !maybe they will find some wonderful people like you to hang <br/>
