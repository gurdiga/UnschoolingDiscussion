<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934243671">I am deeply ill about our US situation, and it is really first and foremost<br/>

About Castro,Yikes, I know lots of Cubans that would beg to differ with your<br/>
philosophy, and they cannot live in their country of birth, because they<br/>
have a difference of opinion. I haven&#39;t traveled to Cuba, so I cannot verify<br/>
this, but I believe that when students are 10, they do not live with their<br/>
families, but in government institutions, schools, so would that be<br/>
acceptable, because it is probably more efferent and would be for the common<br/>
good? Children are not children of the family first, but children of the<br/>
state. Maybe that is where my unschooling/communist confusion comes from.<br/>
 I guess my problem with the rich get richer/poor get poorer cliché is<br/>
this...why are power happy, non family (meaning kids are raised by nannies,<br/>
boarding school, etc) people with an obscene need for material goods<br/>
considered rich? Why are families that are struggling, grateful for little,<br/>
living together considered poor? ( Obviously,I am generalizing in both<br/>
cases, but that line gets abused more often to win votes from people who<br/>
actually live that life and feel guilty; people who are basically jealous<br/>
and deep down feel resentful that if they don&#39;t have that life style- why<br/>
should anyone else?or that  think getting the gold away from the greedy will<br/>
set the world free.<br/>
I hope that I am not coming across in a bitter tone, because that is not<br/>
what I am intending, I lived in Miami and South Florida, so I have heard my<br/>
share of Castro complaints from people who lived under his dictatorship, and<br/>
I guess Julie&#39;s post struck a little nerve, because I am feeling especially<br/>
patriotic right now,and I should be sleeping.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842473251">I have lived in Florida most (not all) of my life. In<br/>
the mid-50s we hid under desks and in hall ways due to<br/>
missile threats from Cuba. When I heard fire-sirens<br/>
for a good while as a middle sized child I would grab<br/>
the water jugs, quilts, and my little brothers and<br/>
sister and head for the closet. To wait for an all<br/>
clear.<br/>
<br/>
I am also old enough to have been acquainted with men<br/>
who fought WITH Che and Castro.  And I am close to<br/>
someone who was a SEAL at the Bay of Pigs.<br/>
<br/>
I was (am) close to men and women who went in the<br/>
early 70s to Cuba to volunteer their work. I have been<br/>
(am) close to men and women who have dedicated their<br/>
lives to organizing migrant workers and factories.<br/>
Mostly though, my closeness is of a human sort, not<br/>
necessarily political. <br/>
<br/>
There aspects of all ideologies that are good. And<br/>
there are aspect of all ideologies that Evil will take<br/>
advantage of. And we are all human. Well, some of us.<br/>
But we must all always be alert to the many aspects<br/>
and intrusions of Evil. Half of the universe is one<br/>
way and the other half is the other way. This is<br/>
always swirling about mixing and separating...all we<br/>
can do is try to provide ourselves and loved ones the<br/>
safest, healthiest arena to grow in. And we owe it to<br/>
Mother Earth to ensure that She is wholesome too. When<br/>
we consider the ideologies to which we subscribe we<br/>
need to consider our Grandchildren and Mother Earth.<br/>
We need to consider do we want our sons and husbands<br/>
and ourselves to be forced by the situation to kill<br/>
people?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still, Castro is an old guy.  What&#39;s next?<br/>

case. Even when I believe in the right of the parent<br/>
and that the father had the right to raise his son<br/>
under any government that he wanted, I had a bad taste<br/>
in my mouth knowing that the son would be taken away<br/>
at age 11.<br/>
