We probably won&#39;t participate in this this year (my son is just 3), but I<br/>
just have to share how much we are enjoying our foray into bird feeding!<br/>
<br/>
First, we spent 1/2 a day going from store to store to find feeders and seed<br/>
and posts and suet, etc.  Lots of newness there!<br/>
<br/>
Then, we got to open all the feeder boxes and put together the post.  Sam<br/>
even got to use the electric drill with my husband--so much fun!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, it was time to get everything outdoors and WAIT!<br/>
<br/>
The next morning Sam&#39;s first words were, &quot;Let&#39;s go see if any birds are at<br/>
our feeders!&quot; and he lept from the bed to go check!<br/>
<br/>
It has taken a while for the birds to come regularly, but it is happening.<br/>
Now we&#39;ve had a bit of snow and there is more activity.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we had a male cardinal, and last night we had a BUNNY!  That was<br/>
really cool!<br/>
<br/>
A neighbor gave us a Coleman Bird Sound thing (insert a card into the<br/>
mechanism and pick a bird to hear its song)--Sam spent several minutes<br/>
listening to the Cardinal&#39;s song this morning, and figuring out how to make<br/>
the machine repeat, rather than cycle through all the birds.<br/>
<br/>
So much fun, so much learning!  Don&#39;t even get me started on our new Worm<br/>
Composting Bin!! : )<br/>

I printed out the tally sheets today and have a Birds of Michigan book <br/>
that I&#39;m pretty familiar with.  *I* am excited about doing it and <br/>
haven&#39;t even mentioned it to my kids yet.  I likely will a day or so <br/>
prior to the event, and they might be really into it (they&#39;re 5 and <br/>
almost 4) but they might not be and that&#39;s totally cool too.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m saying is that your DS might be a little guy and not <br/>
interested in counting birds with you, but -you- could do it for you if <br/>
it sounds like fun!  :)<br/>

<br/>
We did it two years ago, and plan to do it again this year with the 4-H <br/>
Gardening club I lead, and we&#39;ll compare results within the club. We&#39;ve <br/>
already talked about it and the kids are looking forward to it and <br/>
already beginning to count. When we did it last time, it was great <br/>
because we had a big snow storm on the days of the count. The birds were <br/>
out in *full force*!<br/>
<br/>
My kids had lots of fun counting the birds, and they can identify all <br/>
kinds of different birds because it&#39;s an ongoing thing with us. We&#39;re <br/>
lucky enough to have *lots* of birds visit our feeders, and, <br/>
unfortunately, an occasional hawk who also got one of my chickens. <br/>
Grrrrr, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother story.<br/>
<br/>
They also had lots of fun checking out the results when they came out.<br/>

LOL  I actually wrote &quot;should&quot; first, but then wrote &quot;could&quot; instead.  <br/>
I didn&#39;t want to give anyone a &quot;have to&quot; in my post.  ;&#39;)  But, yeah, <br/>
if it sounds fun . . . do it for YOU!  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do it! I count birds for the Backyard Bird Count. This is my second year and its my thing <br/>
that the kids are slowly encroaching on. :) They yell, &quot;Mom come quick, it&#39;s a Carolina <br/>
wren. Be sure to write that down.&quot; It&#39;s a blast.<br/>
<br/>
I have one son who became so absorbed in my love for birds that he is now a birder, <br/>
himself. For Christmas, he got his own pair of binoculars. Not all my kids love birds to the <br/>
degree I do, but one of them now does. And I don&#39;t care anyway because *I* love birds!<br/>
<br/>
So yes, I do think living your interests is modeling, though I certainly don&#39;t do the Bird <br/>
Watch with the ulterior goal of modeling anything. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203841627">I feed birds in the front and the back, but I don&#39;t watch them eat.  I figure they need their privacy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have sparrows and doves.  Kinda boring.  But that&#39;s okay.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I would watch them eat more if I didn&#39;t always forget.  I remember to feed them, but I forget to look later. <br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t see the nests, and so though I know in the spring we have lots of nesting birds, we have evergreens and I never see the nests.  <br/>
