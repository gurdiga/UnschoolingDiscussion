I live near Albany, NY and the conference is not too far from here.  I am <br/>
considering attending this year but have never attended a homeschool <br/>
conference <br/>
before and am wondering if the Live & Learn Conference is always in the same <br/>
place or does it move around the country?  My son is not yet school age and <br/>
I&#39;m <br/>
trying to decide if I should go this year while it is close by before I lose <br/>
my chance at having it only a few hours away.  I am also thinking of going to <br/>
the New England Homeschool & Family Learning Conference (not strictly <br/>
unschooling), has anyone been to this before?<br/>
******************<br/>
Oh, do come! The last couple of years it was in SC, this year in MA. Don&#39;t <br/>
know whether it will happen again. <br/>
<br/>
I, with my son, have been to the conference in Boxborough. It&#39;s VERY schooly, <br/>
with all kinds of curriculum vendors. They do a couple nods to unschooling, <br/>
sometimes. It&#39;s also very Christian, although they don&#39;t claim to be.<br/>
<br/>
The same people publish a homeschooling newspaper. This last issue had an <br/>
anti-feminist article by Phyllis Schlafly in it.<br/>
