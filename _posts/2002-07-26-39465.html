<div id="ygrps-yiv-980097691">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to (re)introduce myself because I keep wanting to talk here but not <br/>
without introducing myself.  I&#39;m Pam from Albany, CA (next to Berkeley) and I <br/>
used to participate in the AOL unschooling boards back in about 1995 or 96, <br/>
so I remember many of you.  I&#39;m glad to see so many of you have stuck with <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
I never stopped unschooling but I did pretty much stop using my computer <br/>
(while the rest of the world started doing nothing but...)  I&#39;m not sure why <br/>
- my mom died, we moved, I had another kid, my husband monopolized the <br/>
computer - but anyway, I&#39;m back because I needed the support and found the <br/>
time.  It doesn&#39;t seem like there are many unschoolers in Berkeley, which it <br/>
surprising, huh?<br/>
<br/>
My kids are Sam, 8, and Nico, 3.  My husband Eric lost his job this month and <br/>
we are contemplating a move to Pennsylvania which is hecka scary to me, <br/>
native Californian.  Especially when I looked up the PA homeschooling laws.  <br/>
Are any of you unschoolers in PA?   I&#39;m wondering how you deal with those <br/>
laws.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628286268">Hi Pam!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an unschooler in PA...and, well, it can be a<br/>
challenge, but we&#39;ve managed. In the absence of<br/>
&quot;output&quot;:). I collect lots of brochures, take lots of<br/>
photos, keep an extensive list of &quot;resources&quot;..books,<br/>
games, tv shows, cd&#39;s, etc. And finding a supportive<br/>
evaluator always helps. (And finding lots of support<br/>
at the end of the year when we have to turn our stuff<br/>
in to the superintendent..I always have great anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my unschooling sister-in-law lives in<br/>
Santa Cruz...maybe you can chat!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
 Gina<br/>
<br/>
PS..I have a Niko, too...he&#39;s 6!<br/>
