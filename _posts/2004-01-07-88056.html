&lt;&lt; I would love to hear from anyone who has teenagers who are unschooling who <br/>
are doing cool things. They need not to be terrified of speaking in public, <br/>
and <br/>
need to be planning to attend the Unschooling Conference in August <br/>
(www.LiveandLearnConference.org) .  I have PLANS... &gt;&gt;<br/>

Marty could tell people about ork ball. &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t know that it qualifies <br/>
as a &quot;cool thing&quot; in the way most people want to hear academic or financial <br/>
success.    For a year, though, he&#39;s had kids over every Sunday, usually from 10 <br/>
to 20, to play a game he made up.  Some weeks too few to play are here, and <br/>
they do something different.  But for &quot;socializing,&quot; he&#39;s done much better for <br/>
social opportunity for a bunch of homeschooled teens (a few school kids show up <br/>
sometimes) than any of the parents have managed to do around here.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not too shy, he might just not be the most shining example of success.<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait!  The Jr. Police Academy.   He was a stud there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
