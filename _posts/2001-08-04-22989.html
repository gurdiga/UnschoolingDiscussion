<div id="ygrps-yiv-938222848">Howdy folks, I know many of you have heard part of the saga of our <br/>
neighbors to the South. - How they yelled at us for letting our then <br/>
infant and 2 year old splash naked in a wading pool in our own <br/>
backyard in an inconspicuous spot;  how the mother is publicly <br/>
physically and verbally abusive to her children, even in front of our <br/>
little boys;  how they have a yappy dog that disturbs the peace <br/>
morning, noon and night; how they cuss a blue streak in front of my <br/>
kids or screaming in the street; how the teenager is screaming and <br/>
cavorting in the street with her friends or the mother screaming <br/>
obsceneties (depending on whether they are fighting) at Midnight and <br/>
1 in the morning (with dog barking along LOL.)  <br/>
<br/>
Well here is the latest, and I am just thankful that I am hitting the <br/>
road to WA on Thursday and will not have to live near them anymore.  <br/>
Ever since they moved in they have been watering the South side of <br/>
our house, all the way up to almost the roofline, with their <br/>
sprinklers (mobile, not in ground).  We repeatedly ask them to stop, <br/>
move their sprinklers while they watch, turn them down, etc.  Now <br/>
that we are preparing to sell our home, we may have to repaint the <br/>
south side of our house from the water damage.  Also the windows are <br/>
calcified, covered with mineral deposits and coroding (they are <br/>
metal) from the hard water.  The glass is so covered with hard <br/>
watered stains that you can barely see through any of the windows on <br/>
that side of the house.  We can never leave our windows open there <br/>
and had to move all furniture away from those windows and scrape and <br/>
repaint the window wells from water damage.<br/>
<br/>
Today my husband went over to try to talk to them, as they were <br/>
watering, AGAIN, the South side of our house.  He first spoke to the <br/>
teenage daughter, as her mother was asleep, and she was flippant, <br/>
rude and unreasonable.  Then she went and woke her mother up.  When <br/>
we noticed her outside, my husand tried again to talk to them, saying <br/>
very nicely &quot;Hello...&quot;  which was all he got out of his mouth because <br/>
she proceeded to scream at him.  SO....he called the police.  We <br/>
thought maybe she would listen to an officer.  When he arrived he <br/>
commented that he heard them screaming something and running into the <br/>
house, no doubt because they were angry that we called the police.  <br/>
But what else can we do, short of suing them?  This has been going on <br/>
for over three years now.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the officer talked to her and she gave him some lame excuse <br/>
about the wind blowing water occassionally onto our house.  This is <br/>
obvious baloney, as the height, amount and extent of visable damage <br/>
to our house could not possible by occassional wind blowing stray <br/>
drops.  She is lazy and turns the sprinkler on to above her roof <br/>
peakline in height/pressure, and it waters our house with each pass.  <br/>
(SIGH)<br/>
<br/>
One more reinforcment of why I want to live in community and not <br/>
surrounded by strangers.  I am so sick of this.  We have no recourse, <br/>
short of suing them in a civil suit for destruction of property.  I <br/>
really just want to get out of here and sell this house.  Maybe the <br/>
new owners will have better luck with them.  Thanks for letting me <br/>
vent.<br/>

<br/>
I would take further action before selling the house, and I would let the new <br/>
tenants know the number of social services and the police so they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
think it was a first offense and hesitate a long time before calling.<br/>
<br/>
I would call social services on them, seriously.  And maybe write a letter to <br/>
the police outlining other things so that if the new residents call they <br/>
would have prior reference on file.<br/>

That sounds AWFUL.  Goodness what a nightmare.  I am adamantly opposed to<br/>
frivolous lawsuits, but your situation seems to warrant a day in court.  I<br/>
would consult with an attorney.  I believe the civil laws were put in place<br/>
so that people who cannot be civil (which describes your neighbors) can deal<br/>
with a judge!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

Have you already got your house sold?  This may put a crimp in the sale as<br/>
you will have to do full disclosure which includes ongoing damage sources<br/>
which they are.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d take them to small claims court for property damage and loss of ability<br/>
to enjoy your property.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, hope you find &quot;real&quot; neighbors where you move to!!!!!!<br/>
