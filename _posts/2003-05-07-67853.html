<div id="ygrps-yiv-241271810">Ok, I need some wise words for my sister.......<br/>
<br/>
First of all her children attend school in Utah.<br/>
School in question is Jackling though the issue is the whole district. She <br/>
has four children and have had other issues like teacher changing a grade <br/>
from an A to an F because the child spoke up to the teacher. Anyway<br/>
<br/>
Friday her 11 yr. old daughter came home telling her that because she forgot <br/>
her school photo&#39;s the teacher was making her write 100 X&#39;s &quot;I will not <br/>
forget my pictures again.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So my sister sent a note to the teacher that she will NOT be having her <br/>
daughter write this as she feels it is ridiculous.  The teacher has made a <br/>
few comments that where not very nice but my sister could not prove it was <br/>
directly at her daughter.<br/>
Today she finds out the very same teacher made her daughters entire class <br/>
take their heavy totes out of their desks and walk around and through the <br/>
school three times. Her daughter told her that when she finally put her tote <br/>
down her fingers where purple.<br/>
Isn&#39;t this illegal? Corporal punishment or something?<br/>
She went back to the school after hours and complained to another teacher and <br/>
told them that here sister Homeschools back east and it is looking way better <br/>
than what is happening there. (break through, yes!)<br/>
Now I am walking a fine line with her because she does feel like she could <br/>
not personally HS or if it is even legal. (I have advised her many times it <br/>
is but it is a big step for those who have never tried it)<br/>
Does any one know Utah law? I have looked it up but it looks to be hard to HS <br/>
there.<br/>
Also if any one wants to send me some comments as to what I can say to guide <br/>
her please do.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m in Utah. The laws are a breeze. I notify the school district each <br/>
year that I plan to homeschool. They have me fill out a one page form <br/>
that says I&#39;ll cover 180 days, core subjects, etc. There&#39;s no testing <br/>
and no law about *how* I cover those days or subjects. That&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
Where does your sister live? I didn&#39;t recognize the school district.<br/>

<br/>
She can email me. I&#39;d be happy to answer her questions or just let <br/>
her vent about the schools. I&#39;ll also be happy to give her my <br/>
unschooling slant. ;o) Here&#39;s a good website to give her <br/>
called &quot;Homeschooling in Utah.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I will pass the site on to her.  I have been trying to give her the slant but <br/>
she is a tuff cookie. I knew with her I would have to wait until something <br/>
happened and it has so many times with each child but she didn&#39;t want to <br/>
leave her job.  She is now picking up my old toy business and plans to quit <br/>
so we shall see.<br/>
I know it will happen its just a matter of time. I have two other people that <br/>
we have run into over the past couple years, I usually have a good hunch who <br/>
will and who will not. They both have taken their children out. One is school <br/>
on line at home and the other is just beginning the Unschooling/Deschool <br/>
path.<br/>
My younger sister (20 yr. old) who attended Private Catholic schools all her <br/>
life has given me flack the past couple years about putting him back in <br/>
school and clean my house (her words).<br/>
 They funny thing is after thousands of dollars in Private education she cant <br/>
pass the Marine Corps ASVAB. I took it right after her because she kept <br/>
saying it has gotten harder and I by far past her score. I told her I know <br/>
the answers from teaching my self not some school. <br/>
As for my sister in Utah, just the mention of me and homeschooling (she <br/>
doesn&#39;t know the dif)and her telling the school she is considering it was <br/>
wonderful it has taken two years for that alone.<br/>
I will talk with her she just might want to hear it from someone else other <br/>
than me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank  you,<br/>

She is going after the school district now. They had another situation <br/>
yesterday. Its war now! LOL Good someone has to do it. I would be concerned <br/>
if she just packed up and left without fighting the system and left it to the <br/>
next poor child.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again,<br/>
