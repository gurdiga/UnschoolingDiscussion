<div id="ygrps-yiv-28530927">hi glenda in OK,<br/>
don&#39;t worry, you are in the right place!!!<br/>
my son, 12, out of ps for 2 years, has only recently<br/>
begun to attend to his personal grooming in the way<br/>
that i would like.<br/>
the tooth brushing is a health issue, you might try<br/>
what I did, take him to the dentist for a teeth<br/>
cleaning, which he found so painful it gave me<br/>
leverage to get him to brush his teeth.<br/>
I think I did force my son to trade in dirty clothes<br/>
for clean ones about once a month. same with the ants<br/>
in his bedroom, I insisted in vacuuming up the crumbs<br/>
every so often.<br/>
but I see the whole problem as related to his<br/>
deppression. I&#39;m new to this list, but I see having<br/>
honest discussions with him about how I authentically<br/>
feel about him to be part of unschooling (example:<br/>
&quot;get your stinky feet out of my face!!! p.u.! boy,<br/>
smelling like that, you&#39;ll definitely be stuck at home<br/>
with me for your whole life, because only your mother<br/>
can love you like that!&quot;) obviously one does not make<br/>
comments like this when he is really down, but waits<br/>
till the right moment.<br/>
deppression can sometimes take a long time to heal,<br/>
especially after you finally dump the drugs, the<br/>
school, the dad, everything that wasn&#39;t working, and<br/>
get cozy at home together. I saw it as a second<br/>
infancy with my son.<br/>
don&#39;t worry, there is light at the end of the tunnel.<br/>
