<div id="ygrps-yiv-733580261">Elana mentioned something about student loans.  Now that puts another twist to the thread.  A degree is one thing but racking up high student loans for the darned thing is not a good idea unless you are talking about something like medical school where you have no other choice.  I was listening to something on NPR the other day and they were talking about there being a problem with people on Medicaid not being able to get dental care.  They said dentists would not take a patient that could only pay what Medicaid offered because of the $200,000 worth of student loans on top of the money it costs to set up a practice.  That is ridiculous!<br/>

Hi there,<br/>
Not wanting to sound like my older, more confident, can handle it all older<br/>
sister.....Please check the stories &quot;shared&quot; by co-workers, friends and yes,<br/>
even e-list friends. www.truthorfiction.com is an excellent free place to<br/>
check the story prior to posting it or forwarding it to friends. I<br/>
unfortunately, have often been the person forwarding the story on our of<br/>
concern for family, friends etc. The gel candle, it is on there, please<br/>
check it out for yourselves.<br/>
As for the college degree...my dh has bachelors, masters and CPA, he is<br/>
unemployed since November. The degrees mean nothing when searching for a job<br/>
to keep our home and putting food on the table. The best we have going for<br/>
us right now is my doggy boarding business and his &quot;experience&quot; 17 years of<br/>
hard work will pay off, whereas we just paid off his student loans three<br/>
years ago. just a thought.<br/>

$50,0000 - that&#39;s and interesting number.  Did you mean $50,000 or $500,000?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181315923">Alrighty, flame proof suit on here &lt;g&gt;  How about if we started cutting the<br/>
price for our students to go to medical school instead of giving folks from<br/>
other countries a FREE medical school education!  Yes, FREE!<br/>
<br/>
Also, one way out of the high expense is to work in a rural community and<br/>
have your loans &quot;forgiven.&quot;  Unfortunately, the &quot;average&quot; U.S. medical<br/>
student doesn&#39;t want to &quot;work for free [they are paid but not very much] for<br/>
a bunch of poor people&quot; and that is a quote from one student that was<br/>
interviewed!<br/>
<br/>
There are rural communites that are advertising for doctors.  They are<br/>
willing to pay the insurance, set them up in practice and even take on some<br/>
of their student loan burden!  NO ONE is applying!<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to dentists.  It doesn&#39;t cost them anything near as much as a doc<br/>
unless they are going into orthodontic surgery speciality!  Further, they<br/>
actually charge more than medical doctors and their insurance rates are<br/>
lower.<br/>
<br/>
Quite honestly and unfortunately, I think a lot of doctors and dentists are<br/>
just plain greedy!<br/>

their citizens&#39; education. A student from Germany, for example, can go to<br/>
university for a very low cost and their gov&#39;t will pay the cost of<br/>
tuition no matter where they go to school, even if that student attends<br/>
school in the US. I could be wrong, though.<br/>

We have hosted several foreign exchange students.  One of them, a boy from<br/>
Macedonia, lived with us for high school and then came back outside the<br/>
exchange program and lived with us for two years of college.  He started at<br/>
a community college and after getting an Associate&#39;s Degree last spring,<br/>
started at the University of Oklahoma this fall.  We love him and he&#39;s a<br/>
terrific young man...and very smart.<br/>
<br/>
He paid for his first year at Community College, but during that next year<br/>
one of his honors professors was really impressed by him and asked him if he<br/>
could APPLY FOR A SCHOLARSHIP ON HIS BEHALF.  He didn&#39;t have to do a<br/>
thing--the professor filled it all out and all he did was sign his name.<br/>
<br/>
He got that Regents Scholarship that paid for his last year at community<br/>
college and full tuition, books, and quite a few living expenses for his<br/>
next 3 years at the U. of OK.  He&#39;ll be able to finish his bachelor&#39;s degree<br/>
and one year of his master&#39;s degree on that scholarship.<br/>
<br/>
And before he&#39;d finished one semester at OU, he got an internship (through<br/>
the university, but at a private company) and they&#39;ve already asked him to<br/>
stay on until he graduates....at which time he&#39;s hoping/planning that they<br/>
will pay for his master&#39;s program.  (His degree will be in business or<br/>
finance.)<br/>
<br/>
Now.....this guy is a *wonderful* guy--part of our family--and has *all* it<br/>
takes to be very successful in life.  But it does still bug me just a bit<br/>
that he&#39;s getting all this money for college when he or his parents haven&#39;t<br/>
paid a penny in state or federal taxes.  (His earning are tax-exempt...at<br/>
least they were last year.)  Here I am worried (when I think about it!)<br/>
about how I&#39;m going to pay for college for my 3 and he&#39;s going to college<br/>
for free.<br/>
<br/>
I can look at the flip side, too.....Macedonia is a struggling economy in<br/>
the midst of a very unstable region.  Helping this young man now may make a<br/>
difference to their economy--and ours--in the future.  And, no matter where<br/>
he&#39;s from, he is a deserving young man and will give back much to society.<br/>
Still....<br/>
<br/>
I also place foreign exchange students, so I&#39;ve worked with dozens over the<br/>
last few years.  I can tell you that almost *EVERYWHERE* (but particularly<br/>
in poorer countries), they have a misconception that they can come to the US<br/>
and get a free college education.  It&#39;s really not true.  I have seen<br/>
several kids who *did* get a free education, but it really is *not* easy.<br/>
The kids who come are often (not always) outstanding kids, so sometimes they<br/>
can get scholarships for particular things they&#39;re good at.  But WAY more<br/>
often they find that it&#39;s just not that easy.  Unfortunately, one story<br/>
about a kid like our Macedonian exchange student really makes the rounds<br/>
&quot;back home&quot; and the story grows with each telling.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Probably a dozen of his friends came here the same year he did intending to<br/>
go to college in the US.  Two of them are still here, but neither of them<br/>
was able to get any money at all for college.  The others gave up when they<br/>
found out that college wasn&#39;t free and/or they were too homesick to stay.<br/>
One friend still has delusions that he&#39;s going to work for Bill Gates and<br/>
&quot;get rich quick&quot;.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Pat, I place German students all the time and I don&#39;t think its true that<br/>
their country will pay for them to go to college here....at least I&#39;ve never<br/>
heard of it and don&#39;t personally know any German exchange students who went<br/>
to college here.  Their country won&#39;t even pay for all of them to go to<br/>
college--in fact, in most other countries college is free only to the very<br/>
few &quot;smartest&quot; kids and quite expensive for the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to write about the Macedonian public school system for you all.<br/>
I will later today or tomorrow.  It&#39;s very interesting and an improvement in<br/>
many ways to what we have here.  More later on that!<br/>

pay for a student&#39;s education with the understanding that they<br/>
will return to their country and help.  The understanding was<br/>
just that - and so many would stay here so they could get<br/>
money rather than helping out.  I think a lot of those<br/>
loopholes have been closed now.<br/>
<br/>
I know when I was a student at UC Santa Cruz, there was a concern<br/>
about sending so many application packages overseas.  It cost a<br/>
lot of money (&gt;$10) and the state was paying that cost.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know what solution was used or if it&#39;s still the same now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-809945250">I&#39;ve been swamped getting my daughter enrolled at the local communist <br/>
college and not able to keep up with the mail, so excuse me if I repeat <br/>
anything...yes even my own messages.  Guess I had better review them<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My daughter left a couple of weeks ago, at 16.  Yesterday she began her <br/>
first art class at the college, and how wonderful it was that the people <br/>
worked with us.  They allowed her into a class for art majors and <br/>
matriculated students.  These people bent over backwards.<br/>
<br/>
There are some programs, one is called &quot;The Ability to Benefit Program,&quot; <br/>
for people who really need their child to have a HS diploma...they can go <br/>
to HS and college AT THE SAME TIME.  I don&#39;t have the information, yet, on <br/>
that, frankly, I&#39;m kind of hoping she doesn&#39;t look back at HS and just <br/>
applies for the GED once she reaches the required 24 (or 25) college <br/>
credits.  Her plan at this time is to go to art school, and according tot <br/>
he college catalogue and their program for her specialty, she needs <br/>
precious little of what high school has.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I am very pleased with how wonderful the people up there have <br/>
been.  It&#39;s been a rough few months with the depression and resulting <br/>
chaos, but being free of school has changed her outlook a great deal.<br/>
