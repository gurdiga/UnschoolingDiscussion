Advocates say smoking is precursor of drug use<br/>

VESTAVIA HILLS, Ala. - Breath mints won&#39;t cut it anymore for students who <br/>
have been smoking in the bathroom; schools around the country are <br/>
administering urine tests to teen-agers to find out whether they have been <br/>
using tobacco.<br/>
<br/>
Opponents say such testing violates students&#39; rights and can keep them out <br/>
of the extracurricular activities they need to stay on track. But some <br/>
advocates say smoking is a ticket to more serious drug use.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some addicted drug users look back to cigarettes as the start of it all,&quot; <br/>
said Jeff McAlpin, director of marketing for EDPM, a Birmingham <br/>
drug-testing company.<br/>
<br/>
Short of catching them in the act, school officials previously had no way <br/>
of proving that students had been smoking.<br/>
<br/>
Testing students for drugs has spread in recent years and was given a boost <br/>
in June when the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed random testing of those in <br/>
extracurricular activities. Tobacco can easily be added to the usual <br/>
battery of tests.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I agree with it,&quot; said 16-year- old Vestavia Hills High School junior <br/>
Rosemary Stafford, a member of the marching band. &quot;It&#39;s illegal, it&#39;s <br/>
addictive. Maybe the punishment shouldn&#39;t be as severe, but they should <br/>
test for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In Alabama, where the legal age for purchasing and smoking tobacco products <br/>
is 19, about a dozen districts, mostly in the Birmingham area, test for <br/>
nicotine along with alcohol and illegal drugs, including marijuana.<br/>
<br/>
In most cases, the penalties for testing positive for cotinine - a <br/>
metabolic byproduct that remains in the body after smoking or chewing <br/>
tobacco - are the same as those for illegal drugs: The student&#39;s parents <br/>
are notified and he or she is usually placed on school probation and <br/>
briefly suspended from sports or other activities.<br/>
<br/>
Alabama&#39;s Hoover school system randomly tested 679 of its 1,500 athletes <br/>
for drug use this past school year. Fourteen high school students tested <br/>
positive, 12 of them for tobacco.<br/>
<br/>
Schools in Blackford County, Ind., test for tobacco use in athletes, <br/>
participants in other extracurricular activities and students who take <br/>
driver&#39;s education or apply for parking permits.<br/>
<br/>
In Lockney, Texas, a federal judge recently struck down the district&#39;s <br/>
testing of all students for the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco.<br/>
<br/>
In Columbia County, Fla., the school board will vote today on a testing <br/>
policy that would include tobacco. Teen-agers who take part in <br/>
extracurricular activities or apply for permits to drive to school would be <br/>
screened.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tobacco does and will affect a larger majority of the students than <br/>
alcohol or drugs,&quot; said Gloria Spizey, the county&#39;s coordinator for Safe <br/>
and Drug-Free Schools. &quot;Tobacco use can be devastating. We felt it needed <br/>
to stand with the other drugs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Screenings can detect cotinine for up to 10 days in regular smokers of <br/>
about a half-pack, or 10 cigarettes, a day, McAlpin said. Experts say it is <br/>
unlikely that cotinine would collect in people exposed to secondhand smoke.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tobacco is illegal for them to have - it&#39;s also a health and safety <br/>
issue,&quot; said Phil Hastings, supervisor of safety and alternative education <br/>
for schools in Decatur, Ala., which recently adopted a testing program that <br/>
includes tobacco. &quot;We&#39;ve got a responsibility to let the kids know the <br/>
dangers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While random drug testing overall is being fought by the American Civil <br/>
Liberties Union and students&#39; rights groups, the addition of nicotine <br/>
testing has drawn little opposition.<br/>
<br/>
Shawn Heller, executive director of Students for Sensible Drug Policy in <br/>
Washington, said tobacco use by teen-agers is a major problem, but testing <br/>
for it is just another step in the invasion of students&#39; privacy.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re making schools like prisons,&quot; he said.<br/>
