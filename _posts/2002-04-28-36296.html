&gt; *Ben is mad at Sue because she called him stupid.*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Explain to Ben that Sue is mean and wrong.  Explain<br/>
&gt; that hitting her with<br/>
&gt; the bat doesn&#39;t solve the problem.  Ask Sue not to<br/>
&gt; insult Ben anymore.  If<br/>
&gt; she does, keep her away from Ben.  Compliment Ben so<br/>
&gt; he feels better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *General form: Sue caused Ben distress.*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a serious queston in regards to this situation.<br/>
&gt;  The Statement here &quot; Explain to Ben That Sue is mean<br/>
&gt; and wrong&quot; sounds that it is ok to call Sue names.<br/>
&gt; Sue could have had a reason for calling Ben stupid.<br/>
&gt; He could of pulled her hair or he just showed up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was assuming that the information I gave is the entire situation.  If you<br/>
add new things to the situation the answer will change.  So Ben had not<br/>
done anything wrong to start.  If he had, you need a new solution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes<br/>
&gt; she did cause ben distress, but he obviously caused<br/>
&gt; hers as well. Iwould think a parent would approach him<br/>
&gt; and tell him that sue was angry and she hurt your<br/>
&gt; feelings. Instead of stating that hitting her doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; solve the problem how about stating it doesn&#39;t change<br/>
&gt; what happened. It&#39;s ok to be angry but we cannot beat<br/>
&gt; sue just because he is angry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Am i thinking still in TCS mentality of handiling the<br/>
&gt; situation?  I am really curious.  I do understand that<br/>
&gt; the example where just examples of possible answers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The point of that one was that Sue was to blame.  Ben did nothing wrong.<br/>
So, Sue is acting badly.  Get rid of her if she is bothering Ben.  Find<br/>
nice people.  Critisize Sue&#39;s theories.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents assume if there is a fight that both children did something<br/>
wrong and punish both.  This never solves anything.  I think they&#39;re just<br/>
too lazy to figure it out, or they weren&#39;t paying attention and don&#39;t know<br/>
what happened.<br/>
<br/>
Also, making up examples of reasons for a child to hit another with a bat<br/>
is difficult because its so unrealistic.  Kids don&#39;t do things for no<br/>
reason.  So you&#39;re *actual* problems will be much more reasonable and<br/>
easier to solve.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This I agree with. <br/>
It is sometimes absolutely IMPOSSIBLE for the adult to figure it out though. <br/>
Sometimes there really isn&#39;t &quot;fault&quot; - it is just a true disagreement. <br/>
Sometimes one kid is just having a bad day and, even though it is their <br/>
&quot;fault,&quot; they sure don&#39;t need to be punished. My personal way of handling it, <br/>
oftentimes, is to talk to the kids separately. I get to hear only one side at <br/>
a time, of course, but it just always seems to be useful to get them apart <br/>
and let each kid talk and talk. Once they get it all out, I can often say <br/>
something like, &quot;Is there anything that you&#39;d do differently if you could <br/>
start over?&quot; Sometimes they&#39;re still too angry to think that way and they <br/>
say, &quot;NO!!!&quot; and they jump right back into justifying what they did do. <br/>
Sometimes they can say, &quot;Yeah, I could have....&quot; and they have some idea of a <br/>
different way to have handled whatever horrible thing it is that the other <br/>
kid did. Sometimes the kid can even go so far as to explain to ME how the <br/>
other kid was feeling and why they behaved the way they did. SOMETIMES I only <br/>
get to talk to one kid, because they leave me and go talk, themselves, to the <br/>
other kid and they resolve the problem together. Sometimes I meet with each <br/>
kid, they both are too angry to resolve the problem at that time, and I make <br/>
some kind of temporary decision myself.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, we are getting new chairs in our living room. One of our old chairs <br/>
is the one that I sat in and nursed all three kids -- they LOVE the chair. <br/>
They all want it moved into their room. This morning my 17 yo and my 11 yo <br/>
had a major screaming angry fight over it. I asked them to go to separate <br/>
rooms and I talked, first, to my 11 yo because she seemed most distraught. <br/>
After she &quot;dumped&quot; -- all her anger and frustration was out -- I said, &quot;Well, <br/>
you BOTH really want that chair, do we have ANY possible solutions?&quot; She <br/>
started in on &quot;NO, I want it....&quot; and I said, kind of in an excited tone of <br/>
voice, &quot;Wait --- suppose there was some sort of trade off, maybe something <br/>
she could give you or do for you, that would make you willing to let her have <br/>
the chair. If there was such a thing, what might it be?&quot; She came up with <br/>
maybe half dozen ideas. ONE was that the older kid would pay a $20 deposit <br/>
and then, when the older sister goes off to college (which is going to be in <br/>
a year or so), the chair would be hers. If there was any damage, she&#39;d also <br/>
get to keep the $20. (This is pretty funny, considering this is a grubby old <br/>
worn-out 20-year-old chair, but what she&#39;s worried about is reasonable since <br/>
my older daughter does tend to ruin things - she writes on them, drips candle <br/>
wax on them, dribbles paint on them, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I also thought maybe I&#39;d get the younger one some kind of cool special chair <br/>
- like one of those inflatable kid-size ones - just because she did end up <br/>
without the chair and she did really really want it so it was nice that she <br/>
was even willing to consider an alternative.<br/>

<br/>
When my kid has a problem with another kid, I care about both kids and will <br/>
try to help them both. And that is true whether or not I am responsible for <br/>
the other kid or if their mom is there or not. And caring about the other <br/>
person, too, is what I want to model for my kids. Calling the other kid <br/>
names? Not worrying about the other kid? Talk about adversarial - whew - what <br/>
a way to think. I&#39;m appalled.<br/>

is having a mishap day is not lie.  Explaining a child<br/>
that she is fustrated is acting out is not a lie. <br/>
<br/>
Critisim is a destructive way and saying she is bad. <br/>
One word I do not like to put in the same sentence<br/>
with children.  Ben will learn to criticize otherw<br/>
when he gets older. Critisims leads to no friendships.<br/>
 No one in this world is perfect we have to except<br/>
people for who they are and the mistakes they have<br/>
made and if we can&#39;t we move on. I think this a better<br/>
solution.  Of course this is my opinion. Ithink the<br/>
words your are using can be re phrased.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Her  is thoery on blame.  When we blame others we give<br/>
in to anger instead of excepting and preventing the<br/>
time there is an issue Anger builds fustration<br/>
especially in children because they are still learning<br/>
to control their feelings.  Blaming others is another<br/>
way to feel better.  There are better way than<br/>
blaming.  It can cause a loss of self esteem<br/>
especailly if ben did something wrong because he will<br/>
blame himself. What good is blame if he can&#39;t handle<br/>
the solution. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really thought TCS had something interesting,<br/>
unfortunately it seems that the consequences of the<br/>
issues were not thought out throughly.  For every<br/>
event in our lives it leads to the outcome of an<br/>
adult.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Blame is something many adults suffer<br/>
&gt; &gt; from.  I think it something that hinders society.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No.  Bad theories is something many adults suffer<br/>
&gt; from that hinders<br/>
&gt; society.  These come from coercion.  Hence TCS.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I also think critism is something that hinders<br/>
&gt; society.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How can any knowledge ever grow without criticism? <br/>
&gt; It can&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it OK to criticize murderers and rapists?  Yes. <br/>
&gt; Why?  Because they are<br/>
&gt; immoral.  So it must be OK to criticize other<br/>
&gt; immoral people too, right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The reason I ask is because I thought the purpose<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; TCS was also to produce an everloving peaceful<br/>
&gt; adult<br/>
&gt; &gt; by raising them without coersion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, that is not the purpose.  If the child would<br/>
&gt; like to be an ever-hating<br/>
&gt; war-monger adult that would be eir choice.  TCS<br/>
&gt; parents don&#39;t try to shape<br/>
&gt; their children.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
