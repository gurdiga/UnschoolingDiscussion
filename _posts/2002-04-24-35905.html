<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429708313">We had a funny impromptu spelling/writing moment this morning that I felt <br/>
might be good to share in this thread.<br/>
<br/>
Casey was trying to decide on what to have for lunch. She did this by <br/>
sending me notes via bungie-jumping-Barbie-mail. (Don&#39;t ask!:-D) This is how <br/>
it went.<br/>
<br/>
Casey: I&#39;m hungry. What can I eat (Not bad. She spelled it all right, even <br/>
remembered the apostrophe. Forgot the question mark.)<br/>
<br/>
Me: How about a PB&J or mac and cheese?<br/>
<br/>
Casey: I dont wont PB&J or mac and cheese! (Oops. Forgot the apostrophe this <br/>
time and misspelled want. Used the exclamation point appropriately though.)<br/>
<br/>
Me: Grilled cheese? Pasta? Chicken nuggets? (Hmmm...points off for <br/>
incomplete sentences? I got my point across with the clever use of question <br/>
marks, though.)<br/>
<br/>
Casey: What cind of pasta? (One misspelled word, but note the question mark! <br/>
:o))<br/>
<br/>
Me: Spaghetti or curly pasta. Your choice. (Dang. There are those incomplete <br/>
sentences again. :-/)<br/>
<br/>
Casey: Chicken nuggets and applesose please!<br/>
<br/>
(Casey asked for the correct spelling of &quot;sauce&quot; while she was eating. She <br/>
knew it was wrong, but didn&#39;t know how to make it right. But she did know <br/>
that she needed to combine &quot;apple&quot; with &quot;sauce&quot; to get the compound word of <br/>
applesauce. Although she didn&#39;t know it was called a compound word. Thus she <br/>
got the apple part correct. She also didn&#39;t want to disrupt the flow of our <br/>
little pen and paper discussion to ask for the correct spelling while <br/>
writing. We had a little spelling discussion while eating chicken nuggets <br/>
and talked about compound words and how sauce is spelled and why <br/>
bungie-jumping-Barbies tend to get the dog a bit excitied.)<br/>
<br/>
So this is a kid with no formal or systemized reading or phonics lessons. <br/>
Yet she was able to convey her thoughts in writing pretty clearly. And *I* <br/>
know how much progress she&#39;s made by seeing all those correctly spelled <br/>
words that used to be more inventive.<br/>

What a fabulous example of learning through life events!!  Thanks so much<br/>
for sharing it.  And, by the way, we have bungee-jumping Barbies, teddy<br/>
bears and beanie babies at our house, too.  LOL!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We lived in Japan for a year and speak only a few words of <br/>
Japanese.  We watched television in Japanese and in De Englishu and <br/>
wandered around downtown Kyoto.  We had neighbors who spoke no <br/>
English, so we used big hand signals and a little compact translator <br/>
for the words we couldn&#39;t understand no matter how much we waved.  <br/>
And we didn&#39;t need Japanese to get around.  We could recognize the <br/>
characters on the bus to get home.  Often we would be approached by <br/>
someone who spoke English (once by a kind of scary guy outside <br/>
Takashima shopping center, who frothed a bit at the mouth and <br/>
invited us home with him, we had some reasonable excuse not to go).  <br/>
But we didn&#39;t have complete immersion in the language.  Our day to <br/>
day lives were filled with English.  We lived and my husband worked <br/>
on a campus for foreign researchers in Japan.  We could get American <br/>
news, and Chinese news, and Filipino news, and German news, and <br/>
British news,etc..., on the local channels (it always amazed us, or <br/>
depressed us, I guess, that American news would open with something <br/>
American even when there had been a major international story, like <br/>
the earthquake in India, while everybody else, except, maybe, Russia <br/>
would open with the international story first--and American news <br/>
didn&#39;t even cover the overthrow of the Filipino government...).  If <br/>
Simon had been going to daycare he would have picked up Japanese.  <br/>
And he would have begun to recognize kanji.  If someone had been <br/>
cuddling up to me and reading books to me I would have begun to <br/>
recognize the language, as well.  If there was a need or a desire we <br/>
would have learned Japanese.  But, it is very easy to be <br/>
functionally illiterate, particularly if you have a first language <br/>
to fall back on.  I could still read a novel or a book of folk tales <br/>
or a book on organic gardening in English if I so chose. <br/>
<br/>
I have no recollection of learning to read.  I read before school.  <br/>
No one taught me.  I couldn&#39;t diagram a sentence to save my <br/>
proverbial... and I have a minor in English.  I don&#39;t know why I <br/>
know how to read.  I can remember learning handwriting from my <br/>
mother.  I was changing from an open school that hadn&#39;t taught <br/>
cursive or the times tables to a public school that required both of <br/>
those skills.  We spent the summer writing a story about pioneer <br/>
children in cursive in a Big Chief notebook.  And, apparently, I <br/>
have no memory of this, I learned my times tables overnight.  My <br/>
handwriting is poor.  My understanding of grammer is poor.  I don&#39;t <br/>
need to know grammer rules to know when I&#39;ve written a sentence <br/>
correctly, that&#39;s what Word is for.  I get the little red or green <br/>
wavy line and I know that if I choose I can make a sentence <br/>
correctly, or I can leave it.  So I split infinitives, so I end with <br/>
prepositions, eh, it isn&#39;t going to keep me out of a job or make me <br/>
unhappy.  <br/>
<br/>
But, constantly reminding my son of his inability to read will make <br/>
him unhappy.  Hounding him with phonics, or not coming in and <br/>
reading whatever his gameboy or his computer game is requiring of <br/>
him will also make him unhappy.  He doesn&#39;t need to know the rules <br/>
of phonetics.  He needs attention.  I am not teaching my daughter <br/>
her ABC&#39;s.  They seem to be hampering my son&#39;s understanding of the <br/>
sounds letters make.  I don&#39;t know if it will make a difference.  <br/>
Linnaea wanders around singing &quot;ABCLMOPSTV, now ABC&quot; even without my <br/>
input.  There is no way to demonstrate that trusting your children <br/>
is enough.  My mom, when I asked her what she thought about my <br/>
homeschooling the kids, said &quot;I trust you, even if I wouldn&#39;t do it, <br/>
I trust you.&quot;  If she can trust me to raise my children to adulthood <br/>
than I can trust my children to grow into adulthood.<br/>
