<tt>Hello Eiraul and company,</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>That sounds like what I would like for my kids.</tt>
<br><tt>Mine are thirteen and twelve.&nbsp; The older one was going to
fail for a second time (she ain&#39;t dumb, just slow) and so I took her out
of school when the mom and girls came back two months late from Brazil.</tt>
<br><tt>At first we had a &quot;tutor&quot;,&nbsp; a young French first year university
student to do French with them because neither of us felt competent, we
are but we didn&#39;t feel it, and the next year, we worked out of school books
for French and Maths.&nbsp; This last year we tried the correspondence
course from France, CNED, they got through about three out of twelve lessons,
and looked so much like what we were doing out of text books ourselves,
without costing two hundred bucks a course.</tt>
<br><tt>I have read a number of books about home and unschooing and I am
more and more convinced that that is the way to go.</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>I also like to take articles out of the paper and discuss them.&nbsp;
Discussion is really the way to go.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, this was
confirmed when my wife went to Cali in Colombia and visited the Ruhi Institute
and Fundaec university agricultural institute and she said discussion texts
was the main way of learninng there.&nbsp; They have a technique in which
you read a text, each person asks questions for which the text contains
the answers and another person must reply (is a great and unstressful way
to find out if there is minimal understanding of the text) then you ask
if there are any words you don&#39;t understand and then there are some deeper
questions either to answer in writing or orally.</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>However I will finish with some questions.</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>1. How much freedom do you give the kids?</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>2. In what way do you keep track of what the child had done and
learned?</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>3. How do you stimulate the child to read?</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>4. Have you bought any CDs or books that you would STRONGLY recommend
to others?</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;<tt></tt>

<p><tt>Greetings (from a more and more unschooling oriented homeschooler)</tt>

<p>&gt; I have just recently heard about unschooling, but I have heard so
many
<br>things
<br>&gt; from different people that contradict each other.
<br>&gt;&nbsp; I would also love any advise you may have. Thanks

<br>&gt;

<p>You&#39;re still gonna get a lot of that!&nbsp; (contradictions, I mean)

<p>Essentially (IMO) homeschool is any activity that is education at home
rather
<br>than a traditional school.&nbsp; Well, that isn&#39;t good either.&nbsp;
How about
<br>education directed by the parents/guardians/family and based from home...?
<br>Unschooled is less structure.&nbsp; For some it means no structure
and strictly
<br>child-led.

<p>I avoid grade labeling.&nbsp; At first it was difficult for ds to know
how to
<br>answer when someone asked what grade he was in; he felt like he somehow
<br>didn&#39;t belong because he didn&#39;t have a label like everyone else he
knew.&nbsp; So,
<br>I took opportunities to point out to him when he had just learned something
<br>and say something like &#39;Look!&nbsp; You just counted the correct change
to the
<br>clerk.&nbsp; That counts as our math lesson for the day.&#39;&nbsp; A few
examples and he
<br>started feeling more confident that he was getting enough &#39;school&#39;.

<p>Now when someone asks what grade he&#39;s in, he simply responds that we
<br>homeschool and don&#39;t use grade categories!

<p>He will be 12 in October.&nbsp; He has never been to ps.&nbsp; We have
at times tried a
<br>more structured approach, but always fall off the wagon.&nbsp; I finally
gave
<br>myself permission to decide that our homeschool style was unstructured
and
<br>we&#39;ve done great every since!&nbsp; At first I got real nervous about
the &#39;what if
<br>we miss something&#39; dilemma.&nbsp; But, as time has gone on I see how
silly I was
<br>to be concerned.&nbsp; There is no way to STOP ds from learning!&nbsp;
He explores
<br>things on his own.&nbsp; When I insist on a time table or set curriculum,
I get in
<br>his way.

<p>I still use a text for math, but not for any other subjects.&nbsp; That
may change
<br>in the future, depending on the needs as we go.&nbsp; Even the math
text is used
<br>very loosely.&nbsp; We don&#39;t follow the schedule and will do a lot
of on again,
<br>off again work.&nbsp; It often depends on the weather!&nbsp; If it&#39;s
dreary outside (or
<br>too hot!) we&#39;ll do more inside things which may include the math text.

<p>As for assessments...I rely on conversations with my child.&nbsp; I
can clearly
<br>tell he understands use of the English language, for instance (or at
least
<br>our Americanized version!).&nbsp; He often comes to me with a theory
he has come
<br>up with about xyz which will lead to exploration to discover if he
is
<br>correct.&nbsp; It truly amazes me what I can learn about my child by
just talking
<br>and sharing with him.

<p>We read a lot aloud and silently.&nbsp; I have him read to me as well
as my
<br>reading to him.&nbsp; Family reading time leads to great discussions
and lets me
<br>know how well he is understanding what he reads and the world around
him.
<br>The questions he asks as we are reading are great clues.&nbsp; For
instance, the
<br>reading might have the word &#39;racism&#39; in it; he has difficulty pronouncing
the
<br>word, so we sound it out; then he asks what it means and it leads to
a
<br>discussion.&nbsp; Now, the next time we run into that topic, we&#39;ll
have a
<br>different discussion and I can tell he&#39;s learned from one time to another.

<p>As for nouns, verbs, etc.&nbsp; As far as I&#39;m concerned an 8 yr old
has no need to
<br>worry about such things.&nbsp; If he can instinctively put together
decent
<br>sentence structure, who cares whether he knows how many nouns, verbs,
<br>adverbs, adjectives, etc., were used in the sentence.

<p>Best real life use I&#39;ve ever had for such information was a fill-in-the
blank
<br>story game asking me to list nouns, verbs, etc., which were then put
into a
<br>story line.&nbsp; Very humorous and lots of fun, but hardly an essential
life
<br>skill.
