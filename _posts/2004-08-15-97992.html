<div id="ygrps-yiv-904311547">Ugh!  Sorry, I don&#39;t seem to be able to do links today.  Anyway, the <br/>
book is called What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and <br/>
Literacy [Published in English] <br/>
by James Paul Gee.  You could look it up on Amazon easily if you&#39;re <br/>
interested.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read it, but it looks interesting. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did read this book (got it from the library) ~ Jake even *stole* it <br/>
from me and read some, too.  It was a while ago...what I can remember <br/>
about it was really good...I especially liked what it said about <br/>
violent video games.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we just got the new 2005 Time For Kids Almanac ~ I HIGHLY <br/>
recommend these books, btw ~ but Jake bookmarked a page for me to <br/>
read ~ &quot;Computer and the Internet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
An excerpt:  &quot;Many parents and teachers think kids&#39; instant messaging <br/>
habits are taking away from more important things.  &lt;&lt;&lt;my note:  like <br/>
homework, of course!&gt;&gt;...Researchers who study kids and the internet <br/>
say instant messaging isn&#39;t getting in the way of real life.  They <br/>
note that new technology often triggers old, exaggerated fears...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The following page also has a wonderful Computer, Internet, Video-<br/>
Game Timeline (and I LOVE timelines!).<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

<br/>
I have this book - its good. Not a light read! <br/>
<br/>
Gee is a Professor of Education and he talks about how he was sure that video games were not good for literacy - until he started playing them with his 5 year old son. That prompted his book and research - he discusses successful learning models and how video games meet all these criteria. <br/>
<br/>
In the last chapter he slams the low and high education argument - you know, that books are of high educational quality and video games are not.  Gee says this is not true, given his research, and that it is often a way of some in society putting down others .He writes of leaners seeing connections and getting what they need from all resources....Leonie<br/>

Tying this into the conference ... I&#39;ll be mentioning him in my talk! &lt;g&gt;  I<br/>
have the book on my to buy list (our library system doesn&#39;t have it -<br/>
surprise) but I have read an article he wrote along the same lines.  And I<br/>
have seen what he talks about in action with my 12yo son.<br/>
