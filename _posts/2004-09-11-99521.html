<div id="ygrps-yiv-136551">We store them in those Iris rolling drawer carts - we have all of our <br/>
supplies in two 7 - drawer carts (oh, and one or two of the bookshelves <br/>
next to them for art paper and a nearby triple cupboard - okay, I used <br/>
to have an entire storage room full of drawers and shelves plus the <br/>
shelves we used in our &quot;school room&quot; (mess room), so I&#39;ve really <br/>
whittled it down!!)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a toddler, so that isn&#39;t an issue with us - but with the <br/>
rolling carts, you could either turn them around or roll them into a <br/>
closet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543565590">We use a hardware storage box for the little things like, beads, foam <br/>
cutouts, paperclips, rocks, stickers, bells, wire, plastic lacing, <br/>
googly eyes....  It&#39;s one of those that has about 40 drawers of <br/>
different sizes.  They have smaller and larger units (20-70 drawers) <br/>
if you need more drawers, but I would suggest getting one that has <br/>
small, med and large drawers in the unit so you have a bigger variety <br/>
of storage options.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943867498">I have our art supplies stored in two places.  Inside, I have a big Ikea<br/>
unit that has 25 cubbies (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://makeashorterlink.com/?R31152849)">http://makeashorterlink.com/?R31152849)</a>.  In here<br/>
I have most of our art stuff:  each girls&#39; handiwork baskets (knitting,<br/>
weaving), their scrapbook baskets, play dough, unfinished projects, pencils,<br/>
crayons, markers, colored paper, coloring books, stamps, watercolor stuff,<br/>
felt, pipe cleaners.<br/>
<br/>
In the garage, I have a big round kid table and on shelves nearby, 6<br/>
bankers&#39; boxes filled with messy art goodies.  Paint (dry, tempura, finger,<br/>
fabric, do-a-dot), clay, glue, paint stamp things, things to glue (yarn,<br/>
buttons, etc.).  Basically anything that would ruin the carpet is out here.<br/>
<br/>
Having two areas for the art has been great for us.  It is helpful in our<br/>
family to have enough space so that the kids can play together or spread out<br/>
when they feel the need.<br/>
