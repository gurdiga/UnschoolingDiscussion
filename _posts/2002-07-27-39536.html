<br/>
Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t work in schools where kids had no choice to just walk out, or where <br/>
teachers could just wait two or three years, trusting that the kids would get <br/>
interested in something.  Even with open classroom practices in ideal <br/>
situations, teachers were expected to show that the child had put in time <br/>
(good phrase from an earlier discussion) on each state-required area.  Kids <br/>
were expected to put time in at each &quot;interest center&quot; or whatever they were <br/>
calling their little labs and cozies.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling took the principles the school reformers were espousing in <br/>
the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s and we can show that they DO work and those guys WERE <br/>
right, but the kid has to have more freedom and less artificiality.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what it looks like to me, anyway.<br/>

It was proven to work in lab schools, with teachers who wanted it to work, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90803167">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am delurking big time for a moment of geekatude.<br/>
<br/>
Everytime I start writing a reply to the Phonics thread I stop and <br/>
now I know why. It dawned on me just now that you are not talking <br/>
about Phonetics but of something else. A lot of these terms are <br/>
actually more of a US thing, so my question is, am I to assume that <br/>
Phonics is Phonetics without a context?<br/>
<br/>
Spanish is my native language. I grew up in Puerto Rico where I <br/>
learned English alongside Spanish. I do not know how the techniques <br/>
of ESOL have changed but I can say that, while I was in school there, <br/>
we learned everything based on three principles: Phonetics, Etymology <br/>
and Ortography. This is how Spanish has always been taught, even in <br/>
this country. I cannot imagine learning a language any other way.<br/>
<br/>
How can you learn what a word sounds like without knowing why; <br/>
especially in a country like the US, where regional accents can <br/>
boondoggle drastically a word&#39;s original sound? If Phonics is indeed <br/>
Phonetics without a context, I can see why all the craziness. It does <br/>
not mean that a child has to sit down everyday and do academic work. <br/>
It means, though, that, when learning a new word, if you do not know <br/>
why it is spelled a certain way, just get your dictionary out and <br/>
find the reason for it. This usually clarifies the sounds and <br/>
spellings of words.<br/>
<br/>
It also is a cool game of sleuthing. My brother and I would spend <br/>
hours just going through dictionaries trying to find as many links <br/>
between Spanish and English words as we could find. And once I <br/>
learned other languages (French and Portuguese), it has turned into a <br/>
life long obsession. Let&#39;s take the word JOURNAL, for example. This <br/>
is what I found on Yahoo! American Heritage Dictionary:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;journal<br/>
&gt;SYLLABICATION:	jour·nal<br/>
&gt;PRONUNCIATION:	AUDIO: jûrnl     KEY<br/>
&gt;NOUN:<br/>
&gt;1a. A personal record of occurrences, experiences, and reflections <br/>
&gt;kept on a regular basis; a diary. b. An official record of daily <br/>
&gt;proceedings, as of a legislative body. c. Nautical A ship&#39;s log.<br/>
&gt;2. Accounting a. A daybook. b. A book of original entry in a <br/>
&gt;double-entry system, listing all transactions and indicating the <br/>
&gt;accounts to which they belong.<br/>
&gt;3. A newspaper.<br/>
&gt;4. A periodical presenting articles on a particular subject: a <br/>
&gt;medical journal.<br/>
&gt;5. The part of a machine shaft or axle supported by a bearing.<br/>
&gt;ETYMOLOGY:	Middle English, breviary, from Old French, daily, <br/>
&gt;breviary, from Late Latin diurnlis, daily. See diurnal.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now, as a child, up to #5 I would get excited because this would <br/>
explain the Spanish words JORNAL [hor-nal] which means day job, and <br/>
JORNADA [hor-nada] which means day trip. But once I learned French I <br/>
got easily the meanings of the words JOUR, JOURNEE, JOURNAL just by <br/>
looking at them and guessing ---I already knew what their English and <br/>
Spanish cousins meant.  Then came Portuguese and JORNAL was not a <br/>
problem. Still, check at the etymological explanation. How can the <br/>
root of JOURNAL be DIURNAL? When did that D turn into a J? Call me a <br/>
geek but here I go:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;diurnal<br/>
&gt;SYLLABICATION:	di·ur·nal<br/>
&gt;PRONUNCIATION:	AUDIO: d-ûrnl     KEY<br/>
&gt;ADJECTIVE:<br/>
&gt;1. Relating to or occurring in a 24-hour period; daily.<br/>
&gt;2. Occurring or active during the daytime rather than at night: <br/>
&gt;diurnal animals.<br/>
&gt;3. Botany Opening during daylight hours and closing at night.<br/>
&gt;NOUN:<br/>
&gt;1. A book containing all the offices for the daily canonical hours <br/>
&gt;of prayer except matins.<br/>
&gt;2. Archaic a. A diary or journal. b. A daily newspaper.<br/>
&gt;ETYMOLOGY:	Middle English, from Late Latin diurnlis, from Latin <br/>
&gt;diurnus, from dis, day. See dyeu- in Appendix I.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, OK. So we see the meaning of diurnal but still have no idea why <br/>
the change from D to J. But, WAIT! There is that etymology key at the <br/>
end. So it is not just a D sound but a DY sound. Now, I did not know <br/>
this was the YOD of Romance languages until I was studying to be a <br/>
Spanish language teacher, STILL, as a kid, I would have killed to <br/>
have had a computer that would have given me this kind of information <br/>
so fast. This would have meant that I would have had to wait until I <br/>
could get to a public library and look into a historical dictionary. <br/>
Now, with the web, it is so easy, so here I go again:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Appendix I<br/>
&gt;Indo-European Roots<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;ENTRY:	dyeu-<br/>
&gt;DEFINITION:	To shine (and in many derivatives, &quot;sky, heaven, <br/>
&gt;god&quot;). Zero-grades *dyu- and *diw-.<br/>
&gt;Derivatives include Tuesday, divine, jovial, Jupiter, diary, dismal, <br/>
&gt;journey, and psychedelic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I. Basic form *dyeu-, Jove, the name of the god of the bright sky, <br/>
&gt;head of the Indo-European pantheon. 1. Jove, jovial; Sangiovese, <br/>
&gt;from Latin Iovis, Jupiter, or Iov-, stem of Iuppiter, Jupiter. 2. <br/>
&gt;July, from Latin Ilius, &quot;descended from Jupiter&quot; (name of a Roman <br/>
&gt;gens), from derivative *iou-il-. 3. Vocative compound *dyeu-pter, &quot;O <br/>
&gt;father Jove&quot; (*pter-, father; see pter-). Jupiter, from Latin <br/>
&gt;Iuppiter, Ipiter, head of the Roman pantheon. 4. Dione, Zeus; <br/>
&gt;dianthus, Dioscuri, from Greek Zeus (genitive Dios), Zeus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;II. Noun *deiwos, god, formed by e-insertion to the zero-grade *diw- <br/>
&gt;and suffixation of (accented) -o-. 1a. Tiu, Tuesday, from Old <br/>
&gt;English Tw (genitive Twes), god of war and sky; b. Tyr, from Old <br/>
&gt;Norse Tr, sky god. Both a and b from Germanic *Twaz. 2. deism, <br/>
&gt;deity, Deus, joss; adieu, deific, from Latin deus, god. 3. diva, <br/>
&gt;divine, from Latin dvus, divine, god. 4. Dis, Dives, from Latin <br/>
&gt;dves, rich (&lt; &quot;fortunate, blessed, divine&quot;). 5. Suffixed zero-grade <br/>
&gt;form *diw-yo-, heavenly. Diana, from Latin Dina, moon goddess. 6. <br/>
&gt;Devi; deodar, Devanagari, from Sanskrit deva, god, and deva-, <br/>
&gt;divine. 7. Asmodeus, from Avestan dava-, spirit, demon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;III. Variant *dy- (&lt; *dye-). dial, diary, diet2, dismal, diurnal, <br/>
&gt;journal, journey; adjourn, circadian, meridian, postmeridian, <br/>
&gt;quotidian, sojourn, from Latin dis, day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IV. Variant *dei-. psychedelic, woolly adelgid, from Greek dlos (&lt; <br/>
&gt;*deyalos), clear. (Pokorny 1. dei- 183.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WOW! How can you not be excited about this! Look at the first item. <br/>
Now, I grew up Catholic so I would have known from Catholic <br/>
iconography &#39;I&#39; was translated into J, Y or G as in IAN = YANNI = <br/>
GIANNI = JAN = JOHN = JUAN. So now we are getting somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
But WAIT! I had no idea up until today that DYEU means &#39;To shine&#39;! So <br/>
now I also know that DIA, DAY, DIEU, DIOS are all the same!!! They <br/>
are referring to the SUN! Well, check that out!<br/>
<br/>
BUT WAIT, now I also know why it is that in Spanish we say DEE-AH, <br/>
but in Brazilian Portuguese we say GEE-AH. WOW!<br/>
<br/>
This, by the way, was what I would do in my classes. It was the &#39;did <br/>
you know&#39; moment. I cannot tell you how much my students, young and <br/>
old, LOVED those moments. To this day I have former students stop me <br/>
and thank me for it. A lot of them say they actually ended with <br/>
minors in Spanish and still others felt they just wanted to learn <br/>
more about English and feel grateful for my making it fun and <br/>
interesting to them. I do not know what you call this kind of <br/>
teaching but I know it works. As I always said my students, we have a <br/>
lifetime to learn. Some know a little bit more than others and that&#39;s <br/>
why they teach; does not mean it is a reason to stop learning.<br/>
<br/>
Would I go on a tangent like this with my 4 year old? Not all the <br/>
time, not BUT, time and again, it is by just getting lost in tangents <br/>
that he &#39;gets&#39; the meanings of words. I definitely pare it down so I <br/>
won&#39;t overwhelm him because I know he will come back to it whenever <br/>
he is ready for more. We anyhow have a lifetime to learn these <br/>
things. What is important is to have the tools --without the tools, <br/>
it can be a chore, a pain in the butt or just pure hell. This way, <br/>
though, I find is waaaaaaaay more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ps: I can also read Italian, so that makes 5 languages I can dabble <br/>
in. My brother dabbles in 4: Spanish, English, German and Arabic <br/>
--and he is not half the geek I am! Still, I cannot tell you how <br/>
jealous I am that he knows those other two languages. Oh well, back <br/>
to learning some more ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457243704">Totally cool post, Liza!  I think you might really like the mother in &quot;Davita&#39;s Harp&quot; -- a novel by Chaim Potok.  Although she tended to maybe be a little bit cold as a mother figure, she had an absolute love of words and meanings and language, and anytime her daughter, Davita, asked about a word she would get a respectful mini-lesson in its roots.  I can do this a bit (I studied both Hebrew and Spanish) but I never had a teacher that would follow me there.  It&#39;s something I am trying to pass on to my kids, and I am trying to teach myself Latin to aid in this endeavor.  Anyone know any really great etymological tools?  (I hesitate to say &quot;curricula&quot; as that makes it sound school-y, and I am wanting to learn for the sheer interest of it.  Not a lot of Latin speakers around to sit and soak it up with, though (I tried sitting in on a court session in case maybe they tossed a lot of Latin terms around, but I was sadly disappointed).  Not sure how else to pursue it.    Debi<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Thursday night my dh was finishing a paper (for summer school Ed. class)<br/>
about &quot;math wars&quot; over &quot;the new new math&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at a bunch of the articles he found on the internet and I have<br/>
to say I don&#39;t think most reporters grasped the reasons that the NCASM<br/>
(?) recommended such drastic changes in the math curriculum.  (I<br/>
couldn&#39;t find it justified in anything I read.) Obviously these experts<br/>
didn&#39;t succeed in selling their theory to parents and teachers.  (I read<br/>
a lot of articles about parent-led protests over the changes.)<br/>
<br/>
Pam -- do you have an understanding of what the impetus was for the<br/>
reforms in math curriculums?  How much research, in reastic settings,<br/>
supported the newer approach to math?  (I&#39;m guessing that the NCASM<br/>
wrote volumes about this, I&#39;m just looking for something brief and superficial.)<br/>
<br/>
I had the old &quot;new math&quot; when I was in school, in the late sixties, and<br/>
I really liked it.<br/>

And then that while looking for cello/recorder music I had found those <br/>

Latin is the other way around?<br/>
<br/>
So the name of the rock Mica is from the Latin word for twinkle? Makes<br/>
sense. Or is twinkle not an excat translation? And I through bella was<br/>
beautiful?<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of mica, we were up in gold country camping a few weeks ago and<br/>
we found some rocks in the river that flaked like mica but were gold<br/>
colored, rather than silver. Any ideas? They ranged from really tiny to<br/>
maybe 3/4 of an inch in diameter, so they made great pretend gold...<br/>

I&#39;ve never read that story but I&#39;ll check it out.<br/>
<br/>
A little bit of personal trivia: My last name is Catalán for <br/>
shoemaker. Now, I am a Caribbean mutt, so this is but just one aspect <br/>
of my heritage. What is interesting is that, even though up to this <br/>
date the Catalonian Sabater [sa-ba-TER] identify themselves as <br/>
Catholic, there are some Jewish genealogists who claim that it is a <br/>
converto last name. The last name is from Barcelona and although, on <br/>
one level it means the first Sabater was part of a guild; on another <br/>
level, it means it could be a Jewish last name.<br/>
<br/>
Catalonia became a safe-heaven to Jews fleeing Castille & Leon and <br/>
most of the working and middle class in that region were Jews. So <br/>
there is a great historical probability that Sabater is indeed a <br/>
Jewish last name (as well a code word for the Sabbath). Given that my <br/>
great-grandfather was a son of the original Sabater hacendado that <br/>
settled in Puerto Rico (he wasn&#39;t a slave with a given name but a <br/>
legitimate &#39;bastardo&#39;), that would technically make part of my <br/>
heritage Jewish!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been pondering your book question and really, the only answer is <br/>
to get a dictionary with a really good etymological section or, just <br/>
for kicks, a good etymological dictionary. They can be expensive, <br/>
though. That&#39;s why I findYahoo!Reference such a valuable resource. I <br/>
also love Larrouse on the web.<br/>
<br/>
I personally have been avoiding formal education in Latin because I <br/>
don&#39;t think I can go through learning however many conjugations it <br/>
has --I had enough with Spanish, French & Portuguese. Still, if you <br/>
are not afraid of an academic text you should check out Historia de <br/>
la Lengua Española by Rafael Lapesa. It is a classic and I am <br/>
assuming that there are translations out there. As I said, it is an <br/>
academic text but makes really interesting reading. As to the Jewish <br/>
and Muslim influence in Spanish culture, you can start with Américo <br/>
Castro&#39;s classic, La realidad histórica de España.<br/>

&gt;in &quot;Davita&#39;s Harp&quot; -- a novel by Chaim Potok.  Although she tended <br/>
&gt;to maybe be a little bit cold as a mother figure, she had an <br/>
&gt;absolute love of words and meanings and language, and anytime her <br/>
&gt;daughter, Davita, asked about a word she would get a respectful <br/>
&gt;mini-lesson in its roots.  I can do this a bit (I studied both <br/>
&gt;Hebrew and Spanish) but I never had a teacher that would follow me <br/>
&gt;there.  It&#39;s something I am trying to pass on to my kids, and I am <br/>
&gt;trying to teach myself Latin to aid in this endeavor.  Anyone know <br/>
&gt;any really great etymological tools?  (I hesitate to say &quot;curricula&quot; <br/>
&gt;as that makes it sound school-y, and I am wanting to learn for the <br/>
&gt;sheer interest of it.  Not a lot of Latin speakers around to sit and <br/>
&gt;soak it up with, though (I tried sitting in on a court session in <br/>
&gt;case maybe they tossed a lot of Latin terms around, but I was sadly <br/>
&gt;disappointed).  Not sure how else to pursue it.    Debi<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt; I cannot imagine learning a language any other way.(snip)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   How can you learn what a word sounds like without knowing why;<br/>
&gt;   especially in a country like the US, where regional accents can<br/>
&gt;   boondoggle drastically a word&#39;s original sound?(snip)<br/>
&gt;    What is important is to have the tools --without the tools,<br/>
&gt;   it can be a chore, a pain in the butt or just pure hell. This way,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think word origin is kind of interesting - but I&#39;m not nearly as interested <br/>
in it as some other people are (my 14 yo, Roxana, LOVES it). I like it when <br/>
other people tell me interesting things about word origins, but I don&#39;t find <br/>
myself out looking for such information on my own. When I wanted to learn to <br/>
speak Farsi (my husband&#39;s language) - I didn&#39;t care one whit about word <br/>
origins - I just wanted to learn the words for things and how the language <br/>
was structured. What worked super well for me was very concrete learning - <br/>
I&#39;d touch a tree and someone would say, &quot;This is a tree. It has leaves.&quot; Then <br/>
they&#39;d pull a leaf off and say, &quot;This is a leaf.&quot; And so on. Then I&#39;d do <br/>
everything I could to find opportunities to use the words I&#39;d learned - I&#39;d <br/>
talk about trees and leaves and so on right away and for the next week, as <br/>
often as possible. PLUS - I talked in Farsi as much as I could. If I didn&#39;t <br/>
know a word I&#39;d try to describe it, still in Farsi (didn&#39;t know how to say <br/>
&quot;mirror&quot; but I said, awkwardly, &quot;glass that I can see my face in.&quot;) and, if I <br/>
could not do that or if I needed to move on in what I was saying, I&#39;d just <br/>
stick in English words. And, on the side, I&#39;d read a bit about the syntax of <br/>
the language, and other stuff like that. <br/>
<br/>
So - on the one hand I think it is a COOL way to learn a language if it does <br/>
draw on your own natural curiosity and, on the other hand, I just wanted to <br/>
remind people that what is very cool for one person could be very wrong for <br/>
another. I can just imagine someone trying to get their kid interested in <br/>
word origins, when the kid just wants to speak Spanish so they can understand <br/>
some other kids who speak Spanish among themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It is SO tempting to think that we&#39;ve got it all figured out &lt;G&gt; -- that <br/>
we&#39;ve figured out the best way for people to learn something. Really, we&#39;ve <br/>
figured out what works really well for us or for one of our kids - and once <br/>
we&#39;ve done that, it is so HARD to believe that it really is NOT the best way <br/>
for everyone else. THAT is one of the great challenges for all teachers and <br/>
homeschoolers. And one of the ways in which unschoolers have really advanced <br/>
thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556322524">Well Pam, the post was not about either/or. The post was about how <br/>
Phonics, by taking away context, is robbing a lot of people of a <br/>
better understanding of the English language.<br/>
<br/>
There is a moment, especially for people who want to go on to writing <br/>
and doing more abstract work, that they will need to have more than a <br/>
concrete understanding of words. I just want to bring hope to parents <br/>
that are freaking out because of their kids hardship. There is a way <br/>
of overcoming those writing road blocks and it is a way that can be <br/>
fun. I am allergic to pain, so take it from me that it can be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Still, you bring an interesting issue. My exercise was not about <br/>
learning languages; it was about better understand English through <br/>
the word JOURNAL. One of the side effects is that, by doing so, one <br/>
can come across information that can broaden our knowledge of other <br/>
languages.<br/>
<br/>
Learning how to speak a new language, whether French, German or <br/>
Farsi, is another story. The learning skills involved go way beyond <br/>
the scope or Phonetics or Etymology. The way you describe how you <br/>
learned to speak Farsi is very productive for learning any language. <br/>
It is the way we as babies learn how to speak. Babies do not learn <br/>
through phonics or phonetics. Babies learn by pointing to a tree and <br/>
saying &quot;TEE&quot;. And the more they say it, the more proficient they get. <br/>
Even babies who seemed to not talk for a while and then just start <br/>
gabbing away do so in their play.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Phonics may work for a while but I have found, by teaching other <br/>
languages, that people develop a better understand of the mechanics <br/>
by looking under the hood. My post had to do with that aspect of <br/>
learning how to write. Phonics seems to be a way of learning <br/>
automatically how to read or write a word without knowing the &#39;how&#39; <br/>
and &#39;why&#39; about it. This may make a child proficient for an <br/>
assessment exam but will not necessarily give her the tools necessary <br/>
for better expressing herself through her writing.<br/>
<br/>
In my case, because I am dyslexic and because my native language is <br/>
Spanish, writing in English was a horrendously painful process that I <br/>
did not master until I turned 21. Some of it was fear and some of it <br/>
was really the chore of having to spend long hours re-writing my <br/>
work. Something clicked and what did it for me was: (1) playing more <br/>
with my dictionaries, (2) writing more, (3) reading more, (3) MSWord <br/>
spell check. I swear, it is that simple.<br/>
<br/>
You can pick and choose which ever way you want to attack writing <br/>
but, any published writer will tell you the same. For that I highly <br/>
recommend Stephen King&#39;s book On Writing. It is truly a jewel (and <br/>
this coming from a woman that is too chicken to read his Scaryness). <br/>
The book that changed my life, though, was a book about Gabriel <br/>
García Márquez called History of a Deicide (Historia de un Deicidio); <br/>
written by another demi-god of Latin American literature, Mario <br/>
Vargas Llosa. Unfortunately, I believe the book is out of print. <br/>
King&#39;s book, though, I highly recommend. I really is inspirational.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495080062">Right. Let me put it this way. There is no order for these learning <br/>
skills to develop. Nor is there is a time line for them  --outside of <br/>
the way Pam describe learning Farsi. I think that most of us forget <br/>
it once we enter school and fall prey to process and procedure. But <br/>
as far as phonics, phonetics, etc, I do not believe there are <br/>
timetables, orders or even specific ways of exploring them. I think, <br/>
though, that if a child is having problems with one aspect or reading <br/>
or writing, probably it is time to look at these skills from a <br/>
different angle; explore other ways of developing those skills. <br/>
Especially if it is important to them.<br/>
<br/>
This comes back to a previous thread, some time ago, about &#39;strewing&#39; <br/>
vs. suggestions. I am not talking about sitting down and cracking <br/>
books. What I am talking is about looking at different strategies <br/>
that might involve some parent intervention. It might mean asking the <br/>
kids to try something different and see where it goes from there.  It <br/>
also might mean for some parents that they might have to go along for <br/>
the ride and make this a joint learning experience; such as what has <br/>
been suggested with music.<br/>
<br/>
This is not about either/or, I reiterate.  My intention was to <br/>
present something that a lot of people look at with suspicion (aka, <br/>
the dictionary), and show how you can turn it into a game. As I said, <br/>
it was a moment of geekatude.<br/>

not learning any other way. <br/>
<br/>
Not arguing - just taking one comment out of all the excellent and <br/>
interesting stuff you posted - and moving on to essentially a new topic, from <br/>
that.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This comes back to a previous thread, some time ago, about &#39;strewing&#39; <br/>
&gt; vs. suggestions. I am not talking about sitting down and cracking <br/>
&gt; books. What I am talking is about looking at different strategies <br/>
&gt; that might involve some parent intervention. It might mean asking the <br/>
&gt; kids to try something different and see where it goes from there.  It <br/>
&gt; also might mean for some parents that they might have to go along for <br/>
&gt; the ride and make this a joint learning experience; such as what has <br/>
&gt; been suggested with music.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is not about either/or, I reiterate.  My intention was to <br/>
&gt; present something that a lot of people look at with suspicion (aka, <br/>
&gt; the dictionary), and show how you can turn it into a game. As I said, <br/>
&gt; it was a moment of geekatude.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a good moment, Liza. Interesting - worthwhile points and I enjoyed <br/>
reading what your wrote!<br/>
<br/>
I was ONLY responding to this one bit:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;This is how Spanish has always been taught, even in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this country. I cannot imagine learning a language any other way.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
My point was that we often have trouble imagining ways to learn OTHER than <br/>
the way we learned or the way we figured out we learn best. (I wasn&#39;t saying <br/>
that is your case - just moving from your statement on to something else it <br/>
made me think about).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;How can you learn what a word sounds like without knowing why; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>especially in a country like the US, where regional accents can <br/>
boondoggle drastically a word&#39;s original sound?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Knowing word origins might be interesting to someone and IF it is, then it <br/>
would help them understand why a word sounds like it does. Maybe that would <br/>
bore them to tears and what helps them understand word sounds is something <br/>
else completely different.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; If Phonics is indeed Phonetics without a context, I can see why all the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>craziness. <br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes - it is phonetics with no context. Exactly.  Out of the context of not <br/>
only word origins, but also out of any context of any reason to actually <br/>
READ.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687992795">Technically, yes. I&#39;m almost positive that Vargas Llosa coined it. <br/>
The book though is about Garcia Marquez&#39;s rise as one of the leaders <br/>
of the Latin American Literary Boom. The book is about his books and <br/>
the process of his writing;  how his work is about creating a <br/>
universe and in essence, about how novelists just want to be little <br/>
gods. What I remember most about the book was how he described his <br/>
rituals for writing  --in that, he has a kindred heart in Stephen <br/>
King. They both write, no matter what, for 7 hours every day! On the <br/>
other hand, Julio Cortazar would write in spurts (The movie Blow Up <br/>
is based on a screenplay he wrote based on one of his short stories. <br/>
Also, does anybody remember the video for REMs &quot;Everybody Hurts&#39;? It <br/>
is based on one of Cortazar&#39;s short stories)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, Stephen King&#39;s book is really an amazing read. It is almost <br/>
written by two different King&#39;s  --each one a before and after his <br/>
accident (the one that nearly killed him in Maine). He even describes <br/>
what happened to him in vivid detail. It is amazing just to see how <br/>
everything comes into perspective once you get to that part. It is <br/>
really moving.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-929385921">I haven&#39;t introduced myself yet, but i&#39;ll go ahead and throw in some anecdotal evidence, since this posting made me think of it.  My younger sister made very mediocre grades in high school spanish, yet she did just fine at teaching herself spanish so that she could understand some of her friends.  This is the sort of thing that makes me interested in unschooling: why bother with forced classes when people are going to learn what they need on their own timetables anyway, sometimes (frequently) despite school?<br/>

 I can just imagine someone trying to get their kid interested in <br/>
word origins, when the kid just wants to speak Spanish so they can understand <br/>
some other kids who speak Spanish among themselves.<br/>

friends, and she told me that the high schools in our area have dropped <br/>
teaching the Spanish letter RR because it is just too much. No other <br/>
explanation. That is how I cannot imagine learning a language!}<br/>
<br/>
Most of the languages I learned as a child, I learned by total immersion. We <br/>
lived in so many different places, learning the local language quickly was a <br/>
necessity. I have since forgotten most, because I haven&#39;t heard them spoken <br/>
since, but sometimes I do hear someone speaking in a language and I can pick <br/>
up most of what they are saying. Pam says she learned Farsi because she <br/>
wanted to know her husbands language. I learned Farsi so I could talk to my <br/>
friends, or go shopping with my mother. Since we left Iran years ago, I have <br/>
rarely heard Farsi spoken and I assumed I had all but forgotten how to speak <br/>
or read it. I went to visit my family in Oklahoma recently and my Mom and I <br/>
found a box of some of my old things in it. One of the things found was a <br/>
necklace and Moly immediately put it on. The necklace has my name in Farsi, <br/>
and I took one look at it and told Moly she had it on backwards. My Mom <br/>
laughed and asked how I could tell, but my Dad said I was right, it was <br/>
backwards. Funny thing is, I can&#39;t speak it any more, but can still read it <br/>
enough to get by, my Mom can&#39;t read it anymore but can still speak it (sort <br/>
of) and my dad can still speak and read Farsi. We all learned by immersion, <br/>
no phonics, sight words or whole language.<br/>
