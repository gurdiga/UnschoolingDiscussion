<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539194448">I admit it, I am a strewer of sorts.  My oldest boy does not like <br/>
going to the library (or even reading for that matter which makes me <br/>
wonder where he came from, but that&#39;s another story :).  So when I <br/>
go, I ask if he wants me to pick up some things... if yes, I get <br/>
several books on different topics I think may interest him, either a <br/>
topic he&#39;s already going off on or something new.  Then I set them on <br/>
the table, show  him what&#39;s available, and leave it alone.  The other <br/>
2 younger kids will grab anything they can get their hands on and go <br/>
at it, no active strewing needed :)<br/>
<br/>
As far as other things go, I think I strew by way of active <br/>
example...I spend a lot of time researching all sorts of ideas that <br/>
come my way, and usually DO something with the new knowledge I&#39;ve <br/>
gained.  So, they see me getting excited about a thing, see all my <br/>
library books and projects associated with it. Sometimes they ask to <br/>
join in, or do their own version of it, other times they don&#39;t.  What <br/>
I hope sticks, is the idea they there is so much to learn and that <br/>
it&#39;s really fun trying out new things and you don&#39;t ever have to stop <br/>
doing it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL!  You sure you aren&#39;t talking about *my* son?  Mine waits in the car <br/>
listening to the radio when I go into the library.  (It&#39;s part of our town <br/>
day, so staying home would mean missing the other stuff that day.)  We say <br/>
he&#39;s allergic to libraries.  He even tries to set a time limit on my <br/>
visit.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I still look for things he might be interested in, and sometimes I guess right.<br/>
