<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537557572">I&#39;ve read three chapters and am eager to get to the rest!  (And The<br/>
Skylark Sings With Me).<br/>
<br/>
Am currently reading The Teenage Liberation Handbook and loving it!  My<br/>
kids are 6 & 4, but this book is so reassuring about UNschooling and<br/>
LIVING and trusting your kids.  I&#39;m so grateful to those who&#39;ve paved the<br/>
way of HS before me.  Because of them, I got to learn about HS before my<br/>
kids were school age.  I&#39;m glad that my kids are living life now, rather<br/>
than putting in their twelve years (or more) first.<br/>
<br/>
I love that bedtime doesn&#39;t have to be forced.  The other night (about<br/>
9pm), Dd handed me a piece of paper that she&#39;d marked 4 grids on.  I was<br/>
&quot;assigned&quot; to draw a picture of my 4 favorite things from that day and<br/>
write a paragraph about each one.  (She&#39;d left a tiny space for each of<br/>
my paragraphs!)  LOL!  I told her I couldn&#39;t get to it right then, but<br/>
would later.  She reappeared about 30 minutes later and had done the<br/>
assignment for me!<br/>
We haven&#39;t done &quot;school&quot; except for a few months (sort of) at the<br/>
beginning of kindergarten last year, so I&#39;m not sure where this all came<br/>
from.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go fix &quot;lunch&quot; now for 4 yr old (it&#39;s 9am here).<br/>
