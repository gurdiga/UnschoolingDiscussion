 </span></blockquote>Well, now that we are all focused on ancestors, maybe I can make a request<br/>
for some help!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m doing a workshop at the California Home-Education Conference in<br/>
August on homeschooling and diversity issues (I&#39;m also doing one on race<br/>
and the new standards, two more usual homeschooling workshops, and my<br/>
homeschooling WITH gifted kids workshop) -- but for the first one, I&#39;m<br/>
putting together a reading list of the best &quot;immigration&quot; (and growing up<br/>
put in a nationality) novels  (and occasional non-fiction) -- I&#39;ve often<br/>
found it best<br/>
that getting parents excited about diversity issues (literature being a<br/>
good way to do it) is the best way to make sure they engage their kids on<br/>
multicultural issues.  (the books will be good for teenagers, too, of<br/>
course.)<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, my reading list has Japanese-American, Chinese-American,<br/>
Laotian-American, Jewish-American, Quaker (given who I am),<br/>
Armenian-American<br/>
Mexician-American, American Indian, African-American, and<br/>
Norwegian-American contributions thus far.  I&#39;m looking for (especially)<br/>
Italian-American, Polish-American, Asian Indian-American, and<br/>
German-American novels.  Suggestions welcome -- and don&#39;t worry -- I read<br/>
them ALL before adding to the list<br/>
<br/>
My favorite one  is the extraordinary Norwegian-American novel &quot;Giants in<br/>
the<br/>
Earth&quot; by a towering giant of American literature, Ole Rolvaag, who is<br/>
almost totally unknown outside Norwegian circles. (&quot;Giants in the Earth&quot;,<br/>
incidentally, was actually written in Norwegian, and then translated,<br/>
collectively, with Rolvaag in the lead, by the faculty of St. Olaf&#39;s<br/>
College in Northfield, Minnesota.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot; is about the journey of 5 Norwegian<br/>
families to a totally unsettled part of South Dakota, and their efforts<br/>
in making a wholly new life for themselves.  It is psychologically<br/>
gripping in its depiction of what it must have been like for people to<br/>
head out almost totally into the unknown, and their different responses<br/>
to it. It is absolutely stunning in its depiction of the landscape, the<br/>
seasons, and encounters between ethnic groups as they searched for a new<br/>
place (both outer, and inner) to call home.<br/>
<br/>
But, anyhow, how I (re)discovered this book is an interesting little<br/>
story.  I actually read it once before, when I was 14, and a sophomore in<br/>
high school. I HATED IT, and made fun of it for the next 30 years!  Now,<br/>
you have to get the picture: I was a Jewish New Yorker at an all-male<br/>
high school for science nerds in Manhattan.  The school at the time was<br/>
about 85-90% Jewish, 5% Asian, and a smattering of everyone else.  I knew<br/>
exactly one Norwegian (his name was Hans Olsen, of course, and he may<br/>
have been the only real blonde in the school.)  My &quot;western relatives&quot;,<br/>
who we saw only at weddings and funerals, lived in Cranford, New Jersey.<br/>
(To the day he died, I think my grandfather thought that Indiana was the<br/>
capital of Iowa). And this was basically the case for 95% of the school.<br/>
The teacher was universally hated -- old Mrs. Hegarty.  I think she<br/>
wanted to expose us to other cultures, or to rest of America, or some<br/>
such, but it went totally over our heads (and she was absolutely no help)<br/>
-- we felt more comfortable in the Africa of Conrad&#39;s Heart of Darkness<br/>
than we did in South Dakota!  (I have funny stories about what I thought<br/>
agriculture was about at the time -- some other time!)  At the time, it<br/>
simply seemed like &quot;theater of the absurd&quot; -- people traveling through<br/>
grass fields (no roads) at 2 miles an hour on carts drawn by oxen to<br/>
(what seemed to me -- and which is magnificently presented in the book)<br/>
absolutely nowhere.  Now, 35 years later, I can fully appreciate how<br/>
absolutely extraordinary the book really is, as well as the people it<br/>
describes who left Norway to settle the upper Midwest.<br/>
<br/>
So, anyhow, when I began to lead workshops on diversity and multicultural<br/>
issues, I quickly became aware that I knew more about the feelings of<br/>
American Indians, African Americans, etc., as expressed in literature,<br/>
than I did about the European settlers of middle America!  Your<br/>
suggestions will be most welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was sooooooo glad you added about your rediscovery.   When you first<br/>
spoke of it being so unknown I wondered if my memory of that title from a<br/>
high school literature anthology was mistaken.     It was just an excerpt<br/>
and I don&#39;t remember the details except being disturbed  by the reading.<br/>
I &quot;think&quot;  it came up again in a college survey course of American<br/>
Literature.......... even if written in Norwegian to begin,  is Rolvaag<br/>
considered an American author?<br/>
<br/>
Can you provide more description (offlist if you like)  of exactly what you<br/>
are looking for in book suggestions?      Adult rather than &quot;children&#39;s&quot;<br/>
books?     Mostly geared to nationality?     Any particular time frame?<br/>
First generation immigrant experiences (even if told by later authors) or<br/>
later communities maintaining particular heritage as well as blending?.<br/>
Just trying to get a feel for what you are looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Am also wondering if you perhaps plan other reading lists that deal with<br/>
other than immigration.............looking at &quot;diversity issues&quot;  as also<br/>
arising from   class,  urban v. rural,  economic status,  age,   stability<br/>
vs. mobility among regions within the U.S. ,or even gender!<br/>

&gt; story.  I actually read it once before, when I was 14, and a sophomore in<br/>
&gt; high school. I HATED IT, and made fun of it for the next 30 years!  Now,<br/>
&gt; you have to get the picture: I was a Jewish New Yorker at an all-male<br/>
&gt; high school for science nerds in Manhattan.  The school at the time was<br/>
&gt; about 85-90% Jewish, 5% Asian, and a smattering of everyone else.  I knew<br/>
&gt; exactly one Norwegian (his name was Hans Olsen, of course, and he may<br/>
&gt; have been the only real blonde in the school.)  My &quot;western relatives&quot;,<br/>
&gt; who we saw only at weddings and funerals, lived in Cranford, New Jersey.<br/>
&gt; (To the day he died, I think my grandfather thought that Indiana was the<br/>
&gt; capital of Iowa). And this was basically the case for 95% of the school.<br/>
&gt; The teacher was universally hated -- old Mrs. Hegarty.  I think she<br/>
&gt; wanted to expose us to other cultures, or to rest of America, or some<br/>
&gt; such, but it went totally over our heads (and she was absolutely no help)<br/>
&gt; -- we felt more comfortable in the Africa of Conrad&#39;s Heart of Darkness<br/>
&gt; than we did in South Dakota!  (I have funny stories about what I thought<br/>
&gt; agriculture was about at the time -- some other time!)  At the time, it<br/>
&gt; simply seemed like &quot;theater of the absurd&quot; -- people traveling through<br/>
&gt; grass fields (no roads) at 2 miles an hour on carts drawn by oxen to<br/>
&gt; (what seemed to me -- and which is magnificently presented in the book)<br/>
&gt; absolutely nowhere.  Now, 35 years later, I can fully appreciate how<br/>
&gt; absolutely extraordinary the book really is, as well as the people it<br/>
&gt; describes who left Norway to settle the upper Midwest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, anyhow, when I began to lead workshops on diversity and multicultural<br/>
&gt; issues, I quickly became aware that I knew more about the feelings of<br/>
&gt; American Indians, African Americans, etc., as expressed in literature,<br/>
&gt; than I did about the European settlers of middle America!  Your<br/>
&gt; suggestions will be most welcome.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your help!<br/>

1975.    I found in gripping, touching, almost an overload of food for<br/>
thought.     Some class members found it overwhelmingly boring, depressing,<br/>
and tedious.      While I carried it with me and read on the subway and<br/>
everywhere else,    some admitted to  being unable to finish it.     It is<br/>
set during the large migration from Appalachia to Detroit during World War<br/>
II.       In one of the reviews at Amazon.com  a reader notes that it was<br/>
read 10 years ago and never forgotten.     Could be like Giants in the<br/>

year.   Mostly in Boston but  visiting people and places throughout New<br/>
England and upstate NY.     This native Texan  found it stimulating and<br/>
interesting   but  NEEDED  to return to a place where she could see the<br/>
horizon,    where it did not get dark as early as 5 pm and where &quot;slow&quot;  or<br/>
&quot;relax&quot; was not  seen as a negative!.     Of course, in the intervening 25<br/>
years there is  more of a blending of regional characteristics everywhere.<br/>
I hear you can even get iced tea or Dr. Pepper there now---and find<br/>
enchiladas not made with mozzarella for the cheese!<br/>

I am just outside Austin, TX   now-----also known as Silicon Hills---and<br/>
watching a major migration.<br/>

P.S.:   David,   you might want to read  Hard Living on Clay Street  for<br/>
consideration  if  later you make lists about how people live very different<br/>
lives  even in close proximity.     It is set in Washington D.C. (or just<br/>
outside)  and is non-fiction.</div>
