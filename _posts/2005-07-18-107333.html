<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491703513">Joyce: &quot;A child who will be a doctor won&#39;t not learn biology&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra: &quot;A child who WANTS to be a doctor&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How about an unschooled child who becomes a doctor? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to get across the idea that it&#39;s easier to look back from <br/>
where an  unschooler ends up and see the path that led there <br/>
than to see where the path  an unschooler is on will lead.<br/>
<br/>
From a schooled mindset a child in a biology class is potentially <br/>
on the path to  being a doctor (or biologist or something sciency.)<br/>
<br/>
From a schooled mindset a child playing a video game is at best <br/>
relaxing and  at worst wasting time. Video games (apparently) <br/>
don&#39;t lead anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
From an unschooled mindset an unschooled child in a biology <br/>
class is doing  something they find interesting.<br/>
<br/>
And same for an unschooled child playing a video game. :-)<br/>
<br/>
From a schooled mindset Kathryn&#39;s interest in dinosaurs from <br/>
ages 3 to 6  looked like a path to paleontologist.<br/>
<br/>
But looking back from where she is now with her writing and <br/>
drawing and her  fascination with fantasy creatures and creating <br/>
detailed worlds, her interest in  dinosaurs was as natural a part <br/>
of the path she took to where she is as her  interest in Pokemon <br/>
and cats and now manga and anime. She was always  following <br/>
a path of interest.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t know where a child will end up from what interests they <br/>
pursue. The  interests make look academically important (like <br/>
dinosaurs) or academically  trivial (like Pokemon) but what <br/>
counts in an unschooling life is treating their  interests seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids don&#39;t always know where they&#39;re headed so <br/>
they won&#39;t be  saying &quot;Oh, I need to do this [like study biology] to <br/>
get there.&quot; What they&#39;ll be  saying is &quot;Oh, that [like a dead bug<br/>
:-)] <br/>
looks interesting!&quot;<br/>

Same thing.<br/>

<br/>
And the parents who get good at unschooling won&#39;t jump on the examination of <br/>
a dead bug as proof that the child wants to be a doctor.   Might just grow up <br/>
to do horror movies with realistic chomping space-bugs, or might do movie <br/>
props or miniatures or grind up bugs to make natural dyes or develop natural <br/>
pesticides or learn to communicate with bugs so that people can just pay them to <br/>
move to vacant lots.   Yeah.   That would be cool.<br/>
