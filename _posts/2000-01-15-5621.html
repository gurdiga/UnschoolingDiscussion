<div id="ygrps-yiv-752324762">Just a small request...I am a single mom who relies HEAVILY on this list<br/>
for support. I also work full time. I get up early to read the wonderful<br/>
question/answers that everyone has. I also gain a mile long list of<br/>
ideas from you. Please don&#39;t let Pokemon rule the list, I&#39;m fully aware<br/>
of their existence but I would really prefer ideas on how to keep my<br/>
unschooled children unschooled!<br/>
Aleasa<br/>
<br/>
Hope I am doing this right... I have been subscribed and have been reading but haven&#39;t posted yet... I have subscribed to the &quot;digest&quot; version so I am afraid to reply to the email as I&#39;m afraid it will include all 30 or so messages on the digest.... <br/>
<br/>
Aleasa, excuse me for butting in but HOW do you work full time and unschool?  I would appreciate any tips you have ... I am unschooling my 14 year old but I am working nights and things aren&#39;t that smooth ... I am being laid off Jan 29th so I am excited about that and will be working for myself ... but these next two weeks are still a killer ... smile.. .thanks for your time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605335299">Ya know, that is interesting as there was just a cop on Wheel of Fortune<br/>
who said that he works nights so he can homeschool his kids during the day.<br/>
 He was from Mass.<br/>
<br/>
But, on to the help part.  There is or was a list on the HEM boards for<br/>
homeschooling working parents.  You might try there for some suggestions,<br/>
etc.<br/>
