&lt;&lt; Are evaluators the law in your state?  I am still trying to determine what<br/>
 the laws are, and the requirements in Idaho, and as far as I can tell there<br/>
 are no requirements of any kind.  Does anyone know if you must submit<br/>
 Intent to Homeschool form, do testing or any other form of evaluations in<br/>
 Idaho?  I have not had any luck locating homeschoolers in the area who are<br/>
 not religiously oriented (lots of Mormons here.)  There are groups in Boise<br/>
 but that is on the other side of the state from us, and I was hoping to<br/>
 find folks for social interaction...)-: &gt;&gt;<br/>

I tried to e-mail you about Idaho laws, but it must not have gone through. We <br/>
moved from Idaho last year after living in Boise for 6 years. The laws in <br/>
Idaho are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
There are none. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it, plain and simple. The little pamphlet I received from the <br/>
superintendent&#39;s office said that a homeschooler needed to teach reading, <br/>
writing and arithmetic in some shape or form. You don&#39;t need to register with <br/>
the school system, there is no testing, no evaluators, no nothing. If your <br/>
children have attended school then you do need to tell the principal that you <br/>
are pulling them out. A phone call takes care of that. You will find that the <br/>
state of Idaho really respects homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you located? I may be able to find out if there is a non-morman <br/>
support group in your area. I had that problem too. :o)<br/>

We are in Idaho Falls in the Southeastern part of the state.  We belong to<br/>
a great playgroup and do things with those non-Mormon friends outside of<br/>
playgroup too, like go to the zoo and story time at the library.  I think<br/>
that is enough social interaction for my little ones for now.  However, if<br/>
our adoption works out we will have a second grader and I need to work on<br/>
networking some things for her as well.  She would find the kids in the<br/>
playgroup a little on the young side for her.  The oldest child is three!<br/>
