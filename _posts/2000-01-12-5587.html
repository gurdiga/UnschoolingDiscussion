<div id="ygrps-yiv-28991303">We were just chatting about the realities of socialization on a couple of<br/>
lists this week.  The reality is that these oh so important friendships<br/>
that are going to last a life time, don&#39;t!  Studies, which ps of course<br/>
never uses or it would ruin their argument, show that rarely do<br/>
relationships stay static and most folks move on.  Several hundred people<br/>
were interviewed in each study and it was found that unless someone was<br/>
born, raised and lived their whole life in the same town and the same<br/>
applied to their &quot;best friend,&quot; most people couldn&#39;t even name their &quot;best<br/>
friend&quot; from grades K-3.  Although some folks could name &quot;a&quot; friend or two<br/>
from 4-6, most couldn&#39;t.  The friends folks had in 7-9 rarely translated to<br/>
lasting friendships through high school.  AND, most folks had lost contact<br/>
with anyone they went to high school with within 2 to 3 years after leaving<br/>
school unless, again, they lived in the same town for life and had business<br/>
dealings with these folks.<br/>
<br/>
It has also been found that it isn&#39;t the &quot;quantity&quot; of folks one knows but<br/>
the &quot;quality&quot; of the friendships and the variety of folks one knows. <br/>
Sooooo, since most hsing kids meet a wide variety of people, interact with<br/>
a wide variety of people and have at least one good little friend when they<br/>
are kids, they more than meet the criteria for needed socialization!<br/>

OK -- so he will be taking 3 classes -- maybe he will meet a couple of <br/>
buddies there.  Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day though -- he may not actually meet <br/>
his best friend in the next 3 months.  Life isn&#39;t that organized.  I don&#39;t <br/>
meet people just because we are all the same age (OK -- all 42 yo moms line <br/>
up over here -- now, be friends.)  and I&#39;m sure your husband doesn&#39;t either.  <br/>
Your son will find his way and it sounds, to me, that you are offering enough <br/>
opportunities.  I am more concerned, around here, about running around and <br/>
trying to do too much.  My kids are still young (6 1/2 and 5) and you can <br/>
just see that as 1 activity clicks and then you add another (some will stick <br/>
and some not)  -- eventuall you could be trying to do too much.  Balancing <br/>
act time!<br/>
<br/>
Take care.  You&#39;re doing great!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641017540">My husband, too, was a bit worried about that.  I was too until I read<br/>
everything I could get my hands on.  Suddenly I realized that socialization is<br/>
all interaction with anyone.  My kids go everywhere with me, and they get to<br/>
see and interact with everyone I do, so I think they will be just fine.  It<br/>
helps to think of socialization as living.  My husband just needed some<br/>
time...   Is your husband willing to give some time?  He will see after a bit<br/>
that your kids are just fine (really even better socially than school kids)<br/>
Another thing that helped my hubby was to meet a couple of homeschooled teens<br/>
and older.  He was so impressed with them, that I never heard another doubt.<br/>

You are doing more right now as far as &#39;socialization&#39; than we are. We (me,<br/>
9yods, 4yodd) CHERISH our time at home with each other. Imho, socialization<br/>
is so overrated. There is a fine line between socialization and peer<br/>
dependency. As long as you are listening to what your children seem to need,<br/>
play it by ear and do what feels right. Your children are so young, and at<br/>
such wonderful ages for all of you spend so much time together.<br/>
<br/>
There was a quote I read, I don&#39;t remember where I read it but it went<br/>

replied &quot;Well, at first it was a real problem, but now that we&#39;ve cut back<br/>
on some visiting and playdates, I think we&#39;ve got it under control&quot;  :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i agree with everything you said.  i have a friend whose husband really pushed<br/>
her to be constantly &#39;doing & going&#39; with their daughter, since the time she<br/>
was born, and now her daughter is always demanding to have external<br/>
entertainment and is never really happy at home especially without some<br/>
organized activity or friends visiting.  it made me think that too much outside<br/>
stimulation creates dependency on that stimulation.<br/>
<br/>
our son, rene&#39; (4 yo) has had very little socializing (due to a 2 1/2 year<br/>
illness of mine - vaccine related autoimmune disease) and i think it worked out<br/>
great because we bonded as a family without a lot of external distractions.  he<br/>
loves his friends but seeing them at the park once a week seems to be enough<br/>
for him.  we talk and play and spend time together but do separate  things as<br/>
well (though in close proximity).  most everything we do involves him (with the<br/>
exception of &quot;coffee&#39; in the morning - we try to keep an hour or so for us to<br/>
talk without rene&#39;:)  and at park days we&#39;re both (my husband (he arranged his<br/>
work schedule to allow time to come) and i) out there playing with all the<br/>
kids.  i realize that peer groups are fun, for both adults and kids but to me<br/>
the time zips by and soon enough they will be leaving and not having time to<br/>
spend with their parents so why rush it.<br/>
<br/>
the benefits a really tight family bond can have<br/>
in comparison to the kids being gone all of the time and their main<br/>
influence being other kids rather than you and him, he will believe.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
i think that the more kids are bonded with their parents, the more they are<br/>
comfortable with themselves and who they are.   therefore  &#39;socialization&#39; just<br/>
happens because your world view is one of love, kindness and acceptance;<br/>
frustration followed by resolution; and a deep understanding that everyone has<br/>
needs and if we pay attention and really care about each other everyone&#39;s needs<br/>
will be met.  i&#39;ve been to a few same age events and honestly i don&#39;t see it as<br/>
that positive - power struggles seem to erupt very quickly.  at the park days<br/>
we attend, the group is very diverse in age and i find that basically the same<br/>
thing happens - power struggles and dominance issues abound (early stages of<br/>
&quot;lord of the flies&#39;)  but if adults get actively involved and have fun playing<br/>
( not taking a dominate position and leading/directing but providing gentle<br/>
boundaries and reminders that others have feelings and desires as well) then<br/>
quality socialization can be experience by the kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-581402">Most children make most of their friends in school simply because this is<br/>
where they spend most of their time.  Many genuises and very focused<br/>
people had somewhat isolated childhoods due to illnesses that kept them<br/>
home from school a lot or due to living in isolated areas.<br/>
My 7 yr old love, love, loves to be with other children.  Begs to play<br/>
with friends.  Often ends up with a new friend if we are at the park or<br/>
somewhere.  She made a new friend while skiing over the holidays.  But<br/>
after too much time with friends, she is less pleasant to her family.  We<br/>
sometimes need a long stretch of down time for her to remember how to<br/>
entertain herself.  But she is in frequent demand in our neighborhood. <br/>
(Maybe the fact that we are not enrolled in constant classes is a factor<br/>
- we are home a lot.)<br/>

Mary Ellen,<br/>
        I enjoyed reading your post on this subject because it sounds like <br/>
you are the antithesis of what I have let happen in my family.  I have gotten <br/>
better about not finding a new class every month&lt;grin&gt;,  but I still struggle <br/>
with this issue on an almost daily basis.  I won&#39;t list our schedule here, <br/>
but suffice it to say that we maybe have one or two totally &quot;at-home&quot; days a <br/>
week.  On the one hand, I feel a need to provide these opportunities to my <br/>
daughter, but I also feel burn-out on the horizon.  Complicating factors for <br/>
me include a one year son who rarely naps for more than 30-45 minutes the <br/>
entire day and the fact that we are out in the country which means that we <br/>
have to drive at least 15 minutes to be anywhere.    I really want to be home <br/>
more, but there are so many enrichment opportunites out there.  I feel guilty <br/>
if we don&#39;t take advantage of them, yet realize we are limited by time, money <br/>
and attention span.<br/>
        Do you mind sharing your philosophy of outside activities and how you <br/>
buck the notion that we are supposed to be generously providing them for our <br/>
kids?  Could you or anyone else provide any wisdom on how I find get this <br/>
feeling under control--the feeling that the more enrichment classes my DS <br/>
attends the better?  Of course, my last statement is somewhat of an <br/>
exaggeration, but I really struggle to fight this feeling.<br/>
        BTW, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve officially introduced myself--I live in NC, <br/>
my daughter is seven, and this list is a lifeline for me.  Until about a year <br/>
ago, I didn&#39;t know what kind of HSer I was, but I knew that I just couldn&#39;t <br/>
force myself to buy a canned curriculum and &quot;do school.&quot;  I guess I&#39;m a baby <br/>
unschooler and I learn a lot here--there are almost no unschoolers in my <br/>
HSing community.<br/>
        Thanks for listening.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Jennie,<br/>
<br/>
We are &quot;at home&quot; people as well.  We used to attend a playgroup once a<br/>
week, but that was too much for all of us for various reasons, so now we<br/>
are just at home.  My kids are 3 and almost 2, and really enjoy the time at<br/>
home.  They both nap for two hours in the afternoon most days, and we spend<br/>
our days playing together (or them playing on their own, which I think is<br/>
important too.)  Since outings are hard with two little ones who sometimes<br/>
need to be carried and still think it&#39;s funny to run away from me, we go<br/>
out when Daddy is home in the evenings, as a family.  <br/>
<br/>
Trips to the grocery store mean two carts for two kiddies with two adults<br/>
pushing them.  If only one adult is going out somewhere, than the boys take<br/>
turns getting to go with us (shopping, running errands, etc.)  In the cold<br/>
weather we are indoors now, but when it is warmer we also go to the park on<br/>
the corner or to the river a few blocks away to feed the birds.  We enjoy<br/>
having friends over on an individual basis once in a while, or going to<br/>
their houses.  I think that it is very important for them at this age to<br/>
learn how to entertain themselves, how to get along with family, how to<br/>
have quiet time, and all the other life skills they are working on like<br/>
table manners, and being polite and kind to others, etc.  We don&#39;t have any<br/>
interest right now in potty training aside from talking about it, and I am<br/>
not pushing them.  They know where their potty is and can go whenever they<br/>
like and occasionally want to sit on it, but have not actually used it yet.<br/>
<br/>
As far as enrichment opportunites, my three year old can recognize his and<br/>
his brother&#39;s name in print; is learning his colors (knows blue, red and<br/>
green,) knows the names of and how to play with various musical<br/>
instruments; knows some shapes; knows some letters; can do puzzles by<br/>
himself; knows how to do laundry; knows how to wash his hands and brush his<br/>
teeth; knows many songs (Like Itsy Bitsy Spider) and many stories by heart;<br/>
can recognize and name all types of construction equipment, animals, and<br/>
vehicles; says bless you, thank you, you&#39;re welcome, I&#39;m sorry and please<br/>
automatically, to name a few of his skills.  All of this is without ever<br/>
attending any sort of classes, and never &quot;working&quot; with him on any of these<br/>
skills.  We simply show by example, answer his questions, read to him, and<br/>
play together.  Lately he has been asking the color of everything and is<br/>
beginning to tell me what color something is (and get it right.)  His<br/>
social skills are pretty advanced for a child his age, and I have even had<br/>
strangers comment on how friendly and articulate he is.<br/>
<br/>
My &quot;baby&quot; is a much quieter type of person and does not talk nearly as<br/>
much, but he is learning many things by copying his brother, whom he<br/>
obviously idolizes.  They play really well together and are very<br/>
affectionate with each other.  As they get older I will take my cues from<br/>
them about how much and what types of social activities they would like to<br/>
get involved in, but I still will reserve the right to veto something or<br/>
make them choose if it is too much, for them or for me.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071531061">Hi Jenny,<br/>
My oldest is 7 too.  We are stumbling along, learning as we go.  I find<br/>
reading very helpful - Growing Without Schooling & Home Education<br/>
Magazine, among others, + books on the topic.  I do have some unschooling<br/>
friends.  I&#39;m very lucky!<br/>
<br/>
My newest thing that I&#39;m really focusing on is, if we are not &quot;doing<br/>
school&quot; what are we doing?  I personally am annoyed by so many of the<br/>
crafts and what not for kids to do that produce junk IMHO.  (No offense<br/>
to people who enjoy these things - they just seem so contrived to me)  So<br/>
I am trying to steer my kids toward doing real things - like learning to<br/>
sew.  Which has led me to look closer at how I spend my time.  What am I<br/>
doing that is meaningful?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the great things about this list, hearing how others are<br/>
living!<br/>

&gt;         BTW, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve officially introduced myself--I live <br/>
&gt; in NC, <br/>
&gt; my daughter is seven, and this list is a lifeline for me.  Until <br/>
&gt; about a year <br/>
&gt; ago, I didn&#39;t know what kind of HSer I was, but I knew that I just <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; force myself to buy a canned curriculum and &quot;do school.&quot;  I guess <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a baby <br/>
&gt; unschooler and I learn a lot here--there are almost no unschoolers <br/>
&gt; in my <br/>
&gt; HSing community.<br/>
&gt;         Thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>

I agree with you 100%.  I can&#39;t stand the idea of producing &quot;stuff&quot; just for <br/>
the sake of production.  Almost every bit of that junk gets thrown away in <br/>
our house.  Sewing, carpentry, cooking - these all give our little people a <br/>
sense of creating and accomplishment, and the end product is something <br/>
&quot;real&quot;.  <br/>

Thanks Mary Ellen and everyone else who contributed to the outside <br/>
activities/socialization discussion.  I agree with you about the list--I look <br/>
forward to reading every post.<br/>
