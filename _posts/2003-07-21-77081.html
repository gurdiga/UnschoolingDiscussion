<div id="ygrps-yiv-7279616">This is too good not to put up on the list!<br/>
<br/>
Background:  I work in a Library.  One of the staff has a felt board where she puts of quotes by authors all scrambled and people rearrange the words to gett he mystery quote.  HOWEVER, people also rearrange and create there own quotes.<br/>
<br/>
This morning:  I came in to see Emerson&#39;s famous quote &quot;sculpture and painting have an effect to teach us manners and abolish hurry&quot; rearranged by a free spirit to read ABOLISH[ing] TEACH[ing] AND THE EFFECT OF MANNERS HAVE US PAINTING.<br/>
<br/>
Now ain&#39;t that unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Happy thots<br/>
