<div id="ygrps-yiv-859218653">Perhaps one was hysterical because one had never been held to make the bad<br/>
go away.  Kidlet #4 has been an accident that doesn&#39;t wait to happen since<br/>
birth.  No hysteria when he slid down a slide and landed on glass that<br/>
ripped the sole of his foot open from toes to heel, he screamed for someone<br/>
to get his mom cause he knew mommy would fix it.  Screaming or hysteria,<br/>
what&#39;s the difference, you ask, well, the difference is that he had to<br/>
scream to be heard over the noise in the park.  Eldest son tipped over<br/>
using his bed for a trampoline and split his head open and hit a<br/>
spurter--blood all over the bed, walls, window.  No hysteria, just a get<br/>
mom.  #2 son split his eyebrow open (17 stitches) and didn&#39;t get<br/>
hysterical, just called for mommy to fix it.  Oh, did I mention they were<br/>
all 4 and 5 years old.<br/>
<br/>
And, I&#39;ve never had any problem stopping hysteria by simply holding a child<br/>
tight and crooning to them, including those that weren&#39;t mine!  I&#39;ve also<br/>
seen just a loud voice work just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe too many folks have seen too many movies where the &quot;hero&quot; (yeah<br/>
right) slap the hysterical woman across the face to shut her up????<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344240287">I have been on this group for a while and have just read everyone&#39;s post and I<br/>
am appalled at what I have been reading.  I joined to get ideas and help with<br/>
unschooling my child.  Some of the name calling I have read is childish.  I know<br/>
that everyone has different opinions on spanking and abuse.  It is a very<br/>
difficult subject for everyone to discuss, but come on.  As far as someone who<br/>
is a &quot;hick&quot; and someone can&#39;t believe they actually homeschool.  As far as I am<br/>
concerned, the Lord has directed me  to homeschool.  You have to be an<br/>
intelligent, loving parent to want to stay home with your child and be in charge<br/>
of their future as far as working at McDonald&#39;s or as an attorney.  To do such<br/>
an important and amazing thing, you are by far, not a &quot;hick&quot;.  To even decide to<br/>
do this, you are in a way, above others who don&#39;t.  All of us on here care about<br/>
our children.  I am not saying we are better than anyone else.  We just love our<br/>
children.  Therefore, this list should be a loving helpful group of friends who<br/>
talk about how there day is going and an occasional debate is fine, but this<br/>
name calling is for the public school system.  We should all be there for each<br/>
other and help with the day to day problems of homeschooling.  How would you<br/>
look to your kids if they got on here and read the name calling?  Would you not<br/>
set such a sorry example for them?  Just speaking my opinion.  Tired of the junk<br/>
I am reading.  Melissa<br/>

&gt; No, no, no.....you&#39;re not getting it. I was hysterical. I needed to hold<br/>
&gt; still so she could stop the bleeding. I couldn&#39;t even hear her saying &quot;Stop!<br/>
&gt; Hold still!&quot; over my own frightened screaming. (I cut myself trying to make<br/>
&gt; lunch.) She gave me one simple stinging swat on the tush and it brought me<br/>
&gt; back to earth. She didn&#39;t care about cleaning up the mess. She knew she<br/>
&gt; needed to stop the bleeding. And she was certainly used to my strong<br/>
&gt; emotions. If she had had a problem with that, I would have received a lot<br/>
&gt; more than 3 spankings in my entire life. Not a control issue at all, unless<br/>
&gt; you count first-aid as a control issue. The spanking was a simple attention<br/>
&gt; getter. No ill effects and no therapy needed.<br/>

<br/>
Now Kris....you know me. I didn&#39;t mention that scene to justify hitting.<br/>
There was no way my mother could have held me at that moment...I was way too<br/>
big and I was flailing around. She only spanked me because that was the<br/>
fastest, simplest way to shock me out of my hysteria and take care of my<br/>
bleeding finger. To me, this wasn&#39;t an &quot;off the wall scenario&quot;. There have<br/>
been times when I had to firmly (and gently) take hold of my children to<br/>
calm them....there have been other times when a swat worked better. I do not<br/>
consider a swat on a behind as &quot;hitting&quot;. I did not feel like I had been hit<br/>
by my mother. Again, I think calling it that trivializes actual hitting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have no problem with this solution to hysteria.  In fact, I think it is <br/>
probably the best.  I feel the need to add a couple thoughts to that, <br/>
however...one is that some of us are physically unable to hold a child that <br/>
is thrashing around.  Even a single swat would take a great deal out of my <br/>
physically, but could be done much more easily in an emergency than <br/>
struggling to get physically get ahold of hysterical child.<br/>
<br/>
Second, we don&#39;t always think of the best solution in the heat of the moment. <br/>
 Sometimes any solution that works is as good as it gets.<br/>
<br/>
I am very happy to see the holding suggestion, as it may help some of us <br/>
think of that at some future time when there is an emergency.  But, I&#39;m not <br/>
going to stand in judgment of anyone that has used a slap/spank to get the <br/>
attention of someone in the throes of hysteria.<br/>
<br/>
(For the record, I&#39;m not calling you or your post judgmental...just wanted to <br/>
make the above points.  Thanks.)<br/>

If spanking is so socially acceptable, why are we having this discussion?<br/>
You could draw this out to mean that clapping someone on the shoulder in<br/>
greeting is hitting. It&#39;s the same hand position. How about slapping someone<br/>
on the back if they&#39;re choking?  Why isn&#39;t that hitting? Does the intent to<br/>
inflict pain have to exist? Then, if someone accidentally swings around and<br/>
whacks someone in the face, since the intent wasn&#39;t there, it _wasn&#39;t_<br/>
hitting? Do you see how this is getting us nowhere? Honestly, a hearty<br/>
handshake has hurt me much more than that swat my mother gave me.<br/>

<br/>
Some very good points, Valerie...<br/>
<br/>
It is more socially acceptable to say &quot;We spank our children&quot; than it is to <br/>
say &quot;we hit our children&quot;....people think there is difference.  However they <br/>
are the same action....<br/>
clapping someone on the back in greeting is hitting with a friendly intent.  <br/>
There is not anything friendly about spanking/hitting no matter how good our <br/>
intentions are &quot;to teach them an important lesson about the dangerous world <br/>
we live in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just thoughts....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243936955">Valerie the original comment had nothing to do with A swat but had to do<br/>
with pulling down a child&#39;s pants and hitting until the hitter&#39;s hand hurt.<br/>
 Your comments came off as equating the swat you received as a<br/>
justification or understanding of how the other act was carried out.<br/>
