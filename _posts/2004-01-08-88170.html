It&#39;s too school-based for my tastes, and I don&#39;t like the way the kids treat <br/>

vicarious need to observe families (real or not) where people don&#39;t get along <br/>
as well.<br/>

Holly likes his dog, who sang &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; about bacon (because she knows <br/>
the song through her Depression and Fred Astaire interests).<br/>

This is one of my biggest beefs with finding beginning reader books. Lots of them are completely absorbed by the school scene, like Junie B. Jones, 1st Grader. We&#39;ve tended towards the more fantasy-based series like _Secrets of Droon_ because of this; well, and also because we tend to like that kind of stuff better anyway. &lt;g&gt; And I have always _hated_ the Berenstein Bears! I don&#39;t like the relationships they set up, and I remember them being extremely sexist!<br/>
<br/>
These are also the reasons that I&#39;m not wild about Arthur; plus, I don&#39;t like the way DW and Arthur treat each other. We really like Disney&#39;s PB&J Otter here--some good stuff in there for little ones and it models excellent family relationships with a stay at home mom who practices attachment parenting. My kids are also huge fans of Kim Possible!<br/>
<br/>
BTW--&quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; was the song dh and I danced to at our wedding, a duet by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. Great song!<br/>
