<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021009689">borrowing from Gatto here.<br/>
<br/>
John Gatto mentions the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin in one of <br/>
his online articles, and so I read it. The Autobio, that is. And <br/>
learned something that amazed me, though I did know it: Benjamin <br/>
Franklin wasn&#39;t brought up a printer. His father was a chandler who <br/>
scraped by, but filled his dinner table with conversation from <br/>
interesting people, and that is what Ben. Franklin grew up on: <br/>
working hard to help his dad with the candle shop, listening to <br/>
diverse, high quality adult conversation regularly, and he also <br/>
mentions being an early reader. But not so good at math. He taught <br/>
himself algebra at age 16.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Though Franklin advocated a system for educating all of <br/>
society, if he&#39;d taken a look around him, he would have seen <br/>
(according to Gatto&#39;s stats in his Big Book) a 94% literacy rate <br/>
amongst adults, and even among African slaves, an 80% literacy rate. <br/>
They were getting their education from parents who wanted their <br/>
children to be readers. In fact, wasn&#39;t it expected of parents, that <br/>
they would teach reading and math, along with the Family Trade.<br/>
<br/>
Those who displayed an ability in academics, went on to be scholars. <br/>
In fact, Franklin himself went to a clerical school for a year, but <br/>
the family couldn&#39;t afford it. The point I am drawing from this <br/>
is: &quot;those who displayed an ability in academics&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
IOW, not every single person in society got a formal education. Ben <br/>
Franklin&#39;s father recognized a scholarliness about the boy, and <br/>
wanted him to get some of that formal education. Didn&#39;t work out, and <br/>
he ended up starting a print shop, eh? <br/>
<br/>
So...diversity in society. Americans owned businesses, and children <br/>
learned the business from their parents, or were apprenticed to <br/>
businesses/trades. Because parents knew their responsibilities, <br/>
children learned to read and write, and do math...and learned the <br/>
things their parents did. A child with a bent towards learning <br/>
visually, might be spotted as a potential scholar, but not every <br/>
child was expected to be scholarly. Bookish.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think America had more doers then, than now? And that the <br/>
public school system has created a homogeneity that is unhealthy and <br/>
inhuman? And that homeschoolers who are willing to let their children <br/>
run on the road of their own choosing, are coming BACK to something <br/>
that we once had in abundance, and pushed away with generations of <br/>
our &quot;scientific method&quot; of educating?<br/>
<br/>
well, some thoughts, anyway<br/>

apprenticed to his brother (who was a printer) when he was 12. I just find<br/>
it so fascinating that he had such a desire to figure out how things work,<br/>
constantly questioning. I also love how he had so many phases in his life<br/>
and how much he did in his later years (especially back then when 60+ was<br/>
considered really old).<br/>
<br/>
I love how much he taught himself...including how to swim!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thing is, I had gone into that autobiography thinking that the <br/>
Founding FAthers were all classically educated, as youths, sitting at <br/>
their desks under tutors and being given Latin, Greek, etc. to learn. <br/>
Nope. Same with Geo. Washington. He didn&#39;t go to school until age 11, <br/>
and at that, he knew how to read and do his math. At age 11, he <br/>
entereed a course of trigonometry, and became the county surveyor at <br/>
age 17. His passion was horse riding, and he was athletic more than <br/>
bookish...which perfectly fit him for the position he was to take in <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
These guys lived their lives, learned how to do things from their <br/>
parents and other adults in the community, and taught themselves <br/>
whatever else caught their fancy. They weren&#39;t under the tutelage of <br/>
classics teachers. But I bet there were many amongst them who could <br/>
read Latin and Greek. <br/>
<br/>
They followed what they thought was interesting, and history calls <br/>
them great...because they were. The internal drive makes greatness. <br/>
Some people have that leadership in them. Some people are going to be <br/>
content earning their living, loving their kids, having some <br/>
enjoyable hobbies and interests without the push and the drive. Why <br/>
put every kid through the wringer, as if doing so would make them <br/>
great? ugh. <br/>
