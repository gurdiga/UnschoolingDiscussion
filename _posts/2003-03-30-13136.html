<div id="ygrps-yiv-326766781"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;There are times when I try to remember who the parent is.  When Dagny and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I are both cranky, and feeling bickery, I try to remember that I&#39;m the <br/>
parent, and I have more of a reserve of patience than she does.  I&#39;m the <br/>
parent, so I can step back and change how I&#39;m acting more easilythan she can. <br/>
 When Rowan wants me to get up for the hundredth time to get her something in <br/>
the kitchen, I remember that I&#39;m the parent, and she can&#39;t do everything she <br/>
wants to without asking for help.  I can make her feel good or bad about <br/>
that.  I&#39;m the parent, and I can choose to happily help her when she wants me <br/>
to.  When either one of them wants me to drop what I&#39;m doing to do something <br/>
with her, I remember that I&#39;m the parent of two kids who won&#39;t be kids <br/>
forever.  I remember that I don&#39;t want to miss one minute of being their <br/>
parent. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

That&#39;s such a WONDERFUL way to remember who the parent is.<br/>
