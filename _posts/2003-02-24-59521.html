<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have found the late reader stories very reassuring, but I wonder if there<br/>
&gt; are very many unschooling early readers?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine read his first little Hello Reader type book a month shy of his fifth<br/>
birthday, and was into chapter books within about 6 months.  I saw the same<br/>
kind of progression that unschoolers talk about, just earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who aren&#39;t taught to read seem to start to read when they want to, and<br/>
when they&#39;re ready just take off.  No waiting for the teacher to teach them<br/>
those hard words.  Tim&#39;s technique was to just skip anything he couldn&#39;t<br/>
figure out fast enough for his tastes.  Eventually he recognized writen<br/>
sounds fast enough that he could identify the word because he knew them<br/>
aurally, and didn&#39;t skip so many words.  He&#39;s 6 now, by the way, and hasn&#39;t<br/>
met anything he can&#39;t read, although he only survived 3 pages of one of his<br/>
father&#39;s beloved theology tomes before declaring it &quot;offensively boring&quot;.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The point to me wasn&#39;t when he read, but that he wasn&#39;t forced to learn to<br/>
read.  He learned happily, himself.  (We were in the process of moving<br/>
overseas.  Mom was frazzled.  Definitely no teaching going on here!)  Now I<br/>
see where Tim reads much the way I do.  Most days, he reads signs, the<br/>
funnies, some other parts of the newspaper, maybe a magazine article, and<br/>
that&#39;s about it.  Occasionally he reads a book.  Swallows it whole, more<br/>
like.  Never let the sun go down on your book is our motto!  But he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;Drop Everything And Read&quot; for 20 minutes, twice a day, as the school thinks<br/>
he should.  My mother told him about that, and how he should do that.  I<br/>
think that was a turning point for Tim and advice from my Mom.  He looked at<br/>
her like she was just bananas.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, yes, 8 or 10 may be average, but 16 is fine as is 3 like my friend&#39;s<br/>
son who learned to read when his older sister did; he just never bothered to<br/>
mention that he was listening to her reading lessons (a story in and of<br/>
itself, but I&#39;m goin&#39; to bed!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618222877">My first dd learned to read just before she turned 5.  The other just after<br/>
she turned 5. (both wanted to learn to read then) My first dd within few<br/>
short weeks could read about anything. She is 8 now.  My second who is only<br/>
6 now, spent several weeks learning how to read and can probably read on a<br/>
second grade level.  With both of them, after they got it, they had no<br/>
interest in reading any more.  They wanted to know *how* to read, learned,<br/>
and then went on with other things in life.  They do read board game spaces,<br/>
cereal boxes, real-life stuff they want to know, and some non-fiction<br/>
caption type stuff, but don&#39;t read books for entertainment.  I always<br/>
pictured them curled up in a chair reading a good book and loving it.  I<br/>
never imagined them strewing the books around the living room and using them<br/>
for beds for their stuffed animals.  BUT, they love books, they love to be<br/>
read to, and they know how to read.  I have learned to wait patiently for<br/>
the day to come when they want to read and curl up in a chair with a good<br/>
book.  It&#39;s been over 3 years now since my first dd learned to read.....I am<br/>
still waiting........trying to be patient......I know someday she will enjoy<br/>
it........she is only 8.............she hates to do anything unless she can<br/>
do it perfectly..........waiting........patiently................<br/>
 <br/>
My dh and I always have a book in our face (or a pc screen) it&#39;s inevitable<br/>
that she will too, eventually.  :0)<br/>
