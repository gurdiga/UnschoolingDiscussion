<div id="ygrps-yiv-600165983">for your gaming advice. I feel like a dolt not to think of either <br/>
CATCH or googling for Cincinnati! Duh! I can do both. Thanks <br/>
Sandra for posting the results of your search.<br/>
<br/>
We do have a place (Cincinnati Sci-Fi) that sells comics and <br/>
gaming stuff right nearby and I hadn&#39;t even imagined that kids <br/>
gather there to play1 Will check that out right away.<br/>
<br/>
The library is also a great idea. My kids are currently on the teen <br/>
board there and organize events all the time. Will suggest they <br/>
suggest organizing a night for gamers.<br/>
<br/>
This switch from one world (conservative Christian <br/>
homeschoolers) to the next is odd. &quot;Fallin&#39; off the sidewalk/My <br/>
lips move but I can&#39;t talk...&quot; (Bono, U2, &quot;Tryin&#39; to Throw Your Arms <br/>
Around the World&quot;) but I&#39;m getting there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your help.<br/>

If it weren&#39;t for being around my boys, I wouldn&#39;t know the secret lingo <br/>
enough to look things up.  &quot;CCG&quot; a long way. &lt;g&gt;  And the generic &quot;gaming&quot; is <br/>
likely to turn up sites where they do allow games playing right in the store.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; homeschoolers and now you don&#39;t?  <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What caused you to change?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the last year or two, my dh and I have undergone a signficant <br/>
change in how we see our faith. I becamse dissatisfied with <br/>
evangelical theology. I&#39;ve always been a person who had to <br/>
understand who was going to heaven and who wasn&#39;t. We were <br/>
missionaries for pete&#39;s sake. I went on a major search through <br/>
every possible permutation of how salvation theology has been <br/>
conceived and it led me to a place of less clarity and more <br/>
irritation with traditional teachings. That&#39;s led us out of church <br/>
and into a sort of spiritual no-man&#39;s land. We&#39;ve always been <br/>
arts focused and open to culture, too which is somewhat less <br/>
embraced in the homeschooling world we&#39;re in. <br/>
<br/>
At times I feel like I am in a foreign country at our homeschool <br/>
gatherings. My kids are passionate HP fans, for instance. My <br/>
11yos wore an HP t-shirt to our hoemschool co-op and got <br/>
openly ridiculed by his friends. One friend worried that he would <br/>
go to hell or become involved in witchcraft. Then my oldest (14 at <br/>
the time) in his ASL (sign language) class had to endure the <br/>
teacher skipping the lesson for the day to warn him against the <br/>
evils of HP since his mother didn&#39;t seem to understand how bad <br/>
the books were. This really riled me up. She and I got into it after <br/>
the class. An adult using her position of power to shame my kid <br/>
about something we totally approved in the home. Outrageous!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was most bugged that she took our one hour per week class <br/>
period and wasted it. And I was especially upset that my kdis <br/>
have been the focus of really harsh comments by friends who tell <br/>
them things like, &quot;How can you listen to a band that is going to <br/>
hell?&quot; (Metallica) or &quot;How can you be friends with a fag?&quot; to my <br/>
daughter who knows and loves some gay friends she has on the <br/>
Internet. This kind of thinking so upsets me that I can hardly <br/>
stand it.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ve been evangelical Christians for over twenty years. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t until the last three years when I started studying theology <br/>
that the conservative worldview of faith came crumbling down for <br/>
me. I started with Hans Kung (liberal Catholic) and have since <br/>
read Marcus Borg, Bishop Spong, Richard Holloway and others <br/>
who have rejected fundamentalism and have embraced a less <br/>
dogmatic view of faith. Not sure where we&#39;ll shake out in all this.<br/>
<br/>
My kids would love to make friends outside their current circle <br/>
(not to replace those kids completely but to have the chance to <br/>
share their passionate interests without ridicule). So that&#39;s what <br/>
prompted my question.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking.<br/>
Julie~~who probably wouldn&#39;t be invited back to speak at CHEO. <br/>

<br/>
Hey, even MY heathen kids know better than to do that!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s touching, that my kids are so considerate of Christian <br/>
homeschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
One day a big family came over unexpectedly.  I was in the kitchen cooking <br/>
and cleaning.  I thought that was plenty respectable!  But Marty, who was 13 <br/>
and pretty disdainful of religion, came over and subtly turned down and then <br/>
off the &quot;Chef Aid&quot; South Park CD I was listening to.<br/>
<br/>
Good thinking, Marty!<br/>
<br/>
And there are lots of videos and music we will turn off for the sake of <br/>
homeschooling kids.  <br/>
<br/>
One day I was in the car, though, listening to the oldies station, and I <br/>
notice in the rearview mirror there&#39;s a hushed but fast conversation going on <br/>
between Holly and a friend of hers, who&#39;s covering her ears, but still trying <br/>
to hear Holly&#39;s questions.<br/>
<br/>
The song which was too offensive for her was &quot;Under the Boardwalk.&quot;  But <br/>
she&#39;s too respectful of adults to ask me to turn that horribly nasty song off <br/>
in her Christian presence.<br/>
<br/>
It was a dilemma for her.  It was an irritation for me, because musically <br/>
&quot;Under the Boardwalk is wonderful.   But it does say &quot;we&#39;ll be making love,&quot; <br/>
and she couldn&#39;t hear that phrase without the taint of sin.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week we were babysitting kids from a Christian family.  Holly <br/>
and Kirby needed to leave to go to a Harry Potter tournament.  Holly didn&#39;t <br/>
want to say &quot;Harry Potter&quot; to them.  Their mom came later than Holly&#39;s <br/>
leaving time.  I said &quot;HOLLY, it&#39;s your house.  Say &#39;We&#39;re going to play <br/>
Harry Potter now--see ya.&#39;&quot;   but she thought it would be mean.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;How can you listen to a band that is going to <br/>
hell?&quot; (Metallica) or &quot;How can you be friends with a fag?&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yeeks!<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; fag friends are altogether worth more in our lives than the <br/>
Christian homeschooling families who make it hard to just listen to an oldies <br/>
station in peace.<br/>
<br/>
At my house I don&#39;t listen to other parents&#39; rules about food or TV.  I won&#39;t <br/>
leave the TV off because one kid or another isn&#39;t allowed to watch it at <br/>
home.  My kids are kinder than I am, and although Holly once was very grumpy <br/>
because she wanted to watch the Simpsons but didn&#39;t (her choice) because a <br/>
kid from a &quot;Simpsons is Evil&quot; family was over, they&#39;re really generous of <br/>
spirit when it comes to kids who are vegetarian, or who don&#39;t like guns, or <br/>
whatever else it might be.<br/>
<br/>
How could they become so kindhearted without Jesus?  <br/>
It happens.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL. Yeah he learned. Honestly it waw back near the beginning <br/>
of the HP craze and it hadn&#39;t even occured to my son that there <br/>
would be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Just to set the record straight, my 11yos best friend found an <br/>
article that showed that HP had Christian allegorical content and <br/>
clipped it for him. That was about two years later but it seems <br/>
that knowing our kids over time has helped them to find room in <br/>
this group.<br/>
<br/>
And my kids don&#39;t play their music with kids who wouldn&#39;t like it. <br/>
But sometimes when they &quot;talk music&quot; they share about their <br/>
favorite groups... so that&#39;s how that comes up.<br/>
<br/>
Your heathen kids sound very Christlike. :)<br/>

You&#39;re suggesting they didn&#39;t learn to be nice from me.<br/>
At least you couched it politely.<br/>

Had you met me or my children, I think your attitude would be different.<br/>
<br/>
I have no interest in catching flies.<br/>
I do have a great interest in unschooling, though, and in helping maintain <br/>
online unschooling help for new families who come along to learn about life <br/>
changes that help natural learning thrive.<br/>

I&#39;m amused by the Christian support of Lord of the Rings, so parallel to <br/>
their total villification of Harry Potter.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder whether it&#39;s not, in part, because Harry Potter is written by a <br/>
single mother, but LotR was written by a married man.  Seriously.  Because <br/>
there&#39;s not all that much difference otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I suppose, Harry Potter has a child as a main character.  <br/>
<br/>
So while LotR is a man writing manly things about men (if Hobbits and elves <br/>
can be very manly), and HP is a woman letting a child have the best lines, at <br/>
the expense of his horrible aunt and uncle.<br/>

From every indication I&#39;ve gotten from your first hand accounts as well as <br/>

I agree with that.  We are Christian but do not attend a church.  Have <br/>
visited many but not found one that &quot;felt right&quot; so we don&#39;t go.  And I <br/>
believe that children can pick that up like anything else and don&#39;t need <br/>
&quot;Sunday School&quot; for that either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468891854">&lt;&lt;&lt;My 11yos wore an HP t-shirt to our hoemschool co-op and got openly ridiculed by his friends. One friend worried that he would <br/>
go to hell or become involved in witchcraft. ??<br/>
<br/>
Oh, dear, a similar thing happened to us, after church yesterday. We were chatting to another family, and my 13 yo was talking to the 11 yo of that family. They were discussing computer games. Ds  said he was playing Wolfenstein. The other  boy said this was an eil game and shouldnt be p&#39;layed. Ds asked why it was evil - the only reply he got was that it was and it wasn&#39;t suitable....My son thought it was good that he hadn&#39;t mentioned playing Quake and Doom on the PS!...I find we love the liturgy of the Latin Mass that we attend, but are often poles apart in other ways from our fellow church goers... But I am trying to  be more open and friendly when we differ....Leonie W. <br/>

elder&#39;s orders/requests and go off on adventures against the evil<br/>
ones. <br/>
<br/>
In Harry Potter the adults in charge can be the evil ones. And the<br/>
kids in the story question their actions, show up their foibles, and<br/>
disobey all the time. The children in Harry Potter think and<br/>
question and act on their own initiative. J.K. Rowling writes about<br/>
the real life dynamic of schooling and kids and coercion. Tolkien&#39;s<br/>
worlds are all beautiful scenery and fighting different kinds of<br/>
magical bad guys who in any christian  story would be called the<br/>
devil.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter scares the hell out of fundamentalists because it<br/>
clearly shows their version of control up for the farce that it is<br/>
and ridicules it in language a six year old can understand. <br/>

Harry Potter as an anti Fundamentalist (of any religion) Manifesto.<br/>

there were probably a slew of nay-sayers for THAT activity, too.<br/>

Harry Potter will last as long as POGS lasted, or maybe a bit longer. <br/>
The Christian response should be &quot;Hmmm, a fairy tale.&quot; and read it to <br/>
see what&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad about it. And then if they want to, <br/>
let their kids read it, and then discuss it with them.<br/>

I think the same still stands, but I&quot;m not a moderator and not the list owner of this one!!<br/>
<br/>
LOL, so sorry <br/>
<br/>

  I just have a quick question.  I&#39;m a new subscriber to the list (referred by<br/>
  a fellow unschooler from another list) and wondered if Christians are<br/>
  welcome here.  Maybe I just joined at a bad time?<br/>
<br/>
  Not that I&#39;m not used to being between a rock and a hard place.  We&#39;ve found<br/>
  as a general rule Christians don&#39;t accept us because we&#39;re Unschoolers<br/>
  (that&#39;s Pagan, you know *rolls eyes heavenward*) and Unschoolers don&#39;t<br/>
  accept us because we&#39;re Christians...which I can partially understand<br/>
  because of the wackos who go around bombing clinics and murdering doctors.<br/>
  Who wouldn&#39;t have a tainted view of us?<br/>
<br/>
  My kids love Harry Potter, watch Pokemon every night at 9 on Cartoon<br/>
  Network, and are busily learning Elvish these days as a result of our<br/>
  current obsession with LOTR.  I don&#39;t give a flying fig whether JK Rowling<br/>
  is a Christian or a Pagan, or an Atheist.  She&#39;s a damn fine author and her<br/>
  books have my 11 year old reading like there&#39;s no tomorrow.  And yes, I&#39;ve<br/>
  had all of the hellfire and brimstone warnings about my children&#39;s certain<br/>
  descent into witchcraft and all things horrible because of HP.  But I was<br/>
  raised in a Christian home and my reading was not monitored.  My parents<br/>
  felt that nothing was more important than developing a love of reading and<br/>
  nothing more dangerous than squelching a child&#39;s interest in reading by<br/>
  restricting them in some way.  I read some things that were deemed<br/>
  *questionable* in my day, and guess what?  I&#39;m not an ax murderer.  I am in<br/>
  fact, quite normal and still a believer in my faith.<br/>
<br/>
  Ok, so now that I&#39;ve gone on too long, I will just promise not to preach or<br/>
  thump my Bible at anyone.  I can live with the stereotypes, I&#39;ve seen Pat<br/>
  Robertson and Jerry Fallwell in action too many times, so I understand where<br/>
  all of the ideas about Christians come from.  I just don&#39;t want to make<br/>
  anyone uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!  :o)<br/>

  They like proof that Satan is vying for souls.  Something to point at.<br/>
