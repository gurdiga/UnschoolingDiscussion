<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420575320">Hello again listmates-<br/>
I am on the digest form of reception of this list, and, for some reason, my<br/>
computer crashed twice trying to open it up today! And, I know there were<br/>
some heartfelt responses to my request for help/ideas/support regarding my<br/>
precious son, Bay. A few of you wrote me directly and mentioned other folks<br/>
suggestions. I&#39;m going nuts not being able to read all the wealth of ideas<br/>
that I know you kind folks offered! So, if you did respond to my post of<br/>
yesterday, would you do me the HUGE favor of resending your email to me<br/>
personally (so we don&#39;t clog up the list with repeated ideas). I will be<br/>
greatly appreciative. Hope that I can return the favor someday. I&#39;ll post<br/>
again after reading people&#39;s ideas.<br/>
Eagerly awaiting your responses.<br/>
Mahalo and aloha, Lee<br/>
