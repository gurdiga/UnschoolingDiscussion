<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200860450">Thanks to a query I received I went to the Oprah website.  It says<br/>
today&#39;s Oprah is &quot;Letters to Oprah Live&quot; so hsing&#39;s moment of glory may<br/>
be at hand!!!<br/>
<br/>
The site, however, did not mention hsing specifically.  Thought it<br/>
better to be safe than sorry - PLEASE share the word with your other<br/>
lists...I&#39;ll be doing my best from this end!<br/>
<br/>
It has been shared with several people that this coverage is in response<br/>
to a deluge of letters the show received, as well as recommendations<br/>
from Oprah&#39;s studio audience.  Some at NHEN have discussed that no<br/>
matter what type of job Oprah does with the topic - good, bad, or<br/>
indifferent - it would behoove us to send another deluge of letters!<br/>
Rumor has it that Oprah didn&#39;t know anything about homeschooling prior<br/>
to letters and recommendations -- maybe if she sees us rally again it<br/>
could lead to further coverage as she seems to have a soft spot for<br/>
education in general.<br/>
<br/>
The website address is www.oprah.com.<br/>
