How does auditing work? It was my impression that by auditing, you just <br/>
showed up for the class and participated, but received no grade, paid no fees, etc. <br/>
But then I heard that you DO still pay the tuition, etc. but receive no <br/>
grade. Does it vary by college? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Ummmmm.....it helps if you&#39;re best friends with the professor! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Patrick is a good friend. He&#39;s been offering to let us sit in on his classes <br/>
for years. We finally took him up on it.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick&#39;s a high school drop-out (tenth grade, eventually took the GED). He <br/>
enlisted in the army (he learned Czech & was a spy); he got an undergraduate <br/>
degree, went on for his Masters, and is ABD for his PhD in Sociology. He&#39;s a <br/>
huge John Holt fan. He is required by the University to give grades----so he asks <br/>
the students to tell him what they think they deserve! &lt;g&gt; As long as they <br/>
show up and do the work (minimal!), he gives them A&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
Cool Prof!<br/>
<br/>
I told Cameron that, if he were interested in actually going for a grade and <br/>
credits later this semester (for the &quot;some college&quot; answer), we would sign him <br/>
up in Patrick&#39;s other class. <br/>
<br/>
So I have no real answer for auditting----just our route right now.<br/>
