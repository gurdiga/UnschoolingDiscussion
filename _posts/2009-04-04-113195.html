<div id="ygrps-yiv-487418844">The weather is getting nice and it&#39;s time to get outdoors. The children are ready to go with tons of energy!  Let them bike or hike this energy away  in a hike-bike event during the week of May 24th through the 30th. Pick a day and time, advertise for other homeschoolers/unschoolers to join you in the newspaper or your group, and have fun while the children burn the excess energy off and enjoy the great outdoors!<br/>
<br/>
Not hard to do and a fun and nature filled day! See many new plants beginning to grow, find some animal tracks, identify rocks and trees while you bike or hike! Can be as along as hours or as short as you want!<br/>
<br/>
No group around to do this with/ ask a friends family and so one on your own.<br/>
<br/>
See our website for a press release and more information!<br/>
