&lt;&lt; I am currently in the process of becoming<br/>
 a La Leche League leader.  My attitude towards breastfeeding has changed<br/>
 and grown considerably over the last few years.  While I am more aware than<br/>
 ever why breastfeeding is so important I have become less judgemental. <br/>
 While I use to say to my daughter whenever we saw a bottle feeding baby,<br/>
 &quot;poor baby has to drink from a bottle and can&#39;t have mommy&#39;s milk,&quot; I am<br/>
 more aware of people having circumstances that I know nothing about.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Thanks for your post.  I think you&#39;ve hit upon the essence of the matter.  <br/>
Yes, human milk is best for human babies.  It can not be duplicated.  <br/>
However, everyone&#39;s circumstances are different and for some people it is not <br/>
the best option.  And you&#39;re right - those circumstances are not something <br/>
that others can know anything about by observation.  They are deeply <br/>
personal.  For some women, like me, it may be impossible to breastfeed.  Not <br/>
all geographical locations have milk banks upon which to draw.  Some women <br/>
may not be comfortable with using milk from a milk bank.  Some women may be <br/>
physically capable of producing milk but it may not be best for Mom or Baby <br/>
to use that ability; e.g. Mom is taking necessary meds that would be harmful <br/>
to baby, or Mom has a different problem that makes nursing unsafe for her.    <br/>
There could be other circumstances as well, as  Buzz pointed out in her <br/>
thoughtful post.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the spirit of your post and I think it&#39;s great that you&#39;re <br/>
becoming a LLL leader.  (BTW, I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t point and say &quot;poor baby&quot; <br/>
anymore.  If anyone pointed at my Josie and said that I would be deeply <br/>
offended and also somewhat amused - she&#39;s definitely a happy, thriving girl <br/>
that doesn&#39;t fit the &quot;poor baby&quot; bill! )  Your post has helped me feel less <br/>
animosity towards what I used to call the Lactation Police.  A shift in <br/>
thinking is almost always a difficult, but productive thing.  I&#39;m glad to be <br/>
able to broaden my viewpoint.  <br/>
