<br> I suppose it is possible that others would follow the &quot;mean one&quot; to a different server? As I said I do not know how it all works.   &quot;Good friend&quot; does need to be confronted that he must acknowledge that so long as he participates with mean one blocking your son then he may as well be blocking him himself. <br>
<br></div>Is it possible the mum meant that more than one game was going on simultaneously and your son was not participating in all of them?<br><br></div>vicki....who is not of the school of thought that children need to always work out their &quot;squabbles&quot; without adult intervention.<br>

 calls and he would be the one that could block or not the others.

 daughter that she did not have to play with someone when she did not want to but that sometimes her friend(s) may want to not play with her . Or take a break.

 almost like jokes or punishment for in-game offenses. &nbsp;I hear them joking with friends- oh, you&#39;re blocked! &nbsp;(After a friend traps them or some other trolly activity) and they actually do block each other and unblock eachother regularly on Skype. &nbsp;</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>It is different when you know the kids in real life. &nbsp;It can get more sensitive. &nbsp;It&#39;s easier to take it personally. &nbsp;I encourage my kids to reach out via text or phone when something is uncertain in-game. &nbsp;I help them to choose friendly, inclusive wording. &nbsp;Sometimes I get on the Skype call myself and talk with the other kids, especially for my 5 year old. I&#39;ll say, hi I want to help clarify what&#39;s going on here. &nbsp;Are you all upset with Gianni about something specific? &nbsp;And they usually tell me yes, he&#39;s screaming too loudly or he&#39;s breathing into the mic, or he&#39;s trying to control the game. &nbsp;Then I can help Gianni
 communicate his frustrations. &nbsp;Then we decide if he&#39;d rather get off the call and do something else or if he can stop screaming because it&#39;s really bothering the other kids.</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>In your son&#39;s situation, have you observed anything that triggers the call block? &nbsp;Is your son the server owner? &nbsp;Does he have higher &quot;powers&quot; than the others? &nbsp;Does he dole out ranks to his friends? &nbsp;I&#39;ve noticed that can trigger resentment. &nbsp; &nbsp;Can he think of a reason the other child might be upset with him? &nbsp;If he knows these children in real life, is this behavior a pattern for the boy who is blocking him? &nbsp;My kids often feel better after a discussion analyzing what might be happening for that other child. &nbsp;Is he jealous of the other friendships? &nbsp;Jealous he gets to own the server? &nbsp;Frustrated about something? &nbsp;How can your son stay in relationship with this child and still
 feel happy himself? &nbsp;Is there anything he can do to repair the rapport? &nbsp;</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div>Ali</div><div><br clear="none"></div><div><br clear="none"></div><div><br clear="none"></div><div><br clear="none"></div><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote type="cite">
