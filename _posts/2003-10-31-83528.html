and voices in my head.**<br/>
<br/>
I think the casting for HP was great, especially the 3 friends.  (Even <br/>
if Ron isn&#39;t tall with a long nose.)<br/>
<br/>
I will be sad if they recast any of those parts before finishing the 7th <br/>
movie.  But it&#39;s possible that the actors will start to look too old.<br/>

One of the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern actors (Gary Oldman) is going to <br/>
be Sirius Black in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/>

Well, there&#39;s going to be at least four HP movies.  They just recently choose the new director for Goblet of Fire.<br/>

From Sci-Fi Wire:<br/>
<br/>
Mike Newell, the British director of Four Weddings and a Funeral, will direct the fourth Harry Potter movie, Warner Brothers Pictures announced officially over the weekend, the Associated Press reported. Newell will begin work on Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in April 2004, the wire service reported.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the third film in the series, is currently in production under the direction of Alfonso Cuaron, and the studio said that as the two productions will overlap, it was not feasible for him to direct both, the wire service reported.<br/>
<br/>
Newell, 61, also directed Donnie Brasco and recently completed Mona Lisa Smile with Julia Roberts, the AP reported.<br/>
