 The REAL Santa is in your heart where you can carry him for as long as you <br/>
 want.  It&#39;s the magical spirit of make believe that somehow comes true.  <br/>
It&#39;s <br/>
 many things wrapped into one. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I agree with this. BUT, that does not equal telling my kids that a fat <br/>
guy in a suit really comes and leaves stuff.<br/>
I am very vague and play into the magic when they&#39;re young, but when they ask <br/>
questions I am also honest.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

not enough to ask.  Too much excitement and fun I suspect. <br/>
