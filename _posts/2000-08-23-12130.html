<div id="ygrps-yiv-280883165">Hi guys,<br/>
<br/>
Zack will be 8 in a couple of weeks, and I sure could use some birthday gift <br/>
suggestions.  He&#39;s a TV/Nintendo junkie and he also loves the computer, but I <br/>
don&#39;t want every gift to be a computer or Nintendo game.  He&#39;s taking ice <br/>
skating lessons and group music classes.  He&#39;s always been interested in <br/>
space and aviation.  He still likes Pokemon.  He&#39;s a beginning reader, but <br/>
vastly prefers being read to.  He does not like sports, or building things <br/>
like Legos.  <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?  Any particular games or toys your children have enjoyed?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Carron</div>
