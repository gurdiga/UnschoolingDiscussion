Thanks.<br/>
It&#39;s original to me, but it&#39;s the second time I&#39;ve used it.  Once was in the <br/>
forum, I think.  Or maybe it was in private e-mail, come to think of it...  <br/>

you&#39;re at, I struggled with that one myself. I went through yadda yadda yadda <br/>
and I learned yadda yadda yadda and now we never make the kids eat ice cream. <br/>
It has worked wonders.&quot;  This would allow her more space to listen, think it <br/>
over, try it on for size, keep it or discard it. And I&#39;m not taking time and <br/>
energy from my own life to fix/change someone else&#39;s, but opening up my <br/>
heart/life/history to share with another human. <br/>
<br/>
But if I said, &quot;Well, the first thing you need to do is stop trying to <br/>
make them eat vanilla.&quot; that has an entirely different tone. I think it&#39;s <br/>
truth, but it doesn&#39;t allow the personal respect and freedom. And as the <br/>
counselors say, it&#39;s about using more *I* statements and less *you* <br/>
statements.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She might not know kids don&#39;t HAVE to eat ice cream at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>She might not, but apparently if she&#39;s come to this forum, she&#39;s aware of <br/>
*something*. She&#39;s already on the track to finding out that there&#39;s more out <br/>
there than she was previously aware of. She&#39;s probably looking for info that <br/>
someone has selflessly shared about their own life, knowledge and truth. If <br/>
she&#39;s looking, it doesn&#39;t need to be forced on her, if she&#39;s not, no amount <br/>
of forcing will matter. Same as with unschooling.  <br/>

to get you to change your mind. But people are really just trying to<br/>
understand. This philosophy raises a lot of questions and basically you&#39;re<br/>
the only one who can answer them.<br/>
<br/>
The philosophy seems to be saying in a way what the Indian greeting<br/>
&quot;Namaste&quot; says: &quot;I honor that place in you where the whole Universe resides.<br/>
And when I am in that place in me and you are in that place in you, there is<br/>
only one of us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can see how getting people to a place where they can feel that everyone&#39;s<br/>
soul is equal would be a peacefilled place. I can see respecting that people<br/>
are where they are because their journey has been much different. I can see<br/>
how someone feeling pride that their position is superior to other people&#39;s<br/>
could make the prideful person stop growing and self-examining.<br/>
<br/>
I can see that judgementalism and pride can lead to some unhealthy places.<br/>
But I&#39;m not seeing how eliminating judgementalism and pride -- if that&#39;s<br/>
what this philosophy is about -- doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s own pitfalls. (Which is<br/>
all that people are asking in their own way.)<br/>
<br/>
How would your philosophy handle abusive, hurtful parenting and nurturing<br/>
parenting? I can&#39;t see how one isn&#39;t better than the other. How can eating<br/>
food not be better than eating sand? How can music not be better than<br/>
fingernails on a chalkboard?<br/>
<br/>
Too often, I think, people judge things on a limited number of factors, eg,<br/>
a more expensive bigger house is better than a less expensive smaller house.<br/>
Yet there are hundreds of factors that could make the smaller house more<br/>
suitable in a particular situation. How does the philosophy avoid<br/>
acknowledging that more suitable isn&#39;t better? That pros outweighing cons<br/>
isn&#39;t better?<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes one factor is all it takes, eg, a family style that creates<br/>
loving people versus one that creates hatefilled people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very confused and just trying to understand.<br/>

There is no cosmic right or wrong.  That is something we humans have <br/>

(which are really factors of him/it/....) are what is used to do that.<br/>
I&#39;m sure lovemary will correct any misconceptions I may have gotten <br/>

&gt; How would your philosophy handle abusive, hurtful parenting and <br/>
nurturing<br/>
&gt; parenting? I can&#39;t see how one isn&#39;t better than the other. How can <br/>
eating<br/>
&gt; food not be better than eating sand? How can music not be better <br/>
than<br/>
&gt; fingernails on a chalkboard?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Too often, I think, people judge things on a limited number of <br/>
factors, eg,<br/>
&gt; a more expensive bigger house is better than a less expensive <br/>
smaller house.<br/>
&gt; Yet there are hundreds of factors that could make the smaller house <br/>
more<br/>
&gt; suitable in a particular situation. How does the philosophy avoid<br/>
&gt; acknowledging that more suitable isn&#39;t better? That pros <br/>
outweighing cons<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t better?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But sometimes one factor is all it takes, eg, a family style that <br/>
creates<br/>
&gt; loving people versus one that creates hatefilled people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very confused and just trying to understand.<br/>

<br/>
This topic reminds me of Zen and the Art of Motorcyle Maintenance, the<br/>
topic of the whole book was quality/goodness/arete/virtue, chose your own<br/>
term. A basic idea, as I recall,  was that we naturally know quality when<br/>
we see it, even if we can&#39;t define why something is good. Somewhere were<br/>
the lines: &quot;And what is good, Phaedrus? And what is not good? Need we ask<br/>
anyone to tell us these things?&quot; I think it&#39;s true, and I think it ties<br/>
in to unschooling - we naturally see good, know what is right, learn what<br/>
we need...<br/>

(I forget who) that it would be dishonest to have this belief. It is not at <br/>
all threatening to have someone disagree with me  . . . just dont tell me I <br/>
am dishonest and pretending. Because that is discounting my feelings and <br/>
beliefs and telling me I am wrong for them, in my perception.<br/>

Posts can be read assuming any type of tone.  Try printing a few posts<br/>
sometime and reading them aloud with different accents, emphasis, and<br/>
emotion.  Most posts lend themselves to a very WIDE range of<br/>
interpretation.  It&#39;s an interesting drama exercise.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Here&#39;s an analogy of sorts, &quot;I like cookies and cream ice cream.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; really good and they just should stop making all those other flavors<br/>
&gt; because this is the one I like best and that means everyone should like<br/>
&gt; it best too.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s an analogy that actually works:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;My kids cry every time I give them ice cream; it&#39;s not working for us; I<br/>
&gt; have to make them eat ice cream; I finally found this website and would like<br/>
&gt; ideas for how to make my kids eat vanilla ice cream.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the answers will NOT be ways to make them eat vanilla ice cream.<br/>
&gt; That would be HELPING the mom, not affirming her dead-end-rut problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She might not know there are other flavors.<br/>
&gt; She might not know kids don&#39;t HAVE to eat ice cream at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there&#39;s a bit of confusion here between a general case (people crying<br/>
about schooling not working) and a specific case (Bridget posting about<br/>
how she<br/>
homeschools).  Nobody in Bridget&#39;s family was crying or bent out of<br/>
shape, as<br/>
far as we could tell.  (Although some of them might not have been<br/>
getting as<br/>
many hours of television as they wanted. ;-)   )<br/>
<br/>
Based on what Bridget originally posted, the analogy would be that she<br/>
asks her<br/>
children to eat a certain amount of leafy greens every week, but that<br/>
she lets<br/>
them decide whether to eat ice cream for breakfast and greens for<br/>
dessert, or<br/>
vice-versa.<br/>
<br/>
And then, some of us told Bridget we don&#39;t think ice cream should be<br/>
leafy and<br/>
green.  (Unschooling doesn&#39;t normally have writing requirements.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a leap was made in assuming that Bridget&#39;s children must dislike<br/>
the way<br/>
their learning is (lightly) organized?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there was a blurring of the particular into the general?  I gather that<br/>
Sandra&#39;s intention is to address the general case, in order to provide<br/>
information that is generally helpful to the list as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
However, when one post replies to another, quotes it, AND addresses some<br/>
details of that original posters family life, THEN all the paragraphs<br/>
that come<br/>
next SEEM to be personal.<br/>
<br/>
We may need some kind of &quot;road sign&quot; or flag or punctuation mark that shows<br/>
when the comment changes from advice for one person to philosophy for the<br/>
general audience.<br/>
