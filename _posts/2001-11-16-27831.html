<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would hope that discussions about unschooling would be heavily involved <br/>
with point making.  I really think discussions of people with opinions they <br/>
can back up are more valuable than just idle chit chat with no intent to <br/>
inform or influence others in the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I think some people are more comfortable with &quot;discussions&quot; that go this way:<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen the news of Aghanistan?<br/>
A bird is in the yard!<br/>
Yes, the sun just came out.<br/>
My son hates to read.<br/>
We love our new church.<br/>
When I was little we lived near a church.<br/>
The bird is splashing in the water.<br/>
<br/>
No disagreements.<br/>
Also no information, and no learning.<br/>
<br/>
And I think there are people who would love for online discussions to all be <br/>
this way:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I keep my child from wearing red because it disturbs me and I&#39;m sure it <br/>
would eventually disturb him, and if I let him wear red, I know he would wear <br/>
nothing but red every day for the rest of his life.&quot;<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re such a good mom!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Nobody knows your son like you do.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll stop letting my son wear red too.&quot;<br/>
&quot;What about daughters?&quot;<br/>
&quot;How old was he when you realized wearing red was the source of all his <br/>
learning problems?&quot;<br/>
&quot;What about pink?  Maroon?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Your son is so lucky to have you as a mom!&quot;<br/>
&quot;I wish I had kept my son from wearing red.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Red is the color of Satan, so you&#39;re intuitively a good mom and your child <br/>
will live forever.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Red sets up a vibration of agitation, but there is an aromatherapy antidote.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Oh, thank you!&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m so glad I came here to discuss this!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Yes, I love these deep, heartfelt discussions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think when a person goes so far  as to take children out of school AND they <br/>
reject the nicely packaged curriculum and traditional schedule and behaviors <br/>
AND they have found unschooling.com (which I realize some on this list still <br/>
have not, but it&#39;s there, nevertheless, and I hope it&#39;s listed on the <br/>
yahoogroups main page for this list), they are probably ready to REALLY <br/>
honestly discuss things of importance to their children&#39;s futures.  And lots <br/>
of people here and on the forum are unhappy and scared and on the verge of <br/>
giving up unschooling so they can&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
We can be la-la supportive of bad ideas along with the good.  We can send <br/>
them elsewhere for real information.  Or we can discuss issues and compare <br/>
results and offer alternatives and options and we can brainstorm.  Learning <br/>
doesn&#39;t take place as well in a still, quiet, near-sleep state as it does in <br/>
a more active, aroused, alert state.  <br/>
<br/>
If a person has NO new thoughts to think, no new phases for their children to <br/>
pass through, no questions whatsoever about hobbies or resources or <br/>
unschooling practicalities, then they don&#39;t need the opinions they can find <br/>
here.  Maybe they just came to chat.  If by chat they mean &quot;be totally <br/>
supported and never questioned,&quot; they just came to the wrong list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502742302">Great analogy, Sandra.<br/>
I, for one, appreciate reading your thoughts and opinions on various <br/>
topics, unschooling or not.<br/>
(Is anything NOT related in some way to unschooling?)<br/>
My 2 cents.<br/>

can choose not to read them.  So far it hasn&#39;t bothered me enough to stop.<br/>
<br/>
I also enjoy reading Lynda&#39;s posts.  Lots to chew on there.<br/>
<br/>
I also enjoy reading most of Bridget&#39;s posts.  She often gives me something <br/>
new to think about.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m really tired of reading is the bickering.  I remember my mother&#39;s <br/>
fave thing to say when me sister and I were bickering.  &quot;I&#39;m going to knock <br/>
your heads together.&quot;  Sometimes I&#39;d like to do a cyber head-knocking <br/>
around here.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but do you really think that moms who report signs of crabbiness and<br/>
unhappiness from kids who are getting a lot of screen time are being as silly as<br/>
moms who don&#39;t want their kids to wear red?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there really is a bad vibe that some people can feel coming from cathode<br/>
ray tubes.  **Are you 100% prepared to dismiss as goofy the observations of<br/>
parents who find TV viewing time influences their child&#39;s behavior?<br/>
<br/>
I realize there is a big brainwashing in our culture about TV being evil, but the<br/>
fact that some propaganda exists does not in itself prove that no criticism of<br/>
television is true and that television viewing is always benign.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; There y&#39;go.  Evil TV made you unreasonably afraid of TV.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kids should  never sit as close to TVs as moms are sitting next to computer<br/>
&gt; screens right this second.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the reasons for my &quot;evil screen&quot; theory is that my husband&#39;s computer<br/>
screen has a sickening flicker.  After just a few minutes it drives me to<br/>
distraction AND makes me feel terrible.  (But... I self regulate by not using<br/>
his computer.)<br/>
