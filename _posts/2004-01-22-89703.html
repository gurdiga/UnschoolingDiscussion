<div id="ygrps-yiv-188855425">I agree. When I saw the comments below I actually went to check to see how <br/>
long this person had been on the list. <br/>
Matt posted a few weeks ago wanting the work with unschoolers. Since then he <br/>
has offered his services for portfolios in Maine (which we need I might add).  <br/>
I dont know the man but I know he doesn&#39;t much deserve the response he <br/>
received.  Sudbury schools have been discussed on this list many times. <br/>
<br/>
Do I think that we should promote all unschoolers going to these schools? No, <br/>
but I do think it is knowledge that we all would have knowing the school may <br/>
exist. Someday someone may be seeking a Sudbury school for their extenuating <br/>
circumstances and we would know there may be another in New England. <br/>
From what I understood from an email I have sent to him the school would <br/>
house the parent/s also.<br/>
Knowledge is good, guessing ones motives and blasting him on such a list with <br/>
lack of information is sad to me.  He may not have all the answers but he <br/>
seems to be offering an alternative for those who may choose a regular school.  I <br/>
too with one child or a different lifestyle may seriously consider a free <br/>

If the list owners hadn&#39;t wanted it on there it wouldn&#39;t have been, because <br/>
that post was in the &quot;to be approved&quot; pile, and was sent through to the list.   <br/>
So people who can&#39;t think of something nice to say should maybe consider not <br/>
saying anything at all, particularly in the case of people who didn&#39;t read the <br/>
original post carefully or who didn&#39;t know a &quot;Sudbury&quot; from  a military <br/>

How about if you tell us a little bit more?  How did<br/>
you come to this idea?  How can you do it so<br/>
inexpensively?  What is different about your planned<br/>
school from other Sudbury schools?  Would families<br/>
have to move to the area in order to work off the<br/>
tuition you mentioned?<br/>

I&#39;m not interested for my own kids, since unschooling<br/>

can point that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371562540">Hi, everyone!  I&#39;m new here.  I&#39;m not exactly sure how long I&#39;ve <br/>
been &quot;lurking around&quot; this site.  I&#39;m interested in a few things that <br/>
are being discussed, so I&#39;m going to take my chances and dive in.  <br/>
Considering the conversations of late, I figure I&#39;m safe.  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure what I&#39;m supposed to learn about the accepted behavior on the <br/>
list, but I&#39;m sure that wasn&#39;t it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you a little about myself.  I don&#39;t consider myself an <br/>
unschooler by definition.  I am more interested in the concept and <br/>
would like to learn more about it.  A fellow home schooling friend of <br/>
20+ years discovered your group and forwarded it to me.  That <br/>
explains how I ended up here.<br/>
<br/>
I am the mother in a combined family of seven children.  It&#39;s a long <br/>
story, but I home school the youngest, Adrian.  He will be 10 next <br/>
month.  Our other children are as follows:  Tabitha, 18; Amy, 17.5; <br/>
Tammi and Tracey, 16; Amie, 14 in March; and Andrew, 12.  I am <br/>
biological mother to Amy and Adrian.  If you do the math, you will <br/>
see that there is about 8 years between them.  By the time I got into <br/>
home schooling, he was the only one left to focus on.  The rest of <br/>
the kids are not mine biologically, and I never found a loop hole to <br/>
allow it legally.  At this point it&#39;s irrelevant since four of them <br/>
will graduate in the next year and a half.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m active in two local home school groups and belong to two more.  I <br/>
enjoy the freedom of home schooling and am SO happy that it found <br/>
me.  I look forward to picking your brains and having pleasant <br/>
conversations with you all.  I don&#39;t have much of a clue about any of <br/>
this.  So, I hope this is a place where I will be able to ask <br/>
questions and learn from them.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to conversing with you all...<br/>
<br/>

unschoolers in a setting that was not traditional school. <br/>
<br/>
 Atlanta has a very nice climate, not the extremes of Maine.  There <br/>
was no way we could make it work for less than about 5 grand per year <br/>
and this was 1998.  The group had to look at location, building a <br/>
structure or finding an appropriate existing one. Salaries for the <br/>

field trips, equipment, supplies, books, pcs etc....) Good luck, but <br/>
2 grand for a boarding school where you are going to throw meals into <br/>
the mix?  That is why I was shocked by Matt&#39;s post.  I have lived the <br/>

when the group of people I was working with started to see what it <br/>

after. And honestly, they were the only kind of people we found were <br/>
willing to invest in it. Then we would have had to have fundraisers <br/>
for scholarships.<br/>
<br/>
It is not easy putting these things together. So, it may have been <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978103324">Thanks for the reply. 2000 a year IS a possibility because of these reasons. 1.I <br/>
will be buying a large chunck of land here in Maine and donating a piece of it <br/>
for the school, there fore no rent. 2. The building will be done mainly by us <br/>
from mostly materials on the land therefore GREATLY reducing the cost but <br/>
making the process of opening longer. Therefore no paying for a building. 3. <br/>
The site will use renewable energy sources and there GREATLY reducing <br/>
any bills. The 2000 a year will be for the day students. Boarding will be extra. <br/>
We will also utilize the families participation in order to reduce the need of a <br/>
paid staff. With all these factors in place we can make this work with a <br/>
potential 7-8 first year students.<br/>

Maine is less expensive than a city.  Rents for a home are 900-1200 and <br/>
apartment rentals are 550. to over a 1000 depending on size and location. <br/>
As to the weather our weather is the same as others along the north of the US <br/>
just a couple days later. Snow comes mostly in Feb and March the last few <br/>
years. Some in December but it doesn&#39;t stay.<br/>
 The summers are humid at times but the waters are all around to make it all <br/>
worth while.<br/>
Many commute from Maine to Boston if the pay is worthwhile. We prefer to stay <br/>
away from the city and my husband still makes enough to keep the house going.<br/>
<br/>
Maine is also a very nice place to vacation. <br/>

&lt;&lt;There was no way we could make it work for less than about 5 grand per<br/>
year<br/>
 and this was 1998. &gt;&gt;<br/>

There was a school an aquaintenance of mine put her kids in. It was a<br/>
Sudbury school in the state of WA and it was free. She moved there<br/>
specifically because they wanted to go to such a school and she couldn&#39;t<br/>
afford any other ones around. She moved from FL 3 years ago to WA for that<br/>
reason. Not sure if it&#39;s still in working but it was then.<br/>

I&#39;d like to know more on the one you are talking about here.  There is one in <br/>
Seattle but it is really expensive if you ask me.<br/>

I wish I could offer more info. The lady was a friend only through one of<br/>
the homeschooling groups I belonged to. Her children who were around 11 and<br/>
13 at the time had seen a story about Sudbury schools on 60 minutes. They<br/>
liked the idea so much they wanted to go to one. She started her research<br/>
and located the public free one in Washington. I really can&#39;t remember<br/>
where. Shortly thereafter they moved and enrolled. Never heard how it all<br/>
turned out.<br/>
