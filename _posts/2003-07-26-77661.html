<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741184667"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Thanks for speaking up Kelly!!!! So how are you feeling? Aside from<br/>
&gt;anxious??<br/>
&gt;Mary B<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not so anxious, this is the third time around.  I&#39;m just really hoping that<br/>
this delivery resembles the second (3 fast hours) rather than the first (12<br/>
long, yucky hours.)<br/>
<br/>
I am just really tired of being tired.  Of &quot;feeling pregnant&quot; if that makes<br/>
sense.  It&#39;s just sapping me in ways I forget that it does.  I am VERY glad<br/>
this is the last time we are doing this.<br/>
<br/>
However, I just put down a down payment on a used minivan (a Town &<br/>
Conuntry, very posh) and we&#39;ll pick it up next week.  Having a car (which we<br/>
have only had since May 1 after 4 years with none) is a major change in our<br/>
lives and having one that actually will FIT our family, our whole new<br/>
family, is a thrill.  I&#39;m very excited about that.<br/>
<br/>
NOw if I could just sleep!!!  I&#39;ts 4 AM, if anyone noticed the time<br/>
tamp.  -sigh-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking, Mary.<br/>

That&#39;s great about the van Kelly. I know what&#39;s that like. Good for you.<br/>
Hang in there, like you have a choice! Your new little bundle will be here<br/>
soon. Do you know if it&#39;s a girl or boy? Names picked out? I hope the<br/>
delivery goes just the way you would like it to.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I&#39;m up until 3:00 a.m. almost every night. E mail me and we<br/>
can chat!!!!!<br/>

choice is William Alden.  But if somone came up with something<br/>
better...(yeah, that&#39;ll happen, we took 8 months to get to that!)<br/>

Ooh that name sounds very official doesn&#39;t it? I can see the child all<br/>
dressed up in a suit already!!! Sounds like one of the boxcar children too!!<br/>
