<div id="ygrps-yiv-816078023">Just wanted to mention that if you are not in a financial position to<br/>
get another twin bed, check out your local freecycle board.  Go to:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://freecycle.org">http://freecycle.org</a> &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://freecycle.org/">http://freecycle.org/</a>&gt;  and see if there is a<br/>
local chapter in your area, I believe they are in every state.  People<br/>
post stuff that they want to get rid of (needs to be in decent shape)<br/>
but it has to be free, no trading, bartering or monies exchanged.  You<br/>
can also post if you need something.  It&#39;s a good way to recycle things<br/>
you don&#39;t want and a good way to find things that you need and can&#39;t<br/>
afford.  There&#39;s no guarantee that you will find a bed, but it can&#39;t<br/>
hurt.  Yahoogroups is where you would be sent to join the online email<br/>
posts.  HTH.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624478495">When Sarah was a year old and we moved to FL, we spent<br/>
two months living with my SIL. Since I didn&#39;t have a<br/>
portable playpen or anything, she slept on the bed<br/>
with me. By the time we got our household goods after<br/>
two weeks in Florida, there was no way Sarah was going<br/>
back in a crib. So we just put the air mattress in her<br/>
room since it was all that we had at the time, a queen<br/>
sized one actually, and she loved it! She slept on it<br/>
for about a year and a half before we bought her a<br/>
twin bed...which only lasted about six months because<br/>
she couldn&#39;t sleep on it. We bought her a full sized<br/>
set, and left the box spring and mattress on the floor<br/>
and that&#39;s how she prefers to sleep...low to the<br/>
ground. <br/>
<br/>
I actually think the air mattress we have (a double<br/>
layer Queen) is more comfortable than our regular<br/>
mattress set!<br/>

We slept on our camping air mattress for about a month<br/>
when we first moved into this house.  We just didn&#39;t<br/>
want to move our 30 yo king size, and were going to<br/>
buy a new one anyway. <br/>
<br/>
Only downside was that it was on the floor. <br/>
Otherwise, really comfy. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the suggestions on ways to cheaply obtain twin beds.  I realize I<br/>
should be making that more of a priority and will look at the freecycle<br/>
lists, as well as the Portland Craigslist.<br/>
<br/>
Last night was once again much calmer with each girl sleeping in a seperate<br/>
bed, but Stella, the four year old, said she likes sleeping away from her<br/>
sister who pesters her, but she wishes she was in her own bedroom.  So, I<br/>
need to find some beds!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-749179478">My girls also like books on tape and I remember them listening to those<br/>
often in Portland before we moved into this temporary situation (which is<br/>
looking to be longer term than we thought!)  Their books and tapes are in<br/>
storage in Portland.  I can get some at the library, though.  I will give<br/>
that a try.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of putting the mattresses on the floor, instead of on a<br/>
frame, not necessarily as a fix for bedtime, but because they love to jump<br/>
on the bed and everyday someone gets hurt and I&#39;m always worrying about the<br/>
baby (who&#39;s 1 and loves to climb up there too, but gets bounced off--ouch!)<br/>
Don&#39;t know why I haven&#39;t already done this.  Duh.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

We already have a pump, I think (though it&#39;s probably BURIED in storage).  I<br/>
might try this.  I do worry about them breaking it.  Real mattresses might<br/>
be able to take their abuse more...especially if I just put them on the<br/>
floor!<br/>
