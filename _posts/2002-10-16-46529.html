<div id="ygrps-yiv-412012044">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re having a mighty rainy day here in NY state.  So, I was looking for <br/>
something fun for us to do today without getting too wet, and I was going <br/>
through my bookmarks to see if I could scare up something interesting.  I <br/>
was looking in a group I entitled &quot;Things We Can Build&quot; and I rediscovered <br/>
this website.  With all the recent talk about geodesic domes, and after the <br/>
fun time we had building a newspaper dome at the conference last weekend, I <br/>
thought I&#39;d pass this along for anyone who would like to build  a more <br/>
permanent geodesic dome playhouse.  Consider this:  you could also make the <br/>
upper sheathing out of  plexiglas or lexan (sp?) and build an 8-foot <br/>
greenhouse (oh boy!!).  Here&#39;s the link for the plans, which cost $29.95:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660356733">Thanks, Marji!!! The boys really want to do one of these, but we don&#39;t have room in the house. I&#39;d love one outside that we could use for a greenhouse in the springtime! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31634331">We do have a rather large group here called the Rochester Area Homeschoolers <br/>
Association.  Most of the folks in it are unschoolers.  We are lucky enough <br/>
to have another unschooling family on the street behind ours (a less than 5 <br/>
minute walk!).  We often get together to do things and their 9yod plays over <br/>
here alot.<br/>
I remember seeing the name Florida, NY one time.  Sounds tempting in the <br/>
winter (lol).<br/>
We&#39;re having more rainy, cold weather for the next 10 days!!  I have to go <br/>
buy my 2yods a winter coat, celebrate my nearly  10yodd (10/18) birhday and <br/>
find stuff to do to keep us from going crazy.<br/>
