<div id="ygrps-yiv-471369470">I know its possible to unschool and work part time - I am doing it! - but I am looking for practical ideas. Just needing help with facilitating my children&#39;s needs and my time away - and child care. <br/>
<br/>
My kids are happy but I do notice on my work days that they spend a lot of time on the game cube,with videos, etc. I know there is a lot of fun and learning involved but I am also aware that I  not physically there to talk about what may come up. I wonder if they ( and I ) choose those things because of their ease - they are easy to do when mum is not there. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I also want to hear that others work and unschool, too,  - a reassurance thing? lol! Thanks for any replies...Leonie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055029327">I work full-time (single mom... kind of have to) and unschool.  I am lucky that my mother has been able to care for my daughter during the day when I am working.  This will change this coming year, though.  I am beginning to look for a homeschool/unschool friendly home provider since I am unaware of any daycare facility that will cater to a school-age child all day.  My DD is 7 (and a half if you ask her... lol).  She just had her assessment a week ago, and did way better than I had thought she ever would...  So that reassured me that I am doing the right thing via unschooling.  Scary still... but I&#39;m not sure parents ever get over the worry/guilt thing with regards to doing the &quot;right&quot; thing for their child(ren).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105716991">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Well I am still getting used to identifying as an unschooler per se. <br/>
I am just used to feeling like &quot;this is my life&quot; and since I am a <br/>
single mother with no &#39;trust fund&#39; etc this means I also have to work.<br/>
<br/>
That being said the usual issues of have come up;<br/>
<br/>
...feeling guilty or just sad to miss the time when away <br/>
<br/>
...stress from daily interaction with the outside world in order to <br/>
make a living, daughter by my side exposed to real world issues or <br/>
simply not my sole priority/focus like she is when it&#39;s just her and <br/>
I...<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I don&#39;t feel guilty since it&#39;s not like I can cut back in <br/>
order to not have to work (and I have never worked full time outside <br/>
the home without her). Actually when I have a job away from home <br/>
alone I enjoy the freedom of being just an adult and not a mom <br/>
heheheh <br/>
<br/>
Not knowing your kids of course I can&#39;t speak definately on why they <br/>
seem to choose videos etc more when you are working but I would think <br/>
proceed as if both reasons you sighted are true in order to give them <br/>
a balanced life. You are not physically available and it&#39;s just <br/>
easier when you aren&#39;t around/than doing something that might have a <br/>
complication.<br/>
<br/>
How old are your kids and have you talked to them about this directly <br/>
or simply started a conversation with them about the interests and <br/>
hobbies they have, what they want to be involved with, why they are <br/>
fascinated with whatever is on their A list these days?<br/>
<br/>
I am raising a girl who is almost 8 we don&#39;t have any video games and <br/>
a very limited supply of videos, no cable tv. She has her own <br/>
computer w/o internet access nothing fancy.<br/>
<br/>
I do mostly nix any movie marathon watching unless we are watching <br/>
things together but actually it would be a total switch for me if she <br/>
picked easy filler stuff to do more often she is either crafting, <br/>
pretending, talking on the phone, or demanding that &#39;I&#39; be and do for <br/>
her lol sigh.<br/>
<br/>
Chin up if you know working is the right thing and good for you to be <br/>
doing I am sure there is a way to find peace with what your kids are <br/>
occupied with during that time and looks like you are on your way to <br/>
finding it.<br/>
<br/>
Take care<br/>
<br/>
Tosca<br/>

I think I was searching for others who work and unschool as I seem to be in a small minority, sometimes, :-) Thanks again...Leonie<br/>

Start a yahoogroup for working moms who unschool. Post it at every  <br/>
unschooling list. I bet they&#39;ll come out of the woodwork! You&#39;re not the only  one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31812204">One of the best things is simply making sure there is &quot;stuff&quot; available.  Playing games, etc... can be excellent for learning and adapting.  If you are concerned with what they are seeing/doing, talk to them.  Also, have them pick games, books, activities, etc... that can be accessible while you are gone.  Is there a hobby they are interested in?  Give them plenty of opportunity to explore those things...  You&#39;ll find things aren&#39;t as bad as they seem, and that your children are learning more than you think.<br/>
