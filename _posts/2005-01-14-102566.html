<div id="ygrps-yiv-745290377">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m Karri married to Jim and mom to spirited Lindsay (2 1/2) and Camden (7 months).  We are in Lakewood, Ca. (a little north of Long Beach, Ca).  I know some of you on the board from an unschooling park day that we attend in Long Beach (Pam, Joylyn, and others).  It is so nice to read all of the topics as of late.  I&#39;m really enjoying and learning a lot too.  We have always been an AP (child-led, breast fed, natural weaning, family bed, natural living, etc.) family so an unschooling lifestyle just seems really natural for us.  We&#39;ve never had bedtimes (and never will).  I think where I need work is the food control area.  I don&#39;t ever make Lindsay finish her plate or anything, when she is full that is fine and when she is hungry she is fed.  My problem is the darn candy.  I try not to keep so much in the house, but lately there has been and she eats it a lot on some days.  I kind of cringe when she does that because I buy a lot of organic/healthy foods (which she does eat), but I<br/>
 worry about all of the dyes and crap in the candy.  So I have a tendency to say &quot;that is enough.&quot;  I still give it to her.  I just tell her to stop when she has had huge amounts.  I know, I know who determines what a huge amount is and how will she learn self-control if she can&#39;t say when to stop.  I&#39;m honestly working on this one.  It&#39;s definitely my issue.  I really just don&#39;t like her to eat all of that junk that has all of these unnatural things in them.  She still eats out and lots of food at other people&#39;s house.  I haven&#39;t limited any of it, even though I want to.  How do I get over this?  Help!<br/>
-Karri<br/>
P.S.  Sandra-I hope you don&#39;t mind me quoting you in my tagline.  I just found that what you said was so profound;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Karri,<br/>
This has been a hard one for me also.  Not just candy but processed <br/>
foods of all kinds.  I very strongly believe that pesticide-laden, <br/>
additive-filled foods are not good for our bodies.  The way we deal with <br/>
it is twofold:  First, we rarely go into stores that have &quot;mainstream&quot; <br/>
candy in them--drug stores, regular supermarkets, etc.  This is not to <br/>
avoid candy, it&#39;s just that we rarely go there!  The only things I need <br/>
to buy at Target or Walgreen&#39;s are toilet paper and socks or underwear.  <br/>
I get almost all our clothes at thrift stores.  I get our household <br/>
cleaners at our local co-op or natural foods store.  I buy the kids <br/>
whatever candy they want from the co-op, which is all natural without <br/>
dyes, hydrogenated oils, etc.  At the whole foods place (which we go to <br/>
less often because I try to support the co-op) I buy all natural <br/>
chocolates, jelly beans, gummi bears, etc.  Also, there are some great <br/>
echinacea and vitamin C lollipops there which I give them freely. So, on <br/>
the rare occasion when we are in a Walgreen&#39;s I am more comfortable with <br/>
them getting candy there because they don&#39;t get the kind with dye and <br/>
corn syrup in it that often.  But I don&#39;t buy the giant bags of candy to <br/>
take home.  I WILL offer to stop at the co-op for candy to take home if <br/>
they really want it.  If we are at a party or at someone else&#39;s home who <br/>
has candy or processed foods I don&#39;t restrict them from eating it. <br/>
<br/>
The second thing we have just started doing is giving my older child an <br/>
allowance (he&#39;s 4.5).  He is free to spend it on anything he wishes.  <br/>
So, when I am shopping for the family, I buy things according to my <br/>
values and explain that I am happy to buy him all the Sun Drops (all <br/>
natural version of M&M&#39;s) he wants but if he wants a giant bag of M&M&#39;s <br/>
(which I don&#39;t buy for many reasons, not just the dye and additives one) <br/>
he can use his allowance.  I try to explain to him why I object to <br/>
spending my money on certain things, but he is free to make his own <br/>
decisions about his money.   I also never judge his decisions and try <br/>
not to appear that I am disappointed in them (I&#39;m usually not--after <br/>
all, what does he know about sweatshops or child slavery?)  Anyway, so <br/>
far he&#39;s been fine with the Sun Drops.<br/>
<br/>
So now I don&#39;t worry about it when they eat the junky stuff <br/>
occasionally.  Honestly, what has worried me lately is blueberries!  My <br/>
kids will eat a 3 pound bag of frozen organic blueberries between the <br/>
two of them (4.5 and 18 mo) in 2 days!  Blue poop and everything--now <br/>
that kind of freaks me out.<br/>

<br/>

much candy for christmas and then I bought more for a girl scout party <br/>
that wasn&#39;t eaten. I mean, literally, a grocery bag full of bags of <br/>
candy, m&ms, kisses, marshmellow christmas trees, etc. etc.  it&#39;s not <br/>

Janene wanted a snack, so I prepared a cup of gold fish crackers and <br/>
chocolate kisses, and she ate all the goldfish, as did I and ate no <br/>
kisses... well, I ate both, love that chocolate. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny but now that Lexie is in bed, we can&#39;t unfood her anymore.  <br/>
She has to eat a certain way, being bedbound, to avoid other <br/>
complications.  Lots of fiber, prunes, loads of liquids, etc.  Her <br/>
appetite is off, so we are tempting her with all sorts of things but <br/>
fatty foods would be not so good right now.  Also, her hydration is very <br/>
important.  And she&#39;s getting vitimins, not just a multi but other stuff <br/>
for healing.  It&#39;s interesting to hear me say things I haven&#39;t ever <br/>
said... like &#39;eat just three bites, ok, three bites...&quot;  It&#39;s important <br/>
that we do this, for now... being constipated and dehydrated could cause <br/>
a huge problem, possibly a return to the hospital.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait until she is totally well again so I can go back to letting <br/>
her control her own food...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264820760">Yeah, I don&#39;t really like processed foods either.  The organic candies are probably my best option for at home.  At least that will minimize all the junk (preservatives and dyes) she gets when we&#39;re elsewhere.  I need to get DH to eat more at home too.  He likes junk food (processed and pesticide-laden) and eats it a lot.  Though it obviously is his choice to eat that way, he is aware of the yuckiness of his choices.  Dd on the other hand is not quite old enough to understand nutrition and pesticides/preservatives.  I will start meal planning again at night that way dh is less inclined to want to eat out.  This way dh is not so enticed by fast food and a &#39;quick&#39; meal.  It&#39;s hard because I&#39;m vegetarian and DD and Dh are meat eaters, though at home I feed them free-range/organic meats.  I just want to show dd that there are options with healthier foods than the over-processed yucky foods that are so abundant in our society.  I think that the best course of action is to make the organic<br/>
 candy and other foods very available in our home.  Thanks, Jenny for reminding me about the organic candy.  It&#39;s just too bad that it is so expensive;-(  Oh well, in this case I get what I pay for.<br/>

&gt; We have a HUGE amount of candy in my house right now.  I bought way too<br/>

&gt; candy, m&ms, kisses, marshmellow christmas trees, etc. etc.  it&#39;s not<br/>

&gt; Janene wanted a snack, so I prepared a cup of gold fish crackers and<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s funny but now that Lexie is in bed, we can&#39;t unfood her anymore. <br/>
&gt; She has to eat a certain way, being bedbound, to avoid other<br/>
&gt; complications.  Lots of fiber, prunes, loads of liquids, etc.  Her<br/>
&gt; appetite is off, so we are tempting her with all sorts of things but<br/>
&gt; fatty foods would be not so good right now.  Also, her hydration is very<br/>
&gt; important.  And she&#39;s getting vitimins, not just a multi but other stuff<br/>
&gt; for healing.  It&#39;s interesting to hear me say things I haven&#39;t ever<br/>
&gt; said... like &#39;eat just three bites, ok, three bites...&quot;  It&#39;s important<br/>
&gt; that we do this, for now... being constipated and dehydrated could cause<br/>
&gt; a huge problem, possibly a return to the hospital.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I bet that is so hard and feels really odd!  My heart goes out to you <br/>
&gt; &#39;gals.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t wait until she is totally well again so I can go back to letting<br/>
&gt; her control her own food...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I bet!  Here&#39;s to a speedy recovery:-)<br/>

To have something show up as a quote the beginning of each line needs a<br/>
carot.<br/>
<br/>
Most email programs will automatically put the carots in. If you highlight<br/>
the lines you want to quote and click reply, the new email should have the<br/>
lines you highlighted properly quoted.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to quote another bit from an email, copy it, go to the email you<br/>
want to send, and under the Edit menu there should be an option to Paste as<br/>
Quote (or something like that). (There should be a keyboard short cut so you<br/>
can just paste as quote with a couple of keyboard strokes.)<br/>

 <br/>
Or you can do something else. Not all mail programs can do that kind of  <br/>
quoting, and <br/>
<br/>
AOL9.0 (which is on this computer, Kirby&#39;s) has a blue line that looks like  <br/>
it might turn to something useful, but doesn&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
Even just traditional quotation marks &quot;like this&quot; will work.<br/>
Or ***this***<br/>
and I use -=-this because it&#39;s really fast for me-=-<br/>
though I sometimes miss and get =&#92;= or 0-0  but it still works.<br/>
