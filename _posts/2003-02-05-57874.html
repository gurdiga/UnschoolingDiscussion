<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430525528">***&lt;&lt; Avila Beach (one of the best kids<br/>
 beaches ever),  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oooh, ooooh, ooh. I STILL have dreams about moving to Avila beach.<br/>
We positively love that area of Cali and had wanted to move to San Luis<br/>
Obispo. We decided it was WAY too expensive and moved to FL instead.<br/>
Sometimes I wish we&#39;d at least tried Cali first.<br/>
We looked at a house up on the hill in Avila beach that I&#39;ve never<br/>
forgotten.<br/>
It was white and oldish style with a porch that wrapped all around. (a<br/>
mere<br/>
$300,000 ten years ago). I decided I wanted to stay a homeowner and we<br/>
couldn&#39;t have been if we&#39;d moved there.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
$300,000 ten years ago?  It&#39;s got to be worth at least a million now!<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago Unocal was ordered to  clean up huge oil spills in Avila<br/>
Beach.  They had to tear down all the shacks across from the beach (you<br/>
know, mom and pop type stuff - the ones we used to go into barefoot in<br/>
the summer and get snow cones because we were boiling in the sun).  The<br/>
stores across the street have changed, most are gone now.  But the beach<br/>
is nicer, no more tar to clean off when you get home.  And a huge<br/>
playground, and easier parking.<br/>
<br/>
Yes it is expensive - the whole central coast is.  We got lucky, we were<br/>
living in Northern CA and my dad offered us this house - we couldn&#39;t<br/>
afford to stay up in the north bay anymore, so we took him up on it.<br/>
Now my husband is back in his old stomping grounds and surfing again.<br/>
<br/>
I still miss the falling down shacks on the beach, just like I miss<br/>
Aspen soda (which hardly anyone has heard of).  But I&#39;m back home now<br/>
and I love being able to raise my kids in the same area I grew up in,<br/>
just a few miles from their papa (who, although he has at least 18 years<br/>
of schooling - he&#39;s a doc - loves and fully supports our unschooling the<br/>
kids).<br/>
<br/>
Enough rambling for now - funny, I&#39;ve been on this list for over a year,<br/>
off and on, but I&#39;ve never introduced myself.  Well, there&#39;s a bit of it<br/>
anyway.<br/>

who loves this list and feels like she knows everyone and will try to<br/>
post more frequently.</div>
