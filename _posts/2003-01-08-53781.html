 </span></blockquote>I guess it depends on what our childhood was like.  Unless it was winter, we <br/>
were always outside.  Riding bikes, building treehouses, playing army (the <br/>
girls were nurses who were often captured by the enemy), playing Indians, <br/>
pretending we were deer, reading books in the chokecherry tree, being a <br/>
scientist and carrying around my notebook everywhere, playing store, playing <br/>
house, making &quot;piggies&quot; with mud wrapped in maple leaves, games like red <br/>
rover, kickball, football, freeze tag, &quot;pies&quot;, having races.  We asked <br/>
permission to go to the park or for a longish walk, otherwise we were always <br/>
in ear shot.<br/>
Maybe some people romanticize the past.  Maybe others really did have a good <br/>
time.<br/>

Lots of childhoods are great, but how were the parents doing?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about kids who had fun childhoods.  My yard was two acres of <br/>
apple trees!  That was pretty cool, especially on irrigation days in the <br/>
summer.<br/>
<br/>
But groups of people who try to re-create some chosen idealized past decade <br/>
as though that were the height of and the last bastion of civilization <br/>
(people wanting it to be like the 1880&#39;s, like the 1940&#39;s, whatever) are <br/>
rarely looking at the bad realities.<br/>
<br/>
There is a date beyond which some Christian homeschoolers don&#39;t want books.  <br/>
I don&#39;t remember but I&#39;ve seen it a couple of times.  And there was someone <br/>
advocating kids not reading any children&#39;s books written after 1960 or <br/>
something.   Those books were dusty, lame, racist and sexist.  &quot;And?&quot;  That&#39;s <br/>
what they want.  They want girls kept in their places, for one thing.<br/>
