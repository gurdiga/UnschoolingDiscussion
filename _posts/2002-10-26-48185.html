<div id="ygrps-yiv-709852554">We read Ferber too - I thought some of his sleep theories made sense, but I didn&#39;t manage to ferberize my kids. I tried with my eldest - for about 30 seconds and gave up. It was just not something I could do.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up going to his room night after night and when the second one came around, she slept in our bed from day. I regret not taking my eldest into our bed from day too. I feel he has missed out on so much, and that time is now gone. I can never get it back. Too bad we sometimes listen to bad parenting advice.<br/>
