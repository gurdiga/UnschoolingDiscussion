&gt;&gt; Calling All Homeschool Families.  We need your support!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Recently, some very scary case law has been made which will affect all<br/>
&gt;&gt; homeschoolers in Oregon.  A Multnomah County Judge ruled that if you are<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; registered as a homeschooler (or have failed to comply with the other<br/>
&gt;&gt; administrative rules), you are not educating your child in accordance with<br/>
&gt;&gt; state law and your children can be removed from your home by SCF (Services<br/>
&gt;&gt; for Children and Families, formerly CSD)!!!!!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  This ruling means that the state does not have to follow the normal<br/>
&gt;&gt; procedure (and statutory law) where the state would send you a written<br/>
 </span></blockquote>notice<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; that your children are truant before showing up at your door and taking<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; children.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We are challenging this ruling on legal grounds.  The Judge will be<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  ***********We are asking homeschool families to attend this hearing to let<br/>
&gt;&gt; the judge know by sheer numbers that this is not OK !!!!!!!!!!!! Please<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; this message on to all the homeschoolers you know!!! *********************<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The hearing will be December 21, 1999, at 2:00 p.m. at the Multnomah County<br/>
&gt;&gt; Juvenile Hall, 1401 N.E. 68th, off of Halsey.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Note: At this last minute the State is claiming to not be prepared and is<br/>
&gt;&gt; requesting that the hearing be postponed until February. If that is the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>case<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We must also tell you, however, that this ruling has come about due to a<br/>

&gt;&gt; repeatedly says &quot;no&quot;, a jury found that these parents were guilty of<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The boys were removed from their home without any notice last February and<br/>
&gt;&gt; placed in a foster home with a couple who practiced a religion contrary to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513927325">Wow.  I saw that website.  It was a topic of conversation on a list I&#39;m on.<br/>
It was truly creepy, I have to say.  It seriously looked like a front for<br/>
child pornography or child snatching.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll say again, even to this unschooling cheerleader, it looked WEIRD.<br/>
<br/>
We were afraid that it would be interpreted as a sample of what all<br/>
homeschoolers were up to.<br/>
<br/>
May I forward this post to that list?  People would be very interested to<br/>
hear this strange turn of events.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725512031">O.K., someone out there has to have an answer to my question.  I am really<br/>
serious about this, not being ornery:<br/>
<br/>
How and when did this become a homeschooling issue?  This case has been all<br/>
over the news and on half a dozen talk shows and not one of them mentioned<br/>
homeschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I saw the web page and some of the<br/>
questions were absolutely NOT acceptable.  At the least, the father should<br/>
be prosecuted for gross stupidity.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the FBI did NOT &quot;find&quot; the page, they received multiple complaints<br/>
about it and requests that it be investigated.<br/>
