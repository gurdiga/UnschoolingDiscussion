do stand up for/voice what I am passionate about. Its just the everyday <br/>

roll this semester :) I said they always do :) well I am in a VERY small <br/>

they were not mentioned ;) Just little things like that I guess that have a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411847085">I definately  have a hard time putting what I read into words that sound<br/>
intelligent.  I always grasp the meaning of something, but my short term<br/>
memory for names and places is pretty well shot.  I can read something that<br/>
sounds great and make it sound not so great before I am done trying to<br/>
explain it.  I do much better on paper most of the time.  It has gotten<br/>
easier in the sense of not caring what other people think as I have gotten<br/>
older. But as far as my friends go, I still do not want to hurt their<br/>
feelings even if they don&#39;t agree with me.  It isn&#39;t a matter of me being<br/>
different, just a matter of their own security with their choices.  The less<br/>
sure people are of their own path, the more they take your strong opinions<br/>
as a criticism of their way.<br/>

worry way too much (anxiety disorder), it is true that<br/>
as you get older you don&#39;t worry as much about what<br/>
people think... especially that type of worry where<br/>
you are embarassed about what people you don&#39;t know<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088925976">I was sitting with Laurie at a basketball game that her dad and his <br/>
coworkers were playing. One of the other wives was asking me about <br/>
the unschooling. I gave a few details and she said, &quot;There is NO way <br/>
I could stand being with my kid all day.&quot; I smiled and said, &quot;Then <br/>
please don&#39;t unschool her.&quot; I just shook my head (to myself) and knew <br/>
she was a lost cause. Two years later she phoned me and asked me to <br/>
tell her how to unschool or at least homeschool. Seems seeing her <br/>
daughter in tears every day after school changed her mind about <br/>
wanting to be with her. That incident taught me to never give up on <br/>
anyone too quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a good one on me... I was talking to Laurie on the phone the <br/>
other night and I was trying to remember the word &quot;articulate.&quot; I <br/>
said, &quot;What&#39;s that word that means you are good with words and it <br/>
begins with an A?&quot; We laughed so hard at the irony. <br/>
<br/>
I LOVE what you said: The less sure people are of their own path, the <br/>
more they take your strong opinions as a criticism of their way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853493748">This is sooooooooooooooo sad!   I ran into a neighbor who has children the<br/>
same ages of mine the other day.  I said to her littlest boy (4) &quot;no school<br/>
today?&quot;  He said &quot;No, but Wyatt (his first grade brother) has school every<br/>
day.&quot;  I said to his mom  &quot;That makes for a long week doesn&#39;t it?&quot;  She said<br/>
&quot;That makes for a good week!&quot;  I just shake my head.  I can&#39;t understand why<br/>
people bother to have children if they have NO desire to be with them.  But<br/>
this is the same mother who whines &quot;My children just don&#39;t listen to me,<br/>
they listen to their father but not me.&quot;  So I would think in my own head.<br/>

This is sooooooooooooooo sad!   I ran into a neighbor who has children<br/>
the<br/>
same ages of mine the other day.  I said to her littlest boy (4) &quot;no<br/>
school<br/>
today?&quot;  He said &quot;No, but Wyatt (his first grade brother) has school<br/>
every<br/>
day.&quot;  I said to his mom  &quot;That makes for a long week doesn&#39;t it?&quot;  She<br/>
said<br/>
&quot;That makes for a good week!&quot;  I just shake my head.  I can&#39;t understand<br/>
why<br/>
people bother to have children if they have NO desire to be with them.<br/>
But<br/>
this is the same mother who whines &quot;My children just don&#39;t listen to me,<br/>
they listen to their father but not me.&quot;  So I would think in my own<br/>
head.<br/>
&quot;Then the problem must be with you and not the kids, since they are able<br/>
to<br/>
listen to one adult!&quot;<br/>

  Practically every Mother I tell that our children do not attend ps<br/>
asks<br/>
how<br/>
  do I stand being with 3 children all day. I feel sad for those<br/>
children<br/>
and<br/>
  parents in the sense that I cannot imagine myself ever wanting to be<br/>
away<br/>
  from mine. We dont use babysitters either, they go to work with us and<br/>
  everything I/We do. I will miss them when they are grown and away.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Not me!!  I am probable the oldest mother here.  I am also a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; grandmother!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No I am not giving away my age.  We will just say I&#39;m 21x2 and a<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am 43 and may still possibly have more children.<br/>

&gt;and I&#39;m 45 and have decided to be a bit childish! ;-)<br/>
