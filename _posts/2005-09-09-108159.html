<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517824009">My son will turn 14 in December and while he has always had a temper, it <br/>
seems that the last few months it is just getting worse.  We&#39;ve been <br/>
unschooling a few months and slowly let it become of way of life as well-as in <br/>
no chores, bedtime, game restrictions etc.    I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s hormones or if <br/>
it&#39;s because he is free to do what he wants now, but he is becoming <br/>
unbearable to live with.  For example, we only have one TV that has internet  <br/>
connection for him to play his Xbox live, which he is usually playing from the <br/>
time he wakes up until the time he goes to bed.  He has taken to yelling at the <br/>
tv or other players when things aren&#39;t going right A LOT  and I will ask him <br/>
nicely to please quiet down and he will usually yell back at me &quot;Mom, just <br/>
stop!&quot; (as in stop talking).   If we go in there and try to ask him a question or <br/>
talk to him, he gets mad and yells at us.  We do try not to interrupt his game, <br/>
but it isn&#39;t always possible.  We can&#39;t even go into the room to get something <br/>
off the shelf without him getting mad, and we aren&#39;t even walking in front of <br/>
him.  There have been a few times that I&#39;ve asked him to get off the game <br/>
because I can&#39;t stand listening to him yell any longer.  Plus, I don&#39;t want his <br/>
little brothers and sister to hear or see him act that way either. He&#39;s been <br/>
hitting his little brothers too.   I can&#39;t seem to get through to him that he isn&#39;t <br/>
being respectful to the rest of the family.  I&#39;m trying to be very patient with him, <br/>
but I don&#39;t think my patience is going to hold out long.  He just has an &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
care attitude&quot;.  Obviously I can&#39;t make him be nice or not do things, but I also <br/>
don&#39;t think the rest of the family has to put up with this behavior.  Has anyone <br/>
else had this problem and have any success with dealing with this?  I need all <br/>
the help I can get.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Can you take the younger kids out to do things elsewhere and let him have an <br/>

do something--shop for t-shirts or go to a movie or take him to lunch, without <br/>
the younger kids?<br/>

<br/>
Right, but I would add the adviso to have this discussion sometime when <br/>
he is not playing.<br/>
<br/>
Would a cheap used TV in a different room work for gaming?  (Really old <br/>
TVs don&#39;t have the right connectors, so I&#39;m not sure how cheaply this <br/>
could be done.)<br/>
<br/>
But yeah, my son (only 11) isn&#39;t bad tempered during or after <br/>
videogaming, and he spends three or more hours playing most days.  If he <br/>
becomes cranky when he&#39;s a teen, we&#39;ll discuss his behavior.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
just let it go.<br/>

(because he wasn&#39;t being nice), he has snuck his game system up to his <br/>
room after we have gone to bed.  He doesn&#39;t care if he gets in trouble.  <br/>

really just loves playing his XBOX, Halo 2.  He has a couple homeschool <br/>
buddies that he gets together with once in a while and they play <br/>
together on Xbox live everyday.  He just likes to stay home.<br/>

to keep them out of his hair.  He sleeps until  2 pm and then he is on <br/>
his Xbox, so he doesn&#39;t really have to deal with them too much.  Plus, <br/>
he usually does stay home when I have errands to do, so he gets a break <br/>
then too.  I don&#39;t know what to do.  It&#39;s very frustrating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371788320">Some questions to ask him (one, for your own education into his world, two, to give him alternatives to playing the game - ie research, and three, to lead him to the big question at the end):<br/>
 <br/>
1. What causes lag? How could it be diminished or prevented?<br/>
2. What rules exist in a particular game? Are they hard-coded rules that are being bypaseed (cheating) or rules set and agreed upon by the players?<br/>
3. Did the programmers purposely leave these rules open-ended to give different people freedom to play different ways?<br/>
4. If you could change the rules in the program to reflect the rules he wished the others would follow,  how would they be implemented (penalties for harming a teammate, more dangerous levels that require attention if the others are to survive long enough to play at all...)<br/>
 <br/>
Which all lead to a question:<br/>
5. Have you ever thought about programming your own game?<br/>
 <br/>
Granted, he may still come back with &quot;no&quot;, but may get him thinking in one direction or another (such as &quot;did the developers know that my friends would be goofing around, and how did THEY plan for it?&quot;)<br/>
 <br/>
Can&#39;t hurt. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402211966">***He has taken to yelling at the tv or other players when things aren&#39;t<br/>
going right A LOT *** <br/>
<br/>
Do other family members yell when they are frustrated?   If you&#39;re<br/>
working on your car and things aren&#39;t going right do you bang stuff and<br/>
yell?   If so it may be a learned behavior and some calm, respectful<br/>
reminders and modeling, over time, will help.<br/>
<br/>
Was his game playing restricted before so that now he&#39;s really getting to<br/>
play as long as it takes to successfully complete a level?   These games<br/>
are so challenging it&#39;s natural for players to get very frustrated.   I<br/>
don&#39;t think this a trait particular to your son, but to lots of humans<br/>
who try to accomplish a difficult task. <br/>
<br/>
Talk to him about the aspects of the game that are so frustrating.  Ask<br/>
him how he&#39;s doing in the game, ask him about the difficult parts,<br/>
sympathize with him.  Tell him about a frustrating thing you had to work<br/>
at a long time.  Remind him that it&#39;s not impossible that he can do it<br/>
and be excited for him when he finally does.   Don&#39;t fight with him, if<br/>
you are demonstrating your disapproval of his yelling and bad temper by<br/>
loosing your temper you&#39;re not being a good example.  Sympathize.  When<br/>
you hear him yelling go in and ask what&#39;s wrong.  Maybe he won&#39;t want to<br/>
talk about it but if you go back a few minutes later with a snack it<br/>
might encourage him to calm down.  <br/>
<br/>
Is he playing a long time and running out of fuel?  Feed him often, take<br/>
food to him while he plays. <br/>
<br/>
Can you put the gaming TV in his room and get another TV for the family? <br/>
Then if the reminders, sympathy and food take a few weeks to soothe him<br/>
he&#39;ll be in a place where the rest of the family doesn&#39;t have to hear the<br/>
yelling. <br/>
<br/>
***If we go in there and try to ask him a question or <br/>
talk to him, he gets mad and yells at us.***<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going in there to yell at him for yelling I&#39;m not surprised he<br/>
yells. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
But seriously, he&#39;s not yelling at you because he&#39;s angry at *you* he&#39;s<br/>
yelling because he&#39;s frustrated at the game and if you sympathize and try<br/>
to understand you&#39;ll both feel better.  <br/>
<br/>
***There have been a few times that I&#39;ve asked him to get off the game <br/>
because I can&#39;t stand listening to him yell any longer. ***<br/>
<br/>
If you were working on something that was important to you and you were<br/>
becoming frustrated it might help you to take a break, but I don&#39;t think<br/>
it would help you to be forced by someone else to take a break.  I think<br/>
you&#39;d feel resentful of that person.   He won&#39;t learn his own body<br/>
signals and healthy responses to stress if you decide when he&#39;s had<br/>
enough.  You could, in a quiet time, remind him that taking a break from<br/>
a really stressful situation can help a person think better and be calmer<br/>
but you can&#39;t force him to be calm.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of people who simply give up when they come upon a<br/>
challenge.  You&#39;re son is not one of those people.  He has something<br/>
inside of him inspiring him to go on no matter how hard it gets and if he<br/>
was with FEMA right now in New Orleans rescuing people you&#39;d think that<br/>
was an amazing and impressive quality.  It is impressive.  He just needs<br/>
time to learn to cope with the stress that comes from the challenge and<br/>
if you set a calm, patient example he will learn that.   It&#39;s wonderful<br/>
that he&#39;s fourteen and has a lot of time to learn to cope in the safety<br/>
of a loving home.   <br/>

3) we visited his grandparents (dh&#39;s parents).  Simon watched a lot of<br/>
television.  They had Tom and Jerry videos and Magic Roundabout and<br/>
the Flintstones, and he just kept watching television. His grandfather<br/>
said &quot;Simon has such an amazing attention span&quot; and I&#39;d been worried<br/>
about how they were going to look at his television watching.  It<br/>
changed the whole way I experienced Simon and television.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Oh, it was definitely learned and we are all working very hard on <br/>
this, with gentle reminders and apologies if needed. Yelling at the game <br/>
is understandable- It&#39;s the yelling at the rest of the family that is <br/>
the major issue.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Was his game playing restricted before so that now he&#39;s really getting to<br/>
&gt;play as long as it takes to successfully complete a level?   These games<br/>
&gt;are so challenging it&#39;s natural for players to get very frustrated.   I<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t think this a trait particular to your son, but to lots of humans<br/>
&gt;who try to accomplish a difficult task. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>     Talk to him about the aspects of the game that are so frustrating. <br/>
Ask him how he&#39;s doing in the game, ask him about the difficult parts,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;sympathize with him.  Tell him about a frustrating thing you had to work<br/>
&gt;at a long time.  Remind him that it&#39;s not impossible that he can do it<br/>
&gt;and be excited for him when he finally does.   Don&#39;t fight with him, if<br/>
&gt;you are demonstrating your disapproval of his yelling and bad temper by<br/>
&gt;loosing your temper you&#39;re not being a good example.  Sympathize.  When<br/>
&gt;you hear him yelling go in and ask what&#39;s wrong.  Maybe he won&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt;talk about it but if you go back a few minutes later with a snack it<br/>
&gt;might encourage him to calm down.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****We don&#39;t fight with him.  We ask him nicely to quiet down and if it <br/>
keeps going on (especially if he yells at us for asking him to quiet <br/>
down), then we ask him to take a break.   We do talk about his game and <br/>
rejoice with him when he gets to a higher level.   He is a really good <br/>
player and we do  give him encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is he playing a long time and running out of fuel?  Feed him often, take<br/>
&gt;food to him while he plays. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****I think food is a big issue.  Most days he gets up and immediately <br/>
starts playing without eating.  Sometimes he only eats dinner and maybe <br/>
a snack at night.  I  usually don&#39;t bother to ask him if he wants food, <br/>
because I  figure he is old enough to make his own meals and he knows <br/>
when he is hungry.  Plus, I don&#39;t want to take a chance of getting <br/>
yelled at and then being upset because he is treating me that way.  I&#39;ve <br/>
found it&#39;s better to just leave him be.  It&#39;s sad for me, but that is <br/>
what works with our particular relationship.  I&#39;ve just learned to let <br/>
him come to me if he needs me. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can you put the gaming TV in his room and get another TV for the family? <br/>
&gt;Then if the reminders, sympathy and food take a few weeks to soothe him<br/>
&gt;he&#39;ll be in a place where the rest of the family doesn&#39;t have to hear the<br/>
&gt;yelling. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***He can take the small tv to his room and play, but he doesn&#39;t have an <br/>
internet connection to play Xbox live which is what he prefers to play.  <br/>
So he has to play on the tv in the main family room where the rest of us <br/>
are in earshot to hear everything. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you&#39;re going in there to yell at him for yelling I&#39;m not surprised he<br/>
&gt;yells. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;But seriously, he&#39;s not yelling at you because he&#39;s angry at *you* he&#39;s<br/>
&gt;yelling because he&#39;s frustrated at the game and if you sympathize and try<br/>
&gt;to understand you&#39;ll both feel better.  <br/>

&gt;it would help you to be forced by someone else to take a break.  I think<br/>
&gt;you&#39;d feel resentful of that person. He won&#39;t learn his own body<br/>
&gt;signals and healthy responses to stress if you decide when he&#39;s had<br/>
&gt;enough.  You could, in a quiet time, remind him that taking a break from<br/>
&gt;a really stressful situation can help a person think better and be calmer<br/>
&gt;but you can&#39;t force him to be calm.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>***Oh, I know I can&#39;t make him be calm and we don&#39;t try to. But when his <br/>
actions are causing stress to the rest of the family because we are <br/>
having to listen to his yelling over and over then we do ask him to take <br/>
a break.  There isn&#39;t much I can do if he gets resentful.  I&#39;m not going <br/>
to make the rest of us suffer.  After a few hours of hearing it, it gets <br/>
old.<br/>

quality in that he stands up for himself.  I didn&#39;t like it when he was <br/>
younger and I would try to discipline him or make him do schoolwork and <br/>
he would look at me and say &quot;NO!&quot;.  Glad those days are gone.  : )<br/>

them if the parents want to have a really good relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I bet you&#39;re old enough to do some of the things your husband does for you.   <br/>
I don&#39;t know what.    Mow the lawn or change the oil.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m old enough to get a chair and climb up and get things off top shelves, <br/>
but I still ask my husband or my sons (now that they&#39;re taller than I am) to do <br/>
it for me.   It&#39;s safer, and it&#39;s easier for them than for me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I  usually don&#39;t bother to ask him if he wants food,-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t ask him.<br/>
(And it shouldn&#39;t be a bother.)<br/>
<br/>
Just make food and take it to him, and food he can eat while he&#39;s playing.   <br/>
Not fried eggs; a scrambled egg sandwich maybe.   Not spaghetti; maybe pizza <br/>
in small slices.   Sandwiches cut in quarters.   <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t HAVE to do that.   <br/>
I bet life would be better at your house if you did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Plus, I don&#39;t want to take a chance of getting<br/>
yelled at and then being upset because he is treating me that way.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re old enough to understand why he&#39;s upset.   <br/>
If for many years you had restrictions on him, and now you&#39;ve admitted you <br/>
wish you hadn&#39;t. you&#39;re old enough to take some frustration as penance.    <br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;ve found it&#39;s better to just leave him be. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Better for you?<br/>
If he&#39;s hungry, sometimes only eating dinner, and being grouchy, he needs <br/>
more food.<br/>
If you KNOW he needs more food and you are withholding that offer of food <br/>
because you&#39;re afraid he MIGHT hurt your feelings, that&#39;s not the best you can <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s sad for me, but that is what works with our particular <br/>
relationship. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If your particuler relationship worked well, you wouldn&#39;t have brought it up <br/>
here, I&#39;m thinking.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;ve just learned to let him come to me if he needs me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
By the time he comes to you you&#39;re both really angry.<br/>
When you&#39;re not angry, take him some good food.   Protein.   Drinks.   Maybe, <br/>
if he likes them, smoothies or milk shakes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He can take the small tv to his room and play, but he doesn&#39;t have an<br/>
internet connection to play Xbox live which is what he prefers to play. <br/>
So he has to play on the tv in the main family room where the rest of us<br/>
are in earshot to hear everything.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve said that.   Is there not a phone line in his room?   Can you run one? <br/>
  Can you get one of the plug-into-the-outlet phone jack adaptors?<br/>
<br/>
-=- There isn&#39;t much I can do if he gets resentful.  I&#39;m not going<br/>
to make the rest of us suffer. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you do&#39;t figure out how to make peace with and around him, you ARE going <br/>
to make the rest of the family suffer.   Things can be made better.   Try not <br/>
to say things like &quot;have to.&quot;   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/haveto">http://sandradodd.com/haveto</a><br/>
<br/>
It might help to read that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t sense from your writing that you feel you&#39;re making choices, but that <br/>
you&#39;re just reacting to the irritating world.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 13, too, I think; not 14.<br/>
He&#39;s barely not 12, then.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t cut him some slack for puberty, don&#39;t expect him to cut you any <br/>
for menopause.   He&#39;s going through the biggest change in his life (barring <br/>
serious injury) and he needs love and patience and space and food.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this is a mistake. My son (will be 9 yo in late Oct)is <br/>
REALLY into online RPGs (City of Heroes and Everquest being his <br/>
current favorites, and something called Second Life)...he almost <br/>
never takes time out to eat on his own, unless he is just really <br/>
bored with the game. I am always bringing him something to eat, i <br/>
dont always ask what he wants. In fact, its the easiest way to get <br/>
things like fruit and cut up veggies into him....some grapes, <br/>
olives, carrots with ranch dressing, and apples with sugar (or <br/>
splenda)and cinnamon, all spread out on a plate to be munched on as <br/>
he wants...it always all disappears eventually. Bottles of water <br/>
too. If i was really busy....lets say, i dunno working on some <br/>
important project, or painting the house, or doing taxes or <br/>
something...i might not want to stop and make a sandwhich, and would <br/>
really appreciate someone making something tasty and easy to eat.<br/>
<br/>
I bet if you start bringing him finger food to eat he will be nicer. <br/>
Hungry people tend to be grumpy, and it will help i bet to keep his <br/>
blood sugar level steady. Roll up cream cheese in turkey lunchmeat, <br/>
or make peanut butter and jelly sandwhich squares and serve with <br/>
milk. Maybe a burrito. Whatever you know he likes, just make it <br/>
something he can pick up easily and put down, and preferably <br/>
something that can be eaten if it gets cold from sitting. <br/>
<br/>

please try it. I am not sure why that hasnt happened, whether its <br/>
money or there not being a hookup ability or whatever. But i really <br/>
really think that if he can make his room his game space, and has a <br/>
loving mom checking in, bringing yummy food, it will help. It might <br/>
not solve all the problems, but its a place to start for sure. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ***We don&#39;t go in and yell at him, we just ask him to quiet down.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want to judge, because i&#39;ve popped in and said &quot;quiet down&quot; <br/>
too...but if you look at it from his perspective it might seem like, <br/>
he is in a really tough part of the game, something dire just <br/>
happened, he is expressing very real frustration, anger, etc, and <br/>
mom (who doesnt come in to bring him refreshments)comes in <br/>
with &quot;quiet down&quot; not &quot;man, what happened? you lost your XYZ <br/>
weapon?! Bummer!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
What happens when you just go watch him play for a few minutes or <br/>
ask him questions about the game (not when he is super busy in the <br/>
game)?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ***Oh, I know I can&#39;t make him be calm and we don&#39;t try to. But <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you might want to look for some creative solutions that will <br/>
meet both his needs and the needs of the family. I take care of my <br/>
mom part of the week at her house (she&#39;s disabled), and my son will <br/>
spend hours in the back bedroom on his computer playing RPGs (online <br/>
role playing games for those that dont know)...he is a pretty <br/>
active/hyper kid, and when he is in the back bedroom we can <br/>
*constantly* hear him kicking his feet, moving the chair, <br/>
bangbangbang...it would drive me crazy. I would constantly yell from <br/>
the other room &quot;stooooooop kicking!!!!&quot; he would say &quot;ok sorry&quot; and <br/>
then start again a minute later (because he can&#39;t help it). I <br/>
finally decided it was stupid to get frustrated over something that <br/>
wasnt going to change. So i got some tennis balls, cut a hole in <br/>
them, and put the chair feet into them (its a wooden dining chair)--<br/>
a trick that i saw when seamus spent 2.5 days in school this year, <br/>
thats how they kept the desks from wobbling)...i didnt have to worry <br/>
about the wood chair hurting the hardwood floor from all his moving <br/>
about, and it REALLY muffled the sound. I also gave him a big pillow <br/>
to put at his feet under the desk, so he could &quot;bounce&quot; but more <br/>
quietly. I&#39;m thinking about getting some walkie talkies so i can <br/>
quietly say &quot;hey can you sing more quietly&quot; or whatever, rather than <br/>
having to yell, or get frustrated from getting up twenty times to <br/>
ask that he be quiet. <br/>

yelling and disrespecting the family and being a tyrant and causing disruption  and <br/>
abusing little brothers.  Making the whole family walk around on  eggshells?  <br/>
Nope, not happening in my house.  <br/>
 <br/>
Fourteen yo boys are often angry for many and no reason.   They&#39;re going <br/>
through a lot of changes.  They can&#39;t articulate how  they feel all the time.  <br/>
Sometimes their expressons are inappropriate.  Even so, I don&#39;t believe I&#39;d let <br/>
that behavior go on, even if it  meant a long break from the xbox.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d look into the food issue, too,  but that would not be the only  thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**** Okay, I&#39;m really trying hard to understand this, but it is getting <br/>
me confused.   Please bear with me.  I thought that unschoolers <br/>
believed  their children can make their own choices when it comes to <br/>
learning, eating, sleeping, playing etc.  so they may listen to what <br/>
their bodies are telling them.  So my thought has been that if he is <br/>
hungry then he would listen to his body and  get some food for himself.  <br/>
My baby comes to me when she wants to nurse, and my little boys go get <br/>
their own snack or ask me to get them some food when they are hungry.  <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if him playing his game (which he obviously is very <br/>
involved in) for long stretches and not eating is keeping him from <br/>
listening to his body.  By me bringing him food, doesn&#39;t that show that <br/>
I don&#39;t trust him to take care of himself?  Hmmm...a little lightbulb <br/>
went off as I wrote that....I think I realized what you are trying to <br/>
say.  That I should &quot;strew&quot; food the same way I &quot;strew&quot; items for <br/>
possible learning.  Is that right?  I don&#39;t normally have a big problem <br/>
with wasting food,  but my DH has been out of work for 5 months and we <br/>
barely scrape by. <br/>

process.  And actually, he can get on the internet whenever he wants <br/>
with the main family computer.  He has his own password to get in and he <br/>
could easily do what he wants especially since he is up most of the <br/>
night by himself.  So, I guess I have let go of it.  My DH is looking <br/>
into putting internet in his room.  Hmmm, then he&#39;ll never have any <br/>
reason to come out of his room, except to get his cat, and take the <br/>
occasional shower, especially if I&#39;m bringing him food.  I guess I&#39;ll <br/>
have to put a shelf in his bathroom so I can &quot;strew&quot; things on it .  <br/>
Time to dig out the Uncle John Bathroom reader.  There is a wealth of <br/>
information in those things!  Thanks for all your help . <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646330611">** I&#39;m wondering if him playing his game (which he obviously is very<br/>

<br/>
I think so.  There can be very intense concentration involved in <br/>
computer gaming or videogaming.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not the kind of person who could ever forget to eat, but (strangely) <br/>
some people are that way.  It&#39;s often been recommended here to bring <br/>
food to kids who are intensely involved in something for so many hours <br/>
that they must be getting hungry.  And some people can get especially <br/>
cranky if they go to long without consuming protein.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to waste food either, so if that really bugs you, you could <br/>
put out the kind of sandwich you might want for lunch, about 20 minutes <br/>
before you would eat.  If he doesn&#39;t eat it, you could.  Or cheese and <br/>
fruit could be recycled out to other family members IF not eaten fairly <br/>
quickly.  A little trial and error won&#39;t cost really big dollars.<br/>
<br/>
Unemployment is really stressful for everyone.  Please take the time to <br/>
do something that makes you feel happy.  (Something cheap, I mean.)<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not all unschoolers believe the same thing.    There is no monolithic belief.<br/>
<br/>
Those who believe listening to their bodies is a good idea are recommending <br/>
against FORCE feeding, against pressing people to &quot;clean their plates&quot; or no <br/>
dessert, against forbidding snacks, against insisting they &quot;take one more bite.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere in that are people saying &quot;Just stop feeding them.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Probably.<br/>
When I&#39;m really involved in something intensely I might not notice that I&#39;m <br/>
hungry, and I&#39;ll get &quot;a second wind&quot; and not be tired if it&#39;s really <br/>
fascinating.   I might all of a sudden notice I need to go to the bathroom RIGHT AWAY, <br/>
whereas if I&#39;d been doing something less interesting I might&#39;ve gone earlier, <br/>
and maybe gone to sleep afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;re not suggesting making his life more boring so that the most <br/>
interesting things would be wondering whether he was hungry or needed to pee.    <br/>
<br/>
That reminds me of teachers painting over or papering windows so that the <br/>
students can&#39;t see outside, lest what&#39;s outside be more interesting than the <br/>
teacher.<br/>
<br/>
-=- By me bringing him food, doesn&#39;t that show that<br/>
I don&#39;t trust him to take care of himself? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it would show that you think about him, that you care about him and <br/>
that   you love him.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I don&#39;t normally have a big problem<br/>
with wasting food,  but my DH has been out of work for 5 months and we<br/>
barely scrape by.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t take him any food he doesn&#39;t like, certainly.<br/>
Don&#39;t take something fragile that will go bad if it sits for half an hour.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I don&#39;t normally have a big problem<br/>

<br/>
This seems overly negative and defeatist.   <br/>
If your attitude at home is as it shows in this exchange, maybe you should <br/>
work on being more positive, optimistic, and joyful.<br/>
<br/>
Strewing should not be one of your main priorities at this point.   You might <br/>
want to work on being a person worth coming out of a room to hang out with, <br/>
visit, talk to, have lunch with.<br/>
<br/>
If you make good meals and invite him out honestly sweetly and nicely without <br/>
judgment and resentment he will probably come out, at least sometimes.   Or <br/>
you could invite him, eat, and if he shows up partway through or later, have <br/>
his portion saved for him.<br/>

From: Faith Pickell <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:panda@...">panda@...</a>]<br/>
 <br/>
**** Okay, I&#39;m really trying hard to understand this, but it is getting <br/>
me confused.   Please bear with me.  I thought that unschoolers <br/>
believed  their children can make their own choices when it comes to <br/>
learning, eating, sleeping, playing etc.  so they may listen to what <br/>
their bodies are telling them.  So my thought has been that if he is <br/>
hungry then he would listen to his body and  get some food for himself.  <br/>
My baby comes to me when she wants to nurse, and my little boys go get <br/>
their own snack or ask me to get them some food when they are hungry.  <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if him playing his game (which he obviously is very <br/>
involved in) for long stretches and not eating is keeping him from <br/>
listening to his body.  By me bringing him food, doesn&#39;t that show that <br/>
I don&#39;t trust him to take care of himself?  Hmmm...a little lightbulb <br/>
went off as I wrote that....I think I realized what you are trying to <br/>
say.  That I should &quot;strew&quot; food the same way I &quot;strew&quot; items for <br/>
possible learning.  Is that right? <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I tend to get easily consumed by things. &lt;g&gt; Pretty much anything I do can easily take over *everything*! <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m 45 years old. I know better---certainly. But while I&#39;m making name badges, I&#39;ll sit at this computer for HOURS typing and correcting and printing and filing. Ben will come home and ask whether I&#39;ve eaten at all today. After getting mad that he even bothers to walk in and ASK.... &lt;G&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
I remodelled and old house. HOURS stripping woodwork. I&#39;d start at 8:00 am and work until late at night. I&#39;d quit long enough to fix supper and clean up, but then be right back to stripping or sanding wood. At midnight, Ben would walk downstairs and remind me what time it was. I&#39;d say that I would just do *this last little bit* until he&#39;d come back down at 2:00 am and remind me that I&#39;d already done *just that little bit* and it was time for bed.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes I schedule several dogs to be groomed one after the other. I may be out in the groom room for *hours*---no food, no rest. I just do it until it&#39;s done---kind of my Modus Operandi! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not uncommon for me to get huge hunger head-aches, get ultra grouchy, and yet get a LOT done.<br/>
 <br/>
So I know EXACTLY where your son&#39;s coming from. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But now *I* know better. (My older son (17) saw me at the computer just now and offered to go get me a burger---&#39;cause he knows how I am!)<br/>
 <br/>
I happily accept food when Ben or one of the boys offers. I will take a break to swim or jump on the trampoline or walk around the block with a dog.<br/>
 <br/>
But I&#39;m *45*!!! ....and I&#39;ve been on these lists for years now! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I take monkey platters to Duncan (9) and his friends all the time. He&#39;s learning to ask for them now---when or *before* he needs them. THAT&#39;s what you&#39;ll see if you take care of him now. He&#39;ll learn that he&#39;ll feel better, think more clearly, and play/work better/harder when he&#39;s fueled. But he can&#39;t do that alone (in *MY* exerience, anyway!). Not all of a sudden. Not when he&#39;s consumed by what he&#39;s doing.<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, we eat when we&#39;re hungry. But we don&#39;t always think that food is necessarily *what* we need when are struggling to get to another level (of whatever). Sometimes we need a reminder---or even better: a GIFT. <br/>
 <br/>
And the more you can give, the more he&#39;ll make the connections.<br/>

<br/>
By &quot;do school&quot; do you mean school at home, or going to school?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;unschooling needed to happen,&quot; I&#39;m afraid you meant just dropping the <br/>
school (or school at   home) and not replacing it with all the attitudes and <br/>
activities and things that unschooling needs to thrive.<br/>
<br/>

Yes, it had strained your relationship.   Something had.<br/>
It seems from what you&#39;ve written that you replaced that with neglect, <br/>
though.<br/>

A hundred smiley faces wouldn&#39;t negate your choice of words or the fact that <br/>

It&#39;s very easy for people to show their emotions without realizing they do so <br/>

<br/>
I do prefer people who move quickly toward getting it, for the sake of their <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
The more you make this about you and the less you make it about your son&#39;s <br/>
feelings and how to make them easier and better,   the harder it will be for <br/>
your family.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Are we there yet?<br/>
<br/>
 Conventional parenting focuses on the destination. Joyful living focuses on <br/>
the journey.<br/>
<br/>
 Good parents have the goal of being better parents. But how do we know if <br/>
what we&#39;re doing will get us where we want to go?<br/>
<br/>
 The problem is that when we focus on the destination, it doesn&#39;t help us <br/>
decide which path to take. Basically it boils down to what sounds sensible and <br/>
whatever works to get us there.<br/>
<br/>
 Conventional parenting, which gets accepted as good parenting, is <br/>
destination oriented. It&#39;s getting kids into college. It&#39;s stopping the tantrums. It&#39;s <br/>
making sure kids stay away from drugs. It&#39;s about getting kids from point A to <br/>
point B. It&#39;s about molding kids into what we think will help them the most.<br/>
<br/>
 If there is one thought that will help you understand unschooling and <br/>
respectful parenting it is this:<br/>
 The primary goal is joyful living.<br/>
<br/>
All other goals are secondary.<br/>
<br/>
 All decent parents, of course, want their children to be happy. But they <br/>
assume that sometimes happiness needs to be sacrificed to get something better.<br/>
<br/>
 But for unschooling, peaceful parents meeting any goal must also meet the <br/>
goal of living life more joyfully.<br/>
<br/>
 If meeting a goal means sacrificing joy, then find a better way to meet the <br/>
goal.<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s simple to write, but not so simple to put it into practice! Our heads <br/>
are full of &quot;have tos.&quot; We&#39;re full of fears of what will happen if we don&#39;t do <br/>
what we &quot;have to.&quot; Getting rid of those &quot;have tos&quot; and fears is hard to do!<br/>
<br/>
     •      The first step is finding something that&#39;s better than what you <br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
     •      The second step is wanting to change.<br/>
<br/>
     •      The third step is figuring out how to change.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 So, as you read along, you may wonder why I suggest that parents basically <br/>
make life more difficult for themselves. The reason is because I believe it <br/>
leads to a much better place. And that better place is a more joyful life for our <br/>
children and our families.<br/>
