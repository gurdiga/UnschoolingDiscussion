<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879004309">Hey, everyone! I&#39;m back! Using a different email address though. <br/>
<br/>
To reintroduce myself, my name is Elizabeth. I&#39;m a 28 y/o SAHM of <br/>
four children. Sarah is 8; Logan is 4; Megan is nearly 3; and Gracie <br/>
is 10 months old. <br/>
<br/>
Things have been absolutely nuts, and I had to take a break from <br/>
things for awhile. Sarah went back to school during that time, and <br/>
finishes up on Monday. <br/>
<br/>
Now that she is home again and we&#39;re moving we&#39;re looking to put <br/>
everything behind us and move on with our lives. Paul is not wild <br/>
about us unschooling, but as it is Sarah has asked to do certain <br/>
things that are more schoolish. I&#39;d love to try to persuade her <br/>
against anything schoolish, but I&#39;m having to remember that it&#39;s HER <br/>
life and if she wants to do some things in &quot;that&quot; way that it&#39;s <br/>
alright as it&#39;s her choice. <br/>
<br/>
So things are settling down again finally, and I thought I&#39;d head <br/>
back this way! I&#39;ve missed the discussions here! <br/>
<br/>
