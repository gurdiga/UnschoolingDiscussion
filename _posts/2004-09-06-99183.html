<div id="ygrps-yiv-458726831">Not that anyone is keeping track, but I&#39;ve used this list as a place to keep track of the <br/>
ongoing unschooling process our family has been in. So for those who are interested, read <br/>
on. Otherwise, I&#39;ll just post, copy and save to my personal folder. :)<br/>
<br/>
I am cleaning out old school-ish stuff this weekend. I&#39;m tossing workbooks, math books, <br/>
handwriting books - you name it. I found an old school schedule book where I have every <br/>
subject planned for a week with little stickers to show the kids had done their work. At the <br/>
end of each week, I wrote a personal note to the child praising his/her success and then <br/>
mentioning what we&#39;d work on the next week (very affirming stuff).<br/>
<br/>
It touched me that I was trying so hard to be positive, upbeat and conscientious.<br/>
<br/>
One of the funny things to notice was that that method only lasted about ten weeks. I lost <br/>
steam :) and I know why. My oldest just didn&#39;t like the whole planned sticker gig. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a sort of epiphany. We often talk about deschooling for our kids taking as many <br/>
years as they were &quot;schooled&quot; (whether at home or in an actual school). But I wonder if <br/>
we&#39;ve ever looked at how long it takes to shed our *own* school experiences - the <br/>
indoctrination of years of people telling us how to learn, that we need to do what we don&#39;t <br/>
like to do to get ahead, that experts know more than we do, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I sat at a table with university professors two weeks ago. (My husband teaches at two <br/>
different universities in town and this was a banquet.)<br/>
<br/>
The table of profs found out that we homeschool and began asking questions. One said, <br/>
&quot;Yes, it all  sounds good. But how do you get them to do what they don&#39;t want to do? After <br/>
all, everyone has to learn subjects they don&#39;t like to get ahead. How do you make them <br/>
learn math, for instance, if they don&#39;t like it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband looked at me sideways and grinned his &quot;How will you get out of this one?&quot; <br/>
smile.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t,&quot; I said.<br/>
<br/>
The table stopped talking.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t believe in making a child learn - because it&#39;s not possible to learn the subject <br/>
under those conditions. Learning itself is contagious and all subjects have intrinsic value <br/>
and intrigue. But if a child hasn&#39;t discovered that about a particular subject, force just <br/>
teaches other lessons that I don&#39;t want them to learn - such as, I can store information in <br/>
my short term memory for a test and then forget it, or math is awful, or important <br/>
subjects are hard and boring, or other people know better than me what is important for <br/>
me to know/learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I shared about a success with my daughter in math, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
By the end of the conversation, they had shifted positions and were discussiing how true it <br/>
is that you can&#39;t make anyone learn or love learning. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so tired of everyone focusing always on &quot;learning to do what we don&#39;t want to do&quot; as <br/>
the highest virtue in life.<br/>
<br/>
Today, my son (17) is so light (after deciding to come home full time again). He suddenly <br/>
is in charge of his life. He said, &quot;I want to watch that one movie list I have in order and <br/>
then read the screenplays. I &#39;ll watch one every day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m smiling.<br/>

I think it&#39;s the same amount of time---it&#39;s just longer because we&#39;ve  spent <br/>
more time IN teh system, with high school and college and grad  school, <br/>
and..... <br/>
 <br/>
Great post, Julie!<br/>

Very cool success story!<br/>
<br/>
I think kids unlearn their school-lessons more quickly and easily than adults <br/>
do.   Adults have to really want to unlearn, it seems, whereas younger kids <br/>
can recover with less analysis and re-programming.<br/>

are sometimes a bit rough on people here. If somebody wants to &quot;get <br/>
unschooling&quot; - it would be nice if they could do it slowly and over a <br/>
long period of time. But time is passing for the kids&#39; too and every <br/>
month and year is just that much more time THEY will have to deschool, <br/>
if they ever even get the chance.<br/>

<br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>
anyway, that&#39;s what it reminded me of -- we are addicted to concepts <br/>
often without realizing it for decades.<br/>
<br/>
I often wondered to myself whether or not relaxed homeschoolers or <br/>
unschoolers were more influenced by their own school years than they <br/>
might be aware of.  We are all products of our environment to one <br/>
degree or another.  The 60s in some of our backgrounds may play into <br/>
how we are raising our kids.  But then again, I don&#39;t know how many <br/>
other 51 year old moms here have 10 year old children, and kids in <br/>
their teens. <br/>
<br/>
I think it is cool that someone else also had the same thought of our <br/>
own schooling playing into how we are approaching our learning <br/>
experiences that we engage in with our kids.  I thought maybe I was <br/>
just weird (which may be another topic altogether)and was the only <br/>
one to wonder about that. It&#39;s good to know that someone else <br/>
considered that possibility also.</div>
