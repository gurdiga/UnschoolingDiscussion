<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890591091">I just want to offer this about your son. Yes, sometimes they do need to cry<br/>
 in your arms. My oldest daughter sometimes needed to cry for over an hour<br/>
at<br/>
 a time when she was 2, for longer when she was an infant. There is a<br/>
 brilliant woman, Aletha Solter, who has written a number of books on the<br/>
 subject of why children (humans!) need to cry, with someone who loves them<br/>
 listening. Her web site is &quot;Aware Parenting&quot;, and there&#39;s also The Parent<br/>
 Leadership Institute, which was founded by Patty Wipfler, another brilliant<br/>
 parent. I have met both of these women, and Aletha&#39;s children, and raised<br/>
 all 3 of my beautiful children using this way of parenting. That&#39;s all...<br/>

Robyn,<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank you for the information about the Aware Parenting website. I<br/>
had to do a search with Google to find it.  From<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.awareparenting.com/">http://www.awareparenting.com/</a> I went to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.atlc.org/">http://www.atlc.org/</a> which is the<br/>
Alliance for Transforming the Lives of Children website. First thing I read<br/>
on this site was...<br/>
&quot;There is no single effort more radical in its potential for changing the<br/>
world than a transformation of the way we raise our children.&quot; - Marianne<br/>
Williamson<br/>
<br/>
I read the Aware Baby book or maybe it was the aware parenting book years<br/>
ago when my ds, Hubbard, was a baby, almost 18 years ago!  I had it on my<br/>
bookshelf and about 8 years ago I lent it to a young woman friend who had<br/>
just had a baby. I never got it back.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did I read the book, but I put it into practice with all my babies.<br/>
Upon birth, we practiced the family bed, nursing, holding and listening. My<br/>
mother would have a &#39;silent&#39; fit, she would stick her head in the room and<br/>
there I was holding my baby and listening to him/her cry after birth. Oh,<br/>
did I mention that I birthed at home too?<br/>
<br/>
How else can babies communicate if not by crying, especially right after<br/>
birth.  I never made my kids be quite when they cried, I just listened.<br/>
<br/>
As for attachment parenting, I will admit that I never understood the term<br/>
till now. I thought it was some strange cult type thing. Low and behold,<br/>
I&#39;ve always done attachment parenting, now I have a name for what I thought<br/>
was just natural. Seems like I had that thought 18 years ago too, in regards<br/>
to La Lache League. I had heard about these strange women that nursed their<br/>
babies till they were kids...My first baby nursed for a year and then came<br/>
Hubbard, Nathaniel, David and BJ.<br/>
<br/>
Hubbard, broke the mold, he nursed for more than a year, he nursed for 2 and<br/>
1/2 years, so did Nathaneil and David. BJ nursed till she was five, but she<br/>
was five for a whole year and when she was six she stopped! :-)<br/>
<br/>
So Robyn, thank you again, that&#39;s all!<br/>

<br/>
Peace and Love from a Spiritual Unschooler...<br/>
