My kids and I teach Toddler (ages 2-early 4) Sunday school at our <br/>
church and parents leave their screaming, obviously-don&#39;t-want-to-be-<br/>
there children with us whom they have never met and know nothing <br/>
about. Within the last month, I had a boy crying so hard he was <br/>
gasping,  tears were rolling down his face, and he was hanging on <br/>
the gate he was desperately trying to crawl over. The mom <br/>
said, &quot;He&#39;ll be fine.&quot; I said, &quot;You can come in and try to get him <br/>
settled.&quot; &quot;Oh no!&quot; said she, &quot;He always does this when I leave him. <br/>
It&#39;ll be fine.&quot; I replied, &quot;Well, I will give him maybe 15 minutes <br/>
to see if he will settle down, but I won&#39;t let him cry for long <br/>
before we call you. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t want him here, but that <br/>
we can&#39;t stand to see him so distressed.&quot; She rolled her eyes at me, <br/>
then and when we called her to come comfort him 15 minutes later. <br/>
There was no consoling him. Poor baby!</div>

day.   At first, yeah, thier caregivers are total strangers.    Not being left <br/>
with strangers is the exception, not the rule, when it comes to child care.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>See, I partly blame this on the church (no offense.)  My husband is <br/>
Protestant and in the past he has gotten the urge to attend again.  So the kids and I <br/>
have gone with him (kids and I are Catholic) and at most, they practically <br/>
block the door not wanting anyone to bring children into the &quot;sanctuary.&quot;  The <br/>
parents feel they need to go to church, it helps them, maybe keeps them going, <br/>
but the powers that be don&#39;t want kids in there disrupting the service.  So the <br/>
parents have to leave their crying children in the nursery.  Guilt about <br/>
leaving the kids, but more guilt if they don&#39;t go to the service.   <br/>
<br/>
We have turned around and left churches in the past because they don&#39;t want <br/>
children in the &#39;adult&#39; service.  <br/>
<br/>
Once, at our (Catholic) parish in CA, the &quot;reformers&quot; tried to do the same <br/>
thing, taking children out of the church for a children&#39;s Mass.  All the <br/>
Hispanic and Filipino familes (and me) refused.  It was a flop.  Our priest later <br/>
told me he&#39;d much rather speak a little louder over a crying infant, or have <br/>
mothers walking their children up and down the aisles than to have families <br/>
separated at Mass.<br/>

<br/>
The most child-friendly service I&#39;ve ever been to was Mormon.  They just <br/>
cranked the sound system up loud enough that people could hear it over kids <br/>
talking (quietly) and shuffling papers and their moms helping them if they needed <br/>
help.  I thought with their emphasis on family, they were walking their talk <br/>
with that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-743224830">Hi, new here and been lurking but I had to comment on this...I always thought church was supposed to be a family thing! We have a great priest at our parish...my son is a very active loud 5 yo who has trouble behaving when he&#39;s bored. Even though we bring things to keep him occupied he nearly always gets to acting up and being loud during Mass. The priest said to me after one particularly exasperating session, &quot;Don&#39;t feel bad, keep bring him, Jesus said to bring the children to him&quot;. When a baby starts crying, he just smiles in the direction of the infant and talks a little louder if he needs to. <br/>
<br/>
Well...now that I&#39;ve popped out, I&#39;ll have to write another email introducing myself...<br/>

church lots of times when my oldest was under 3.  She refused to leave me<br/>
and I refused to leave her, so they just wanted me to be the permanent<br/>
&quot;babysitter&quot; for the whole lot.  I&#39;d rather stay home, since I then got<br/>
nothing out of church.  Not my cup of tea, so I don&#39;t go.  Helped me see<br/>
more hypocrisy, too.  Opened my eyes.<br/>

I remember one church I went to when I was little had a &quot;crying room,&quot; a room <br/>
about ten feet square, all glass windows.  A (relatively) sound-proof booth, <br/>
with a speaker so you could still hear the service.<br/>
<br/>
Some movie theaters used to have those too.<br/>

Back home going to church with my folks, I never heard of such rooms where<br/>
the kids went. Whole families just all say together and when kids cried, the<br/>
priests just spoke louder. When I got older and moved to FL, the churches<br/>
here had the crying rooms like you described. But they were larger and for<br/>
whole families, not just crying kids and moms. So families with babies could<br/>
sit there and not disturb the others. The families were together and could<br/>
hear all that went on.<br/>
<br/>
Later on churches had the kid rooms with an adult or two present, but the<br/>
parents weren&#39;t suppose to stay. I could never see the point that if church<br/>
or service was something important to the family why the whole family wasn&#39;t<br/>
together for that part of it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably my favorite part about Mass (when we were going) was sitting close <br/>
with the kids, hugging, them laying their heads on my lap to rest or sleep, <br/>
stroking their heads and necks while listening to the homily.  When the kids got <br/>
a little older and could sit through the service, it became so peaceful...no <br/>
one talking, just sitting and touching, holding hands, hugging, kneeling and <br/>
praying together.  Church wouldn&#39;t be Church without all of us there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I worked at a daycare many years ago in downtown Cincinnati.  The daycare was <br/>
for the working parents who had MONEY!  LOT&#39;S OF MONEY!!!!  You wouldn&#39;t <br/>
believe the number of turnovers we had; employees came and employees went.  What I <br/>
found amazing is that when we had a new employee, we ALWAYS TRIED to <br/>
introduce them to the parent w/the child present.  Most parents were not very <br/>
interested because it &quot;took too much time,&quot; and gee, they were running late for work, <br/>
after all, so the normal response was:  &quot;Ok, I have to go now, I&#39;m already <br/>
running behind!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t understand parents sometimes.  Some of the worst cases of child <br/>
abuse are found in the daycare system and not just in the ones where the poor <br/>
children go!<br/>
