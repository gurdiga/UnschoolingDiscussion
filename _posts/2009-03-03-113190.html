<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727483796">After radically unschooling for 8 years, my oldest, Brady 16, attended a private college-prep high school for his freshman year.  Mostly, to play soccer.  He decided to return to unschooling after that.  I chronicled some of the experience on my blog.  This link should take you to all related posts:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com/search/label/An%20Unschooler%20Goes%20to%20School">http://piscesgrrrl.blogspot.com/search/label/An%20Unschooler%20Goes%20to%20School</a>  Unfortunately, the posts are out of order.  They&#39;re date-stamped, though.<br/>
<br/>
It was a fascinating experience - good, bad, ugly, and everything in between.  Lots of highs, lots of lows.  We learned a lot about ourselves - all of us.  We are happy for the experience and happy it&#39;s over.  :-)<br/>
