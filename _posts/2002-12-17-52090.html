&lt;&lt; Oh I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m not the only one who doesn&#39;t see it. Maybe we can start <br/>
out own little not a fan club!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nah, just tell us who you Do like and we can provide you with news on movies, <br/>
or websites, or just merrily agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like Kevin Costner, but I don&#39;t wish him ill.  I just wish to avoid <br/>
having to see him.<br/>
<br/>
I really like Charlton Heston movies.  I like the little cameo he did in <br/>
Wayne&#39;s World II.  I like Ben Hur.  I LOVE El Cid (which isn&#39;t on DVD, which <br/>
is very sad; and is only in one crummy video version).  The Ten Commandments <br/>
is pretty cool.  I&#39;ve been reading his autobiography and have been thinking <br/>
of trying to find some of the more obscure old movies he was in.  I don&#39;t <br/>
like westerns much, so I&#39;ll probably skip those.  I think the only <br/>
Shakespeare he was in was Julius Ceasar.  I bought a copy but it was cheap <br/>
and the sound never worked.  I should rent it.  <br/>
<br/>
Nothing&#39;s new on that front, though (but he has Alzheimers, which is sad).<br/>
<br/>
Of current guys I like Sam Rockwell.  He has two movies coming out soon, so <br/>
people who haven&#39;t heard of him will have before long.  He&#39;s in one movie <br/>
with Alan Rickman, and that&#39;s Galaxy Quest.  (He plays &quot;Guy.&quot;)  He did the <br/>
guy who does Thisbe in Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, and he plays the craziest of <br/>
the crazy guys in The Green Mile.  And starred in Lawn Dogs, but that&#39;s too <br/>
disturbing for most people to watch, maybe.  Box of Moonlight was odd but <br/>
good.  <br/>
<br/>
I like Hugh Grant, and am looking forward to &quot;Two Weeks Notice.&quot;  Really <br/>
liked &quot;About a Boy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like Denzel Washington and Viggo Mortensen, both of whom are in Crimson <br/>
Tide.<br/>
<br/>
I like movies better than I like actors, though.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow is Two Towers&#39; opening.  Kirby&#39;s going twice.  His boss takes all <br/>
the employees to first-day showings of things like that (Star Wars, LotR).    <br/>
  The family&#39;s going Friday at noon.  I want to wait for crowds to thin out <br/>
before I stump through with a broken leg.   Holly might rather hang out with <br/>
her friend than go.  She&#39;s not fulling into all that yet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Landon is going tonight at midnight to see LOTR. He is so excited.  He and <br/>
several friends bought advance tickets.   The theatre is about 35 mins from <br/>
our house,.. I guess I will be making some rounds tonight between 11 and 3 <br/>
am.  I sure wish I had thought to tell him to get me a ticket too, then I <br/>
could just stay there and watch the movie too.  The movie is already sold <br/>
out.  :-(   Walmart is nearby and open 24 hrs.. but I dont have 3 hours worth <br/>
of shopping left to do.    I will probably come home and take a nap then go <br/>
back to get them.     He said he might wear the cape I made him for a play <br/>
and take a sword that one of his (girl)friends bought him for Christmas as <br/>
sort of a gag gift.  They exchange the funniest gifts. He bought her a plush <br/>
stick unicorn that sings and talks, it was pink with braids and a  glowing <br/>
horn.  IT WAS SO FUNNY.. She loved pretty little pony when she was little, <br/>
and she got a great kick out the the magical unicorn.  Another friend, he <br/>
bought her a John Mayer CD.  He put it in a big box along with a 10# weight, <br/>
a stick of deodorant, and some spoons.  He put a note in the box.  &quot;I will be <br/>
needing some of the items in this box back as I put them in for weight and <br/>
comic value.. Namely, a John Mayer CD.. ... LOL.. I thought that was funny.  <br/>
OK, Im rambling.. Anyway.. LOTR premier, tonight at midnight.  Wish me luck <br/>
driving a van load of teenagers home at 3am!<br/>

You could play the sample video games! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could look at all the 2003 calendars, and listen to the sample CDs and <br/>
have your photo taken in the photo booth, and see if you can identify candle <br/>
scents with your eyes closed.  You could buy greeting cards for the next few <br/>
months&#39; birthdays and anniversaries.  You could buy candy for Christmas <br/>
stockigs, and stocking stuffers.  You could watch the fish in the pet <br/>
department.  <br/>

I really like *both* Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock, but all of the<br/>
commercials for that movie have looked so flat that I suspect it&#39;s<br/>
crummy.  (But that just could be me experiencing winter grinchiness. <br/>
Maybe the movie is good and I&#39;m just hard to please right now.)<br/>

My 13 yo likes sci fi AND Charlton Heston. So, we have seen three scifi videos  ( old - 70s) with Heston  in them, from the video store - The Omega Man,. Soylent Green ( I  liked this one) and Planet of the Apes. Have you seen these?..Leonie W.<br/>

I have a friend who&#39;s really, really into LOTR.  She&#39;s online discussing<br/>
it all the time (instead of talking about unschooling, go figure).<br/>
<br/>
She told me that fans in Portland (OR) took action and campaigned to get<br/>
a midnight showing.  I don&#39;t know all that they did, but it included<br/>
preselling 500 tickets.<br/>
<br/>
This won&#39;t help anyone who isn&#39;t near a big city, probably, but it might<br/>
make a fun citizen action project for the NEXT movie, The Return of the King.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638322692">That&#39;s sounds cool!   I&#39;ll have to look into it for December 2003,  I know my son would be all over helping me!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure we&#39;d have no problem getting it sold out,  the only thing would be convincing the movie theater owner to do it.    He has a real hard time thinking outside the box....     could try though.     I know I could sell tons of tickets at the video/gaming store in town.     <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for the idea.<br/>

I&#39;m jealous on people seeing LOTR right now,   we don&#39;t have late night<br/>
showings like that,   and we&#39;re<br/>
leaving to go out of town,   when we stay somewhere for longer than a<br/>
day,  I&#39;m in a theater!!!!**<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s really, really into LOTR.  She&#39;s online discussing<br/>
it all the time (instead of talking about unschooling, go figure).<br/>
<br/>
She told me that fans in Portland (OR) took action and campaigned to get<br/>
a midnight showing.  I don&#39;t know all that they did, but it included<br/>
preselling 500 tickets.<br/>
<br/>
This won&#39;t help anyone who isn&#39;t near a big city, probably, but it might<br/>
make a fun citizen action project for the NEXT movie, The Return of the King.<br/>

they enjoyed my &quot;cooperation&quot;  :-)  Oh, and btw, I have a total crush on <br/>
Orlando too .. oh myy!!.   The term &quot;sassy&quot; is a new one on me too. You <br/>
really have hear the way the girls say it to appreicate it.. .. Do you <br/>
remember the Taco Bell commmercial that used the word &quot;Zesty&quot;?  .. they <br/>
pointed things out and said.. &quot;Zes-ty&quot;  Thats how the girls say.. &quot;Sas-sy&quot;    <br/>
They have this other term they have coined and I think it is so cool and <br/>
really insightful as a way to describe things.   They call it &quot;ness&quot; , like <br/>
&quot;ness&quot; is a word all on its own.  For instance, craziness,   weirdness, <br/>
goodness.  etc etc.. Any situation that is extreme is referred to as some <br/>
&quot;ness&quot;    &quot;Ness&quot; is just the existance of something.  .. For instance.. <br/>
LOTR.. that was some cool  &quot;ness&quot;.. And Legolas, he is some hot &quot;ness&quot; for <br/>
sure.   Something might be some F&#39;ed up ness.    ..Or maybe they will say. <br/>
&quot;what kind of ness is this?&quot;..   Or maybe, &quot;screw all this ness&quot;   And right <br/>
now I am having some major rambling ness going on.   :-)<br/>
