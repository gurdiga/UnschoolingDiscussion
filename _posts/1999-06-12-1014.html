<div id="ygrps-yiv-628654530"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Many things are taught too early in school, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In December this year, when my dd was still 5 yrs.old, she decided she<br/>
wanted to go to Kindergarten, so I enrolled her in the afternoon class<br/>
with the same teacher her db had had.  She was read to quit after 1<br/>
week, but we stuck with it for a month.  I was rather relieved when she<br/>
decided she didn&#39;t want to go to school and especially happy about her<br/>
reasons.  She didn&#39;t like being told what to do and when(wasn&#39;t used to<br/>
it).  She wanted to complete whatever project she was working on at the<br/>
time(coloring, building blocks, etc.,) rather than stop just because it<br/>
was story time, or whatever.  I guess I have been unschooling all along,<br/>
I just hadn&#39;t labeled it as such. <br/>
<br/>
	Here is what I really couldn&#39;t believe or understand about her<br/>
Kindergarten class.  They were teaching them math!  I mean everyday they<br/>
had to sit down at the table as soon as they came to class(5 & 6<br/>
yr.olds), and do an equation.  That means they had to not only write it<br/>
out on a piece of paper(many of these children were just learning how to<br/>
write #&#39;s and letters and had a VERY difficult time with this exercise),<br/>
but were supposed to figure it out.  The teacher would have a<br/>
number(from 1-20) on the chalk board when they came in, and they were to<br/>
sit down and figure out what + what = that number. Oh they had number<br/>
lines, and little +/= signs, and manipulatives to help them to figure it<br/>
out(and 1-3 adults), but they were too young to be force fed these<br/>
concepts!  I was apalled.  The teacher explained to me one day how and<br/>
why this was good for them, and I new I was ready to take my daughter<br/>
home and keep her there.  These kids, for the most part, did not(could<br/>
not) understand what they were doing.  It was frustrating and boring for<br/>
them.  My dd tried her best, but this was the first thing she didn&#39;t<br/>
like about school and the way she experienced it was this:  She told me<br/>
she didn&#39;t like &quot;doing math&quot;, that she felt she wasn&#39;t learning at<br/>
school, and was beginning to think she was not very smart since she<br/>
didn&#39;t understand what was being &quot;taught&quot; her(actually they were told to<br/>
do, without being taught, and then might get some help).  This was very<br/>
troubling to me, so I told my dd not to worry about &quot;math&quot;, that she was<br/>
too young(vs.stupid) to understand it, and it didn&#39;t matter, just do the<br/>
best she could without worry(ya right), and concentrate on having fun,<br/>
because that was what she was supposed to be doing.  This helped a<br/>
little, but it didn&#39;t take away her worry and the fact that this was<br/>
whittling away at her self esteem, at 5 years old.  IT MADE ME WANT TO<br/>
SCREAM!  For the life of me, I can&#39;t believe they do that to those<br/>
children.  I am so glad my kids do not have to be put through that for<br/>
their entire childhood.  <br/>
<br/>
	Yes, and since bringing her back home with me and her brother where she<br/>
belongs and is free to learn  what she wants, when she wants, in the way<br/>
that is best for her, she has bounced back to her happy little carefree<br/>
and very independent 6 year old self.  I am so proud of my children.  I<br/>
just felt like sharing that experience with people who might appreciate<br/>
the way that I felt, and who understand the way that we live.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
