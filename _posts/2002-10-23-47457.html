<div id="ygrps-yiv-268916887">*** I never said I believed it was good, just that I believe it is a<br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
Every man who ever hit a woman made a choice to do so.  Would you not try<br/>
to help the woman?<br/>
There was a time when men had every legal right to make this choice.  It<br/>
only changed because moral people said, never mind legal, it&#39;s just<br/>
WRONG.  And today women who are hit can enlist the help of  the law.  <br/>
<br/>
Children who are hit have no such help.  I won&#39;t stand by comforting<br/>
myself with &quot;a parents right to choose&quot; while a child gets hit.   <br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t protect someone&#39;s imaginary &quot;right&quot; to spank because I fear I may<br/>
lose my homeschool freedom.<br/>
I&#39;ll stand up for that right on it&#39;s own merits.  I won&#39;t hide under the<br/>
blanket of &quot;parental rights&quot; at the expense of some innocent child.   And<br/>
I&#39;d stop anyone from smacking your kid if I was available to do it.<br/>
Too bad I couldn&#39;t count on you for the same.<br/>
