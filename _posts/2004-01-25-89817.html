<div id="ygrps-yiv-821934469">If you need a great sensory activity - I suggest a ball pit - (can be fancy store bought kind or as simple as a frig box filled w/ a bunch of soft plastic balls (the kind in the ball pits).  My dd&#39;s all had severe  integration issues when they were very little - the ball pit proved a sure way to &quot;unload&quot; the overloaded sensory system - or as a tool to prevent sensory overload before it starts.  And most kids love playing in the balls - regardless of age!<br/>
