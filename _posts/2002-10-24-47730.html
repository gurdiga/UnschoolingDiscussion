go and quit responding, but just couldn&#39;t resist. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was the one with the gentle advice! Hah! You can now all giggle! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
And I just can&#39;t help but respond to Quote 1!!!<br/>
<br/>
But I really try to know when to quit. Our suggestions are not going to <br/>
change anything. She&#39;s made up her mind and we&#39;re all just talking to hear <br/>
ourselves....??? maybe typing to hear our keyboards click??? Maybe if we all <br/>
ignore it, it will go away---or at least not push our buttons. Let it die. Or <br/>
it will go on & on & on & on.....<br/>
