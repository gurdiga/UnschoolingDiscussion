Tell Cacie that our hearts are with her during this time when <br/>
understanding an 88yo isn&#39;t easy.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother at 93 returned all of our &#39;stuff&#39; so that we would have it <br/>
when she goes. She&#39;s 95 now, lives alone by choice and her house is empty <br/>
of all the memories.<br/>

in the context of SEVERE situation. Say a child is conventionally <br/>
schooled and then loses their parents in a tragic accident. The aunt <br/>
takes over and wants to unschool. If a child is going through the loss of <br/>
something so dear, then taking away everything at once could make the <br/>
unschooling centered around the emotional trauma of the loss of parents, <br/>
and not a thing to be looked upon with fondness.<br/>
<br/>
And only in servere incidences should it be taken on with caution. <br/>
Otherwise, I say let it loose and let the unschooling commence!<br/>

I agree with you, Kolleen. They had a chance to raise us; now it&#39;s <br/>
our turn. I would welcome their involvement if it were on a positive <br/>
note but alas, it&#39;s quite the opposite. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-501493830">I&#39;ve seen it both good and bad.  My mom (a certified teacher, now <br/>
retired) was not very happy with my unschooling tendencies when we <br/>
first started this great adventure.  Now, she lives next door.  She <br/>
is perfectly accepting of the unschooling of my two oldest and I have <br/>
come around to her POV about my third child.  Pure unschooling was <br/>
not going to work for him no matter how much I wanted it to.  <br/>
So I guess you could say we compromised.  But you could also say we <br/>
were both right.  Unschooling works fine for many kids - but not ALL <br/>
kids.<br/>

<br/>
My grandma, now, she&#39;s 88 and a different story, since we&#39;ve been here<br/>
she&#39;s returned to Cacie all the presents Cacie ever gave her - and these<br/>
are homemade things that Cacie made when she was preschool-age, a trivet<br/>
with her handprint, a Christmas decoration that she painted, stuff like<br/>
that. It hurt Cacie a lot. She also basically orders us around, Cacie<br/>
probably more than anyone - &quot;Get me my purse&quot; &quot;Sing a song, I want to<br/>
hear how you sing&quot;, etc. She also came over and sat down at the table<br/>
where Cacie and I were putting together her playmobil fairy tale castle<br/>
and *gasp* messed up a set-up, just scooted the whole playground scene<br/>
back in a pile so she could put her arms there. She had no idea, of<br/>
course, but Cacie was still upset... but she&#39;s 88, and starting to lose<br/>
it mentally - she tells all the same stories every time we see her and<br/>
forgets the words to jingle bells - so we all try to avoid<br/>
confrontations, since she won&#39;t remember them next time we see her<br/>
anyway. She&#39;s not malicious at all.... I try to keep her occupied and run<br/>
interference.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we were having wine and she tasted hers and said it was too<br/>
dry, and told us that she usually put just a teaspoon full of maple syrup<br/>
in her wine at home, to make it sweeter. So I went to get the maple<br/>
syrup, and my dad (her son) came out to the kitchen with me and whispered<br/>
&quot;If I ask for maple syrup in my wine when I&#39;m 88, please just shoot me&quot;,<br/>
but she apparently liked it...<br/>
<br/>
The story she tells almost every time we see her is about how when she<br/>
started first grade, she didn&#39;t speak English very well (she emigrated<br/>
from Germany as an infant) and the kids would all tease her by singing<br/>
&quot;Irene Bauer, sitting in a tower, eating sauerkraut by the hour!&quot; And she<br/>
always laughs at this story... and I keep thinking how incredibly hurtful<br/>
it must have been at the time, to be 6 years old and heading off alone to<br/>
a place where you didn&#39;t really know the language, and where people<br/>
laughed at you because you were German-American. She doesn&#39;t remember it<br/>
as hurtful at all, she lauhs and laughs... which to me just points out<br/>
how dissociated she really is from her feelings...<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve rambled a lot, but my original point was that *I* do think<br/>
unschooling &quot;works&quot; for all kids, and since this is an unschooling list,<br/>
I figured someone ought to say that.<br/>

<br/>
As I recall, part of your argument on this point is that your son didn&#39;t<br/>
learn to read on his own by 8 or 9, so you decided that unschooling<br/>
reading wasn&#39;t working and now he goes to his grandma&#39;s house every day,<br/>
where she only gives him food after he does some school-ish reading work.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I remember is that your son watched a lot of tv and got<br/>
cranky, so you decided he couldn&#39;t unschool regarding tv.<br/>
<br/>
You defined these outcomes as unschooling &quot;not working&quot;. Other people<br/>
(including me) would define them as different paths and opportunities.<br/>
What you label as &quot;fast&quot; is clearly opinion...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988741936">Would you like to respond to what I actually say instead of what you <br/>
think I meant.  Yes I said he goes to my mom&#39;s and yes I said she <br/>
feeds him and that&#39;s big motivator for him but no, the food is not <br/>
dependent on jumping through any hoops and I never said it was.  <br/>
My son has some serious problems to overcome and burying my head in <br/>
the sand and expecting him to learn to deal with them on his own <br/>
would not be in his best interest.  TV is one of them.  And it i s <br/>
not a matter of just getting cranky.  He is a whole different and <br/>
much more unhappy person when left to his own devices regarding TV <br/>
and video games.<br/>
I also think that there are other moms out there struggling with the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-970143370">We are pretty fortunate in our family in that we get very little unasked for <br/>
advice. . . in fact, I think we get none. I believe its because we would not <br/>
tolerate anyone questioning the way we have decided to parent. FIL mentioned <br/>
last night he doesn&#39;t have a clue about relating to girls my daughter&#39;s age <br/>
(he does boy scouts and so thinks he knows all about boys ;). I mentioned <br/>
that homeschooled girls are much different also. . .and he said yes, he <br/>
noticed that. LOL. Probably from the fact that Lelia feels free to speak her <br/>
mind to him and say so when he does or says something she feels is wrong. I <br/>
don&#39;t imagine he is very used to that (he taught public schoole history for <br/>
38 years). My parents are a whole nother story. . . believe me, you wouldnt <br/>
want to hear it. But suffice to say, that because of our attitude, they dont <br/>
meddle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll even begin by agreeing with you - yes, there are other parents out<br/>
there struggling with issues of TV, and reading, and all sorts of of<br/>
things. That&#39;s why this list is here - because people do struggle with<br/>
these issues. It is difficult to relinquish control, to give your<br/>
children the freedom to develop at their own pace and find their own<br/>
limits. Mainstreamia is out there saying, &quot;If you don&#39;t force your kids<br/>
to do X and Y, they&#39;ll never learn and grow up to be Bad People.&quot; That&#39;s<br/>
hard to buck...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure there is a such thing as unschooling &quot;right&quot;. There&#39;s<br/>
unschooling and there&#39;s not unschooling, and calling one the other<br/>
doesn&#39;t change anything. I&#39;ll fall back on my vegetarianism example - if<br/>
you want to only eat meat when you&#39;re over at grandma&#39;s house every<br/>
morning, it&#39;s not that you&#39;re doing vegetarianism &quot;wrong&quot;, you&#39;re just<br/>
not a vegetarian. Which is fine - hell, I&#39;m not a vegetarian - but if<br/>
you&#39;re on a vegetarian list and someone posts about problems with, say, <br/>
low iron, suggesting that the person eat meat every morning at grandma&#39;s<br/>
is not going to be a welcome suggestion, nor should it be.<br/>
<br/>
So, sinec this is a list for supporting people in their unschooling<br/>
endeavors, if you (or anyone else) decide you want to unschool your son,<br/>
and you want to share your struggles and ask for help and support, we<br/>
will all be here to help you make it work. If you (or anyone) decide you<br/>
don&#39;t want to unschool your son, I&#39;m happy to send people subbing info<br/>
for other homeschooling lists, or schooling lists, where there are people<br/>
to support and help those making that choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74277155">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what she was saying. I do think, however, that <br/>
when a person comes to an *UN*schooling list asking for advice, <br/>
that&#39;s the kind of support they should receive... not a suggestion <br/>
that it might not work for their kid (as it didn&#39;t your son). As Dar <br/>
said, there are plenty of lists offering support and information for <br/>
those types of kids and one would get more useful advice like that <br/>
(schedules, texts, programs, charters etc.) if they sought it from <br/>
like-minded individuals. This list, however, is called unschooling <br/>
and I believe people expect *that* to be the focus. They come here <br/>
with doubts about it (as the poster so described) and imo if she were <br/>
*really* leaning toward a rigid schedule or school-type atmosphere, <br/>
she would have gone to one of the many, many other hsing lists. But <br/>
she didn&#39;t.... she wanted *unschooling* information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594335932">Actually, this started up again because Dar felt the need to claim <br/>
that I withhold food from my son if he does not do what I want him to <br/>
do.  I never said that, just as I NEVER said that what HE does is <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As for the issue of what people want to hear when they come here:  I <br/>
think unschooling is great and is the best way to live and should be <br/>
the ultimate goal for any family (of course when I said that my use <br/>
of the words self-sufficient was construed to somehow mean something <br/>
bad - still trying to figure that one out)<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, and this is the important part, I think that by telling <br/>
people that it ALWAYS works and that if it doesn&#39;t you are just not <br/>
really unschooling is destructive.  If a mom comes to you facing the <br/>
beginnings of the problems I&#39;ve been through for years, you can <br/>
either belittle her and make her feel at fault (which others have <br/>
said they have heard and felt here) or you can help her see that <br/>
others have been there done that and that there are respectful ways <br/>
to help while keeping the goal of total self-control and self-<br/>
direction in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, because of the past history here, many of my thoughts <br/>
and comments and advice get lost when someone posts something like <br/>
the above accusation of food control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034742573">Hi Lynda,<br/>
I think the analogy of unschoolers/veggies was a good one... it helped me to have a clearer picture. It may have been part of an old flame war but imo it was worth repeating (not the war.. the example). <br/>
It&#39;s my understanding that this list encourages unschooling, right? So if I&#39;m a newbie and I come here, I would expect answers and support that lean in that direction. I would expect to hear that &#39;this&#39; worked or &#39;that&#39; worked or an explanation of de-schooling... all that sort of stuff. I&#39;d *even* expect to see people writing in and saying,&#39; well Jane, that may have worked for you but it didn&#39;t for us. We had to try blah blah blah&quot; *INSTEAD* (and you&#39;d see another positive suggestion). <br/>
In Bridget&#39;s case, when she brings up her son, it&#39;s a completely different circumstance. He&#39;s got OCD & other disorders that I&#39;m not familiar with (I stopped reading the thread after awhile). It&#39;s because of these disorders that unschooling isn&#39;t working for him... *NOT* because of a need to de-school or anything unschoolish. It&#39;s a *medical* reason, which, btw, has other lists that address those particular issues.  Turning to an unschooling list for advice about something due to medical issues *or* using an unschooling list to discourage unschooling( which isn&#39;t working due to medical reasons) ..... well, it&#39;s simply not the place for that discussion! The medical issues have to be dealt with first.<br/>
Let&#39;s take another example. Let&#39;s say I have a child who can&#39;t read because she says the pages are blurry. One could assume she needs her eyes checked and perhaps needs glasses.  It would be my responsibility to look into that with a professional medical person. But if I *didn&#39;t* yet I responded to every poster who wrote in saying they were having trouble with their kid reading by suggesting that unschooling might not work because it&#39;s not working for my dd, then I can see why everybody on the list would be defensive and counter my posts with strong rebuttals. It&#39;s not working for *me* because *I&#39;m* not addressing the underlying issue first!<br/>
If there&#39;s another list out there that would fill my needs better than this one, I&#39;d want somebody to point me in that direction.  Now, barring old flame wars, isn&#39;t that what just happened in the previous posts that occurred over the last few days?<br/>

  I wasn&#39;t talking about to unschool or not to unschool.  I was talking about<br/>
  flogging that old dead horse &quot;vegetarian/unschooling take yourself off to<br/>
  another list&quot; comments that are almost word for word part of a supposed<br/>
  flame war that went on a couple of months ago.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577198035">It seems to me that anyone who reads what I&#39;ve said (especially in <br/>
the past week) as anti-unschooling or even discouraging unschooling <br/>
at all . . . well, I have to wonder why that person is so defensive <br/>
about the issue and if she is so unsecure in her choice that any <br/>
discussion of problems that may need to be addressed is viewed as a <br/>
threat.<br/>
<br/>
It would seem that either my words are not being taken at face value <br/>
and are being re-interpreted based on what certain people think I do <br/>
at home or what certain people think I mean based on previous <br/>
misunderstanding, or some insecurity is creeping in somewhere.<br/>

&gt; either belittle her and make her feel at fault (which others have<br/>

&gt; to help while keeping the goal of total self-control and self-<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think it&#39;s way too soon to offer that type of advice to someone who<br/>
has just found unschooling. Unschooling &quot;not working&quot; (though I&#39;m not<br/>
conceding that point) is going to look a lot like deschooling. In fact to a<br/>
schooled mind unschooling *working* is going to look like &quot;not working&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Wanting to watch TV all day is a perfectly normal thing for a child who has<br/>
been schooled for years. It may even go on for quite a while. To suggest<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you find he is stuck in a loop of TV watching and video<br/>
&gt; game playing, see what happens if you limit it.  My son has lots of<br/>
&gt; problems but his flat out obsession with electronic stimuli is the<br/>
&gt; biggest one.  Video games, Nintendo 64 particularly, seem to fry his<br/>
&gt; brain.  TV spirals into constant watching (even stuff he admits he<br/>
&gt; hates to watch) unless we help him keep it in control.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to someone who is likely to see an hour or two of TV as &quot;stuck in a loop&quot; is<br/>
going to hamper them in letting go and getting unschooling. I *do*<br/>
understand that you feel your son is different, but to most people used to<br/>
schoolish ways the above description would apply to a lot of deschooling<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
A newly unschooling parent is going to see problems everywhere. Later, when<br/>
someone truly gets unschooling, then any rough spots can be dealt with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885565934">Okay, I will concede that.  When I speak of a loop of TV and video <br/>

her son was glued to it to the exclusion of all else, including eating, <br/>
bathroom breaks and other things that the child<br/>
wants to do.  Yet limiting TV was one of your first suggestions.  I still <br/>
say that if you want to give advice that&#39;s contradictory to the unschooling <br/>
philosophy, you&#39;re going to get called on it,  especially when you suggest <br/>
to someone after their very first worried post that unschooling might not <br/>
work for their son.  (And before you say that wasn&#39;t exactly what you said, <br/>
saying that it doesn&#39;t work for every kid, in the context of that <br/>
conversation, is a suggestion that it might not work for her son.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To me, that sums up your misunderstanding of unschooling.  It isn&#39;t about <br/>
letting go a little bit.  It&#39;s about turning the decisions over to the <br/>
child and trusting that the child will make the right ones for him/her.<br/>

<br/>
This is a perfect example of what messed up the list, just classic.<br/>
Bridget just wants to argue. She doesn&#39;t want to address any of the<br/>
issues, she doesn&#39;t want to talk about unschooling. She wants to &quot;win&quot; an<br/>
argument, and then she wants to convince all of us that she&#39;s truly doing<br/>
the best thing for her son. It is really important to her that we all<br/>
believe this, because she doesn&#39;t believe it herself.<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing makes me feel really sad. I think both Bridget and her<br/>
son would be happier if she could just let go of her obsession with<br/>
getting this list to tell her she&#39;s doing the right thing, but I don&#39;t<br/>
see it happening. Bridget seems to be hurting a lot, and I wish she could<br/>
find a place to get the suppport she needs.<br/>
