 </span></blockquote>I guess if you were to ask a redneck, that might be A reason. Others would be <br/>
history, respect for the confederacy and the fallen soldiers, tradition, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Others would say it stands for hatred and bigotry.<br/>
<br/>
The North says the WAR was fought over slavery. The South says it was fought <br/>
over state&#39;s rights.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you could better say that the CONFEDERACY stood for state&#39;s rights, <br/>
not the flag.<br/>
<br/>
This is STILL a HOT topic here in SC, where the confederate flag flew over <br/>
the state house until last year!<br/>

State&#39;s rights to have slaves (think the practically-uninvolved far-westies <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).<br/>

So I&#39;ll shut up about that during the second weekend in October, okay?<br/>

But really, I have NO right to have an opinion, as I have no real interest in <br/>
the civil war and only finally watched Gone With the Wind this summer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649115810">A very good documentary to watch is &quot;The Civil War&quot; by Ken Burns.  It<br/>
was put on by PBS.  And the civil war in many ways started in the west<br/>

Kansas or New Mexico or whatever might be nice to add to their collection and <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kansas was a hot spot for slavery issues. The preacher John Brown fought for <br/>
slave rights here and elsewhere. Quantrill and his men burned the town of <br/>
Lawrence. I know of three territorial capitol sites. One in a small town just <br/>
east of here between Topeka and Lawrence, called Lecompton. There was a race, <br/>
(between Top. and Lec.) to see which could get their bridge across the Kansas <br/>
River built first. That would be the actual state capitol. And it all hinged <br/>
on &quot;states rights&quot; and whether Kansas would be a free state or not. There <br/>
were quite a few skirmishes fought here. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is that making the NATIONAL news STILL?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s Maurice Bessinger. He actually has a confederate MUSEUM in the <br/>
restaurant!<br/>
His BBQ placed 2nd in a blind tasting we has at my house 8 years ago. He used <br/>
to sell a lot of Q nationwide until the flag issue went national. He&#39;s been <br/>
in the news again here lately because the local gas & electric company banned <br/>
any flags or confederate stickers on employees&#39; cars in their (SCE&G&#39;s) <br/>
parking lot. Maurice said that they were welcome to park in HIS lot! Even has <br/>
signs welcoming them. <br/>
<br/>
It will NEVER go away.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I had BBQ Saturday night. But not at &quot;Piggie Park&quot;; at &quot;Hammy&#39;s&quot;. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
