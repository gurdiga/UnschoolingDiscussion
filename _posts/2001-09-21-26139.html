&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Anyone  have a<br/>
&gt; favorite crockpot recipe? I need a few for snowboard season. Or <br/>
&gt; things your<br/>
&gt; kids like to make to eat? Ds loves to cook. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Beware:  All crockpots are different.  I never give definite times.  <br/>
<br/>
Barbeque Beef or Pork<br/>
Get three or four pounds of roast.  Cut it into chunks and throw it in<br/>
the crockpot with a bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce.  Add a little bit<br/>
of water (1/4 of a bottle while I rinse the bottle is what I do.)  Turn<br/>
on High if you want it in 4 or 5 hours or low for all day.  When cooked<br/>
through and the pieces are falling apart, pull them out of the liquid and<br/>
pull them apart on a plate.  Discard any fatty or grisly bits and throw<br/>
it back into the sauce.  Stir well.  Serve on buns or over toast.<br/>
<br/>
Italian Sausage Sandwiches<br/>
Pour one can of diced tomatoes into crock.  Add enough sausages till<br/>
about  2/3&#39;s full.  Cover that with slices of onion and red and green<br/>
peppers.  Add another can of tomatoes and enough water to almost cover<br/>
the veggies.  Cook for several hours WITHOUT PEEKING!  Lifting the lid<br/>
messes with this one.  After three or four hours stir the veggies into<br/>
the juice if needed and finish cooking.  Serve with Hoagie rolls.<br/>
<br/>
Pork and Sauerkraut<br/>
Three pound pork roast OR three pounds of western style ribs, two or<br/>
three pounds of Kraut, a sprinkling of caraway seeds if you like.  Dump<br/>
all in and cook.  Serve with mashed potatoes.  (I make Bisquik dumplings<br/>
now that I have a pot that stays hot enough to do it.  My old one<br/>
couldn&#39;t keep the temp high enough with the lid off.)  <br/>
<br/>
FUN THINGS TO DO WITH FROZEN BREAD DOUGH!!!!  <br/>
(or bread machine dough)<br/>
WARNING - all cooking times are approximate.<br/>
<br/>
1.  Make pizza.<br/>
2.  Monkey Bread - thaw bread and cut each loaf in to 32 pieces.  Roll<br/>
each piece in melted butter then in cinnamon sugar.  Drop into greased<br/>
Bundt pan or Angel Cake pan.  Drizzle top with a little extra butter and<br/>
sugar.  Let rise.  Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes - check frequently -<br/>
your time may vary.  Turn onto a plate immediately but wait to remove the<br/>
pan.  Let the goo drip down for a while first!<br/>
3. Pepperoni Rolls - thaw bread.  Cut each loaf into 12 pieces.  Flatten<br/>
each piece, top with a slice of sandwich pepperoni or salami and roll<br/>
jelly roll style.  Seal the seams.  Let rise (pinch any seams that pop). <br/>
Bake at 350 for 20 minutes or so.  Optional - add slice of provolne or<br/>
mozzarella with the meat.<br/>
4.  Chopped Bread - Thaw bread.  Flatten loaf slightly and throw in some<br/>
stuff (cheese, pepperoni, veggies, spices, whatever)  With a LARGE knife<br/>
start hacking at it.  When it is all a big pile of blocks of stuff, pile<br/>
it about 1&quot; high on a greased cookie sheet and bake at 350 till done<br/>
5.  Cinnamon Rolls - Thaw bread, roll one loaf out as thin as you can. <br/>
Spread thickly with butter and sprinkle on cinnamon and sugar (I like<br/>
brown sugar but your choice).  Roll as tightly as you can.  Slice about<br/>
2&quot; thick and place in greased pan.  (I make lots at a time but you need<br/>
to choose a pan that just fits the rolls you are making.  One loaf is<br/>
about a 9x9 pan for me I think.  Let rise and bake at 350 for about 30<br/>
minutes.  Turn onto a plate immediately but wait to remove the pan.  Let<br/>
the goo drip down for a while first!  Frost if you want but we don&#39;t.  <br/>
Optional - sprinkle pecans into the pan before placing the rolls in, or<br/>
sprinkle pecans on with the sugar and roll them in.<br/>
<br/>
AND ONE LAST RECIPE - Feel free to think up a name for these!<br/>
BTW - these look really gross bet they are delicious!<br/>
<br/>
2 lbs chip chop ham (Isaly&#39;s if you can get it) ground up or chopped fine<br/>
1 lb shredded cheese (cheddar or swiss or whatever)<br/>
1 med onion chopped very fine<br/>
9 hard boiled eggs shredded<br/>
mayonaise (the real kind)<br/>
yellow mustard<br/>
30 or so hot dog buns<br/>
Aluminum foil<br/>
<br/>
Mix the first four ingredients.  Add enough mayo and mustard to bind.<br/>
(you can adjust till you like the mustardy-ness - I like lots!)  Spoon<br/>
into hot dog buns.  Wrap each sandwich with foil (shiny side in) and<br/>
freeze till needed.  To eat - put frozen sandwich in toaster oven or oven<br/>
and bake at 325 for at least 1/2 hour - until center is warm.<br/>
If you wish to eat them the day you are making them, you can just line<br/>
them up in a baking pan and cover the pan with foil - no need to wrap<br/>
each one.  Baking times vary.<br/>

    I have a frozen bread dough one too.<br/>
Stromboli<br/>
1/4 C prepared yellow mustard<br/>
2T chopped fresh basil or 2t dried<br/>
1T chopped green olives<br/>
1lb frozen bread dough, thawed at room temp(I use the overnight thawing<br/>
method)<br/>
1/4 lb sliced provolone cheese<br/>
1/4lb sliced ham<br/>
2oz thinly sliced pepperoni (2in diameter)<br/>
1 egg, beaten<br/>
1t poppy or sesame seeds<br/>
1/4lb salami<br/>
    Grease a baking sheet. Stir the mustard, basil and olives in a sm bowl,<br/>
set aside<br/>
    Roll the dough on a floured surface to a 16x10in rectangle. Arrange the<br/>
salami on the dough, overlapping slices & leaving about 1in border around<br/>
edges.<br/>
    Spread 1/2 the mustard mixture thinly over the salami<br/>
    Arrange the provolone & the ham over the salami. spread the remaining<br/>
mustard mix. Top with pepperoni.<br/>
    Fold one-third of the dough toward center from the long edge off the<br/>
rectangle. Fold other side in and seal, pinch together.<br/>
    Pinch ends closed and tuck under the dough. Place in the prepared baking<br/>
sheet. Cover and let rise in warm place for 15 min<br/>
    Heat oven to 375. Cut shallow crosswise slits 3in apart. Brush with the<br/>
beaten egg; sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake 25 min or until brown. Salad and<br/>
drink and we&#39;re set. It said 12 servings but it feed my family of 5 with<br/>
only *sometimes* a little left over.</div>
