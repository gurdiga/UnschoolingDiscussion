&lt;&lt;My daughter is also asking for more structure in math.  It must be<br/>
<br/>
partially age related because she is about to turn 11.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When she&#39;s ready for Algebra, Harold Jacob&#39;s book, _Algebra_, is a great one. <br/>
 It is both thoughtful and friendly, which are rare qualities in a math book.<br/>
<br/>
(OK, I&#39;ve only read the first 2 chapters and set it aside, but that&#39;s because <br/>
my son&#39;s  only 5.  My copy is currently loaned out to my 65 year old mother, <br/>
who always wished she understood Algebra better.  She likes the cartoons in <br/>
the book!)<br/>
