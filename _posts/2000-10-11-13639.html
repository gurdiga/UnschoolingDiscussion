<div id="ygrps-yiv-625891411">Hello again all,<br/>
<br/>
If there has been any positive side-effect of the ongoing &quot;education <br/>
crisis&quot; in Japan, it may be the willingness of the Japanese news media to <br/>
respectfully consider educational alternatives such as homelearning, free <br/>
schools and the like.<br/>
<br/>
Following in that same vein is a story here that was carried a few days <br/>
ago in a major Japanese daily paper. This article is about an alternative <br/>
school in Okinawa that, like many other such institutions, is helping to <br/>
redefine the concept of &quot;contemporary education&quot; in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>

CHILD&#39;S INTEREST COMES FIRST<br/>
<br/>
by Kazuko Fujimoto<br/>
Special to Asahi Evening News<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is there room in Japan&#39;s rigid school system for a school that aims to <br/>
help each student cultivate his or her particular talents? Not likely, <br/>
would be the reply of pessimists, who tend to associate this country&#39;s <br/>
schools with such terms as &quot;standardized&quot; and &quot;control.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But an attempt to prove them wrong is being undertaken by students and <br/>
their instructors at the Dream Planet International School, which opened <br/>
a year and a half ago in Okinawa Prefecture.<br/>
<br/>
Breaking with tradition, the school has no end-of-term exams or report <br/>
cards, and the students are not required to attend lessons that do not <br/>
interest them.<br/>
<br/>
To cap its unconventionality, the school was founded by a young <br/>
visionary, a woman who had perceived the shortcomings of Japanese schools <br/>
as a child. &quot;Asu wo Tsukamu Gakko&quot; (&quot;&#39;Seize the Dream&#39; School,&quot; published <br/>
by Home-sha Inc., 1,500 yen) describes the path taken by Tomoko Shirai, <br/>
Dream Planet&#39;s 27-year-old principal, as well as the budding <br/>
institution&#39;s eventful first year.<br/>
<br/>
The future author was 4 years old when her engineer father was <br/>
transferred to Sydney. Tomoko did not utter a word during her year at <br/>
kindergarten in Australia but she remembers learning &quot;to observe my <br/>
surroundings and perceive what lies in and behind other people&#39;s <br/>
expressions and words.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A lasting impression<br/>
<br/>
Years later, that gift was to help her immensely in dealings with her own <br/>
students. Encouraged by her Australian classmates and teachers, she <br/>
eventually opened up and was impressed by a system that respected each <br/>
pupil&#39;s individuality.<br/>
<br/>
At age 8 she returned to Japan and entered a public primary school where <br/>
bullying was rampant and the teachers were caught up in union struggles.<br/>
<br/>
Witnessing an incompetent teacher hit pupils who had poor grades, young <br/>
Tomoko began to question the notion that grades were a good measure of <br/>
the child&#39;s worth. Upon graduating from a private senior high, she <br/>
proceeded to the University of Tokyo, fully expecting to meet &quot;capable, <br/>
interesting people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The prestigious school comprising &quot;elitist students who believed that <br/>
good grades made them better people&quot; disappointed Shirai, who began <br/>
searching for a vocation at an early stage.<br/>
<br/>
A friend to whom she confided that she wanted to be of use to people <br/>
appalled her by replying: &quot;I don&#39;t have any particular ambition in mind <br/>
so I might as well become a public servant.&quot; (The friend went on to join <br/>
the Ministry of Finance.)<br/>
<br/>
After she graduated, Shirai joined the Matsushita Institute of Government <br/>
and Management, established by the industrialist Konosuke Matsushita to <br/>
develop future leaders. She finally decided to focus on &quot;reform of <br/>
primary-school education&quot; and spent the next two years visiting 100 <br/>
schools in Japan and abroad.<br/>
<br/>
Realizing at last that reforming the system would simply take too long, <br/>
Shirai hit upon the idea of founding her own school.<br/>
<br/>
Help came in the person of Masayuki Makino, director of the Okinawa-based <br/>
Creative Artist Academy, whose graduates include the top pop singer Namie <br/>
Amuro.<br/>
<br/>
When they realized that they shared the same vision, Shirai and Makino <br/>
decided to open a 12-year international school with the motto: Only One. <br/>
Some 1,200 inquiries poured in from around Japan despite the fact that <br/>
the Dream Planet diploma is not recognized within the Japanese school <br/>
system.<br/>
<br/>
Shirai had a hard time finding a school building, since more than one <br/>
municipality was swayed by the groundless rumor that Dream Planet was to <br/>
be a &quot;school for dropouts and delinquents.&quot; Her search came to an end <br/>
when the owner of a resort hotel in Onnason village offered her use of <br/>
the building&#39;s first floor.<br/>
<br/>
In April last year the Dream Planet International School welcomed its <br/>
first 125 scholars, some of whom became boarders. The 15 instructors <br/>
Shirai had selected were asked to awaken each student&#39;s interest rather <br/>
than to &quot;teach&quot; in conventional ways.<br/>
<br/>
When they arrived at this new school where no subject matter was <br/>
compulsory, many students felt daunted by the prospect of discovering <br/>
their own dream. At all times they were encouraged to pursue their <br/>
studies, and delve into personal projects, with one basic criterion in <br/>
mind: to follow whatever interested them.<br/>
<br/>
During the initial months, however, the school lapsed into a &quot;lawless <br/>
state&quot; as students mistook &quot;self-interest&quot; for &quot;freedom.&quot; Shirai and her <br/>
staff spent hours talking with each student in a bid to help everyone <br/>
discard certain traits he or she might have picked up over the year -- be <br/>
it unbridled egotism, opportunism, an inferiority complex or excessive <br/>
faith in grades.<br/>
<br/>
When one student lamented that she had no friends, Shirai advised her to <br/>
take her time since &quot;making friends is possible only after you have <br/>
trained yourself to stand on your own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not without her critics<br/>
<br/>
As the months went by, the students began to change and, by the end of <br/>
the first semester, writes Shirai, &quot;the sparkle was back in the <br/>
children&#39;s eyes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since its opening, Dream Planet has attracted many visitors, ranging from <br/>
aspiring students to educators and politicians. An education critic <br/>
skeptical of the Dream Planet approach once asked Shirai how she expected <br/>
her students to acquire &quot;basic scholastic skills&quot; taught in primary and <br/>
junior high schools everywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
While not making light of their importance, Shirai does not believe that <br/>
children need to learn the same thing at the same time or be told off for <br/>
failing to do so. What she does believe is that &quot;recognizing where <br/>
children&#39;s talent lies, and helping bring out their personalities and <br/>
refine their communication skills, count more than simply teaching them <br/>
how to read and write or to obey the rules.&quot;<br/>
