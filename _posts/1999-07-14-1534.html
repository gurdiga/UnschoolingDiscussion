<div id="ygrps-yiv-679309316">I&#39;ve just read The Matchlock Gun.  I&#39;m going to read it outloud to my<br/>
kids.  Its a big scary and harsh, but I think the kids will be fine.  I<br/>
would like to delve further into the native american issue though.  I<br/>
think it leaves a bad impress on them.  Has anyone read this?  Any<br/>
further reading anyone can suggest?<br/>
I is set near Albany around 1757.  The French are leading the indians<br/>
out of Canada to raid the British Colonies.  We did read The courage of<br/>
Sarah Noble.  We loved that, and it was a nice portrayal of fear and<br/>
temperance.  Of course I can&#39;t remember what year it was set in though.<br/>
(minor detail)<br/>
My kids are 6, 4 and 3.  This is mostly for the 6 and 4 yr olds.<br/>
I especially like that both books are true stories.  I&#39;m going to try to<br/>
make a timeline so we can keep track of all these people and when they<br/>
lived.<br/>
Thanks everyone,<br/>

I started these two books with the boys last year, but they were in their, I <br/>
hate to read modes, so I didn&#39;t push it.  I was thinking of trying again this <br/>
coming year, but I am wondering what bothers you about the native american <br/>
issue.  Do the books present the native americans as the bad guy, like <br/>
everything I was ever taught in my &quot;schooling&quot;?  I am interested to know, <br/>
cause if they are, I won&#39;t even bother with them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819340131">It&#39;s been several years since I read The Matchlock Gun, but we&#39;re doing some<br/>
reading on the period. One book you might try is called Thunder from the<br/>
Clear Sky by Marcia Sewall. It is the story of the Wampanoags and the<br/>
Pilgrims, written alternately from a Wampanoag&#39;s viewpoint and that of a<br/>
Pilgrim. It is a picture book, but the language is not always easy. I&#39;m<br/>
reading it aloud to a 10- and 6-yo, and often stop to explain what the<br/>
native American is saying. It&#39;s been good for discussing the<br/>
misunderstandings, the good intentions gone awry, racism, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Another book set more contemporaneously with Matchlock Gun, but probably too<br/>
much for your young kids, is Indian Captive by Lois Lenski. This is the true<br/>
story of the captivity of Mary Jemison, and is pretty tense and scary in<br/>
parts. She eventually decides to stay with the Seneca who adopt her, so the<br/>
reader is left with a pretty favorable impression of the native Americans.<br/>

We loved The Courage Of Sarah Noble.  It was a wonderful story.  Especially for<br/>
the younger kids.<br/>
The Matchlock Gun is terrific too.  I would definitely read it.  I am going to<br/>
read it aloud.<br/>
Lets see, how to explain my feelings.    It shows a realistic fear of the native<br/>
americans.  This is a true story, and it is quite graphic.  But I think my kids<br/>
will handle it fine with some talk.  I just don&#39;t want my kids left with the<br/>
generalization that all  &quot;indians&quot; are going to attack and kill and burn.  Yes,<br/>
some did.  Some were like that, but there were others like those in Sarah Noble.<br/>
I guess it&#39;s just going to take some talking to explain that like all of us....we<br/>
are all different.  We all live differently and in different ways, and we have<br/>
reasons for what we do.<br/>
I really do think that it is worth reading.  It is a realistic portrayal of life<br/>
then.  Very scary.  But, I think the kids can understand that.<br/>
Does this make any sense?<br/>
I&#39;m one of those that has lots of feelings, but can never get them down on paper<br/>
as well as they are in my head.  :)<br/>

Thanks for that information, they both sound good, and since I still read <br/>
aloud to both my boys, it should be a good time to discuss things, as you <br/>
suggested.<br/>

Yes, I think you did a very good job of describing your feelings.  I think I <br/>
will read the book to myself, then deal with it with the boys.  I am also <br/>
going to try the books Laura mentioned.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
