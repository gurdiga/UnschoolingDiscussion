<div id="ygrps-yiv-484319651">A sudbury school would be the only kind of school I would send my <br/>

make sure it really is what it&#39;s supposed to be (like the original one <br/>
in MA), though. And if your daughter is not happy with it, you can <br/>
always go back to unschooling.<br/>

I used to tell people, tongue in cheek, that if I really screwed up my kids I <br/>
would just put them in school and those special ed teachers could get them <br/>
all caught up.<br/>
<br/>
First (every time) they would look at me, stunned, thinking.  As though they <br/>
thought I was serious. <br/>
<br/>
But what happened (every time, and I was usually talking to teachers or <br/>
former teacher friends of mine) is they would run the scenario themselves of how <br/>
school treats kids who are behind.<br/>
<br/>
And then they would get the joke and smile and be TOTALLY softer and sweeter.<br/>
<br/>
Special ed doesn&#39;t help kids catch up.  It just keeps them from bugging the <br/>
other kids and teachers, and teaches them some life skills (&quot;life skills&quot; means <br/>
usually, in school-talk, learning to cope better with school).<br/>

My daughter (age 10) has gone to two Sudbury Schools and has just started unschooling again.  She spent a year at each school and enjoyed it for the most part.  I too thought that it would be nice to have the community, but for me that didn&#39;t really work out.  This may have been because both schools were about 1/2 hour away from home, so it was hard to get Chloe together with other kids after school etc.  I didn&#39;t like having a school schedule even though it&#39;s very flexible as far as time to drop off and pick up.  You&#39;ll still get the comments about &quot;what if it doesn&#39;t work&quot;.  People ask, &quot;what about homework?&quot;, and &quot;what, no classes are required?&quot;.  In the end I decided it was a lot of money to pay to do the same thing we had been doing at home prior to her going.  From her perspective, she loved it and would go again if it were convenient for our family.  We are planning to move to an area that doesn&#39;t have a Sudbury school so it won&#39;t be an issue.  <br/>
<br/>
I also have two friends from the SS in CA who have just left the school and are going to homeschool.  Most of the SS&#39;s have a problem with maintaining their populations.  They usually are struggling for money.  In fact the one here on Maui did a lot of fundraising this school year.  I do have to say that if I absolutely had to send my daughter to school that&#39;s the only kind of school I would consider.  <br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?  If it&#39;s the Santa Clara school I can give you more info if you want to email privately.<br/>

I&#39;ve been a member here for about 6 months now, think unschooling makes a lot of sense, but am still personally uncomfortable with the idea of actually doing it - uncomfortable with the comments I&#39;d get from family/friends and just a huge, scary, &quot;What if it doesn&#39;t work?&quot; thought keeps popping in my head.<br/>
 <br/>
Fortunatley, my son is just 14 months, so I don&#39;t have to make a decision right away.<br/>
 <br/>
In doing a little research on local schools, I found that there is a Sudbury school about 4 blocks from me.  I like the sense of community available - I feel like we&#39;d be so alone/sheltered if it was just Rory and I.  I like that I can say he&#39;s going to school to anyone who asks.  I like that it&#39;s based on unschooling principles and ideas.<br/>
 <br/>
But if he&#39;s going to school, I guess it&#39;s not unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve read so many interesting discussions and ideas here and would love to hear the group&#39;s thoughts on Sudbury schools - opposed to regualr schooling and opposed to unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you!<br/>

I only know about Sudbury schools by what I have read. And from what I have<br/>
read, if one has the money and wants the whole school scene and one is close<br/>
by, then okay. I feel like if a child *has* to go to school, then a Sudbury<br/>
is the way to go. But I still think unschooling is better.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend here who was very relaxed with her two kids. They saw a<br/>
Sudbury piece on 60 Minutes and wanted to go. She moved to Oregon as they<br/>
had a free public Sudbury school there. I was curious to know how they did.<br/>
No one has heard from her so I can&#39;t really say how that went.<br/>

<br/>
I think Sudbury schools sound wonderful. I have no problem with the concept and I&#39;ve heard happy things from people that use them...except most unschoolers I&#39;ve heard from have usually decided they can do their own thing MUCH less expensively.<br/>
The problem I have is with your first statement of the quote I pasted above.<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t take this wrong, but I wonder why your child&#39;s happiness and choices would come lower on the priority list than what other people think.<br/>
If your child wanted to be home, would you listen, regardless of what others thought? I think it takes a tough skin to unschool in a lot of ways and if you don&#39;t develop that, unschooling has very little chance of success.<br/>
I understand the fears, most of us dealt with some level of fear and questioning. And with your child being so young, you do have time to develop that thick skin!:)<br/>
I think if you believe wholeheartedly in something, to the very core of your being, if you KNOW without a doubt that it is right and best, the opinions of other people become irrelevant. <br/>
That&#39;s where you need to get if unschooling is your choice. And I can&#39;t think of a better way than to read, read, read and maybe meet some real life unschoolers. There is the conference in August you know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195550937">If my son wanted to stay home, I would certainly let him.  <br/>
<br/>
To me, it isn’t an issue of choosing his happiness over other people’s<br/>
personal issues.  If he never goes to school, how would I know if he’d<br/>
be happier there – and conversely, if he goes to school exclusively, how<br/>
would I know he’d be happier at home (assuming he doesn’t ask me to stay<br/>
home).  It’s just trying to find the right fit for our family.  I *love*<br/>
unschooling principles and ideas.  I wish I had that as a child.  But<br/>
it’s taking a while for me to really BELIEVE in it all, that it can work<br/>
and he will flourish and learn and grow if allowed to do so on his own<br/>
schedule.  Like you said – I’m lucky that he is so young so that I can<br/>
have more time to let it all sink in.  Perhaps I will attend a<br/>
conference in the years to come so I can see unschooling kids and their<br/>
families in action.<br/>
<br/>
I have to work on my own deschooling I think.  I’m a very schooly<br/>
person.  I’m amazed that he can start kindergarten next fall.  Half of<br/>
me is pulling to put him in a program a few mornings a week for the<br/>

people and things we don’t have at home or know about or whatever – not<br/>
for the ABC’s or anything) and half of me is thinking I shouldn’t even<br/>
start down that path.  I am honestly really torn up about it all.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully by the time he’s school age I can move to the backwoods where<br/>
the PS are terrible and like an hour away and the choice will be made<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006112306">Hi Michelle,<br/>
You ought to take a look at the HSC conference in Sacramento this August (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://conference.hsc.org/)">http://conference.hsc.org/)</a>.  It&#39;s not exclusively unschooling, but it will give you are good idea of what homeschooling families are like.  They definitely have unschooling talks and workshops and you might meet some unschooling families there.  I have two friends from the Sudbury school who are going to start homeschooling this fall and will be attending the conference. <br/>
<br/>
It does sound like you need some deschooling.  Have you read any John Holt yet?  There is a new version of Teach Your Own out and you might also like Learning All the Time.  You should also check out The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith.  You mentioned your son would be able to go to K next year, but won&#39;t he only be about 2 years old??  Anyway, my daughter never went to preschool and was able to be in groups of little kids because I was part of a Mom&#39;s group that met when the babies were about 2 months old and met every week for many years.  You can visit zoos and children&#39;s museums and just have a good time playing with him.  Even if he only has play times with one or two other children he will learn all he needs about being in a group at this young age.  Please think and about unschooling a while before starting anything like preschool.  You have plenty of time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954647191">**This is what Im looking for.  Why do you think unschooling is better?**<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Michelle --<br/>
<br/>
I know that the Santa Clara (CA) Sudbury school has flexible drop off<br/>
and pick up times, but isn&#39;t there a core number of hours that the<br/>
student has to be at the school, or nearby, per week?  (I know they are<br/>
allowed to leave the campus, but how far can they get?)  Doesn&#39;t that<br/>
limit what they could be learning/doing in that time?  A local<br/>
unschooling family could be going anywhere, e.g. enjoying an off-season<br/>
day at the beach or a trip to the Aquarium, visiting grandma or favorite<br/>
friends.  Because of traffic, I *prefer* doing out of town stuff during<br/>
the week.<br/>
<br/>
In what way do you think a Sudbury school could be better than<br/>
unschooling?  There must be something about it that you find attractive.<br/>
 The fact that  there are other kids present?  You can get that by<br/>
inviting kids over or by going to park days and you don&#39;t have to pay<br/>
thousands of dollars of tuition.  (Last I heard I think the going rate<br/>
was $7000 per school year.)  (I don&#39;t know what part of the Bay Area you<br/>
are in, but the South Bay has park days, that I know of, on Tuesday,<br/>
Wednesday and Thursday, and probably Monday.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if you reread your original post, you&#39;ll notice you never speculated<br/>
on what your son might want. All your concerns were about what others would<br/>
think and about what you want for him. Obviously he&#39;s too young to give you<br/>
an opinion about what he wants in schools and socialization ;-) but the<br/>
vantage point you&#39;re viewing the situation with is worth examining and<br/>
probably at the root of your concerns.<br/>
<br/>
When someone&#39;s focus shifts from providing what they think their child<br/>
needs/what they think is best for their child to helping their child get<br/>
what they want then lots of problems with unschooling disappear.<br/>
<br/>
It might take you a while for that shift to feel more natural because right<br/>
now he&#39;s at the age where you still have to guess what he wants and make a<br/>
lot of decisions for him. So you&#39;re going to view the future through those<br/>
glasses. Some parents never remove those glasses. But if you can -- and<br/>
people here can help -- then the problems -- and the solutions that look<br/>
good -- won&#39;t look the same.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because he&#39;ll be older and he&#39;ll tell you :-)<br/>
<br/>
School won&#39;t escape his notice. His friends will go. He&#39;ll hear things about<br/>
school. You can talk to him about your experiences in school. You can tell<br/>
him what the days are like when he&#39;s watching Arthur or Magic Schoolbus and<br/>
school looks like loads of time with friends and a few minutes of being told<br/>
what to do. He&#39;ll see his life and the lives of homeschooling and<br/>
unschooling friends.<br/>
<br/>
And, as Kathryn pointed out, there&#39;s the family aspect. Though my daughter<br/>
enjoys playing with friends, she&#39;d still rather be at home doing her own<br/>
thing. School doesn&#39;t have any appeal for her. (She did try public school<br/>
for 2 months so she even knows first hand that home suits her much better.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It¹s just trying to find the right fit for our family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But what&#39;s the right fit for *him*?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote on the Unschooling-101 list:<br/>
=============<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It might be worth examining what &quot;works for us&quot; means to you.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Perhaps one factor that sets unschooling apart is that unschooling is doing<br/>
&gt;&gt; what works for the child. Well, it needs to work for the family too! But it<br/>
&gt;&gt; should work in terms of maximizing joy not in minimizing fears.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; People often say we should do what feels right. Go on gut instinct. But what<br/>
&gt;&gt; feels right is often what minimizes our fears. That isn&#39;t so bad except that<br/>
&gt;&gt; we&#39;re full of fears that seem to make sense but aren&#39;t based in reality or<br/>
&gt;&gt; are only valid when certain factors exist.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; For instance we may fear that they won&#39;t read or learn math. We may fear<br/>
&gt;&gt; that they won&#39;t know enough. We may fear that they will have gaps and doors<br/>
&gt;&gt; will be closed off to them. We may fear that without a solid foundation of<br/>
&gt;&gt; education, they&#39;ll be useful only as Wal-Mart greeters.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Too often we parents end up compromising our children&#39;s happiness so they<br/>
&gt;&gt; can ease our fears. If we fear they won&#39;t read we might make them read for<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;just&quot; 10 minutes a day. It doesn&#39;t seem like much to ask of the child<br/>
&gt;&gt; because the fear seems so huge.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; But since the fear is valid only in school, the potential consequences out<br/>
&gt;&gt; of school -- that the child will come to dislike reading or they will feel<br/>
&gt;&gt; bad about themselves because they can&#39;t do what &quot;everyone&quot; can -- become<br/>
&gt;&gt; significant and something to be avoided.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; If someone seems unconcerned about what we fear, it seems more reasonable<br/>
&gt;&gt; that they&#39;re just clueless or living in la-la land, than that our fears<br/>
&gt;&gt; might not be real. They sure feel real! Unschooling means holding our fears<br/>
&gt;&gt; up to examination. It means being uncomfortable while we work through our<br/>
&gt;&gt; fears. It means looking at how other people deal with those fears.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Because the rewards for children of growing up in freedom and joy are well<br/>
&gt;&gt; worth it :-)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=============<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But<br/>
&gt; it¹s taking a while for me to really BELIEVE in it all, that it can work<br/>
&gt; and he will flourish and learn and grow if allowed to do so on his own<br/>
&gt; schedule.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is totally and completely normal! :-) It doesn&#39;t make sense that kids<br/>
can learn math by living if you haven&#39;t ever seen a child do it. You can&#39;t<br/>
just wipe away 20+ years of seeing and hearing that math is hard and the<br/>
only way to do it is by working through all the problems in the textbook.<br/>
<br/>
We all love our kids as much as you do yours. The only real difference is<br/>
that we&#39;ve *seen* unschooling work so we know those fears -- that we&#39;ve all<br/>
had too! -- are groundless.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it all seems like we&#39;re Wiley Coyote out suspended in air. You can<br/>
see there&#39;s a bottomless pit under us and the only reason we aren&#39;t<br/>
plummetting downward is that we haven&#39;t noticed we&#39;re out in midair yet. As<br/>
soon as we notice, we&#39;ll drop.<br/>
<br/>
But from our perspective, we&#39;ve realized the pit is an illusion. We&#39;re not<br/>
falling because we&#39;re on solid ground. It&#39;s like that last scene in the 3rd<br/>
Indiana Jones movie (Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail?).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have to work on my own deschooling I think.  I¹m a very schooly<br/>
&gt; person.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Been there. Still a schooly person at heart but I know it&#39;s all a<br/>
comforting illusion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Half of<br/>
&gt; me is pulling to put him in a program a few mornings a week for the<br/>
&gt; experience (of being in a group, working with others, being exposed to<br/>
&gt; people and things we don¹t have at home or know about or whatever<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is it he could get there that he can&#39;t get anywhere else? What would he<br/>
be giving up in order to get that? What would he be getting in addition that<br/>
you&#39;d rather he didn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
Every experience he has, he&#39;ll be exposed to different ideas. In order to<br/>
do, say, a unit study on dinosaurs or do organized activities with other<br/>
kids he&#39;s going to have to learn all the lessons of how to behave in school.<br/>
(It&#39;s part of what kindergarten is for.) He&#39;s going to have to face mean<br/>
kids without being able to escape or you there to help him. (And that&#39;s<br/>
unique to school. As adults we know we can always leave, even leave a job,<br/>
if we don&#39;t like the environment.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hopefully by the time he¹s school age I can move to the backwoods where<br/>
&gt; the PS are terrible and like an hour away and the choice will be made<br/>
&gt; for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, as long as you&#39;re hoping, why not hope for an understanding of<br/>
unschooling so school won&#39;t hold any power over you any more :-)<br/>
<br/>
(Even better is to do lots of reading here and on the message boards of<br/>
Unschooling.com and at Sandra&#39;s site so that you can acquire that<br/>
understanding and you won&#39;t have to rely on fate handing it to you! ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113347938">You are right about the minimum number of hours to be spent &quot;in school&quot; even if it&#39;s off campus.  I think the thing is that many of the kids come from public school, so everything about these schools seems freeing to them.  Coming from unschooling it seems limited though.  <br/>
<br/>
In my case my daughter really wanted to go because her best homeschooling friend started to go there.  Her friend went because she is highly social, apparently needing to be with other kids daily and all day.  Her mom, who is a good friend of mine, always said it would be really hard to provide all the social time as a homeschooler.  She also had two little ones to deal with and thought that limited the park day times and outings.  In our family we like a lot of home time, alone time, so it never seemed a problem to us.  So, I guess it depends on your perspective.  Also, the girl mentioned above was so relieved to finally be going to school.  When her parents suggested this alternative to homeschooling she said, &quot;Thank you so much, now I can finally be like all the other kids&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the tuition is pretty outrageous too, especially considering no classes are involved.  However, even at those prices these schools always struggle.  Even after many years of going strong, just losing a significant number (like 5) of kids can put them in jeopardy.  Also, these schools really attract younger kids and when they get to a certain age (usually around 10 or so) parents there start to expect more and often put them in regular school so they can finally &quot;buckle down and do some work&quot;.  Hey, another thing I noticed that was interesting.  My daughter is a major reader and writer, but when she was in school she didn&#39;t do nearly as much of that as when she was home.  I think it actually limited the amount of time she spent learning about interesting things.<br/>
<br/>
In the south bay there are park days on Mondays, in Sunnyvale.  I would imagine in Michelle&#39;s area there are many possibilities too.<br/>

I know that the Santa Clara (CA) Sudbury school has flexible drop off<br/>
and pick up times, but isn&#39;t there a core number of hours that the<br/>
student has to be at the school, or nearby, per week?  (I know they are<br/>
allowed to leave the campus, but how far can they get?)  Doesn&#39;t that<br/>
limit what they could be learning/doing in that time?  A local<br/>
unschooling family could be going anywhere, e.g. enjoying an off-season<br/>
day at the beach or a trip to the Aquarium, visiting grandma or favorite<br/>
friends.  Because of traffic, I *prefer* doing out of town stuff during<br/>
the week.<br/>
<br/>
In what way do you think a Sudbury school could be better than<br/>
unschooling?  There must be something about it that you find attractive.<br/>
 The fact that  there are other kids present?  You can get that by<br/>
inviting kids over or by going to park days and you don&#39;t have to pay<br/>
thousands of dollars of tuition.  (Last I heard I think the going rate<br/>
was $7000 per school year.)  (I don&#39;t know what part of the Bay Area you<br/>
are in, but the South Bay has park days, that I know of, on Tuesday,<br/>
Wednesday and Thursday, and probably Monday.)<br/>

Good point about the minimum hours.  If he&#39;s enjoying being home (working on a project - or not) it would be a shame to get into power struggles about *having* to go to school to fufill a minimum hours requirement.<br/>
 <br/>
I find it attractive because I work during the day.  Right now, Rory is home with his dad, but I don&#39;t expect that to last through school age.  I&#39;m in a position where I may not have to work by the time Rory is school age, but I&#39;m not sure.  If I do have to work, I think Sudbury would be an option that would balance both worlds as best as possible givin our circumstances.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m also more of an introvert and have a hard time meeting people and just plain old getting out of the house, so I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d have a hard time providing a rich social life.  But I&#39;m working on that too.<br/>
 <br/>
The school out here is $2000 for the first year if the kid is under 7, $3800 thereafter, so cost isn&#39;t a huge factor at this point.<br/>

 <br/>
Yes, excellent idea!  We&#39;ll be there!<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;You mentioned your son would be able to go to K next year, but won&#39;t he only be about 2 years old??&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;ll be able to go to preschool next year - and yes, he&#39;ll be 2 years old.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;It does sound like you need some deschooling.  Have you read any John Holt yet? &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I haven&#39;t read any John Holt yet - have been reading here avidly, and have added some great unschooling stuff into my Amazon Wish list - now I&#39;m waiting to get through my last order of books so I can get this batch. <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t touch on this in my original email, but started to in my last post, but part of what&#39;s an issue for me right now is that I work outside the home right now.  Rory is with his dad all day, which is a good arrangmeent, but, well, to put it bluntly, Dan is kinda lazy.  They don&#39;t get out much, they don&#39;t do much.  Right now I&#39;m not too concerned about it, but if I have to continue working (I&#39;m not sure yet if I will) I really don&#39;t want Rory in that environment for years and years.  Dan takes him about 3 days a week to Dan&#39;s sister&#39;s house for a few hours, which is great, and to the park maybe one other day, but when they&#39;re home Dan just vegges in front of the TV.<br/>
 <br/>
So preschool is being considered for next year if I&#39;m still working and Rory is home with Dan.  I think it would be good for Rory to get out of the house and go somewhere a few days a week - see, hear, touch, taste new things he may not get at home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016820931">I didn&#39;t speculate what my son might want because, like you said, we&#39;re still in the stage of guessing what he wants - most are educated guesses, but guesses nonetheless.  I see what you&#39;re saying about having to evenutally make that shift from doing what you think is best to doing what *they* tell you they want.  It&#39;s hard to see that reality at this point because I&#39;m not living it and never have, but I know it will come and am watching for it.<br/>
 <br/>
If I went with my gut, I wouldn&#39;t be here, I would plop him in public school and let nature take it&#39;s course there.  So I&#39;m trying.  My gut is terrified - but I know it&#39;s just fear of the unknown, fear of doing something different, fear of failure.  PS seems so easy - if something goes wrong - blame it on the schools, the education system, the teacher, the budget cuts - whatever.  But I do want better for him - that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.<br/>
 <br/>
I talked a lot more about the whys regarding preschool in a message I just sent out - so I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m ignoring that question, just not repeating myself endlessly again in this message.  <br/>
 <br/>
As for what he would be giving up - well, at this point a few hours a week sitting around the house with his dad doing nothing.  And while I totally see the value in doing nothing, they get plenty of down time together, so I really think preschool might be nice for him.  He&#39;s a very social kid and would enjoy a few extra hours a week with other people.  He gets bored of me and Dan.  He would also be getting the schooly aspect of preschool (although I honestly don&#39;t know how much they can do with 2 or 3 year olds) which I don&#39;t like.  It&#39;s really hard to weigh what&#39;s more important - I think it is important that he get out and see new things and have fun with other kids (and preschool would be the path of least resistance for Dan - who is the one having to do it all, so I do have to take that into account) but I also want to avoid the &quot;Sit down in a ciricle, we&#39;re going to sing now&quot; when he&#39;s totally engrossed in blocks and HAS to go sit for basically no reason but &quot;because teacher<br/>
 said so.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I am hoping for a better understanding of unschooling - the living in the backwoods comment was more tongue-in-cheek.  Although we will be moving (hopefully) to a nice little mini-farm farther away from the city here, one of my goals is to still stay accessable to the Bay Area - there&#39;s so much culture and so much to do here, it would be a shame to never let Rory really experience it.<br/>

I don&#39;t need to know all your family&#39;s details, but shouldn&#39;t doing things with the child be part of the job description for any parent?<br/>
<br/>
I signed my first child up for activities at the YMCA at a very young age.  Dh and I took turns taking her to a toddler gymnastics and to swimming lessons.  I also signed up for parent/toddler classes through the local community college, though these were in actuality mother/child, not father/child.<br/>
<br/>
The major benefit to these classes for me was getting out of the house and meeting other parents.  One of those parents is still a very good friend.  My child benefited by having a happier mother and having the opportunity to play with other children.  I do think that is more of an issue when there is only one child - no built in playmates at home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting that your son needs to be in classes, but that there are innumerable places to go with kids where he can interact with other kids and where other parents will be too.  Parks, children&#39;s museums, even McDonalds playland.  Check out your city&#39;s parks and rec department or local orgs like YMCA.<br/>
<br/>
By the time my second child came along, we had more friends with kids and I had become involved with La Leche League, then a local homeschool group.  At that point, *socialization* was no longer an issue :-)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is what I&#39;m looking for.  Why do you think unschooling is better?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Again, I only know what I have read about the Sudbury schools. IF the school<br/>
would be the same as unschooling at it&#39;s best. The children chose what to do<br/>
and when, it still to me wouldn&#39;t be the same as being home. A school still<br/>
has only so many resources available there. The children for the most part<br/>
stay there and there is a time limit and schedule as to being there.<br/>
<br/>
At home, if we hit a snag with what to do, we can leave. If something<br/>
interests us that isn&#39;t at home, we can leave. If it&#39;s midnight and we want<br/>
to do have fun with something, we can. So there&#39;s nothing to make us stay<br/>
here, nothing to keep us away and no time limit when to do it all.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, and this is a big one. Here, we have family. We have brothers and<br/>
sisters and friends here or coming as much as we want. We enjoy each other a<br/>
lot. When the children have the need to go elsewhere or be with other kids,<br/>
we do. When they don&#39;t, there is no one to tell us they have to.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that all children at a young age &quot;need&quot; to have<br/>
socialization as far as being around other kids. Sometimes it&#39;s confusing,<br/>
sometimes it&#39;s frustrating and sometimes it&#39;s great. If it&#39;s not forced,<br/>
than I don&#39;t have to worry about the confusing, frustrating part. I get just<br/>
the great part. Because when it&#39;s not wanted or needed or enjoyed, we don&#39;t<br/>
have to do it. And I can tailor that to each child&#39;s needs. And so far, my<br/>
children don&#39;t need or even want that every day. There may come a time when<br/>
they do. Tara does, but the younger 3 don&#39;t. So I wouldn&#39;t send them to be<br/>
with other kids 5 days a week when that&#39;s not what they want. At the same<br/>
time, they aren&#39;t in the house every single day either. Being out and about<br/>
IS socializing without being stuck in a room with the same kids every day.<br/>
<br/>
I guess plain and simple, I like the come and go as we please, and I like<br/>
the idea of each day being different depending on who needs or wants what.<br/>
School just can&#39;t do that. Not even a Sudbury.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302379538">But it would be harder to go somewhere else, because he’d have to THINK<br/>
of somewhere else to go.  Preschool is easy – he goes to the same place,<br/>
drops Rory off and then even gets a few hours to himself.  I could plan<br/>
it all out for them (Monday = library, Wednesday = park etc.) but that<br/>
would be too controlling and not well received.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree that doing things with the child is part of the job description<br/>
for any parent, but I can’t fight what is.  And the fact is that Dan<br/>
isn’t terribly adventurous, doesn’t have the knowledge/drive/ability to<br/>
research and seek out new things to do and prefers going to his sister’s<br/>
house and the local park and that’s it.  On the weekend I can<br/>
orchestrate some place for us to go that’s new and different, but I<br/>
don’t have control over the weekdays.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me back to my original quandary.  Since this is the way it<br/>
is (and I’m hoping it will improve over time, but I’m not betting on it)<br/>
I’m wondering if preschool would be a nice diversion for Rory.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Why can&#39;t his dad get out of the house with him more often?  It<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be any harder to go somewhere else than to go to preschool.  I<br/>
don&#39;t need to know all your family&#39;s details, but shouldn&#39;t doing things<br/>
with the child be part of the job description for any parent?&gt;&gt;</div>

I’m wondering if preschool would be a nice diversion for Rory.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If your primary goal is diversion for your son, a once-a-week regularly<br/>
scheduled activity would probably be enough, especially if his dad does take<br/>
him to the park and to his aunt&#39;s.  I find that my kids really benefit from<br/>
having days where we don&#39;t have to go anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Not that preschool is necessarily negative.  I did a co-op preschool for<br/>
about 1/2 a year and was happy with it (although at the time I didn&#39;t know<br/>
about unschooling and wasn&#39;t yet planning to even homeschool).<br/>
<br/>
Except for opening and closing activates, the children were allowed to do<br/>
whatever they wanted while there.  There were different areas (art, picture<br/>
books, large motor, dress up, etc.) and the teacher stressed that a child<br/>
should be able to spend their time as they wished, even if they chose to do<br/>
the same thing week after week.  Two parents were required to stay as<br/>
helpers each time, but parents were always allowed to stay even when it<br/>
wasn&#39;t their turn.  My dd always wanted me to stay.<br/>
<br/>
However, preschool is still &quot;school&quot;, as compared to other activities that a<br/>
child could do.  If you are attracted to unschooling, it might be easier in<br/>
the long run to stay out of school during the years when children aren&#39;t<br/>
required to be there.<br/>
<br/>
I can only imagine that the SF area has dozens of places that offer<br/>
regularly scheduled activities especially for preschool age children.  For<br/>
instance, our children&#39;s museum always offers special art activities for<br/>
preschoolers on a certain day of the week.  Maybe you could do some research<br/>
then OFFER Dan a list of some that you think he and Rory might enjoy<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
But, I don&#39;t think that a young child necessarily NEEDS to have those sorts<br/>
of activities.  It depends on the child and what else is happening in their<br/>
family&#39;s life.  Accompanying parents out and about on errands, with trips to<br/>
the park and an occasional play date may be enough for him for now.<br/>

I get the impression that you are already set on preschool. Correct me if<br/>
I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thinking about what your husband will do for fun for your son,<br/>
how about what your husband likes to do out instead. What are his interests<br/>
that he can take along the little one and do too? There has to be something.<br/>

I was thinking about this too.  Your son is only 14 months right now, and I&#39;m assuming he is your first?  Perhaps your husband will get more into doing things and going places as your son gets older.  Is your husband interested sports, outdoor activities, household repairs, wood working?  All those things are fascinating to little kids.  My son absolutely loves to follow my husband around and talk about the tools he uses and tries to understand how things work.   Just throwing a ball around at the park can lead to meeting other kids and parents.  I just can&#39;t believe he won&#39;t find any interesting things to do with your son as he gets older.  A three or four year old is vastly different from a 14 month old.  As your son starts talking more and more won&#39;t he want to engage with him more?  It also might be good to meet some homeschoolers in your area so that you can start to build relationships now while your son is little.  I found that it helped me immensely as a SAHM to have a community of like minded moms to get together with every week. <br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts, Kristin<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902885511">I can understand your relief, we had a hard time when my daughter&#39;s friend started going to school because all her other friends were going to traditional school and so incredibly busy in the afternoons.  It&#39;s hard to find time to see other kids unless they happen to live in your neighborhood.  We also kind of lived out in the boonies, so it was a haul to get to friend&#39;s houses.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good questions, Mary. My husband was terrified to take my son out anywhere <br/>
when he was Rory&#39; s age, he felt safest dealing with him at home, or in a few <br/>
very familiar situations. Ken is a quiet person, and had a bit of a hard time <br/>
adjusting to having a child, so when he needed to care for Tommy, he did so at <br/>
home because that was what he( husband) could cope with. As son gets older, <br/>
husband now branches out and tries new stuff with him , going places and doing <br/>
things.It worked well for ds, and they formed a good relationship that way. <br/>
Is it possible that may be a partial factor for your partner! I can&#39;t <br/>
remember that name of the person who wrote the original post asking about preschool <br/>
etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479589480">I think diversion was a bad choice of wording on my part, (sounds like I<br/>
want to just keep him occupied with something, anything), but I think<br/>
you understand what I was trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
Offering a list is a good idea.  Approaching it as, &quot;Hey, if you guys<br/>
get bored and want to get out of the house, here&#39;s some cool stuff you<br/>
might enjoy,&quot; is a lot better than, &quot;Here are the activities you need to<br/>
expose our son to,&quot; which would undermine his parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I am attracted to unschooling, and I do agree that keeping him out<br/>
school while he doesn&#39;t have to be in it would be the best thing if we<br/>
ultimately decide to go that route.  Once we&#39;re in that school routine,<br/>
I imagine it&#39;s a much harder transition for everyone to switch back.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what&#39;s brought this all up is that Rory seems bored lately and<br/>
he&#39;s much happier when he&#39;s out and about.  Preschool was the first<br/>
thing that came to mind for the future.<br/>

insights here that I wasn&#39;t able to come to on my own.<br/>
<br/>
Dan doesn&#39;t have too many interests.  I think when Rory is older they<br/>
will enjoy sports together.  He&#39;s a good cook and seems to enjoy<br/>
cooking.  That&#39;s about it really.  Dan is kind of in limbo - long story<br/>
short, he never really had to opportunity to discover his own interest<br/>
and passions and has just started to &quot;do&quot; things other than watch TV and<br/>
play video games.  He was kind of in the deschooling thing for the last<br/>
2 years or so it seems - sitting around, vegging out and seemingly doing<br/>
nothing.  But lately he&#39;s starting to blossom a little bit - I&#39;m seeing<br/>
sparks of interest in him that I never saw before, and I&#39;m hoping he&#39;ll<br/>
act on them.  Hopefully he and Rory can discover things together.<br/>
