 i dont know how big the chain is, but if you have a Hollywood Video nearby, <br/>
 listen to this.  home educators can get a VIT &quot;very important teacher&quot; card <br/>
 for free, which then allows us to borrow any video that we will use for <br/>
 educational purposes!  FREE!  no charge, nothing, nada.  pretty great <br/>
 service, eh?  they have travel videos, documentaries, and of course all the  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you have to show some kind of ID to get this card?  I was thinking<br/>
about making one up on my computer and maybe laminating it.  Do <br/>
teacher ID cards have pics on them? Thanks<br/>
