<div id="ygrps-yiv-728680735">Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline by Becky A. Bailey and Rebecca<br/>
Anne Bailey.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if it was here or another list that I read a<br/>
recommendation for this book, but wherever, I really like it. I think<br/>
it has a terrible title and cover photo but if you get past those it<br/>
has some great ideas. What makes it different from so many parenting<br/>
books is that it focuses on the parent - how do you act, how do you do<br/>
with self-discipline, etc. - how you can change so you can have a<br/>
better relationship with your kids. <br/>
