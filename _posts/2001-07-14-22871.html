&lt;&lt; Hey, I have a question about homeschooling. My mom doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
 college degree, but we really want for me to be homeschooled, and <br/>
 since I&#39;ll be in 9th grade, the TN law states that she must have a <br/>
 BA/BS degree. So, if I do it the church-related way and do it through <br/>
 an academy, do I have to attend the academy/church? Because if I do <br/>
 then I can&#39;t do it. For this one academy, Family Christian Academy, <br/>
 it says that if we &quot;join&quot; them that she doesn&#39;t have to have a <br/>
 degree, so that&#39;s why we thought that was the only way. The only <br/>
 problems with homeschooling we&#39;ve run into so far are expenses and <br/>
 her not having a BA/BS degree. If you could help it would mean so <br/>
 much. Thank you, good-bye!<br/>

allows unschooling. Maybe yours does too or you could work around it. I do <br/>
not have my college degree either and I unschool my dd. I did attend 3 years <br/>
but even if I hadn&#39;t I would still feel very comfortable w/ my choices. <br/>
