&lt;&lt; &gt;My kids call me Mom mostly, but Sandra in reference sometimes, or on the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I realized one of the reasons they say &quot;Sandra&quot; about phone calls sometimes.  <br/>
They&#39;ll say &quot;It&#39;s for Sandra,&quot; or &quot;...for Mrs. Dodd&quot; or &quot;...for AElflaed&quot; so <br/>
I have a clue whether it&#39;s about the SCA, or maybe homeschooling or sales <br/>
(those both often come under &quot;Mrs. Dodd&quot;) or not.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmothers (both Texans) were Granny and Mamaw.<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; grandmothers are Granny (the former Texan) and Grandma (the <br/>
Michigan/Canadian one).<br/>
<br/>
Chicago cousins shortening names is fascinating.  I&#39;m more used to short <br/>
names being made long.  My mom&#39;s brother Joe Paul has a really musically long <br/>
name when his relatives say it.  And my own Texas name, Sandra Lynn, had five <br/>
syllables.  Amazing.   It&#39;s the land of the DEEip-thowung [&quot;dipthong,&quot; for <br/>

never intended to be Mama, but I like it.  Beth is Beffy, Beffy Boo, and <br/>
Fluff.  When Julian was tiny he called her Dada.  (This was also his word for <br/>
lobster.)<br/>
<br/>
He calls his father by his first name, because when he was little he went <br/>
with his Dad often to the day care center where Perry worked. All the other <br/>
kids called him Perry, and so did Julian. He still does.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Julian is only sometimes Julian...he is Puff, Juli-Puff (Pokemon <br/>

Aislinn, couldn&#39;t pronounce Elysia (Ell-is-e-a), and didn&#39;t really like <br/>

maybe I shouldn&#39;t tell anyone until they&#39;ve seen my beautiful baby, but <br/>
I end up telling everyone because, ya know what, I LOVE these names and <br/>
I really don&#39;t care what anyone else thinks.  They all come around in <br/>
the end and love them just as much as I do because they love my girls. <br/>
 Gee, kind like how I feel about unschooling now!  I just have to wait <br/>
for them to come around to that.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; By the way, dh suggested for third dd the name Debris - as a joke of<br/>
&gt; course...but it really does sound pretty, feminine and very French...if<br/>
&gt; only it didn&#39;t have that unfortunate definition!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had a French professor say once that the prettiest phrase in English was<br/>
&gt; &quot;cellar door&quot; (and with his French accent, it really was extra pretty).<br/>

Helena (my London-living friend) has a dad who grew up in Paris.  American <br/>
dad, left Parisian mom with five kids, interesting stories, beautiful accent.<br/>
<br/>
One day he was over here telling me of his great frustration when the sewer <br/>
pipe broke UNDER concrete at the house he was living in that was Helena&#39;s <br/>
family&#39;s house.  They were out of town.  He had had to deal with the mess and make <br/>
all the decisions, and it stank and was expensive and he was QUITE put out.    <br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t really do anything but sympathize, and so as he was telling me the <br/>
story, with hand gestures and obvious agitation, I just let his beautiful <br/>
accent pass over and through me like a brain massage.  I quit picturing sewage <br/>
and jackhammers and just listened to the music of the story.<br/>
<br/>
On Dress to Kill, Eddie Izzard does a bit about what if Luke and Darth Vader <br/>
had not had those voices.  What if it hadn&#39;t been James Earl Jones&#39; voice.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know what specific English accent he&#39;s doing (some on this list probably <br/>
would).  Not a posh accent at all, though.  Talks about how the movie just <br/>
would not have worked at all.  And that&#39;s a touchy subject, as the original <br/>
actor was, I think, English, and didn&#39;t know his voice was being dubbed over until <br/>
the movie was released.<br/>
