&lt;&lt;   This is not abandament because we are in agreement that we cannot live <br/>
together and I also have on my side that he has created an environment that <br/>
children and I cannot live in without emotional/mental probs as a result. <br/>
Thoughts please??????? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whether it is truly abandonment or not isn&#39;t the issue, it&#39;s how the courts <br/>
will view things now.<br/>
You CAN make him move out. But you need a good lawyer.<br/>
He is emotionally abusive, that is grounds for removing him from the house <br/>
and it will proabably be a bit easier on the kids if you don&#39;t have to move.<br/>
One thing you absolutely can not do right now is leave for even a night.<br/>
If you go ANYWHERE, take the kids with you. Any absence by a mother without <br/>
the children quickly gets labeled abandonment and can hurt custody <br/>
proceedings for you.<br/>
Even if he agrees totally, to give you a night or two off, do not go without <br/>
the children.<br/>
Please.<br/>
He obviously has major control issues from what you&#39;ve said, I don&#39;t think it <br/>
would be hard to get a ruling in your favor to remove him from the home.<br/>
It&#39;s far easier for one person to start over, than for two.<br/>
Ideally, you all need to get into counseling. He could learn how to deal with <br/>
these issues and from where they are stemming.<br/>
But if he won&#39;t get help then I would personally make him leave. I would have <br/>
a fit if my dh tried to &quot;punish&quot; me...no one deserves to live in a horrible <br/>
environment like that.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

Right.  Moms who get angry and leave without taking kids can lose custody <br/>
bigtime.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;Right.  Moms who get angry and leave without taking kids can lose custody <br/>
  bigtime.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  And sometimes moms who do make arrangements because they are thinking of the kids lose custody too. DO NOT leae those kids for one second.<br/>
