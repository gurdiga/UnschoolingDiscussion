<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041146513">Ok.  I need some help.  My just turned 6 yo daughter is a wonderful<br/>
little girl.  Bright, aware, kind, all the wonderful adjectives that you<br/>
can think of.  However, she has a whiny and explosive side that can<br/>
erupt in a millisecond.  It isn&#39;t always predictable and it usually<br/>
turns physically violent (from her!) and is almost always only in front<br/>
of other people.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
We go to Brownies (where I am a co-leader).  She claims to really really<br/>
love Brownies and she wants to be part of the troop (she has the option<br/>
of quiting or not attending at any point).  We are working on an<br/>
interesting project (of which she is enjoying, she helps me decide what<br/>
it is going to be, and she is doing a fine job of it), then all of a<br/>
sudden she gets really mad and starts throwing things.  When I pick her<br/>
up (to walk her to the hall or outside to talk), she hits and kicks and<br/>
screams and tries to stab me with whatever object she happens to be<br/>
holding.  Once we get outside alone, she is often calm, but if someone<br/>
walks by she erupts again.<br/>
<br/>
Another example:<br/>
In a pool, she is playing with another child close in age to her.  The<br/>
other child has a toy that they are playing happily with, my daughter<br/>
tries to grab it and the other child says, &quot;You can have it in a minute<br/>
when I am done, but I&#39;d like to finish this thing first.&quot;  My daughter<br/>
erupts, causing such a screaming outburst that I have to physically<br/>
restrain her until we get into a room alone so that that she doesn&#39;t<br/>
hurt herself, the other child, the toy, or me.  Once she is in a room in<br/>
the house (or in the car if we are out and about- different, but similar<br/>
situation), she usually gets calm unless she hears other people and<br/>
knows that they can hear her (then she starts beating up everything in<br/>
sight).<br/>
<br/>
Another example:<br/>
We, as a family, go to another person&#39;s house.  She is forewarned that<br/>
we&#39;ll be there for 1 hour and she brings books, etc. to occupy her if<br/>
she is not enjoying being there.  We walk in the door, she is polite and<br/>
fine.  As soon as we start a conversation with the people in the house,<br/>
my daughter starts whining and screaming that she is not having any fun<br/>
and this is boring.  This quickly turns into her thrashing on the floor,<br/>
not hearing any words that come out of our mouths.  She is sometimes<br/>
consolable only if left completely alone with a book to read (but no one<br/>
dare talk to her).  The house owners usually wonder what in the world<br/>
they did wrong and she glared at them when we leave.  [This has happened<br/>
twice in the last couple of week, but we seldom go over to others<br/>
houses, thank goodness!  I&#39;d like to more, but I am afraid to and she is<br/>
too young to be left alone.  I am thinking of &quot;forcing&quot;, yes FORCING on<br/>
this one (help me if I am wrong) her to write (with my help) an apology<br/>
for her behavior to these other people who think she is a monster.  She<br/>
does feel sorry for her actions now, or she at least claims to, but I<br/>
know that she&#39;d do it again in a second.]<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve role played these situations beforehand (with her &quot;acting&quot; just<br/>
fine).  We&#39;ve role reversed, too.  We&#39;ve talked and talked to no<br/>
effect.  I&#39;ve read all the books (&quot;Spirited Child&quot;, &quot;Explosive Child&quot;,<br/>
&quot;How to talk...&quot;) and tried the examples, but none the children in these<br/>
books are anything like my own.  I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end.  When talking<br/>
after a situation, she really believes that she did nothing wrong.  She<br/>
knows that hitting, etc. is wrong (we don&#39;t hit her!), but feels<br/>
justified that she had a right to do what she did because she was mad<br/>
and the rest of the world was being mean to her.<br/>
<br/>
Help!  My parents are here visiting right now (been here 4 days and will<br/>
be here 4 more) and they are acting (but not outright saying,<br/>
thankfully) that we are parenting her SO bad and that if only we&#39;d put<br/>
her in public schools that she&#39;d be shamed into not doing this<br/>
nonsense.  I know this isn&#39;t true, and I can make really good arguments<br/>
for the educational aspect of unschooling, but I can&#39;t come up with an<br/>
argument for the emotional/getting along with others aspect of<br/>
unschooling, especially when it appears as if we are failing in this<br/>
aspect.  <br/>
<br/>
There are natural consequences for these actions:  People start not<br/>
liking you (including me at times!).  Have I given her too much<br/>
freedom?  Am I turning her into a monster?  To be completely honest, I<br/>
often feel like she deserves a good spanking (I&#39;ve told her that is what<br/>
other parents often do).  I walk away when I feel that way (she usually<br/>
follows!) and I know that is wrong.  My parents claim (again, with no<br/>
real words) that children are only violent like this if their parents<br/>
are violent to them!  I&#39;ve learned that this is not true.  Help!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any and all advice!<br/>

It won&#39;t help your relationship with her at all, and they wouldn&#39;t be sincere <br/>

She&#39;s five.  Maybe she just needs to hang around with you and NOT other <br/>

<br/>
Can she do the group stuff from your lap?<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s not handling it, she&#39;s probably just not old enough to handle it.  <br/>
She gets older every day, every moment, and that getting older will probably <br/>
be easier without a mass of frustration and regret and criticism.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536291213">Hi Lisa,<br/>
Does your daughter listen at home when you tell her to do things or does she argue, refuse, or have a tantrum? Does she take responsibility for her actions or blame others? Does she show empathy and/or sympathy for others? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research on my own son&#39;s behavior &quot;problems&quot; and have run across a lot of different things that this sounds like!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641099253">She almost always listens when we&#39;re at home (unless there are other<br/>
people here).  She&#39;s quite helpful and nice when it is just us (usually,<br/>
within her &quot;normal&quot; age appropriate range).  When she&#39;s not in &quot;tantrum<br/>
mode&quot; she takes responsibility. Again, if other people are around, she<br/>
acts differently.  Occasionally she blames her little sister for<br/>
&quot;e-noying&quot; her.<br/>
<br/>
As for sympathy or empathy, she occasionally shows concern for others<br/>
but has never really shown real sympathy.  She has also never been<br/>
embarassed or ashamed, as far as I can tell.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.  I&#39;d be interested in any ideas that you&#39;ve come<br/>
across.  BTW, she has shown this tantruming screaming side of her<br/>
personality since she was an infant.  It is less now than when she was a<br/>
baby, but it is affecting her relationship with others now (and MY<br/>
relationships with others).  Always around others and she has a strong<br/>
need to be in physical contact with me &/or DH.  <br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are right, of course.  There is just this part of me that wants the<br/>
world to think that I am a good MOM.  I want relationships with these<br/>
people and my daughter is making it so I can&#39;t.  I&#39;ve been right there<br/>
ever time something like this has happened and my daughter really is the<br/>
one at fault and these people really do deserve apologies.  I will<br/>
probably write one from only me (and DH), though, since our daughter<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She is 6 (just turned) and again, you are right.  However, it just isn&#39;t<br/>
always possible.  My parents are here right now and I can&#39;t make them go<br/>
away for 4 more days.  They visit about 3x a year and if I want us to<br/>
have a relationship with them (and I do), then we have to put up with<br/>
them being here.  We can avoid a lot of other outside interactions and<br/>
we usually do, but on the rare occasion that I want us to go somewhere,<br/>
I&#39;d like to do it.  Thank you for the advice.  It is making me think<br/>
that we need to step back a bit and do less for a while just like we<br/>
couldn&#39;t do anything when she was a baby.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can she do the group stuff from your lap?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a good idea.  I&#39;ve taken on the commitment and responsibility of<br/>
being a co-leader, though (so that I am involved, etc.).  I am going to<br/>
talk to my co-leader and ask her to help find more people to help with<br/>
our troop for a while so that I can be more involved directly with my<br/>
daughter only. (This last time I took my sister to be Zoe&#39;s helper and<br/>
it didn&#39;t make anything better.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If she&#39;s not handling it, she&#39;s probably just not old enough to handle it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right.  I agree.  However...  :)  How does a person learn that they<br/>
SHOULD be regretful and feel bad when they truly have done something<br/>
wrong?  Some behaviors really aren&#39;t acceptable and I, as a good mother,<br/>
just can&#39;t allow her to be cruel and physically harming.  I&#39;m asking<br/>
this in all seriousness:  Why would it be bad for her to be regretful<br/>
and ashamed of her actions when her actions are wrong?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I just want to say that I think your daughter&#39;s behavior is just &quot;her&quot;<br/>
and doesn&#39;t come from your parenting.  I hope you can believe that.  I<br/>
think that if you can feel like you don&#39;t have to &quot;own&quot; her behavior,<br/>
just &quot;deal&quot; with it, that may help you feel calmer and less ashamed when<br/>
this stuff starts.<br/>
<br/>
When I (personally) have a temper outburst, I know it comes from feeling<br/>
really deeply threatened.  So there may be a bit of fear of people or<br/>
groups underlying your daughter&#39;s reactions.  (I&#39;m really guessing here.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids who are really extremely emotional have undiagnosed food<br/>
allergies, like to wheat or dairy or food dyes.<br/>

young children, as a rule, cannot understand sarcasm and sympathy and <br/>
they are naturally selfish. It wouldn&#39;t be bad for her to be <br/>
regretful or ashamed of her actions as long as she arrives at these <br/>
feelings without being made to feel that way. Making an issue a moral <br/>
one is something else they don&#39;t buy into. Making someone feel guilty <br/>
is an all too common way to manipulate others into acting in a way <br/>
that you find acceptable. I&#39;m not advocating you standing by watching <br/>
her physically harm someone or herself. I also agree with ??? who <br/>
said that maybe cutting back on outside activities would be best. <br/>
Another great book, Magical Child explains about an experiment where <br/>
children who had the full attention of at least one adult until age <br/>
seven were less likely to be needy consumers. I believe that is why <br/>
Laurie has never been much of a consumer (books not included). She <br/>
just doesn&#39;t like &quot;stuff.&quot; <br/>
