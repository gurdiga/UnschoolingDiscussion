We have been at a loss since we finished the Order of the Phoenix. We&#39;ve<br/>
started three different books and finished none of them. I asked the boys<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Artemis Fowl. It&#39;s a series. Supposedly there&#39;s a movie coming out next<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Artemis Fowl is a 12 yo wealthy technical super genius master criminal. And<br/>
he&#39;s on the search for the book of the magical folk (elves, dwarves and so<br/>
on) who have been driven underground.<br/>
<br/>
It starts out very slow. The main character isn&#39;t very likeable (at the<br/>
beginning) so it feels like the book is going to be about this arrogant<br/>
unpleasant person you don&#39;t like. But Holly, a elven member of the Special<br/>
Forces police team is introduced who doesn&#39;t like him either and gives him<br/>
back what he deserves and it turns into a lot of fun :-)  The magic folk are<br/>
also more technologically advanced than humans and it turns into a race to<br/>
see who can outwit who.<br/>

Well this isn&#39;t a scavenger hunt but great fun for kids and adults. Even the<br/>
little ones like this. Have you ever heard of or done letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.letterboxing.org/">http://www.letterboxing.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are stamps hidden in parks and you have to follow the directions to<br/>
find them. When you do, you place the stamp you found in a book of yours to<br/>
keep and stamp the book you found with a stamp of your own. I didn&#39;t get<br/>
into making my own stamps, just bought a couple for each of my kids and me.<br/>
Pretty easy and cheap and cute for us. I&#39;m a farmer and the kids are all<br/>
farm animals! Most you don&#39;t need a compass for but those are easy enough to<br/>
get for cheap. Lots of fun and my kids can&#39;t wait until new ones get placed<br/>
in our area. Pass the word around to all your friends. Since we started<br/>
doing that here, letterboxes are appearing every week. Let me know how you<br/>
like it. Hopefully there are some in your area or where you are going.<br/>

  Are you familiar with the GPS systems at all?  There is something <br/>
called &quot;geocaching&quot; where you use your GPS to find locations and <br/>
hidden &#39;treasures&#39; (boxes).   They are located in countries all over <br/>
the world.<br/>
   Check out the website: www.geocaching.com   Look up some local <br/>
sites in your city/state and get an idea for what this about.  <br/>
You&#39;ll be able to look up Boston and Williamsburg as well.   They&#39;ll <br/>
have clues and coded hints that you can print out (for example, once <br/>
you get to the location, the coded clue might tell you to look under <br/>
some old railroad ties).<br/>
   We took a weekend trip to Idaho (from Washington) and I printed <br/>
out a bunch of &#39;caches&#39; (my kids call them &#39;treasure hunts&#39;) that <br/>
were on our way.  We stopped at rest stops and funny locations, <br/>
found the box, signed our names in the notebook, left a little <br/>
trinket, took a trinket (kids love this part) and we were back on <br/>
our way.<br/>
  That was our first time doing it on a trip.  Usually we just do it <br/>
here locally and on day trips to Seattle.  There are so many local <br/>
caches, it is going to take us a while to find them all.  Plus, new <br/>
ones are added (by anyone who takes the initiative) all the time.  <br/>
    It is very simple.  Kids automatically learned about longitude <br/>
and latitude.  Good for tracking, street smarts, adventure and FUN!!<br/>
 <br/>
Does anyone else do this?  Kelli in Stanwood, WA<br/>

&lt;&lt; When I think of a scavenger hunt, I think of something fun, mysterious, <br/>

<br/>
Scavenger hunts are traditionally physical free-for-all gathering <br/>
competitions.  We did one when we were broken down in a teeny town in South Dakota once.  <br/>
Two teams looked for things like a piece of a car, a dead animal, a gum <br/>
wrapper (three days by a freeway exit with one book and some crayons and paper--it <br/>
was bad &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
This Halloween Kirby and Marty were at a Halloween party in a rural area and <br/>
there was a scavenger hunt.  The hostess had made three teams and assigned <br/>
people to them so that each team had someone old enough to drive others around, <br/>
and at least one kid local to that area, and one kid very brave.  Some of the <br/>
things on the list were two rolls of toilet paper, four McDonald&#39;s french fri<br/>
es, a sock (extra points if it&#39;s orange), a carrot, a raw egg (Marty <br/>
trick-or-treated for those--asked the guy if they could please have a carrot and an egg <br/>
instead of candy), and  a rubbing of a tombstone (they had been given paper and <br/>
crayon--one team went to the pet cemetary and got a German Shepherd&#39;s that <br/>
died in the 70&#39;s, and one team found the grave of a woman who had lived to be <br/>
102 or so).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another thing I first encountered in Girl Scouts but we do it in the <br/>
SCA too sometimes, and in the SCA they call the quests.  (They might have in <br/>
scouts too.)<br/>
<br/>
There are stations, with someone at each station having a question or puzzle <br/>
for the questers.   They might have to answer a riddle, or know something <br/>
historical.  I remember in girl scouts we had to set up a campfire with stuff that <br/>
was nearby, and one of the tricks was to put the bucket near enough and say <br/>
&quot;bucket of water or dirt&quot; or whatever.   We had to put lay scout pins and <br/>
patches out in the right order on a sash.   In the SCA, there have been chess <br/>
puzzles (one move to checkmate) and tell a period joke or sing a period song, name <br/>
five kings of France before 1600; stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have 3 small children (6g, 4g and 3b), and I wanted to make up a <br/>
scavenger hunt for some trips that we&#39;re taking to Boston and Williamsburg <br/>
next month. I want to make things fun, so we&#39;re not just wandering around <br/>
looking at boring buildings, know what I mean? I&#39;m not going to be able to <br/>

something like that? The primary purpose should be to have fun not to learn <br/>
13 facts about the 13 colonies like all these teacherly hunts do.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a good situation for competition.  Maybe you could look through <br/>
tour guides and make a list of things you think you will easily come by (and if <br/>
you&#39;re getting tired it could inspire you to keep going.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids that young are not going to care about lots of things.  Maybe you could <br/>
list things like three bells, a church older than 1800, an old boat, a new <br/>
boat, a ferry (if you&#39;re going to see one), a mile marker, a horse...  Then they <br/>
could scan for things they know the names of, by  name rather than riddle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880473789">I like Bingo games for that.  Given the age range, simple<br/>
pictures in the 25 squares would be best.  Kids have fun slowing<br/>
down and really looking at stuff when they are searching for  a<br/>
bingo.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see - Williamsburg and Boston... A lemon, an apple, a baby<br/>
in a simple house outline (a house where a baby was born), a<br/>
cat, a shell, a horseshoe, Texas (from toast to license plates),<br/>
an outhouse, a candle, a boat/ship, a brick building, a log<br/>
building, a stone building, a 12 up/12 down lights window, a<br/>
hand pump, a stile, litter, fungus, a quill pen, a wreath, a<br/>
widow&#39;s walk, a horse, an anachronism (use a pic of a broken<br/>
clock), a churn, a shovel.  You might prefer a different 25 of<br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
Give them all the same sheet, with pics from clip art or your<br/>
own head.  Even after somebody bingo&#39;s it is fun to keep going -<br/>
and maybe a prize for each when he or she gets a bingo.<br/>
Explanations of the actual item and how it fulfills the clue are<br/>
great.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043176504">Have you looked into Geocaching or Letterboxing? with Geocaching, you pretty much need a hand-held GPS system, but you take a treasure with you to leave in the box, as well as take one from the box. With letterboxing, it&#39;s stamps (rubber, not postal).<br/>
 <br/>
You can find out more at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.letterboxing.com">http://www.letterboxing.com</a> and oh shoot I don&#39;t recall the one for Geocaching off-hand. We&#39;re not doing that one just yet since we don&#39;t have a GPS unit, we&#39;re saving though and hoping to start it next spring! <br/>
 <br/>
My Brownie troop is putting together a Letterbox, and I just posted to my homeschool group asking if anyone else wants to letterbox with us. We&#39;ll see...it seems pretty fun although there are only 2 letterboxes currently that are right in our town; but there are quite a few on Cape Cod and elsewhere.<br/>

Looking for some ideas or expertise in scavenger hunts. I&#39;ve been searching <br/>
online, and all the scavenger hunts read more like quizzes than fun <br/>
activities. Like the whole point is to get kids to answer quiz questions by <br/>
having them compete with each other. There is very little mystery or <br/>
creativity in these activities, not a big surprise, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
When I think of a scavenger hunt, I think of something fun, mysterious, <br/>
exciting, with puzzles or brainteasers to solve. Not &quot;how many corners does <br/>
a colonial hat have?&quot; Am I mis-remembering the whole scavenger hunt thing? <br/>
Does competition with other teams have to come into play in order to make <br/>
them fun and exciting?<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 small children (6g, 4g and 3b), and I wanted to make up a <br/>
scavenger hunt for some trips that we&#39;re taking to Boston and Williamsburg <br/>
next month. I want to make things fun, so we&#39;re not just wandering around <br/>
looking at boring buildings, know what I mean? I&#39;m not going to be able to <br/>
hide clues, but I was thinking of making up some rhymed riddles or <br/>
something like that? The primary purpose should be to have fun not to learn <br/>
13 facts about the 13 colonies like all these teacherly hunts do.<br/>
<br/>
Any inspired ideas?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30011104">&lt;&lt;We have been at a loss since we finished the Order of the Phoenix. We&#39;ve<br/>
started three different books and finished none of them. I asked the boys<br/>
what they wanted last night and Jess (also 9) said he wanted  &quot;a book with<br/>
action, thrills and spills&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I like Anne McCaffrey - her Planet Pirates series has lots of action, and<br/>
the first in the series has dinosaurs too.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur Planet - Survivors&quot;, &quot;The Death of Sleep&quot; and<br/>
so on. This lot has more of the harder Sci-fi than the Pern series which is<br/>
more Sci-fantasy.<br/>

Someone mentioned Mindware and ironically they have a scavenger hunt in a<br/>
can :-)<br/>

But, other than the basic premise &quot;Grown-ups hit the streets for anything<br/>
from the soup of the day at the local diner to a mask made of processed<br/>
cheese,&quot; it won&#39;t help with the Boston idea.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sound Scavenger hunts are popular around here. Kids go in groups - with <br/>
a tape recorder. They have a list of sounds they need to collect - a <br/>
toilet flushing is always on the list &lt;G&gt;. I remember - a man singing <br/>
the Star Spangled Banner, a dog barking, a baby crying, a piano <br/>
playing, .... Sometimes they do these in malls.<br/>
<br/>
A bunch of unschooled teens my daughter hangs out with have done photo <br/>
scavenger hunts -- each team gets a disposable camera and a list of <br/>
things to take pictures of - someone wearing tie-dye, two people <br/>
kissing, an unusual animal, a statue, etc.<br/>
