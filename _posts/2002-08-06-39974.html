<div id="ygrps-yiv-945881783">AHA!!<br/>
I found the connection between the two holidays...<br/>
<br/>
KING CAKE - It is believed the King Cake originated in France around <br/>
the 12th century to celebrate the coming of the three wise men <br/>
bearing gifts twelve days after Christmas calling it the Feast of the <br/>
Epiphany, Twelfth Night or King&#39;s Day. In baking these delicious <br/>
treats to honor the three Kings, the cakes were made circular to <br/>
portray the circular route taken by the kings to confuse King Herod, <br/>
who was trying to follow the wise men so he could kill the Christ <br/>
Child. <br/>
In these early days, a bean, a pea or a coin was hidden inside the <br/>
cake and who ever got the hidden item in their piece of cake was <br/>
declared King for a day, or was said to have good luck in the coming <br/>
year. In Louisiana, Twelfth Night (Jan. 6th) signifies the beginning <br/>
of our carnival season and the bean, pea or coin has been replaced by <br/>
a small baby which symbolizes the Christ Child. Today, the person <br/>
getting the baby is expected to host the next King Cake party. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So here we have a connnection between 12th night, Mardi Gras and <br/>
Three Kings holidays. Who would&#39;ve guessed? The things you can learn <br/>
at unschooling.com and google.<br/>
I love finding the connections, the dot-to-dot learning style it <br/>
should be called.<br/>
And here it says the roots are in 12th century France, so now we can <br/>
learn about medieval customs, France, traditional recipes, <br/>
religion......and so it goes. Everything in the whole wide world and <br/>
how it connects. The best thing about being an unschooler is seeing <br/>
how one thing leads to another.... I love it.<br/>
