Shown up by another limey. That&#39;s home-schooling for you, I now know new
stuff about guns.

I walk or cycle everywhere, have spiky red hair and wear combat trousers.
Probably be shot on sight.

I still don&#39;t know what those black handguns with clips are called. All
the baddies carried them in The Matrix (which I was watching last night).

 </span></blockquote>Many handguns/pistols are called by their manumfactor&#39;s name and some by<br/>
their size.  I&#39;ve forgotten for sure, but most likley the pistols used in<br/>
the Matrix are  Glock&#39;s.  They are made entirely from  syntheic resin,<br/>
except for the firing pin.  If you put your firing pin inside a real pen,<br/>
you can travel through airports.<br/>

I guess you can never tell what a hsing mom might know. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796818491">ah. my people. ...er...person. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
do you find that people (public in general) tend to be<br/>
even more shocked that you are a parent...(are you a<br/>
parent? I was just assuming, cuz you&#39;re on the list)<br/>
with your &quot;different&quot; appearance?<br/>
I get alot of flack, shocked, offended feedback cuz I<br/>
am young first of all (23), look even younger (one<br/>
lady thought I was 14!!!!!), always have a different<br/>
color of hair. The least accepted was an accidental<br/>
pink color (I was going for bright red, but ..um...it<br/>
didn&#39;t work) it is currently growing out from its very<br/>
uneven short spikey state and I dress as what my<br/>
family affectionately just calls &quot;wierd&quot; now &lt;g&gt;, and<br/>
I am never seen without my combat boots with always<br/>
changing laces in them (right now it&#39;s Rainbow Brite).<br/>
People always think I&#39;m just a really wierd babysitter<br/>
when I take my kids out. :)<br/>
