<div id="ygrps-yiv-917551182">Sharon, I wondered about homeschooling my children because I knew in high<br/>
school they teach accredited classes to graduate and get into college. <br/>
So I actually looked at the college literature to see if it mattered. <br/>
First of all, the community college does not require a high school<br/>
diploma or ged to get in.  All we need to do is to take whatever classes<br/>
we want, take an exam, talk to a counselor about what major we&#39;re<br/>
interested in.  If we want to be in a specific program, then we need to<br/>
meet certain requirements.  But they show us what these are and how to<br/>
meet them.  Then, the other thing is, when I went for a nursing course<br/>
several years ago, I found that all the college level courses I took in<br/>
high school meant nothing because after five years those credits don&#39;t<br/>
count.  (So much for girls who take a break to bear children.)  Even if I<br/>
don&#39;t do great on their exam, or don&#39;t meet their requirements, they show<br/>
how to get these things.   I looked into film production, and<br/>
engineering, since those are what my two oldest are interested in.  Boy<br/>
was I surprised that they did not even need a diploma to become these<br/>
things.  I looked into the local colleges, and they take homeschooled<br/>
kids, they just want paperwork demonstrating or describing what sort of<br/>
things they&#39;ve learned.  In my area, home schooled kids are required to<br/>
take an exam every three years to prove they are learning.  My oldest<br/>
needs to take it every year to stay in sports.  He wants to get his ged<br/>
as soon as it is legal, and to start at the local community college as<br/>
soon as possible to become an architectural engineer.  He plans to finish<br/>
two years locally, then finish his degree at a school about 30 miles<br/>
away.  (I think of this as locally, but around here everything is so<br/>
close that 10 miles seems &quot;too far to drive&quot; to most people-haha:).  He<br/>
is already saving up for college, and we are looking into scholarship<br/>
opportunities.  <br/>
My oldest sister dropped out of school in the ninth grade and worked<br/>
three jobs to get a place out in the middle of nowhere (rural Oklahoma)<br/>
when she was 21 where she lived with her first husband who was also a<br/>
school drop out but made his living as an organic farmer and mechanic. <br/>
During this time she worked at a health food coop where she learned a lot<br/>
about natural health. They divorced.  She got massages from a customer,<br/>
who taught massage therapy at the community college.  At age 32, she got<br/>
her ged, which involved the dreaded algebra, became a massage therapist<br/>
and met her present husband in the same class.  The two of them and his<br/>
friend opened the first massage therapy clinic in Fort Smith Arkansas<br/>
when she was 33.  They are verrrry successful.  More than I am.  They<br/>
will retire five years from now, when she is 46.  <br/>
I graduated from high school and never got into partying and skipping<br/>
school.  I was on honor roll and had an A- average.  Whoopdedoo.  It<br/>
means nothing after five years.  My point being that you don&#39;t need to<br/>
have some sort of special credits, etc. to go to college and get degrees.<br/>
 You just find out what the school of your choice requires and endeavor<br/>
to meet those requirements.  My thinking is that if you don&#39;t do well on<br/>
their entrance exam, then take local community college courses, or buy<br/>
their books and study them at home, and then take the exam again.  It all<br/>
depends on how much passion and enthusiasm there is for the subject area.<br/>
 Where there&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a way. <br/>
Oh, I should mention correspondence schools.  I know a woman who never<br/>
graduated from high school, but went to work in doctors offices at a<br/>
young age before you needed all the certificates.  At 50 something, she<br/>
began to take a correspondence course to become a nurse while working<br/>
days for the doctor.  She had to miss work occasionally to go to the<br/>
local community college for certain classes, but not too much.  Five<br/>
years and a lot of books later, she took her nursing test and is a<br/>
licensed registered nurse.<br/>
Sorry if this is long, there are others who know more than I do about all<br/>
this.  I think this has been discussed before and may be on the message<br/>
boards.<br/>

<br/>
Now I am feeling pretty confident that these things can be learned without<br/>
going and buying a set of text books every year.  It is just a little<br/>
difficult grasping a new concept after so many years at the old one.<br/>
<br/>
When I went into nursing school all we had to do was take the entrance<br/>
exams.  They were based on 10th grade knowledge and was mostly reading and<br/>
math.  Very easy to pass.  I had already graduated from high school and<br/>
taken college courses in english, math and history but I had been majoring<br/>
in music.  It would not have mattered if I had not gotten the diploma or<br/>
taken any courses as long as I passed that test.  They only needed to see<br/>
that you would be able to get all the reading done ( I am sure you know how<br/>
many tons of reading that was so your speed and comprehension had to be<br/>
up ).  The math you had to know only basic math and be able to learn to do<br/>
drug formula conversions.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it is just full speed ahead and hope to do our best.<br/>
