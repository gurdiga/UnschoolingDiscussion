       This sounds just like my MIL. Extremely controlling with food choices. <br/>
Her famous line is, &quot;Let&#39;s sit down and have some dessert while we discuss <br/>
your weight problem.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       We just returned from her house in New England. At dinner one evening, <br/>
her husband said to dh and my BIL, &quot;Finish up these potatoes and cabbage, so <br/>
your mother won&#39;t get mad.&quot; I couldn&#39;t take it. I responded before either had <br/>
a chance, &quot;You complain about their weight, yet you get upset when they don&#39;t <br/>
eat everything on the table?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       My children (Carly 12, Eric 11) had been with them for ten days prior <br/>
to our arrival. It felt more like a rescue effort. Carly was so proud of my <br/>
response at the dinner table. She&#39;d been told countless times &quot;I only eat <br/>
breakfast (fruit or high fiber, low-fat cereal/coffee) and dinner; why do you <br/>
need lunch?&quot; She also criticized everything that went into their mouths. My <br/>
daughter took to hiding in her room in the basement (food was not the only <br/>
point of criticism; her choice of books, magazines, movies, interests, etc). <br/>
She actually started pulling hair out on the crown of her head (never did <br/>
this before and didn&#39;t realize it until I noticed to bald spot). <br/>
<br/>
       Eric went to his grandfather&#39;s lawnmower shop with him (he got to <br/>
escape). We&#39;ll never send them for an extended trip again. They both would go <br/>
for a few days as long as many activities were planned. As soon as any <br/>
downtime occurs is when the criticism begins.<br/>
<br/>
       When my husband and I arrived, MIL broached the subject of our method <br/>
of homeschooling. I stayed far away. DH got to deal with her. He politely <br/>
told her to stuff it, that our children were doing quite well, and we didn&#39;t <br/>
need her input. Luckily we escaped on many day trips. The trip was not a <br/>
total disaster.<br/>
<br/>
       Enough rambling. <br/>
<br/>
       Ginny (glad to be back home in VA and 9 hours away from MIL)<br/>
<br/>
PS, I&#39;m also glad to be a 47 year old mother with 12 and 11y/o; it makes me <br/>
feel younger since I have such young children. My mother was still very <br/>
active in her 70s, so I&#39;m not worried about being an older grandmother. I&#39;ll <br/>
just keep taking my Glucosamine and sitting in the hot tub.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751021958">Oh, Ginny this is way familiar, my mother is the same way.  Such a &#39;good&#39; person, but just doesn&#39;t even see what she does to us, her children, or others.  To control is to love, I think that should be their signature lines!<br/>
