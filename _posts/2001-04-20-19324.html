<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192510463"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">My two cents is that it can be done. When I was single and decided to 
<br>homeschool my daughter I made a list of all the things I could do to earn 
<br>money and that I could have her with me (she was very young at the time). All 
<br>of them entailed being my own boss and going out and finding people to use my 
<br>services. I was committed to doing whatever it took to have her with me and 
<br>be able to homeschool. What came out of that list and the subsequent things I 
<br>did was I opened my own landscape company. I didnt have any money to start it 
<br>but I just did it. I think it takes some thinking &quot;outside the box&quot;, but I 
<br>know that anyone. . . absolutely anyone can do it if they put their mind to 
<br>it.
