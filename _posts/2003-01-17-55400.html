&lt;&lt; I googled it, and I found it here: <br/>

&lt;&lt;It said it was an American jump rope rhyme.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw that, but I believe that is entirely incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
It was listed in other places too, and nobody said jump rope rhyme.  One or <br/>
two said &quot;clapping song&quot; (that would be like &quot;Hey, hey, say playmate, come <br/>
out and play with me...&quot; or &quot;I had a little sister, her name was Suzi Q...&quot;). <br/>
 All those versions had &quot;auntie&quot; where the one I learned was &quot;sister.&quot;  <br/>
Theirs might all be from a common source.  Or not.<br/>
<br/>
I have a collection of books on kids&#39; rhymes and used to read ALL jump rope <br/>
rhyme books that came out and it was never in there.<br/>
<br/>
The 3-6-9 part was used in a motown-kind-of recording in the 1960&#39;s, called <br/>
&quot;Clap Clap&quot; and that one does make sense, rhythmically, as a clapping song.   <br/>
Rubber Dolly DEFINITELY has a tune (as do most clapping rhymes, but the <br/>
3-6-9- part doesn&#39;t have a tune, it&#39;s a chant.<br/>
<br/>
All the jump-rope rhymes I ever knew were chanted.  Rhythm and traditional <br/>
scheme/presentation, but no tune.<br/>
<br/>
Too much folklore for most people maybe.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Because its crossover is bluegrass and kids, I&#39;m thinking maybe it was <br/>
recorded pre-WWII and is on somebody&#39;s obscure 78rpm, or maybe it&#39;s just <br/>
passed down through families who heard their mom singing it.  <br/>
<br/>
I have another my dad&#39;s dad used to sing.  Anyone know this one?  (It would <br/>
help if I could sing it, I know...)  I have asked all my life, and now I <br/>
wonder if he made it up.  One of my dad&#39;s brothers is still living.  Maybe I <br/>
could ask him.<br/>
<br/>
A little man bought him a big bass drum<br/>
Boom Boom Boom<br/>
Who knows, says he, when the war will come<br/>
Boom Boom Boom<br/>
I&#39;m not at all frightened, you understand<br/>
But when I&#39;m called to fight for my land<br/>
I wanna be ready to play in the band<br/>
Boom Boom Boom<br/>
<br/>
He used to sing it with me sitting on his knee when I was really little and <br/>
bounce me a little through the whole song, and bigger on the Booms.  And as I <br/>
got older I&#39;d always ask him to sing it to me, because it seemed the thing he <br/>
should do, and I didn&#39;t want to forget it.<br/>
