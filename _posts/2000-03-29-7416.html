<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948118228">I have lurked a while on this list and learned a lot, and now I feel <br/>
compelled to jump in!<br/>

I read with admiration your description of your day with your seven children <br/>
-- it sounds like they are learning a lot and having a great time. But <br/>
looking through the schedule, I see that early in the morning you have half <br/>
an hour to exercise (with kids nearby) and then you don&#39;t get any time alone <br/>
again til 10 pm, when you can take a bath and read. That is a long day! I <br/>
have 2 kids, 1 in ps first grade, the other is 2 years old and not in school <br/>
yet.... I also work and I often find myself feeling drained and tapped out. <br/>
What do you do to recharge your batteries? Is time alone to think, shop, <br/>
pamper yourself a little important at all? Do you always feel obligated to <br/>
wait until everyone else&#39;s day is over before you do something for yourself? <br/>
I would like to hear from any and all on this subject. How do we get time <br/>
alone and away from the kids, husbands, housework, etc. to do things for <br/>
ourselves?<br/>
<br/>
