<div id="ygrps-yiv-456732260">Terrific idea, Sandra.......I hadn&#39;t thought about that.....it could&#39;ve<br/>
saved me plenty of anguish if someone had done that for me as a young teen.<br/>
By the time I tried Al-Anon,  in colloge,  I was at sn sge wher I was<br/>
establishing myself as ayoung adult independent from my family of<br/>
origin.....and it didn&#39;t do much for me.  (Plus by the my father had been<br/>
diagnosed as manic depressive, not alcoholic...).<br/>
<br/>
the parallels between my neighbors and my own childhood are almost<br/>
spooky....The mom works as a RN at the same hospital my mom worked at,  2nd<br/>
shift,  when I was a kid.  My dad was laid off from a long term job,  then<br/>
drifted around in low paying jobs, sometimes working, sometimes not.<br/>
Though,  I was never locked out of the house by my dad!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the kids a bit older, if you&#39;re still neighbors, you might want to<br/>
consider hooking him up with AlaTeen (he doesn&#39;t need to be a teen), which<br/>
is<br/>
an AlAnon group for kids.  It gives them a head start on realizing this<br/>
drinking is not their doing, that they&#39;re not the only one in that<br/>
situation,<br/>
and ways to feel better (and not to waste their time and energy trying to<br/>
&quot;fix&quot; the drunk).<br/>
