The day has only so many hours.  If a trip to the park fits into the flow, <br/>
terrific.  If it doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s something to be dealt with too.  <br/>
<br/>
Not all errands can be accompanied by a trip to the park or whatever will <br/>
make it fun.  Sometimes it&#39;s just grocery shopping. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, the Gameboy gets toted along, a book, some markers and paper, etc. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting that every outing should be made to be as miserable and <br/>
boring as possible.  I&#39;m just saying that the outing sometimes cannot be <br/>
rearranged to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Nor do I think that every outing has to be a source of entertainment.  <br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s just a trip to the bank or the store.  Not every outing is <br/>
entertaining.  To set that up as the expectation isn&#39;t real either.  <br/>
Sometimes the outing involves a planned or spontaneous stop at the beach -- <br/>
sometimes it doesn&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m confused, why not make it palatable?  Why not turn *your* errand<br/>
&gt; into something fun for the *child*?  Might as well make as much as<br/>
&gt; possible win-win, right?  If your child wants to do something that<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t really interest you, do you bring along a book or a snack or<br/>
&gt; your journal or something to make it a little better for you?  Why not<br/>
&gt; offer this same courtesy to children?  Seriously wondering,<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is nice on some days but is not always possible.  And sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; an errand is just an errand.  And doesn&#39;t require a trip to the park<br/>
&gt; &gt; to make it more palatable.<br/>
