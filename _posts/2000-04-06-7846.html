<div id="ygrps-yiv-790622370">To recive Teacher discounts at some stores they require a paystub to <br/>
verify employment.  <br/>
Teacher Discounts are sometimes left up to the clerk, so if it does <br/>
not work the first time try again another day with someone else. <br/>
There are also some organizations that are tax exempt and also can <br/>
use a teachers discount that is when materials are really cheep!<br/>
I have been able to use both of these at a discount book store.  Our <br/>
group was able to buy brand new book listed at $24.99 for $3.00.  <br/>
What a great deal<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623400758">I emailed Amazon.com about a homeschoolers discount.  Here is the<br/>
response I received.  I don&#39;t really understand it though.<br/>
Does it make sense to anyone?<br/>

  &gt;I am a homeschooling mother of 3.  Our local bookstores all offer<br/>
  &gt;discounts for homeschoolers, and I&#39;m wondering if you do too?<br/>
  &gt;If you do, please tell me how I redeem the discount when ordering.<br/>
  &gt;Thank You,<br/>
