You don&#39;t have to get into specifics if you don&#39;t want to, but I&#39;m curious<br/>
as to if you all enjoyed your trip &quot;out west&quot; and what any highlights were<br/>
or what things you hated?<br/>
<br/>
In short, how was your trip? :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had a great time.<br/>
We flew into Vegas which was a place that I didn&#39;t really like <br/>
although seeing the lights was cool and the kids loved the <br/>
exploding volcano in front of the mirage casino.<br/>
We then drove to the Grand Canyon which gave me my first <br/>
glimpse of the sheer emptiness of Nevada and Arizona. Every so <br/>
often you come upon a town in the middle of no-where and I just <br/>
wondered what on earth those people do for a living!<br/>
The Grand Canyon was awesome, I could have looked at it for days <br/>
and days.<br/>
We then drove to the Meteor Crater in Arizona, going round the <br/>
back of the snowy mountain that overlooks Flagstaff and again I <br/>
just enjoyed the views of emptiness. The Arizona desert is beautiful <br/>
which is something I didn&#39;t expect.<br/>
We had lunch in Flagstaff. I loved that town. People were actually <br/>
using bikes as transport rather than fashion vehicles to show off <br/>
Lycra and there were people with pink hair. I felt right at home there <br/>
:-)<br/>
We then went to see London Bridge in Lake Havasu which was <br/>
interesting but the city itself was a bit dull and hot even though its <br/>
December. Then it was Death Valley time.<br/>
It was stupendous. The mountains, the salt flats, the rocks, the <br/>
dunes. Wow. At night we went out into the desert and looked at <br/>
the stars which we could actually see cos there was no light <br/>
pollution and I felt my ears relax cos there was no noise. My kids <br/>
have never really experienced true silence before.<br/>
We saw Coyotes :-)<br/>
<br/>
Going back to Las Vegas for the flight back was really depressing. <br/>
Driving down from Yucca mountain we could see the brown blur of <br/>
pollution from 40 miles out, then the traffic and lights and all them <br/>
miserable looking people feeding money into slot machines.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to go out west again although this time I&#39;ll drive cos the <br/>
flights were horrible, small seats, terrible food and one cancelled <br/>
flight leaving us in Chicago.<br/>
I want to go to Santa fe and sedona and Taos and and and....<br/>
<br/>
I did think of Sandra too when we saw a sign that read Albuquerque <br/>
300 miles on a sign on Interstate 40 but we weren&#39;t allowed to take <br/>
the car into NM plus I didn&#39;t know Sandra&#39;s address or maybe I <br/>
would have popped by :-)<br/>

We&#39;re in the phone book--Keith and Sandra Dodd.  <br/>
Use the second listed number, though, because the first rarely has a phone on <br/>
it, just computers.<br/>

<br/>
Not in that order!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in the town between Santa Fe and Taos!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel guilty that I forget to appreciate the beauty around us. <br/>
<br/>
Driving to Alamogordo for Thanksgiving, we passed through parts of New Mexico <br/>
where you can go a long time without seeing a building--just cactus, little <br/>
trees, sage brush, mountains in the background, as far as one could possibly <br/>
see in all directions.  And we end up sleeping in the car, kids playing <br/>
Gameboy...   But them sometimes I look up and gasp because it&#39;s so gorgeous.  <br/>
Especially light and cloud shows.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394429488">I&#39;m glad you had a great time Shyrley!<br/>
It was fun reading about your travel adventures.<br/>
I love the Grand Canyon, too. We actually hiked down and spent a few nights<br/>
in it. It was hard climbing back out!<br/>
The Arizona desert *is* beautiful and I know what you mean about the vast<br/>
emptiness with little towns dotted here and there.<br/>
Flagstaff is a fun town - I&#39;m sure the university there helps to draw the<br/>
kind of people you felt at home with. ;-) Northern Arizona (and Flagstaff)<br/>
is expecting snow early next week, I just heard on the news. Too bad you<br/>
missed that!<br/>
Lake Havasu is a very popular destination for spring-breakers and partying -<br/>
I&#39;m sure you must&#39;ve heard about that. Otherwise it is a quiet little town<br/>
the rest of the time. But weren&#39;t you impressed with the London Bridge? ;-)<br/>
I&#39;ve never been to Meteor Crater or Death Valley - we&#39;ll visit someday.<br/>
I know you&#39;d love Sedona - it has a magical feel to it - or at least I think<br/>
it does.<br/>
Thanks for sharing about your trip - glad you made it  home safely and all<br/>
that. :-)<br/>
