<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603053345">I was away from the computer for two days and came back to *tons* of email!!<br/>
You all have been very busy lately! lol The conversations got heated and<br/>
even a few words were exchanged and in the end things settled down. Then I<br/>
realized (when I was finally able to get to the last digest) that I had<br/>
learned a lot! Wow...<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, am glad that people express their opions, even those with rather<br/>
UN unschooling opinions. It helps me to contrast where I am in relation to<br/>
both sides of the issue. It helps me to see more clearly the direction I<br/>
would like to head in. So, I thank all of you for your input. You make an<br/>
interesting read. :)<br/>
