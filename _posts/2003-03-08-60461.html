I would just recommend any Buddhist stuff, the easy kind of zen-thing-a-day <br/>
books, or go to a big bookstore and look at the daily affirmations and see if <br/>
any seem to fit your particulars.<br/>
<br/>
And take that controlling energy and CONTROL something!  Get your yard really <br/>
clean and weeded.  Groom the heck out of your dog.  Clean and repaper your <br/>
kitchen cabinets.  Make lists.  Go through clothes.  Make a quilt.  A really <br/>
complicated quilt.  <br/>
