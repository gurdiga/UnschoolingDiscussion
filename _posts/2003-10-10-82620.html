<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244803597">I have been having the usual frets lately about unschooling.  Not so <br/>
much about if my kids will learn but more about am I providing <br/>
enough experiences, time, etc. with them so that they have the <br/>
opportunity to learn.  That is one thing I am working on.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in the midst of all my angst I got to see my sons true <br/>
brightness that occurs when left to his own devices.  Me and the <br/>
boys went to the bookstore today.  As I was looking for something, <br/>
my 5yo saw a science book and said &quot;Look, maybe we can study <br/>
science.&quot;  I named a few areas in science to explain that science <br/>
was a general word for many different fields of science.  One I <br/>
mentioned was magnets and he grasps at that one.  I said okay but <br/>
not thinking it would go past that because he usually doesn&#39;t.  He <br/>
goes to Thomas the Train and says &quot;Look Mom, Thomas has magnets.  I <br/>
am going to study magnets over here.&quot;  So, her played for about 1/2 <br/>
hour and learned some rudimentary magnet facts along the way.  That <br/>
two sides stick and the other sides don&#39;t go together and &quot;when you <br/>
hold these like this (a bit apart) they pop together&quot;.  Talk about <br/>
hating my input and just enjoying his own process!  I just sit and <br/>
watch because he pretty much is at that &quot;I know&quot; stage.<br/>
<br/>
Later, he was playing a game on his computer and wanted me to join <br/>
him.  He was collecting scarrabs and had 7.  I casually asked how <br/>
many more he needed to get 10, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s easy Mom&quot;.  He starts <br/>
counting on his fingers from 1.  At this point I think he is going <br/>
to get confused because by the time he gets to 7 and than to 10 he <br/>
will probably lose count somewhere.  He count&quot; 1, 2, 3&quot; and says &quot;3 <br/>
more&quot;.  I am still trying to figure out how he got the answer!  Was <br/>
he counting from 7 to 10 in his head while counting 1-3 on his <br/>
fingers?  He did the same thing at the doctor&#39;s office a few months <br/>
back when I was giving him really easy problems while we were bored <br/>
and waiting.  He was answering basic math problems with no fingers, <br/>
all in his head.  I have found if he is relaxed and we are just <br/>
hanging out playing, he can answer math problems easily.  If we are <br/>
busy and he is distracted, he just answers with &quot;I &#39;don&#39;t know&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was a great day to see that he is doing fine!!  It got me <br/>
thinking about how we teach kids to do math a certain way and that <br/>
might not work for them.  I do not know how he figured the answer <br/>
out but it sure wasn&#39;t with the standard ways taught in school!!<br/>

I do math like that!  I would have said &#39;7&#39; in my head and then &#39;8 - 9 - 10&#39; on my fingers to get 3 as the answer. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869215328">I would have done the same thing Lee-Ann, but he didn&#39;t count <br/>
8,9,10.  He actually counted 1,2,3.  So I am thrown but impressed!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-302586554">Loveit, Olga!!! veddy good<br/>
<br/>
I saw some similar action, day before yesterday. The kids were <br/>
craving their math books, so we got them out and they both sat down <br/>
to do some problems. Robby did about two and a half probs LOL but <br/>
Katie got through two entire lessons.<br/>
<br/>
This is the interesting thing. When we were playing rummikub the <br/>
other night, she was adding up her tiles in her head, completely <br/>
accurately. When she sat down with paper to do it, she was getting <br/>
things wrong...wow.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC who also doesn&#39;t know what process her kids use to <br/>
arrive at their answers.<br/>
