<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892220692">I am told that when I was little (a toddler, I guess) I made up some words.<br/>
The word for vagina was pinsle and the VERY famous word (in our family) for<br/>
going pee and poo was bubba.<br/>
Going pee would be - little bubba<br/>
Going poo would be - big bubba<br/>
Farting is called an - air bubba.<br/>
<br/>
This makes me laugh just sharing this. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Now, in our family, my boys just say poo, pee and fart.<br/>

&gt; When I was a little girl my mother used the work &quot;kiki&quot; for<br/>
&gt; vagina/vulva. (??) Imagine my astonishment to discover that it was also<br/>
&gt; a girl&#39;s name! Nor could I get my schoolfriends to understand what I was<br/>
&gt; referring to.<br/>

&gt; and<br/>
&gt; clitoris??&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
