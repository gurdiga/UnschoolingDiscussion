<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623848403">We have recently finished the first two HP books, and my sons are going <br/>
crazy, moaning and groaning about not having a HP to read at night.  I drag <br/>
it out, one chapter a night, no cheating!  However, my oldest, the one that <br/>
hates to read, started to go ahead and read the next chapter after I went out <br/>
of the room.  He thought he was cheating on me!  LOL, little did he know that <br/>
I bought the books to get him hooked on reading!! <br/>
Anyway, to the point!  When we were at the book store last week, I asked <br/>
about a date for the next HP,  First of September!!!!!  Yea !  Just to let <br/>
you know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463771065">If you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">http://www.amazon.co.uk</a> they have an excerpt from the new one<br/>
(though v.short - not long enough to keep your sons happy, I&#39;m afraid) -<br/>
it&#39;s been out here in the UK for a while now, and it&#39;s brilliant!!!<br/>
