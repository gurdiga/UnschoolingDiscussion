&gt;   I think I would have to agree that I am reluctant to share some choices<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve made in parenting ie medical decisions. That fear is based on some<br/>
assumptions that I have from the tone of discussions I have read.<br/>

Interesting.  I&#39;ve seen opinions all over the map about medical issues here.<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you mean vaccinations or homeopathy, for instance.  I guess<br/>
there have been others.  I doubt there&#39;s any consensus about those issues<br/>
here.<br/>
