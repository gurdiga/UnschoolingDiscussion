Makes sense to me!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If my oldest asks me to make him a peanut butter sandwich, <br/>
unless there is some reason that I can&#39;t, I will say yes.  I don&#39;t say can&#39;t <br/>
you do it yourself, even though I know he can.  I just assume that there is a <br/>
reason that he wants his Mom to make it for him.  Not that he is lazy or <br/>
trying to take advantage of me.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Holly always want me to put the butter, salt and sour cream on <br/>
their baked potatoes.  They say it tastes better when I do it.  Marty says I know <br/>
how to put JUST the right amount of peanut butter on a sandwich, while he puts <br/>
too much.<br/>
<br/>
I think the better taste is the happiness and love they feel when I&#39;m nice to <br/>
them, as opposed to the slight fear and sorrow they might feel if I say &quot;Do <br/>
it yourself!&quot;   I know that biochemistry can change pretty quickly and make a <br/>
kind of acidic taste in my mouth.  I can go from wanting to eat to not wanting <br/>
to eat in an instant, and sometimes it&#39;s over something emotional.  So kids <br/>
are probably telling a simple and literal truth when they say &quot;It tastes better <br/>
when you make it, mom!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096436600">Well, I think most of us love when someone else does the cooking.  It <br/>
is a different enjoyment all together.  Maybe, it makes you feel like <br/>
a kid again when you were always taken care of or maybe it is the <br/>
pleasure of not doing the work!  Either way, I love when someone <br/>
cooks for me, so I can see why kids love when we pamper them a little.<br/>
