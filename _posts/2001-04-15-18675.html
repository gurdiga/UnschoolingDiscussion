<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398787286">I sent  my last post without having seen the second request for cessation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll quit.<br/>
It&#39;s the continuation of the planetary death, sky is falling discussion from <br/>
a few weeks ago, but it has turned into an attack on me now and is neither <br/>
productive nor entertaining for anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
One reason I bother to argue things that involve critical thought is that <br/>
unschooling depends on openmindedness and the willingness to allow knowledge <br/>
to change inside us and in the world around us.  Some of the things we were <br/>
taught in school (the adult-mom-homeschoolers who went ten or twenty or <br/>
thirty years ago) is no longer true, whether politically or scientifically or <br/>
whether the tradition has just changed (as in cases of grammar, punctuation, <br/>
etiquette, typing).  A platypus is a mammal.  A panda is a bear again (used <br/>
to be; wasn&#39;t; is).  The order of planets isn&#39;t as simple as I learned from <br/>
my cousin, in third grade, in a little chant about &quot;the planets that live <br/>
near the stars.&quot;  Columbus did NOT &quot;know exactly what to do,&quot; it&#39;s in there <br/>
because it&#39;s ressuring and simple and it rhymes.   <br/>
<br/>
I was defending inquiry and change.  I was being attacked personally.  <br/>
Help from others to clarify the arguments would have been appreciated, <br/>
instead of &quot;take it outside.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
To me, it seemed to be a determination from all<br/>
involved, from the very beginning, to be RIGHT. Or to<br/>
argue for the sake of argument. <br/>

<br/>
I could have hopped in there and clarified the correct<br/>
way to spell Moliere, if I wanted so badly to be right<br/>
about something or wanted to argue. But there was a<br/>
lot of sniping and bickering and negative energy<br/>
coming from that discussion, and it just kept evolving<br/>
into bickering over new things. Why would anyone want<br/>
to get drawn into that? I can just see it turning from<br/>
leeches to me insisting I&#39;ve taught french and I know<br/>
accent grave goes over the e, but my computer doesn&#39;t<br/>
have accents, and then someone else could inform me<br/>
that I&#39;m just too ignorant to know how to make my<br/>
computer do accent grave by using control-something,<br/>
and then someone else could insist that they weren&#39;t<br/>
talking about THE Moliere at all, but about Chuck<br/>
Molier, president of Podunk University and if I wasn&#39;t<br/>
such a turd I would have realized that, and here&#39;s a<br/>
link to Podunk U so I can stop being such a moron, and<br/>
on and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Juli, who&#39;s laughing and hopes you are, too.<br/>
