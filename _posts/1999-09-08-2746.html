<div id="ygrps-yiv-350083254"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;but I think if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>your kid<br/>
was left alone he would have read all on his own.  Maybe years later<br/>
than you<br/>
would have liked but he would have.  The fear is such a pernicious<br/>
thing.  We<br/>
have most of us, been schooled til we can&#39;t think straight about many<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is so true.  I believe that if I did nothing to teach my<br/>
children they would be better off than they would be in school.  My<br/>
challenge is to keep out of their way as they learn.  I interfere and it<br/>
halts their learning processes.  I have to keep busy enough so that I don&#39;t<br/>
bug them about what they should be doing.<br/>

This is what I worry about sometimes.  Am I neglecting them?<br/>
