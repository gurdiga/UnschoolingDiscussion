<br/>
A page of 100 numbers, ten rows of ten numbers in each row -- a &quot;Hundreds <br/>
Chart&quot; as they&#39;re usually called -- is nice to just have around &lt;G&gt;. Make <br/>
some copies so you have one to pull out and play with when something just <br/>
comes up.<br/>
<br/>
One fun thing to do (if it isn&#39;t fun - don&#39;t do it) is to draw a simple <br/>
pattern in all the squares where the number is a multiple of two - draw an X <br/>
across the square, for example. Then - draw a different pattern, with a <br/>
different color, in all the squares where the number is a multiple of three. <br/>
Then a different one for multiples of four -- and so on. Make the patterns <br/>
simple and use different colors -- as you&#39;re doing it - it is interesting to <br/>
see how some numbers are &quot;special&quot; -- they start looking much more fancy than <br/>
others -- the number twelve, for example, gets the patterns for two, three, <br/>
four, AND six.  It is really kind of a cool thing - and kid sometimes want to <br/>
do it over and over - with different colors and patterns. Again - this isn&#39;t <br/>
an &quot;assignment - done to &quot;teach&quot; them the multiples -- it is a game. <br/>
<br/>
Also - play &quot;Buzz&quot; --- we play in the car. If you&#39;re doing &quot;threes&quot; you play <br/>
like this:<br/>
First person says: 1<br/>
Second person says: 2<br/>
First person says: BUZZ<br/>
Second person says: 4<br/>
First person says: 5<br/>
Second person says: BUZZ<br/>
First person: 7<br/>
Second person: 8<br/>
First Person: BUZZ<br/>
<br/>
If you have more people you&#39;ll find some interesting things -- for example, <br/>
if you have three people, doing &quot;threes&quot; is boring since the same person just <br/>
says BUZZ every time. That is enlightening - itself, but doesn&#39;t make for a <br/>
fun game, so the kids will figure out to avoid doing numbers that don&#39;t work <br/>
well for whatever number of people they have playing. <br/>
<br/>
Then - you can make the game WAY more complicated.<br/>
Do two sets of multiples at once when you play: &quot;BIZZ BUZZ&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Example -- 5 people playing twos are BIZZ and threes are BUZZ:<br/>
Person 1: 1<br/>
Person 2: BIZZ<br/>
Person 3: BUZZ<br/>
Person 4: BIZZ<br/>
Person 5: 5<br/>
Person 1: BIZZ BUZZ<br/>
Person 2: 7<br/>
Person 3: BIZZ<br/>
Person 4: BUZZ<br/>
Person 5: BIZZ<br/>
<br/>
and so on.<br/>

Oh wow. I remember playing this game in college. Of course, I do believe <br/>
there was beer involved in that version. &lt;g&gt; I like the idea of playing it <br/>
with the kids, minus the beer of course. Thanks, Pam.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HA - &quot;spirolateral&quot; is a word I just learned YESTERDAY and now you USED it <br/>
today!!!! How cool is that? And how did I miss it - considering that I&#39;ve <br/>
been obsessively reading math stuff for years and years? Slipped by me <br/>
somehow, though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll copy the description from the book I was reading, here. I had to do it- <br/>
couldn&#39;t visualize what they&#39;d look like.<br/>
<br/>
1. You can make spirals with multiplication tables called spirolaterals. It <br/>
helps to have graph paper, but if you are careful with a ruler and a pencil, <br/>
that will work too. Choose a multiplication table.<br/>
<br/>
2. As an example, suppose you chose the six times table. ( 6 12 18 24 30 36 <br/>
42 48)<br/>
Add up the digits in each number - If you get a two-digit number, keep adding <br/>
those digits together until you get a one-digit number.  (6 3 9 6 3 9 6 3) <br/>
See the pattern?<br/>
<br/>
3. Draw the first line 6 squares (or inches or centimeters or whatever) long <br/>
then make a right-angled turn and draw a line of length 3 squares. Turn in <br/>
the same direction again and draw line with length of 9 squares. Keep <br/>
following this pattern until the lines begin to retrace themselves. You can <br/>
color in the patterns with different colors.<br/>
<br/>
4. Try other times tables to make other spirolaterals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277176790">&quot;Spirolateral&quot; was a gift from my father the year I got a<br/>
spirograph kit for Christmas - the spirolaterals were arithmetic;<br/>
the curves of a spirograph were calculus, done mechanically, and<br/>
proof that it was all mechanical/real world was found in the<br/>
curves of a nautilus shell.  How cool is that?<br/>
