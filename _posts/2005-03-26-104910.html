<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903979631">I&#39;m very new, probably way too new to be posting, but I see some familiar<br/>
names, and I had to add to this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I have 9yo with a severe peanut allergy, and a 6.5yo with a slightly less<br/>
severe allergy to tree nuts.<br/>
<br/>
The 9yo with the peanut allergy (who could very possibly die if he has an<br/>
exposure to peanuts without rescue medication available) has never chosen to<br/>
eat peanuts. His only exposure in recent years occurred when an item<br/>
contained peanuts that wasn&#39;t supposed to.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, the 6yo -- I can&#39;t remember if she was 2 or 3, but I&#39;m sure<br/>
she was in the 2.5-to-3.5 range -- chose to eat some chocolate that grandma<br/>
had sent that contained walnuts. I mentioned to her that it contained<br/>
walnuts and that she would likely have some problems with it. She chose to<br/>
eat the candy (and a lot of it) anyway. In the past she had had mild<br/>
reactions to a small taste of nuts. This time, her reaction was rather<br/>
intense. It went away with Benadryl, though. (My son with the peanut problem<br/>
has a more intense reaction that Benadryl doesn&#39;t stop.)<br/>
<br/>
To this day, nearly 4 years later, she has not eaten any kind of tree nut,<br/>
even accidentally -- she can tell by the smell if something would be a<br/>
problem. <br/>
<br/>
I carry Benadryl and my son has an Epi-Pen, just in case -- but they have<br/>
done an excellent job on their own in avoiding the allergens. I admit I was<br/>
able to allow the daughter to eat the walnuts before I knew all the<br/>
potential consequences. Food just doesn&#39;t become a big issue in my house,<br/>
and I&#39;m glad because it was always a big issue for me. I struggle with my<br/>
weight while my kids are fit and lean and make healthy choices.<br/>
<br/>
For a short time, I kept peanut butter out of the house. It has returned,<br/>
however. It&#39;s one of my 6yo&#39;s favorite foods, and I didn&#39;t want her to have<br/>
to suffer. We know to be careful.<br/>
<br/>
Please understand that in sharing about my kids being able to monitor their<br/>
own consumption of hazardous (for them!) foods at a young age I have no<br/>
misconceptions that I am anywhere near where I want to be in our unschooling<br/>
journey. I expect to learn a lot more than I can contribute.<br/>
