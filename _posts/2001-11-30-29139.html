<div id="ygrps-yiv-540356902">We have two of them.  One is REALLY old (maybe 30 or so), is a combination<br/>
convection oven and dehydrator (I like it the best) and I don&#39;t have the<br/>
faintest what the name is (it is in the rafters now as we are done<br/>
dehydrating for this year) and the other one is one of those round things<br/>
they sell in tv which we bought because it was cheap and we needed to run<br/>
more trays during the peak season.  It works pretty well and you can buy<br/>
special sheets to set in them for making fruit leathers.  The other reason<br/>
we bought it was the kidlets wanted to do their own dehydrating and it isn&#39;t<br/>
heavy and it doesn&#39;t get hot to the touch where little hands would get<br/>
burned.  It is easy to use and they love using it.<br/>
