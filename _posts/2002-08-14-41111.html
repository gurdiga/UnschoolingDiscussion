My last reply to your patient explanation of what you meant, was just me <br/>
yapping uncontrollably -- nothing new, I suppose. I know that you don&#39;t need <br/>
me or anyone else to explain that the New Testament came to us in a sort of <br/>
round about way by folks other than Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you were getting at about not thinking for ourselves. Sorry <br/>
for condescending.<br/>
