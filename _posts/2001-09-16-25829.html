I thought I credited my source pretty well.  The Great Books are easy to <br/>
find.  That&#39;s where I read it and I just reported it here in case anyone here <br/>
hadn&#39;t known about that either.  I&#39;m no expert, but it was information I <br/>
hadn&#39;t had before. Other things on Islam I&#39;d read or been told or seen in <br/>
videos before, but that one aspect was new to me, when I stayed at my friend <br/>
Kate&#39;s house in Denver last year and picked that book off the shelf to read <br/>
in bed. <br/>
<br/>
SO.  How do you unschool?  <br/>

reasonable *start* if you wanted to find out more about Islam.  And she did <br/>
mention some supporting materials.<br/>
