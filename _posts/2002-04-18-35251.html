<div id="ygrps-yiv-37771791">&lt;Have any of you guys caught &quot;the Osbournes&quot; on MTV?Â  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My older daughters and I watch the Osborns and sometimes we think they are <br/>
comparatively mild, compared to our house (LOL)<br/>
Not the cursing (of course...) but the practical jokes, sharing of bodily <br/>
fumes, and generally grossing each other out. But we don&#39;t have all the <br/>
bickering--my kids don&#39;t fight much. Still I think it&#39;s really pretty funny.<br/>
