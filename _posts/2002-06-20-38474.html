 </span></blockquote>Saying that if they stay up late they&#39;ll miss the bus isn&#39;t necessarily a <br/>
natural consequence. It might be a concern - if this is a kid who stays up <br/>
late and then can&#39;t get moving in the morning. Maybe it is a natural <br/>
consequence that the kid ENJOYS - I used to love it when I was too slow <br/>
getting ready for school and didn&#39;t have time to walk - loved having my mom <br/>
DRIVE me to school. It was special.<br/>
<br/>
The NATURAL consequence of staying up late is probably just feeling more <br/>
tired the next day. And it might or might not be worth it - but kids will <br/>
learn, naturally, to consider that possibility when they&#39;re deciding when to <br/>
go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re going to go someplace really early in the morning - which we are <br/>
TOMORROW - my kids have learned, from experiencing the natural consequence of <br/>
being overtired and not enjoying their day as much as they would have with <br/>
enough sleep, that it usually pays to try to get to sleep a lot earlier than <br/>
usual (usual is very late). I might remind them that they have to get up <br/>
early, but they are just as likely to remind ME to get to bed earlier than <br/>
usual, &quot;Remember, Mommy, we don&#39;t want you to be tired and cranky tomorrow, <br/>
okay?&quot; &lt;G&gt; <br/>
