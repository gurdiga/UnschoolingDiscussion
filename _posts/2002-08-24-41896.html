&gt; international list meant to share unschooling philosopy and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since this is an international list I&#39;d like to ask a rather basic <br/>
question...(I know the answer somewhat for here in AZ (which BTW seems to be <br/>
very easy to unschool <br/>
given what I&#39;ve read of the laws here but I&#39;d like to get that international <br/>
flavor.)...<br/>
<br/>
What has proven to you that unschooling would work and/or is would be <br/>
practical for you?  To me it seems so logical but my children aren&#39;t &quot;school <br/>
age&quot; yet.  I&#39;m always interested in what has inspired others to do the things <br/>
they do...and I know I have so much to learn in order to &quot;let&quot; them unschool. <br/>
 I especially like books...I&#39;ve collected quite the collection of web <br/>
addresses on unschooling but books are easier for me to read.<br/>
<br/>
I know this may seem like such a simple easy question -- the ultimate basic <br/>
question really.  But it would help me out as I learn best from hearing other <br/>
people&#39;s experiences and also help me understand this list a bit more as I&#39;m <br/>
a bit confused about this recent thread (and I think that&#39;s probably for the <br/>
best from what I&#39;m reading :)<br/>

<br/>
To me, &quot;working&quot; meant that my daughter would be living and growing<br/>
joyfully in the world, and she is. I&#39;m not sure how practical that is -<br/>
we started unschooling with absolutely no idea how we could even survive<br/>
financially (I&#39;m a single mom with no outside sources of financial help)<br/>
but believing that this was the only way she could be truly happy. We<br/>
tried school, charter and private, developmental and funky as it comes,<br/>
and she was so miserable. By the end I was begging them to just leave her<br/>
alone and let her do what she wanted...<br/>

it.  For though I&#39;d had to let go and have faith which at the beginning was<br/>
extremely hard even though I&#39;d read about adult unschoolers.  Unschooling<br/>
was practical initially because I couldn&#39;t seem to homeschool my oldest any<br/>
other way.  Letting go, after about 6 months, tremendously improved our<br/>
relationship and helped my understanding of unschooling and all it&#39;s<br/>
benefits over &#39;homeschooling&#39;.  I realize now that my way of parenting<br/>
didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t mesh with any of the other homeschooling styles.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What has proven to you that unschooling would work and/or is would be<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always enjoyed learning but couldn&#39;t figure out why it needed to be so<br/>
dull in school. But I&#39;m also very much drawn to learning that provides<br/>
satisfactory feedback that learning is taking place. So in college and later<br/>
I very casually looked into Montessori and John Holt and various programs<br/>
that provide a microcosm of the world for kids to explore. I thought<br/>
homeschooling sounded interesting.<br/>
<br/>
When Kathryn was 3 I stumbled onto AOL&#39;s old homeschooling forums. I read<br/>
*everything* from unschooling to fundamentalist Christian school at home.<br/>
Even though I was drawn to the systematic use of great resources, the<br/>
unschoolers seemed to be having so much fun with life. I thought what they<br/>
were doing was pretty iffy and didn&#39;t provide enough satisfaction in the<br/>
form of feedback that progress was taking place. But there was no denying<br/>
that they were *enjoying* life. :-) So I enjoyed hanging around with them<br/>
much more than any of the other groups.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I started to get what they were saying. And I was definitely<br/>
seeing that if my daughter didn&#39;t eagerly devour the programs I was mentally<br/>
trying out that the only option was to make her. (I couldn&#39;t waste it after<br/>
all!)<br/>
<br/>
So, unschooling is sort of by default for me. ;-) It was the only way of<br/>
learning that guaranteed fun and avoided forcing (which would be unfun!) It<br/>
didn&#39;t give me anything else I was looking for. In fact, quite the opposite.<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not an natural unschooler. Though I *know* it&#39;s natural and can<br/>
explain how it&#39;s natural, it doesn&#39;t come naturally to my personality or my<br/>
mental mindset created by society. Quite the opposite, in fact! (And anyone<br/>
who comes to the South Carolina conference can come see me work through that<br/>
internal war in my &quot;Why you can&#39;t let go&quot; talk :-)<br/>

I had that background already when I met the unschooling family.<br/>

much. There was *one* inclusive (i.e. non-religious) group in a city of<br/>
almost a million people, and most of the members were pretty schooly,<br/>
although there were a few other unschoolers...  but when we lived in the<br/>
bay area, there was *one* religious group in the east bay (that I knew<br/>
of, anyway) and at least 6 inclusive ones, each of which included a lot<br/>
of unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-897183578">Cool!  My brother also &quot;dropped out&quot;.  My parents couldn&#39;t get him to <br/>
go to school and eventually allowed him to become an emancipated <br/>
minor so he could legally not go to school.  They hadn&#39;t been able to <br/>
get him to go to school regularly and the fines were getting to be <br/>
too much.  This was very upsetting for them to have a &quot;drop out&quot; for <br/>
a son--they were both teachers. <br/>
<br/>
He is an extremely intelligent guy.  After dropping out and spending <br/>
a year &quot;wasting his life away doing nothing but playing his guitar&quot;, <br/>
he had taught himself how to play guitar well enough to get accepted <br/>
into Berkley college of music.  <br/>
<br/>
I was talking about my mom about parenting in general the other day, <br/>
and she now acknowledges that homeschooling would have been better <br/>
for him than trying to force him to go to school every day.  BUT, she <br/>
says, it would have been tough because he wouldn&#39;t have listened to <br/>
her and done his homeschool schoolwork.  I told her he should have <br/>
been unschooled, not homeschooled (and she knows we&#39;re unschooling). <br/>
And she said no, because unschooling means no school at all.  I said <br/>
it means no school at all, but not no education at all and she <br/>
disagreed. <br/>
<br/>
I told her all of the things my daughter does in one day that are <br/>
educational but I don&#39;t think she gets it yet.  Maybe she will <br/>
eventually...<br/>

<br/>
1. My husband-He dropped out of high school and every college and trade <br/>
school since. He is also the most educated person I know. He writes, makes <br/>
beautiful candles, reads voraciously, and is a working computer programmer, <br/>
all without a diploma.<br/>
<br/>
2. My son-His short ps career showed me the faults of schooling on an <br/>
assembly line, especially for that poor square peg being shoved in the round <br/>
hole. He has thrived in an unschooling setting.<br/>
<br/>
3. My daughter-she has demonstrated time and again how a child can   just <br/>
blossom in freedom. She knows nothing but an unschooling life and constantly <br/>
amazes us with the things she chooses to do, the questions she asks and the <br/>
excitement for learning she maintains.<br/>

and always wanted to be homeschooled.  Its hard for me to see school in a <br/>

I guess for me homeschooling, and unschooling in particular, just seem more <br/>
natural and that&#39;s why we want to raise our children that way.<br/>
