I am confused as to why this idea would be considered<br/>
dangerous.  Personally, I think we *do* choose our own<br/>
family, as well as attract all the &#39;positive&#39; and<br/>
&#39;negative&#39; things that happen to us. I don&#39;t mean to<br/>
say that we are necessarily responsible on a conscious<br/>
level, or that anyone should ever feel guilty for<br/>
something that happens to them.. only that we are<br/>
often creating by default, and that every situation<br/>
can change for the better.  Why is this a dangerous<br/>

Because it justifies abuse and violence.<br/>
If people have attracted the negative things that happen to them, then not <br/>
only do they not need to feel guilty, but those who DO the things don&#39;t need <br/>
to feel guilty.<br/>
<br/>
If parents don&#39;t bother to be the best possible parents they can be, they can <br/>
just say &quot;OH well, these kids chose us, and I guess we were fated to be <br/>
half-ass parents.&quot;<br/>

I think trying to fully explain this belief system would probably <br/>
take more time (and interest) than we all have.. but I think it is <br/>
easy to take one idea out of context and call it dangerous... <br/>
certainly that could be done with many &#39;religious&#39; theories as well. <br/>
(Admittedly, not my area of expertise :-) )<br/>

believe that we only live one life and that children are innocent <br/>
bystanders then I can see why you would feel this way. I think we all <br/>
are old souls who have been around many times, in many different <br/>
situations.  I think we have chosen and attracted our current <br/>
circumstances in ways and for reasons that are not always clear.  <br/>
That&#39;s not to say that I wouldn&#39;t have sympathy for someone who was <br/>
in a horrible situation, or that I wouldn&#39;t help if I could... <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m talking about 2 different levels here.. we choose things <br/>
on one level that we are not necessarily consciously aware of... does <br/>
that mean blame the victim?  Not at all.. it means be aware that <br/>
things have a higher purpose than we may be able to realize right now.<br/>
