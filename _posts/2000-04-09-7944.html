&lt;&lt; Because we are a retailer, and not a wholesaler, the discounts listed<br/>
 in our catalog, like the payment methods we are able to accept, apply<br/>
 to all of our customers--individual, educational, institutional, and<br/>
 corporate alike. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think they mean that their regular prices are already discounted and they <br/>
won&#39;t discount them any further for particular groups.  Everyone has access <br/>
to the same already-discounted prices.  <br/>

It looks like they are nicely saying that they have 1 discount, and that<br/>
everyone is able to get the same discount. But that is the one that is<br/>
already there. No special discounts for anyone :(<br/>
