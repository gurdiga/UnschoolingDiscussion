&lt;&lt; Nicki, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &#39;snacks&#39; at the breast...  is <br/>
 this a problem?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   This was the mother&#39;s term. Her dd only nurses for very short stints. But <br/>
I did notice she nursed for a long time last night at dinner. The mother had <br/>
just started on the wine. Over the course of Sunday she had had 2 full <br/>
bottles and a mini bottle of wine. The 11 mos. dd was cranky and barely <br/>
nursing. To me that is a hell of a lot of wine for a nursing mother to drink. <br/>
By bed last night the baby was again very fussy and irritable. Could be <br/>
normal fussiness or could be alcohol content IMO. She said the baby woke all <br/>
night every hour trying to nurse. During the day (w/out wine) this child is <br/>
the happiest baby I have ever seen. She is very cranky by evening. Which <br/>
could be normal but seems to me tied to the consumption rate that day.<br/>
&#39;<br/>
   Turns out over our visit this mother and I have very different views and <br/>
mothering styles anyway so maybe I am just being overly .......something <br/>
can&#39;t think right now my neck is killing me. Stress. :o) <br/>

&lt;&lt; What does &quot;snack at the breast&quot; mean really? Is it every so often wants a<br/>
 little nursie? My daughter is at the breast about every hour or two (she is<br/>
 almost 10 months now), it&#39;s a comfort thing, and she needs it or she gets<br/>
 cranky, its almost like it refuels her. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   This is normal to me ,yes. The mother feels she snacks b/c she never <br/>
nurses for a length of time any longer. I mentioned in my other reply how <br/>
much she drank(drinks) and how the baby nursed the other night before the <br/>
wine entered her system. I too believe a glass of wine or beer is fine,I <br/>
needed it for let down a few times. But excessive amounts scare me a bit.<br/>
