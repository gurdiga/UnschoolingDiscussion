    this has given me a lot to think about!  Thanks for writing this<br/>
  &gt; out.  Now I&#39;m thinking I should be making more of an effort at<br/>
  &gt; pursuing my own interests.<br/>
<br/>
  Shouldn&#39;t require a big effort.<br/>
<br/>
  Reading your day made me exhausted! :) I&#39;m thinking of it this way.<br/>
<br/>
  If you have a book you love to read, why not let the kids know what <br/>
  you&#39;d like to do, as well? Say to them, &quot;I&#39;ll play these board games <br/>
  with you today, and I&#39;m also planning to read a chapter from this book <br/>
  right after lunch. What would you like to do during that time that <br/>
  doesn&#39;t need me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  You could offer to pop in a video tape or to have them also read to <br/>
  themselves during that time.<br/>
<br/>
  Last year when life got crazy with activities and driving and TV and <br/>
  computers, I realized I needed some quiet. I asked the kids if they&#39;d <br/>
  mind if I lit a candle for half an hour and we used that half hour as a <br/>
  quiet time in the house. No music, TV, videos. Anyone could read or <br/>
  play quietly in any room of the house, but no loud discussions or <br/>
  running through the house games.<br/>
<br/>
  They were willing. We did this for a couple weeks. It helped me when I <br/>
  needed it. We stopped when it became irksome to the youngest.<br/>
<br/>
  What I&#39;m realizing is that we need to help our kids to realize that we <br/>
  are humans who live with them and have needs/wants/limits too. This <br/>
  doesn&#39;t have to be oppressive or punitive or neglecting. It&#39;s just <br/>
  real. They don&#39;t mind supporting a mom when she needs it.<br/>
<br/>
    Yet I still feel that pursuing my own<br/>
  &gt; interests WILL be competing with my children&#39;s interests to some<br/>
  &gt; point.  From past experience, I know that they do.  Me pursuing my<br/>
  &gt; own interests almost always results in me telling the kids &quot;No&quot; at<br/>
  &gt; some point.<br/>
<br/>
  What do you mean &quot;No&quot;? If you&#39;re making dinner, doesn&#39;t that mean you <br/>
  can&#39;t play a game?<br/>
<br/>
  If you are peeing in the bathroom or taking a shower, doesn&#39;t that mean <br/>
  you aren&#39;t available?<br/>
<br/>
  If the only time your kids see you not with them is to do personal <br/>
  hygiene and care-taking, they will feel that you exist solely for their <br/>
  use/entertainment. Then they resent you when you take time away from <br/>
  them. But if you all live together in the home sharing interests, <br/>
  helping pitch in to make lunch or clean up, life is lived for everyone, <br/>
  not just for the sake of some.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; It&#39;s only 9:30 am and I already have a huge list of what the kids<br/>
  &gt; want to do with me today.  The list will get longer as we go further<br/>
  &gt; on in the day (it always does! lol).<br/>
<br/>
  Why a list?<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I need to pause a minute to breathe or I&#39;ll get really overwhelmed<br/>
  &gt; thinking about adding one of my own interests to this day. :)<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s the difference right there. It shouldn&#39;t be that you are adding <br/>
  anything. Your interests will naturally come out of you. For instance, <br/>
  have you turned on a CD of music that you enjoy today? (Just put it on <br/>
  the CD player-doesn&#39;t take time away from anyone.)<br/>
<br/>
  Have you lit a candle or arranged a couple of flowers?<br/>
<br/>
  Can you put the talk radio show on that you like while you make lunch?<br/>
<br/>
  Can you leave an art book on the kitchen table open to a favorite <br/>
  painting and look at it each time you walk by?<br/>
<br/>
  You don&#39;t need to &quot;make time&quot; for interests as much as stay interested. <br/>
  Start tiny. I used to read while I nursed the baby. I miss that time so <br/>
  much, actually. When your kids color pictures, use real art pencils so <br/>
  that you can color with them and make something really pretty for you. <br/>
  Tape it to the refrigerator.<br/>
<br/>
  Pick out some videos at the library that you like and watch them with <br/>
  your kids. If they say &quot;boring&quot; let them know that you are going to <br/>
  watch five or ten minutes of it and then play the board game.<br/>
<br/>
  My point is this. What a mom often means when she says she doesn&#39;t have <br/>
  time to pursue her interests is that she has lost touch with what <br/>
  interests her because her life has become so consumed with the primary <br/>
  interest: raising children. Guilt prevents remembering what she liked <br/>
  (what colors, music, movies, hand crafts etc.).<br/>
<br/>
  But over time, a slow burn grows until one day depression is often the <br/>
  result.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, kids grow up and need you less and then it&#39;s easy to resent their <br/>
  growing independence.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I don&#39;t get when people say, &quot;I do my thing and when they need me, I<br/>
  &gt; stop and help them and then go back to my own thing&quot;.  Because when I<br/>
  &gt; stop to help them they have me helping them all day long.  That&#39;s not<br/>
  &gt; an exaggeration.<br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps your kids are used to that lifestyle. What if they began to see <br/>
  you emerge? What if they discovered they could help mom pick out her <br/>
  favorite CDs at the library? My daughter used to find art books for me <br/>
  when she was only 5 knowing that I loved to look at them. It goes both <br/>
  ways.<br/>
<br/>
  I thought I had this resolved in my own head, that<br/>
  &gt; that&#39;s just the way things are, that I need to accept it and<br/>
  &gt; appreciate that they want to be with me so much, that they won&#39;t be<br/>
  &gt; little forever so appreciate while it lasts.  Now you have me<br/>
  &gt; doubting that again. :)<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s both. You&#39;ll never get this time back as a mother or as an adult <br/>
  at whatever age you are. Both/and. Children require the lion&#39;s share <br/>
  but not all.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; When I first read your post yesterday, it really struck a chord with<br/>
  &gt; me.  I can see the truth in what you wrote.  So yesterday I got out<br/>
  &gt; some books that I thought would make some good altered books.  I had<br/>
  &gt; read about people doing this and it interested me a lot.  Of course I<br/>
  &gt; did most of it while staying up really late after the kids went to<br/>
  &gt; bed &lt;grin&gt;  but at least I did it. :)  (I&#39;m TIRED now! lol  I only<br/>
  &gt; got 4 hours of sleep and I need much more than that.)<br/>
<br/>
  Being tired isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world. :) But perhaps you are <br/>
  on a binge/purge cycle. Don&#39;t toss the book or the idea. Just &quot;alter&quot; <br/>
  &lt;g&gt; the amount you read tonight.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I hear the kids out in the livingroom beginning to fight.  Alisha<br/>
  &gt; just asked me how much longer I&#39;m going to be on the computer.  Deep<br/>
  &gt; breath...Gotta go try to find some kind of balance to this day!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Good idea. Small steps.<br/>
<br/>

  P.S. I don&#39;t mean to sound like a &quot;know-it-all&quot; but I&#39;ve actually spent <br/>
  quite a bit of time on this topic. I have a website for moms growing in <br/>
  their own educations and have spoken numerous times to homeschool mom <br/>
  groups about how to be a self-educated, nurtured adult while a fully <br/>
  active homeschooling (unschooling) mom. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
