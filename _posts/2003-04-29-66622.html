<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160354462">Alright here&#39;s the latest for any of you that have helped with my ten year old problem of my dd&#39;s dad. We are sort of verbally aurguing it out over Molly&#39;s ed plan, ugh, so today it hit a high with Molly calling me from school telling me she wanted to come home, and I feel like now I just need to stop being so afraid of this man and do something. So, I am wondering if anyone out there (especially in the New England area) knows any legal services that specialize in homeschooling. He has told me he would fight this and win. He told Molly it is &quot;abnormal&quot; and &quot;weird&quot; that only &quot;normal &quot; kids go to school ect ect. So Molly is totally confused and I need to just do something about it. The problem is if I decide to take him to court (before he takes me) also regarding some child support issues and visitation stuff I need to make sure that I do it right. I need a good lawyer with me. However, we are not exactly rolling in the dough either. Any advise! Thanks Kelli<br/>
