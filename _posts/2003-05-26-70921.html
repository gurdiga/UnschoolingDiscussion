<div id="ygrps-yiv-868420519">&lt;&lt;They were all strays (one found, two wild barncats, captured as<br/>
kittens, and would have rather have stayed there, wild with their mom).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh this is such a struggle for me!  Last week the kids were outside playing <br/>
in the sprinkler and a baby blue jay fell from it&#39;s nest right beside them.  <br/>
They all ran in to tell me about it and we left it hoping it&#39;s mother would <br/>
care for it.  It could hardly stand and had only down feathers.  We read <br/>
everything we could find on the internet, called a wildlife rescue and <br/>
decided to hand feed it.  Last night, my husband built him a cage.  I am so <br/>
torn because I want him to be free but he seems to have no intention of <br/>
being so.  Over the weekend we set up a fallen branch in the tree he fell <br/>
from, hoping he might make it back up or the mother would help him.  He sat <br/>
there for about an hour and came running to us and jumped into my lap.  The <br/>
adult blue jays were interested and swarmed but never came to feed him.  He <br/>
was crying and hungry so we&#39;re back to square one.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home from camp this weekend, Chris and Haleigh found a turtle in <br/>
the road.  He grabbed it and brought it home.  I was so mad!  He really <br/>
wanted to keep it but I took him to the creek near our house and set him <br/>
free.  He [the turtle] was so happy.  Ran into the water and caught food <br/>
immediately.  Made me feel really good.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the reason is but I have a hard time with people capturing <br/>
wildlife and keeping it.  Silly since  have a bird in my garage in an <br/>
elaborate cage and domesticated cats, but to tear them away from their homes <br/>
seems so cruel.  I go back and forth.  Now Chris (my husband) wants to go <br/>
buy a turtle.  So why does that not bother me as much??  Maybe because <br/>
captivity is all they have known?  I don&#39;t know....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711448630">Sounds like Jean Craighead-George, who wrote &quot;Julie of the Wolves&quot; <br/>
and also a book of stories about animals which have adopted her and <br/>
her family...&quot;A Tarantula in My Purse.&quot; I think there is a difference <br/>
between rescuing animals that have been hurt or orphaned, and taking <br/>
them away for other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re taking in that baby blue jay...well, if the adults didn&#39;t come <br/>
get him, there&#39;s nothing wrong with you caring for it. Chances are, <br/>
it&#39;ll go out on its own and be a free bird, when it has grown enough <br/>
to do so. Or...you&#39;ll have a charming, funny pet bird. A good <br/>
experience for your kids, don&#39;t you think? As long as they know it&#39;s <br/>
only because the baby needed rescuing.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not legal to keep a wild bird.   With the exception of House<br/>
Sparrows, Pigeons and Starlings, birds in the US have protected status.  <br/>
You can&#39;t even disturb or have in your possession a birds nest, legally.<br/>
<br/>
And for Jennifer, the parents of your Blue Jay wouldn&#39;t go near him if<br/>
they thought you were still around because they would never lead a<br/>
potential predator to their offspring.   You could have just returned him<br/>
to his nest if you knew where it was.   Do be careful if you attempt it<br/>
now as Blue jays are notorious for defending their nests aggressively.  <br/>
They won&#39;t hurt you, but they could easily startle you off a high ladder<br/>
with the loud smacking of their wings.    They will dive at your head and<br/>
whack you.<br/>
