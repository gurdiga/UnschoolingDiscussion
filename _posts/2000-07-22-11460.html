<div id="ygrps-yiv-82723828">&lt;&lt; Also. I&#39;ve heard of people<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; having trouble keeping the weight off and I can&#39;t imagine all these<br/>
 &gt; eggs and meat products can be good for your cholesterol levels. Oh<br/>
 &gt; well, I guess no diet is perfect. LOL. Amy &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i&#39;ve missed this entire thread... i had to delete many e-mails cuz my son had <br/>
surgery and life has been too hectic for the luxury of reading... but i saw <br/>
this and wanted to share my experience with the atkins diet... i started it <br/>
last january and stayed on it for about 3 months... i lost 20 lbs... and my <br/>
menstrual cycle... i&#39;m 47, so i thought maybe it was just pre menopause... of <br/>
course, i had no other symptoms... no hot flashes even... a little voice in <br/>
the back of my head said...&quot;the diet is responsible&quot;... but as i was losing <br/>
weight, i didn&#39;t want to give it up... finally after the 3rd missed period, i <br/>
stopped the diet and made an appt. at the gynocologist... it took 6 weeks to <br/>
get an appointment... in the meantime, the period returned... 3fold... like a <br/>
deluge... when i finally saw the gyno, she told me that i lost my period <br/>
because i was malnourished... me, all 240 lbs of me... she told me that the <br/>
diet is extremely dangerous to women... that eating all the hormones in meat <br/>
& dairy products may also have disrupted my own hormonal balance... i was <br/>
eating massive quantities of cheese - loaded with milk & cream which is <br/>
loaded with bovine growth hormones ... so that&#39;s what happened to me... i <br/>
won&#39;t be going on the atkins diet anytime soon again...</div>
