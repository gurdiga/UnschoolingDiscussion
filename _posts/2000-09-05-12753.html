Personally, I don&#39;t see too much difference between H$LDA&#39;s school-at-home,<br/>

&gt; &gt;From what I&#39;ve seen on the Bush net page he is not in favor of <br/>
&gt; putting any restrictions on the homeschooler.  I think KIPP is an <br/>
&gt; idea he&#39;s considering for ps.  You have to admit there&#39;s a lot of <br/>
&gt; room for improvement in ps for those who can not or do not wish to <br/>
&gt; homeschool.  In fact in Tampa, FL area his campaign has a homeschool <br/>
&gt; mom who acts as a coordinator contact for homeschool.  <br/>
