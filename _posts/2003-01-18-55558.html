&gt; &gt; **Sometimes when I write those things so plainly I worry that I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; cause more damage than good in some families.  But since things ARE going<br/>
&gt; &gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; well with my boys (and I hope it stays that way) it seems worth continuing<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; share. **<br/>

&gt; &gt; Please keep writing these stories,   they are so helpful.   I know I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt; said it before but it bears repeating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sandra,<br/>
&gt;        I&#39;ll second this. Did you know that you attended the unschooling group<br/>
&gt; at Shyrley&#39;s last week; so did Joyce? We were so glad you were there. Since<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been part of this email group, I have benefited from your<br/>
&gt; stories/advice. I know everyone attending the ungroup feels the same.<br/>

Maybe that&#39;s why I was so out of it here!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(My ankle starts to swell and hurt at some point each day, and I just veg out <br/>
with it up for a while...)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reassurance that I wasn&#39;t traumatizing EVERYBODY with my <br/>
candid outpourings.   <br/>
