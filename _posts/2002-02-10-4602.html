<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432563363">I said the sentence below, but there was more to it and it has been snipped.<br/>
My question was why use age as a difference?  If as unschoolers it&#39;s<br/>
advocated that we are all equal what does the teachers age have to do with<br/>
my six year old?  Either way I let him decide that he would speak for<br/>
himself with me standing right behind him.  The next week he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
go for the same reason he didn&#39;t want to go that week (he didn&#39;t want to sit<br/>
in the same place), so I didn&#39;t make him go.  This week he didn&#39;t want to go<br/>
again and it was the last class so I didn&#39;t make him go.... I&#39;m not signing<br/>
him up for anymore classes unless he really wants them, but that would be<br/>
part of learning about the unschooling process.  If this is a list for only<br/>
seasoned radical unschoolers I was unaware of that.  Because I disagree with<br/>
&quot;the leader&quot; does not mean I&#39;m wrong for my family.  There are no<br/>
authorities on unschooling.... Isn&#39;t that the whole point, that we each have<br/>
deal with our children the way that feels comfortable for our child and<br/>
learn what works and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I have not been responding to many of the posts because I feel that I don&#39;t<br/>
want to get into a &quot;war of words&quot;, who can say things &quot;the best&quot; or<br/>
&quot;correctly&quot; so I&#39;ll go back to lurking, like many others and then when<br/>
someone says something I disagree with I&#39;ll just think it rather than bring<br/>
it up.  That way it&#39;s safer than having the whole of what I said pulled<br/>
apart.  It was one of the reasons to leave unschooling.com. picky, picky,<br/>
picky.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693857141">Dawn, I got lost in this thread.   Where Sandra say you were doing something wrong for your family? <br/>
<br/>
The way I saw it, she was speaking to the comment that a 6 year old could be &quot;expected&quot; to deal with an adult.   I imagine that thought set an idea in Sandra&#39;s head that she felt would benefit many of us.  If you had a notion that you were trying to toughen your son up by making him stand up to the teacher, you may have read what Sandra said and thought about it a little.  The rest of us got to think about this idea as well.<br/>
<br/>
You clarified that you were not trying to toughen up your little guy but did want him to feel he could question all people no matter their age.<br/>
<br/>
In a previous post, I *disagreed* with the concept that having family dinners was controlling.  After hearing my reasons, no one said they went against unschooling.  If they had I would have taken a harder look.<br/>
<br/>
At another time, I explained how we handle food choices in our home.   My ideas were challenged and I gained some new insight.  If I had not spoken up, I would not have benefited.  <br/>
<br/>
If you choose to stay in lurk mode, you will have to wait for someone else to ask the questions you want the answers to.  It may take longer but I guess it is safer.  <br/>
<br/>
If we all choose to lurk because we are afraid, we will miss out on some pretty great discussions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Dawn,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you feel like lurking.  I think we all understood your son<br/>
*wanted* to speak with the teacher.  Probably most of us would have done<br/>
the same thing, let him ask, be there for support, to clarify, whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I think the broader subject of children being  left to deal with teachers<br/>
on there own  came naturally from that.  It&#39;s something  for all of us to<br/>
think about; do we advocate for our (less experienced, more easily<br/>
intimidated)  kids with people of authority?   Your post was a kind of<br/>
jumping off point.<br/>
I&#39;ve appreciated your contribution to the list and I hope you change your<br/>
mind.  Thinking about this stuff makes us all smarter, better parents.   <br/>
