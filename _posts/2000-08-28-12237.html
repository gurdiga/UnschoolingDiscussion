<br/>
we started H/Sing 5 months ago and had attended school for 6yrs -<br/>
 well at the moment we are<br/>
&gt; deschooling - I am begining to wonder if she is ever going to<br/>
&gt; progress to unschooling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The rule of thumb on this is supposed to be 1 month for every year in<br/>
school. According to this you have one more month to go. Of course, my dd<br/>
was only in school for K and 3 mos of 3rd grade and we&#39;re still deschooling<br/>
9 months later :). Amazing the impact school really has (scary)!<br/>

learning is taking place without pushing.  Boredom eventually leads to <br/>
action.  Action leads to learning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It can take a long time to de-school, so try to be patient. I think it helps <br/>
if you try to put what the kids are doing in public school out of your mind <br/>
and do some of the things that you haven&#39;t had time for in the past. Go to <br/>
some different places. Do zoos, and museums and festivals. Go to a library <br/>
in a different city. Take the time to stop at a park that you have never <br/>
been to, or to one you loved when she was little. If you see a class or <br/>
workshop offered at a craft shop that interests her-or if it only interests <br/>
you, sign up. Do something that you yourself have always wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
This new way of learning does take some time. Its different to be able to do <br/>
what you want instead of having someone tell you what you will learn about, <br/>
and after years of regular school we often have forgotten what our own <br/>
interests and talents really are. Many of us-kids and adults-have gotten so <br/>
accustomed to a curriculum and a scope and sequence that we don&#39;t see the <br/>
value in things that we do because we love them-they are playing, or <br/>
hobbies, not schoolwork. But if you take the plunge and follow your <br/>
interests without regard to a school mind set you will see the learning that <br/>
just happens. And one thing leads naturally into another-a free workshop at <br/>
Home Depot on building a bird house can lead to a whole new interest in <br/>
backyard birdwatching, then on to migratory patterns, habitat, landscaping, <br/>
weather, wetlands...see how it all does sound schooly now?! Maybe that won&#39;t <br/>
happen with one class, but the next one may ignite a life long passion, so <br/>
just keep trying out new things and have fun together.<br/>

to do more than lay in bed watching TV.............<br/>
Hm....I am wating for her to get bored enough to say &quot;lets do school&quot; <br/>
Hmmmmm..... I dont really know what I am waiting for.  I am waiting <br/>
