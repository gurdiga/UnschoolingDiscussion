<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537851270">I just wanted to thank everyone for some great discussions over the last<br/>
week or so. The past couple of months have been hard. I&#39;ve been feeling<br/>
burnt out and finding myself cleaning up after the kids and not really<br/>
spending enough time making the messes with them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The discussions about cleaning, rules versus principles, and food have been<br/>
just what I needed. I think it was Julie. S who posted these wonderful words<br/>
&quot;you are free to live your life as you see fit as long as you are not<br/>
causing harm to others&quot;. Now that&#39;s someting to live by. That&#39;s a lot of<br/>
freedom for my kids but not at anyone&#39;s expense.<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I  have had a wonderful week together. Grocery shopping was<br/>
actually fun! The kids went to bed all at different times tonight and they<br/>
were so happy and peaceful and loving. Mia ( 4 yrs) told me as we were<br/>
having a cuddle, &quot;you are so beautiful Mum, you&#39;re so precious to me&quot; It was<br/>
really sweet to hear my words to her given back to me. What a gift!! Jess<br/>
told me he loved the way I had cleaned his room and that he had had a great<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my husband read a post of Deb&#39;s and one of Ren&#39;s  from Unschooling 101<br/>
about housework and unschooling and they really touched  him. He has printed<br/>
them out to keep close by. After reading them, he helped me out with some<br/>
housework that needed doing while the kids played.<br/>
<br/>
We also had heaps of fun cleaning our floors (thanks Lyle!!!). The whole<br/>
family donned thick socks and &quot;skate mopped&quot; the floor. We moved the table<br/>
and chairs out of the room so we had a huge area to skate around on and we<br/>
had a blast. My mother, brother and sister arrived just as we began. 5<br/>
minutes later Kate was asking for socks and ten minutes after that my mum<br/>
(60 this year) was zooming around with us! The floor looks fantastic and the<br/>
kids are looking forward to the time it needs to be cleaned again.<br/>
<br/>
This list is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
