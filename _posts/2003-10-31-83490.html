<div id="ygrps-yiv-644992678">&lt;&lt;Well, adults don&#39;t usually....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But they do.  My dh is a volunteer fireman so we have a scanner running and<br/>
hear the calls for the sheriff&#39;s office.  Several times a day in our small<br/>
little rural area, someone is throwing a tantrum, cursing, fighting, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I witnessed a doosie in Walmart last Christmas.  Man and woman screaming<br/>
through Walmart at no one really in particular it seemed &quot;This is going to<br/>
f*** everything up!  Do you know how f***ing crazy she is going to make my<br/>
life?  Are any of you married? F***!  Shut the f*** up!!&quot;  A small crowd had<br/>
gathered watching this spectacle in bafflement and all I could think to do<br/>
was lean over to the man next to me and whisper &quot;Merry f***ing Christmas&quot;.<br/>
He laughed, I laughed and we walked away.<br/>
<br/>
Adults do powerplays with each other all the time.  They tease about things<br/>
until way,way after they are funny.  We don&#39;t hit them without threat of<br/>
incarceration.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi Nancy - Is there anything in that movie that would upset a sensitive<br/>
&gt; &gt; viewer?   Rowan, who&#39;s six, gets very upset if a character goes through<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; &gt; kind of emotional trauma, and I&#39;ve been trying to find someone who&#39;s<br/>
seen<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; who I could ask.  Thanks  ~Rue<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; These sites don&#39;t have a wide variety of movies, but they are fairly<br/>
&gt; accurate about content.  Neither site has the movie you are concerned<br/>
with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This site:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.family-movie-review.com">http://www.family-movie-review.com</a><br/>
&gt; has vague reviews without specifics about language, violence, content,<br/>
etc.<br/>
&gt; It has this movie, but doesn&#39;t say anything about emotional trauma.  From<br/>
&gt; the general story line though, I personally would not be interested in<br/>
&gt; watching it (sounds way too sad).<br/>

&gt; Do you think that people who learn with a more whole language approach<br/>
&gt; to reading and writing are better spellers than those who learn phonics?<br/>
&gt;  I learned whole language and am a pretty good speller.  My husband is a<br/>
&gt; bit younger and was in a different district and learned phonics.  He&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; horrible speller.  Many of the kids I meet who have spelling issues were<br/>
&gt; taught to learn to read phonetically.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I love the spellchecker because, being from Australia, some words simply<br/>
&gt; are spelled differently here (or there depending on your POV). Of course<br/>
&gt; the limitation is that if a word is spelled wrongly in context, but is<br/>
&gt; still a real word, the checker misses it. The only time misspelling<br/>
&gt; bothers me in casual writing is when the meaning becomes unclear, or<br/>
&gt; causes me to have to puzzle it out - but hey! Shit happens and when I<br/>
&gt; say &quot;bothers&quot; I mean bugs me for two seconds and then I move on. My only<br/>
&gt; pet peeve is &quot;Lose&quot; and &quot;Loose&quot; which seem to be used interchangeably,<br/>
&gt; and do sometimes alter meaning considerably. For example: &quot;I lose my son<br/>
&gt; to computer games&quot; vs &quot;I loose my son to computer games&quot;. The former<br/>
&gt; could be resentful, the latter a joyous and poetical expression of<br/>
&gt; freedom for the son.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sandra&#39;s husband became a better speller.  Are there many more out<br/>
there who have learned this ability?  Both my husband and I were just born<br/>
with it and I have yet to meet a person who is a good speller and wasn&#39;t<br/>
born to it. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son (14) is improving on his spelling.  Spelling tests in school always<br/>
frustrated him.  No matter how hard/long he&#39;d study, he&#39;d still be lucky to<br/>
earn a passing grade. He wouldn&#39;t remember how to spell those words the next<br/>
week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The ONLY thing (and we tried lots of things) that&#39;s worked for him is to<br/>
learn the words as he uses them.  Not an arbitrary set that he&#39;s supposed to<br/>
know.  He plays Tribes online and frequently asks how to spell whatever word<br/>
he&#39;s having trouble with.  After four or fives times of my spelling it for<br/>
him, he owns the word.  His writing of stories has also provided painless<br/>
practice and improvement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Andy told me just the other day that spelling is *much* easier when<br/>
typing.  Handwriting just adds enough to the mix to cause the frustration.<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s why the spelling tests were so traumatic.<br/>

&gt; It may.  I don&#39;t want to give it away, but it has the legend of the selkie<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; it (Irish/Scottish story of woman/man who can turn from a seal into a<br/>
human<br/>
&gt; and back again) so someone in the story has to deal with this happening.<br/>
Also,<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a scene where a child is washed out to sea (it turns out good<br/>
later<br/>
&gt; though) that is particularly sad/scary.  Maybe not the best for a<br/>
sensitive<br/>
&gt; young one.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Let&#39;s not forget that different people have different ideas of<br/>
&gt; abuse.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; I called this abuse today. I also got moderated on that list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A Mom was pointing out that her children needed work ethic and so on. Her<br/>
&gt; example was: my child wanted an animal so we bought a bird. After a few<br/>
days he<br/>
&gt; was not feeding the bird so what was I to do? She said &quot;Do I one tell him<br/>
its<br/>
&gt; ok and let the bird die? or two (what she did) Do I tell him he doesn&#39;t<br/>
eat<br/>
&gt; until the bird is fed?<br/>
&gt; To that I replied well one I do hope you are not serious and two it is<br/>
&gt; considered parental abuse to withhold food from a child.  Lastly feed the<br/>
darn bid<br/>
&gt; yourself.<br/>
&gt; Abuse takes many shapes. I dont know this Mom so I dont know how long she<br/>
&gt; withheld food but she came back to say she disagreed.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m surprised that Ebert found the plot too complicated. Or that he<br/>
&gt; complained about stylized camera work that was so evidently deliberate<br/>
&gt; and planned. A tidbit about the film is that the actor portraying Fran&#39;s<br/>
&gt; father was the Spanish National flamenco champion or some similar title.<br/>
&gt; His dancing is cool. The film is full of some of the grand actors of<br/>
&gt; their generation in Australia. I once designed costumes for a play with<br/>
&gt; Pat Thomson. She was a wonderful raconteur and world traveler,<br/>
&gt; entertaining all of us during rehearsals, as well as really good in the<br/>
&gt; show. Paul Mercurio is the son of a well known (Australian) character<br/>
&gt; actor Gus Mercurio. When I was working wardrobe on &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;<br/>
&gt; in Sydney in the early eighties, it was rumored that Paul had been<br/>
&gt; slated to take over the part of the son (the &quot;juvenile&quot; as it is called<br/>
&gt; in musical theater), which was played by Gerry Sont (an old friend of<br/>
&gt; mine from high school, now a soap star in Australia). It didn&#39;t happen<br/>
&gt; at the time, although the dancing required for that particular character<br/>
&gt; was incidental, unlike the Cagelles, who had some pretty big and fancy<br/>
&gt; dancing.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; Let&#39;s not forget that different people have different ideas of<br/>
&gt; abuse.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Only regarding children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No one would consider it acceptable if I spanked, yanked or swatted an<br/>
&gt; elderly parent in my care.<br/>
&gt; No one would think it was ok if I spanked or swatted a coworker, doctor,<br/>
&gt; teacher, or bus driver if they were not behaving the way I liked.<br/>
&gt; No one would think it was ok if a man turned his wife over his knee in<br/>
&gt; Wal-mart and let her have it.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s abuse.  But the littlest people can get that treatment and we&#39;re<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was well said, and I&#39;d like to follow up on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I should say that I have spanked in the past, but it was never something I<br/>
&gt; felt good about; I always knew that if I&#39;d gotten to spanking, I&#39;d<br/>
failed --<br/>
&gt; failed to come up with a better solution to the &quot;problem&quot; (and I now<br/>
realize I<br/>
&gt; was sometimes making problems where there weren&#39;t any by expecting certain<br/>
&gt; behaviors), failed to control my own temper, failed to nurture myself and<br/>
my son so<br/>
&gt; that we could both have what we needed.  There was always a disconnect --<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; felt horrible about what I&#39;d done, but much of society seemed to think it<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; okay, seemed to think that it was my right to do so as a parent.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; very confused up until now, to be honest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With that said, the response I could hear others making to Deb&#39;s comment<br/>
&gt; about how we wouldn&#39;t treat adults that way:  &quot;Well,  adults don&#39;t usually<br/>
refuse<br/>
&gt; to get dressed; they don&#39;t throw tantrums in public.  Adults don&#39;t usually<br/>
&gt; hide under the clothes racks in Wal-mart and scare everyone by not coming<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; when called.  Adults don&#39;t repeatedly run out in front of cars and so<br/>
don&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; to be taught a sharp lesson for their own safety.  That&#39;s why we treat<br/>
kids<br/>
&gt; differently.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have some ideas about the response to this, but I&#39;d love to hear<br/>
others&#39;.<br/>
&gt; TIA.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Peace,<br/>
&gt; Amy<br/>

Probably the worst they&#39;d get would be a recommendation that they take a <br/>
parenting class.  MAYBE a court-ordered parenting class.  I don&#39;t think anyone <br/>

  But they do.  My dh is a volunteer fireman so we have a scanner running and<br/>
  hear the calls for the sheriff&#39;s office.  Several times a day in our small<br/>

  I witnessed a doosie in Walmart last Christmas.  Man and woman screaming<br/>

  gathered watching this spectacle in bafflement and all I could think to do<br/>
  was lean over to the man next to me and whisper &quot;Merry f***ing Christmas&quot;.<br/>
  He laughed, I laughed and we walked away.<br/>

  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Hi Nancy - Is there anything in that movie that would upset a sensitive<br/>
  &gt; &gt; viewer?   Rowan, who&#39;s six, gets very upset if a character goes through<br/>
  &gt; any<br/>
  &gt; &gt; kind of emotional trauma, and I&#39;ve been trying to find someone who&#39;s<br/>
  seen<br/>
  &gt; it<br/>
  &gt; &gt; who I could ask.  Thanks  ~Rue<br/>
  &gt;<br/>

  &gt; These sites don&#39;t have a wide variety of movies, but they are fairly<br/>
  &gt; accurate about content.  Neither site has the movie you are concerned<br/>
  with.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; This site:<br/>
  &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.family-movie-review.com">http://www.family-movie-review.com</a><br/>
  &gt; has vague reviews without specifics about language, violence, content,<br/>
  etc.<br/>
  &gt; It has this movie, but doesn&#39;t say anything about emotional trauma.  From<br/>
  &gt; the general story line though, I personally would not be interested in<br/>
  &gt; watching it (sounds way too sad).<br/>

  &gt; Do you think that people who learn with a more whole language approach<br/>
  &gt; to reading and writing are better spellers than those who learn phonics?<br/>
  &gt;  I learned whole language and am a pretty good speller.  My husband is a<br/>
  &gt; bit younger and was in a different district and learned phonics.  He&#39;s a<br/>
  &gt; horrible speller.  Many of the kids I meet who have spelling issues were<br/>
  &gt; taught to learn to read phonetically.<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I love the spellchecker because, being from Australia, some words simply<br/>
  &gt; are spelled differently here (or there depending on your POV). Of course<br/>
  &gt; the limitation is that if a word is spelled wrongly in context, but is<br/>
  &gt; still a real word, the checker misses it. The only time misspelling<br/>
  &gt; bothers me in casual writing is when the meaning becomes unclear, or<br/>
  &gt; causes me to have to puzzle it out - but hey! Shit happens and when I<br/>
  &gt; say &quot;bothers&quot; I mean bugs me for two seconds and then I move on. My only<br/>
  &gt; pet peeve is &quot;Lose&quot; and &quot;Loose&quot; which seem to be used interchangeably,<br/>
  &gt; and do sometimes alter meaning considerably. For example: &quot;I lose my son<br/>
  &gt; to computer games&quot; vs &quot;I loose my son to computer games&quot;. The former<br/>
  &gt; could be resentful, the latter a joyous and poetical expression of<br/>
  &gt; freedom for the son.<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sandra&#39;s husband became a better speller.  Are there many more out<br/>
  there who have learned this ability?  Both my husband and I were just born<br/>
  with it and I have yet to meet a person who is a good speller and wasn&#39;t<br/>
  born to it. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; My son (14) is improving on his spelling.  Spelling tests in school always<br/>
  frustrated him.  No matter how hard/long he&#39;d study, he&#39;d still be lucky to<br/>
  earn a passing grade. He wouldn&#39;t remember how to spell those words the next<br/>
  week.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; The ONLY thing (and we tried lots of things) that&#39;s worked for him is to<br/>
  learn the words as he uses them.  Not an arbitrary set that he&#39;s supposed to<br/>
  know.  He plays Tribes online and frequently asks how to spell whatever word<br/>
  he&#39;s having trouble with.  After four or fives times of my spelling it for<br/>
  him, he owns the word.  His writing of stories has also provided painless<br/>
  practice and improvement.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Andy told me just the other day that spelling is *much* easier when<br/>
  typing.  Handwriting just adds enough to the mix to cause the frustration.<br/>
  Maybe that&#39;s why the spelling tests were so traumatic.<br/>

  &gt; It may.  I don&#39;t want to give it away, but it has the legend of the selkie<br/>
  in<br/>
  &gt; it (Irish/Scottish story of woman/man who can turn from a seal into a<br/>
  human<br/>
  &gt; and back again) so someone in the story has to deal with this happening.<br/>
  Also,<br/>
  &gt; there&#39;s a scene where a child is washed out to sea (it turns out good<br/>
  later<br/>
  &gt; though) that is particularly sad/scary.  Maybe not the best for a<br/>
  sensitive<br/>
  &gt; young one.<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &lt;&lt; Let&#39;s not forget that different people have different ideas of<br/>
  &gt; abuse.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt; I called this abuse today. I also got moderated on that list.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; A Mom was pointing out that her children needed work ethic and so on. Her<br/>
  &gt; example was: my child wanted an animal so we bought a bird. After a few<br/>
  days he<br/>
  &gt; was not feeding the bird so what was I to do? She said &quot;Do I one tell him<br/>
  its<br/>
  &gt; ok and let the bird die? or two (what she did) Do I tell him he doesn&#39;t<br/>
  eat<br/>
  &gt; until the bird is fed?<br/>
  &gt; To that I replied well one I do hope you are not serious and two it is<br/>
  &gt; considered parental abuse to withhold food from a child.  Lastly feed the<br/>
  darn bid<br/>
  &gt; yourself.<br/>
  &gt; Abuse takes many shapes. I dont know this Mom so I dont know how long she<br/>
  &gt; withheld food but she came back to say she disagreed.<br/>

  &gt; I&#39;m surprised that Ebert found the plot too complicated. Or that he<br/>
  &gt; complained about stylized camera work that was so evidently deliberate<br/>
  &gt; and planned. A tidbit about the film is that the actor portraying Fran&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; father was the Spanish National flamenco champion or some similar title.<br/>
  &gt; His dancing is cool. The film is full of some of the grand actors of<br/>
  &gt; their generation in Australia. I once designed costumes for a play with<br/>
  &gt; Pat Thomson. She was a wonderful raconteur and world traveler,<br/>
  &gt; entertaining all of us during rehearsals, as well as really good in the<br/>
  &gt; show. Paul Mercurio is the son of a well known (Australian) character<br/>
  &gt; actor Gus Mercurio. When I was working wardrobe on &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;<br/>
  &gt; in Sydney in the early eighties, it was rumored that Paul had been<br/>
  &gt; slated to take over the part of the son (the &quot;juvenile&quot; as it is called<br/>
  &gt; in musical theater), which was played by Gerry Sont (an old friend of<br/>
  &gt; mine from high school, now a soap star in Australia). It didn&#39;t happen<br/>
  &gt; at the time, although the dancing required for that particular character<br/>
  &gt; was incidental, unlike the Cagelles, who had some pretty big and fancy<br/>
  &gt; dancing.<br/>

  &gt; This was well said, and I&#39;d like to follow up on it.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I should say that I have spanked in the past, but it was never something I<br/>
  &gt; felt good about; I always knew that if I&#39;d gotten to spanking, I&#39;d<br/>
  failed --<br/>
  &gt; failed to come up with a better solution to the &quot;problem&quot; (and I now<br/>
  realize I<br/>
  &gt; was sometimes making problems where there weren&#39;t any by expecting certain<br/>
  &gt; behaviors), failed to control my own temper, failed to nurture myself and<br/>
  my son so<br/>
  &gt; that we could both have what we needed.  There was always a disconnect --<br/>
  I<br/>
  &gt; felt horrible about what I&#39;d done, but much of society seemed to think it<br/>
  was<br/>
  &gt; okay, seemed to think that it was my right to do so as a parent.  I&#39;ve<br/>
  been<br/>
  &gt; very confused up until now, to be honest.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; With that said, the response I could hear others making to Deb&#39;s comment<br/>
  &gt; about how we wouldn&#39;t treat adults that way:  &quot;Well,  adults don&#39;t usually<br/>
  refuse<br/>
  &gt; to get dressed; they don&#39;t throw tantrums in public.  Adults don&#39;t usually<br/>
  &gt; hide under the clothes racks in Wal-mart and scare everyone by not coming<br/>
  out<br/>
  &gt; when called.  Adults don&#39;t repeatedly run out in front of cars and so<br/>
  don&#39;t need<br/>
  &gt; to be taught a sharp lesson for their own safety.  That&#39;s why we treat<br/>
  kids<br/>
  &gt; differently.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I have some ideas about the response to this, but I&#39;d love to hear<br/>
  others&#39;.<br/>
  &gt; TIA.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Peace,<br/>
  &gt; Amy<br/>

&lt;&lt; Just wondering, what do you guys do if you observe abusive behavior in <br/>
public?  Where is that line between intervening and not intervening, and if you <br/>
do intervene, what do you do or say? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The other day Holly and I were in Savers near the toys, and a young woman <br/>
(19-22 range?) was walking with a little girl, very little.  20 months?  2 yrs?   <br/>
<br/>
The little girl had a pony tail way up high, 2&quot; of topknot, and the woman <br/>
said very sharply &quot;COME HERE&quot; and pulled her by that hair.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;DON&#39;T pull her hair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The woman  looked around, had misunderstood me, and smiled kind of and said <br/>
&quot;I didn&#39;t do it&quot; (meaning, it seemed, put her hair up--I think she thought I <br/>
had said something about the little girl&#39;s hairdo and was saying someone else <br/>
had done it).   I shook my head impatiently and said, &quot;Don&#39;t pull her hair.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So then she held her hand and talked to her really nicely, and when they got <br/>
to the cart where an older woman (40&#39;s) and a little boy (5ish) were, <br/>
everybody was all sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Holly figured it was the baby&#39;s aunt or something, not her mom.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t even think before I said it.  It wasn&#39;t a negotiable thing for me.<br/>
<br/>
I told Holly I&#39;ll probably be shot some day for defending some stranger kid <br/>
and she just shrugged and smiled.<br/>

 We visit Wally&#39;s several times a week and I often see parents having a melt <br/>
down.  I am shocked at how many parents loose it and in public. I often see <br/>
parents walking out the door doing the shake, smack, nag shake thing. Sometimes <br/>
I have said &quot;what a bitch&quot; in passing and other times I say HEY knock that <br/>
off!  Sometimes a look is all it takes. What bothers me is if they do it in <br/>
public what is happening at home? <br/>
<br/>
When I was 21-22 and a single Mom I lived in a 10 building small housing <br/>
project. There was a rough looking family with a son that had ADD and some other <br/>
concerns (so the parents said). I would be at the clothes line and would hear <br/>
bang,slap,slap,slap Ouch no Mommy no! followed by more slaps. I wasn&#39;t positive <br/>
of what was happening and didn&#39;t want to jump the gun so when I herd it again <br/>
I walked up to their door.  After talking to the Mom I walked back to my <br/>
apartment and called and reported them. <br/>
<br/>
I saw her at Wally&#39;s (no wonder money is tight) last month. She told me they <br/>
finally took him away after he walked into court with shorts and dirty clothes <br/>
during the winter. He is 15 now.  So at least ten years of abuse went by and <br/>
no one did anything. She told me he needed to go she couldn&#39;t handle him. I <br/>
was sick listening to her. She takes no responsibility for what she has done to <br/>
him. <br/>

Sorry to post on this again but this has been a topic here several times <br/>
lately.<br/>
<br/>
I was discussing beginning a local unschooling group with a friend who <br/>
Homeschools.  I had said that I didn&#39;t want to attract those who trad HS or that <br/>
spanked esp ones who spank at the group as I would ask them to leave. I have been <br/>
to groups like this. <br/>
My friend said wait... Who are you to decide if that is ok? Who are you to <br/>
determine if it crosses the line of abuse? Their family is Christian and spanks <br/>
as they say that the bible says so.  I think I rocked the boat a bit, I think <br/>
I knew I was.<br/>
She had a point but I still disagree. You dont spank a child one and you dont <br/>
spank because they are fussing and you dont want to hear it. How is that <br/>
biblical?<br/>

that&#39;s O.K.!  Just like you get to decide who can be at your house.  If they<br/>
violate the rules of your home, you have the right to ask them to leave.  If<br/>
they want a home-schoolers spanking group, let them start their own!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my hot-head response, but it would probably be more beneficial to let<br/>
them stay, just tell them that spanking isn&#39;t allowed there.  They might<br/>
stay and learn something.<br/>

<br/>
Today at Walmart the kids, Darin, and I were picking up some extra candy and <br/>
I needed cooking oil too. In that aisle a mom and dad and little boy were <br/>
standing where I needed to be and the boy was crying with his hands up over his <br/>
head. The mom was ignoring it and the dad was saying to the boy, using that <br/>
reverse psychology crap; &quot;Keep crying! Keep crying! Why don&#39;t you act like a <br/>
spoiled brat instead of a little boy. That would be a good idea, be a brat.&quot; and <br/>
the little boy was saying; &quot;I am a little boy! I&#39;m not a brat! Don&#39;t call me <br/>
that!&quot; This went on and on and the family wasn&#39;t moving and I was getting more <br/>
and more frustrated and hurting for the boy because this was a scene right out <br/>
of my childhood. (and I really just wanted my oil and to get out of the store.) <br/>
So when I realized that the boy with his hands over his head was there <br/>
because he knew a smack on the head was imminent and I saw the dad raise his hand <br/>
way up over his own head, I didn&#39;t think, I just grabbed his hand and said, You <br/>
will NOT hit this child, and you will stop berating him. Everyone in the aisle <br/>
was watching and another woman came up and said; &quot;You have to be good and <br/>
gentle and nice to children.&quot; Then she dialed her cell phone and at the same time <br/>
handed him a card. She was from SRS. &lt;g&gt; I think that family might still be <br/>
down at the police station. <br/>
<br/>
Usually, I say things like, Be nice or Stop, but today I don&#39;t know what came <br/>
over me. I think because kids here are out of school for parent teacher <br/>
conferences and it is Halloween so kids are excited, and parents are more stressed <br/>
than usual; I saw a bad situation that was about to turn ugly bad nasty. This <br/>
dad was truly about to swing his hand hard onto his child&#39;s head. I&#39;ve seen <br/>
parents swat kids on the butt, I&#39;ve seen parents smack hands and grab arms hard <br/>
and yank, I&#39;ve seen parents pinch that soft spot on the back of kid&#39;s arms and <br/>
squeeze children&#39;s necks, but this guy was about to make a head shot that <br/>
would have rattled the boy&#39;s brains and left him with a headache from hell. I was <br/>
crying as we left the store and Darin who usually tells me to mind my own <br/>
business just hugged me and Moly and Jack were solemn and quiet all the way home. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my nasty story and it happened today and I am glad to have this group <br/>
to vent it to. <br/>

  Today at Walmart the kids, Darin, and I were picking up some extra candy and <br/>
  I needed cooking oil too. In that aisle a mom and dad and little boy were <br/>
  standing where I needed to be and the boy was crying with his hands up over his <br/>
  head. The mom was ignoring it and the dad was saying to the boy, using that <br/>
  reverse psychology crap; &quot;Keep crying! Keep crying! Why don&#39;t you act like a <br/>
  spoiled brat instead of a little boy. That would be a good idea, be a brat.&quot; and <br/>
  the little boy was saying; &quot;I am a little boy! I&#39;m not a brat! Don&#39;t call me <br/>
  that!&quot; This went on and on and the family wasn&#39;t moving and I was getting more <br/>
  and more frustrated and hurting for the boy because this was a scene right out <br/>
  of my childhood. (and I really just wanted my oil and to get out of the store.) <br/>
  So when I realized that the boy with his hands over his head was there <br/>
  because he knew a smack on the head was imminent and I saw the dad raise his hand <br/>
  way up over his own head, I didn&#39;t think, I just grabbed his hand and said, You <br/>
  will NOT hit this child, and you will stop berating him. Everyone in the aisle <br/>
  was watching and another woman came up and said; &quot;You have to be good and <br/>
  gentle and nice to children.&quot; Then she dialed her cell phone and at the same time <br/>
  handed him a card. She was from SRS. &lt;g&gt; I think that family might still be <br/>
  down at the police station. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447637726">I agree about not letting parents abuse kids, yet I wonder where the <br/>
line is between speaking your mind and keeping your mouth shut.  I <br/>
know how annoyed I get when people say stuff about unschoolers being <br/>
neglectful.  I had a friend who was reported to social services, and <br/>
one of the complaints was, &quot;Those kids are never in school&quot;.  She had <br/>
been on bed rest with a difficult pregnancy and her house got really <br/>
messy, and she had to live with a social service nightmare that <br/>
traumatized her and her kids.  Her kids had to worry about being <br/>
taken away from mommy and daddy. :(  So maybe sometimes we do more <br/>
harm by speaking our minds?<br/>

Kirby has an over-calm mode nowadays.  TOTALLY slow and laid back.<br/>

The other day Holly just SCREECHED and I thought she had poked herself in the <br/>
eye or something but she had bitten the inside of her cheek.  It sounded like <br/>
she was dying.  She was really scared.   I was trying to comfort her and <br/>
figure out what to do.  (You want ice?  Ice water? Popsicle?  To lie down?)   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby sauntered in all the way around so he was facing her straight on and <br/>
said at about Joh-Wayne speed:  &quot;I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s going to feel any better <br/>
if you don&#39;t breathe.&quot;<br/>

I had forgotten my own best suggestion! Once in a while, though, ice water <br/>
trumps breathing.<br/>

That&#39;s my hot-head response, but it would probably be more beneficial to let<br/>
them stay, just tell them that spanking isn&#39;t allowed there. <br/>
Someone in our LLL babysitting co-op swatted her younger son (he was three or <br/>
four) once at a meeting.  A couple of the mos were willing to pretend they <br/>
didn&#39;t see it. Others wanted me to talk to her also I did.   The thing I said <br/>
that I could best stand by was that I didn&#39;t want my kids to be around that kind <br/>
of behavior and if she would do that at a meeting with everyone else in the <br/>
room I was guessing it might be worse other times.<br/>
<br/>
So she hated me. (It was embarrassment, I think.)  but she also quit spanking <br/>
as far as any of us knew, afterwards.<br/>

I just can&#39;t imagine treating another person the way this mother treated her child.  How do you suppose she was treated when she was a child?  <br/>

Also, I&#39;ve heard other people say that they approach the parent and ask if there&#39;s anything they can do to help.  Anyone have any luck with this?  (Maybe the parent might think this is condescending?)<br/>

<br/>
  &lt;&lt; Just wondering, what do you guys do if you observe abusive behavior in <br/>
  public?  Where is that line between intervening and not intervening, and if <br/>
  you <br/>
  do intervene, what do you do or say? &gt;&gt;<br/>
  We visit Wally&#39;s several times a week and I often see parents having a melt <br/>
  down.  I am shocked at how many parents loose it and in public. I often see <br/>
  parents walking out the door doing the shake, smack, nag shake thing. Sometimes <br/>
  I have said &quot;what a bitch&quot; in passing and other times I say HEY knock that <br/>
  off!  Sometimes a look is all it takes. What bothers me is if they do it in <br/>
  public what is happening at home? <br/>
<br/>
  When I was 21-22 and a single Mom I lived in a 10 building small housing <br/>
  project. There was a rough looking family with a son that had ADD and some other <br/>
  concerns (so the parents said). I would be at the clothes line and would hear <br/>
  bang,slap,slap,slap Ouch no Mommy no! followed by more slaps. I wasn&#39;t positive <br/>
  of what was happening and didn&#39;t want to jump the gun so when I herd it again <br/>
  I walked up to their door.  After talking to the Mom I walked back to my <br/>
  apartment and called and reported them. <br/>
<br/>
  I saw her at Wally&#39;s (no wonder money is tight) last month. She told me they <br/>
  finally took him away after he walked into court with shorts and dirty clothes <br/>
  during the winter. He is 15 now.  So at least ten years of abuse went by and <br/>
  no one did anything. She told me he needed to go she couldn&#39;t handle him. I <br/>
  was sick listening to her. She takes no responsibility for what she has done to <br/>
  him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582536143">&lt;&lt;I was discussing beginning a local unschooling group with a friend who <br/>
Homeschools.  I had said that I didn&#39;t want to attract those who trad HS or that spanked esp ones who spank at the group as I would ask them to leave. I have been to groups like this. <br/>
My friend said wait... Who are you to decide if that is ok? Who are you to <br/>
determine if it crosses the line of abuse? Their family is Christian and spanks as they say that the bible says so.  I think I rocked the boat a bit, I think I knew I was.<br/>
She had a point but I still disagree. You dont spank a child one and you dont spank because they are fussing and you dont want to hear it. How is that biblical?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could spank her at one of the meetings and see how she reacts?  :)<br/>

You can&#39;t spank people you don&#39;t own.<br/>
<br/>
I think spanking is worse in the southern U.S. because they used to be able <br/>
to own other people and now they can&#39;t.  Or now they&#39;ve transferred to <br/>
children.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m stunned beyond breathing for a second by what my brother-in-law <br/>
(married into South Carolina) says and does regarding his two boys who are <br/>
about Kirby and Marty&#39;s age.    A family here in town where the dad&#39;s from North <br/>
Carolina and Houston before here has big problems with the dad&#39;s <br/>
inflexibility and demands (and they&#39;re of formerly-owned lines, which makes it worse, and <br/>
in Atwon Fisher a certain book is named and the mom said &quot;We have that book,&quot; <br/>
and I said &quot;Put it out on the coffee table!&quot;).  A <br/>
military-several-generations-both-sides family I know from Alabama (they came here a while and went back <br/>
there) withheld birthday cake from every kid at a six-yr-old&#39;s party until they <br/>
(each of them) finished their celery and carrot sticks.  My kids too!    And <br/>
their kids were crazy and sneaky and loud until the parents&#39; faces appeared <br/>
and then they were deflated &quot;yes sir&quot; zombies.<br/>
<br/>
Having seen how ugly that can be, I try to just turn my back on it and stand <br/>
between my kids and &quot;it.&quot;<br/>

Holly is GREAT at that, and lately she has taken to saying to me without <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Asking if I can help is a much more natural response for me than saying <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t&quot; to the parent.   That&#39;s just my personality -- I&#39;m not saying this solution <br/>
is right for all people in all situations.  If I can, I want to use the <br/>
opportunity to show the parent a way to stop (for the kid&#39;s sake and also for their <br/>
own sake).  <br/>
<br/>
When I ask if I can help, I mean just that -- maybe I can help take the <br/>
stress out of the situation.  Sometimes I can see that an parent is feeling pulled <br/>
too many ways at once (trying to get shopping done, trying to stop the whining <br/>
of the child, worrying about what they can afford).  I&#39;ve been there, and <br/>
I&#39;ve felt frazzled by it -- I&#39;ve had to work hard to control myself from yelling. <br/>
 If I can entertain the child for a few minutes so the parent can check the <br/>
prices on the meat and figure out which one she can afford, then my offer of <br/>
help may work.  It may also model that she can ask for help in similar <br/>
situations, or that she can try different approaches with her child to make the <br/>
situation better.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of a &quot;It takes a village&quot; approach (though not the Hilary Clinton <br/>
version, where the government is the village).  I had to learn these skills -- <br/>
I think other parents can learn them, too.  I realize that my interaction with <br/>
them will not entirely change their parenting style, but it may be a <br/>
beginning.  I can hope so, anyway.<br/>

<br/>
When my 14yo ds was a few months old, we lived next door to a Portuguese <br/>
family - a very extended family (and no, I don&#39;t know how they fit everyone <br/>
in the house.) Well, one night, my 3 month old ds was upset and <br/>
S-C-R-E-A-M-E-D for at least 5 or 6 hours straight - it seemed like it was <br/>
all night.  Jiggling him didn&#39;t help.  Singing didn&#39;t help.  Nursing didn&#39;t <br/>
help.  New nappies didn&#39;t help.  Walkies didn&#39;t help.  &#39;Riding&#39; on the <br/>
drier didn&#39;t help.  Nothing, but sustained, never-ending screaming.  Why <br/>
didn&#39;t I have a happy baby?  Why couldn&#39;t I get him to stop crying?!!  I <br/>
became more and more frazzled wondering what the neighbors were thinking - <br/>
was I beating him?  neglecting him?  That I was a bad mommy &#39;cause he <br/>
wasn&#39;t a quiet perfect baby?  When was there going to be a knock on the <br/>
door telling me to shut that kid up? It was 2 or 3 in the morning, after <br/>
all, with at least a dozen people trying to sleep just the other side of <br/>
ds&#39;s window!  I felt awful (and really tired, cranky and depressed) the <br/>
following morning when the 80+ year old Grandma of this Portuguese family <br/>
made a beeline for us on the sidewalk and said, &quot;Oh, so this must the <br/>
little Opera singer I heard through my window last night.  He sang the most <br/>
beautiful arias.  What a handsome and strong baby!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I melted.<br/>
<br/>
So now, when ever I see a mum who&#39;s about to fry over her screaming kid, I <br/>
grin and tell her that her child is a beautiful Opera singer, and how <br/>
strong and handsome!  Not every mother gets a child with such healthy lungs!<br/>
<br/>
On a slightly un-related note, when there&#39;s a child throwing a fit (without <br/>
screaming), I catch the parent&#39;s eye, give a conspiratorial look and say, <br/>
&quot;I remember those days...  Sometimes you just want to say, &quot;Some people&#39;s <br/>
children!&quot;, eh?  Ah, but I miss them being little like that.  How old is <br/>
she?&quot;  &quot;Having a tough day, is she?&quot;  (compliments follow)  Usually, the <br/>
harried parent&#39;s more worried about what other folks in the store are <br/>
thinking than about what the kid needs to calm down.  (Plus, it tends to <br/>
calm down the other shoppers standing nearby.)<br/>
<br/>
Of course, both of these things are &#39;pre-blow-up&#39; and would probably be <br/>
useless after a parent&#39;s already lost it.<br/>
