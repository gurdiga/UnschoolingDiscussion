&gt;&gt; I have to echo this statement and also say thanks to Loren! Now all I am<br/>
&gt;&gt; wondering is how to convince Loren to come live with me in Kansas! &lt;beg&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; ~Nancy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Um, you mean in the same town?  Not your house, I hope.  Don&#39;t get me in<br/>
&gt; trouble here.<br/>
&gt; But actually it&#39;s a nice offer.  It makes me think of using this list<br/>
&gt; and others to make contacts for traveling in the future.  I dream of taking<br/>
&gt; vacations when my kids are older and staying at other homeschooler&#39;s homes<br/>
&gt; instead of in motels.  You put us up for the night and we&#39;ll teach you<br/>
&gt; something neat if you want, or just be good company.  When my kids are in<br/>
&gt; their early teens, I want my family to go on a bicycle trip, and this would<br/>
&gt; be a great way to meet people.<br/>
&gt; I live in Tacoma WA.  We&#39;re a mile or so from Puget Sound and Mt.<br/>
&gt; Rainier and the Olympics are not far.  We have only one extra bed, but plenty<br/>
&gt; of floor space and a back yard suitable for a tent or two.  Come and visit<br/>
&gt; sometime.  (Hmm, should I ask my wife about this first?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Loren<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great idea! Remember the Growing Without Schooling address list -- families<br/>
who were willing to host had *H* after their names. Cassidy & I took several<br/>
trips across US, Canada & England, staying with families we contacted<br/>
through GWS and another list called Homeschooler Travel Network, I think.<br/>
It&#39;s a great way to travel. We&#39;ve also hosted homeschooling travelers.<br/>
