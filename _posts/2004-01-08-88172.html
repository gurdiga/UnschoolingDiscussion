I did this.<br/>
<br/>
We were unschooling but it was before mindful parenting and we had <br/>
lots of rules on food, chores, bedtime, and TV/video watching. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Always had to be sure my children would get MY view  (which was <br/>
usually negative towards the show for some good-to-me reason)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son Alex - at 18 - is still reluctant to watch anything with me. <br/>
(we switched to mindful parenting about 2 years ago but that wasn&#39;t <br/>
soon enough to repair the damage caused by all those years of me <br/>
making sure he didn&#39;t &quot;miss the point&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Now that he lives away from home, I don&#39;t have many opportunities to <br/>
invite him to watch with me.<br/>
<br/>
I would give just about anything to have 6-year old Alex sitting on <br/>
my lap and enjoying Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with a happy, <br/>
supportive mom. . . . . (instead of the mom I was that denigrated the <br/>
show)<br/>
<br/>

really hoping to help other moms consider just biting their tongues <br/>
or leaving the room if necessary to prevent ruining a fun show for <br/>
their children. . . . <br/>

(my intro was message 80107 - over 8000 messages ago! - in case <br/>
anyone is wondering who the heck I am &lt;g&gt; )</div>
