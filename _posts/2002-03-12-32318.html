<br/>
I appreciate hearing about your son because I feel like my son is a special <br/>
case also.  He&#39;s always been a huge challenge for me.  He&#39;s in first grade <br/>
right now after unschooling before that & after this year he&#39;ll be home <br/>
again.  I was trying to give him something all his own hoping I&#39;d see <br/>
improvement in his behavior.  Behavior is no better from it but it&#39;s opened <br/>
so many doors in his mind that I only hope I can find ways to fill.  There&#39;s <br/>
more I want to say but since I&#39;m overwhelmed & hormonal I&#39;ll skip the verbal <br/>
diarrhea.  My point is that suggestions & support for unschooling my <br/>
challenging boy is exactly what I am looking for on these lists, along with <br/>
juggling 3 kids when I&#39;m chained to a breast pump.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Sara<br/>
