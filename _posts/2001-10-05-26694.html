Relieved!! (and psyched)<br/>
<br/>
I just asked him what it was, and he told me (a novel based on one of the <br/>
clans in Legend of the Five Rings), and told me who he had borrowed it from, <br/>
that it was really good and had info that wasn&#39;t clear from the cards <br/>
themselves (it&#39;s a card game with booster sets and all, based on medieval <br/>
fantasy Japanese clan wars, sort of, I think).  <br/>
<br/>
He is our big Garfield fan.  Someone commented on the vocabulary in Garfield. <br/>
 I agree, and Calvin and Hobbes even moreso (Marty reads that one).  Just <br/>
because they have pictures of cats and stuffed tigers doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re <br/>
not about real philosophy and politics and interpersonal relationships.  <br/>
Calvin and Hobbes stabs school (repeatedly--thrust, thrust, thrust and no <br/>
need to parry) in elegant fashion about where learning really takes place.<br/>
