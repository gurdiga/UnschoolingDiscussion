Shyrley&#39;s quite pregnant looking.  She says she always shows early.  It was <br/>
nice to hang out with her, and her so frequently doing that fingertip belly <br/>

I didn&#39;t mind people touching me when I was pregnant.  I thought it was kind <br/>
of nice.  But I&#39;ve read and heard other moms rant about invasion of privacy, <br/>
so unless it&#39;s someone I&#39;ve known for years, I just leave them physically <br/>
alone.   <br/>
<br/>
Too bad.  Rather than assuming they might think it&#39;s sweet, I do the safe <br/>
thing and fear the worst reaction.<br/>

himself from touching my belly, commenting how much he missed seeing his wife <br/>
pregnant (their children are grown) ~ on what I knew to be my last day of work, I <br/>
told him to &quot;go ahead, rub the Buddha for luck&quot; & he did ~ what a grin he went <br/>
home with!  I wish we were a more physically affectionate society, I loved <br/>
having my new body appreciated (even if it&#39;s the only time a distended belly is a <br/>
*good thing*).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391789316">I found that when I was pregnant all 4 times, I had a lot of people I didn&#39;t<br/>
really know come and touch my belly. In a good way and not offensive at all.<br/>
Some would even ask if they could rub or feel. Fine by me. I loved my<br/>
belly!!! When I was working and preggers with Joseph, one kid there had his<br/>
hands on my belly so much people started to wonder if he was the dad. He use<br/>
to call Joseph little Buddah in there because of how big I was. I guess I<br/>
look unapproachable when it comes to homeschooling questions but way easy<br/>
when it comes to touching me!!! Is that a good thing???? LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596811306">I think many of us raised here in the states are probably uncomfortable with the idea of people other than close relatives toughing our bellies.  I was uncomfortable with people I knew, but not closely, asking me to touch my pregnant belly but quickly got over that.  The enjoyment and happiness in other people eyes was wonderful.  Afterall, they had to agree this was going to be a wonderful new little life.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m like Sandra though.  I really hesitate to ask to touch a pregnant belly here in the states.  <br/>
