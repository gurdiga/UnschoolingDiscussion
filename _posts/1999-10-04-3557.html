<div id="ygrps-yiv-232049534">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I had no idea as I was copying and pasting that the Ezzo articles would end<br/>
up as attachments.  Someone just told me, and I apologize heartily and hope<br/>
it didn&#39;t mess up too many people&#39;s e-mails.  It still doesn&#39;t look like it<br/>
has attachments, when I read it, but I guess maybe different people&#39;s<br/>
computers are different.  I *never* send attachments knowingly.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry,<br/>
Carolyn</div>
