<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693188750"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;while the theory of evolution exists, it is incorrect. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can a theory BE incorrect?  I thought a theory was an idea about<br/>
something.  How can we &quot;prove&quot; evolution or creation?  Maybe God&#39;s 7 days<br/>
of creation took eons of earth time?<br/>
How about telling children &quot;I believe this because... Others believe that<br/>
because...&quot;  We can model our beliefs to our children, but in the long<br/>
run it should be their choice what to believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931476384">Actually, yes, theories can be proven wrong or correct.  Like the theory that <br/>
the universe revolves around the earth or that it revolves around the sun.  <br/>
Neither was proven right or wrong for a long time.  Now we know which one was <br/>
correct.  However, theories on human behavior and development are not so <br/>
easily proven.<br/>

science) but never prove them.  There are working theories that are accepted <br/>
at the time but science never goes so far as to say something is proven.  <br/>
There are only proofs in math. (At least, this is what every science prof I <br/>
ever had taught.)<br/>

I&#39;ve been told this as well.  However, since we are now able to see the earth <br/>
from space it would be hard to say that the theory that it is round, as <br/>
opposed to flat, hasn&#39;t been proven.  Although I&#39;m sure there would be some <br/>
who WOULD say just that.  LOL  What I mean is that if common sense is applied <br/>
to some theories, at least part of the answer would become obvious.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think theories that are &#39;proven&#39; over time by empirical evidence<br/>
might be called laws.  The law of gravity, the laws of thermodynamics,<br/>
and the Ideal Gas Law come to mind for me.<br/>
<br/>
BTW there are suppositions in math systems too that are &#39;known&#39; to<br/>
be true but cannot be proven.  Godel in his Incompleteness Theorem<br/>
showed that for any sufficiently complex system (arithmetic is the<br/>
one he chose) there are suppositions which are true but cannot be<br/>
proven to be true.  It&#39;s interesting mind candy, for me at least!<br/>
