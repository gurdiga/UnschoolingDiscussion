<br/>
&lt;&lt; Actually this is probably the worst place to go for legal information.<br/>
 They do not post the laws, just their interpretation and they do not provide<br/>
 links to inclusive state organizations, only to those that will toe their<br/>
 party line.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Part of their purpose (okay, their only real purpose) is to get people to <br/>
sign up (at $100, it used to be; maybe more now) per year for their (used to <br/>
be) insurance, which is now representation (WAY more vague, yet more honest, <br/>
since it&#39;s not insurance).  They use scare tactics to get people to send them <br/>
money, which is used for right-wing political purposes.  And they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
defend an unschooler anyway, so if you&#39;re unschooling that site&#39;s not going <br/>
to be of much benefit except in an educational sort of way (like reading the <br/>
opposition&#39;s flyers or looking at pictures of a trainwreck).  If a family has <br/>
a problem and the resolution of that problem can further HSLDA&#39;s political <br/>
causes in that state, they might go to court for them, but their purpose is <br/>
not to make homeschooling easier for a family, but to make it more uniformly <br/>
their conservative form of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could comfort you with the thought that I might be a reactionary <br/>
exaggerator here, but I&#39;m not.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654101170">No, you aren&#39;t reactionary!  We have all seen the damage they have done<br/>
either to homeschoolers as a whole in some states by messing with the laws<br/>
or to homeschoolers as individuals such as Cheryl.<br/>
