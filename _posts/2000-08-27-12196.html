&lt;&lt;  But wouldn&#39;t it be so much more <br/>
 productive if we could bring these guys around sooner?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband keeps on saying &quot;why is this so women oriented, do the dads have a <br/>
night out together&quot; (because our group meets once a month for coffee at a <br/>
bookstore and it&#39;s all women)... <br/>
<br/>
My hubbie and I are in the process of switching roles and we did this once <br/>
before.  Women treated him like he was going to drop the baby and that he was <br/>
&quot;babysitting&quot; and he&#39;s not looking forward to those comments again.  Ahhh the <br/>
real world that we live in.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  As a collateral cultural issue, have you ever noticed how publications<br/>
 like &quot;Parents Magazine&quot; and others tend to assume that parenting is done by<br/>
 Moms.  Look at the advertisements in that mag.  Admittedly, I haven&#39;t looked<br/>
 at one in a while, but the last time I did I think the percentage of ads not<br/>
 addressed to Moms was MAYBE 10%.  I finally stopped reading it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not just that John but also how geared they are to dumping kids in daycare <br/>
and the parents taking care of their own &quot;emotional needs&quot; first.  I just <br/>
refuse to buy them... Nearly always on the cover is some new way you can (a) <br/>
get rid of your kids (b) entertain at 10pm at night when they&#39;ve been gone <br/>
all day...  JMHO...<br/>
