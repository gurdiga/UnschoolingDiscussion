<div id="ygrps-yiv-212804607">&lt; I&#39;ll let you know what I think after I read it....<br/>
&quot;The gentle art of Verbal Self Defense&quot;  by Suzette<br/>
Haden Elgin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m about 1/3 of the way through the book (pg<br/>
108).  I really like it.  But I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not going<br/>
to master it by Saturday (when my parents arrive) LOL.<br/>
 I&#39;ve done a google on the author & found she has<br/>
written several more books on verbal self-defense (as<br/>
well as science fiction, and more) so I&#39;ll have more<br/>
study materials :)<br/>
<br/>
Here is &quot;Why You Need to Master Verbal Self-Defense&quot;<br/>
and the first lesson:<br/>
 <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.adrr.com/aa/whymastervsd.html">http://www.adrr.com/aa/whymastervsd.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Now why wasn&#39;t this taught to me in school?  Something<br/>
I could have REALLY used LOL.<br/>
The examples in the book hit a little too close to<br/>
home for me.  <br/>
<br/>
She writes: &quot;Worst of all, verbal violence all too<br/>
often goes unrecognized, except at a level that you<br/>
cannot even understand yourself.  You know that you<br/>
are suffering, and you vaguely know where the pain is<br/>
coming from; but because the aggression is so well<br/>
hidden, you are likely to blame yourself instead of<br/>
the aggressor, and to add to your own misery,like<br/>
this:  &#39;I can&#39;t understand why I feel so stupid when<br/>
I&#39;m with her.  She&#39;s always so considerate and she&#39;s<br/>
such a nice person!  There must be something the<br/>
matter with me.&#39;  There probably is something the<br/>
matter with you, yes.  Your problem is that you are<br/>
the victim of verbal violence and you don&#39;t have the<br/>
least idea how to defend yourself against it.&quot; p.2<br/>
<br/>
and on p. 16, &quot;A major reason why people do not<br/>
realize that verbal violence is being used against<br/>
them is that they have never been taught about<br/>
presuppositions.  They know about them, of course,<br/>
below the level of conscious awareness.  That&#39;s why<br/>
they feel hurt or insulted in response to something<br/>
that sounds, on the surface, like a nice thing to say.<br/>
 But they have never been taught to watch out for<br/>
presuppositions, or to pay attention to them instead<br/>
of the words that form the surface sequence.  As a<br/>
result, they cannot express WHY they feel hurt or<br/>
insulted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She has lots of info on her website.  enjoy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981957143">Heather, maybe you could ask your mom to put her concerns in writing so you <br/>
can really think about them, later on.<br/>
<br/>
Probably she never will.<br/>
<br/>
If she does, just the act of writing them down will help her clarify her own <br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
If she refuses, you could claim if it&#39;s not important enough to put in <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863716615">My son wanted to play baseball when he was 10 (or so), so I signed him up <br/>
for the local little league team, bought the uniform and went to the parent <br/>
meeting/etc.  He tried really hard to enjoy it, and the coach was really <br/>
pretty nice, but he never really loved it (although he did have some good <br/>
times.)  The other kids on the team teased him for his long hair and gentle <br/>
manner, the other parents were really stand-off-ish (as in, you&#39;re <br/>
different/strange and we don&#39;t want to know you) and it was all so <br/>
commercial-feeling.  Like they wanted to get the most money out of you they <br/>
could.  There was also a lot of talk about how this kid might get recruited <br/>
for the &#39;majors&#39;, but not that kid - and then they&#39;d dissect WHY the kid <br/>
wasn&#39;t as good, etc.  We live in a fairly well-educated, diverse locale, <br/>
but it seems that little league pulls from a very different mindset.   Very <br/>
dis-illusioning.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, ds chose to not return the following year and has never asked to <br/>
play on another  team.  (although we do toss a ball now and then, and have <br/>
gone to the batting cages.)<br/>
<br/>
If the kids wanted to go, take them to a little league game.  If they want <br/>
to play for a season, there&#39;s a good chance that the season would be their <br/>
last.<br/>
Baseball is fun.  Little league wasn&#39;t.<br/>

&quot;Well it doesn&#39;t matter how you feel inside, you know? It&#39;s what shows up on<br/>
the surface that counts. That&#39;s what my mother taught me. Take all your bad<br/>
feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees until you&#39;re<br/>
almost walking on them. And then you&#39;ll fit in, and you&#39;ll be invited to<br/>
parties, and boys will like you, and happiness will follow.&quot;<br/>

baseball or softball for kids around 9-12. Everyone plays the whole game,<br/>
all psitions are rotated evenly, each team pitchs to their own teammates<br/>
(you get 5 pitches from a teammate and then 3 from a coach), the inning<br/>
ends after everyone has batted or 3 outs, and it&#39;s just a really low-key<br/>
game. Maybe your local Y does the same?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Looked at the web page, looks very interesting. Reminds me a bit about <br/>
something Alice Miller wrote once. She was talking about how the people <br/>
in Germany related to Hitler in a way that the outside world didn&#39;t <br/>
comprehend; to outsiders he appeared a hysterical and comic figure but <br/>
to a majority of Germans his ranting and posturing hit an internal chord <br/>
  that was tied into the highly coercive and judgmental early childhood <br/>
experiences many of them had in common. They literally could not &quot;see&quot; <br/>
him because what they saw was how he was packaged, how the message was <br/>
delivered in ways that they had been taught as children to see as how <br/>
loving authorities acted and to deny their own internal truth.<br/>
<br/>
And, I think this happens in all cultures.  Whenever we teach our <br/>
children to deny their own inner truth or tell them something that isn&#39;t <br/>
good for them is, or manipulate them to gain something  at the cost of <br/>
their inner feelings, we breakdown that inner wall of protection and <br/>
make them vulnerable to exploitation from someone with that same sort of <br/>
&quot;face&quot;: The smiling face of loving kindness hiding lies and hurt. Child <br/>
Molesters exploit this when they &quot;prep&quot; their victims, sometimes with <br/>
the parents in unknowing partnership, the child feels something wrong <br/>
and resists, the parents tell them to &quot;be nice&quot; to Uncle Johnny and the <br/>
child denies the sense of danger or unease that his gut is telling him <br/>
and obeys.<br/>
<br/>
And it seems darn near impossible to change that in one&#39;s own self. The <br/>
lessons are taught so young that I think we always remain a bit <br/>
vulnerable to the picture of that smiling face no matter how hard we try <br/>
to overlay that early emotional training with logic and calm truth. We <br/>
remain particularly vulnerable to it with members of our own families <br/>
since we&#39;ve been indoctrinated into it for so long.<br/>
<br/>
 From the website:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You are a native speaker of English; you know when you are under verbal <br/>
attack because you feel it, in exactly the same way that you feel it <br/>
when somebody hits you. Don&#39;t be confused: Know that you are under attack.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That is SO true. You feel it. But you&#39;ve spent years learning to deny it <br/>
and when it comes with the face of love and all that you depend on for <br/>
survival as a young child it is pretty hard to ignore.<br/>

&gt; Baseball is fun.  Little league wasn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Little League is an actual organization with a set of rules and standards.  <br/>
Not all youth baseball organizations are Little League.  Around here, aside <br/>
from YMCA or church leagues, it&#39;s the least competitive, most inclusive <br/>
league.  The players are evaluated at the beginning of the season and each <br/>
team has the same number of kids in each playing ability.  This gives every <br/>
team a chance to win some and lose some.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can&#39;t do anything about the types of people who bring their <br/>
kids to play baseball.  But if you live in even a medium sized city, and your <br/>
son would like to try baseball again, you might want to check around and find <br/>
another type of league.  Almost any Baptist church with a ball field out back <br/>
has a league.  There&#39;s even a league here that uses only different colored <br/>
jerseys and doesn&#39;t keep score.  <br/>
<br/>
This is my 15th spring at the ballpark, watching one or the other of my sons <br/>
play ball.  Each of my 3 have had different reasons for playing, different <br/>
abilities and different ambitions--plus we move a lot--so we&#39;ve been a part <br/>
of all types of leagues. If your son really wants to play baseball, there <br/>
should be a way.<br/>

Your mom sounds a lot like mine.  It&#39;s not that mom isn&#39;t aware that there<br/>
is a problem.  She knows darn well there&#39;s a problem; I&#39;M the problem.<br/>
Lately, I&#39;ve been using the disconnect act.  This is only on the phone; I<br/>
haven&#39;t been home in a while.  Ask me in August how the week at home went.<br/>

figure we&#39;ve been playing her games for years, so now we&#39;re playing mine.<br/>

<br/>
She starts in about curriculum, and I reply about how happy I am with his<br/>

carries on about how much he&#39;s missing at school, and I talk about the<br/>
delightful trips we&#39;ve taken lately.  When she repeats herself and asks if I<br/>
heard her, I&#39;ve been saying, &quot;Oh, yes, of course I did&quot; and breezing off to<br/>
another topic.  <br/>
<br/>
The trick for me is to not defend myself (I never win anyway) and to not<br/>
stay on her topic.  I do NOT mention that Tim does go to school for 45<br/>
minutes a week when she&#39;s on the school discourse, I talk about something<br/>
totally different.  The 45 minutes at school will be a lovely reply to the<br/>

Hi, Brenda -<br/>
<br/>
I remember!  I&#39;m not sure why she thinks he can have a great book<br/>
discussion in school when many of the students won&#39;t have read the<br/>
&quot;assigned&quot; book.  (My dh teaches 9th grade English in public school, so<br/>
I&#39;m cynical in my belief that the students are mostly cynical.)<br/>
<br/>
Book groups for kids are also sponsored by libraries and bookstores.  I<br/>
don&#39;t read the kid discussions on unschooling.com, but they are very<br/>
active and it&#39;s possible that they sometimes talk about books.  There<br/>
are lots of options for anyone who wants to talk about books.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, isn&#39;t she aware that there are kids in school who sneer at<br/>
other kids who confess to liking books?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m off to visit *my* mom now, and I&#39;m gonna take the prior advice to<br/>
&quot;be Zen&quot;.  (If I fail, I&#39;ll come back tomorrow with a brief report.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh YES. Roya (now 18) went to school through 4th grade. The LAST day of <br/>
school the class was having a party (I was room mom, of course, so I <br/>
was there in the classroom a LOT). They were playing a form of bingo - <br/>
using the overhead projector the teacher had the kids call out things <br/>
they planned to do during school break and filling the spaces on the <br/>
bingo card with those things. They were saying: go to Disneyland, go to <br/>
the beach, go to my grandma&#39;s, go to the mall, go skateboarding, and so <br/>
on. Roya gleefully shouted out: GO TO THE LIBRARY!!! There was a groan, <br/>
in unison, from half the class - and one girl said, &quot;You WOULD actually <br/>
want go to the library during vacation, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; very <br/>
sarcastically. These kids were only 9 and 10 years old!!!!  We&#39;d <br/>
already decided to homeschool - I felt like we were just barely dodging <br/>
a bullet.<br/>

I also have to be zenlike.   I take lots of breathes and calm myself.     This week I was over there,  at her house,  and she thought the kids needed more &#39;guidance&#39;.

She thinks my son has become more reclusive,  like he doesn&#39;t talk to people as much anymore. Well,   when she was last at our house he had just gotten a gameboy advance from a friend.   Hmmmmm,  I wonder why he didn&#39;t talk much.   Plus she doesn&#39;t talk to him about anything he&#39;s interested in.   I also said maybe he doesn&#39;t have anything to say.   Maybe he isn&#39;t going to be a talkative person,  isn&#39;t that OK? That&#39;s a  huge point,   if my kids don&#39;t talk with adults about what  the adults  think is &#39;interesting&#39; or of &#39;importance&#39;,   well,  then they aren&#39;t learning anything!      Sigh...    And of course,  video games can&#39;t be of importance.  I told my Mom if she would ask him about what he was doing she wouldn&#39;t be able to get a word in edge wise,  but she doesn&#39;t do that. I think she would rather he sat down and showed her how nice his handwriting is...how to multiply..and etc...bleck..that would impress her.    Different priorities,  I&#39;d say.  I just stay confident in my decision to unschool.   And show the doubters how wonderful it all is!!   Kelli <br/>
