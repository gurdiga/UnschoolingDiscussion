For our recent car trip with our 3 y/o, my Mother sent a bag of surprises to<br/>
be opened at regular intervals.  Some snacks, some little toys (like<br/>
matchbox cars, stickers, small book), she wrapped or bagged each surprise<br/>
separately so it took a little time to open.  We also took music that we all<br/>
enjoyed - Ella Jenkins folk songs, some Coltrane, Beatles, etc. and  I<br/>
packed music makers- rhythm sticks, & assorted such items.  Plus we stopped<br/>
once for a rare treat - fast food french fries & shake.  We didn&#39;t even need<br/>
all the snacks & &#39;prises&#39; my Mother sent, it went really well and believe me<br/>
I was worried!<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun,<br/>
