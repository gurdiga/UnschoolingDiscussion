<div id="ygrps-yiv-636523226">Boy I&#39;m with Sandra on this one.  I grew up in an<br/>
alcoholic home as well, my dad not my mom.  Of the<br/>

I&#39;d be even more worried about my older son, since his<br/>

tendancy to overdo things like sugar, to the detriment<br/>
of everyone around him.<br/>

interesting if it was villified.  I think being open<br/>
and free and honest about the problems can only be a<br/>
good thing ;)....and from my understanding of<br/>
adictions they tend to be ways to control one&#39;s life<br/>
when one is feeling powerless, and I hope that<br/>
unschooling kids are free and powerful!!!, and will be<br/>
less likely to fall into paths like that...<br/>

===========<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  Too many kids who are drinking sneaky will do it a lot because <br/>
they&#39;re being sneaky.  In for a penny, in for a pound, kind of.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid has a beer, as Kelly described Cameron, he can drink a little and <br/>
leave it there.<br/>
If he buys his own, or friends buy it (at kid-rates, sometimes extra much <br/>
because they have to bribe an adult to get it for them), the other kids would <br/>
press him to finish it and not &quot;waste&quot; it.  Kids will press each other to drink <br/>
more.  (Adults do it too.  It&#39;s way irritating.)<br/>
<br/>
I do think, though, that if someone has a strong case of alcoholism (if there <br/>
are greater and lesser cases) it doesn&#39;t matter how old he is when he starts, <br/>
that will be the situation from then on, he&#39;ll either be drinking or wishing <br/>
he were or wishing he werne&#39;t, but not living in the absence of alcohol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800349497">There are lots of factors, but I think the happiness one is the most important.  <br/>
 <br/>
I also come from a family of addictive folks -- lots of smokers, many &#39;problem drinkers&#39; some binge drinking.  I spent about 5 years of my life either high or drunk (often both) as did my brother and sister.  My first husband (Will&#39;s bio-dad) comes from some really ugly alcoholism and all sorts of other abuse issues, so I worried about Will.  He grew up during the 15 or so years I spent not drinking at all (now I have an occasional glass of wine or a beer) and Gary doesn&#39;t drink at all. <br/>
 <br/>
We grew up being allowed to taste my Mom&#39;s drinks, and sip from Dad&#39;s beers.  With us the big taboo was smoking, because my Mom had quit after my paternal grandad died of lung cancer (caused by 40yrs of roll your owns) so we got many a lecture from Dad about the dangers of smoking.  The result?  I smoked for 5 years, my brother for about the same time, my sister still smokes, tho she quits every few years only to start again.  Mom started up again literally the day she moved out of the house to divorce Dad.  She recognizes that addictions are about self-medicating pain and depression.<br/>
 <br/>
I had really hoped Will could skip the wasted time with drugs and alcohol.  He&#39;d been told the risks, both average and specific to his genetics.  He knows he&#39;s the latest in a long history of addictive folks on all sides.  About the great-grandfather (my ex&#39;s g&#39;pa) who suicided after a life of alcoholism that included molesting his granddaughter; that my bro and sis both still use recreationally (at times, I&#39;ve been pretty sure my bro is really just a high-functioning drunk).  <br/>
 <br/>
From what I&#39;m hearing, he&#39;s more like us than I wanted -- he has to learn this for himself.  He&#39;s using but still getting to work, losing friends and running up debt.  I&#39;m sure a lot of it stems from the fact that he was public schooled, that I exerted more control and gave him less autonomy than I should have.  Probably being the only child of a single Mom who was raised in a very dysfuctional home doesn&#39;t help.  Mostly, I was just way too young and stupid to have a child at all.  I wish I&#39;d known about unschooling when he was young -- he&#39;s certainly much more at risk than the other boys genetically, and the environment I gave him early on was no help.  <br/>
 <br/>
With the remaining boys?  I&#39;m not sure how we&#39;ll handle it just yet, but given my genetics and history, I&#39;d be no more comfortable with illegal drugs than alcohol, even tho I agree pot should be legal.  The real problem as I see it with minor illegal drugs is the drug policy dictates sometimes very major consequences.  That can work both ways -- it can be very draconian and injurious to the casual user, or a good wake-up call for the budding addict.  Addiction is addiction, be it cigarettes, booze or drugs, and it doesn&#39;t happen in the absence of pain because it always starts as escape and escalates to self-medication.  My hope is that by raising free, happy unschooled and autonomous kids, I can help the others avoid it.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s been a tough several days around here with news of Will from my sister who just visited.  I had really hoped he would be able to hold it together for himself, but it seems his good run lasted about 8 mos and now he&#39;s losing his way.  I know we all survived it, but this doesn&#39;t make it any easier to be his Mom right now.  <br/>

 <br/>
I could have gone home and had a drink anytime I wanted - that didn&#39;t make me any less damaged or pained.  Home was such a mess that there wasn&#39;t enough alcohol or drugs to make it better, and the pain only followed me into adulthood.  It only got better for me when I realized I was going to be someone&#39;s Mom and I needed to get my act together.  Even that took several more years, and that was while clean and sober.  It&#39;s not just about letting kids try liquor at home, it&#39;s about helping them to be happy and strong so that they won&#39;t feel the need to escape or self-medicate.  IME, addiction isn&#39;t about control, it&#39;s about pain and lack and sadness.<br/>

Maybe there have never been enough happy people to be control-group enough to <br/>

The control doesn&#39;t (except for the &quot;I can do what I want because I&#39;m grown, <br/>
and this represents adult freedom&quot; level of control).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the idea that there are physical differences and some people having <br/>

Well, after years of totally abstaining I find I can have the occasional glass of wine without needing another tomorrow -- something I couldn&#39;t have said about myself 19 yrs ago.  I&#39;m definitely happier today than I ever remember being.  It&#39;s a combination of things -- unschooling myself, left the really bad church, and something about turning 40 really put me in a better place with myself.  <br/>
 <br/>
I do find it hard to believe that truly content people -- not just surface happy, but genuinely fulfilled -- would fall into addiction.  Seems to me they&#39;d have too many reasons to be sober and aware.  <br/>

It&#39;s so hard to watch them, isn&#39;t it? My older son spends his days smoking <br/>
tobacco and pot, and dumpster-diving and scavenging at the dump for cans <br/>
and bottles to sell. He&#39;s living in the same town, but he hasn&#39;t spoken to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-171728821">Thanks, Tia, for the hugs.  Yes, it&#39;s tough to watch, even from afar.  My sister told me that Will had said (in an argument) maybe he&#39;d just return to Albuquerque.  Of course, that&#39;s with no job.  He&#39;s not asked me, but he can&#39;t stay here while he&#39;s using.  I won&#39;t expose the younger ones to that.  <br/>
 <br/>
Of course, my Mom is enabling him just like she&#39;s always enabled my brother on and off over the years.  Mom told me she&#39;s been paying his car insurance even tho he hasn&#39;t paid her for 3 months.  Yes, this is the same Mom who read me the riot act for not being harder on my kids!  It is just so maddening.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh well, I can only hope he&#39;ll stay in North Carolina where he&#39;s not hanging around my house, and that all this will pass before he gets into real trouble.  While it&#39;s nice to have sympathy, it&#39;s too bad you&#39;re in such a spot with your older son.  May they both figure it out soon!<br/>

So what are you saying here?  Yes, unschooling looks unlikely but works.  Yes, it looks like happy people would avoid addiction, but really but addiction is inevitable even in happy people? That&#39;s really discouraging for those of us who are genetically predisposed to addiction. Altho I suppose it does absolve me of any fault in Will&#39;s current predicament -- after all, even if he&#39;d been the happiest kid in America, he&#39;d still be burning up all his income getting high.  <br/>

I think depressed people without the genetic whatever-it-is can live without <br/>
being addicts, and that those who are prone to addiction might be addicts even <br/>
if their lives are ideal.   And in the grey area, depression probably doesn&#39;t <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025544420">I&#39;ve been reading through this thread, as I don&#39;t get<br/>
to the computer every day, and gathering up the posts<br/>
that I wanted to comment on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Boy I&#39;m with Sandra on this one.  I grew up in an<br/>
&gt; alcoholic home as well, my dad not my mom.  Of the<br/>
&gt; four kids raised in the home, 1 became an illegal<br/>
&gt;drug addict, one an alcoholic and the other 2 (myself<br/>
&gt; included) so adverse to drink that we don&#39;t touch a<br/>
&gt; drop ourselves. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(That was me)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But, to relate this back to kids and alcohol freedom-<br/>
&gt;were you and your siblings &quot;allowed&quot; to sip wine or<br/>
&gt;beer with dinner?  The alcoholics I know were<br/>
&gt;definitely *not* free to sip wine with dinner <br/>
&gt;in their childhood homes.<br/>
&gt;Could it have made any difference?<br/>
&gt;Patti<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure that being &quot;allowed&quot; an experience without<br/>
villifying it and making it taboo will help contribute<br/>
to personal understanding, an informed position from<br/>
which to make choices, and the lessening of the need<br/>
to experiment.  This may in turn help someone with a<br/>
tendancy towards alcoholism to avoid it, particularly<br/>
given the opportunity to see what it feels like to<br/>
drink before they are old enough to have the freedom,<br/>
ability or desire to get it more often.  I don&#39;t<br/>
really think it will make a difference in whether a<br/>
person is prone to be an alcoholic or addict or not. <br/>
If you are, you are.  If you&#39;re gay, growing up in a<br/>
home full of loving acceptance for any sexual<br/>
preferances doesn&#39;t make you straight, just by way of<br/>
an example of what I mean.  That doesn&#39;t mean I think<br/>
being gay is some detrimental disease like alcoholism,<br/>
just that I think there are genetic predispositions<br/>
that apply to both that are beyond environment or<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
There was plenty of alcohol available in our home and<br/>
we got champagne on new years well before ten, and<br/>
were offered wine with dinner later, and had beer and<br/>
all manner of hard liquor available in the house.  But<br/>
really, on reflection over this thread, two of my<br/>
siblings have drug/alcohol problems and the other two<br/>
of us don&#39;t.  What&#39;s the difference?  <br/>
<br/>
Well, the older two who have the problems with<br/>
substances are from my mom&#39;s first two marriages, and<br/>
although they have different fathers than myself and<br/>
my other brother, both of those fathers had similar<br/>
substance issues (pattern behavior on mom&#39;s part.)  So<br/>
we all have roughly the same genetic markers for it,<br/>
following the idea of genetics playing a large part. <br/>
So I asked myself what else was different.<br/>
<br/>
Given my mom&#39;s family&#39;s attitude towards substances,<br/>
(anathema) and the fact that they still can&#39;t admit<br/>
that her sister is an alcoholic, even given that she<br/>
is now a quadraplegic from one too many accidents<br/>
driving drunk, it&#39;s pretty likely that they were not<br/>
allowed any experimentation or easy access to alcohol.<br/>
 Their dads split the scene almost before the kids<br/>
were old enough to remember, and they had a single mom<br/>
until she married my father when they were about 10<br/>
and 12.<br/>
<br/>
The other two of us, on the other hand, grew up in the<br/>
home with an active alcoholic who is very casual about<br/>
alcohol; took great pride in how many guests he could<br/>
blindside with his very hard alcoholic punch drink at<br/>
holiday parties; ALWAYS offered drinks first to<br/>
company before food; had a fully stocked bar in the<br/>
house and wanted us to know how to mix drinks; took<br/>
alcohol backpacking; drank martinis in the car, even<br/>
while driving cross country, or to the grocery store,<br/>
whatever; and so on.  Both of us don&#39;t drink a drop,<br/>
and don&#39;t keep any alcohol in our homes just because<br/>
we don&#39;t care for it, and we married people who don&#39;t<br/>
care for it, and have associations with it that are<br/>
not fun and pleasant, not because we think it is<br/>
itself evil.  The smell of alcohol on someone&#39;s breath<br/>
still brings out a deep, gut level, fight or flight<br/>
pavlovian thing in me that I have to really work to<br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we also got strenuous lectures and<br/>
dire threats regarding the many evils of smoking and<br/>
drugs (hypocritical I know) and neither of us ever had<br/>
a problem with either of those, even though I<br/>
occassionally tried clove cigarettes when I was a<br/>
teen, and did experiment with drgs too.  But then, no<br/>
one in our families that we saw regularly smoked, and<br/>
I can only think of one relative whom we rarely saw<br/>
that did smoke, out of all the many relatives on both<br/>
sides.  So maybe that is a different genetic<br/>
predisposition altogether, or maybe there was no &quot;do<br/>
as I say not as I do&quot; to rebel against in that case<br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I could have gone home and had a drink anytime I<br/>
&gt;wanted - that didn&#39;t make me any less damaged or<br/>
&gt;pained.  Home was such a mess that there wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;enough alcohol or drugs to make it better, and the<br/>
&gt;pain only followed me into adulthood.<br/>
&gt;Syl<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes exactly.  But somehow my brother and I were able<br/>
to avoid going through the addiction stage at all, and<br/>
he&#39;s even still in denial about the alcoholism in the<br/>
family, at least out loud, I don&#39;t know what he thinks<br/>
to himself.  Maybe for me it was just rampant fear<br/>
that kept me in line until I got into Alanon and<br/>
counseling and dealt with baggage.  I was in<br/>
relationships with abusive addicts right up until I<br/>
married my husband, had my first son and started<br/>
Alanon, all in the same year.  I know that for me, my<br/>
survival tactic from toddlerhood was being in<br/>
&quot;control&quot; of every aspect that I could control.   <br/>
Being drunk or high is being out of control, and I<br/>
could not stomach that.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good thing I started learning about unschooling<br/>
before my kids were born and knowing that was the way<br/>
we wanted to go, and that I was receptive to the idea,<br/>
having fought tooth and nail to escape the box as a<br/>
teen myself.  I know letting go of illusions of<br/>
control is a big part of an unschooling lifestyle, and<br/>
I had a lot to let go of.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;.......  It&#39;s not just about letting kids try liquor<br/>
&gt;at home, it&#39;s about helping them to be happy and<br/>
&gt;strong so that they won&#39;t feel the need to escape or <br/>
&gt;self-medicate.  IME, addiction isn&#39;t about control,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s about pain and lack and sadness.<br/>
&gt;Syl<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what happened with my brother and I, who certianly<br/>
did not grow happy and lacking pain and sadness, yet<br/>
are not addicts?  I can&#39;t think of a time in my<br/>
childhood when I didn&#39;t suffer from depression and<br/>
axiety and so forth.  Did we miss the genetics<br/>
somehow, or is it something else?  I know I have<br/>
craved drugs or alcohol at different times in my life<br/>
and it scared the hell out of me and I didn&#39;t fulfill<br/>
the craving.  I know that despite the free access I<br/>
expreimented with drugs and alcohol as a teen and<br/>
hated feeling out of control.  I know I have a<br/>
tendancy to eat too much sugar or be obsessive about<br/>
other things if I don&#39;t pay attention to my behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously there is no one size fits all answer to this<br/>
problem, but I do think that strong family<br/>
realtionships, strong foundations, non-villifying of<br/>
substances, access to information, open and honest<br/>
conversation, and some self control are all positively<br/>
contributing factors towards avoiding addiction.  None<br/>
of it is a guarantee.  We all have to walk our own<br/>
road and face our own demons, even our kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think depressed people without the genetic<br/>

that those &gt;who are prone to addiction might be<br/>
addicts even <br/>

Yeah, I can see where those could factor in.  In thinking about this more last night, it occured to me this morning that, if not for Gary&#39;s allergy to cigarette smoke and my concern for the boys&#39; health, I&#39;d probably still be a smoker.  I&#39;ve always told myself it&#39;s about stress, but really there are days (especially on a cool crisp spring morning) when I crave a cigarette so strongly I can literally taste that first drag.  I can also see if a person has a job where social drinking is expected and they are predisposed, addiction could happen.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I drank and got high on a daily basis, it wasn&#39;t that I couldn&#39;t resist the taste of alcohol or pot, but that I consciously wanted to be high -- to escape into a place where everything was funny and I had no responsbilities.  I guess, tho, that addiction is addiction physically and reasons are a whole other matter.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know, just trying to find some way to protect the boys from it, I guess.<br/>

I see you point, and there&#39;s no way to know how much difference any of my parenting choices made.  Well, except for the one where I left the ex (ds&#39; bio-dad) who smacked him at 5 mos old -- I&#39;m pretty sure that one saved our lives.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s just that the drug and alcohol use is the one thing I most want our kids to avoid.  I know how much it screwed up my life.  I&#39;ve seen how it still affects my brother, who seems to be doing better, but who took much longer to get it all together.  We all went thru years lost to alcohol and drugs, but my sister and I straightened up much younger, because we became Moms.  My brother didn&#39;t really have to (and the jury&#39;s still out on how clean he is) until after he&#39;d lost his kids and wanted them back -- and as he saw how much damage his ex-wife was doing to them being almost constantly drunk.  <br/>
 <br/>
Besides that, the laws and enforcement today are positively draconian compared to when I was Will&#39;s age.  Today, even a small amount of drugs can land you in jail, and detection is so much more likely.  <br/>
 <br/>
On some level, if my kids were girls I&#39;d worry less, figuring that even if they strayed, they&#39;d clean up for a pregnancy someday. Or maybe not.  I just feel so helpless in this for him.  I can&#39;t have him here if he asks to come home, and I can&#39;t fix his life for him.  Obviously, I have more to figure out in this Mom thing!  <br/>

Do you think it could really be firm conviction that it had to be better?<br/>

I think it was theory at first.  Then belief.<br/>

Conviction (for me, anyway) comes after.  That&#39;s another rearview mirror <br/>
item. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But now that my kids are older, I DO have a convction that unschooling in its <br/>
ideal state is glorious.<br/>
<br/>
One way people screw up unschooling is to provide for it physically, but to <br/>
keep a running dialog up that casts doubt over the whole thing.   If parents <br/>
are going to talk about &quot;it&quot; (what they&#39;re doing, what they&#39;re thinking) they <br/>
should try not to.  Spend the talking time talking with kids about what they&#39;re <br/>
interested in.    Talk about &quot;it&quot; HERE, and at unschooling.com and places <br/>
&#39;backstage&#39; from the action of learning and living.<br/>
<br/>
The kids don&#39;t need a theory or a belief.  They just need to be living <br/>
peaceful lives, and a life lived under a haze of discussion of whether it&#39;s going to <br/>
work or not, whether they&#39;re watching too much TV, whether they&#39;re behind or <br/>
ahead or whatever is not a peaceful life.<br/>

<br/>
My kids have one alcoholic grandparent of four.<br/>
That&#39;s not bad!!  <br/>
<br/>
But my sister and I only had one alcoholic parent of four too, and she&#39;s an <br/>
alcoholic.  I&#39;m not.   I&#39;m physically more like my dad&#39;s mom, ane that side <br/>
doens&#39;t have alcoholism at all.  My sister&#39;s a little more (not tons) like my <br/>
mom&#39;s side.   But what traits go with what physical appearance?  Maybe none.<br/>
<br/>
Of my kids, Marty is most like his dad&#39;s side; no alcohol.  Kirby is more <br/>
like me.  Holly reminds me of two of my cousins, both bigtime drug addicts now.   <br/>
Should I be afraid because Holly looks like Nadine and Nadine had four <br/>
children by four fathers by the time she was 25?<br/>
<br/>
But Nadine (my younger cousin) was probably conceived, carried and born to a <br/>
drunken mom.  She was neglected, ended up in a county orphanage (Lena Polk <br/>
Home, for Texans, in case it&#39;s still there; Tarrant county, I think), then with <br/>
my parents for a few years, where my mom started drinking heavily, and my <br/>
parents broke up and she lost her spot when she was fourteen and started being <br/>
shuttled among other relatives.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is with both parents, neither of whom drinks, and she&#39;s not neglected.<br/>
<br/>
My theory and belief is that this should be advantageous to her, but I don&#39;t <br/>
know for absolute certain, and so I&#39;ve warned her (and the other kids too) <br/>
that the genetic and biological factors are unclear these days, might be clearer <br/>
someday, but they just need to be careful with alcohol.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what else to do, but I wouldn&#39;t fail to do at least that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think keeping them from alcohol is possible.<br/>
I don&#39;t think making rules against it is adviseable.<br/>
So far the boys have no interest.  I&#39;m relieved.<br/>
We&#39;ve offered them tastes and they usually decline.  I&#39;m relieved.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know enough to be complacent, though.<br/>
And I don&#39;t know enough to panic.  <br/>
So I&#39;m wary.<br/>

This is a good comparison.<br/>
And I don&#39;t think alcoholism is a disease, technically.  IF it&#39;s genetic, <br/>
it&#39;s no more a disease than homosexuality.<br/>
So if alcoholism without alcohol (abstinence) &quot;controls the disease,&quot; maybe <br/>
by disease they mean once the alcohol is introduced, the body responds as it <br/>
would in a diseased state.  The disease model is WAY better than the <br/>
plain-old-sin model.  But if it&#39;s an underlying condition...  well I guess diabetes is <br/>
that kind of disease. You can inherit it.  <br/>
<br/>
I think of &quot;disease&quot; more as something that&#39;s communicable or can be cured. <br/>
Otherwise it&#39;s a condition or state of being.<br/>

don&#39;t villify the alcohol, still the child knows his mother didn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t <br/>
keep him.  That&#39;s got to be a sorrow even if the rest of life is like a party.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just for some added thought.  My mother had my older brother through a <br/>
previous marriage. His father was an alcoholic.  She left him when my older brother <br/>
was young, like 4-5, but he was still exposed to the alcoholic man.  Anyway <br/>
she married another man, my father, and they had two children, myself and my <br/>
younger brother.  My older brother was very loved and adopted by my father yet he <br/>
still slipped in alcoholism in his 30s.  He is recovering and has been sober <br/>
for about 20 years now.  My younger brother and I have never had a problem <br/>
with alcohol. <br/>
<br/>
Not that other factors in our lives have made an impression on us.  Just <br/>
thought it was interesting.  Genetics?  Environment?  Can a rich environment make <br/>
up for an early short period of exposure to alcoholism?  Not sure of the <br/>
answers, just interesting questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712935227">The al-Anon advice on detachment might be something you should find online and read, read, read before he gets to town and contacts you.   If you want to go to meetings for a bit, we could keep your boys if you need us to.   <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
Thank you Sandra -- I&#39;ll check out al-Anon online.  I tried them some 15 yrs ago, the first time our family talked about helping my brother stop using, but then somehow the crisis subsided, and I got busy with my own stuff.  <br/>
 <br/>
I had known for a while before Will left home that he was using.  I know he was using casually when he quit school, and still managed to get his GED, but was having real  trouble  motivating to work.  He seemed stuck, and I was pretty sure that only added to his use.  I think the real difference for him is that being at home didn&#39;t suck as badly for him as it did for me.  I was very motivated to find a job and leave home for anywhere else -- even Los Alamos in the winter!<br/>
 <br/>
I was even pretty sure he was doing some minor sales in exchange for supply (since he had no funds) but I really hoped that maybe a change of scenery and friends would make a difference.  After hearing that he&#39;s threatening to come back here, I have to wonder if I&#39;m still willing to fly him out here for the inlaws&#39; visit in October.  I&#39;m worried he may fly back and just never return, and I certainly don&#39;t want him as a houseguest while the grandparents are here if he can&#39;t quit using.  I&#39;m starting to re-think that invite we extended for him to visit. <br/>
 <br/>
I definitely need someone who has been where I am, and who is not my Mom to give me some ideas.  Again, thanks for the offer.  I&#39;ll remember to ask if I need it.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to chop that sentence off and link it back to the porn discussion, because I think &quot;villify&quot; is an excellent word and an important concept.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are going to be less messed up about drinking if they don&#39;t think drinking is shameful and feel shame if they have a drink.  Kids are going to be less messed up about sex if they don&#39;t think sex is shameful.  Kids are going to be less messed up about porn if they don&#39;t think porn is shameful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very hard for a parent who has been traumatized about one of these topics to be calm and relaxedwhen discussing one of these &quot;hot topics&quot; with their kids.  I know it must be a struggle.<br/>

school because school was damaging so anything had to be better.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with anything people think there is more damage in doing than<br/>
not doing even if they don&#39;t know what to replace it with. School. Rat race.<br/>
Church. Desperate enough to just give up on that thing and do something,<br/>
anything else. They don&#39;t necessarily know what they&#39;ll get instead but are<br/>
convinced that turning their back on something is better than putting up<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the spirit that drove the first wave of pioneers! They didn&#39;t know what<br/>
they were going towards, but they knew they didn&#39;t like what they were<br/>
leaving behind.<br/>
<br/>
And their positive experiences provided something for the next wave to see<br/>
as proof that the choices aren&#39;t only the hell-like thing or hell itself.<br/>
<br/>
No one needs to be a pioneer in unschooling anymore, though people still can<br/>
if they want to. We have people who already braved it out who went before us<br/>
whose kids are grown and doing well on their own. We might end up going<br/>
further than they did, because we already know that going as far as they did<br/>
is a proven thing. (Not something they necessarily knew.)<br/>
<br/>
And come to think of it, I&#39;m thinking of people like Anne Ohman and Mary<br/>
Gold (and others) who are traveling basically uncharted territory by using<br/>
respectful parenting/unschooling with kids with special needs. I don&#39;t think<br/>
either knows loads of -- if any -- grown children with similar special needs<br/>
who were raised in the ways they&#39;re raising their kids. They can see now<br/>
that they were right in their beliefs, but they had to go more on conviction<br/>
than data that applied to their situations at the beginning.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, he had a conviction based on experience and trial and error.  I like <br/>
that his writings tell what he used to think, and what happened to change his <br/>
mind.   I especially remember the bit about cursive writing.  He told kids <br/>
cursive was faster, and then when he set out to prove that, some printers won the <br/>
race, so he changed his beliefs and teachings.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I can see that.  They proved some people wrong, those who survived and <br/>
prospered.  But those who died on the trail or got out there and were miserab<br/>
ly worse off than they had been back home seemed proof to the back-homers <br/>
(doh!) that they shouldn&#39;t have left the relatively-safe known evil.<br/>

I still wonder whether it&#39;s conviction at that point, though, and not <br/>
unproven belief.<br/>
I suppose there&#39;s no morning when you wake up and theory has become belief <br/>
and then cocooned up a while and woken up full-winged conviction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484648592">It&#39;s nearly Beaujolais Nouveau time here in France (and in the rest of the world too, I assume!).   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.intowine.com/beaujolais2.html">http://www.intowine.com/beaujolais2.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Last year we had a friend staying with us who gave our children a sip of her wine, probably assuming that they would hate it.   This particular type of wine is very sweet and fruity, and they loved it.   My children are 11 and 9, and have had sips of other wines, and beers, and pronounced them &quot;disgusting&quot;.     However, I would like to buy some Beaujolais Nouveau again this year and my kids might well notice that it&#39;s the wine they like again!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve looked on Sandra&#39;s site for thoughts about alcohol, and read about Holly and the pudding ;)     <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve explained to my daughters that the law states they are not &#39;allowed&#39; to drink alcohol until they are 16.   However, in your experiences, do arbitrary &#39;laws of the land&#39; type rules have the same effect as some of those imposed in the home: making something more valuable because it&#39;s &#39;forbidden&#39;?   <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I both have some wine on the weekends.   We don&#39;t get drunk.    Apart from with the Beaujolais Nouveau we&#39;d always assumed that letting the girls sip from our glass when they asked was the best thing to do, and that they would be highly unlikely to want to drink more than a sip.    <br/>
<br/>
I loved seeing the pictures of Holly and her beer sampling birthday celebrations on Facebook.   Just wondering how you smooth transition from where we are at now with it, to where Holly is with it.   Obviously the legal age for drinking is several years earlier here, than it is there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any thoughts on this.<br/>
