tonight and posted about it in another group just about one minute before you <br/>
posted this! :) Lillian<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Being the mom of a very large 12yo (5&#39;9&quot; and 155lbs)<br/>
and &quot;dyslexic&quot;, I read this article closely. <br/>
Interesting article, but I think some of her &quot;logic&quot;<br/>
and statements are flawed.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, she says, &quot;You cannot teach a dyslexic<br/>
child to read until the child is ready to learn!<br/>
Dyslexic children cannot be taught by rote like other<br/>
children! It doesn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No one can teach ANY child to read before they are<br/>
ready to learn.  Nor can you teach them anything else<br/>
before they are ready.<br/>
<br/>
She says, &quot;Left alone, dyslexic children learn things<br/>
their way. Home schooling is great for them, because<br/>
they can learn things the way it works for them, not<br/>
the way a teacher presents things to a classroom! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
All children would learn things much differently than<br/>
the way a teacher presents things in a classroom if<br/>
left to learn their own way, not just dyslexic<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
She says, &quot;Also, check to see if the child is &quot;cross<br/>
dominant&quot; - meaning a right handed child with a<br/>
dominant left eye or vice versa.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But according to this website: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www3.azwestern.edu/psy/dgershaw/lol/Handedness.html">http://www3.azwestern.edu/psy/dgershaw/lol/Handedness.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;The main reason for handedness lies in hereditary<br/>
factors that determine which side of the brain will be<br/>
more developed and therefore dominant. ***Typically<br/>
the left side of the brain controls the left side of<br/>
the head but the right side of the body*** � indicated<br/>
by the shaded portions of the figure. [emphasis my<br/>
own]<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, the right side of the brain predominantly<br/>
controls the right side of the head but the left side<br/>
of the body (light portions of figure). This is<br/>
because the nerves cross-over at the back of the<br/>
neck.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this article is particularly helpful to<br/>
unschoolers because I don&#39;t think that unschoolers<br/>
would do anything differently for a child with<br/>
dyslexia than for a child without as far as learning<br/>
on their own.  I know I don&#39;t do anything differently<br/>
for my son based on the knowledge that he is dyslexic,<br/>
but I do things uniquely based on his interests and<br/>
desires, as I do for my other two children.  <br/>
<br/>
It might help school-at-homers, though, to relax a bit<br/>
and not try to make their dyslexic child fit into the<br/>
same mold as their other children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903886454">I haven&#39;t looked into this, but I assume that she&#39;s referring to a situatio=<br/>
n that&#39;s <br/>
outside the norm?  I don&#39;t know, but vision is pretty complex and can preve=<br/>
nt a lot of <br/>
variables... What she&#39;s referring to might not be a matter of the left brai=<br/>
n so much as <br/>
how the person&#39;s vision system is working--but again, I&#39;m not familiar with=<br/>
 what <br/>
she&#39;s referring to. <br/>
<br/>
In regard to non-dyslexic kids being able to learn before they&#39;re ready, I =<br/>
think she&#39;s <br/>
making comparisons among her own children and noticing that some can teach =<br/>
<br/>
themselves certain things when requested, whereas the dyslexic one can&#39;t ne=<br/>
cessarily <br/>
do that. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to get through school, myself, if I hadn=<br/>
&#39;t been able <br/>
to teach myself things when requested--there was an awful lot I didn&#39;t feel=<br/>
 <br/>
particularly ready to learn :::shudder shudder::: Wow, that brought back ba=<br/>
d <br/>
memories...  ;)<br/>
