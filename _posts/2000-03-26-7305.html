<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326011873">Erin,  I agree that it would not be inspiring for my 5yo to keep a nature <br/>
journal by drawing pictures each day, or however often it would need to be <br/>
added to. Forcing it on him definitely wouldn&#39;t  be the choice either-- <br/>
(might as well send him to school).  However, I got a  discontinued wallpaper <br/>
sample book where all the pages are very neutral with very little print.  I <br/>
am going to introduce it as a giant scrapbook to my boys and invite them to <br/>
glue pictures and photos in it, leaves and other nature finds, and any <br/>
artwork they may decide to create and add as well.  Because many of the pgs <br/>
in the wallpaper book are textured, I think they might enjoy making some <br/>
rubbings with pencil and paper,too. * As an added thought, I am just <br/>
wondering if Mason advocated drawings in the journals due to there not being <br/>
too many other options at that point in time.  I guess I mean that her ideas <br/>
could be modified to fit within today&#39;s  &quot;world&quot;-- disposable cameras, wide <br/>
ranges of glues, and tons of inexpensive ready made art supplies.  She could <br/>
encourage drawing, due to portability of pencil & eraser; likewise, so much <br/>
is easy and portable today that may not have been for her.  As I have not <br/>
read her book yet, I may be presumptuous in this thought, but I just <br/>
wondered.  Thanks for your input.                                               <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160853262">Ezzo is a NUT!  He hides behind religion (his own original church sensored<br/>
him and booted him out) and preaches that all children should be controlled<br/>
down to the last micro-second of their lives beginning with the day they<br/>
are born.  They should be &quot;trained&quot; to sleep at given time and only be fed<br/>
at certain times.  They should be spanked, yes spanked, if they don&#39;t sleep<br/>
when told to.  He recommends carrying a &quot;rod&quot; in the diaper bag and using<br/>
it when &quot;appropriate&quot; to &quot;train&quot; the child!  He has a website (I refuse to<br/>
dirty my computer by keeping it) and can be found by doing a web search.<br/>
