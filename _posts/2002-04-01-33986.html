A Tribute to John Taylor Gatto<br/>

<br/>
Kesey&#39;s magnificent novel, as well as the excellent movie featuring a <br/>
young Jack Nicholson (not recommended until you&#39;ve read the book!), <br/>
is the story of a rebel - one Randall Patrick McMurphy -- who finds <br/>
himself (or rather finds a way to get himself) inside a state <br/>
psychiatric institution in the 1960s. Once within, he discovers <br/>
himself bound by a web of rules, procedures, and protocols - really, <br/>
kid gloves -- behind which stands an iron fist of violence and <br/>
repression, all designed of course for &quot;the patient&#39;s own good.&quot; In <br/>
scene after scene, McMurphy probes against the boundaries of the <br/>
forces that stand behind the institution - &quot;the Combine&quot; -- which <br/>
comes to be symbolized by &quot;the Big Nurse&quot; who controls the ward, and <br/>
ultimately holds the fate of each of the patients in her hands. Let <br/>
me not ruin the book for you. I suggest you go out and read it, <br/>
alongside your teenager if you have one, or, if you&#39;ve read it once <br/>
before, read it again, with new eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Kesey&#39;s novel takes place against a backdrop of relentless <br/>
institutional conditioning. While meetings on the ward may seem to be <br/>
democratically organized -- and while inmates - no, here they are <br/>
called &quot;patients&quot; - are urged toward accountability - one quickly <br/>
realizes that there is no democracy at work in the asylum, and that <br/>
accountability is a sham. Inmates are tracked, without their consent, <br/>
into well-demarcated groups as acutes and chronics - and further <br/>
subdivided into walkers, wheelers, and vegetables (we all do remember <br/>
Bluebirds and Robins from first grade, don&#39;t we?) The highest value <br/>
to the Combine is neither democracy nor accountability, but <br/>
compliance, pure and simple, and its favorite stratagem is divide and <br/>
conquer. And if that doesn&#39;t work, there are always drugs. Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that a set of Monarch Notes has ever been heaped with <br/>
literary praise before, but Gatto&#39;s are much deserving. His <br/>
description of the Keseyan institutional world contained in this <br/>
incendiary set of crib notes, (he even quotes Che Guevara - &quot;Educate <br/>
your enemy, don&#39;t kill him, for he is worth more to you alive than <br/>
dead&quot;), is as compelling as the novel itself. He describes the <br/>
Combine that controls this little world as &quot;an all-powerful, <br/>
earth-girdling, brain-destroying association of technocrats...intent <br/>
on building a world of precision, efficiency, and tidiness...a place <br/>
where the schedule is unbreakable.&quot; &quot;In such a world,&quot; writes John, <br/>
&quot;there is neither grief nor happiness; nobody dies - they only burn <br/>
out and are recycled; actually, it is a rather safe place, everything <br/>
is planned - there are neither risks nor surprises.&quot; Gatto continues <br/>
that within this little world, &quot;Words and meaningless routines <br/>
insulate people from life itself, blind them to what is happening <br/>
around them, and deaden the moral faculties.&quot; The defense to this <br/>
charge, ironic of course as John notes, is that the Big Nurse <br/>
delivers charity baskets to the poor. Pivotal to Kesey&#39;s novel, <br/>
according to Gatto, &quot;is the cataclysmic revelation that the inmates <br/>
of the asylum are not committed but are there of their own free <br/>
will.&quot; And the way they are controlled, ultimately, is through guilt, <br/>
shame, fear, and belittlement. Double hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
And now, Gatto, in telescoping the next 25 years of his own career, <br/>
tells us the way out. &quot;The way out of the asylum,&quot; he writes, &quot;is <br/>
literally to throw out the control panel, on a physical level <br/>
smashing the reinforced windows, on a symbolic spiritual level <br/>
becoming independent of rules, orders, and other people&#39;s urgencies.&quot; <br/>
&quot;Self-reliance,&quot; concludes John, &quot;is the antidote to institutional <br/>
stupidity.&quot; ~~ from David Albert&#39;s tribute to John Taylor Gatto ~~<br/>

MARILYN&#39;S RESPONSE<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://local.parade.com/columns/askmarilyn.lasso">http://local.parade.com/columns/askmarilyn.lasso</a><br/>
<br/>
Evidently Marilyn vos Savant received numerous letters from happy <br/>
homeschoolers, but sorry, folks, she&#39;s not convinced. She says we <br/>
didn&#39;t answer the question she asked. Here&#39;s an excerpt from her <br/>
latest response on Parade&#39;s website:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...Many home-schoolers described how well their kids are doing and <br/>
their high hopes for them, but almost no one addressed my concern <br/>
that a large percentage of the kids would never use their educations <br/>
if they became home-schoolers themselves. Gifted violinists would <br/>
never be heard in a concert hall; great leaders would never be able <br/>
to change society; brilliant scientists would never have a shot at <br/>
curing cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a question to ask yourself: Would you want to home-school your <br/>
sons and then watch them become home-schooling parents themselves <br/>
instead of having careers? This is a serious philosophical issue: If <br/>
you stay at home and teach your child rocket science, and he stays at <br/>
home and teaches his child rocket science, and he stays at home and <br/>
teaches his child rocket science, when does anyone ever become a <br/>
rocket scientist? In short, home-schooling is easy to recommend for <br/>
certain individuals, but hard to recommend for society...&quot; (e-mail: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:marilyn@...">marilyn@...</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm. Maybe she needs to talk with Madeleine Albright and Sandra Day <br/>
O&#39;Connor, who didn&#39;t homeschool their children, but who were SAHMs <br/>
for many years. Albright took her first full-time job when she was 39 <br/>
years old. Personally, I&#39;m not only homeschooling my kids, I&#39;ve <br/>
started a writing career while I&#39;ve been homeschooling, a dream of <br/>
mine since I learned to read at age 4. I plan to continue living, <br/>
working, and writing even after my kids have grown and are ruining <br/>
their kids&#39; lives by homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I must be the exception though. I assume Marilyn, being so smart and <br/>
all like she is, knows how utterly and pathetically the rest of you <br/>
are wasting your lives away. And the example you&#39;re setting for your <br/>
children! For shame! If world peace isn&#39;t attained within our <br/>
children&#39;s lifetime, we&#39;ll know exactly where to point the finger. <br/>
Homeschooling. Thanks, Marilyn. (CN)<br/>

MAKE YOUR OWN BUMPER STICKER<br/>

Having trouble finding that perfect homeschool bumper sticker? Here&#39;s <br/>
a place where you can make your own. Even if you decide not to make <br/>
your own bumper sticker, send me your ideas for great homeschool <br/>
bumper stickers and I&#39;ll include the best of them in future issues.<br/>

<br/>
Does he think the pain of school is worth a few friendships? If they <br/>
are true friendships, they will last. If not, they weren&#39;t meant to <br/>
be. With unschooling, you will be able to show him a new world, a new <br/>
side of life. And from opening up your previously enclosed circle of <br/>
life to expand to the whole world (instead of just school), you will <br/>
have the potential to develop truer friendships than your son has <br/>
ever known.<br/>
<br/>
He will be able to play with and talk to his friends without fear of <br/>
punishment for socializing. He will be able to talk about his true <br/>
passions in life, not just talk about what everyone else is talking <br/>
about. He will be able to know Who He Truly Is, share that with <br/>
friends and receive the same in return. He can even choose to not be <br/>
around someone if he doesn&#39;t want to be, or not continue a friendship <br/>
if it doesn&#39;t feel right to him...that&#39;s an empowering thing for a <br/>
child to decide for himself.<br/>
<br/>
Friendship inside of school has a totally different meaning from <br/>
friendship totally devoid of school influences, in my opinion. ~~ <br/>

GUIDE FOR PARENT/TEACHER CONFERENCES<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Reading through a recent newsletter put out by our school system, I <br/>
came across something I found quite telling. The following is an <br/>
excerpt from an article about the upcoming parent/teacher conferences:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Studies show education is enhanced when home and school work together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, how surprising. Sounds like a good argument for homeschooling to me.<br/>
<br/>
It then continued:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Questions You [the parent] May Wish to Ask:<br/>
<br/>
* What are my child&#39;s strengths?<br/>
* Is my child performing up to his/her potential?<br/>
* Is my child reading at grade level? Are his/her math skills?<br/>
* How are my child&#39;s work habits? Is he/she motivated?<br/>
* Does my child complete assignments?<br/>
* Does my child ask questions and participate in class?<br/>
* Is my child respectful of others?<br/>
* Have you noticed any major changes in my child&#39;s emotional, social, <br/>
or physical well-being?<br/>
* How can I continue to support my child&#39;s success?<br/>
* In what ways can I become more involved in my child&#39;s classroom and school?<br/>
* What opportunities are available during the summer?<br/>
* What can I do over the summer to help my child? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
At first reading, I was absolutely shocked that parents would need to <br/>
ask these questions. After all, shouldn&#39;t the parents already know <br/>
these things? Apparently not.<br/>
<br/>
After thinking about it for a while, I realized that should a school <br/>
suggest *I* needed to ask them else these questions, I&#39;d be offended. <br/>
Why on earth would the school think it was the appropriate ones to <br/>
make these judgment calls?<br/>
<br/>
The whole think sums up so well why I am a homeschooler.&quot;<br/>

HOMESCHOOLERS BUILD BRIDGES<br/>
<br/>
In the October 2001 issue of HEM&#39;s Online News, I included a couple <br/>
of bridge building contests. I received the following letter from <br/>
Cathy Bale, coordinator of the Engineering<br/>
Design Contest and a homeschool parent, about the results of one of <br/>
those contests:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am writing with an update about the West Point Bicentennial <br/>
Engineering Design Contest. See our scoreboard at <br/>
www.usma.edu/bridgecontest. Two of our finalist teams are <br/>
homeschooled students. A third team, the one from Lincoln Christian <br/>
Academy, was also homeschooled for a good portion of their <br/>
educations. More than 19,000 teams entered the contest! The <br/>
semi-final round is March 16, 2002. Hats off to homeschoolers!&quot;<br/>
