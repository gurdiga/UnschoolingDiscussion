&lt;&lt; Ben can visit anytime, he and dh go over there often.  He is now <br/>
heartbroken and has been crying all day.  I feel awful and so does dh.  But, honestly, <br/>
he hardly ever paid attention to her.  We talked about getting a dog that fit <br/>
our family better and that we found a family that she fit better in.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Get the new puppy.  Get a little puppy so you can train it in and for your <br/>
house.   <br/>
<br/>
Get him the puppy now and stop trying to reason and explain, and then he&#39;ll <br/>
be glad to let the other dog go to another house. <br/>
<br/>
Tweak it.  Say now he&#39;ll have two dogs, but one will live at the friend&#39;s <br/>
house because she likes big people who can play rough (or whatever will make him <br/>
feel empathy for the dog).<br/>
<br/>
-=- He is just saying things that really break my heart &quot;you shouldn&#39;t give <br/>
away a child&#39;s dog, that&#39;s not right.  she is part of our family and you are <br/>
just breaking the rules and giving her away.  this is the worst day of my young <br/>
life and you did this to me &quot;  -=-<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;This is the worst day of my young life&quot;!?<br/>
<br/>
Tell him dogs should have consideration too, and she has a chance to be <br/>
happier.<br/>
<br/>
Get a puppy.  <br/>
And chew toys. <br/>
Maybe a smaller breed, even.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We will probably wait a while to get the puppy, he says he doesn&#39;t want <br/>
one right now.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Callouses will form, I think.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s hurt and sad and feeling mistreated, and you don&#39;t want to correct the <br/>
original the error?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;NO, I don&#39;t want one&quot; might not be the rational part of him, it might be the <br/>
resentful, resistant part that makes him think he&#39;s hurting you in return.  <br/>
Refusing your generosity.<br/>

I can&#39;t stress enough how wonderful it was to get a puppy with young <br/>
kids. We went back and forth on whether to get an older dog (we knew we <br/>
wanted to rescue rather than go to a breeder) or put the work in with a <br/>
puppy. I finally decided that with young kids (and many rescues won&#39;t <br/>
place with young children) that I felt more comfortable with a puppy <br/>
whose buttons we would be installing ;).<br/>
<br/>
I researched and decided I wanted something Springer Spaniel-ish, and <br/>
ended up finding the puppies on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.petfinder.com">http://www.petfinder.com</a> . There was a <br/>
litter of Springer/ Lab puppies with A Forever Home Rescue in Virginia. <br/>
We ended up driving more than an hour there, twice, to get our puppy, <br/>
and she has been wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
She was only 7 weeks old when we got her, and my kids were 6, 4 and 3. <br/>
She and Sam, my youngest and the biggest reason we got her, are amazing <br/>
together. You can see a picture of him in his wolf costume wrestling <br/>
with her at my blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a> .<br/>
<br/>
It was a lot of work, and the biggest thing I worried about was <br/>
establishing her order in our pack since my kids are so little. I didn&#39;t <br/>
want her to think she was stronger or higher up than they are, so we did <br/>
a lot of work on that front in addition to basic training. I poke and <br/>
prod her, tug her ears and her tail, periodically so that if the kids do <br/>
this, she&#39;s used to it. I make sure that the kids can take her bones and <br/>
toys every once in a while. They began feeding her by hand out of her <br/>
dog bowl when she was a puppy, so she&#39;s used to them coming near her <br/>
food while she&#39;s eating. Lots of stuff like that. She still mouths the <br/>
kids when they&#39;re playing, but she&#39;s never once clamped down. She&#39;s more <br/>
likely to hurt them with her nails than anything.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t suggest a small breed, personally, with small children as <br/>
they tend to be nippier and more delicate. I wanted something big enough <br/>
to hold up to my rough and tumble kids. Our puppy is 1.5 now, and she <br/>
weighs about 65 lbs. She&#39;s taken the kids out a couple of times by <br/>
barreling through a door, so I do have to be careful about that and on <br/>
the stairs--a definite drawback. But,  Sam will get her head in a <br/>
half-nelson-like grip and take her down like he&#39;s in a rodeo! *lol* She <br/>
even sleeps on the bottom of his bed now. They are great together!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that&#39;s helpful info, Laura. FWIW, I do think you made the right <br/>
decision in the end by placing her with a family better-suited to her needs.<br/>
