<div id="ygrps-yiv-235775190">Hi all.  My name is Angela and I am mom to three kids with another on <br/>
the way this winter from China.  We are beginning our fourth year of <br/>
hsing but have decided to take the plunge and unschool.  I will still <br/>
probably be a bit more scheduled than some of you since it makes me <br/>
too nervous to cut out a math text but other than that...well, we&#39;ll <br/>
see what happens.  My question to all of you is this....how do you <br/>
ensure your children are covering all the bases and aren&#39;t missing<br/>
out <br/>
 on whole subject areas?  Do you direct their learning at all with <br/>
suggestions for the day, or do you just have lots of resources around <br/>
and let them decide?  As a former school-at-home mom (pretty much <br/>
anyway).....it&#39;s scary.  Thanks for any input you may have.<br/>
<br/>
Angela<br/>
Blessed mom of 3</div>
