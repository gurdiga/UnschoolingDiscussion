<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010744361">I found another quote at unschooling.com that pretty much sums up our<br/>
philosophy well.  I was laughing out loud when I read who wrote it!<br/>
<br/>
      For us, unschooling *is* life. Our lives are a balance of<br/>
      needs and desires, hopes and fears, love and tears, peace<br/>
      and upheaval - you name it, and it&#39;s there. Learning is a part<br/>
     of all of it, not separate from it. <br/>
<br/>
And this one from later on the same page:<br/>
<br/>
      I respect their needs, feelings and desires. I believe that<br/>
      young children&#39;s needs include being shielded from the<br/>
      responsibility of making decisions they do not yet have the<br/>
      knowledge and experience to make - things for which they<br/>
      should not have to bear the consequences - and this is my<br/>
      job as a parent. It is a tricky to job to balance our children&#39;s<br/>
      needs with their desires, especially when they can&#39;t yet see<br/>
      that they are sometimes different, or when they are<br/>
      diametrically opposed. I don&#39;t see it as coercion or<br/>
      conditional freedom, but rather as a real-life lesson in<br/>
      making decisions, guidance, parenting. From the time that<br/>
      they are able to understand the choices, they are part of the<br/>
      process.<br/>
<br/>
Man - I just love it when someone condemns me for saying the exact same<br/>
thing they do, only differently.  And then can&#39;t even see what they have<br/>
done.<br/>

Whether I agree with your unschooling or not is irrelevent, I doubt anyone <br/>
would agree with mine and thats ok because I/We live for us in that respect <br/>
:) I do admire your perseverence (sp?) in that you have stayed and not get <br/>
nasty and then leave :) Also, I think you have brought up a great <br/>
discussion, I have enjoyed reading this thread.<br/>

It certainl seems so.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re reading other things.<br/>
<br/>
Now maybe for your next assignment (because you DO really want you to <br/>
practice what you preach, and a certain amount of work should be done each <br/>
week, right?) you could try reading some of unschooling.com for a purpose <br/>
OTHER than to find quotes to justify yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Holding your breath and waiting for the world to make you right is WAY more <br/>
work than letting that breath out, taking a deep, cleansing breath and seeing <br/>
if any sweetness and new ideas can flow in.<br/>
<br/>
Someday you&#39;ll probably want to change the way you&#39;re being with your kids.  <br/>
If you&#39;re too adamant now, it will be harder when that time comes.  The more <br/>
you defend yourself about questionable choices, the harder it will be for you <br/>
to consider whether they&#39;re good or bad.  The more open you are to learning, <br/>
the better example you&#39;ll set for your totally unschooled children. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-703913861">Brigette....Are you running on adrenalin just now?<br/>
Your posts are getting a little frantic, as if you are<br/>
producing ketones. The substances that your body makes<br/>
when stressed can alter the way information is<br/>
perceived. <br/>
<br/>
If I may ask, what is the serious health problem you<br/>
suffer from that you have referred to? Fatigue can&#39;t<br/>
be good for you. It IS possible to get so tired you<br/>
can&#39;t rest. <br/>

I live with three teen-agers, a 9 year old and 2 other adults, I&#39;m<br/>
distracted a lot!.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve gotten plenty of sleep this week, thanks.  My medical history is<br/>
extensive.<br/>
In 1996 I had a bout of Guillaun-Barre.  I was down for about 6 months. <br/>
It was a very mild case, I never needed an iron lung or anything but it<br/>
was sever enough to keep me bedridden for better than three months,<br/>
unable to lift a jug of milk for more than 6 months and just plain week<br/>
for a year.  That was during our first full year of homeschooling. <br/>
Rachel was 11, Jenni was 9 and Wyndham was 4.  The girls learned a lot<br/>
that year, like cooking and cleaning and caring for me!  Which was good<br/>
practice for 1998.  In November of 1998 I was take by ambulance to the<br/>
hospital where they diagnosed an acute asthma attack.  Unfortunately what<br/>
they should have diagnosed was a pulmonary embolism.  Had they done that<br/>
they may have prevented the heart attack I jad two days later when I was<br/>
coming out of the coma.  Several months later, my cardiologist tried to<br/>
withdraw my blood thinners.  I developed arterial clots in my legs within<br/>
weeks.  So now I am on blood thinners for life.  It took a long time to<br/>
recover from the heart attack and I still have diminished fumction in my<br/>
lower left ventrical and probably always will.  It is very unlikely to<br/>
recover more function this late after the event, or so they tell me.<br/>
Meanwhile, I worked myself into a major depression last year and now am<br/>
not working because I need to be home for a while.  I understand the<br/>
effects of stress and despite how you think I sound, I am not stressing<br/>
over this conversation.  In fact, it has added a new joke to the Coffman<br/>
repertoire.  Now any time we see anyone being a parent - anything from<br/>
stopping a toddler from running out into the road to telling a child he<br/>
has to leave the park and go home now - we say - oops, they can&#39;t be<br/>
unschoolers!  Goes right along with our other joke - anyone showing a<br/>
belly button in public must be a slut.<br/>
So if nothing else, thanks for the new joke!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would I want to change how I am with my kids?  The only way to go<br/>
from here is more strict.  Well, I suppose I could leave the house<br/>
entirely.  My role in this household is as the organizer.  I am the one<br/>
who knows where things are and when we are supposed to do things.  I take<br/>
care of the household so others can do their things freely.  My children<br/>
have very few rules other than that they are not allowed to pursue<br/>
destructive behavior.  That means something different for each child. <br/>
Jenni can hole up in her room for a week at a time and do whatever and<br/>
that is fine.  It is not fine if Rachel does it.  They are different<br/>
children with different needs and problems.  The fact that I recognize<br/>
that allows the family to run smoothly.  The fact that you can&#39;t<br/>
recognize the fact that different children may need different things in<br/>
order to unschool successfully is only going to push more people away<br/>
from it, not draw us toward it.  Especially when the first thing they<br/>
hear when they come here amounts to &quot;go away.&quot;<br/>
