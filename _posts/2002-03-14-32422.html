<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070257603">Every experience reaches us into our subconcious. <br/>
Wether it lowers our moral behavior is a differnt<br/>
question.  That depends on the child.  Here is an<br/>
example of what I mean .  Some children watch power<br/>
rangers and parents became very huffy because of the<br/>
physical activy, they called violence.  When I asked<br/>
children about what they thought of it I recieved so<br/>
many different responses.  Some children took to the<br/>
phsical activity and others didn&#39;t.  One child told me<br/>
he liked it because sometimes he like to kick the<br/>
people that hurt children and scince he can&#39;t he can<br/>
at least watch the t.v. and just imagine.<br/>
In regards to the question of Unguided tv.  depends on<br/>
the child if he can differtiate between acting and<br/>
real world. <br/>

** Serenity now ** Serenity now ** -- I remember that one. :) Think I&#39;ll try <br/>
it as my mantra today.<br/>
<br/>
You have an interesting question about TV viewing. I think about this when <br/>
the circus comes to town. (I hate the circus, but that&#39;s not my point.) I <br/>
wonder if kids are as excited about the circus as kids used to be or if it&#39;s <br/>
a big yawn because of the action and excitement they&#39;ve been exposed to from <br/>
other sources. (TV, video games, movies.)<br/>
<br/>
We live &quot;back in the woods&quot;. No cable. As I said in an earlier post, my kids <br/>
have no limits or rules concerning TV or Nintendo or computer. But they don&#39;t <br/>
spend much time watching TV, they play Nintendo some, but ... I don&#39;t know. <br/>
My boys are 8 and 9. They move with the speed of light from one activity to <br/>
another. They skate in our basement, ride bikes on the trails and build forts <br/>
in the woods and read lots of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; and &quot;Captain Underpants&quot;. <br/>
And have friends over regularly. Some days, they&#39;re on the computer for hours <br/>
playing Neopets. Other days, they don&#39;t even look at the computer. And they <br/>
eat an amazing amount of whatever-they-want, but don&#39;t carry an ounce of fat. <br/>
&quot;Self regulating&quot; seems to work for them!<br/>
<br/>
Hey -- I envy them! Anyway, this is our family -- what works for us. My <br/>
daughter is 14. She&#39;s fantastic. Unschooling has made the biggest difference <br/>
in her life. (We pulled her out of school three years ago.) TV is not an <br/>
issue with her either. She likes that show -- what is it? -- medical examiner <br/>
-- um -- &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;. Sometimes we watch it together, sometimes she <br/>
watches it in her room. I have to get her some Patricia Cornwell and see if <br/>
she likes those.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. This is boring, huh? Anyhoo ... just our story ...<br/>

<br/>
Honestly, no. I think tv gets extremely boring after sometime but then you move on to the next activity. Amazingly my sons have learned quite a lot lately watching Pokemon!  <br/>
<br/>
The one thing I can say is that ALL children are different, they all need different things and do different things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-643511536">I also don&#39;t think that TV lowers the bar on moral behavior on a mentally &<br/>
physically healthy human being. I believe that for most people (most being<br/>
99% rather than 51%) TV is a perfectly innocuous tool. I hate commercials,<br/>
because their JOB is to make me feel inadequate and want what they tell me I<br/>
need. I am not a big TV person by my standards, from my best friend&#39;s<br/>
standards I probably watch way too much! But that is more in the time<br/>
watching TV rather than the content. I believe that there is far MORE good<br/>
content than bad (bad meaning things that make me sad, angry, insecure etc.)<br/>
I tend to be a sitcom person becasue I like the humor. I like Star Trek: TNG<br/>
becasue it si pretty unreal. I am not a fan of the new reality series but my<br/>
14 yo LOVES them. (I guess COPS is reality based, more so than Love cruise<br/>
(or as I call it floating codependant orgy show)<br/>
I strongly believe that humans will naturally gravitate towards things that<br/>
make them feel BETTER about themselves and their lives and if TV makes them<br/>
feel bad, they will eventually accept that and move on to other things, some<br/>
people may take longer than others but barring any negative influences, they<br/>
will move on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it can desensitize people.  It can feed fear - the crime stats<br/>
show that lots of major crimes are lower in number, yet most people feel<br/>
less safe.  Why?  Could it be that the local nightly news finds the most<br/>
gruesome story they can to lead off their newscast? (Even if they have to<br/>
find it hundreds of miles away...)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t allow unguided TV watching for my children.  They mostly watch<br/>
PBS kids and Nick Jr. shows.  If there are other shows on that we don&#39;t<br/>
consider harmful, they can see them - Megan watched Modern Masters on<br/>
HGTV last night.  I don&#39;t let her watch much Carol Duvall though since<br/>
Carol is such a &quot;poor, incompetent me&quot; person (or was the last time I<br/>
watched it).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this falls into some realm of age-appropriateness.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid can understand the difference between actors, storylines and <br/>
hollywood, and you have discussed this understanding, then TV is an <br/>
awesome tool to enhance one&#39;s imagination.<br/>
<br/>
If a child can&#39;t determine the difference, then the scope of what they <br/>
watched might need to be limited.<br/>
<br/>
When 911 happened, and we live in NYC, my son was 5. We never told him it <br/>
was real. At that age, it wasn&#39;t necessary to allow that fear into his <br/>
life. His fears are limited to crossing the street and possibility of <br/>
kidnappings BUT not at the price of being allowed to live and play like <br/>
children should. In other words it isn&#39;t the main crux of our outings, <br/>
but he needs to know they exist.<br/>
<br/>
I remember either reading, or hearing on TV a mom saying that her 5yo saw <br/>
the 911 clips and said &#39;how cool!&#39; so she was upset and preceeded to tell <br/>
him of all the kids that lost their parents and the tragedy behind it etc.<br/>
<br/>
This sounded wrong, IMNSHO, for the reasons that this child didn&#39;t need <br/>
to know this. He didn&#39;t need to bring it into his world YET. I felt very <br/>
sad for that child.<br/>
<br/>
When we watch adult type TV or sci-fi, fantasy etc, my son and I always <br/>
talk about it being actors, or special effects and we talk about how the <br/>
camera might do something. And with this, he doesn&#39;t seem to be affected <br/>
by it. We watch the movie Xmen and talk about it as fantasy. Same with <br/>
LOTR and other cool shows.<br/>
<br/>
*Although* he seems to be bothered by the fact that the Trix kids never <br/>
share with the Rabbit; we might have to write a letter to the company <br/>
about that *smile*.<br/>
<br/>
The only news we do talk about, since he doesnt&#39; watch it, is the ones <br/>
that affects him at this age. As he gets older, that will expand along <br/>
with his ability to move about the town.<br/>
<br/>

One good example is medical personnel.  The first time they see someone<br/>

it is no longer as traumatic and for some folks not traumatic at all.<br/>

I have a different view point on this, I think that each child should be &#39;looked&#39; (for lack of of a better word) at individually. My youngest couldn&#39;t handle seeing something such as 9/11 or even Monsters Inc., he is just sensitive and gets scared easily. My older son however has seen things, such as Star Wars or 9/11 and is able to process the information in a different way. He talks through a lot of things. He to this day still talks about the fire we had over a year ago, they are just different. For us, it would have felt wrong to not let him know the truth (instead of him just seeing that his mommy was upset and not knowing why).<br/>

Could you explain to me what you mean by desensitizing? What I am taking from it is that if you see it is easier to do it (?). Like if a child played gun play it would be easier to kill someone...<br/>

Seeing cars crash into each other, like Monster Truck Derby or something of the sort is not going to make you think most people, especially children, think &#39;oh cool&#39; when they see a car crash in real life. I just don&#39;t agree with that at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950797339">I was referring to shows such as cops, not going to the local fairgrounds<br/>
and watching Big Foot or a demolition derby.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another example of desensitizing.  If you grow up in some large<br/>
Italian or Irish families, screaming, hollering, yelling, arguing, etc. are<br/>
the norm.  You don&#39;t even notice when someone raises their voices.  You are<br/>
desensitized.  If you bring someone into that type family who has been<br/>
raised in a quiet, mellow-type family, they notice every little inflection<br/>
and frequently think folks must hate each other.<br/>

I&#39;m really not picking here but again I disagree. I grew up in just that family, and it had nothing to do with being Greek. My mother was just abusive, and luckily for me it did not desensitize me, it actually helped me to be a better parent for my children.<br/>

Here&#39;s another example of desensitizing.  If you grow up in some large<br/>
Italian or Irish families, screaming, hollering, yelling, arguing, etc. are<br/>
the norm.  You don&#39;t even notice when someone raises their voices.  You are<br/>
desensitized.  If you bring someone into that type family who has been<br/>
raised in a quiet, mellow-type family, they notice every little inflection<br/>
and frequently think folks must hate each other.<br/>

&gt; Of course it does.  Anyone who says any different doesn&#39;t want to face<br/>
&gt; reality.  yes you can sit and discuss things with kids and supposedly that<br/>
&gt; helps them but if they see death in one form or another or violence in one<br/>
&gt; form or another on a daily basis, it desensitizes them to the real<br/>
thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Could you explain to me what you mean by desensitizing? What I am taking<br/>
from it is that if you see it is easier to do it (?). Like if a child played<br/>
gun play it would be easier to kill someone...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you see car chases on television and they are &quot;fun&quot; and everyone is<br/>
&gt; getting excited by them, &quot;wow, look at that,&quot; &quot;ooooh, they almost<br/>
crashed,&quot;<br/>
&gt; etc., the real thing is not going to be as dramatic.  If you have never<br/>
seen<br/>
&gt; a car crash and witness one for the first time IRL, it is dramatic, no<br/>
&gt; punches pulled.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seeing cars crash into each other, like Monster Truck Derby or something<br/>
of the sort is not going to make you think most people, especially children,<br/>
think &#39;oh cool&#39; when they see a car crash in real life. I just don&#39;t agree<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373691609">Kara, being loud has nothing to do with being abusive.  The Italian and<br/>
Irish families I grew up around (same applies to the ones hubby grew up in<br/>
and around on the opposite coast) were definately not abusive.  They were<br/>
simply loud and never noticed that they were loud.<br/>
<br/>
And, again, everyone is an individual.  &quot;Some&quot; react that way but the<br/>
majority, in your situation, grow up to be abusers since they were<br/>
desensitized to it and think it is the norm.<br/>
<br/>
So you are the exception to the rule, which is good!<br/>
