&lt;&lt; One <br/>
<br/>
of his first toys as a baby was an &quot;anatomically correct&quot; boy doll <br/>
<br/>
with an intact penis (had to search for that one!). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s boy had an intact penis, and that was cool, but his navel was tied <br/>
off VERY strangely.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s female baby doll was from Discovery Toys and cost $50.<br/>
Marty&#39;s was bought from an ad in TV Guide and cost $10.   Well...<br/>
It was scary-ugly, and came from China where it seems maybe they fold the <br/>
navel back and forth and tie the bundle.  That&#39;s okay.  You could choose which <br/>
race your child would be, but they were all Chinese with just a different color <br/>
of plastic.<br/>
<br/>
After years of Caucasian dolls turnabout was fair. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago Holly bought an anatomically correct female baby with her own <br/>
money from a catalog that came to our house.  Before we bought this house it <br/>
was being used as a halfway house for mental health from the university <br/>
hospital, so we get catalogs still sometimes advertising educational supplies for <br/>
teaching people about substance abuse and human sexuality and reproduction.<br/>
<br/>
So we have three anatomically correct dolls.  One&#39;s missing an arm now.  Too <br/>
much hugging, and the arms weren&#39;t made to bend out, just up and down.  Maybe <br/>
the &quot;anatomical correctness&quot; needs to extend to joints and not just external <br/>
genetalia.<br/>

This is really funny to me. When Tara was very small, she fell in love with<br/>
this baby doll from Toys R Us. It was anatomically correct and a female. She<br/>
had to have it. So she did and named it Amy. Ugliest thing I ever saw. Tara<br/>
loved that baby doll. We still have Amy and every child since has had some<br/>
period of loving that ugly little baby. Of course her name has changed but<br/>
she will always be Amy to Tara and me. She must be about 16 years old now.<br/>
(the doll)<br/>
Alyssa has her now and loves that doll. She&#39;s a hard plastic and not at all<br/>
cuddly like some of the other baby dolls around the house. But still<br/>
Alyssa&#39;s favorite. Anyway, she loses an arm every now and then. Darn thing<br/>
just won&#39;t stay on. I have tried everything to make it stay short of gluing<br/>
it and every time I go into the girls room, the arm is laying on the floor<br/>
and Amy&#39;s little armless body is laying beside it.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is broke on it, just loose I imagine. Ideas welcome as to how to fix<br/>
it. Amy will be with us for a long time I imagine.<br/>

Have you tried stretching elastic in a loop through the inner shoulder<br/>
across and through the other arm? This is the way some of the arms are held<br/>
together on some of Jayn&#39;s ceramic dolls and the arms still move. These ones<br/>
have holes in the porcelain for the purpose. You might be able to make holes<br/>
in the plastic to hold the elastic depending on the shape and the hardness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429315199">I never thought of that. I know the Asian Cabbage Patch dolls we have has<br/>
arms connected like that by thread.<br/>
<br/>
Amys arms are hard plastic and then where if fits in to the doll, it&#39;s<br/>
threaded in both places like a screw. I&#39;ll have to look at it and see if the<br/>
elastic thing is possible. Thanks for the idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-58947591">We, too, have a hideous looking doll (passed down a generation) named <br/>
Sally that my boys love.  Her plastic body has faded patchy spots, <br/>
her blond hair feels (and looks) like straw and is matted together, <br/>
and she is missing several of her fingers.  The funny thing is, my <br/>
niece, who is now 20 years old, also loved that doll, as did her <br/>
mother (though Sally probably looked better way back then).  Maybe <br/>
people aren&#39;t as appearance-oriented as &quot;experts&quot; would have us <br/>
believe, or perhaps people don&#39;t start out that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello, I have been quiet for a while, enjoying my munchkins for Spring Break. <br/>
 I can&#39;t wait until Kindergarten is over!!!  Anyway, just catching up on <br/>
posts and had to add to this.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a doll like this many moons ago and she too, had a floppy, not too <br/>
determined to stay-on arm.  I found this doll during my parents&#39; move last year.  <br/>
I went to a thrift store (luckily the first one had what I needed for about <br/>
$1.50), I got a doll with a similar shape and size and popped her arm off and <br/>
replaced the old one, it works like new now and very close to the same color and <br/>
amazingly the hand mold is a very close match.  I guess the notch and the <br/>
piece that goes into the socket fit more tightly cuz it&#39;s not as worn out and now <br/>
she/he (over the years it was both) can be hugged tightly again :0).<br/>
