<br/>
                                   1) No known species of reindeer can fly. But it is estimated that there are<br/>
300,000 species of<br/>
                                   living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects<br/>
and germs, this does<br/>
                                   not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer, which only Santa has ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
                                   2) There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world. But since<br/>
Santa doesn&#39;t<br/>
                                   (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that<br/>
reduces the<br/>
                                   workload to 15% of the total ? 378 million according to the Population<br/>
Reference Bureau. At<br/>
                                   an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that&#39;s 91.8 million<br/>
homes. One<br/>
                                   presumes there&#39;s at least one good child in each.<br/>
<br/>
                                   3) Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different<br/>
time zones and the<br/>
                                   rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems<br/>
logical). This works out<br/>
                                   to 822.6 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian<br/>
household with good<br/>
                                   children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh,<br/>
jump down the<br/>
                                   chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the<br/>
tree, eat whatever<br/>
                                   snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh<br/>
and move on to the<br/>
                                   next house.<br/>
<br/>
                                   Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed<br/>
around the earth<br/>
                                   (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purposes of our<br/>
calculations we will<br/>
                                   accept), we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of<br/>
75-1/2 million miles,<br/>
                                   not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31<br/>
hours, plus feeding,<br/>
                                   etc. This means that Santa&#39;s sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second,<br/>
3,000 times the speed<br/>
                                   of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle, the<br/>
Ulysses space<br/>
                                   probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second ? a conventional reindeer can<br/>
run, tops, 15<br/>
                                   miles per hour.<br/>
<br/>
                                   4) The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming<br/>
that each child gets<br/>
                                   nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh is<br/>
carrying 321,300 tons,<br/>
                                   not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land,<br/>
conventional reindeer<br/>
                                   can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that &quot;flying reindeer&quot; (see<br/>
point #1) could<br/>
                                   pull ten times the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even<br/>
nine. We need<br/>
                                   214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not even counting the weight<br/>
of the sleigh ? to<br/>
                                   353,430 tons. Again, for comparison ? this is four times the weight of the<br/>
Queen Elizabeth.<br/>
<br/>
                                   5) 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air<br/>
resistance ? this will<br/>
                                   heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft re-entering the<br/>
earth&#39;s atmosphere. The<br/>
                                   lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy, per<br/>
second,.each. In<br/>
                                   short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the<br/>
reindeer behind them,<br/>
                                   and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team<br/>
will be vaporized<br/>
                                   within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to<br/>
centrifugal forces<br/>
                                   17,500.06 times greater than gravity.<br/>
<br/>
                                   A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the<br/>
back of his sleigh<br/>
                                   by 4,315,015 pounds of force.<br/>
<br/>
                                   In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he&#39;s<br/>
dead now.!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819294434">Very funny.  But the engineer forgot to calculate in that not all Christian <br/>
children believe in Santa.  Spanish-the magi bring gifts on Ephiphany <br/>
Sunday. Italian-An old woman (I forget her name) brings gifts.<br/>
Some Christians-parents or the Christ Child brings gifts.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve <br/>
forgotten some.  Different cultures receive their gifts on different days. <br/>
St. Nicholas Day, Ephiphany Sunday and the Ukrainian Christmas aren&#39;t on <br/>
12/25.  Given all this, I&#39;d say that the numbers of deliveries are greatly <br/>
reduced, thereby changing the calculations.<br/>
Animals other than reindeer are believed to be used in other countries, so <br/>
the reindeer can rest or be replaced.  By the way, all the reindeer are <br/>
female, since male reindeer shed their antlers in the fall and females in <br/>
the spring.<br/>
