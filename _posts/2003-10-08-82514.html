<div id="ygrps-yiv-521025659">Hi<br/>
<br/>
Oh great!  Lanora has been talking a LOT about how she wants to talk and<br/>
visit with Elizabeth.  In fact, we were talking about how much we both like<br/>
your whole family, Lanora&#39;s words &quot;Just really nice people&quot;.  She meant all<br/>
of you, I agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Lanora&#39;s email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kimono@...">kimono@...</a> and her AIM screen name is<br/>
&quot;xDarkPurity&quot; (whatever that means, LOL).  She will probably be going online<br/>
to chat tonight at about 7:30pm.  I think Sandra Dodd&#39;s daughter, Holly,<br/>
will be coming on too, I think the three of them would really enjoy each<br/>
other.  Other than that, Lanora is on most nights until the wee hours, she<br/>
uses several different chatting programs and she can fill Elizabeth in on<br/>
those if she uses them too.  She&#39;ll be on AIM for sure tonight tho.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all are doing well, looking forward to seeing you at the party.<br/>
BTW, what can I bring?<br/>
<br/>
Kris<br/>
