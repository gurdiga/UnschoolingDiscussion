I thought Deb&#39;s response was just brilliant and wanted to share it  here.<br/>
 <br/>

***When I took him to the car he told me that he wanted to sit on  my<br/>
lap.***<br/>
<br/>
You made groceries more important than your baby.   That sounds harsh but<br/>
I hope you can think about this in a new way.<br/>
<br/>
He  needed you.  For some reason he needed to sit on your lap and be  close<br/>
to you.  Maybe he had a hard time at your mom&#39;s.  Maybe he  was longing for<br/>
you.  Maybe he needed some close time to transition from  the activity at<br/>
your mom&#39;s house to  going home.  He needed you and  you decided milk was<br/>
more important than what he needed. <br/>
<br/>
What if  you&#39;d held him?  What if he was happy after ten minutes.  The<br/>
milk  would have been ok.  What if he wanted you to hold him for  forty<br/>
minutes?   The milk might have still been ok, but what if it  wasn&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
What if you had to go by more milk?  The price of milk is  not greater<br/>
than your son&#39;s comfort and happiness. <br/>
Surely you&#39;ve &quot;wasted&quot;  a few dollars on something that would brighten<br/>
your day, a new lipstick or  nail polish or something.  Your son needed a<br/>
moment of brightness with  you. <br/>
<br/>
If your other son was with you maybe he could have run the  perishables in<br/>
to your mom&#39;s fridge until you were ready to go.   <br/>
<br/>
***I told him that when he hurt my feelings like that it made me not  want<br/>
to buy him something. ***<br/>
<br/>
And when you hurt his feelings by not  being available to him he didn&#39;t<br/>
know what to do.  He reacted like a  three year old who didn&#39;t really know<br/>
how to tell his mom he needed some  closeness and comfort. <br/>
<br/>
***How should I handle these outbursts of  anger.  This is a new thing for<br/>
him in the last couple <br/>
of  months.***<br/>
<br/>
Try to be as understanding as you can.  Try to think  about what led to<br/>
him feeling so angry and frustrated.  We all get  angry, and almost no one<br/>
gets angry for no reason.  See if you can  identify the things that lead<br/>
to his frustration and head them off.   Listen to him.  He&#39;s trying so<br/>
hard to communicate with you!  He&#39;s  only had a few years on this planet,<br/>
speaking this language and trying to  understand how things work.  He<br/>
needs your help when things aren&#39;t going  right.  <br/>
<br/>
It is hard to be little and to want to do things a little  body or little<br/>
hands just aren&#39;t able to do yet.  It&#39;s hard to not be  able to express<br/>
yourself in terms other people clearly understand and  respect.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s tired and needs some quiet time in the  rocking chair with you.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s out of energy and needs a snack.  He  might not recognize the<br/>
symptoms of those things and so, can&#39;t express that  to you.  <br/>
Maybe he wants some sympathy when things are going wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard being a mom and especially a mom who&#39;s trying so hard<br/>
to  get everything right.  If you can remember he isn&#39;t trying to hurt<br/>
your  feelings or make your life harder, he&#39;s just trying to communicate<br/>
some need  or problem he has and he doesn&#39;t have all the skills to do that<br/>
yet.  If  you can think about that it will help you be more patient with<br/>
him.  He  wants to be happy and he wants you to be happy with him.  Our<br/>
society  portrays kids as working against their parents and it just isn&#39;t<br/>
so.  I  think in so many ways parents are conditioned to think of their<br/>
kids as  adversaries.  You don&#39;t have to.  You can think of him as  someone<br/>
who loves you and needs you a lot right now.  Someone who wants  to be<br/>
happy and feel good about himself and his mom.  If you think of  the<br/>
situation as both of you having the same goal you can work with him  to<br/>
find solutions instead of feeling like your working against him.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598976555">Thanks Kelly for posting this here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Deb for a fantastic post. I love the reminder that our kids have only spent a few <br/>
years on this planet and are still trying to figure things out. Our job is to help them.<br/>
<br/>
Great stuff.<br/>
