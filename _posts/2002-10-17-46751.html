Sandra, I can only imagine what it must cost you to sit there at your <br/>
computer and type when you must be in great discomfort, but the sound I <br/>
heard was the collective sigh of relief to once again have access to the <br/>
marvelous pro-child perspective you give to nearly everything.<br/>
<br/>
Please take care of yourself!!<br/>
<br/>
Lots of love,<br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s not that bad.  I&#39;m in the wheelchair with the keyboard on my lap.<br/>
Last night I lasted an hour.<br/>
This morning two hours. <br/>
This time, I took meds, ate, and came in here, partly to check on details of <br/>
a funeral and to call a couple of people.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m winding down, though.  I&#39;ll go back to the couch and probably watch TV <br/>
with Holly or read or sleep or all three, serially and randomly.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks you all for the kind words here an on the side and phone calls.  I&#39;ll <br/>
be living dangerously again by Christmas I&#39;m sure.  <br/>

This is great!<br/>
I am way behind on messages, was gone for a long weekend.  But I hear the sigh and feel it.  I will go back and read.<br/>
Take Care everyone, Sandra especially,<br/>
