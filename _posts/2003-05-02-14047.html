<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086376561">When I got my learners permit (which is a laminated photo ID card here just <br/>
like a real license, I know in some places it&#39;s not) at 16 I was sitting in <br/>
the hall during drivers ed one day playing cards with a friend and we were <br/>
admiring our learners permit and we noticed mine said I was male!<br/>
<br/>
Someone along the line had made a typo, checked the wrong box or something <br/>
and I was suddenly male although the picture of me on the card looked <br/>
surprisingly female.  We joked a lot about it during drives ed.  When I went <br/>
to take my drivers test and get my lisence I casually remarked to the lady <br/>
behind the desk that &quot;Oh, by the way it says I&#39;m male but I&#39;m really not&quot; <br/>
thinking it would be a simple matter of checking the right box.<br/>
<br/>
But it was no laughing matter to them and they had to contact the main <br/>
office in Olympia and have it changed all legally.  Delayed my getting my <br/>
lisence for a week or so.<br/>
<br/>
We still joke about my sex change I had at 16 :)  And I still have the <br/>
learners permit lying around to prove I was once legally male (however <br/>
breifly ) :)<br/>

&quot;Oh!  Oh!!  I was still growing at one point in my life, and when I got a<br/>
learner&#39;s permit I was 5&#39;4&quot; so when I went in for my real license, I just<br/>
said 5&#39;5&quot; assuming NATURALLY I had grown in that time.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hadn&#39;t.  So the next time I got it renewed I was honest and said <br/>
that<br/>
should be 5&#39;4&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So for a while I was 5&#39;5&quot; just as surely as if a judge had changed my birth<br/>
parents.  Government papers.  *LUV*<br/>
<br/>
When Keith signed up for the draft he obnoxiously put his height in inches<br/>
and his weight in kilograms (72&quot; and 108 kg.) and they didn&#39;t notice so they<br/>
put 7&#39;4&quot; and 108 lbs.  Who could draft a giraffish giant like that!?<br/>

HOW cool. <br/>
Y&#39;d think you could&#39;ve just set a mirror on the floor and SHOWN her! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
