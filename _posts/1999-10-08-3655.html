<div id="ygrps-yiv-118819890">Tami,No harm here.� How wonderful for you to be able to breastfeed two of your kids!<br/>
Andi<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Andi,<br/>
&gt; ��� I sure hope that I wasn&#39;t demeaning in any way when I talked of<br/>
&gt; breastfeeding.<br/>
&gt; As I have said, I did not nurse my first two children (I also had alot of<br/>
&gt; difficulties in trying to nurse my first one).� However, I was finally able<br/>
&gt; to nurse my last two children.� This has made me very excited about nursing,<br/>
&gt; but I do not look down on those women who do not nurse.� Most of my friends<br/>
&gt; did not, as it was not as popular when we were having children.� The health<br/>
&gt; difference that I pointed out was between my own four children.� My first two<br/>
&gt; were sick alot with colds, allergies, ear infections etc.� My last two were<br/>
&gt; not sick much at all.� To me, that was a big blessing!!� My oldest was sick<br/>
&gt; so often with ear infections, that he couldn&#39;t even hear or talk for the<br/>
&gt; first 4 years of his life.� We were in the doctors office every time we<br/>
&gt; turned around.� That is exhausting!!!� I was thrilled when we didn&#39;t have to<br/>
&gt; go through that again!<br/>
&gt; ���� I am sorry for all your problems with miscarriage.� I also had<br/>
&gt; miscarriages after our fourth child, and I know how devastating that can be.<br/>
&gt; ���� Blessings to you and your beautiful 6 yr. old daughter :-)<br/>
&gt; Tami<br/>
