 worth a new sheet of paper.&quot; Ouch. Not the message I wanted to send. I<br/>
 think that high-quality art supplies send the message that, &quot;What you are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17227125">Kimberly,<br/>
You will need two frames, like picture frames at least 8x10.  I made<br/>
frames out of old yard sticks, but I see them cheep at the dollar store<br/>
sometimes and they would work too.  You will need a dish pan, I actually<br/>
use a kitty liter pan ( never used for kitty )  because it&#39;s a little<br/>
bigger and works better, I think.<br/>
<br/>
On one of the frames staple a piece of window screen so that it covers<br/>
the opening of the frame.  This is the mold and the other frame is the<br/>
deckle.  You want to staple the screen to the back of a store bought<br/>
frame ( on the flat part ) <br/>
<br/>
Tear up pieces of used paper, paper towels or even vegetable fibers. (<br/>
onion skins )  Get creative if you want and add a little paint or food<br/>
coloring.  Different vegetable fibers add a little color too.  Put the<br/>
paper into a blender with some water and pulverize it.  The goo you make<br/>
is called a slurry.  Fill the dishpan part way with water and pour in the<br/>
slurry.  Hold your mold, screen side up,  put the deckle on top of it. <br/>
Holding the mold and deckle together dip them into the slurry.  Hold them<br/>
level and lift them out.  This is where you just have to experiment.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter if you have too much on the screen but it can matter if<br/>
you have too little.   The mash on the screen is called the wet leaf. <br/>
Set the mold and deckle on a piece of news paper, and remove the deckle. <br/>
Put a piece of newspaper on top of the wet leaf to act as a blotter. <br/>
Turn the mold and newspaper blotter over and lay them face down on the<br/>
table.  Use a sponge to blot up any excess water through the screen. <br/>
Lift off the mold and put another newspaper blotter on the wet leaf.   <br/>
After a few minutes, remove the blotters and iron the wet leaf  dry.  <br/>
Save the news papers.  They dry and can be used again and again as<br/>
blotters, or they can be added to your slurry  some time.  It sounds like<br/>
a lot of work but really it goes fast.  You can make several batches of<br/>
slurry and a pile of paper in no time.  Just keep adding new slurry to<br/>
your dish pan until you have enough paper.  <br/>
We add all kinds of interesting things on top of the wet leaf before we<br/>
blot.  Flower petals, onion skins, pepper, nutmeg, pine needles,<br/>
whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
If you find that ink runs too much on your paper, dissolve some elmers<br/>
glue in water and add it to the slurry in the dish pan.  <br/>
<br/>
Last time, we sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the wet leaf and it turned<br/>
out very interesting.  (  Beware of dogs! )  We might make our Christmas<br/>
cards this way.<br/>
<br/>
The left over slurry can be squeezed out, rolled into balls and left in a<br/>
sunny window sill to dry.  They make great kitty toys.  <br/>
<br/>
Have fun.<br/>

&gt; Ohhh.  We haven&#39;t made lint bowls in a long time because the cats always<br/>
&gt; try to EAT them !!!  Maybe it&#39;s the glue?  You can make them with sugar<br/>
&gt; instead of glue but then the little kids try to eat them!  ( Maybe I need<br/>
&gt; that recipe swap too )<br/>

&gt; &gt; We make all kinds of paper out of old newspapers and junk mail. They<br/>
&gt; &gt; way we<br/>
&gt; &gt; do it and it may not be the right way, but is our way :) We tear the<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; paper(you can use any kind/color texture) up in small pieces, add a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; water blend it and pour on to an old screen to dry. We also make<br/>
&gt; &gt; dryer lint<br/>
&gt; &gt; bowls(use dryer lint and glue, to make a from use wax/plastic wrap<br/>
&gt; &gt; to cover<br/>
&gt; &gt; an existing bowl then put the lint on it), dryer lint paper, paper<br/>
&gt; &gt; from old<br/>

<br/>
Thanks....I never thought of the iron!  What a good<br/>
use for it as I seldom iron the laundry! I do iron<br/>
sewing projects and wrapping paper. Actually  the iron<br/>
gets used for lots of stuff....I keep the ironing<br/>
board set up all the time. Still for homemade<br/>
paper...WHAT A GOOD IDEA!!<br/>

I know what you mean!  I never iron laundry because there&#39;s usually so<br/>
much junk on the ironing board, and some unidentifiable goo on the iron.<br/>
We also press fall leaves between two pieces of waxed paper.  The heat<br/>
from the iron adheres some of the wax to the leaves and preserves them<br/>
for a short time.  You can leave them in the waxed paper, or peal it<br/>
away.  The leaves last quite a while this way.  <br/>
Also my son chunks crayon onto paper, lays waxed paper on top and presses<br/>
the picture with the iron.  It&#39;s a beautiful effect, like encaustic, but<br/>
quick.  <br/>
<br/>
One other thing we tried this summer, slightly off topic, was splatter<br/>
painting.  We laid an old bed sheet on a sheet of plywood on  the grass, <br/>
filled water balloons with paint,  ( we used regular, acrylic house paint<br/>
)  climbed the ladder and KER SPLAT !   Hideously messy, but fun.  You<br/>
can get large feeding syringes at the vet clinic, with  plastic curved<br/>
tips.  You can easily draw up the paint and fill the balloons.  We found<br/>
assorted old paints at a garage sale, so the project was cheap.  Jackson<br/>
Pollock has nothing on us!  Just remember, you then have to be willing to<br/>
USE this work of art around the house.  This can be tricky.<br/>

&gt; Love Jackson Pollock!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen the same ideas with hanging a sheet on the clothes line and<br/>
&gt; squiring with waterGUNS (oh no) filled with paint.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Sharon,<br/>
&gt; &gt;I know what you mean!  I never iron laundry because there&#39;s usually so<br/>
&gt; &gt;much junk on the ironing board, and some unidentifiable goo on the iron.<br/>
&gt; &gt;We also press fall leaves between two pieces of waxed paper.  The heat<br/>
&gt; &gt;from the iron adheres some of the wax to the leaves and preserves them<br/>
&gt; &gt;for a short time.  You can leave them in the waxed paper, or peal it<br/>
&gt; &gt;away.  The leaves last quite a while this way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Also my son chunks crayon onto paper, lays waxed paper on top and presses<br/>
&gt; &gt;the picture with the iron.  It&#39;s a beautiful effect, like encaustic, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;quick.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;One other thing we tried this summer, slightly off topic, was splatter<br/>
&gt; &gt;painting.  We laid an old bed sheet on a sheet of plywood on  the grass,<br/>
&gt; &gt;filled water balloons with paint,  ( we used regular, acrylic house paint<br/>
&gt; &gt;)  climbed the ladder and KER SPLAT !   Hideously messy, but fun.  You<br/>
&gt; &gt;can get large feeding syringes at the vet clinic, with  plastic curved<br/>
&gt; &gt;tips.  You can easily draw up the paint and fill the balloons.  We found<br/>
&gt; &gt;assorted old paints at a garage sale, so the project was cheap.  Jackson<br/>
&gt; &gt;Pollock has nothing on us!  Just remember, you then have to be willing to<br/>
&gt; &gt;USE this work of art around the house.  This can be tricky.<br/>
