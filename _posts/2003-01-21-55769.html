<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-587516880">I came up with an idea that might work for both me and my daughter without all the &quot;learning to sew&quot; stuff.  4H doesn&#39;t start again till next year I don&#39;t think anyway.  And I have ZERO sewing ability LOL.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to go the mall and really take a look at whats &quot;in style&quot;.  (And watch the style channel, etc to get ideas for the &quot;cutting edge&quot; styles).<br/>
<br/>
THEN...we can go to thrift stores and find similar looking clothes, with similar material and modify them in simple ways to make them fit the current trends or to set new trends.<br/>
<br/>
THEN maybe we can sell them at consignment shops.<br/>
<br/>
What do y&#39;all think?<br/>

<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

you&#39;re looking for. I would check on the Style network&#39;s website for times.<br/>
