<div id="ygrps-yiv-559884039">I&#39;m due the end of Sept. with our third, and have been thinking that I really need to get a sling for this one. I have been wodering though, can they be easily made? Funds are soooo limited right now, and I will spend the money if i need to, I was just hoping to make one if I could.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone make a sling instead of buying one?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Oh yeah, the sling really saved me when my 2nd kid was born. She just <br/>
&gt; came along for the ride, all day long. Good for her - constantly <br/>
&gt; getting to be up at face level, with the good stuff on tap right <br/>
&gt; there if she got hungry, good for my son who really wanted to go to <br/>
&gt; parks, playgrounds, for walks to muddy frog ponds, or just for me to <br/>
&gt; be hanging out with him wherever he was at in the house. A sling was <br/>
&gt; the single best thing I had with either kid. Mine was a Rosado sling -<br/>
&gt;  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rosadosling.com/">http://www.rosadosling.com/</a>  made by a woman in Seattle I believe. <br/>
&gt; My DH carried our kids in the sling too, a great way for a dad to <br/>
&gt; keep close and help out the mom as well. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335778949">I owned and operated Nestmom.com from 1995 until two months ago - we<br/>
manufactured the Baby Nest sling. Nestmom.com still sells heavy<br/>
nickel-plated steel rings that are great for sewing your own sling.<br/>
Google these words, and you&#39;ll come up with several pattern options:<br/>
sewing your own baby sling<br/>
 <br/>
To bring this back around to unschooling - part of the reason we sold<br/>
the business after nine years is to spend more time with our kids. We&#39;re<br/>
getting ready to take a two-week trek to see family in Austin TX...<br/>
taking a southern route from Maryland through Virginia, Tennesee,<br/>
Arkansas... then to Austin... then north to see friends in Tulsa OK,<br/>
then to St. Louis to see the arch, then Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and PA<br/>
toward home. Whew! <br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t have a set itinerary, so we&#39;ll have a lot of fun mapping out<br/>
where to stop and what to do each day along the way. Should be a blast,<br/>
and we&#39;re hoping to learn and see a lot!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189546931">I made my 3rd sling last summer.  After spending $37 for a Maya, and $27 for another one, I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to spend that for yet another one, since Dan was already 2, but I really needed on to travel.  I figured how hard could it be.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t have a sewing machine, so this looked even more challenging!  We went to the fabric store and chose a pretty fabric on markdown, for something like $3 a yard.  I bought 2.5 yards to be sure I&#39;d have enough tail on the sling.  At the craft store, I bought 2 metal craft rings -- I think they were 3&quot; inches across (75 cents).   Since all the sewing was going to be hand work, I made it the width of the fabric, using the selvage edge and only had to sew the ends.  I folded the fabric accordian-style (like my earlier slings), threaded it the rings to secure it and hand-sewed it down on the &#39;back&#39; of the fabric.  The other end of the sling threads thru the rings opposite direction of the first threading, and tightens up to fit you and baby, with a tail left for discreet nursing, naptime, etc.   It&#39;s kinda hard to explain how you thread the fabric thru the rings, but if you look at a Maya or other similar sling, you&#39;ll be able to figure it out.  I&#39;m just no good at working or<br/>
 describing things in the abstract, much more a tactile doer!<br/>
 <br/>
All in all, my sling cost me $12  -- including thread for sewing, and took me about 3 hrs.  With a machine, I could have done it in under an hour.  Admittedly, I used discount fabric, but it was just as strong as the Maya Sling I started with.  Dan and I used it all over Hawaii last summer, and he weighed 28lbs at the time.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244289276">I had to go in to work for a little while last night, and a couple of the stockers-I work at Krogers/Ralphs-were unloading a big pallet of Cling Wrap and there were a couple of moms and their children were waiting for some. <br/>
<br/>
I laughed so hard, I could just see them trying to use the Cling Wrap to make slings. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>mayawrap.com also has a pattern for sewing their sling.  I find it to be very <br/>
easy to use - even in the pool!  Elliott naps in there while the older two <br/>
swim.  He doesn&#39;t get hot because he gets wet.  I don&#39;t leave the house without <br/>
my Maya wrap.  Even at 16 pounds and four months, it&#39;s easier to keep put him <br/>
in the sling than to get out the stroller - or to lug the car seat around.<br/>
