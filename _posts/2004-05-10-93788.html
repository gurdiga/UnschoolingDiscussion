There&#39;s a kind of rough exchange going on at www.unschooling.com where a mom <br/>
is being very defensive, and insulting unschoolers for not really caring about <br/>
their kids (implication, not exact words).  It&#39;s hard to explain WHY it would <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jumping in. This is so appropriate for me right now. I&#39;ll try to be <br/>
succinct.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest difference in how I see parenting now is that I no longer <br/>
see it as my job to *get* my kids to: be, do, say, prepare, achieve, <br/>
dream, become or learn.<br/>
<br/>
My job is to point, admire, offer, support, listen, encourage, hug, <br/>
understand, laugh, embrace, shore up, help and learn alongside.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m less concerned with how they should be. I&#39;m more interested in who <br/>
they really are. (That means I am less worried about preventing them <br/>
from becoming a danger to themselves or having wrong ideas or thoughts <br/>
or attitudes and more interested in what they actually think, believe, <br/>
infer, do or judge right now.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more optimistic about their futures and less anxious about the <br/>
present, rather than being anxious about the present and pessimistic <br/>
about their futures as a result.<br/>
<br/>
I see uniqueness rather than &quot;He is so much like his... X - father, <br/>
brother, uncle, the guy I dated in high school...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have learned to live in trust rather than expectation. Do I trust <br/>
that learning is contagious and natural? Do I trust that my child has <br/>
what he needs to make his way in the world? Do I trust that my daughter <br/>
is capable of judging human behavior and drawing wise conclusions for <br/>
her own well-being? Or am I still expecting to find dangers, mistakes, <br/>
moral failures...?<br/>
<br/>
I find that my own life is not about how they are turning out but about <br/>
the adventure of life itself and that my living out a life engaged in <br/>
optimistic learning is contagious. I can&#39;t do it so that they will <br/>
learn to live like that. That is phony. But I can live it because it&#39;s <br/>
the kind of life I like to life, and by living it, they seem to want to <br/>
live like that too.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the first ones off the top of my head. :)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think you need a whole book.  Just ask yourself how you would treat,<br/>
talk to, etc. your very best adult friend and go from there.<br/>
<br/>
Then you start to see how very demeaning we can be to children when we see<br/>
them as less than full human beings.<br/>

I am reading a book called Buddhism for Mothers by Sarah Napthali. It&#39;s<br/>
wonderful. It offers Buddhist practices as a way for mothers to become<br/>
calmer and happier. I&#39;ve just finished the chapter on parenting mindfully<br/>
and there were lots of ideas for learning to live in the moment as opposed<br/>
to thinking about past events or day dreaming about the future and in the<br/>
process becoming disconnected from the present and our children.  Great<br/>
stuff! I really recommend it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, of course anything written by Adele Faber!<br/>

Sandra, is that an old book? I have tried ordering it from the library but<br/>
they don&#39;t stock it. And I tried ordering it from the bookshop months ago<br/>
but they said they would have to import it and I still haven&#39;t heard back<br/>
from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587416279">Hi,<br/>
I hope I&#39;ve waited long enough to start posting-it&#39;s so hard not to jump<br/>
into these great conversations!  I&#39;m Jenny, mom to two kids: Scotty age<br/>
4 on the 23rd and Eliza almost 10 months, and wife to Chris.  We knew we<br/>
were going to homeschool when Scotty was 6 months old, and by the time<br/>
he was 2 we were convinced that unschooling was the only way to go.  We<br/>
were already practicing mindful parenting so, as a recent thread<br/>
discussed, it was not much of a leap to unschooling.  I have been on<br/>
Sandra&#39;s New Mexico Homeschooling list for 3 years already and I was<br/>
heavily influenced by her posts about unschooling.  I was also totally<br/>
fired up by the book Deschooling our Lives edited by Matt Hern.  I have<br/>
yet to get into more John Holt and the others because right now I&#39;m<br/>
spending all my reading time on positive discipline books!<br/>
I&#39;m writing tonight because we have just had a bit of an upheaval in our<br/>
lives-I had to fire Scotty&#39;s long-time babysitter today because of a<br/>
serious violation of my trust in her.  I&#39;m heartbroken but I&#39;m sure I<br/>
made the right decision.   Anyway, he had been going to her house two<br/>
days per week for 6 hours each day.  I really needed this time to work<br/>
on our owner-built house, for which I am the general contractor.  It&#39;s<br/>
basically like being a WAHM.  So, now that I no longer have child care,<br/>
I have some problems to deal with.<br/>
People are telling me to put Scotty in preschool.  They are coming up<br/>
with the usual stuff about socialization, etc.  They are telling me that<br/>
I would like Waldorf schools because they have an unstructured teaching<br/>
philosophy.  But that&#39;s the problem-it&#39;s still a set teaching<br/>
philosophy!  What if he likes structure?  Or what if he likes some<br/>
things to be structured and others to be unstructured?  So, I am 100%<br/>
opposed to him going to any kind of school or anything that resembles<br/>
school (unless he specifically asks for it-like the swimming lessons you<br/>
were discussing).  I have a collection of pat responses to almost every<br/>
argument they give me, and I am unswerving in my commitment to<br/>
unschooling.  The only thing I really don&#39;t have an answer to is &quot;how<br/>
are you going to get anything done without putting him in some kind of<br/>
childcare?&quot;  At this point I don&#39;t want to hire another babysitter so<br/>
basically he and his sister are going to be with me full time.  <br/>
So I guess my question is, how *am* I going to get anything done?<br/>
Almost everyone I know has their kids in preschool now, and if they<br/>
don&#39;t they &quot;can&#39;t wait&quot; until they do, so they can finally &quot;get<br/>
something done&quot;.  Here&#39;s what I need to do specifically:<br/>
Internet research, money management, ordering materials, telephone<br/>
calls, and general office work, much of it on the computer.  This is<br/>
nearly impossible with Scotty around.  He can&#39;t stand to have my<br/>
attention diverted.<br/>
90% of the housework (because Chris is working on the new house).  <br/>
Actual work on the new house.<br/>
I would sure appreciate either general or specific advice on how to<br/>
accomplish these kinds of things with preschool-age children at home.  <br/>
Thanks for reading-this was actually a very therapeutic rant for me<br/>
after a troubling day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That book is best for moms with babies, I think.  Maybe not entirely, but <br/>
it&#39;s not so much about parenting a 12 year old who&#39;s been in school, that&#39;s for <br/>
sure. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about having a spiritual, mindful, aware attitude toward the child as an <br/>
already-whole person.<br/>
<br/>
It makes specific recommendations about things to do/read/get which are <br/>
probably not existing anymore.  It will be outdated in some particulars, <br/>
definitely, but the mood and the tone of it were very comforting to me when I was in <br/>
transition from my old family and upbringing to deciding how I wanted Kirby&#39;s <br/>
life to be different, safer and larger.   I wasn&#39;t even thinking of homeschooling <br/>
at the time I read it.  <br/>
<br/>
Another book I read in those days was &quot;Chop Wood, Carry Water,&quot; and when I <br/>
went back to read it years later after I was unschooling, I noticed what I <br/>
hadn&#39;t before:  The first chapter&#39;s endnotes recommended Growing Without Schooling <br/>
magazine, and John Holt books. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had read John Holt in college (assignment for education courses) but that <br/>
was before he was writing about homeschooling.  It was still more buildup for <br/>
making my children&#39;s futures better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572683430">You can find &quot;Whole Child, Whole Parent&quot; by Polly  Berends at Amazon.<br/>
 New, fourth edition, $11.90.<br/>
 Or it says they have seventy nine copies, used and new from $1.89.<br/>
 It&#39;s worth the new price.  I loved that book.<br/>
<br/>

Thanks Deb!!!!! It&#39;s being shipped now and for a third of the price the<br/>
bookshop quoted me. Just as well they forgot about my order!<br/>

One of my favorites is _Everyday Blessings_The Inner Work of Mindful<br/>
Parenting_ by Jon and Myla Kabat-Zinn.  He has another book called _Wherever<br/>
You Go, There You Are_ which is really good, too, but not a parenting book.<br/>
Barbara Coloroso has a video out of one of her parenting talks called _How<br/>
to Win at Parenting Without Beating Your Kids_.  It&#39;s great and our library<br/>
system has it, so every so often I get it again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6267706">Ooh, I&#39;m reading that one now, but I&#39;m not that far into it yet.  Looks <br/>
great so far.  :)  A web site that I really love is The Natural Child <br/>
Project (put together by Jan Hunt).  There are lots of great articles <br/>
there on gentle parenting and positive discipline -- and even <br/>
unschooling.  :)  You can find it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.org">http://www.naturalchild.org</a><br/>

<br/>
Better people make better parents, though, so working on one&#39;s own peace and <br/>
self esteem and coping skills has to help kids!  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a person is so wounded they can&#39;t operate simple advice.   And <br/>
there&#39;s no really good way for us to get that across, especially in a writing-only <br/>
way.  La Leche League meetings are a little better, but even then parents are <br/>
behaving in front of other parents and it might not match the way they&#39;ll be <br/>
when they get home.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, though, if a parent says &quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; it can be said with a <br/>
great range of emotion and &quot;message&quot; through posture and intonation, eye <br/>
movement, other subtle clues that some people read better than others and some kids <br/>
learn to ignore if their parents express too much non-verbally.  So if a <br/>
parent reports &quot;I just said &#39;Fine&#39;&quot; or &quot;I told him I wasn&#39;t angry,&quot; it&#39;s possible <br/>
that the messages were actually &quot;I can&#39;t stand this&quot; and &quot;You suck,&quot; though <br/>
the words themselves were not.<br/>
<br/>
So long story tied back to beginning, the best parenting book in the world <br/>
won&#39;t work for a parent whose personal frustration level is topping out all the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
My sister used to be totally wired (sometimes with substances, sometimes with <br/>
guilt, sometimes just naturally).   And everything was the last straw.  &quot;Calm <br/>
down,&quot; for her, meant &quot;Take one straw off your hay wagon, so that you can <br/>
move, slightly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The next thing that happened was the last straw.<br/>
<br/>
One day I told her she had to unload at least half that wagon, not just <br/>
enough to stop yelling or stop crying.  She wasn&#39;t going to be ANY good at <br/>
parenting if she was blaming her kids for everything she felt.<br/>
<br/>
And she did get better for a long time.  But she got self-righteously angry <br/>
about new and different things and didn&#39;t have the tricks and tools to process <br/>
those feelings and move on calmly.  She ended up divorced a couple of years <br/>
ago, and that was NO damned good for her kids, the youngest of whom is 16 now.<br/>
<br/>
So.<br/>
I think it&#39;s okay to recommend books or methods or ideas that aren&#39;t <br/>
specifically parenting-focussed.  Parents are people.  Kids are people.  People focus <br/>
is good.<br/>
