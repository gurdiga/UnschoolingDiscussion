<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316321127">Lisa,      I don&#39;t believe the problem was with this guy not eating meat, its because we are the only speices on the face of the earth that cooks and processes our foods.  Cooked food is toxic to our bodies, along with our food choices.  See <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rawfood.com">http://www.rawfood.com</a>  for starters.  I was a vegetarian for 7 years before I went all raw foods and being raw makes a big difference!  Therefore, if your going to eat meat, eat it raw or dehydrated or sun-dri it in temp. less than 107 degrees to keep the enzymes in tact. Robin&lt;&lt;Also, in the book Foods for Healing there is an essay by a couple who tried to live as vegetarians for years.  It began to adversely affect the husband&#39;s health.  Animal protein seems to be necessary for some biochemistries.&gt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880069404">Dear everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Being new to all of this, I&#39;m finding it so interesting that we all seem<br/>
to be drawn to so many of the same things.  I became a vegetarian about<br/>
5 months ago - my body just started rejecting meat.  I thought it might<br/>
be related to practicing Yoga - which I had started about 9 months<br/>
before.<br/>

I am responding to your post on the unschooling.com list privately, to avoid <br/>
any &quot;off-topic&quot; subjects onlist.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to let you know that (1) I like your posts (aggressive though they <br/>
may be interpreted); and (2) you HAVE, single-handedly, converted me BACK to <br/>
vegetarianism.<br/>
<br/>
I had originally become a practicing vegetarian based solely on an experience <br/>
suffered through in eighth grade biology class.  After about ten years, I <br/>
&quot;reverted&quot; back to non-vegetarianism.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the ghosts that are reanimated by this discussion!<br/>

Sincerely,<br/>

Being a vegetarian nowadays, one doesn&#39;t need to feel deprived of eating<br/>
meat at all! There are so many meat-like substitute out there.<br/>
Well, maybe there is no real substitute for a thick, rare steak dripping<br/>
with &quot;juice&quot; (eewww!), or that unmistakeable gristle found in your hamburger<br/>
or how about that inedible glob of fat that you must spit out because it&#39;s<br/>
like chewing gum? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Sorry folks - I&#39;m just remembering my meat-eating days and why I turned<br/>
vegetarian about 20 years ago! :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947180296">[I have been vegetarian since last May, with a couple<br/>
of short months of being vegan.  I expected to feel so<br/>
much better.  I didn&#39;t. I ate the low fat, vegetarian<br/>
foods (McDougall plan, which I still think is<br/>
healthy).  <br/>
But I found myself having to go &quot;off the plan&quot; because<br/>
I was so hungry and I wanted something with fat in<br/>
it.]<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s the &quot;McDougall PLAN&quot;....very different from<br/>
choosing to eat veg*n meals/snacks.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to become vegetarian 12 years ago and vegan<br/>
about 7 ago.  In our house vegetarian/vegan definitely<br/>
does not equal no/low fat foods.  We eat plenty of<br/>
wholesome &quot;fatty&quot; foods like avocados, coconut, olives<br/>
and olive oil, nuts and seeds, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of fats that our bodies need in order<br/>
to function so if you&#39;re cutting them all out then<br/>
you&#39;re body is going to lack in some vital things like<br/>
Essential Fatty Acids, etc.  HTH  :)<br/>
