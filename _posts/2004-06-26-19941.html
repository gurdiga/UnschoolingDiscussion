not seeking answers or help.  When confronted with the possibility of choice<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531377451">Kay,<br/>
<br/>
WOW!!<br/>
<br/>
Powerful observations, and SO true!<br/>
<br/>
This is what I am having to do. The thing I am most concerned with <br/>
is that in divorcing my husband, that the judge in CA here will make <br/>
me place my children back into &quot;school&quot;, as I have heard that judges <br/>
do not look to kindly on homeschoolers and I do not have the money <br/>
behind me to fight him in court. <br/>
<br/>
I cannot seem to make him see, not to change him, but to just agree <br/>
to the fact that in a divorce that I can still homeschool. <br/>
Therefore, rather than fight him, I have just elected to stay <br/>
married to him in &quot;name only&quot; until the children are of age (this <br/>
looking to be about 12 years) and then I can divorce him. This will <br/>
still give me the freedom to unschool (life learn) with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I went through a seminar three years ago, that gave me what you <br/>
wrote here a REAL hard look a that. I am not the same person I was 3 <br/>
years ago, although my husband chooses not to see that. He is still <br/>
stuck in the past and views me in that way, as in the past I admit, <br/>
I was a person who thought &quot;If only I could change him&quot;. I was young <br/>
and naive in the earlier years of our marriage I know. <br/>
<br/>
3 years ago was as you said, a real wake up call. And I have grown <br/>
so much since then. This journey to unschooling too has made me <br/>
grown SO much as well, so much of that I am not able to share with <br/>
him because he will not allow me. He as as you said Kay, in that <br/>
victimhood, his payoff of saying he is the victim all the time, when <br/>
he is not in integrity with me and lies and hurts the boys and I. <br/>
And the boys see this, I do not need to tell them anything. They see <br/>
for themselves his lies and his lack of responsibility and lack of <br/>
integrity and how he is not willing to share all of the wonder and <br/>
awe of unschooling with me.<br/>
<br/>
I know now that because of all of this, that I must walk away from <br/>
this relationship and move on with my life. I have tried to reach <br/>
him but after the events of this past weekend, I just cannot seem to <br/>
and know what it is I need to do. I had hoped to be able to finish <br/>
my book I am writing about life learning and to have set up a <br/>
private ISP here, but it looks as if I will be moving due to the <br/>
current circumstances and alas there will be no book. I am not <br/>
currently working and I now have to find a way to continue to <br/>
unschool and bring in income for my family, as the trust between him <br/>
and I is now gone forever and the marriage is going to be &quot;in name <br/>
only&quot; from this point forward. I cannot rely on the fact that he <br/>
will continue to support us after the events of this weekend. And I <br/>
cannot go after any for of support in a divorce because it would <br/>
mean the kids will have to go back to school and for their happiness <br/>
and emotional well being, we all know they are far better off <br/>
unschooling despite what he says (or my family for the matter, he <br/>
has now spoken to them today in an attempt to try and get them on <br/>
his side of which my parents are no for homeschooling let alone <br/>
unschooling, you should see the ridiculous email my father sent me. <br/>
Completely emotionally abusive and no basis for fact in <br/>
homeschooling. I should post what he wrote on here so everyone could <br/>
see what a ridiculous email it was) I can only hope he will do the <br/>
right thing by his boys, but I do not know.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Kay for your words of wisdom, they have been mirroring my <br/>
thoughts, observations, and path. I guess I just needed another <br/>
voice to say it to know what it is I must now do.<br/>

<br/>
Sorry to hear you got crazy e-mail, but please do NOT post it here.  Thanks.<br/>
It won&#39;t help others unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Another consideration if you have a six year old.<br/>
He might need two parents more than you need to be right about something.<br/>
<br/>
Marriage counselling might do your  kids more good than unschooling will.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-465836481">I agree, I have learned more in counseling about myself and my part <br/>
in how I react to people and relationships. I know that my <br/>
relationship with my child&#39;s father will continue whether we are <br/>
married or not. It is easier to avoid issues in the short run, but <br/>
they do not go away. They only get larger until delt with directly.<br/>
Consider reading The Dance of Anger about limit setting and choosing <br/>
our reations to situations. It helps to change the dynamics of <br/>
uncomfortable relationships. It does not change your husband. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling embraces that one (child or adult) can only know what is <br/>
best for themself. He may not agree that he needs to change. But you <br/>
can set boundaries for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I would not allow myself to remain in an abusive relationship, but a <br/>
counselor can help you define your boundaries. The paper trail of <br/>
counseling can&#39;t hurt in a divorce either. Can&#39;t hurt to try.<br/>
<br/>
It could be a journey of recovery for you both.<br/>
