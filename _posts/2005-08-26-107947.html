I  disagree.   That&#39;s not to say I think it is the idea., but there  needs to <br/>
be a balance.<br/>
Some parents make no sacrifices at  all.   They (parents) resent any <br/>
inconvenience their children  cause them.   <br/>
<br/>
If the only two options were zero sacrifice  and total sacrifice, total <br/>
sacrifice would be better for the  children.      Those are not at all the <br/>
only two  <br/>
options.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but not if  it&#39;s *rejecting* any sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
What if Julian had really, truly not  wanted you to do that conference and <br/>
every moment of work or discussion on  it wounded him and your relationship?  <br/>

********************************<br/>
Semantics, and clearly we have different ideas about what &quot;sacrifice&quot;  means.<br/>
 <br/>
Being in a relationship, especially a healthy relationship, means there is  <br/>
give and take on both sides, not necessarily equal, and different people in the <br/>
 relationship may have different needs at the different times. For example,  <br/>
a young child has dramatically different needs than a teenager or an adult. Or <br/>
a  family member struggling with a work situation or a health problem will <br/>
have  different needs.<br/>
 <br/>
Certainly there are parents who resent any inconvenience their children may  <br/>
cause them. But my perspective is that for parents who are NOT like that,  <br/>
meeting their children&#39;s needs is not about sacrifice. It&#39;s love, and a happy  <br/>
thing. <br/>
 <br/>
People here have talked about changing their perspectives on housework,  <br/>
thinking about it in terms of caring for their families with love. Would they  <br/>
consider that sacrifice? No....that&#39;s the whole point.<br/>
 <br/>
I think that sacrifice is an attitude, rather than an action. You may have  a <br/>
different perspective.<br/>
 <br/>
I find the question about Julian perplexing though. It&#39;s so hypothetical,  <br/>
and so unrealistic. Of course, being in right relations with my family, I  <br/>
talked about the possibility of doing a conference with them first,  and both were <br/>
enthusiastic. So, first, doing a conference that they had issues  with <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have brought me joy, and wouldn&#39;t have been a sacrifice to let go  of. <br/>
Particularly since it was an unschooling conference -- it&#39;s as much about  Julian <br/>
and Beth as it is about me. <br/>
 <br/>
Second, I cannot imagine a situation in which something non-abusive I was  <br/>
doing would create a situation in which &quot;every moment of work or discussion on  <br/>
it wounded him and your relationship.&quot; If that were the case, I think there&#39;d <br/>
be  bigger issues with both him and our relationship than planning a <br/>
conference. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to focus here on extremes of &quot;inconvenienced&quot;  <br/>
parents or truly unrealistic situations. People reading here, whether or not  <br/>
they ultimately embrace unschooling, or however far they apply it, are not  <br/>
likely to be those people. And the unrealistic situations are a little confusing  <br/>
and are more about intellectual repartee than about real life unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mother is so afraid someone might &quot;take advantage&quot; of her that she <br/>
refuses to help anyone. This fear results in an extreme lack of <br/>
generosity. This is her view of the world that includes strangers, <br/>
community members and family. She constantly talks about how her <br/>
brother&#39;s children take advantage of their generosity; she&#39;s very quick <br/>
to point out where friends are taking advantage or strangers within the <br/>
larger social structure. She looks at the world and sees people lurking <br/>
around every corner who may require her to think outside of herself  and <br/>
make some kind of sacrifice, and this is the new, improved non-drinking <br/>
version of my mother. It was much, much worse when she was drinking and <br/>
had a child making demands upon her.<br/>
<br/>
A gracious and generous &quot;sacrifice&quot; for someone else is a good thing in <br/>
my mind. It makes the world go round more pleasantly and creates an <br/>
economy of care that combats some of the selfishness inherent in the <br/>
individual, pull-yourself-up-by-your-own-bootstraps mentality of capitalism.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the word sacrifice can be replaced by the notion of shifting <br/>
one&#39;s perspective to see the world from another&#39;s (one&#39;s child&#39;s, for <br/>
instance) point of view that enables a more generous, less resentful <br/>
form of &quot;sacrifice&quot; to occur--empathy driven sacrifice. But, the <br/>
much-maligned notion of sacrifice as a bad thing is a remnant of the <br/>
Victorian version of the all sacrificing Angel of the House, a reactive <br/>
remnant of first-wave feminism, as I see it anyway. The usefulness of <br/>
its critique was short-lived and the unseen ramifications far-reaching, imo.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that it&#39;s our culture (Americans anyway, maybe not the rest of the <br/>
English speaking world) one of the underlying messages is that if you   needed <br/>
help you&#39;re a wimp and if you support someone else too generously you&#39;re a <br/>
dupe.<br/>
<br/>
And I KNOW that the women&#39;s movement, while doing a lot of good in the <br/>
workplace and universities and social awareness and laws, did a *HUGE* amount of <br/>
harm to children and families and women who thought they could just jump straight <br/>
into that selfish-non-sacrificing traditional (but rarely achieved)   male <br/>
ideal role.<br/>
<br/>
They thought day care would be as good as direct mothering.    They thought <br/>
having a career would solve their problems and the problems of all around them.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, things were bad in the 50s for a lot of women.<br/>
Rejecting all things 50&#39;s, and all men and all children, doesn&#39;t seem to have <br/>
been an intelligent or helpful solution to that.     <br/>
<br/>
So now we need to figure out which parts of any of the past 50 years&#39; ideas <br/>
to keep and which not to keep.   But more than picking and choosing principles <br/>
to live by (and part of that, ideally) is to really understand why and how <br/>
such decisions are made.   <br/>
<br/>
Doing something because everyone else does is easy and you can sustain a life <br/>
on it, but it&#39;s not a mindful place to be.   Doing something because a small <br/>
inspiring subgroup said to do it can be exhilarating, but if you don&#39;t truly <br/>
understand why, your &quot;belief&quot; will only last as long as their pep rally lasts.<br/>
<br/>
Another sacrifice to make, for unschooling to work well, is the ease of just <br/>
borrowing a philosophy as a part of temporary friendships.   It has to be deep <br/>
and individual.   You might have to sacrifice some of what you lifted from <br/>
the Women&#39;s Movement AND some of what you inherited from your family if you want <br/>
to have a relationship with your children that&#39;s bigger and better than their <br/>
visions were.<br/>

I like the way you describd out culture and economy.  There&#39;s a kind of <br/>
callous bottom-line thinking in our culture that seems to think <br/>
generosity is foolish and sentimental, and &quot;not worth it&quot; in some <br/>
numerical sense.  This goes counter to older religious ideas about the <br/>
