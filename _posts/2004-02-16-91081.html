would love to be able to go to the conference in Aug.  <br/>
I&#39;m &quot;working&quot; on my DH.  He says that he is supportive of <br/>
unschooling but, whenever I bring up going to a conference, he <br/>
always has some reason as to why we shouldn&#39;t go.  However, this is <br/>
one that I just might go to without him.  <br/>
<br/>
One question, my DD will be 3 by the time the conference rolls <br/>
around and I would need to bring her with me.  I am not comfortable <br/>
leaving her with people that I don&#39;t know (assuming that there is <br/>
some kind of daycare set up), would I be able to bring her to <br/>
the &quot;seminars&quot; with me?  She is really good as long as she has <br/>
something to keep her busy (crayons, or some quiet toys).  Just <br/>
wondering, in case I am able to make it, with or without my hubby.<br/>
<br/>

Husbands are SOOOOOO influenced by this conference. In fact some of the <br/>
nicest testamonials were from dads! They get to see older unschooled children and <br/>
dads who &quot;get it&quot;. There will be a special &quot;Dads Only&quot; secret society where <br/>
they can talk freely about their concerns with other dads----with no moms to <br/>
terrorize them and monopolize the conversations! &lt;g&gt; They can immerse themselves <br/>
for three days into unschooling and come out with a new understanding of <br/>
unschooling-----and some have become downright (dare I say it????) evangelical! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As for the kids: they&#39;ll have a great time! There is no &quot;daycare&quot; as such <br/>
(this IS an UNschooling conference, after all!), but I&#39;m sure Kathryn will have a <br/>
&quot;safe room&quot; where the littluns can play safely with a parent nearby as we did <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hightly recommend that the whole family come, BUT there is a handful of <br/>
women who came without kids and had a blast. They are known as the &quot;ladies on <br/>
the terrace&quot;, as they spent most their free time outside with bottles of wine! <br/>
They DID complain to me last week, though, that their husband still don&#39;t get <br/>
it. I recommended that they might should bring their husbands this year! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With or without husbands and/or children you will get a BUNCH out of this <br/>
weekend. But as unschoolers, I&#39;d say that it&#39;s best as a family affair!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet you (all) then!<br/>

And sorry, I forgot to mention that the kids are VERY welcome at ALL <br/>
presentations!  No age descrimination! Again, it&#39;s an UNschooling conference!<br/>
