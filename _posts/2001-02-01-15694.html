<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  am sorry to hear that Laura is unsubbing for reasons of not being properly <br/>
&gt;  welcomed on the list. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, I know the above sentence was made with good intentions, but it&#39;s<br/>
extremely over simplified.  <br/>
I only pointed out that due to all the arguing and political and religious <br/>
bashing<br/>
going on, that those with unschooling questions and introductions are going<br/>
completely ignored.<br/>
I am not leaving because I was not welcomed..I&#39;m now leaving because these<br/>
other issues all take precedence over things that we all have in common.<br/>
Rather than being thankful that we can all get along and share ideas, there<br/>
are those that seem to WANT to create arguments.<br/>
I can celebrate diversity too, but you do it with respect. NOT by arguing.<br/>
<br/>
I stuck around a couple of days to see if it calmed down, and it seemed to <br/>
just a bit, then it picked back up again.  <br/>
<br/>
And Sandra, please don&#39;t word it that you are offened by what I said..<br/>
I still say you cannot speak for all Christians and that it concerns me that <br/>
other<br/>
non christians may base a judgement on a statement that may be true about YOUR<br/>
experiences, but certainly not mine.  Although I have run across those types, <br/>
I <br/>
make a HUGE attempt to not across them again. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

THIS is personal.<br/>
Speaking in generalities about religions and political movements is not <br/>
personal.<br/>
<br/>
Does the list exist for people to be welcomed, or to exchange information <br/>
among homeschoolers?  <br/>
<br/>
The political problem involved jumping on a family about raising dogs.  My <br/>
pointing to the juxtaposition of that and the earlier pro-life arguments <br/>
(also about politics) was jumped on as being personal, which is was not.  <br/>
<br/>
Neither the presidential nor the dog overpopulation posts were mine.<br/>
