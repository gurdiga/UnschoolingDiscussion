&lt;&lt; Dear Jennifer,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you , thank you, thank you for the definition of metadiscussion (this <br/>
is a new concept to me and I love it). Adopting the ban on metadiscussions as <br/>
described in your post would be very good for the list. You have my vote.<br/>
<br/>
Sherry &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But if that policy were adopted, your post would have been banned.  You could <br/>
have written to Jennifer privately, but it went to 850 people (give or take a <br/>
hundred, it fluctuates).<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re discussing people&#39;s seeming intent and the effect of their choice <br/>
of words, that&#39;s part of the discussion of the validity of their advice.  If <br/>
I come in and say &quot;I have one child and he&#39;s always loved Calvert curriculum, <br/>
and he&#39;s smart and I&#39;m smart and so if any of you are smart you&#39;ll use <br/>
Calvert curriculum,&quot; it would be fine for people to question my logic and my <br/>
motives.  It would be kinda goofy if they didn&#39;t.   So that sort of <br/>
questioning and request for clarification or documentation or reality check <br/>
is part of a real discussion.   But discussing discussions in the absence of <br/>
an actual discussion, THAT is twice-removed from talking about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My kids get along really well with their friends.  I&#39;m surprised sometimes at <br/>
how much they&#39;ll put up with, not because they&#39;re afraid the friends will <br/>
leave, but just because they&#39;re so confident that relationships will come and <br/>
go and those who like them will stick around.  So rather than having the urge <br/>
to &quot;fix&quot; their friends, they just observe them and apply the information to <br/>
other later interactions.<br/>
<br/>
But they WILL defend the peace of a game, or a party, or an outing.  Kirby <br/>
and Holly, especially, are pretty good with the subtle  doing things only <br/>
when necessary.<br/>

It should have said more like...<br/>

But they WILL defend the peace of a game, or a party, or an outing.  Kirby <br/>
and Holly, especially, are pretty good with the subtle seating rearrangements <br/>
or conversational distractions.<br/>
<br/>
All of them, though, are  doing things often, and discussing doing things <br/>
only when necessary.<br/>
