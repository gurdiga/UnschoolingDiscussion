<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056299150">And _Number of the Beast_, without which you don&#39;t get the whole story; it&#39;s<br/>
a sequel.<br/>
<br/>
Growing up, Lazarus Long influenced me more than any other fictional<br/>
character. (Well, him and John Galt.)  When I look at how I unschooled<br/>
myself when I was young (through umpteen years of public school) one track<br/>
was in animals and the other in philosophy, much of that in science fiction<br/>
and fantasy novels, as well as nonfiction. Robert Heinlein&#39;s most famous<br/>
novel is _Stranger in a Strange Land_ but it is also less accessible than<br/>
most. I preferred the L. Long series.<br/>
<br/>
And I still learn through novels. My latest brain candy is murder mysteries,<br/>
but there&#39;s a lot to be learned there (although *not* the reason I read<br/>
them!) Last year I did my own study of WWII just for fun, and it wiped me<br/>
out on nonfiction for awhile.<br/>

success almost immediately.  The goal was to breed for a long life.<br/>
Lazarus was born when Wilson was President but much of the storyline<br/>
takes place hundreds of years in the future.  One of the problems<br/>
faced by Lazarus and the others (called Methuselahs) is that they<br/>
have to devise a system of memory enhancement so they can keep track<br/>
of things.<br/>
