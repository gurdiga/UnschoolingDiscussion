<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577755945">This is ostensibly about chores, but (as with just about everything  &lt;g&gt;) at <br/>
the deeper level it&#39;s about trust and choices and parents  grounding <br/>
themselves in their beliefs and living there.  Thanks to all  those who contributed, <br/>
and if others want to send similar bits I&#39;ll incorporate  those too.  <br/>
