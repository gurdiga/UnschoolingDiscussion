<div id="ygrps-yiv-646718832"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t personally call unschooling &quot;child-led learning,&quot; although I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>probably have a time or two years ago.  Some people use that as their quicky <br/>
description, I&#39;m pretty sure (or did years ago). That&#39;s probably why some <br/>
people say if a child chooses it, it&#39;s unschooling--even if what the child <br/>
chooses is a curriculum or boarding school.I think of unschooling as learning <br/>
from a life without schoolishness.  But I&#39;ve kinda made a full-time project <br/>
of it.  Other families want to make a school-replacement temporary thing of <br/>
it, and so for them it&#39;s going to less life-transforming.   &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes - I wanted to hear about this.<br/>
<br/>
I DO think that when unschooled kids choose school that it is very very <br/>
different than compulsory schooling. I don&#39;t know what to call it, I guess, <br/>
but the unschooled teens who are choosing to take classes at the community <br/>
colleges still REALLY feel like unschoolers - like autodidacts - like THEY <br/>
are fully and completely in charge of their own learning. They feel like THEY <br/>
are using the resources of the college - the teachers, the materials, the <br/>
facilities, the other students - in the same way they used the resources of <br/>
the library or museums or other adults or fairs or music stores or whatever - <br/>
when they were younger. Their lives become somewhat more &quot;purposeful&quot; <br/>
sometimes - they have goals that are more definable. (But interestingly, <br/>
their goals aren&#39;t stated in academic terms - they don&#39;t say, &quot;My goal is to <br/>
get a degree in art or accounting or whatever.&quot; They say, &quot;My goal is to run <br/>
my own art gallery, specializing in large ceramic pieces,&quot; or &quot;My goal is to <br/>
work as an accountant for a nonprofit organization that helps battered women <br/>
and children.&quot;  As opposed to the vast majority of my college students who <br/>
don&#39;t seem to have any goal beyond thinking that getting a degree will <br/>
increase their income.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe having been so separated from schoolishness, they can go into that <br/>
environment and still unschool in the sense that they still live within that <br/>
big unschooling paradigm, even though they are choosing to jump through some <br/>
hoops (pay the price) to get access to some stuff they want.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not quibbing over what they are CALLED, by the way. It doesn&#39;t matter at <br/>
all. But I&#39;m just commenting on the fact that they go into this college <br/>
experience with a very different attitude than other new college students and <br/>
that attitude is the logical extension of their years of living as <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s child-led learning.  I think it&#39;s learning and pure learning, <br/>
but not &quot;teaching&quot; and not &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think when a child goes to third grade by choice, he&#39;s in school and not <br/>
unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
I think when someone takes a college level class in a specific topic because <br/>
of interest in that topic, or takes piano or karate and isn&#39;t compelled by <br/>
the parent  to do it, and to practice an hour a day, and all the traditional <br/>
trappings of such things, that that is the use of a resource by an interested <br/>
learner.  <br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think any public school situation allows for picking and <br/>
choosing, or for cooperating or not cooperating to the extent that once a <br/>
child is in she isn&#39;t just IN there.   Her attitude will be differnent if she <br/>
has the right to leave, but their treatment of the children and their <br/>
characterization of learning and how it works will be a big part of the day.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  And I think unless a child and parent have really gone into that place <br/>
of totally trusting that they can learn and have seen and felt that work, and <br/>
have gotten over the jittery fear that they won&#39;t read or do math, that THEN <br/>
they can use the resources from that mindset.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably impossible to explain to someone who hasn&#39;t fully relaxed into <br/>
natural learning, because they see a kid taking classes and they think they <br/>
can duplicate the experience by telling their kids to take some classes.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m passing the place where I have words now.  And it&#39;s going to seem too <br/>
esoteric to some for me to say it depends what your experience and awareness <br/>
is whether you&#39;re learning or being taught.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to those to whom it seems nonsensical.  And if anyone does understand <br/>
and can describe it, that would be wonderful.<br/>

That isn&#39;t surprising. That&#39;s the way things are SUPPOSED to be in college, <br/>
after all. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more interested in is the experience of kids who go to high school or <br/>
otherwise into situations where most everybody else is NOT there of their own <br/>
free will. How does the compulsory experience of the rest of the population <br/>
affect them?<br/>
<br/>
The experience of a teen choosing to attend school on a college campus and <br/>
one choosing a high school campus are going to be light years apart.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. For one, the principle of &quot;in loco parentis.&quot;  If you stand up and walk <br/>
out of a college class, or just don&#39;t go for a time or two, you&#39;re not <br/>
considered a runaway.  When kids are in public or private school, they are in <br/>
some ways the property of those teachers.  Worse almost than with their <br/>
parents.   It&#39;s a scary kind of law/tradition/precedent.  Hardly ever comes <br/>
into play anymore, and when I&#39;ve heard it more than not lately is parents <br/>
furious that the school didn&#39;t control their kids better.  &quot;They were with <br/>
you, why didn&#39;t you make sure....&quot; whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone with a morbid curiosity about in loco parentis, here are some <br/>
defining bits:<br/>

<br/>
True. Supposed to be. But it isn&#39;t. The VAST majority of college students are <br/>
sort of sleepwalking &lt;G&gt; when it comes to learning. What I mean is that they <br/>
just do not have any concept of anything beyond school and their social life. <br/>
To them the ENTIRE point of a class is to take the tests, get the passing <br/>
grades, and graduate. There are very very few who would not JUMP at the <br/>
chance to skip a class if they could just get credit. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For years I would start the semester off telling my classes that the<br/>
clearest way to let me know that they didn&#39;t care about the subject or my<br/>
ability to teach and that they were wasting our time, was to ask me &quot;Is this<br/>
on the test?&quot; If I didn&#39;t tell them up front haw rude I found it, It would<br/>
be asked multiple times a day. As a young teacher I found it one of the most<br/>
hurtful aspects of the profession.<br/>
Now that I am older and unschooling has taken hold of me, I do something I&#39;m<br/>
sure many of my students find almost as hurtful. I structure the class so<br/>
there are no tests. They *can&#39;t* ask me if it is on the test. I teach<br/>
technical Theatre classes and am fortunate that the subject allows me to<br/>
have other ways of assessment. Unfortunately I do have to grade the students<br/>
to  satisfy administrators and record keepers.<br/>
At the start of the term, this is very unsettling to about 90% of the<br/>
students. I ask (multiple times) what they want to learn from the class. I<br/>
see lots of confused faces. I also see people staring blankly hoping I will<br/>
just get to the (nonexistent) list of requirements they need to pass the<br/>
class. I can&#39;t help but think that for most of these people it is the first<br/>
time they have been asked to guide their own learning.<br/>
By the third of fourth week most of class gets it. Or at least on some level<br/>
they understand that this is not going to be like there other classes.  They<br/>
stop asking for the specific requirements of the class. They can ask<br/>
questions about the subject without worrying about reciting our discussion<br/>
later for the exam. When I ask at the end of class each day if they are<br/>
getting what they wanted out of the class they slowly realize that they can<br/>
say &quot;no,&quot; and ask if we can go over or find out about such and such. And we<br/>
do. An I don&#39;t hold hard to any subject line. If after discussing lighting<br/>
control boards, the class wants to go over how they compare to sound<br/>
consoles, we explore sound.<br/>
<br/>
Many, understandably have to ask how they are doing grade wise in the class,<br/>
so (after letting them know that if it was up to me there would be no<br/>
grades) I ask leading questions about their participation in the class and<br/>
get them to self evaluate with my last question being &quot;so what what kind of<br/>
grade do you think that is?&quot; they eventually tell me. That answer is always<br/>
there grade. This self evaluation seems to be both a horrifying and<br/>
liberating process.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately we spend about half the term deschooling before the class can<br/>
really get moving. And there are always some who can never make the jump.<br/>

I got to saying calmly &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; or &quot;Maybe.&quot;  <br/>
And sometimes I would say &quot;This will not be on the test, but...&quot; and then do <br/>
what was clearly the most (maybe ONLY) interesting thing of the week. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
