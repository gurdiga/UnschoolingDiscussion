<div id="ygrps-yiv-606367224">Less than a week, for those going to the HSC conference in Santa Clara, California <br/>
<br/>
I realize this only applies to a dozen or thirty of you, and I&#39;m sorry about that, but having the pre-first slot, Friday morning before the main speaker, the chances that people won&#39;t find out until later are extremely high.<br/>
<br/>
*****I&#39;m scheduled for a breakfast meeting, only in a conference room (the main room, Magnolia), 8:30 to 9:30 Friday.****<br/>
<br/>
This meet-up with just be a question/answer session. <br/>
<br/>
At 10:00 is the main speaker, Peggy O&#39;Mara, so we can&#39;t go over time.<br/>
If you did want to bring food in there, get it very early.<br/>
<br/>
Then I speak in that room at 11:45-1:00 so if you didn&#39;t have breakfast it will be a long time until lunch.  Bring granola bars in your purse or something. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All my sessions are in &quot;Magnolia&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
FRIDAY:<br/>
