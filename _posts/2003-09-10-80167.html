<div id="ygrps-yiv-96738077">A friend of mine who conducts orientation sessions for teens <br/>
traveling to Japan, asked me to post this scholarship notice for <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675811119">hmmmm, now if they just offered one for the adults of the teens!  My daughter <br/>
(17) would just LOVE THIS!  LOL, I got her hooked on Sushi several years ago <br/>
and I&#39;ve taught her a little Japanese from college days!  Actually, she&#39;s <br/>
standing here right now BEGGING me to call!  OMGOSH!  Can you imagine how I&#39;d be <br/>
if she left that for that long, especially since I went so crazy when she was <br/>
ONLY GONE a week in Montana?  And, I don&#39;t think I &quot;could take&quot; the plane <br/>
flight over there!  Thanks to one friend, I spent an entire day (the day she <br/>
returned from Montana) on line, EVERY 15 to 20 minutes, checking the status of the <br/>
flight (there&#39;s a site on line you can check exactly where the plane is, their <br/>
ground speed, and the height the plane is flying at).  <br/>
