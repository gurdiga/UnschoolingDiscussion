<div id="ygrps-yiv-916597630">Earlier today Holly was looking at a photo of Ren Allen and her  <br/>
sister, Heidi, years ago, with &#39;80&#39;s hair.  She asked me what I  <br/>

noses.  I said there had been pierced noses in India for centuries,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819771350">I had my nose pierced while in my early twenties for about a year, because I<br/>
thought it looked cool!  I have no problem with that to this day.  It grew<br/>
in nicely after two years;)  Nobody can tell it was ever pierced.<br/>
<br/>
Tattoos are harder to get rid off, but perhaps people will have changed<br/>
culture enough that they won&#39;t be a source of embarrassment!<br/>
<br/>
My vote is paranoia over computers/television will be the one people are<br/>
most embarrassed by in years to come.<br/>
<br/>
I think we will be ashamed of all the pollution we created, though by not<br/>
reusing or recycling items or with thoughtless purchases.  In previous<br/>
generations things kept getting reused.  Clothes became patchwork quilts,<br/>
rugs or rags if they were too far gone.  Now people buy painting rags,<br/>
instead of cutting up ripped/dirty old clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Food issues have always existed with food going in and out of &quot;style&quot; during<br/>
my childhood.  Earlier generations didn&#39;t have that luxury and I suspect<br/>
neither will our grandchildren, because we have created a car dependent<br/>
society and when gas stops coming out in huge quantities there will be less<br/>
cheap exotic grains, products and those eschewing native grains for teff<br/>
grown far away will suddenly find restrictions due to cash, unless we figure<br/>
out a way to keep the imports coming in cheaply.<br/>
