I am not an unschooler from birth.<br/>
Are you implying that I can&#39;t be comfortable here.<br/>
Well let me tell you, I was not an unschooler at all when I started <br/>
homeschooling. I had read John Holt and it encouraged me to homeschool, but I <br/>
didn&#39;t quite &quot;get it&quot;.<br/>
After doing some damage to my older son I realized it and tried to change. We <br/>
evolved into &quot;eclectic/relaxed&quot; type homeschoolers. Doing unit studies and <br/>
trying to let my kids lead the way a LOT more.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I found unschooling.com a few years ago , that my ideas and <br/>
beliefs were able to be really questioned (uncomfortably so) and I found a <br/>
lack within those beliefs.<br/>
Thankfully, Sandra, Joyce, Pam and other people here were willing to ask <br/>
those difficult, soul piercing questions that enabled me to shed some old <br/>
baggage.<br/>
We are unschoolers now, have been for a couple years. <br/>
As Mary says, &quot;Life is Good&quot;......<br/>
But I needed that questioning, that informations from &quot;old timers&quot; with older <br/>
kids that this could and would work. I needed to trust my children more fully.<br/>
If a person isn&#39;t willing to questions their beliefs as parents, they aren&#39;t <br/>
going to evolve into better parent&#39;s. It&#39;s that simple.<br/>
Questioning, seeking and being willing to change is necessary.  This is a <br/>
great place to do that in an unschooling context.<br/>
I really wish any newbies (or anyone else) that doesn&#39;t think the list will <br/>
help them, will either read for a while and get the true feel for it, or go <br/>
to another list.<br/>
Maybe that seems rude. But it gets tiresome to see ladies that have changed <br/>
your life and brought incredible joy into your family with their influence, <br/>
attacked at every turn.<br/>
Someone else was saying how much they loved Ned.<br/>
Why bring that up here?<br/>
Go to a Ned list, he&#39;s out there ya know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What were the soul piercing questions Ned asked about unschooling and<br/>
helping children learn?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your definition of silence? Ned hasn&#39;t been gagged. He&#39;s just been<br/>
asked to use a room for his speeches other than this one. People are free to<br/>
join as many lists as Ned is on. How is asking him to use a different list<br/>
hindering people from hearing what he has to say?<br/>
<br/>
Now, had Ned presented cogent arguments to challenge what unschoolers know<br/>
to be true about how children learn and could effectively show how his<br/>
evidence proved that unschoolers experience with their own children could<br/>
not be extrapolated to all children in similar environments, then banning<br/>
him would be censorship because that&#39;s the topic we&#39;re here to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
But banning an avalanche of political opinions that are only peripherally<br/>
related to unschooling is just list management.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (who believes that censorship of dissenting opinion is a tool of either<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then why would you want to continue associating with people you feel are<br/>
insecure or evil? What keeps drawing you back?<br/>

If you were having a party at your house and someone was not acting as you <br/>
wanted him to, and you asked, and he got belligerant, and your guests were <br/>
complaining and people were leaving the party, would you not feel the DUTY to <br/>
get him to leave?<br/>
<br/>
And if you had one party guest saying &quot;Lighten up, let him be drunk and <br/>
disorderly, your furniture isn&#39;t going to be destroyed, do you not believe in <br/>
freedom of expression?&quot; how would you feel?<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t the free world in its entirety.  It&#39;s not the United States <br/>
of America.  It&#39;s not All of Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a yahoolist associated with an online forum sponsored by Home Education <br/>
Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Helen&#39;s party, held in a house she pays money for, to some extent (not <br/>
the yahoo list, but the forum itself, the software for that, and related <br/>
matters).  It&#39;s part of the  business in which her family is engaged, Home <br/>
Education Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
So if you wouldn&#39;t let someone totally ignore you in your own home, would you <br/>
let them totally ignore you in a place of business you owned or were <br/>
responsible for?<br/>
<br/>
People have rights, and people CAN choose their own input and activities but <br/>
they don&#39;t get to decide on who else&#39;s &quot;property&quot; they can exercise their <br/>
rights.<br/>

Why is this continuing? Obviously you love Ned, he can be found elsewhere on <br/>
the internet. There is no need to harass people here over your obvious <br/>
dissent over the list owners decision.<br/>
No one has been manipulated, no one has been censored, it sounds like you <br/>
don&#39;t want to listen very well.<br/>
It has been explained and explained ad nauseum why Ned was banished. He <br/>
refused to follow the intent of the list, pure and simple.<br/>
Could you please let it go and join a list where Ned can speak freely about <br/>
his political views? This list is not intended for that purpose, and if you&#39;d <br/>
let it, we could get back to the bubbly, joyful, interesting unschooling <br/>
discussions.<br/>

after &quot;soul piercing question&quot; and turn every single question or post into <br/>
