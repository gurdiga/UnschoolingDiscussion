The Home Education Magazine website presents a new page of online support<br/>
designed specifically for support group contacts, newletter editors,<br/>
conference organizers, and others working to help homeschooling families:<br/>

<br/>
Support Group lists are easy to access through the colorful regional map of<br/>
the U.S. or via textlinks. This is the first &quot;all-in-one&quot; support groups<br/>
page, offering not only links to support groups and organizations in all<br/>
fifty states, as well as national and international groups, but also<br/>
offering links to helpful articles, news about laws and legal issues,<br/>
political insight and commentary, resources and more.<br/>
<br/>
The new HEM Support Groups page also provides access to HEM&#39;s terrific new<br/>
Support Groups Liaison, Tonia Mock. Tonia, a homeschooling mom from Oregon,<br/>
has been working hard to make this a useful resource for support group<br/>
contacts, and to provide articles and information on topics such as<br/>
Starting a Support Group, Deciding the Structure-informal to formal, How to<br/>
Publicize, Being the Contact, Running the Group, Sharing Information,<br/>
Organizing and Planning: Field Trips and Meetings, Avoiding Burnout and<br/>
many more. You can email Tonia at mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Groups@...">Groups@...</a><br/>
<br/>
The HEM Support Groups List, moderated by Tonia, is a new networking list<br/>
for anyone interested in working with support groups. Sign onto this list<br/>
to meet support group contacts, newsletter editors, conference organizers,<br/>
and others working to promote homeschooling. You can subscribe to the<br/>
HEM-SupportGroups list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.egroups.com/community/HEM-SupportGroups">http://www.egroups.com/community/HEM-SupportGroups</a><br/>
<br/>
Tonia will also be editing a new column in Home Education Magazine,<br/>
highlighting what support groups are doing across the country that may<br/>
spark ideas for others, as well as how groups address difficulties and<br/>
overcome them. If you have suggestions for future columns please get in<br/>
touch with Tonia at mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Groups@...">Groups@...</a><br/>
