<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420843362">&lt;snip&gt;When the <br/>
  pH in any one organ or organ system dips below 3.2, that organ or <br/>
  organ system ceases to function.  Lemon juice is 3.0 pH, and <br/>
  there is no known living organism that can survive at this acidic a <br/>
  level.<br/>
<br/>
  Then why can we eat lemons?<br/>

  I have a lemon question too.  A pH of 7.5-8.0 is considered too high (acidic) by alternative health practitioners, this high pH is one thing they attempt to lower in one&#39;s health recovery.  Aren&#39;t citrus fruits considered acidic, not base?  A pH of 3.0 is much too low to be considered acidic, isn&#39;t it?  To answer Mary Ellen&#39;s question, even if the pH of the lemon will not sustain life, I&#39;m guessing that ingesting it does not change overall body pH enough to kill us, or the digestive enzymes of the stomach correct it.  The duodenal valve of the stomach opens and releases stomach contents to the intestines when a certain pH is reached.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>A pH of three is so acidic that it can cause death.  Around 7 to 7.2 <br/>
is neutral....as it rises, it becomes alkaline, as it lowers, it <br/>
becomes acidic.  Naturopathic doctors (I&#39;m studying to be one) <br/>
would like your pH as neutral as possible.  However, since we eat <br/>
so many foods which produce acid when metabolized, they usually <br/>
encourage you to eat as many alkaline foods as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here is the misconception.....you can take a piece of litmus <br/>
paper and test an orange, a lemon, etc. and it will test very acidic.  <br/>
But the surface pH is not what we are referring to when we say a <br/>
food is alkaline or acidic.  It&#39;s the whether that food, when eaten <br/>
and metabolized, raises or lowers the body&#39;s total pH.  Almost <br/>
every fruit and vegetable, when eaten and metabolized, raises the <br/>
pH.  In other words, fruits and vegetables cause an alkaline <br/>
response in the body, just what we want.<br/>
<br/>
High protein foods such as meat and dairy products, and some <br/>
grains as well, when eaten produce acidic by-products.  Meat in <br/>
particular produces pyruvic acid when it is broken down.  Now if <br/>
you take a piece of meat and try to test the pH, you will not get a <br/>
very acidic pH.  But after it enters the body and is broken down, it <br/>
produces a very acidic response.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what we are talking about when we say something is acidic <br/>
or alkaline.<br/>
