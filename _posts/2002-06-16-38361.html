<div id="ygrps-yiv-573936478">We bought Chess-Mates CD-Rom for the computer for my son....I think we got it from Scholatic.....He loves it.  You play against the computer, but while playing the computer talks to you and shows you options, but lets you choose the moves.  Then tells you why it was or was not a good idea.  My 9 yr son loves it and my 5 yr old daughter has begun playing as well.  I think there are more than one level, too.<br/>
