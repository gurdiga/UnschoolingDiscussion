<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097918179">This message is in response not just to this one, but to the others who<br/>
posted about handwriting or &quot;good&quot; (I would say &quot;standard&quot;) grammar being<br/>
&quot;important.&quot;  I think it&#39;s fine for all of us to discuss our pet peeves but<br/>
there&#39;s a world of difference between acknowledging that something bugs us<br/>
and between saying it&#39;s &quot;important&quot; to know it.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding of unschooling is that it&#39;s up to the person who is<br/>
learning<br/>
to determine what is important, not anyone else.  You may find a closer,<br/>
more<br/>
spiritual connection to words through handwriting, but I may not.<br/>
Therefore,<br/>
it is not important for me to learn beautiful handwriting.  The same is true<br/>
of spelling or grammar.<br/>
<br/>
Very good points and I appreciate the difference in viewpoint.  I always<br/>
find it interesting and insightful to hear others points of view.  As usual,<br/>
I usually find that what I find to be &quot;important&quot; and meaningful is held in<br/>
a totally different light to someone else.  As unschooling is very new to me<br/>
and I know a lot (I feel) about the theory of unschooling but not<br/>
necessarily the practice of it I&#39;m very interested in discussing and<br/>
learning more about both.  The only experience in practice I have is very<br/>
limited to our family which includes myself, my husband and our daughters,<br/>
ages 6 and 2.  I know that which I find important and meaningful isn&#39;t<br/>
always important and meaningful to my husband and daughters.  It would<br/>
definitely be a boring world if we all were &quot;good&quot; in the same things and<br/>
found meaning and importance in the same things.  That is why some of us are<br/>
artist, mathematicians, musicians, accountants, engineers, carpenters, etc.<br/>
etc.  ......<br/>

Even better, &quot;deep thought&quot;,  I don&#39;t think I have an answer today.....It is<br/>
true that any academic thought or fact will be learned when needed and not<br/>
before.  As an example, I recently had need of the formula for figuring the<br/>
diameter of a circle using the circumference as the only &quot;known&quot; fact.  I<br/>
know I &quot;learned&quot; this formula in 9th grade algebra but didn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; it<br/>
until I needed it......<br/>
<br/>
Interesting.  I find that a computer makes it much easier for me to<br/>
organize my thoughts and get them written down.  I often have several<br/>
different ideas at once, and I can just quickly make notes, and then refer<br/>
to them as I go.  I wouldn&#39;t do that in a handwritten journal.<br/>
<br/>
My experience is much the same and the pen and paper help to slow me down<br/>
and gather my thoughts....to each his own!  My schooling makes me think that<br/>
when I&#39;m typing I must have it all together first!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  He points out that there is no<br/>
&gt; &quot;grammar and usage check&quot; on computers<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes there is.  At least I have one.  I don&#39;t always agree with it, but it&#39;s<br/>
interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently found that he (my husband) also has one on his computer but<br/>
also doesn&#39;t usually agree with it!!!LOL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think you make a very good argument that really fine penmanship is more of<br/>
an art than a skill.  I can practice and get to be a better typist -- get<br/>
faster and more accurate and get better at this skill.  I could practice<br/>
until forever and my penmanship would not improve.  Nor do I need or want it<br/>
to.  I think it would be neat to teach kids about how pretty and fun some<br/>
penmanship can be but to require good artistic talent seems cruel to me --<br/>
I&#39;m no artist -- my daughter is very talented (I think) -- but I hope noone<br/>
ever makes my kids feel bad that they aren&#39;t talented this way.<br/>
<br/>
Again, good points.  As this ability and talent comes naturally for me and<br/>
my oldest daughter I tend to think it should be easy and natural for<br/>
everyone, given practice.  On the other hand my husband and most of his<br/>
immediate family aren&#39;t talented in this manner and they are still very<br/>
talented and intelligent people so I should know better than to judge.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I still have another digest to digest so I&#39;d better save some<br/>
comments!LOL<br/>
