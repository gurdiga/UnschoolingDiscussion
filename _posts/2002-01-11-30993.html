<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606374250">Hi cathy...to answer youre post below, I am a christian , interested in <br/>
unschooling. to take it farther...I don&#39;t even like the organization of the <br/>
religious system. So I stay out of it. I liken it to prolly the same idea as <br/>
people here ...how they feel of  the organized school verses natural <br/>
learning... well same thing in my eyes as religion although im a christian. <br/>
I hate religion and its organization. anyway, thats all i have to say not <br/>
interested in preaching here or anywhere really... just noticed the <br/>
question.  :)   Faith<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello Cathy,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have come to a peaceful place knowing that I can be a Christian and an <br/>
&gt;unschooler too.  I came out of a very school-at-home group of home <br/>
&gt;schoolers and it was hard.  That is why I signed up for this list.  <br/>
&gt;Virtually every home school co-op, mom&#39;s group, or any other hs group <br/>
&gt;seemed very curriculum/scheduled/schoolie.  I knew that this wasn&#39;t right <br/>
&gt;for me or my family.  It came down to having to stay away from these <br/>
&gt;meetings, which left me little support.  I do know these folks as friends <br/>
&gt;and fellow believers, but usually we stay away from &quot;education&quot; as a topic. <br/>
&gt;  I find I have too much explaining to do, they know that I am relaxed and <br/>
&gt;that&#39;s enough for them.  Maybe when I have more time, but then they seem <br/>
&gt;very intimidated and threatened sometimes by what I say.  I really don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;mean to say that what they are doing is wrong, but sometimes just telling <br/>
&gt;them what I think is threatening to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My faith does not say that I need to have lessons at a certain time of the <br/>
&gt;day, Christianity does not say to me that I have to make my children learn <br/>
&gt;certain things at certain times of the day or even certain times in their <br/>
&gt;lives.  My example and the work of the Holy Spirit in THEIR HEARTS  is the <br/>
&gt;key.  I provide all the learning tools (as my budget and time allow), my <br/>
&gt;own curiosity of life and living and learning as an example, and trust God <br/>
&gt;to work as well in their lives as he does in mine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Blessings,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Elaine<br/>

&gt;   Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Hello<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Hi all.<br/>
&gt;   My name is Cathy, married to Craig, and living in South-Africa. I have 5<br/>
&gt;   children, who have always been homeschooled, oldest is nearly 12, <br/>
&gt;youngest<br/>
&gt;   is 5 months.<br/>
&gt;   I have always been a fairly flexible/relaxed homeschooler, and<br/>
&gt;   have never used a pre-packaged curriculum (very unusual around here!!! -<br/>
&gt;   many people in RSA, I think because of the HS movement still being so <br/>
&gt;young<br/>
&gt;   here, would feel VERY insecure without the guidance of their friendly<br/>
&gt;   curriculum provider...)<br/>
&gt;   I have been much inspired by the writings of Charlotte Mason, and to a <br/>
&gt;large<br/>
&gt;   extent it is due to her that I have become interested in Unschooling -<br/>
&gt;   although she was not an unschooler, her incredible insights about the <br/>
&gt;mind<br/>
&gt;   of the child and having respect for children have laid a definite <br/>
&gt;foundation<br/>
&gt;   in my thinking.<br/>
&gt;   I am particularly interested to clarify whether or not I can be both a<br/>
&gt;   Christian and an Unschooler without compromising on one or the other - <br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt;   is fairly heated debate on this topic in homeschooling circles I notice! <br/>
&gt;In<br/>
&gt;   the short time that I have been conducting my &#39;&#39;research&#39;&#39;, I have <br/>
&gt;become<br/>
&gt;   convinced that it is possible, but I don&#39;t yet know how to explain how <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;   why!! As a result one of the things I am interested in is in<br/>
&gt;   communicating with people who are Unschooling, and who are Christians, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;   who feel that it is possible to reconcile the two.<br/>
&gt;   We are currently conducting an &quot;Unschooling Experiment&quot; in our home (we <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;   been Unschooling since 9 October), and I am pretty excited <br/>
&gt;(UNDERSTATEMENT)<br/>
&gt;   with what I am observing. I am reading John Holt, who, I think,<br/>
&gt;   introduced the seminal ideas that led to Unschooling, and I am <br/>
&gt;challenged<br/>
&gt;   and intrigued. I have also been reading the posts over the last 2 weeks, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;   am really inspired<br/>
&gt;   and encouraged.<br/>
&gt;   I would like to know more, so I am here to learn....I hope all you <br/>
&gt;veterans<br/>
&gt;   won&#39;t mind too much answering the same old questions that I am bound to<br/>
&gt;   ask!! My husband and I have been involved with the leadership of a<br/>
&gt;   home-schooling association, and therefore know how much patience is <br/>
&gt;required<br/>
&gt;   when those really basic, level I questions keep being asked... :-)<br/>
&gt;   Blessings<br/>
&gt;   Cathy<br/>

I&#39;ve seen this used for PROBABLY several times now.  It seems to me, <br/>
all of the users are Canadian.  Is that common up your way?  Is it <br/>
just coincidence?  Am I misplacing people and it is more widespread?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400924197">There is a new book written by two Christian unschooling moms called<br/>
Christian Unschooling. The authors are Teri J. Brown and Elissa M. Wahl. I<br/>
saw an excerpt of it in the latest issue of The Link, which is a free<br/>
homeschooling magazine published in California. You may be able to find<br/>
this article on their website, which is:<br/>
<br/>
www.homeschoolnewslink.com<br/>
<br/>
I seem to recall another article on this topic in a recent issue of Home<br/>
Education or Growing Without Schooling, in which a woman talked about<br/>
hiding the fact that she is an unschooler from her support group friends.<br/>
It it, she said, &quot;Where does God say &#39;Thou shalt use a curriculum.&#39;&quot;<br/>
I thought that was pretty funny. It seems like there are a growing number<br/>
of Christian unschoolers, which I think is great.<br/>
