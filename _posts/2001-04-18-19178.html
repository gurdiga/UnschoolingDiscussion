<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828564852">Does anyone have any thoughts on Nintendo?<br/>
<br/>
Our 8yo ds wants a set desperately. My husband and I think it&#39;s mindless <br/>
entertainment and not a good way to spend one&#39;s time and don&#39;t feel like <br/>
spending money on it or turning our TV over to it.<br/>
<br/>
Ds does have his own computer with lots of computer games. He doesn&#39;t spend <br/>
an inordinate amount of time on that.<br/>
<br/>
A while back he was begging for Gameboy, which we didn&#39;t want around either <br/>
because we thought it seemed addictive. He eventually got over wanting it.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight when we told him (again) that we were not going to buy a Nintendo he <br/>
burst into tears, ran off to bed and wailed loudly in bed for half an hour. <br/>
Yesterday he played at the house of a friend who has a Nintendo, and it <br/>
seems like every time he plays with one, he obsesses about it for a week, <br/>
pesters us for one, etc. As a result we&#39;ve decided we&#39;ll invite those kids <br/>
over here to play from now on instead.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like all the public-schooled friends we have, have Nintendo. When I <br/>
went to pick him up from there, he and the two boys were sitting in front of <br/>
the game, totally oblivious to everything around them, eyes fixed on the <br/>
screen, mouths hanging open. It was a beautiful day outside but no interest <br/>
in playing outdoors! THe kids&#39; mom advised me to hold off getting one, <br/>
because when you do, it&#39;s all they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
I realize if something is this compelling, it must have some value, even if <br/>
I can&#39;t see what it is. I&#39;m also wondering if this is an interest that blows <br/>
over, or if it will lead to vid-game potato kids with no inclination to do <br/>
anything else!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464761222"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Believe me, it doesnt blow over. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me, I think it does.  If my son plays nonstop nintendo for a <br/>
period of time, he eventually gets tired and goes on to something <br/>
else.  If there are lots of interesting things to do around the house, <br/>
he doesn&#39;t play it that often.  But I don&#39;t worry about it when he <br/>
does.  It is normal for us to want to do the things that we enjoy.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t dream of not allowing him to play it if he enjoys it, just as I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want anyone to keep me from being on the internet <br/>
because I enjoy it so much.  We all have the right to our interests, <br/>
even our children.  As a parent, my job is to keep him from <br/>
physical harm and provide an interesting and loving atmosphere,  <br/>
we don&#39;t have to agree with all their choices.  They have the right to <br/>
self-government just as we do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730836977">We feel pretty strongly in agreement with what you&#39;ve<br/>
said here. Once they have Nintendo, the rest of life<br/>
seems to stop. I don&#39;t know if that would happen for<br/>
unschooled kids, but it sure happens for the kids I<br/>
know who have it. We&#39;re lucky because our kids have<br/>
never asked for it. But if they did, we&#39;d have them<br/>
save their own money for one if they wanted it that<br/>
badly. I think anything kids want parents to spend<br/>
money on that the parents don&#39;t want to spend money<br/>
on, well, it can be handled by telling them to save<br/>
their own money for it. Do they want it that badly?<br/>
Well, you&#39;ll find out! Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000795038">We have Nintendo, Gameboy, Atari, and a couple of others.  They obsessed for<br/>
a few weeks and now they are all gathering dust except the Gameboy which is<br/>
great for pulling out when you travel.  Brings the &quot;are we there yet&quot;<br/>
questions down to a liveable minimum.<br/>
<br/>
Kidlet #5 started playing them when he was about 5, became the neighborhood<br/>
whiz kid at them (beat all the high school kids) but he never obsessed over<br/>
it.  I think because he knew he only had so much time because he knew the<br/>
television wasn&#39;t just for him and the game.  And because we never told him<br/>
he couldn&#39;t play the games just that he couldn&#39;t hog the television.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701630781">I&#39;ll tell you a quick story...<br/>
I had a neighbor who was a grade school teacher. Her son at the time was 5. My<br/>
husband and I at the time had no kids yet but we did have nintendo (all of them;<br/>
the original, super, 64 & now a gameboy). My husband and I grew up with video<br/>
games and spent lots of our time together playing with it (it was definitely<br/>
cheaper than going to the movies). Anyway, we would on occasion, babysit for our<br/>
neighbors and during this time he had found out that we had nintendo. His mother<br/>
refused to buy him one, afraid he would spend every waking hour playing this<br/>
instead of playing outside with his friends. But she thought that it was ok for<br/>
him to play with it when he was over at our house. To make a long story short<br/>
(too late), what she did notice is that his hand-eye coordination improved<br/>
greatly. He did not become obsessed and could put the game down whenever he was<br/>
asked to without complaint. The games that we had were not the extremely violent<br/>
ones either, they were the Mario bros, racing, Zelda, pong, etc. No one getting<br/>
their heads blown off or blood flying everywhere. Those type of games are still<br/>
not purchased in my house. She did end up buying a used nintendo for him and<br/>
rented games from our library.<br/>
<br/>
My dd just received a gameboy this last Christmas from Santa. She has never<br/>
played with one in the past so never even really knew what one is. She has a<br/>
total of 3 games for this. We mainly thought it would be helpful when we take<br/>
our journeys in the car that were going to be over 30 min. It helps the time go<br/>
by. She is not possessed by this and in fact, hasn&#39;t recently even played with<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If you are really concerned about nintendo and its effects, rent one first or<br/>
borrow one from a friend. Set up certain times that the system can be used and<br/>
see how your family reacts to it. Some kids, I would imagine do get a little<br/>
crazed when they first get one, but my two dds get more excited if I make<br/>
brownies!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and on a final note;  there is a website that you can go to that actually<br/>
has the exact nintendo games that you can play on line now. I do not have it<br/>
here with me but I could research it later if you are interested.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766678245">It really depends on the kid(s).  My neighbors boy does nothing but sit in <br/>
front of it after school, while my son maybe plays an hour a day at <br/>
most.  I think they can be useful, but also limits should apply to how many <br/>
hours and what types of games are allowed.  I&#39;ve found that Playstation has <br/>
more family-friendly games than the other systems (Scrabble, Wheel of <br/>
Fortune, Jeopardy, etc.) as well as more kid-type games.  I would suggest <br/>
popping by an online store to check out the games yourself as far as <br/>
ratings (ebgames.com has the ratings and what to expect, such as comic <br/>
mischief, language, etc.) and prices go.  Nintendo is much more expensive <br/>
for games than Playstation and if you look on Ebay you can find good <br/>
deals.  Setting limits is the whole key though :).<br/>

  nintendo<br><br></font></div><tt><br><br>Does anyone have any thoughts on 
  Nintendo?<br><br>Our 8yo ds wants a set desperately. My husband and I think 
  it&#39;s mindless <br>entertainment and not a good way to spend one&#39;s time and 
  don&#39;t feel like <br>spending money on it or turning our TV over to 
  it.<br><br>Ds does have his own computer with lots of computer games. He 
  doesn&#39;t spend <br>an inordinate amount of time on that.<br><br>A while back he 
  was begging for Gameboy, which we didn&#39;t want around either <br>because we 
  thought it seemed addictive. He eventually got over wanting it.<br><br>Tonight 
  when we told him (again) that we were not going to buy a Nintendo he <br>burst 
  into tears, ran off to bed and wailed loudly in bed for half an hour. 
  <br>Yesterday he played at the house of a friend who has a Nintendo, and it 
  <br>seems like every time he plays with one, he obsesses about it for a week, 
  <br>pesters us for one, etc. As a result we&#39;ve decided we&#39;ll invite those kids 
  <br>over here to play from now on instead.<br><br>It seems like all the 
  public-schooled friends we have, have Nintendo. When I <br>went to pick him up 
  from there, he and the two boys were sitting in front of <br>the game, totally 
  oblivious to everything around them, eyes fixed on the <br>screen, mouths 
  hanging open. It was a beautiful day outside but no interest <br>in playing 
  outdoors! THe kids&#39; mom advised me to hold off getting one, <br>because when 
  you do, it&#39;s all they want to do.<br><br>I realize if something is this 
  compelling, it must have some value, even if <br>I can&#39;t see what it is. I&#39;m 
  also wondering if this is an interest that blows <br>over, or if it will lead 
  to vid-game potato kids with no inclination to do <br>anything 
  else!<br><br>Annette

&lt;&lt; Believe me, it doesnt blow over. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know everyone&#39;s experiences are different so for what it&#39;s worth:<br/>
<br/>
Our boys, 7 and 8, have unlimited Nintendo, Gameboy and computer time. This <br/>
morning Jesse read his book on chess puzzles, Owen got out one of his bird <br/>
identification books. Meredith, 14, searched the Internet for unicorn <br/>
pictures for an art class we&#39;re teaching this summer. Then the boys made <br/>
lemon/lime/orange juice and went to dig dirt to plant the seeds. They just <br/>
had mac and cheese for lunch and Owen is in front of the TV half watching Mr. <br/>
Rogers. Jesse is washing an old toy with a toothbrush. Mer is reading a <br/>
dragon book. Nintendo hasn&#39;t been on today, but I might remind them that it&#39;s <br/>
there if they come to me with the &quot;bored&quot; thing.<br/>
<br/>
Owen has learned lots of math and reading while playing Nintendo and Gameboy <br/>
and Neopets on the computer. Some days when the weather is beautiful, the <br/>
boys are glued to Nintendo and some days when it rains they are outside in <br/>
their forts in the woods, playing Survivor. I feel like a hypocrite when I <br/>
limit something that they enjoy. (I don&#39;t mean that this doesn&#39;t work for <br/>
other parents. Like I said, we&#39;re all different. For sure there are other <br/>
parents who model structure and schedules better than I do -- let&#39;s face it, <br/>
I&#39;m lazy.) When I&#39;m in the middle of a favorite book, no one says, &quot;Why don&#39;t <br/>
you put that down and go get some exercise? You&#39;ve been glued to that book <br/>
all day.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Besides, I have this feeling that if Nintendo is what they desire, there must <br/>
be a good reason. I kind of trust that feeling, you know? (Have you seen kids <br/>
play this stuff and how fast their minds are clicking along? I know I can&#39;t <br/>
do it like they do.) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, add one to the &quot;no limits on Nintendo&quot; poll. (Also, I&#39;m a Liberal <br/>
Democrat, with Green Party leanings. Any correlation between Nintendo limits <br/>
and political bent?)<br/>
