Michele, you may find someone locally to stay with---and I&#39;m not <br/>
discouraging it, because I&#39;d rather have you come and stay with a local <br/>
than not come at all.  *But* your staying at the hotel is how we &quot;pay&quot; <br/>
for the conference rooms, so I&#39;d like to encouarge folks to stay at the <br/>
Sheraton. Plus, things are so busy at the conference---early mornings <br/>
and late nights and afternoon naps, maybe? &lt;g&gt; that you would probably <br/>
find that &quot;commuting&quot; is a pain.<br/>
<br/>
You might have some luck finding folks to say with while travelling <br/>
there and back to save on $$$. That&#39;s what the yahoo group is for:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:liveandlearnconference@yahoogroups.com">liveandlearnconference@yahoogroups.com</a> ---to help you make those <br/>
arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting you!<br/>

Hi Michele,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to the conference again this year - from Hamilton, ON. We will <br/>
be staying at the hotel, though. It really *is* worth the money!!!<br/>
