<div id="ygrps-yiv-556692062">For my son, if he has dairy at all in any form, he gets extremely <br/>
sensory-seeking. He will literally run around the house crashing <br/>
into walls, people, furniture. It&#39;s like his body feels <br/>

serious sensory input.<br/>

Did you find this out by experimenting with his diet? My son is extremely high energy - and I have often thought it to do with sugar...  I never thought about dairy - any info you have that you would like to pass along would be appreciated ;-)<br/>
<br/>
He also tends to be loud and plays rough. He is very active and doesn&#39;t sit still much (He&#39;s 5) which is ok - but at times it is hard doing things like going to the store - or church - or somewhere else where he needs to be quiet. <br/>
<br/>
How do you know if this is just your child&#39;s &quot;personality&quot;? I have often thought if he was in school they would be saying &quot;Ritalin!!!&quot; for which I am thankful to have him home and able to go out and burn off his energy.<br/>

  &gt; This is something we&#39;ve been worried about, the fact that it&#39;s <br/>
  extending to others, and not everybody likes to play as rough as him <br/>

  I don&#39;t know if this has been mentioned, but some kids are extremely <br/>
  sensory-seeking. This can be related to all kinds of things - diet, <br/>
  basic brain wiring, environmental influences, etc. There are all <br/>
  kinds of things you can do to help him get his needs for sensory <br/>
  input met. Do a Google serach on &quot;sensory integration&quot; and you&#39;ll <br/>
  find a lot of information. I also like the book &quot;The Out-Of-Sync <br/>
  Child&quot; (don&#39;t let the title throw you off), which completely <br/>
  explains sensory integration.<br/>

  into walls, people, furniture. It&#39;s like his body feels <br/>

  serious sensory input. Obviously, he doesn&#39;t eat dairy anymore <br/>
  unless he accidentally gets it. But he can become sensory-seeking in <br/>
  a milder incarnation if he gets stressed or overtired or hungry or <br/>
  is in a situation in which he feels nervous. Often he will come up <br/>
  and bump or crash into me. Now that I&#39;ve recognized this for what it <br/>
  is, I can offer him a deep squeezing hug as much as he needs, and <br/>
  this really seems to help. I&#39;ll just ask &quot;Do you need a squeezy <br/>
  hug?&quot; and usually he&#39;ll say yes. I think it was really important for <br/>
  me to move beyond *reacting* to what he&#39;s doing and to be proactive <br/>
  about helping him with what his body is needing at the time. Sensory-<br/>
  seeking kids can have a very hard time being around smaller or more <br/>
  fragile kids, because they sometimes are not able to effectively <br/>
  limit how much contact their body gives out. Not sure if this is the <br/>
  case with your kid, but thought I&#39;d throw this out in case it helps.<br/>

We have had teachers tell us that we should get Jaiden in school ASAP so that we can get him on ritalin, with out any problems. :-P--- <br/>

Well, there was a big study at the Mayo clinic linking dairy proteins <br/>
to autism. Something about the fact that in some children, their gut <br/>
does not prevent the dairy protein from passing through, and it ends <br/>
up lodging in their brain and blocking certain messages. Obviously, <br/>
I&#39;m paraphrasing very roughly, but you can probably find the study <br/>
online somewhere. I know that for some kids with SID (sensory <br/>
integration dysfunction), removing dairy and/or gluten helps <br/>
dramatically, so we gave it a try. It takes about 4 - 6 weeks though <br/>
to really tell if it will work. <br/>
<br/>
My son also had multiple other food allergies and ended up with hives <br/>
and all kinds of problems from that. So it took awhile to get that <br/>
all sorted out, get the allergies addressed via NAET (natural method <br/>
of eliminating allergies) and then figure out that dairy was the one <br/>
thing that just didn&#39;t work for his body (he had other problems from <br/>
dairy as well, like intestinal problems).<br/>

<br/>
Well, I&#39;m obviously very glad not to be the kind of person to <br/>
automatically turn to a school system or drugs to solve something <br/>
like this. I can easily see how if my kid continued to eat dairy and <br/>
entered the school system, he&#39;d be drugged by the system one way or <br/>
the other. Honestly, if he gets dairy, his entire personality is *so* <br/>
dramatically changed, it&#39;s obvious. It&#39;s like he&#39;s himself, but <br/>
trapped in this psychotic, crashing around body. He gets highly <br/>
emotional, screaming and weeping and he is so scared and feels out of <br/>
control. I&#39;m so glad we figured it out and it turned out to be <br/>
something very simple to deal with. Of course, it wasn&#39;t obvious <br/>
before we took dairy out of his diet, I just thought that&#39;s the way <br/>
he was. Spirited, extremely &quot;high needs&quot; kid, the baby that never <br/>

sling, and all that. Now I know that&#39;s not true. He&#39;s still very high <br/>
energy, but that&#39;s much different than being totally discombobulated.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The teachers have this 5 min. questionare that they answer about the childs behavior, that gets refered to the school counsler, that get refered to a psycitrist (they have a list of the ones that will do this) that then gives a recomendation to the parents and the school that the child be reviewed. It usally results in the child being put on ritalin or something eles. Most parents don&#39;t fight it, it happens so fast and no wants to be told that somrthing is wrong with their child. If a parent fights the recomendation, social services is notified and sometimes they step in and insist. If they don&#39;t insist and/or the parents are still fighting the teacher will request that the student be removed from her/his class for disruption and harmful behavior, the child is then placed in special education classes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s discusting, but it happens.<br/>
