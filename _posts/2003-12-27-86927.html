<div id="ygrps-yiv-559414529">Has anyone seen this movie yet?  I went last night and really enjoyed it.<br/>
It has a pretty good story and is visually breathtaking.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it showed some unschooling issues very well in an entertaining<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
The mother was at times displeased with the young boy&#39;s behavior.  But she<br/>
never scolded him or punished him.  She simply diverted him.<br/>
<br/>
The samurai treated his enemy with kindness, courtesy and respect and soon<br/>
had earned a friend.<br/>
<br/>
The American was never forced to do anything but was simply immersed in a<br/>
situation where he was basically free to do as he wanted but again, treated<br/>
well...and he chose to emulate the dignity he saw in others.<br/>
<br/>
What did y&#39;all think?<br/>
