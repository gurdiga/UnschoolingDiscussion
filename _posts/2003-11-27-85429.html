know that I am really new here and I am probably mistaken.  <br/>
I don&#39;t understand however:  How is laying gifts out and then <br/>
telling them to not open them giving them true freedom? I know that <br/>
you aren&#39;t telling me to do so, but I would like to know how that <br/>
worked for your family.  I thought by laying the gifts out and <br/>
letting the kids decide to open them or not was giving them the <br/>
truest form of freedom and respect.  But as you read I am torn b/c I <br/>
can foresee 2 very let down children on xmas morning when that tree <br/>
has only 1-2 gifts maybe instead of 10-15 or however many I can <br/>
afford.<br/>
*************<br/>
What if you let the kids know that it&#39;s important to YOU that you get to <br/>
share the opening on Christmas? It&#39;s a ritual, and ritual is important.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing: maybe they just like unwrapping gifts. Instead of putting <br/>
all the stuff out ahead of time, what if you got lots of small Advent gifts <br/>
(candy, little toys, fun socks), wrapped them, and had one opened each day until <br/>
Christmas? We use an Advent calendar with chocolate. That&#39;s fun. Once we got a <br/>
cool (but expensive) Playmobile advent calendar...that was VERY cool.<br/>
<br/>
The other way out of this....they want you to put things out as they&#39;re <br/>
wrapped. So don&#39;t wrap them until the last minute, or, as Sandra said, wrap and put <br/>
out boring stuff first. Instead focus on other Christmasy stuff, then <br/>
furiously wrap at the last minute.<br/>
<br/>
LOL Because he wasn&#39;t in school, Julian was free to believe in Santa until <br/>
the last minute...so he did until he was 12, at least officially. <br/>
