<div id="ygrps-yiv-501170291">Congratulations on your new baton!   I was just unpacking loads of boxes from <br/>
high school and came across my color guard uniform.. fits again after losing <br/>
the baby weight!  My flag is still at my parents but in the summer when <br/>
visiting it&#39;s fun to get it out and show my ds &dh the hidden talents mom has... how <br/>
to flip and spin that flag is just like riding a bike. It&#39;s only been 15 <br/>
years or so...LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089040196">I did color guard, showed my younger sister a couple things with a broom I&#39;d tied a pillowcase to (not QUITE the same, but it worked better than just a broom when tossing)...now she&#39;s on her school&#39;s color guard and thinking about auditioning for a nearby group that competes with DCI. <br/>
 <br/>
Sarah has also been asking about cheerleading, which I did in high school as well. Now that I&#39;m not pregnant, I&#39;ve begun teaching her some things that I know. Signups for next year&#39;s PopWarner are in March so we&#39;re planning to sign her up, and enroll her in a gymnastics class for tumbling here shortly as well. <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve both benefitted greatly from my sharing these interests with her. <br/>
 <br/>
At Christmas time, a friend gave us a huge 7ft tree. Paul took out his small axe to cut it down some with. His friend Josh was here and as guys do they got to bragging and Paul said he could take it and plant it in that tree over there...and Josh said &quot;Do it.&quot; so he did. Logan thought it was the coolest thing, and listen with eyes wide as Paul talked about throwing knives too. Josh took out one of his knives and Paul threw it at a mark he made on the tree. Then they got to talking about archery and deer hunting with bows...The looks on Logan&#39;s face were priceless..full of awe and wonder....<br/>
 <br/>
I know the two of them...and Paul has said the girls as well if they become interested..will have plenty to keep them busy as he gets older. We&#39;ve promised Logan his own fishing rod/reel for this spring to go along with the one that I won for Paul in a raffle just before Christmas. <br/>
