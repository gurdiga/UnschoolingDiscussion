&gt; &gt;So, I keep seeing these statements that unschoolers read later and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;wondering why.  I mean, I understand and it is to be expected that some<br/>
&gt; &gt;children will learn later than other children as they are all individuals<br/>
&gt; &gt;and not some little wind up toys that are pre-programed to learn things at<br/>
&gt; &gt;certain ages.  However, it seems that the stats are somewhat titled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My guess is that a lot of those &quot;late&quot; readers would be pushed, either in<br/>
&gt; school or doing school-at-home, and that a lot of them would more or less<br/>
&gt; get reading at an earlier age than if they were the ones deciding when to<br/>
&gt; read.  Of course a lot of those will likely become readers who choose not<br/>
&gt; to read unless made to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son Julian learned to read easily and well, when he was still in school <br/>
(he left after third grade to unschool) --but I don&#39;t think school had <br/>
anything to do with his learning to read. He was passionate about it almost <br/>
immediately, and never went through any struggle.  In fact, one of the main <br/>
reasons we decided we had to pull him out is that he told us the problem with <br/>
school was that there was never enough time to read. School more interfered <br/>
than helped him with reading.<br/>
<br/>
I think kids pick these things up when they&#39;re ready, however we school, <br/>
unschool, or try to influence them. You MIGHT in school or homeschool be able <br/>
to push a kid who&#39;s not ready to read, but will probably mess up any chance <br/>
of the child&#39;s LIKING it. <br/>
<br/>
I was a very early reader (early 4) and my mom says she never &quot;taught&quot; me...I <br/>
just started reading, because I loved it.<br/>
