<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728038406">I was just wondering if there is a good &#39;unschooling way&#39; of keeping <br/>
records of kids activities that would be considered &#39;educational&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
Not that I&#39;m worried about the legal aspect of it, because we live in <br/>
a very &#39;homeschool friendly&#39; area.  But some of my friends and family<br/>
(three are teachers)think we just play all the time, and that <br/>
they &#39;CAN&#39;T be really LEARNING anything.  It seems everyone wants to <br/>
see something &#39;official looking&#39; I guess....like a report card, a <br/>
progress report, a schedule, etc.  In other words &#39;school&#39; at home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done pretty well at avoiding their questions, because so far, <br/>
their questions have all been of a negative nature.<br/>
<br/>
I understand their concerns, because I would have been right there <br/>
along with them at one time, questioning someone who I thought was <br/>
neglecting their child&#39;s education.<br/>
<br/>
I think my problem in satisfying their questions is that I can become <br/>
VERY adamant in DEFENDING my choices, and can&#39;t be &#39;reasonable&#39; <br/>
enough to come across as having any brains at all:)  So I end up just <br/>
avoiding their questions.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anybody&#39;s business, really, but I do want to keep <br/>
my friends:)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836763034">We have a three ring binder for each child (have since they were babies, so <br/>
it&#39;s not a homeschooling thing) and occasionally something goes in <br/>
there--something they&#39;ve drawn or written, a photo of something they&#39;ve done, <br/>
programs of things they&#39;ve been in, stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
IF I needed documentation of homeschooling, I would just try to put more of <br/>
that same sort of stuff.  Then when  a book&#39;s too full it goes in the xerox <br/>
box of baby-souvenirs and such that I have for each kid in the hall closet.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea might be to do something like a Christmas letter three or four <br/>
times a year, with updates on not just kid-projects, but the yard, the pets, <br/>
whatever.  It would be a cool longterm diary sort of thing the kids could <br/>
have when they&#39;re grown, and would serve to show relatives what&#39;s up without <br/>
separating education from life.<br/>

such a project:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934933114">Another great idea!:)  <br/>
<br/>
I already have notebooks, but somehow it doesn&#39;t satisfy <br/>
their &#39;grade&#39; mentality, but the idea of a quarterly newsletter type <br/>
email to send to the whole family, and friends, is a wonderful idea!  <br/>
I like the fact that it would be sort of a &#39;journal&#39; of their <br/>
learning experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Once, (can&#39;t remember where, though) I saw where someone had compiled <br/>
a list of activities that would &#39;qualify&#39; as &#39;educational&#39;, and a <br/>
sort of a &#39;daily log&#39; sort of form, where the activities could be <br/>
filled in as they&#39;re done.  I wish I could find it again!  But I <br/>
think I&#39;ll just come up with my own, and go from there.<br/>
<br/>
I basically just want to be able to hand them something &#39;they&#39; would <br/>
call &#39;adequate&#39;....LOL.<br/>

If you cater to their &quot;need&quot; too much, they&#39;ll think they were right, though. <br/>
If you cater too much I hope you don&#39;t start to think they&#39;re right too!<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s something to be gained from this (substantial peace and quiet, <br/>
impressive holiday gifts, a big inheritance), go for it, but if the same <br/>
amount of time could be better spent just being with your kids...   give the <br/>
relatives a book on unschooling with a big red ribbon around it!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111562302">Keep records but keep track by what is REAL, not by school subject areas. <br/>
That is a very very different mindset.<br/>
<br/>
For example, have a record sheet - but have the categories be:<br/>
<br/>
listening, watching, talking, going, doing, making, etc.<br/>

know.  As long as you don&#39;t let the list make you feel pressured to &quot;cover&quot; <br/>

course, if your kids are anything like my boy, they&#39;ll be all over the map <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663222563">I&#39;d have to agree with Sandra. The more I try to &quot;prove&quot; unschooling to <br/>
others the more they try to disprove me. I now speak with a confident aire, <br/>
not trying to belittle those who do not homeschool or unschool, but that I AM <br/>
confident that my choice is right for MY family. I too, will be ready to hand <br/>
over a book on unschooling the next time someone questions my judgement. I <br/>
find it very upsetting when someone gives an uneducated opinion. If they want <br/>
to make a statement or question methods of learning they should at least have <br/>
some idea of what they&#39;re talking about!!!</div>

<br/>
The thing is, I guess, they learned in school that school is necessary for <br/>
learning.  They learned from teachers and parents that they had learned <br/>
because they had paid attention to teachers and because they had &quot;done their <br/>
work.&quot;  So they think they are giving an educated opinion!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to tell them the news without suggesting (strongly, whether you <br/>
want to or not) that they have a lot to learn AND that their education wasn&#39;t <br/>
so important or necessary as they had hoped.  It&#39;s a big chasm to bridge, <br/>
even with people who really do want to understand.<br/>
<br/>
At least now I can give them a business card with a website on it, and <br/>
www.unschooing.com to refer them to!<br/>
