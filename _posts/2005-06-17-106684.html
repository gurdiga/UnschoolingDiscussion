Yes.  No twinkie is as bad as either of those.<br/>
Those aren&#39;t food.<br/>
 <br/>
My children (my teens) have done neither of those, though we never told  them <br/>
not to.   Giving honest information without sensation or  judgmental language <br/>
has worked wondrously well for lots of families.  It  increases the parents&#39; <br/>
credibility if their information is factual without  being all pre-labelled <br/>
with &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;crap&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; and  &quot;ideal.&quot;   Sure some of that <br/>
information will be apparent to kids,  but hoping toe just &quot;teach&quot; kids what is good <br/>
and bad and having them believe  it because the parents said so is <br/>
problematical if a family&#39;s priorities and  principles involve helping kids figure those <br/>
things out in personal and  natural ways.<br/>
