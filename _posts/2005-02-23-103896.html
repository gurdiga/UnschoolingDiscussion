<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377866666">Is there anybody on this list that lives in or near Columbus or<br/>
anywhere in OH, for that matter? My husband&#39;s job is transferring us<br/>
from Michigan (very easy state for unschooling) to Ohio in a matter of<br/>
a few weeks and I wanted to get in touch with people in OH and find<br/>
out how the laws really work. I&#39;ve read the HSLDA site and I think<br/>
they make it more frightening than it actually is. I&#39;m concerned about<br/>
reporting and things like that.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to clog this list, so please reply to me privately at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abbyaldrich1@...">abbyaldrich1@...</a>. Thanks!<br/>
