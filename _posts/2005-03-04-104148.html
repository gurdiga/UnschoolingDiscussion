<div id="ygrps-yiv-534607388">I don&#39;t know what possessed me to (instead of clicking  &quot;delete&quot; as I&#39;ve done <br/>
for months andmonths) READ this digest this time, but I  see some dear &quot;old&quot; <br/>
friends posting, and wanted to say hello, I think of you,  glad you&#39;re still <br/>
out there!<br/>
 <br/>
  I haven&#39;t been reading for quite a while because we&#39;d sort  of moved our <br/>
unschooling life (or, rather, it moved itself) into a cheerful  &quot;auto pilot&quot; and <br/>
had nothing much to discuss.  However, I&#39;ll think I&#39;ll try  and start <br/>
reading, again, and catch up. We&#39;re entering the &quot;what about college&quot;  phase in our <br/>
lives and we&#39;ve suddenly got NEW questions and things to  ponder...<br/>

The follow up to the Kirby bit is that he&#39;s taking a couple of classes <br/>
(started with three, dropped one) and plans to take at least two in fall (Spanish <br/>
and English, he mentioned the other day--his whole group of unschooled friends <br/>
and one of their moms plan to take a Spanish class  all together).  Right now <br/>
he&#39;s taking a class on college success which he really likes and a math class <br/>
(math 99, not for college credit, but that&#39;s where he tested in out of five <br/>
remedial levels, in the middle one, with never a math lesson before).  At the <br/>
halfway mark, he has an A in there and is having fun with it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT my favorite topic for this list at all, but people have asked me to <br/>
give updates sometimes, so your post made a good excuse for another one.  <br/>
