 </span></blockquote>Thanks Anita, we think it is wonderful, and we are working on<br/>
getting it preserved forever by taking out a conservation easement<br/>
on the entire 175 acres, that basically involves selling the<br/>
developement rights.   We will be allowed to build on a small<br/>
section of the farm bordered by the existing buildings, but will not<br/>
be allowed to increase the amount of buildings by more than 20%.<br/>
It is a forever thing and the land should always remain intact.<br/>

<br/>
We have 15.5 acres in southeastern Pennsylvania:  meadow, pasture, woods,<br/>
pond, barn, house.  We currently have it classified as farmland.  Farms on<br/>
all sides, including Amish across the road.  We, too, hope to keep it from<br/>
being developed, but are putting off doing it until our son gets older and<br/>
we have more time.  I am gradually introducing native wildflowers to the<br/>
meadow, and eventually hope to do the same in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
We have 3 Scottish Black Face Sheep, 6 chikens, 2 dogs, 6 cats.  A pair of<br/>
Canada Geese nest on the pond every year, and a Great Blue Heron fishes<br/>
there regularly.  Something eats the goslings, though, which makes me very<br/>
sad.  Could be a fox, which we have, or a snapping turtle, which we may or<br/>
may not have.  Also, a possum frequents the barn and decimated our flock of<br/>
banty hens.  We  now have them in a hen house, but, I think the banties<br/>
aren ot happy being cooped up, even though they have a run.  Do you know<br/>
anything about banties?<br/>

Your place sounds wonderful too. We miss seeing keruru, we used to have them<br/>
visit us on Waiheke. They would sit and gorge themselves on loquat fruit!<br/>
Sometimes they seemed hardly able to fly away they&#39;d be so full.<br/>
<br/>
Where abouts in New Zealand are you?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in Hamilton now, in the suburbs but with a very large section and<br/>
gully, and next to a reserve. Lots and lots of trees.<br/>

&gt; It is so good to hear of other homeschoolers doing these things. We (dh<br/>
and me,<br/>
&gt; plus 4 sons aged 19, 16, 13 & 10) have just mooved to a 16 acre block of<br/>
land,<br/>
&gt; which is about 12 - 13 acres native bush (forest? woodlands? - these don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really describe it properly) with a stream running through the middle of<br/>
it. We<br/>
&gt; are living in the garage plus room that we built before we moved, and are<br/>
now<br/>
&gt; trying to build the house, but the weather has been rain, rain, rain. (It<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; winter here in New Zealand) The only animals we have so far are the 2<br/>
rabbits<br/>
&gt; and cat we brought with us, and a delightful puppy ds #3 got for his 13th<br/>
&gt; birthday 2 weeks ago. As vegetarians, we aren&#39;t planning on animals beyond<br/>
&gt; poultry for eggs, and a few goats to keep the gorse down. As Karen says,<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have much in the way of wild animals here in NZ but we are<br/>
priveleged to<br/>
&gt; have a pair of keruru or native pigeon, living in our bush. These are very<br/>
&gt; large and lovely birds, which are protected now, but are still poached by<br/>
&gt; people who find them good eating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are about to start planting trees and are looking forward to getting<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; gardens started come spring.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds really nice, we have a lot of wildflowers here, many I don&#39;t <br/>
know the names of, but I sure do know the violets that grow <br/>
everywhere.   My 4yod Stephanie loves them and tells people not <br/>
to walk on her flowers, but it&#39;s impossible to avoid them all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Human predators took our four goslings last year, we believe that it <br/>
must have been because the goslings [about 5 weeks old, so <br/>
getting fairly large] all disappeared in one night, there was no sign <br/>
of any feathers or blood and the parent birds were unharmed.  If an <br/>
animal had taken them the parents would have tried to defend them <br/>
and been injured themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you know<br/>
&gt; anything about banties?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really, we had a bantam rooster but he died of old age.   We <br/>
are breeding birds for the Hmong market so we can&#39;t have banties <br/>
unless they were kept well away from the other chickens or the <br/>
fiesty little roosters would be spreading their genetic information.<br/>
<br/>
We did have a lot of racoon trouble with all the chickens who had <br/>
leftt he coop and taken up residence in the barn being on their <br/>
menu, that was two years ago.  A new group have migrated to the <br/>
barn and we have not lost any of them, they are still around as we <br/>
see their footprints in the mud near a pond.  The one difference I <br/>
can think of it that now we have six domestic geese who patrol the <br/>
farmyard all night and maybe they scare the &#39;coons away.<br/>

so, how do they interact with the geese?<br/>

We just installed an invisible fence for our dogs, and are working on<br/>
training them.<br/>

training the dog to know where the buried wire is and avoid it.  The shock<br/>
only occurs during the training or if the dog forgets.<br/>
<br/>
Sheep and goats would need a sturdy fence!<br/>
