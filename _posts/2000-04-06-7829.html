 This is very rare.  Maybe 1-2% of women. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Don&#39;t discount those who physically can not.   I am amongst them, and it can <br/>
be a very difficult, traumatic thing.  I suffer from post traumatic stress <br/>
disorder because of the events leading me to be unable to breastfeed this <br/>
child.  It resulted in my clinical death.  I relive the horror almost nightly <br/>
in nightmares.  You can&#39;t imagine how painful it is to be sneered at and <br/>
attacked because of it.   I don&#39;t think I have ever met a more cruel, <br/>
exclusive group than dogmatic breastfeeders.  <br/>
By the way, it doesn&#39;t really matter how many women are physically unable to <br/>
breastfeed.  If you (generic you, not any one in particular) can, then that&#39;s <br/>
all you need to be concerned about.  Great! ! More power to ya, mazeltov, and <br/>
here&#39;s a big attagirl.  And if you can&#39;t, and your baby is happy and healthy <br/>
on formula then Great!  More power to ya, mazeltov, and a big attagirl to you <br/>
too.  Both of you are great moms.  Frankly, I don&#39;t need to know how you feed <br/>
your baby.  I&#39;ve got plenty of my own business to be concerned about.  <br/>

<div><font size="2">A study by the NCT, biggest childbrith and breastfeeding 
support org in Britain, found that 95% of women could lactate, for many of those 
who couldn&#39;t it was due to breast surgery.&nbsp; Some bf counsellors have 
estimated 97-98%.&nbsp; But whatever it is, it&#39;s a low percentage of the 
population, who have every right to be thankful for the hygiene standards and 
ongoing reseach to improve formula which we have in Western, &#39;First-world&#39; 
society (and in some cases, angry at the doctors who performed surgery without 
explaining this risk.)</font></div>
