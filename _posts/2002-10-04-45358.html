I realise this is not unschooling, but off course any kind of learning would be unschooling, so does anyone know about a site that have comparative education statistics of the various countries??<br/>

  My husband and I discussed the low level of literacy in various countries - UK, USA, and NZ - my theory is that children are pushed too young and become discouraged. He wants to see statistics... hehehe.<br/>
<br/>
  I realise this is not unschooling, but off course any kind of learning would be unschooling, so does anyone know about a site that have comparative education statistics of the various countries??<br/>

I don&#39;t have those, but Gatto has stated that the US had almost 100%<br/>
literacy and more books sold per capita *before* compulsory education.  I<br/>
