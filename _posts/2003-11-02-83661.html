<div id="ygrps-yiv-77363708">Hello,<br/>
I know this is off topic, but I need some<br/>
advice/support. I am the Mom of 2 teenagers, 13 and<br/>
15, girl and boy. All their lives, we have unschooled.<br/>
Whenever they were little, everything was exciting and<br/>
new and a learning experience. Now, 2 1/2 years away<br/>
from college -- which they both want to attend -- they<br/>
have lost that excitement in everything except<br/>
friends, video games, and card games. I can&#39;t seem to<br/>
kindle their fires like I used to. They both have a<br/>
Japanese tutor, and Arielle does origami with her.<br/>
Arielle goes to gymnastics, youth group, and friends&#39;<br/>
houses. Aaron has tons of friends come over to play Yu<br/>
Gi Oh and Lord of the Rings. They both read a lot and<br/>
write on IM and to pen pals. However, their written<br/>
usage, punctuation, and spelling aren&#39;t that good. If<br/>
they didn&#39;t want to go away to college, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
worry. But they do, and they need scholarships. We&#39;ve<br/>
talked about that, and I show them ACT and SAT<br/>
practice tests. They know about college requirements,<br/>
because Alvin (dad and husband) is an academic advisor<br/>
and English teacher at a university. They KNOW what<br/>
they need to know, but they aren&#39;t interested in doing<br/>
the kind of practice or &quot;school&quot; I know of to get<br/>
ready. I&#39;m scared that they won&#39;t be ready to do what<br/>
they want to do, and I don&#39;t want to force them to do<br/>
mindless practice and worksheets--even if I could<br/>
force them. Does anyone have any advice, other than<br/>
&quot;relax and don&#39;t worry&quot;? During my 10 years of<br/>
unsuccessful infertility treatment, that&#39;s what people<br/>
told me, and it didn&#39;t work. I would appreciate any<br/>
and all advice.<br/>

<br/>
Just have them take a test.  If they want to re-test for higher scores they <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;ll do really well and you will be able to relax.  Lots of kids can <br/>
test really well even though the mechanics of everyday writing might not be <br/>
that great.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need to stay on the school-age/school-year timetable if you&#39;re <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
Maybe if they take a few courses at a jr. college or community/trades school, <br/>
they&#39;ll find out whether they really like that sort of thing, and if they do <br/>
they&#39;ll be able to brush up skills for a good reason, in a real-life place.<br/>
<br/>
Your worry isn&#39;t helping them OR you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I would appreciate any<br/>
and all advice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Apparently not, because you wrote:<br/>

<br/>
Did anyone tell you &quot;Get all tense and worry&quot;?<br/>
If so, was that better advice?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Read and become informed so you can relax and not worry :-)<br/>
<br/>
I wish there were a handful of resources I could point you to, but the best<br/>
way is just to ask what other people&#39;s experiences with their teens are.<br/>
There are also archived discussions on the message board at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not unusual. The teen years tend to be for exploring relationships.<br/>
That&#39;s what their chemistry is saying what they need right now. Just as<br/>
kids&#39; chemistry often says they need to explore the exciting world around<br/>
them. It&#39;s comforting for unschoolers when that happens with younger kids<br/>
because it gives a sense of confidence that unschooled kids are effortlessly<br/>
sucking in what they&#39;d be learning in school plus much more. But it&#39;s a<br/>
false sense because unschooling works whether it they provide feedback to us<br/>
or not. (Assuming the environment is right for that child!) A kid exploring<br/>
through video games and pretend play is just as successful an unschooler as<br/>
kids who mess around with things that provide feedback that they&#39;re<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re seeing an artificial deadline and worrying because it&#39;s looming. They<br/>
don&#39;t need to go to college at 17. They can wait until they&#39;re 19 or 25.<br/>
They can take time off to explore the world before they become burdened by<br/>
responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
That will give them time to mature and play with the skills they have in an<br/>
adult arena. It will give them time to form a better idea of what they enjoy<br/>
and don&#39;t enjoy in the adult world and what directions they could head in to<br/>
support themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Preparing for college doesn&#39;t take 2 1/2 years. It takes as long as someone<br/>
wants to spend on it once they sent their mind to wanting it. The deadline<br/>
is what&#39;s scaring you. Forget the deadline. Forget the standard timeline<br/>
kids follow to get into college.<br/>
<br/>
If they see college as a goal, then they will prepare themselves when it<br/>
comes time. It may take longer than expected, but ... so what? What will be<br/>
the harm if they enter college at 18 rather than 17?<br/>
<br/>
Even better than college as a goal, is figuring out what they want to<br/>
explore in their lives. College can be a means to an end, but as a goal in<br/>
itself, it can be a rude surprise at the end when someone has subconsciously<br/>
expected college to provide a clear path beyond and it&#39;s either set someone<br/>
on the path of the rat race, or left them at the train station of life with<br/>
no choice on the destination list that seems exciting and worth pursuing.<br/>

Those sound like full and interesting lives!  What besides that do you think they should be interested in?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Although I had a few very small scholarships, I mostly paid for college with work and loans.  On a side note, I think it&#39;s silly that so much emphasis is put on parents saving for college while their kids are young.  If I want to help my kids pay for college someday, I could get a job at the same time my kids go to college.<br/>
