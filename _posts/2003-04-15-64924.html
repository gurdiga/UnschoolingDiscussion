<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049464776">When we turned out the lights last night, Lisa told me she was scared<br/>
because she had just read a story about a ghost.  We talked about ghosts,<br/>
ghost stories, why they can be scary, how some people enjoy scary stories,<br/>
are ghosts real, and more.<br/>
<br/>
When Lisa woke up, she told me that our conversation had helped, that she<br/>
didn&#39;t have any scary dreams from the ghost story.  Then she announced that<br/>
she is going to write a ghost story of her own.  She started it this<br/>
evening.<br/>

&lt;&lt; When we turned out the lights last night, Lisa told me she was scared<br/>
<br/>
because she had just read a story about a ghost.  We talked about ghosts,<br/>
<br/>
ghost stories, why they can be scary, how some people enjoy scary stories,<br/>
<br/>
are ghosts real, and more. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another good story and a coincidence.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this evening Holly asked me to tell her the story of Hamlet.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t ask why.  Maybe it&#39;s because on the Simpsons they did Hamlet <br/>
(swordfight scene) the other night.   I asked if she wanted it right then or <br/>
at bedtime.  Bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
So instead of the fairytales we&#39;ve been doing, I turned off the light and lay <br/>
down and told her Hamlet, about 20 minutes worth.  At one point when I said <br/>
Polonius didn&#39;t want Ophelia seeing Hamlet anymore, but she loved Hamlet and <br/>
didn&#39;t know why sometimes he was being nice, and sometimes mean, Holly said <br/>
&quot;This is like West Side Story, and like Romeo and Juliet.&quot;  Right near the <br/>
end she was falling asleep.  She woke up when I was getting off the bed, <br/>
though, and I told her now I would tell her the way Wendy told Peter Pan:  <br/>
The king dies, the queen dies, Ophelia dies, Laertes dies, and Hamlet dies.  <br/>
And they all lived happily ever after.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a ghost story of sorts.   <br/>
<br/>
I was still a teenager when I figured out that talking about a story before I <br/>
went to sleep kept me from the bad dreams, but if I went to sleep without <br/>
&quot;processing&quot; it verbally and mentally, it seemed destined to be a nightmare.<br/>
