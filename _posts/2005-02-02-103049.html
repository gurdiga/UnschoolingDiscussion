<div id="ygrps-yiv-149503366">I hope this isn&#39;t distressing or personal to anyone in New Jersey who might know people involved, but there was a small ground plane crash this morning, and I have comments not on that but on the article AOL has on their website.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-&#39;&#39;Usually we see them lift off, but this one just went straight and started scratching the ground. There were sparks shooting out all over the place,&#39;&#39; said Joseph Massaro, a psychologist who lives nearby.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How might it matter that he&#39;s a psychologist?<br/>
Would they have identified him as a janitor?  A waiter?  A Volvo mechanic?  A registered sex offender?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;He said as they tried to airborne before five minutes past (7 a.m.), they just lost control and they couldn&#39;t airborne the plane. They went straight through, 100 miles per hour,&#39;&#39; Sosa said.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
That second part was an account of what the pilot said.  Would a pilot really use &quot;to airborne&quot; as a verb??<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s going to irritatingly and unnatural become a verb, at least it should be &quot;to airbear.&quot;  And still, the air is doing the bearing, not the plane and certainly not the pilot, except for bearing his own hot air which won&#39;t get a plane off the ground.<br/>
<br/>
So this is the state of professional writing, and that&#39;s fine.  I&#39;ll die before long and it won&#39;t matter to me anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby showed me his essay, before he dropped the class (online, from his own bedroom, and &quot;that was too easy,&quot; he said).  <br/>
<br/>
For content, 40 points, a B.<br/>
For mechanics, an F.<br/>
<br/>
These weren&#39;t grammatical mechanics, nor what is known as &quot;the mechanics of writing&quot; (punctuation and such).  It was the spacing of paragraphs, fewer than 100 words per paragraph, and not having underlined his thesis sentence.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;You write well, but that is only half the battle. You  must follow assignment directions YOUR OUTLINE IS EXCELLENT, but your essay must match it.  And to lenghten--you need to use more specifics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So wrote the teacher who gave Kirby&#39;s first school assignment a D.  Will I survive?  Yeah, I guess. &lt;g&gt;  I was spared such trauma for thirteen years before that.  Nobody&#39;s ever given Marty or Holly a grade either.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some consolation, I suppose.  Kirby&#39;s actual writing (the words, the ideas) were B work, in her estimation.  Kirby, who had never been in an English class for a minute before two and a half weeks ago got one of four Ds.  Of those fifteen others who had been to school for years, three others also got D&#39;s.  Four poor souls got Fs.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m sorry to go on about this.  I&#39;ll recover.  I will airborne myself, perhaps. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Aargh...I hate college writing courses.  They should call <br/>
them &quot;mechanical writing&quot;...if you plug in the formula, you&#39;re <br/>
guaranteed to pass.  Unfortunately, &quot;success&quot; in other college <br/>
subjects that require essays rely on knowing that formula.  I&#39;m glad <br/>
I don&#39;t have to think about that now, we&#39;re about 6 years away from <br/>
worrying about college.<br/>
<br/>
This post really touched me though because it reminded me <br/>
of &quot;seahorses&quot; or why we started homeschooling ALL of our children.  <br/>
I don&#39;t post much, I just wanted to share this for some reason so I <br/>
hope you&#39;ll bear with me!!<br/>
<br/>
When we started homeschooling (mind you, before our transition to <br/>
the unschooling lifestyle), we started out hsing our eldest dd, then <br/>
in 5th grade and bored out of her mind (and sick of the BS).  We <br/>
didn&#39;t plan on taking our 3rd grade dd out...she was happy and doing <br/>
well (6yods was at home already).  But slowly she, too, became <br/>
interested in hsing, but I put her off because I felt she was <br/>
a &quot;better fit&quot; for school.  Again, this was in the beginning of our <br/>
hsing journey, before all the little epiphanies about education, <br/>
lifestyle, etc. started happening.<br/>
<br/>
What changed my mind about hsing all my kids was the <br/>
infamous &quot;SEAHORSE&quot; report.<br/>
<br/>
Jessica is so bright and inquisitive (and from a former schoolish <br/>
point of view, she was considered an A+advanced learner), but she is <br/>
a messy writer, specifically in cursive.  Always has been and <br/>
probably always will be!  Not illegible by any means, just not <br/>
pretty!  She prints GREAT, but cursive becomes mandatory for use in <br/>
reports in 3rd grade.  Her teacher handed out an assignment where <br/>
they had to choose an animal of the ocean, write a pretty detailed <br/>
report, including illustrations, photos, etc. and assemble it like a <br/>
book.  In cursive.  Jess was so psyched because she loves <br/>
seahorses...and likes drawing and creating books...a perfect <br/>
assignment for her...she started going to the library and putting <br/>
this report together a month before it was due.  She read books, <br/>
visited websites and wrote a good report that we wrote and rewrote <br/>
together (for neatness and spelling as required) several times.  <br/>
Quite frankly, her zest for it was starting to drive me a little <br/>
crazy (but in a good way!).  She was really proud of the report and <br/>
had a lot of fun doing it!<br/>
<br/>
When the report was graded, she received a C-. Pretty bad for her in <br/>
general..she was an A student (although the ramifications of that <br/>
grade were on a much more personal level).  The teacher told me in a <br/>
note that although it was A+ work, Jessica&#39;s handwriting was so <br/>
messy that it took away from the overall &quot;value&quot; of the report.  <br/>
Mind you, it wasn&#39;t unreadable (and her illustrations, etc. were <br/>
great), teacher just felt that a third grader should have better <br/>
technical penmanship skills.<br/>
<br/>
I was SO pissed, told the teacher that it was a shame that at the <br/>
3RD GRADE LEVEL that form was valued so much over content.  She <br/>
agreed, but said that was the way it is!  Jessica needed to write in <br/>
cursive and write well at that. AS IF CURSIVE HAS ANYTHING TO DO <br/>
WITH WRITING.  But she made it pretty clear that it would affect her <br/>
success as a student from that point on, her &quot;unpretty&quot; cursive.  <br/>
And I believe that to be partly true.  At home I tried to downplay <br/>
it...tell Jessica that I didn&#39;t care about the grade, I was happy <br/>
she enjoyed seahorses and thanked her for all she taught me about <br/>
them.  And I meant it...I was really upset...not about the grade but <br/>
about the fact that the teacher put so little value in the learning <br/>
that took place (and the love of the learning).  She placed more <br/>
value in penmanship.<br/>
<br/>
But my daughter was still so upset about the grade.  She didn&#39;t see <br/>
it as the report being graded, she saw it as HER being graded.  I <br/>
really saw a change in her and how she felt about learning on that <br/>
day, in that moment that she received a C-.  It&#39;s funny how one <br/>
significant moment kind of stands out like that.  I swear I saw my <br/>
dd lose something very important, some part of her innocence maybe, <br/>
something intangible.  Maybe I&#39;m overreacting, but at the least I <br/>
believed that I couldn&#39;t hope that she enjoy learning and continue <br/>
down a path that doesn&#39;t really value the joy of learning.  I just <br/>
couldn&#39;t see how I could do both...encourage her joy and also force <br/>
her to be successful by the schools limiting standards.  I knew I&#39;d <br/>
have to compromise something. And it felt hypocritical to say that <br/>
the grade doesn&#39;t matter but then send her back to be graded some <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
So Jess came home the next week.  Eventually we all started to <br/>
believe in and embrace the unschooling lifestyle (which basically <br/>
reflected every other part of our life outside of school).  There <br/>
are books and games and movies and crafts everywhere.  Literally, <br/>
there&#39;s sh*t everywhere!!!:))  It&#39;s complete creative chaos all the <br/>
time.  My oldest dd finds more relevance in Green Day&#39;s &quot;American <br/>
Idiot&quot; than she does in a social studies text book, my youngest dd <br/>
is constantly cutting up old clothes and making new designs, and my <br/>
son (6) is obsessed with Xbox, skateboarding and his electric guitar.<br/>
<br/>
I was going through a box of &quot;memories&quot; the other day, including <br/>
many old school projects and papers, and I realized that I was <br/>
really selling my kids short before..entrusting them to <br/>
school...they are so much more interesting and intelligent and <br/>
creative than to be represented by a bunch of xeroxed worksheets <br/>
with A+ stickers on them.  They were so limited before, to learning <br/>
what was necessary and appropriate.  Now they learn everything, all <br/>
the time, even when we don&#39;t seem to be doing anything at all.  It&#39;s <br/>
pretty cool, when you sit back and think about it.  I thought about <br/>
throwing that box of school stuff out, as some sort of a symbolic <br/>
gesture:), but I can&#39;t...partly because I&#39;m not into symbolic <br/>
gestures...but mainly because I can see my kids grubby little paw <br/>
prints on some things..and there were some moments of genuine <br/>
happiness in creating or achieving (however misguided) these little <br/>
items they handed to me with such a happy shiny look on their faces, <br/>
mostly from the younger years when school was still a little fun.  <br/>
Before they had to grow up and get serious in 3rd grade or so!  But <br/>
now a lot of our memories are living memories, not based <br/>
on &quot;accomplishment&quot;, which is a really wonderful thing and doesn&#39;t <br/>
require a storage space.<br/>
<br/>
Thank G-d for Seahorses!  They changed our life for the better!<br/>

If a child is in school with the mom saying &quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t&quot; or &quot;you <br/>
don&#39;t have to do this,&quot; I think (I hope) the grades have less power to wound <br/>

have no choice.&quot;<br/>
