<div id="ygrps-yiv-465134435">Anyone unschooling in Florida? I would also love to hear a little about<br/>
how you all achieve an unschooling lifestyle. I love the idea of letting<br/>
the kids create their own learning agenda. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Anyone unschooling in Florida?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m in Fla (Martin County) and I&#39;m on this list because I love a lot of <br/>
the ideas here but . . . I&#39;m not sure we are officially unschooling (or is <br/>
that an oxymoron?).  We don&#39;t follow a curriculum but we do cover some of the <br/>
academics in a sort of orderly way.  We do what works for us.  We create our <br/>
agenda by waking up.  Sometimes we have planned activities -- today we are <br/>
going to meet Dad for lunch at a wildlife sanctuary and take the tour there <br/>
and picnic.  Other days we have lessons -- piano and Tae Kwon Do so far.  <br/>
Other days we spend way too much time on the computer.   My son is taking an <br/>
online math course, for instance.  And both kids do lots of different <br/>
software programs depending on what catches their fancy.  We visit the <br/>
library about once a week.  Except 2 weeks ago they had a library sale and we <br/>
still haven&#39;t plowed thru the stack of books we got there.  My kids are young <br/>
(5 and 6 1/2) so we do a lot of running around in the yard, going to the <br/>
park, etc.  My daughter is in to art in an extreme way -- we are amazed at <br/>
some of her creations and the way she can see what she wants to create <br/>
beforehand and then actually produce it -- I, otoh, cannot draw a straight <br/>
line.  On the other, other hand, she was asking me to write out some math <br/>
problems (we did a maze with add/subtract problems thruout) on her art easel <br/>
last nite (and I was lectured because &quot;Mom, I am 5 now, not 4 1/2 -- you <br/>
think of me as 4/12 and give me baby problems -- try to imagine what it is <br/>
like to be 5.&quot;) -- so who knows what she will be doing next!  We get science <br/>
experiments on-line once a week (and usually do them), we go to the zoo, we <br/>
just took a nice vacation to PA/NY/NJ (leaves!!! deer!!!), etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s a little of what we do.  <br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
