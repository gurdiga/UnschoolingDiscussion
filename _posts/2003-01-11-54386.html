<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117055184">So what are you all doing about this?<br/>
<br/>
Curfews?<br/>
<br/>
Do you advocate waitng until marriage for a sexual relationship <br/>
or no? <br/>
<br/>
Is dating something that is determined by the girl or boy&#39;s <br/>
desires rather than a predetermined age of elligibility?<br/>
<br/>
What about driving in cars with other teens?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious how everyone thinks about morality, imparting <br/>
values, setting boundaries related to safety and so on. I was <br/>
raised without any structure, boundaries or moral compass. I <br/>
fully expected to live with a boyfriend before marriage, thought <br/>
having sex would be a normal part of a relationship and ended <br/>
up not ever having sex until I was married (at 22).<br/>
<br/>
As a conservative Christian, there is a lot of fear associated with <br/>
kids making a mistake--either through dating or sexual contact. I <br/>
want to avoid being either too strict and imposing while so lax <br/>
that my kids haven&#39;t got anything to bump up against to fo9rm <br/>
their values. They do look to us to guide them.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see the point in a curfew.  I will expect to have a general <br/>
idea of where they are, so that my own mind is at ease.  But then <br/>
again, I always let dh know where I am and he lets me know.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you advocate waitng until marriage for a sexual relationship <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  Absolutely.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is dating something that is determined by the girl or boy&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dating should be determined by the girl or boy&#39;s desire for <br/>
marriage.  I think that our society&#39;s way of saying that the magical <br/>
age of 18 is when they&#39;re ready to be adults is silly.  I have no <br/>
problem with young marriage, old marriage, or no marriage at all.  <br/>
Just so the sex happens after the marriage.  And I don&#39;t need the <br/>
marriage to be legal, as long as it is before God and is a lifelong <br/>
commitment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What about driving in cars with other teens?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m ok with that.  Of course I would hope that my kids wouldn&#39;t feel <br/>
safe being with someone who drives drunk or drives unsafely. <br/>
Hopefully they&#39;re not so needy that they need to be with kids acting <br/>
unsafely in order to feel popular. <br/>

should treat our children respectfully.  Yes, they have a sin nature <br/>
but so do I, and I don&#39;t have any human restricting me and punishing <br/>
me if I come in too late or make a wrong choice. I think we should <br/>
hold our children accountable in the same way we would hold a brother <br/>
or sister accountable, but then again they should us accountable too. <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Curfews? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our kids let us know where they&#39;ll be and overnight stuff is on a <br/>
case-by-case basis.<br/>
Everything&#39;s on a case-by-case basis.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby, at 16, is out quite a bit, but he has friends over here a lot too, <br/>
sometimes overnight, usually other male gamer-guys.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you advocate waitng until marriage for a sexual relationship or no? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Neither way has been &quot;advocated.&quot;  We&#39;ve talked about sexuality, <br/>
responsibility, pregnancy, disease, and there&#39;s never been a time in all <br/>
their lives when we haven&#39;t modelled and advised consideration for other&#39;s <br/>
needs and feelings.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is dating something that is determined by the girl or boy&#39;s <br/>
desires rather than a predetermined age of elligibility?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The two words that don&#39;t fit with the way we&#39;ve thought and dealt with this <br/>
are &quot;dating&quot; and &quot;desires.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Our kids socialize in groups.  Sometimes within those groups a girl and boy <br/>
have special feelings for a while.  Sometimes it will split or affect a <br/>
group, sometimes not.   They go to movies and they go to anime club and <br/>
gaming nights, but not as couple, not as &quot;dates.&quot;  Kirby has done some things <br/>
with just one other person and it was a female.  Sometimes it has been his <br/>
girlfriend.  He&#39;s had four girlfriends over the past three years.  None at <br/>
the moment, but he is friendly with three of those four and two he&#39;s lost <br/>
track of.   One hardly counts.  He met her with groups to hang out at the <br/>
mall a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
He has yet to be independently driving and invite a girl he hardly knows to <br/>
do a formal date.  I kinda doubt it will ever happen that way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What about driving in cars with other teens?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He has several friends who can drive.  Most ohey&#39;re going to go and they <br/>
park.  We let the kids go.  The law in New Mexico limits new drivers to one <br/>
person under 18 who&#39;s not a member of their family.  So usually if one of our <br/>
kids is with another driver it&#39;s only one of them at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
The places they go the most are one mile from here, the gaming shop and their <br/>
friend Eric&#39;s house, so it&#39;s not much of a problem anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As a conservative Christian, there is a lot of fear associated with <br/>
kids making a mistake--either through dating or sexual contact. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of fear about EVERYTHING for conservative Christians. <br/>
The Baptists I grew up among (and my relatives who are still Baptist) are <br/>
uptight for the godly joy of being uptight, it seems.  And are their kids <br/>
nicer, better, more honest, kinder and more innocent?  Nope.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I was raised without any structure, boundaries or moral compass. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids are being raised with what SEEMS probably to others not to be <br/>
structure or boundaries, but we talk daily about how they and their friends <br/>
are getting along, whether they&#39;ve remembered to do this or that regarding <br/>
some social obligation, and every situation (Marty&#39;s upcoming birthday party) <br/>
is planned with consideration for each person involved or affected.  That&#39;s a <br/>
heck of a moral compass.    Works better than a list of &quot;simple&quot; (arbitrary) <br/>
rules with times and ages and years and hours.  Each decision they make is <br/>
made in light of real considerations, and they know they&#39;ll end up discussing <br/>
it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids are trusted and respected by adults in all directions.  They impress <br/>
me sometimes.  I&#39;m surprised at their level of responsibility and <br/>
thoughtfulness.  Sometimes I expect them to be irresponsible and &quot;just kids,&quot; <br/>
but they&#39;re better kids than I was.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby had a dentist&#39;s appointment Friday morning and had to work Friday <br/>
afternoon.  His schedule was greatly increased because his boss&#39;s dad had a <br/>
stroke in another city.   He wanted to spend the night with friends, but I <br/>
needed to make sure he got to the dentist.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out his friends live a block from the dentist.  He talked with his dad <br/>
and me about it, he put his karate gi in the laundry and went to the friends&#39; <br/>
house, where they made sure he had an alarm set, he walked himself to the <br/>
dentist, and had arranged for a ride to work.  He came home late last night, <br/>
got up this morning and got himself ready for work... not a think I had to do <br/>
to help him for a day and a half.  And he was cheerful and nice to his little <br/>
brother and sister.  <br/>
<br/>
If we had made rules about when he had to be home and said &quot;No, you can&#39;t go <br/>
and visit your friend because you have to go to the dentist tomorrow&quot; or if <br/>
we had bugged him about whether he had set his alarm, or whatever all, he <br/>
might be harboring some resentment (to say the least).  And if we didn&#39;t give <br/>
him a chance to show us that he COULD pull off a two-day schedule that <br/>
complex, we wouldn&#39;t have the opportunity to have as much faith in him as we <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
It all developed gradually.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids aren&#39;t yet teens but when they do wish to go out I won&#39;t impose a curfew. I believe it shows a lack of respect for the young person involved. I also think that it doesn&#39;t work short of locking<br/>
them in their room. I used to climb out of the window after my mother thought I was in bed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; or no?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. That would be hypocritical. I lived with my husband for years before we got married and we actually got married for tax reasons, not because we think a Govt piece of paper is important. A<br/>
partnership can be loving and sexual without Govt sanction. I also don&#39;t see any problem with exploring sexuality when the young person is ready. It&#39;s their body, not mine.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Age really means nothing. Some poeple are mature at 13, others at 78. Dating should be up to the person who wishes to do the dating.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What about driving in cars with other teens?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a tricky problem in the UK as very few teens have cars. In fact, I can&#39;t think of anyone I know under 20 who has a car back home. Back home we don&#39;t drive until 17 at the earliest.<br/>

Quite often this may be similar to the parentbut not always.<br/>

her if that was required.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting questions Julie. Basically, while I share my values and recount my experiences with my children they are seperate human beings and are free to make their own decisions. I feel I will always<br/>
support and love them whatever those decisions are, even if it isn&#39;t something I would have done myself. I&#39;m not them. Therefore I will never feel disappointed or disapproving of anything they did.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;So what are you all doing about this?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Curfews?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My oldest, Tara, has always been a school child but when I realized we were <br/>
unschoolers, she was met with the same attitude that we had with the younger <br/>
3. So even though school is a choice for her, we have an unschooling <br/>
attitude with her if you will. She doesn&#39;t have a curfew. She use to but <br/>
with the help of this list, Sandra especially, I saw that I needed to let go <br/>
of that too. It was probably the last thing I held onto with her not <br/>
realizing it didn&#39;t go along with everything else I believed. She actually <br/>
does better now with not having one then when she did!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you advocate waitng until marriage for a sexual relationship<br/>
or no?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We really don&#39;t advocate anything. Tara was talked to about everything we <br/>
believed in regard to sexuality and even things we didn&#39;t believe. Basically <br/>
provided with all the info she needed to make her own choices. She was <br/>
active sexually before I wish she would have been. She also believes the <br/>
same thing now but has learned from her own trial and error. She too wishes <br/>
she would have waited but she didn&#39;t and luckily there has been no major <br/>
harm done. She is active now with her boyfriend. She is on birth control and <br/>
also uses protection with that. Do I wish she wasn&#39;t at this age? Sure. But <br/>
she does and she is smart about doing it and also wise beyond her years <br/>
because of the early choices she made. It would be silly of me to think that <br/>
after starting at an early age, she would not have sex now with a great kid <br/>
she loves and who loves her back. I&#39;m okay with her decision, more so than <br/>
my husband but he works through it!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is dating something that is determined by the girl or boy&#39;s<br/>
desires rather than a predetermined age of elligibility?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dating is a term the kids don&#39;t use around here. With Tara it was never a <br/>
certain age. She started hanging out in groups at around 12 or 13. Just <br/>
being dropped off at movies and picked up right after or with a group at a <br/>
friends house with a parent home. Both sexes were involved. No one really <br/>
had a boyfriend/girlfriend although there were whispers of who liked who. <br/>
Even now, a boy and girl can go out for months and unless the boy actually <br/>
asks the girl to be his girlfriend, they aren&#39;t boyfriend/girlfriend. Go <br/>
figure. That&#39;s how it works here. Tara has had 4 boy friends now and she&#39;s <br/>
17. She hasn&#39;t had sex with them all either in case you&#39;re wondering!! I <br/>
think the first time she actually went out with a boy alone was when she was <br/>
15. Again, they met at the movies. This past 6 months with her boyfriend now <br/>
is the first time she actually has gotten picked up and they go out alone to <br/>
the beach, dinner, movie, concerts, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;What about driving in cars with other teens?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tara started going out with a kid she was seeing when she was almost 16 and <br/>
he was 17. Again it was in a group in the car in her cousins neighborhood. I <br/>
knew them all and where they were. Now I have no problem as she only goes <br/>
with kids she feels comfortable with. She has actually told me certain <br/>
people she won&#39;t get in a car with. I would say now she drives with only two <br/>
people. Her boyfriend and her best girlfriend. She gets her own license next <br/>
month. She has also promised she would call if she ever felt unsure about <br/>
driving with someone. I trust her instincts and also her boyfriend. He&#39;s not <br/>
a party guy and always safe from what I have seen. And I have seen when he <br/>
hasn&#39;t realized it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I trust my daughter judgements, not to say I don&#39;t realize she will still <br/>
make mistakes. I figure she will live with someone before she marries. I&#39;m <br/>
fine with that. I know she has already had sex and now I&#39;m fine with that <br/>
too. (I was a basket case) I&#39;m hoping her marriage will be forever although <br/>
I&#39;m realistic and she is gun shy about it all. She has seen her own parents <br/>
divorce and various aunts and uncles she never thought it would happen to. <br/>
She wants children although she swears it won&#39;t be until her late 20&#39;s. <br/>
She&#39;s seen me raise her younger 3 siblings and knows what it takes!!! We <br/>
have always spoken to her about what we believe and also given her the facts <br/>
about it all. I have never said what I wanted her to do or not to do. Tara <br/>
will be the first one to say that she listens to it all and then makes her <br/>
own decisions and learns from her own mistakes. She&#39;s a great kid. A really <br/>
great kid!!<br/>

<br/>
FWIW, I fiid we deal with this as  we have dealt with everything else - talking, reading, talking, reading, treating each child and situation individually....Oldest son ( 22) is single and  is studying/working/living at home. He  has talked about his relatiosnhips and friendships with young women with dh and I - we have talked about our experiences and our values and thoughts.  He, and the next two down ( 18, 20) make their own decisions about these issues ( as we do with the 13 yo, but he is not that interested) - but the boys, so far,  usually end up talking about the issue with me or dh.  They are happy wiht this atm....We are a talking family, though!...Leonie W.<br/>

<br/>
Yes! - over time and experience. Things happen. We talk...Like when we read David Copperfield and laughed at his romantic escapades -  choosing a marraige partner soley on looks. Lot of discussion here... Or when we watched Pride and Prejudice and discussed  Mrs Bennett and her attitude to marriage/relationships ( money!)..Or   like when we watched  Good Will Hunting - we talked about the relaitonship betwen Matt Damon&#39;s charcater and the English girl...As Sandra said, it happens gradually...My older three all got their licenses and cars as soon as they were legal. Some other people in our church restricted their teens to  a set  ( older) age. Yet, these teens are the ones with more obvious rebellion issues and who are  either not really on good terms with their parents or are very dependant on their aprents and dont seem to develop ideas and fríends of their own...Leonie W. <br/>

<br/>
I am SO relieved each time it&#39;s confirmed that she&#39;s still doing well!<br/>
Because my test cases are boys, and I know the fears with the differences.  <br/>
My daughter is still really little (NOT--she&#39;s eleven, and will be up and <br/>
somewhat out before the boys have moved away).<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly true of my sons&#39; friends, too:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Dating is a term the kids don&#39;t use around here. With Tara it was never a <br/>

asks the girl to be his girlfriend, they aren&#39;t boyfriend/girlfriend. Go <br/>
figure. That&#39;s how it works here. -=-<br/>
<br/>
From experience growing up (and my sometimes irritatingly clear memory of <br/>
emotional moments), it seemed the stricter the parents were and the more <br/>
ominous weight and power given to -*DATING*- the less casual the kids were <br/>
able to be when they did -*DATE*- and so I&#39;m thrilled at the non-existence of <br/>
the term and concept in my kids&#39; lives so far.  <br/>
<br/>
They will sometimes refer to older couples as &quot;going out,&quot; but they seem to <br/>
mean hanging  out especially much, going to eat together a lot, likely to <br/>
know where the other is.   Even those couples who seem established haven&#39;t <br/>
seemed to have &quot;dated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s &quot;just semantics,&quot; but I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
This list is eerie lately, because people keep asking here what Holly lately <br/>
asked or discussed with  me, but...  Friday we were going to pick up a <br/>
repaired videotape, and for no known reason Holly asked how long Keith and I <br/>
dated before we were together.   I had to think hard.  And the story was <br/>
strange but I had never looked back from such a distance at it.  He took me <br/>
to dinner once, having to borrow money to do it, while I was still married to <br/>
my first husband.  So it wasn&#39;t &quot;a date,&quot; it was going to dinner while I was <br/>
in another city.    And he lived in the same house with me and my husband for <br/>
months before we were romantically involved, let alone physically.   So we <br/>
lived together before we &quot;dated&quot; was kind of the answer, only we never really <br/>
&quot;dated&quot; and we weren&#39;t &quot;living together&quot; in the being-a-couple way.<br/>
<br/>
With parental background like THAT...  sheesh!!<br/>
It does allow for a range far beyond the dating rules of my teen years, which <br/>
were this:<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re fifteen you can date (meaning in a car with one male human)<br/>
He must come to the door and chat with parents<br/>
They must know where we will be<br/>
Dating limited to Friday, Saturday and Wednesday.  <br/>
Wednesday be back before 10:00<br/>
Friday and Saturday midnight unless prior special arrangement of 1:00<br/>
<br/>
That was it.  Very simple.  Very arbitrary.  <br/>
<br/>
It was designed to give me time to do homework and such.  So I wouldn&#39;t go <br/>
wild.<br/>
<br/>
It lasted two years, I left for college right after turning 17, and all rules <br/>
were off.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby will be 17 this summer.  He hasn&#39;t done as much stuff as I had done <br/>
physically (I was a virgin, he is too, but I had done some drive-in movie <br/>
time, and he hasn&#39;t).  He&#39;s done more socially, and mostly in groups of three <br/>
or more.  He&#39;s more mature than I was.  I&#39;m not worried about him.  But I <br/>
didn&#39;t want there to be any all of a sudden releases of limitations or <br/>
pressures.  So fifteen was no milestone, and seventeen was no milestone and <br/>
if he goes away to college, or leaves to live elsewhere I don&#39;t expect he <br/>
will act radically different.<br/>

&lt;&lt; .My older three all got their licenses and cars as soon as they were <br/>
legal. Some other people in our church restricted their teens to  a set  ( <br/>
older) age. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just on the side...<br/>
<br/>
First Kirby avoided driver&#39;s ed one season because he was afraid his <br/>
handwriting couldn&#39;t keep up with taking notes.  Then he was committed to two <br/>
afternoons a week, and driver&#39;s ed around here is M-Th afernoons after school <br/>
hours.   He kept saying &quot;wait.&quot;   When he said &quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; after over a year <br/>
of being old enough, I broke my leg.  I failed to get him enrolled in the <br/>
winter session (daytime classes during Christmas break).  I&#39;ll try again for <br/>
Spring,  unless he gets anxious enough to want to take two weeks off karate <br/>
and work (part of working hours).  He isn&#39;t anxious though.  He&#39;s so busy <br/>
every day anyway, and has friends to drive him, that the expense and <br/>
responsibility aren&#39;t high on his list of desires.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if we were rich and he was going to get to drive a cool car of his own <br/>
he&#39;d be more impatient to do it.  <br/>
<br/>
So he&#39;ll be 17 before he&#39;s driving independently on his own, but it&#39;s not <br/>
because we set that limitation.  It&#39;s just kind of naturally evolved.<br/>

<br/>
Two (2) days ago, in the kitchen, Holly asked me if I had ever been in jail.  <br/>
No, I haven&#39;t.  I did bail someone out once.<br/>
<br/>
She asked if I had ever done anything illegal.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t tell her EVERYTHING I ever did that was illegal.  I told her an <br/>
assortment of five or six things, and when it seemed to have satisfied her <br/>
curiosity, I said &quot;some stuff like that.&quot;<br/>

If my kids asked a flatly straight question I would answer, but if they&#39;re <br/>
vague, I might be vague, if it doesn&#39;t seem I&#39;m cheating them out of <br/>
something they really need to know.<br/>

very young and some aren&#39;t ready until they&#39;re a lot older.  In the <br/>

50.  <br/>

baby at 21, then another at 25 and another at 27.  I&#39;m 30 now, <br/>
struggling with secondary infertility, and my only regret is that I <br/>
listened to people who told me that I *had to* go on birth control <br/>
when I was 18 just because I was young. Or that I couldn&#39;t get <br/>
married and have a baby when I was 16.   That was when my fertility <br/>
was probably at it&#39;s highest, and I might have one more child today <br/>
if I hadn&#39;t listened to all those *have to&#39;s* trying to fit me into <br/>
society&#39;s mold. <br/>

The law that says that 18 is a magical number when kids are all of a <br/>

Well, the legal age thing is because I don&#39;t want to be responsible for their mistakes.  It&#39;s a hold out from my childhood.  I advocate it because it&#39;s what I wish for my own peace of mind.  That&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
I, of course, can advocate all I want, but I can&#39;t stop them from having sex if they really want to do that.  They know this.  So I ask them to wait, hoping they will, knowing that if they don&#39;t I probably won&#39;t even know about it.  So far I have&#39;t known about any of their adult dalliances, either!  (My son and his now-fiance have been sleeping together when they&#39;re here for the last 2 years, at least.  I&#39;m not stupid.  lol.)<br/>
<br/>
I ask them (and they are free not to comply) to wait until the girl is of legal age, too, so they won&#39;t get into any kind of legal trouble.  Jon told me his girlfriend was going to be 18 this month.  She told me she was just going to be 17!  He doesn&#39;t pay much attention to facts like that.  What if she was just about to be 16??  As an 18 yo, that might get him in a lot of trouble.  (It&#39;s moot now, since she broke up with him last night!)<br/>
<br/>
I asked Jon not to get any tattoos or piercings until he was 18, either.  I did because I didn&#39;t want him to come to me and say, &quot;Why did you let me do this????&quot;  It&#39;s purely for selfish reasons that I ask for these things.  Because he loves me, he saw my reasoning and didn&#39;t do it.  He was tempted.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the only reason he didn&#39;t, but it&#39;s a factor, and that&#39;s all I can ever hope to be for them.  A factor in their decisions.  <br/>

I have done pretty much as you have. Giving them some information, but not <br/>
every gory detail. They know about my alcohol and drug abuse, but not the <br/>
particulars, just that it was all before they weree born. my oldest has <br/>
asked &quot;is my life now like yours was at this age too&quot;, which could not be <br/>
further from even a possibility, so I think I laughed and said &quot;NOT&quot;!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Robyn, it&#39;s a tough one isn&#39;t it?? For me, I think it&#39;s still &quot;old school&quot; <br/>
thinking that makes me uneasy when Tara asks me something about what I use <br/>
to do. It&#39;s the &quot;if I tell her I did stuff she&#39;ll think it&#39;s okay for her to <br/>
do it&quot; thing. And I really know better now after giving in to all the <br/>
trappings of old thinking. Allowing Tara to do as she pleases has proven to <br/>
me she has good sense. She has made mistakes I haven&#39;t, made some I did and <br/>
has done other things I wish I would have. My husband has always been up <br/>
front with her about his younger years. She knows how crappy he did in <br/>
school, what a burnout he was, all the drugs and drinking he did. She&#39;s seen <br/>
him clean and sober for over 11 years now. She&#39;s never thrown any of that <br/>
back on him at all. So I guess I&#39;m still stuck with some old trappings. <br/>
Every little time she&#39;ll ask, &quot;So mom, did you ever do that?&quot; I get all <br/>
crazy inside and wonder what the hell to say.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting better though. I&#39;m learning too!!!<br/>
