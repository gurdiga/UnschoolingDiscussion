<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106184582">That movie scared the crap out of me!!!  The whole time I kept saying &quot;don&#39;t<br/>
go in the corn!!! Burn the corn down!!!  Good things NEVER happen in corn in<br/>
movies!!!&quot;  :)  And I assured my husband that we would never, as long as I<br/>
am breathing, ever have corn fields.  They&#39;re just creepy!!!  Even without<br/>
aliens in them!!!<br/>
  I liked that movie though.  Loved Mel.  MMmmmmm  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Dylan was watching &quot;Signs&quot; tonight and if you&#39;ve seen it you know how<br/>
&gt; funny it is.<br/>
&gt; So, they find the crop circles and he&#39;s fine. And they see someone<br/>
&gt; hanging around the house at night and he&#39;s fine.   Then the news<br/>
&gt; broadcast  says that it&#39;s aliens... things are spooky and Dylan is<br/>
&gt; talking to the TV,  &quot;CUT THE CORN! &quot;   &quot;CUT THE CORN&quot;    Mel Gibson KNOWS<br/>
&gt; there are aliens in his field and Dylan says &quot;GET ON THE COMBINE AND CUT<br/>
&gt; THE CORN.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wouldn&#39;t have been much of a story I guess if they&#39;d just cut the corn.<br/>

Wasn&#39;t Field of Dreams an okay corn movie?<br/>
No, maybe not...<br/>
<br/>
Lord of the Rings!  No, scared the crap out of hobbits.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But corn is good. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We had corn fields sometimes when I was a kid  Never over 1/4 an acre, but it <br/>
can be creepy even in a small cornfield, when it&#39;s getting dry and makes <br/>
scary bug-noises everywhere if the wind moves.  And sometimes corn even has <br/>
scary bugs!  (Worms, not bugs, but still...)<br/>
