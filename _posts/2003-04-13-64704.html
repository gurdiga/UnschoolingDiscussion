What parents think about a situation matters, of course. If my kids <br/>

Jesus  - I would help them make it work as best i could.  That doesn&#39;t <br/>

up, at first, as an example of a Christian group that was very open to <br/>
and comfortable for nonChristians - and was questioned about what that <br/>
meant. As we&#39;ve discovered, it means they are fine with nonChristians <br/>
as long as the nonChristians are okay with being part of prayer circles <br/>
and giving up goals for Jesus. Sandra and I both said that wouldn&#39;t <br/>
feel welcoming to us and we wouldn&#39;t want our kids involved. It IS, <br/>
however, more inclusive than requiring a statement of faith and less <br/>
inclusive than, say, an Interfaith sports league which is less <br/>
inclusive than a sports league that is just SPORTS and doesn&#39;t involve <br/>
religion at all. This was all a perfectly civil discussion and I think <br/>
Mary answered the questions really nicely and we all learned something. <br/>
Some people may not have thought about that in some areas kids who <br/>
homeschool, but are not Christians, get left out of things or don&#39;t <br/>
feel welcome - sometimes things that it doesn&#39;t seem there is any <br/>
reason to have religion involved, like sports or homeschool ice skating <br/>
or homeschool 4H clubs. It is good if more people are a little more <br/>
aware of that.<br/>

don&#39;t find it very welcoming, though, to show up for, say, a dance <br/>
lesson and then be treated to an hour of nonstop Christian-only music. <br/>
We go to things at people&#39;s churches frequently. Sometimes we go to <br/>
Christmas Eve or Easter services at other people&#39;s churches. We are <br/>
guests there and we enjoy it very much. That is different than being a <br/>
&quot;member&quot; of an organization that is Christian, though. It is also <br/>
different than being exposed on a regular basis to child evangelism. If <br/>
my kids NOW wanted to go, of course - they are 12, 15, and 18 - I&#39;d be <br/>
curious about what they thought and we&#39;d talk about it, I&#39;m sure, <br/>
because they would want to. But &quot;let them?&quot; of course. I took mine out <br/>
of something that became very obviously intended as a vehicle to <br/>
pressure them to become Christian, when the older two were 2 and 5 <br/>
years old. It had begun to seem very sneaky to me and it wasn&#39;t like <br/>
they couldn&#39;t have dance lessons somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
We were at a family get-together once - my sister&#39;s in-law family - and <br/>
they all stood in a big circle - maybe 50 of us - and went around the <br/>
circle praying to Jesus, one after the other. It came to one of my <br/>
little kids - maybe 8 years old - who promptly recited a little Baha&#39;i <br/>
verse; &quot;Oh God, Guide me. Protect me. Illumine the lamp of my heart and <br/>
make me a brilliant star.&quot; That was it - a sweet little few lines. They <br/>
were scandalized - horrified.<br/>

Would you let your kids go just ANYWHERE they wanted to go?  Skinhead rally?  <br/>

first, and darned if they don&#39;t care about my opinion.<br/>

If my kids wanted to go, absolutely yes.  Holly likes to go to church.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t believe in God, having asked questions of several people and not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898433500">From: &quot;Pamela Sorooshian&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pamsoroosh@...">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If my kids wanted sports enough to put up with the praying and giving up<br/>
goals for<br/>
Jesus  - I would help them make it work as best i could.  That doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean I&#39;d WANT my kids in that situation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I first heard about it, (the sports camp) I was thinking I wasn&#39;t sure<br/>
either. Joe and I had been to a Christian Homeschoolers Parent support group<br/>
and got a real bad taste in our mouth. No we didn&#39;t feel comfortable or<br/>
welcomed their at all. It was just like being in church and nothing like<br/>
homeschooling. Actually it was like school in church!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So I figured it was at least worth the orientation day as most from my local<br/>
support group raved about the coach. (not all christians either) Well after<br/>
one short hour of being there and seeing my kids so unconcerned about where<br/>
I was and having so much fun, I figured why not. It was pay as you can, come<br/>
when you want stop when you want. So I went from being not sure to how can I<br/>
possibly say no to this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; People were VERY careful not to criticize Mary&#39;s choice. Mary held it<br/>
 up, at first, as an example of a Christian group that was very open to<br/>
 and comfortable for nonChristians - and was questioned about what that<br/>
 meant.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually I first spoke about it when the subject of Christian Homeschoolers<br/>
being all spanking no respecting children came up. I was saying how this<br/>
group which calls themselves Christian Homeschoolers isn&#39;t like that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sandra and I both said that wouldn&#39;t<br/>
 feel welcoming to us and we wouldn&#39;t want our kids involved. It IS,<br/>
 however, more inclusive than requiring a statement of faith and less<br/>
 inclusive than, say, an Interfaith sports league which is less<br/>
 inclusive than a sports league that is just SPORTS and doesn&#39;t involve<br/>
 religion at all.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess if I looked at it from a religious point of view only, I could see<br/>
where it wouldn&#39;t be welcoming. But I looked at it from my children&#39;s point<br/>
of view. Joseph has since joining come to terms with his need to win<br/>
attitude and Sierra has managed nicely around a group of kids her own age.<br/>
(she was very shy and he was extremely competitive) Both helpful things for<br/>
them both. But mostly, it&#39;s just fun for them. Joseph was involved with a<br/>
non religious T-ball group and by the time season was up, he hated it. With<br/>
this group he counts the days until Friday from Sat. They&#39;ve made lots of<br/>
friends and so have I. I don&#39;t look at the christian talk as anything to be<br/>
annoyed with or upset about because it doesn&#39;t include everyone possible. I<br/>
look at it as a great opportunity for my children to learn and have fun with<br/>
people different from them.<br/>
<br/>
I got flack one time because I let Tara go to summer swims at the local<br/>
freshwater beach. The people there were different. They looked different,<br/>
they spoke different and listened to different music. Tara and her friend<br/>
were literally the only ones there not like everyone else. Tara had a blast<br/>
and went all summer long. If I were uncomfortable about any of the things<br/>
that the other people were, Tara would have missed out on making great<br/>
friends and having a good time. &quot;I&quot; consider sports camp the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t have any objection to Christian environments, in general. I<br/>
don&#39;t find it very welcoming, though, to show up for, say, a dance  lesson<br/>
and then be treated to an hour of nonstop Christian-only music.  We go to<br/>
things at people&#39;s churches frequently. Sometimes we go to  Christmas Eve or<br/>
Easter services at other people&#39;s churches. We are<br/>

&quot;member&quot; of an organization that is Christian, though. It is also  different<br/>
than being exposed on a regular basis to child evangelism&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you also on the first part. Now if my child were older and<br/>
obviously getting into the religion as in wanting to participate, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have a problem with that. And if my children were coming home saying that<br/>
coach said they need to pray and coach said that God says this and that, I<br/>
would have a problem with that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530190204">Well, Brianna is my grand daughter. Her bio-mom has a jail record. Here, in Rhode Island, there&#39;s a private non-profit called Rhode Islanders Supporting Education. It&#39;s for &quot;at-risk&quot; kids. They offer<br/>
$3,000 per year for tuition<br/>
Money for books & uniforms<br/>

<br/>
Now, I was going to take advantage of this. However, the great schools (at least the ones I thought were great!) started at around $11,000 plus per year.<br/>

or pressured you or your children.  I can totally relate... Sometimes that <br/>
kind of environment can feel like  you are at a big old Amway convention.. <br/>
LOL. and you dont want no Amway.  :-)    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892655711">**When I first heard about it, (the sports camp) I was thinking I wasn&#39;t sure<br/>
either. Joe and I had been to a Christian Homeschoolers Parent support group<br/>
and got a real bad taste in our mouth. No we didn&#39;t feel comfortable or<br/>
welcomed their at all. It was just like being in church and nothing like<br/>
homeschooling. Actually it was like school in church!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
With some of the stories about these hardline Fundamentalist<br/>
Homeschoolers it sounds like a school, within a church, within a prison.<br/>
