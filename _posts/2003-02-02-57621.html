&lt;&lt; Practice seeing your children as perfect just the way they are. See if<br/>
you can stay mindful of their sovereignty from moment to moment &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s blasphemy for Christians.<br/>
<br/>
I guess now the list will heat up (when the Christians get back from church <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
There was this apple (or pomegranate) and this tree (of life or knowledge or <br/>
something) and this snake (or serpent or something) and this woman, and <br/>
that&#39;s why childbirth hurts and why children are filled with sin nature.<br/>
<br/>
No sovereignty for them!  BAD boys.  BAD girls.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone needing more reading on a Sunday, there is something very scary I <br/>
found yesterday but you&#39;ll need to go and read it there, where it&#39;s <br/>
overwhelming in its length and tone.  Don&#39;t go if you don&#39;t like to be scared.<br/>
