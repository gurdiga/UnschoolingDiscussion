<div id="ygrps-yiv-534749483">Thank you all for your good wishes regarding the adoption.  We are adoptin straight from foster care and chose not to do foster adopt, as we felt it would be too disruptive to the children we already have in our home.  (ie:  siblings coming in, than possibly leaving, etc)<br/>
<br/>
We had a dissappointment on Wednesday.  We heard from Oregon, where we were preparing for the last four months to adopt a pair of sisters.  Our case went to committee on Wednesday with one other family, and they chose the other family over us.  :-(  It is difficult when you have been moving them into your heart and mind for so long and preparing for them to just let them go.<br/>
<br/>
But!  The good news!  The Great Mother provides in her own way.  The next day I found a listing for a little girl (10 yrs) in our very own state (Idaho) who seems to fit us perfectly.  I spoke to her caseworker already and he is ecstatic about us and wanted us to fax our homestudy &quot;right now!&quot;  He was VERY positive about everything I had to say about our family and parenting styles (especially Homeschooling, Pris) and he wants this child placed in a home before the end of the summer.  He wants to move on her very quickly, and I told him that since we were preparing for several months for the two other girls in Oregon, that the timing would not be a problem for us.  I even asked how she would hadle having younger brothers and he said her foster mom runs a day care and she is great with the kids!  <br/>
<br/>
We are very excited about this child and her caseworker should now have our homestudy.  I am thinking of calling him today to make sure that the Boise office of our agency got the study to him promptly (really to check and see if he still thinks so highly of us now that he has it.  :-)  )  <br/>
<br/>
In regards to your question, Pris.  I have spoken at length to our worker about homeschooling and she is very in favor and supportive to us.  I have also spoken at length to the casworkers of kids that we are considered for, and I always explain why I feel that the IEP and the one on one attention, the freedom to choose social interactions and groups based on common interests and on the childs own terms, etc are all very much a benefit for these children with disruptions in care and hurts in their histories.  They have almost all responded positively.  I also wrote an essay for our worker about Unschooling and our style in particular to help her have a better understanding so that she could represent us better to the children&#39;s case workers.<br/>
<br/>
I have had run ins with a few ignorant case workers who refused to even consider us because we homeschool, and that is frustrating, but on the whole I have not run into that many.<br/>

fostering~to~adopt ... man, that program is NOT for the faint of heart, let<br/>
me tell you!!!  imho, just too many things can happen!!!   ohhhhhhhhhhh and<br/>
those homestudies are a piece of cake; yeah right!!!  I&#39;m sure the<br/>
caseworker thinks your fm is wonderful!!!   and that&#39;s wonderful news about<br/>
their agreeing to your h-s&#39;ing, too!!!  sounds like you&#39;ve got a couple of<br/>
great advocates on your side in the child welfare system, that&#39;s all it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707230332">I would love to see a picture, actually I would love to talk to you more <br/>
about it.  My kids are 5 and 3, but we would also like to adopt older <br/>
children (when my kids have gotten older).<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful blessing...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;WOW, this is GREAT NEWS!!!<br/>
&gt;Pris<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, and here is an update.  I called him this afternoon to make sure that <br/>
&gt;he had indeed gotten our homestudy.  Apparently, he must have gotten it <br/>
&gt;yesterday, because he had already read it, or at least skimmed it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He said &quot;I got your homestudy, and it looks good.  No, it looks REALLY <br/>
&gt;good.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He is going to call on Monday, when he has more time, to talk to me some <br/>
&gt;more about it!  Yippee!! (jumping up and down!!!)  We are so excited!  We <br/>
&gt;may have our new daughter by the end of the summer!  anybody want to see a <br/>
&gt;picture?  :-)  Te he...we are kind of giddy, it was so fast on the heels of <br/>
&gt;that big dissappointment, but it was what we needed in order to not dwell <br/>
&gt;on the loss of the girls in Oregon, and I am glad that it is happening this <br/>
&gt;way.  Now if only this one goes through all the way!<br/>
