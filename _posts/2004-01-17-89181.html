LEARNapalooza, A homeschooling experience sponsored by LEARN with workshops <br/>

This e-mail just jumped out at me!!!  Are you considering planning one?  At <br/>
the last conference Barb and I got so excited we tentatively volunteered <br/>
Columbus for the 2006 conference location.  If there are three of us working <br/>
on it it would be much easier.....<br/>
