&lt;&lt; Ferrets can&#39;t. Cats are good, domestic ferrets are totally lame.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Cats are often out and about.  I know of no one who has a ferret door and <br/>
lets the ferret come and go and sleep with them.  They&#39;ve missed out on some <br/>
natural learning.<br/>

The subject line &quot;Digest Number 304: pets...mice, rats&quot;  looked like 304 <br/>
