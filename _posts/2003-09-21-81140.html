&gt; Subject: pregnancy and surgery<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hey, all this talk about nursing and co-sleeping and general baby <br/>
&gt; stuff makes<br/>
&gt; me want to ask your opinion about my situation.  You might remember my<br/>
&gt; constant complaining about breaking my ankle last year.  Actually, I <br/>
&gt; pretty much<br/>
&gt; shattered it.  They had to use a plate with eight screws on the <br/>
&gt; outside, three<br/>
&gt; pins on the inside and lots of fake bone plaster stuff to hold it all <br/>
&gt; together.<br/>
&gt; Because my feet are deformed a bit from being en pointe at too young <br/>
&gt; an age,<br/>
&gt; the surgeon couldn&#39;t move my foot into a neutral position, even while <br/>
&gt; I was<br/>
&gt; under anesthesia.  Therefore, my foot was pointed in the cast and I <br/>
&gt; not have<br/>
&gt; very limited range of motion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, enough background.  I can walk and climb stairs, but going down <br/>
&gt; stairs is<br/>
&gt; still difficult, I don&#39;t have the flexion.  I saw my surgeon in March <br/>
&gt; and we<br/>
&gt; talked about having all the metal removed in October, so I&#39;ll be <br/>
&gt; making an<br/>
&gt; appointment to see him in the next few weeks.  One of my midwives says <br/>
&gt; any kind<br/>
&gt; of surgery, including general anesthesia, is ok in pregnancy.  The <br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; midwife says she thinks a local anesthesia would be ok.  The thing is, <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll probably<br/>
&gt; need to be on crutches to recover and would rather do that pregnant <br/>
&gt; than with<br/>
&gt; an infant.  On the other hand, the thought of my wee one getting all <br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; drugs in utero is pretty frightening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a window between one and two years after surgery that you can <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; your metal removed, otherwise the bone is too well grown around it.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt; get the metal out to help with my range of motion. Besides, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; uncomfortable to have all the metal in there, particularly when it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; humid and when you<br/>
&gt; can no longer sleep on your belly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Baby&#39;s due in January.  Anyone have any experience with surgery during<br/>
&gt; pregnancy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Elizabeth<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062934000">Speaking of gall bladders in regards to breastfeeding rather than <br/>
pregnancy --<br/>
       I had my acutely infected gallbladder removed exactly 3 months after a <br/>
Cesarean delivery. My big concern was continuing to breastfeed around the <br/>
clock, during fours days of hospitalization pre-surgery for IV anibiotics, then <br/>
the sugery and two days post-surgical.<br/>
<br/>
       I saw two problems. The drugs in my system were one, which the doctors <br/>
said would be fine as far as the milk was concerned. They just used the <br/>
choices that would not pose a threat for breastfeeding. The other problem was <br/>
physical logistics, spending several days on a surgical floor without the <br/>
rooming-in accommodations that maternity hospitalization had provided. <br/>
<br/>
       But this was fine too, because my DH traveled back and forth from home <br/>
every hour or five hours round the clock with our (sturdy and very agreeable) <br/>
baby boy and our preschool aged daughter -- except for  one night feeding, <br/>
for which I would pump during the day so DH could feed the baby by bottle on <br/>
demand, sometime between midnight and 8 am. (If we hadn&#39;t had our older child to <br/>
think about as well, or if either of our own mothers had been able to come <br/>
stay during that time, even this adaptation might not have been needed.)<br/>
<br/>
       It was really comforting to all of us, I think. He had this really key <br/>
role -- it wouldn&#39;t have been possible if he hadn&#39;t made it work -- and I <br/>
didn&#39;t feel separated or frustrated by my own health in my commitment to the <br/>
children. Our older daughter was calm and happy and never got a chance to miss me. <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
       So it all worked out amazingly well, and the bonus was that my daytime <br/>
milk supply was actually even better after pumping that extra feeding for a <br/>
week. And the surgical incision was nothing compared to the recent C-section <br/>
incision, so my mobility and ease of sleep and nursing were all much better <br/>
after the surgery than I had expected :)  JJ<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t realize that!  Another thing to worry about.  Although I have an <br/>
allergic reaction to morphine and found the drug to be highly overrated and <br/>
worthless.  But I&#39;m sure the alternatives wouldn&#39;t be nice either.<br/>
<br/>
My doctor may just recommend not doing it.  We&#39;ll see.  And being in a cast <br/>
with an infant would stink, but those consequences are more short term.  You <br/>
really had no choice but to have the surgery.  Yikes.<br/>
