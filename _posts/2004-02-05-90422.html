<div id="ygrps-yiv-853983752">Wow, Amy...What a great story.  It sounds familiar in several areas.  Especially the cuddling.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly enough, my mother in law pointed out to me that my relationship with Madison was suffering.  It killed me when I realized she was right.  <br/>
<br/>
He is such a cool kid.  They all are.  I mean, they blow me away on a daily basis.  However, I had become so caught up in &quot;fitting him into the mold&quot; that I was bordering on being angry with him for not being the &quot;Stepford Student&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I know exactly why I&#39;m here.  It&#39;s for &quot;Fellowship&quot;...and as a bit of a comfort zone when I feel like I need to say &quot;Oh please help me!!!&quot;  So far, the latter hasn&#39;t come up.  All I&#39;ve needed to do was to say &quot;What a wonderful day!!!&quot;  Sometimes, a person just needs to surround themselves with other like-minded people.  That&#39;s me.  I just wish there were more unschoolers in my immediate area.  We have one unschooler and one &quot;eclectic&quot; homeschooler...so I guess I&#39;m pretty lucky to have those.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have noticed that there are a lot of people that ask the repeat questions that are available.  I had a lot of the same concerns.  I was worried about him playing video games all day...until I read a little more on the subject and saw the questions answered.  Now I say &quot;Let him play...he&#39;s learning&quot;.  Most importantly, our relationship is blossoming and he&#39;s going to gear himself to what he needs/wants to be.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up, I was a &quot;daydreamer&quot;.  My daughter is much the same and always getting told she just &quot;Doesn&#39;t do her work&quot;...well of course she doesn&#39;t...she&#39;s got big dreams.  She wants to think about those dreams and figure out how to make them come true.  Where is that wrong?  When I grew up, it took me forever to pin down what I wanted to do with my life.  I&#39;m just getting started on it.  Why?  Because the system squelched my ability to discover myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;ll stop rambling now.  What I was trying to say, in a nutshell, was that I really appreciate your story and thanks for sharing it :)<br/>
<br/>

  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Good moments and how unschoolers learn (long)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Most of the day was just hanging out, watching TV.  I was kind of tired and <br/>
  lulled by the sound and the stories, and as 9:00 approached, I was reassuring <br/>
  myself, &quot;Okay, this is what today is.  That&#39;s okay.  Maybe it wasn&#39;t <br/>
  spectacular (maybe it was for my son), but it was certainly pleasant enough.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
  And then Fisher (6) turns off the TV, lays down on the couch cushions (which <br/>
  are on the floor because the whole living room is a pirate ship) and says, <br/>
  &quot;What am I?&quot;  He points out that his body is stiff, but not flat -- it can roll.  <br/>
  He&#39;s a log.  Then I&#39;m a clock; then he&#39;s a cow.  We play variations on 20 <br/>
  questions (What letter am I?  What number am I thinking of?  My favorite:  What <br/>
  beverage am I thinking of?) while I clean the kitchen and get the baby ready <br/>
  for bed, and we&#39;re both laughing and congratulating each other on our stumpers.<br/>
<br/>
  Just as we&#39;re on our way upstairs, he gets a bloody nose (this happens often <br/>
  -- he and I are prone to them).  He&#39;s old enough to apply pressure himself <br/>
  now, so I hand him a tissue and continue on my way.  And then he says, &quot;You used <br/>
  to sit and hold me and tell me a story.&quot;  So I did, to get him to hold still <br/>
  so I could get the bleeding to stop.  So we sit on the couch for a glorious 15 <br/>
  minutes, snuggling and telling about the time that he and Yugi rescued their <br/>
  friends from the Rare Hunters by winning at Duel Monsters.<br/>
<br/>
  When he was in school, the snuggling was getting to be almost non-existent.  <br/>
  I would ask for hugs, but he wasn&#39;t spontaneously giving them very often <br/>
  anymore.  Now he rubs my back and asks to sit on my lap (though we don&#39;t fit in the <br/>
  rocking chair anymore) and sometimes just runs up with his arms wide open.  <br/>
  His head still smells good.<br/>
<br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t be this far without this list.  Without this list I would have <br/>
  unschooled when it came to not having a curriculum, but still tried to enforce <br/>
  bedtimes and mealtimes.  Without this list and the accompanying materials <br/>
  (Sandra&#39;s site, etc.), I would have really worried about the TV being on all day.  I <br/>
  just hadn&#39;t found the material that talked about those issues until I came <br/>
  here.  (Not that it&#39;s not out there -- I just hadn&#39;t found it.)  <br/>
<br/>
  Sandra said something earlier about people needing to turn to their children <br/>
  for the interaction that helps them in unschooling, not always to the list.  <br/>
  For me it&#39;s been a combination -- the list happened to be the resource that got <br/>
  me all the way to the edge of the pool, instead of milling about in the <br/>
  showers, thinking I was swimming.<br/>
<br/>
  But I did have to jump in.  Geez, it was just about the scariest thing I&#39;d <br/>
  ever done.  Looking back, it felt like I didn&#39;t breathe for a week.  Tonight I <br/>
  could breathe -- I could smell my son&#39;s head.  Mmmm.<br/>
<br/>
  I say that this list happened to be the resource that helped me start.  I see <br/>
  now that there are others, that there are, maybe, better fits for newbies.  <br/>
  For whatever reason, I didn&#39;t know that at the time that I joined this list.  <br/>
  (I got here from unschooling.com, and I had looked around there a bit, but I <br/>
  didn&#39;t find many of the links and resources until later.  I kept getting the <br/>
  first essay, Waiting to Exhale, and not seeing a lot more.  I was skimming and sc<br/>
  anning, not carefully poring over everything.  I missed a lot along the way, <br/>
  but didn&#39;t know I was missing it -- I had been reading a lot, losing sleep over <br/>
  reading so much.)<br/>
<br/>
    I didn&#39;t really know what was meant by a discussion list as opposed to a <br/>
  support list (which is why I&#39;m hoping that this post is okay) -- you guys tried <br/>
  to tell me, but I wasn&#39;t quite getting it.  I didn&#39;t realize how many members <br/>
  there were, and how the moderators and long-timers were taking on <br/>
  responsibility to help people&#39;s thinking about unschooling.  I had been on only a few <br/>
  lists before (none of them unschooling, none of them as heavily moderated) and I <br/>
  really didn&#39;t get the nature of this particular beast.  I saw all the <br/>
  guidelines, but it didn&#39;t sink in why they were necessary.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t know if this helps as you&#39;re figuring out why people are asking <br/>
  repeat questions -- I&#39;m just trying to remember where I was at when I joined.  I <br/>
  was grabbing at any link, the first link, that came up, trying to get a handle <br/>
  on this idea that wouldn&#39;t leave me alone.  <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-114272631">So --- I think there are some good reasons why sometimes people ask <br/>
those &quot;repeat&quot; questions. And I&#39;m willing to answer them over and over, <br/>
happily. When I do get tired of it, I go do other things for a while <br/>
and someone else steps in while I&#39;m gone.<br/>
<br/>
BUT I also think there are people who just like attention and asking a <br/>
LOT of questions and arguing with the answers and giving their opinions <br/>
and examples even when they aren&#39;t really relevant and especially <br/>
before they&#39;ve really had that much experience unschooling --- there <br/>
are people who are using the list for satisfying other needs than <br/>
getting unschooling information and advice and help and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
And THOSE are the people who are exhausting and far more likely to fry <br/>
my patience.<br/>
