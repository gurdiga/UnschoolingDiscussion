<div id="ygrps-yiv-34498805">I&#39;m not sure exactly what it is your ds is interested in, the different<br/>
countries, the different weapons, the effects of war?<br/>
<br/>
National Geographic magazine is big at our house.  The pictures are<br/>
wonderful and give birth to many questions about cultures, wars, prejudices,<br/>
etc..<br/>
<br/>
My kids like museums and we always, always look at the weapons for long,<br/>
long periods of time (ds is 9).  We really like small out of the way<br/>
museums.  The docents usually take a particular interest in the children and<br/>
answer all of their questions.<br/>
<br/>
We watch a lot of time period movies and during breaks often talk about<br/>
&quot;world events&quot; of that time.  Last night, we were watching &quot;The Bounty&quot; and<br/>
the kids were amazed to learn that young boys often worked on the ships.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a military base nearby that allows you to come in?  Do they do<br/>
tours?  When my brother was 9, he filled out a card saying he was interested<br/>
in learning about a career in the military and sent it in.  To my parents<br/>
amazement, a recruiter called....obviously thinking Mike was 17 with poor<br/>
handwriting.  They sent Mike all kinds of posters and pamphlets.  He joined<br/>
the army right after high school and loved it.  He still works for the<br/>
National Guard.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any relatives that served in the military?  My great uncle used to<br/>
tell us stories from World War II and let us see and touch his medals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497447340">The Agincort scene in Kenneth Brannagh&#39;s Henry V might be of interest to him. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you could start back at the St. Crispin&#39;s day speech and paraphrase it <br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
There are boys in that battle too, as runners and banner bearers, and they&#39;re <br/>
killed (back behind the lines, just as treacherous business), and the king <br/>
says &quot;I was not angry since I came to France until this instant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s got good kid-interest.  And it was a real battle and it&#39;s <br/>
Shakespeare.  So three for one.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve ordered for Christmas from Quality Paperback is &quot;We Interrupt <br/>
This Broadcast,&quot; which is a book and CD of news flashes, original recordings, <br/>
and the texts and background info in the book.  I haven&#39;t decided who to give <br/>
it to, so maybe my husband, who can share it with the boys.  But maybe one of <br/>
the boys.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking the main thing with a five year old is it needs to be really <br/>
brief without a big buildup.  <br/>
<br/>
There might be timelines online somewhere about technological advances in <br/>
warfare.  And your child might have fun trying to put battles in order, as he <br/>
learns more about them.  Which wars were photographed?  Which had airplanes?  <br/>
Tanks?  Troop transport by something other than footmarch?<br/>

We got something similar from the library a couple of years ago. We<br/>
ended up taking it up to grandma&#39;s and playing the ones she remembered<br/>
and getting her to talk about her memories.<br/>

door (thinking of MY house...)<br/>
