<div id="ygrps-yiv-58707769">I haven&#39;t posted here in forever.  I suspect those of you who know me<br/>
didn&#39;t even realize I was still here. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to say that although I haven&#39;t had time to make any changes to<br/>
my website in a very long time- my entire life has changed in the meantime-<br/>
it&#39;s nice to know that someone still finds it useful.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, we&#39;re still unschooling, the kids are now not quite<br/>
15, 12, and about to turn 9.  Life is fun, and mostly good, and very, very<br/>
busy.<br/>
