<div id="ygrps-yiv-912579099">Hi Glena,<br/>
<br/>
I had my navel pierced as a teenager.  It HURTS!!!  But you get over it <br/>
pretty quick. &gt;BG&lt;  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing at all.   The problem I <br/>
had with my navel piercing was that I had severe rejection.  The skin <br/>
surrounding the piercing began to grow AROUND the ring!  Like a tube of skin <br/>
covering it.  It was UGLY, PAINFUL and eeewww!  It became severely infected <br/>
because I was dumb and didn&#39;t take it out right away.  Not many people <br/>
experience this and until you actually get the piercing, you don&#39;t know if <br/>
it will happen to you or not.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion would be to let her do it.  It&#39;s not permanent...she can always <br/>
take it out and will have two teeny scars that will be barely noticable.  <br/>
Even my scarring is very hard to see and I had a bad experience with it.  <br/>
Just looks like two microscopic pin dots.  (Pretty minute in comparison to <br/>
the eight kids worth of stretch marks!!! LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Just be sure the shop is licensed and uses NEW needles and sterile <br/>
techniques.  They will clamp her navel and use a hollow needle...about an <br/>
16/18 guage, if memory serves me right.  Then they hook the ring or bar on <br/>
and pull it through.  It was a rather nauseating experience but I was <br/>
thrilled with the result for the few days before the rejection kicked in.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like she has done her homework!  I would insist on keeping it clean <br/>
at all times and covered with a loose bandage if she will be wearing <br/>
anything that will come in contact with it until it is healed.  Shouldn&#39;t <br/>
take too terribly long.  Witch hazel works very well along with a triple <br/>
antibiotic ointment until it is healed completely.  Also be sure to let it <br/>
get fresh air as much as possible.  Easiest time is after a shower.  Clean <br/>
it with witch hazel and allow it to air out....no ointment, bandages or <br/>
clothing.  Other than that, have fun!!!<br/>

&gt; I do recommend a good place that is very clean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272075850">I had mine done at the tender age of 30 &lt;g&gt; a few months after I had my tongue done. {I won&#39;t mention what else i have -&lt;eg&gt;}Titanium is usually the best metal. I also used sea salt rinses in my belly button {that was the place i had to pay the most care with} I also used {because it is also good for the skin} echinachea {liquid form} topicly after I cleaned it. It seemed to help it to heal right after, but I started using it after some time {it does take the bb a goo while to heal} so it could have been the fact that time had elapsed. :-)Tracy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85123932">i had my own navel pierced a couple years back. i didn&#39;t feel a thing. the <br/>
man who did it told me to use sea salt and water and soak it every day. i <br/>
later found out i&#39;m allergic to sea salt, who&#39;d thunk it!? anyway i&#39;d let her <br/>
do it if she don&#39;t like it she can always take it out. however if she does <br/>
love it tell her not to leave the gauge out for any period of time except <br/>
cleaning after it heals, those holes grow up fast.<br/>
