&lt;&lt; I&#39;m about to read The Price of Motherhood.  Of course we all know that<br/>
 parenting as SAHM&#39;s is an intelligent, valid choice, but it is clear that<br/>
 this is not a highly respected, well-paid profession! &gt;&gt;<br/>

     I know what you mean but I think the problem lies in defining ANYONE by  how they earn their money.  It&#39;s one aspect of their lives but it doesn&#39;t  have much to do with whether we&#39;ll have something important in common with  the person (usually) and I wish we would get away from that being the most  common first question when people meet (so what do you do...translation, how  do you earn your money?)<br/>
