<div id="ygrps-yiv-435785770">Just waiting for summer,  a CA beach girl here, Shannon<br/>
<br/>
Shannon,<br/>
You remind me of a Shannon I knew when I was a teenager.  She was one of my<br/>
very best friends and was very much a &quot;Clifornia Beach Girl.&quot;  We were<br/>
roomates for a while.  She died a long time ago, and I miss her.  Thanks<br/>
for inviting her back into the front of my mind for a visit.  She always<br/>
lives in my heart.<br/>
