&gt;but no real memories.<br/>
&gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, I never thought about this.<br/>
<br/>
I have almost no memories of elementary school age and younger.  My parents<br/>
split when I was in fifth grade, and I remember that.  I remember the places<br/>
we lived before that and the people who lived near, but not much more.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it, I feel, is that I had no sibs then, to back up my memories.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t get sibs until my mom remarried and had my first brother when I was<br/>
19.  (At 36 I have 17 and 14 year old brothers (mom&#39;s) and an almost 12 year<br/>
old sister (dad&#39;s))<br/>
<br/>
But I also just don&#39;t remember much of anything before the day my folks<br/>
brought me in and said Dad was moving out.  Oh, and my mom swears I actually<br/>
helped my dad move into his bachelor pad.  Uhm, ok Mom, I beleive you<br/>
but....NOTHING!!!<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s what, no real memories from before age 10?  My husband talks about<br/>
remembering Kindergarten and earlier.  Nope, not me.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how much of that has to do with not being able to get into the head<br/>
of my 7 year old sometimes.   Weird, I just never put the two together.<br/>
Have to really think about this.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, thanks Sandra!  -grin-<br/>

Honestly, it probably WILL help, but that&#39;s one reason people shut down early <br/>
memories (or their brains just do it for them) in SOME cases (probably not <br/>
all)--they just don&#39;t want to get into it with themselves.     Some people don&#39;t <br/>
collect memories and that&#39;s not terrible.  Some people aren&#39;t mental <br/>
packrats.  I am.  Holly is.  She remembers all kinds of useless information.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe in a way you &quot;handled the divorce well&quot; by closing down earlier <br/>
memories so you didn&#39;t have to have regrets.  Maybe your parents used to fight, or <br/>
you didn&#39;t want to look back to see clues to the divorce coming, or maybe it was <br/>
just really happy and you didn&#39;t want to have to pine for that.  (TOTALLY <br/>
guessing, but one germ of it might help.)<br/>

missing stuff.  It&#39;s odd, because in MANY ways, I AM a mental packrat.  I<br/>
think it helps me be a better writer.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So far as I know, my parents never faught much in front of me.  I have one<br/>
image of being not allowed in their bedroom when the were talking and my mom<br/>
sounding REALLY upset.  But although I associate that with &quot;the talk&quot; about<br/>
them seperating, the reality is that memory isn&#39;t connected in time to<br/>
ANYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think I should talk to my folks about it.  I&#39;m sure my mom would<br/>
answer me and be honest, but I&#39;m not so sure about my dad.  Oh, he&#39;d be<br/>
honest, but I&#39;m not sure he&#39;d answer me.  -smile-  Not a big &quot;analyzer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do look at my little brothers and sisters and wonder at their lives.  Very<br/>
stable.  None of them remembers living in more than two houses.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure my sister even really remembers living in New York, before they moved<br/>
back to Florida.  And my brothers have lived in the same town their whole<br/>
lives.  Very different from the constant moving and grad school parents that<br/>
I experienced.  Weird.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting thought.  I have memories of elementary school, but very, very<br/>
few.   I&#39;ve always thought that perhaps my trouble getting into the head of<br/>
my almost-seven year old is that I was never a little boy, and he&#39;s just<br/>
really different than I was as a little girl.  I was pretty girly; dolls,<br/>
barbies, and all that.  Not that you&#39;d know that now, necessarily, although<br/>
Sandra gave me a bunch of flak when I was there about my pink tee shirts...!<br/>

brenda<br/>
hanging out at Mom&#39;s and back to wearing black.  family tends to inspire<br/>

Just one comment per shirt.<br/>
SHEESH!  &quot;bunch of flak&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt;hanging out at Mom&#39;s and back to wearing black. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I learned this about Brenda:  She&#39;s been a professional classical musician <br/>
since she was a teenager.  She SHOULD have a bunch of black clothes.  Black <br/>
formal gowns.  Black turtle necks and black wool pants.  Black.  Not pink.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, who pretty much wears jeans and tie-dye and so should shush up about <br/>
fashion</div>
