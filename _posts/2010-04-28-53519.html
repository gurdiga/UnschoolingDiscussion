I remember noticing some of that when my boys were a little younger, now it seems like most of their friends families have loosened up (my oldest two are 7 and 8).  There was a time I was kind of determined not to have toy guns and then when my oldest was 3, he saw a flair gun on a movie and the next day built one out of legos to shoot pretend bad animals.  He didnt even know the word gun.. he called it a shooting thing. <br/>
I havnt experienced to many people against lightsabers and swords.. just guns.  I believe they think by playing with them their kids will be more violent.</div>

<br/>
My oldest did the same thing, but not because of a movie or tv show that<br/>
he&#39;d seen. He was about 3-1/2 at the time, didn&#39;t have any toy guns yet, and<br/>
in the course of playing created a gun, and then ran around thrusting it at<br/>
things and making &quot;pew&quot; noises. LOL He hadn&#39;t seen any of our handguns at<br/>
that point, nor had he seen any in the shows he watched. Where he got the<br/>
idea to make this, I don&#39;t know. He&#39;s since had squirt guns, Star Wars guns<br/>
and lightsabers, fought with boffer swords in the SCA, has a growing Nerf<br/>
gun collection, and gone shooting with his grandpa, grandpa&#39;s ex-treasury<br/>
agent friend, and his dad. Grandpa said he was a remarkably good shot<br/>
considering he&#39;d never shooting before.<br/>
<br/>
When he was younger, in deference to the many people out there that don&#39;t<br/>
want their children &quot;exposed to violence&quot;, I used to make sure that Craig<br/>
asked if the kids wanted to play guns, or whatever, so they could opt out if<br/>
it made them uncomfortable. A couple did, but most didn&#39;t, and they ran<br/>
around happily playing. I don&#39;t get why so many people have the assumption<br/>
that playing guns will make kids violent. As our two kids have obviously<br/>
made us aware, even if they don&#39;t have any of their own, they&#39;ll come up<br/>
with a way to make a toy gun of their own. :D<br/>

My abusive, alcoholic step-father had a handgun. Bad combo. I have many very<br/>
bad childhood memories of that gun pointed at my mother, my siblings or<br/>
myself. It is very hard to get past that memory...of a gun about 2 inches<br/>
from my nose, cocked, because he wanted my mother to do something. Another<br/>
memory is when he used the gun to shoot all the ornaments off our christmas<br/>
tree.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that the issue is not the gun he had but the stupid, irrational,<br/>

<br/>
Any credible evidence relating the two what, violence and toy weapons? Well, if you think playing with toy weapons is violent in and of itself, then yes. If you are wondering if playing with toy weapons leads to real and serious violent tendencies in older children, I haven&#39;t seen anything to directly support that. The thing is that children will find ways to play these &quot;violent&quot; games with or without the toys. Sticks, fingers, just about anything can become a weapon in a child&#39;s imagination. My 6yo just yesterday was using a plastic cross that was part of my husband&#39;s Halloween costume as a knife for fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, having 3 boys, I get very angry at this way of thinking. It&#39;s basically telling boys that their natural male instincts are bad. Males have evolved to be hunters and warriors and to deny that part of them is to say their very being is wrong or bad. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that&#39;s what makes boys violent.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t let our neighbor - a boy - bring his weapons into my house. <br/>
We had our own, even with three girls, but he was like a different kid <br/>
when he had his weapons with him versus when he checked them at the <br/>
door. When he had his weapons (they varied) with him, the other kids <br/>
constantly complained about him - he wouldn&#39;t cooperate in whatever <br/>
games they were trying to play - whether they were board games or <br/>
playing pretend or whatever, he&#39;d just keep brandishing the weapons at <br/>
people. When we made a policy of checking weapons at the door, he was <br/>
fine and they liked having him play with them. But one day the kid <br/>
forgot to take his weapons with him when he went home and his father <br/>
came back to collect them and found out about how I didn&#39;t allow them <br/>
into the house. The father hit the roof - he yelled at me about how I <br/>
didn&#39;t understand boys.<br/>
<br/>
At our park days, there was a boy who brought a big huge box - almost as <br/>
big as he was - of all kinds of cool weapons - mostly swords, but also <br/>
wooden rifles, all kinds of things. He&#39;d drag it over and the kids would <br/>
all dig in and it was really the source of all kinds of great pretend <br/>
play - hours and hours and hours of it. The difference? Partly, of <br/>
course, being outdoors in a park - a very different environment from <br/>
playing in my daughter&#39;s bedroom. But a bigger difference was in the <br/>
kids themselves. The weapons that the neighbor boy had were specific to <br/>
certain characters - tv shows or movies- and he only pretended to be <br/>
that character when he had that weapon.- he wasn&#39;t into making up <br/>
elaborate stories and characters, he just blasted away at people and <br/>
interfered with everything the other kids tried to set up. The <br/>
homeschooled kids at the park day used the weapons as props in their <br/>
very imaginative games.<br/>
<br/>
I liked when the weapons were brought to our park day. Those parents who <br/>
were horrified, wouldn&#39;t come back and they were not the best fit for <br/>
our park day, anyway, so it was kind of a good filter.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, when we went other places with people who objected <br/>
to: toy weapons, bare feet, sugar, plastic water bottles, fast food, and <br/>
I&#39;m sure there are other things, we just accommodated to them without <br/>
giving it much thought.<br/>

Various cultures have had a backlash against boys being raised by  <br/>

getting way too much to the girly side in the past few decades.     <br/>
It&#39;s not just mothers, though, it&#39;s school too.   Too girly, and  <br/>

It could be very healing to see your children use guns in play, in a happy way.  They may just show you another way of being with guns.  Perhaps the connection of guns and evil step father will be replaced with toy guns and joyful children.  I&#39;m sorry you ever experienced that!<br/>

It is always going to be something with some parents.  We regularly bring several bags of sand toys to park days and just plain regular visits to the park.  It&#39;s a great way to meet new friends and my children love to share and play in the sand with kids of many ages.  There is always some parent who doesn&#39;t want their child to play in the watery sand, or the child doesn&#39;t have any sand toys at home so they spend their time just throwing sand in everybody&#39;s faces or throwing the toys all over the park or trying to hide them or steal them.  Their parents have spent so much time regulating or telling them &quot;no&quot; that their play is affected with baggage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207227369">Maybe too picky but this list encourages preciseness in language use.<br/>
I think it important to remember to say it is toy guns or imaginary guns<br/>
that one &quot;plays&quot; with.    I have decades of being drilled that one does not<br/>
&quot;play&quot; with guns just as one never assumes that a gun is unloaded or points<br/>
any gun at anyone unless willing to harm that person.<br/>
<br/>
I think both boys and girls should learn about real guns as well as toy guns<br/>
and pretend guns  and when to use either.<br/>
Learning about other weapons is also a useful skill.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538204566">This might be somewhat unrelated but the thread reminded me of a  <br/>
recent experience with my 3 yo daughter - who doesn&#39;t play with guns  <br/>
or lightsabres.<br/>
<br/>
We went to visit my 7 & 9 yo brothers whom she hadn&#39;t seen since she  <br/>
was a baby as they live far away. These two boys play really rough  <br/>
though they are very loving towards each other. Rough play seems to be  <br/>
a way that they can play with power, connect and blow off steam all at  <br/>
the same time. My daughter was mesmerized and at one point went right  <br/>
up to them while they were wrestling so she could observe them more  <br/>
closely.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the trip she wanted to join in and started to &#39;wap&#39; the 9 yo  <br/>
in the head (which I imagine looked like something she had seen them  <br/>
do to each other). The rough-housing between my brothers had resulted  <br/>
in tears on a number of occasions when things got too rough but in  <br/>
balance it was clearly a positive form of play for these boys and  <br/>
obviously of interest to my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
In the situation my response was to tell her to be gentle which I  <br/>
later wished had been &#39;not on the head&#39; or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that props like guns or lightsabres or whatever are just  <br/>
extensions of that kind of power play.</div>

I too had an alcoholic, abusive step father with a gun.  I remember hopping out of the car when I was 9 to step in between him and another man with a pistol.  The two men were yelling at each other over a traffic situation (this was the late 70s in NYC.  Apparently lots of people had guns.)  I stepped between them because I thought that neither one would shoot if they saw a little girl between them.  Fortunately I was right.  My point is that when my son used to play guns of all sorts his play had absolutely *nothing* to do with the fear and terror of those real gun situations.  He grew up safe and sound with no real violence in his experience.  The pretend gun play was something entirely different for him.  It was joyful and fun and the minute I recognized this, my impulse to keep the pretend guns away from him evaporated.  He has played with just about every form of toy gun and sword and virtual weapon there is.  He has never been interested in shooting a real gun and is personally at age 16 a pacifist in real life though he enjoys playing first person shooter - video games.  If I hadn&#39;t understood this early on we would have had years of conflict over it since he was so strongly in love with that sort of play.  Now that I can see how very very peaceful he grew up to be I am really glad I didn&#39;t spend those years fighting, arguing, or shaming him over it.<br/>

&gt; people. When we made a policy of checking weapons at the door, he was <br/>
&gt; fine and they liked having him play with them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had a boy like this in our neighborhood. He moved recently. He never tried to bring them into my house. As a matter of fact, I think he might not have been allowed in other people&#39;s houses because he only came in our house a few times in the 3 years we knew him and then only for a few minutes. He mostly chased the kids outside with them threatening to chop off their heads or something like that. He obviously did not use them in the same way that the other kids used weapons, as props as you&#39;ve said, but rather for seriously intimidating the other kids. I had other issues with this boy, though, so I don&#39;t think it was the fact that he had the weapons to play with. I think it was because of the way this particular kid wanted to play with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901105825"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Various cultures have had a backlash against boys being raised by  <br/>
&gt; women.  Ours probably will have too, here, pretty soon because it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; getting way too much to the girly side in the past few decades.     <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not just mothers, though, it&#39;s school too.   Too girly, and  <br/>
&gt; enforced on young men who are six feet tall and have beards and  <br/>
&gt; moustaches!?  (and the equivalent marks of manhood elswhere)    <br/>
&gt; Dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a friend who&#39;s 2nd child was a boy. She was so worried that she wouldn&#39;t know how to raise a boy. She was working out his sensitivity training before he was born. I couldn&#39;t wrap my brain around that. I really didn&#39;t understand what all the worry was about. If we take each child as an individual and respond to that, we don&#39;t have to think much about whether the child is male or female. As I&#39;m sure everyone knows, not all boys are macho and not all girls are soft and frilly. It is dangerous if we try to suppress some natural aspect of a person&#39;s personality, which is what I think happens when parents refuse to let their children play with toy weapons. It&#39;s one more thing to feel bad about wanting to do because the parents disapprove.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690182366"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think both boys and girls should learn about real guns as well as toy guns<br/>
&gt; and pretend guns  and when to use either.<br/>
&gt; Learning about other weapons is also a useful skill.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In relation to the talk about global warming, learning to use guns and other weapons/dangerous tools could be a very useful skill in the same way learning to grow vegetables is.  I used to think hunting was an unnecessary cruelty. Why do people need to go out in the forest and shoot a poor, defenseless deer when they can just go to the supermarket and buy meat? Since then I&#39;ve come to think that the way cattle are raised for meat is more cruel than hunting. Several months ago I was telling my husband that I wish I knew how to hunt so I wasn&#39;t so dependent on the supermarket and the mass meat producers.<br/>
