<div id="ygrps-yiv-472426310">Depending on your kids, you can be extra cool NOW.<br/>
I have two adolescent boys, so for me it was easy.<br/>
<br/>
Weird Al has a new CD out this week called &quot;Poodle Hat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If your kids don&#39;t even know it&#39;s out they will be amazed.<br/>
<br/>
Notable is a Spiderman song called &quot;Ode to a Superhero,&quot; done to Billy Joel&#39;s <br/>
&quot;Piano Man.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same music (as they do) so imagine the beginning of Piano Man, piano and <br/>
harmonica, and the first lines are:<br/>
<br/>
Poor Peter Parker was pitiful,<br/>
Couldn&#39;t&#39;a been any shyer<br/>
Mary Jane still wouldn&#39;t notice him<br/>
Even if his hair was on fire. . .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s one called &quot;Bob.&quot;<br/>
No further explanation.<br/>
So I get it totally, and my kids are shruggin&#39;. <br/>
It&#39;s a very Bob-Dylan voice, music, weird seemingly disjoint lyrics.  <br/>
No, these ARE disjoint, but sometimes it kinda sounds like something <br/>
&quot;profound&quot; Bob Dylan would&#39;ve written.   And sung with feeling, and the suggestion of <br/>
&quot;YOU know what I mean,&quot; it almost starts to make sense once in a while.  <br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the lyrics, and its easier to get if you see them written <br/>
than if you just hear them:<br/>
<br/>
(Wait.   Don&#39;t read this if you don&#39;t want a puzzle solved that you could <br/>
solve yourself more entertainingly if you know you&#39;re going to get the CD.)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I, man, am regal--a German am I<br/>
Never odd or even, if I had a hi-fi;<br/>
Madam, I&#39;m Adam, too hot to hoot;<br/>
No lemons, no melons, too bad I hid a boot.<br/>
Lisa Bonet ate no basil, Warsaw was raw;<br/>
Was it a car or a cat I saw?<br/>
<br/>
[harmonica solo and three more cool verses]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are others I didn&#39;t appreciate as much as the boys did, because they <br/>
know different music.<br/>
There are a couple of gross ones, but hey, his main fan base is adolescent <br/>
boys and so he ow water in my toilet&quot; and &quot;My love for you is like diarrhea, I <br/>
just can&#39;t hold it in&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  And there&#39;s a polka medley too.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a song about e-bay (parody of the Backstreet Boys &quot;I Want it That <br/>
Way&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a review by someone besides me, with a good photo which is NOT in the <br/>
CD fold-out/liner notes/booklet, whatever it&#39;s called (though there are other <br/>
good photos in there):<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a big Weird Al fan, and have already had three other people say they want <br/>
to get a block of tickets for the concert to sit together as we did a couple <br/>
of years back AND I stalled two weeks before looking at the date because I was <br/>
really afraid it would be August 22 weekend, but HOORAY!  It&#39;s August 15!!!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s who can&#39;t go to Kelly&#39;s conference now, because they need to see Weird <br/>
Al instead:<br/>
<br/>
 August 22     DETROIT, MI                     Meadowbrook Music Festival<br/>
 August 24     ST. PAUL, MN                    Minnesota State Fair<br/>
<br/>
I am SO glad he added Albuquerque.  Honestly.  My kids had already seen him.  <br/>
I had been tempted once to stay another day in Sacramento to hear him at the <br/>
California state fair, but... it wasn&#39;t doable.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not only funny and a seriously great musician, he&#39;s also a <br/>
contortionist, and a heck of an athletic performer.  Costume changes, jumping, dancing, <br/>
playing accordion upside down...<br/>
<br/>
Enough gush.  If you have a good excuse to buy this, or a birthday or <br/>
something coming for someone who would appreciate this, there it is.<br/>

<br/>
**August 24     ST. PAUL, MN                    Minnesota State Fair**<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll only be about 1400 miles away from home that weekend.  It&#39;s Ok,  I&#39;d<br/>
rather be at my first unschooling get together than the Weird Al concert.<br/>

lines like<br/>

<br/>
Bob (the word bob) is a palindrome. The lyrics are random palindromes all <br/>
stuck together, and damned if it didn&#39;t really sound like ol Bob at times...  :)<br/>
<br/>
Pat&#39;s birthday was the 12th. I waited and presented him with Poodle Hat the <br/>
day it came out. I&#39;ve got the line &quot;Why&#39;d I have to get myself decapitated?&quot; <br/>
running over and over in my head after this afternoons run to return a friend to <br/>
his home 45 minutes away. Oh, he also recommends watching the movie ten or <br/>
twenty times, so you can watch Al saying HOOLIGAN! over and over as in &quot;Thank <br/>
you for buying my cd instead of downloading it like some HOOLIGAN!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s in Chicago July 26th, and Rockford on Aug 23rd. Rockford is closer, but <br/>
I plan to not be here then so I guess we&#39;ll have to brave Navy Pier.<br/>

I did get the movie to run but the photos and lyrics just give me the menu.  <br/>
It recommended that I stop other programs and give all the memory to Quicktime <br/>
(or something).  Then *I* recommended to me that I wait for Kirby.<br/>
