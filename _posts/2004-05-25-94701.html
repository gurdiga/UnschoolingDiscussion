I checked out your website and the pond, looks good, looking forward to <br/>
seeing the photos of the whole thing.  I can&#39;t wait to move out of our house in the <br/>
suburbs, small yards in a development, no trees, back to the country!<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking at chicken coop designs too- there are a lot online.  But <br/>
we have to move first, and find a house in a suitable area. <br/>
 I wouldn&#39;t move if I were you either, your place & location looks perfect <br/>
for the kids!  good luck with the chickens!<br/>

Thanks for the kudos! It&#39;s nice to show off a little. *sheepish grin* The<br/>
pond and climber have really become our favorite spot to hang out. We have<br/>
lots of bonding time--I can&#39;t say enough about it. I think it adds so much<br/>
to our unschooling lives because we enjoy being together there. It&#39;s just a<br/>
really special place.<br/>
<br/>
I uploaded some photos to the bottom of my projects page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://danielleconger.com/Homeschool/projects.html">http://danielleconger.com/Homeschool/projects.html</a>  while I was putting some<br/>
other photos up. There are several there which should give you some idea of<br/>
the process and magnitude of the project. Certifiable would be a good<br/>

Priscilla--basically I spent a lot of time finding photos of things I like<br/>
on the internet. I bought the book _Creating Water Gardens_ by Ortho and<br/>
borrowed several others from the library. I think the most important thing<br/>
is to just look at loads of photos so you know exactly what look you want.<br/>
There are preformed ponds you can buy at Lowe&#39;s, for instance, but for a<br/>
pond the size of mine, you have to buy a special rubber liner--basically<br/>
roofing rubber but made non-toxic for fish and wildlife. Feel free to email<br/>
me off list if you have any specific questions about the process.<br/>
