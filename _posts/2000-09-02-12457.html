<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770916367">Maybe some people don&#39;t want to hear this &quot;stuff&quot; because they don&#39;t want to <br/>
take a look at the way they are dealing with their kids or are uncomfortable <br/>
with how they are treating their children and certainly don&#39;t want to have to <br/>
address that area of their lives!!!  (LOL)... I find that when I&#39;m resistent <br/>
to learning about something it&#39;s usually because I have some emotions tied up <br/>
with a particular subject and I&#39;m scared people are going to disagree with my <br/>
way of doing things.<br/>
<br/>
I love what was written with the Aware Parents and also the 20 things to deal <br/>
with kids (I know this is not what they are called, but I&#39;m not on the e-mail <br/>
that was written right now and am too lazy to look back for the title)... I <br/>
read this to my hubby in the car while out driving somewhere... Zak was <br/>
listening intently (or so I thought) and then says &quot;mummy can I have the <br/>
pages you have there in your hand with the numbers on it? and why doesn&#39;t it <br/>
go up to 100?&quot;  100 is his favorite number right now... I gave him the pages <br/>
to look at and the numbers and decided to read the rest to hubbie later...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not comfortable with hitting my children... I have only seen it bring <br/>
about fear in a child and not love, understanding or worship of the person <br/>
doing it.  I don&#39;t see that it teaches them anything except how to be sneaky <br/>
so they don&#39;t get caught or to be petrified of this bigger person who can <br/>
physically harm them in a fit of rage.  Hitting, spanking or any kind of <br/>
violence to a child, is raging on the parents&#39; part.  I&#39;ve never seen a <br/>
parent hit a child when the parent was in control of their own emotions.  It <br/>
always seems to be out of a need to control the situation or the child.  If <br/>
people are comfortable in the knowledge that is the way other people perceive <br/>
what you are doing then go ahead and spank your child, while the rest of us <br/>
shake our heads and feel so sad for that little person that has to take the <br/>
punishment of the parents feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not particularly bothered who likes this and who doesn&#39;t.  I&#39;m here for <br/>
my benefit and what I can learn, so there&#39;s absolutely no point in telling me <br/>
to keep my opinion to myself.  That would be like telling me to send my child <br/>
to school....<br/>
