 I apologize for the comment. It was just a smart ass FYI. I&#39;m sure <br/>
 many don&#39;t care when the exact time of the full moon is, and I should <br/>
 respect that. Please forgive me, I didn&#39;t mean to detract from your <br/>
 post, it was quite good.<br/>

But I appreciated having that information, and I actually like it when people <br/>
correct information I had wrong.<br/>
So if I ever get something wrong, please fyi away!!<br/>
I actually looked up at the moon that night and told my dh the exact time of <br/>
the full moon and thought &quot;way cool, I learned this at my e-mail list!!!<br/>
Accuracy is a good thing.<br/>
