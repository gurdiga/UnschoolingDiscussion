&lt;&lt; My friends and kids laugh when I empty my pockets because I&#39;m always <br/>
carrying dice around with me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, I saved that post and put it here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/m/pamdice">http://sandradodd.com/m/pamdice</a><br/>
<br/>
It can be easily amended or turned into a pointer to another better version <br/>
whenever you want, Pam.<br/>
<br/>
And another thing is I had another friend with three little kids too, when <br/>
mine were little, and when we&#39;d see each other one would say &quot;Mom pockets!&quot; and <br/>
we&#39;d pull out what was in our front jeans pockets.   Dice, game markers, <br/>
marbles, little Barbie or Ninja Turtle parts--the stuff we&#39;d find and pick up and <br/>
carry around until we got a chance to put them where they really went.   <br/>
Sometimes diaper pins or mom-supplies were in there too.  <br/>
<br/>
As scattery as I am about stuff, I&#39;m happy to see that my boys take after <br/>
their dad in keeping their wallets extremely well organized.  I haven&#39;t really <br/>
examined carefully, but once in a while I pick up a wallet to see whose it is <br/>
(or USED to, they rarely leave them anywhere random anymore) and was amazed at <br/>
the organization!  Or sometimes one will hand me his wallet to get some money <br/>
out for him or something.<br/>
<br/>
I got both Kirby and Marty state ID cards (like a driver&#39;s license for a <br/>
non-driver) years ago so they could ride the city bus as students (proof of age <br/>
and photo), and got them wallets to carry them in.  They are amazing <br/>
wallet-organizers.  Cool!<br/>
<br/>
But me, pockets full of this&#39;n&#39;that.  Desk full.  Little cups and bowls full <br/>
of stuff I might refile someday.  Three junk drawers, not counting the battery <br/>
drawer in the hall (full of junk for hanging pictures and repairing stuff and <br/>
glue) and the bathroom drawer (lots of non-bathroom stuff).<br/>
