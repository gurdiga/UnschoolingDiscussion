<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658273416">I found this group the other night while browsing the web and this<br/>
seemed like the kind of group I have been looking for. Here is a<br/>
little bit about my homeschooling/wanting to unschool family..<br/>
<br/>
I come from a very strict public school bloodline as does my husband.<br/>
We both went to public schools and we both were not satisfied with it.<br/>
We both made excellent grades in school but did not like the way the<br/>
schooling system was (or still is for that matter.) We both dropped<br/>
out of the public school system and I went on to get my diploma at<br/>
home.In a nutshell, I homeschooled myself so that I could graduate. <br/>
<br/>
We have 3 children ages (9,4, and 3). Our oldest went to a public<br/>
school until about a year and a half ago. Before he attended school, I<br/>
taught him things at home. When we sent him to public school he was<br/>
very bored with class so he talked a lot and because of his size (he<br/>
is little for his age) he would get bullied.I had the bully removed<br/>
from his class of course but there was still that talking he was doing<br/>
in school. He was also getting to where he was &quot;getting sick&quot; every<br/>
morning so he wouldn&#39;t have to go. Well to make a long story short, I<br/>
got pulled into class for a parent teacher conference. They asked me<br/>
if I taught my son at home along with what he was learning at school<br/>
and of course I said yes. They said &quot;Please stop&quot;. I just had to<br/>
laugh, when I asked why they said &quot;He learns enough from school<br/>
already and because you teach him at home too, he is bored in<br/>
class.Which explains the talking. Every thing we hand out he knows<br/>
already, so he is bored.&quot; That was the last straw and he was pulled<br/>
out of school that day. I did not feel that my teaching at home was<br/>
hindering him at school because I did not really &quot;teach&quot;. I just spent<br/>
time with him, reading, coloring, and such. I did not really look at<br/>
it like teaching because I was doing things with him that I didn&#39;t<br/>
remember doing in school.<br/>
<br/>
With that being said, I have been homeschooling my child for a little<br/>
while now and I do not feel the traditional homeschooling is working<br/>
for him. I am afraid that I am not sure what to do anymore.What I mean<br/>
is this,  because I was raised a certain way and so was my husband I<br/>
feel like I am not doing my part by forcing paper work on him or<br/>
making him do tests and such. I am having a hard time getting this<br/>
structured way of schooling (that I did not like myself growing up)<br/>
out of my system. I feel that if I do not have paper work for him to<br/>
do, tests for him to take, or a ton of reading to do, that I am not<br/>
doing a good job and therefore he will not learn. <br/>
<br/>
I already know that all this stuff is not working for him.There are<br/>
endless tears, frustration and anger on both our parts and I do not<br/>
want this.Also I have family breathing down my neck because they feel<br/>
that since I am not a teacher I am not qualified and that he will be<br/>
behind on things that they would be teaching him in a public school. <br/>
I pulled him out of public school because of all this frustration he<br/>
was getting. and now I am being the one doing it to him.<br/>
<br/>
A couple months back I came across the idea of unschooling. I have<br/>
been studying on it A BUNCH and really feel this will work for him. I<br/>
already try to incorporate some into what we do and let him choose a<br/>
lot of what he wants to learn but then I start to feel that ugly<br/>
public school structure poking its head out at me again.I live in a<br/>
pretty laid back state (Georgia). My only fear is that I am not doing<br/>
enough. <br/>
<br/>
There are days when all my son wants to do is watch TV or play video<br/>
games.I guess I shouldn&#39;t complain to much cause he likes to watch<br/>
Animal Planet, Food Network or the History Channel a lot. But again, I<br/>
was raised to think that too much tv can cause a child to fail and is<br/>
not good, and I feel terrible for letting him sometimes.I feel as if I<br/>
should restrict him some.<br/>
<br/>
Also I have a 4 year old. She LOVES books but does not now how to<br/>
read. She can recognize some letters but can not seem to connect<br/>
letters with sounds. Anyway, I was in this other homeschooling group<br/>
and I felt really terrible that my daughter can not read yet. This<br/>
group was bragging on how their 4 year old can read and mine is still<br/>
learning letter. I keep tons of reading material around the house and<br/>
she will pick up a book and make her own stories up but I was<br/>
wondering if I should try to help her into reading or how do I go<br/>
about letting her do it naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh, I know I am rambling but I really love the concept of unschooling<br/>
and feel that, with a little work, it will prove to be the best thing<br/>
for our family. Only thing is, I think I am the one who needs the<br/>
work. Can you all please help me. I need some guidance. I need help<br/>
and understanding on unschooling. I have read websites and some of<br/>
your posts on here and I get some of the concepts of it but have that<br/>
feeling that without a ton of paperwork they will never learn. Sorry<br/>
if this does not make sense. I know what I want to say but am having<br/>
trouble getting it out on here.<br/>
<br/>
Help in Georgia, <br/>

her to a public school is probably the worst available option.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-386306983"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; They asked me<br/>
&gt; if I taught my son at home along with what he was learning at school<br/>
&gt; and of course I said yes. They said &quot;Please stop&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is actually not too uncommon. When I was younger, my mom spent a<br/>
lot of time with me and I learned to read, write and do math (even<br/>
simple algebra) before I attended Kindergarten. It was too late for<br/>
them to tell her to stop teaching me, but they recommended to her that<br/>
she should not teach my little brother. So, she didn&#39;t help him learn<br/>
to write his name, she didn&#39;t even say the ABCs with him.. and<br/>
surprise.. they complained about that, too. So, you can&#39;t really<br/>
please the public school system.. they will always find something to<br/>
complain about.. even their own advice. But, the fact that I was<br/>
raised to question the status quo and find answers for myself, rather<br/>
than rely on some person that may or may not be telling me the entire<br/>
truth did conflict horribly with public school and ended up with me<br/>
dropping out in High School. Which renders me, to my family and<br/>
apparently my neighbors, completely unsatisfactory for the<br/>
responsibility of teaching my own child. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; With that being said, I have been homeschooling my child for a little<br/>
&gt; while now and I do not feel the traditional homeschooling is working<br/>
&gt; for him. I am afraid that I am not sure what to do anymore.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say, to spend some time &#39;deschooling.&#39; It really helps to just<br/>
take &#39;time off&#39; from the schoolish way of doing things. I pulled my<br/>
son out of school at the beginning of this school year. My head was<br/>
swirling at the amount of useless crap he was supposed to have<br/>
memorized by the end of first grade. We began by doing nothing and I<br/>
watched as his interests unfolded. When we started &#39;doing nothing,&#39; I<br/>
simply kept a notebook that I would write a list of things we did<br/>
everyday. So, I would have a record to present and to help me write<br/>
Georgia&#39;s required yearly progress report. Keeping the list of things<br/>
we did helped me realize that learning is everywhere. Just live life<br/>
for a while, and over time, you will recognize that he can learn just<br/>
by being alive. If I write, &quot;We made cookies.&quot; I can easily break that<br/>
down into: We did math, we did reading, we did home ec. All of those<br/>
worksheets are just busywork and prep for standardized testing, which<br/>
we don&#39;t do. There&#39;s a big difference between learning things and<br/>
memorizing things so you can get the busy work out of the way faster.<br/>
A good example is math. My son&#39;s school-going friends are stuck in<br/>
class memorizing addition and subtraction facts this year and watching<br/>
flash cards so they can easily determine how many objects are<br/>
presented to them in less than 3 seconds. My son, on the other hand,<br/>
isn&#39;t interested in memorizing addition and subtraction. Instead he<br/>
skipped the memorization and decided to explore multiplication. I&#39;ve<br/>
never asked him to write any of it down.. he does it in his head. If I<br/>
gave him worksheets to encourage memorization over actually grasping<br/>
the concept, I think it would be a disservice.<br/>
<br/>
My family is also concerned. They expect my son to be reading any<br/>
grade-level appropriate book they pick up and tell him to read. But,<br/>
it doesn&#39;t work that way. My son is too focused on the fruits of his<br/>
labor. If there are no fruits to be had, he&#39;s not interested. Reading<br/>
a book because someone else thinks he should do it, has no value to<br/>
him. But, reading the recipes in a cookbook while we cook has a solid,<br/>
tangible result that he&#39;s excited about. Of course, no one thinks<br/>
about grabbing the cookbook and asking him to share some of his<br/>
favorite recipes. Why not? It&#39;s not grade-level appropriate? They<br/>
don&#39;t expect him to be able to do this. <br/>
<br/>
A book that&#39;s not exactly about unschool, but that did help me is the<br/>
Successful Homeschool Family Handbook. It has a lot of information and<br/>
advice, ideas, etc. It did help me not to worry so much about my son<br/>
&#39;falling behind,&#39; or &#39;not being on grade level,&#39; etc. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352333178">Thank you so very much. I think where my challenges come in is the fact that I can not get my son to want to do anything besides play video games or watch tv. Even getting him to go outside is a challenge. I guess I am afraid he will turn into one of those people whose whole life is games and tv. I have two nephews who are this way (they are both 8 and 9-they are public school children though,not that it makes a difference).They sit in their rooms and play games for hours and hours and they have been this way for months. I guess I do not want my child to be like that. Should I just leave my son alone and let him play video games and watch tv all the time? How can I get him to want to do something else? He is only  9 and I am not sure if it is healthy for him to zone out infront of a TV and video games all day. I know this may not seem like a big thing to the long time unschooling parents and probably sounds pretty silly, but I am still new and not sure<br/>
 if this is even natural. Confused!!<br/>

deschool.In fact I am not sure I ever gave him any time to deschool.  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not too late.<br/>
In fact, unschooling isn&#39;t going to work for you unless and until  <br/>
you&#39;ve gone through a deschooling time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also the fact that all he wants is video games and tv too which I  <br/>
am hoping will change soon. -=<br/>
<br/>
You need to stop hoping it will change before it can change.  This  <br/>
whole unschooling thing is tricky.  If he&#39;s reacting to what you  <br/>
want, he won&#39;t be making his own real choices.  If you&#39;re living by  <br/>
his actions and choices, you won&#39;t be making interesting choices  <br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
The general recommendation (which has stood since before I was  <br/>
unschooling) is deschooling takes a month for every month the person  <br/>
was in school.  All school counts.  School at home counts.  So don&#39;t  <br/>
expect recovery before one month per year.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am almost wondering if I need some deschooling time for myself  <br/>
too. :) -=-<br/>
<br/>
No wondering, no smiley, you do!!<br/>
<br/>
You went to school ten years or twelve maybe, I&#39;m guessing.  So your  <br/>
own feelings about school will need ten months OFF.  Not ten months  <br/>
of changing your mind every few weeks.  Ten solid months of  <br/>
consciously trying to live like it&#39;s summer vacation or a great  <br/>
Saturday (from when you were in school).  Only then will you start to  <br/>
get the clearheadedness to see learning.<br/>
<br/>
When you work out in the sun and go into a dark room, you can&#39;t see  <br/>
anything.   When people have been blinded by school and they turn  <br/>

Read all of it, all the links, maybe twice, and let your son play all  <br/>
the games he wants.  Leave him alone for hours.  Find some things  <br/>
you&#39;ve wished you had done--projects around the house, hobbies,  <br/>
movies you haven&#39;t seen for a long time or ever.  Start your own  <br/>
recovery and relax into the possibility that learning is everywhere  <br/>
and peace can be at your house bigtime.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really? He does absolutely nothing else at all?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Even getting him to go outside is a challenge.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He loves what he is doing and you&#39;re trying to make him do something  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t enjoy as much. &quot;Go outside&quot; doesn&#39;t sound like much fun to  <br/>
me, either. Go swimming might sound fun. Go to the park with friends  <br/>
might sound fun. Build a fort might sound fun. Draw with sidewalk  <br/>
chalk might sound fun (especially if we had one of those sprayers made  <br/>
for chalk). Taking karate or scuba diving or skiing lessons might be  <br/>
fun. My point is that your job as an unschooling parent is to offer  <br/>
enticing and interesting and fun experiences, not to try to make him  <br/>
&quot;go outside.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I guess I am afraid he will turn into one of those people whose whole  <br/>
life is games and tv.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter (17) is thinking about a career in television.  <br/>
She LOVES television shows - loves watching them over and over and  <br/>
loves reading about them and analyzing and talking about them. She  <br/>
works (teaches karate) and spends a lot of her earnings buying tv  <br/>
shows on dvd.  Loving television as much as she does, plus playing a  <br/>
lot of video games and role playing games like D&D, hasn&#39;t kept her  <br/>
from also doing lots of other things - she dances and plays soccer.  <br/>
She just had 6 soccer games in 3 days. She&#39;s got lots of friends -  <br/>
spent yesterday at Disneyland with a group of them. She reads a lot,  <br/>
too, and listens to a lot of music.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look at the tv/gaming as a &#39;problem&#39; that you have to pull him  <br/>
away from. It may seem paradoxical, but if you focus on supporting his  <br/>
tv and gaming interests and expanding on them and also offering lots  <br/>
of other options that you think he might enjoy, he will be more likely  <br/>
to take advantage of all those cool options you&#39;re offering.  If, on  <br/>
the other hand, you&#39;re focusing on pulling him away from what he loves  <br/>
(games and tv), you will create resistance and he&#39;ll be less likely to  <br/>
take you up on your offers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have two nephews who are this way (they are both 8 and 9-they are  <br/>
public school children though,not that it makes a difference).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Makes a world of difference. Are their parents actively and  <br/>
energetically supporting their interest in games?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They sit in their rooms and play games for hours and hours and they  <br/>
have been this way for months.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do their parents interact with them? Play the games a little - enough  <br/>
to be game-literate, at least? Have conversations about the games and  <br/>
how its going and what the player is working on and what do they think  <br/>
about the design of the game? Do their parents find interesting  <br/>
tidbits of information about the games to share with their kids? Do  <br/>
they look up who composed the music and find out what else that  <br/>
composer wrote. Find the music for the kid to play on a keyboard or  <br/>
other musical instrument that they might be interested in? Do they  <br/>
surprise their kids by putting their favorite game music all on a cd  <br/>
or on a playlist to be put on their iPods? Do the parents look around  <br/>
to see if there are any museums with special exhibits related to video  <br/>
games. Google &quot;video game museum&quot; and see what cool things there are  <br/>
there. Look at &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.videotopia.com/">http://www.videotopia.com/</a>&gt;. Do their parents notice  <br/>
when there are game conventions going on and plan family vacations  <br/>
around them? (Blizzcon 2008 was in October in Southern California a  <br/>
block away from Disneyland - that would have made a fantastic family  <br/>
vacation - information is not yet available about a possible Blizzcon  <br/>
2009.) Kid loves tv? Plan a family vacation to include tv-show  <br/>
tapings, a tour of a tv studio. We went to Manhattan in June and one  <br/>
of the things we did was visit locations that we knew because of  <br/>
favorite tv shows. You can find pre-designed tours online or even take  <br/>
specialized bus tours based on specific tv shows. There are two  <br/>
Museums of Television and Radio - one in Los Angeles and on in New  <br/>
York City - they are really amazing places where we&#39;ve spent many  <br/>
happy hours.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I guess I do not want my child to be like that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you be like their parents, then.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Should I just leave my son alone and let him play video games and  <br/>
watch tv all the time?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No. HELP him play what he wants and make it nicer for him. Take him  <br/>
food, help make him comfortable, buy him manuals, keep an eye out for  <br/>
sales on games or expansion packs. Get him good gaming equipment.Get a  <br/>
Wii and play the sports games and Rock Band and others of the new  <br/>
games that are more active and fun for the whole family. Also, notice  <br/>
what kinds of video games he likes to play. Are they strategic  <br/>
thinking games or more physical dexterity types of games? Use that as  <br/>
a guide to other things he might enjoy. If it is the strategic  <br/>
thinking he likes, then get other strategy games like Blockus or  <br/>
Othello or Pente to play as a family. If it is more shoot &#39;em up  <br/>
games, take the family and some friends out to play laser tag. If the  <br/>
games he plays involve role-playing and he likes that, then maybe  <br/>
introduce him to D&D or other role-playing games - start a regular  <br/>
&quot;game day&quot; with a couple of friends.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; How can I get him to want to do something else? He is only  9 and I  <br/>
am not sure if it is healthy for him to zone out infront of a TV and  <br/>
video games all day. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t insult him, even in your own head. &quot;Zone out&quot; is condescending  <br/>
and degrading. He&#39;s actively playing or watching something. Why? What  <br/>
does he love about it? How can you enhance his enjoyment of it?  <br/>
Remember your job as an unschooling parent is to support his interests  <br/>
and bring the world to him and him to the world. Are you doing your  <br/>
part?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know this may not seem like a big thing to the long time  <br/>
unschooling parents and probably sounds pretty silly, but I am still  <br/>
new and not sure if this is even natural. Confused!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hope this post helps shake up your thinking a little.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is this, because I was raised a certain way and so was my husband I<br/>
&gt; feel like I am not doing my part by forcing paper work on him or<br/>
&gt; making him do tests and such. I am having a hard time getting this<br/>
&gt; structured way of schooling (that I did not like myself growing up)<br/>
&gt; out of my system. I feel that if I do not have paper work for him to<br/>
&gt; do, tests for him to take, or a ton of reading to do, that I am not<br/>
&gt; doing a good job and therefore he will not learn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you read any John Holt books?  How Children Fail, is a really good<br/>
book to read because it clearly describes how children do and don&#39;t<br/>
learn and why.  I think it will help you see how pushing paper work and<br/>
making him do tests, isn&#39;t really going to get the results you want.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is everywhere.  You are learning right now in each and every<br/>
moment and it&#39;s no different for kids, except they seem to be bigger<br/>
sponges soaking up more at a single time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I already know that all this stuff is not working for him.There are<br/>
&gt; endless tears, frustration and anger on both our parts and I do not<br/>
&gt; want this.Also I have family breathing down my neck because they feel<br/>
&gt; that since I am not a teacher I am not qualified and that he will be<br/>
&gt; behind on things that they would be teaching him in a public school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Teachers learn classroom management more than any other thing when they<br/>
get their degrees.  They learn child psychology and ages and stages and<br/>
various methods of teaching.  Most of that stuff doesn&#39;t apply in a one<br/>
on one situation like what happens in homeschooling.  Teaching and<br/>
teaching degrees are part of a self perpetuating system that feeds upon<br/>
itself.  It doesn&#39;t care much if it&#39;s working, it only cares that it<br/>
gets enough satisfactory students to get funding for the next year.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in school and the teaching industry is about &quot;real&quot; learning, or<br/>
what works for &quot;real&quot; kids in the &quot;real&quot; world.  It&#39;s a system that<br/>
wants a bottom line mediocre level of knowledge, to justify the tax<br/>
expenditures and the need for it&#39;s own existence.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; There are days when all my son wants to do is watch TV or play video<br/>
&gt; games.I guess I shouldn&#39;t complain to much cause he likes to watch<br/>
&gt; Animal Planet, Food Network or the History Channel a lot. But again, I<br/>
&gt; was raised to think that too much tv can cause a child to fail and is<br/>
&gt; not good, and I feel terrible for letting him sometimes.I feel as if I<br/>
&gt; should restrict him some.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even if your were raised to think or believe a certain way, doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
you can&#39;t change that thinking or that belief.  People really do learn<br/>
all the time.  Don&#39;t stay stuck in old thinking or old beliefs,<br/>
especially if they aren&#39;t working.  Really ask yourself how your<br/>
children are going to fail by watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
What is it they will fail at?  What would cause your children to fail? <br/>
How do you measure failure?  Those ideas of success and failure within<br/>
education are created by the idea that you have to succeed, get good<br/>
grades, but if everyone can&#39;t succeed in that environment, it inherently<br/>
creates failures.  Unschooling works within a different dichotomy, one<br/>
in which everyone succeeds to their own standards because they are doing<br/>
what they want to do for their individual needs.<br/>
<br/>
There is learning in video games and TV, you just have to SEE it.  You<br/>
won&#39;t be able to see it if you are measuring everything with school<br/>
eyes.  Remember schools don&#39;t necessarily care about learning, they<br/>
really care more about teaching and passing tests, which isn&#39;t a real<br/>
measure of learning.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122918842">Even in that long post I just wrote, I left out something important.<br/>
<br/>
Respect and honor your child&#39;s interest by giving them the space and  <br/>
time to enjoy and pursue it without unwanted interruptions. Long hours  <br/>
of uninterrupted play time or viewing time are one of the gifts we can  <br/>
give our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Some people find that their kids become miserable and cranky or  <br/>
aggressive when they spend a long time playing video games or watching  <br/>
television. I think this is often due to not eating enough, but also  <br/>
could be that those young bodies need more activity. Solve the first  <br/>
problem by keeping them fed - put plates of easy-to-nibble-at foods  <br/>
nearby - crackers and cheese and sliced apples or grapes or pieces of  <br/>
leftover turkey. Get insulated coffee cups with lids and put chicken  <br/>
or veggie broth in them so they can sip at it and it stays hot. Also,  <br/>
make sure the game is physically comfortable - watch him play and see  <br/>
if things need to be moved around. Does he need a better chair? Higher  <br/>
or lower screen? Lighting changed so it isn&#39;t reflecting in the  <br/>
screen? Better speakers? Also, if playing computer games, is the  <br/>
computer fast enough for the game? It can be really frustrating to try  <br/>
to play a game on a computer that isn&#39;t really quite adequate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little concerned that my long list of examples of how you can  <br/>
support and expand and build on video game and tv interests could make  <br/>
some people think that they should constantly barrage their child with  <br/>
other things to do. Be sensitive and be aware of whether your offering  <br/>
ideas is welcome and whether it seems be well accepted. You&#39;ll build  <br/>
credibility as your offerings are discovered to be worthwhile.<br/>

I need all the help and encouragement that I can get and I thank all of you for this.My family is gonna start deschooling together, including my husband and I. We all need this. I have read about deschooling the child but never the parent and I guess until the parent is deschooled then they can not fully deschool the child. I did not realize how much my family needed this process until you pointed it out. Thanks! I guess what it really comes down to is that I keep trying to please everyone else, as impossible and pointless as it is. To show them that I will not fail at teaching my children like they expect me to, and that I can raise geniuses (or so they think I should) , when really what I need to be doing is pleasing my children and husband and caring less what others think.<br/>

-=-Thanks. I guess I never really gave my son enough time to <br/>
deschool.In fact I am not sure I ever gave him any time to deschool. <br/>
I think that might of contributed to my feeling of loss.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not too late.<br/>
In fact, unschooling isn&#39;t going to work for you unless and until <br/>
you&#39;ve gone through a deschooling time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also the fact that all he wants is video games and tv too which I <br/>
am hoping will change soon. -=<br/>
<br/>
You need to stop hoping it will change before it can change.  This <br/>
whole unschooling thing is tricky.  If he&#39;s reacting to what you <br/>
want, he won&#39;t be making his own real choices.  If you&#39;re living by <br/>
his actions and choices, you won&#39;t be making interesting choices <br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
The general recommendation (which has stood since before I was <br/>
unschooling) is deschooling takes a month for every month the person <br/>
was in school.  All school counts.  School at home counts.  So don&#39;t <br/>
expect recovery before one month per year.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am almost wondering if I need some deschooling time for myself <br/>
too. :) -=-<br/>
<br/>
No wondering, no smiley, you do!!<br/>
<br/>
You went to school ten years or twelve maybe, I&#39;m guessing.  So your <br/>
own feelings about school will need ten months OFF.  Not ten months <br/>
of changing your mind every few weeks.  Ten solid months of <br/>
consciously trying to live like it&#39;s summer vacation or a great <br/>
Saturday (from when you were in school).  Only then will you start to <br/>
get the clearheadedness to see learning.<br/>
<br/>
When you work out in the sun and go into a dark room, you can&#39;t see <br/>
anything.   When people have been blinded by school and they turn <br/>
toward natural learning, they can&#39;t see anything at first.  They only <br/>
see the &quot;not schoolness&quot; and it seems like all kinds of dark, bad <br/>

schooled child playing for other reasons in addition to fun may look  <br/>
the same on the surface, but beneath there&#39;s more going on.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a big difference between doing something to escape and doing  <br/>
something because you enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
I watched a lot of TV when I was a kid. And I usually had my nose in  <br/>
a book. Often at the same time! While I enjoyed doing both of those,  <br/>
the length I went to was caused by school. (Now, I don&#39;t watch nearly  <br/>
as much TV as I&#39;d like! Just too many more interesting things to do.)<br/>
<br/>
Several unschoolers have commented that they loved to immerse  <br/>
themselves in a book as kids too and expected their kids might be the  <br/>
same but it doesn&#39;t seem as prevalent among unschooling kids. Not  <br/>
that there aren&#39;t unschooling kids who love to read, but there aren&#39;t  <br/>
unschooling kids who need to use a love of reading to escape for a  <br/>
while from their lives.<br/>
<br/>
The gaming will continue as long as the games are fascinating *and*  <br/>
until your son feels he can set it down and can pick it back up  <br/>
anytime he wants. But he won&#39;t have that other layer of needing to  <br/>
decompress and escape from school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should I just leave my son alone and let him play video games and  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and no. Give him space to enjoy. But do pay attention to him! :-)  <br/>
Bring him food. Play with him so you&#39;re up on the games yourself and  <br/>
can hold up your end of the conversation. Become aware of when he  <br/>
needs you to be vacation director with new and exciting offerings and  <br/>
when to back off and let him freely explore.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can I get him to want to do something else?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were engrossed in a book, how could your husband get you to  <br/>
want to do something else? Would you appreciate him hovering,  <br/>
wondering when you&#39;d move on? What would it do to the atmosphere in  <br/>
the house if you knew he was fretting over how you were spending your  <br/>
leisure time and that he was judging it as not up to his standards of  <br/>
good uses of time?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He is only 9 and I am not sure if it is healthy for him to zone out  <br/>
&gt; infront of a TV and video games all day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s not zoning. He&#39;s engrossed.<br/>
<br/>
If he *is* zoning, it isn&#39;t the TV and games that&#39;s causing it. It&#39;s  <br/>
a response to something in his world. Schooled kids zone out from  <br/>
school. Working adults zone out from work. TV is just their choice of  <br/>
medication for what ails them. Take away what ails them and the  <br/>
zoning will eventually go away when they&#39;re recovered.<br/>

<br/>
I used books to escape emotionally and mentally, and also  <br/>
physically.  Because reading was &quot;good,&quot; I got out of errands and  <br/>
chores and &quot;help me for a minute&quot; if I was reading and my sister or  <br/>
cousins were doing something less glorified.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was playing Putt Putt Joins the Circus or one of those  <br/>
yesterday.  I found a little stash of old computer games the kids had  <br/>
asked me not to give away once when I was giving a bunch of stuff  <br/>
away.   The last time she played these games she couldn&#39;t read.  Now  <br/>
she&#39;s seeing them in a whole new way, and she&#39;s going into the  <br/>
&quot;teacher&quot; parts where it keeps track of the skills you&#39;re learning  <br/>
(I&#39;m mixing this up with Third Grade Adventure; that&#39;s the one with  <br/>
the teacher section.)<br/>
<br/>
Some of the animation is really pretty.  It&#39;s like being in a cartoon  <br/>
one can affect and explore.  Other characters react.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile Marty is playing Fallout 3, which is like a mystery movie  <br/>
one can affect and explore.  I read lots of mysteries as a kid, but  <br/>
they turn out the same way no matter who&#39;s reading it or how.<br/>

have valued in books, and then some.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh my goodness you are soooo right! I love to read and when I feel I am being rushed, hovered over or even that it might be taken away I start to get aggravated. HAHA I could spend countless hours in the library just browsing and when I feel my husband is rushing and ready to go I do get irritated because being there surrounded by those books soothes me. The same applies to my son&#39;s games and the way you phrased it makes sense to me. <br/>
<br/>
About my nephews with games after public schooling, I didn&#39;t even think of this being their way of recovering for the day after all that boring mind numbing paper work. It makes sense! I use to read when I got home from school. You could not pull me away from a book, the funny thing about it though was I did not like to read the books that was assigned to me to read for class and therefore I would fail whatever tests was given on the book. It wasn&#39;t that I did not enjoy reading I just did not want to read what they wanted me to. And so when I got home I would spend countless hours reading whatever I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
No one ever mentions too much reading is bad even if you fail your reading and language arts class HAHA! <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for pointing that out to me. When you associate my love for reading with his love for games it really does make a ton of sense to me :)<br/>

<br/>
Heavens, yes, it makes a difference! Not only are the schooled kids <br/>
doing something they enjoy, but they&#39;re catching up from the hours <br/>
they couldn&#39;t play *and* they&#39;re using it to de-pressurize from <br/>
school. The actions of an unschooling child playing for fun and a <br/>
schooled child playing for other reasons in addition to fun may look <br/>
the same on the surface, but beneath there&#39;s more going on.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; They sit in their rooms and play games for hours and hours and they <br/>
&gt; have been this way for months. I guess I do not want my child to be <br/>
&gt; like that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big difference between doing something to escape and doing <br/>
something because you enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
I watched a lot of TV when I was a kid. And I usually had my nose in <br/>
a book. Often at the same time! While I enjoyed doing both of those, <br/>
the length I went to was caused by school. (Now, I don&#39;t watch nearly <br/>
as much TV as I&#39;d like! Just too many more interesting things to do.)<br/>
<br/>
Several unschoolers have commented that they loved to immerse <br/>
themselves in a book as kids too and expected their kids might be the <br/>
same but it doesn&#39;t seem as prevalent among unschooling kids. Not <br/>
that there aren&#39;t unschooling kids who love to read, but there aren&#39;t <br/>
unschooling kids who need to use a love of reading to escape for a <br/>
while from their lives.<br/>
<br/>
The gaming will continue as long as the games are fascinating *and* <br/>
until your son feels he can set it down and can pick it back up <br/>
anytime he wants. But he won&#39;t have that other layer of needing to <br/>
decompress and escape from school.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Should I just leave my son alone and let him play video games and <br/>
&gt; watch tv all the time?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes and no. Give him space to enjoy. But do pay attention to him! :-) <br/>
Bring him food. Play with him so you&#39;re up on the games yourself and <br/>
can hold up your end of the conversation. Become aware of when he <br/>
needs you to be vacation director with new and exciting offerings and <br/>
when to back off and let him freely explore.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How can I get him to want to do something else?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you were engrossed in a book, how could your husband get you to <br/>
want to do something else? Would you appreciate him hovering, <br/>
wondering when you&#39;d move on? What would it do to the atmosphere in <br/>
the house if you knew he was fretting over how you were spending your <br/>
leisure time and that he was judging it as not up to his standards of <br/>
good uses of time?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; He is only 9 and I am not sure if it is healthy for him to zone out <br/>
&gt; infront of a TV and video games all day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not zoning. He&#39;s engrossed.<br/>
<br/>
If he *is* zoning, it isn&#39;t the TV and games that&#39;s causing it. It&#39;s <br/>
a response to something in his world. Schooled kids zone out from <br/>
school. Working adults zone out from work. TV is just their choice of <br/>
medication for what ails them. Take away what ails them and the <br/>
zoning will eventually go away when they&#39;re recovered.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son went to school for two years. He was okay in his kindergarten <br/>
year although he didn&#39;t exactly enjoy it. Then the following year he <br/>
became noticeably unhappy and was becoming progressively unhappier. <br/>
<br/>
He has a ten years older sister - now a university graduate - who had <br/>
always excelled at school. The year he started school, she was Dux of <br/>
the Year at her high school. She graduated from high school the <br/>
following year in the top 1% in the state.<br/>
<br/>
So, when our son reached the stage of not wanting to go to school, it <br/>
was very difficult for my wife and I not to believe that helping him <br/>
adapt to school culture was the right way to go. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what we worked on initially and, unfortunately, it only made <br/>
things worse.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d always been as involved as possible with both of my children&#39;s <br/>
schooling and at the time I was already inside my son&#39;s school nearly <br/>
every day. I attended virtually every morning assembly, I was also a <br/>
parent helper in the school&#39;s remedial reading program (though they <br/>
didn&#39;t call it that - non-PC apparently) two mornings a week, and I <br/>
was also helping out occasionally in the canteen and with classroom <br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
Observing the teaching in the classroom was like watching paint dry. <br/>
That was a major factor in my wife and I ultimately deciding to take <br/>
our son out of school and to homeschool him. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, our primary concern was for our son to be happy, whatever <br/>
the solution needed to be, but, thinking at the time in terms of how <br/>
he would be educated, we could see that it made no sense for him to <br/>
be in a school classroom all day if he was unhappy with that when he <br/>
could clearly do more in less time at home. So I suppose it could be <br/>
said that a desire for &#39;educational efficiency&#39; was one of the <br/>
reasons that led us to try homeschooling as a remedy for our son&#39;s <br/>
unhappiness.<br/>
<br/>
The homeschooling was three hours a day, based on subjects not a <br/>
curriculum and very informal, no having to sit at a table or anything <br/>
like that. Very much &quot;guide on the side&quot;, but still working to a set <br/>
timetable. That lasted about two weeks. My son hated it and didn&#39;t <br/>
want to do it. If he didn&#39;t want to do it, neither did I. My wife and <br/>
I were not going to exchange one unhappy situation for another, so we <br/>
gave our son the year off to do what he liked. What he liked was <br/>
videogaming, watching TV and surfing the internet. <br/>
<br/>
Our thinking was, well, he&#39;s only seven, there&#39;s plenty of time for <br/>
him to catch up with anything if he needs to, we&#39;ll resume the formal <br/>
education next year.<br/>
<br/>
We never did. Our son&#39;s lifestyle is much the same today, six years <br/>
later. <br/>
<br/>
And, while it&#39;s true that he can&#39;t recite the months of the year in <br/>
order, that&#39;s something he can memorise in half an hour if he ever <br/>
needs to (otherwise just look at a calendar!), and &#39;gaps&#39; like that <br/>
are more than compensated for by what he does know. What he knows - <br/>
and understands - about the world he lives in and his culture and how <br/>
society works is way, way, way ahead of what I knew when I was his <br/>
age.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so envious of that boy sometimes. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and he&#39;s never been left alone in his interests. Not that I&#39;m <br/>
involved all the time by any means, but our days together usually <br/>
include some playing videogames together, watching TV together, <br/>
googling, you tubing, having interesting conversations. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re both always learning in fact. <br/>
<br/>
And it doesn&#39;t bother me in the least that I&#39;m an avid reader and <br/>
always in the process of reading at least a couple of books at a time <br/>
(ebooks mainly these days) while he won&#39;t even touch one.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s in a whole new world of &#39;education&#39;. And the indications are <br/>
that it&#39;s becoming increasingly superior to the old one I grew up <br/>
in. <br/>

There&#39;s a CD called &quot;Sounds Like Fun&quot; from Discovery Toys that has a  <br/>

Holly&#39;s not happy with her handwriting.  She&#39;s been practicing  <br/>
lately, rows of letters.  She showed me a set one day and said I  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t tell her what I didn&#39;t like because she knew some were bad,  <br/>
but she asked me which were my favorites.  She has a job in a shop,  <br/>
and there&#39;s not much writing but a little bit.  Someone she works  <br/>
with has worse writing than she has and that made her feel less  <br/>
totally-off-the-charts.  Then we were choosing board games to take to  <br/>
a Thanksgiving get-together, and I suggested we take some that didn&#39;t  <br/>
involve a lot of reading because one of our friends doesn&#39;t read  <br/>
really well and is self conscious about it.  She said &quot;Why didn&#39;t you  <br/>
introduce me to him a long time ago!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s known him her whole life.  He&#39;s beloved of everyone who knows  <br/>
him--he&#39;s never had half an enemy, and he&#39;s successful and competent  <br/>
and good looking and has lived with the same woman for 20 years.   <br/>
Holly didn&#39;t know someone like that, in his 40&#39;s, could have a lack  <br/>
like that.  Again, she felt better.  And having been linguistically  <br/>
competent but not a fluent reader when she was old enough to be  <br/>
analytical about it, she was able to choose a couple of games easily.<br/>

<br/>
Me too!  When they said &quot;Write your name here,&quot; I did.  My granny and  <br/>
mom had helped me learn to write my name.  Both of them had really  <br/>
pretty handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
When I first went to school I couldn&#39;t read, and I learned exactly as  <br/>
the teacher was teaching us, because I was ready.  There weren&#39;t many  <br/>
books at my house and my mom was impatient and really liked my little  <br/>
sister and spent a lot of time with her.  So when I got to school and  <br/>
saw easy books, and had some phonics lessons and some encouragement,  <br/>
I could read.  They &quot;taught me&quot; or I learned easily, but mostly I  <br/>
needed clues and resources.<br/>
<br/>
But the teacher told my mom she should not have taught me to write my  <br/>
name, because it was disruptive and the school wanted to teach me  <br/>
their way.<br/>
<br/>
The next year, when I was in second grade, my maternal grandfather  <br/>
(Papaw, but they were both Papaw) taught me to add columns of  <br/>
numbers, and how to carry into the tens.  It was fun!  It was cool.   <br/>
He was glad to teach me, because he had gone to school less than two  <br/>
years, as a kid in &quot;the aughts&quot; (1906 or so probably; he was born in  <br/>
1898, give or take a year).  So when we were still adding  <br/>
horizontally in school instead of stacking numbers up, I knew what  <br/>
was coming in math.  I liked it, but the teacher didn&#39;t like it as  <br/>
much, because it meant I was bored and impatient.<br/>
<br/>
I was bored and impatient in school for 11 years before I went to the  <br/>
university and wasn&#39;t so bored or impatient because the material was  <br/>
new and the pace was fast.   Because I got good grades, though, I  <br/>
wasn&#39;t punished much for it.  I had friends who were bored and  <br/>
impatient and refused to do monkey tricks to make good grades.  They  <br/>
were in trouble.    They were called hyperactive and academically  <br/>
behind,  and I was called gifted and understimulated.<br/>
<br/>
All of those experiences and all of that knowledge just made it  <br/>
easier for me to parent and unschool confidently.  The damage of the  <br/>
labelling and the hoop-jumping and the schedule-following make  <br/>
learning more difficult, and I found it easy to make choices that  <br/>
make learning easier.  It&#39;s as thought the darkness of other people&#39;s  <br/>
bad choices and experiences just lit up the path that avoided them  <br/>
all, and I&#39;ve been trying to keep the path lit for other people who  <br/>
hadn&#39;t been so analytical  about their own school experiences, or who  <br/>
hadn&#39;t seen enough negativity to know what to avoid, or who  had seen  <br/>
nothing BUT negativity and had no idea that there might be alternatives.<br/>
