<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007445361">On another list, Walmart shopping has become a topic of brutal<br/>
parenting. As you all have probably seen, parents at Walmart are often<br/>
frazzeled, hurried and stressed. Apparently a homeschool mom SAW a <br/>
two year old being hit by a man with A BELT at Walmart, tried to stop <br/>
him and was threatened with arrest by a Walmart security officer.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to develop a plan for bringing this to public scrutiny. I <br/>
am going to write a message to Michael Moore. If Michael Moore can<br/>
get bullets out of Kmart. We can get violence out of Walmart.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for non-violent advocacy for children? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Pat</div>
