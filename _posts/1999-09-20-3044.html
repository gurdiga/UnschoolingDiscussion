&lt;tie it up somewhere between 12:00 - 1:00 AM depending. &gt; & &lt;Though I sense <br/>
tension between hubby and I on the horizon.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
as i was reading your schedule with the laaaate nights i wondered about the <br/>
spousal agreeableness, then later you mentioned it!  i guess it is on my mind <br/>
because i often stay up late (like now) just to get some solitude after a <br/>
long day with the four children.  but hubby wishes i would snuggle in with <br/>

WOW, Can I relate to this!  Just want you to know that it is now 1:57 a.m. as <br/>
I sit here reading my mail before I actually go back to my transcription <br/>
work, which must be done by tomorrow morning.  My husband sometimes gets <br/>
angry with me that I&#39;m up so late, but I can&#39;t figure how else to do it all!  <br/>
I have four children also, and it is very hard to work with them around me, <br/>
not to mention the fact that I&#39;m supposed to be spending my days educating <br/>
them.  But what really gets to my husband is the fact that sometimes my boys <br/>
won&#39;t go to bed until I do.  Even now, my 12 and 13 year old are awake <br/>
downstairs.  God help them if they make any noise.  But it seems reasonable <br/>
that they would stay up late and wake up later like I do, since I&#39;m the one <br/>
they spend all their time with.  Oh well.<br/>

one needs me.  That hardly ever happens.  Even at night the four yr old  is in<br/>

My dh is happy to go to bed if I&#39;ll wake him up (Ahem) when I come to bed.  I<br/>
usually would just like to decompress when I get in bed.  But, life in a family is<br/>
compromise, so sometimes I wake him up, sometimes I decompress......<br/>
I keep trying to remind myself the 4  yr. old won&#39;t be in my bed forever, and that<br/>
soon no one will want to be in my bed with us.  So, I&#39;m trying to see the good<br/>
side of it.  Sometimes I don&#39;t succeed to well, but I try.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think this is just a problem for unschoolers.  I think this is <br/>
basically a problem with many relationships when a computer is involved and <br/>
being online.  It was an issue with my ex because he wanted me be there while <br/>
he was sleeping.  It&#39;s not an issue now with boyfriend because he understands <br/>
that late at nights, after the kids go to bed and he has gone to bed too, <br/>
that this is my time, me time.  Late at night is the only time of the day <br/>
that I can sit at the computer undisturbed.  He realizes this is my time to <br/>
unwind and since I am hard of hearing, this is my preferred way of <br/>
communication.  I don&#39;t struggle to hear here like I do in the physical <br/>
world.  I don&#39;t always stay up late though.  About 2 or 3 nights a week I go <br/>
to bed early with him to catch up on my sleep because my boys are early <br/>
risers.  My boyfriend is very understanding,  I know I am lucky after what I <br/>
went through with my ex.  I think this is an issue with most relationships <br/>
when a computer comes into the family.  I&#39;ve noticed that one adult in the <br/>
family usually takes to it more than the other.  <br/>

My guys are the same way.  I don&#39;t go to bed till sometimes 2 or am, the boys <br/>
are always up till midnight or later, even if I start them to bed at 10pm, <br/>
they still find ways of staying up.  My dh gets angry sometimes cause he says <br/>
they need to learn to get up in the morning.  I tell him that they do get up <br/>
when they have to, but why on earth make them go to bed, and get up at a <br/>
certain time.  The only reason people put their kids to bed early is to <br/>
either get them out of the way for some quiet time (which I need)! or because <br/>
they must get up early the next Day.  I mean, that&#39;s the only reason adults <br/>
go to bed at a certain time,  if they don&#39;t have to get up early, they stay <br/>
up late.  I have always been a night person, so I guess the boys come by it <br/>
honestly.  But SOME nights I just want everyone to go to bed so I can have a <br/>
minute for me!  LOL<br/>

I think that you are right about problems with a partner being on line, I <br/>
never go on line if my dh is awake.  If he is up, I try to be in the same <br/>
room with him, even if he is watching tv that I don&#39;t like.  My thing has <br/>
always been, even before the puter, that I was going to have my time sometime <br/>
during the day, whether at night or during the day.  I usually knit or read, <br/>
or get involved in an old movie, but it is what I want to do without having <br/>
to do  for anybody.  Now, on the nights that my dh wants some special alone <br/>
time, he just tells me to come on to bed, other nights he just says good <br/>
night,  I go in and snuggle with him a few minutes and then I go back to what <br/>
I was doing.  We both communicate what we need from each other and don&#39;t <br/>
begrudge the other what that is, computer time, reading time or snuggling <br/>
time!  LOL  Anyway, in our situation this is how we have worked things out <br/>
for a better understanding of each other.<br/>

I can&#39;t imagine that you&#39;re going to be able to change everyone&#39;s <br/>
bedtime with kids as old as yours.  Is it the noise that&#39;s bothering <br/>
your husband,  or does he just resent the fact that he has to go to <br/>
bed early so that he can get up early?  Would something like ear <br/>
plugs or a white noise machine help?  How about some relaxing music.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394955008"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I go through the same thing.  After each day, I&#39;m worn out from<br/>
&gt; the neediness,  and just want some time when I don&#39;t have to be<br/>
&gt; responsible for anyone, and no one needs me.  That hardly ever happens.<br/>
&gt;  Even at night the four yr old  is in  our bed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It gets much easier as they get older.  For one thing, their immediate<br/>
needs are somewhat less, and for another, they can stay up later than you<br/>
with no problems.<br/>
<br/>
We have an unusual schedule here.  It varies, but for a while, we&#39;ve been<br/>
going to bed at about 3am or so.  Sometimes I get to bed a bit earlier,<br/>
sometimes my dh stays up a bit longer, but the kids have been going to bed<br/>
somewhere between 2:30 and 3am for a couple of months now.<br/>
<br/>
I get up about 10am, the kids get up between noon and 1, so I get the<br/>
morning to myself.  It&#39;s kind of nice.  I spent quite a few years not<br/>
getting any time alone, so this has been a treat for me in some ways.<br/>
<br/>
If my dh and I want time alone and the kids are awake, we simply go into<br/>
our room and lock the door- again, this is something that is possible once<br/>
your kids get older.  The kids know they can knock if they really need us,<br/>
but in general, they leave us alone.  We tend to get our time alone<br/>
somewhere in the night, or in the middle of the afternoon when the kids are<br/>
all busy with something.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, it&#39;s unusual, and probably wouldn&#39;t work for everyone, but<br/>
it&#39;s working well for us right now.  My dh works at home, so getting up<br/>
early to go to work isn&#39;t an issue.  We don&#39;t worry about the kids learning<br/>
to get up early, because we live a life where it isn&#39;t necessary, and<br/>
believe it&#39;s fairly likely that they will also be able to do that, if they<br/>
want to.<br/>
<br/>
It will be interesting to see what happens with our schedules as it gets<br/>
dark earlier.  Will people want to start getting up earlier in order to do<br/>
things in the light?  I expect so.<br/>

&lt;&lt; right now! My 6yo doesn&#39;t go to<br/>
 bed until after 10:00 almost every night. Then, by the time I get to use<br/>
 the computer (DH is on until 11), and log in our days highlights and read<br/>
 mail, it is midnight. ...But my husband is not happy either. Is this a<br/>
 common problem for home/unschoolers, when mom&#39;s time comes last at the end<br/>
 of the day? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Olivia,<br/>
      It sure is in our house.  My husband has to be in bed by 9:30, since he <br/>
gets up at 4:30.  He usually goes on to bed and leaves it up to me to get the <br/>
kids in bed.  I let them all eat a snack around 9:00, then I send them up to <br/>
their room.  They are all allowed to read a book or play a quiet game.  The 7 <br/>
yr. old and 11 yr old like to sit and talk, so sometimes I have to go up a <br/>
few times and tell them to be quiet.  The 13 yr. old and 17 yr old go to <br/>
their separate bedrooms and read, so they are pretty quiet and aren&#39;t any <br/>
trouble.  I usually do some last minute clean up and errands for awhile, then <br/>
I log on to the computer about 12:00 midnight.  I think we are all being very <br/>
quiet (the master bedroom is on the first floor, while all the other bedrooms <br/>
are upstairs.  The computer is in a nook off the kitchen, so he can&#39;t hear <br/>
any noise from it), however lately he has been screaming and yelling at all <br/>
of us.  He starts doing this around 9:00, and by the time he goes to bed, he <br/>
has himself all worked up!  We are really having struggles with this.  My <br/>
husband has always been laid back and calm, until he started this about a <br/>
year ago.  We have tried going to bed earlier, and getting up earlier, but he <br/>
still yells alot.  The kids and I are NOT morning people and it is very hard <br/>
on us to go to sleep at 9:00.  I have had many heartfelt talks with my <br/>
husband about this, and I am at my wits end.  I just don&#39;t know what else to <br/>
do.  So I know what you are saying, since I am having the exact same problem. <br/>
 I would love to get some good suggestions, since I don&#39;t know what else to <br/>
try and I am really getting desperate.  This is putting a burden on our <br/>
marriage!  Help!<br/>

&lt;&lt; My guys are the same way.  I don&#39;t go to bed till sometimes 2 or am, the <br/>
boys <br/>
 are always up till midnight or later, even if I start them to bed at 10pm, <br/>
 they still find ways of staying up.  My dh gets angry sometimes cause he <br/>
says <br/>
 they need to learn to get up in the morning.  I tell him that they do get up <br/>
 when they have to, but why on earth make them go to bed, and get up at a <br/>

     This is the same complaint that I get from my husband.  When I tell him <br/>
that we do get up early, when we have to, but why should I have them get up <br/>
early if we don&#39;t, he says &quot;Because I have to get up early!!&quot;.  We have <br/>
disagreed about this since we got married over 19 years ago.  My husband is a <br/>
morning person, and he starts nodding off around 9:00 pm.  I am a night <br/>
person (and always have been).  I like to stay up to 2:00 am and get up at <br/>
around 10:00 or 11:00 am.  My husband knew I was like this when he married <br/>
me, but now he is getting angry, because I let the kids do the same thing.  <br/>
He thinks I am &quot;ruining&quot; them.  He also says that what we are doing is wrong <br/>
and that the &quot;real world&quot; doesn&#39;t go by that schedule, so I shouldn&#39;t allow <br/>
our kids to.  I have reminded him that I have always been that way, but he <br/>
just says that now that I have &quot;grown up&quot; its time that I change that.  He <br/>
really seems to think that sleeping late and staying up late are like really, <br/>
really big sins or something!  Aaargh!<br/>
Here lately he and I just don&#39;t seem to be communicating on the same <br/>
wavelength at all!  He sure doesn&#39;t understand the sleeping thing, and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t get the &quot;unschooling&quot; thing at all!  I feel like he is driving me <br/>
crazy!  And yet he can be a very wonderful father and husband, so this is <br/>
really frustrating!  I am about at the end of my rope!<br/>

     Sounds great!  Unfortunately my husband likes going to bed early and <br/>
getting up early, and he thinks we should all do as he does.  I think it is <br/>

I have to empathize with you, my dh is a morning person too, however, for <br/>
some reason, mainly I think , because things are starting to go better in our <br/>
business, he can be more relaxed.  When he gave me the real world thing, I <br/>
told him that this world is going to 24 hr jobs, work at home, work on the <br/>
net, work in hospitals, I worked evenings so I cold do what I wanted at night <br/>
and sleep late,   The unschooling thing, I don&#39;t even go there, we do <br/>
&quot;relaxed&quot;  the older the boys get, the more he sees what they are learning .  <br/>
I hope things work out for your family and I am sure you will get lots of <br/>
good responses on the list.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t imagine that you&#39;re going to be able to change everyone&#39;s <br/>

 plugs or a white noise machine help?  How about some relaxing music.<br/>

      I do believe that some of it is resentfulness.  However, he has <br/>
stressed to me for years, that he thinks sleeping late is just pure laziness! <br/>
 He has always been a morning person (he gets up early on his days off too), <br/>
and he thinks staying up late is stupid (his very words).  Finally, I just <br/>
asked him if he thought this was a &quot;sin&quot; to stay up late and sleep late.  <br/>
After thinking about it for awhile, he said yes.  We got into a discussion <br/>
about it.  We talked about all the people that worked the night shift and <br/>
other things.  He just said that &quot;most&quot; people aren&#39;t like that, and those <br/>
that work  during the night &quot;have to&quot; they don&#39;t have a choice.  He said that <br/>
people who chose to do so weren&#39;t &quot;normal&quot; people.  LOL  I had to laugh, but <br/>
at the same time, I am astounded at how he classifies people into those who <br/>
do it right, and those who don&#39;t.  He really believes that he is right and <br/>
that my idea (and anyone who agrees with me) is wrong.  I am starting to find <br/>
out that he has a narrow minded view on ALOT of issues, and I never even knew <br/>
it!!  (Either that or I was to Naive to notice before).  I have been married <br/>
to this man for 19 years, and didn&#39;t know he felt this way on so many issues. <br/>
 The problem is, we feel differently on ALOT of things!  LOL   Now what do I <br/>
do??  I sure wish we had discussed these things more fully years ago.  Now we <br/>
must find some way to compromise, respect each others feelings, and somehow <br/>
NOT force our views down the others throat and still get along!<br/>

It sounds like you may have to agree to disagree and move forward <br/>
from there.  You&#39;ve been married a long time as have I (21 years).<br/>
I&#39;m still learning things about my dh too.<br/>
<br/>
Your dh sounds like my mom.  She seems to feel like it&#39;s a sin to <br/>
sleep late - always has.  She also thinks you have to be busy doing <br/>
something every minute of the day.  I don&#39;t do this,  but I still <br/>
feel guilty when I sit - even to read a book.  Those things that are <br/>
ingrained in us from childhood are hard to let go of.  My mil is so <br/>
different and I think that has really helped.  She&#39;s very laid back - <br/>
sees nothing wrong with covering yourself with a blanket and watching <br/>
a little tv.  She really has time for her family.  My mom is always <br/>
busy proving to the world that&#39;s she&#39;s worthy.  She spends lots of <br/>
time on wonderful volunteer projects,  but very little time with <br/>
family, except for my dad.  She does a lot of good for the world and <br/>
I&#39;m proud of her for that,  but I think it comes with a price.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674673608">I have been following this thread with interest. I have a tendency toward<br/>
night owlishness. Here dh has to get up early  for work so we all go to bed<br/>
at 9pm.  Here is what we do: I get up early with dh every day and this is<br/>
when I get my computer time in, to check mail and whatnot. Dh has school 2<br/>
nights a week and doesn&#39;t get home until 9:30 so he stays up for an hour and<br/>
has his computer time. If he wants he can wake me up (I am asleep with the<br/>
kids) and we can have &#39;our&#39; time. Two other nights a week he does his<br/>
homework from his school and on those nights he goes to bed with the kids<br/>
and I stay up if I want to and many times he joins me. On Fridays (or<br/>
sometimes Saturdays) we get the kids to sleep, brew up some cappuccino and<br/>
stay up reallly late. We have some of &#39;our&#39; time and we also have a late<br/>
night online Bible study with some friends in the next state.  Then we sleep<br/>
in. &lt;g&gt; . Our kids are 7, 5, 4, 3, and 2 (she is the one who isn&#39;t really<br/>
ours, but we have her on Friday nights). The stay in our room and read books<br/>
and play quietly so we can rest a bit longer. It all works out pretty well.<br/>
(so far) but is subject to change as our schedules and needs change.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I would share what we do. It isn&#39;t the best solution but we<br/>
seem to be covering all the bases. We have to be creative when it comes to<br/>
private time and we try to communicate clearly and make note of our own<br/>
selfishness and not allow it to get in the way of our happiness.<br/>

I wish I had something helpful to suggest. Being a night person all my life<br/>
I have always felt at odds with the majority. During conversations with<br/>
your husband do you and he reach any agreement at all about the time issue?<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine getting up at 4:30 every day. I don&#39;t remember all your<br/>
former posts, but is he dissatisfied with his job? Sometimes people who<br/>
feel they are in a sinking ship want everybody to go down with them, so to<br/>
speak. I wonder what changed for him within the past year. Maybe he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to be on a separate schedule from the rest of the family, like he is<br/>
missing out on family time.  I don&#39;t know...just guesses and questions. My<br/>
husband had a midlife crisis last year and I didn&#39;t see it clearly in his<br/>
behavior until things came to a head. It sounds like there are other issues<br/>
affecting your husband&#39;s behavior. Hopefully someone wiser than me will<br/>
have some good suggestions.<br/>
