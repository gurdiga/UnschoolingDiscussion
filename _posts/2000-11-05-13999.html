<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631688908">Hi dear listmates-<br/>
I mostly just lurk on this list - as a very busy homebiz owner and mom to<br/>
two unschooled teens and one Waldorf schooled 10 year old - but the post of<br/>
Nancy K caught me eye. I wanted to humbly suggest homeopathy for your son.<br/>
It has worked wonders for our family in both the areas of illness and also<br/>
behaviorally with one son showing severe obsessive-complusive tendencies.<br/>
If you have access to a good homeopathic physician - do take the time to<br/>
schedule a visit and see if it can help your Thomas. <br/>
Sending support, Lee<br/>
