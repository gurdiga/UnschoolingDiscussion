You start with whats the most important to you. Make a<br/>
list and number  the items in order fo importance.<br/>
Start small and reward often. Post thoughts you want<br/>
to keep in your mind everywhere. Try to read different<br/>
philosophies and open your mind.<br/>

&gt; I am talking about Loosing weight - changing personality - eating<br/>
&gt; differently - feeling healthier - being what I want to be not what I<br/>
&gt; am.  Even though I am very happy........<br/>
&gt; And why do I want to change me?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to set short, medium, and long-range goals, then figure out what I<br/>
need to do to get to those goals. Goals need to be concrete things, that are<br/>
measurable. If you set a goal like &quot;eat healthier&quot;, it&#39;s really hard to know<br/>
if you&#39;re doing it, to know when you&#39;ve achieved your goal. A more<br/>
concrete goal would be &quot;Eat 5 fruits and vegetables a day&quot;. That&#39;s something<br/>
you can track in a notebook. Or &quot;Don&#39;t add any sugar to my tea, coffee, or<br/>
breakfast cereal&quot; or &quot;Substitute whole-grains for white flour in all my<br/>
cooking&quot;. If you break your goal of eating healthier into mini-goals like<br/>
this, and tackle one of them every 4 - 6 weeks (the amount of time it<br/>
generally takes to change a habit), you will slowly and surely improve your<br/>
eating habits over the course of several months. This is the same for any<br/>
nebulous over-all goal.<br/>
<br/>
Only you can answer the question of why you want to change, what, and how<br/>
much. If you can think of concrete things you want to be able to do, you can<br/>
tailor your goals towards accomplishing them. A health/fitness goal might be<br/>
to hike up to a local mountain or butte, or to do a 5k run, or to walk to<br/>
and from the grocery store every shopping day. Or it might be something<br/>
bigger and longer term like a walking trip of Europe or a major mountain<br/>
climb. I remember going through a goal-setting course a few years ago (back<br/>
when I was gainfully employed, and my employer paid for it), and I thought<br/>
&quot;what a bunch of hocus-pocus&quot;. But now that I&#39;m older, and my time is more<br/>
limited (so that I do need to decide which things I want to focus on in my<br/>
time), I&#39;ve found that having concrete goals out in front of me is very<br/>
helpful towards prioritizing my daily schedules, and changing my daily<br/>
plans and habits.<br/>
<br/>
If you have specific health/fitness/weight questions, about how to change,<br/>
etc. I&#39;d be glad to help answer any I can. Both my husband and I have been<br/>
trainers/coaches and competitive athletes. I spent the majority of my life<br/>
being overweight, out of shape, eating terribly and feeling worse. I was<br/>
told I was &quot;unathletic&quot; and &quot;uncoordinated&quot;. Then I met a really great coach<br/>
who changed my life. Since then, this &quot;unathletic&quot; and &quot;uncoordinated&quot; woman<br/>
has competed at a university and national level in several sports. I<br/>
strongly believe in the power of the human to change, grow, and overcome<br/>
anything.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a neat plan.  Splitting each goal into parts - eating 5 fruit a <br/>
day, and then cutting out sugar etc sounds far easier than doing the <br/>
whole thing at once - I know I have treid several times!!<br/>
<br/>
Before I had children I was 8 and half stone.  5 children later I am <br/>
13 stone - being an *older* mother also doesnt help.......<br/>
<br/>
So I can set goals within goals - but loosing weight isnt the only <br/>
gaol - or change.  How does a rather shy reserved person become more <br/>
out going!  AND how does one become a country girl again, when one <br/>
lives in town - and is likely to do so for a long time yet!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, this reminds me. I co-habitated with my British boyfriend for awhile<br/>
(many years ago), and I remember the first time I stepped onto his scale,<br/>
looked down and thought. &quot;OK, I&#39;m 10, but 10 what??? A perfect 10?&quot;  :-). I<br/>
had no idea what stone was. For those who don&#39;t know, I think it&#39;s about 14<br/>
pounds per stone, right??<br/>
AFA the weight goes, I hear you! I gained over 60 pounds with each pregnancy<br/>
(despite daily exercise and a good diet) so each time it has been a long,<br/>
hard effort to take it all back off. Again, I try to break it down into<br/>
little goals. One thing that worked well for me was that I would try to eat<br/>
healthy, be very active on a daily basis, and get regular exercise but I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t really focus on &quot;dieting&quot;, except for one week a month I would have<br/>
a &quot;get tough&quot; week, where I would really crack down on what I was eating,<br/>
and be very intense about exercise. I usually lost about 1.5 pounds that<br/>
week and 1 - 1.5 pounds the rest of the month, so I lost about 3 pounds a<br/>
month total but 75% of the time I didn&#39;t feel deprived :-).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, brainstorming here. How about going to certain activities - like a book<br/>
discussion group or a knitter&#39;s guild or something that interests you? Have<br/>
you heard of &quot;Toastmasters&quot;?? Here in the US (at least), it&#39;s a group that<br/>
helps reserved people learn to be more outgoing and get public speaking<br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;AND how does one become a country girl again, when one<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess that depends on whether or not there&#39;s anything rural near to you.<br/>
Can you take horseback riding lessons at an arena? Or take a bicycle out on<br/>
weekends and toodle through the countryside? Go on a hike? Start a small<br/>
vegetable garden (you can even do it in containers on a patio)? Take a<br/>
weekly walk through a botanical gardens?  Here in the U.S. we have something<br/>
called &quot;4H&quot; where kids (and adults) can get involved in raising animals or<br/>
doing craftwork and then display their work at a yearly fair that takes<br/>
place in the summer. Rural kids/adults often do things like raising dairy<br/>
cattle or goats, but urban kids/adults can participate by raising things<br/>
like Guinea Pigs (Cavies), rabbits, birds, etc. or doing quilting, canning,<br/>
baking, or other crafts. Is there a group like this where you live? Or some<br/>
sort of &quot;country fair&quot; you could participate in? Just some rambling<br/>
thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t this what unschooling is all about - for us adults as well as kids.<br/>
Find our interests and pursue them!<br/>
