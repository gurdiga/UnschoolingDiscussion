<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;I am getting on the planning for the New England Live and Learn<br/>
&gt; Conference in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;2004. It looks like it will probably be in August, but the exact dates<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;location aren&#39;t final yet. In the meantime, I have a few questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a question - why is the conference in August? We usually try not to<br/>
&gt; do any big traveling in the summer when all the people who are slaves to the<br/>
&gt; school schedule are doing so. Airfare is often more expensive (we&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; coming from the other side of the country), and to be honest, for people<br/>
&gt; from a temperate climate, the eastern seaboard heat and humidity and pretty<br/>
&gt; off-setting at that time of year. Is there any reason the unschooling<br/>
&gt; conference can&#39;t be in, say, late September? Better weather, less<br/>
&gt; travelers...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, again, this is not definite, but there are a couple of reasons. One is <br/>
entirely selfish: I am off from my job in the summer, and we start up the <br/>
second weekend in September. I am expecting there will be a LOT of work right <br/>
before the conference, and it will be a pain in the butt if it&#39;s during the church <br/>
year.  I also looked at Spring. Also a pain in the butt time for work, but <br/>
easier to work around than fall.<br/>
<br/>
Second, late September starts high season in this area, and I&#39;ve chosen this <br/>
area because, well...I live here and it will be easier to get volunteers, work <br/>
with hotels, etc. The Salem, MA area is VERY congested in late-September <br/>
through October, and all the prices go up. Also, if we want to do Whale Watches, <br/>
etc... Better not to wait too long.<br/>
<br/>
However, if someone else wants to take over the major planning in another <br/>
geographical area, that&#39;s fine. (I don&#39;t mean this in a snotty, &quot;Well, FINE, you <br/>
don&#39;t like my plan, then you do it&quot; sorta way. I am seriously open to someone <br/>
else doing this in New England, and would even help, but if I&#39;m doing most of <br/>
the work I have this strong preference for making it as easy as possible for <br/>
myself.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like the August idea myself.  Here, in the South, the kids all go back to <br/>
school the beginning of August so the roads are not congested.  No summer <br/>
traffic.  And was also thinking about taking the family back to Maine where I grew <br/>
up and the weather will be nice.  <br/>
