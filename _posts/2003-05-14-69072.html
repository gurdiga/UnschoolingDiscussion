&gt; What you did just happened to work out. It may have worked out because of<br/>
&gt; something in your daughter&#39;s voice or attitude or personality that made <br/>
&gt; this<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think maybe what I was trying to share wasn&#39;t so much the technique but the <br/>
&quot;idea&quot; that sometimes things that startle us as parents and we feel the need <br/>
to &quot;figure out&quot; or &quot;deal with&quot; in a very appropriate manner really aren&#39;t <br/>
that important to the child and are soon forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
With my daughter apparently it was just a passing fleeting thought in her <br/>
mind about smoking.  With some children it might not be and it would require <br/>
something different.<br/>
<br/>
I guess there are lots of options from a resounding &quot;NO&quot; if asked if they can <br/>
smoke to &quot;sure let&#39;s fire you one up now&quot; and of course everything in between <br/>
but sometimes just acknowledging that moment in time and validating that they <br/>
asked and you heard and will consider at a later time is enough for them and <br/>
they go on with life.<br/>
