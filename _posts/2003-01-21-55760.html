<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952786072">Good morning, I met to post yesterday but Avery got really sick and <br/>
getting on the computer was not an option.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so for the past 2 days food in are house has been done a little <br/>
different, I loved the idea of the monkey platters and we made up a <br/>
couple, with different goodies on both, Jaiden and Avery loved them, <br/>
and I have been asked if we can have them every day, they eat stuff I <br/>
had no idea that they would eat. It was very cool. So on sunday I <br/>
decided that no matter what my kids ate or drank I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
expect that &quot;hyper behavior&quot; I wasn&#39;t going to put all the negitive <br/>
junk my parents had put on to to me, back on to them. And damn if <br/>
there was no difference in their behavoir, until a friend of ours and <br/>
his 3 girls showed up to play, total excitement, we hadn&#39;t seen them <br/>
since before x-mas so they were all very excited, so it was not the <br/>
candy, it was the situation, major shift in thinking for me.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that both of them have been making amazing food <br/>
choices the last few days, I never would have thought that Avery <br/>
would not eat the candy in favor of the cheeese, although Jaiden <br/>
showed him how to wrap m&ms up in cheese, &lt;shudder&gt; but they both <br/>
seem to like it, and thats what matters.<br/>
<br/>
So, thank you all so much for your sharing your thoughts and time <br/>
with me. And thank you all for holding my hand as I struggle with <br/>
overcoming my past and thank you for jioning me on my journey to <br/>
become not just an unschooler, but a better parent.<br/>
Thank You.<br/>
<br/>

this---when people &quot;get&quot; it! It makes us all feel warm and cuddly inside! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Thanks for sharing! <br/>
