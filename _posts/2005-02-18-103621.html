<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474160456">Hey-never mind Anne! I am 65 and was always being told to get my nose out of a book-that it was going to ruin my eyes- having my reading  brought out for  surprised comment (caught reading by the evening light from a window after &quot;lights out and go to bed&#39;&#39;)  <br/>
That reading that much wasnt good for people.That the reason that I had to get glasses at 10 was because of too much reading.<br/>
Never mind that we lived in the country-that I spent huge amounts of time outside and can count on two fingers the toys or books I had.<br/>
That being taken to the library in town was a huge ordeal.<br/>
They did go to bat for me at the Library-told the Librarians that I could look in the adult stacks because what I wanted wasnt  in the childrens section.<br/>
I was reading James Oliver Curwood, Jack London, -Girl of the Limberlost- and all of his-who wrote those anyway?mind blip.<br/>
The Librarians still would come and tell me I was&#39;nt allowed in that section and I would obstinatly say that my parents said I could-One of them always hovered behind me  and was quick to say &quot;oh, you don.t want to read that-if my hand touched  different books.<br/>
After I was  a teenager I found that there wasnt much there  &quot;forbidden&quot;-Heck I had  read it all in my girfriends True Confessions  mags.etc (g)<br/>
and my parents werent ignorant rednecks-my dad was the manager of a business in town and  active in other groups.-in fact it was his old boxes of books in a back storage closet that started me reading  those types of books at about 10... who knows what thats all about..<br/>
Then when pocketbooks came out they were  suspect-<br/>
now its tv and computer time and video games-and so it goes<br/>
