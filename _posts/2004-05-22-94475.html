Oh yeah...same here. I had the weird baby dreams too.<br/>
The only time I&#39;ve had lesbian tendencies was during pregnancy (and only in my sleeping dreams) so analyze THAT one.?<br/>
That&#39;s some kinda hormone thing to be sure. The second and third trimesters are sexually charged for me every time! But it&#39;s a little harder to fulfill sexual fantasies when you&#39;re the size of a small whale. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062421166">My pregnancy dreams are weird.  They have been the same topic roughly each<br/>
time.  Dan Marino (football guy) is running through my dreams trying to kill<br/>
me?  <br/>
Weird?  I don&#39;t even watch football or any other sport.   HMMMM&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Another one is I am lying on the side of a pool in a recliner lawnchair and<br/>
having repeated orgasms.<br/>
Analysis anyone?<br/>
