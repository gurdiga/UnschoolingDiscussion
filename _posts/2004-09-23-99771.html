 </span></blockquote>As a teacher, I say it every day!  They aren&#39;t there to socialize.  <br/>
Occassionally a well meaning but stupid educator will ask me how my own <br/>
children will ever learn to get along with others, and they are pretty <br/>
shocked when I point out the type of socialization that occurs within <br/>
school, and the type that doesn&#39;t.  Makes them think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s right but they are there *to be* socialized.  That&#39;s quite a <br/>
difference.<br/>
