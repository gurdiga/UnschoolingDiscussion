<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153635015">Thank you to those of you who respectfully put me in my place about how to <br/>
handle a tantrum. You are right and I can see  I am wrong, but I am still <br/>
leaving this list due to someone with &quot;knowledge&quot; .                                  <br/>
                                                                              <br/>
                We worry about what a child will be tomorrow, yet we forget <br/>
that he<br/>
is someone today.<br/>
