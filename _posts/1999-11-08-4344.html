<div id="ygrps-yiv-713791017">Hi all, Sessuale J Here :)<br/>
<br/>
Well I did it - finally!  I got some of the pictures from my daughter&#39;s<br/>
 Indian Dance Recital up on the net and am trying to finish up my site <br/>
on Bharat Natyam *before we leave for India.  As you know my company<br/>
opens for business in Bangalore, India on the 10th so I am unbelievably <br/>
busy!  But I am having a problem finding Indian Clip Art.  I am specifically <br/>
looking for Hindu symbols or dance related clip art. <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help?  Any suggestions are most appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
The site is:<br/>
