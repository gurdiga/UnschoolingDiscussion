<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309904653"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; You know, I read this, and the rest of your response, and I think that is so <br/>
&gt; great.  But I don&#39;t understand it.  The bones of it.  Do you just get up in <br/>
&gt; the morning and say, &quot;what do you want to do today?&quot; Or do you just get up in <br/>
&gt; the morning?  All summer, I let the boys pretty much do what they wanted, I <br/>
&gt; asked them to practice their music everyday, and read 30 min. a day.  They <br/>
&gt; did that, and then played with their Dragon Ball Z action characters the rest <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dragon Ball Z - Ds was really into that for awhile.  He and his <br/>
friends wrote all kinds of role-playing scenarios around it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we get up and have specific things we have to do that day - <br/>
like on Wednesdays we deliver Meals on Wheels and on Thursdays , ds <br/>
has guitar lessons.  Sometimes we talk about what he wants to do - <br/>
for instance if he wants to go to the library, etc.  Most of the time <br/>
we just get up.  You can&#39;t tell our summer from the rest of the year, <br/>
except that the phone quits ringing for ds when the other kids go <br/>
back to school.  He enjoys this because he knows he&#39;ll have <br/>
uninterrupted time for what he wants to do.  Everything seems to go <br/>
in spurts here.  Ds spent days playing Civilization II on the <br/>
computer.  Then he started reading _The Odyssey_ and spent hours on <br/>
that.  This week he spent hours playing his guitar and working on <br/>
geometry, algebra, and physics.  I never know from one day to the <br/>
next what he might really throw himself into.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;ve said all that,  let me point out that this is our 4th <br/>
year of homeschooling which became unschooling after a few months.<br/>
He has had plenty of time to deschool which meant a lot of playing <br/>
video games, watching tv, and staring into space for him.   My dh <br/>
often had more faith than I did that his motivation would kick back <br/>
in.  I used to walk into his room when he was playing video games and <br/>
he would say,  &quot;I&#39;m sorry - I know I should be doing something more <br/>
constructive.&quot;  I&#39;d laugh and respond,  &quot;Why, aren&#39;t you enjoying <br/>
yourself?&quot;  He finally saw it all start to work and we all breathed a <br/>
big sigh of relief.  He still plays video games once in awhile during <br/>
the day,  but most of the time,  he wants to use the time while his <br/>
friends are at school for other things.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how long your children have been out of ps or away from <br/>
structured unschooling.  Understand that it takes time and a lot of <br/>
patience.  Just for a time,  try not to do anything educational.  <br/>
Just have fun.   You&#39;ll find out just how hard it is not to learn <br/>
anything.<br/>
