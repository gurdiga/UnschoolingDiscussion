<div id="ygrps-yiv-100848114">The Live and Learn Unschooling Conference is rapidly approaching----and  this <br/>
time I get to actually sit back and enjoy it! (Maybe I&#39;ll get to even hear  a <br/>
whole speech!)<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
But Kathryn did ask me to be in charge of the raffle, so here&#39;s my  pitch!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The first year&#39;s raffle was pretty cool, but it was mostly stuff I&#39;d begged  <br/>
for on the street---along with a few surprises that stole the show..<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Last year&#39;s was absolutely incredible! Gorgeous one-of-a-kind pieces of  art, <br/>
quilts, books, games, toys, humor (Heidi&#39;s get-out-of-hell-free card was a  <br/>
scream!), food (I won the box of potatoes!), t-shirts, handmade  socks----and <br/>
other special items that only unschoolers could come up with! That  back table <br/>
was literally crammed with items---some even hanging from the  ceiling!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m asking for you to dig deep again! Please help make this one the best  <br/>
yet! The money from the raffle goes to help cover scholarships.<br/>
 <br/>
If you can&#39;t make the conference, you can still participate: you can send  <br/>
your donation to me or to Kathryn. Our addresses are below.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re coming but don&#39;t want to haul it long distance, you may send them  <br/>
ahead by August 1 to me or Kathryn. Otherwise, please just drop them  by the <br/>
raffle table as soon as you&#39;ve registered. We&#39;ll be looking for  you!<br/>
 <br/>
If the item has a &quot;story&quot;, please include it---it&#39;s nice to know more  about <br/>
its donor or its origins.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m excitedly looking forward to what y&#39;all spring on me this year!<br/>
