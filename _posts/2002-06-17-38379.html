<div id="ygrps-yiv-19035526">I attended my states homeschool conference this past weekend.  I was <br/>
very disappointed.  It seemed to be geared toward school at homers or <br/>
at least semi-structured homeschoolers.  Out of 20 workshops and 24 <br/>
round table discussions only ONE discussed unschooling.  Of course I <br/>
did not attend all of these workshops or discussions so I don&#39;t know <br/>
what was mentioned, but I read all the class explanations and found <br/>
nothing about unschooling in the discriptions.  I attended the <br/>
unschooling workshop and it was geared to people who do structured <br/>
homeschooling and are getting burned out.  It was suggested that they <br/>
try unschooling to relieve the stress of structure.  <br/>
<br/>
I felt very left out in my beliefs and the way I choose to <br/>
homeschool.  I was wondering if anyone else has felt like this after <br/>
attending a conference?  I voiced my concerns on the evaluation but <br/>
don&#39;t know what good it will do.  There are no unschooling groups in <br/>
my area.  There is one unschooling friendly group that I enjoy, but <br/>
no group big enough the host some kind a unschooler friendly <br/>
conference. <br/>
<br/>
I read the unschooling.com online newsletter and saw there are a few <br/>
unschooler conferences around.  Where does the funding come from and <br/>
who plans them?<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to some input on this.  Thanks:)<br/>

It might encourage them to have a real unschooling workshop next year.  Or <br/>
maybe they don&#39;t actually believe in it.<br/>

That describes most of the world, for sure.<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes an association with dues can get one started.  Sometimes a person <br/>
or a small group of people who can afford to take a financial risk gets one <br/>
started.<br/>
<br/>
There have been small, cheap conferences which didn&#39;t take much financial <br/>
risk and which developed into larger conferences after a few years.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re even kinda thinking about it, you should attend one of those <br/>
upcoming conferences, or at least really study their websites, following <br/>
every single link!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s always so good to hear from you.  It really helps to find that I <br/>
am not alone.  The sad thing is how many of the conference attendees <br/>
do feel alone and don&#39;t have access to information?<br/>
<br/>
I will think about planning an unschooling event in our state, even <br/>
if it&#39;s just a picnic:)<br/>

<br/>
There was a conference here years back that was a picnic with local speakers. <br/>
  There were a couple of different table areas where there were scheduled <br/>
presentations, and since there were not walls and doors, people could come <br/>
and go, stand and listen, walk away, come back...  and since the organizers <br/>
were La Leche League leaders AND homeschoolers, the expectation about kids <br/>
was that they could be with the moms as much and wherever they wanted, and <br/>
they could also go off in groups with other moms and do stuff.  Some moms led <br/>
kid-hikes, or helped them get food and drinks if their moms were needing to <br/>
really listen.<br/>

HEAV is a typical Christian group.  <br/>
VHEA is an inclusive group with many unschoolers.  They just had <br/>
there 2nd annual homeschooling conference.  They had some famous <br/>
speakers including the author of the Unschooling Handbook.  You can <br/>
check out their website and contact them about how they got <br/>
started.  Good Luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-316916526">I know that sometimes the road less traveled can be lonely, but it does not <br/>
mean the road less traveled is the wrong road.  I would get or reread some <br/>
unschooling books like the unschooling handbook to just make yourself feel <br/>
part of a group again.  I wish that I could have met you at this conference, <br/>
I was not there, but I cannot find unschooling families either.  As far as <br/>
funding, there is always a way to make things happen if it is in your heart.  <br/>
Maybe seeing such a great need for an unschooling conference was what you <br/>
learned by going to this conference, and you learned it in a highly <br/>
unschooling way...by living life!  <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there,<br/>

There is an UNSCHOOLING conference in Columbia, South Carolina 11-13 October <br/>
2002. We will ONLY discuss unschooling---and NOT as a &quot;break&quot; from <br/>
school-at-home! It will be kid-friendly and non-age-discriminatory. You can <br/>
find the website at<br/>
<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org">http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org</a><br/>
<br/>
We willl have wonderful presenters including Sandra Dodd (keynote speaker), <br/>
Joyce Fetteroll, Lisa Bugg, Anne Ohman, Ned Vare & Luz Shosie, and Fiona <br/>
Hutchison. There will be lots of FUNshops (workshops with a twist! &lt;G&gt;) and <br/>
activities for everyone. I hope you can make it!<br/>
