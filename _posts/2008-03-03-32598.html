<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550162062">before getting a dishwasher we used a lot of papar plates.  They are cheap at costco.  We had cups with names on them so everyone had a cup and could wash thier own.  Then I only had to wash pots and pans and silverwear.  We used plastic silverwear sometimes too.<br/>
I also hate doing dishes.  I bought one of those dishwashers that we roll over to the sink and hook it up, then push it back in the corner when we&#39;re not using it.  It works great, then I don&#39;t have to do dishes.  Everyone puts their dishes into it when they finish eating.  <br/>
Good Luck<br/>

recommendation of disposable.  Plus, I&#39;ve seen countertop dishwashers.  They<br/>
are smaller, so they don&#39;t hold the amount of dishes a large dishwasher<br/>
would, but, they would help with the issue!  I did a quick google search and<br/>
there are a bunch of different ones.  Here is one:  *<br/>

I&#39;d wash them later.  I hated the scrape and rinse aspect but he  <br/>
didn&#39;t mind, so it worked out.  When the kids were little, doing the  <br/>
dishes was a break for me -- they weren&#39;t interested in helping, so it  <br/>
gave me time to think &lt;g&gt;  Now that they&#39;re big, the kids will pitch  <br/>
in, too; washing while my 20 y.o. dd dries is companionable.<br/>
<br/>
Could you find ways to divide the job up?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you think the blockage is really in the area of the sink, not  <br/>
further down the drain pipes, you can try a couple of home remedies.   <br/>
Baking soda and vinegar can help, and be quite entertaining as well.   <br/>
Another that works really well on grease is to pour a couple cups of  <br/>
ammonia into the drain, followed by boiling water.  If you have a  <br/>
double sink, routinely fill both sinks with hot water, then pull both  <br/>
plugs at the same time to help clear the drains.<br/>
<br/>
If your sink will drain for awhile and then backs up, it might be  <br/>
blocked further down.  We battled a blocked drain for years (which is  <br/>
the only reason I know this stuff -- learning by doing!).  Snaking it  <br/>
finally had no effect, so my plumber spent a day putting in access in  <br/>
the front yard.  Snaking it from there identified the problem, which  <br/>
turned out to be under the street.  That made it the city&#39;s problem,  <br/>
not ours -- they had to send a crew out to dig up the street and fix  <br/>
it.  They couldn&#39;t have done it, though, without our first installing  <br/>
that access.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could you set the wash tubs on a table in the yard and wash the dishes  <br/>
al fresco?  Your kids could pretend they&#39;re camping.<br/>
<br/>
Paper plates can be helpful, too :-)  I also found that using pretty  <br/>
dishes helps; after 25 years of marriage, I finally dragged the  <br/>
wedding china out of storage and started using it every day.  The  <br/>
pattern is discontinued but I could still get replacements if I broke  <br/>
one; I&#39;m more worried I&#39;ll drop one than that a kid will (my baby will  <br/>
be 18 this month ;-)<br/>

<br/>
Someone else has recommended paper plates. <br/>
<br/>
Put all the dishes away, out of reach, except for a plate, bowl, spoon, fork, knife, and cup for each of you.  That will limit the number of dishes you&#39;ll be dirtying.  You&#39;ll wash them more often but there won&#39;t be a pile of dishes.  Doesn&#39;t really work if you have as many family members as you have dishes, though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wash a thing as soon as you&#39;re finished with it.  I have a really small kitchen and I usually wash each sauce pan or pot the minute I&#39;m finished with it.  <br/>
Keep a little bit of hot water in your wash pan.  Heat it up when you need to.  Stop and wash one thing when you&#39;re walking by.  <br/>
<br/>
Microwave what you can and save yourself pot scrubbing. <br/>
<br/>
Can you trade with a friend?  She&#39;ll come do your dishes once a day if you take her kids swimming or something? <br/>
Can you hire a neighborhood kid to do dishes in the evening for you?    Do you have something you could trade out for dish doing?  Piano lessons?  Sewing? Carpentry?<br/>
<br/>
Pick up cheap dishes at the second hand store and when they&#39;re dirty, toss them out the window like Lisa Douglas on &quot;Green Acres.?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I used to hate washing dishes and now I love it.  Sickening, isn&#39;t it?   Some things that helped change my thinking: <br/>
<br/>
I stopped thinking, &quot;I hate to do dishes&quot; and started thinking, &quot;I want clean dishes.&quot; <br/>
My dad gave me a gift of beautiful dishes before he died.  When I wash them it makes me think about the last couple of years with him and how I came to know and like him. <br/>
My kid&#39;s hands itch in water so making sure he had all the clean dishes he needed felt like good mothering to me. <br/>
I picked my dishes from here and there, pieces I really like, and made some too.  I was gifted some pretty things and when I wash them I enjoy thinking about how I acquired them and how long I&#39;ve had them and the friends and groovy ones who gave them to me.   <br/>
It calms me to have my hands in hot water.  I light a candle (currently a skull candle, which, when lit, drips red wax blood. Courtesy of my son, the ghoul.&lt;g&gt;)  I open the curtains to look out the window, I put on some music, pour a glass of wine or a cup of tea.  It&#39;s my cheap substitute for a spa.  It&#39;s my mental health moment. <br/>
I bought a stool for the kitchen and my kid comes and sits on the stool and visits with me while I wash dishes. <br/>
I have some weird hand pain and it feels good to have them in hot water. <br/>
I like bubbles.  I keep a bubble wand by the sink. <br/>
I only do the dishes when I want to.  And I only do as much as I want.  If I&#39;m busy and there are only a few dirty plates but lots of coffee mugs, I might just wash some of the coffee mugs.  I think about convenience for others and wash what will most likely be needed. <br/>
I think of doing dishes as a gift to my family.  They may not think of it as a gift but when I know their lives are more convenient because they can find what they need in the kitchen, I feel happy.   <br/>
And because I do dishes happily,  on the occasions  they do pile up, no one is stressed by that because we all know they&#39;ll get washed at a more convenient time. <br/>
If I know I won&#39;t be home much or I&#39;ll be otherwise occupied we use paper plates. <br/>
<br/>
We used to live in Knik Alaska.  We had no plumbing.  We hauled our water to the house from a public well seven miles away. (uphill both ways through the deep snow with rags tied around our feet)   I heated water on the wood stove and dumped the wash and rinse basins out in the leach field.   When we moved to Montana where we had fancy indoor pluming it seemed kind of like a miracle that all I had to do was turn that knob and get hot water!  Golly I&#39;m pathetic.&lt;g&gt; <br/>

post that my sink has a window above it, looking out on my backyard,  <br/>
trees, and beyond to Cowles Mountain, which is really a little hill  <br/>
but hey, it&#39;s a view &lt;g&gt;  We have bird feeders, too, so there&#39;s always  <br/>
something to see.  At night, I have candles on the window ledge.<br/>
<br/>
I like the hot water, too.  I sometimes make dish washing a manicure  <br/>
treatment: I do a salt and olive oil exfoliating scrub, rinse that  <br/>
off, apply a heavy cream like Nivea or udder balm, and then put on  <br/>
rubber gloves.  The heat activates the hand cream, and I have really  <br/>
nice skin when I&#39;m done with the dishes.<br/>

Until the sink is fixed, could you concentrate on foods that are  <br/>
served without dishes?  You could use paper napkins or paper towels  <br/>
or just cheap printer-paper for &quot;plates&quot; then, if you can&#39;t afford  <br/>
paper plates.<br/>
<br/>
When the sink is fixed, could you ask one of your kids to come and  <br/>
sit and talk to you while you do dishes?  That would keep you from  <br/>
being &quot;DOING DISHES&quot;--you&#39;d be visiting with one of the kids.  They  <br/>
might want to help; it&#39;s possible, but don&#39;t ask.  Just make it seem  <br/>
as fun as you can.<br/>
<br/>
For a while Holly wanted it to be her job to mop the kitchen floor.   <br/>
Cool, because I hate mopping.  She did  it for a few months and  <br/>
stopped.  That&#39;s okay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376537222">I find the relaxing and enjoyable smell of lavender and ylang ylang<br/>
Palmolive really helps to make doing the dishes more enjoyable for me.<br/>
And I also second the idea of trying to do them often so they don&#39;t<br/>
become this huge heap of worry or resentment. Just do them and get<br/>
done with them so you can go do other fun stuff. And yeah sure paper<br/>
is great if you can afford it. <br/>
   Have you got an action plan going for when you will be able to<br/>
afford getting the plumber there? If not make one even if it&#39;s 6<br/>
months from now. Just knowing that this won&#39;t be a problem forever<br/>
helps to deflate the aggravation.  <br/>
   And remember things could easily be worse. When we had new kitchen<br/>
counter tops installed (they were linoleum when we moved in euww! but<br/>
usable)we had do to without a kitchen sink for about a week. I washed<br/>
dishes in the bathtub and it really made my back hurt. I wish I had<br/>
thought about setting up tubs in my yard as someone suggested, that<br/>
sounds like a lot of fun! <br/>
