<br/>
I don&#39;t know a thing about archives but unschooling music involves getting<br/>
an instrument and some sheet music and playing around....or playing around<br/>
without sheet music...or talking to someone who plays that instrument about<br/>
how they might play the piece....or going to hear the piece at the<br/>
symphony....or.....<br/>

such<br/>

about<br/>
&gt; that. I have put in music and instruments but am not getting anything,<br/>

My 12yro is teaching himself piano and electric guitar and it is so <br/>
interesting to watch. I wondered what others might have made available that I have not <br/>
thought of.<br/>

Previous (or Next) to get the search on the next 100.<br/>

Yes, it&#39;s a pain.<br/>

If you put in music or instruments, you must keep<br/>
hitting &quot;next&quot; as it only searches about 150 messages<br/>
at a time.<br/>
<br/>
It may take a while to find them, but if you keep<br/>
clicking on next you will eventually get there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It will, starting with the most recent, and working<br/>
backwards, about 150 at a time.  It is tedious, but<br/>
that is how yahoo has it set up right now.  And seeing<br/>
the size of the archive for this list, give yourself<br/>
about 30 minutes at least to make it all the way<br/>
through.  Keep your finger on that mouse button and<br/>
just keep clicking &quot;next&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe this could be included in the FAQs. I tried searching a while back for food allergies and didn&#39;t have much luck. I didn&#39;t realize it only searched 150 at a time. Duh!<br/>

Would searching on the unschooling.com message boards generate more <br/>
&quot;hits&quot;?  I&#39;ve only searched there a couple of times and I&#39;m not sure <br/>
whether everything ever posted there is searched, or whether there is a <br/>
time limit or some other limit.  Anybody know?<br/>
<br/>
Going there and searching on &quot;piano&quot; or some other key word of interest <br/>
might be less frustrating than searching the archives for this list. <br/>
 &quot;Lessons&quot; would turn up a lot of debate about &quot;math lessons&quot; or <br/>
&quot;reading lessons&quot;, probably.<br/>
<br/>
BTW -- How &quot;old&quot; is this list after the latest name change?  Are we or <br/>
are we not linked to the archives of past incarnations of this list?<br/>

Probably so, and it would be easier to read what you would find, too, at the <br/>
message boards.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The list still goes back to the beginning.  It has had three names:<br/>
Unschooling-dotcom<br/>
Unschooling-Discussion<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion<br/>
but the archives have survived the name changes.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda like I have been Sandra Adams, Sandra Gill, and Sandra Dodd, and yet I <br/>
have ALL THIS JUNK from all those times!!     (I mean all the important <br/>
collections of my entire life...)<br/>

the search to messages within in the last day, last week, last 6 months (or<br/>
something like those) and unlimited.<br/>

I haven&#39;t been able to get it to work at all recently but it might just be<br/>

<br/>
Use the word MUSIC or the word for a musical instrument. I know that <br/>
RECORDER, VIOLIN, PIANO, GUITAR have been discussed, so you may want to <br/>
start with that.<br/>
