had several cultures done, yeast tests, etc., and NOTHING showed up. It was <br/>
horrid.<br/>
Finally we were referred to Children&#39;s Hospital in Philly. She&#39;s fine today, <br/>
because of the advice they gave us. They said that her labia tended to stick <br/>
together, and the pH of the urine was burning her skin. The remedy? Face the <br/>
toilet and go to the bathroom. Can you believe it? All those tests, and <br/>
needing to go to CHOPs to see a specialist, and they say turn around and face <br/>
the toilet the other way...<br/>

1850 A.D. - That prayer is superstition. Here, drink this potion. <br/>
1940 A.D. - That potion is snake oil. Here, swallow this pill. <br/>
1985 A.D. - That pill is ineffective. Here, take this antibiotic. <br/>
2000 A.D. - That antibiotic is artificial. Here, eat this root. ~<br/>

  could you expand on that a bit is it because of leg spread facing that direction? just curious as we just took my 13 yo to the doctor again thinking she had a bladder infection and nothing showed up in the tests!<br/>
  this happens frequently and the only thing that seems to help is taking cranberry pills altho this may be just coincidence!<br/>
  thanks<br/>
