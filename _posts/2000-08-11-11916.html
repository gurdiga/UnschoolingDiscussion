<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I need some advice here. I had hamsters when I was 
young, but I must admit was pretty niave about them and their care. Then right 
before my husband and I got married we got one and surprise! three days later it 
had babies. I held on to them (or at least the ones the mom didn&#39;t eat) for 5 
weeks then brought the whole litter and mom and cage to the pet store, put ti 
downa and walked out. Part of me felt bad, but I really felt that I had fufilled 
my obligation and we we&#39;re leaving for our honeymoon. O.K., now that I&#39;ve made a 
short story long.. my 7 yo dd now wants a hamster, so&nbsp; now that I&#39;m older 
and more responsible (sometimes), I&#39;m doing my homework. My 2 biggest concerns 
are determining the sex of the hamster before we buy it (especially making sure 
if it&#39;s pg or not) and what to do about our dog and cats. We&#39;re already planning 
on keeping them in her room, but I&#39;m worried they might sneak in. Any 
suggestions or advice appreciated.</font></div>
