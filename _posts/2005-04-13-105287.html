&gt; &gt; Okay, thanks for letting me vent a bit. More than likely, it&#39;s &quot;family<br/>
&gt; &gt; meeting time.&quot; and I&#39;ll be able to express my frustrations without <br/>
&gt;trashing<br/>
&gt; &gt; the kids. Lots of my anger was already dissipated from picking up and <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt; &gt; baking bread. and practicing my piano.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fantastic vent.  I read it all and took a deep breath for you.  Thank<br/>
&gt;goodness some things can help us cool off before we fire it all out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I ususally don&#39;t have much of an issue in the house cuz my kids are still<br/>
&gt;really little and we all kinda go to bed about the same time so I have no<br/>
&gt;surprises in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the reasons why I gave up on a regular bedtime was the flat out fact <br/>
that my 10 year old is a genuine night owl, from birth. She slept in bed <br/>
with us, so I didn&#39;t notice it until she got her own bed at about 2 yoa. <br/>
Then, I&#39;d settle her in, and sing her a song (her favorite was &quot;How Much Is <br/>
That Doggy In the Window?&quot; LOL) and go to bed myself in a peaceful, quiet <br/>
house. Next day, peering in on sleeping kids, i&#39;d find my little Blondeletta <br/>
sound asleep...in a box in the corner of the room, under the bed with covers <br/>
draped over everything, in the closet with a lamp shining nearby, sometimes <br/>
with markers and paper or books or masses of stuffed toys all piled up <br/>
around her. From the moment she &quot;could&quot; she&#39;s been staying up late and doing <br/>
her own thing. Now, it&#39;s just spread from her room out to the rest of the <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
But for us, occasionally mine will get beyond my patience<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;when we are out running errands or whatever and I am so thankful that we <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;the ride home to listen to music or the DVD or the gameboys or whatever, to<br/>
&gt;calm us all down.  By the time we get home, it&#39;s no biggie and we can talk <br/>
&gt;if we<br/>
&gt;need to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Calming down first is so important. Hence, my morning rant before anyone got <br/>
up. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think setting some rules for &quot;after hours&quot; is a good thing.  They may be<br/>
&gt;tired and really aren&#39;t thinking about cleaning up at night, maybe the <br/>
&gt;lights<br/>
&gt;are low and they don&#39;t see all the crumbs and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re right about not seeing all the crumbs and stuff, but...at <br/>
least in the case of my 10 year old, she isn&#39;t tired. The other day! LOL at <br/>
11 o&#39;clock at night, she was moving furniture around in her room. This HUGE <br/>
bunk bed, with her brother&#39;s help. And then they moved HIS stuff around. <br/>
Alert, active, vocal, (mostly keeping it down for my sake), happy as clams. <br/>
Happy as active, at-their-diurnal-peak clams, that is!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I do request that she stay in her room after i go to bed, and <br/>
that usually has the effect of keeping her quiet for a couple of hourse <br/>
while I fall asleep, but more often than not, she&#39;s moved herself to the <br/>
couch or the front room floor by morning, where my hubby finds her when he <br/>
gets home from work.<br/>
<br/>
If there are dishes<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;they&#39;ve used, they should help clean and put them away.  Same with toys, <br/>
&gt;books, or<br/>
&gt;whatever.  Unless of course they are using those things again later.  Since <br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt;all share the same home, especially &quot;family rooms or common spaces&quot;, they <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;help by taking care of their things.  They probably won&#39;t mind, they may <br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;even realize that you feel this way come morning time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with that, but when they make a mess bigger than they can clean up. <br/>
Or, if she has a huge surge of energy and works on many projects with gusto, <br/>
then *poof* drops. I mean, it happens to me during the day. Then, the <br/>
projects are still all over the place, and her without the energy to clean <br/>
up. I just need to re-emphasize with her the principle of consideration. <br/>
She&#39;s 10. I think she can keep in mind the idea that cleaning up after <br/>
oneself is a socially responsible thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
as for the food, I&#39;m doing just what you suggest: I get groceries in the <br/>
house, with a broad variety of things everyone in the family likes, both <br/>
foods they can get themselves, and things I can fix and have ready for <br/>
them...and when it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone until I get groceries again. Every <br/>
couple of weeks is how it has always worked in this family. I&#39;m not *really* <br/>
gonna call &quot;kitchen closed&quot; but I am going to ask that there be some thought <br/>
about clean up when they&#39;re done. I found similar messes this morning. <br/>
Chocolate milk mix! Gotta give credit. She doesn&#39;t let anything stop her. We <br/>
didn&#39;t have choc milk mix, so she made a batch! and made a MESS...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Thanks for sharing, I feel like I&#39;m less alone when others have share their<br/>
&gt;ups and downs.  I hope all goes well with your family meeting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>family meeting will be this afternoon when 10 year old and daddy are awake. <br/>
Just saying &quot;please clean up if you make a mess&quot; when i went to bed, didn&#39;t <br/>
do the job.<br/>
<br/>
thanks, Pamela<br/>
