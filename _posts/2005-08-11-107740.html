<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068718759">Note after I finished writing:   I just kind of veer around in a loop that <br/>
doesn&#39;t come back where it started.   Three topics meandering.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Most of that describes how it was with us when Kirby was little and my <br/>
husband was way slower to catch on to what was up. &lt;g&gt;    It was one step forward, <br/>
two steps back, and then eventually he passed me.   Shocked me, when he started <br/>
pointing out to me when I was being inflexible and unreasonable, but it was <br/>
pretty cool.     (Would&#39;ve been good for him to be here earlier when I asked <br/>
Kirby to try to treat me more like a person and less like furniture.    I wish I <br/>
hadn&#39;t said that.   Maybe it will help and maybe it will hurt, but it was me <br/>
being whiney/pissy and not me being my best most mature self.)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So pointing this cultural<br/>
&gt; difference out has been fruitful, up until the other day when dh sort<br/>
&gt; of half-heartedly tried to justify hisÂ  behavior by saying it was<br/>
&gt; culturally relative.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unrelated to your husband or mine, I&#39;m jumping off from this to something <br/>
else.   Twice over the years this list has had someone com on (I think it was <br/>
this list) and then back out because of the anti-spanking tone of it.    In both <br/>
cases the mom was Black.   In both cases spanking was held up as a cultural <br/>
tradition, and not negotiable but necessary.   Culturally necessary.   One mom <br/>
was from the Caribbean and one staying with her dad in New Orleans for a while. <br/>
 The first time lots of moms argued and the mom (in Trinidad, I think) got <br/>
angry.   The second time, nobody touched it and I felt bad for the mom, but it&#39;s <br/>
a cheap copout to say &quot;I can&#39;t be nice to my child, it&#39;s not native to my <br/>
culture.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
A lot of things are native to a lot of people&#39;s cultures, including mine.   <br/>
Whipping kids, turning them out entirely in a case of pregnancy, taking their <br/>
money away from them if they work, throwing them out at 18 (or sooner).    <br/>
Pushing them into military service.   I saw that one lately, and heard of another <br/>
case (first family did school; second is homeschoolers).   In the first, the <br/>
mom told her son (who was very attached, and hugged her evertime he woke up and <br/>
everytime he left or returned) that when he turned 18 he could either go to <br/>
college and pay for it all himself, or he could join the military.    I guess <br/>
it didn&#39;t occur to him to say &quot;When I&#39;m 18 you don&#39;t get to limit my choices <br/>
anymore&quot; so he joined the service.<br/>
<br/>
In another family there are three, like mine but younger by a few years (15, <br/>
13, 11 I think) and the dad who has a very good job has not saved nor is he <br/>
planning to pay for college at all.   He told them (just learned) that if they <br/>
want to go to college they need to join ROTC.    <br/>
<br/>
The oldest is a girl, and an artist, and not a ROTC type of person.   She <br/>
wants to go to an art college out of state.   She could go now.   Her dad makes <br/>
her do online classes to get a high school diploma.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the best thing he could be doing.<br/>
