<div id="ygrps-yiv-832516566">Yikes! I *so* dislike posts that call a poster out by name. And in the <br/>
subject line, no less! And with negative connotations! How could I have let <br/>
my last post go out like that? BAD zenmomma! So I now officially retitle it <br/>
PICKLE JUICE. :o)<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
