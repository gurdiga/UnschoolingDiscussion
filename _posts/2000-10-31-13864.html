<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857295105">One note I just thought about.  As I said, we attend a Mennonite church,<br/>
which we started going to about five years ago.  One thing I thought was<br/>
very interesting about them is they only school their children to the 8th or<br/>
10th grades, depending on the families, then they apprentence them.  The<br/>
boys go to work with their fathers, or another man in the church who does<br/>
something they are interested in.  The girls go home and are taught by their<br/>
mothers how to run a home (I know, I know some of you won&#39;t agree with that,<br/>
let&#39;s just agree to disagree!!).  So after my son had completed the 8th<br/>
grade, I left him on his own to learn, esp. to work on his art, since he<br/>
hopes he will be able to make a living with that.  (unschooling?)  He has<br/>
learned so much more in this time than what we had done before.  I came in<br/>
one day and he was laying on his bed reading an economics book left over<br/>
from when his sisters were schooling.<br/>
One thing I will say about the books you have bought, Tami, keep buying<br/>
them.  There have been books I bought that weren&#39;t touched for years, then<br/>
another child found them on the bookshelf and got them out to read.  I don&#39;t<br/>
ever get rid of  any kind of school books.<br/>
 Also have you seen the &quot;Keepers At Home&quot;  unit study ?  Your daughter might<br/>
be interested in that.  It teaches all kinds of old fashioned skills, like<br/>
knitting, crocheting, candle making, sewing, care of the elderly, herbs,<br/>
comforting the greiving, giving birth...  It&#39;s an amazing book.  My little<br/>
girl, the only one at home, will only be four this week, but I bought it<br/>
because there were so many things I wanted to learn.<br/>

&gt; I am *just a little further* ahead of where you are with<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  After removing my then 11yr old from school we did<br/>
&gt; school at home and moved onto unschooling because it didnt work.<br/>
&gt; For 4 months my dd has been deschooling - I waited and waited and<br/>
&gt; waited for something to happen....becoming more and more desperate.<br/>
&gt; Suggesting things - starting things - but all she wanted to do was<br/>
&gt; watch TV.  I bought a mathwork book. (This is the only structured<br/>
&gt; thing I insisted she do)......and waited.<br/>
&gt; Toni is a night owl and a late riser. I am the opposite and I found<br/>
&gt; this hard to handle - but I allowed her body clock to take over.  I<br/>
&gt; learned not to nag.  I also learned that Toni is at her best late<br/>
&gt; afternoon and early evening - I also found that she works better with<br/>
&gt; noise.......<br/>
&gt; Toni did 5 pages of math yesterday while watching TV and got most of<br/>
&gt; them right!! This is happening more and more.  She has several e-pals<br/>
&gt; who she now correspondces with several times a week - before i used<br/>
&gt; to TELL her to answere these emails and she would leave them - Now<br/>
&gt; that i leave her to her own device as far as *school* goes, we get<br/>
&gt; much more done.<br/>
&gt; So dont give up.  These lovely people on these message boards kept<br/>
&gt; telling me it *would happen* - I didnt believe them!!!!  But honestly<br/>
&gt; *It will happen* just be patient..<br/>

That book sounds awesome!! My daughter happens to love that kind of stuff. <br/>
She is the official mother hen to the youngest cousins who happen to live <br/>
with us. Do you think I would emotionally scar my niece if I let my dd <br/>
&quot;Practice&quot; on her?  &lt;GG&gt;<br/>

we &quot;older women&quot; supposed to teach the &quot;younger women&quot;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1352018552">I do wish that I had learned more household duties before I got married. I <br/>
was clueless when I got married , granted  I was only 18 and we got by. At <br/>
first hubby had to do most of the cooking. (burnt everything I touched) &lt;gg&gt;  <br/>
I have learned alot over the years and dd knows more at the age of 9 than I <br/>
did at 18 but she enjoys it and is always asking to cook or do laundry. <br/>
GGrandma has even started to show her how to knit. She taught us kids too but <br/>
 I didnt get it right away so I gave up. <br/>
