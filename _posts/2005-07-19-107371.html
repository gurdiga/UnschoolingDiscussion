<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591259831">Hello everyone!<br/>
I would like to introduce myself and my family. My name is Jenn and I am <br/>
a single parent with two children; DD, Madison,  who will be 11 next <br/>
month and DS, Deon,  who is 4. I have been lurking on this list for some <br/>
time but there has been a period of time where I wasn&#39;t following the <br/>
posts so if my questions have been asked before I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
I withdrew my DD from school this past March after being fed up with the <br/>
way 5th grade (and her entire academic career in general) was <br/>
progressing. She started lying around October about her homework <br/>
assignments, saying she didn&#39;t have any most nights. Her teacher called <br/>
me in November and I discovered she gave homework every night. From that <br/>
point on I learned that Madison did not care about school. I was raised <br/>
in a family where my own mother overcompensated. Her mother (my Nana) <br/>
was very strict: beatings, screaming, strict rules, very strict <br/>
upbringing, Catholic school. My mom being the oldest of 5 rebelled at an <br/>
early age and I guess figured she would do the opposite with her own <br/>
children. The result was just as disastrous, in my opinion, as I was <br/>
given no responsibility, no encouragement and therefore, no value.<br/>
<br/>
Further discussions with Madison made me realize I needed to homeschool, <br/>
which was something I was researching anyway. Speaking to other <br/>
homeschoolers I learned about unschooling. Madison brightened at the <br/>
idea of not having to open another text book again. It hadn&#39;t dawned on <br/>
me, prior to this, that school had squashed the curious little learner <br/>
who asked countless questions as a toddler. She started pre-school at <br/>
the age of 4, while I went to school and eventually began working <br/>
full-time. She never loved elementary school. She preferred the times in <br/>
pre-school and kindegarten when she was allowed to play, color and have <br/>
fun with her classmates. So we have spent the last 5 months doing <br/>
&quot;nothing&quot; (not really nothing but it would look that way to others) and <br/>
in the beginning I was nervous. I believe in the approach to unschooling <br/>
but my faith is a bit shaky because we are so new to this.<br/>
<br/>
I have always been a strict parent, trying to approach a level of <br/>
discipline some where between my mother and Nana, but ways that I am not <br/>
proud of have seeped in, such as yelling. I am working hard to control <br/>
that, knowing it has nothing to do with the child but my own <br/>
frustrations or impatience. I, of course, explain this to them but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean anything to a poor child who has been yelled at. I have <br/>
made great strides recently so I am proud of my own learning. So in the <br/>
midst of our adjusting to a new way of life, I &#39;ve had to deal with some <br/>
family members (actually two, my mother and aunt) who ask endless <br/>
questions and although I explained unschooling in the beginning, I gave <br/>
up and am now just &quot;agreeing&quot; with what they say, or lying to them. For <br/>
instance, &quot;How do you know she is learning anything?&quot; &quot;I ask her <br/>
questions.&quot; I don&#39;t want to lie but felt I needed to not have the <br/>
emotional interference until I could stand on my own two feet and <br/>
proudly declare, &quot;We are a unschooling family and it is best for us.&quot; <br/>
Other questions I hear are, &quot;What is she learning? How do you know what <br/>
subjects to teach? How will you teach Chemistry or Algebra? You need to <br/>
teach spelling, writing, grammar. Tape a multiplication chart to her <br/>
wall so she can look at it.&quot; Here, that will help her learn math. <br/>
Eventually she won&#39;t even see it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
My mother&#39;s questions are easier. She is most likely to one day <br/>
understand but my aunt, who is a psychologist and works in the public <br/>
school system, is another story. My daughter is overweight and she does <br/>
not agree with my allowing the kids to eat what they want, when they are <br/>
hungry. She believes that a child can&#39;t get what they need nutritionally <br/>
because they are too young to make &quot;informed decisions&quot;. I know that is <br/>
bull.  So sorry, this got so long.<br/>
<br/>
What I need are some responses for family&#39;s questions that will shut <br/>
them up without being rude. :) I am thankful to have found this group <br/>
and hope to become involved.<br/>
Thank you for listening,<br/>
Jenn :)</div>

<br/>
Welcome Jenn. You have come to the right place. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t want to lie but felt I needed to not have the <br/>
emotional interference until I could stand on my own two feet and <br/>
proudly declare, &quot;We are a unschooling family and it is best for us.&quot; <br/>
Other questions I hear are, &quot;What is she learning? How do you know what <br/>
subjects to teach? How will you teach Chemistry or Algebra? You need to <br/>
teach spelling, writing, grammar. Tape a multiplication chart to her <br/>
wall so she can look at it.&quot; Here, that will help her learn math. <br/>
Eventually she won&#39;t even see it anymore. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely understand the desire to avoid emotional interference (great<br/>
phrase!) One of the ways I have dealt with it, and pretty much continue to<br/>
deal with it, is not to do school or even school bashing conversations. This<br/>
is for my own personal sanity. <br/>
<br/>
I used to immediately end the phone conversation with my mother, who died in<br/>
January, and then send her some literature by email. The point for me was<br/>
that attempting to argue or persuade only made me feel distraught (too much<br/>
baggage) and overly critical of her ignorance. I was engaging in self care<br/>
by not allowing someone with a history of dripping tiny slips of poison into<br/>
my brain and heart to even begin. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore one of my suggestions is to try to keep most of these<br/>
conversations to the phone so that they are simple to end on your terms,<br/>
even if it&#39;s along the lines of &quot;Oh Deon needs my help, gotta go&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion is not to let these folk get past the first question,<br/>
&quot;What is she learning?&quot; Immediately jump in with some of her latest<br/>
activities focusing on her enjoyment of them with long winded enthusiasm.<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t find it tough to rave about Jayn, and only restrain<br/>
myself amongst other parents because I don&#39;t want to bore everyone else who<br/>
is likely equally besotted with their own kids. I have no compunction with<br/>
Jayn&#39;s relatives talking her up at all.<br/>
<br/>
Other people have recommended saying things like, &quot;We&#39;re really happy with<br/>
how things are going for now, but if we run into problems we&#39;ll rethink<br/>
then&quot; or similar. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;my aunt, who is a psychologist and works in the public <br/>
school system, is another story. My daughter is overweight and she does <br/>
not agree with my allowing the kids to eat what they want, when they are <br/>
hungry. She believes that a child can&#39;t get what they need nutritionally <br/>
because they are too young to make &quot;informed decisions&quot;. I know that is <br/>
bull. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This may sound harsh, but I would limit my (and DD&#39;s) contact with someone<br/>
so uncongenial for the time being, while certainly remembering that your<br/>
aunt means well. It is possible to say things like, &quot;I know you love<br/>
Madison. Thanks for your concern.&quot; Or even, &quot;That&#39;s very interesting. Thank<br/>
you for sharing that information.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All the advice in the world is still hot air, unless you choose to implement<br/>
it.<br/>

different lesson from the two of them --- what was missing in both <br/>
cases was POSITIVE CONNECTION!!<br/>

Read Alfie Kohn&#39;s new book, &quot;Unconditional Parenting.&quot;<br/>

control people&#39;s (kids, employees, etc.) behavior using either rewards<br/>
or punishments may &quot;work&quot; (obtain compliance) in the short term, but is<br/>
ultimately self defeating.<br/>
<br/>
It has given me lots of food for thought, and it might be useful in<br/>
helping you think about how to respond to pressure to be more<br/>
controlling in your child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you Pan and Emile. I will look into both books. With all the <br/>
stress Madison and I dealt with during the first half of fifth grade, I <br/>
purchased Between Parent and Child, by Dr. Hain G. Gnott and How to Talk <br/>
So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk, by Adele Faber & Elaine <br/>
Mazlish. I have read the first one so far and it has taught me a lot of <br/>
how to talk and not to talk to my kids so that we can share a mutual <br/>
respect. I never, consciously, thought I wasn&#39;t being respectful so it <br/>
hurts to know that I have been harsh with my babies.  Thanks again for <br/>
the suggestions. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716160627">Try if they don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell.  I would change the subject and <br/>
give answers like, &quot;I&#39;ll think about that&quot; or &quot;You might be right&quot;.  <br/>
Avoid them if they are constantly negative.  Why allow yourself to <br/>
be bullied?  Don&#39;t seek their approval.  Accept the fact that you <br/>
don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s approval!!  You may not get a lot, even from <br/>
other homeschoolers.  : )<br/>
