<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034932914">A friend has told us that there is an abundance of figs we should come<br/>
and pick.<br/>
I don&#39;t know the first thing about what to do with an abundance of<br/>
figs.  I tasted my first one last year.<br/>
Any recipes out there?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

You can eat them raw and dehydrate them.  Grind them up and fold them<br/>
into whipped cream or ice cream or yogurt for dessert.  The seeds are<br/>
high in calcium, but you can&#39;t absorb much of it unless they are ground<br/>
up or chewed REALLY well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93620400">Hi Ann,<br/>
<br/>
I am originally from Louisiana, so I know about figs. They are my absolutely <br/>
favorite fruit and I miss having them so much. Yesterday, my brother sent me <br/>
an article that was written about him and the farmers market. In the article, <br/>
there is talk of a fig recipe. They are the best fresh . .  . just peel and <br/>
eat, but if you have too many, maybe you can make some preserves, which is <br/>
what this recipe is for. Here is the link.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447278199">I have always eaten the fig skins.  Dh hates to eat peach skins.  They<br/>
don&#39;t bother me, but I don&#39;t like pear skins.<br/>
