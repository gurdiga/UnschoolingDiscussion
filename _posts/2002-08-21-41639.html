Working Guide to Your Own Insides by Linda Allison.  &quot;It will show you <br/>
experiments to try and tools to make that will help you see and feel and hear <br/>
what is going on inside. You&#39;ll amaze yourself.&quot;   In addition, all the color <br/>
atlases of the human body are fascinating. <br/>
