<div id="ygrps-yiv-802265042">This week is the time of year when I realize how spoiled we are the <br/>
rest of the year. Yes, school is out for the summer and the parks, <br/>
museums, campgrounds, playgrounds, concerts, and pools are full <br/>
again! It sure makes me appreciate our 9 months of relative peace and <br/>
quiet (that is, unless a school group happens to unload a busfull at <br/>
wherever we happen to be).<br/>

camping and didn&#39;t have to come home to an avalanche of mail...<br/>

Mom to Mackenzie (8/28/96) &quot;I like to create lots of things, and they <br/>
all<br/>
need tape!&quot;<br/>
and Asa (10/5/99) who is wearing underwear!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son discovered super glue 2 days ago and everything has either been broke <br/>
so it could be fixed or glue down, shut, open etc. We now have crayon and a <br/>
lighter glued to my counter!! (yes he also glued the lighter wheel so it <br/>
dont actually work anymore).<br/>
Congrats on the underwear Asa!<br/>

Eeek!!  We&#39;ve discovered masking-tape&#39;s great for model-<br/>
making!!  The kids love it, I don&#39;t have glue-y things <br/>
to clean up and we don&#39;t waste as much!!  I was fixing <br/>
things with super-glue and managed to blob some on my <br/>
finger... it came off eventually...<br/>
