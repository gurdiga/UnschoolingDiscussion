Yes, that is what &quot;they&quot; say.  Has anyone ever seen hard data on this? <br/>
Have more babies really died on a waterbed than on some other bed?  It<br/>
seems that there is usually some other factor involved.  The death of a<br/>
child is a tragedy, no matter how it occurs, but what parents really need<br/>
is information on how to safely co-sleep.  We aren&#39;t being told to stop<br/>
using cribs, even though babies die in cribs.  A lot of effort is put<br/>
into keeping children safer in cars - research on better restraint<br/>
systems and educating parents on using them and helping low-income<br/>
families obtain them - and it is paying off.  Maybe the difference is<br/>
that there is no $$ profit in co-sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
I was nervous about co-sleeping, slept lightly while baby was young, and<br/>
often checked to make sure she was still breathing.  Also, she slept<br/>
beside me with my arm around her.  Dh was on my other side.  In spite of<br/>
this, I felt far more rested with this child because I did not have to<br/>
get out of bed for night feedings.  Some parents sleep better if child is<br/>
not in their bed, and that&#39;s fine too.  There are other choices.  One<br/>
problem is that many of us can&#39;t afford to buy ourselves a new bed when<br/>
baby comes.  I had a friend whose bedroom had wall to wall futons on the<br/>
floor and that&#39;s where the whole family slept.<br/>

**I don&#39;t have &quot;hard data&quot; but it has been in the news where babies who<br/>
can&#39;t lift their heads well have suffocated on water beds. A woman in this<br/>
area (a nurse) lost her baby this way. She had never rolled over before and<br/>
unfortunately, the first time was the last time. You know how waterbeds are:<br/>
very collapsible. It&#39;s not hard to imagine that this would be a problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175605598">--- i dont know of any one personally who has a baby die this way - <br/>
but i do remember reading about it when my dd was a baby - and i <br/>
agree it is easy to see that this could happen to a baby who for some <br/>
reason did end up on their stomach, who were not able to lift there <br/>
heads<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938839959">Oh!  I had never even heard of co-sleeping, the family bed, or attachment <br/>
parenting when my babies were nursing.  The only thing people ever told me <br/>
was &quot;DO NOT sleep with your baby, that may suffocate them or increase the <br/>
risk of SIDS&quot;  but I slept with my babies anyway, simply because I kept <br/>
drifting off while they were nursing, and I felt guilty about it the entire <br/>
time.  I kept thinking &quot;I&#39;m such a horrible mother, I need to stay awake!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m glad that I did sleep with them, I can&#39;t help but think that we <br/>
developed more of a bond because of it.<br/>
<br/>
I wish more information could be available to new parents at the hospitals <br/>
instead of the standard mainstream stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how many people told me that I need to just start putting <br/>
them in their cribs and let them cry it out until they sleep through the <br/>
night.  UGH<br/>

Mothers to sleep with their babies, the nurses made a point of showing us<br/>
how to put the side up on the beds.   The maternity hospital was so quiet<br/>
compared to how it had been in the past, lots of contented Moms and babies<br/>
sleeping together.<br/>
