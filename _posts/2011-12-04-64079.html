<br/>
Since you&#39;re asking on my personal list, I&#39;m going to recommend my personal books, The Big Book of Unschooling and Moving a Puddle.  (I would italicize, but it would disappear in the mailing, so those are two book titles).<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/bigbook">http://sandradodd.com/bigbook</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook">http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook</a><br/>
<br/>
I own many of the others, have seen some I don&#39;t own, and while there are a couple that perked me up, there were many that dismayed me (for reasons from being too Americo-centric, too badly written, too plagiaristic or otherwise lame).<br/>
<br/>
I do like PS Pirro&#39;s little book, 101 Reasons Why I’m an Unschooler<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://pspirro.com/tag/unschooling/">http://pspirro.com/tag/unschooling/</a><br/>
<br/>
And Sara McGrath, who did the most methodical description of unschooling for Suite 101<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19413/seminar">http://www.suite101.com/course.cfm/19413/seminar</a><br/>
<br/>
has a book that&#39;s an expansion of that, called Unschooling:  A Lifestyle of Learning<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Unschooling-Lifestyle-Learning-Sara-McGrath/dp/0557108535">http://www.amazon.com/Unschooling-Lifestyle-Learning-Sara-McGrath/dp/0557108535</a><br/>
<br/>
Many years back, Mary Griffith summarized all that was being discussed on AOL&#39;s unschooling forum (and did it well, but the ideas were gathered up) and called it The Unschooling Handbook : How to Use the Whole World As Your Child&#39;s Classroom.   She did credit people, and the book was the best there was when it was the only one, but to start off about &quot;Your Child&#39;s Classroom,&quot; for me, brings it all back to sounding schoolish.  Still, it&#39;s not a bad book, but it&#39;s not very current.   (Neither, to be fair, are some of the articles in Moving a Puddle, as to technology, but technology does, and will, march on. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452916010">Sandra&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling is really great.  I have just picked up Parenting for Social Change by Teressa Graham Brett.  I&#39;m more than half way through, and I&#39;m really liking it so far.  It isn&#39;t about unschooling directly, but it seems most of the ideas are taken from unschooling philosophy, and Sandra is sited in there at least a couple of times.  Sandra&#39;s Big Book is more positive, which is inspiring, in my opinion. <br/>

Am I a footnote?  I decided a few years ago that my next &quot;level up&quot; will be if I&#39;m a footnote in a book I didn&#39;t know was even going to mention me. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I was linked (but not a footnote) in a book which is really exciting, but there was a typo, so it goes to SandraTodd.com.  Doh!<br/>

I just did a search and found on location 980 of 1946 you and your site mentioned at endnote number 27 as a resource for unschooling and radical unschooling.  I remembered seeing your name as I skimmed the endnotes of that chapter.  I was mistaken to say there was more than one.

No, not yet.  Maybe someday.  You could get a pdf or an iBook version.  Notes are all at the links I sent before, I&#39;m pretty sure.   The iBook comes from the app store, and the pdf from lulu.com<br/>
