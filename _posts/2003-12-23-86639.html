<br/>
I *taught* my kids to do their own laundry by procrastinating about doing the <br/>
family&#39;s laundry myself.  (A fact of which I wasn&#39;t too proud at the time, <br/>
but the value of which I&#39;m beginning to see in retrospect.  :-)  Therefore, I <br/>
frequently choose NOT to do something that I *ought,* and everything works out <br/>
fine in the end, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Take from THAT what you will.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
