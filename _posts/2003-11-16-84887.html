<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093054732">Can anyone recommend books or movies or anything for an 11 year old <br/>
that is about previous wars. He&#39;s interested in making weapons, playing <br/>
guns, martial arts etc. like a lot of  boys but I think there may be <br/>
more to it.  Any history buffs out there? How can a kid over time, <br/>
understand where we came from, politically, and how it evolved to where <br/>
we are now. Where do you start? And I&#39;m not talking in schoolish terms.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
He doesn&#39;t need to go in order.  He can figure out the same/past/present.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I was collecting morning glory seeds (partly to have something <br/>
outside to do because there are four extra kids in the house trying to sleep) <br/>
and my  husband was out there getting ready to go do something SCA-wise.  We&#39;re <br/>
talking about seeing Master and Commander this afternoon.  I was asking him <br/>
what the technology was then, as to guns.  It&#39;s 1805, so slightly post American <br/>
Revolution, but what advances were there?  He talked about rifle stocks, but <br/>
I seriously doubt the British Navy issued rifles to seamen.  I was mostly <br/>
wondering what kinds of violence to brace myself for, but I suppose a lot might be <br/>
cannonfire, and being chucked into the ocean.   <br/>
<br/>
Every little thing we learn (visually, aurally, however) we can fit into the <br/>
growing model of the universe we all have inside.   If he&#39;s interested in the <br/>
martial sciences parts of the model, I&#39;d recommend highly for political and <br/>
military stuff these two movies, to own if you can.   <br/>
<br/>
El Cid (on video yet, not DVD)<br/>
Henry V<br/>
<br/>
Both discuss why stuff is happening, and both have really good battle scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Both medieval, but that&#39;s my personal interest.<br/>
<br/>
When a kid gets all the aspects of one period, though, he knows what to look <br/>
for and consider in others.  Things like transportation, tactics, motivation <br/>
of enlistees (makes a difference), means of communication, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I just realized that Friday night during the party there was a conversation <br/>
about the U.S. Civil War being the last war fought with Napoleonic strategies, <br/>
and about that war being notable for some changes and some hold-out traditions <br/>
(which weren&#39;t used thereafter).<br/>
<br/>
I was cleaning the kitchen, and not really much into that conversation, but <br/>
my contribution was &quot;Photography!  They had the edge of photography for <br/>
propaganda purposes.&quot;<br/>
