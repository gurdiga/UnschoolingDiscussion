<div id="ygrps-yiv-126747385">Hi, all.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to do this, but I&#39;m going no mail for a while. I&#39;ve had a lot of<br/>
stuff happening lately...and in addition to financial and other<br/>
difficulties, I still have a puberty-stricken pre-teen to deal with and now<br/>
my grandmother is very sick. <br/>
I will miss everyone...and if anyone wants to get in touch with me, write to<br/>
my personal email addy since I already turned off the lists.<br/>
Thanks a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Peace.<br/>
~`*S*`~<br/>
<br/>
