  <div>On another note, did anyone catch the segment on homeschooling on CBS 
  Sunday Morning? It featured a family in New Hampshire and a group in Virginia. 
  Of course one of the main arguments was that there wasn&#39;t enough interaction 
  with people of different views. Hmm, so in ps every student is allowed to 
  explore a different viewpoint other than what teachers are required to teach? 
  Just curious what others thought.<br></div>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t catch all of it, but I never know exactly what to think about homeschooling shows like this since I&#39;m not actually doing it now. I love, though, how the h&#39;sing kids they interviewed are always to friendly and knowledgeable and never come across as defensive (in a bad way) about their schooling.<br>

<div>I wished I could get a transcript/tape of the show, I&#39;d love to know 
exactly what was said&nbsp;... most of the other comments I&#39;ve heard have 
been&nbsp;positive but they (media) always bring up that *S* (SOCIALIZATION) 
issue ... yeh, right like those p-s&#39;rs are the SOCIALIZED ones, ha, just 
turn&nbsp;on the evening news people, HELLO???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I agree w/&nbsp;your statement about&nbsp;h-s&#39;rs being friendly&nbsp;... I 
don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve&nbsp;ever met a h-s&#39;r (we&#39;re very active in our h-s 
community, so I&#39;ve met a lot of h-s&#39;rs) who can&#39;t carry on a decent conversation 
w/ an adult!!!&nbsp; they make eye contact, share ideas, have tons of clever 
ideas about how the world clicks along but I don&#39;t think I can say the same 
thing about&nbsp;most of the p-s&#39;rs I know ... it&#39;s been my experience 
that&nbsp;p-s&#39;rs&nbsp;will usually look @ the ground or above an adults head but 
rarely make&nbsp;direct eye contact ... wonder why???&nbsp; ***SOCIALIZATION*** 
MAYBE???&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>OH AMY, my stars above!!!&nbsp; you&#39;ve been h-s&#39;ing&nbsp;little Accalia for 
the past year but&nbsp;you just don&#39;t&nbsp;realized it; little babies learn from 
the get~go and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re doing a beautiful job w/ your little munchkin @ 
that &lt;G&gt; :)<br>Pris</div>
