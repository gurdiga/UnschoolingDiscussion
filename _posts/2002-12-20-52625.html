&lt;&lt; I guess I feel like if I can try to break the habit, I&#39;ll save them some <br/>
 discomfort or baloney later on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, you&#39;ll just add to their discomfort now. It&#39;s their body, they should <br/>
decide if something is comforting and how long they will keep that comfort.<br/>
The thing about teeth is the baloney part.<br/>
My sister sucked her teeth until she was 10 and has the straightest teeth of <br/>
any of us.....never had braces.<br/>
My oldest son sucked his until 9 or so and has beautiful teeth. I quit at 5 <br/>
and had to have braces!!  One has nothing to do with the other most times.<br/>
If your child is going to have teeth problems, then she will whether or not <br/>
you try to force her to quit comforting herself in a way that helps her.<br/>
Why make an issue of it?  I think emotional health is FAR more important <br/>
anyway.<br/>
