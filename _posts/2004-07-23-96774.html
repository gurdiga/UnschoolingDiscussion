<div id="ygrps-yiv-161905709">I went to look, and found this amusing quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Therefore, to say that &quot;death is a complication of chicken pox&quot;, is like <br/>
saying, &quot;bleeding is a complication of holding a knife in your hand&quot;:&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Below it&#39;s in context.<br/>
And the whole page was here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mercola.com/2001/mar/17/chicken_pox.htm">http://www.mercola.com/2001/mar/17/chicken_pox.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The CDC admits that children don&#39;t die from chicken pox per se, but rather <br/>
&quot;complications&quot; from chicken pox. But what they don&#39;t say is that these <br/>
complications are all derived from acute blood toxemia established by the very <br/>
treatments used by allopathic physicians. So strictly speaking, all children that <br/>
die, do so from the allopathic medical treatments that are used to treat the <br/>
symptoms that accompany chicken pox. There has never been a recorded death among <br/>
the many thousands of children treated Hygienically, and without drugs.<br/>
<br/>
What does the CDC list as the most common complication? <br/>
<br/>
Pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections (caused by the antibiotics). <br/>
Other complications, according to the CDC, include encephalitis (inflamed brain <br/>
tissue mostly from the antipyretics), hemorrhagic complications (such as <br/>
intestinal bleeding, are the most common symptoms of aspirin-an anticoagulant, or <br/>
&quot;blood thinner&quot;), hepatitis (congested and inflamed liver caused by the <br/>
antipyretics), arthritis (decalcification of bone for the calcium needed to neutralize <br/>
acidic blood, mostly caused by the aspirin), and Reye&#39;s syndrome (most <br/>
commonly associated with giving aspirin to children that have chicken pox or <br/>
influenza). <br/>
<br/>
Like aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen (ie. Tylenol) <br/>
will also burden the liver and kidneys and check the vital actions of the body <br/>
to discharge waste from the blood. Acetaminophen poisoning is also common <br/>
because it throws the chemistry of the liver off. In fact, it is the most common <br/>
drug-induced cause of liver failure. It depletes hepatic glutathione, causing <br/>
the toxic metabolite NAPQI to fail to conjugate, which leads to hepatic injury, <br/>
and sometimes death.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, to say that &quot;death is a complication of chicken pox&quot;, is like <br/>
saying, &quot;bleeding is a complication of holding a knife in your hand&quot;: each event <br/>
is neither contingent nor a consequence of the preceding one. Their association <br/>
is artificial; requiring specific intervening actions to take place. In cases <br/>
of chicken pox, actions that are in accord and mandated by standard medical <br/>
practice.</div>

<br/>
The most common complication of severe chickenpox illness in these groups  of <br/>
people is a bacterial infection that can involve many sites of the body  <br/>
including the skin around the blisters, bones, lungs, joints, and the  blood. <br/>
Other serious complications are due to the virus itself infecting the  organs and <br/>
include viral _pneumonia_ <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/lung/pneumonia.html)">http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/lung/pneumonia.html)</a> , bleeding problems, and inflammation of the brain (_encephalitis_ <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474543444">Hi, Jennefer,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the person who wrote the statement you are referring to about blindness and death.  I heard that quote directly from a nurse practitioner at our family doctor&#39;s office.  She said this after I had explained that I wanted to wait on this particular vaccine and expressed doubt about the seriousness of the illness.  She said she had personally seen very severe cases come through their office.  I don&#39;t know where you might find more specific evidence for these claims.  Although she seemed sincere and I didn&#39;t doubt she was telling the truth,  I also believe she was attempting to &quot;scare&quot; me into agreeing to have my youngest (now 8) vaccinated.  I wanted to wait in hopes that my DD would catch it naturally, as her older sister did.  But she still hasn&#39;t caught it, although she&#39;s been in public school up until last spring.  <br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;ve heard from many, many sources that the reaction is more severe the older a child is, I may have her vaccinated one of these days ~ although I also am concerned about the info shared by others on this discussion group that the vaccine doesn&#39;t last forever, can expose and be caught by others, and that the disease can still be caught later in life.  I have heard about some catching it from shingles the elderly sometimes have.  I&#39;ve known a number of elderly people with it, and I wouldn&#39;t wish that painful & dibilitating condition on anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I subscribe to Infectious Diseases, www.infectiousdiseasenews.com, to keep an eye on the whole vaccine issue (although this publication is obviously &quot;pro&quot; vaccine).  You might find something on death or blindness linked to this vaccine in their archives.  <br/>
<br/>
BTY, I learned something the other day from this publication that relates to the other current discussion about rabies and bats.   A recent article (see www.infectiousdiseasenews.com?200407/rabies.asp) stated that for the first time in the 50-year history of solid organ transplantation, three people have died from rabies who received organs from the same donor from Arkasas.  Eight other cases are known of people who died after cornea transplants.  Not to scare anyone.  Thousands of lives are saved every year thru organ transplantation.  Just one of the  interesting facts I learned by subscribing to this publication.  Usually every month, there is at least one article on vaccines.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helped!<br/>
Rhonda<br/>

I don&#39;t believe the CDC is saying the things in the parentheses, just to be  <br/>
clear.  It&#39;s the opinion of the writer/website.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections (caused by the  antibiotics).&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
First of all, who gets an antibiotic for chicken pox anyway?  I  suppose if <br/>
the lesionis got infected a doctor might prescribe a  triple-antibiotic cream, <br/>
but that wouldn&#39;t be what caused the infection, would  it?<br/>
 <br/>
Also, don&#39;t most mothers know by now that you NEVER give a kid aspirin for  a <br/>
fever because of the risk of Reye&#39;s syndrome?  It warns about it right on  <br/>
the bottle.<br/>
 <br/>
I know you were posting about the amusing quote, and it was kind of funny,  <br/>
but I didn&#39;t want to let that paragraph go without applying a little critical  <br/>
thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556552287">See the CDC&#39;s site and search vaccines. Or see the government site <br/>
VAERS: it lists many, many children damaged by vaccines, including <br/>
death. The CDC removed the mandate for babies to be given the <br/>
Hepatitis B vaccine due to the unexpected increase in deaths. <br/>
<br/>
VAERS means Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System. In the <br/>
manufacturing industry&#39;s mandatory drug insert, it is called &quot;post <br/>
marketing research&quot;. That is research, i.e. unknown results. Yes, <br/>
research on our children. I was astounded, disbelieving and abhorrent <br/>
of this system. Many vaccines are &quot;tested&quot; on small groups of <br/>
children in HMOs. The results are extrapolated and then they they are <br/>
further &quot;researched&quot; in the public pediatric environment.<br/>
<br/>
Go to a PDR or physician&#39;s desk reference on-line and look up any <br/>
individual vaccine. You can read this drug insert. You can request <br/>
the drug insert from any pharacist for any drug you are prescribed or <br/>
ask your doctor for the drug insert. The insert lists the number of <br/>
children in the original study and their initial results. No further <br/>
documentation is required in the drug insert to indicate &quot;post <br/>
marketing results&quot;, or side-effects, but occasionally these are <br/>
included when some changes occur in the vaccine. The small size of <br/>
the initial &quot;testing&quot; was certainly disconcerting itself. <br/>
<br/>
There is an informative article in MOTHERING magazine about the lack <br/>
of science supporting the safety and efficacy of vaccines <br/>
called &quot;Show Us the Science&quot; about two years ago. It followed the <br/>
discussion in the Senate about vaccine dangers.<br/>
<br/>
Pat<br/>
<br/>
Appologies since I am not sure this is an &quot;unschooling&quot; topic, but we <br/>
parents are learning not to assume that any &quot;expert&quot; knows what is <br/>
best for our family.<br/>

For the record, I didn&#39;t ask the question...just responded.<br/>
 <br/>
People don&#39;t die from chicken pox. They get other things as a result and  can <br/>
die from those things, from what I&#39;ve read.  I think that was posted  here in <br/>
a quote, too.<br/>

I hear that when people get shingles later in life they almost wish they  <br/>
would die, though!<br/>
