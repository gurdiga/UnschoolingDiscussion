<div id="ygrps-yiv-278946396"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; The beauty of having four <br/>
&gt; girls or boys is that you really no longer have a middle child to feel <br/>
&gt; left out.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have five children.  Devin (now 24) is in the MIDDLE.  We were talking <br/>
about that a couple years ago.  I told him about the middle child thing- and <br/>
he replied that he loved being in the middle - that he got to be involved <br/>
with the older boys, and was still around to do all we did with the younger <br/>
ones.  I was thrilled that he looked at his family placement that way.<br/>
<br/>
I had three boys, one girl then another boy.  We had the kids to have them, <br/>
not to have a particular sex.  People &quot;understood&quot; all my pregnancies til <br/>
that last one - after all I had FINALLY had my girl!!  This isn&#39;t the only <br/>
thing I&#39;ve done that hasn&#39;t been understood by others!!  :-)<br/>
