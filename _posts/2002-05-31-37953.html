&lt;&lt; If I leave her alone about her &quot;studies&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about leaving kids alone, nor is it about &quot;studies.&quot;  It&#39;s <br/>
about living a learning-filled life.  So rather than leave her alone and <br/>
expecting &quot;studies&quot; to materialize, just live with her, be with her, be happy <br/>
and active and involved. <br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s hard with a baby, but leaving a child alone isn&#39;t a good goal, <br/>
nor a virtue.  <br/>
<br/>
When new unschoolers are advised not to teach, that doesn&#39;t mean &quot;leave your <br/>
kids alone.&quot;  <br/>
