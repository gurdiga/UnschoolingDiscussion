<div id="ygrps-yiv-872980788">We are very strongly looking into moving to Redding or nearby in Northern<br/>
California, since our home search in the environs of Los Angeles is pretty<br/>
much a bust, and Redding is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are some Home schoolers there, but are there Unschoolers from<br/>
this list there?<br/>
