&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t imagine being stressed while unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can imagine, and have been, stressed while being an unschooer.  However, the source of the stresses have had to do with life circumstances and occassional personal paradigm shift growth spurts. <br/>
<br/>
I have viewed tham as opportunities for striving to be an example for how to cope with challenging times.  And have been grateful for the peace of not having the artificial routines and constructs of school, and all that entails, which tend to crowd out (imo) the opportunity to work through life circumstance in healthy ways.<br/>
