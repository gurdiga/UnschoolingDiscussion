<div id="ygrps-yiv-221550289">does anyone remember a show that was on PBS in the 70&#39;s, usually at<br/>
the same time of day as Electric Company, Sesame Street and Mr.<br/>
Rogers.  I believe it was called Vi Allegra, although I am not<br/>
positive of the name.  The opening sequence showed an overhead shot of<br/>
a city with a carnival, ferris wheel and some other things, if I<br/>
remember correct.  Does anyone know the show?  Do I have the name right?<br/>

<br/>
Villa Allegre!<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought of that for years.<br/>
<br/>
Villa Allegre doesn&#39;t translate really well, but kinda means &quot;happy  <br/>
place.&quot;<br/>
Joyful large estate out of town, maybe, more literally.<br/>
<br/>
It was a bilingual program.  I remember the theme song, musically,  <br/>
and where the name of the show comes, but I don&#39;t know the Spanish  <br/>
words.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895107379">I think it was Viva Allegre!  I used to watch it every day.  My school was<br/>
doing an experimental bilingual program at the time and all of us K-3rd<br/>
graders got lots of Spanish immersion in the classroom.  My brother who was<br/>
already in the 4th grade didn&#39;t get Spanish lessons -  I thought Viva<br/>
Allegre was just for me!<br/>
