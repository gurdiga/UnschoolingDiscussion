<div id="ygrps-yiv-692893905">Noelle lost a schoolbook at our house.  We found it and my DH called <br/>
her to tell her and see how she was doing.  He told her we found her <br/>
book and asked her how her parents were treating her.<br/>
<br/>
DH said she sounded very cheerful and happy and said her parents were <br/>
treating her well. (But what else would she say?)DH said she sounded <br/>
very happy to be home.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all we&#39;ve heard for now.<br/>
