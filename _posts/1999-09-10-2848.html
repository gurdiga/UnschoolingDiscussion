&lt;&lt;&lt;I burst into tears every time I read &quot;Love You Forever&quot; by Robert Munsch.<br/>
My<br/>
children watch me carefully when I read it because they know the waterworks<br/>
will<br/>
start.  It is too hard for me to read much.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I went to amazon.com to look into this book. Just the description of the<br/>
book and the reviews had me bawling. I am ordering it this week for sure. My<br/>
oldest (7) has told me that he wants to live with me when he grows up and<br/>
has said that he will take care of me when I am old. He is so sweet. I wish<br/>
I had (lots of things, but this time) trusted myself more when he was a baby<br/>
and known folks who did attachment parenting.  I have taken to carrying my<br/>
very spirited 3 yr old around a lot more and she is calmer. Just wanted to<br/>
write a little thanks to you folks.  I don&#39;t always agree with everything I<br/>
see here but I find information and support  that is hard to come by<br/>
outside.  And Joel, I am working on a clear answer to your question, just<br/>
don&#39;t have much time to think these days. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
