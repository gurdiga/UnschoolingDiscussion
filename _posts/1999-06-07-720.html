 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know how you or anyone defines &quot;completely unschooling&quot;, but if there<br/>
is such a thing, we&#39;re doing it or are it or something.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are learning whatever they&#39;re doing whenever.<br/>
<br/>
So are the adults.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, We are. I feel that life is educational. As the old saying goes...&quot;You <br/>
learn something new everyday.&quot; Today I learned that I can&#39;t function well <br/>
when the temperature gets above 90 degrees. Or is it the humidity that&#39;s <br/>
making me crazy? Anyway, I feel like my mind and body both are traveling in <br/>
slow motion.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been thinking about this, and decided to answer it.  I am completely<br/>
unschooling, although my boys are not yet &quot;school age.&quot;  But I decided that<br/>
this counts as well, as it is good practice for having confidence in my<br/>
children&#39;s abitlity to learn and grow all on their own, and with their own<br/>
impetus.  Starting at this age (15 months and 29 months) looking at<br/>
learning from the Unschooling perspective, I will never have to adjust my<br/>
thinking from having &quot;students&quot; in public school to having students of<br/>
their own lives.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I will most probably have to deal with deschooling anyway, as the<br/>
little girl we are trying to adopt is in Second grade in public school.  I<br/>
am nervous about how she will take the transition, and whether she will be<br/>
happy with it.  The fact that she is going to be coming into a new family<br/>
at the same time is an added complication, and I feel I may need to give<br/>
her some form of a cirriculum in order to help make the transition less<br/>
abrupt.  I wnat her to be able to ease into her new life and family, like<br/>
curling up in a warm lap in front of a toasty fire.  I don&#39;t want her to<br/>
feel cold and all alone, like leaping into an icy lake.  Any suggestions on<br/>
easing the transition?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we are in the middle of our homestudy and have asked our Case<br/>
Worker to get in touch with the CW of the little girl we are interested in<br/>
to find out more about her and whether she is a good match for us.  We are<br/>
keeping our fingers crossed.....<br/>

Well I know nothing of adoption or taking a child out of school. I do<br/>
know unschooling though and it seems like a wonderful way to introduce a<br/>
new member into the family by having the time for them to curl up in a<br/>
lap. By letting them have time to do what makes them feel comfortable.<br/>
By not having to shuffle them out the door in a new situation before<br/>
they have adjusted. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do just fine with her. And how<br/>
wonderful for her to have this opportunity. Good Luck.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being that she is has already been in school. My approach would be to talk<br/>
to her about her feelings concerning school. Find out what she liked/didn&#39;t<br/>
like and then show her that there is another way. Take however long to just<br/>
travel around the area, neighborhood/city. Go to the places that would<br/>
interest her or things you would like to share with her.  Spend time<br/>
reading, cooking, whatever your day would entail and whatever follows her<br/>
interests. <br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, you could point out how all this was educational.  The biggest<br/>
hurdle would probably be finding friends her age. So many children feel<br/>
that school is the only place to find friends.  <br/>
<br/>
*I* would also hold off on any curriculum unless she requested it. Then<br/>
maybe you could follow her lead...<br/>
