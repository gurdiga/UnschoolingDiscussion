<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075923226">My two oldest children, 3 and 5, have recently discovered games such <br/>
as Go Fish, Old Maid, Memory (the card game) and such. Since this <br/>
time my 5yos has started to display poor loosing manners. If it looks <br/>
like he is loosing the game or will loose the game he will have a <br/>
fit, throw his cards down and sit and pout. I finally told him that <br/>
the behavior was not appropriate and that everyone wins sometimes and <br/>
everyone looses sometimes. Tonight I ended up sending him to bed <br/>
early because he would not sit still during the game of Memory we <br/>
were playing and he kept messing up the cards we had laid on the <br/>
floor. Finally, after telling him repeatedly that he needed to sit <br/>
still and quit jumping around I made him sit out of the game. He sat <br/>
on the opposate side of the room while DD and I finished the game. At <br/>
the start of the next game I told him that if he would sit still then <br/>
he could come and join the game with us which he decided not to. And <br/>
that was fine except that he kept complaining that he wanted to play <br/>
the game but &quot;Mommy won&#39;t let me.&quot; I repeated that he could play with <br/>
us, and that we wanted him to play with us, and that he would have to <br/>
sit still and that all his jumping around was messing up the cards.<br/>
Anyway, after his repeated complaining I finally sent him to bed. I <br/>
know a lot of his problem was that he was tired. I guess what I want <br/>
to know is this type of behavior normal for a 5yob. This is not the <br/>
first time he has had a fit over loosing a game and lately he seems <br/>
to be doing things that he knows he is not supposed to and then gets <br/>
angery with me when I disapline him. It has been going on for about a <br/>
month now and I&#39;m really getting tired of it. I just don&#39;t know if it <br/>
is a phase he is going through or if I should be wondering if <br/>
something else is on his mind. Any suggestion? Corallyn</div>

<div>Hi Corallyn,</div>
<div>I had this problem with my DD when she was around the same age (5).&nbsp; I 
finally just let her win a few games as did my older DD (10 at the time).&nbsp; 
It made her feel better about herself and she was able to &quot;lose&quot; more 
gracefully!&nbsp; She still got frustrated when she lost, and she still does 
sometimes now, so I just let her win when I play a game with her.</div>
<div>I notice that you have 2 around the same age, so it may not be fair to ask 
the other child to lose for the sake of her brother.&nbsp; Maybe play a game 
with him yourself and let him win.&nbsp; </div>
<div>Someone else may have a better solution.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414742345">Hi Corallyn <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had the same problem with Zak... Except instead of pouting he cries real <br/>
tears that it&#39;s not fair that he doesn&#39;t win all the time.  We are working on <br/>
this as well.  I&#39;ve figured out that trying to explain most things to my 5 <br/>
year old is like explaining Nuclear Fusion to somebody who only uses their <br/>
left brain (or is that right LOL)... His attention span is short when <br/>
explanations are given unless he wants to know how to do something.  I <br/>
usually say &quot;well maybe you&#39;ll win next time, sweetie&quot; and of course I give <br/>
him a cuddle and say &quot;I see that you are feeling really sad about not <br/>
winning, what could we do about that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Working outside the home was so so so so easy compared with raising children. <br/>
 Everyday it&#39;s some other battle I seem to be waging with this little person <br/>
who seems to have lots of power. I&#39;m very thankful the other one is only <br/>
11months old.  However soon, he&#39;ll be demanding his own way all the time.<br/>

<p>I asked my DD about this.&nbsp; She&#39;s 10 now, but she went through the same 
phase of being a poor loser.&nbsp; She admitted that she would get very 
frustrated when she lost and I asked her what made her change her mind?&nbsp; 
She said that she would just tell herself that there would be other games that 
she would win and that it wasn&#39;t that important.&nbsp; She would tell herself 
that it was more important that she was having fun!&nbsp; I just thought I would 
share straight from the source!</p>
