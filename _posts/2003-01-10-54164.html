<div id="ygrps-yiv-152468555">**Do you give that same response to your husband if he asks you to butter<br/>
his toast, or do something for him, or to a friend? Haven&#39;t you ever <br/>
asked anyone to do something for you that you can actually do yourself? <br/>
I am bit surprised by your comments. You sound so cold!**<br/>
<br/>
Everyone sounds colder and flatter in email, I find.  And talking about<br/>
personalities can make the discussion here deteriorate pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**If what we want is to build a relationship based on trust and<br/>
understanding, the attitude that they *should* do it themselves when<br/>
they ask for help (read support, love, companionship, comfort,<br/>
togetherness, etc.) certainly doesn&#39;t help. I am not sure where you are<br/>
coming from and what kind of relationship you want to establish with<br/>
your kids, but from what you say I get the impression that it&#39;s one of<br/>
total *independence* (read distance) from each other.**<br/>
<br/>
I think this might fit Joyce&#39;s point that we may treat our children<br/>
differently because we have different *goals*.  The goal of early<br/>
independence is such a strong current in American culture that we may<br/>
not even realize that it is there.  I appreciate your posts because I<br/>
think it&#39;s really worthwhile to think about the cultural messages that<br/>
we get that really discourage nurturing.  I think the goal of sweetly<br/>
loving our children and the goal of making them independent at early or<br/>
&quot;appropriate&quot; ages certainly can conflict with each other.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS  And the economic goal of full employment for adults, that leads us<br/>
to require young adults to stay in school longer and longer, that goal<br/>
conflicts with the goal of early independence.  If I were a teen, it<br/>
would make me crazy angry, I think.</div>

Lots of great points you made about children being pushed at young ages toward independence.  Sounds like we are a society that is afraid to love.  I guess the reason we are all so passionate about keeping our children out of school is that we know we all need to love one another more than anything else.  <br/>
