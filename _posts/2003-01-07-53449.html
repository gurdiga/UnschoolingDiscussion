They&#39;re wonderful you&#39;re right, they are among my favorite books ever.<br/>

When I was in college one of my professors saw me reading Palace of<br/>
Desire and stopped to talk about it.  He asked if didn&#39;t I think it was<br/>
a bit open ended?  I gently explained to him that it was a trilogy and<br/>
he laughed - I still haven&#39;t read the third one either, it&#39;s hard to<br/>
find in my small town (I try to shop locally).<br/>

Yesterday one of my cherubs removed my book mark from Palace of Desire.  At <br/>
first I was a little pissed, but then I was pleased because I got to re-read <br/>
some passages to figure out where I was.<br/>

In their defense, the book mark is a strip of paint colors from the hardware <br/>

Maybe all those young unschooled filmmakers will immortalize unschooling<br/>

Just this morning as my husband was getting ready for work, I was admiring <br/>
the one single piece of wall-art on our bedroom wall.  It&#39;s a mirror with a <br/>
nice print (decal, I guess, but maybe baked on) of Asterix and Obelix with <br/>
his menhir.  I&#39;ve had it for over 20 years.  Got it in England.  Keith and I <br/>
first read Asterix comics together and we still have all of them, and got a <br/>
couple of newer ones lately.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading _In the Arena,_ the autobiography of Charlton Heston, and a very <br/>
good book on the making of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  And various places <br/>
in there I find bits of trivia about what&#39;s coming in the third movie, when <br/>
they&#39;re talking about sets and special effects and miniatures.<br/>

boards at Unschooling.com They just don&#39;t know they&#39;re unschooling!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just finished Wally Lamb&#39;s &quot;I Know This Much is True&quot;, which is long, <br/>
but pulled me right along. It&#39;s first-person by a brother who is <br/>
dealing with a schizophrenic twin, and his past.<br/>
<br/>
Am now reading &quot;Fall On Your Knees&quot; by Ann-Marie MacDonald which is <br/>
quite good as well. It&#39;s a bit outside my usual genre - a family saga <br/>
set in Nova Scotia - but the writing is so good I am really enjoying <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t already read &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; by Barbara <br/>
Kingsolver, that&#39;s on my all-time top 3 list, and I want to re-read <br/>
it soon.<br/>
