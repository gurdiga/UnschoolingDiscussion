<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>15 Dec 2002, at 10:50am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194011332">I have been reading the archives, and I came across this recent thread.<br/>
<br/>
What a relief to find it!!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been vaciliting back and forth between &quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;relaxed homeschooling&quot; and I thought it was more because *I* was having a problem.  So, I decided I must not be an unschooler after all.<br/>
<br/>
But I think the reason is because my kids repeatedly toss the idea around of going back to ps.<br/>
<br/>
I only want them to be prepared if they go (just like I want them to be prepared if they were to go camping).  They never seem definite about it but the possibility that they&#39;ll go is always there.  My daughter did go back to school this year for a short time and then left because of a school bully and because it wasn&#39;t what she remembered from first grade.  Now she&#39;s talking about going back next year...but every day is different.<br/>
<br/>
My son wanted to go back to high school next year and for the first time, he is interested in tolerating a Saxon math book in order to &quot;be prepared&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I guess thats still unschooling though, since I&#39;m just trying to help them get to where they are going.  Am I right?<br/>

<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

camping trip that you may or may not take?<br/>
<br/>
Preparing for camping usually happens when you have a specific time and place <br/>
picked out.  A couple of weeks before hand you might go shopping for a tent, <br/>
and do a little research about the location.  A few days before hand you <br/>
might make your grocery list and the day before you&#39;ll probably go to the <br/>
store and pick up the food.  <br/>
<br/>
What sense would it make to take once-a-week trips to the grocery store for <br/>
years preparing for a weekend camping trip?<br/>
<br/>
Going back to school can be *just* like preparing for a camping trip.  Set a <br/>
date, pick a place, figure out what you need to bring, then go and get it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140226569">I guess thats the part I&#39;m having trouble &quot;figuring out&quot;.  How much do we have to cover, how often, and in what format for him to &quot;be prepared&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Same with writing.  How much writing is enough?  <br/>
<br/>
He might think he is prepared and want to stop working at it, but what if I know differently?  I guess I could just give him the information and let him decide how important it is to him.<br/>
<br/>
And there is that nagging worry that he would be labeled an &quot;unschooling failure&quot; simply because most people in this area are &quot;school at homers&quot;.  I admit it, that concerns me.  I don&#39;t want my kids to suffer because of others&#39; ignorance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890303160">By the way...on this same note:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all for unschooling.  But if my other kids start talking about school, or start talking about learning something, (math for example) in a formal way, the way its done in school, do you have suggestions for something I could keep on hand?<br/>
<br/>
I have a saxon book but it is so repetitive.  I&#39;m thinking Key To might be a good one to have around, because that way if someone is interested in learning fractions the way their friends do, they could just pick it up.  Key to is pretty self explanatory.<br/>
<br/>
But again, it would be their choice to use it, not use it, or just use a little of it.<br/>

don&#39;t send them to school.<br/>
School will be even MORE ignorant if every unschooling family &#39;stays up with <br/>
school&#39; just in case.  There would BE no unschooling if we all try to keep up <br/>
with school.<br/>
<br/>
IF your children really want to go to school, they can &quot;cram&quot; at the last <br/>
minute, practicing spelling or handwriting or whatever.  Or you can help them <br/>
be confident enough to go there and say, &quot;No, I was playing D&D while you <br/>
were practicing penmanship, but I can catch up.&quot;<br/>

I haven&#39;t checked the &quot;files&quot; section yet.  will do that next.  I will also do a google search myself.  Google is just SOOOO good at finding sites though, I&#39;m not always sure where to begin.<br/>
<br/>
I will say this much though.  I just took my daughter and her ps friend out to lunch. While we were there, we somehow got on the subject of math (I think the friend brought it up).  She started talking about math trees (I figured out that we are talking about family fact trees, or whatever they&#39;re called).  My daughter didn&#39;t know what we were talking about so I showed her, and voila, in 5 minutes she knew what a fact family tree was.<br/>
<br/>
Then we talked about &quot;5 to the second power&quot;.  So, I said..&quot;here, this is what 5 to the second power looks like, and this is what it means&quot;.  Voila, in 1 minute, she understood.<br/>

<br/>
The girls were playing with their straws, you know, dipping it in their sodas and putting their fingers on the end of the straw.  We started theorizing on why the soda does not come out of the straw.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter knew why.  My daughter&#39;s friend said &quot;I am not learning that in Science yet&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting.  But it just goes to demonstrate that a school scope and sequence is not the alpha and omega of learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367479542">&lt;&lt; But if my other kids start talking about school, or start talking<br/>
about <br/>
learning something, (math for example) in a formal way, the way its done<br/>
in <br/>
school, do you have suggestions for something I could keep on hand? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For kids up to 8th Grade (I think) there is that series of books, What<br/>
Your ___th Grader Needs to Know.  They are pretty straightforward.  Any<br/>
library should have them.  Check them out and let your child look them<br/>
over if the issue comes up.<br/>
<br/>
(I realize the original poster was talking about high school, so this<br/>
answer is really aimed at other people who have the same issue, but with<br/>
younger kids.)<br/>
<br/>
In California there are very, very intimidating &quot;learning standards&quot; for<br/>
each grade and subject posted on the Department of Education website. <br/>
Take them with a grain of salt.  Not every student in this state is<br/>
close to performing on that level.  Standards are catching on in many<br/>
states, so you can search the &#39;net for the standards for your state.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518877889">THat is an interesting perspective, and was the one I used when my daughter went back this year for a short time.  I told her she could come home at any time, and she knew it when she was on the playground and was being bullied.  In fact, I think she announced she was going home LOL.<br/>
<br/>
But I worry about how it will impact homeschooling or unschooling in general.  The media, the schools, the naysayers all like to hunt for that *one* case that they can refer to as the example of failure.  They like to use it as an excuse for increased harassment, increased legislation, increased negativity.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to give them an excuse.  I live here in PA.  I have been very active in getting new legislation passed, etc.  I have talked until I&#39;m blue with others about overcompliance, etc.  I have challenged my district on more than one occasion, and I&#39;m in a GOOD district!!  How will it affect others to see my kids &quot;behind&quot; even if it doesn&#39;t bother US?<br/>

<br/>
If your kids had gone back to the public schools as homeschool poster <br/>
children, ended up at the top of their classes, teachers insisted <br/>
that they skipped grades because they were so far ahead, and teachers <br/>
wrote articles in papers saying that all people should homeschool <br/>
because your children are so smart, HB2560 still wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
passed.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works.  If you believe that it works, if it is a <br/>
principle that you believe in and, and if it&#39;s the kind of freedom <br/>
you want your children to have, then I think you should give it to <br/>
them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-107131532">My daughter decided she wanted to learn Algebra. She&#39;s 12, btw. So we <br/>
talked about it, why she wanted to this, etc. I explained to her that <br/>
she could do everything from using the computer to waiting until she was <br/>
older and could take a class at the community college. She wants to it <br/>
now - she wants to go to college, and her two interests are science and <br/>
acting, so she talks to other kids, esp. those in gifted ed. programs <br/>
who are her age, and kids a grade or two ahead of her age, and pays <br/>
attention to what these other kids are doing in public school. She <br/>
doesn&#39;t worry at all about science or writing, because she can see that <br/>
she is doing much more than they are. But she wanted Algebra. Finally, <br/>
what she settled on was a straight forward math textbook. These are <br/>
quite difficult to find, as the new type of text has lots of <br/>
&quot;enrichment&quot; stuff in them. I went to ebay and found an old (1991) <br/>
Dolciani book and ordered both the book and the teacher&#39;s text. She <br/>
likes it fine, and is working through the book on her own. She is aware <br/>
of the fact that it is up to her, and she can do it or not. This is the <br/>
only traditional style textbook that she uses, and it is entirely her <br/>
choice, and she can choose to put it away anytime she wants. btw, she <br/>
has decided that she has no interest whatsoever in going to a <br/>
traditional high school - feels it would be an enormous waste of her <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
She also wants to do more with history, but doesn&#39;t really like it, so I <br/>
suggested that she try reading biographies, since she seems to really <br/>
enjoy this, loves to watch biography shows on tv, and she likes that <br/>
idea a lot, so she has been checking biographies out of the library. She <br/>
decides what she wants to learn, and we often discuss how she can get to <br/>
where she wants. Other times, she simply decides herself, and sometimes <br/>
asks for my help and sometimes not. Sometimes she tries something, an <br/>
approach or a topic, and doesn&#39;t like it, and so stops and tries <br/>
something else. For example, she wants to learn French, has tried a few <br/>
different approaches, but hasn&#39;t found one she likes yet.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I had always liked a good math book, but always hated that I <br/>
couldn&#39;t skip ahead if I &quot;got it&quot; - she can do as much or as little as <br/>
she wants. We&#39;ve also talked about math, that the idea is &quot;to get it&quot;, <br/>
to be able to understand it and use it, not to simply do a page of <br/>
problems and pass the test, and have little or no understanding of what <br/>
the material was about. Math is a tool, a language, very useful stuff if <br/>
you actually understand it and use it. A math book can be a good tool,  <br/>
but it is not the beginning and end of mathematics, and much can be <br/>
learned without one. If you want to pursue an interest in science or <br/>
math, you will sooner or later need some formal mathematics. But how and <br/>
when varies as much as the person and their needs and interests. I was <br/>
in sports science for awhile, loved it, and had lots of math. Hubby was <br/>
a journalist, and the extent of his formal math was high school math, <br/>
which he hated, and what he knows and needs now is to balance the <br/>
checkbook and manage personal finances, and what he needs for his <br/>
interest in sports.<br/>
<br/>
I think you can &quot;monitor&quot; what sort of things are &quot;covered&quot; (according <br/>
to the ps) in ps high school, and then choose to do it any way that you <br/>
like - and I don&#39;t mean that you even have to do their curriculum, but <br/>
only what you need to do to meet whatever requirements your state has. <br/>
We also look at things from the long perspective - 12 yo dd wants to go <br/>
to college, but doesn&#39;t know if she wants to go when she&#39;s 16 or wait <br/>
until she&#39;s older - so she has lots of time to get there, and plenty of <br/>
time to do what she wants and what she needs, and she can choose how to <br/>
do it and how to get there. And of course, the time and freedom to <br/>
change her mind as often as she likes.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

&gt; For kids up to 8th Grade (I think) there is that series of books, What<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; In California there are very, very intimidating &quot;learning standards&quot; for<br/>
&gt; each grade and subject posted on the Department of Education website.<br/>
&gt; Take them with a grain of salt.  Not every student in this state is<br/>
&gt; close to performing on that level.  Standards are catching on in many<br/>
&gt; states, so you can search the &#39;net for the standards for your state.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559083945">Well, if you live in a state that requires a portfolio including <br/>

and take the chance of getting caught, fined, thrown in jail, and <br/>

I find that if we save brochures and if I keep my eyes open for some <br/>
things I can photocopy, I can usually find enough to fill a portfolio <br/>

This year, I have PA history covered because we took the boys to the <br/>

the freedom trail. If I think hard enough I&#39;ll remember some other <br/>
thigns that qualify as history, probably.  I&#39;ll probably make a <br/>
collage of brochures.  For science I have a few experiments we did, <br/>
she did a &quot;science projects to do with your cat&quot; activity packet I&#39;ll <br/>
probably be able to use, and a trip to a science museum.  I have <br/>
geography covered because of Top Secret Adventures I can photocopy, I <br/>
have math covered because of mathmania I can photocopy.  I have <br/>
writing covered because I secretly photocopied some penpal letters.  <br/>
Fire Safety is covered because we went to a fire safety day at a <br/>
Christian camp.  The fire chief there sent out impressive letters <br/>
explaining everything that was covered (for the benefit of <br/>
portfolios) .  For art, I guess I&#39;ll take pictures of some projects.  <br/>

<br/>
 He doesn&#39;t feel as strongly about homeschooling as I do, and although I&#39;ve dropped informative hints here and there about unschooling, and he agrees with things I&#39;ve said, he would have a panic attack if I told him the scope of unschooling we&#39;ve used or actually called it &quot;unschooling&quot;.<br/>

  You couldn&#39;t pay me enough to live in PA.  If I had lived there when I <br/>
  started homeschooling, I would move.  Seriously.  I don&#39;t know why more <br/>
  people don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  But I move at the drop of a hat, anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234581658">I don&#39;t think you have to think like them.  I refuse to let the law <br/>
dictate how I parent my children.  (And I see unschooling as an <br/>
extension of parenting, not as something seperate).  What you do have <br/>
to do is understand how they think.  Not too hard for anyone who grew <br/>
up in public school.  Easier yet for me because my parents are both <br/>
teachers. The key is to make what you do look like what they do.  And <br/>
don&#39;t think about it every day, or it will consume you.  Just push it <br/>
to the back of your mind and bring up the file on how to speak <br/>
educationese and build an impressive portfolio in the spring.  <br/>
Vaguely be aware of it throughout the year, maybe with a pile <br/>
somewhere where you throw stuff that looks like what they do in <br/>
school, but don&#39;t get into the pile or worry about what&#39;s there until <br/>
spring.  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re too narrow-minded to be able to think outside of their <br/>
institutional boxes and even begin to understand unschooling, so we <br/>
have to spoon feed them.  Look what we did for geography!  Look what <br/>
we learned for science!  Doesn&#39;t that look impressive?  Doesn&#39;t some <br/>
of that look a lot like what your students did in your institution?  <br/>
There, we must be almost as good as you.  <br/>
<br/>
And hopefully they&#39;ll leave you alone and you won&#39;t have to think <br/>
about it for another year. <br/>

Samples don&#39;t just mean workbook pages and math text answers<br/>

I am an unschooler in Pennsylvania who have never had any trouble <br/>
with the law.  I live in a *good* district. (which could change with <br/>
one change of personnel in the school district)  However, I have <br/>
spoken to MANY people in districts neighboring mine who have chosen <br/>

several people who have had good reason to be fearful.  <br/>
