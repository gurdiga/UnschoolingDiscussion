<div id="ygrps-yiv-40128487">My daughter attended a Waldorf school K-2nd grade and home/unschooled ever since. She&#39;s now 17 and if she were in school, this fall would be the beginning of her senior year.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been talking a lot lately about going back to school this last year, partially because she&#39;d like to experience it before it&#39;s too late and partially because the idea of a ready-made group seems nice to her. <br/>
<br/>
Have any of you had experience with a Waldorf high school? How about kids going back to school for just one, last year? I see both positive and negative aspects to it.<br/>
<br/>
We have to act quickly on this because she&#39;s just been accepted to the Not Back to School Camp and we have to let them know right away if she&#39;s going or not. I hate to have her miss this experience, but I&#39;m trying to be sensitive to her needs.<br/>
