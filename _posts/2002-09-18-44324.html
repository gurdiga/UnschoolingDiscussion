<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679466144">Just this morning I went to the school to meet with them in regards <br/>
to my son&#39;s IEP...deciding what we would do with it, if anythig.  I <br/>
prepared myself for a battering...and it is essentially what I got <br/>
in a &quot;polite&quot; manner.  I was considering taking my son to the school <br/>
to still receive speech and OT services.  Prior to my unschooling <br/>
decision I was going to also take him for reading and math services <br/>
(more husband&#39;s concern), but had been leaning away from that.  They <br/>
made it clear to me that they were totally baffled by my decision <br/>
and could not understand how I expected anything to work with them.  <br/>
The principal came in and gave her speech about &quot;when education came <br/>
along, we were moved off the farms, and while it is nice to spend <br/>
time at home with your mother, we got away from that.&quot;  I stood my <br/>
ground that my decision was a sound one.  Under the guise of the <br/>
words, &quot;I respect your decision&quot; the condescending tone was clearly <br/>
felt.  I was told that her thoughts on homeschooling was basically <br/>
that &quot;it stinks.&quot;  I explained my sons symptoms and plummeting self-<br/>
esteem and I received the &quot;Oh we don&#39;t let that happen and when we <br/>
see inappropriate things...we...&quot;  I was also told that my son was <br/>
already placed in a classroom and that they had a grand plan for <br/>
him, but with so many 3rd graders, the special needs must be grouped <br/>
together to better accomodate the special needs team.  By the end of <br/>
the meeting the principal told me that if I could get my son&#39;s self-<br/>
esteem back up she would like to see him back in school by the mid <br/>
term and that if he is too far behind they can just put him in 2nd <br/>
instead of 3rd.  I feel like holding my breath!  My son&#39;s 2nd grade <br/>
teacher(from last year)gave me the speech on socialization.  &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
make him a loner so that he sees himself as different because of <br/>
that.&quot;  What part did they not hear??  I guess I shouldn&#39;t have been <br/>
there at all.  I thought it would be important to at least get <br/>
speech and OT, but I don&#39;t even know about that now.  When I <br/>
mentioned him coming in 1 time per week, the principal told that <br/>
would be babysitting and she wouldn&#39;t agree to it, so I said none at <br/>
all.  We spent the rest of our day playing...at the youth center <br/>
while the kids prepared for gymnastics, I watched the adult <br/>
supervision greet the incoming children (ones at school all day) <br/>
with a &quot;YOU GOT HOMEWORK?  I DON&#39;T WANT NO NOISE!&quot;  And as I looked <br/>
at the resident hamster with my kids I tiptoed past the noiseless <br/>
kids trying to fill out one more worksheet or one last <br/>
assignment...and a child whispered to me &quot;is slack a word?&quot;  I <br/>
nodded and felt sorrow for their circumstances.  As we left the <br/>
homework room, I saw a poster on the wall with the title, &quot;10 Global <br/>
Imperatives for Children&quot;, as I scanned through them, I got stuck on <br/>
number 7, &quot;Education for the children, every child, boy or girl, <br/>
should be allowed to learn.&quot; And that was it.  <br/>
Blessings,<br/>

In the time period she&#39;s talking about, an average home on the prairie<br/>
would have had, for reading materials, a bible and the Sears catalog. <br/>
In this decade, the above-average homeschooling home has a heck of a lot<br/>
more to offer than that.  In some subjects, I&#39;ll bet my home has more<br/>
books, and better books than the school does.  And I have a better<br/>
collection of &quot;educational&quot; videos to boot!  I also have 24/7 access to<br/>
the internet.<br/>

<br/>
Right, her goal was clearly to change your decision to one that suited<br/>
her.  Some educators would prefer that parents send kids to public<br/>
school without exception.  These folks would prefer for parents to have<br/>
no say at all.<br/>

<br/>
RIGHT!.<br/>
<br/>
And if the school DOES have internet access, how long would it take a kid to <br/>
get an answer to a question?  Can they bring it up right then, in that room, <br/>
without asking, getting a pass to the library, whatever all?<br/>
<br/>
We also have the ability to take kids somewhere if they&#39;re tired, bored, need <br/>
exercise, want to see something they&#39;re misremembering, or just eat a new, <br/>
bigger and better lunch.<br/>
<br/>
One day when Holly was thinking about kids in school being uncomfortable or <br/>
sad, she suggested to me they should just eat a really big lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Kids in school don&#39;t even have the option to eat a really big lunch!!<br/>
