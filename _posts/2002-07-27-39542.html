contradicting your statement about the support behind open classrooms. I <br/>
wasn&#39;t. Not sure what I was trying to say other than the open classroom <br/>
model has this awful reputation of FAILURE all over it. It&#39;s one of the <br/>
things that was causing the pendulum to swing so far the other way with <br/>
programs like Accelerated Learning and Core Knowledge and such. The <br/>
education scene in Boulder was very weird.<br/>

YES.  &quot;The Three R&#39;s&quot; talk started right about then.<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching I would have parents ask me to give more homework.  They <br/>
thought homework was what created learning.  They also didn&#39;t know what to do <br/>
with their kids except feed them, make them do homework, get them to wash up <br/>
and go to bed at a certain time.  I said they learned a lot in class.  The <br/>
parents wanted to know how it was proveable without papers to show.   It&#39;s <br/>
not that they never wrote or we never had tests, its just that even in the <br/>
space of a week or an hour some people want documentation, not any fuzzy <br/>
vague &quot;I know he&#39;s learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The <br/>
education scene in Boulder was very weird.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Northern N. Mex. too.  And it&#39;s not the conservatives who tend toward social <br/>
jobs like teaching, counseling, working with kids in ANY way.  Those jobs are <br/>
generally for liberals.  Conservatives just bitch about everything they do <br/>
and how they do it.<br/>
