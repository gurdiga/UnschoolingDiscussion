<div id="ygrps-yiv-686715575">Hi.  I just want to than everyone that responded to my post <br/>
earlier, about my 11 year old wanting out of public school.  You are <br/>
all so wonderfully supportive and encouraging.<br/>
 I also want to update you.  My 11 year old boy, again, requested to <br/>
stay home and homeschool (more like, demanded.)  He wants to go today <br/>
to say goodbye to a good friend, but wants to stay at home beginning <br/>
tomorrow.  My other two children, ages 9 1/2, and 8 (boy, girl)  are <br/>
not quite there, yet.  My 9 1/2 wants to finish out the year, and my <br/>
8 year old wants to finish this week.  I don&#39;t know whether to take <br/>
them out all at the same time, or just the oldest and youngest, and <br/>
let the 9 1/2 year old finish out the year.<br/>
  Also, if you wonderful people have any suggestions, as to what to <br/>
write in the letter to the principal, as far as keeping them home and <br/>
homeschooling, I&#39;d appreciate it.  The principal seems to be a <br/>
wonderful lady, don&#39;t know how to word it.  Again, thanks for all of <br/>
your support, and encouragement. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110963736">As far as what you should say to the principle, I&#39;d just say this is <br/>
&quot;the best choice&quot; for your child. Keep it simple. As far as what to <br/>
write...keep that simple, too. I wrote something like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My (daughter or son), (name), will not be attending (school name) in <br/>
January 2001. (Her/his) last day at (school name) will be (date). <br/>
Please remove (him/her) from the attendance list for the rest of the <br/>
2001 school year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it. Simple as that. At least in Michigan it&#39;s that simple, <br/>
don&#39;t know if you need to do something different in Indiana.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if your 9 1/2 year old wants to finish off the year, let him do <br/>
it. Others may disagree and say to take him out now. But, I say, be <br/>
flexible --- he may just change his mind when he is the only one <br/>
in the family that is getting up and leaving for school in the <br/>
morning!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. <br/>

<br>Well, congratulations.
<br>
<br>Hope they are all home soon --- if that&#39;s what they want.
<br>
<br>My letter to the principal was actually a letter of intent to hs sent to the 
<br>Superintendent (that&#39;s what we do in Florida). &nbsp;It was a 2 line letter (I 
<br>think) saying: &nbsp;We are withdrawing out son X from Y school as of today. &nbsp;His 
<br>birthday is XXX (required here). He will be homeschooled.
<br>
<br>Copy to the principal.
<br>
<br>You don&#39;t have to explain anything, if you don&#39;t want to. &nbsp;I figured they 
<br>knew what was going on, or should have.
<br>
<br>Actually, the individual people I dealt with thru the whole ps experience 
<br>were lovely people. &nbsp;The programs they had to offer were inadequate -- that 
<br>was the problem.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826665413">Annette: I took my kids out at different times, and I<br/>
think it was a good thing. My daughter didn&#39;t feel<br/>
ready, but after 3 weeks, she was. During that time, I<br/>
had some good one-on-one with my son. <br/>
<br/>
I just told the principal face to face, and she asked<br/>
me to write something. I just wrote, &quot;I will be<br/>
homeschooling Erik started January 20, 2000.&quot; And I<br/>
signed my name. She was satisfied. In fact, she told<br/>
me she thought it was a great thing for Erik. Juli<br/>

<div><font face="Pooh">Since the kids requested it, follow their wishes. When the 
9.5 yr old is ready (I suspect soon enough rather than wait til the end of the 
year), go ahead and take them out. </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Pooh">As to writing to the school principal, tell her your kids 
have requested to be homeschooled and state which ones, Thank her for all the 
help she has given in the past (if any) and let it go at that. Do not go into 
depth or anything else. I didn&#39;t when I pulled Naomi out 9 weeks ago. I just 
informed them verbally that I was homeschooling my daughter and pulling her out 
on so and so date and that was it. I also informed the school district and there 
were no problems. Fortunatly I live in a state where no testing is required and 
the teaching totally is up to the parents. No logs, No workbooks to prove 
anything. I like it better this way too.</font></div>
