<div id="ygrps-yiv-87304037">Anne O posted this on the unschooling.com message boards,  its a quote from something she had been reading.  I think it touches on what Joyce was saying.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is hard to let old beliefs go. They are familiar. We are comfortable with them and have spent years building systems and developing habits that depend on them. Like a man who has worn eyeglasses so long that he forgets he has them on, we forget that the world looks to us the way it does because we have become used to seeing it that way through a particular set of lenses. Today, however, we need new lenses. And we need to throw the old ones away.&quot; <br/>

  **It might take you a while for that shift to feel more natural because right<br/>
  now he&#39;s at the age where you still have to guess what he wants and make a<br/>
  lot of decisions for him. So you&#39;re going to view the future through those<br/>
  glasses. Some parents never remove those glasses. But if you can -- and<br/>
  people here can help -- then the problems -- and the solutions that look<br/>
  good -- won&#39;t look the same.**<br/>

Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe bring the scary thoughts here one at a time and let us help you tack <br/>
them out to cure and dry.<br/>
Then you can have a collection of preserved formerly-scary thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that some of the ingredients of tanning &quot;recipes&quot; are ashes and <br/>
urine.  I should look that up.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe as your child gets older you will have gradually come to have faith in <br/>
natural learning and in him.  And in you.<br/>

Michelle - how about trying 6 months of unschooling and, during that <br/>
time, pretend you&#39;re always going to do it.  Keep yourself busy with a <br/>
journal of your observations about how your child learns various kinds <br/>
of things.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, I know that somebody is going to say it is all or nothing -- <br/>
but how about just trying it out that way, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I did that. I never decided in some momentous &quot;unschoolers-r-us&quot; sort <br/>
of way -  that we would unschool forever - we just do it day by day, <br/>
week by week, and keep on going - just live for a while - be on summer <br/>
vacation for the fall and winter, too. There is nothing scary about <br/>
that - nobody really IS going to ever force you to stick to it if you <br/>
don&#39;t want to - so you&#39;re free to dabble.<br/>

And wouldn&#39;t that be great to read over to reinforce to myself!  That&#39;s why I posted about the Sudbury school here - I knew I wouldn&#39;t get a response of, &quot;Yes, great way to cop-out - go for it!!&quot;  But I honeslty couldn&#39;t get to the bad bits on my own - so I posted here and people brought up some factual stuff about the schools that I don&#39;t like (minimum hours required, lack of parental participation).<br/>
<br/>
And so I&#39;ve thrown out the other bits of issues I have - that I don&#39;t think Rory is exposed to enough while staying home with Dan, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m considering a preschool for next year - and we&#39;ll see where my holes are in that argument.  I&#39;m sure ya&#39;ll will let me know - and I&#39;m here to listen and learn.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s a good idea.  I think having an end date for your experiement <br/>
which is purposely NOT schoolyear related is good too, like &quot;We&#39;re going to <br/>
try this until November&quot; or February.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when someone is adamant that she is going to unschool her <br/>
now-five-year-old for the next thirteen years no matter WHAT her husband and relatives <br/>
think, I&#39;ve recommended that instead of declare it &quot;do it forever,&quot; to say <br/>
&quot;try it for a while.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Several things happen then.<br/>
<br/>
The others calm down immediately.<br/>
They others have hope that she will fail.<br/>
<br/>
Then if she doesn&#39;t fail, they start paying attention to why not.<br/>
<br/>
And if she DOES &quot;fail,&quot; she hasn&#39;t failed at unschooling for thirteen years.  <br/>
She&#39;s failed to figure out how to make it work in six months.  And that&#39;s way <br/>
easier to deal with than an all or nothing in terms of &quot;school career&quot; and <br/>
childhood.<br/>
