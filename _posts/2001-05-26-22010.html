   We live in a rural area outside of a very, very small town called <br/>
Boonville.  We actually are only 30 minutes from Evansville though, where we <br/>
do most of our shopping.  Boonville has a very small Walmart and Buy Low, so <br/>
we can get alot of stuff from there, but they don&#39;t carry much.  So we try to <br/>
do all our errands at one time during our drive to E-ville.  <br/>
    By the way, we love all the Indiana Jones movies (as well as Star Trek <br/>
and Star Wars).  We are all waiting for the new Indiana Jones movie to come <br/>
out.  I still like Harrison Ford, even though he has aged alot since his last <br/>
one!   :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146191594">LOL, that was me, Tammy in IN that wrote that, not Tami in IN.  Already, we <br/>
are all being confused  :-)    I am pretty sure that that was another email <br/>
loop I was on, where that happened anyway, so I didn&#39;t think it was anyone <br/>
from this one.  For one thing, this person was totally against unschooling <br/>
(she was strictly school-at-home), and for another, she was totally against <br/>
diversity of any type.  I have read alot of disagreements on this loop, but <br/>
one thing is for sure, this is a very mixed group of ideas, and mostly all <br/>
agree to disagree on some things, but we are pretty much all unschoolers.  <br/>
Unless she has changed her views (and that is possible, but not probable, <br/>
given her very strong views against unschooling), I don&#39;t think that she <br/>
would ever join this group!   :-)<br/>

&gt;LOL, that was me, Tammy in IN that wrote that, not Tami in IN.  Already, we<br/>
&gt;are all being confused  :-)    I am pretty sure that that was another email<br/>
&gt;loop I was on, where that happened anyway, so I didn&#39;t think it was anyone<br/>
&gt;from this one.  For one thing, this person was totally against unschooling<br/>
&gt;(she was strictly school-at-home), and for another, she was totally against<br/>
&gt;diversity of any type.  I have read alot of disagreements on this loop, but<br/>
&gt;one thing is for sure, this is a very mixed group of ideas, and mostly all<br/>
&gt;agree to disagree on some things, but we are pretty much all unschoolers.<br/>
&gt;Unless she has changed her views (and that is possible, but not probable,<br/>
&gt;given her very strong views against unschooling), I don&#39;t think that she<br/>
&gt;would ever join this group!   :-)<br/>
