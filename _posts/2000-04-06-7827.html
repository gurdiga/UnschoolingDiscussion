<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Please could anyone advise me of SAFE, child-appropriate sites where my ten<br/>
&gt;year old unschooled daughter can chat online or make e-mail pals?? We have<br/>
&gt;had a couple of bad experiences but she really wants to pursue this so...<br/>
&gt;please help!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regards,<br/>
