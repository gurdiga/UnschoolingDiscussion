<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349926842">Today I thought about the possibility of stopping unschooling.  Partly<br/>
because I&#39;ve been under a lot of stress lately, thus am susceptible to<br/>
self doubt.  Partly because I was thinking of how people should get along<br/>
with each other through compromise.  My husband and father in law have<br/>
their own reasons for disagreeing with unschooling.  I don&#39;t agree with<br/>
them.  I thought perhaps eclectic homeschooling would be better for the<br/>
sake of getting along.  But then when I thought it through, and mentioned<br/>
it to my son Caleb, who is finally starting to de-school after seven<br/>
months of unschooling, he said, &quot;I like reading and writing, but I don&#39;t<br/>
care much for math.&quot;  I realized that to appease someone else&#39;s worries,<br/>
I would be making my kids hate learning specific subjects.  Then Caleb<br/>
told me how he learns math from monopoly.  I decided I&#39;m not going to go<br/>
there anymore.  I don&#39;t want to ruin any future interests or cause total<br/>
disinterest in learning for my children.  Let them play, I say.<br/>

Let your husband and his dad play with them!  Yahtzee is great (looks <br/>
schoolish from the schoolish end of thinking, and doesn&#39;t to people who <br/>
haven&#39;t been to school).  Mastermind for Kids is another good one.  Heck, <br/>
have them teach him poker if it&#39;s not against their religion, and they can <br/>
talk about why drawing to an inside straight is not a good idea (although you <br/>
can get that from yahtzee too).<br/>

could imagine.<br/>

Please kiss your son for me.<br/>

Tell him to keep it to himself, but that cribbage is part of their learning. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  Then maybe he&#39;ll want to work at playing cribbage even longer before <br/>
they &quot;go play.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557382260">If one needed a &quot;proof&quot; moment, youngest (9 yo) had a demonstratable &quot;proof&quot;<br/>
moment today.  We&#39;ve never sat her down and explained alphabetizing or done<br/>
the whole math thing.<br/>
<br/>
I was fixing lunch when she came running in from the livingroom with a CD in<br/>
her hand and asked &quot;Do you use Brian or Adams?&quot;  Well, I was clueless and<br/>
gave a real intelligent answer, &quot;Huh?&quot;  Seems she had decided that our CD<br/>
collection was a mess (I agree) and that there should be some organization<br/>
to it (hard to do with a half-dozen or so folks rumaging through it &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
She pulled all the CDs, put them all the alpha order by singer/group and<br/>
then went back through each group and put their CDs in order by their<br/>
titles.<br/>
<br/>
She then sat there looking and got a piece of paper.  She counted all the<br/>
albums and then wrote down the names of artists that had more than one CD<br/>
and wrote the number next to their names.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch she asked how to figure out percentages.  We dug out her<br/>
calculator (she had to have one when the &quot;big boys&quot; decided they wanted to<br/>
do chemistry experiments) and the directions and spent a few minutes on<br/>
explaining how you do % both on the calculator and on a piece of paper (she<br/>
asked &#39;what if I don&#39;t have my calculator).<br/>
<br/>
No coercion, no &quot;stuff&quot; to get her interested, just a trust in her curiosity<br/>
and imagination leading her to learn new things.<br/>

they&#39;re doing into Educationese.<br/>

Playing with lego - learning about ratios and fractions and architecture<br/>
<br/>
Or whatever they&#39;re doing.  There&#39;s almost always some kind of Educationese <br/>
you can use to describe what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
It might help to keep a journal of their activities for a while.  Just jot <br/>
down what they&#39;ve been doing.  You could even turn it into a &quot;report card&quot; <br/>
for him by translating it into . . . You guessed it.  Educationese.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744350410">Youngest kidlet is a journal &quot;nut.&quot;  All the kidlets have daytimers.  they<br/>
jot all kinds of things in them that can be used as &quot;proof&quot; that they are<br/>
learning things if it were ever to become necessary.  Back in the dark ages<br/>
when the mil from h*ll was around and homeschooling was done underground, we<br/>
did &quot;cya&quot; by using a calendar to translate stuff/things/activities into<br/>
schooleze. Also, all the kidlets each had a bankbox that they kept their<br/>
&quot;save zees&quot; in.<br/>
<br/>
Not too long ago we went through some of the old boxes and they were even<br/>
amazed at the things they were doing and when.<br/>
<br/>
and we had a fun day of &quot;remember when&quot; and &quot;wow, I remember that&quot; and even<br/>
a couple of &quot;let&#39;s do that again.&quot;<br/>

too.<br/>
<br/>
My six yo is constantly asking us to spell things out for him wherever we go. <br/>
 Well, last week he was intrigued by the tag on his shoes that told him where <br/>
they were made.  So, he started looking for &quot;Made In&quot; tags on all kinds of <br/>
stuff around the house.<br/>
<br/>
Before I knew it, he was writing down these names on a piece of paper.  Names <br/>
that he couldn&#39;t even pronounce because he can&#39;t read.  But, he knew they <br/>
were places in the world because someone had told him that.<br/>
<br/>
After he had the names written out, he came to me and asked if I could show <br/>
him where all these places were, so we went to the world map and started <br/>
looking at all the different countries.  He wanted to know what their flags <br/>
looked like, what the people ate, everything.<br/>
<br/>
We also got into a deep and involved conversation with him and a few other <br/>
kids who were around about how many of these workers aren&#39;t paid fair wages <br/>
and what we can do to change this.<br/>
<br/>
Then, yesterday, without even a prod, my other son (13) said, Hey Thomas, why <br/>
don&#39;t we make tags describing the product and strings down to the country <br/>
where they were made.  So, they spent about four hours looking all over the <br/>
house for stuff and writing...shoes-China and putting these tags on the map.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know part of my pride here is that I&#39;m still a very green unschooler <br/>
and I&#39;m probably searching for the academics in all this.  But, I was also <br/>
just really happy to see them having fun so naturally and getting enthused <br/>
about something that in school might be called &quot;Geography&quot; or &quot;Economics&quot; or <br/>
&quot;Social Studies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear other fun discovery stories.  Some days all we do is lie <br/>
around and read RedWall.  That&#39;s good, too, only my voice gets sore!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, since yours was about maps, it reminded me of my son being <br/>
interested in all the flags at the bottom of our world map on the <br/>
wall.  Under each was the country and the coordinates on the map to <br/>
locate it.  We made up a describe the flag, find it and find the <br/>
country on the map game.  It was fun, and I learned a lot about where <br/>
places are that I have heard of, and places I didn&#39;t know existed.<br/>
(ooops, this was suppose to be about *his* learning....;-)  )<br/>
And ofcoarse it led to lots of conversations about places people we <br/>
know had been, things I knew about a place and things he knew about a <br/>
place.  I know so much more about the world and where things are <br/>
since we started homeschooling.  It&#39;s a BIG world!!!<br/>

&gt; Oh no, it&#39;s not!  That&#39;s what is so fun about it...my brain is discovering <br/>
&gt; great new things through my kids.  In fact, I&#39;m so lucky to have them.  I <br/>
&gt; think my brain would atrophy without the stimulation they bring!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680010990">&lt;&lt;I think its just part of being a team&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh I agree completely.  It is just that it has become a pattern for the kids<br/>
to get involved in things and then I remind them (we also checklist some)<br/>
and it just gets put off and put off.<br/>
<br/>
I have realized while thinking about this that part of it is me.  I have a<br/>
real hangup about responsibility.  It drives me insane for people to say<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll do that&quot; and then not do it and end up inconveniencing everyone.  It<br/>
aggravates me with kids and drives me insane with adults.  Perhaps a control<br/>
issue?<br/>
