<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452234228">**I think that the message boards at www.unschooling.com could be a <br/>
little bit more user-friendly.  I&#39;ll be reading through messages <br/>
there and consider responding to something and then realize that I&#39;m <br/>
about to respond to something that is a year or two old.  **<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently reset the boards interface so that new conversations will <br/>
appear at the top of the list and I&#39;m gradually reordering old conversations so <br/>
oldest are last (removing truly outdated and useless stuff as I go - some stuff <br/>
is timeless). I *think* that should help with the problem of folks <br/>
inadvertantly responding to very old messages because they didn&#39;t notice the date.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate hearing (in the message boards Suggestions folder <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/3583/3583.html">http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/3583/3583.html</a> ) what other changes users might <br/>
like to see. Different folders, fewer folders, different order, whatever... :)<br/>
