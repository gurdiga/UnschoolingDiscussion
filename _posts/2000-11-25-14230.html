<div id="ygrps-yiv-62033752">Speaking of the Founding Fathers, all those lists that are currently<br/>
wandering the net and whether those quotes were truely taken out of context<br/>
or intent, the History Channel is doing a week long special on the Founding<br/>
Fathers.  Supposedly it is not all whitewashed and spiffed up to please<br/>
everyone&#39;s pc fallacies.<br/>
<br/>
It starts Monday night at 9 p.m. Pacific and 8 p.m. Central.  Don&#39;t know<br/>
when it will show in other time zones.<br/>
