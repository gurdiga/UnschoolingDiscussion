work towards those requirements or pass on it if it doesn&#39;t suit. Same with <br/>
college: if the school requires SAT&#39;s she MIGHT need to get the books/&#39;puter <br/>
games about studying for the SAT. <br/>
<br/>
Curious, though? Why does she want to join the military? What&#39;s the draw?<br/>

Logic.<br/>

&lt;&lt;W/out math, I am condemning my child to poor wages.<br/>
No matter what I end up choosing for school,  I will hire a math<br/>
teacher.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not logical to assume that a child can&#39;t learn math without a tutor.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about creating such a rich life for your child that all kinds <br/>
of learning happens without the traditional methods, and it DOES work if the <br/>
parents are willing to help it work.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Can someone explain a bit more about unschooling?  I&#39;ve been reading the<br/>
group- but I&#39;m not getting a feel for it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also read here:<br/>
www.unschooling.com<br/>
and<br/>

if you want to get a clearer picture.<br/>

&lt;&lt;How do you ensure the child is meeting the criteria for a given year?<br/>
What happens if your weak in a subject? &gt;&gt;<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t correct it, except to show that you&#39;re probably doing really well <br/>
at what you do, and yet there&#39;s an error in your writing.  The writing still <br/>
works, but you got married, reproduced and are going to Europe, so perfect <br/>
strength in all areas isn&#39;t a prerequisite for a successful life. <br/>
<br/>
No one has perfect strength in all areas.  It would be great for your <br/>
daughter if you would look into Howard Gardner&#39;s theory of multiple intelligences.  <br/>

The days look like the best summer vacation days or the finest Saturdays you <br/>
ever remember as a child.  Some are leisurely, and some are full of surprises <br/>
and projects, visits and visitors.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What is being taught at home that isn&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542776900">These are reinforcing comments on things Joyce said because she brought up <br/>
some good points.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Unschooling children will take the paths that will get where *they* want to<br/>
go, which might be through a top universtiy. But the unschooling path<br/>
doesn&#39;t lead to top universities. If you can see the distinction. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of unschooled kid are in college.  Some go part time when they&#39;re 14 or <br/>
15.  Some wait until they&#39;re 19.  Some go a while and then travel.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like whether SCHOOLED kids are in college, only these kids are <br/>
freer, more mature, and more realistic.  They enjoy what they&#39;re doing, or they <br/>
don&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a foreign concept to most schooled folk.<br/>
<br/>
What gets a person into college is a desire to be there and the test scores <br/>
or whatever required.   When a test score shows up, nobody can tell unless they <br/>
know whether the person filling in O&#39;s with a pencil went to school or not.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; What is being taught at home that isn&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; being done in the school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Joyce responded:  &lt;&lt;No teaching involved. It&#39;s all learning.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Had the original question been this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is being learned at home that isn&#39;t being taught at school?&quot;  the <br/>
answer could have been &quot;If you can imagine it, someone&#39;s probably learning it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The measured, linear, lockstep nature of school&#39;s curriculum is not <br/>
&quot;natural.&quot;  It has to do with units of time, hours, weeks, semesters, tests, and <br/>
scores.   <br/>
<br/>
Once something is understood, it can be connected to all kinds of other <br/>
things.  In school, cross-connections are not encouraged at all.  History has <br/>
nothing to do with language, or music.  Science isn&#39;t history.  But in the real <br/>
world they can&#39;t be separated.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;How do you ensure the child is meeting the criteria for a given year?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is no &quot;grade&quot; or &quot;year&quot; and there is no &quot;criteria&quot; so there is nothing <br/>
to meet.  My boys may have specific goals for themselves just as I might but <br/>
they look nothing like criteria for school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;What happens if your weak in a subject? &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are no separated &quot;subjects&quot; like in school so there is nothing to be <br/>
weak in.  There are just interests.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;Does the unschooling method &gt; result in children being accepted at top <br/>
&gt; universities?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, although there are several that have children in college that could <br/>
probably answer that better than I.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; What does a &gt; typical day look like for you? &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is no typical day for us but yesterday was especially fun.  We went to <br/>
the mountains to meet up with other unschoolers and had just a fantastic day.  <br/>
Today was an early day for us.  We had our first &quot;Free Day&quot; with our <br/>
homeschool group.  No free as in money free but free as in curriculum free.  We went <br/>
to the local boys and girls club and the kids had a gym, pool tables, table <br/>
hockey tables, board games, and beading if they chose.  The kids went from one <br/>
thing to another and had a great time being together.  Needless to say there <br/>
were only a few of us there.  The rest of the homeschoolers were at home doing <br/>
&quot;school work&quot;.  (yuck). Then we went to A C Moore to look at all the craft stuff <br/>
and get the boys some more drawing tablets.  Then back home where we are <br/>
putting in a new hot water heater, (fun).  LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What is being taught at home that isn&#39;t &gt; being done in the school? &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing, there is no teaching going on here.  We live life and learn along <br/>
the way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;Are the children learning more at home?&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe yes, maybe no...that depends on the child.  I believe that my boys are <br/>
learning more about life and their interests and passions.  But life isn&#39;t <br/>
divided up into separate subjects like in school.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a couple of my thoughts.<br/>

&lt;&lt; One thing that Unschoolers are able to<br/>
simply renounce is the need to deconstruct every experience into<br/>
academic study terms. (eg Chemistry for the tanning chemicals, Math for<br/>
the measuring, History, Anthropology, Biology of the animal). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I loved what Robyn wrote, but this part is definitely the writing of an <br/>
established, comfortable unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers who are established and comfortable are able to simply renounce <br/>
the need to deconstruct.<br/>
<br/>
The way most people get the comfortable place is to deconstruct and analyze <br/>
and hunt for the language and math and science and history in the everyday <br/>
world around them.  If they&#39;re lucky, they do it in the company and hearing (or <br/>
view) of more experienced unschoolers who point out some things they might have <br/>
missed.   The most common thing to point out is that they&#39;re hyperventilating <br/>
with joy because their child is catching and measuring lizards or something <br/>
(it&#39;s SCIENCE!), but they forgot to even notice the potential in the child <br/>
lining rocks up by color and shape, or in the child who is looking out the window <br/>
for half an hour, humming to himself happily and rocking.<br/>
<br/>
So first they hunt it down and sort it, and then they see how much they <br/>
missed, and how silly the sorting really was in the greater scheme of life and <br/>
learning, and THEN they easily renounce it.  After a while. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Anna and I have been in a &quot;beading mood&quot; lately, making lots of beaded <br/>
necklaces and bracelets.    I have been so amazed at some of the lovely patterns <br/>
Anna comes up with so easily.    The first necklace she made, she labored over <br/>
chosing the beads and trying to get the pattern just right.  She was hesitant to <br/>
just go with the flow and pick the beads she likes.   Her first necklace <br/>
turned out beautifully , and fortunately, she also gained a lot of confidence and <br/>
stopped stressing over &quot;doing it right&quot;  Now, she just effortlessly comes up <br/>
with beautiful patterns without much thought.  <br/>
<br/>
  A couple of days ago, my dad was ragging us about not doing anything except <br/>
making jewelry ( which was entirely incorrect, it just happened to be what we <br/>
were doing while I done my laundry at thier house)    We took his lecture in <br/>
stride and laughed about it.    Then Anna said, &quot;you know, I haven&#39;t learned <br/>
anything while making this jewelry, it&#39;s just all for fun&quot;  I said &quot;Anna, you <br/>
have learned a lot about patterns and colors and aesthetics&quot;  She said&quot; &quot;Huh?  <br/>
it&#39;s just a necklace, how does that relate to anything else&quot;  I said.. &quot; There <br/>
are patterns in everything, every kind of design, man made and natural.  <br/>
Think about clothing, fashions, buildings...  Having a good eye for patterns and <br/>
design is one of the most important things in many many jobs... Fashion <br/>
designer,  architect, landscaper,  engineer...  We went on to talk about how patterns <br/>
are really everywhere.   How creating patterns is in cake decorating and  <br/>
food presentation.  How folks study patterns in animals,  and lots of other stuff <br/>
I can&#39;t remember now.. lol.   We were just sitting and talking and making <br/>
necklaces.   We didn&#39;t start doing beads in order to learn about patterns and <br/>
design and aesthetics, we do it because we enjoy it.    But it was really <br/>
interesting to discuss how far reaching making a beaded necklace is in relation to <br/>
patterns and thier impact on our world. And Anna realized she HAD learned <br/>
something :-)<br/>

<br/>
Thinking on this further..<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I am explaining to other parents, in the most<br/>
introductory and superficial manner, about how we Unschool rather than<br/>
Homeschool, I find to demonstrate that Jayn is learning regardless of my<br/>
lack of teaching, I have to deconstruct in this way. I try to<br/>
concentrate on things she does, rather than how it would be categorized<br/>
into a subject, although I suspect that the other parent is sometimes<br/>
turning these things into &quot;so that would be (insert subject)&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
The desperate desire to teach math has probably done more harm to the<br/>
noble art of baking than any packet mix ever did. We make cookies for<br/>
the sake of making cookies, but other people may feel very relieved that<br/>
we are doing painless math.<br/>
<br/>
One of my biggest challenges is trying to get my mother to stop<br/>
saying/believing, &quot;But you taught her that&quot; on every occasion.<br/>
