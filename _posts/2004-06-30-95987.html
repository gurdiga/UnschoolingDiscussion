<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should the certificate be amended?  Annotated?  Left as it is?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The first time I read this, I thought it was great.  I see nothing that needs <br/>
changing.<br/>
<br/>
I remember specifically that while reading it that I thought, &quot;I never needed <br/>
permission or approval&quot;.  How delighted I was to get to the end and read, &quot;<br/>
Those who don&#39;t feel the need to obtain <br/>
approval to experiment, to think, or to do things they&#39;ve never seen others <br/>
do <br/>
are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need permission in the first place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have shared it with others and each time I&#39;ve read it it has always been my <br/>
interpretation that, &quot;You may reclaim control of your family&#39;s daily life, <br/>
and take what steps you <br/>
feel necessary to protect your children from physical, emotional or social <br/>
harm.&quot;  means that we are taking the control of the government out of our <br/>
educational and personal lives, nothing more, nothing less.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally have no desire to &quot;control&quot; my family or the outcomes of their <br/>
daily lives or their lives in general.  By choosing to unschool or homeschool, <br/>
I feel that I have regained control of the directions my family, children, and <br/>
I choose to take in life.  Without the harmful interference of <br/>
government/private schools whose mass scheduling, high consumption of free living hours, <br/>
social harm, and so much more, would greatly hinder the natural love of learning <br/>
and the natural right to guide one&#39;s self in the educational process.<br/>

Well that&#39;s truly what it originally was intended to mean.<br/>
<br/>
So good to hear someone likes it still.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to read something I&#39;ve read so many times and see it &quot;newly.&quot;<br/>
I guess it&#39;s impossible, really, to see with new eyes when something is so <br/>
common and constant in one&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Pamela.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I admire that constance.  I hope that where I stand now will always be the <br/>
same place with just a broader view.  I so desire for my family and myself that <br/>
unschooling becomes commonplace for us, that there is no other alternative way <br/>
of living for us.  To me, that would be extraordinary.  You seemed to have <br/>
been living this way a long time from what I&#39;ve read from you, and that I <br/>
admire. <br/>
<br/>
Thank YOU, Sandra :0)<br/>
