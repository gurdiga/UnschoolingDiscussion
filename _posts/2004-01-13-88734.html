 </span></blockquote>Hi Elizabeth, I am relatively new to this list (actually back again after <br/>
being gone for a while), but not new to pregnancy and childbirth!LOL<br/>
After 5, I can say that I have tried it all... the raspberry tea, mineral <br/>
oil, walking endless miles in the hot July evenings, sex... you name it... none <br/>
of these things really did anything for me.  BTW, the mineral oil just gave me <br/>
cramps and diarrhea! :0(<br/>
One thing that did seem to bring on contractions, but not strong enough to do <br/>
the trick for me was nipple stimulation... I used the little portable breast <br/>
pump I had.  I wound up being induced with all 5, so I wish I had better <br/>
advice for you!  I look forward to reading others&#39; suggestions!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908525018">I would like to say...think of your pregnancy as the<br/>
beginning of unparenting, unschooling...and try<br/>
unbirthing.  Don&#39;t keep track of dates.  Don&#39;t do<br/>
anything to induce.  Let that baby come when he/she&#39;s<br/>
ready to make an appearance, and don&#39;t worry about<br/>
size.  Woman have been birthing babies since before<br/>
the dawn of time, and you will birth this one when<br/>
he/she is ready, and not a minute before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please!  I really don&#39;t want a big baby.  Like I have much choice.  Nathan <br/>
was 8 pounds and Julia was 6 pounds 15 oz, but she was 6 weeks early.  I think <br/>
most of my discomfort is just that it&#39;s easier to be hugely pregnant at 35 than <br/>
it is at 39.  That and I still have all this metal in my ankle, so the <br/>
swelling is impossible.  I&#39;m still not wearing socks - even men&#39;s socks are too <br/>
snug.  I wear my birkenstocks whenever I can and live in Chicago - thank goodness <br/>
we&#39;ve had a pretty mild winter so far.<br/>
<br/>
My midwife suggested sex, too.  And I&#39;ve done Mexican food, although not <br/>
really spicey stuff.<br/>
<br/>
No names yet.  It&#39;s a boy.  We like a couple of names and just have to meet <br/>
him first.  My Julia, at four, keeps poking at my belly button and telling him <br/>
to come out!  It&#39;s really cute.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion.  Any others?<br/>

Sleep.<br/>
Do whatever will keep you from looking at a clock or a calendar.<br/>
The baby&#39;s more comfortable and safer inside than out.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve gained more weight with this one than the others, but don&#39;t <br/>
have gestational diabetes this time around.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Gestational diabetes&quot; just means &quot;eat more protein&quot; anyway.  So keep eating <br/>
protein, drink water, get friends of yours to lend you all their mesmerizing <br/>
mushy movies.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t know if you have read Spiritual Midwifery or if someone has given <br/>
you this tip, but when you are in early labor, if you can have some time <br/>
alone with your husband for sexual stimulation (YOURS, not his) that has been seen <br/>
to do some biochemical stuff that helps contractions and whatever all.  <br/>
Nipple stimulation and, if possible, orgasm.<br/>

introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
On labor starting and stopping: that&#39;s totally normal and can happen<br/>
to humans as well as goats. <br/>
<br/>
On inductions in general: just say no to this idea! Inductions are<br/>
dangerous and cause more problems that them &quot;solve&quot;. One cannot rely<br/>
on tests or statistics, but needs to only be patient and trust in<br/>
one&#39;s own body. Besides, no matter how &quot;bad&quot; the pregnancy was, the<br/>
first weeks of parenthood are worse. Look at the last weeks of<br/>
pregancy as your last chance to be free of the scariest and most<br/>
daunting of responsibilies. <br/>

drink castor oil, which has natural progesterone (i think rose hips as <br/>

I&#39;ve heard that black or blue cohosh helps, although I haven&#39;t tried it<br/>
personally.  My midwife recommended evening primrose oil (first as a dietary<br/>
supplement them applied topically on the cervix). The morning after I used<br/>
it(topically) I woke up in labor.  Sex is an old stand-by.  We resorted to<br/>
that when my labor stalled after 10 hours in the hospital!!<br/>
I really wanted to have that baby and get home!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2096302424">I haven&#39;t read the other replies, but I&#39;m sure this has been suggested by now.  Within the last two weeks of both my wife&#39;s pregnancies, we hadn&#39;t had sex in a while simply because she was too uncomfortable and not in the mood.  But both times she finally decided that ANYTHING was worth a try.  We had sex, and the next day we had a baby!  It worked like a charm for us.  Both times.  (or maybe it was coincidence, but I wasn&#39;t complaing.)<br/>

because I had a c-section last time, so I don&#39;t have to think about that.  I&#39;m <br/>
just going to try to zen this and let it happen when it does.  And take my 4 <br/>
and 5 year old swimming as much as possible.  Luckily, they really enjoy the <br/>
long hot showers afterwards, so their skin isn&#39;t all chlorine-ladden.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been watching a lot of DVDs lately, too.  And trying to just think of my due date <br/>
as the end of January.<br/>
<br/>
Naps are good too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236339231">On labour in  Dairy goats. I raised  a very large herd of Dairy goats for over 15 years and I would say that the appearance of labour starting and stopping  is not normal  and would for me have been a definite cause for concern.<br/>
I assume that the breeding date is not known. that makes it harder to determine if  thay are due.<br/>
 They are not likely to go more than a few days past a known breeding date. Multiple births  which are very common in goats -from twins being the norm to quads and quints  not uncommon in Nubians. Many of my Alpines routinely  had triplets.<br/>
If the  tail head is raised and soft underneath-the birth procedure has usually started. If this is accompanied by straining or contractions  that then stop; you have definite cause to take further steps. Kids that are  tangled  or badly presented can be the cause. Poor gestational nutrition and selenium deficiency  can be  other common causes of  birthing complications.<br/>
Some does carrying  multiple fetuses may have ketosis  which can cause them to go off their feed and lay down not cudding and give the empression that labor is imminent. Bagging up and leaking  prior to kidding is not  necessarily a sign of imminent kidding but can cause  loss of colestrum  which  is of course  not good!!! freezing excess colestrum from another doe  is always a good idea.....but then I digress ...as always ;-)<br/>
and I sympathize with the goat owner who needs that doe to kid now!!!! <br/>
grace...in the snowy rockies of BC who misses her dairy goats but not  the work..<br/>

I&#39;m back to the movies and naps.  A coma would be inconvenient since there <br/>

&lt;&lt; but i would go into false labor each and every time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;False labor&quot; is a false idea.  ANY labor helps.  Some people&#39;s &quot;labor&quot; is <br/>
spread over hours, some over days or weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Hospitals call it &quot;false&quot; if you&#39;re not worth admitting and you&#39;re not going <br/>
to have a baby within 24 hours, but midwives tend to say that any contractions <br/>
are good for you and the baby and that all of a sudden, hard labor isn&#39;t as <br/>
good as gentler, longer labor.<br/>
<br/>
(Just to consider for the next time. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Marty&#39;s birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen years ago, I went into labor on the 12th.   Not slow and easy labor.  <br/>
It&#39;s not a great story, except Marty&#39;s great.<br/>

&lt;&lt; On inductions in general: just say no to this idea! Inductions are<br/>
dangerous and cause more problems that them &quot;solve&quot;. One cannot rely<br/>
on tests or statistics, but needs to only be patient and trust in<br/>
one&#39;s own body. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I SO agree.<br/>
Due dates are nonsense.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Besides, no matter how &quot;bad&quot; the pregnancy was, the<br/>
first weeks of parenthood are worse. Look at the last weeks of<br/>
pregancy as your last chance to be free of the scariest and most<br/>
daunting of responsibilies. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was telling Holly the other day, when she was talking about how she might <br/>
feel having a first baby and wanting to see it, that I REALLY wanted to see <br/>
Kirby, and touch him, and play with him, and I even used to wake him up from a <br/>
nap to see him see me!<br/>
<br/>
But with Marty I was all for having him stay in there as long as he wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Then with Holly, she came before I thought it was time, and so there was no <br/>
waiting or wondering, it was just happening early.<br/>

Thanks, I hadn&#39;t heard that.  Makes sense though. Good thing I didn&#39;t have<br/>
any problems.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were all late. 9,10, 11 and 12 days late from the Dr.&#39;s due date.<br/>
After the 2nd baby, I told the Dr&#39;s not to expect anything happening until<br/>
at least a week after their date!!! My last was the longest overdue at 12<br/>
days. So much for them getting easier as they go.<br/>

Kirby was induced and after 24 hours I was dilated to 9, they had me push <br/>
push push not because it was time to push, but because 24 hours had passed and <br/>
hospital policy was you couldn&#39;t be in labor over 24 hours after your water had <br/>
broken.<br/>
<br/>
They had broken my water for me, effectively putting the 24 hour timer on a <br/>
C-section.<br/>

That&#39;s a long time ago, and some things have changed.  Not enough things.  :-/<br/>

that.<br/>

sperm is helpful in softening your cervix, but that isn&#39;t going to <br/>
start contractions. STRONG orgasm can, you might try by yourself. <br/>
Squatting if you can manage it. <br/>

Someone mentioned castor oil -- I would not not not attempt <br/>
induction that way. Can start labor, but also can cause <br/>
complications of labor and distress to baby. The cohoshes as well.<br/>
