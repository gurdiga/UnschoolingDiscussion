&lt;&lt; And winter solstice is our very favorite time. We stay up all night and  <br/>
 have our first fire in the fireplace that night (the longest night of  <br/>
 the year). We eat roasted nuts and seeds and dried fruits and other  <br/>
 goodies - and bake potatoes in the fire. We play Persian folklore music  <br/>
 in the background and sometimes dance a little. We sometimes do some  <br/>
 kind of little crafts related to Persian culture - like one year we  <br/>
 painted miniature paintings - another year we did some weaving, etc.  <br/>
 But the main thing we do is that my husband tells stories - the old  <br/>
 legends and mythology of the Persians. We have some good books, in  <br/>
 English, too - so when he&#39;s too tired, I read aloud from those -  <br/>
 Persian fairy tales, etc. It is so nice - we never make it all night -  <br/>
 but we always pretend we&#39;re going to. Then we all end up sleeping on  <br/>
 the floor or couch together in the living room. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds so lovely Pam.<br/>
Wonderful traditions.....<br/>
I&#39;d like to incorporate more of my own culture into our traditions, it&#39;s <br/>
something I need to learn more about.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
