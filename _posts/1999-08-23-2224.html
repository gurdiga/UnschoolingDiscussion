<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482305294">&lt;&lt;&lt;Now, there&#39;s a thought -- I wonder, have any of you unschooled or are any<br/>
of<br/>
you unschooling any children who are not your own?  How did it come about?<br/>
Would you do it again?<br/>
<br/>
Candice in OK&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am starting out that way Candice. I am (an plan to continue to)<br/>
unschooling my 3 children, my stepdaughter and her sister. My stepdaughter<br/>
is 5 and her sister is 2. I have them full time and their mother tells<br/>
everyone that I am unschooling them. She is very happy with the situation as<br/>
it takes the burden of responsibility of off her shoulders. She is a young<br/>
single mom with 2 kids from two different fathers, the other father is<br/>
totally not involved and has no plans of getting involved ever.  She works<br/>
full time and is going to school part time. She has said time and time again<br/>
&quot;I could never stay home all day with the kids, I don&#39;t know how you do it<br/>
but I am glad you do.&quot; She even has plans to sign papers that would grant us<br/>
guardianship over the little girl in the even that something happens to her<br/>
(mom). It all started before the younger child was conceived. I managed to<br/>
make friends with my husbands ex when their daughter had just turned 2 and<br/>
our youngest had just been born. Up to that point they had not gotten along<br/>
very well and we had seen very little of their daughter. At the point where<br/>
the ex and I made friends we made fast friends. She is exactly 6 years<br/>
younger than me (my dh is 5 yrs younger than me and they were highschool<br/>
sweethearts.) and she tends to look to me for advice on just about<br/>
everything imaginable. It is really neat, her and I have allot in common in<br/>
our beliefs and perspectives, the difference between us is our attitudes.<br/>
She has followed me into unschooling, eating a healthy, chemical free diet.<br/>
She is learning from me and I am learning because of her. It is a good<br/>
relationship. So, I unschool and co-parent her children, we don&#39;t have to<br/>
pay child support, dh gets to see his daughter as much as he wants, we get<br/>
an extra daughter most of the time with out most of the added expense but<br/>
all the love and the ex gladly comes over a few times a month and stays with<br/>
the kids so that we can go out. We don&#39;t believe in sitters but she is like<br/>
family (is family) so she doesn&#39;t count. We plan on continuing the<br/>
arrangement indefinitely. She feels the same as we do about schools so there<br/>
is no worry that she will decide either of them should be sent to ps. Of<br/>
course, no situation is ideal. She is very immature and self-centered and<br/>
talks way too loudly but I have known far worse situations with exs so I am<br/>
not complaining. Anyway, you asked, yes I unschool other peoples children.<br/>
They aren&#39;t school age but they will still be here when they are. Any<br/>
questions?<br/>
