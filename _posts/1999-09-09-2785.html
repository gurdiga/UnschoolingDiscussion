<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Between this and the new &#39;schedule&#39; thing she is going through I do feel<br/>
 </span></blockquote>she is comparing her 4 years of ps to the hsing experience she is having.<br/>
She is really into getting her work &#39;done&#39; and I suspect that is also a<br/>
throw back from<br/>
school.  Unfortunately the 6 yog is also attempting this same scenario -<br/>
trying to be like big sister I suppose as she has never been to ps. &lt;<br/>
<br/>
This brought a story to mind for me - 7 yo DS was playing with his PS<br/>
friend.  They were doing &quot;art&quot; and using &quot;glitter glue&quot; and &quot;glitter and<br/>
glue&quot; and making a huge happy mess in my living room!  She told him he could<br/>
be the gym teacher and she would be the art teacher.  &quot;Okay class&quot;  she<br/>
says, &quot;time for you to clean up, I have to leave for a few minutes&quot;  She<br/>
left the room and he was cleaning up, then she came back.  He says, &quot;aren&#39;t<br/>
you going to help?&quot;  She says &quot;No, I&#39;m the teacher, we have helpers to do<br/>
that.  My art teacher never cleans up!&quot;  He says &quot;But I&#39;m a teacher too&quot;<br/>
She says, &quot;But you&#39;re the gym teacher, so right now you&#39;re the student&quot;  He<br/>
was quiet for a couple minutes and then he says in a disgusted voice &quot;So<br/>
what am I? The janitor!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He told people last year that he was glad he didn&#39;t go to school because of<br/>
those &quot;Irritating bells&quot;.  Gee - our never been to school kids are really<br/>
missing out on some important lessons aren&#39;t they.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter had begun to make comments which indicated a desire to be like <br/>
other kids and go to school, &quot;Just to see what it&#39;s like&quot;.  She went to ONE <br/>
day of Vacation Bible School this summer and decided that she would rather <br/>
DIE than go to school.  They treated her requests in usual &quot;kids don&#39;t really <br/>
know what they want&quot; fashion and she had to do what everyone else was doing <br/>
even though she was interested in something different.  She summed it all up <br/>
very well when she said, &quot;They tell you that you have to stop learning THAT <br/>
thing because now it&#39;s time to learn THIS thing.  That&#39;s it, no more <br/>
learning!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It made me laugh but she sure nailed it on the head.  It was a God-send <br/>
because she is on FIRE to learn now.  She got a picture of the freedom she <br/>
has.<br/>
