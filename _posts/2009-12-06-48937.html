<div id="ygrps-yiv-972035837">The web site for the 2010 Northeast Unschooling Conference is up and ready  <br/>
for registrations and hotel reservations!<br/>
 <br/>
The conference will take place August 26-29, 2010, again at the gorgeous  <br/>
Sheraton Colonial Hotel in Wakefield, MA, a short drive from Boston and <br/>
Salem.  We&#39;re still working on the program, but presenters will include Peter <br/>
Gray, Ren  Allen, Caroline Bays, and Maureen Carey, and awesome singer Carsie <br/>
Blanton will  be with us to perform and to present! Lots of surprises are <br/>
pending! <br/>
 <br/>
I have completely redone the site with a gorgeous photo taken at the 2009  <br/>
picnic by Dagny Kream. Please check it out. Also, if you run into any prob<br/>
lems  with links or anything else on the site, please let me know. <br/>
