<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I meant is, now the push in on for everyone to get this<br/>
&gt; vaccination....everyone, not only those in a risk group. Have you ever<br/>
&gt; heard of anyone not in the risk groups dying from complications of<br/>
&gt; chickenpox?  (infections, pneumonia)  Why immunize healthy little<br/>
&gt; children for it? Why not just those at risk?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a tri-fold reason.  1.  Healthy children *do* die from this<br/>
disease.  There always have been healthy children dying from this<br/>
disease.  2.  Most people who are in a high risk group (AIDS,<br/>
Chemo) *can&#39;t* take the vaccines.  They dont&#39; have the immunities<br/>
to fight off even the vaccination.  They *can&#39;t* build up immunities to<br/>
the disease.  So therefore the consideration is to immunize those<br/>
that can be immunized to save those that can&#39;t.  3.  Convenience.<br/>
(Not a valid excuse imo, but it is one of the reasons that a lot of<br/>
parents immunize their healthy children.)  We live in a culture<br/>
where people don&#39;t want to have to take off 5-14 days of work<br/>
because their children have a disease that they could have avoided<br/>
by immunizing.<br/>
<br/>
**I thought of reason #2 after I posted, however, it still doesn&#39;t<br/>
completely make sense to me. Should all little children be vaccinated<br/>
against everything so that the seriously ill (fatally ill in some cases)<br/>
will supposedly not be exposed to these diseases? If that&#39;s a good reason,<br/>
why hasn&#39;t it been promoted? The chicken pox vaccine is relatively new and<br/>
is known not to be completely effective. So that argument is weak already.<br/>
And since most adults (in America at least) have had chickenpox already,<br/>
wouldn&#39;t they would be immune from it, even if they do have AIDS, etc?<br/>
<br/>
**About reason #1...the only otherwise healthy children I know of who had<br/>
complications due to chickenpox have been Native Americans. &quot;White man&#39;s&quot;<br/>
diseases like cp or measles obliterated whole tribes, since they had no<br/>
immunities to them. If my children had NA blood you bet I&#39;d immunize. But<br/>
that&#39;s a whole different situation.<br/>
<br/>
**You probably don&#39;t need to ask what I think of #3.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the diseases that the CDC and the WHO wish to<br/>
irradicate from Earth.  Small pox was once a rampant killer, yet<br/>
through mass immunizations all around the work we have almost<br/>
completely erased small pox from this planet.  The other diseases<br/>
that the WHO wish to iradicate are Diptheria, Pertussis, and Polio.<br/>
Polio, BTW, is still a problem in this country.  There was not the<br/>
wide spread immunization against polio like there was against<br/>
small pox.  Many countries don&#39;t immunize against polio and<br/>
strains of it are showing up here in the US that have been brought<br/>
in due to immigration and visitation.<br/>
<br/>
***Here&#39;s something to lose sleep over: smallpox is not completely gone. It<br/>
was thought to be eradicated, but here and there cases show up. We don&#39;t get<br/>
inoculated for it anymore. It&#39;s &quot;gone&quot; so why vaccinate? I saw a news story<br/>
about smallpox being kept  in the old Soviet Union for possible germ<br/>
warfare. A left-over from the Cold War. The only thing is no one&#39;s getting<br/>
rid of it or even really taking care of it. And there&#39;s no big storage of<br/>
the vaccine at the ready. What would happen if somehow this was unleashed?<br/>
<br/>
***I thought most new polio cases in the US were from the oral vaccine<br/>
itself?  I&#39;ve certainly been wrong before.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t get me wrong.  I am not a Rah-Rah Gotta Vaccinate<br/>
&#39;Em All type person.  I really respect people&#39;s informed decisions<br/>
not to vaccinate.  However, I think it is important for people to fully<br/>
understand the entire issue.  We don&#39;t immunize against Hep. B<br/>
until our children get much older.  We are also delaying<br/>
immunizing our son against MMR until he is much older and has<br/>
had more chance to develop his language and motor skills.  MMR<br/>
does not &quot;cause&quot; autism, but it can enhance it in people who are<br/>
more at a risk.  The statistics get a little skewed sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can see where I am coming from.<br/>
<br/>
I do see where you&#39;re coming from Michelle and I appreciate the information.<br/>
I am not rabidly anti-vaccination. I just want the truth...all the<br/>
possibilities. I think we are &quot;on the same page&quot;. I understand what you mean<br/>
about MMR not &quot;causing&quot; autism, but it can trigger an autistic reaction that<br/>
may or may not be overcome. I really am fed up with the mainstream medical<br/>
community for not coming clean about things like this. I really don&#39;t<br/>
believe the benefits always outweigh the risks.<br/>
