Ross, my 16 yo entomologist (who volunteers at the arthropod zoo for the<br/>
state science museum) loved this! &lt;grin&gt;  He&#39;s loved insects for the last<br/>
decade, and I&#39;m fairly certain that&#39;s the field he&#39;ll be going into.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, they had some extra Madagascar, hissing cockroaches at the<br/>
arthropod zoo, so they gave him four.  When I came to pick Ross up, he<br/>
excitedly showed them to me, and the director quickly added, with a nervous<br/>
look, &quot;As long as your mother says it&#39;s okay.&quot;  I replied that, sure, it was<br/>
fine with me.  I have since found, when mentioning my son&#39;s new pets to<br/>
friends and family, that most mothers don&#39;t have that level of cockroach<br/>
acceptance (actually, I think the hissing cockroaches are kind of cute<br/>
&lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My difficulties are with the many-legged creatures.  I&#39;m gradually getting<br/>
used to millipedes (the wave action of their legs bothered me for some<br/>
reason) (btw, we recently learned at the museum that the most legs they&#39;ve<br/>
counted on a millipede is around 780).  Centipedes - particularly the black<br/>
ones with the neon yellow legs, still bother me, however (or is it the neon<br/>
yellow ones with the black legs?  I look away too quickly to remember &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
