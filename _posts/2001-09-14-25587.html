<div id="ygrps-yiv-59886294">Hi,<br/>
   I  think people are naturally generous, kind and willing to help people<br/>
in need.<br/>
I find some people&#39;s compassion is numbed, because they assume that they<br/>
are already being generous by force and contribute to  those in need, and in<br/>
my opinion, most of the contributions are dipped in too much before they<br/>
reach the needy, and enabling the bureaucrats.<br/>
    One cannot force generosity, it is a character. I tend to resent<br/>
anything that is forced on me, and most people I know are like that<br/>
especially the home/unschooling crowd!<br/>
Mercy comes from within. If people that never learned how to share- have<br/>
their possessions grabbed from them, I don&#39;t think that will make them learn<br/>
mercy- on the contrary. That is what is wrong with socialism to me. So many<br/>
good intended laws are a waste, because people learn by experience and<br/>
example not by coercion and rules.<br/>
I  think of Communism as a step further than socialism, but  I need to read<br/>
and maybe re-think my position. Commune life seems somewhat romantic, but I<br/>
think it would stress me out, because I like to change my mind, follow whims<br/>
too much., and day in and out with the same people would get on my nerves.<br/>
This is probably just my narrow view of a hippie commune. The city I live in<br/>
was founded as a Commune, but it eventually became populated with non-like<br/>
mindeds and not everyone felt like sticking to  the established rules.<br/>
Wendy<br/>
Just another thought about the following post from Julie....<br/>
 &quot; As far as Christianity and capitalism go, how can one be a pure<br/>
capitalist (supply and demand, etc.) and be merciful to those less fortunate<br/>
who are unable to provide for themselves.  You have to turn to some kind of<br/>
socialism which is where the U.S. appears to be moving.&quot;</div>

&lt;&lt; Just wanted to check in with everyone now that my dd<br/>
 (Grace) is home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   So glad to hear this. I just saw a friend of mine at ballet and her BIL is <br/>
missing. He worked on the 104th floor of the first tower. He brother was <br/>
working on the 40th and he made it out. Her other brother who also works at <br/>
the WTC was on a train to Washington. She is driving home this weekend to be <br/>
w/ her sister and her 2 small children. My friend said she is just in a daze <br/>
now and trying to go on each day w/ her dd. Her sister doesn&#39;t know how she <br/>
is going to go on. This has been my thoughts ever since this happened the <br/>
spouses and children living w/out the person killed.It has now hit here in my <br/>
little town in Idaho.How unbelievably horrible.<br/>

<br/>
There has yet to be a communist country so we really don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
What we do know is that moving to communism through socialism doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
The socialists like the control and communism never materializes.  We do<br/>
know that communism works in small groups.<br/>
<br/>
The basic premise of communism is give by commitment, take by need.  To give<br/>
by commitment, people must believe that their society, commune, family,<br/>
whatever the group is important to them and they are important to it.  If<br/>
the group disenfranchises the individual, the group suffers.  To take by<br/>
need, people must believe that there is enough to go around, that things are<br/>
plentiful.  If not, people become greedy and stingy.<br/>
<br/>
In communism, the society must meet the needs of the people.  It cannot be<br/>
dictated by the few or the powerful or the entire society would fall apart.<br/>
That is why it cannot move through socialism and that is why<br/>
&quot;communism-lite&quot;, as I think of the common perception in the U.S. of<br/>
communism, is unworkable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761824612">&lt;&lt;all social programs do is breed laziness&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;ultimately people want to do and be more&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which is it?<br/>
<br/>
 Also, communism isn&#39;t about &quot;social programs&quot;.  It is about getting rid of<br/>
wages all together.  It is the difference between tying a kid&#39;s spending<br/>
money to the amount of work done around the house vs. the kid helping out<br/>
because he is part of the family and having access to money based on need<br/>
and being part of the family.  It is about less control, not more.<br/>

I&#39;m thinking the mentally ill, mentally retarded, the profoundly disabled.<br/>
If you want to argue welfare, you are barking up the wrong tree.  Welfare is<br/>
socialism, not communism, and I agree with you that it isn&#39;t the answer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528166424">Perhaps its this history of socialism turning into communism that makes me say it can&#39;t work.  The few examples I&#39;ve seen of communism at works, fails miserably.  The one thing this conversation has done is made me look into communism much more.  Some of my original assumptions were wrong so I&#39;ve been enlightened.  I still disagree with the concept but at least I&#39;m more educated.<br/>
