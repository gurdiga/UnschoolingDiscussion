<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041104400">Never really thought about it much, obviously have never used one - but<br/>
Scholastic Books has decided we&#39;re Sterling (family name) Home School.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo, thinking about it now.  I really like polyergic - dh uses it as<br/>
his business name (Polyergic Consulting), got it from one of our kids<br/>
who used it for things, including his email.  Many dictionaries don&#39;t<br/>
have the word, but it basically means able to act (capable of acting) in<br/>
many different ways.  So guess I&#39;d use that if we needed a school name.<br/>
Um.  Polyergic...?  Polyergic Academy?  Center for Polyergic Life?<br/>
Something.<br/>
