<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060414209">I&#39;ve got friends who are dairy farmers. I&#39;ll ask them their take on this. I<br/>
know they due the dawn and dusk milkings, but I&#39;m sure some of that must be<br/>
in the essence of time. It takes a long time to round up and milk 300+ cows.<br/>
The cows are free range so hearding is very time consuming. Plus they have a<br/>
lot to do in between. One would think though, to some extent that the laws<br/>
of nature would have made lactation the same for all mammals. I think the<br/>
supply and demand rule is the same.<br/>

&gt; This is something I&#39;ve thought about, not in terms of caring for one<br/>
&gt; myself, but would it be feasible to milk cows more often than the<br/>
&gt; usual dawn and dusk scenario?  As someone interested in<br/>
&gt; breastfeeding and therefore lactation generally, I wonder if it would<br/>
&gt; make more milk/ creamier milk?  and whether it would be practical<br/>
&gt; to round up the cows three times a day instead of two.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just a thought rattling round my head.  I sometimes this list is<br/>
&gt; more unschooling us grown-ups than the kids &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is something I have talked to my  mother about<br/>
quite a bit. At first I didn&#39;t think it would be that<br/>
big a deal. She informed me that milking the cow must<br/>
be done no less than 2X a day and at the same time<br/>
everyday. That means if we go on vacation I would have<br/>
to find someone to come milk the cow. Also, it is a<br/>
technique that has to be learned. There is a rythm to<br/>
it. I guess it is the same as learning to hand<br/>
express. It wasn&#39;t untill my third that I figured out<br/>
how to do it without bruising myself. And yes they<br/>
would produce more milk the more you milk them but<br/>
then you have to milk them that much more. Having a<br/>
milk cow is something I want to do to have fresh milk<br/>
and learn how to make cheese and other milk products.<br/>
I don&#39;t plan to do it for much more than a year<br/>
because I want to be able to go on vacations as a<br/>
family. We have never been away with the kids like<br/>
that. We had planned at the first of the year to go to<br/>
the Schliterbon in the Austin area in Sept. and to<br/>
camp while we were there, but then I got pg. I am<br/>
always either pg or have a new baby so we have never<br/>
been away as a family on vacation. Oh well, maybe next<br/>
year.    Corallyn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184488494">If you go the cow route, look for a Jersey.  They are small, they have more<br/>
butter fat to their milk if you want to make cheese and butter.  They are<br/>
more people friendly and usually become family pets.  You can usually find<br/>
them for sale advertised as &quot;family&quot; cow.<br/>
<br/>
You need to milk twice a day minimum for several reasons.  One, they<br/>
&quot;fill-up&quot; on a twelve hour cycle.  They are creatures of habit.  They don&#39;t<br/>
care about daylight savings time or anything else.  When it is the a.m.<br/>
time you choose, they will be standing there waiting for you and the same<br/>
goes for the p.m. time.<br/>
<br/>
To get milk you need to raise a calf.  We usually leave the calf with the<br/>
cow for the first week and then bottle feed it.  A good cow will give more<br/>
milk than a calf can use.  Seperate them and start the calf on pellets and<br/>
hay as soon as possible and then all the milk is yours.  If you get too<br/>
much milk, that is great feed for a pig.<br/>
<br/>
If you get tired of doing the milking thing, then you can usually turn a<br/>
Jersey into a nurse cow and foster calves on her every 3 to 4 months and<br/>
have an ongoing source of income selling the calves.<br/>
