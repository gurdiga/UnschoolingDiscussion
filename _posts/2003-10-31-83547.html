<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921449141"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;But they&#39;re probably not Quakers.  The claim was ambiguous, whether it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>meant<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Quakers or all Christians.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Sandra<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can only speak for people I know of course.  Not all people who self<br/>
identify as Christians or even Quakers.<br/>
<br/>
But I will be so bold as to say if there are those reading this who are<br/>
Christians, you need to get your parenting advice from people who&#39;s lives<br/>
and teaching are marked with Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness,<br/>
Faithfulness, Gentleness and Self - control.  Not hate, stoicism, spite,<br/>
impatience, strictness, disregard, selfishness, rudeness and control of<br/>
others.  A teacher&#39;s commentary in the Bible on my desk right now says &quot;As<br/>
we yield ourselves to the Spirit, He transforms our character so that these<br/>
wonderful virtues shine through our lives.  Ask God the Spirit to control<br/>
you so fully that the children you teach see this exquisite fruit in your<br/>
life and desire it for themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine desiring to be like a person who spends their waking hours<br/>
trying to control you.</div>

those kids grow up treating their own kids the only way they know.<br/>
