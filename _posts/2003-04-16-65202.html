That part is good.<br/>

allowed a min. of 2 weekends of month and that modification of increased<br/>
visits is up to me.I know he would fight me on anything else.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is where you could run into problems if you move.  If moving makes the<br/>
2 weekends a month impossible, he might want the whole summer.  But I don&#39;t<br/>
see how he could ask for child support during that time if he is behind on<br/>
what he owes you now.  And day care?  That&#39;s the responsibility of the<br/>
parent they&#39;re with.<br/>
