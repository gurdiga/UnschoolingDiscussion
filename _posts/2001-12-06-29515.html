<br/>
Gotta ask.  Where are you in Texas, if you don&#39;t mind us all knowing?  We<br/>
are just out of San Antonio and know absolutely no other unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795108270">We live in Houston.  In the Spring Branch area to be exact.  I&#39;m lucky <br/>
to live very near an unschooling family with 3 children.  They are all <br/>
older than mine by a couple or few years.  It only takes me a half hour <br/>
to walk to her house.<br/>
<br/>
We do lots of stuff together.  I have learned much from her.  She truly <br/>
is a natural.  She&#39;s hasn&#39;t read any books about unschooling, but she <br/>
really knows what she&#39;s doing.  It&#39;s all by instinct.  I, on the other <br/>
hand, learned from books.  This is not something that came naturally to <br/>
me.  She must have been brought up in an exceptional way to know all of <br/>
this instinctively.  She is VERY COOL.<br/>
