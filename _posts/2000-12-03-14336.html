<div id="ygrps-yiv-884007650">Well, I&#39;ve been to the library used book sale again, poor farm here I come.<br/>
I got a real find this time (I paid fifty cents and it is selling on the net<br/>
for $40 to $65) and a real must read, IMHO, for anyone interested in U.S.<br/>
history NOT written with an agenda.<br/>
<br/>
The book is &quot;The Truth About Geronimo.&quot;  This book was written by a 7th<br/>
Calvary officer who was there and part of the Geronimo campaign of 1885/86.<br/>
He pulls no punches and tells it like it was without trying to gloss over<br/>
anything, pro or con from either side!  It was most refreshing to read<br/>
something written by a whiteman that was factual and unbiased.<br/>
<br/>
There are also some great pictures.  Only the paperback is now in print, so<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it contains the pictures.  If it doesn&#39;t and anyone who buys<br/>
the book wants to see the pictures, I will scan them and send them.<br/>

Doesn&#39;t it make you wonder, when you buy a really good, really exciting book <br/>
why the library didn&#39;t just put it on the shelf for people to check out?   <br/>
Hmmmm....<br/>
<br/>
Cool that you found that though!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768076311">These sales are actually put on by the local volunteers who do fundraising<br/>
to buy new books and to keep the library open an extra day.  The books are<br/>
donated and aren&#39;t usually old library books.  Although I have noticed that<br/>
most libraries have a nasty inclination to only want &quot;new&quot; books, be that<br/>
actually new or new looking.<br/>
<br/>
They also have silent auctions and have some really beautiful old out of<br/>
print books then.  We&#39;ve gotten some really great old books then.  Our 12 yo<br/>
is going to be a lawyer and is a Lincoln buff and he got a book of Lincoln&#39;s<br/>
speeches published in about 1905 for $12.  I&#39;m just glad they didn&#39;t really<br/>
look at this one as it is selling on the net for $40 to $65!<br/>

book so that it is out on the shelf and circulating costs money (I&#39;ve heard<br/>
quotes of $40-50 per item, but this will vary). Before you&#39;d get to this<br/>
point, you&#39;d have to get someone to sift through and evaluate the donated<br/>
books in the first place. Some really cool books just don&#39;t fit in that well<br/>
with the existing collection (circulation stats, the acquisitions<br/>
librarian&#39;s criteria, etc.), so it makes more sense to sell them at a<br/>
library fundraiser - even if it&#39;s just for 50 cents.<br/>

Public libraries have a different mission than academic, corporate or other<br/>
libraries. No matter how fascinating a book may be to some people, it may<br/>
not be much in demand by the local taxpaying public which the library<br/>
serves, and so it&#39;s better to make room for something that really will be<br/>
used. E.g. public libraries will generally remove from their collections<br/>
books containing outdated medical information. Academic libraries, on the<br/>
other hand, keep them because they are of historical interest to<br/>
researchers. It&#39;s not a statement of how intrisincally valuable a book may<br/>
be, just a matter of context.<br/>
