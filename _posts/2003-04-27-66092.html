class. The use of money as how we understand money today, not as it was <br/>
in the times when people truly believed that all life was transitory and <br/>
simply preparation for life after death. *That* had changed in the minds <br/>
of the populace or they wouldn&#39;t have let Henry do it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;It wasn&#39;t exactly sitting in the hands of the peasants before that! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was possible (and common) for people to enter monastic life.  Many middle <br/>
class families had at least one child become a priest or nun, which saved the <br/>
families money and was a contribution to the religion they believed in.   <br/>
Henry&#39;s team closed the monasteries, confiscated the land and buildings and <br/>
they became private property.<br/>
<br/>
There were some archbishops who had nice homes and those were transferred to <br/>
secular guys&#39; hands.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Why is is necessary to say things in this insulting way? That is so <br/>
&quot;schoolteacherish&quot;. Perhaps your emphasis was religious and mine was <br/>
economic, in my mind they are inextricably intertwined.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You made a claim that isn&#39;t borne out by what I&#39;ve read.  &lt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&lt;And, I don&#39;t <br/>
believe he could have done if the time for change wasn&#39;t ripe with the <br/>
populace.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The populace wasn&#39;t consulted.  The populace was Catholic, and lots of them <br/>
were executed.  Their &quot;change&quot; wasn&#39;t from Catholicism to Protestantism.  It <br/>
was that Henry dragged the whole country into excommunication.  Nobody was <br/>
ripe for excommunication, and few were ripe for martyrdom, but that&#39;s what <br/>
they got.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why is is necessary to say things in this insulting way? That is so <br/>
&quot;schoolteacherish&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which is more insulting, the fair suggestion that maybe you didn&#39;t read <br/>
enough, or the low blow of calling it &quot;teacherish&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;No, it didn&#39;t. I meant the economics of it. The rise of the middle <br/>
class. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The rise of the middle class way pre-dates Henry VIII.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The use of money as how we understand money today, not as it was <br/>
in the times when people truly believed that all life was transitory and <br/>
simply preparation for life after death. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The people in England were Catholic.  What percentage of them do you think <br/>
didn&#39;t care about their souls and the afterlife?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;*That* had changed in the minds <br/>
of the populace or they wouldn&#39;t have let Henry do it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some tried to stop him.  They didn&#39;t &quot;let him.&quot;  He was executing his own <br/>
wives.  Were others feeling much braver and safer?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to turn this into a yucky fight, and if we were in person there <br/>
would be indications of whether you were really angry or not, but did you <br/>
learn this stuff in an economics class or a history class or something?  The <br/>
idea that England was ripe for change and somehow some critical mass of them <br/>
weren&#39;t concerned with the afterlife?  Because it&#39;s like a sci-fi/fantasy <br/>
version of the 1500s compared to what I&#39;ve read of the beliefs and culture of <br/>
people in those days, and even for a hundred years later.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a really accessible book, kind of anthropological, called The <br/>
Elizabethan World Picture, and going by references from all kinds of fields <br/>
(religion, ethics, law, language, I don&#39;t know what all) they laid out the <br/>
cosmology of where people saw themselves in the universe, and how they felt <br/>
&quot;fairness&quot; worked.  I gave away my last copy a couple of years ago and <br/>
haven&#39;t picked up another.  It&#39;s a little paperback.   It&#39;s worth a glance <br/>
through if you see it somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This conversation has evolved from me quoting an English comedian to <br/>
reference a joke.<br/>

but I will say that wasn&#39;t what I said. It wasn&#39;t a simple time and<br/>
the forces: economic, religious, and secular, that shaped the<br/>
changes were complex. Let&#39;s just say the route to the afterlife<br/>
wasn&#39;t quite so clear cut as it had been in the past and the turmoil<br/>
at the highest levels of the Church, in Rome and other &quot;Romes&quot; and<br/>
with various popes,  had contributed to an atmosphere where<br/>
questioning the route to faith was not only possible but extremely<br/>
likely. Without that kind of background, I doubt very much that<br/>
Henry would have successfully kicked out the papal authority.<br/>
