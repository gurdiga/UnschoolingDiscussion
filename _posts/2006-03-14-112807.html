<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001406069">We just read a picture book by David  (I thought it was Adler-started with an A) about 2 children , from different families (Eli, and Hilde), their experiences and deaths in the holocaust.  This book is based on true stories given to the author by the victim&#39;s siblings.<br/>

an artist and his work would have been categorised as &#39;degenerate&#39; art <br/>

One of the reasons for some of the great art and architecture in the <br/>
US today is because so many artists, architects, writers etc who fled <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-646322873">That IS a really good site!  My oldest dd has had an ongoing interest <br/>
with the holocaust.  Some our best information however has come from <br/>
German friends who have had to live with the shame of the holocaust in <br/>
the history of their culture.  Movies have been good too, can&#39;t think <br/>
of any off the top of my head, but there are quite a few out there, <br/>
and we&#39;ve seen many.  Then of course there is the classic &quot;the Diary <br/>
of Anne Frank&quot;.  My daughter was especially able to relate to her <br/>
story because of the fact that she was a young girl.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609467728">I think one of the best movies on the Holocaust is &quot;Schindler&#39;s  List.&quot;  Very <br/>
heavy, very sad, but very good.<br/>
 <br/>
A book (the movie wasn&#39;t good) that I LOVED as a teenager and have read  many <br/>
times since, about the holocaust from a different perspective, was &quot;The  <br/>
Hiding Place&quot; by Corrie Ten Boom.  It&#39;s a true story of a spinster woman,  her <br/>
sister, and her father hiding jews in their home in Holland and working  with the <br/>
underground during the Holocaust.  WONDERFUL story, which showed  faith in <br/>
such a GOOD way, as it should be...sacrificing everything for  others.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you live in the Los Angeles area (and I think there is another one in  <br/>
Washington DC) the Museum of Tolerance (Simon Wiesenthal Center) is wonderful  <br/>
and has a tour that walks you through the holocaust, from the beginning when  <br/>
there were just rumors floating around, to having to wear yellow stars of David, <br/>
 and into a death camp.  It&#39;s been over 8 years since we were there, so I&#39;m  <br/>
not sure what it is like now, but it was very well done.  There&#39;s a TON of  <br/>
holocaust information there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737358791">And yet, it might be difficult to find a real book about the Holocaust that glosses lightly over subtle, difficult, disturbing themes...  or a movie about it for that matter.  &quot;Sophie&#39;s Choice&quot; springs to mind.  &quot;Schindler&#39;s List.&quot;  I think that chldren and people must be confused and curious before they learn and can be enlightened.<br/>
<br/>
But that said, maybe go to the library and look at Microfilm or Microfische from newspapers, magazines or newsreels of the period??<br/>

Anyway, here is a sample of Maus from that same main webpage I sent the link to before:  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I can see this point. I&#39;d personally think _MAUS_ might be a good <br/>
way into the topic without too much analysis. A 12 yo could take what he <br/>
wanted and leave the rest because of the format, imo. I think many of <br/>
the issues are subtle and would go over a child&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ushmm.org/">http://www.ushmm.org/</a>  That&#39;s a link to the National Holocaust Museum in <br/>
DC. I&#39;ve been through the Children&#39;s section, which is powerful and <br/>
difficult and disturbing, but never the whole thing. I won&#39;t take my <br/>
kids for many more years, but the website might be worth exploring with <br/>
a 12 yo, depending upon his own comfort levels and emotional maturity. <br/>
There&#39;s some cool stuff under the &quot;Special Exhibits&quot; link.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is exactly what I was thinking when Chamille wanted to learn <br/>
more about the holocaust.  I really appreciated having German <br/>
friends during this time for exactly this reason.  They were able to <br/>
put it into a different light for her that gave a personal human to <br/>
human understanding of it.  I know that some of the things that she <br/>
saw and heard about were too much for her to understand.  <br/>
<br/>
The whole &quot;why&quot; about it was almost too much for her and in fact I&#39;m <br/>
not sure I can even understand it.  I can understand in the literal, <br/>
or logical, but not the emotional or spiritual.  Just like I find it <br/>
hard to understand why someone can murder someone else even if they <br/>
have a reason that I can understand.  When one looks at the <br/>
holocaust, it is easy to become overwhelmed with the tragedies and <br/>
horrors.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason though, Chamille seeks out injustices in the world <br/>
to find ways to stop them.  So, learning about the holocaust seemed <br/>
just a part of that aspect of her person.  When we get into stuff <br/>
like this, I always try to bring it back out of the details and into <br/>
the human nature aspect so that she knows that these are real humans <br/>
who are doing the harm and real humans that are doing the hurting.  <br/>
Being able to bring it back to that helps her find concrete ways of <br/>
helping in her own world where she knows that she can&#39;t change <br/>
everything but she can make a difference.  <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, she likes &quot;The Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; for that <br/>
very same reason.  The injustices are so obvious, and often so <br/>
absurd.  The kids in the book just deal with it by trying to do what <br/>
is right and saving themselves at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Dealing with injustices has helped her narrow down where she wants <br/>
to put her own energy into helping.  Recently we had a discussion on <br/>
why it would be hard to decide where to donate your time or money if <br/>
you had to choose between feeding the hungry or homeless people, or <br/>
animals.  Ultimately she chose helping animals.  We talked about <br/>
playing to our strengths and to what are hearts call us to do.  <br/>
She&#39;s chosen to find a way to volunteer to help animals in need, now <br/>
we are looking for ways to do that.<br/>
<br/>
It is strange for me to know that I have a child that sees the <br/>
horrors and injustices stronger than she sees the joys.  My thinking <br/>
is that there must be a reason for it.  So I just help her in any <br/>
way I can.  She really seems to have a better grasp than I did at <br/>
her age, of the realities of suffering that exist in the world.  <br/>
That kind of enlightenment can be a gift and a curse.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756344441">Just a week or two ago was an interesting movie on, It was called <br/>
Island on Bird Street. It was about the holocaust from a childs point <br/>
of view. Father was taken away and the boy (about 12 yo) stays in <br/>
their apartment building to wait for his father to return. Not alot of <br/>
blood or gore, and definitely very riveting. I would probably let my <br/>
12yo son watch it if it was on during reasonable hours. I think it <br/>
came on about 11 or 12 at night when I saw it.<br/>
Good luck on this subjetct, I am not even of german descent and still <br/>
the history of the holocaust shames me...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807718091">Another interesting book is Stones From the River.  It is fiction and deals <br/>
with the question of why so few people openly opposed the holocaust.  I read <br/>
this as an adult, however, and can&#39;t remember all the details.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think it had much about holocaust victims - it was more about the residents <br/>
of one small town and how things slowly changed.  The family owned a <br/>
*bookstore* but it was more like a library with fees for each book borrowed.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Things We Couldn&#39;t Say&quot; by Diet Eman is set in Holland and is a true story <br/>
about a couple who assisted Jews.  Also a love story.<br/>

<br/>
Another idea, depending on the child: if the stage musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; is<br/>
playing anywhere near, go see it, or read the script. The primary themes of<br/>
it are fear and &quot;All that evil needs to succeed is for good people to do<br/>
nothing&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
The stage play is *considerably* different from the Liza Minelli movie<br/>
version. For example the character of Max is a low-income Jewish lodger in<br/>
the boarding house, in love with his landlady, not a wealthy bisexual. A<br/>
number of the songs are different from the movie or sung by different<br/>
characters, and to my recollection the whole odd &quot;absent father&quot; thruline in<br/>
the Minelli version is not in the play at all.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read &quot;I Am A Camera&quot; on which the play is based.<br/>
<br/>
One children&#39;s book that I remember from my youth is &quot;I am David&quot;, about a<br/>
little boy who escapes a concentration camp.<br/>
<br/>
The History Channel, and History International, have *tons* of documentary<br/>
programming about the rise of the Nazis, the Holocaust and WWII, including a<br/>
series of biographies about Hitler and his various henchmen. There is one on<br/>
&quot;Dr&quot; Mengele and the horrific twin experiments. It distressed me greatly, so<br/>
should certainly be approached with a lot of caution where a kid is<br/>
concerned.<br/>

This is one of my favorite movies.  I cried also (well, maybe more like<br/>
sobbed).  I highly recommend it.  It takes a look at the holocaust<br/>
without all the graphic images (except for one that I vividly remember)<br/>
and really focuses on the love that binds a family together.  I think<br/>
that I will have to rent it for my family.  Thanks for bringing it up.<br/>

is a wonderful look at the creation of a comic.  But Maus is a very <br/>
complicated comic.  When I was 9 or 10 I read &quot;When Hitler stole Pink <br/>

based on her own life, which is about a family working to run from Nazi <br/>
Germany and Nazi sympathetic Europe.  I have a copy that I found for 5 <br/>

movie from some little artsy video rental in  Albuquerque called The <br/>
Nasty Girl (not a particularly appealing title) which he had seen at <br/>
college or something that is about a girl who in innocently delving into <br/>
the history of her town discovers that they were complicit with the <br/>
Nazis.  <br/>

project in New York where she got Holocaust survivors to come to schools <br/>

At about 12 I became fascinated with WWII.  I can remember reading a <br/>
book about the massacre at Babi Yar and it was horrific and painful, oh <br/>
and Jerzy Kozinski&#39;s Painted Bird which I absolutely do not recommend.  <br/>
I read it in my closet, not because I wasn&#39;t allowed, but maybe it felt <br/>
appropriate, like Ann Frank or because it seemed like secret not to be <br/>
discussed or presented by public reading.  I read about the Donner party <br/>
in the same way.  I think it might have been nicer for me if I could <br/>
have talked about these horrors more publicly.  Instead of lying in bed <br/>
at night imagining myself drowning under the bodies of others, covered <br/>
in a dusting of lime, talking about these things with my parents.  I am <br/>
sure if I had approached them they would have been more than willing to <br/>
talk about these things, but I needed them to watch me in order to open <br/>
the discussion, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow. If you want to look at what led up to such a horrible thing <br/>
there were eugenic sterilization laws passed in the U.S. by 1907 <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay8text.html">http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay8text.html</a> which led <br/>
to sterilizations performed, involuntarily, on 60,000 people, or so the <br/>
cited article states. If you go up a level to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/">http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/eugenics/</a> it is an interesting site, if <br/>
depressing.<br/>
