French, see the action/activity, and read the translation.<br/>
<br/>
Look for French speakers in your area if you can. My SIL was going to <br/>
be going to Haiti several years ago and was able (with the help of <br/>
some friends) to find a Haitian immigrant who was willing to <br/>
provide &quot;language lessons&quot; - getting together regularly (once or twice <br/>
a week at the time) to speak with her, explain pronunciation, work on <br/>
her pronunciation, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, not textbooks but library books in French - sometimes you can <br/>
find translated versions of English titles and vice versa so you can <br/>
read along in both - especially children&#39;s books (so the reading level <br/>
would probably be way below her English reading level). One reference, <br/>
regardless of your worldview/religious choices, could be the Bible. <br/>
It&#39;s translated into tons of languages and there are many familiar <br/>
phrases in there. I&#39;ve got a French translation of the Bible (long <br/>
story) and knowing what the passage says in English helps me figure <br/>
out the words in French - I know that x passage is about sheep, so <br/>
this word is probably sheep since it appears a bunch in x passage, and <br/>
so on.<br/>
<br/>
Mille Bornes is a card game that has French text on the playing cards <br/>
and the instructions are written in English and French, with pictures <br/>
too to help figure things out - DS is 7 and he loves to play.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

English. Then in French. Then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language  <br/>
Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil,&quot; by Mark Twain. Hilarious  <br/>
in all ways, but also a great primer (through examples) of how gender  <br/>
and grammar are different in the two languages. You can get it used  <br/>
at Amazon for twenty cents plus shipping.<br/>

The only Spanish any of us manage to retain very well, is in the form<br/>
of songs!:)  You can play CD&#39;s or tapes in the car or learn some of<br/>
them yourself and sing them to her (if she likes that).<br/>
Somehow the words just stick better when we sing them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are a few Raffi songs in French.  One particularly beautiful  <br/>
one is &quot;Petit Papa No�l.&quot;  He didn&#39;t write it.  But that might be  <br/>
something you could find easily.  The words are pretty simple, and  <br/>
the tune is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I think every Raffi album tried to have one French song.<br/>
<br/>
The Wizard of Oz is apparently as popular in France as here, and was  <br/>
dubbed way back, and shown once a year, just as in the U.S.   So if  <br/>
you get the DVD, you can listen in French (and most of the dialog is  <br/>
very simple) with English or French subtitles.   I&#39;m not sure if the  <br/>
French subtitles are a transcript of their dialog or not.  Either way  <br/>
could be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
In France, Dorothy wouldn&#39;t have been Baptist (or other &quot;good  <br/>
Christian&quot;) as in the American screenplay, so whereas Kansas-Dorothy  <br/>
says &quot;My Goodness!&quot; that godless French maybe-nominally-Catholic  <br/>
Dorothy says &quot;Mon DIEU,&quot; for which Kansas girls of that era would  <br/>
have had their mouths washed out with soap, at LEAST.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me that when one of my articles was translated to  <br/>
French, the translator asked if it was okay to leave out a line about  <br/>
Jesus.  I said fine.  She said in France, they wouldn&#39;t take an  <br/>
article seriously that quoted Jesus in the way I did.<br/>
<br/>
[Interesting the way the French Revolution and the American  <br/>
Revolution were so similar and ended up in different places, in a  <br/>
way.  The U.S.  is still deeply affected by its puritanical roots.   <br/>
The French protestants left France.  The U.S.  was filled up with  <br/>
protestants first, then took a big layer of Catholics later (not so  <br/>
evenly spread, though), then Jews (also spread thicker in some  <br/>
places).  It shows, if you do a geologic-style-sampling of the culture.]<br/>
<br/>
In one of my articles, in the French version, the term &quot;oulala!&quot;  <br/>
appeared.  That&#39;s fun.<br/>
Oul�l�!! Je m��coutai parler et regardai ce pistolet-gicleur, cette  <br/>
petite et insignifiante chose, cent petits grammes mais�.<br/>

When you go to some of those links, there will be links to translated  <br/>
articles by Anne Ohman and Danielle Conger, too.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see what it&#39;s about in a rough translation, if you go  <br/>
to google and click on &quot;language tools&quot; to the right of the search  <br/>
box, you can either paste in a text or give them a website and they  <br/>
will (very roughly) put it into English.  They have a beta test  <br/>
version of Japanese there now.<br/>

well as others) available. I still remember most of several songs I <br/>
learned in French for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
When my roomie and I were learning French way way back when (late <br/>
1980s), we used up a pile of post it notes and labelled the entire <br/>
apartment. It got to be kind of fun to notice something that wasn&#39;t <br/>
labelled and see if we could name it before the other person looked it <br/>
up. If we couldn&#39;t name it, we labelled it so we&#39;d know it next time. <br/>
Sometimes we&#39;d take a roomful of labels off and try to get them back <br/>
correctly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618288416">We&#39;re on the opposite range :-)  We&#39;re french, trying to learn english!<br/>
My boys babble in english and know lots of intonations but few words.<br/>
They do know &quot;Juice, please&quot; or count to 10, but the fun part is when<br/>
they watch movies that they know really well in English or spanish.<br/>
They don&#39;t get all the words, but their favorite parts, they remember<br/>
them in english.  It&#39;s really, really cool.  Travelling too can be<br/>
really fun to learn a new language.  Immersion is the best thing, IMO.<br/>
When we went to Cuba in December the boys didn&#39;t know anything in<br/>
Spanish, and now Felix asks for stuff in Spanish, like &quot;Uno pina colada<br/>
por favor&quot;.   Jonathan has been singing &quot;augustus gloop&quot;  on and on for<br/>
days now!  Really, really cute!<br/>
 <br/>

tons of places.  <br/>

can be cool!<br/>

with people she probably knows already.  <br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s also a visit in Quebec, which can be quite close by if you&#39;re in<br/>
north-east USA.  It&#39;s a great immersion and you could connect with a few<br/>
unschoolers too!<br/>

My DS (7 1/2) gets a kick out of the fact that I can count to 10 (more <br/>
or less) in about half a dozen languages - can&#39;t do much more than <br/>
that in some, can dredge up some phrases in others (and that&#39;s not <br/>
including silly-fun ones like Pig Latin of which I can manage 3 off <br/>
the top of my head) - nothing near fluent in any really. DH always <br/>
wonders where I picked these bits up - in one case (Japanese) it&#39;s <br/>
because my sister took a short martial arts/self-protection type <br/>
course years ago and the counts for the moves were in Japanese and I <br/>
was her &#39;practice dummy&#39; at home. And so on, tidbits here and there <br/>
all added together and now being passed to my DS as he has interest. <br/>
Oh, and also a few phrases my mom used to use in French when she <br/>
wanted our attention - great way to stop a kid right in his/her tracks <br/>
is to switch languages mid stream LOL so I know phrases like sit down, <br/>
be quiet, shut the door lol.<br/>
