you! &lt;g&gt; Thanks for your response.<br/>
I was not specific enough in my post so I&#39;ll add to it now. DD has <br/>
never been in a classroom setting so when she went to take the SAT, <br/>
that had an affect on her (distracting and so on). Also, she didn&#39;t <br/>
do any test prep work which she normally does when taking the <br/>
required standardized test here in NC. (Iowa Test of basic skills is <br/>
the one we use). <br/>
I know there are books galore for test prep but more specifically I <br/>
should have asked: has anybody ever tried a prep class like ....  at <br/>
a Sylvan Learning Center or your local community college? If so, what <br/>
was your opinion of the experience? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048623421">A lot of those classes are a mixed bag.  They are either offering the<br/>
classes for remedial work (kids who did really poorly and need all the help<br/>
they can get to squeek in the door) or they are hardcore for kids that can<br/>
pass the test but are going to try to get the highest score possible.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to consider a test prep thing like Princeton Review<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.review.com/index.cfm">http://www.review.com/index.cfm</a> and then work on test taking strategies.<br/>
<br/>
All the kids I worked with at the high school who did the Princeton Review<br/>
did much better than the ones who took the classes.<br/>

I haven&#39;t tried a class, myself, but my brother and sister both took the Kaplan SAT courses and found them extremely helpful (though definitely pricey).  I&#39;m fairly certain that they offer an on-line prep course as well as one in a classroom setting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543639458">We never did a prep course like that but given your dd&#39;s problems it <br/>
might help.  Other things that might help are to take the practice <br/>
tests with lots of distractions.  Put the TV on, have lots of people <br/>
in the room, take it at a table in the food court of the nearest <br/>
mall, etc.  Rachel has always had the ability to blockout distraction <br/>
well.  She can ignore a marching band passing a train wreck if she is <br/>
of a mind to.  Learning to ignore distractions when you want to is a <br/>
good skill to have in life.<br/>
Also, taking lots of practice tests really helps.  You need to get a <br/>
feel for the exact type of test you are taking.  Examine the answers <br/>
closely.  Look especially for ones that you missed because you <br/>
misread the question.  Often the same type of question will appear on <br/>
the test and knowing to watch for it can help.  Does that make <br/>
sense?  I know what I am trying to say but it isn&#39;t quite coming out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331636325">Brain bubble &lt;g&gt;  Most high schools have message boards and lots of the kids<br/>
get together for study groups to get ready for the SATs.  Sometimes they<br/>
have them on the bulletin boards at the local colleges, also.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on the college boards you will sometimes find kids that do tutoring<br/>
for SATs and they don&#39;t charge to awfully much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142582506">IMHO - As time passes and more and more kids choose the <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling GED route and not the traditional high school <br/>
diploma route, the GED stigma will go away.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if, <br/>
within 10- 15, a GED will be looked upon more favorably than a high <br/>
school diploma.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree with you, Bridget.  Today,  I believe there is still a stigma <br/>
associated with the GED.  But, I think things are already changing for <br/>
the better.  Those employers who immediately discard applications that  <br/>
list GED&#39;s instead of diplomas are behind-the-times and ignorant of  <br/>
today&#39;s choices in education.  It&#39;s their loss.  I&#39;m not sure I would <br/>
want to work for  someone who discriminates so readily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-751959716">I think it depends on the area.  I can tell you that the places I&#39;ve worked<br/>
and that hubby has worked (city government, school districts, colleges,<br/>
hospitals, private schools, large corporations) just plain don&#39;t even look.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the norm.  A secretary opens the mail and looks for minimum<br/>
qualifications and tags the apps for the reject pile and the look closer<br/>
pile.  The look closer pile is reviewed for qualifications specific for the<br/>
job.  References are called.  If there are more than about half a dozen that<br/>
are equally qualified, then they go into more detail--length of employment<br/>
per employer, personal references, questionaires, education (if it isn&#39;t a<br/>
qualification for the job to begin with), etc.<br/>
<br/>
When the pile is down to the half dozen, an interview committee is put<br/>
together and they review the apps, put together a list of questions and go<br/>
from there.<br/>
<br/>
It is usually only small businesses that go through and nit pick the things<br/>
apart.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if it is an entry level position, education might have some<br/>
bearing on employment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Shyrley,<br/>
<br/>
Even though I&#39;m a former ps high school teacher, I&#39;m certainly not an <br/>
expert on the GED.  This is what I believe it is:  It is a test young <br/>
adults take if, for one reason or another, they do not attend or finish  <br/>
high school and &quot;earn&quot; a high school diploma.  There are many different <br/>
reasons for doing this.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, many people still believe that the only reason a person <br/>
chooses to take the GED instead of going through high school is because <br/>
that kid got kicked out of school, dropped out, or some other &quot;bad&quot; <br/>
reasons like that.<br/>
<br/>
At the high school I used to work at, there was a GED program.  Most of <br/>
the kids in the program were considered to have behavioral problems.  <br/>
Many had been suspended multiple times from school.  This program was <br/>
run like a Boot Camp.  These poor kids had to wear uniforms, were yelled <br/>
at by teachers, and had to follow much stricter rules than the regular <br/>
student population.  There was even a faculty  meeting held where we <br/>
were assured that this group of GED kids would be kept as  separate from <br/>
the regular kids and teachers as much as possible.  Their classes were <br/>
held in temporary buildings on campus and not in the  main building.<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty disgusted by the  whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it&#39;s programs like this that help keep the negative stigma <br/>
of the GED going.<br/>
<br/>
With the growth of unschooling and homeschooling, however, I really do <br/>
believe this will change.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely hope that my boys will be able to stay out of school and <br/>
take their GED when, and if, they choose to.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi Shyrley,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even though I&#39;m a former ps high school teacher, I&#39;m certainly not an<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right. Now High School Diploma is confusing me. Do High school pupils<br/>
(ages 16-18) take just the one exam that results in a diploma? In<br/>
England we specialise at 16 and study 3 subjects at A level. For example<br/>
I studied maths, Chemistry and Biology from 16-18 and took three exams<br/>
at 18 which gained me three A levels. A levels are required for<br/>
university entry. From the age of 16 therefore I didn&#39;t have to waste<br/>
time on literature or art or history or anything else that I did not<br/>
find interesting. I&#39;m guessing that isn&#39;t the same here. Am I right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201296907">Yes!!  Of course, that&#39;s the way to do it!  Here in Texas, homeschools <br/>
are considered private schools.  So, I know that a lot of people just <br/>
design their own diplomas and present them to their kids when the time <br/>
comes they feel they want to graduate and move on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of homeschooling groups even having a fancy graduating <br/>
ceremony, with diplomas, etc. at the end of their 12th grade.<br/>
<br/>
Shirley, I guess every state is different - so you might have to do some <br/>
research to see what the laws are in your state.  But, here in Texas, <br/>
everything is pretty free and easy.  Not only can my boys design their <br/>
own diplomas but they can even decide when they should receive them.  Of <br/>
course, they&#39;re only 8 years old, so I guess it&#39;ll be a few years, <br/>
especially since they can&#39;t read and write yet.<br/>

&gt;&gt; other.  I do know several employers who automatically discard and<br/>
&gt;&gt; application that lists a GED instead of high school diploma.  I think<br/>
&gt;&gt; they are wrong and have told a few of them so.  I also think that<br/>

I was at the top of my class in high school in New York.  We didn&#39;t &quot;specialize&quot; in anything unless you were in the program to study cosmotology, mechanics or professions which were considered a trade. I did love languages so I took German all the way through high school - and I am still taking classes now - because I enjoy it- but I can&#39;t say I was overly prepared in any one area. I did have to take exams put out by the state on NY in Math, English, Science and History - each year and if passed I was awarded a &quot;regents&quot; diploma - which I can&#39;t say has done anything for me- that a regular diploma or GED for that matter would have done - I often wonder though....had I been able to spend MORE time on the subjects I really loved - like languages - I could probably have been really proficient by now.....  that is what I hope for my children - to be able to go their own way - at their own pace....<br/>

  &gt; &gt; What is a GED?<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Shyrley<br/>

  &gt; Hi Shyrley,<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Even though I&#39;m a former ps high school teacher, I&#39;m certainly not an<br/>
  &gt; expert on the GED.  This is what I believe it is:  It is a test young<br/>
  &gt; adults take if, for one reason or another, they do not attend or<br/>
  &gt; finish<br/>
  &gt; high school and &quot;earn&quot; a high school diploma.  There are many<br/>
  &gt; different<br/>
  &gt; reasons for doing this.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Right. Now High School Diploma is confusing me. Do High school pupils<br/>
  (ages 16-18) take just the one exam that results in a diploma? In<br/>
  England we specialise at 16 and study 3 subjects at A level. For example<br/>
  I studied maths, Chemistry and Biology from 16-18 and took three exams<br/>
  at 18 which gained me three A levels. A levels are required for<br/>
  university entry. From the age of 16 therefore I didn&#39;t have to waste<br/>
  time on literature or art or history or anything else that I did not<br/>
  find interesting. I&#39;m guessing that isn&#39;t the same here. Am I right?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633955535">I go back and forth on it.  Sometimes I think Rachel should just take <br/>
the damn thing and be done with it.  I know she could pass it.  SHe <br/>
could have passed it years ago.  But then this part of me wants her <br/>
to be living proof that you don&#39;t need high school to be successful.  <br/>
She would not be the first to do so but it still would be cool.<br/>
In the end, it is up to her.<br/>
