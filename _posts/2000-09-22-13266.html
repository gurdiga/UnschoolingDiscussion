            -- Views from the world of learning in Japan --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the 22 September 2000 edition of KnoK (pronounced &quot;knock&quot;) <br/>
NEWS, an informal and periodic bulletin concerning issues of learning in <br/>
Japan. It is brought to you by the Covert family -- Kazumi, Kenya and <br/>
Brian -- a multicultural, homelearning family in Osaka, Japan.<br/>
<br/>
KnoK stands for *Kodomo no Kokoro*, meaning &quot;Heart of a Child&quot; in <br/>
Japanese. It is our belief that the heart of any child is indeed at the <br/>
center of true learning, wherever and however such learning may take <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
              &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDITOR&#39;S WELCOME: A hearty greeting to all on this first day of Autumn! <br/>
Yes, summer break is over in Japan, and the streets, parks, shops and <br/>
trains in our town seem eerily quiet with the schoolchildren now back in <br/>
classes.<br/>
<br/>
How long the students will stay there is anybody&#39;s guess, however. <br/>
Recently released data by the Japanese Ministry of Education confirms <br/>
that the number of Japanese students who were absent from schools <br/>
nationwide for 30 or more days exceeded 130,000, a record high, during <br/>
the 1999-2000 school year. And the figures show no sign of dropping in <br/>
the near future.  <br/>
<br/>
Many in Japanese academia are calling for educational reform one way or <br/>
the other. Among them are a couple of educators-cum-authors whose books <br/>
were recently reviewed in a trade publication in Japan, and which we <br/>
carry in this issue of KnoK NEWS strictly for informational purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are people like Akio Furuyama, a Japanese homelearning <br/>
advocate and mentor-teacher in his own right who envisions a Japan where <br/>
children learn for the pure joy of it. If you have read the opening pages <br/>
of the US-based &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; magazine (May/June 2000), <br/>
then you know that he is something of a writer as well.<br/>
<br/>
It is our great pleasure to carry an original article by Furuyama this <br/>
time as the debut of our new series, &quot;Voices of Japanese Homelearners.&quot; <br/>
The news media in Japan are paying much attention to homelearning as a <br/>
serious alternative to school, but even so, there are lots of Japanese <br/>
homelearning families out there whose voices are not getting heard at the <br/>
grassroots level. We have thus decided to offer a forum in KnoK NEWS <br/>
where Japanese homelearners can share their stories -- in their own words <br/>
-- with other homelearners and alternative educators around the globe. <br/>
Akio Furuyama&#39;s set of mini-essays and reflections here on lifelong <br/>
learning seems the perfect kickoff for our new series.<br/>
<br/>
So without further ado, and fresh from an extended summer break of our <br/>
own, we&#39;re back on the case with a full issue of KnoK NEWS. As always, <br/>
feel free to pass this around and share it with others.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
<br/>

*Bunsu ga deikinai daigakusei: Niju-isseiki no Nihon ga abunai*<br/>
[University Students Can&#39;t Do Fractions: Twenty-first-century Japan in <br/>
Peril]<br/>
[by] Okabe Tsuneharu et al., eds.<br/>
Toyo Keizai Shimposha, 1999<br/>
<br/>
While the country is poor in natural resources, Japan has developed on <br/>
the strength of its technology. Partly for that reason and partly because <br/>
of the image of fierce competition for school and university placement in <br/>
Japan, it is generally believed that the Japanese on the whole are strong <br/>
in mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
According to this book, that image is an illusion. In reality, he shows, <br/>
Japan&#39;s schools offer the lowest number of class hours devoted to <br/>
mathematics of any advanced industrial nation, and many of its <br/>
universities do not make mathematics a required subject in their entrance <br/>
examinations. Some 20 percent of students in top private universities, <br/>
according to a survey report, were unable to solve such elementary <br/>
mathematical equations as division of fractions. Based on comparison with <br/>
data from other countries, the book confirms the fact that the math <br/>
skills of Japanese college students have declined to a shockingly low <br/>
level, and considers what mathematics and other fundamental education <br/>
should be like in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Edited by members of the Nihon Sugaku Kai (Japan Mathematics Society), <br/>
the book conveys their strong commitment to reversing the course of the <br/>
already dire education crisis they encounter daily. The book attracted <br/>
considerable media attention, stirring up a lively public debate.<br/>

*Nihonjin wa naze Eigo ga dekinai ka*<br/>
[Why Japanese Are Poor at English]<br/>
[by] Suzuki Tadao<br/>
Iwanami Shoten, 1999<br/>
<br/>
Few of Japan&#39;s prime ministers throughout modern history have been <br/>
proficient enough in English to function in the international political <br/>
arena without the aid of interpreters. Such being the case for the <br/>
nation&#39;s top representatives, it is hardly surprising that the English <br/>
language skills of the vast majority of ordinary Japanese remain poor <br/>
even in the so-called age of internationalization. Despite six years of <br/>
English study in junior and senior high school and four years at the <br/>
university level, the degree of English proficiency of even well-educated <br/>
Japanese is low.<br/>
<br/>
The sociolinguist author of this book stresses the need to reform the <br/>
anachronistic and ineffectual approaches to English education in Japan so <br/>
as to cultivate real competence in the language. He argues that achieving <br/>
that goal requires a fundamental change in assumptions and would entail <br/>
such measures as making English a non-compulsory component of the school <br/>
curriculum and using only teaching materials with Japan-related content. <br/>
What is needed, he maintains, is to replace the conventional approach of <br/>
&quot;passive English,&quot; which is based mainly on understanding the West and <br/>
putting English into Japanese, with &quot;active English&quot; centered on <br/>
self-expression and the use of English to describe and explain Japan to <br/>
non-Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
To those ends, the author presents a convincing array of practical <br/>
suggestions based on his own experience in language education reform at <br/>
Keio University.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;OF CARS AND STARS&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By Akio Furuyama<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--Fantasy concerned with real life<br/>
<br/>
Children&#39;s spirits are always weaving a variety of stories. I find <br/>
aspects of their stories seem to change after they become 10 years old or <br/>
so: While children used to live in pure fantasy, now they are more <br/>
concerned with reality and they follow the nature of things they encounter.<br/>
<br/>
These &quot;things&quot; are called hobbies. Children are completely absorbed in <br/>
them. These hobbies are situated between pure fantasy and objective <br/>
reason; for children, hobbies are bridges leading to the real world.<br/>
<br/>
My 12-year-old nephew, who is homeschooling with me, is absorbed in cars <br/>
and fishing. He knows about sports cars, in particular. As we walk <br/>
through town, he  eagerly finds his favorite cars.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s a Nissan Sylvia S-13!&quot; &quot;A Honda NSX just passed by!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The cars seem almost the same to me, so I ask him how he recognizes them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That one has a big air-spoiler and....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He explains himself eloquently. I listen carefully, and though I think I <br/>
understand, I find his explanations have faded from my memory the next <br/>
day. I&#39;m not as keenly tuned in as he is.<br/>
<br/>
He remembers places through cars. When my nephew tries to point out a <br/>
place, he says something like: &quot;Near the parking lot where the Nissan <br/>
Skyline GTR is....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He has also made many plastic model cars and has assembled a big <br/>
radio-controlled car. He seems to know well about the general structure <br/>
of automobiles. He has many car-race video games, and talks of things <br/>
like the friction of the tires and &quot;inertia drift.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He seems to have learned much through cars. Yet I think there is more to <br/>
this kind of hobby than even my nephew lets on. He is building his own <br/>
bridge to the real world.<br/>
<br/>
--Glittering on the outside<br/>
<br/>
The force which leads a child is like something glittering in the outside <br/>
world. It is a force which almost seems to say: &quot;Come here, here&#39;s what <br/>
will fulfill your heart, what will spread your wings of fantasy, what <br/>
will help exert your brain and hands.&quot; Something very important happens <br/>
to a child when he or she pursues this &quot;glistening.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some children in Japan pursue insects; they know the many names of <br/>
insects and how to tame them. Some children remember all the <br/>
characteristics of &quot;Pocket Monsters,&quot; or Pokemon. Some busy themselves <br/>
with handicrafts. Some are absorbed in drawing *manga* (Japanese cartoons).<br/>
<br/>
While respecting each child&#39;s uniqueness, I have found a few points <br/>
common to most children&#39;s absorptions:<br/>
<br/>
(1) Children do an activity for the sake of doing it, because it is <br/>
fascinating.<br/>
(2) Children are sensitive to small differences. They know the shapes, <br/>
types and data of things.<br/>
(3) Children want to comprehend all kinds of objects, to put them in order.<br/>
(4) Children enjoy dramas and stories.<br/>
(5) Children&#39;s interests are contagious. One child&#39;s absorption induces <br/>
another&#39;s.<br/>
(6) Children communicate with each other through these hobbies.<br/>
<br/>
--A stone&#39;s throw from imagination<br/>
<br/>
Supporting these kinds of positive activities among children should be <br/>
the main dish of education. In these activities, will, emotions and <br/>
intelligence all work together in children, and help them to find a sense <br/>
of harmony. It doesn&#39;t seem to matter what the activity is: What is <br/>
important is that a child does it by his or her own will -- and <br/>
wholeheartedly.<br/>
<br/>
Although studying subjects is considered to be the major part of modern <br/>
education, it is a supplementary factor in the growth of children. What <br/>
good is knowledge if children are deprived of their own feelings and <br/>
their own will in the process of gaining that knowledge?<br/>
<br/>
Children are indeed in love with finding things; they pursue things that <br/>
fascinate them. I&#39;ve noticed that when children are about 12 years old, <br/>
they also become able to understand a cause-effect relationship in <br/>
matters which have nothing to do directly with them. They can achieve <br/>
substantial academic progress, if they have to.<br/>
<br/>
But children at this stage don&#39;t yet have a complete thinking ability. <br/>
Their thinking is still based more on the fantasy side. For them, <br/>
&quot;thinking&quot; requires body action, fun, beauty, vividness, pictures and so <br/>
on. A conclusion might well be summarized by following a mental line, but <br/>
it must also be touched, experienced, deduced and dramatized. The best of <br/>
school classes fosters this vividness -- but it could happen anywhere or <br/>
anytime, without any class or lecture.<br/>
<br/>
Children have in themselves the power to find direction, to figure out <br/>
what&#39;s around them, to find relationships between things. When they are <br/>
very young, this power appears as fantasy, and I see this fantasy as <br/>
developing in various ways: Fantasy will become science if it corresponds <br/>
well with cause-effect relationships. Fantasy will become ethics if it is <br/>
concerned with what one should do. Fantasy will become art if beauty and <br/>
impressions are what is pursued.<br/>
<br/>
I believe this is the way a child&#39;s intellect develops. After all, does <br/>
it not require a great deal of imagination for one to observe the force <br/>
of acceleration and momentum involved in the simple act of, say, throwing <br/>
a stone?<br/>
<br/>
--Space travel through stargazing<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago, an 11th-grade high school student said she wanted to <br/>
see some stars, so we walked to a nearby park and I offered some <br/>
explanations as we looked up at the night sky. She loved watching stars, <br/>
she said, because &quot;when I&#39;m watching stars, I become part of that world <br/>
and I feel like I&#39;m traveling in space.&quot; It wasn&#39;t long before she was <br/>
indeed completely immersed in the star world, remarking &quot;Oh, how <br/>
beautiful....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I myself could do this kind of &quot;space travel&quot; when I was young. I <br/>
remember I used to walk looking up at the night sky as I made my way to <br/>
and from a public bath. Forty years ago or so in Japan, only rich <br/>
families had their own baths in their homes. Watching the stars as I <br/>
walked along back then, I found myself traveling in space. This, for me, <br/>
was supreme bliss.<br/>
<br/>
So, it was a surprise to me that the girl could still do that kind of <br/>
space traveling when she was 17. But then again, maybe it&#39;s not all that <br/>
difficult. A completely new type of education might make it possible to <br/>
be both aesthetic and logical at the same time. It would be wonderful if <br/>
one could grow into adulthood with the world still aglitter. But then I <br/>
think of the reality of Japan&#39;s hellish examinations for entering <br/>
schools....and I sigh.<br/>
<br/>
To give more freedom to children. To assure their freedom to pursue that <br/>
which glitters. To let them be free of a life of struggling with given <br/>
tasks. These are very important for children. Likewise, they are <br/>
important for our personal happiness -- and for a better future for our <br/>
society.<br/>

Akio Furuyama (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:akiofrym@...">akiofrym@...</a>) was born in 1949 in the city <br/>
of Chiba, Japan. He has worked on the editorial staff of a Japanese <br/>
magazine. These days, he runs a small &quot;free school&quot; and *juku* (private <br/>
learning center) in Chiba. He has been assisting Japanese <br/>
&quot;school-refusing&quot; students for more than a decade, and for two years now <br/>
he has been homelearning with his nephew. Furuyama believes that <br/>
&quot;homeschooling is the most effective, the most flexible, and the cheapest <br/>
way of alternative education.&quot;<br/>

NATIONAL NEWSPAPER COVERAGE IN JAPAN:<br/>
<br/>
In case you missed earlier updates, here is a listing of recent press <br/>
coverage of homelearning and alternative education in Japan. Lately we <br/>
have been seeing a genuine interest by the Japanese news media -- at both <br/>
the local and national levels -- in covering these kinds of viable <br/>
choices to conventional schooling. The articles below were all carried in <br/>
newspapers with nationwide circulation, the coverage ranging in tone from <br/>
objective to supportive. More updates on Japanese news reports as they <br/>
develop.... <br/>
