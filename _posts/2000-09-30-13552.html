<div id="ygrps-yiv-490783983">I think this is really unfortunate... my son is in Scouts, and he is <br/>
constantly pleading with his best friend to be in Scouts too. He was sooo <br/>
disappointed when Cody didn&#39;t show up at Scout Night. However, Cody has two <br/>
moms. They don&#39;t flaunt, but they don&#39;t make their arrangement a secret, <br/>
either. They are very involved in their kids&#39; lives ... coaching soccer, <br/>
etc. I&#39;m sure they simply don&#39;t want their son to be part of a group that <br/>
officially denounces his parents. I think that&#39;s understandable. The group <br/>
is missing out on a great family, though, and Cody is missing out on a great <br/>
experience that could really benefit him. For now I guess we&#39;ll just go <br/>
camping as two families, and try to figure out what to do morally in the <br/>
future, when Tony figures out why his friend feels excluded from this group <br/>
that is supposedly for &quot;all boys.&quot;<br/>
