<br/>
When you go looking for a self-healing circle, please be sure you look for a<br/>
place that allows for full expression of all emotions, especially the<br/>
so-called negative ones (rage, sadness, etc). I am not talking about a<br/>
circle of people sitting around talking about how they feel or what they<br/>
have experienced, but rather people actually feeling and fully expressing<br/>
their feelings. This can be done without blaming someone else for our<br/>
feelings. Sometimes if a person just can&#39;t seem to get past blaming we set<br/>
up what we call a &#39;container&#39;. Then the person can vent and rage and blame<br/>
until they are finished, without anyone interrupting at all. Then the<br/>
process of &#39;cleaning up&#39; needs to happen, especially if the intensity is<br/>
between two people within the circle, say a husband and wife. We need to<br/>
sometimes be allowed to just vent, but the person receiving the &#39;vent&#39; needs<br/>
to have enough substance to NOT TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OTHER<br/>
PERSON&#39;S FEELINGS (not take things personally).<br/>
<br/>
Say a wife really needs to express some strong anger at her husband, doesn&#39;t<br/>
quite know how to do it without sounding like she is blaming him, she can<br/>
ask him to be a container for her. If he feels strong enough to handle her<br/>
rage without taking it on and then getting defensive - great. If he doesn&#39;t<br/>
feel strong enough to do that, the wife may have to pick someone else  to<br/>
take his place and he may be present as witness. In the end, whatever the<br/>
wife is feeling towards her husband has at the core very little to do with<br/>
her husband, but most likely originated within her own first family. The<br/>
purpose of circle is to get to the core of things and deal with them at that<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
I have come to believe that we choose our partners and draw out of our<br/>
partners the very things we need to heal in ourselves the most. That to me<br/>
is the main purpose for intimate relationships. The more intimate you get,<br/>
the greater the potential for healing for both partners.<br/>
<br/>
If you have trouble finding a self-healing circle where you are I could give<br/>
you some more info about exactly what we do and the tools we use and maybe<br/>
you could start your own self-healing circle. To begin with here is a<br/>
sample:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BEING IN CIRCLE by Sedonia Camu and Joshua Halpen<br/>
<br/>
Angeles Arrien says that we need to do four things to make our lives work<br/>
and they apply to being authentic in the circle as       She says we must<br/>
show up, pay attention, tell the truth, and not be attached to the outcome.<br/>
A circling community allows many opportunities to practice these skills by<br/>
teaching us to be fully present, to pay attention to our deepest impulses<br/>
and to be alert and aware of others. We learn to tell the truth so that we<br/>
can be deeply known just as we are while discovering more about our- selves.<br/>
Our commitment needs to be so great to these principles that we do them<br/>
regardless of the outcome. This means that we &quot;give away&quot; from the very best<br/>
of ourselves. What makes a circle safe for practising this radically<br/>
authentic behaviour, for going through public transformation is the unique<br/>
quality that arises when there is harmony between the personal and the<br/>
transpersonal.<br/>
This state of awareness, contained within a circle, generates an energy that<br/>
cannot come from any other place. This is what has been called in -many<br/>
traditions &quot;the Witness&quot;. To be an effective witness requires that we pay<br/>
attention, not project, interpret, judge, or try to &quot;Fix&quot; the other. There<br/>
is no room for interference in another&#39;s process. The witness is asked to<br/>
sit in his or her own circle of Power, pay attention, take responsibility<br/>
for what he or she is feeling, and not project his or her experience onto<br/>
the other. The only way to really see someone else is to fully own our<br/>
emotions, feelings, and thoughts.<br/>
The need to be really seen is as great as the need for food and shelter, yet<br/>
most of us go though life starving for reflection. We al I need to be seen<br/>
with eyes filled with love, acceptance, and adoration. There is terrible<br/>
loneliness and alienation when we feel no one sees, hears, or understands<br/>
us. This loneliness lingers in circles unless the quality of witnessing is<br/>
present.<br/>
Sometimes as part of witnessing, people go through a stage in which they<br/>
seem to know what they are feeling and they take the certainty that affords<br/>
them and assume they know what others are feeling. This is not witnessing.<br/>
For instance, sometimes when people feel afraid of another&#39;s pain they will<br/>
immediately reach out to hug or stroke them, which stops the process, or<br/>
they might come up with a solution to the other person&#39;s dilemma or discount<br/>
the other&#39;s feelings by saying it&#39;s not really so bad.<br/>
All these are the reactions of someone who is afraid of his or her own pain,<br/>
or someone who is not being in circle.<br/>
Learning how to witness is essential because we live in a time when great<br/>
numbers of people am beginning to tell their truths. Some of these truths<br/>
are hard to hear, some involve terrible childhood abuse and betrayal, yet<br/>
they must be told and heard. When they are not heard properly the telling is<br/>
undermined and damage, rather than healing, may result. It can take a long<br/>
time to regain the courage to tell the story again.<br/>
In the circle process, when people sit and speak from the deepest part of<br/>
themselves, no matter how wounded, how much anguish or how many tears, they<br/>
then, at that moment, are sitting in their circle of power. They need to be<br/>
witnessed, that is, to be respected for their willingness to go so deep and<br/>
be so vulnerable. What is required of us as witnesses is to sit in our own<br/>
circle of power, owning our own pain and fear, fully being with those<br/>
feelings and not projecting them outward.<br/>
Our stories need to be heard, not fixed. Nobody needs fixing, we are not<br/>
machines. All we need is to be heard. We need someone else to know- how hard<br/>
it was, to know, that we have survived with dignity and that we are not<br/>
afraid to feel. We as human beings need more than any- thing else to be<br/>
seen, known, felt, accepted, and loved.<br/>
When people are real in the circle we love them for their process of<br/>
becoming whole. We love each other for being who we are, with all our<br/>
perfections and imperfections. The essence of the process is to validate<br/>
that we are living, breathing, dancing, real people who feel pain and fear<br/>
and make mistakes, while living and caring about each other. The circle form<br/>
creates a place for everyone to work, pray, be real and feel at one with<br/>
each other, all together.<br/>
Being in a circle teaches us to respect ourselves and one another. When this<br/>
happens we are brought into an experience of immanence and sacredness,<br/>
making us better able to honour the beauty and integrity of the earth. If<br/>
enough people gather in circle and grapple with their identities within this<br/>
context, it enhances the possibilities for us all. Creative group dynamic is<br/>
essential if we are going to mobilize healing and create an ecological<br/>
environment for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how it goes. There are a lot more books that I would recommend,<br/>
such as &quot;Getting The Love You Want&quot; or &quot;Conscious Loving&quot;, and others. If<br/>
you want I will send you a list.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
