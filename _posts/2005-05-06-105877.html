<div id="ygrps-yiv-668215680">People complain about kids not writing sometimes, or say they don&#39;t know how <br/>
their kids will learn to write.   There&#39;s an odd kind of particular writing <br/>
called &quot;away messages&quot; (on Instant Messenger and such services),  and here are a <br/>
few of Kirby&#39;s:  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=========<br/>
Zolo Hexx:   Well, I&#39;m off to school to see what everyone was bitching about <br/>
for all those years!<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
Zolo Hexx:   <br/>
Hey! What are you looking at? Haven&#39;t you ever seen someone pick their nose <br/>
before? Geez...give a guy some privacy.<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
Zolo Hexx:   I&#39;m out with my Halo Gang. Yeah, I&#39;m in a gang... I do what I <br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
This one&#39;s a quote, and cited:<br/>
<br/>
Zolo Hexx:   You know, when a tomato grows out of your forehead, it gets you <br/>
thinking. What do we know about anything? Life is just a big, wild, crazy <br/>
tossed salad. But you don&#39;t eat it; no sir! You live it! Isn&#39;t it great? Isn&#39;t it <br/>
great? - The Tic<br/>
<br/>
===============<br/>
And this one he didn&#39;t cite but says it was on someone&#39;s blog and he liked it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Auto response from Zolo Hexx:  Checking away messages. It&#39;s like stalking, <br/>
but no one knows you are doing it. I even have people&#39;s names on my buddy list <br/>
that  I don&#39;t know, but I hear they have really good away messages. Some people <br/>
really  put their all into away messages. There are the people who document <br/>
their every  move: &quot;I am taking a shower, but when I get out, I am going to <br/>
pee, shave, and  then iron my pants. Call me if you need me before I go to the <br/>
mall at 2pm.&quot; Then  there&#39;s the creative one: &quot;I am away from my computer right <br/>
now.&quot; And of course  there&#39;s that one from the really cool guy: &quot;Yo its friday <br/>
night, I am drunk, and  not sittin up lookin at away messages&quot; Funny how that <br/>
guy never seems to go  idle.<br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s someone else&#39;s creative writing. &lt;g&gt;  Kirby says:<br/>
Zolo Hexx:   It was in something that they did for people to use in their <br/>
IM&#39;s.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Oh, like pre-recorded phone-machine messages, in the old days <br/>
when you put a tape in the machine, maybe?<br/>
SandraDodd:  Some people would buy famous-voice or humorous answering machine <br/>
tapes.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Like you can get custom &quot;You&#39;ve got mail&quot; and such.<br/>
Zolo Hexx:   Oh I know.<br/>
Zolo Hexx:   But yes, quite a bit like that.</div>
