<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982277825">My eldest son was adopted.  I didnt home school him.  I hadnt heard <br/>
of h/s then. He was 6months old when came to into my life.  I loved <br/>
him from the first time i set eyes on him.  I gave birth to 4 <br/>
children after Tommy.  I love them all equaly.<br/>
Once you adopt a child.  That child is yours just as if you had given <br/>
birth - so I cant see h/s being any different to h/s your own child.<br/>
Sorry...I am presuming the laws are the same in USA.<br/>
