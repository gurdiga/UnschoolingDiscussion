I have no single recommendation for a book (I have lots), but to  <br/>
remind you that books are outdated very quickly, but the etymology  <br/>
sites online are updated all the time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just as with any history, there are new discoveries made constantly,  <br/>
so my current favorite source is to go to google, put in the word,  <br/>
and &quot;etymology.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a page with a few things saved, but in general the internet is  <br/>
more useful than a single book.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/etymology">http://sandradodd.com/etymology</a><br/>
<br/>
But if you ARE going to use a book, get a dictionary with good  <br/>
etymologies.  After the words (root words, and English words, more  <br/>
likely than long technical terms or formations) there will be  <br/>
something that looks kind of like this:<br/>
<br/>

That was my favorite English teacher&#39;s fave too. I loved and only used American Heritage for years. <br/>
 <br/>
Then we got a mean teacher. MUST use Webster&#39;s. :-P~~~~*<br/>
 <br/>
Mrs. McColl was also my first Latin teacher---we both loved words and their origins. I still have the AH she required that first year.<br/>
 <br/>
I had never heard anyone else say anything nice---or even mention---the American Heritage until a few years ago on one of these lists when Sandra did.<br/>

good source. Here&#39;s a blurb from their website, which you have to join <br/>
to search (ridiculous fee, but most libraries probably have it):<br/>
<br/>
The Oxford English Dictionary is the accepted authority on the evolution <br/>
of the English language over the last millennium. It is an unsurpassed <br/>
guide to the meaning, history, and pronunciation of over half a million <br/>
words, both present and past. It traces the usage of words through 2.5 <br/>
million quotations from a wide range of international English language <br/>
sources, from classic literature and specialist periodicals to film <br/>
scripts and cookery books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-640315218">One of my all time favorite books on words. *When Is A Pig A Hog?  A Guide to Confoundingly Related English Words* By Bernice Randall <br/>
  Some of the topics:<br/>
  When is a batter a hitter?<br/>
  Are all lawyers attorneys?<br/>
  What is the difference between a couch, a sofa, a divan, and a settee?<br/>
  The difference between a second cousin and a first cousin once removed?<br/>
   <br/>
  Not so much on the origin of words like twilight, but more on why we call somethings different things that seem to be the same thing. &lt;g&gt; A book that has answered a ton of those *Mom, why is a ___ called a ___?* questions for me and mine. Also has some informative appendixes in the back. <br/>

<br/>
Oh yeah, I have that too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good for research for medieval-text purposes, but for everyday  <br/>
origins of words, American Heritage is more interesting.  The  <br/>
American Heritage Dictionary used to be (isn&#39;t so much anymore, I  <br/>
don&#39;t think, but I could be wrong) based around the Indo-European  <br/>
Language research that was big in vogue in the 1960&#39;s and for a while  <br/>
following, and that wasn&#39;t as well known when the OED was put  <br/>
together.  I like both of them, but someone asked for ONE book. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The OED used to be available to members of the Quality Paperback  <br/>
Bookclub, but I could never get it to access from my computer so I  <br/>
quit the book club.  I think it&#39;s a huge shame they didn&#39;t just get  <br/>
sponsors and make it freely available.<br/>
<br/>
I have the two-volume reduced-print OED that lots of people got for  <br/>
$30 or so in the 1970&#39;s and 80&#39;s by joining Book of the Month Club.   <br/>
It comes with a great magnifying glass.  I used to be able to read it  <br/>
without the magnifying glass.  Now I use the magnifying glass for  <br/>
other things, too.  &quot;Years have passed.&quot;  My eyes are getting old. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-The Oxford English Dictionary is the accepted authority on the  <br/>

guide to the meaning, history, and pronunciation of over half a million<br/>
words, both present and past.-=-<br/>
<br/>
AND, until the recent revision, it was put together from 3x5 cards  <br/>
(or the British equivalent) all done by hand, and all typeset and  <br/>
proofread.  That&#39;s the edition I have on paper, and that many  <br/>
libraries have in umpty-I-forget-how-many volumes.   The online  <br/>
edition is said to have lots of newer stuff too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not recommending my Origins book by Eric Partridge for that<br/>
purpose. <br/>
  In my opinion, it&#39;s primarily a linguistics book with a dash of <br/>
dictionary too.  Laid out like an old thesaurus-- cumbersome to find <br/>
things until you&#39;re used to it but not unhandy, and interesting in it&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
own way.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy reading the abbreviations.  Gothic was a language.  Huh, didn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
know that.  I thought Gothic was all about architecture and these days <br/>
about dark teens and other things.  Had no idea it was an actual <br/>
language, maybe still is?<br/>
<br/>
For whoever&#39;s interested....<br/>
Twelve is discussed under &quot;two&quot; --paragraph 2.  There&#39;s twelve our <br/>
familiar English word but follow the use of the same word in other <br/>
languages, Old Frisian, Old Saxon, Gothic, Old High and Middle High <br/>
German to the current German word, which is from Old Norse and then on <br/>
to something about Lithuanian formation and the English eleven.  Fun. <br/>
I <br/>
like the quote page right before the contents page which says:<br/>
<br/>
                    Philologists who chase<br/>
A Panting syllable through time and space,<br/>
Start it at home, and hunt it in the dark,<br/>
To Gaul, to Greece, and into Noah&#39;s Ark.<br/>
                       Cowper, Retirement<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the entry on twelve in Origins:<br/>
<br/>
Twelve, ME twelve, earlier twelf, comes from OE twelf: cf OFris twelef,<br/>
<br/>
twelif, twelf, tolef--OS twelif--Go twalife OHG-MHG zwelif, G<br/>
zwÃ¶lf--ON <br/>
tÅlf: lit, (10+) 2 leave, i.e. left over: for the formation, cf Lith <br/>
dvÃ½-lika--and E ELEVEN, Twelfth, ME twelfthe, earlier twelfte, comes <br/>
from OE twelfta (from twelf): cf OFris twelefta, twilifta, tol(e)fta.<br/>
