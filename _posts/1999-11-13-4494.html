Hi, Crys, <br/>
<br/>
I, for one, do not think you are being paranoid.  Realistic. <br/>
<br/>
For some reason, drug safety hit me when I first read your post.  So, I<br/>
just wanted to rattle off some thoughts on that issue.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to mention some pointers that saved me in ADULT situations<br/>
later in life, as well as younger years, if I may.  My father was a police<br/>
officer.  He took every opportunity to warn us of dangers of drugs.  Many<br/>
dangers, for that matter, that stayed with me.  As a child I often pondered<br/>
why he repeated these warnings at EVERY opportunity.  &quot;I know, I know&quot;, I&#39;d<br/>
think.  But you know what, this is the one area, where repetitiveness<br/>
really pays off!  To this day, I will NEVER cross over a rail road with the<br/>
bars down.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, please consider teaching them to NEVER go back to food or<br/>
drink they have turned from.  No matter how &quot;close&quot; their friends.  My<br/>
father drilled this into me.  I never forgot, years later, my father&#39;s<br/>
words resounding in my ears as the news reported a five year old little<br/>
girl on an acid trip, because someone at school put it in her milk, when<br/>
she wasn&#39;t looking.  And the report explained how she could have those<br/>
recurring trips for the rest of her life!<br/>
<br/>
Look to channels such as The History Cannel and The Learning Channel (both<br/>
online.  Our son abhors smoking.  But thanks to an old TV show, he saw the<br/>
old &quot;glamour&quot; stand, and imitated it as I myself did at his age.  While he<br/>
is only 7, I still took advantage of a recent documentary.  One of the<br/>
three part episodes, we recorded and played.  It showed a woman with a<br/>
trach, and a man frail and dying, etc.  It had a major impact!  These<br/>
documentaries on drugs can be fantastic (but you may want to record them,<br/>
and be sure it is what your looking for). <br/>
<br/>
It may seem even more paranoid, and you may have already taught them this,<br/>
but they should be very leery of anything their friends give them. <br/>
Particularly at party settings.  I had a VERY VERY close friend tell me he<br/>
put &quot;nothing&quot; in the brownies.  Well, those ol&#39; Barney Miller runs ran<br/>
through my head, and something went off in me.  It turned out that he lied<br/>
to me, and another friend (knowing I did not do drugs) told me that he&#39;d<br/>
put pot or hash in them.  This is where my father&#39;s words really came to<br/>
life!<br/>
<br/>
Young children should not even lick &quot;stamps&quot; that other children give them<br/>
(teach &#39;em to use a sponge).  I know, I&#39;m sounding paranoid (I live in NY -<br/>
LOL).  But it is true.  They are lacing stamps with drugs now!  It hooks<br/>
the children and they don&#39;t realize why, and come back for more.  They<br/>
gradually increase it, till they are hooked.<br/>
<br/>
On last drug problem, that many of us forget (one I have not brought to my<br/>
son&#39;s attention yet), &quot;snuffing&quot;.  I read in a Reader&#39;s Digest article,<br/>
about a boy who was homeschooled until his teen years.  :When he went to<br/>
school, he was introduced to it.  The parents had no clue what was<br/>
happening.  The boy was found dead in his bathtub.  Snuffing is the<br/>
practice of sniffing glue and whip cream aerosols (being the two most<br/>
common aerosols), markers, etc.  You would be surprised how many products<br/>
in the home are &quot;snuff&quot; products.  Most children don&#39;t realize how<br/>
dangerous this is.  It doesn&#39;t occur to them it is a drug.  Many children<br/>
die on the first &quot;snuff&quot; experience.  Children (and many adults) don&#39;t<br/>
realize how dangerous this is. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, look around.  Aside from the history and learning channels, life is<br/>
a great lesson in this.  Look in the library for documentaries on drug<br/>
rehab.  Watching folks coming off drugs is a great lesson.  And watching a<br/>
child is an even greater lesson!  Especially the babies born to it.  These<br/>
documentaries can be chilling.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, a local drug rehab center may offer pamphlets and information.  A<br/>
visit / &quot;filed trip&quot; may be valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I recently took myself off a medication (I hadn&#39;t taken<br/>
prescription drugs in years!) that I was told was &quot;non-addictive&quot; (as my<br/>
pharmacist put it, any drug is potentially addictive).  I suffered from<br/>
horrific violent vomiting, shakes and sweats for two weeks!   I used this<br/>
opportunity to show my son that this was from a drug a doctor gave me, and<br/>
that drugs that are not from doctors are even worse!  Every day, as I went<br/>
through this, I reminded him.  If my experience was to save him in later<br/>
life, I am thankful for it.  (Don&#39;t do this to yourself on purpose, however<br/>
- LOL.  I&#39;m just saying that it was an opportunity, and it had an impact.)<br/>
<br/>
Some might say that you don&#39;t need these impacts to teach your children. <br/>
Maybe not.  I know they saved me, especially as I got older, as did my<br/>
faith in the Lord.  And, when it comes to drugs, the harsh reality is that<br/>
they are a harsh, frightening reality, with an impact.<br/>
<br/>
I hope at least some of this is useful.  Take Care!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434724884">Goodness I hardly know where to being in this discussion. Having been a<br/>
registered nurse for 10 years, having worked extensively with addicted<br/>
individuals and having educated myself extensively on this issue ..... I<br/>
have a few things to say.  I don&#39;t know if any of the things I am going<br/>
to say are actually at odds with much in the previous post.  I know I<br/>
have had numerous (when young) experiences of just missing out on being<br/>
drugged by my own paranoid tendencies, cookies, punch, bottles of beer,<br/>
I always was paranoid at the right moment on qt least 4 separate<br/>
occasions.  Drugs didn&#39;t agree with me...except alcohol which I<br/>
absolutely loved at first drink. That being said......<br/>
<br/>
The search for altered states of consciousness has been a human<br/>
endeavour for as far back as one can look.  This occurs in both sacred<br/>
and secular contexts.<br/>
<br/>
Humans are experimenting creatures.  There are definitely dangers<br/>
associated with this proclivity.<br/>
<br/>
Most people who experiment with drugs (in the broadest definition of<br/>
drugs e.g. nicotine, caffeine, alcohol,) do not become addicted.  Of all<br/>
of the available drugs nicotine is the most addictive and dangerous in<br/>
terms of health consequences.  Alcohol would come second.  &quot;Hard&quot; drugs<br/>
do not come close to destroying as many lives as nicotine and alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
Inhalants are very dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Most people who are addicted to substances have multiple problems of<br/>
which addiction is one.<br/>
<br/>
Most addicted people recover from their addictions on their own without<br/>
professional assistance.<br/>
<br/>
Addicted individuals who are unable to deal with their addictions are<br/>
often people who have histories of physical, mental, emotional, and/ or<br/>
sexual abuse which contributes to their addiction problems.<br/>
<br/>
There are strong puritanical, anti-pleasure, Calvinistic currents within<br/>
some of the anti-drug thinking that currently holds sway with many<br/>
people.  This confuses the issue and makes it difficult to educate<br/>
people as to the real dangers of drugs.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion the Multinational Drug Cartel (which has two branches i.e.<br/>
legal [pharmaceutical] and illegal) and the Multinational Criminal<br/>
Justice Industry are partners in crime.  There is collusion with the<br/>
Medical, psychiatric, &quot;health&quot; industry in addition to the Media related<br/>
industry.  And of course the Education Industry is a beneficiary of our<br/>
absurd public policy.<br/>
<br/>
Generally people who come from intact, functional families (not a huge<br/>
number) don&#39;t have major drug problems.  Of course many people who come<br/>
from grossly dysfunctional families don&#39;t think that they do because<br/>
mystification is a common phenomena in dysfunctional families.  Combine<br/>
that with the dysfunctional nature of many of our &quot;normal&quot; values and<br/>
you have most people thinking such things as: war is a necessary evil,<br/>
there are always going to be rich and poor people, you can&#39;t fight city<br/>
hall and an endless list of platitudes which are the basis for the<br/>
almost slave like mentality of the majority.<br/>
<br/>
The war on drugs has militarized the police, destroyed entire<br/>
communities, enriched the prison industry, discarded fundamental civil<br/>
liberties and rights, spread drug use around the world, maintained<br/>
artificially high prices and corrupted most police agencies.<br/>
<br/>
Drug use is a public health problem to the extent that it is a problem.<br/>
The criminalization of &quot;bad&quot; drugs has marginalized entire segments of<br/>
the population.<br/>
<br/>
The chaos generated by our irrational (in relation to the public<br/>
interest, perfectly rational from the above mentioned cartel&#39;s<br/>
interests) policy has harmed millions.<br/>
<br/>
Children have been lied to about the nature of drugs, drug use,<br/>
addiction in the same ways they have been lied to about the nature of<br/>
learning, education, and things as basic as &quot;feelings&quot;.  This greatly<br/>
increases the risks of them throwing out the rational cautions with the<br/>
silly hogwash.<br/>

   I agree with you completely on this!  I have a cousin who has been in and <br/>
out of jail for most of his life, all because of his heroin addiction.  The <br/>
last time he went in, it was because he was found with heroin on him, not an <br/>
amount which was considered intent to sell, just a user&#39;s amount.  He was <br/>
sentenced under California&#39;s wonderful three strikes you&#39;re out law and given <br/>
30 years.  <br/>
   The laws regarding drugs are absurd and hypocritical in their enforcement. <br/>
 It really bothers me that many of the people enforcing them used drugs <br/>
recreationally/experimentally themselves as teenagers.  It&#39;s a do as I say <br/>
not as I do approach so typical of adults.  I know drugs can ruin lives but I <br/>
see no reason to compound that by filling the jails with users.  <br/>

Gee, this is such a common theme I am hearing from all of you, and I am a<br/>
bit confused.  Where did those of you who were, or almost were,<br/>
&quot;Unknowingly drugged&quot; or had it happening to others around you live or grow<br/>
up?  I never had this happen to me or anyone that I know.  I had friends<br/>
that took things which were not what they thought (bad or laced acid, laced<br/>
marijuana, etc) but never completely innocently and unknowingly drugged.  I<br/>
am just wondering when and where this was commonly happening.<br/>

then, I grew up in San Francisco, having lived there between the ages of 2<br/>
and 20.  However, the time frame explains the &quot;accidental&quot; drug use.  That<br/>
was a very innocent time in the US and young people were pretty naive in<br/>
general and just exploring recreational drug use on a large scale, as well<br/>
as a number of other social issues, to say the least.  When I was growing<br/>
up in the city, it was common to run into marijuana laced with all manner<br/>
of nasty stuff like crystal meth, pcp, etc and one had to know what to look<br/>
for to be safe (not me, but people I knew.)  It was common knowledge on the<br/>
street.  Drugs were easy to come by and could be had free in many<br/>
situations, and if you wanted (like me) to avoid being under the infuluence<br/>
you had to be pretty savvy and on your toes.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a teenager you could get Crack Cocainne on a street corner in<br/>
the Haight Ashbury as easily as marijuana, acid and many, many other things.<br/>
