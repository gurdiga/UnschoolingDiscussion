<div id="ygrps-yiv-346729728">The Family Unschoolers Network ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.org">http://www.unschooling.org</a> ) <br/>
announces the following interview opportunity for April 17-24, 2001:<br/>
<br/>
The New York Daily News is working on an article about homeschooling <br/>
and is looking for families to interview from Brooklyn, Manhattan, <br/>
Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx. They would like to have <br/>
families in each of the boroughs that they can spend a few hours with <br/>
to observe a &quot;typical day.&quot; If that is not possible, they may settle <br/>
for an interview by phone. They want to be able to present a variety <br/>
of perspectives and we would like them to see that the &quot;school-at-<br/>
home&quot; crowd isn&#39;t typical of all homeschoolers. With the pending <br/>
legislation in New York, this may provide a good opportunity to <br/>
influence public opinion.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in participating in this interview opportunity, <br/>
please contact Greg Gittrich at the New York Daily News. Here are the <br/>
