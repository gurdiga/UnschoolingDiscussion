 It was suggested to read Adelle Faber books.  I need<br/>
 someone to walk me thru this.  How many books has she<br/>
 written and which one should I read first?  If I ever<br/>
 heard of Adelle Faber it went in one ear and out the<br/>
 other. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well,.you&#39;re not going to find them just anywhere!! She self published....an <br/>
unschooling Mom in Australia.<br/>
I have all three if you really want them. It&#39;s a lot about their school <br/>
system,but much of it applies to anyone.<br/>
More based on school damage.<br/>
email me your address and you can have them.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

I had a major brain fart!!! Her name jumped out at me because I have the &quot;How <br/>
to talk so kids will listen&quot; and some other books of hers and I haven&#39;t read <br/>
them in a long time...BUT I read an Adeles books recently and it was Adele <br/>
CARRALL....duh.<br/>
Sorry for the mislead.<br/>
I guess I need to slow down. :)<br/>
