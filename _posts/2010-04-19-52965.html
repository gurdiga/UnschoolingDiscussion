<div id="ygrps-yiv-944620321">Hi all,  <br/>
<br/>
Our family recently moved to another state and we are now living closer to relatives. One of them is a cousin with children the same age and we&#39;ve gotten together on a couple of occasions. Most of the time, the kids enjoy themselves and constantly ask about their cousins and want to get together. But there have been at least 3 instances where the oldest child has been hostile to my 7 yr old son. <br/>
<br/>
 (1) Kids were playing with foam swords and my son hit the boy in the cheek (he was aiming for the shoulder)and because he didn&#39;t apologize when the kid asked him to, he proceeded to do a choke hold on my son. The boy&#39;s mom and I were just outside the room so we went quickly inside and she &quot;disciplined&quot; her son (talked to, apology to my son and grounded in his room). (2) We go to the same church and the kids were together for a particular event. They were singing and the kid decided that because my son chose not to sing, it would be ok to hit him in the face &quot;because he is just plain silly&quot;. My son didn&#39;t react to this and told us in the car on the way home. (3) Today at church, kids had to be together again for another event and same situation with the songs, only this time he used force to open and close my son&#39;s mouth. This time a teacher saw him and he was stopped. Oh and he also asked my son&#39;s help in stealing some other kid&#39;s book to which my son flatly refused.   <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had discussions about what might work and my son has come up with a few things he thinks will do the trick but when the situation happens again, he does nothing because he says that (1) he&#39;ll get in trouble (at Church, not at home) (2) the cousin is stronger (3) he just stunned and doesn&#39;t know what to do at the moment. <br/>
<br/>
For now my mother&#39;s instinct is telling me to limit our family&#39;s interaction with theirs and just be there for my son, but I do worry because we&#39;ll keep seeing them at family gatherings (where I can see what&#39;s happening) and at Church (where I can&#39;t).  And sadly, this might not be the last time he has to deal with a bully. <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Marilu</div>

<br/>
When my 2 older children are fighting (boys ages almost 7 and 4 1/2) I like to get involved by jumping in with an exciting game that is really, really fun for all of us.  AT their ages they like cops and robbers.  They bond as robbers in jail (the couch) and I &quot;fall asleep&quot; next to the jail with my &quot;keys&quot; hanging off me that they steal and then escape.  The 2 year old gets in on it too.  Lots of whooping and laughing at silly ol&#39; Mom.  :o)  It distracts them number 1, it builds their bond and our family bond, and gives them really positive memories and examples to draw from for when they are alone again (with me in the next room) and they maybe feel stuck.  I have seen them choose those same games again to help themselves out.  The oldest has gotten very good at saving face for himself and for his brother. In essence, he is learning to choose what feels more joyful and bypassing the fight (sometimes).  Perhaps in your case, you can do something with both of them that gets them laughing and really enjoying each other&#39;s company.  Share with them by your own joy what you clearly adore about each of them.  <br/>
<br/>
 ****and at Church (where I can&#39;t).  And sadly, this might not be the last time he has to deal with a bully.*****<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m unclear why you added this?  It struck me that you might be saying that there is something good to be derived from learning to put up with and/or defend one&#39;s self against a bully...?  Is that what you were thinking?  I don&#39;t think I need to get into a car accident to learn how I&#39;m going to deal with future car accidents.  If he can not be alone with this cousin for the time being, then I&#39;d say find a way.  Can he be with you in your part of the church for now?   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889619288">===we&#39;ll keep seeing them at family gatherings (where I can see what&#39;s happening)===<br/>
<br/>
At family gatherings, would you feel comfortable hanging out with your son and whichever of the cousins he enjoys playing with (if you don&#39;t do this already)? <br/>
<br/>
My son is very nonconfrontational and has some younger cousins who can be quite pushy. He&#39;s 11 and is a bit more comfortable now speaking up to them if they&#39;re being pushy, but when he was younger he didn&#39;t like doing that, so at family gatherings my husband or I would often hang out with the kids -- the kids had fun with us and we with them, and Andrew knew we were right there to help if a cousin started being pushy and he wasn&#39;t able to find a way through it on his own. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===and at Church (where I can&#39;t)===<br/>
<br/>
What are some options for church? Can he stay with you rather than go to Sunday School (or wherever the kids are segregated to)? If he can&#39;t stay with you, can you go with him, maybe serve as an extra pair of hands for his group? Can you worship at a different time? I know some churches have two or three services on the weekend -- maybe your family could attend a service not attended by the family of that particular cousin? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the dynamics are with your extended family re: church, but I think your son feeling safe at church should be the priority, and I think it&#39;s important that he knows it&#39;s a priority. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He can stay with us and has been with us occasionally, but he chooses to go to the Sunday class. He&#39;s in a different group than his cousin, so the don&#39;t see each other except for when they do special gatherings with all children in the same age group.  <br/>

Because he would rather go to Sunday School, I think registering as a volunteer and definitely being there whenever they have these large group gatherings will help. <br/>

like to but the parents themselves are such bullies to their own kids<br/>
and tho I have subtly talked about *me* in the context of not using<br/>
punishment, it&#39;s the elephant in the room.<br/>

I love how the parents and the other children were responsive to your daughter. I&#39;ll talk it over with my son and see how he feels about it.<br/>
I&#39;m sure my cousin would like to know how her son is behaving and hopefully it might lead to additional conversation between them as a family a better understanding of their son. I do worry about how the dad will take it, he tends to be very strict and authoritative &quot;what I says go&quot; type. <br/>

Maybe that&#39;s where the son is getting his &quot;what I say goes&quot; behavior.<br/>
<br/>
And he&#39;s not your dad.  The most he is is your brother-in-law, right?   <br/>
(or brother)<br/>
He&#39;s not the authoritative strict dad of you.<br/>
<br/>
Are you worried that the other boy will be punished and then come back  <br/>
for another round on your son?  That would be my worry, if anything.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could start the conversation with something like &quot;Bob (or  <br/>
whatever the strict authoritative dad is), I know you tend to be short  <br/>
and commanding, but I&#39;m here for a discussion of solutions, not for  <br/>

not be able to pull that off, and that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t come in  <br/>
meekly and let him take over the situation and &quot;manage&quot; you all.<br/>

Maybe your request for a discussion could be in writing so you could  <br/>
say things about how you don&#39;t want it to go.  And they could talk to  <br/>
their child before you get there.  That might help.<br/>

<br/>
I once was the &quot;parent monitor&quot; for a group of boys on break from an intense choir rehearsal. As I watched them mill about indoors on a rainy day, I noticed one boy hit several others as they walked by him. Actually, he put his arm, with a clenched fist, out in front of them like a gate. But he carefully timed it so he was actually hitting the boys with his forearm as they walked by.<br/>
<br/>
I walked over and told him to stop hitting the other boys. First, he denied that what he was doing was hitting! He then told me, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s ok that I&#39;m hitting them because I&#39;m making them behave!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I replied that it wasn&#39;t his job to make the others behave; that was my job. His job was just to make himself behave. Then he suggested that he was helping me with my job. I told him that his type of help was against the rules--&quot;hands to yourself&quot; was on the rules list. I said the kind of help he could give me was to come and tell me if kids were behaving badly. And then, of course, I stayed near him for the rest of the break.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that your nephew has a similar idea, or at least, is using this sort of logic to justify what he&#39;s doing to your son. So, I would first talk to him. I just have a feeling that a discussion among the adults might go badly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-188507500">You know I kind of agree with Meg about one thing. I have seen many<br/>
kids who don&#39;t listen to their parents and don&#39;t care what they say or<br/>
think or do. Once adults are out of sight, they do as they please<br/>
often because of years of parental demands and disrespect. And if the<br/>
parent bullies their kids or other people (often they do but not<br/>
always), then they may even side with their kid who bullies, covertly<br/>
or openly. Some people have a deep seated belief that violence works<br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to keep my kid away from some folks like these for a<br/>
loooonggg time and when the family called wondering if everything was<br/>
ok, I knew words were still going to be worthless. I said &quot;no, but<br/>
we&#39;re tied up around here anyway, and sorry not to have phoned sooner<br/>
(which I vaguely was).&quot; I don&#39;t care how likable people are otherwise,<br/>
some behavior might need periods of cooling it to put people on notice<br/>
(if that&#39;s the way they think of it) or create a sense of scarcity for<br/>
our being around and maybe greater appreciation of the less frequent<br/>
visiting that we have begun to do on occasion. This is the kind of<br/>
family that isn&#39;t trusted by any of us here in our house, and we have<br/>
tried to many times over.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the OP&#39;s situation. But in general, confrontation<br/>
isn&#39;t the only answer in these things unless there&#39;s no way to<br/>
distance yourself.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Avoid&quot; or &quot;detach from&quot; might be a better thing to show children than  <br/>
&quot;dumping.&quot;<br/>
Especially in the case of children, everything might be totally  <br/>
different and better with a little maturity.<br/>
That happens with men in their 20&#39;s too. Many of them calm down and  <br/>
become responsible in their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s.  Those who were &quot;dumped&quot;  <br/>
won&#39;t be around to redeem themselves, but those who were temporarily  <br/>
avoided are still near enough to make things right and good.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, the neighbor kids came over to play with Margaux.  As often happens, they were bickering with one another, the younger boy started crying, so Margaux was trying to find out why he was so upset and the older sister wouldn&#39;t stop talking.  Margaux very loudly and rather impolitely told her to shut it.  The girl, understandably got upset, but then went on to threaten and intimidate Margaux, and fighting ensued that led to the neighbor kids threatening to leave and Margaux telling them &quot;fine, just leave then jackass.&quot; (when I heard that, it was said loudly, I went running back)<br/>
<br/>
This happened within 5 min. of being in our house.  As they were leaving I was running back to the room where Margaux was.  I asked if they were leaving, the older girl said that they were leaving because Margaux was being mean.  I told them that I would go and ask Margaux what happened to find out how to help.  They didn&#39;t wait around, they left.  Margaux was crying and upset and after I got her to calm down, she told me all of what happened.  She said she never wanted to play with them ever again.  I told her that she didn&#39;t have to if she really didn&#39;t want to, but if she did, then she could and I promised that I&#39;d stay very near by from now on so that it never gets to that level of frustration.  She liked that idea better than never playing with them again.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they play nicely together and sometimes they don&#39;t.  Those kids are routinely frustrated at home and sometimes they come over with loads of frustration built up, like a taught spring.  Anything will trigger that spring, and many times Margaux does, and gets hit by it.  Margaux is not a kid that will sit back quietly and just take it, nor will she play the manipulation game that they do.  It makes it more difficult for Margaux to get along with some kids, but I&#39;d rather her be that way and help her, than for her to say or do nothing and act as if all that stuff is normal!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752988408">We all *like* the adults I&#39;m talking about. We just don&#39;t have as much<br/>
in common as we used to. That might change over time into a greater or<br/>
lesser degree of likeness. It&#39;s sort of like a movie I might watch all<br/>
the way to the end or I might not. :)<br/>
