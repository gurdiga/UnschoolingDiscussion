&lt;&lt; There are days Crispin just cries all day long and I <br/>
have no idea why, look at his mouth, his butt, feel his tummy, take him <br/>
to the Chiropractor, let him lay in the middle of the floor and scream <br/>
and feel like a failure.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to have a great list when Kirby was little of fifty things to try when <br/>
babies are crying.  I&#39;ll go and see if it&#39;s online somewhere, but I remember <br/>
some were &quot;take some clothes off or put more clothes on&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;more light, or less light&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;walk in a stroller&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;bath or water play&quot;<br/>
<br/>

Read, every day, something that no one else is reading.<br/>
Think, every day, something that no one else is thinking.<br/>
Do, every day, something no one else would be silly enough to do.<br/>
It is bad for the mind to continually be part of unanimity.<br/>
