<div id="ygrps-yiv-36093260"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Norma, here.  Back from our great weekend adventure<br/>
&gt;under the stars and the beautiful total lunar<br/>
&gt;eclipse.  We just had the Jane Goodall <br/>
&gt;exhibit at our Museum Center so we had recently<br/>
&gt;learned all about Roots and Shoots.  Here is the web<br/>
&gt;site with all the information:<br/>
&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/">http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/</a><br/>
<br/>
&gt;It is pretty basic, not much indoctrination at all. <br/>
&gt;There are a bunch of links at the bottom of the web<br/>
&gt;page on how to start something in your area.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Norma, for the info.  I&#39;ve been all over the<br/>
website before and, as you say, it is very basic. <br/>
Which leads me to believe that, like every other such<br/>
organization, not all the details and guidelines can<br/>
be found there on the website, and that you would need<br/>
a handbook of some sort to get the real lowdown.  <br/>
<br/>
The link on &quot;creating a group&quot; for your community says<br/>
&quot;After you have decided on a leader for your group,<br/>
fill out the membership form..&quot; pay the money, etc. <br/>
So you have to get a group together, choose a leader<br/>
who makes a commitment to head the group, and pay the<br/>
money, without the benefit of any more information<br/>
than the basic outlines on the website?  There is<br/>
still no mention there that you will get an<br/>
information packet or more detailed guidelines or<br/>
anything after you pay for membership either.  <br/>
<br/>
I mean, for legal protection, these organizations have<br/>
to have some legal guidelines about what they are, and<br/>
are not, and what their members do, and what they do<br/>
not do.  I have been trying to find out where I can<br/>
get that information.  I&#39;d love to get a hold of a<br/>
copy of their guidelines, or a handbook, if they have<br/>
such a thing.  I am doubting that the website contains<br/>
all the information there is, since it is so brief and<br/>
basic.  What are the membership monies paying for, if<br/>
they don&#39;t offer support, materials kits for projects<br/>
and activities (even for sale,) feedback,<br/>
encouragement, networking and guidelines to their<br/>
members?  It&#39;s all very foggy, and maybe why more<br/>
people have not heard of Roots and Shoots.  Which is a<br/>
shame, because it seems to be a potentially great<br/>
alternative to the other, more militarily based kids<br/>
groups.<br/>

Here is what it says your &quot;benefits&quot; are for forming a local group:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Becoming part of the worldwide network of Roots & Shoots groups, <br/>
which are making a positive difference in the world.  <br/>
<br/>
Receiving the Roots & Shoots Manual, which is full of suggestions on <br/>
starting a group, planning projects and incorporating the program <br/>
into your classroom, organization, family and community.  <br/>
<br/>
Receiving the semiannual Roots & Shoots Network newsletter, which <br/>
features letters from Dr. Jane, articles about R&S activities around <br/>
the world, new ideas for projects and the &quot;Bulletin Board,&quot; a poster <br/>
that enables groups in different countries to share ideas and <br/>
information.  <br/>
<br/>
Keeping track of the latest developments in the Jane Goodall <br/>
Institute&#39;s research, conservation and educational programs worldwide <br/>
through the annual Jane Goodall Institute World Report.  <br/>
<br/>
Sharing ideas, inspiration and once-in-a-lifetime experiences at one <br/>
of the Roots & Shoots summits: the Roots & Shoots North American <br/>
Summit, the Roots & Shoots College Summit or the Roots & Shoots <br/>
International Summit.  <br/>
<br/>
Receiving a Roots & Shoots Certificate of Recognition, signed by Dr. <br/>
Jane, for reporting the progress of service projects that address <br/>
each of the program&#39;s three themes.  <br/>
<br/>
Becoming part of our global youth network, Partnerships in <br/>
Understanding, to share ideas with young people in other countries, <br/>
enhance cultural awareness and learn about global environmental and <br/>
humanitarian issues.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to find out more ahead of time I would contact them <br/>
directly, maybe find out if there is someone else with a Roots and <br/>
Shoots group in your area that you could meet with and talk to, look <br/>
over the manual and other information.  That might give you a better <br/>
idea of what they are all about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600078291">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I started our Roots & Shoots group just over a year<br/>
ago.  We had originally thought we&#39;d start a Campfire<br/>
family club.  The director here in Tucson was very<br/>
enthusiastic & had homeschooled her daughter.  But we<br/>
didn&#39;t want to sell candy bars, which was a<br/>
requirement.  I heard about Roots & Shoots somewhere<br/>
(I actually think it was a link from another<br/>
homeschool list) & I followed up & it has been a lot<br/>
of fun!<br/>
<br/>
I did pay the $ and received the manual. From my<br/>
welcome letter - <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The most important thing to remember is that you will<br/>
be working on service projects that address three<br/>
areas:<br/>
Care and Concern for the Environment<br/>
Care and Concern for Animals<br/>
Care and Concern for the Human Community&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The manual includes 12 core sections: <br/>
program overview<br/>
members in action<br/>
grass-roots spirit<br/>
getting started<br/>
group meetings<br/>
project planning<br/>
keeping track<br/>
fundraising<br/>
going public<br/>
safety and risk management<br/>
notes from africa<br/>
resource bibliography<br/>
<br/>
I receive the Roots & Shoots newsletter & am on the<br/>
R&S leaders email list.  Our kid members are all under<br/>
age 10, so I signed us up for the the Young Children<br/>
program.  I receive quarterly mailings from them with<br/>
curriculum-based activities for young kids.  We rarely<br/>
use them but them help us brainstorm new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Our club typically meets 1st, 3rd, and 5th Fridays<br/>
from 10 - noon.  It is really flexible, which is<br/>
perfect for us.  We do projects, field trips, and<br/>
community service.  We made solar ovens out of pizza<br/>
boxes and then used them to cook our lunch (pulling<br/>
them in wagons) during the Earth Day parade last<br/>
April.  Our caving trip yesterday was incredible. <br/>
Well, according to the reports of the 8 kids & 8<br/>
adults who wriggled on their bellies through the cave!<br/>
 (I stayed outside with my younger daughter.) In<br/>
December we are doing an animal enrichment project and<br/>
then delivering the animal &quot;toys&quot; to animals at the AZ<br/>
Sonoran Desert Museum.<br/>
<br/>
We could have started our own club, done the same<br/>
things we&#39;ve done with R&S, i.e. without the &quot;R&S&quot;<br/>
name, but I like being a part of something &quot;bigger&quot;,<br/>
as corny as that may sound.   <br/>
<br/>
Last year we signed up for Partnerships in<br/>
Understanding, where you can get matched up with<br/>
another R&S club for pen-pal purposes.  Our partner<br/>
group was in China, and we had fun putting a package<br/>
together for them.<br/>
<br/>
The Roots & Shoots organization is putting together<br/>
more info on their website to help homeschool clubs<br/>
get started.  It isn&#39;t up yet, but they are working on<br/>
it.  I don&#39;t remember where you are located, but if<br/>
you have any questions that I can&#39;t answer, contact<br/>
Laurel Turman.  She is very nice.<br/>
Here is her contact info:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69427970">I wrote to Laurel at Roots & Shoots/Jane Goodall<br/>
Institute.  Here is her reply -<br/>
<br/>
I am always happy to be in contact with new<br/>
homeschoolers who are interested in Roots & Shoots.  I<br/>
would love to give her as much information and support<br/>
as I can!  You can also give me her phone number and<br/>
email address as well and I will contact <br/>
her myself.  Let me know which is best.  <br/>
   The new Roots & Shoots web page probably won&#39;t go<br/>
up untill Jan.  This will be a much more extensive<br/>
description of the program as well as a variety of<br/>
resources, personal stories, youth submissions,<br/>
benefits of the program, project ideas, etc.  We are<br/>
fully aware that the website does not adequately<br/>
explain the benefits of becoming a member or the <br/>
specific costs of the program.  The coordinators<br/>
manual is not advertised on the website- and I think<br/>
it is a great resource for leaders.  In addition,<br/>
people should know that the membership fee simply<br/>
covers mailing costs throughout the year (newsletters,<br/>
back-to-school mailings, summit <br/>
applications, etc).  All these things will be better<br/>
explained and developed in the future.<br/>
    I completely understand that homeschoolers often<br/>
need a different kind of support from our staff when<br/>
it comes to networking, recruiting, and developing a<br/>
name in your area.  Feel free to have anyone who is <br/>
interested contact our office.  I am here to help!    <br/>

Unfortunately, there is no one else in my area, or<br/>
within a couple of hours, with a roots and shoots<br/>
group, but I know of more than one family interested<br/>
in the possibility.  The &quot;certain other&quot; organization<br/>
around here, which is pretty much everywhere, besides<br/>
having a lot of conflicting values and goals to our<br/>
family&#39;s, is also in hot water locally for making it a<br/>
habit to sell off, for clearcut logging profits, a<br/>
number of tracts of land deeded to them for purposes<br/>
of environmental protection and use by the children. <br/>
Very ugly business.  :-(<br/>

taking the time to share this information with me.  I<br/>
really appreciate it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was one of my problems with Camp Fire.  They also<br/>
have a reward system based on fulfilling some preset<br/>
goals on timelines which I was uncomfortable with,<br/>
some ageism, have a religious tenet and are pro<br/>
school.  That&#39;s not to say that you could not start a<br/>
group and tweak it to work for you.  But we were just<br/>
not comfortable with the politics and structure for<br/>
our family.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m not really a joiner myself, I do believe in<br/>
the power and importance of human beings working<br/>
together, the vital need for more community in the<br/>
world.  My kids are also interested in being a part of<br/>
something, making that common connection with others,<br/>
and having a venue to stage events and activites from,<br/>
as well as a place to make new friends.  The<br/>
legitimacy of being part of an international group<br/>
will encourage others to join our efforts.  Plus Roots<br/>
and Shoots just sounds like a lot of fun and very in<br/>
line with our beliefs.<br/>
