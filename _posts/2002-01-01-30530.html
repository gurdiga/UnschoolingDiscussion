STANDARDISTAS<br/>

<br/>
&quot;They want to get rid of cilia!&quot; exclaimed Aliyah, a frown deepening <br/>
across her 13-year-old face as she speed-read the article.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Cilia, too,&quot; I repeated, putting down the sports section.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, cilia are the whole reason for paramecium. How is anyone going <br/>
to talk with a scientist? What are we going to say -- &#39;little wavy <br/>
things?&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How about flagella?&quot; I suggested, then remembering -- stupid me -- <br/>
that those are found among a different class of critters entirely.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, they are getting rid of flagella, too!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ali was reading a May 2001 article on a new, highly publicized guide <br/>
Designs for Science Literacy, published and promoted by the American <br/>
Association for the Advancement of Science. The recommendations, <br/>
being sent to every school board, school administrator, and school <br/>
superintendent in the United States, are designed, according to <br/>
Andrew Ahlgren, project associate director, &quot;to assist education <br/>
leaders, teachers, publishers, and developers in assembling <br/>
instructional materials for kindergarten through twelfth grade that <br/>
are coherent and relevant.&quot; The goal, says Ahlgren, is to change the <br/>
curriculum so that even basic science education &quot;is challenging and <br/>
meets global standards.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No right-angle trigonometry?&quot; She was now really steamed. &quot;How will <br/>
we build anything? And, look, they removed the periodic table, and <br/>
acids and bases. How is anyone going to understand acid rain? And no <br/>
more oxidation, respiration, aerobic or anaerobic...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, I guess we&#39;ll simply have to talk about breathing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And they are getting rid of mitochondria. How can you study <br/>
evolution without mitochondria?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hey, Ali, this is not my idea,&quot; I reminded my daughter, intending to <br/>
cool down the conversation. &quot;Why don&#39;t you write them a letter?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How is anyone going to talk with a scientist?&quot; was the question that <br/>
stuck in my craw. I might have added, &quot;How could one understand fully <br/>
the public controversy about the teaching of evolution, or how could <br/>
one act as a responsible citizen to curb air pollution?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
ASK CAROL<br/>
<br/>
I wear two hats for HEM-one is the editor hat for this newsletter; <br/>
the other is a columnist hat for Home Education Magazine, the <br/>
original print version that&#39;s been supporting homeschoolers for over <br/>
20 years.<br/>
<br/>
Every other month, I ask people to send me questions and I promise to <br/>
answer as many as I can in future columns. Although I don&#39;t answer <br/>
them in this newsletter, where the space is just too tiny for my BIG <br/>
advice, I do answer them in every issue of Home Education Magazine, <br/>
and for your convenience, I&#39;ve put subscription information at the <br/>
end of the newsletter. A couple of them are online <br/>
(http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/issue_index.html), but most of <br/>
them you have to read in the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I really like to get your questions-any questions at all, even if you <br/>
think your question is stupid and you&#39;re the only one who has your <br/>
particular problem (it&#39;s probably not true). If you don&#39;t have a <br/>
question, send me something funny in the form of a question. Somebody <br/>
once asked me if she could homeschool if she has a tattoo and rides a <br/>
Harley. Her answer got more than half the column.<br/>
<br/>
So, help me out with that other hat, and send me your questions. I <br/>
even have a special email address: askcarol@... . Of <br/>
course, I don&#39;t promise I can answer every question (especially if <br/>
you don&#39;t send one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use <br/>
it for a column or not. What are you waiting for?<br/>

<br/>
UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
I think ideas are easier to wrangle with if we can nail them down, <br/>
get at the essence of them, put them into a box. Trying to get at the <br/>
essence of unschooling is like trying to get at the essence of life.<br/>
<br/>
For us, unschooling *is* life. Our lives are a balance of needs and <br/>
desires, hopes and fears, love and tears, peace and upheaval - you <br/>
name it, and it&#39;s there. Learning is a part of all of it, not <br/>
separate from it.<br/>
<br/>
When I require something of my children, it is usually because there <br/>
is an immediate and very real *need* for it - to keep them healthy <br/>
and safe, to keep the family functioning, to respect someone else&#39;s <br/>
needs or feelings, etc. Certainly there are things I think would be <br/>
useful, even essential for them to know in order to function <br/>
independently as adults. These things are so obviously practical and <br/>
useful in our everyday lives that I can&#39;t fathom them not seeing a <br/>
need to learn them at some point.<br/>
<br/>
There are many, many more things that I hope they will explore, and <br/>
these I will certainly open doors to for them. But I believe that by <br/>
far the most valuable things for them to know are what they <br/>
themselves find interesting and useful. I trust them to choose and <br/>
pursue what they will, and I trust that they will become competent, <br/>
capable and knowledgeable adults in the process.<br/>
<br/>
I respect their needs, feelings and desires. I believe that young <br/>
children&#39;s needs include being shielded from the responsibility of <br/>
making decisions they do not yet have the knowledge and experience to <br/>
make - things for which they should not have to bear the consequences <br/>
- and this is my job as a parent. It is a tricky to job to balance <br/>
our children&#39;s needs with their desires, especially when they can&#39;t <br/>
yet see that they are sometimes different, or when they are <br/>
diametrically opposed. I don&#39;t see it as coercion or conditional <br/>
freedom, but rather as a real-life lesson in making decisions, <br/>
guidance, parenting. From the time that they are able to understand <br/>
the choices, they are part of the process.<br/>
<br/>
Freedom and responsibility go hand in hand. What responsibility I <br/>
take for my children limits their own, and thus limits their freedom. <br/>
They are *dependent* upon me. As an example, before they can cook, I <br/>
prepare their food, and they eat from what I prepare. Their choices <br/>
are limited to what I supply, *though I always do my best to meet <br/>
both their needs and likes*. I in turn am limited by the household <br/>
budget, and bound by my responsibility to look after their health. <br/>
When I do choose contrary to what they *desire*, I explain my choice, <br/>
and I respect their feelings about it, no matter how unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
As children are ready for more responsibility, they gain more <br/>
freedom. They are maturing, growing up, learning to make good <br/>
decisions. This is life. It is a process, a work in progress. <br/>

<br/>
NASA STUDENT PROGRAM TAKES OFF!<br/>
<br/>
Something for everybody seems to be the theme for the 2001-2002 NASA <br/>
Student Involvement Program (NSIP). This year&#39;s expanded national <br/>
student competition was announced today with the release of materials <br/>
describing six competitions for students from kindergarten through <br/>
grade twelve.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This year, we really are trying to engage students of all ages, <br/>
backgrounds, and interests,&quot; says Lynn Marra, the NSIP Program <br/>
Manager. &quot;NSIP offers a variety of ways that students--entire <br/>
classrooms, teams or individuals--can be part of the NASA team and <br/>
conduct hands-on research using some of today&#39;s most exciting <br/>
technology.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Competitions include:<br/>
<br/>
My Planet, Earth (Grades K-4)--Like NASA scientists, students explore <br/>
their ever-changing neighborhoods.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Earth Change (Grades 5-8)--Students play the role of <br/>
scientist and apply space technology to better understand the dynamic <br/>
planet Earth.<br/>
<br/>
Science and Technology Journalism (Grades K-12)--Students apply their <br/>
communication skills to deliver NASA news and information.<br/>
<br/>
Design a Mission to Mars (Grades 5-12)--Students consider how they <br/>
might explore the red planet.<br/>
<br/>
Aerospace Technology Engineering Challenge (Grades 5-8)--Students are <br/>
introduced to challenges of aerospace technology by building an <br/>
aerospace structure.<br/>
<br/>
Space Flight Opportunities (Grades 9-12)--High School students are <br/>
provided with the unique opportunity to design and fly space <br/>
experiments.<br/>
<br/>
Marra stresses that NSIP is more than a competition, providing an <br/>
inquiry-based approach to science, mathematics, technology, and <br/>
geography education. &quot;We recognize that teachers are a critical link <br/>
in this program...We have worked closely with them to make sure that <br/>
NSIP enriches existing curriculum.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Resource guides are available for educators at no cost. All NSIP <br/>
participants receive NASA certificates. Exceptional awards include <br/>
Space Camp scholarships, the opportunity to fly experiments on the <br/>
Space Shuttle or NASA sounding rockets, school presentations, <br/>
participation at the national student symposium or student flight <br/>
weeks, and an independently funded scholarship.<br/>
<br/>
