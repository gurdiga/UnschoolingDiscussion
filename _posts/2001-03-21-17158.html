wants/needs now that as he gets older he&#39;ll become more and more

 </span></blockquote>He is developing all kinds of skills with his interest in Thomas...  can he name all of Thomas and his friends on sight?  Observation and classification (I used to have neighbors whose 3yo could do this and he was amazed that my 5yo didn&#39;t know *any* of them... but then, my 5yo never watched Thomas).  Does he have a Thomas railroad?  Setting up tracks is good spatial reasoning and engineering.  These things will spill over into other things as his interests branch out from Thomas.  He may move into scale train models, or something entirely different.  You can pretend with him...  make up a train schedule.  How long will it take the train to get from here to there?  You can &quot;input&quot; all kinds of things just following his lead.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks everyone for setting my mind at ease about 
my &quot;dependent&quot; 4 year old.&nbsp; He is an only child and I really have no point 
of reference as to where he &quot;should&quot; be developmentally.&nbsp; People always 
think he&#39;s much older because he&#39;s so well spoken but I guess I needed to hear 
it from like-minded people.&nbsp; I guess I worry because he&#39;s having too much 
fun to be learning.LOL.&nbsp; He doesn&#39;t watch TV.&nbsp; We play&nbsp;with the 
Thomas trains.&nbsp; The idea about the train schedule was great!&nbsp; It has 
really opened up the creative floodgates for me.&nbsp; I just didn&#39;t know where 
to start.&nbsp; Thank you again everyone.&nbsp; If you have any more ideas I 
would love to hear them! - Collette</font></div>

<div><font face="Pooh" size="4">The only thing I can say is let him explore his 
world on his own. Just read to him as often as you can and eventually he will 
get ready to read on his own. Allow him to watch good programs like Barney, 
Thomas (which you already do), sesame street. Also get interactive games that he 
would enjoy such as chutes and ladders, sorry, etc. Go on nature walks which I 
think you already do...and just keep doing what you are doing. Sounds like he&#39;s 
doing fine. My youngest clung to me for quite some time now. She&#39;s done a 90 
degree turnaround right at the moment. She is 10. Shes becoming a bit too 
independent in my opinion...I&#39;m hoping that time will tell and that I&#39;ll get my 
sweet girl back soon.</font></div>

&gt; concerned he&#39;ll grow up knowing only about Thomas the Tank Engine.LOL  So<br/>
&gt; any suggestions on how to either get him to explore somewhat independently<br/>
&gt; or how I might get him to be open to my input would be appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I&#39;m sure your son is doing fine. My son went through almost 2.5 years of<br/>
trains, trains, TRAINS! Including a 4 month period when he would only wear<br/>
striped overalls, an engineer hat, and a red bandana, and would only allow<br/>
himself to be referred to as &quot;Casey Jones&quot;. He referred to me only as &quot;Sim<br/>
Webb&quot; (Casey Jones&#39; fireman). Casey was an engineer on a steam train who was<br/>
killed in a crash and memorialized in song here in the U.S. for those who<br/>
are wondering. What we did was just to embrace his passion, and show him<br/>
ways he could follow up on it. When he would ask me a train question I<br/>
couldn&#39;t answer, I&#39;d say &quot;Well, let&#39;s go look it up in the library&quot; or<br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s do a search on the internet&quot;. We checked out all sorts of train books<br/>
and videos, he would pour over the pictures. We got Thomas tracks and spent<br/>
hours building layouts and playing trains. We bought or checked out albums<br/>
of train songs (John Denver has a great one, incidentally, terrific train<br/>
music for kids and adults). We listened to Casey Jones and then looked up<br/>
more about Casey&#39;s real life. We found a biography on Casey Jones and read<br/>
about the real historical person he was. We went to train museums, model<br/>
railroad shows, and on train rides. We rode steam trains, diesel trains,<br/>
trolleys, light rail, Amtrak, monorails, subways, and elevated trains.<br/>
Everywhere we went, we found something to do with trains. We found gentlemen<br/>
of my father&#39;s age and older at all of these events who were train fanatics,<br/>
very knowledgeable &quot;grandpa&quot; types who were more than happy to sit down and<br/>
talk trains with a young person with a great interest in them. We discovered<br/>
people who had been engineers on steam trains themselves, or who just rode<br/>
them as young boys. We went to a roundhouse in Portland, OR where they<br/>
restore and run gigantic steam locomotives (a Northern and a Daylight, both<br/>
about 100 feet long). We created railroad signs at home and talked about<br/>
rail safety (crossings, etc.). We built trains out of boxes in our living<br/>
room. Ultimately, our journey with trains culminated with a summer vacation<br/>
to &quot;RailFair 99&quot;, the largest gathering of trains in the world, in<br/>
Sacramento, CA. We camped our way down the coast and spent several days at<br/>
RailFair, looking at gigantic steam trains, sleek electric trains, and even,<br/>
yes, Thomas!!<br/>

fan) at:<br/>

<br/>
Your son might also like this page, I&#39;ve got links to some of the trains<br/>
we&#39;ve been on, and lots of train pictures.<br/>
<br/>
All of this is just to say that you can take any interest and run with it,<br/>
allow your child to pursue their passions, and they will learn many<br/>
different things along the way, eventually (IMHO) picking up everything they<br/>
need to know. For instance, from our years of train passion, Mackenzie has<br/>
learned math - he learned to count and add by figuring out wheel arrangments<br/>
(which is how trains are classified), he learned about history and<br/>
biography, he learned engineering and building (track layouts), and how to<br/>
write (making train signs), and perhaps most vitally, he learned how to find<br/>
more information about anything he enjoys, learned how to talk to many<br/>
different types and ages of people, learned how to use the library and other<br/>
resources.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, he has now moved on from trains. Now he&#39;s into space and rockets<br/>
(we just went to the Kennedy Space Center on vacation last month). The boxes<br/>
in our living rooms are rocket ships, he pretends to be John Glen. He<br/>
launches toilet paper tubes into the air. &lt;Sniff&gt;, I kind of miss the<br/>
trains, to tell you the truth. But I&#39;m excited to help him follow whatever<br/>
he is interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, your son will have many passions in his life. He is so lucky to<br/>
have you there to allow him to follow them, instead of them being relegated<br/>
to daydreaming about them during the long hours of the &quot;school day&quot;. Run<br/>
with it!<br/>

I think we are raising the same son!  We will be venturing to Space Camp <br/>
next year sometime (dad and son weekend, my husband really wants to go <br/>
anyway).  My son also has a website about our train adventures and we were <br/>
planning on adding rockets from our trip to Kennedy last summer.<br/>
<br/>
Mac&#39;s site is www.geocities.com&#92;boxcarmac<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t funny how that happens...<br/>
