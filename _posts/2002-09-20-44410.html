What else does she recommend?  We&#39;ve read Fog Magic,  eventually I&#39;ll get around to Little Women and Secret Garden.  What else would she list for 8-9 year olds that is low on violence...she isn&#39;t into scary stuff.<br/>

Remember that Twillight Zone with the guy with the glasses... That would be me!  Except I sure as heck would find a way to repair them...<br/>

Be well,<br/>

any other fans out there?  I am really so enjoying reading this book to<br/>
my daugther...I have<br/>
decided to buy the whole shebang...any and all the books I can of his,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m also very fond of Edward Eager.  Half Magic was one of the first<br/>
&quot;chapter books&quot; that my son was happy to listen to, after a long period<br/>
of disinterest. (He loves the humor and the humorous mishaps.) Yet,<br/>
somehow we haven&#39;t finished the last chapter in Knights Castle.<br/>
<br/>
We went from Edward Eager to J. K. Rowling and then back to Edward<br/>
Eager.  Now we are reading Susan Cooper&#39;s second Boggart book, The<br/>
Boggart and the Monster.<br/>

My son is a little younger, but also not into scary.  He&#39;s liked:<br/>
<br/>
Heidi <br/>
The Little Princess (same author as Secret Garden)<br/>
The Boxcar Children (book 1 is really the best one)<br/>
Mr. Popper&#39;s Penguins (Richard and Florence Atwater)<br/>
My Father&#39;s Dragon, Elmer and the Dragon, and The Dragons of Blueland<br/>
(Ruth Stiles Gannett, reissued recently all in 1 book as &quot;Three Tales of My<br/>
Father&#39;s Dragon&quot;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, she was the Kids Book Supervisor at the Books-A-Million store <br/>
here and is now working at Walden Books. It&#39;s her dream to have her <br/>
own store though, and we&#39;re working on it. <br/>
<br/>
She was obsessed with The Babysitter&#39;s Club, anything by Lynne Reid <br/>
Banks, Roald Dahl, Laura Ingalls Wilder, When The Dolls Woke -can&#39;t <br/>
remember author, and any book about Catherine the Great. Laurie just <br/>
walked into the room and I asked her what other books she liked at <br/>
that age, and she reminded me that she would go into the library or <br/>
bookstore and just pick out what looked good, NEVER confining herself <br/>
to the children&#39;s books. She&#39;d read Time magazine from cover-to-cover <br/>
at age 8. <br/>
