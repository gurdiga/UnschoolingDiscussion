&lt;&lt; As one who owned an 4-bys long before they became &quot;in&quot; and known as SUVs, I<br/>
 think anyone who buys one should be required to take a behind-the-wheel<br/>
 driving test in the SUV before they are allowed to buy one! &gt;&gt;<br/>

Well, I don&#39;t use my SUV to haul anything but kids. And no, I don&#39;t use it as <br/>
SUVs were originally intended to be used, but it&#39;s a legal product and I paid <br/>
for it, so I&#39;m okay with that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I *do* like the way it looks, but I would much rather be riding around <br/>
in a sporty little two-seater, with the top down.<br/>
