&lt;&lt; Okay, now I&#39;m wondering about the whole sex talk and what to say and when <br/>
to <br/>
say it. Never really thought about it before but now I am.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve realized is that you have to &quot;have the talk&quot; over and over. <br/>
For us, the first time came for Zoe when she outright asked (around 7 or 8) <br/>
and for Quinn when he was using the word sex in conversation so often, I <br/>
asked him if he knew what it meant (at 6, I know, I know, but if you know <br/>
Quinn this makes total sense). We talk as it comes up again and at each age <br/>
they understand the issue differently.<br/>
