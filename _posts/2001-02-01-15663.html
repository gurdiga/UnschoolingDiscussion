<div id="ygrps-yiv-206232516">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about FMS.<br/>
<br/>
And I am reading a fascinating book called &quot;Your Body&#39;s Many Cries For<br/>
Water&quot;, available through www.amazon.com.  There is a whole chapter on<br/>
allergies and basically the whole book is about people showing all kinds of<br/>
symptoms due to chronic dehydration at the cellular level. Considering that<br/>
our bodies consist of mostly water, I think he is onto something and I have<br/>
been increasing my own water intake gradually. Now I am more thirsty than<br/>
ever, because for the first time in years I recognize my body&#39;s thirst<br/>
signals, whereas before I was shut down to even knowing when I was thirsty<br/>
or I would just plain ignore the  signals.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else here familiar with the book?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Some people seem to have a sports bottle all the time, and they drink water <br/>
as an oral thing-to-do (but then they&#39;re not smoking, or eating, or drinking <br/>
alcohol with that nervous energy or oral-fix need).<br/>
<br/>
Does too much water hurt people any?<br/>
<br/>
(and, Tracy, if you were being tongue in cheek about this then ignore me <br/>
totally...)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that women, especially, tend not to drink enough water because <br/>
they&#39;re busy taking care of other people, and that they also don&#39;t urinate <br/>
often enough, because theyr&#39;e taking care of other people, and so mothers <br/>
(the more motherly) tend toward urinary tract infections and bladder and <br/>
kidney problems just because they allow that system to sludge up.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had any water for days.  Tea, yes, but not plain water.  Some <br/>
orange juice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418375367">Yes, this is a problem, and no this isn&#39;t tongue in <br/>
cheek.  I can&#39;t remember exactly what the main problems <br/>
are, but too much fluid in the body can affect so much, <br/>
mostly heart and lungs, I think...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go search the websites of the newspapers I might <br/>
have read this in...<br/>
