<div id="ygrps-yiv-298091474">OK guys,  I&#39;m getting paniky here.  I kept the books like Family Math, I<br/>
Hate Mathematics, and Mathematics for Smarty Pants and others laying around<br/>
here for about a month and dd never even picked one up!  So I feel like I<br/>
must push a little. (emphasize a little here)<br/>
<br/>
We made fraction wheels out of pizza cardboard rounds and had great fun<br/>
making them but there they lay.  So the other day I took out the math books<br/>
again and started in the chapters on fractions - trying to make this<br/>
interesting and meaningful.  I&#39;ve scaled it back to no more than 15<br/>
problems in a day but still sense her boredom, frustration and general<br/>
dislike of the topic.<br/>
<br/>
Help!  How can I ignore this???  Math is in every possible thing we do. She<br/>
can&#39;t just right it off for the rest of her life.  In ways she wants me to<br/>
tell her what to do (still thinking I should do what the school did)  and<br/>
yet, she resents it when I push even a little.  Ack!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A month is not a very long time, given the length of our lives.....The key<br/>
phrase in the above paragraph is not that she&#39; didn&#39;t pick up the books, but<br/>
that you are panicking.  Stop there. Instead of discenting the need for<br/>
math, dissect the panic.  Where does it come from.  Who made you so afraid<br/>
of *math needing to be learned*.  What are you afraid of? That she will<br/>
NEVER do math, just because she didn&#39;t do it in the last month? Did you<br/>
study economics last month?  What if the y2kers are right and we&#39;re going to<br/>
slide in a deep, deep, depression in the next few years? Will you understand<br/>
the market forces at work?   In essence I&#39;m asking *why do we panic*?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We made fraction wheels out of pizza cardboard rounds and had great fun<br/>
&gt; making them but there they lay.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s GREAT.  You had fun and she was working with you! No telling what she<br/>
absorbed from the time with you and working with fractions.  Did you two<br/>
talk about fractions?  Hey you should have ordered the pizza and eaten it AS<br/>
fractions. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So the other day I took out the math books<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; again and started in the chapters on fractions - trying to make this<br/>
&gt; interesting and meaningful.  I&#39;ve scaled it back to no more than 15<br/>
&gt; problems in a day but still sense her boredom, frustration and general<br/>
&gt; dislike of the topic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did she ask you to do this?  Is she whining that she doesn&#39;t know fractions?<br/>
I have one that whined about fractions.  At 12 we were under a lot of stress<br/>
with a court case. Dang thing last 18 months and we were a bunch of crispy<br/>
critters by the time it was over.  We didn&#39;t even attempt doing anything<br/>
academic during that time.  Well, at 14 my daughter was standing in my<br/>
kitchen whining... you should have made me learn fractions. -------((( My<br/>
head is spinning, I&#39;m thinking when you frist approached fractions we were<br/>
living a nightmare, with 3 babies under 4 to go with it.....I would have<br/>
sent you around the bend if I had *made* you learn fractions--so now what to<br/>
say))))<br/>
<br/>
Then she said... &quot;don&#39;t you know there are some things you just have to do,<br/>
even if you don&#39;t like it.&quot;.. Hoo Boy, this was worth waiting for.  Yes, she<br/>
didn&#39;t know fractions when other kids did... she was 14 and way<br/>
*behind* ---But you know what, that lesson that there are some things you<br/>
just have to do because you just have to, that lesson will carry her much,<br/>
much farther than knowing fractions 2 years eariler.  So, I looked up at<br/>
her, and said, &quot;you know Sara, I was teaching... I was helping you learn<br/>
something.  Do you realize how many people come out of forced schooling and<br/>
never really know you have to do something because you just have to *for<br/>
yourself*. They&#39;ve spent years doing things because they had no choice and<br/>
when they do have  choice they stop learning.  Now, you know deep inside<br/>
that it&#39;s worth it to work hard at something you don&#39;t really like, PLUS in<br/>
6 weeks worth of effort you&#39;ll know fractions too.<br/>
<br/>
She struggled to say something.  I recieved one of those looks parents of<br/>
teens are used to when they figur out you&#39;re right, but hate to admit it.<br/>
She walked off and I ordered Keys to Fractions.  She worked through them and<br/>
to this day, hates fractions.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Help!  How can I ignore this???  Math is in every possible thing we do.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; can&#39;t just right it off for the rest of her life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Look at the juxtaposition of your words. If it&#39;s truly in every possible<br/>
thing we do, how in the world could she just right it off??? How?  How would<br/>
she function, managing her checkbook, her auto insurance, cutting a pizza up<br/>
for her children??<br/>
<br/>
 In ways she wants me to tell her what to do (still thinking I should do<br/>
what the school did)  and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; yet, she resents it when I push even a little.  Ack!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you know this?  It sort of looks like you think she ought to be doing<br/>
*school math*. That she ought to sit down with fractional parts of a piece<br/>
of cardboard instead of the frational parts of the PIZZA? The real fractions<br/>
are in dividing a pizza, not the cardboard.<br/>
<br/>
She wants your help learning to function in the world, which will include<br/>
using fractions.  Build things, make a bird house.   Cook, hide the one cup<br/>
and one teaspon and use the others.  Or agree only to use the 1/4 teaspoon<br/>
in the things you make.. or double a recipe.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can choose not to panic and wait until she needs to use this skill,<br/>
which will be learned much, much easier when there is a true need.  Even if<br/>
it&#39;s much later than school says it should be learned.<br/>

My son LOVES math!!!  And he can go a month without seeming to think about it <br/>
at all.  It will happen.  It will come up -- as you pointed out, math is all <br/>
around us.  Then maybe she will have a real reason that is hers to learn math.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t know the books you mentioned -- the I Hate Math genre.  But <br/>
there really are a lot of fun math (not necessarily arithmetic) activities in <br/>
the world.  Logic puzzles and games and mazes are a big hit in our house and <br/>
they sort of get the math juices flowing even if you are not actually <br/>
learning division or fractions or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  And remember -- Math is Fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463311055">Does your dd happen to be 9 1/2?  I have one just like her!  I have gone <br/>
around about this too.  She does pick up on things very quickly, and is <br/>
pretty good at it, even though she doesn&#39;t like it.  I think basically she <br/>
doesn&#39;t see a need for it at this time.  I do however! I can&#39;t even interest <br/>
her much in things like measuring for baking, real life skills.<br/>
<br/>
We are borrowing a Saxon math book right now.  Not sure how either of us <br/>
like it.  Or how long it will last.<br/>

time.  My 13 year old son regularly goes a month with no &quot;formal&quot; <br/>
math pursuits.  Then he spends hours with a geometry or algebra book.<br/>
I used to panic too, still do sometimes as we approach those high <br/>
school years,  but my son has let me know that my panicking only <br/>
delays his unschooling.  It might help to know that even if your <br/>
daughter didn&#39;t tackle any math for years,  she could learn <br/>
everything she needed to know for college entrance exams, etc.  in a <br/>
few months.<br/>

&gt;Laraine<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I worry about the math too. I have let go (and become more unschooling ) in<br/>
every other subject but I worry about math. I consider it a foundation<br/>
subject. The information must be understood, put into practice and built<br/>
upon. Anyway...that is the way that I feel.   <br/>
My background is bio-chem. and I know that I would not have gone as far as<br/>
I have without that math foundation. <br/>
<br/>
I just want to give my girls all the tools to be able to choose a career<br/>
path whether it be in the sciences or arts. <br/>
<br/>
So, I change books every year for math and I let the girls pick now. So far<br/>
all the other books..like Family Math (I have friends whose kids love it)<br/>
and I HAte Math just have not been interesting for the girls . Maybe my<br/>
comfort level is with the sequence of a math text...so it may be my issue. <br/>
 The eldest, Ave is 10 1/2too, and she is using the Math Curriculum Press<br/>
book.( She is a workbook-kid...she ususally  loves doing them.)  There are<br/>
a lot of problems and busy-work. But we also  like the artwork..just right.<br/>
And we like the little bits of info. that come in the teachers manual. <br/>
 We only do the first problem and then a couple more to check her<br/>
understanding. If she &#39;gets it&#39; then we skip the exta page of busy-work.<br/>
This is empowering for her. She is a perfectionist and has a hard time not<br/>
knowing EVERYTHING right now. So, math can really get her down.<br/>
Her younger sister, 8 1/2 years, (a more spatial learner) zips through math<br/>
and has no emotional issues with it. (hmmmm? I wonder if it is a<br/>
first-born/second-born thing???)She works in the Scholars Choice book...a<br/>
Canadian product.  She has almost caught up with her sister. This is a<br/>
touchy issue. however, the other day Ave (eldest) said...&quot;well, I will get<br/>
through this at my own pace.&quot;    breakthrough!!!<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s keep chatting about this.<br/>
I have been struggling with it for some time. And I have been honest with<br/>
the girls that I feel it is important to have a strong math foundation. I<br/>
think honesty is important...we all have to work together.  So, older dd<br/>
grumbles but at least she can make jokes about it now!  And they do mental<br/>
math all the time...especially when they are figuring out their &#39;pay&#39; at<br/>
the end of the month for their newpaper route. (the motivation of<br/>
income...eh??)<br/>
<br/>
Right now this works for us. And the thing is..it has to work for all of<br/>
us...the parent/facilitator too :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh.  Didn&#39;t know what the books you have were about.  And I have no other <br/>
&quot;brilliant&quot; suggestions.  Other than to try to be patient.  There is a long <br/>
time between 10 1/2 and math-illiterate 18.  I hate that too.  I know some <br/>
people just can&#39;t get math but some of the many I have run into had to have <br/>
been ABLE but were never taught effectively or never learned because they got <br/>
so turned off to math or something.   <br/>
<br/>
But this reminds me of my very bright daughter who will not read.  She is <br/>
almost 5, knows her letters, you can &quot;catch&quot; her reading a few beginning <br/>
words, but if you ask her to read or if she can read, she will refuse to and <br/>
deny that she can.  She will admit to knowing the letters and sounds but will <br/>
not read.  I, of course, have the peace of mind that she is only almost 5.  <br/>
But it is frustrating when I know she has all the elements of reading and yet <br/>
will not accept that what she is doing is reading.   Maybe because she can&#39;t <br/>
do it as perfectly as big brother.  Maybe because it is not her thing -- she <br/>
is very artistic and verbal (will talk your head off if you let her) but  . . <br/>
.  Anyway, it seems to be more my problem than hers at this point.  I hope <br/>
that&#39;s how it works out for you too.  That you can somehow get thru a few <br/>
months (please not years - for your sake) of seeing little progress, and then <br/>
it will click with her when she&#39;s ready.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom and I were just discussing something like this yesterday.  How parents <br/>
we have both spoken with have &quot;plans&quot; for their kids.  They plan that they <br/>
will educate and mold and lead and the kids will turn out certain way.  It <br/>
turns out that that&#39;s not how life works.  At least as far as my mom and I <br/>
have been able to observe.  And one of the hardest parts is watching and <br/>
waiting to see what will take or work or stick and what (no matter how much <br/>
you wish it would) does not stick.<br/>
<br/>
Well, good luck in figuring all of these things out.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

My two boys are EXACTLY like this!  The oldest gets so upset, if he can&#39;t do <br/>
the problem, he gets mad at me!  The more I hear and read, the more I am <br/>
convinced that there is a great deal in this &quot;first child, second child &quot; <br/>
thing.  I always thought so, but it is really spooky how it is constantly <br/>
reinforced!  I love the Saxon math because it is layer on layer, repetition, <br/>
repetition, repetition, but , that&#39;s what seems to keep them from forgetting <br/>
what they have learned, because they continually use it.  However, this year <br/>
we are not using it, trying to use more real life math stuff,  I don&#39;t know <br/>
how this will work out.<br/>

resistant, they probably will see that it is math and may not try it.  but if <br/>
they are just interested in something new and fun, they might like it.  and <br/>
it would give you something to feel like they are doing!  anyway, no <br/>
promotion here, just thought i&#39;d share.  the 800# is right here on my invoice <br/>
if you are interested.  and ask for the deal where they send you a free one <br/>
to try (it is packaged with another that you would pay for or send back...)  <br/>
they are 3.98 ea. plus 2.45 s/h and they will keep on sending them every <br/>

Highlights is a good mag so I am game. How much is it for a year? I have to<br/>
do an exchange to Canadian (ouch!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202439765">My almost eight yr old, very bright dd is just barely beginning to read.<br/>
She was doing what your dd was at almost 5.  Anyway,  I am learning to be<br/>
patient and relax....because of the discussion I get from this list.<br/>
(So even though I don&#39;t get much time to respond as I like.....I&#39;m saying<br/>
Thanks everyone!! for the discussion a few weeks back - 1st of Nov - about<br/>
beginning reading)<br/>
    I find I have to work on myself,  my perspective,  and my<br/>
expectations....many of which come from having been in school SO many<br/>
years...pre-school to post graduate!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Thanks for the info Erin. Are these workbooks that you write in or what???<br/>
 Magazine style??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The MathMania mags are much more interesting than any workbook I have seen.  <br/>
We sometimes do 1 and sometimes do 20 pages.  Each page or 2 is a different <br/>
type of puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights also publishes something fun called PuzzleMania -- similar but <br/>
more mazes and non-math stuff -- word searches and secret codes, etc.  It&#39;s <br/>
better than I am describing it.<br/>
