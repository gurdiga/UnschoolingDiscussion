I see your dh is a truck driver.  My dh was driving trucks here in NZ <br/>
for 6-7 yrs.  He was only ever away 3 nights at the most - 2 weeks <br/>
seems a long time! But I do agree with you that it is nice for the <br/>
children to go away with dad for a few days. Because there is only <br/>
the 3 of us home now, we would all go occasionally - and I loved it.  <br/>
My dh is a courier driver now - and my dd goes to work with him 2-3 <br/>
times a week.  he has taught her the job and he tells me if she could <br/>
drive, she could now do the job herself!!! dd is almost 13yrs old.<br/>
2 friends of my dh have just left for America to drive trucks - there <br/>
wee 10 altogether who went. Appears they go for 9 month stints <br/>
driving all over America.  My dh did give it some thought - he has <br/>
always wanted to go over there and driving those big rigs would be a <br/>
dream - the only thing that put him of was having to leave us behind <br/>
for 9 months.......<br/>
