<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021543531">For those of us on digests, could everyone check whether they are including<br/>
the whole previous post with their replies? Sometimes it means you are<br/>
including many posts and their footers too - carpal tunnel is creeping<br/>
faster and faster towards me! Short quotes are better.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
