&lt;&lt; Ooh, I love medieval stuff! Sandra, please tell me<br/>
more. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loved medieval stuff since watching Robin Hood on TV in the 50&#39;s and <br/>
looking at the pictures in books about castles when I was little.  <br/>
<br/>
I was involved in the SCA for 24 years, but the reason I joined was that I <br/>
already knew lots of period music on recorder and had probably 30 traditional <br/>
English ballads in my repertoire, and it was a place I could do that music in <br/>
a context where it would make sense and be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
In the SCA I taught lots of people music--live dance music, and medieval and <br/>
Renaissance Christmas stuff (REAL carols, intended for religious processions, <br/>
not the hymns we call &quot;carols&quot; now, and other stuff).  Various of them taught <br/>
me calligraphy, lots more sewing tricks (I could already sew without <br/>
patterns, so that was another head start for me), cooking to be and to seem <br/>
period, and I picked up tons of trivia over the years which used to be <br/>
obscure and now is readily available on the internet, which I don&#39;t mind a <br/>
bit!<br/>
<br/>
Problem is that although I joined for music, I had the ability to put out <br/>
newsletters, and to be an administrator, and so I slipped into the production <br/>
and management aspects and often was too busy and involved in the realities <br/>
to wallow in the fantasies.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s where I met my husband and most of my current friends.  Other friends <br/>
are from my hometown, from college, or from La Leche League, mostly.<br/>
<br/>
My house is full of the detritus and treasures from 24 years of <br/>
participation.  But I quit last Spring and I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s <br/>
permanent or temporary.<br/>

I&#39;ve visited loads of castles all over the UK and<br/>
Ireland. I love them! <br/>

What&#39;s the SCA? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Society for Creative Anachronism, founded in the 60&#39;s, a medieval/Renaissance <br/>
studies club.  <br/>
<br/>
Loosely speaking:  towns are shires (where members are), cities are baronies, <br/>
kings are chosen by single combat tournaments, there are 16 or 17 kingdoms (I <br/>
quit paying attention after 15; started playing when there were four; was CEO <br/>
when the 8th-11th were formed, and first queen of the 12th).<br/>
<br/>
If you want to read some of what I&#39;ve written, here are two things not too <br/>
particular (meaning you don&#39;t have to be a member to know what the heck I&#39;m <br/>
talking about).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why Normally Sane Adults Love the SCA So Much&quot; (an article to enlighten <br/>
newcomers and the curious, and to inspire oldtime SCA members) <br/>

<br/>
&quot;On What Maketh a Knight&quot; is an article written for Facets of Knighthood, but <br/>
is not just about knighthood.<br/>

That site has two pop-up ads this week and it&#39;s irritating; sorry.<br/>

Thanks Sandra!<br/>
I looked up the links you gave me and I&#39;m so<br/>
interested. I&#39;m going to email my local contact and go<br/>
to an event or meeting I can&#39;t wait! Tamzin has a<br/>
great medieval outfit but I need to get myself kitted<br/>
up now.<br/>
