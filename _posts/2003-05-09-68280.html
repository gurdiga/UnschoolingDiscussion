Parents, Shopping for Discipline, Turn to Tough Schools Abroad<br/>
<br/>
By TIM WEINER<br/>
<br/>
   ENSENADA, Mexico  Ryan Fraidenburgh was 14 when he was brought here<br/>
shackled, kicking and screaming.<br/>
<br/>
    Two men carrying handcuffs and leg irons came for him at his<br/>
mother&#39;s home in Sacramento, Calif., shoved him into a van and bound him<br/>
hand and foot. They drove<br/>
him 12 hours south, over the Mexican border, into a high-walled compound<br/>
near here called Casa by the Sea.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It was nighttime,&quot; Ryan recalled. &quot;I look around and I see kids<br/>
sleeping on cement. I was really, really scared. The big honcho,<br/>
Mauricio, said, `You don&#39;t speak English<br/>
here.&#39; I didn&#39;t know how to speak Spanish.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ryan quickly learned the rules: stay silent, be compliant, don&#39;t look<br/>
up, don&#39;t look out the window, don&#39;t speak unless spoken to. The<br/>
punishments for breaking the rules<br/>
included solitary confinement, lying on the floor in a small room, nose<br/>
to the ground, often for days on end.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan was not a criminal. He was only skipping school, his parents said<br/>
in telephone interviews. But in August 2000, they said, in the middle of<br/>
a bitter divorce and custody<br/>
battle, they decided to send him away to Casa by the Sea, which calls<br/>
itself a &quot;specialty boarding school&quot; for behavior modification.<br/>
<br/>
Like hundreds of other parents, the Fraidenburghs made their choice<br/>
largely on the basis of a glossy brochure and a call to a toll-free<br/>
number in Utah. They came to regret<br/>
their choice.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of sending a child to such a program in Mexico was unheard of a<br/>
decade ago. But in the United States, behavior-modification programs and<br/>
boarding schools for<br/>
troubled youths have faced increasing legal and licensing challenges<br/>
over the past few years.<br/>
<br/>
More and more are moving abroad  some to Mexico, Central America or the<br/>
Caribbean  where they operate largely under the regulation radar and<br/>
where some employ<br/>
minimum-wage custodians more than teachers or therapists, say government<br/>
officials, education consultants and clinical psychologists.<br/>
<br/>
The behavior-modification business is booming at Casa by the Sea, on<br/>
Mexico&#39;s Pacific Coast, the largest of 11 affiliated programs with<br/>
roughly 2,200 youths, about half of<br/>
them in Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica. The programs are run by a small<br/>
group of businessmen based in St. George, Utah, under the banner of the<br/>
World Wide<br/>
Association of Specialty Programs and Schools, or Wwasps, and Teen Help,<br/>
the programs&#39; main marketing arm.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past seven years, local governments and State Department<br/>
officials have investigated Wwasps-affiliated programs in Mexico, the<br/>
Czech Republic and Samoa on<br/>
charges of physical abuse and immigration violations. The Mexican<br/>
program, in Cancún, and the Czech program closed, and their owners left<br/>
those countries saying they<br/>
feared unjust charges. The Samoan program cut its affiliation with<br/>
Wwasps.<br/>
<br/>
Ken Kay, the president of Wwasps, would not allow a reporter to visit<br/>
Casa by the Sea; Dace Goulding, the program&#39;s director, declined to<br/>
answer any questions. But Mr.<br/>
Kay, responding to inquiries in writing from his office in Utah, said no<br/>
charge of abuse had ever been proven against any of the programs in any<br/>
court.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are about getting families back together,&quot; he said in a written<br/>
statement. &quot;We are not for everyone, and there are very few but<br/>
vociferous critics of not just us but any<br/>
youth intervention.&quot; He described many of the program&#39;s critics as<br/>
parents who feel they have been &quot;manipulated, brainwashed or duped&quot; or<br/>
who are battling through divorce<br/>
and taking their anger out &quot;by making us look terrible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In telephone interviews, eight teenagers who were formerly in Casa by<br/>
the Sea described a system in which the youths try to ascend six<br/>
&quot;levels&quot; through a system of<br/>
rewards and punishments, including being sent to &quot;R and R,&quot; a small,<br/>
bare isolation room, often for days on end. Discipline, not education,<br/>
was the rule, they said.<br/>
<br/>
For Laura Hamel, 17, of Vienna, Va., who counts herself as a success<br/>
story, it was a slow two-year ascent to graduation in March. She said<br/>
she was demoted from Level 3<br/>
back to Level 1 after giving a weeping, lonely friend a hug and a kiss<br/>
on the cheek at Thanksgiving. Affection of that kind is forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
A youth who rises to Levels 4, 5 and 6 can become a &quot;junior staff<br/>
member&quot; and &quot;participate in the discipline process&quot; against lower-level<br/>
youths, Casa&#39;s contract with<br/>
parents says.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The authority is in your hands,&quot; said Ryan Pink, 19, of El Paso, who<br/>
reached Level 5 at Casa. &quot;You can discipline kids. The younger kids <br/>
they were constantly being<br/>
restrained, being punished, put in R and R for four or five days. Nose<br/>
to the wall. Or nose to the ground. And at night you sleep in the<br/>
hallways.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many parents and youths say the behavior-management system of discipline<br/>
and punishment scares youths into sobriety and obedience. Others <br/>
parents and youths<br/>
formerly enrolled, education experts, government authorities and a<br/>
former Wwasps program director  say the programs profit from struggling<br/>
parents unable to handle their<br/>
depressed, delinquent, defiant or drug-abusing children.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Their goal is not to help teens in crisis or their families,&quot; according<br/>
to a former director of one Wwasps-affiliated program, Amberly Knight.<br/>
&quot;It is to make millions of dollars.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The financial success of Casa by the Sea is evident. Its enrollment has<br/>
nearly tripled, from about 200 youths when it opened in 1998 to more<br/>
than 570 today, almost all<br/>
American teenagers. Already among the biggest programs of its kind<br/>
outside the United States, Casa by the Sea has just spun off another<br/>
program for those 18 and over.<br/>
<br/>
Tuition and fees at Casa by the Sea run about $30,000 a year, half of<br/>
what some United States-based programs cost. Its staff members &quot;do not<br/>
need and may not<br/>
necessarily have&quot; teaching credentials, Casa&#39;s contract with parents<br/>
plainly states.<br/>
<br/>
Lon Woodbury, publisher of Woodbury Reports, which rates schools and<br/>
programs for troubled teenagers inside and outside the United States,<br/>
said one reason that<br/>
American programs have moved abroad is &quot;to avoid the laws and<br/>
regulations of the States.&quot; He added, &quot;They can hire minimum-wage staff<br/>
and still charge stateside prices.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Profit margins and growth within the programs run by Wwasps appear<br/>
solid. Teen Help, the affiliation&#39;s main marketing arm, was the single<br/>
biggest corporate campaign<br/>
contributor in the state of Utah in the 2002 election cycle, donating<br/>
$215,290 to Republican campaigns, according to online federal election<br/>
records posted in March.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Kay, the Wwasps president, said that the proof of the programs&#39;<br/>
success is the way in which &quot;behavior of students generally changes<br/>
drastically.&quot; The organization&#39;s<br/>
internal surveys, he said, proved that &quot;more than 98 percent of the<br/>
schools&#39; parents are completely satisfied.&quot; He wrote, &quot;No wonder these<br/>
are the fastest growing Schools of<br/>
their kind in the world!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The overseas &quot;specialty boarding school&quot; industry is growing so fast<br/>
that United States consular officials in overseas embassies say they<br/>
have no idea how many such<br/>
programs exist.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No authorities in Mexico control these institutions,&quot; said Elisa<br/>
Ledesma, a lawyer at the American Consulate in Tijuana. Consular<br/>
officers demanded and received access<br/>
to several such programs in Mexico, one official said, after they &quot;heard<br/>
horror stories from parents.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The consular officers have the power, under the Vienna Convention, to<br/>
visit overseas programs to check on the well-being of American citizens<br/>
under 18.<br/>
<br/>
In January, after several such visits, the State Department issued a<br/>
notice on &quot;behavior modification facilities&quot; in Mexico, Costa Rica and<br/>
Jamaica. The programs may<br/>
&quot;isolate the children in relatively remote sites&quot; and restrict their<br/>
contact with the outside world, it said.<br/>
<br/>
At least seven programs in Utah, Montana, South Carolina and New York<br/>
are Wwasps affiliates, according to the organization&#39;s Web site; at<br/>
least three have faced legal<br/>
challenges. Utah state officials say they are reviewing the license of<br/>
the flagship Wwasps program, Cross Creek Manor, and that a second<br/>
program, Majestic Ranch, is<br/>
operating without a proper license.<br/>
<br/>
Six weeks ago, according to the state attorney general&#39;s office in Utah,<br/>
a director of Majestic Ranch entered into a court agreement to have no<br/>
unsupervised contact with<br/>
children after he was charged with misdemeanor child abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Attorneys for both programs contest the licensing challenges. South<br/>
Carolina officials have fined a third Wwasps program, Carolina Springs<br/>
Academy, $5,000 for operating<br/>
without a license.<br/>
<br/>
While some dissatisfied parents have sued Wwasps and its programs, the<br/>
contract that parents sign with Casa by the Sea sets high hurdles for<br/>
them. It states plainly that<br/>
the program &quot;does not accept responsibility for services written in<br/>
sales materials or brochures&quot; or promises made by &quot;staff or public<br/>
relations personnel&quot; and that any<br/>
dispute between a parent and the program must be settled in a Mexican<br/>
court, not in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The Wwasps programs market themselves under a multitude of interlinked<br/>
Web sites. Their sales personnel offer thousands of dollars in<br/>
incentives to adults who recruit new<br/>
youths or host Web sites advertising the programs.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents said in interviews that they enrolled their children in<br/>
programs they had never visited after browsing Web sites, brochures and<br/>
videotapes depicting happy<br/>
children in a wholesome setting.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I sent him there sight unseen,&quot; said Patti Reddoch, of Sweeny, Tex.,<br/>
who considered Dundee Ranch for her son, Edmund Brumaghin, now 17, but<br/>
chose Casa by the Sea<br/>
instead. &quot;The music he was listening to started getting darker and he<br/>
was getting more into the drugs, and that&#39;s when I decided I needed to<br/>
do something.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So I went on the Internet and started searching around and found the<br/>
Wwasp program. I contacted them and made the arrangements, and that&#39;s<br/>
pretty much it. It didn&#39;t take<br/>
me any time at all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Reddoch, speaking by telephone, said she then hired an &quot;escort<br/>
service&quot; familiar with Casa by the Sea to handcuff and transport her son<br/>
away at 5 a.m. one Sunday<br/>
last September.<br/>
<br/>
That morning, her son cursed her bitterly, but now his attitude is<br/>
changing, she said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am very pleased with the school,&quot; said Ms. Reddoch, who said she<br/>
visited Casa by the Sea once, for a weekend, last January. &quot;I&#39;ve started<br/>
putting out brochures for<br/>
referrals. I would recommend Casa to anyone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Reality may differ from the brochures, however. &quot;Everyone has a shaved<br/>
head,&quot; Michael Zieghelboim, who was formerly enrolled at Casa by the<br/>
Sea, said in a telephone<br/>
interview. &quot;They walk around like zombies. Most of the staff have no<br/>
training.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Casa by the Sea was the scariest thing that ever happened to me,&quot; said<br/>
Mr. Zieghelboim, who now lives with his father in El Salvador.<br/>
<br/>
He said that despite falling behind in his education at Casa by the Sea<br/>
 at 17, he is now in the 10th grade  he rates himself a success. &quot;If I<br/>
had never gone there, I&#39;d<br/>
probably still be doing cocaine,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of tough discipline is an attraction for many exasperated<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
The program runs &quot;a very tight ship,&quot; said Virginia Day, of Redmond,<br/>
Wash., who sent her son, Gabriel, 15, to the program in July.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The staff that works most closely with the kids are not necessarily<br/>
professionals, and I know that this is an issue,&quot; said Ms. Day, who<br/>
called herself a very satisfied<br/>
customer. &quot;This is not a school that specializes in a therapeutic<br/>
component.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Carol Maxym, an educational consultant in Maryland, said: &quot;What they are<br/>
looking for at Casa is compliance. Compliance is easy, if you break the<br/>
kid down enough. And<br/>
compliance is cheap.&quot; She added, &quot;The parents often don&#39;t realize what&#39;s<br/>
going on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Youths and staff at other overseas Wwasps programs have described harsh<br/>
conditions. One was Aaron Kravig, now 19. He said he contracted scabies,<br/>
untreated for six<br/>
months, ate meals of watery porridge and fish entrails, and was schooled<br/>
almost solely with &quot;emotional growth&quot; videos at Tranquility Bay, the<br/>
Wwasps-affiliated program in<br/>
Jamaica, according to a transcript of sworn testimony he gave last year<br/>
at a Virginia state court hearing.<br/>
<br/>
In Costa Rica, Ms. Knight, the former director of the Wwasps-affiliated<br/>
Academy at Dundee Ranch, resigned in August after sending a letter to<br/>
the national minister of child<br/>
welfare calling for the program to be shut down.<br/>
<br/>
The letter said the program was &quot;hiring unqualified, untrained, staff&quot;<br/>
and providing &quot;the bare minimum of food and living essentials.&quot; It said<br/>
the program &quot;takes financial<br/>
advantage of parents in crisis, and puts teens in physical and emotional<br/>
risk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The speed with which some parents choose an overseas<br/>
behavioral-modification program for their children baffles some<br/>
educational consultants.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I find it incredible that parents would send their kids off to some<br/>
place they&#39;ve heard about on the Internet,&quot; Mr. Woodbury said.<br/>
<br/>
Ms. Maxym, author of &quot;Teens in Turmoil: A Path to Change for Parents,<br/>
Adolescents and their Families&quot; (Viking Penguin, 2000) said, &quot;I find it<br/>
interesting that parents will<br/>
spend less time finding a school for their child than buying a new car.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ryan Fraidenburgh&#39;s father, Bob, an aerospace engineering executive,<br/>
said he had only glanced at Casa by the Sea&#39;s &quot;brochures that looked<br/>
like Club Med.&quot; He said he<br/>
removed Ryan from the program by himself in January 2001 after deciding<br/>
he had been too hasty.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We made a huge mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;Until the day I die I&#39;ll regret<br/>
that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ryan&#39;s mother, Carolyn, said: &quot;We were expecting treatment, not a<br/>
minimum-wage person to watch over your kid like he was an animal in a<br/>
cage.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Wow.<br/>
Not letting them speak English, them not knowing Spanish, school denying <br/>
responsibility...  It&#39;s at the very LEAST a recipe for sexual abuse.<br/>

<br/>
So it&#39;s not kidnapping or false imprisonment if the parents say &quot;okay&quot;? <br/>
Does that mean parents could sell their kids into slavery?<br/>
<br/>
What the hell IS with children&#39;s rights in this country?  Maybe they really <br/>
do have none whatsoever.  Maybe THIS could get pressure going on the U.S. to s<br/>
ign off on /in on the U.N. declaration on the rights of children.<br/>

<br/>
After that, though, the public school system must REALLY look like Club Med!<br/>
And dark music and rock&#39;n&#39;roll would even look pretty good if the parents had <br/>
any compassion whatsoever.  <br/>
<br/>
But I guess it&#39;s not an article about compassion.<br/>

I was half way through the second paragraph, above and the voice in my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566966128">This article was extremely upsetting to me.  My niece is in one of <br/>
the schools mentioned in the article.  Her mother, my dh&#39;s sister, is <br/>
a general wreck as a parent so we all saw the blow up coming.  Her <br/>
other 2 children has alot of problems too so my poor niece was the <br/>
last in line and truely crying out for help.  Granted, from what my <br/>
SIL &quot;told&quot; us she was heavily into drugs by the time she sent her.  <br/>
However, he mother has made horrible decisions and is the kind of <br/>
person who blames everything on baf luck.  No ability to take <br/>
responsibility.  We were all devestated when we heard. Her mother had <br/>
a habit of keeping her kids away while they were in trouble and then <br/>
suddenly you would hear when there was a big blow up (i.e her 15 to <br/>
daughter was 5 months pregnant before we heard), mind you the whole <br/>
family sees eachother at all holidays so it is not exactly easy to <br/>
hide someone.  Anyway, by the time we heard she was sent.  <br/>
<br/>
You know in your heart it is going to be terrible.  They have sent <br/>
two pictures thus far and she has lost a tremendous amount od <br/>
weight.  No one can talk to her until she earns X amount if points, <br/>
levels.  Me and DH refused to write.  We felt that we would not be a <br/>
ble to express our true feelings because we knew things were being <br/>
filtered down to her.  She has been there for about a year (the <br/>
school in Jamaica).  The few letters we have recieved are so <br/>
ridiculous, they are like a little kid wrote them.  Everyone has said <br/>
it sounds like completely brainwashed words. I was crying when I read <br/>
the article because I know she will never recover from what they are <br/>
doing to her.  Me and DH had talked of taking her in, but mom lives <br/>
so close and lets her get away with somuch that we could not see it <br/>
being do-able.<br/>
<br/>
So what to do??  I am sending the article to her mom although I am <br/>
sure she will pull out the parts about the mom who claimed it <br/>
worked.  I also plan to make sure my dh&#39;s whole family gets a copy <br/>
because her mother is not going to quitely hide away.  But beyond <br/>
that I am afraid she is going to leave her there.<br/>
<br/>
Anway, terribly sorry to blab but had to get it off my chest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-455483966">I say, do everything feasable to get her out.  If that means suing for <br/>
custody, then that&#39;s the route *I&#39;d* take.  But, I know it takes money and <br/>
generally, lots of it.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 14, my mother put me into a treatment facility because I snuck <br/>
out her car.  ONCE!  Seriously, that was the extent to my &#39;badness&#39;.  My <br/>
brother wasn&#39;t far behind me.  Her excuse with him was that he was <br/>
rebellious.  (Whatever that meant to her.)  The thing that pisses me off <br/>
about these places, very popular in the 80&#39;s, is that they needed no excuse. <br/>
  When I was in the &#39;hospital&#39;, they told my mother I was pregnant.  I&#39;d <br/>
NEVER even had SEX!  When my next period started, they told me I was having <br/>
a miscarriage.  I was put in solitary because I threw such a fit and begged <br/>
my family to get me out.  No one listened to me.  That damn place had my <br/>
entire family convinced I was a horrible kid.  NOW they tell me they wished <br/>
they would have done something to help me.  My mom bounced us aound from <br/>
family member to facility without a bat of an eye.  I think the worst part <br/>
of it now is that she acts like she doesn&#39;t remember it.  She&#39;s apologized <br/>
profusely for being a bad mom, in general, but ignores or changes the <br/>
conversation when those days come up.<br/>
<br/>
I am still affected by those experiences.  In many ways, it&#39;s good.  I <br/>
became a mother at 16, but was hell bent on being the best mother I could <br/>
possibly be.  I&#39;m very proud of what I have accomplished in the past 15 <br/>
years, despite all the &#39;proof&#39; that children, such as myself, end up <br/>
repeating the cycle.  I didn&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, my brother wasn&#39;t as fortunate.  He lived his life a shadow of my <br/>
mother&#39;s.  Irresponsible, depressed and lonely.  His whole life was focused <br/>
on himself.  He has a beautiful son but never quite got himself together <br/>
enough to be the father he could have been.  He was a great guy with a great <br/>
soul but was forever torn because of his childhood.  He died in December of <br/>
&#39;01 of a heroin overdose.  The last time I saw him, a couple of days before <br/>
he died, he told me no one loved him because we (the family at large) <br/>
wouldn&#39;t help him.  He had been in a car accident and just received a <br/>
$10,000 settlement.  By day 4, all but $500 dollars was gone, but he didn&#39;t <br/>
have the money to get an apartment.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago, I found letters my family sent me while I was in the <br/>
hospital.  My brother had written me a letter, asking me to help him make <br/>
rules so mom wouldn&#39;t make him go back into the hospital again.  (I&#39;d been <br/>
in 4 times, plus time spent in a children&#39;s home, and he&#39;d been in twice.)  <br/>
He didn&#39;t understand why anyone in our family wouldn&#39;t help.  Why mom was <br/>
making *him* make the rules.  He was only 13!  It wasn&#39;t his job!  He was <br/>
failing a class in school and that was her reason for sending him in for the <br/>
last time.  He moved in with my great grandparents but I guess the damamge <br/>
was done.  He never recovered from everything that had happened.  He was 25 <br/>
when he died.  NOW, my mother is feeling the guilt.  She lost her job so we <br/>
moved in and took over payments.  We found out a few days ago that she <br/>
wasn&#39;t making the payments we were giving her and the house is in <br/>
foreclosure, so we are ridding ourselves of the relationship and buying a <br/>
new house.  I talked to her the other day (she lives with my grandparents <br/>
now) and told her how much it hurt me that she would do this to my family.  <br/>
Especially my children.  Her response was, &quot;I know!  I&#39;m losing everything I <br/>
have!  Don&#39;t you know I am miserably depressed because I won&#39;t have anything <br/>
now?&quot;   She still doesn&#39;t get it.  It&#39;s all about her.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, here I go again, seriously side-tracking.  Basically, my point is that <br/>
if I were in your shoes, I&#39;d do everything in my power to help my neice.  <br/>
What happened to her baby?  To me, it doesn&#39;t sound like this poor girl has <br/>
what she needs at home.  Perhaps the family could rally together to help <br/>
her?  I think showing this article would be of great help.  I know my family <br/>
didn&#39;t see the place I was in for what it was(n&#39;t) worth.  They just <br/>
believed my mother, even when their instinct told them otherwise.  Having <br/>
the &quot;professionals&quot; on my mom&#39;s side surely didn&#39;t make it any easier for <br/>
them to believe me.  I wish they had.<br/>

<br/>
I have thought about it although I don&#39;t know if that would help <br/>
altogether.  Her mother sounds a bit like yours, unable to make <br/>
responsible decisions for her children.  We live minutes apart.  I am <br/>
afraid if we had her, she would just rush there to get her way.  BTW, <br/>
should have clarified it was her sister who got pregnant and her <br/>
brother got his girlfried pregnant at the same time.  My poor niece <br/>
was stuck in a house with 2 pregnant teens, a lazy brother both of <br/>
whom had ben kicked out of school and were being *followed* by the <br/>
police due to their associations. She was basically the neglegted <br/>
kid.  My SIL had warned her mother, and we all discussed it, that as <br/>
soon as all the preganacies hit my niece (in the program) would need <br/>
lots of extra attention.  She just started to dissapear from us and <br/>
then she was in Jamiaca.  That family&#39;s list of problems is endless.  <br/>
My husband took care of her kids for a big part of their and hid <br/>
childhood.  I think he actually just blocks alot of it out.  It <br/>
really hurts him to see all the problems in the home.<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry to hear you went through such hard times.  You should <br/>
really be proud that you have become such a wonderful mom!  I can <br/>
tell how commited you are by what you post.  I hope I get to meet you <br/>
and your crew someday ;)  We are defintely passing the article around <br/>
and I am going to stir the *sh*t* with his family and see what can <br/>
happen from there.  I am going to send my niece a care package of <br/>
some kind but they are extremely strict about what she can have.  I <br/>
am not sure what will be left by the time she gets it.   My DH <br/>
suggested a short letter that says &quot;when you come out you have <br/>
someone here who loves you and wants to listen.&quot;  I thought that <br/>
sounded good.  What would you have wanted to hear besides, &quot;you&#39;re <br/>
free&quot;.<br/>

almost the exact same thing. :)<br/>

You are NOT a bad kid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That would have made me feel there was *some* sense of hope.  Even if I knew <br/>
I couldn&#39;t get out yet.  It&#39;s hard to remember everything I was feeling at <br/>
that time, but from reading the letters I wrote back then, I think those <br/>
things would have made all the difference in the world.  In a situation like <br/>
that...and I think mine was probably MUCH better than where she is...it&#39;s so <br/>
easy to feel like no one gives a shit.  Just keep writing.  Everyday if you <br/>
can.  Even if it&#39;s almost the exact same thing every time.  Tell her <br/>
wonderful stories of times you have shared with her.  Tell her every good <br/>

I&#39;d definitely call an attorney.  Most will at least talk to you for free <br/>
for half an hour.  Call 50 if you have to!  They won&#39;t know you already <br/>
talked to someone else! At least to explore your options and find out if <br/>
you, or anyone in the family, have any.  It may be possible to have a <br/>
restraining order taken out against her mother, initially.  I don&#39;t know the <br/>
entire story, so I may be a little overboard as to my feelings and <br/>
suggestions about it, but if she signed her rights away and her daughter is <br/>
living anything close to what that article described, I&#39;d be scared <br/>
shitless.  I&#39;m so sorry. :(<br/>
