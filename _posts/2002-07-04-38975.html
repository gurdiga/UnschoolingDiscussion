<div id="ygrps-yiv-507653582">Thanks all for your input. KEEP THEM COMING!<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 5 (Evan) and 2.5 (Aidan) and BOTH are teaching themselves <br/>
reading with software games. We eat, think, sleep computers in this <br/>
household. That&#39;s why the kids want to work with them now ---paper is <br/>
not of much consequence to them (although we read a lot).<br/>
<br/>
My husband is an Internet artist and software developer; I <br/>
collaborate with him in NetArt projects and am a webEditor so our <br/>
kids have basically were born with computers around them. Mark even <br/>
developed on of his NetArt pieces with Evan&#39;s input when he was about <br/>
1 year old.  Since they see mommy and daddy making fun, game like art <br/>
with computers at all times of day, they want to play-work with them <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
We have used JUMPSTART SPANISH and I highly recommend it for <br/>
introducing Spanish to kids. I have seen other things and they pretty <br/>
much suck (I taught Spanish & Portuguese in college for 8 years). I <br/>
have seriously considered producing one of my own for more in depth <br/>
learning of the language.<br/>
<br/>
We love ARTHUR and there are 2 cd&#39;s that are out of print --ARTHURs <br/>
TEACHER TROUBLE & ARTHURs READING RACE. They are excellent. The first <br/>
one is particularly good because kids can learn to read the story in <br/>
both English and Spanish. I wonder if there is a Canadian version <br/>
with French in it.<br/>
<br/>
What else have we used? Oh, GREEN EGGS & HAM is pretty good too. I <br/>
also got a BLUES CLUES cd and Aidan likes it a lot --it is a little <br/>
to basic for Evan.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there are 2 websites we use all the time: NICKJR.com and <br/>
PBSKIDS.org. They have a lot of interactive games, lesson plans, <br/>
printouts, music ... you name it. They are excellent.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering about the phonics cd because our libraries do not <br/>
have it; so there is no way for us to try it out first. I SPY is so <br/>
good, with its riddles and such, that I am buying it.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<br/>
Our children also use the computer quite a bit, and learn a great deal from<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to mention an excellent program called Kid Pix, and another called<br/>
Storybook Weaver.  I am sure you can look up better descriptions on Amazon<br/>
or Barnes and Noble...to get a better description than I could offer.  I<br/>
highly recommend both of those CD&#39;s.<br/>
