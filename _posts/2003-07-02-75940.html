Just the other day we were at the fabric store picking out stuff for <br/>
a Harry <br/>

<br/>
Hey Kelly,<br/>
   My children started a Harry Potter School of Wizards (very <br/>
informal) and we were wondering did you use a pattern while making <br/>
the robe or just winged it?? <br/>
   They have made their own wands out of tree branches which they <br/>
carved, painted and glittered.(I was very impressed w/finished <br/>
product!!) We&#39;ve looked at different sites and prices for robes are <br/>
very expensive. I&#39;m hoping to make their robes at home as well so any <br/>
advice or hints are greatly appriciated. <br/>
         Thanks,<br/>
            Kimberly</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Kelly... but we picked up a book at Barnes and Noble the other day, <br/>
The Book of Wizard Craft by Janice Eaton Kilby et al.  It has many different <br/>
crafts like that in it.  Making a hat, a turban, wand, cloak, robes etc etc.  <br/>
Looks really easy and only basic sewing skills needed. Gives directions and how <br/>
to take measurements, how much material would be needed etc. We are going to <br/>
make the robe and cloak to start with.<br/>

in one afternoon---he could NOT have been more thrilled! He hasn&#39;t taken it <br/>
off except to sleep! &lt;G&gt; Gillian&#39;s husband spent the day with him. He wore it <br/>
today to the grocery and to K-mart.  Patrick says that Duncan was oblivious, but <br/>
that every child who saw him was SOOO envious! Eyes like saucers!<br/>
<br/>
We got a Simplicity pattern. There are three children on the front: a boy <br/>
with glasses and a black robe with silver and purple trim, a girl with a wand, <br/>
and another boy with a gold-ish robe. Duncan picked out a black robe with red <br/>
trim and sparkly-silvery-with moons-and-stars sleeves. The black hat has <br/>
yellow-gold lining. The pattern calls for a hook & eye closing. Gillian put a &quot;tie&quot; <br/>
at the neck instead.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Duncan and Patrick got a dowel. Duncan sawed it to the &quot;perfect&quot; <br/>
length and then painted it red (to match)!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s just too cute!<br/>
