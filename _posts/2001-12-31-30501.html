even babies just starting to eat, will always go for foods that *their* <br/>
bodies need - they were careful to mention that the children were <br/>
presented a variety of wholesome foods - and reiterated NO JUNK.<br/>
<br/>
Children should be allowed to pick their own foods from the start. Which <br/>
includes nursing at will for however long a session or however long in <br/>
years that that child feels compelled to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Its not natural when those choices include addicting and &#39;druglike&#39; foods <br/>
such as refined sugar.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to defer to some of Daniel Greenbergs advice from his Child <br/>
Rearing book. (Greenberg was co-founder of Sudbury Valley School - as <br/>
unschooling as you can get in a school - no teachers and classes on <br/>
student initiation only)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In order to allow childrend the free choice they require in their diet, <br/>
the home environment has to have enough variety to make up whatever <br/>
deficiencies the children&#39;s feedback mechanism forces them to notice and <br/>
repair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He also makes a purposeful note of again making sure the environment is <br/>
monitored carefully for poisons. Not just medicines, but foodstuffs.<br/>
<br/>
And I quote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This applies particularly to things like sugar, which is the most common <br/>
poison used in our culture... Like its relative, alcohol, sugar is <br/>
addictive and creates an ever growing need in the system for more and <br/>
more, to the point where the system is no longer able to keeps itself <br/>
alive. I suspect that initially a child&#39;s intake of sugar and alcohol <br/>
will mimic that of his parents, but I&#39;m not sure; at any rate, the <br/>
problem of regulating or eliminating these and other poisons is one that <br/>
cannot be ignored.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Again quoting from a previous chapter:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It has been demonstrated repeatedly that purified sugar - not all sweet <br/>
tasting food, no honey or molasses or many other such sweets, but pure <br/>
sugar - if given freely along with other foods to healthy animals or <br/>
people, will pre-empt nutritional foods, and the animals will often <br/>
continue to eat it  until they die of malnutrition. There is something <br/>
about sugar that apparently throws the natural balance off completely.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope this clears up any confusion one might have in a household with <br/>
free-range moppets *grin* Just offer the best of the best and let their <br/>
bodies decide.<br/>

only then, we buy Bazooka. Yes, Bazooka. It has refinded sugar BUT it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a lot of the other crap that a lot of gums have. And it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have aspartme (sp) which is deadlier than refinded sugar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217813281">Since I&#39;m just starting my path down the food sensitivity route, and believe milk and milk products are causing a large problem of ADD symptoms to my son, what would you recommend to use as substitutes for milk, ice cream, cheese in macaroni and cheese, etc? My son is feeling very deprived right now without his milk. He went from having milk problems as a baby to over the years and adding the milk back into his diet (after soy), thinking he was ok. He was our biggest milk drinker in the family. I have since decided that he may indeed still have problems and milk is probably it. It&#39;s only been about a week, and I can&#39;t tell yet, and wonder at what point I will be able to tell if it&#39;s helping. I haven&#39;t given him the Adderall in the last week and wonder if I can give him the medication and still do an elimination diet at the same time?<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; you<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; say sweets yes.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pat<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Yes, my house is processed sugar-free.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; There&#39;s something called &#39;Sundrops&#39; which are dead ringers for M&Ms.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; We have cookies (some flavoured with organic cane juice, some with <br/>
&gt;&gt; fruit<br/>
&gt;&gt; juice)<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Ice cream is organic cane juice sweetened or honey sweetened.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I remember making whipped cream for the kid&#39;s first b&#39;day cake with<br/>
&gt;&gt; organic heavy cream and maple syrup.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Peelu is the gum I buy that is sweetened with malt sugars (I think, I<br/>
&gt;&gt; don&#39;t have a pack on me to look it up).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Lollipops with malt sugar or honey. And Jellybeans with malt sugar or<br/>
&gt;&gt; fruit juice.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Jellos and puddings are also available.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; And there&#39;s a great line of honey sweetened cereals available now.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; On *rare* occasion when we&#39;re away or out and about, my son wants <br/>
&gt;&gt; &#39;bubble<br/>
&gt;&gt; gum&#39;, since the Peelu is minty and he thinks is too spicy. So then, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; only then, we buy Bazooka. Yes, Bazooka. It has refinded sugar BUT it<br/>
&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t have a lot of the other crap that a lot of gums have. And it<br/>
&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t have aspartme (sp) which is deadlier than refinded sugar.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Keeping these treats in my purse, or in a goodie backpack that we drag<br/>
&gt;&gt; around, is a great way to keep outside influences from making my son <br/>
&gt;&gt; feel<br/>
&gt;&gt; slighted.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; TV advertisements does make it hard on me. BUT, luckily the health food<br/>
&gt;&gt; community has come FAR from the &#39;wheatgrass only&#39; days and now we can <br/>
&gt;&gt; get<br/>
&gt;&gt; some yogurt squeezies (Stonyfield) and some ice pops and *almost*<br/>
&gt;&gt; everything else that is marketed towards children sans the junky<br/>
&gt;&gt; chemicals.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I have no problems when he goes into the goodie drawer (the <br/>
&gt;&gt; ex-big-bread<br/>
&gt;&gt; drawer) and takes what he wants.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116126448">This is just a suggestion so do with it what you will . . . <br/>
try organic milk instead of eliminating entirely.  <br/>
and experiment with eliminating other chemical additives too.  <br/>
<br/>
See my previous post about Wyndham&#39;s allergies.  His symptoms can <br/>
look like ADD at times too.  Of course when we don&#39;t eliminate the <br/>
offending substance it progresses to rashes and asthma within hours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-386735864">One of the reasons for not using refined sugar is how they are refined.<br/>
Bone char (charcoal) and/or pressure lead filters are used.  &quot;pure&quot; cane<br/>
sugar simply refers to only cane, not beet sugar being used.  refined sugars<br/>
are far from &quot;pure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Quite  a few vegetarians only use beet sugars because the bone char is used<br/>
in cane sugars.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one link that explains the process <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sucrose.com/lref.html">http://www.sucrose.com/lref.html</a><br/>
<br/>
This site explains the process for getting the bone char which is not<br/>
something I want in my food source<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj97mar/973sugar.htm">http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj97mar/973sugar.htm</a> and is another reason we<br/>
only buy the kosher &quot;jello&quot; that have no geletin in them!<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to use sugar, buy the organic raw sugars.  They are not<br/>
chemically processed.<br/>

I bought the Tofutti the other day and my son loved it! And the Rice Dream milk is very good! I like it much better than the Westsoy. The Silk brand is pretty good too. <br/>

Mac & Cheese and other such - Check around.  We have a couple natural <br/>

Jenni too was our biggest milk drinker.  We discovered her problem <br/>
because I was a bad mom and ran out of milk - twice - when she was <br/>
3.  Some of her symptoms cleared up immediately.  Some others took <br/>
longer.  But those quick ones tipped us off.  She gets the classic <br/>

week, and I can&#39;t tell yet, and wonder at what point I will be able <br/>
to tell if it&#39;s helping. I haven&#39;t given him the Adderall in the last <br/>

elimination diet at the same time?<br/>

<br/>
Although letting kids decide their own bedtime etc, works for some people,<br/>
it does NOT work for us. We went that route for some time, also allowing the<br/>
kids to get for themselves, mainly our son as he is older, but the day he<br/>
came to me and told me that he missed some things that he really liked and<br/>
it made him sad that I didn&#39;t do some things for him like I used to. He was<br/>
completely understanding about taking care of more things for himself, but<br/>
this was actually making him sad. There were little comforts that my mother<br/>
did for me when I was very young, but then she stopped doing and I took<br/>
these things as she didn&#39;t care. I really understood what he was saying. Our<br/>
children decide a lot of things for themselves, but not everything.<br/>
About the bedtime-like I said, although letting kids choose their own<br/>
bedtime works for some, it doesn&#39;t work for us. Our daughter just falls<br/>
apart when she gets too tired, and it turns evenings into chaos. There is<br/>
something to be said in our house for a calming evening regime. Our son<br/>
would love to stay up until 3:00 am or later if he could, has fought sleep<br/>
ever since he left the womb :-). When he would stay up late, he would still<br/>
wake up at 8:00 am! He could stay up until 1:30 am and he would still wake<br/>
before 8am. Sometimes earlier. This would work for a day, but then we would<br/>
ALL suffer because he would turn into such an ornery little bugger that it<br/>
wasn&#39;t just effecting him, it was effecting all of us. A friend of mine<br/>
comments often about how hard it is to have a later schedule as her kids<br/>
will end up sleeping until almost noon, and in our neck of the woods<br/>
(Pacific Northwest), up beyond that 38th parallel, it&#39;s dark by 4:00 pm and<br/>
when their day should be half done, it&#39;s already basically over. I believe<br/>
they have changed the bedtime hour, but I know it was hard for her. I can<br/>
see how, when our son is a little older, staying up later and little more<br/>
regularly might happen, and sometimes the kids stay up later than usual.<br/>
Last night they stayed up until 11:45 watching a movie, but the night before<br/>
they were zonked by 8:30.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just old fashioned in the belief that although your children can<br/>
lead their own interests, and learning in so many ways, there is a level of<br/>
guidance that they not only need, but can really thrive on and take comfort<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
Also, being as though our kids go to sleep in our bed, dh puts them in their<br/>
beds when we go to sleep but one or both usually end up back in our bed by<br/>
morning, our time alone is extremely limited. I have come to realize that if<br/>
mom isn&#39;t doing for mom a little bit, everyone will end up  feeling it. I<br/>
need some quiet time now and then in the evening, and I cherish when I get<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you, and like I said before, this is what works for US, I know<br/>
there are so many of you that keep all different hours, so please don&#39;t<br/>
flame me for stating what works for us.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not going to flame you! but I cam going to state what works for us since<br/>
it is in stark contrast to what you have described.<br/>
<br/>
There are 4 of us in this household. DH works from 7pm to 7am so when he<br/>
comes home in the morning, he sleeps until about 1:00 in the afternoon. <br/>
DD age 15 wakes up about noon or 1:00pm. She does stuff around home until<br/>
dance classes start which is, on average 6 pm and doesn&#39;t end until about<br/>
9:30 (depending on the day).  She stays up until 2:30 or 3:30 every single<br/>
night. She&#39;s a teen, don&#39;t cha know and that equates to a lot of time with<br/>
her online friends so her hours do not conflict with anyone elses&#39; sleep<br/>
times because she&#39;s doing something that is quiet. <br/>
Youngest dd, age 11 keeps more of a time schedule like mine... bed about<br/>
midnight and up about 9. I *do* have to ask her to qive me some time to<br/>
myself almost daily because she would otherwise bring *every* craft project,<br/>
every book, every whatever into my room and want to involve me with it.  The<br/>
more I try to push her away, the clingier she gets so I have to usually do<br/>
something with her and *then* point out that it is now time for *me* to do <br/>
blah blah blah (hang out here :-)). Then, she feels like she&#39;s had my<br/>
undivided attention and is fine about going off to do something on her own. <br/>
 I have to  recognize that each of us has our own inner clocks and times<br/>
that are our peak times. For us, it&#39;s all different but we have learned to<br/>
honor those times for ourselves without bothering the next guy. <br/>

I think it is important to realize that every family is different.  <br/>
For many, no bed times works, for other it does not.  Some start out <br/>
with bedtimes and gradually do away with them.  There is a whole <br/>
spectrum of variety.<br/>
If what you are doing is working for you and EVERYONE is happy with <br/>
the situation, then stick with it.<br/>
We have no set bedtimes but Wyndham occassionally gets into a cycle <br/>
of staying up later and later.  We encourage hime to switch back <br/>
subtly.  Rachel is 16 and chooses when to sleep.  I only intervene if <br/>
she is sleeping more than 12 hours a day and then it is merely to <br/>
point it out so she can figure out what&#39;s out of whack.  Jenni is 14, <br/>
goes to bed when she wants and gets up when she wants and sleeps what <br/>
many consider to be &quot;normal&quot; hours.  She&#39;s the ONLY one I never talk <br/>
to about sleeping not because she sleeps normal hours but because she <br/>
is consistent and healthy.<br/>
<br/>
As for the issue of alone time for parents, ours are old enough that <br/>
we can just say it flat out when we want to be left alone for a <br/>
while.  But when they were littler, we had an open door all the <br/>
time.  Sure it cut down on our privacy and limited things for us, but <br/>
the kids always came first.  They are only little for a few years.<br/>

What a sweet mother you are.  It is true they grow too fast.  And, it *is* <br/>
essential to get creative in those &#39;limited private times&#39; you mention above. <br/>
 We have a nest full of little ones still.  It is all too important to see to <br/>
it that those private &#39;needs&#39; are met (my husband wouldn&#39;t have it any other <br/>
WAY!).  After the kids are grown it&#39;s back to &#39;just the two of you&#39;.  :)<br/>

<br/>
Looks like it&#39;s about evenly divided so far on &quot;get used to it, find quiet<br/>
time elsewhere&quot; and &quot;respect goes both ways&quot;.  I&#39;m weighing in on the<br/>
&quot;respect goes both ways&quot; side.  (I&#39;ve also noted a difference in the<br/>
responses based on the ages of the children--I think this is key....any<br/>
child who isn&#39;t old enough to be left alone unsupervised would require<br/>
different choices than a teen, for example.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care at all what time my kids go to SLEEP, but they are required to<br/>
respect the needs of others in our family.  Their Dad has to get up early in<br/>
the morning and go to work to support our family...he needs his sleep.  They<br/>
can stay awake as long as they want as long as they&#39;re not disturbing<br/>
others.  My 3 kids have different sleep needs from each other, too, so that<br/>
the one who likes to stay up late has to turn his stereo off (or use<br/>
headphones) when the others with bedrooms near him want to go to sleep.  And<br/>
there are times when my husband and I want to watch a movie that isn&#39;t<br/>
appropriate for them and we&#39;ll ask them to find something else to do.  It&#39;s<br/>
not a problem--there are plenty of &quot;something elses&quot; that they&#39;d rather do<br/>
than watch a movie....and I respect similar needs of theirs.<br/>
<br/>
From the time my kids were quite little (I suppose it happened about the<br/>
time they moved out of our family bed and into their own rooms), I told them<br/>
it was &quot;quiet time&quot; (as opposed to &quot;bed time&quot;).  They could find something<br/>
quiet to do in their rooms or they could choose to turn the lights off and<br/>
go to sleep.   It has also been influenced a LOT by the floor plan of the<br/>
houses we&#39;ve lived in and the ages of my children.  Also, (Sarah--another<br/>
thing we have in common) my husband worked shift-work for a couple of years<br/>
and during this time, the &quot;quiet hours&quot; were different but the common theme<br/>
was respect for the needs of others.  &quot;Sleep&quot; is a *vital* need.<br/>
<br/>
And on another thread....<br/>
<br/>
I think it was you, Pat, who asked the other day about &quot;what if they have to<br/>
get up early in the morning&quot; and also about having time for breakfast.  We<br/>
had an interesting discussion about this just a couple months ago.  &quot;If they<br/>
have to get up early&quot; has never been an issue for us.  Since we never really<br/>
*had* a bedtime, the kids have accepted their responsibility for their sleep<br/>
needs very well.  So if I remind them at night that they have an early<br/>
morning, they will take the initiative and get to sleep at a decent hour.<br/>
(I suspect after a &quot;testing&quot; period, your kids will make the same<br/>
responsible choices, too.)<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;eat&quot; thing was a problem from time to time, though.  Probably because<br/>
I&#39;m overweight and have &quot;food issues&quot; myself!  One morning we were headed to<br/>
a ballet performance and before we left the house I told the kids to eat<br/>
some sort of quick protein because the ballet wasn&#39;t over until 2:00 and we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t eat lunch until then.  One of them didn&#39;t eat anything and we<br/>
argued about it in the car.  He reminded me that if HE didn&#39;t eat, then it<br/>
was HE who paid the consequences and that didn&#39;t have anything to do with<br/>
me.  I replied that as long as it didn&#39;t make him grouchy or sick (his blood<br/>
sugar was flaky from time to time as he was going through a teen growth<br/>
spurt then), then that was true, but that I was his Mom and I worried about<br/>
things like that--it was my job.  We talked at length about DHS and parents<br/>
who don&#39;t feed their kids and what parental responsibility entailed.<br/>
Anyway--very long discussion ensued where he told me that he was old enough<br/>
to manage his eating habits on his own....to which we agreed that meant even<br/>
preparing dinners and lunches.  He *is* a responsible young man and I<br/>
realized then that he WAS capable of these decisions.<br/>
<br/>
It was a discovery of freedom for both of us.  He was free to manage his own<br/>
diet and I was free from feeling like it was my responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere that when considering these sorts of parenting decisions,<br/>
it helps to ask yourself if you would set these same rules for another<br/>
adult--your spouse or sibling, maybe.  In the above scenario, if I was going<br/>
to the ballet with my husband, I might also remind him that we&#39;d need to eat<br/>
a late lunch (as I am generally assumed to be the &quot;scheduler&quot; in the family,<br/>
he wouldn&#39;t necessarily know this), but I would never presume to TELL him<br/>
what he should eat.  I&#39;m not of the belief that *every* parental decision<br/>
would be equal to a decision you would make for another adult, but it *does*<br/>
help me to clarify where those lines are for me.<br/>
<br/>
My lifelong-unschooler son helped me remember that the keys to this<br/>
parenting journey are *communication* and *flexibility*.  I set some<br/>
boundaries; he challenged them; I listened to his arguments; he listened to<br/>
mine; we refined the boundaries to better suit both of us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264437459">I agree Leslie and Mimi. Flexibility. For example, last night the kids were<br/>
up laaaate doing science experiments on the front porch, creating a lava<br/>
flowing cardboard volcano in the front herb garden by the front steps and ds<br/>
was hunting worms for his turtle during this time as well. Flexibility! Some<br/>
nights it&#39;s earlier to bed than others. Being flexible is so important.<br/>

How old are your kids?  Mine are 10 and 12.  Eventhough I got more down time at night, the night time routine was not really working for us.  It was a continuous battle.  I figured this was a true sign that something needed to change.  I think if things are going smoothly and kids see certain limits as comforting as opposed to controlling then there is no reason to change.  I think there are always signs if you just stop and look for them.  I&#39;m going to give it a little more time.  I probably just need to get used to the difference.  I am a person who likes routines and can be a little inflexible.  It is probably good for me to work on this part of my personality.<br/>

Our son has his own bed but crawls into ours in the middle of the night<br/>
whenever he feels like it. We have him in bed by 8pm and he listens to<br/>
stories on tape until he falls asleep, usually after about 1/2 hour.<br/>
Unless it&#39;s been a particularly active day, and then he goes to sleep<br/>
pretty much instantly. It works for us.<br/>

My kids are 11 and 6 1/2. I can SO relate with the night time thing being a<br/>
battle. There have been SO many nights that my husband and I have looked at<br/>
each other, after trying to get the kids to sleep at some ridiculous time,<br/>
say 8:30 or something and just said &quot;what the heck is wrong with us&quot;. It was<br/>
like we were putting unnecessary stress on ourselves. In the summer our<br/>
schedule totally changes. We are usually out in the garden or playing, or<br/>
drumming by the fire until at least 9:30.  The nights that we aren&#39;t may be<br/>
one of those nights that the kids go to bed early. When I say that a regimen<br/>
in the evening can be important, I am not talking about every single night.<br/>
I used to obsess like that, but not anymore. What I am basically talking<br/>
about it just quieting down. I know a woman that has put her son to bed at<br/>
7:30 every single night. I, for the life of me, do not understand that, and<br/>
my children would NEVER have that. I had to toss a lot of routines out the<br/>
window when we started homeschooling. That was about six years ago. I went<br/>
from one extreme, perfectly clean house, nice schedule, DINNER TIME, (yes, I<br/>
said dinner time), to either turning into a raging lunatic or just accepting<br/>
that our home is WELL USED and lived in, and loved. I can&#39;t remember when<br/>
the last time was I vacuumed two days in a row!<br/>
As far as routine, we have a few things that are routine. Stories before<br/>
bed(whether bed is at 9:00 or 11:30), quiet time for our son, etc.. I agree<br/>
on what you said about if things are going smoothly and certain limits are<br/>
okay with the kids as opposed to them feeling controlled, then there is no<br/>
reason to change. I think one of THE most important thing I have ever<br/>
learned during our homeschooling life is that our life always changes. There<br/>
may be a few months where we are basically hibernating and staying home a<br/>
lot, then-next thing you know, we are running all over the place several<br/>
times/week for different activities.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I were talking after we ate dinner last night, that it would<br/>
be possible to have quiet time to yourself even if the kids were up in a<br/>
larger house than ours (an most are larger than ours :-)  ) Our house is<br/>
quite small. Our son is 11, and I can see how when he is a little older his<br/>
demands and needs will be so different. I don&#39;t know what that is going to<br/>
bring, and it may bring me saying &quot;go to sleep when you feel like you need<br/>
to&quot; just as you are trying out. Things just change. When we find that things<br/>
we are trying to make happen are being met with a lot of resistance, we sit<br/>
back and re-evaluate what we are trying to do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling on and on here and I&#39;ve got to be out the door for a homeschool<br/>
meeting in 30 minutes and I have about 3 hours worth of things to do.<br/>
<br/>
Take care!<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the last time I vacuumed two MONTHS in a row!!!!!!!!!!  No,<br/>
my house isn&#39;t a huge pit---I&#39;m actually rather a clean freak when it comes<br/>
to clutter or filth, but I don&#39;t consider a vacuumed carpet a priority.  In<br/>
addition, my kids do virtually all the vacuuming as they make virtually all<br/>
the floor mess.  I don&#39;t believe, however, that I&#39;ve ever in my life<br/>
vacuumed two days in a row.  :-)<br/>

I used to vacuum twice a day! That&#39;s what I mean by being obsessive and<br/>
learning flexibility! That was back in about &#39;94 though. I&#39;ve come a long<br/>
way!<br/>
<br/>
I do need to get better about following through with making the kids pick up<br/>
things they&#39;ve got out before I start really feeling like Cinderella and get<br/>
angry.<br/>
