<div id="ygrps-yiv-644637605">I just read a nice &quot;unschooling&quot; picture book from the library called Amber<br/>
on the Mountain.  Amber is an only child away up in the mountains.  A<br/>
teacher comes for a while but can&#39;t handle the isolated life and leaves.<br/>
Then another girl comes with her parents on a road-building crew.  She<br/>
decides to teach Amber to read and write.  Amber starts reading but hasn&#39;t<br/>
started writing when Anna and her family leave.  Anna gives her the book,<br/>
and Amber works at learning to write, finally writing Anna a letter and<br/>
getting one back.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s still the idea of needing to be taught, but there&#39;s also the idea<br/>
that you can learn things on your own if you want to.  Anyway, it&#39;s a lovely<br/>
story, especially for a child who wants to read and write but is still<br/>
struggling with it.<br/>
