<br/>
       Ayn Rand calls this idea &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot; because in her <br/>
philosophy, choosing to help others is good for both parties (as opposed to <br/>
self-sacrifice) or else it wouldn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; and be such a big part of most <br/>
religions and philosophies. :)  JJ<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are kind to your neighbor, take her cookies when she moves in,<br/>
&gt; offer to watch her kids (if you like them) let her borrow stuff and have<br/>
&gt; her in for coffee, you are much more likely to get the same kind of<br/>
&gt; treatment from her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re mean and grumpy and complaining about her weeds, she might not<br/>
&gt; be so willing to overlook the fact that your dog barks at six AM and your<br/>
&gt; kids play noisily right outside her window when she&#39;s trying to watch her<br/>
&gt; favorite show and the old clunker you drive is an eyesore. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Being kind benefits us right now and makes life easier.  You are much<br/>
&gt; more likely to get help when you need it if you are known as someone who<br/>
&gt; offers help to others.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *** Put out all the negative energy you want, doesn&#39;t affect <br/>
&gt; life... ***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Harming others affects their lives.  And it affects the life of the<br/>
&gt; person who did the hurting.  If it was criminal he goes to jail.  It it<br/>
&gt; was just nasty others will know him for his actions and won&#39;t be as<br/>
&gt; willing to offer their friendship, help, or courtesy to him. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not even a reward or punishment you have to wait until you&#39;re dead<br/>
&gt; for.  It&#39;s a right now kind of thing.<br/>
