<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255439050"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think that is WONDERFUL, because when a friend of mine signed up for high<br/>
&gt; school here to play football, they wouldn&#39;t even let him take HISTORY.  They<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now that&#39;s dumb.  I&#39;d  think that schools would welcome homeschooled<br/>
students, both for the $$, and hoping that our kids would &quot;see the light&quot;<br/>

I truly do wish that the school here could manage to be a good experience.<br/>
But it&#39;s ranked 2nd from the bottom of DODDS schools worldwide, and the<br/>
biggest lesson Tim learned was that in school, they tell you to sit down and<br/>
be quiet a lot.  School prompted several interesting discussions about why<br/>
we do what we do!<br/>
