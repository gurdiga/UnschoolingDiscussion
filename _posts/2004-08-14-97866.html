<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085721381">Called this because that was all I had to write on at the moment that <br/>
these thoughts occurred to me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Every night at bath time, I become hyper-conscious of how much Charlotte <br/>
is learning (even though I know she is learning all day, at bath time <br/>
she is contained and more observable). Tonight she took two playschool <br/>
people and tried (successfully) to fit both of them in one hand. I guess <br/>
she got my long fingers! She would hold them for a moment then she would <br/>
allow first one then the other to drop into the tub and watch them float <br/>
around. After a few seconds, she would pick them both up again and pass <br/>
the one in her left hand to join the one in her right. Then 1, 2, they <br/>
got dropped in again and she watched them float around some more.<br/>
<br/>
It was almost like she was thinking, &quot;Okay, they floated this time when <br/>
I dropped them, but will they float next time?&quot; She did this over and <br/>
over, maybe 8 or 9 times, as if to say, &quot;They floated the first two <br/>
times, but will they float every single time?&quot; Very cool for me to watch <br/>
and very thought provoking.<br/>
<br/>
How is it that we understand so clearly when they are this age (14 <br/>
months) that they are learning just from &quot;hanging out&quot; in the bath tub, <br/>
but suddenly at age 6 we have to hand them over to someone else so that <br/>
they can continue to learn through lectures, worksheets, texbooks, <br/>
homework, tests?<br/>
<br/>
Of course learning is not the reason for putting her in the tub. It&#39;s <br/>
just a happy side effect. I put her in there because we had gone to the <br/>
Louisa agricultural fair and she had muddy knees. The fair was also <br/>
educational but again, not the reason why we went. We went to pet goats <br/>
and eat funnel cake, among other things. She just happened to learn that <br/>
a cow&#39;s moo is quite loud when you are standing right next to it. That <br/>
bunnies are soft. That music comes from people with instruments, not <br/>
just from stereo speakers.<br/>
<br/>
That funnel cake is good, but the lemonade that you were enjoying just a <br/>
minute ago has suddenly become too sour. That it&#39;s scary to reach out to <br/>
pet a goat from the front where the eyes and teeth are, but it&#39;s not <br/>
scary to pet a goat from the side. That mud is slippery. That pig <br/>
doo-doo smells really bad. That when your short legs get tired of <br/>
walking all you have to do is say &quot;Uppa&quot; and mama or grandma will <br/>
oblige, every time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just like when she gets older and we bake pies and cookies <br/>
together. We won&#39;t be doing it so that she can learn fractions, it will <br/>
just be another happy side effect of &quot;hanging out&quot; and having fun. I <br/>
just wish so much that *everyone* could come around and &quot;get it&quot; like we <br/>
do.<br/>

It is amazing, isn&#39;t it?  I think that&#39;s the key: to keep that wonder <br/>
and awe and amazement in all our children do intact. I think we&#39;re lucky <br/>
to have begun the unschooling journey so early (mine are now 7, 5 and 4 <br/>
and we&#39;ve been officially unschooling for 2 years and unofficially for a <br/>
lot longer than that!). I still look at every one of my children with <br/>
joy and wonder and awe. I love watching them play together from afar in <br/>
the same way that I used to love watching them figure out how to build a <br/>
block tower or watch their minds working as they dropped things <br/>
experimentally from the highchair or back of the couch. Lots of times I <br/>
feel like I&#39;m taking personal snapshots, just reveling in the moment, <br/>
watching them be, soaking in the freedom and joy of their play, and I <br/>
feel so full, you know? So lucky and privileged and perfect in that <br/>
moment of watching them.<br/>
<br/>
But then again, now that I think of it, there are plenty of folks here <br/>
in the Northeast who never even seem to have that when the kids are <br/>
young. Instead, they&#39;re always focused on who&#39;s turning over or walking <br/>
first, who&#39;s on what preschool list, how well their 2 year old does on <br/>
her entrance interview to the right school. It&#39;s truly sad and sick.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-980868198">You know, Danielle, if a person worked on keeping up this attitude in <br/>
themselves as their kids grow up, even into their teen years, they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t need any other unschooling advice!!!   I really mean that - I <br/>
think this is THE key to being a great unschooling parent. Can I quote <br/>
you in the unschooling talk I&#39;m giving next weekend?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think looking directly at your child and seeing his own amazing <br/>
progress through life from his first breath to the more complicated <br/>
stuff is what makes it moving.<br/>
<br/>
I think that comparing a child to a statistical average or a chart in <br/>
the baby book squashes the magic and makes these amazing developments <br/>
seem commonplace, because every baby does them.<br/>
<br/>
To see our own children, we have to look directly at them, not at other <br/>
kids, or at timetables or at college entrance requirements.<br/>
<br/>
As a brilliant man said &quot;comparisons are odious&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
It gives the child a pre-verbal start at being  gifted, or slow, or average.  <br/>
Gets his mom prepared for putting him in school where everything he does, <br/>
from arrival time to conduct to homework rates him as gifted, slow or average.<br/>
