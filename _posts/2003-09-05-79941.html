<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833292771">I am interested in this conversation as we have been exploring on our own different ways to help our 13 yr old.She has complex partial seizures, has motor challenges, anxiety and lately has developed little screams that seem involuntary. They have not happened often and when they have it has been in high stress, noisy, overwhelming situations. DD loves hard squeezes, trampoline bouncing repetively  and has learned to move when stress becomes to high. An interesting thing is that I read the Highly Sensitive Child and learned about the need for firm pressure, etc..At this point we have let go of needing a label and are happy to just learn other ways to help her in her journey of learning about herself and honouring that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488601546">When Rowan&#39;s tics started we kept asking her if she wanted a drink of water.<br/>
It took a week or so for us to realize she wasn&#39;t just getting a cold.<br/>
After the first week she started developing more and more vocal and motor<br/>
tics.  She has quite a collection now.  My personal favorite is when she<br/>
shouts &quot;hoozgenflutzky!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest concern is the related OCD.  She recently began to jump over a<br/>
spot of blue dye on our living room floor.  She told me one night she had to<br/>
or &quot;the world would come to an end&quot;.  She said it like it was no big deal,<br/>
but it tore my heart out.<br/>
<br/>
So far her tics have not affected any part of her life.  I&#39;m sorry Abba&#39;s<br/>
having such a hard time, Holly.  I think it&#39;s perfectly normal to mourn for<br/>
the easy life we wanted our kids to have.<br/>
<br/>
I have fibromyalgia, and I&#39;ve learned that when life gives you something bad<br/>
you often get something in return.  In my case it is patience and peace with<br/>
whatever comes my way, as well as a joy in the little things in life.  I&#39;m<br/>
interested to see what TS brings Rowan.  Already I think it&#39;s brought her a<br/>
wonderful sense of humor, and a tendency to look for the ridiculous in life.<br/>
<br/>
I have not looked into food allergies.  She&#39;s such a particular eater, I&#39;m<br/>
not sure she&#39;d go for any kind of changes.  How did those of you who changed<br/>
your children&#39;s diets go about it?  ~Rue<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m having a harder time than Abba. :-)  One thing I haven&#39;t <br/>
mentioned is how bad she was after the strep.  If she&#39;d have <br/>
continued like that we probably would have had to hospitalize her.  <br/>
She was totally out of control; banging her head, biting herself, <br/>
hitting and biting other people.  You couldn&#39;t hold her because her <br/>
arms and legs would fail around wildly and it was like she was having <br/>
a 24 hour tantrum, screaming and yelling at everyone.  I was so <br/>
afraid she&#39;d be like that forever.<br/>
<br/>
After that her tics were so bad that we had to give her codiene for <br/>
the pain.  Now she just needs a good massage from time to time and <br/>
we&#39;re doing yoga to stretch out the muscles.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, allergies are an immune system problem, but a little different than<br/>
autoimmune.  In allergies, the body sees certain harmless things coming into<br/>
the body as dangerous and reacts to that.  In autoimmune diseases, the body<br/>
actually sees part of itself as foreign and attacks it.  An example would be<br/>
the Hashimoto&#39;s thyroid disease that I have.  My body sees my thyroid as<br/>
foreign and attacks it.  I probably have almost no thyroid at all by now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623992128">Hi Holly, I&#39;m new to this group, but wanted to jump in here.  My twin sons (age 11) have mild TS.  It&#39;s not anything I&#39;m terribly concerned about (I went to one pediatric neurologist who did all kinds of tests, including sleep deprived eeg, video taped sleep deprived eeg&#39;s, etc...) and suggested medication.  We refused, then went to another pediatric neurologist about a year later when the nature of the tics changed (from shoulder shrugging and sniffing, to hitting themselves (not violently) in the stomach.  He (bless his heart) told me to go home and never come back (with a grin).  He said he wouldn&#39;t DREAM of putting them on meds with the mild degrees of tics they were displaying and told me not to worry about it.  I appreciated his relaxed nature and his not pushing the meds issue, but the tics do sometimes get a little embarassing for the boys.  So the idea of eliminating dairy for a month or so, and then seeing what happens, is very appealing (and simple and drug free!)  So thanks!  I look forward to hearing from others who are dealing with this, especially those who have kids whose TS is not that severe. So a TS unschooling list would be great.  <br/>
<br/>
And my heart goes out to those who are dealing with this in a much more consuming way.  My youngest son is a severe stutterer, and that gets much more of my attention, and can be very heartwrenching for all of us.   An yet, compared to other challenges so many kids and parents deal with, well, I&#39;m still grateful that this is his only struggle!  <br/>
<br/>
Look forward to hearing from others....<br/>

  Abba&#39;s TS definitely has an autoimmune componenet and isn&#39;t that what <br/>
  allergies are?<br/>
<br/>
  The<br/>
  &gt; reason I ask is because my son, Connor has severe food allergies.  <br/>
  Before we<br/>
  &gt; found this out, he had tics all the time, he was angry, nobody <br/>
  could touch<br/>
  &gt; him without him coming unglued.  Now that he doesn&#39;t eat the <br/>
  allergic foods,<br/>
  &gt; all this has gone away.  <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;d love to hear more about his.  One of the thngs we&#39;ll be trying <br/>
  soon is homeopathy.  I don&#39;t know if it will help but too many people <br/>
  have offered their services and I can&#39;t see how it could hurt. I <br/>
  really do think it would be great to have a TS unschooling list to <br/>
  talk about things like this at length.  If anybody is interested let <br/>
  me know privately and I&#39;ll set one up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448308866">It was just another email for TS parents.  I had a few questions and <br/>
posed them there but didn&#39;t find much info or any support.  These <br/>
parents were just so mortified that their children might exhibit any <br/>
symptoms of TS even in the home.  Of course, that&#39;s the way it is <br/>
with so many parents today, TS or not.  They tend to put the norm <br/>
first and the child second.<br/>
<br/>
Abnormal should have been in quotes.  It&#39;s perfectly normal for Abba <br/>
to shout out at times and we just go with it.  Last Friday we went to <br/>
the Friends Meeting House to see an art installation.  The room was <br/>
all hard surfaces and very echo-y.  Everyone- all adults but my kids- <br/>
was sitting absolutely silent staring at the ceiling and Abba shouted <br/>
out &quot;HOO&quot;.  Everyone was kind of jarred at first but I looked down at <br/>
her and just started laughing.  The look of dread left her face, she <br/>
laughed and everyone then found it ammusing.  Had I been embarassed, <br/>
it just would have made her feel bad and left everyone else feeling <br/>
disturbed.<br/>

it was so bad in the beginning and quite sudden- literaly over <br/>
night.  We had self-diagnosed though and actually had to tell the Dr. <br/>
about PANDAS.  We&#39;ve just met another child with PANDAS and they have <br/>
her on constant antibiotics so she doesn&#39;t get strep.  I just can&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;but my personal irritation is when people say<br/>
&gt; &quot;Then she has to go to specialists,&quot; or &quot;Special school!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; **I agree.  At this point we&#39;ve decided not to even take Rowan to the dr.<br/>
&gt; We know it&#39;s TS and we know that we don&#39;t want to medicate her, so there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; no point in taking her and making her feel that there&#39;s something &#39;wrong&#39;<br/>
&gt; with her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As of now she accepts herself just the way she is.  We just do whatever we<br/>
&gt; can to support that (starting with loving her just the way she is and<br/>
&gt; joining her in a rousing shout of hoozgenflutzky when the mood strikes<br/>
&gt; :0) ).   ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-982442919">Hi Holly,<br/>
Here is a brief definition of a constitutional remedy. A Constitutional remedy is very specific to the patient is theoretically will get the body back in balance on all levels. If you have a cold or something like that, the remedy would work specifically on the cold symptoms, whereas the constitutional would be working on the whole person. Not sure if that makes sense or not. I am currently reading the book called The Impossible Cure. It is the story of a mother who cured her son&#39;s autism with homeopathy. Very interesting. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.labriyut.com/constitutional.htm">http://www.labriyut.com/constitutional.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
Also, if you do not have access to a Classical Homeopathic doctor, I can recommend one that is on line that I am currently using, and I know several people that are using them. <br/>
 <br/>
Take care,<br/>
Amie <br/>
