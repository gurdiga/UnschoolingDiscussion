<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Immature, inconsistant, and manipulative are very common traits in<br/>
teenagers. So far, I have had 3 teenagers, 2 of which have passed the age of<br/>
16, and all have had those traits. My oldest 2 were public schooled all the<br/>
way through graduation, and displayed those traits quite a bit still at the<br/>
age of 16. They are both much better now. Child number three is almost 14<br/>
and wants us to kick him out of the house so he can have an excuse to live<br/>
on his own! He has been homeschooled fulltime since the second quarter of<br/>
7th grade. Before that, part time from the last quarter of 6th grade. My<br/>
youngest ds, now 11, has been homeschooled fulltime since the last quarter<br/>
of 3rd grade. In many ways he is much more mature than the others were at<br/>
his age; in other ways he is more immature. So, each child is different.<br/>
But there are usually many similarities among children of the same age<br/>
range.<br/>
