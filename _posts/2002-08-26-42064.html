<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952150163">I refuse to argue or justify any of our family decisions with anybody.  I<br/>
will gladly discuss.  I will gladly answer real questions.  I refuse to<br/>
justify.<br/>
<br/>
And I say as much flat out to anybody who decides they know my kids better<br/>
than dh and I do.<br/>
