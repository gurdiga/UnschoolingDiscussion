<div id="ygrps-yiv-798224721">I came into the living room when Hayden, 6, had a stack of papers (oh 300 or<br/>
so sheets of scrap printer paper) in front of the fan and a HUGE grin on his<br/>
face.  I *had* to grin back (though the voices in my head were loud,<br/>
insisting I interrogate him) and that grin gave me this:<br/>
H: I spilled my pop and I cleaned it all up and now I&#39;m gonna dry these<br/>
papers!<br/>
He proceeded to turn the fan on at various speeds, gleeful as the papers<br/>
filled the air!<br/>
H: Careful mama, you might get a papercut from the flying papers!<br/>
STILL WITH THE GRIN! and not a word from me, a pure love moment, I let him<br/>
have it!<br/>
<br/>
I got up this morning and ignored the papers all over the ding dang house...<br/>
no I didn&#39;t, I silently grumbled about them... THEN I remembered my boy&#39;s<br/>
shining face last night :)  Picking up every paper encouraged me to relive<br/>
every drop of joy he felt watching them sail thru the air.  Now they&#39;re all<br/>
neatly stacked, a bit more brown than yesterday, completely ready for the<br/>
next project they&#39;re called upon for... and my heart is filled with joy!<br/>
