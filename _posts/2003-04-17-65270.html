&gt; said that she wouldn&#39;t do it again. We asked if Jaiden had been <br/>

Try not to worry. Your kids still are free to explore and discover what path <br/>
is right for them. I think you can start by talking to your kids about your <br/>
mom, and explain that she has very strong beliefs in Jesus, and that&#39;s why it <br/>
was so important to her to share them with him. Tell them that you and your <br/>
husband have different beliefs from her, and even from one another, and that <br/>
people all over the world have even more beliefs. Some people look to a God <br/>
or Goddess, and others to science, or teachings of really wise people. In <br/>
fact, some people don&#39;t even think that Jesus was God, but a really wise <br/>
teacher himself.<br/>
<br/>
All of this is just ways that people have to try to make sense of the world <br/>
and their place in it, and we tell stories and explore, and find the things <br/>
that make sense to us all. <br/>
<br/>
Then ask him what HE thinks. Tell him you&#39;re around if he wants to ask <br/>
questions, or if he&#39;d like to hear some of the stories that people have told <br/>
over time. <br/>
<br/>
I understand why you&#39;re so upset with your mom, but this doesn&#39;t have to be a <br/>
bad thing. You&#39;ll just have to keep stressing that these are her BELIEFS, not <br/>
facts, and that he&#39;ll develop his own beliefs.<br/>

Tell your son that sometimes when people believe things really, really hard <br/>
that it makes it impossible to see other ways of looking at things. <br/>
<br/>
As far as your mother is concerned: I&#39;m having trouble right now not just <br/>
offering to go to her and slap her around a bit myself. What a trluy shitty <br/>

Thinggs are a lot better today, we all had a long chat and, I hope, got everything sorted out. This is the way that we had planned on approaching, from the begining. My mom just threw us for a loop.<br/>
