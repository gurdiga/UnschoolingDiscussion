<div id="ygrps-yiv-178741104"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Here&#39;s a call for help.  My 9-year-old is a very gifted pianist<br/>
&gt; (unlike my 11-year-old, she is not particularly gifted<br/>
&gt; intellectually.)  She can sightread Mozart, Bach, Gershwin, whatever<br/>
&gt; we (or her teacher puts in front of her.)  She understands key<br/>
&gt; signatures, rhythms, accidentals, etc. and uses them fluently in her<br/>
&gt; playing, but retains virtually none of this theoretical information<br/>
&gt; off the keyboard. (which frustrates her some when she wants to have<br/>
&gt; conversations about it.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, being that she loves the computer almost as much as the piano, she<br/>
asked us to look for a computer program that deals with music theory.<br/>
Anyone have any experience in this realm?<br/>
<br/>
Help appreciated. Thanks!<br/>

&gt; I will ask the teachers at the music school where the boys go.  A lot<br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; teachers are in school themselves, and probably know some good ones.<br/>
&gt; It will<br/>
&gt; probably be Tuesday before I can find out as their next band is Mon.<br/>
&gt; night.<br/>
