&lt;&lt; Basically, anywhere in public, where folks would assume neglectful <br/>
parenting if they <br/>
saw the way your kid was dressed/smelled.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;People will think I&#39;m a bad mom if you wear a dirty shirt, so <br/>
please change.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Just out of curiousity.. what would you have done if he didnt change his <br/>
shirt?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t happen.  If he asked me to do something for him, I would do it.  <br/>
Because of that, when I ask him to do something for me, he does it, or he <br/>
convinces me why it&#39;s not a good idea.   Because I really listen to them, they <br/>
really listent to me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  You are lucky that your boys <br/>
changed/showered/cleaned up when you gently suggested it.  I don&#39;t think it <br/>
is the same as what some folks here are experiencing.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The relationship I have developed with my children is the reason unschooling <br/>
works, and it&#39;s the reason they don&#39;t watch TV all the time--we don&#39;t have a <br/>
homelife they need to escape from.  It&#39;s the reason they don&#39;t eat all the <br/>
time--they don&#39;t need food to feel comforted.  It&#39;s the reason all the things we <br/>
talk about work, because of the respect we have shown our children.<br/>
<br/>
I know parents whose reminders to their children take the form of shaming, or <br/>
making fun of them, or downright insulting them.  If a mother gives an <br/>
ultimatum like &quot;We&#39;re not leaving this house until you take a shower,&quot; they&#39;re <br/>
talking about MUCH more than a shower.  They&#39;re saying the child has the power to <br/>
ruin the day.  They&#39;re saying the mother MUST have her way.  They&#39;re saying the <br/>
child is small and stinky.   How, in that situation, can the child feel big <br/>
or right or kind or good?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And, yes, Im sure many of them need some gentle guidance <br/>
and reminders to shower and freshen up.. but we are talking about resisting <br/>
hygiene all together. If that were the case, what would you do?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that is what we are talking about.   But then again, I never <br/>
&quot;taught hygiene&quot; to my children.  They picked the word up elsewhere.  Just as <br/>
I  never used the term &quot;education&quot; so they couldn&#39;t resist it, and I didn&#39;t <br/>
use the term &quot;mathematics,&quot; so they couldn&#39;t reject it, there is no category of <br/>
life called &quot;hygiene&quot; that they reject.<br/>
<br/>
There are many things we do, but they&#39;re separate and not categorized <br/>
together.  Laundry, taking out trash, brushing teeth, having good soap and shampoo in <br/>
each shower, having clean towels, changing bedsheets (which happens rarely <br/>
with Kirby&#39;s bed but more often with the other two who don&#39;t use their beds for <br/>
storage areas)--those things are done because it feels good to have clean <br/>
teeth, to smell clean sheets, to be able to throw something in the trash from a <br/>
distance without it bouncing back out, etc.  Individual things, individual good <br/>
reasons.   <br/>
<br/>
Why would they reject what feels good to them?<br/>
<br/>
But we all know why a child who feels powerless and beat down will reject <br/>
what his mother wants him to do, especially if it&#39;s the twelfth thing that day <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;making him do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I know that I always gently suggest some &quot;hygiene&quot; .. several times.. <br/>
before I get to the insisting..  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you&#39;ve set up a situation where you&#39;re going to be the winner and <br/>
he&#39;s going to be the loser.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought about this a lot, even before I had my own children, when I was <br/>
raising others and when I was teaching, when I looked at my friends who lied <br/>
and rebelled (I didn&#39;t) and at those who didn&#39;t lie, who were comfortable in <br/>
their own homes.<br/>

You don&#39;t start with forcing them to shower and then building a better <br/>
relationship after you&#39;ve broken their will.  You start building a better <br/>
relationship so they will think showers are fun and that being nice to mom is natural.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284551707">Yep. Exactly so. <br/>
<br/>
       The way Sandra put this reminded me of a counseling session I had with <br/>
a sports psychologist last year. I was working on my &quot;head game&quot; and looking <br/>
for ways to focus and better shut out distractions during play. <br/>
<br/>
       He said I didn&#39;t need more focus because I was already OVER-focusing, <br/>
which is why I could barely tolerate any disturbance. He suggested a sort of <br/>
self-hypnosis technique I could use during play involving phrases I would focus <br/>
on, like &quot;cool head&quot; or &quot;warm heart&quot; -- anyway, as he had me close my eyes <br/>
and began to teach me the technique, I was greatly amused to note that the first <br/>
(well-modulated) words out of his professional mouth were, &quot;Only if you want <br/>
to, and whenever you feel like it, you can ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       I asked him about this later, and he explained that the main problem <br/>
with helping people who feel like they can or should do things well, is <br/>
overcoming their well-developed resistance to any interference, even if it&#39;s really <br/>
just &quot;help&quot; and even if it&#39;s coming from people who love them, even sometimes <br/>
when it comes from voices in their own heads! <br/>
<br/>
       So what works is if every time, you start by sort of verbally showing <br/>
your belly in a  submissive way, making it clear that there&#39;s no reason for <br/>
resistance to rise. Then the message can get through in a win-win way. If you <br/>
start off by making it a directive, even a positive one, resistance is <br/>
subconsciously aroused.<br/>
<br/>
       I never used the specific sports technique he was trying to teach me <br/>
but I do have a new way of getting through (even to myself!) now. Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
just the strange way my mind works, but it seems to me like another way of <br/>
expressing the effect Sandra describes below. JJ<br/>
