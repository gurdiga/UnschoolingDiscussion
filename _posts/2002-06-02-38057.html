<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080287983">Ren - the term for the distinction you draw is &quot;people first&quot;<br/>
language.  With full awareness of the fire storm any labeling<br/>
discussion can generate, I offer you the term, because it is<br/>
helpful in distinguishing between folks who are disability aware<br/>
and those who are less attuned to that culture.  The only group<br/>
of people with disabilities (PWD&#39;s) that actively rejects people<br/>
first language is the Deaf community, which contends that they<br/>
have a culture, not a disability.  Some of the pity parties, like<br/>
the telethons, do not use people first language, but they don&#39;t<br/>
reject it.<br/>

disabilities.<br/>
| My writer friend, Marsha, would be offended if you told her she<br/>
was disabled,<br/>

| She lives with disabilities, to say she&#39;s disabled implies her<br/>
whole being.<br/>
| She writes beautifully and leads a full, rich life.<br/>
| OTOH, I suppose an unhappy person could be labeled disabled.<br/>
