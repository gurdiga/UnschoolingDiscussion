<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767549338">I began the year with a program for the first term, chore charts on the<br/>
wall, set bedtime and life was...organized! My boys were unhappy every<br/>
morning and Mia was kept busy with something while we did our work.<br/>
<br/>
Ten months later, the chore chart disappeared a long time ago and bedtime is<br/>
when the boys are tired usually around 10pm after a movie or a good story or<br/>
playing with Dad on the couch or for Mia when she asks to be put to bed. The<br/>
kids spend their days doing just what they want to do and Mia is free to be<br/>
with me as much as she likes.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I got angry about something and I yelled at one of the kids. I<br/>
shocked myself!! It sounded so horrible not to mention unnecessary. And<br/>
weird. I realized it sounded weird because it isn&#39;t something I do very<br/>
often and although I felt bad for yelling, it felt good to know that it was<br/>
the first time in a long time.<br/>
<br/>
A typical day?  Yesterday we were all up at about 8:30 and the kids watched<br/>
a couple of Magic School Bus videos while they had breakfast. The boys rode<br/>
their bikes for awhile then came inside and put Harry Potter and the Order<br/>
of the Phoenix on (CD). Jess played on the computer while Jacob and Mia drew<br/>
arrows on small pieces of paper and played treasure hunts.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch the boys played with their lego and Mia got out the peg boards.<br/>
Then outside to play Lord of the Rings. They have been watching the movies<br/>
over the last few nights.<br/>
<br/>
Later on we made ooblik. The kitchen cupboards turned blue and it was<br/>
everywhere but they loved playing with it. Mark came home from work and the<br/>
next hour was spent with him and the boys playing air guitar to extremely<br/>
loud music (with blue hands &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My brother and sister came over at 8pm to watch The Two Towers. Mark went to<br/>
bed with Mia to tell crazy stories and the boys sat up to watch the movie<br/>
with us. They loved it!!! This morning they are outside pretending to be<br/>
Aragorn and Gollum. I&#39;m not sure who Mia is, she has a scarf tied around her<br/>
waist with a cardboard dagger tucked into it.<br/>
<br/>
Last Friday we had an Every Other Day party. The kids hadn&#39;t had birthday<br/>
parties this year so we threw a party for the sake of it. It was fancy<br/>
dress. We had dragons and unicorns, princesses and indians. Jess was a<br/>
knight, Jacob was darth maul (he looked awesome) and Mia was a woodland<br/>
fairy with a dagger (can you tell she has older brothers?)<br/>
<br/>
I love bringing joy into my kids lives. And it&#39;s contagious because they<br/>
love to do the same for me.<br/>
Mary is right. Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This sounds wonderful.  Thank you for sharing.  It does bring up another <br/>
question that I&#39;ve been bouncing around in my head for a while, though, so I think <br/>
I&#39;ll go ahead and ask, although I have a sense that it has been dealt with <br/>
before here.  It has to do with TV and bedtime restrictions.  I have read many <br/>
of the links on www.SandraDodd.com and I am understanding how TV, video games, <br/>
etc. are &quot;information dense&quot; (love that perspective) and very much part of the <br/>
unschooly-being-in-the-world genius.  My question -- do most of you have no <br/>
restrictions as far as age-appropriateness and/or time spent watching TV?  And <br/>
do you have concerns about the corporate/advertising influence on your kids -- <br/>
if so, how do you handle that?  I think I can work toward trusting him, <br/>
knowing he will choose content that he finds compelling and therefore is not <br/>
&quot;trash&quot; (even Power Rangers -- that&#39;s a new one for us and my ex-teacher self is <br/>
silently struggling with that), but are there any pitfalls with that attitude <br/>
that I need to be aware of? <br/>
<br/>
As far as bedtime goes, do most of you just let your kids sleep when they&#39;re <br/>
tired?  (Gee, it sounds so sensible when I put it that way. &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s a <br/>
beautiful night and I love the idea of Fisher being able to enjoy it with me (I&#39;m a <br/>
night walker) . . . but I also get kind of an icky feeling when we get in the <br/>
habit of sleeping late in the morning.  I hate to miss the beautiful early <br/>
morning hours, and I guess years of socialization has taught me to feel lazy <br/>
when I (or my son) sleep in.<br/>
<br/>
In other news  -- I&#39;m reading John Holt&#39;s Instead of Education (I just <br/>
instinctively like him) and Fisher told me how he was unfairly punished today in <br/>
school -- I don&#39;t like that he was unhappy, but I might like where that <br/>
unhappiness could lead . . . &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Peace, and TIA,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071458708">&lt;&lt; My question -- do most of you have no  restrictions as far as<br/>
age-appropriateness and/or time spent watching TV?  &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids had huge restrictions with the TV last year. They were not allowed<br/>
to watch during the week  and only on the weekends after their chores were<br/>
done. Even then they were not allowed to watch &#39;just anything&#39;. And<br/>
especially not anything on &#39;commercial television&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after joining this group for the second time (the first time,I<br/>
lurked for a week and unsubbed in terror at the concepts being discussed<br/>
&lt;g&gt;), I lifted the restrictions on the amount my kids watched. They can<br/>
watch TV/videos whenever they want to.<br/>
<br/>
 Because they have been really sheltered we are still careful about what<br/>
they watch.  Both the boys watched the special features discs of the Lord of<br/>
the Rings movies to get a feel for the content and then watched certain<br/>
scenes before sitting down to watch the whole movie and we watched it with<br/>
them. We have shown Mia some of it but we have waited till she is in bed<br/>
before it goes on as some of it has scared her.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t watch much TV as our reception sucks! They might watch cartoons on<br/>
a Saturday but mostly they prefer to put a DVD on. We have been trying to<br/>
buy more so they have a good selection. They aren&#39;t overly interested in<br/>
adult type movies (all that yucky kissing!! eew, gross Mum!!)<br/>
<br/>
We probably are more restrictive than others here but I think it&#39;s easier to<br/>
adjust to lifted restriction if you do it gradually. Going from Thomas the<br/>
Tank Engine to The Terminator in one small step isn&#39;t being kind or careful!<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I &#39;m glad we have lightened up. We rented a Simpsons  DVD awhile ago and<br/>
Jess loved it. He went around doing the best Smithers impersonations for a<br/>
week afterwards. That wouldn&#39;t have happened a year ago.<br/>

<br/>
We LOVE the mute button, use it ALOT.  We tape stuff and pause during <br/>
commercials.  If I could afford TIVO, I would get it immediately.  We have fights <br/>
over music, I hate the stupid rapping Fred on a cereal commercial, Alex likes it, <br/>
so I got vetoed on that one the other day.  We both hate all Barbie <br/>
commercials!  And Bratz.  We had a good convo the other day when Alex asked me, &quot; Mom, <br/>
do all girls like shopping?&quot;  lol Oh boy! <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn likes a wide range of cartoons on channels with commercials, most<br/>
recently Kim Possible (Disney), Scooby Doo (Boom and Cartoon Network),<br/>
Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action (Disney) and perennial favorite, Max and<br/>
Ruby (Nick Jr.) which I really do not like much and am constantly<br/>
subverting with my remarks about why I don&#39;t like Ruby&#39;s behavior. We<br/>
also love Toad Patrol (Disney) but have now seen both seasons so often<br/>
we almost know the dialogue. On commercial free cable - Discovery Kids<br/>
and TLC, Jayn likes Hi-5 (a variety show), Brum, (about an English<br/>
miniature car), and the filler material about Pez the Penguin, who seems<br/>
to be a homeschooler, but I don&#39;t know if that is intentional.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the time we record onto our satellite receiver, similar to TiVo,<br/>
so we can zap through the commercials. I have to say we do that mostly<br/>
for my comfort. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of influenced to buy, yes Jayn sometimes sees toys that she<br/>
might not otherwise notice, and asks for them. However, my experience is<br/>
that often the desire is as transitory as the commercial, and when she<br/>
sees the item in the store, she decides against it. Not always though.<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
As for the other influence of corporate culture - I think we counteract<br/>
that over time with our open lifestyle. Jayn tends to believe things she<br/>
hears from living people much more readily. For example she never stated<br/>
that Barbie&#39;s were only for girls until she heard one mother say so, to<br/>
her not much more than toddler, son at Kay-Bee toys the other day. I<br/>
tell her that although they are mostly marketed to girls, anyone can<br/>
play with them, just like she has cars and legos. She visits all<br/>
sections of the toy store when we go, although the Barbie and Disney<br/>
aisles are her hands down favorites.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People only have influence over my children when they allow it.  I&#39;ve <br/>
helped my children to see the reasons behind ads.  Even my five year old <br/>
can state the reasons for media (influence, educate, entertain, I think, <br/>
they are asleep) and can articulate that the ads are definitely there to <br/>
influence your decision to buy something, to spend your money.  Lexie is <br/>
very savvy about the various ways advertisers have to attempt to get her <br/>
to purchase a product.  She&#39;s very much her own person.  She has a few <br/>
friends who are in school, and she laughs at how much they are <br/>
influenced by their peers and magazines, etc. to dress, behave, etc. in <br/>
a certain way.  She really makes her own decisions.  THat doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
she doesn&#39;t watch ads nor does she ignore them, but she looks at them <br/>
critically, which is how I look at them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have done what I do, they record shows and skim past the <br/>
commercials.  Or they like shows on commercial free tv. <br/>
<br/>
She was very interested in the recent california election, and watched <br/>
those ads closely.  She had nicknames for each one, some not very polite <br/>
(AS was the guy with the weird voice, Bustamonte was big butt (suggested <br/>
by my father, sadly), Davis was bald spot... She saw right through the <br/>
trash talk and wondered why they weren&#39;t discussing the real issues. <br/>
<br/>
I think the bottom line is we have to trust our children.  Your <br/>
questions come out of the idea that kids cannot be trusted to manage <br/>
their own lives, that if allowed, they would do nothing but watch tv, <br/>
eat junk food, play video games, stay up all night and want to sleep all <br/>
day, that it is necessary that some adult, some person in control, <br/>
control them, keep them safe from themselves, from their wild ways.  I <br/>
really think nothing could be the farthest from the truth.  So often <br/>
kids are so controlled, they are controlled every minute of the day, <br/>
even their bathroom habits are controlled (in school, they must get <br/>
permission to go to the bathroom), so there is no doubt that these <br/>
children, when given some free time or some control over their lives, <br/>
end up doing things in excess instead of in moderation. <br/>
<br/>
Again, we have to trust the children.  To me this does not mean that I <br/>
stop parenting.  It just means that my job is more a facilitator, a <br/>
guide, a helper, not a controller.<br/>

phrased for me was, &quot;kids need structure, they need boundaries, they need to <br/>
know that there is an adult in charge and that the rules are firm.&quot;  I was <br/>
taught that kids, though they would rebel against it, liked having adults provide <br/>
their structure.  So I&#39;m exploring what this freedom looks like, and want to <br/>
have some ideas about that ahead of time so I can envision it a bit.  (And so <br/>
I don&#39;t freak out in the middle of it and start trying to restrict again. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Fisher and I have talked long ago about &quot;what ads are for,&quot; and though he <br/>
still likes to watch them and say &quot;we gotta get that&quot;, he understands.    <br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s a part of me that imagines the &quot;corporate guys&quot; in a meeting <br/>
room somewhere, writing up story lines for shows like the Power Rangers or <br/>
coming up with flashy-but-stupid toy ideas and congratulating themselves on how <br/>
well they&#39;re exploiting kids (yes, that&#39;s oversimplified but you get the <br/>
drift) -- and I just don&#39;t like to let them &quot;get away with it.&quot; &lt;g&gt;  I like to <br/>
fight corporatism at every turn -- but what I am seeing is that the better way to <br/>
fight it is to let my kids grow up knowing their own mind, and then they&#39;ll <br/>
never be a slave to advertising or anything else.<br/>
<br/>

evil.<br/>
<br/>
Not everything that&#39;s advertised is junk.  It&#39;s fun to talk about how the <br/>
advertisement is appealing to they viewer, though.  Car ads are fun for that.   <br/>
Soda ads and jeans.  Sometimes you can&#39;t even tell what an ad&#39;s going to be for <br/>
and it&#39;s fun to guess as a new ad unfolds.  <br/>
<br/>
Often my kids are doing something else during the ads.  Whatever they&#39;re <br/>

are doing or playing with the dog.  &quot;Mute&quot; on a remote control is a good <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996979722">&lt;&lt;Oh, that is too bad. I haven&#39;t seen the show (&#39;cause we don&#39;t have<br/>
cable -- preferring to get DSL instead) -- but I *love* the max and ruby<br/>
books.  Ruby is always a rule bound kinda kid, but Max always &quot;wins.&quot;<br/>
We just bought one where Max wants to eat ice-cream for breakfast, Ruby<br/>
says &quot;no, eat your cereal&quot;  -- so Max drives in his pedal car to<br/>
Grandma&#39;s where she say, &quot;oh, just the person I wanted to see, I bought<br/>
too much ice cream.&quot;  So max eats some and takes some home to Ruby for<br/>
breakfast. &gt;&gt;....&lt;&lt;Ruby in all her bossy glory&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes it these are the Rosemary Wells based characters. Ruby is basically<br/>
the parent figure in the absolute absence of anyone else in the house.<br/>
Yes Max &quot;wins&quot; sometimes - but it is awful that there has to be a<br/>
competition at all - and Ruby learns nothing from Max winning - she is<br/>
repeatedly shown up but never changes her thinking. I am irritated by<br/>
Ruby because she, in common with so many ordinary parents, constantly<br/>
quotes &quot;rules&quot; unthinkingly as in the above example - you can&#39;t have ice<br/>
cream for breakfast - and forces Max to become manipulative and sneaky.<br/>
He leaves the house without telling her where he is going and she has to<br/>
run all over looking for him. <br/>
<br/>
Ruby constantly rides absolutely roughshod over anything Max may be<br/>
engaged in with the attitude that only her concerns are important and<br/>
anything he is doing must give way, regardless of his stated desire to<br/>
keep doing his own activity. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Max, you can&#39;t play dumptrucks<br/>
just now. We need to have our beach party&quot;. When there is a problem she<br/>
always imposes her solution on him, without consultation. She treats him<br/>
like a toy, and often is hurtful to him, deliberately excluding him from<br/>
activities with her girlfriends. Now I believe that she should be free<br/>
to play with them without Max, but since there is no one else to<br/>
actually engage him or look after him, it just seems cruel. Grandma<br/>
never seems to actually take Max off for a while so Ruby can play - she<br/>
is just on his side it seems by her chance appearances.<br/>
<br/>
It bugs me that Max is old enough to go wandering off around the<br/>
neighborhood, and run Ruby&#39;s errands to the store, but is too young to<br/>
use scissors and glue - so not true in this house. In one episode we<br/>
discover that Ruby and Louise are seven. Personally I think that is too<br/>
young to have the sole responsibility for another youngster. Do you<br/>
realize that there is no bedroom in the house for parents? They only<br/>
exist in one picture on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
The Easter episode bugged me, because Max was virtually forced to become<br/>
a thief by Ruby&#39;s unreasonable competitive attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Ruby has a horror of dirt, interrupting anything for baths, cleaning and<br/>
tidying. She has no respect for Max&#39;s space, and practices food<br/>
restrictions with a vengeance.<br/>
<br/>
And probably most annoying of all, Ruby is a heinous little liar and<br/>
cheat. In almost every episode to do with Bunny Scouts, Ruby takes the<br/>
credit for some accidental action of Max&#39;s, even to the extent of<br/>
keeping her merit badge for knots which Max was entirely responsible<br/>
for. The badge is clearly visible on her sash in subsequent episodes,<br/>
and she couldn&#39;t tie a knot to save her life.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is not such a horrible example of pseudo-enlightened parenting<br/>
in the books, but I mostly hate the stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771896570">oh, that was fascinating to read.  yes, put like that, I can see why you dislike it. <br/>
<br/>
For us, I guess, we have always read them allegorically with Ruby being, I don&#39;t know, &quot;society&quot;? &quot;them&quot;  the &quot;rules&quot; whatever ----  and Max being us -- the enterprising little irrepressible spirit.  I&#39;d never thought about Ruby (or Max for that matter) as an actual child (or bunny lol). They are, to me, about the futility of the rule-bound life.  <br/>

  Subject: RE: [UnschoolingDiscussion] enjoying my kids<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Oh, that is too bad. I haven&#39;t seen the show (&#39;cause we don&#39;t have<br/>
  cable -- preferring to get DSL instead) -- but I *love* the max and ruby<br/>
  books.  Ruby is always a rule bound kinda kid, but Max always &quot;wins.&quot;<br/>
  We just bought one where Max wants to eat ice-cream for breakfast, Ruby<br/>
  says &quot;no, eat your cereal&quot;  -- so Max drives in his pedal car to<br/>
  Grandma&#39;s where she say, &quot;oh, just the person I wanted to see, I bought<br/>
  too much ice cream.&quot;  So max eats some and takes some home to Ruby for<br/>
  breakfast. &gt;&gt;....&lt;&lt;Ruby in all her bossy glory&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Yes it these are the Rosemary Wells based characters. Ruby is basically<br/>
  the parent figure in the absolute absence of anyone else in the house.<br/>
  Yes Max &quot;wins&quot; sometimes - but it is awful that there has to be a<br/>
  competition at all - and Ruby learns nothing from Max winning - she is<br/>
  repeatedly shown up but never changes her thinking. I am irritated by<br/>
  Ruby because she, in common with so many ordinary parents, constantly<br/>
  quotes &quot;rules&quot; unthinkingly as in the above example - you can&#39;t have ice<br/>
  cream for breakfast - and forces Max to become manipulative and sneaky.<br/>
  He leaves the house without telling her where he is going and she has to<br/>
  run all over looking for him. <br/>
<br/>
  Ruby constantly rides absolutely roughshod over anything Max may be<br/>
  engaged in with the attitude that only her concerns are important and<br/>
  anything he is doing must give way, regardless of his stated desire to<br/>
  keep doing his own activity. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Max, you can&#39;t play dumptrucks<br/>
  just now. We need to have our beach party&quot;. When there is a problem she<br/>
  always imposes her solution on him, without consultation. She treats him<br/>
  like a toy, and often is hurtful to him, deliberately excluding him from<br/>
  activities with her girlfriends. Now I believe that she should be free<br/>
  to play with them without Max, but since there is no one else to<br/>
  actually engage him or look after him, it just seems cruel. Grandma<br/>
  never seems to actually take Max off for a while so Ruby can play - she<br/>
  is just on his side it seems by her chance appearances.<br/>
<br/>
  It bugs me that Max is old enough to go wandering off around the<br/>
  neighborhood, and run Ruby&#39;s errands to the store, but is too young to<br/>
  use scissors and glue - so not true in this house. In one episode we<br/>
  discover that Ruby and Louise are seven. Personally I think that is too<br/>
  young to have the sole responsibility for another youngster. Do you<br/>
  realize that there is no bedroom in the house for parents? They only<br/>
  exist in one picture on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
  The Easter episode bugged me, because Max was virtually forced to become<br/>
  a thief by Ruby&#39;s unreasonable competitive attitude.<br/>
<br/>
  Ruby has a horror of dirt, interrupting anything for baths, cleaning and<br/>
  tidying. She has no respect for Max&#39;s space, and practices food<br/>
  restrictions with a vengeance.<br/>
<br/>
  And probably most annoying of all, Ruby is a heinous little liar and<br/>
  cheat. In almost every episode to do with Bunny Scouts, Ruby takes the<br/>
  credit for some accidental action of Max&#39;s, even to the extent of<br/>
  keeping her merit badge for knots which Max was entirely responsible<br/>
  for. The badge is clearly visible on her sash in subsequent episodes,<br/>
  and she couldn&#39;t tie a knot to save her life.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe it is not such a horrible example of pseudo-enlightened parenting<br/>
  in the books, but I mostly hate the stuff.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t watch it much, but Rug Rats bugged me, and there didn&#39;t seem to be <br/>
adults around.<br/>
<br/>
Muppet Babies only had the legs of &quot;Nanny&quot; once in a while, and then she&#39;d <br/>
leave again.<br/>
<br/>
But there seems to be a strong fantasy in kids to consider how they would <br/>
function without adults around, so it&#39;s understandable that they might be drawn <br/>
to shows that portray that, and also that they consider that even without <br/>
adults, one of the kids might take on the controlling role, and that some people, <br/>
even kids, will not be telling the truth all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I think those extended kids-only things are scary fantasies for some little <br/>
kids but still compelling.  And in some lives there ARE extended kids-only <br/>
sessions.  I remember a few in my childhood, playing out a little away from the <br/>
house (their house, mostly, was scarier) with cousins, and knowing my best <br/>
choice was to just deal with the cousins myself, because if I went to the house I <br/>
would find my mom and her sister (their mom) drunk and unpredictable.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yesterday Holly was watching Arthur (speaking of bunnies, and whatever &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
and was quite pleased to get a joke they had about a mystery series called &quot;The <br/>
Jolly Jollisters,&quot; clearly making fun of The Happy Hollisters for being lame <br/>
mysteries. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly had already decided the books were lame herself.<br/>
<br/>
Now I, at her age, devoured them.  As each came, I read it THAT DAY or got <br/>
pretty far into it the first day.<br/>
<br/>
But I was a kid desperate for input and escape.  Holly is more discerning, <br/>
and has better choices.<br/>
<br/>
But still it reinforced my theory that the reason for learning is to get <br/>
jokes, and so Holly merrily (happily, jollily) got a joke.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076504268">&lt;&lt;For us, I guess, we have always read them allegorically with Ruby<br/>
being, I don&#39;t know, &quot;society&quot;? &quot;them&quot;  the &quot;rules&quot; whatever ----  and<br/>
Max being us -- the enterprising little irrepressible spirit.  I&#39;d never<br/>
thought about Ruby (or Max for that matter) as an actual child (or bunny<br/>
lol). They are, to me, about the futility of the rule-bound life.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn definitely takes the characters at face value when watching the<br/>
cartoons. I like to point out some of Ruby&#39;s behavior and we often talk<br/>
about other ideas for solving the problem. Also sometimes we talk about<br/>
Max and his &quot;mischief face&quot;. Jayn has no siblings so perhaps that<br/>
creates a different experience. We love Grandma, and we also love how<br/>
despite everything, Max is always really kind to Ruby, giving her stuff<br/>
he wins etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645148794">&lt;&lt;Yeah, thats what I was thinking.. they are FICTIONAL characters.    I<br/>
can&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They are not fictional to Jayn, she talks about them as real people.<br/>
Just because characters are fictional doesn&#39;t mean they are without<br/>
social relevance. If we are going to look at the broader social<br/>
significance of Max and Ruby, the idea that life will be full of<br/>
rulebound people in authority over us, and that the way to deal with<br/>
them is a combination of miserable aquiescence and passive-aggressive<br/>
manipulations, is not the ideal message either. However the idea that<br/>
children are people with ideas, creativity and important activities is a<br/>
positive message.<br/>
<br/>
Dharma was at least home schooled, and probably unschooled. In an<br/>
episode about Greg&#39;s old high school, Dharma talks about learning about<br/>
geography and weather by hot air ballooning. However the charm of that<br/>
idea is then undercut when it turns out that her spaced-out father<br/>
couldn&#39;t work the balloon properly and they always ended up in the same<br/>
place every year.<br/>
<br/>
That network sitcom about the stay-at-home Dad which I can&#39;t remember<br/>
the name of, was partially about homeschoolers. I remember there was one<br/>
episode where the support group was meeting at the star&#39;s house - I only<br/>
saw a couple of eps. The uptight-school-at-homer&#39;s kid couldn&#39;t name the<br/>
capitals of states when pressed and hinted to, but the quiet relaxed<br/>
mom&#39;s kid was able to spell Tallahassee when everyone else had left the<br/>
room. That was still a skewed picture, and the show was axed after a<br/>
brief period, but I don&#39;t think it was because of the hs subplot. I<br/>
almost never watch family sitcoms, they irritate me too much - not<br/>
unlike Max and Ruby - I am always shouting at the screen, and annoying<br/>
dh with Unschooling based remarks. I have always preferred British<br/>
comedy anyway, of which there used to be tons in Australia.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-587833473">How does everyone handle a situation like this in terms of <br/>
discussing it with your children?  Do you allow them to watch and <br/>
not say anything or discuss it?  Do you not allow them to watch <br/>
certain shows that you find offensive?  We are going through this <br/>
right now as Keiran just mastered the art of changing the channel to <br/>
cartoon network.  I would not mind if he was making choices based on <br/>
what interested him, but it has sort of become ONLY cartoon <br/>
network.  Me and dh were fretting about it a bit with him watching <br/>
all the time.  I did realize today it was probably just a stage as <br/>
he has never had his own access to that channel.  It is just the <br/>
excitement of it which I am trying to keep in mind.  However, there <br/>
are certain shows that I would prefer he does not watch because of <br/>
the way the people treat eachother or characters are portrayed.  My <br/>
dh is trying to watch with him at night so that they can discuss it <br/>
but we certainly do not want to watch it 24/7.  He has had it off <br/>
the last few days so maybe he is getting over it.  But I am curious <br/>
what others so when there are shows you would prefer they do not <br/>
watch?<br/>

He just turned 5.  For the last few weeks he would go to the <br/>
playroom and have the TV running all day.  He sometimes plays while <br/>
he watches or sits right in front of it.  I am not a big fan of <br/>
cartoon network in general.  I actually prefer some of the japanese <br/>
shows because at least there is a moral to the story.  WE like Yu-go-<br/>
i-oh and Jackie Chan, but then again we all watch together because <br/>
it is at night and a calm time for us.   However, I don&#39;t like <br/>
Totally Spies for how it has to show the heroines as girly shoppers <br/>
(the valley girl stereotype).  My dh watched Ed, Ed, Eddy with him <br/>
and said the way in which some of the characters talked to eachother <br/>
showed alot of rudeness although I have not seen that one.  The <br/>
fairly oddparents really gets under my skin and that one we do not <br/>
allow because I think he is too young.  In general, I think I am <br/>
having difficulty seeing value in some of these shows.  I am <br/>
struggling with how much freedom to give.  IS he making an <br/>
intelligent choice or just staring like a dog foaming at the mouth  <br/>
watching shows that corporate america has put out there marketed to <br/>
little boys (harsh but how I feel. At this point I feel the only <br/>
reason he is watching is because it is on cartoon network.  I have <br/>
tried to discuss that just because it is on that channel does not <br/>
mean it is a good choice.  I am struggling with balancing that with <br/>
giving hime the freedom to make his own choices.  Now, I am getting <br/>
the run down on every toy out there, as if we don&#39;t have <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622315974">It depends, LOL.  If you are watching with your child, you can<br/>
gauge what to do, if you think about it.  If you are;t watching<br/>
with your child, be very hesitant to judge the impact of what<br/>
the child is thinking about the show.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I pause (we have PVR, like TiVo) and talk about the<br/>
choice just made or the comment offered. Other times she is so<br/>
into the show, that I saw simply &quot;let&#39;s talk about that later&quot;<br/>
or ignore it totally.   Other times, she is happily playing with<br/>
a doll while the offensive stuff is in the background and I<br/>
ignore it.<br/>
<br/>
There is no need to address every infraction of good sense you<br/>
see, but if you do address it naturally and in the context of<br/>
the other parts of life you are living, you will be heard, IMHO.<br/>
One of the things that works in our favor around here is the<br/>
fact we always have a story going.  It involves friends,<br/>
storybook characters, cartoons and so on and is very free form.<br/>
I tell a part; she tells a part; we negotiate disagreements over<br/>
the plot; we read as many &quot;choose your own adventures&quot; as<br/>
possible to refine how a story should be structured to reflect<br/>
what we think about the world (or what she thinks/what I think).<br/>
That story supports the analysis of TV shows as fodder for the<br/>
story that give great joy to our lives.<br/>

| &gt; &lt;&lt;Oh, that is too bad. I haven&#39;t seen the show (&#39;cause we<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
| have<br/>
| &gt; cable -- preferring to get DSL instead) -- but I *love* the<br/>
max<br/>
| and ruby<br/>
| &gt; books.  Ruby is always a rule bound kinda kid, but Max<br/>
| always &quot;wins.&quot;<br/>
| &gt; We just bought one where Max wants to eat ice-cream for<br/>
breakfast,<br/>
| Ruby<br/>
| &gt; says &quot;no, eat your cereal&quot;  -- so Max drives in his pedal<br/>
car to<br/>
| &gt; Grandma&#39;s where she say, &quot;oh, just the person I wanted to<br/>
see, I<br/>
| bought<br/>
| &gt; too much ice cream.&quot;  So max eats some and takes some home<br/>
to Ruby<br/>
| for<br/>
| &gt; breakfast. &gt;&gt;....&lt;&lt;Ruby in all her bossy glory&gt;&gt;<br/>
| &gt;<br/>
| &gt;<br/>
| &gt;<br/>
| &gt; Yes it these are the Rosemary Wells based characters. Ruby<br/>
is<br/>
| basically<br/>
| &gt; the parent figure in the absolute absence of anyone else in<br/>
the<br/>
| house.<br/>
| &gt; Yes Max &quot;wins&quot; sometimes - but it is awful that there has to<br/>
be a<br/>
| &gt; competition at all - and Ruby learns nothing from Max<br/>
winning -<br/>
| she is<br/>
| &gt; repeatedly shown up but never changes her thinking. I am<br/>
irritated<br/>
| by<br/>
| &gt; Ruby because she, in common with so many ordinary parents,<br/>
| constantly<br/>
| &gt; quotes &quot;rules&quot; unthinkingly as in the above example - you<br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
| have ice<br/>
| &gt; cream for breakfast - and forces Max to become manipulative<br/>
and<br/>
| sneaky.<br/>
| &gt; He leaves the house without telling her where he is going<br/>
and she<br/>
| has to<br/>
| &gt; run all over looking for him.<br/>
| &gt;<br/>
| &gt; Ruby constantly rides absolutely roughshod over anything Max<br/>
may be<br/>
| &gt; engaged in with the attitude that only her concerns are<br/>
important<br/>
| and<br/>
| &gt; anything he is doing must give way, regardless of his stated<br/>
| desire to<br/>
| &gt; keep doing his own activity. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Max, you can&#39;t play<br/>
| dumptrucks<br/>
| &gt; just now. We need to have our beach party&quot;. When there is a<br/>
| problem she<br/>
| &gt; always imposes her solution on him, without consultation.<br/>
She<br/>
| treats him<br/>
| &gt; like a toy, and often is hurtful to him, deliberately<br/>
excluding<br/>
| him from<br/>
| &gt; activities with her girlfriends. Now I believe that she<br/>
should be<br/>
| free<br/>
| &gt; to play with them without Max, but since there is no one<br/>
else to<br/>
| &gt; actually engage him or look after him, it just seems cruel.<br/>
Grandma<br/>
| &gt; never seems to actually take Max off for a while so Ruby can<br/>
play -<br/>
|  she<br/>
| &gt; is just on his side it seems by her chance appearances.<br/>
| &gt;<br/>
| &gt; It bugs me that Max is old enough to go wandering off around<br/>
the<br/>
| &gt; neighborhood, and run Ruby&#39;s errands to the store, but is<br/>
too<br/>
| young to<br/>
| &gt; use scissors and glue - so not true in this house. In one<br/>
episode<br/>
| we<br/>

Do you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602831969">Years ago I had issues with South Park and the Simpsons. I look at it this <br/>
way, I know my kids and they are fine people and simply dont act out shows or <br/>
repeat things that they dont hear me say.  <br/>
My 4 yr. old watches a cartoon channel at night time. At 11 or 12 there is a <br/>
show that is a cartoon but about sex and disrespecting women. That show <br/>
irritates me but its just not something she is interested in. <br/>
My oldest watches what he wants, he is 12. He wont watch sex scenes they <br/>
gross him out. <br/>
There are shows that yes sometimes I cringe about but I know that I have <br/>
needed to step in years since we began Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Children who are banned from certain shows or life events will eventually <br/>
seek them out just because. I recently witness a child from a religious family <br/>
knowingly banned from certain movies sneak it in at a friends. The Mom called <br/>
the other Mom, yelled at her and stated that they could not be friends because <br/>
of it. Its ridiculous how far a parent will go unknowing that they are only <br/>
imbedding the temptation in the child to violate the rules. Its a terrible cycle <br/>
and the child always gets the crappy end of the stick (literally)<br/>
<br/>

It will be more beneficial to your unschooling and your family if you either <br/>
try harder to see the value, or accept that occasionally a half hour of his <br/>
life will pass in which you couldn&#39;t see the value.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; IS he making an <br/>
<br/>
intelligent choice or just staring like a dog foaming at the mouth  <br/>
<br/>
watching shows that corporate america has put out there marketed to <br/>
<br/>
little boys&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As long as you think of your child as a dog foaming at the mouth, you&#39;re not <br/>
thinking much more highly of him than your &quot;corporate America&quot; idea.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of worrying about evil corporate America, why not just hang out <br/>
gently and sweetly with your son and see him as making intelligent choices?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;.LOL...now I will have to explain the concept of Zen and the <br/>
<br/>
Tao to him ;). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll probably learn more from the cartoons you&#39;re unable to watch .<br/>
<br/>
Zen principles do suggest that the same ideas and ideals exist in the most <br/>
unexpected forms, in all places and all times.  It&#39;s the spark of thought that <br/>
is the learning/growth/advancement, not the input that inspired the thought.<br/>

him?  In other words, why do you think he cares about what network he <br/>
is watching even if the show doesn&#39;t interest him?<br/>

And sometimes they watch Ed, Ed and Eddy.   Yes, there is disrespectful talk amongst them,  but your son isn&#39;t going to learn how to treat others from a tv show.  My son watches it sometimes,  sometimes its pretty funny,  I&#39;ve watched it with him.   I can&#39;t say that I really enjoy the show but his humor might be different than mine.     There is humor there,   and that&#39;s why he watches it,    to laugh.  He truly doesn&#39;t treat others the way Ed would (or Eddy) &lt;g&gt;.   <br/>
<br/>

As far as Fairly Oddparents,  we actually had an awesome talk about US History coming from that show.  We&#39;ve also had some really good talks about parent/children relationships from watching that show,  the parents in this show are pretty pathetic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we can get over our own judgemental thinking regarding certain shows and their values(in our eyes),  we will then be able to see why our children choose to watch them.   <br/>
<br/>
Couldn&#39;t some of it also be that he picks up on what you don&#39;t want him watching?    He&#39;s going to want to check those ones out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our family has been so much more peaceful and joyful since we&#39;ve allowed our children freedom.    They have amazed me in their choices and their wisdom.   I&#39;m sure yours will too.      We just have to allow it.  :)<br/>
