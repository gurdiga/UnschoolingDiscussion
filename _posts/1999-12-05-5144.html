<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122884707">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i was wondering if anyone had any idea what to include in a homemade<br/>
chemistry set.  my 4 year old is fascinated with making &#39;potions&#39; and<br/>
&#39;medicine&#39;.  most of his experiments are made in the kitchen with<br/>
spices, flour, and whatever is around or in the bathroom with lotions,<br/>
herbs (tinctures) and anything else i can part with (mixing often<br/>
happens, and the mixtures most definitely end up in the toilet).   but i<br/>
think he would really enjoy some chemical reactions (other then vinegar<br/>
and baking soda) but i&#39;m completely clueless in this area and would<br/>
welcome any thought on this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663341536">You might find the book Mudpies to Magnets and it&#39;s sequel, More Mudpies to<br/>
Magnets, a great addition to your tool kit.<br/>
<br/>
Petri dishes, test tubes, tweezers, corks, baking soda, ph test strips, iron<br/>
filings, measuring cups/spoons, measuring tape, baby food sized jars,<br/>
string, balloons<br/>
