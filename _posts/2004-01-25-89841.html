<div id="ygrps-yiv-753949045">I have little ones, who are getting pretty stir crazy with this cold. I don&#39;t remember whether Aimee was asking for strategies for the kids or for the moms. &gt;g&lt;<br/>
<br/>
(I forget where I posted what, so I may already have already talked about the big appliance boxes here. If so, sorry for the repetition.)<br/>
<br/>
We just got some big appliance boxes from Sears and turned them into a castles, but you could make any number of fun things (puppet theaters, space ships, troll caves). We painted them, cut them, taped them, etc. This has provided *loads* of indoor amusement time. I figure if I&#39;m lucky, the boxes will hold out as long as the cold weather. If not, we&#39;ll get new ones. Now that they&#39;re all done being painted, the kids have been playing in them, making forts to watch movies in, you name it.  They&#39;ve been a life saver for cold, winter days!<br/>

We went and froze our booties off at the Chinese New<br/>
Year&#39;s Parade, today.  But, hey, we were outta the<br/>

room. But we still brave the weather and go out no matter what. Even if <br/>
it is a 10 minute walk or sledding session. In the end, you just need <br/>
to get out.<br/>
