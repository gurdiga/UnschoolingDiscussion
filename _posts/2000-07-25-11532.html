Subject: I&#39;m Just A Mother<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m Just a Mother? Excuse Me???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A few months ago, when I was picking up the children at school,<br/>
&gt; Another mother I knew well rushed up to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Emily was fuming with indignation. &quot;Do you know what you and I are?&quot;<br/>
&gt; She demanded.  Before I could answer and I didn&#39;t really have one handy<br/>
&gt; -<br/>
&gt; She blurted out the reason for her question.  It seemed she had just<br/>
&gt; Returned from renewing her driver&#39;s license at The County Clerk&#39;s<br/>
&gt; office.<br/>
&gt; Asked by the woman recorder to state her occupation, Emily had<br/>
&gt; hesitated,<br/>
&gt; Uncertain how to classify herself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;What I mean is,&quot; explained the recorder, &quot;do you have a job, or are<br/>
&gt; you just a .....?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Of course I have a job,&quot; snapped Emily. &quot;I&#39;m a mother.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We don&#39;t list &#39;mother&#39; as an occupation. &quot;Housewife&#39; covers it,&quot;<br/>
&gt; said the recorder emphatically.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I forgot all about her story until one day I found myself in the same<br/>
&gt; situation, this time at our own Town Hall. The Clerk was obviously a<br/>
&gt; career  woman, poised, efficient, and possessed of a high-sounding<br/>
&gt; title like &quot;Official Interrogator&quot; or &quot;Town Registrar.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;And what is your occupation?&quot; she probed. What made me say it, I do<br/>
&gt; not know. The words simply popped out. &quot;I&#39;m a Research Associate in the<br/>
&gt; field of Child Development and Human Relations.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The clerk paused, ball-point pen frozen in midair, and  looked up as<br/>
&gt; though she had not heard right.  I repeated the title slowly,<br/>
&gt; emphasizing the most significant words. Then I stared with wonder as  my<br/>
&gt; pompous<br/>
&gt; pronouncement was written in bold, black ink on the official<br/>
&gt; questionnaire.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Might  I ask,&quot; said the clerk with new interest, &quot;just what you do in<br/>
&gt; your field?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Coolly, without any trace of fluster in my voice, I heard myself reply,<br/>
&gt; &quot;I  have a continuing program of research (what mother doesn&#39;t) in the<br/>
&gt; laboratory and in the field (normally I would have said indoors and<br/>
&gt; out).<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m working for my Masters (the whole darned family) and already<br/>
&gt; Have four  credits (all daughters). &quot;Of course, the job is one of the<br/>
&gt; most Demanding  in the humanities (any mother care to disagree?) and I<br/>
often<br/>
&gt; work 14 hours a day (24 is more like it).  But the job is more<br/>
&gt; challenging than most run-of-the-mill careers and the rewards are in<br/>
&gt; satisfaction rather than just money.&quot;  There was an increasing note of<br/>
&gt; respect in the clerk&#39;s<br/>
&gt; voice as she  completed the form, stood up, and personally ushered me to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; door.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up by my glamorous new career, I<br/>
&gt; Was greeted by my lab assistants - ages 13, 7, and 3.  Upstairs  I<br/>
&gt;  could Hear our new experimental model (6 months) in the child-development<br/>
&gt;  program, testing out a new vocal pattern.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I felt triumphant!  I had scored a beat on bureaucracy! And I had gone<br/>
&gt;  On the official records as someone more distinguished and indispensable<br/>
&gt;  To mankind than &quot;just another mother.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Motherhood...what a glorious career. Especially when there&#39;s a title on<br/>
&gt;  the door.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Send this to another Mother you know.  Whether a stay at home Mom or<br/>
&gt;  A career Mom, we should all carry this title.<br/>
