<div id="ygrps-yiv-267245578">My daughter, who is 3.5 years old, has made it clear it&#39;s important I only talk to her - not her father, not anyone on the phone - I limit phone conversations to maybe once a week or when she&#39;s playing with her father - not to people who work at stores when we are trying to buy things for the day - like art supplies or groceries, not to friends we run into when we are out and about. She would like to speak for me so I say what I want to say to only her and then she repeats what I say to the people who want to talk to me. She also doesn&#39;t like it when others speak to me. I&#39;m thinking this is her way of telling me she has a real need for connection and we spend a lot of time together just me and her, which I really enjoy and thankful of. I&#39;m just wondering if there is anything else I can do right now besides play with her and be with her because I would like to talk to others.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a need for control! Three is a typical age when kids  <br/>
realize how little power they have over the world.<br/>
<br/>
While it sounds like a fun game to play for a while, you&#39;ve given her  <br/>
more power than any person should have over another person! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Find a way to disengage from the game. Like &quot;I need to talk.&quot; ;-) It  <br/>
might be easier for her to accept if you make the statement about your  <br/>
needs rather than about what she can&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
And find ways she can be powerful in her life. Be more observant of  <br/>
what she needs you to do for her and find more ways she can do as much  <br/>
as she can herself. Get she get water or juice when she&#39;s thirsty? A  <br/>
snack drawer for when she&#39;s hungry. Clothes that are in reach. Step  <br/>
stool for light switches.<br/>

I would play with it in a joking way, as a game, when others aren&#39;t around, talking to stuffed animals or dolls or birds or the cat.  Let her practice seeing you talk to others, maybe.  And then in a serious way I would say &quot;That&#39;s how people live in the world.  I need to talk to others, and you can&#39;t decide that for me.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Joyce&#39;s ideas were good.  Give her other things to control, but not you.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could make silly, fun rules for each other as a game, and then say when the game is over.  Or play Simon Says, or follow the leader.  Doing a little more of what a child wants can be a way to satisfy and also extinguish (or at least examine) an odd behavior.<br/>
<br/>
This is only halfway parallel (?? so NOT parallel...) but Marty wanted potatoes, wanted French fries, one day, when he was middlin&#39; age, 12 or so, maybe?  (I&#39;ll look it up if I ever need to testify in court about it; I don&#39;t remember numbers but I take notes.)  I kept saying yes, in a while, sorry, soon, can&#39;t right now, sounds good.  Realizing I had put him off too long, I said let&#39;s go get French fries, and just the two of us went.  I said &quot;Let&#39;s see who has the best&quot; so kind of as a game, kind of as a joke, kind of to make up for stalling, we started going to fast food places and getting a small order of fries and going to the next place.  There were seven or eight places we could have gone, but after three or four, he wasn&#39;t hungry for fries anymore.  It was a big adventure and we laughed and didn&#39;t even have to drive over a couple of miles, and it would&#39;ve been easier for me to go when he first asked and get one large order, but there it was.<br/>
<br/>
So if you play with not talking, not sitting, not looking, not laughing dancing/notdancing (music on and off?) and things like that--making rules for another person, but making it light and fun--it might help.<br/>

<br/>
search &quot;dress up games for girls&quot;, add in &#39;potions&#39; and &#39;Sue&#39; and any other key words you want to relate to the games. Most of it is in a foreign language andI could barely figure them out, but she whizzed right through them. Tomorrow I will ask her what the rest of them are as she still has her games listed somewhere. Webkinz is cool too(if you buy a webkinz, she likes that alot as well. <br/>
