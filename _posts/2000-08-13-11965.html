<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060994646">My grateful thanks to everyone who replied to my SOS about the jammed bowls.<br/>
<br/>
 I tried almost all of the suggestions - several of them simultaneously! <br/>
Eventually, there was a somewhat ominous cracking, and - lo  and behold - the <br/>
dishes squelched apart. And even  lower and beholder, the ominous cracking <br/>
sound was apparently  quite unrelated related to the fabric of the bowls! <br/>
Chalk up a resounding success. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all again, very much!<br/>
Mattie</div>
