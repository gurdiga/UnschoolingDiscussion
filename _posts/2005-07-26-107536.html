<div id="ygrps-yiv-348995518">A fella by the name of Eric wrote me today to say that he has linked from one of my blogs to his blog -- I recently posted an unschooling article (not written by me, but another unschooling mom).  Anyway, he added his own commentary to the article and I thought I would share with all of you in case anyone wanted to leave a comment or two for him.  His main opinion is that children need some structure in learning and that children must learn certain critical skills -- I believe he mentions &quot;the gravitational rate of acceleration&quot; as one such skill.  Here&#39;s the link:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You made me laugh out loud! I&#39;ll tell you what the really good parts <br/>
were: when I was standing on the strut getting ready to jump and had <br/>
this wild sensation of speed and the most spectacular view of the <br/>
farmland below--and then after I jumped and my parachute had opened and <br/>
I got to just float for a couple of minutes before I had to start <br/>
worrying about landing. It makes me think being in a hot air balloon or <br/>
taking a ride in a glider would be really something--get that same <br/>
quiet floating sensation, with no risk of sprained ankles!<br/>
<br/>
I jumped out of an airplane back when I thought having &quot;a good life&quot; <br/>
meant having a list of spectacular things to do and checking them off <br/>
one-by-one; preferably things that would impress bystanders. I&#39;ve <br/>
evolved a bit since then.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nor paying big bucks to be towed to the top of a mountain, and jumping off <br/>
that device with waxed sticks fastened to one&#39;s shoes.     Skiing because you&#39;re <br/>
an arctic circle hunter or messenger and there&#39;s nothing out there but snow <br/>
is almost understandable (though &quot;move south&quot; would occur to me sooner).    <br/>
Downhill skiing seems like skydiving but there&#39;s a lot more opportunity to hit <br/>
the ground, or trees, or lift towers, or rocks, or people, or buildings...<br/>
<br/>
Some of my friends learned to ski through the ski club at school.   <br/>
