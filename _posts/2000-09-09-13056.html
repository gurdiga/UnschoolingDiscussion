<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134651600">All the talk of city/country living brought this question to mind.  When we <br/>
bought our condo, Zack was 3, Haley was still a year in the future.  We <br/>
figured we&#39;d be in it a couple of years, then move to a bigger place and rent <br/>
the condo out.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, that was before this whole homeschooling thing came up!  Now, we&#39;re a <br/>
one income family, and the condo mortgage is great!  Unfortunately, we have <br/>
no backyard, but we do have a small enclosed patio and a pool right down the <br/>
street.  I do miss the backyard, but we make do.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing.  Although there&#39;s an elementary school right next door, we <br/>
have virtually no kids in our 300 unit complex!  It&#39;s all older folks and <br/>
singles.  The very few families have older kids.<br/>
<br/>
We have a really active support group, and we have friends over often, but I <br/>
miss that neighborhood I grew up in where the kids were all in each other&#39;s <br/>
houses every day and all weekend.  I wonder if my kids are really missing <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
My friends with kids in school, who live in those neighborhoods with lots of <br/>
families, tell me that things are really different these days.  The kids are <br/>
of course in school all day, then they have sports and other after school <br/>
activities and then the weekends are full of soccer and baseball games.  So <br/>
the kids don&#39;t really see each anyway unless they go to school together.  <br/>
Lots of my homeschool friends have noticed this too.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wonder if your kids play with kids in the neighborhood or if they&#39;ve <br/>
experienced the same drought of local playmates.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-108599096">I don&#39;t know if the &#39;organised activities&#39; thing is quite so strong <br/>
over here yet, but here on our street the kids do play out when it&#39;s <br/>
fit (mine even when it&#39;s not fit, but then I don&#39;t tell &#39;em to come in <br/>
when it starts raining, I give &#39;em their coats, unlike some others...) <br/>
 I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s going to be like now that school&#39;s started <br/>
again, since quite a lot go to childminders or after-school &#39;clubs&#39; <br/>
until about 5pm when parents get home, then have tea and bath <br/>
and bed routine, so they might not have time to play out during the <br/>
week, but I think the weekends will still be the same.  We shall <br/>
see.<br/>
