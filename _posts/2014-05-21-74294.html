<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055854259"><div dir="ltr">A long time ago, probably almost 20 years ago, I read something that I thought of hundreds and hundreds of times since. Sandra described it here (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/badmoment">http://sandradodd.com/badmoment</a>):<br>

&quot;<span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Tahoma;">I had only been online a couple of years when someone on AOL wrote one of the best things ever, and it changed my life the moment I read it. She said she didn&#39;t think of a day as &quot;bad,&quot; as she didn&#39;t want to condemn or write off a whole day. She said she would just think &quot;I had a bad moment.&quot;&quot;<br>

<br>So I&#39;ve had this idea in my head nearly 20 years and have tried to pass it along to my kids.</span><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Tahoma;font-size:medium;"> <br></span><div><br></div><div>Rosie (23 years old) told me this last night:<div>

<br></div><div>A few days ago she had college finals and was stressed about that and then people kept flaking on plans they&#39;d made. She was feeling cranky and things just kept happening and she couldn&#39;t seem to shake a bad mood that lasted all day. Later she had a nice dinner with her fiance and had a great evening. <br>

<br>She said she was thinking about that day and suddenly the thought occured to her that that is what people must mean when they say &#39;I had a bad day.&#39; She realized she had never HAD one of those - never an entire &#39;bad day,&#39; just bad moments that she got over fairly quickly.  And then she thought about how she still hadn&#39;t really had an entire bad day because she&#39;d had a really nice evening.<br>

<br>It doesn&#39;t mean she hasn&#39;t experienced serious loss and tragedy because she has. She&#39;s talking about just the kind of &quot;this day sucks&quot; mood that people mean when they say, &quot;I&#39;m having a bad day.&quot;<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046571848">Thank you, Pam.  I&#39;m not currently having a &quot;bad moment,&quot; but I certainly have had my share over the years.  I read in the link where Su describes her son leaning into her and I just started bawling.  I&#39;m so thankful that my children experience life from more innocent eyes, as some of my moments have just been too overwhelming and &quot;bad&quot; in my eyes.  It&#39;s a good reminder to not harden myself and brace myself with the expectation of more &quot;bad&quot; as then I won&#39;t be soft enough to experience that child leaning into me.  And also, to look for the good and live in that moment, extend that moment to be a minute, an hour, a day, a lifetime.<br/>
