 </span></blockquote>We do too.  I hardley ever buy the little ones toys, and our place is still <br/>
overflowing with them.  The funny thing is, my 14 month old would rather play <br/>
with a string than any toys.  This year we are putting together a Christmas <br/>
wish list for everyone.  At the top of the list, we are saying we would <br/>
prefer &quot;no toys that require batteries&quot; and lots of books.  Although, we are <br/>
overflowing with those too.  My thoughts are, you can never have tooooo many <br/>
books.....hee hee hee<br/>
