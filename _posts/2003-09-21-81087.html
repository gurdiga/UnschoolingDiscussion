<div id="ygrps-yiv-757756163">I don&#39;t know if anyone listens to Clear Channel Radio but there is acall <br/>
to boycott them and their advertisers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Clear Channel radio station promotes driving into cyclists as fun<br/>

Clear Channel Communications radio station, G105 promotes driving into <br/>
cyclists as fun. (9/22-23/03).<br/>
<br/>
The Bob and Madison morning show on G105 out of Raleigh was going on for <br/>
awhile about how fun it is to run cyclists off of the roads, and how we <br/>
don&#39;t deserve to be there.<br/>
<br/>
One woman called in and said her Dad hit a cyclist on purpose on his way <br/>
to church one morning (very Christian of him) when she was 12 or <br/>
something. She said he just hated bikes being on the road. The intern <br/>
said there is an old man that lives in her neighborhood that shoots a <br/>
pellet gun at a group of 30 or so that ride by their house.she said. He <br/>
tries to hit their tires to make them crash.<br/>
<br/>
The host even joked of riding a motorcycle down said-proposed bike path <br/>
just to piss off bike riders.<br/>
<br/>
The hosts egged-on the listeners in support of physically hurting <br/>
cyclists as a way of telling us they don&#39;t want us on the road.<br/>
<br/>
The ending shot was Bob, the host, talking about carrying a bunch of <br/>
empty YooHoo bottles to pelt offending cyclists with. Once again, more <br/>
calls rained in from people who agreed with him, and said that they <br/>
would do the same. Clear Channel stations across the nation are <br/>
broadcasting almost criminal &quot;kill bicyclists&quot; verbiage by shock jocks. <br/>
The recent attacks occured on G105 in the NC Triangle market two days in <br/>
a row (9/22-23/03). This follows similar comments by shows in Houston <br/>
and Cleveland. Perhaps it is time to let Clear Channel know that these <br/>
actions will not be tolerated by the cycling community. I would suggest <br/>
contacting current advertisers, both local and national, until Clear <br/>
Channel adresses this problem. Some of the advertisers with G105 include <br/>
Toyota, US Cellular, Con Agra Foods, Applebees, and Kroger.<br/>
<br/>
This info was gathered from numerous posts on cycling forums and first <br/>
hand accounts of the broadcast. TMTB.com urges you to contact the <br/>
advertizers on the show, g105 and Clear Channel to politely voice your <br/>
opinion on the subject. They follow the money. If enough people write in <br/>
and let them know they are going to stop listening, stop going to the <br/>
companies that advertise; they might get the message.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-679412973">Killing them in order to save them: Bush may rewrite rules on endangered <br/>
animals<br/>
Posted on Saturday, October 11 @ 09:59:27 EDT<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001763582_animals110.html">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001763582_animals110.html</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is proposing far-reaching changes <br/>
to conservation policies that would allow hunters, circuses and the pet <br/>
industry to kill, capture and import animals on the brink of extinction <br/>
in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
Giving Americans access to endangered animals, officials with the <br/>
Department of Interior and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said, would <br/>
both feed the gigantic U.S. demand for live animals, skins, parts and <br/>
trophies, and generate profits that would allow poor nations to pay for <br/>
conservation of the remaining animals and their habitats.<br/>
<br/>
This and other proposals that pursue conservation through trade would, <br/>
for example, open the door for American trophy hunters to kill the <br/>
endangered straight-horned markhor, a wild goat, in Pakistan; license <br/>
the pet industry to import the blue fronted Amazon parrot from <br/>
Argentina; permit capture of endangered Asian elephants for U.S. <br/>
circuses and zoos; and partially resume international trade in African <br/>
ivory. No U.S. endangered species would be affected.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Conservation groups counter that killing or capturing even a few animals <br/>
is hardly the best way to protect endangered species, and say the <br/>
policies cater to individuals and businesses that profit from animal <br/>
exploitation.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s a very dangerous precedent to decide that wildlife exploitation is <br/>
in the best interest of wildlife,&quot; said Adam Roberts, a senior research <br/>
associate at the nonprofit Animal Welfare Institute, an advocacy group <br/>
for endangered species.<br/>
<br/>
The latest proposal involves an interpretation of the Endangered Species <br/>
Act that deviates radically from the course followed by Republican and <br/>
Democratic administrations since President Nixon signed the act in 1973. <br/>
The law established broad protection for endangered species, most of <br/>
which are not native to America, and effectively prohibited trade in them.<br/>
<br/>
Kenneth Stansell, assistant director for international affairs at Fish <br/>
and Wildlife, said there has been a growing realization that the <br/>
Endangered Species Act provides poor countries no incentive to protect <br/>
dying species. Allowing American hunters, circuses and the pet industry <br/>
to pay countries to take fixed numbers of animals from the wild would <br/>
pay for conservation programs for remaining animals, he said.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. officials note that such trade is open to hunters, pet importers <br/>
and zoos in other Western nations. They say the idea is supported by <br/>
poor countries that are home to the endangered species and would benefit <br/>
from the revenue.<br/>
<br/>
Officials at the Department of Interior and Fish and Wildlife, who are <br/>
leading many of the new policies, said the proposals merely implement <br/>
rarely used provisions in the law.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is absolutely consistent with the Endangered Species Act, as <br/>
written,&quot; said David Smith, deputy assistant secretary at the Department <br/>
of Interior for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. &quot;I think the nature of the <br/>
beast is such that there are critics who are going to claim some kind of <br/>
ulterior motive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Animal-welfare advocates question the logic of the new approach, saying <br/>
that foreign countries and groups that stand to profit will be in charge <br/>
of determining how many animals can be killed or captured. Advocates <br/>
also warn that opening the door to legal trade will allow poaching to <br/>
flourish.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As soon as you place a financial price on the head of wild animals, the <br/>
incentive is to kill the animal or capture them,&quot; Roberts said. &quot;The <br/>
minute people find out they can have an easier time killing, shipping <br/>
and profiting from wildlife, they will do so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The proposals also trigger a visceral response: To many animal lovers, <br/>
these species have emotional and symbolic value, and never should be <br/>
captured or killed.<br/>
<br/>
The Endangered Species Act prohibits removing domestic endangered <br/>
species from the wild. Until now, that protection was extended to <br/>
foreign species. Explaining the change, Stansell said, &quot;There is a <br/>
recognition that these sovereign nations have a different way of <br/>
managing their natural resources.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, many of the strongest advocates for &quot;sustainable-use&quot; programs <br/>
-- under which some animals are &quot;harvested&quot; to raise money to save the <br/>
rest -- have been countries that are home to various endangered species. <br/>
Foreign trade groups and governments have tried for years to convince <br/>
the United States that animals no longer are in limited supply, or that <br/>
capturing or killing fixed numbers would not drive a species to extinction.<br/>
<br/>
That could change after Friday, the end of the public-comment period on <br/>
one proposed change.<br/>
<br/>
John Monson, a New Hampshire trophy hunter and former chairman of that <br/>
state&#39;s Fish and Game Commission, said the program would help preserve <br/>
rare animals. Monson applied for a permit in 1999 to shoot and import a <br/>
straight-horned markhor. He was turned down.<br/>
<br/>
Monson is president-elect of Safari Club International, a national <br/>
hunting advocacy group. He agreed to an interview only in his personal <br/>
capacity.<br/>
<br/>
Safari Club International gave $274,000 to candidates during the 2000 <br/>
election cycle, 86 percent of it to Republicans. It also spent $5,445 <br/>
printing bumper stickers for the Bush presidential campaign. Monson has <br/>
made a variety of personal contributions, including $1,000 to the Bush <br/>
for President campaign.<br/>
<br/>
Teresa Telecky, former director of the wildlife trade program at the <br/>
Humane Society, blamed lobbying by Safari Club International and other <br/>
special-interest groups for a &quot;sea change&quot; in conservation policy. &quot;The <br/>
approach of this administration is it is all right to kill endangered or <br/>
threatened species or capture them from the wild so long as somebody <br/>
says there would be some conservation benefit,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
Stansell said conservation goals, not lobbying, drove the proposals, <br/>
which he said evolved through previous administrations.<br/>
<br/>
Still, the application of &quot;sustainable use&quot; never has been so broad. The <br/>
United States in November reversed its long-held position and voted to <br/>
allow Botswana, Namibia and South Africa to resume trade in ivory. <br/>
Stansell said the sales, which have not begun, will support elephant <br/>
conservation.<br/>
<br/>
But Susan Lieberman, former chief of the Scientific Authority at the <br/>
Fish and Wildlife Service and now director of the species program at the <br/>
World Wildlife Fund, said legal trade in ivory always triggers illegal <br/>
poaching. &quot;Money doesn&#39;t always mean conservation,&quot; she added. &quot;To me, <br/>
the theme is allowing an industry to write the rules, which is a Bush <br/>
administration pattern.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Smith, the administration official, said permits would be issued only <br/>
after foreign countries showed they had strong conservation programs. <br/>
&quot;There is nothing else we have as a country to force other countries to <br/>
conserve their wildlife, other than being paternalistic and saying &#39;no, <br/>
no, no,&#39; &quot; he said.<br/>
