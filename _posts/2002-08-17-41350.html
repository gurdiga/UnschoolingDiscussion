&gt; Subject: grown/teen unschoolers<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Question on how you unschool your teens in preparation for college.  I<br/>
&gt; know, I know, college is overrated and unnecessary in some people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; opinion (mine included) but I have a 14 yr old son who is thinking at<br/>
&gt; this moment that he wants to go.  I don&#39;t want him four years down the<br/>
&gt; road unprepared because of my inability to help him plan.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What can I be doing now, in a relaxed fashion, to help him?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Suzy<br/>

First, he can attend college right now. Community colleges are opening up to<br/>
homeschoolers all across the country.<br/>
<br/>
Next, get information from many colleges. Libraries have their catalogs;<br/>
talk to the librarians about those, and other ways they can help. They want<br/>
to help.<br/>
<br/>
Ask a guidance counsellor at the high school. Sometimes they will consult<br/>
with you (maybe for a fee since it&#39;s outside work). It&#39;s something they do<br/>
all day in the school and are familiar with the process of getting into<br/>
colleges.  Caution: Don&#39;t take anything they say as true. Check everything<br/>
out. <br/>
<br/>
Books that help people to prepare for the SAT are very useful, both for<br/>
taking the test and for showing what colleges expect kids to know, or at<br/>
least know about. The tests do not seem to rely on specific knowledge so<br/>
much as common sense and logic in the testing areas.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best preparations for college is work -- the kind that puts kids<br/>
in contact with lots of people and other employees. It&#39;s also good on a<br/>
resume. Colleges want students with the independence and initiative of a<br/>
homeschooler combined with the skills, patience, resilience, and<br/>
perseverance of a good employee. Employers can also provide letters of<br/>
recommendation for the next adventure, whatever it may be.<br/>
