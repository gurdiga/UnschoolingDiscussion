&gt;   Kristen<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kristen, that may be true for a kid who gets AN opportunity to stay up all <br/>
night or the rare opportunity to do so.  The truth is that I don&#39;t know all <br/>
the kids in the world, but has been my experience that when &#39;bedtime rules&#39; <br/>
is not an issue, there&#39;s no reason to ignore the sensations that cause a <br/>
kid to want to go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
In our house, there have never been any rules about when to go to bed.  My <br/>
now-8-year-old son really wants to go to bed when he gets sleepy, and he is <br/>
the one who makes that decision, nobody else.  Of course, if something is <br/>
going on that makes it more interesting to stay awake despite being tired, <br/>
then he will try to stay awake (I would, too), but that is a rare <br/>
occurrence, not the norm; when that guy gets tired, he craves going to <br/>
bed.  He sleeps as long as he needs to or wants to, and I am assured that <br/>
he is in tune with his own sleep needs because I have never interfered with <br/>
them.  If we are out somewhere, bed can be my arms or someone&#39;s sofa, and <br/>
he can drift off just as easily there (even now at the age of 8) or on the <br/>
car ride home.  He can also stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning or beyond <br/>
if there&#39;s something fun going on.  But, even if there&#39;s something fun <br/>
going on, when he gets really tired, there&#39;s no keeping him awake, and he <br/>
has no reason to resist.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I piss him off because I can&#39;t stay awake to read to him as long <br/>
as he can stay awake to be read to, but he is extremely sympathetic and <br/>
will &quot;allow&quot; me to shut the light off when I just can&#39;t stay awake any <br/>
longer.  Anyway, he&#39;s usually content to drift off to sleep by that time, <br/>
too, but he knows that he is welcome to stay awake and play or look at a <br/>
book or do whatever he&#39;d like to do at that time.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that when long-standing bedtime rules get lifted, the situation <br/>
you describe above may happen.  But, eventually, once a kid realizes that <br/>
the bedtime rules are really gone, staying awake after everyone else goes <br/>
off to bed probably wouldn&#39;t be as exciting anymore and then a kid can <br/>
start to respond more to their body clock that tells them when to go to bed <br/>
and when to get up.  In fact, a kid&#39;s need for going to bed may shift to <br/>
more of a night owl schedule, but if there&#39;s no need for early rising  in <br/>
the morning, what difference does it make?  I like what Sandra has said <br/>
about Kirby and his ability to manage his own bedtime schedule based on <br/>
what&#39;s important to him.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I don&#39;t know everyone in the world; this is only my <br/>
experience.  But, I do have the distant memory of resisting being sleepy if <br/>
I had the chance to stay awake late, because bedtimes were strictly <br/>
enforced when I was a wee one and I HATED it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239158035">I agree heartily with letting the kids go to bed on their own time schedule, <br/>
I&#39;ve seen it happen here succsessfully, and once I stopped waking my teen up <br/>
and let him miss bowling a time or two, he is getting up in time.<br/>
Sometimes they are noisy, but we are in a tiny apartment and it is impossible <br/>
to keep noises from being heard in the grown up &#39;s bedroom, so Joe is a <br/>
crank-monster. I believe that once we move to the new house there will be a <br/>
big difference. The kids won&#39;t be watching tv just outside our door.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669759829">I think when we are changing these types of mind sets and routines,  we have to keep in mind that it is going to take some time for it to work.    I know for my kids it took several days,  on and off for a few months,  before they could realize how tired they were.   <br/>
 <br/>
Also,  since staying home from school, it is so exciting being able to do stuff at home and it is hard to settle down when one is excited.   I know it is for me.             But,  as the days, weeks, months go by,  they&#39;ll figure out that those things are there tomorrow and the next days;  going to bed will be OK.<br/>
 <br/>
My dd (8 yr)  has realized that she is very emotional when she is tired,  she knows to get to bed before she starts feeling that way and she&#39;ll sleep in.   My ds (9 yr) loves to stay up,  loves working on the computer, playing the PS2 and so on.   And we tell him when we are turning in,  sometimes he&#39;ll stay up,  sometimes he goes to bed.   The novelty of  staying up is going away.  Most of the time he&#39;ll want to go to bed when we go to bed.   He also sleeps in.       I do think its been the hardest with my 5 yr dd (I attribute it to me and my dh) I don&#39;t hear alot about  5 yr olds staying up until 10:00. (Except here)    I have to get past that.   She loves to stay up and she is finally learning to sleep in, not always but it is happening.   But I am learning that she doesn&#39;t need sleep like me.   She goes and goes.    So when I&#39;m tired I can&#39;t assume she&#39;s tired.    <br/>
  <br/>
We also do lots of talking about sleep.    My 8 yr dd and I had lots of talks about it.  She&#39;d go to bed in tears, being so tired.  I let her know that I get that way too if I&#39;m too tired.   She hasn&#39;t done that now for several weeks.  We are learning together how to read our bodies.<br/>
 <br/>
I keep telling myself:  patience,   and I also keep telling myself that my baby is growing up so fast and before long she&#39;ll be sleeping in and will want everyone to be quiet too!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For all of these issues I think we all have to realize that it doesn&#39;t just click into place in a few days or weeks,  it might take months.  (Or years for us adults)   Especially when most of us parents are trying to think differently than how we were raised.       We aren&#39;t always going to be in our perfect &#39;Living Joyfully&#39; forms either, then that is going to set it back a little too.   Hopefully with time that persona will take over,  I think it eventually will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493343287">Hi, I&#39;m new (see my earlier intro). I have four kids 6 and under. One thing we have noticed with our oldest is that even before the age of 2 she wouldn&#39;t fall asleep until 10 or 10:30 most nights, even tho we consistently put her to bed between 8 and 8:30. She would just sit in the dark and sing songs or &quot;look&quot; at books. She is still the same now. We now let her stay up until between 9 & 9:30, then she reads books till 10 or 10:30. (She&#39;s a voracious reader.) Dh & I go to bed around 10:30 and we have to go in between 10 and 10:30 and make her turn her lamp off & put the book away! But I know this is her natural rhythm as it started at such a young age. She is also a slow waker-upper in the morning, and often is up an hour or so before she even gets hungry for breakfast. (She gets up around 8:00 a.m. most mornings.)<br/>
<br/>
My almost 5 yo dd, on the other hand, is high-energy and spirited like me and she crashes between 8:30 and 9 every night--totally fast asleep. She&#39;s also usually one of the first ones up in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
My 3.5 year old and 15 month are still taking a 2-3 hour nap every afternoon, and they are put to bed almost every night between 8 & 8:30. They are both usually asleep by 9 at the latest and get up between 7 and 8 in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
All this to say that I really think we have certain natural rhythms. I am spirited myself and my natural rhythms are very obvious in me and also very inconsistent--I go through periods where I can&#39;t sleep till Midnight and can&#39;t get up early, to other times when I crash by 10 and can get up between 5:30 and 6 every morning for a week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and they are definitely not alllowed to get out of bed & come out of their room after they are put to bed. Sometimes we do let them look at books in bed for 15 minutes or so before lights go out. My kids share rooms & beds (& maybe we were strict enough or something) that this has never posed a problem. If they do come out now it is usually for an important reason.<br/>

perfectly capable of roaming the house and eventually putting <br/>
herself to bed, but my 5 year old is still very much at the &quot;fall <br/>
asleep wherever you happen to be&quot; age. I told them that I&#39;d like to <br/>
have them only in their bedroom (where Mikey will stumble to the <br/>
bed if she&#39;s tired, LOL -- well, that&#39;s when they haven&#39;t set up a <br/>
&quot;camping&quot; area on the floor!) after Wally and I go to bed, because <br/>
I find it unbearable to think of Mikey sleeping cold and cramped <br/>
up on oh, say, the rocking chair all night. :P They readily saw the <br/>
sense in this. If they did have a problem with it, I&#39;d probably just <br/>
set an alarm clock and go on a Mikey hunt every day/night at 2 <br/>
a.m. ;)<br/>

But do you have personal experience to be able to disagree with me?<br/>
Not a few days of allowing a child to choose when they sleep, but long term?<br/>
Perhaps a year of seeing what would really happen?<br/>
I have four children and all of them self regulate to some degree. The <br/>
toddler less so of course, but as a parent it is our job to read the signals <br/>
and meet the needs.<br/>
As they get older, they learn to meet their own sleep needs without me laying <br/>
down with them.<br/>
But even the little guy does not have an arbitrary bedtime.<br/>
He gets layed down with when he is actually tired.<br/>
If you haven&#39;t had long term experience with allowing a child to choose, you <br/>
don&#39;t know how it works in real life, you can only assume or guess.<br/>

 Do any of you request your child to stay in their room when up after <br/>
 everyone else has gone to bed? I&#39;m talking about the 10 and under crowd. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No. If it was a very young child ( under 4 or so) I would lay down with them <br/>
or give them books if they still weren&#39;t tired and I was exhausted. <br/>
But my 9 y.o. stays up later than us every night with his 13 y.o. brother.<br/>
In times past, as we were deregulating, they might forget and be too loud. I <br/>
would give them a couple chances to keep the noise level down so we could all <br/>
sleep and if they couldn&#39;t remember I shipped them off to their rooms with <br/>
the explanation that we all needed sleep and if they weren&#39;t tired they <br/>
needed to do something quiet in their rooms.<br/>
These days I never hear a peep after we all go to sleep.<br/>
And the fascination with staying up is totally gone.<br/>
At sleepovers they will go to sleep if they decide nothing more fun is going <br/>
on....their friends will stay up no matter what, just because they can.<br/>
<br/>
I actually think the boys would go to sleep before 10pm if it weren&#39;t for the <br/>
fact that one of their favorite shows, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; is on at 11pm.  They stay <br/>
up for that and then shut everything down and go to bed, even though no one <br/>
tells them to.<br/>
I often stay up and watch it with them.<br/>
Last night I was on the computer when the show ended. Jared had fallen asleep <br/>
on the couch, not sure at what point that happened, and Trevor went to his <br/>
room.<br/>
His bedroom is right off the living area and has no door and an open window <br/>
in the wall.<br/>
He says &quot;Mom, I can&#39;t go to sleep with all that light, can you turn <br/>
everything off now?&quot;<br/>
So HE was the one wanting everything shut down so he could sleep.<br/>
Sleep was more important than trying to find something else to do, or seeing <br/>
what I was up to.<br/>
It works. It takes time, but self regulation does happen.<br/>
And no one is advocating leaving children to themselves.....Of course they <br/>
aren&#39;t little adults. They deserve equal respect as adults, this does not <br/>
mean equal treatment because all needs are different from stage to stage and <br/>
person to person.<br/>

&gt;   It doesn&#39;t matter if there is anything going on that *is* <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   These kids are not concerned about &quot;tomorrow&quot; and are not going to take <br/>

&gt; &quot;out of kilter&quot; they don&#39;t see it that way.  They think its everyone <br/>
&gt; *else* that is out of sorts, not them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Kristen<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kristen, that may be true for a kid who gets AN opportunity to stay up all <br/>
night or the rare opportunity to do so.  The truth is that I don&#39;t know all <br/>
the kids in the world, but has been my experience that when &#39;bedtime rules&#39; <br/>
is not an issue, there&#39;s no reason to ignore the sensations that cause a <br/>
kid to want to go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
In our house, there have never been any rules about when to go to bed.  My <br/>
now-8-year-old son really wants to go to bed when he gets sleepy, and he is <br/>
the one who makes that decision, nobody else.  Of course, if something is <br/>
going on that makes it more interesting to stay awake despite being tired, <br/>
then he will try to stay awake (I would, too), but that is a rare <br/>
occurrence, not the norm; when that guy gets tired, he craves going to <br/>
bed.  He sleeps as long as he needs to or wants to, and I am assured that <br/>
he is in tune with his own sleep needs because I have never interfered with <br/>
them.  If we are out somewhere, bed can be my arms or someone&#39;s sofa, and <br/>
he can drift off just as easily there (even now at the age of 8) or on the <br/>
car ride home.  He can also stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning or beyond <br/>
if there&#39;s something fun going on.  But, even if there&#39;s something fun <br/>
going on, when he gets really tired, there&#39;s no keeping him awake, and he <br/>
has no reason to resist.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I piss him off because I can&#39;t stay awake to read to him as long <br/>
as he can stay awake to be read to, but he is extremely sympathetic and <br/>
will &quot;allow&quot; me to shut the light off when I just can&#39;t stay awake any <br/>
longer.  Anyway, he&#39;s usually content to drift off to sleep by that time, <br/>
too, but he knows that he is welcome to stay awake and play or look at a <br/>
book or do whatever he&#39;d like to do at that time.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that when long-standing bedtime rules get lifted, the situation <br/>
you describe above may happen.  But, eventually, once a kid realizes that <br/>
the bedtime rules are really gone, staying awake after everyone else goes <br/>
off to bed probably wouldn&#39;t be as exciting anymore and then a kid can <br/>
start to respond more to their body clock that tells them when to go to bed <br/>
and when to get up.  In fact, a kid&#39;s need for going to bed may shift to <br/>
more of a night owl schedule, but if there&#39;s no need for early rising  in <br/>
the morning, what difference does it make?  I like what Sandra has said <br/>
about Kirby and his ability to manage his own bedtime schedule based on <br/>
what&#39;s important to him.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I don&#39;t know everyone in the world; this is only my <br/>
experience.  But, I do have the distant memory of resisting being sleepy if <br/>
I had the chance to stay awake late, because bedtimes were strictly <br/>
enforced when I was a wee one and I HATED it!<br/>

tie up the dog and check the doors as thats the important stuff. If they forget a light then its no big deal. They are all low-energy bulbs. I also ask them to keep the sound on the TV or game way down<br/>

Maybe there are kids who can handle going to bed at different times at night, <br/>

bedtime.  My kids may argue about who gets to brush their teeth first or <br/>
whose turn is it to have their story read first, but the actual bedtime isn&#39;t <br/>
a problem most of the time.  Sometimes my daughter will get up from her bed <br/>
and say she&#39;s having problems falling asleep.  I&#39;ll snuggle with her and <br/>
caress her face and she&#39;ll fall back to sleep.  They are used to the schedule <br/>
and know what to expect.  I know there&#39;s going to be a lot of disagreement <br/>
from everyone on this board about my kids&#39; bedtime, but I&#39;m not going to <br/>
change my mind on it.  They usually fall asleep within minutes after <br/>
snuggling with them in bed, so I know they&#39;re tired.  They&#39;re busy all day <br/>
and are on the go.  We are all much happier when we get enough sleep, and we <br/>
can function better the next day. <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
This is precisely what I am trying to get at--the nuances. I want to <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As they get older, they learn to meet their own sleep needs <br/>

&gt; But even the little guy does not have an arbitrary bedtime.<br/>
&gt; He gets layed down with when he is actually tired.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about this example and tell me what you think:<br/>
<br/>
My 15 yo just started an 8:00 class at the local hs this year for <br/>
Algebra II. He had never had to rise to meet a bus, never had <br/>
used an alarm or anything like that. He loves to stay up really late <br/>
at night and sleep in.<br/>
<br/>
Both of us wondered how he&#39;d fare in the transition.<br/>
<br/>
So initially I got up and made sure he was up too. I would knock <br/>
on his door and help him wake up. I made his breakfast, we <br/>
double checked together on his book bag and homework and he <br/>
went out the door.<br/>
<br/>
After a couple weeks of this, he started getting up to his alarm <br/>
clcok. I would still get up a few minutes later to be sure he hadn&#39;t <br/>
turned it off an gone back to sleep. He did actually a couple of <br/>
times. But after a week or so of being up before I got in there, he <br/>
started getting up without any check ups from me. I still wake up <br/>
(I can&#39;t seem to sleep knowing he&#39;s getting ready to leave), but I <br/>
don&#39;t nomrally get up to help him. He&#39;s missed the bus once.<br/>
<br/>
To me it would have been cruel to just expect that after a lifetime <br/>
of never meeting the bus or school schedule that he ought to just <br/>
do it cold turkey. So I supported him until he could go it alone.<br/>
<br/>
To me that&#39;s what a lot of these issues are.<br/>
<br/>
Initially my kids may not be as able to set a bedtime that works <br/>
for them so I help the process by bathing or reading or <br/>
snuggling. I pick a time that makes sense to me for them.<br/>
<br/>
But as they get older, I gradually transfer the responsbility to the <br/>
child so that he/she regulate him/herself. My older kids don&#39;t <br/>
have bedtimes and haven&#39;t for years. My younger ones have a <br/>
bedtime routine that gets chucked if a good TV show is on or we <br/>
have people over. But on the whole, they are in bed between 8:30 <br/>
and 9:00 during this time of parental guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Some might say that they are brewing a sense of anger toward <br/>
us. But ironically my 11 year old just started mentioning that he&#39;d <br/>
like to decide when he goes to bed now. I think he&#39;ll do fine so <br/>
we&#39;re ready for him to do so. The younger two aren&#39;t as ready, in <br/>
our estimation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, got my bull&#39;s-eye vest on! Fire away. :)<br/>
<br/>
(Honestly, I appreciate all the input. I really want to hash this stuff <br/>
out and I&#39;m going to keep coming back with what I think so I can <br/>
hear what you all think. No antagonism meant at all).<br/>

my daughter and son stayed up late, we had a great time.  It wasn&#39;t until <br/>
after they fell asleep and kept waking up, and waking up so early the next <br/>
day that it wasn&#39;t good for them.  It&#39;s true that maybe them being on a <br/>
schedule made it more difficult for them to handle not being on a schedule, <br/>
but most kids I know do well if they&#39;re on a schedule.  Going to sleep at <br/>
9:00pm one night, and then 12:00am one night, 9:00am again, and then 1:30am <br/>
the next night isn&#39;t easy on most kids.  They can do it, but they probably <br/>
don&#39;t function well.  I have made the decision that they&#39;re too young to make <br/>
the decision and understand that when they don&#39;t get enough sleep the night <br/>
before, it affects how they feel the next day.  Sometimes we stay up a little <br/>
after their normal bedtime and this doesn&#39;t seem to affect them, like 20 or <br/>
30 minutes.  The bedtime schedule seems to work well for them and the whole <br/>
family.<br/>

  &gt;   I disagree with this.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   In the example of staying up all night, there are plenty of kids who <br/>
  &gt; ignore their own biological rythms because they think something more <br/>
  &gt; exciting is going on in the middle of the night than their own biological <br/>
  &gt; call to sleep.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   It doesn&#39;t matter if there is anything going on that *is* <br/>
  &gt; exciting.  The fact that everyone else is asleep and they are still awake <br/>
  &gt; is exciting enough by itself, and some kids will ignore their own rythms <br/>
  &gt; repeatedly just to have that, at a high cost to others the next day.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   These kids are not concerned about &quot;tomorrow&quot; and are not going to take <br/>
  &gt; to heart a reminder of what happened &quot;last time&quot; because when they are <br/>
  &gt; &quot;out of kilter&quot; they don&#39;t see it that way.  They think its everyone <br/>
  &gt; *else* that is out of sorts, not them.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Kristen<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Kristen, that may be true for a kid who gets AN opportunity to stay up all <br/>
  night or the rare opportunity to do so.  The truth is that I don&#39;t know all <br/>
  the kids in the world, but has been my experience that when &#39;bedtime rules&#39; <br/>
  is not an issue, there&#39;s no reason to ignore the sensations that cause a <br/>
  kid to want to go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
  In our house, there have never been any rules about when to go to bed.  My <br/>
  now-8-year-old son really wants to go to bed when he gets sleepy, and he is <br/>
  the one who makes that decision, nobody else.  Of course, if something is <br/>
  going on that makes it more interesting to stay awake despite being tired, <br/>
  then he will try to stay awake (I would, too), but that is a rare <br/>
  occurrence, not the norm; when that guy gets tired, he craves going to <br/>
  bed.  He sleeps as long as he needs to or wants to, and I am assured that <br/>
  he is in tune with his own sleep needs because I have never interfered with <br/>
  them.  If we are out somewhere, bed can be my arms or someone&#39;s sofa, and <br/>
  he can drift off just as easily there (even now at the age of 8) or on the <br/>
  car ride home.  He can also stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning or beyond <br/>
  if there&#39;s something fun going on.  But, even if there&#39;s something fun <br/>
  going on, when he gets really tired, there&#39;s no keeping him awake, and he <br/>
  has no reason to resist.<br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes I piss him off because I can&#39;t stay awake to read to him as long <br/>
  as he can stay awake to be read to, but he is extremely sympathetic and <br/>
  will &quot;allow&quot; me to shut the light off when I just can&#39;t stay awake any <br/>
  longer.  Anyway, he&#39;s usually content to drift off to sleep by that time, <br/>
  too, but he knows that he is welcome to stay awake and play or look at a <br/>
  book or do whatever he&#39;d like to do at that time.<br/>
<br/>
  My guess is that when long-standing bedtime rules get lifted, the situation <br/>
  you describe above may happen.  But, eventually, once a kid realizes that <br/>
  the bedtime rules are really gone, staying awake after everyone else goes <br/>
  off to bed probably wouldn&#39;t be as exciting anymore and then a kid can <br/>
  start to respond more to their body clock that tells them when to go to bed <br/>
  and when to get up.  In fact, a kid&#39;s need for going to bed may shift to <br/>
  more of a night owl schedule, but if there&#39;s no need for early rising  in <br/>
  the morning, what difference does it make?  I like what Sandra has said <br/>
  about Kirby and his ability to manage his own bedtime schedule based on <br/>
  what&#39;s important to him.<br/>
<br/>
  As I said, I don&#39;t know everyone in the world; this is only my <br/>
  experience.  But, I do have the distant memory of resisting being sleepy if <br/>
  I had the chance to stay awake late, because bedtimes were strictly <br/>
  enforced when I was a wee one and I HATED it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think most perceptive people can see what lots of people <br/>
around them need when those people aren&#39;t seeing it <br/>
themselves. Hey, I often wish I could change some of my <br/>
husband&#39;s habits, &quot;for his own good&quot;! ;)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, mothers can be wrong just like all mortals. What <br/>
I honestly believe my child needs and I should make her do &quot;for <br/>
her own good&quot; may be completely wrong. So, I am an advisor not <br/>
a dictator, however benevolent.<br/>
<br/>
The other day, we all went to our book storage unit because my <br/>
husband and I needed to finish our yearly inventory. The girls <br/>
came along. Brit (8) was wearing a particular outfit she likes that <br/>
is much more suitable for summer, and it was pretty darn cold <br/>
that day. I said, &quot;Better grab a sweater&quot;. She didn&#39;t want to put <br/>
one on, because it would mess up the look of the outfit. I &quot;knew&quot; <br/>
she was going to want the sweater. I could have forced her <br/>
(through words or more) to put the sweater on. Instead, I just <br/>
took it with me and left it where she could see it. She was <br/>
actually quite comfortable most of the time we were there, but did <br/>
put on the sweater near the end. She didn&#39;t fight off the urge once <br/>
she was truly cold, and I didn&#39;t pester her or mock &quot;told you so&quot;. It <br/>
was her decision. I suppose I could also have played the mean <br/>
trick of leaving the sweater behind on purpose, to &quot;teach her the <br/>
consequences of her actions&quot;. We much prefer just being nice to <br/>
each other and I&#39;m sure you do, too.<br/>
<br/>
Really it comes down to the same thing unschooling does: it <br/>
isn&#39;t nearly as much about what you do, it&#39;s about who gets to <br/>
make the decision.<br/>

Nowadays, the sleep thing is less of an issue.  He *still* stays up till 3am...but he also sleeps till 11am or later sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
But there are days when we have to be up very early, like 6am for a swim meet.  And then he is up late and up early.<br/>

That can make for a difficult day sometimes.<br/>

<br/>
    Kristen<br/>
<br/>
  Actually I should clarify this.<br/>
<br/>
  Now that my son is 14, its not as much of an issue.  He goes to bed late and sleeps late.  I don&#39;t plan much of anything in the mornings anymore unless I have to (like an appointment or something).<br/>
<br/>
  And last summer when he had swim practice in the mornings, his sleep rythms eventually did adjust.<br/>
<br/>
  But when he was LITTLE, like under the age of 6, he would stay up late and then get up early and be a monster.  He never adjusted.  He just went without sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
  I encouraged a bedtime (but didn&#39;t really enforce one) My husband didn&#39;t do anything about bedtimes and I worked evening shift.  So I gave up on bedtime &quot;schedules&quot; a LONG LONG time ago :o).  <br/>
<br/>
  But even with no bedtime for a couple of years, at that young age, he would still do this, even when he had to be up early in the morning.  He continued to do it for probably 6 years.<br/>
<br/>
  He would get more and more wound up and fussy when he is tired, he didn&#39;t &quot;settle down&quot; like a lot of kids do.  He didin&#39;t know how to settle himself.<br/>
<br/>
  Over the years, like at about age 9 and 10, he found ways to settle himself, by playing music while falling asleep or reading.   But he STILL did not fall asleep until midnight or 1am, even when he had to be up early. <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m just glad its not an issue anymore.<br/>

 &gt; Of course they aren&#39;t, you control the bedtime so staying up sounds<br/>
 &gt; attractive.  If she knew here own body and bedtime was not a control<br/>

<br/>
I was doubtful but we tried this. We used to have strict bedtimes and I<br/>
decided to let the kids have more input now that we are unschooling. It took<br/>
about 3 weeks then suddely I noticed they all fell asleep around about 9:00<br/>
each night with no fuss. This seems to be their natural pattern and no we<br/>
have no more bedtime battles. Ours kids are ages nearly 4, nearly 5, 7 and 8<br/>
1/2.<br/>

&lt;&lt;   In the example of staying up all night,<br/>
  there are plenty of kids who ignore their own biological rythms because <br/>
they think something more exciting is going on in the middle of the night <br/>
than their own biological call to sleep.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How long could they ignore them, though?<br/>
For some kids being awake at 3:00 a.m. (if it has always been forbidden) is <br/>
in and of itself more exciting than going to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
But *IF* the need for sleep is real and natural, children will sleep.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s NOT natural, then parents have been lying all these years.<br/>
<br/>
And one thing that is firmly denied in this culture is that some individuals <br/>
need more sleep than others.  Still we have the prescribed 8 to 10 hours, <br/>
depending on age, so that adults no matter what their needs are presumed to <br/>
need 8 hours.  <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m sick, even a little, I need eight or nine.  If I&#39;m well, I need six.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty needs more sleep than Holly does.  Always has.  We know because we let <br/>
them find their own natural levels.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;These kids are not concerned about &quot;tomorrow&quot; and are not going to take to <br/>
heart a reminder of what happened &quot;last time&quot; because when they are &quot;out of <br/>
kilter&quot; they don&#39;t see it that way.  They think its everyone *else* that is <br/>
out of sorts, not them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Speaking as someone who knows from experience, if you let it go they WILL <br/>
come to their own routine.  If you try it once or twice, or it happens <br/>
accidently (usually following something that WAS really exciting or <br/>
disturbing, or from a kid waking up from being sick, neither of which is a <br/>
legitimate test of natural sleep patterns), that&#39;s an exciting exception.<br/>
<br/>
If you let it go for months or years, the kids just aren&#39;t cranky because <br/>
they DID go to sleep.  Or if they are they&#39;ll be the first to say &quot;I should <br/>
have gone to bed earlier,&quot; and then they do!<br/>
<br/>
There have been times I&#39;ve said, &quot;Do you need to take a nap?&quot; and that can be <br/>
the indicator that they&#39;re not being sufficiently fun to be around or easy to <br/>
get along with.  Or I&#39;ve said, &quot;Sorry you didn&#39;t sleep more, because we <br/>
really do need to be there at noon.&quot;  And there have been times I stayed up <br/>
too late, talking to overnight guests, or writing, or sewing, or something in <br/>
which I was engrossed and which was honestly more important that sleep to me <br/>
at that time.  And if I&#39;m tired I am careful to be extra patient that day.  <br/>
And so they see an adult modelling how to be on a tired day.<br/>
<br/>
I think when people who are unwilling to actually try or do something <br/>
speculate on the outcome, it&#39;s the same as people who have doled TV out an <br/>
hour at a time saying &quot;If I let him, he would do nothing but watch TV.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not true, but only those who have let the TV go know that.  The rest are <br/>
guessing.  Or hoping that their rules are the thing preventing their dire <br/>
outcome.<br/>

See my other posts.<br/>
<br/>
I *do* have experience with this and its not the outcome was not the same as yours, or it wasn&#39;t when they were little.  And even though it *was* a problem, we still did not assign bedtimes.  It did not improve on its own until my son was about 9 or 10 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
That is a long time to deal with a cranky child who *did* need more sleep but didn&#39;t allow himself to *get* more sleep.<br/>
