I&#39;ve always thought that the message of Jesus is not merely to love him, the<br/>
person, but to live in a way that expresses his ideas. He seems to have<br/>
wanted his followers to go out and DO stuff, like heal people of their<br/>
wounds and problems, not just talk the talk.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re walkin&#39; the walk, too. That&#39;s what&#39;s important, the way I<br/>
hear it. <br/>
