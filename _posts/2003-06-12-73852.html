<div id="ygrps-yiv-939348422">Julian did the Meyers-Briggs thig yesterday and LOVED it. He was amazed at <br/>
how accurate it felt. He came out to be a INFJ, same as my partner. I come out <br/>
to INFP.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting... the personalities of all three of us mesh so well, and <br/>
this just illustrates  it.<br/>
<br/>
Cool. Fun.<br/>
