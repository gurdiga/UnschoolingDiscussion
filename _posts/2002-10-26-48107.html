<br/>
Sic is used when quoting someone else&#39;s misspelling or questionable use of <br/>
a word.  It&#39;s the editor/QA person in me (it&#39;s what I do for a living as a <br/>
medical transcriptionist).  Since the word &quot;truly&quot; was misspelled as <br/>
&quot;truely,&quot;  the editor in me used [sic] to show that I was quoting the <br/>
person accurately and acknowledging the misspelling.  It&#39;s pretty goofy now <br/>
that I think of it; I mean, who cares, for Heaven&#39;s sake?  But, it&#39;s in me <br/>
blood; I can&#39;t help myself!  Maybe there&#39;s a support group out there for <br/>
folks like me who edit everything!  :-/<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;re well!<br/>

I know this sounds uneducated of me but it&#39;s something I see now and then<br/>
and have never figured out what it means.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358378645">Thank you so much for explaining all this, Marji.<br/>
NOW I know and I&#39;ll never need to wonder, ever again.<br/>
I&#39;m glad you cared to acknowledge the mispelling &lt;g&gt; and I&#39;m glad I asked.<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m doing very well, just trying to keep up with this list lately!<br/>
It&#39;s quite a challenge just reading all these posts, and I don&#39;t know where<br/>
I&#39;d find the time to actually participate in conversations.<br/>
But I loved what you said about getting so much out of this list that you<br/>
feel you should be paying for it. I feel exactly the same way, and that&#39;s<br/>
why I stay, and mostly lurk. But I learn SO much and just soak it all up<br/>
like a sponge.<br/>
Hope you&#39;re doing well, too.<br/>
Thanks again ~<br/>
<br/>

word as written, by the original author, who misspelled it.<br/>
