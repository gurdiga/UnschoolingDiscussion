<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050413513"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I struggle with this too, maybe you all can help.  I find it difficult to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>find the value in Spiderman, Superman, etc.  This is my son&#39;s current<br/>
&quot;thing.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m trying not to be judgemental, but it&#39;s a struggle.  I&#39;m not sure what it<br/>
is<br/>
except that I was never interested in super heroes as a child.  Also, I have<br/>
trouble with violence in general.<br/>
<br/>
This happened to me with my second child (now 11)  I had NO interest at all<br/>
in superheros, neither did my daughter (four years older), ooo! and I was so<br/>
&quot;non- violent&quot; (secret...play is not violence!- it is pretend :-).<br/>
<br/>
It really helped me- not just to tolerate it (because I had been doing this)<br/>
but revel in it (because that is how I like to be with all my kid&#39;s stuff<br/>
they are into- it is more fun :-)- is when I figured- &quot;it seems that little<br/>
boys spend an awful lot of time pretending to save, help, defend, and<br/>
protect the world from big old monsters- and they are just practicing for<br/>
when they grow up to protect and help a family!&quot;  My husband could really<br/>
relate to this!  and he also never had ANY problem with his hero games and<br/>
was reveling in them (and participating!) already.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
