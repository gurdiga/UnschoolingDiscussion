<div id="ygrps-yiv-356783630">I&#39;ve been reading and listening but not posting because unschooling <br/>
is a new concept for me.  Just through reading posts I&#39;ve already <br/>
found that my ideas about learning and parenting are radically <br/>
changing (for the better!)<br/>
<br/>
But I have a few personal concerns that I hope you more experienced <br/>
moms could help me work through.<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 children; 10 year old girl, 7 year old boy and a 3 year old <br/>
boy.  It is the 7 year old who has led me to unschooling.  He is <br/>
very interested in the world, especially science, animals, math, <br/>
etc... and though he is just beginning to read simple books, he <br/>
pours over and absorbes any subject he is interested in.  (bats, <br/>
sharks, deep sea creatures, multiplication, anything science, legos, <br/>
etc...)  He is definately a self-starter, independent thinker and <br/>
very verbal and social.  He specifically asked to homeschool because <br/>
he found Kindergarten tiresome and saw that he could have the chance <br/>
to learn what he wanted to know if he stayed home and I could help <br/>
guide him.  Now he has led me into this new world...<br/>
<br/>
His sister is the reason I started homeschooling.  She was <br/>
identified with a developmental delay at 3 yrs., and found the <br/>
classroom too stimulating and the level of inquiry and time needed <br/>
for her to learn too shallow.  (But in many areas she is clearly <br/>
brilliant) She has progressed greatly due to the 1:1 instruction <br/>
between herself and I for the last yr and 1/2.  Now she understands <br/>
so much more and is poised and self assured, is a terrific reader <br/>
and has just blossomed into a gem of a girl with the extra attention <br/>
and explainations.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read some unschooling posts for kids who had been or who would <br/>
be &quot;labeled&quot; as having special needs / gifted if they were in the <br/>
public school system.  There doesn&#39;t seem to be many parents who <br/>
unschool children like my daughter.  At this time, I&#39;m aware of <br/>
where she is developmentally, academically, socially in relation to <br/>
her peers  (and she is now at a &quot;typical level&quot; -- meaning that she <br/>
has come a  long way.  **Remember, she was in public school -- it <br/>
was for many years my job to know this info. and to help her in <br/>
her &#39;uneven&#39; areas  --Which I have done better than the <br/>
professionals at public school).<br/>
<br/>
So now we are entering &#39;unschooling&#39; territory.  My daughter who is <br/>
an exceptional artist and more introverted (mainly due to not <br/>
fulling undertanding situations or social cues) but not shy, sees <br/>
life in a more limiting way than my son does.  I&#39;m through <br/>
with &quot;pushing&quot; her to do things -- it doesn&#39;t make sense anymore, <br/>
she is almost a teenager and it is disrespectful.  But I also know <br/>
that in the past she DID have great gaping holes in core knowledge <br/>
and awareness.  <br/>
<br/>
How does unschooling work for a child like my daughter?  How do I <br/>
open her up to new experiences or new ways of thinking when this is <br/>
not generally part of her makeup?<br/>
<br/>
This past month we&#39;ve been unschooling because both of my children <br/>
have already met their state goals.  Within this month, we&#39;ve <br/>
explored areas my son is interested in and I&#39;m finding this approach <br/>
works better learning-wise rather than pages and pages of pre-<br/>
scheduled cirriculum.  Children do learn a great deal when they are <br/>
the guides!  <br/>
<br/>
Also, since she has been labeled with a developmental disability, <br/>
she is in the &#39;system,&#39; so having state and/or school officials <br/>
visit is and could be a reality.  Since she has exceeded others&#39; <br/>
expectations, I doubt if I would have a problem down the road... but <br/>
I worry.<br/>
<br/>
Reassurance and advise would be appreciated.  <br/>
