TIME<br/>
<br/>
A minute is a little thing, but minutes make the day.<br/>
So crowd in some kind deeds before it slips away.<br/>
<br/>
The trouble with being punctual is that nobody is there to appreciate<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it<br/>
over?<br/>

Put up in a place<br/>
where it&#39;s easy to see<br/>
the cryptic admonishment<br/>
     T.T.T.<br/>
<br/>
When you feel how depressingly<br/>
slowly you climb,<br/>
it&#39;s well to remember that<br/>
     Things Take Time.<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Time<br/>
<br/>
* The future is purchased by the present.<br/>
<br/>
* Lost time is never found again.<br/>
<br/>
* One thing you can&#39;t recycle is wasted time.<br/>
<br/>
* Procrastination is the thief of time.<br/>
<br/>
* This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we know what to<br/>
do with it.<br/>
<br/>
* Time is more valuable than money because time is irreplaceable.<br/>
<br/>
* What counts is not the number of hours you put in, but how<br/>
much you put in the hours.<br/>
<br/>
* One thing you can learn by watching the clock is that it passes<br/>
time by keeping it&#39;s hands busy.<br/>
<br/>
* Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is mystery. Today is a gift.<br/>
     That&#39;s why it&#39;s called the present!<br/>
<br/>
* Killing time murders opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
* Devote each day to the object then in time and every evening will<br/>
find something done. <br/>
<br/>
* Do not dwell in the past. Do not dream of the future. Concentrate the <br/>
mind on the present moment. <br/>
<br/>
* Dost thou love life? then do not squander time, for that is the stuff <br/>
life is made of. <br/>
<br/>
* I wasted time, and now doth time waste me. <br/>
<br/>
* If you lose an hour in the morning, you have to hunt for it the rest <br/>
of the day. <br/>
<br/>
* Know the true value of time; snatch, seize, and enjoy every moment of<br/>
it. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination: never put off        <br/>
till to-morrow what you can do to-day. <br/>
<br/>
* Lost, yesterday, somewhere between sunrise and sunset, two golden <br/>
hours, each set with sixty diamond minutes. No reward is offered, for<br/>
they are gone forever! <br/>
<br/>
* Neither will the wave which has passed be called back; nor can the <br/>
hour which has gone by return.<br/>
 <br/>
* One always has time enough, if one will apply it well. <br/>
<br/>
* The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely <br/>
to see. <br/>
<br/>
* The future comes one day at a time. <br/>
<br/>
* The future influences the present just as much as the past. <br/>
<br/>
* The Future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty <br/>
minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is. <br/>
<br/>
* The velocity with which time flies is infinite, as is most apparent<br/>
to those who look back. <br/>
<br/>
* We take no note of time but from its loss. <br/>
<br/>
* What a day may bring, a day may take away. <br/>
<br/>
* What a folly to dread the thought of throwing away life at once, and <br/>
yet have no regard of throwing it away by parcels and piecemeal. <br/>
<br/>
* When you sit with a nice girl for two hours, you think it&#39;s only a <br/>
minute. But when you sit on a hot stove for a minute, you think        <br/>
it&#39;s two hours. That&#39;s relativity. <br/>
<br/>
* You wake up in the morning, and lo! your purse is wonderfully filled <br/>
with twenty-four hours of the tissue of the universe of your life. No<br/>
one can take it from you. No one receives either more or less than you<br/>
receive. Waste your infinitely precious commodity as much as you will,<br/>
and the supply will never be withheld from you. Moreover, you cannot<br/>
draw on the future. Impossible to get into debt. You can only waste the<br/>
passing moment. You cannot waste tomorrow. It is kept for you.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13340848">This is by Piet Hein-=-he was a member of the Danish underground in WWII and wrote many things with double messages- - so that the messages were about and yet out of understanding of the Nazis. I used to ahve one of his books--I think it was called _Grooks_ (but I&#39;m not sure)<br/>
