just the way to express the logic.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if math and critical thinking aren&#39;t related, then what is???<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that logic and seeing relationships and puzzle solving and <br/>
strategizing and playing games with numbers is all building toward and part <br/>
of mathematics.  It may not be direct instruction in arithmetic (memorizing <br/>
those addition and multiplication facts) but it sure is mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
Math is the fun stuff - the games and theories and intuitive connections and <br/>
leaps of logic and insight.  Arithmetic is the boring stuff - memorizing in a <br/>
disconnected way.<br/>
<br/>
imo.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a relatively new hsing Mom I&#39;m finding that if I can get answers to<br/>
questions such as the one I posted about tic tac toe it helps me see new<br/>
angles on old games.  When your focus has been on school type<br/>
mathematics/arithmetic it is hard to see the longer range effects of<br/>
children spending their time doing these activities.  You can see what they<br/>
are doing when it is a sheet of math equations - but when they play<br/>
strategy games I sense a void as to what they are accomplishing.  I suppose<br/>
it is the several year wait that will show what the profit is to their<br/>
playing games of this type.  A new hser may not feel they can wait several<br/>
years to see what is happening.  <br/>

<br/>
I understand the worries some folks have if they are new and can&#39;t *see*<br/>
progress, but I think progress usually comes much sooner than years.<br/>
<br/>
I have a fascination right now with the connection between math and music.<br/>
I won&#39;t bore you all with it, I can go on at great length because I&#39;m<br/>
really into it.<br/>
<br/>
I got some new books, and in one I was reading today, it had a list of the<br/>
4 branches of mathematics in Pythagoras&#39; time:  Arithmetic, Geometry,<br/>
Astronomy, and Music.  Music was considered primarily a branch of<br/>
mathematics!<br/>
<br/>
My point is that there is a lot more to math than what most people think<br/>
math is, and the more different areas of it you can explore, the more<br/>
comfortable you will become with seeing it more places.<br/>
<br/>
Numbers are the simplest part of math.  The theory, the patterns, the<br/>
connections, the logic, the algebraic *thinking*, that&#39;s the most important<br/>
stuff.  Without those, numbers won&#39;t do much for you.<br/>

snake breeding -- my older daughter learned Punnett Squares displaying<br/>

discuss that in my book)  -- fractions realized in sound.  Both of my<br/>
daughters also learned Carnatic (south Indian) music from me, which is<br/>
famous for its musical complexity -- 72 major scales, pivoting around<br/>
the 5th, and divided in half according to whether the fourth is natural<br/>
or augmented, and up to 92,108 minor ones, all of which can be fit on a<br/>
chart like a table of elements -- each with their own particular &quot;taste&quot;<br/>
which is brought in the listener, with their own properties (some are<br/>
good for growing plants, etc.), and time of day when they can be played<br/>
for best effect.<br/>
<br/>
Pythagorean mathematics still exists in the theory of harmonics, of<br/>
course, and in my experience, kids are absolutely fascinated by it<br/>
(watch a child violinist when she plays her first harmonic and you know<br/>
what I mean), but I have rarely seen music teachers discuss it with<br/>
children (and NEVER heard of it being shared in schools! -- what did you<br/>
expect?)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a veritable ocean of material -- I have a bunch because I am a<br/>
&quot;veena&quot; player (a south Indian mandolin/sitar-like instrument.)  The web<br/>
is full of sites on &quot;Carnatic music&quot; -- I&#39;m sure some of them have what<br/>
are called raga/tala (melody/rhythm) charts (Indian rhythm is as complex<br/>
as melody -- but no overt harmony -- rejected around the 2nd century<br/>
a.d. as incompatible with spiritual clarity).  But once you jump in, you<br/>
are literally in an ocean! (which turned out great for me; I ended up<br/>
with adopted Indian family, a second home there, and an adopted<br/>
daughter!)<br/>
<br/>
If you want, tomorrow I can e-mail you off the list on how the major 72<br/>
get constructed (from a western perspective).  I doubt that will be of<br/>
huge interest to this list -- though if people ask, I&#39;ll send to them as<br/>
well.<br/>

As a note:  one of the biggest reaosns we started hsing was that it did NOT <br/>
take along time to see the negative results in my son as he struggled with an <br/>
inadequate situation in K (he was pulled out after 7 months of ps).  So the <br/>
results may be slow in coming here but the problems were quick to arise there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545401256">Hello this is for all you that like math out there.  <br/>
 <br/>
My daughter is playing a game where she needs to catch 100 fish to get a  <br/>
prize.  She gets 18 fish on each try.  Her question is how many times  will she <br/>
have to play to get the required number of fish.  We kept a chart  of ten times <br/>
fishing (4 different fish and junk).  I took the number of one  type of fish <br/>
added them up and then divided by the number of tries.  Then  divided 18 into <br/>
that number for the percentage...but the percentages don&#39;t add  up right so I <br/>
think I am doing something wrong.  I just can&#39;t seem  to wrap my mind around <br/>
how to answer this  (our math guys aren&#39;t home  and we just can&#39;t seem to get <br/>
it.)  Is there another way or are we  completely off base?<br/>
 <br/>

=================<br/>
 <br/>
If she gets 18 fish on each try, the amount of junk is irrelevant.   Did you <br/>
mean to say she gets 18 tries in each game?<br/>
 <br/>
If she gets 18 every time, that&#39;s almost twenty, so it will take her more  <br/>
than five tries.  Six.<br/>
 <br/>
Would thinking of it as money help any?  How many eighteen-cent things  can <br/>
be bought with a dollar?<br/>

The average, you mean?<br/>
Does it matter how many of which kind of fish need to be in the 100?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495765384">Yes it matters how many fish... okay so this is probably why I can&#39;t get my  <br/>
head around the question. <br/>
 <br/>
She gets 18 tries at a time...example try one 4 yellow, 7 orange, 1 brown,  0 <br/>
green, 6 junk. try two 5 yellow, 3 orange, 0 brown, 1 green, 9 junk. Try  <br/>
three 7 yellow, 2 orange, 0 brown, 0 green, 9 junk<br/>
she needs 100 of any one fish to get the prize.  Of course brown and  green <br/>
yield bigger prizes.  Her question was &quot; About how many times do I  have to do <br/>
each turn (18 tries) to get the fish I want?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
so I thought we could find the percentage of fish she got, on the average,  <br/>
and then figure out how many times she would have to try based on that... what  <br/>
we came up with with 10 tries was 27 % yellow, 22% orange, 50% junk and 1% <br/>
for  both brown and green.  which would mean that she would have to fish 20  <br/>
times to get the required number of yellow for example. (on an average)<br/>
 <br/>
would that be right?  <br/>
