**When someone who has been unschooling for a long time says &#39;you&#39;re not an<br/>
unschooler because you use this or that control&#39;, its highly possible<br/>
their observation is correct.**<br/>
<br/>
I think you hit the mark here.  I realize that when I first decided the<br/>
unschooling route is the one for me and my family...because it fits with my<br/>
understanding of how people grow and learn....that I wasn&#39;t a &#39;complete&#39;<br/>
unschooler&#39; because I needed to grow into it.  I needed to de-school myself<br/>
from all the mainstream ideas,  from all the years of schooling I have,  uh,<br/>
endured? (LOL),  from my wants and agendas for my children.  Even after<br/>
&#39;getting it&#39;  in my brain,  and thinking I understood and &#39;lived<br/>
it&#39;....sometimes things didn&#39;t work how *I* wanted them to.....at times I<br/>
became frustrated.  This list became an outlet for some of these<br/>
frustrations at times....when I realized getting them out here would enable<br/>
me to not subject the youngsters to them.<br/>
<br/>
Last fall....after spending much time examining my own behavior and<br/>
interaction with the children,  and noticing there resistance times were<br/>
times I tried to impose my agenda.....even when I didn&#39;t consciously mean<br/>
to....well,  I was able to make what I felt was a leap into full<br/>
unschooling.  And from that perspective,  began to see problems with the<br/>
&quot;boxed&quot; aproach,  where parts of life or parts of families are &#39;boxed&#39; into<br/>
a special category and neede to be treated differently.  I though that those<br/>
people maybe hadn&#39;t made a full leap.<br/>
<br/>
guess I don&#39;t want to be too presumptuous here....not saying I don&#39;t have a<br/>
lot to learn,  I do {I&#39;m always learning,  if you all can live with that<br/>
here &lt;sheepish grin&gt; :-) }<br/>
<br/>
**Then, I stop and think about the ones that aren&#39;t so lucky. The ones that<br/>
don&#39;t have internal support, or even have internal &#39;abuse&#39;. Should they<br/>
now not be able to unschool because they can&#39;t fit their life into all<br/>
the requirements?**<br/>
<br/>
Interesting wording...&#39;requirements&#39;  seems like an oxymoron in regard to<br/>
unschooling.  I suppose attempts to unschool or &#39;close to unschooling&#39; would<br/>
benefit the children more than....either try to unschool or just go use a<br/>
curriculum (is that the &#39;opposite of unschooling even?)   I sometimes read<br/>
about a continuum from unschooling to &#39;relaxed approach,  to strict<br/>
curriculum to....spartan military camp (!)...is it a continuum?  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure really.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**But what about the ones that made some wrong choices in the past, and now<br/>
want to unschool. Shouldn&#39;t they be able to come here and say &#39;I&#39;m<br/>
unschooling as most as I can&#39; without being challanged as to there is no<br/>
such animal?**<br/>
<br/>
Well, for me,  it was unschooling ...even when I had a ways to go to fully<br/>
understanding it.  When I became aware that what I was sometimes doing  was<br/>
&#39;not&#39;  unschooling, (as in unwittingly trying to impose my agenda),   then I<br/>
realized hwere my struggles had come from and became a more complete<br/>
unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I may get into a rut now and again where I lose awareness of how<br/>
things are going and unwittingly interfere with unscholing.  That&#39;s why it<br/>
seems to me to be a way of life that&#39;s fully integrated into who I am....and<br/>
requires of me that I try to remain *aware*  and present to whether or not<br/>
my ego is getting in the way of someone&#39;s growth.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39; a few toughts for ya...<br/>
