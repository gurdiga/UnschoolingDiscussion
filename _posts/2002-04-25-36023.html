<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834189595"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;In other words, we want to do a thematic child-led program but I feel <br/>
&gt;&gt;there needs to be some parental guidance for logistics sake.  So, the plan <br/>
&gt;&gt;right now (and like I said, I&#39;m just learning all this, so I&#39;d love <br/>
&gt;&gt;feedback from you!) is to sit down with my daughter before our &quot;nonschool&quot; <br/>
&gt;&gt;year starts and talk about themes she&#39;d like to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pursue next year.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of thoughts come to mind as I read this. First, why not start your <br/>
&quot;nonschool year&quot; now? You&#39;re out of the school program and off their <br/>
timetable. Be bold! September is NOT a magic month. Start your learning <br/>
adventure right now.<br/>
<br/>
My second thought is, of course, about the idea of trying to plan out your <br/>
daughter&#39;s learning. Schools do that so they can accomodate 30 kids per <br/>
classroom, and 100&#39;s of kids per school. There has to be a plan with that <br/>
many little bodies to teach and that many parents to be acccountable to. <br/>
However, YOU don&#39;t have those constraints. You are free to let your daughter <br/>
follow her interests *as they happen*. If you get too caught up in a plan or <br/>
thematic unit of study, you may miss the opportunity to pursue all the new <br/>
and interesting things that come up that you both have never even thought of <br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
Child-led activities can mean starting our thinking about endangered <br/>
species, but then only giving it a cursory glance. While doing that a <br/>
drawing of an animal skeleton sparks an interest and takes you in a <br/>
completely different direction. Or the bubbles in an aquarium. Or the <br/>
streetlights on the drive over. Or the weather. Or the music on the radio. <br/>
Or.....<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786297450">Actually, we&#39;re not out of the school program (that was in my original<br/>
post.)  My daughter is in public school right now.<br/>
