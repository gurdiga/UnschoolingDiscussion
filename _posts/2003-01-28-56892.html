OOoh, that is downright cruel and unusual punishment.<br/>
Nah, just stick around here...we&#39;ll splash you enough!! :)<br/>

I think what matters to your son should be more important than your fears. He <br/>
will pick up on your fears, so it&#39;s best to try and rid yourself of <br/>
them...but I&#39;m sure you realize that.<br/>
Does a failing math course (and he isn&#39;t failing anyway) in anyway indicate <br/>
success or failure in life.<br/>
Try to see his life as a continuum, not peaking at the point he enters <br/>
college or gets a job or ANYTHING! It&#39;s a journey, he can change his mind <br/>
about what he&#39;s doing at any time, change courses midstream, try new things <br/>
etc......a math course really matters not one whit in the big picture does it?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a website about a girl unschooled from birth, memorized her times <br/>
tables in order to make the college entrance exam more pleasant and went on <br/>
to ACE higher level maths in college.<br/>
Hows that for reassurance? We can learn stuff whenever we need it in life. We <br/>
don&#39;t need to learn things ahead of time for the &quot;what ifs&quot;. Just learn it <br/>
when you actually need the information, and life will be good!<br/>

So that is Laurie&#39;s website, if her mum still reads here maybe she&#39;ll come <br/>
along and comment.<br/>
<br/>
ANd I really hope those of you that haven&#39;t read this one will do so TODAY, <br/>
right  now!<br/>

It&#39;s about computers in the slums of India project, the commentary on how <br/>
humans learn is profound.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
