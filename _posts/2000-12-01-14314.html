<div>Hi,</div>
<div>I am very interested in Unschooling.&nbsp; My question is how do you meet the demands of Government officials.&nbsp; What do you do about mandatory testing?&nbsp; What about those who live in states where the law requires them to show what curriculum they are using and have to have it approved?&nbsp; What about those nasty social workers that come to your house and demand to know what you are teaching your child and to prove that they are learning?&nbsp; I&#39;ve never had one come to my home, but I am concerned&nbsp; that it could happen.</div>

<br/>
-=- My question is how do you meet <br/>
 the demands of Government officials.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t too many government officials who care about homeschooling, and <br/>
fewer still who have the right to do anything about it.  (And some of THOSE <br/>
don&#39;t care! &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s not as if there are truant officers prowling the town <br/>
as there might have been in 1935 (or might not have been; a few towns had <br/>
them and parents in ALL towns used them as a boogeyman).<br/>
<br/>
-=-What do you do about mandatory testing?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not all states have testing requirements.  Some have options--testing at home <br/>
with a purchased test, or keeping a portfolio.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-What about those who live in states where the law requires them <br/>
 to show what curriculum they are using and have to have it approved? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyplace besides Pennsylvania which has this requirement?<br/>
What you do if you&#39;re in Pennsylvania (or another such place if there is <br/>
one), is you find the local unschoolers and get their direct advice, look at <br/>
the packets they&#39;ve prepared which have been successfully approved.    A book <br/>
list, a set of proposed field trips, an explanation of interest-led learning, <br/>
some quotes from John Holt, a list of all the stuff in your house which can <br/>
be used for science...  I know people do it, and they do it with lists and <br/>
words, not with the name of a curriculum.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- What about those nasty social workers that come to your house and demand <br/>
to know what you are teaching your child and to prove that they are learning? <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Social workers can be good in worst-of-all situations.  If there were no <br/>
social workers, a lot of kids would be in tears and hospitals and morgues who <br/>
aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If you are neglecting or abusing kids AND homeschooling, when social workers <br/>
show up they&#39;ll want to know about homeschooling.  If your kids are happy, <br/>
healthy, nobody has any reason to report you to a government egency, then you <br/>
won&#39;t meet any social workers.  I know of one family here who&#39;s had social <br/>
workers repeatedly, but it&#39;s because the dad is way older than the wife and <br/>
one of his grown daughters calls them and tells them stuff.  I know of one <br/>
family who had social workers once, and I think it was a routine thing <br/>
related to adoption (they have two of their own kids and three adopted from <br/>
overseas).  <br/>
<br/>
If your family is intact and you don&#39;t have any crazed inlaws or spiteful <br/>
relatives you&#39;re probably entirely safe.  If you have an ex husband (parent <br/>
of the kids) or neighbors who REALLY wish your kids weren&#39;t making all that <br/>
noise (or that the&#39;d go to school for six hours so the neighbor could have a <br/>
break), then those are the people you need to appease.  That happens even <br/>
when kids are in school, though, sometimes, that you have to talk to the kids <br/>
about giving neighbors some peace, or you have to justify to their dad why <br/>
they&#39;re not in dance lessons or learning French cooking.<br/>
<br/>
What state are you in?  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I live in Florida.  The &quot;government officials&quot; here aren&#39;t beating down our <br/>
doors to harass us.  <br/>
<br/>
What is the law where you live?  Where do you live?<br/>
<br/>
You might want to look at www.nhen.org.  They have a page listing the laws in <br/>
each state and I think support groups too if you have local questions.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div>Unfortunately, Sandra, I have heard of too many first hand accounts of perfectly normal, healthy families being harassed by school systems truant officers and social workers having done absolutely nothing to warrant their interest.&nbsp; There are school systems out there that don&#39;t like loosing public funds to kids who are homeschooled and threaten families to make them enroll their children.&nbsp; Just read the latest Court Reporter for current examples in various states.&nbsp; We have had families in our own local Homeschool support group report problems.&nbsp; Some counties are more invasive then others.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459615747">Where did you hear of these reports?<br/>
<br/>
Just read the latest Court Reporter for current<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; examples in various states.  We have had families in our own local<br/>
&gt; Homeschool support group report problems.  Some counties are more invasive<br/>
&gt; then others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, you might want to ask for specifics from HSLDA.  It might also be a good<br/>
thing to remember that these people make 5 million a year from homeschoolers<br/>
who feel they might need those legal services... um.. . in essence they need<br/>
to keep you buying their snake oil.<br/>
<br/>
While there are pockets of problems and there are some states that require<br/>
more paperwork than others, widespread fear of the system is a thing of the<br/>
past.  The only state that I can think of that does not have a strong<br/>
homeschooling population is South Dakota, and even there homeschoolers are<br/>
not being harrasssed by social workers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a social worker at my door. She was nice and calm and rational.<br/>
Just like me.  We talked and she went away. No muss, no fuss.<br/>
<br/>
Which state do you live in?<br/>

If they&#39;re piled all in one place for purposes of trying to scare people into <br/>
joining HSLDA or something, then yes, it will look like the sky is falling.  <br/>
But statistically, it doesn&#39;t much happen.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be cynical, but much of the fear seems to me to have been created.  <br/>
Finding and feeding a need for a product is part of advertising.  <br/>

If you never register her, you probably will never have any problems <br/>
whatsoever.  <br/>
It&#39;s those who were in school and are pulled out who most need to be legal, <br/>
generally speaking.<br/>
<br/>
There is much less government oversight of who&#39;s where than most people <br/>
think.  Except at income tax time, you can be anywhere you want to be.  We <br/>
could all move to Alaska TODAY, legally (those of us who are in the U.S. <br/>
anyway &lt;g&gt;), just get in a truck and go.  <br/>

Yes, here in Massachusetts you have to have your<br/>
curriculum approved by the school board. Our<br/>
Superintendent met with me and did the presenting to<br/>
the board herself. I&#39;ve had no problems yet, knock on<br/>
wood, but if I ever do , they&#39;ll be sorry they messed<br/>

    This is always an option. Hardly any of the homeschoolers I knew in Santa <br/>
Fe, NM were registered (including myself) and in Maryland I knew a few people <br/>
who weren&#39;t. In Maryland I signed up with the school district, was found to <br/>
be not complying with the law because my daughter was an unschooler, and got <br/>
out of it by signing up with an umbrella group.<br/>
    Here in Ca there are so many options that everyone I&#39;ve met so far is <br/>
legal. I guess it depends on the individual inclination and how likely you <br/>
think you are to get &quot;caught.&quot; I doubt that many school districts have energy <br/>
to track down unregistered homeschoolers.</div>
