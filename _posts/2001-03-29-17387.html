<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034355992">Hi Everyone...<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you all get the unschooling newsletter, but we are doing<br/>
some of the Little Scavenger Hunt, and I wanted to post to the message<br/>
board listed, but can&#39;t find it!  Can someone point me in the right<br/>
direction?  I went to unschooling.com, and then message boards, but in<br/>
searching around in there, I cant find the scavenger hunt folder.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Ann</div>

<br/>
THAT IS MY FAULT&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was supposed to put up a scavenger-hunt folder right after the newsletter <br/>
came out, and (a long but boring story justifies it and not very well at all) <br/>
I DIDN&#39;T.  But I&#39;m going to right now.</div>
