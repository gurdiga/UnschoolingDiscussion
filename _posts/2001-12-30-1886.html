<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have an open house every other week but it&#39;s not nearly enough to satisfy <br/>
&gt; my kids needs for playmates. My oldest was into hockey and baseball, which <br/>
&gt; gave him a good-sized pool of niebourhood kids to play with but my 12yo <br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t into group sports and he&#39;s having a hard time in the friend area. I <br/>
&gt; need to find a way to attract some kids for him and his little sister.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Socialization is not an issue - in the sense of of our unschooling kids <br/>
becoming good citizens and good people and able to function effectively in <br/>
society. They can be a little eccentric, true, but what&#39;s wrong with that? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But, it really is true that socialization is an issue for many unschooling <br/>
kids - in the sense of having enough people around to hang out with as <br/>
extensively as they&#39;d like. I don&#39;t think we should pretend that it isn&#39;t <br/>
something to think about - something to talk about and figure out how to <br/>
handle. <br/>
<br/>
Some kids have fewer &quot;needs&quot; for an active social life and are more satisfied <br/>
with a really good friend or two than with lots of hustle and bustle and lots <br/>
of variety of friends. They are lucky. <br/>
<br/>
I have found that my teens often don&#39;t relate well with teens who go to <br/>
school. I&#39;m sure there are many out there  they&#39;d like perfectly well if they <br/>
got to know them, but frequently they find that the schooled teens&#39; concerns <br/>
seem shallow or boring and their behavior is annoying (they meet them in <br/>
classes - like gymnastics or theater or sports or Girl Scouts - and my kids <br/>
are put off by the attitude the schooled kids have toward the activity or <br/>
toward the adult leaders/teachers).<br/>
<br/>
So - they really relate best to other unschooling teens -- openmindedness and <br/>
a sense of life being an adventure is what they&#39;re after, I think. Here in <br/>
California we&#39;re lucky to have a great state-level organization that puts on <br/>
activities (campouts, conference) where kids can meet each other. And <br/>
Not-Back-to-School-Camp has made a gigantic difference....the kids get <br/>
together a few times a year in addition to camp and they have a LOT of online <br/>
togetherness. Roya is in Portland, Oregon, right now with a big group of <br/>
NBTSCers and there is another big group of them gathered up in Edmonton <br/>
Canada right now. In a couple of weeks a group will be meeting in Santa <br/>
Barbara. These kids are way way way cool - wonderful, interesting people so <br/>
filled with ideals and dreams and excitement to be alive!!!!<br/>
<br/>
But they are very spread out geographically and there is definitely a major <br/>
issue of money and time and safety for traveling and then there are the <br/>
long-distance phone bills!!! And there is a large amount of frustration for <br/>
my oldest daughter in not being able to just &quot;hang out&quot; with her friends on a <br/>
regular basis.<br/>

Where in CA are you? I&#39;m up in Northern CA, near<br/>

<br/>
This is the problem we have. Tamzin is 7 and doesn&#39;t<br/>
like to travel huge long distances (there&#39;s no way<br/>
she&#39;d want to go to Santa Barbara for a campout!).<br/>
She&#39;s also quite an introvert and takes a while to<br/>
warm up, especially in a group situation. We used to<br/>
go to home schooling camps in the UK and she&#39;d just be<br/>
making good connections and then it was time to go! So<br/>
for us, it&#39;s usually not a worthwhile trip unless it&#39;s<br/>
within a 3 to 4 hour drive. What Tamzin needs is mates<br/>
to hang out with (she likes marathon play dates). She<br/>
has a few good friends here now, but one of them may<br/>
be going back into public school (aaagh! She&#39;s already<br/>
super competitive!), so that one may fizzle out<br/>
because they live a 20 minute drive away as it is.<br/>
Another one is homeschooled in a more structured<br/>
fashion, has a pony, and church events to attend, and<br/>
has limited time for playdates (once every 2 weeks if<br/>
we&#39;re lucky). The other one is another unschooler and<br/>
we see a lot of them and have become &#39;best friends&#39;<br/>
(both mom and kid!). We have recently met another<br/>
unschooler, so hopefully we&#39;ll forge another bond.<br/>
We shall see what becomes of my advertising campaign<br/>
&lt;g&gt;.<br/>

mostly in Northern California -- Bay area and Santa Rosa area.<br/>
<br/>
Have you contacted the HSC county contact about finding other relaxed <br/>
homeschoolers in your area?  <br/>
<br/>
My experience with my young kids is that they are just fine making friends in <br/>
the local area -- through local hsing groups, soccer or girl scouts or other <br/>
activities or just in the neighborhood, etc. We didn&#39;t run into friend <br/>
problems until the kids hit their teens and became more &quot;particular.&quot; That&#39;s <br/>
when the long distances started to be an issue.<br/>

My local contact person is a Fundamentalist Christian<br/>
unschooler (her label, not mine). She took one look at<br/>
me at a p.e. day and that was that (I&#39;m a bit<br/>
&#39;alternative&#39; looking). I tried going to a few p.e.<br/>
days, but it was always an &#39;us and them&#39; attitude, so<br/>
I gave it up. I will keep up the search!<br/>

<br/>
Tamzin is pretty selective when it comes to playmates.<br/>
She&#39;s quite sensitive and has very strong ideas<br/>
regarding fair play and politeness. There are only 2<br/>
other kids on our street (sisters) and Tamzin tried to<br/>
play with them once. They were really rude and<br/>
unfriendly to her and so she doesn&#39;t want to play with<br/>
them again. She really doesn&#39;t like organized<br/>
activities very much, and so far is not interested in<br/>
4H, Brownies, or the like (she really balks at the<br/>
idea of a uniform). I figure if she gets desperate<br/>
enough for more friends she may decide to get involved<br/>
with a group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009120455">Hey, I did that quiz, and the top two cities were Little Rock, AR (where <br/>
I already own a house) and Fayetteville, AR, where my parents live. <br/>
 Memphis didn&#39;t even make it, and that&#39;s where I live now!<br/>
<br/>
I think the results are skewed to where you already know you want to <br/>
live.  There were some very interesting other choices, <br/>
though...including Albuquerque, which was 3rd!  <br/>

&lt;&lt; There were some very interesting other choices, <br/>
though...including Albuquerque, which was 3rd!   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only places I&#39;ve been that appealed to me were Austin (for the music and <br/>
the university), San Francisco/Berkeley/Oakland (for the crackly energy and <br/>
shopping and bright people), and only barely kind of, DEFINITELY for the <br/>
people and nothing else, Los Angeles and thereabout.<br/>
<br/>
But all of them are too humid and too crowded.<br/>
<br/>
England, but I&#39;d get homesick.  That&#39;s fantasyland.<br/>
<br/>
Albuquerque is fantasyland too, but not exotic, since I get to be here.<br/>
Albuquerque is actually the poor replacement for northern New Mexico, but I <br/>
like the advantages of malls, movies, buying milk any time of the day or <br/>
night, museums, free musical this&#39;n&#39;that, and theatre.  I kinda like living <br/>
without barbed wire.  Rural living in New Mexico seems always to involve <br/>
barbed wire and cactus.  Too prickly for my tastes!  &lt;LOL&gt;  The two and a <br/>
half acres I grew up in were totally fenced in barbed wire, and instead of <br/>
cactus we had some long-local single roses.  Big bushes full of old-timey red <br/>
roses. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
P.S. The quiz gave me Albuquerque as 16th choice, and there was no pattern to <br/>
the recommendations--Medford, Shreveport, Eau Claire, somewhere in New <br/>
England, Sacramento...  The 9th or so was Las Cruces NM.   Maybe it&#39;s because <br/>
I said &quot;don&#39;t care&quot; a lot, and that I don&#39;t need to go outside much! &lt;g&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335095154"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Pick<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oroville! It&#39;s only 15 minutes away from Paradise &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
What&#39;s your decision making based on? I researched the<br/>
area extensively and may be able to answer questions<br/>
for you about various places (except Redding - I<br/>
wanted to live in a smaller town, so didn&#39;t look into<br/>
it).&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
We were originally looking as far as Oregon, but it&#39;s a little too far from<br/>
family and as I have to travel for business I&#39;m not wild about crossing<br/>
mountain ranges to get to the SF Bay area (and I avoid flying whenever<br/>
possible, I&#39;m a car kinda girl), so we made a northern border of Redding<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Our criteria is to get my youngest daughter&#39;s lungs out of the San Joaquin<br/>
Valley. We didn&#39;t like south, we can&#39;t afford west, and east puts us quickly<br/>
outside the range of major freeways (see travel requirements above). So we<br/>
started north up the I-5 corridor (we live in Tracy, just south of Stockton,<br/>
right now).<br/>
<br/>
I like the looks and size of Redding (gotta love living in a place where you<br/>
get to look at Mt. Shasta, though we&#39;re as likely to live in one of the<br/>
small towns around it, like Anderson), Wally&#39;s father lives in Oroville and<br/>
we like the town, and Tehama County (Red Bluff & surrounds) is convenient<br/>
right on 5.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve spend a bit of time poking around all three, we plan to do more of<br/>
that this winter and spring (coinciding with what book sales I can find, of<br/>
course! &lt;g&gt;), with a hopeful moving date over the summer, but maybe as late<br/>
as this time next year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626420795">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Hey, I did that quiz, and the top two cities were<br/>
Little Rock, AR (where I already own a house) and<br/>
Fayetteville, AR, where my parents live.  Memphis<br/>
didn&#39;t even make it, and that&#39;s where I live now!<br/>
<br/>
I think the results are skewed to where you already<br/>
know you want to live.  There were some very<br/>
interesting other choices, though...including<br/>
Albuquerque, which was 3rd!  <br/>
<br/>
Tuck&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If sure the whole thing is skewed! Tamzin took the<br/>
quiz too. Her ideal town is where she knows everyone<br/>
(the proverbial &#39;one horse town&#39;). I think her ideal<br/>
population count would be in the low hundreds. The<br/>
smallest town the site came up with had a population<br/>
of 1,700. Obviously, they don&#39;t have &#39;every&#39; town in<br/>
the US listed &lt;g&gt;. A lot of the towns they recommended<br/>
for her were in Alaska, LOL! (as if I could live with<br/>
that much snow and cold!). The good news is that<br/>
something about doing that quiz (maybe because none of<br/>
the picks was in CA) settled her mind about being here<br/>
(not that she&#39;s unhappy here). She&#39;s now decided that<br/>
she wants &quot;to live in this house for the rest of her<br/>
life&quot; &lt;g&gt;, and that she loves Paradise.<br/>
