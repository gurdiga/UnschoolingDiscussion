<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542554603">Well, I was thinking that many of you are right.  Being a certified teacher <br/>
really makes it tough to begin to think like an unschooler.  Although I only <br/>
taught for a few years, I was in school for many years before that and all that <br/>
school stuff was really ingrained in me.  I&#39;m trying hard to get over it now <br/>
that I&#39;m home with the little ones!  I&#39;m not sure why she felt she needed a <br/>
master&#39;s degree to HS but maybe she just wanted one...and I think that&#39;s okay <br/>
too.  I&#39;m sitting here thinking to myself that I could&#39;ve saved myself a lot of $ <br/>
by skipping the master&#39;s degree that I&#39;m not planning on using in that career <br/>
at least... and it&#39;s time to pay my monthly student loan now too!<br/>
As for potty training:  they&#39;ll use the toilet when they are ready.  My son <br/>
went to daycare as a toddler and they let them sit on the potty when ever they <br/>
changed diapers.  WHen he was 3 he just started always peeing on the potty, at <br/>
that time we went to underwear because I was tired of spending $ on diapers.  <br/>
Thick terry underwear with plastic pants contained most accidents.  Since he <br/>
was home with me by then it didn&#39;t matter if he wasn&#39;t trained.  Then one day <br/>
he started pooping on the potty too!   But they do it when they are <br/>
ready...I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t be wearing a pull-up when she gets her driver&#39;s license!  <br/>
