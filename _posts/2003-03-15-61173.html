<div id="ygrps-yiv-421547394">I have a problem with Sierra that I have been working on for quite awhile now with no luck. Sure could use some words of wisdom. For the last couple of months, I&#39;ve noticed a change in Sierra. She&#39;s not as easy going as she use to be. Meaning that she is being more troublesome than she ever was. She&#39;s fighting more with Joseph and Alyssa. She&#39;s whining and complaining more and just harder to deal with. There has been nothing of a change that I know of at all with our house or her friends or how we do things. I thought maybe it was a stage so I&#39;ve been working extra hard to do the proper thing when she gets upset. You know about the crying and that has been more so also, although she&#39;s always been like that. She&#39;s almost defiant about things and blames everyone else when something happens. <br/>
<br/>
Recent example today that finally made me write and ask for HELP!<br/>
<br/>
I was cutting Sierra&#39;s nails in the playroom. I was sitting on the step stool and she was on my lap. I did one hand and the phone rang. When I came back to the playroom, she was almost on the verge of tears and Joseph was asking her what he did wrong. Come to find out that Joseph and her were talking and he did something that upset her. She said to him that he hurt her feelings and to stop. So far so good. Joseph really didn&#39;t have a clue as to what he said to upset her. Now Sierra and I had a very long talk just this morning about when Joseph is bugging her, she can&#39;t just say you&#39;re bugging me and stop. She has to let him know exactly what he&#39;s doing. Bugging me is not clear enough for Joseph. And in fact during this last episode, Joseph was even saying to her that same thing. He just didn&#39;t understand what he said. So I explained again that if she told him, he would know not to say things like that to her. She refused to say what he said. Joseph even asked her to come into the hallway thinking maybe she just didn&#39;t want to in front of me. She refused that also. So I explained that it was up to her to decide. How could Joseph stop upsetting her when he didn&#39;t know what it was he did? She wouldn&#39;t say a word. So I let it go and asked her to come over on my lap so I could finish her nails. The 3 kids were wanting to go outside and Joseph was waiting for her. She told me I cut her nails already. I told her I only did one hand. She refused again to come to me and let me finish. Now I&#39;m only about 4 feet away from her and the space didn&#39;t allow me to go to her and do the job. I asked her 3 times and she looked me right in the face and said not a word but didn&#39;t move. Today was the first day I was feeling like I wasn&#39;t dying and I just got very upset. I know I didn&#39;t help things but I lost it. I reached over and took her by the arm and brought her to my lap and cut her nails while she screamed in my ear. I told her it would probably be best if she went to her room. When I suggest they go to their room, it&#39;s to cool down and they never have to stay there or even go. But she went and screamed and cried in there. <br/>
<br/>
After a while, I went in and tried to talk to her and she said she didn&#39;t want to talk to me about it. I left and she fell asleep. When Joe tried to go in to her, she started to cry again and didn&#39;t want to talk. Later she came out like nothing was wrong and we haven&#39;t said another word about it.<br/>
<br/>
Now it wasn&#39;t that she was tired or I&#39;ve been really sick. This is the kind of thing I&#39;ve been trying to work out for a while. I know I should have left the nail thing go. But it wouldn&#39;t have helped the situation with Joseph and her. And to be honest, I&#39;ve heard the two of them before and she makes things up about Joseph. Saying he said something he didn&#39;t.  How can I talk to her about how to handle things when she won&#39;t talk to me? All I get is I don&#39;t know and he&#39;s bugging me. Joseph is not a bugging kind of kid although they both have their moments. Help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649315081">Another thing I wanted to add about Sierra. When she gets upset with Joseph, she just whines his name over and over. I have spoken to her hundreds of times about how he just tunes her out when she does that. That to be heard she has to say something. Use her words to say what is bothering her. She still does the same thing. It wasn&#39;t but 2 hours after that last episode that she was back to whining his name again because she said he was bugging her. And there have been times when she does that and I am right there watching, and he&#39;s not anywhere near her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672322572">Joseph might be more of a bugging kind of kid then you know.<br/>
<br/>
If Sierra isn&#39;t talking with you she doesn&#39;t know how.   What Joseph is<br/>
doing to her is probably subtle enough that she doesn&#39;t know how to<br/>
express it beyond &quot;he&#39;s bugging me&quot;.    It&#39;s possible he doesn&#39;t really<br/>
have a clue, but it&#39;s possible he does and part of the fun is she can&#39;t<br/>
or won&#39;t tell you all about it.<br/>
<br/>
If she looked you in the face honestly and still wouldn&#39;t tell you, Mary,<br/>
she wants to communicate with you.  <br/>
She wants to but can&#39;t for reasons you&#39;ll have to figure out.<br/>
<br/>
You know she doesn&#39;t want you to be upset with her.   She doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
feel the way she does.<br/>
<br/>
Can you go someplace nice with her, just you and her, and talk?   Drive<br/>
somewhere beautiful and just sit and talk?    Tell her you love her and<br/>
you don&#39;t want her to be sad about Joseph.  Just start there and don&#39;t<br/>
push her to tell you more than she can.   But ask her frequently, when<br/>
you&#39;re alone with her.  Just because she&#39;s seven and can talk doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean she knows how to sort out and put into words, her feeling about<br/>
whatever Joseph is doing.   <br/>
<br/>
Can Sierra sleep with you?   If she could spend some really cozy and safe<br/>
time with you she might find a way to tell you.   Sometimes it&#39;s easier<br/>
to talk into the darkness.   If she can just express enough for you to<br/>
get an idea, then you can help Joseph too.   <br/>
<br/>
I am very sensitive to repeated sound.   When I was little my brother<br/>
found out I couldn&#39;t stand to hear a noise over and over again and he<br/>
would come near me and make this clicking sound, softly with his tongue. <br/>
 He did it to bother me but I didn&#39;t know what it was called, and saying<br/>
&quot;he&#39;s bugging me&quot; was the best I could do.  Sometimes he would sit across<br/>
the room from me, wait until I looked at him, and make that motion with<br/>
his mouth.   Even if I couldn&#39;t hear it, I thought I could, because I&#39;d<br/>
heard it so much before, and I knew he was just trying to make me crazy. <br/>
 It drove me wild.   I had once told my mom what he was doing, and she<br/>
said &quot;don&#39;t let him bother you&quot; as if I had those skill to ignore him or<br/>
turn off my sensitivity to his little noise.   She didn&#39;t understand how<br/>
much it bothered me and that I couldn&#39;t just ignore it.<br/>

sometimes get angry with his brother and not remember what Dallen did to &quot;bug <br/>
him&quot;.  All Phil can verbalize is that Dallen is bugging him.  I commend him <br/>
for that because that is progress.  Used to be that he would just reach out <br/>
and hit Dallen and he isn&#39;t, now he is starting to name the feeling, to some <br/>
extent.  But I believe that he really don&#39;t remember what it was that started <br/>
it.  They separate for a few minutes so that Dallen isn&#39;t bugging him any <br/>
more.  Then Phillip will come up with some sort of game that he wants to play <br/>
and they will move on.  <br/>
<br/>
She may not remember what was said or done.  And maybe the fingernail thing <br/>
was just enough to push her over the edge, so to speak.  Sometimes just <br/>
changing the activity or doing something else with her so that she is not <br/>
with the person who &quot;bugged her,&quot; even for just a few minutes.  It was good <br/>
that she was able to label it and recognize that something was &quot;not right.&quot;  <br/>
She was verbalizing and not throwing things or hitting etc. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435208301">Hey Mary....<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s probably not much help, but I have two very high maintenance <br/>
kids with lots of trauma probs and from your descriptions whatever is going <br/>
on Sierra is in high stress mode.  I&#39;m sure your gut is sensing this which <br/>
is why you are emailing for help, yada yada.... All I can offer, regardless <br/>
of the source of trouble is that if you are not able to determine the <br/>
problem right away, perhaps reduce the stress directed at Sierra to solve <br/>
the problem as to what &quot;is the problem?&quot;  When she melts down or goes <br/>
silent, perhaps just put everything on hold, reassure her that you know she <br/>
is feeling horrible and confused and whatever and hold her and hug and <br/>
physically connect with her again to reduce the stress level inside her <br/>
(and you!).<br/>
<br/>
With my kids I discovered that the situation often escalated itself when I <br/>
would attempt to resolve it just from the stress of trying to &quot;get to the <br/>
bottom of it, right then and there!&quot;  (You get so tired of it happening all <br/>
the time, I know!!)  But, it was usually too complicated or obscure to be <br/>
dealt with in an emotional moment anyway and I was better off just dropping <br/>
the issue, dealing with the emotions present and then later trying to help <br/>
figure out what went on......<br/>
