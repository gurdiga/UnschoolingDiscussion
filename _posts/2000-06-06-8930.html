Usborne Books has a great series on Piano that I think an older child could <br/>
look at and use for self-teaching.  They are usually sold through home <br/>
representatives, like Avon, but I&#39;m pretty sure they have a web site and <br/>
could hook you up with a local consultant.  They are also fairly <br/>
inexpensive.  I have a few of them myself as I was going to attempt to <br/>
reteach myself some piano and thought maybe the kids would get interested.<br/>
<br/>
As for reading, my son saw ads for the Phonics Game on TV and begged me to <br/>
get it.  Of course, it&#39;s $200, but I knew that my neighbor&#39;s had it and that <br/>
their son had never played with it, so I borrowed theirs.  It&#39;s a great game <br/>
and the kids really enjoy playing it.  I don&#39;t think my three year old <br/>
really &quot;gets&quot; it, but I&#39;m sure she is getting something out of it.<br/>
<br/>
We also had the computer storybook version of Dr. Seuss&#39;s ABC&#39;s and I think <br/>
that that is where my son initially picked up his letter sounds.  He <br/>
recognized all of his letters by the time he was 18 months old and we were <br/>
just as surprised as everyone else!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with everything.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447307417">Hi Becky:<br/>
<br/>
This is only what we do so take it witha huge chunk of salt (the standard <br/>
warning! :):) ).<br/>
<br/>
Reading:  I have two kids.  My now 7 yo son started to read with very little <br/>
prompting at age 4 1/2.  When we saw he was catching on, we read with him a <br/>
lot and still do.  My daughter is now 5 1/2.  She has been on the verge of <br/>
reading forever (it seems) -- knows the letters and sounds and a few sight <br/>
words.  But the whole reading thing has just not clicked yet.  So, with her, <br/>
I get a huge stack of books from the library every week, read with her a lot, <br/>
answer her questions and help her realize when she _is_ reading.  Sometimes <br/>
she does not acknowledge that she is reading because it&#39;s not a whole story.  <br/>
But if she can read a color (she&#39;s a big artist!!) or a sign or a phrase I <br/>
praise her for her &quot;good reading.&quot;  Bits and pieces are starting to click but <br/>
I think she will be my &quot;late bloomer&quot; in this regard.  OTOH, she had me show <br/>
her how to use her brother&#39;s Math Shark game the other day because she wanted <br/>
to practice her subtraction and we made up a number line and that helped her <br/>
(her brother was never interested in that sort of visual device).  So maybe <br/>
that&#39;s what her brain is working on right now.  Along with being a kid -- <br/>
which takes up a lot of her energy!!<br/>
<br/>
Piano/music:  My son is now taking formal piano less.  For the last few <br/>
months.  He just had his first recital on Saturday and played two songs <br/>
beautifully.  He enjoys the lessons, hates the practice, and does quite well <br/>
with as much practice as he chooses to do.  His teacher totally &quot;gets&quot; him.  <br/>
She does not nag him to do more than he does and he is proceceding at his own <br/>
pace.   And doing quite well with it.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter, meanwhile, has just finished up her dance lessons for the year.  <br/>
They were a lot of fun and gave her a taste of a &quot;non-Mom&quot; class.  And she <br/>
loved playing with the other little girls.  There were no boys in her class <br/>
but one in the class before hers so I&#39;m hoping she&#39;ll see that mix as well <br/>
along the way.  Anyway, it was a fun, positive experience for her.  She will <br/>
probably want to continue when they start up again this fall.<br/>
<br/>
My son also takes Tae Kwon Do.  He goes to the hour-long class from 3-5 times <br/>
a week.  Last week his school put on an exhibition for one of the local elem <br/>
schools and he was asked to participate, so that was a pat on the back and he <br/>
had fun.  Also they test periodically for the next belt and have to learn <br/>
kicks and memorize steps (called forms) and they are learning a smattering of <br/>
Korean and it is a great palling around with the guys (with some awesome <br/>
girls mixed in!) time.   This will continue thru the summer as often as he <br/>
likes.  My only &quot;rule&quot; on this is I won&#39;t go anywhere on the weekend if I can <br/>
help it so he doesn&#39;t go to Saturday class.  Of course, all their testing <br/>
(and every other sort of recital) seems to be on Sat morning so there goes <br/>
another &quot;rule.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My son also just finished up for the year in the on-line math class he is <br/>
taking.  He did very well and went thru the material at his own pace and will <br/>
continue with the class in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, we do a few outside activities.  Some unschoolers do not.  <br/>
The beauty of hsing!!  They have generally been a positive experience (except <br/>
for one piano teacher who ran a class that was more of a play group than a <br/>
real music class and then gave me a fight when I wanted my $$ back -- but I <br/>
got it -- $200 is a lot of $$ around here!!).  The kids like these classes <br/>
and I think they supplement the other things we do nicely.  I&#39;m sure the <br/>
choice in activities will change many times but we like getting out and <br/>
about.  And at least I know where all my $$ is going!!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes our getting out and about is free tho.  There are lots of nice <br/>
parks and beaches and nature trails around so we are also just literally <br/>
outside a lot (Florida).<br/>
<br/>
And one more thing on reading:  get you child a library card!!!  Mine love <br/>
that whole idea of having their own card (even if it is in my purse) and we <br/>
can get 3 X the books now!!<br/>
<br/>
Well, you caught me on a chatty morning, didn&#39;t you!  :):)<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

&gt; Hello Nance, Amy, Bonnie, Sue, Cindy, and others! I enjoy just hearing<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; you are out there, living your lives in a similar way, so I can get ideas<br/>
&gt; or just say &quot;that sounds neat&quot; or &quot;me too.&quot;  I forgot to get specific<br/>
&gt; earlier, so here are some things I want to know your thoughts on:<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s your approach to reading? My daughter is almost 6 and has been on<br/>
&gt; the verge of reading for awhile without really taking off yet. Do you just<br/>
&gt; read to them until they figure it out? Do you talk about some of the<br/>
sounds<br/>
&gt; letters make or ignore phonics completely? Have regular reading practice<br/>
&gt; where I listen to her and tell her the words or never ask her to read<br/>
&gt; unless it&#39;s her idea? Cindy, it sounds like you have a very advanced<br/>
&gt; reader, what are Ruth Beechick books and BOB books? I don&#39;t mean to sound<br/>
&gt; like I&#39;m rushing it, but there&#39;s so much she can explore on her own when<br/>
&gt; she can read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have some thoughts on unschooling music or giving music<br/>
&gt; lessons? My daughter has expressed interest in playing the piano and my<br/>
&gt; sister, my mother, and I can all play and so there&#39;s plenty of free<br/>
&gt; teachers, but I want her to love music too, so I&#39;m uncertain about lessons<br/>
&gt; (I took lessons until about age 10, then hated having to practice). I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; read that playing an instrument is beneficial in both emotional and<br/>
&gt; intellectual ways, but I also read that a lot of the best musicians are<br/>
&gt; self-taught.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your input!<br/>
&gt; Becky in AR<br/>
