<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373273275">Ok here is my take on this subject....I personally feel other than<br/>
single moms who need to work.Why keep having children if we are not<br/>
there to raise them.I wouldn&#39;t want to have babies if I had to let<br/>
someone else raise them.I never understood this.I raised 4 sons.20,19,18<br/>
and 12.We did without a lot of material things that others had,but it<br/>
was well worth it.My older sons always say to me,mom I am so glad you<br/>
are here for us,none of their friends moms are ever home.Their friends<br/>
tell my sons they are so lucky they have a mom who is there.<br/>
NO amount of money,prestige,etc...is worth not being there for my sons.<br/>
I have started in the past 6 months doing business from home,and I don&#39;t<br/>
have to  but I enjoy doing something for myself after 20 years,that<br/>
doesn&#39;t require me to be away from my youngest who is still home and my<br/>
husband.<br/>
When I used to go to school conferences,hardly any parents showed up due<br/>
to full time jobs.<br/>
To me if you want to work full time away from home and be a good parent<br/>
something has to suffer,and it seems to me it is the children.<br/>
My mom was always home for me,and I loved it!<br/>
My husbands mom was always working and he always was alone,and he hated<br/>
it!<br/>
We do without a lot of material things,but we are so happy,the kids are<br/>
happy.!Being a fulltime mom has always been a top honor in my book!<br/>
I had a friend who couldn&#39;t wait to have a baby.3 months later she was<br/>
working again making 225 dollars a week,and spending half of that on<br/>
childcare,I can&#39;t understand why you would leave your baby for a piddly<br/>
amount of money?Or for any reason.<br/>
I am not putting down anyone who works.There are plenty of women who<br/>
need to.I just believe kids and teens need their moms!My 2 cents....Deb<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344991916">Re:  feminism etc.<br/>
<br/>
Most, if not all, of the posts I have read on this thread reference the <br/>
poster&#39;s personal experience -- i.e., my sis did this, my neighbor did this, <br/>
my mom did this, I did this.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel it is important to remember that there is wide, wide world out there <br/>
that has absolutely nothing to do with our own personal experiences.  <br/>
<br/>
To base judgements about feminism (or any other ism) on our own narrow <br/>
experiences seems mistaken to me.<br/>
<br/>
And I feel it is important to remember that there may be points during one&#39;s <br/>
life when one set of circumstances fits and then another period where another <br/>
set fits.  A woman may want or need (whether a &quot;real&quot; economic or personal, <br/>
perceived need) to work at one point and may not want or need to at another <br/>
point in her life.  Children may or may not be a factor in any of this at <br/>
various stages.  One may or may not have children at various ages -- younger <br/>
or older.  One may have a career.  A calling. Or a job.  <br/>
<br/>
The nuances of each individual woman&#39;s history are not easily caught in broad <br/>
sweeping statements about whether one &quot;should&quot; be a working mom or an at-home <br/>
mom.  IMO<br/>
<br/>
And a lot of factors come together, along with feminism, to present the <br/>
choices available to women today.  (One tiny example -- there weren&#39;t any <br/>
computers available when I was make career choices way back in the &#39;70s.)  <br/>
<br/>
While I enjoy hearing all sorts of discussions, including those involving <br/>
feminism, I hope that we can all step back from our own personal experinces <br/>
and realize that life is long and complicated and we cannot make all of these <br/>
choices for others until we have walked a mile in their shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Nance (at-home-Mom, feminist, former corporate employee -- happy with all of <br/>
these choices (and thank the feminist movement for fighting for real choice <br/>
-- no matter how imperfect the progress so far) at different stages in my <br/>
life)</div>

I did not think that my post was judgemental.I stated it was my<br/>
opinion.I am entitled to mine as well as everyone else is to theirs.I<br/>
didn&#39;t condemn anyone.I rarely post anything on list such as this for<br/>
this very reason.I made sure i didn&#39;t come across as my way is the only<br/>
way.If  I didn&#39;t make this clear.I apologize.I feel strongly about my<br/>
beliefs,as do other people theirs.I value everyones input! <br/>
Why is it a problem when someone voice their opinion and they say it is<br/>
just that,their opinion,in this case when I posted mine.<br/>
Maybe I should have worded it differently.<br/>
I feel that a mom should be home with her baby,I didn&#39;t say I was<br/>

&gt; Hi...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know I haven&#39;t introduced myself, but I have to reply to this topic. So, a brief<br/>
&gt; intro and then my reply. I&#39;m Lainie...mother of Monk (3). I am currently employed<br/>
&gt; full-time outside the home, but I will be quitting my job when my second (Cole) is<br/>
&gt; born in October. I live in Austin, TX...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think some of you have unrealistic expectations, and this thread is starting to<br/>
&gt; make me feel like I&#39;ve subscribed to Dr-Laura-dotcom. When I got pregnant with<br/>
&gt; Monk, it was a complete surprise. We were not prepared financially to have a child<br/>
&gt; and have one parent at home, but we were not so unprepared that I felt I needed to<br/>
&gt; abort or put the baby up for adoption.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A lot of what has been posted on this thread is posted under the assumption that<br/>
&gt; the MOTHER must stay at home with the baby. While I believe that is the ideal,<br/>
&gt; particularly during the first year of a baby&#39;s life, it&#39;s just not possible for<br/>
&gt; everyone, and I don&#39;t believe it helps ANYONE to be judgmental towards their<br/>
&gt; lifestyle (I struggle with this, too, when I encounter women who spend thousands of<br/>
&gt; dollars on fertility treatment and end up sending their child to daycare within the<br/>
&gt; first 2 months of life). Since both DH and I had to work, and I was the one with<br/>
&gt; the best earning potential, my husband opted to work graveyards on the weekends so<br/>
&gt; we didn&#39;t have to use daycare. It wasn&#39;t easy. It ISN&#39;T easy. But it&#39;s what we HAD<br/>
&gt; to do to get by. Thus far, Monk has shown no ill effect, is completely bonded to<br/>
&gt; his father AND to me. I was able to nurse until Monk weaned himself, and Monk has<br/>
&gt; the benefit of a close, trusting relationship with his father.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, there are plenty of people in this world who have loving relationships<br/>
&gt; with their children in spite of their use of childcare. I think it&#39;s wrong to<br/>
&gt; condemn every woman, as well as the feminist movement in general (if you want to<br/>
&gt; see true feminism in action, check out the community at hipmama.com - a very<br/>
&gt; SUPPORTIVE environment for SAHMs and Mamas who work outside the home as well).<br/>
&gt; Believe it or not, the feminist movement provided women with CHOICES. I think the<br/>
&gt; thing that makes being a stay at home mom so amazing is that it&#39;s a choice you have<br/>
&gt; made, rather than a societal directive & I&#39;m wondering if there wouldn&#39;t be more<br/>
&gt; resentful parents and more messed up kids if mamas were FORCED to stay at home.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s no gender associated with desiring to give your child the love and<br/>
&gt; nurturing he/she needs. My husband does it every day of the week, and he&#39;s about as<br/>
&gt; &quot;masculine&quot; as they come...as well, I don&#39;t feel I will be any more &quot;femme&quot; when I<br/>
&gt; am at home with the children (and I&#39;m *still* not going to shave!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m honestly shocked that this thread has arisen amidst all of the cool,<br/>
&gt; non-mainstream, supportive ideas I&#39;ve seen here. Right now I&#39;m wondering if I truly<br/>
&gt; belong on this list at all. Discussion of a topic is one thing, but complete<br/>
&gt; dismissal of the opposing view as wrong or immoral is the hallmark of intolerance<br/>
&gt; and hatred.<br/>

&gt; I think some of you have unrealistic expectations, and this thread is starting to<br/>
&gt; make me feel like I&#39;ve subscribed to Dr-Laura-dotcom. When I got pregnant with<br/>
&gt; Monk, it was a complete surprise. We were not prepared financially to have a child<br/>
&gt; and have one parent at home, but we were not so unprepared that I felt I needed to<br/>
&gt; abort or put the baby up for adoption.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A lot of what has been posted on this thread is posted under the assumption that<br/>
&gt; the MOTHER must stay at home with the baby. While I believe that is the ideal,<br/>
&gt; particularly during the first year of a baby&#39;s life, it&#39;s just not possible for<br/>
&gt; everyone, and I don&#39;t believe it helps ANYONE to be judgmental towards their<br/>
&gt; lifestyle (I struggle with this, too, when I encounter women who spend thousands of<br/>
&gt; dollars on fertility treatment and end up sending their child to daycare within the<br/>
&gt; first 2 months of life). Since both DH and I had to work, and I was the one with<br/>
&gt; the best earning potential, my husband opted to work graveyards on the weekends so<br/>
&gt; we didn&#39;t have to use daycare. It wasn&#39;t easy. It ISN&#39;T easy. But it&#39;s what we HAD<br/>
&gt; to do to get by. Thus far, Monk has shown no ill effect, is completely bonded to<br/>
&gt; his father AND to me. I was able to nurse until Monk weaned himself, and Monk has<br/>
&gt; the benefit of a close, trusting relationship with his father.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, there are plenty of people in this world who have loving relationships<br/>
&gt; with their children in spite of their use of childcare. I think it&#39;s wrong to<br/>
&gt; condemn every woman, as well as the feminist movement in general (if you want to<br/>
&gt; see true feminism in action, check out the community at hipmama.com - a very<br/>
&gt; SUPPORTIVE environment for SAHMs and Mamas who work outside the home as well).<br/>
&gt; Believe it or not, the feminist movement provided women with CHOICES. I think the<br/>
&gt; thing that makes being a stay at home mom so amazing is that it&#39;s a choice you have<br/>
&gt; made, rather than a societal directive & I&#39;m wondering if there wouldn&#39;t be more<br/>
&gt; resentful parents and more messed up kids if mamas were FORCED to stay at home.<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s no gender associated with desiring to give your child the love and<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m honestly shocked that this thread has arisen amidst all of the cool,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111018318">I think what you wrote shows fully that full time day care is *not* needed<br/>
much of the time.  You and your husband made a choice to have a parent at<br/>
home with your child full time, it just was a shared thing.  Would it have<br/>
been easier for you both to work during the day and stick your son in day<br/>
care?  Probably.  But you chose not to.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel that the mother is the most important parent in the early years of<br/>
a child&#39;s life, primarily because I believe that nursing is best for babies,<br/>
and dad&#39;s can&#39;t nurse.  BUT, if the choice is between dad and a stranger, of<br/>
course dad is far better!<br/>

home.  My hubbie stayed home for 4 months of Zak&#39;s life and I worked outside <br/>

and then switched more recently to where I&#39;m at home the most.  We are <br/>
working towards going back to a more even split so that we both get out <br/>
mental needs to be with adults met as well as our needs to be with our kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I find that people who use daycare are very defensive about that choice.  I <br/>
wonder why that is?  It still comes down to money.... I would love someone to <br/>
tell me the beneift of Daycare for a baby or toddler?  I have yet to find <br/>
anyone who can give me that answer.  There are plenty of answers as to why it <br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; (&quot;What would<br/>
&gt;  you do if money didn&#39;t matter&quot; can be quite unrealistic, when it does).<br/>
It<br/>
&gt;  is unfair to suggest that people who use day care per se don&#39;t love their<br/>
&gt;  children as much or aren&#39;t as fit parents as people who stay home with<br/>
them.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The reason to ask the question is so that people take a look at the way<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; are currently making money and realize they can make money doing something<br/>
&gt; they love rather than something to just make money.... Money isn&#39;t the<br/>
goal<br/>
&gt; freedom is... Money just pays the bills we choose to run up.  The majority<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; my clients want to do something different with their lives as right now<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; are just in &quot;jobs&quot; rather than living a lifestyle that gives them the<br/>
freedom<br/>
&gt; to all the things they love, including staying at home with their kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Grown ups who choose to send their babies and toddlers to daycare and not<br/>
&gt; good parents by definition... In order to be good at something you<br/>
actually<br/>
&gt; have to do it and if you are in one place (your bosses office) and your<br/>
&gt; children and in another (a daycare institution) then you are not doing the<br/>
&gt; job of parenting.  If you told your employee that you were a good employee<br/>
&gt; and then proceeded to tell her when you wouldn&#39;t be available because of<br/>
&gt; other comittments the employer would look at your like you were crazy and<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be hired.  The damage that has been and is being done by daycare<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; being well documented in this country.  I can&#39;t speak for other countries.<br/>
&gt; Daycare is for parents not for babies and toddlers.  I can see using<br/>
daycare<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;ve husband or wife died or some tragedy happened whereby you are<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; only one to take care of your kids needs, but women go around getting<br/>
knocked<br/>
&gt; up because they  miss the love and affection they didn&#39;t get from their<br/>
&gt; parents and they believe they have a right to get it from someone else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sure I&#39;m judgmental about daycare... It&#39;s a lie to pretend that everyone<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; open to absoutely everything.  We judge people&#39;s lifestyles and choices<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; then decide if we want to be in relationships with them.  It&#39;s how the<br/>
world<br/>
&gt; works.  If I see a homeless person I&#39;m not going to bring him into my<br/>
house<br/>
&gt; and befriend him, because I see that lifestyle as a choice that I don&#39;t<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to be involved in.  The same goes for parents who put their kids in<br/>
daycare.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to be involved with people who don&#39;t value their children<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; money.... Because that&#39;s what it comes down to.  &gt;<br/>
&gt; By the way the daycare issue is part of my thesis and thoroughly<br/>
researched.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-847744510">Hi...<br/>
<br/>
I know I haven&#39;t introduced myself, but I have to reply to this topic. So, a brief<br/>
intro and then my reply. I&#39;m Lainie...mother of Monk (3). I am currently employed<br/>
full-time outside the home, but I will be quitting my job when my second (Cole) is<br/>
born in October. I live in Austin, TX...<br/>
<br/>
I think some of you have unrealistic expectations, and this thread is starting to<br/>
make me feel like I&#39;ve subscribed to Dr-Laura-dotcom. When I got pregnant with<br/>
Monk, it was a complete surprise. We were not prepared financially to have a child<br/>
and have one parent at home, but we were not so unprepared that I felt I needed to<br/>
abort or put the baby up for adoption.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of what has been posted on this thread is posted under the assumption that<br/>
the MOTHER must stay at home with the baby. While I believe that is the ideal,<br/>
particularly during the first year of a baby&#39;s life, it&#39;s just not possible for<br/>
everyone, and I don&#39;t believe it helps ANYONE to be judgmental towards their<br/>
lifestyle (I struggle with this, too, when I encounter women who spend thousands of<br/>
dollars on fertility treatment and end up sending their child to daycare within the<br/>
first 2 months of life). Since both DH and I had to work, and I was the one with<br/>
the best earning potential, my husband opted to work graveyards on the weekends so<br/>
we didn&#39;t have to use daycare. It wasn&#39;t easy. It ISN&#39;T easy. But it&#39;s what we HAD<br/>
to do to get by. Thus far, Monk has shown no ill effect, is completely bonded to<br/>
his father AND to me. I was able to nurse until Monk weaned himself, and Monk has<br/>
the benefit of a close, trusting relationship with his father.<br/>
<br/>
However, there are plenty of people in this world who have loving relationships<br/>
with their children in spite of their use of childcare. I think it&#39;s wrong to<br/>
condemn every woman, as well as the feminist movement in general (if you want to<br/>
see true feminism in action, check out the community at hipmama.com - a very<br/>
SUPPORTIVE environment for SAHMs and Mamas who work outside the home as well).<br/>
Believe it or not, the feminist movement provided women with CHOICES. I think the<br/>
thing that makes being a stay at home mom so amazing is that it&#39;s a choice you have<br/>
made, rather than a societal directive & I&#39;m wondering if there wouldn&#39;t be more<br/>
resentful parents and more messed up kids if mamas were FORCED to stay at home.<br/>
There&#39;s no gender associated with desiring to give your child the love and<br/>
nurturing he/she needs. My husband does it every day of the week, and he&#39;s about as<br/>
&quot;masculine&quot; as they come...as well, I don&#39;t feel I will be any more &quot;femme&quot; when I<br/>
am at home with the children (and I&#39;m *still* not going to shave!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m honestly shocked that this thread has arisen amidst all of the cool,<br/>
non-mainstream, supportive ideas I&#39;ve seen here. Right now I&#39;m wondering if I truly<br/>
belong on this list at all. Discussion of a topic is one thing, but complete<br/>
dismissal of the opposing view as wrong or immoral is the hallmark of intolerance<br/>
and hatred.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t feel at all attacked, and I don&#39;t think I was specifically talking about your<br/>
post when I was posting. I am, however, somewhat surprised at the anti-feminist tone of a<br/>
lot of the posts on this thread. I was trying to address that in my post, and wasn&#39;t<br/>
addressing any one specific person. As far as you having a right to your opinion, I<br/>
agree! My post was just a statement of my opinion, as before I posted it, it seemed that<br/>
there was only one opinion being offered.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969037922">Wow! I go to bed and when I wake up I find this discussion which makes<br/>
feel quite ill to read. This degree of judgementalism on an unschooling<br/>
list where we discuss things like listening to our children, letting<br/>
them follow their own learning inclinations, letting them follow their<br/>
hearts, letting them learn at their ouw pace, in their own style, in<br/>
their own way, trusting them to learn what they need to know, letting<br/>
them find their own path in life etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
But hey, all that stuff is, apparently, only valid for children. So when<br/>
your unschooled kids grow up and have a baby and make choices that are<br/>
different to yours, are you going to treat them to this sort of<br/>
invective? Because let me tell you, that&#39;s a sure way to drive them<br/>
away. And then they&#39;ll be on lists somewhere saying the sorts of things<br/>
we&#39;ve heard about mothers on this list from time to time - so<br/>
judgemental, so intoleran&#39;t, wont even listen to my point of view etc<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
For what its worth, I am a committed SAHM, have been homeschooling for<br/>
14 years and love being at home. I also know people who thought they<br/>
wanted to be SAHMs but who found that they just didn&#39;t like the &#39;job&#39;<br/>
(let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s something you can&#39;t possibly know you&#39;ll like until<br/>
you&#39;ve tried it)  and who felt that their kids were better off going to<br/>
school with teachers who liked kids, and coming home to a loving mother,<br/>
rather than staying at home with a discontented, resentful mother. Okay,<br/>
so we think they have work to do in their heads, but I&#39;m not going to<br/>
judge them.<br/>
<br/>
Some people do not have the same goals for their kids / family as I do<br/>
as a SAHM and homeschooling mother, that invole a higher income than can<br/>
be provided by one income. That doesn&#39;t mean they care less, or are<br/>
worse people - it just means they look at life differently to me. Just<br/>
as some people are christians, muslims, budhists, jews, whatever, rather<br/>
than atheist humanists like me, but that doesn&#39;t mean I condemn them as<br/>
bad, or stupid or such like - they are entitled to their own beliefs,<br/>
IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;d like to say that my husband is, IMO, a very fine parent, in<br/>
spite of the fact that he is away from home 48 hours a week working to<br/>
pay for us to stay home. Or does the<br/>
&lt;In order to be good at something you actually have to do it and if you<br/>
are in one place (your bosses office) and your children and in another<br/>
(a daycare institution) then you are not doing<br/>
the job of parenting.  &gt;<br/>
bit only apply to women? For in fact, I am providing the daycare that<br/>
allows my husband to go to work.<br/>
<br/>
I am sooo disappointed the level of intolerance in this conversation.<br/>

&gt;    I don&#39;t think when others talked about daycare and women who don&#39;t stay<br/>
&gt;at home with their children in a negative way meant that every woman who<br/>
&gt;works away from her children or uses daycare is insensitive, etc. etc. It<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t even bother me when women who don&#39;t HAVE to work outside of the <br/>
&gt;home<br/>
&gt;do and are still able to give their children all of the love and security<br/>
&gt;they need. What bothers me are those women and families who obviously don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;think their lives should change once children are in the picture, who <br/>
&gt;&quot;need&quot;<br/>
&gt;to keep working so they can have a second BMW or who would go &quot;crazy&quot;<br/>
&gt;sitting around all day with their children. Everything is what you make of<br/>
&gt;it. And if you go into motherhood thinking you&#39;re just going to sit around<br/>
&gt;with your kids all day, than you will. Parenting is such a selfless job, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;those parents who put themselves first instead of their children are the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112805255">The sentencing for pedophiles is enough to make you want to go postal. <br/>
Recently a guy got 343 years for molesting several children.  A few months<br/>
before that a teacher got probation for molesting two (that&#39;s how many went<br/>
to court) girls.  Of course, the guy that got probabtion had $$$ for the<br/>
lawyer and was white.  The guy that got 343 years had a PD and was a<br/>
minority.  It is time that sentencing was per the crime, not race or $$$<br/>
you spend on lawyers!!!!<br/>

I think feminism has turned a lot of women into pseudo--men, in <br/>
trying to be equal some women have denigrated what is was to be <br/>
a woman.  Why they felt the need to be equal [except along the <br/>
lines of equal pay for equal work] is beyond me, why strive to be <br/>
what you are not, men and women are not equal, they are different. <br/>
  Personally I like it when a man opens a door for me or raises his <br/>
hat as a greeting, however many men are afraid to open doors <br/>
because of responses they sometimes encounter &quot;I CAN OPEN <br/>
DOORS FOR MYSELF&quot; etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally can&#39;t think of any real good that has come from the <br/>
feminism movement.  I&#39;m talking 60s here, as it was earlier <br/>
feminists that gained the vote for women and the acceptance of <br/>
women wearing trousers they were good things.    But on the down <br/>
side the feminist movement has made women say such things as <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m ONLY a housewife&quot; with shame instead of the pride women <br/>
once felt in their role as wife and Mother.<br/>
<br/>
Men and women are different and thank Mother Nature for that <br/>
difference!   I can work as hard and as long as many men, <br/>
especially since I can wear jeans and not be restricted by the type <br/>
of garment I am wearing, but it sure feels good when working hard <br/>
to have a pair of strong male arms there to help out with the real <br/>
heavy stuff.   Most men are physically stronger and larger than <br/>
most women, this is an inescapable fact, a fact which is driven <br/>
home to me each time I work alongside my 15 year old son who <br/>
just two years ago had the body and strength of a child.   To see <br/>
the way he can lift things with one arm that I have to fight to move <br/>
with both of mine reinforces that difference.  <br/>
<br/>
In most cases the differences between male and female are <br/>
complimentary, our strengths and weaknesses are often at <br/>
opposite ends of the poles, so together can make a good team. <br/>
<br/>
I have been a SAHM Mom for many years, I have worked a few part <br/>
time jobs [tupperware etc] especially in the earlier years.  The <br/>
most important thing to me when deciding on what work I could do <br/>
was to ensure that either my Mother or husband would be available <br/>
to look after the children while I was working.  This was for little <br/>
extras, my oldest son was really into computers and devoured <br/>
books on the subject long before we had one, so I sold tupperware <br/>
to buy a Commodore 64 for his use.  Now I guess I am sort of a <br/>
working Mom, but the big difference is that I work at home so I am <br/>
here if the kids need me, and another big bonus is that they can be <br/>
involved and understand what I do.<br/>
<br/>
Summing up; for me feminism has given me the right to vote and <br/>
wear jeans, however it has taken from me the chance to feel as <br/>
though society values my role, if there is no $ value on it then it <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to have a value.<br/>

<br/>
Choice.<br/>
<br/>
Not perfect and not accepted by everyone as my right and my daughter&#39;s right <br/>
and it can be difficult and complicated.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ll take choice any day of the week, no matter how difficult and <br/>
complicated.<br/>
<br/>
To be taken seriously as a complete human being for the entire course of my <br/>
life, not to have to conform to some preconceived notion of how I should <br/>
live, to have opportunities available, to be traditional or radical, or both <br/>
at different times, to be respected, to be able to thrive and reach my full <br/>
potential, as a mother and daughter and sister and wife and complete human <br/>
being.  For my daughter to have this same level of choice and respect -- or <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a struggle and a job of balancing and susceptible to the vagaries of <br/>
life and health and the economy and relationships and others&#39; interpretations <br/>
of what my rights should be and luck.<br/>
<br/>
But that there is a fundamental level of choice and respect for those choices <br/>
and my ability to make them.<br/>
<br/>
That this was not recognized previously and now it is.<br/>
<br/>
This is the most important focus of feminism that I see.<br/>
<br/>
You, of course, have the choice to disagree.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
