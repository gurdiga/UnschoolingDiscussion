&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t you realize that when children have been on medication, that they <br/>
 cannot<br/>
 go COLD TURKEY??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can with Ritalin.<br/>
In fact, many, many parents are advised to only give it to them during the <br/>
school week and leave them off it on the weekends. Seems like a big HUGE, <br/>
in-your-face way of saying they only need to be drugged to keep them zombies <br/>
while in school.<br/>
There&#39;s no problem stopping Ritalin cold turkey that I&#39;ve ever heard.<br/>
