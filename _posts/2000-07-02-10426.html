<div id="ygrps-yiv-118822959">This is one of my pet-project ideas, that I&#39;d love to be doing right <br/>
now but dh wouldn&#39;t.  I&#39;d like to be a foster-parent to teenage girls <br/>
who are pregnant and have no family support.  I know it sounds big-<br/>
headed, but I think I could be a positive role-model for their <br/>
mothering skills, and a good sounding-board for them and their <br/>
lives.  I&#39;m not that far removed from their age and I was almost a <br/>
teenage mother myself, so I think I have a lot to give to people in <br/>
such a situation.  But what I want to do and what works for our <br/>
family are 2 different things :-(<br/>

give all to them now. You will have so much more to give in ten years time.<br/>
We really do want to do everything NOW, don&#39;t we? The problem isn&#39;t going<br/>
to go away. I am sure there are many things you can do to help these small<br/>
families without committing such a large slice of your life. Making other<br/>
people aware of your thoughts and support is a simple way to raise<br/>
awareness - and raising awareness, empathy and tolerance are all good steps. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-584004692">The problem with this idea is that I have walked in these shoes, <br/>
and by the time I have the &#39;space&#39; in my life a) hubby still won&#39;t <br/>
want to do it and b) I won&#39;t be &#39;relevant&#39; to such people.  I&#39;ll be a <br/>
patronising, interfering old bat, rather than a fellow mother.  So if <br/>
I&#39;m going to do it, it does need to be now.  What I could do later <br/>
would be to encourage others to do this...  I hope it&#39;s not as big a <br/>
problem when I&#39;m older, though it&#39;s perhaps vain hope...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141016341">I&#39;m not running myself down, I know I&#39;m always going to be <br/>
fabulous!  Just that I think this is how I would be seen (initially, at <br/>
least) by a pregnant 15yo with all the attending baggage that <br/>
brings.  Just trying to be realistic, and knowing what i and my <br/>
freidns were like back then.  Thanks for the encouragement, <br/>
though!<br/>

won&#39;t be such a person,<br/>
not unless you make it so.... I am 42 now, and <br/>
determined to stay &#39;young<br/>
and flexible&#39; in mind, like so many older people I <br/>
know... we don&#39;t need to<br/>
give up motherhood just because our children grow.... <br/>
motherhood is a<br/>
forever thing! Keep the feminine in mothering and don&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
You wil have more, much more to give, because you will <br/>
