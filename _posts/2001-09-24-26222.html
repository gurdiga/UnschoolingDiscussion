  you are my SOLE-sister!!  I&#39;ve never heard anyone else use that phrase<br/>
either,  but mine fit the description....they&#39;re like rectangular blocks!<br/>
<br/>
As to where I find shoes.....I usually don&#39;t!  Until about two years ago,<br/>
there was an outlet that carried.....?.....total mental block....an<br/>
expensive name....??......well,  they carried Easy Spirit tennies,  too<br/>
[which I only bought once b/c I thought they were too &#39;old lady-ish&#39; :-)]<br/>
Anyhow,  they had &#39;odd&#39; sizes....like 11 and over,  and EEE,  even EEEE&#39;s.<br/>
I&#39;d get great dress shoes for under $20.00!!  Of course,  this place was 1.5<br/>
hours away...but well worth the trip.   Why didn&#39;t they notify me before<br/>
they went out of business????<br/>
<br/>
i can&#39;t even wear wides that you find at Payless..or anywhere else.  I do<br/>
buy young men&#39;s/boys tennies when I can find them.  I wear a 6 or 6-1/2<br/>
now.....my feet seem to have spread in all directions with each child!!  But<br/>
I have difficu;ty finding this size!!<br/>
<br/>
I currently own:  one totally ratty pr of boys cheap tennies ($7.00 K mart<br/>
clearance),<br/>
                           one pr low heel fake-suede slip-ons (DSW ... 3<br/>
yrs old)<br/>
                           one pr low heel black pumps (Payless wide width)<br/>
<br/>
    The 2nd and 3rd I wear to church,  meetings,  short outings with not<br/>
much walking/standing involved...and I plan to soak/ massage them that night<br/>
&#39;cause they&#39;ll be sore.  I do wear arch supports,  which helps some,   but<br/>
the width is my toughest &#39;fit&#39; problem.<br/>
<br/>
Love your moccassins....as a chold,  I&#39;d get some on trips to Gatlinburg,<br/>
TN.....and wear them EVERYWHERE!  Now,  I&#39;d need some with arch support to<br/>
carry all me and the extra pounds I haven&#39;t been able to shed yet.<br/>
<br/>
Shall we consider trying our hand at &#39;footwear design&#39;...we&#39;d have a market<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132765694">Have you looked into getting some orthotic insoles? Probably be hard to fit, but<br/>
you can move them from one pair of shoes to another. They provide arch support,<br/>
and you could put some into some great mocassins!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133887373">I love it! I actually have a high arch and the top of my foot is high also.<br/>
If you took off my baby toe and the corresponding part of my foot it would<br/>
be around normal width. Usually the only dressy shoes I can find are the<br/>
lace up kind that were in style a few years ago. Mine are fast wearing out.<br/>
Can you get some removable arch supports to slip into the moccasins?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660555769">I have made shoes for feet that don&#39;t correspond to<br/>
the standard shoe sizes.  I have also made shoes for<br/>
children, babies, and myself, even though I am blessed<br/>
a very average sized foot.<br/>
<br/>
Trace around your foot on a piece of paper.  Measure<br/>
the width of the foot over the arch and from the<br/>
longest toe to the highest point of your foot.  Then<br/>
cut out a shoe shape from some leather or several<br/>
layers of thick cloth at about three fourths of inch<br/>
larger than your foot,(less for children) about an<br/>
inch in front of the toes.  This is the sole with a<br/>
seam allowance. <br/>
<br/>
Now decide how you want the top to look and cut it out<br/>
too.  A good place to look for patterns and ideas is a<br/>
book of DOLL SHOES. They work well in cloth. Modify<br/>
them by putting the seams on the outside (dolls don&#39;t<br/>
care if they scratch or rub.)  The shoes I have made<br/>
were moccasins of a couple of styles (The sole is not<br/>
always separate from the body of this shoe....and it<br/>
is easier to see how it should be if you can fit the<br/>
foot shape inside the shoe shape) (patterns for<br/>
moccasssins are available from the library or on<br/>
several web sites if you do a search for Native<br/>
American crafts and clothing), booties with no soles,<br/>
and booties with soles for bigger kids and me, and a<br/>
version of the shoes that are worn by the Basque in<br/>
the Pyranees for me and others.  The latter are the<br/>
most popular.  In fact it is time for me to make some<br/>
winter versions for  a child for whom I make shoes. <br/>
She has what are officially called &quot;deformed&quot; feet and<br/>
cannot wear commercial shoes. At All. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a little, it is just some ideas.  At<br/>
one time I had no money and NO shoes. I wasn&#39;t<br/>
pregnant at the same time, though!(G) Had to go<br/>
somewhere, so I made some. <br/>
<br/>
If you e me off list I can scan a drawing and<br/>
directions (more or less) and e it off list.<br/>
<br/>
Sharon<br/>
<br/>
Have you thought about those Teva style sandals with<br/>
the velcro straps all over the place and socks for<br/>
winter?  What about the sandals with the cork<br/>
interiors? And adjustable straps. Like the<br/>
Birkenstocks. Men&#39;s are just like the women&#39;s except<br/>
wider. They last forever. <br/>
