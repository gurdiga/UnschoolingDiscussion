If you do it in way of a review, meaning you then tell people how they can <br/>
join this e-mail loop, then nobody can say a thing!<br/>
<br/>
And even if you didn&#39;t, there are over 800 people on this list and I&#39;m pretty <br/>
sure that the law says what arrives in your mailbox (real mail or virtual) is <br/>
yours to share.  Doesn&#39;t mean to swipe (which is not what you had in mind <br/>
anyway!), but to say &quot;So&#39;n&#39;so said this in public:  &#39;blah--------&#39;  &quot; is <br/>
wholly legal and pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
People who don&#39;t want to be quoted shouldn&#39;t say anything in public.<br/>
