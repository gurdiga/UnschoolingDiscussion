<div id="ygrps-yiv-131959609">Sixteen inch radial inner tubes are ten bucks apiece and can&#39;t be beat<br/>
for river floatation devices.   <br/>
We were out digging the Skull of Satan out of a sand bar, up to our shins<br/>
in river muck when we decided the water was still high enough, but just<br/>
slow enough for floating.<br/>
<br/>
The Skull of Satan turned out to be (maybe) a bison, minus the lower jaw<br/>
bone, but the inner tubes turned out to be a whole day and part of a<br/>
nights worth of fun.   Tomorrow we&#39;re going to schlepp them off to the<br/>
lake and see how far we can drift before we have to be rescued. <br/>
<br/>
I got a gash in my right hip (ok, butt cheek) and didn&#39;t know it was<br/>
really a gash until I was out of the water.<br/>
The eleven year old expert said it was probably from a sharp stick.  He<br/>
was poked once in the foot by a sharp stick and so now anything that<br/>
stabs unsuspecting fun worshipers is probably a stick.   I told my family<br/>
what it really was but they&#39;re having a hard time accepting the<br/>
possibility of a great white shark in the waters of Montana. <br/>
<br/>
Last week we found a small colony of Pelicans at east end of the Nevada<br/>
Creek reservoir where Pelicans never stay for more than a brief stop<br/>
over.  This group of fifty four has been there since the end of June,<br/>
along with a hundred or more Canadian geese and other assorted waterfowl.<br/>
  Our last day there we counted six Great blue Herons.  Dylan practiced<br/>
skipping stones.  We tried to catch crayfish without getting pinched.  We<br/>
found some nice rocks to add to the collection. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be thinking of you all tomorrow while I&#39;m floating at Georgetown<br/>
lake, watching the sand pipers and getting sunburned here in balmy<br/>
Montana where the temperature reached a nearly tropical one hundred and<br/>
one degrees on Saturday.   <br/>
<br/>
Deb L, loving summer.</div>

<br/>
Deb L, who hasn&#39;t even looked at the merlot yet...maybe that&#39;s the <br/>
problem...</div>
