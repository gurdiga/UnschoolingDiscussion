&lt;&lt; I realize it might just be buying into societies need to recognize and <br/>
hold <br/>
 their children out for the world to see how &quot;great they are&quot; but I also <br/>
 recognize there is some tradition to this rite of passage as well.<br/>
 <br/>
 I&#39;ve never really even thought of it before now and was just wondering what <br/>
 others thought.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about having a rite of passage for my son, maybe at <br/>
puberty, as so many great traditions do.  But not some stiff ceremonial thing.  I <br/>
dunno.  Everyone&#39;s posts about puberty has made me think yet again about it.  <br/>
Something to help them accept the stage of development and the changes of their <br/>
bodies seems vitally important. <br/>
<br/>
But, I do think that graduation can be a teenager to adult rite of passage ( <br/>
*singing* school&#39;s out for summer, school&#39;s out forever!) , but we can screw <br/>
that up quite a bit by sending them off to college right afterwards.  *sigh* I <br/>
dunno, the accomplishments are commonplace, therefore not as useful as <br/>
individuals?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been thinking about maturity, when is a child an adult, and society <br/>
seems to be constantly pushing it back.  Read an article the other day that <br/>
psychologists are exploring the idea of a post-adolescent, pre-adult stage of <br/>
development, that can continue into the 30&#39;s!!!  Ya know, those people who <br/>
work, but still live at home, those who can afford to buy nice cars and clothes, <br/>
but somehow can&#39;t afford rent or a mortgage or their own food? <br/>
<br/>
 The two women interviewed for the article say that because they aren&#39;t <br/>
married, don&#39;t have kids, or haven&#39;t bought a house, they don&#39;t consider themselves <br/>
adults.  I think some kind of rite of passage is becoming necessary, and that <br/>
graduations aren&#39;t doing it anymore, not from high school, and not from <br/>
college, either.  <br/>
<br/>
Something bothers me about parents who don&#39;t think anything&#39;s wrong with <br/>
their kids  coming home to live after college.  I think it sets up unrealistic <br/>
expectations about what adult life is, and can be.   I&#39;m trying to figure out <br/>
what my job is here, isn&#39;t it to raise him so that he can live his own life, <br/>
responsibilities and all? Isn&#39;t it a failure on my part if he comes home, unable <br/>
or unwilling to deal with independence?   <br/>
<br/>
Btw, I had my own apt, a baby, and a SO, and ya know what made me feel like <br/>
an adult?  Buying and getting a brand new bed delivered for my 2 yo.  I, to <br/>
this day, do not know why that is.  *grin* <br/>

<br/>
If they CAN go home, then it&#39;s a realistic expectation.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that being grown requires &quot;realistic expectations&quot; just seems like <br/>
more of the school-continuum-assembly-line thinking to me.<br/>
<br/>
For a kid who&#39;s a millionaire, it&#39;s realistic to get a new car at 16 and to <br/>
cash out some stocks at 21 and travel around the world.<br/>
<br/>
For a kid who gets along well with his parents, the realistic expectation of <br/>
staying at home for a while doesn&#39;t seem so evil or sinful to me.<br/>
<br/>
And there are moms who want or need a kid to stay to help out at home (and <br/>
dads too, I&#39;m sure, but I think of widows).<br/>
<br/>
I think there are more cultures on the planet where people do stay at home, <br/>
many even after they&#39;re married and have kids, than there are cultures in which <br/>
people are considered slothful or immature to stay.  I tend to consider <br/>
majority behavior globally.  Our culture is so screwed up as to what&#39;s &quot;natural&quot; <br/>
that it&#39;s a bad place from which to view humans.  &quot;Natural&quot; has been a bad word <br/>
in Western culture for a couple of hundred years, at least, so we often don&#39;t <br/>
KNOW what would be natural.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579854580">Westerns do not initiate their men-children.  Humanity evolved with man-boys being &quot;welcomed&quot; (sometimes brutally, but always done) into the community of men.  <br/>
<br/>
Westerners don&#39;t do it well or much; instead, seperate children from family, boys from dads, leaving boys LOST.  Many, many books on that topic. (Robert Bly& Bill Moyers PBS interview too, quite good)  Still critical issue to me WAYYY down in my soul, though &quot;men&#39;s movement&quot; is out of vogue now. <br/>

unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
Many cultures ASSUME you will come home, raise your family in your parents<br/>
reach and that the generations will be closely tied.  It&#39;s a very Western<br/>
idea this &quot;move away at the age of majority&quot; thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think the big reason it becomes a problem here is that the &quot;parent/child&quot;<br/>
dynamic in many families is so authoritarian and it doesn&#39;t change when the<br/>
adult child moves back in.  So the child stays &quot;juvenille.&quot;  Where as just<br/>
living at home doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t meeting adult responsiblities.  You<br/>
could be paying rent (or your share of the mortgage, whatever,) buying<br/>
groceries for the family, etc.  Being an adult member of the family.<br/>

<br/>
This made me think about a lot of things, my oldest came home to live after <br/>
college.  She had her own apartment at school and had &quot;been on her own&quot; for <br/>
four years.  Breaks were spent at home for the most part or some part anyway.  <br/>
She did take summer school course for a couple summers so she was away a large <br/>
portion of that time too.<br/>
<br/>
Her college was out of State, so I don&#39;t know if that makes any difference.  <br/>
At one point she had thought of settling down in her college town, but a <br/>
broken heart and a low paying job brought her home.<br/>
<br/>
I welcomed her home with open arms, glad to have her back around the house.  <br/>
We nursed the broken heart and celebrated the &quot;healing&quot; of it as time passed.  <br/>
She did work, she did contribute to the household, but she also drove my car <br/>
that we paid for and the insurance that we paid (same as college).<br/>
<br/>
If I asked her to pick up something for dinner she did, very willingly.  If <br/>
one of her siblings needed something, she helped out, often times even buying <br/>
their clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad, ever the one who can&#39;t wait for an &quot;empty nest&quot; (claims he wants to <br/>
be able to chase me around the house naked, uh, yeah...) would ask her too <br/>
often too suit me, when she was moving out.<br/>
<br/>
Rents are very high here and she was substitute teaching looking for a <br/>
permanent position, waitressing at night.  Sometimes a big week, sometimes not.  <br/>
Schools here also pay only once a month, that takes some getting used to and <br/>
learning to budget to be able to make it thirty days between paydays.<br/>
<br/>
She did move out, less than a year after she came home.  It saddened me that <br/>
she left home, although not as bad as when I dropped her off at college (she <br/>
is about three miles from me).  I know she wanted me to be excited and help her <br/>
find furniture and curtains and paint and decorate her new apartment but I <br/>
was a foot dragger in that dept.  I didn&#39;t like the guy she was dating (he was <br/>
physically abusive) and I didn&#39;t want to feel like I contributed to her being <br/>
able to be abused out on her own out of site.  I even feared he might kill her. <br/>
 So I hated that time.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to her being rid of abusive boyfriend, him finally out of her <br/>
life and in prison where he belongs and I AM happy for her and DO enjoy helping <br/>
her decorate and I do buy her things for her apartment.<br/>
<br/>
So while I often doubted I was a very good mother at letting my children <br/>
&quot;go&quot;, I found out there were reasons for that and good ones.<br/>
<br/>
Would I feel like a failure if she were living at home?  I don&#39;t think so, I <br/>
enjoy my children so very much, but I know it makes them proud to be on their <br/>
own, paying their own bills and doing things on their own.  Not many of my <br/>
daughters friends live alone without roommates, heck most do still live at home, <br/>
all with college degrees or about to have them.  I think she likes that she&#39;s <br/>
able to do something others see as a goal somewhere in the future but without <br/>
any distinct time frame in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I see her every single day, well there are times when she goes to visit <br/>
friends or whatever that I don&#39;t see her every day but if she&#39;s home, she comes by, <br/>
usually for dinner and I very much enjoy her.  I guess the feeling is mutual <br/>
or she wouldn&#39;t be here so much.<br/>
<br/>
My older son moved out at 18 because his girlfriend said he should or she <br/>
would leave him.  She&#39;d been out of school longer and her mother wanted her OUT <br/>
ASAP.  So while he&#39;s been on his own longer, he didn&#39;t go to college but <br/>
straight into a fifty hour or more work week.  He needs much more help from us with <br/>
money, etc., even though he makes more than my daughter.  I think her being <br/>
&quot;on her own&quot; at college but with a budget from us helped her learn that if she <br/>
wants to pay the electric, then maybe that little outfit from the Gap will have <br/>
to wait.  She came home until she was ready to leave, he left sort of against <br/>
his better judgment.<br/>
<br/>
She had time to ease into adulthood and all the huge responsibilities that go <br/>
with it.  It was thrust upon him.  He knew he could come back home at any <br/>
time (still can) but he&#39;s manly pride wouldn&#39;t let him.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience it&#39;s much better for them to stay home with a loving family <br/>
longer than shorter and learn life&#39;s lessons before you find yourself on the <br/>
streets so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I might be wrong in thinking this but I enjoy the fact that my children <br/>
CHOOSE to be around me.  I see so many kids in and out my door that will do <br/>
ANYTHING to avoid their parents and never do anything with them.  I think that&#39;s sad <br/>
that a child would grow up and look for ways to see their parents as little as <br/>
possible.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it normal to be on your own at a young age?  I was married at 17 but I <br/>
felt old already from so many life experiences and it was a relief to leave them <br/>
behind.  I&#39;m glad my children don&#39;t have to run from their home to find love <br/>
or validation.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if there were living here at thirty-five, I might respond entirely <br/>
differently, especially if it was because they didn&#39;t know how to be responsible <br/>
for themselves or their families.<br/>

  I think that kids can come home and still maintain their independance. I agree with Sandra when she says we don&#39;t know what natural is and that the rule that kids should be out on their own being adults is still school, cog like thinking.<br/>
  Extended family living is still happening in some cultures and seen as normal, healthy and beneficial to all.<br/>

lot of time talking about how obnoxious young boys are, and how violent men <br/>
are. That if women ran the world it would be so much better. I find that the <br/>
school kids I know are very divided along gender lines, and a lot of playground <br/>
play seems to be boys against girls, and taunting according to what the gender <br/>
roles are.<br/>
My very good friends are a lesbian couple who recently adopted a daughter, <br/>
and they said they did&#39;n&#39;t want a boy because they are too violent and rebel <br/>
when they get older, doing dangerous things. I don&#39;t  beleive this is a function <br/>
of being gay, just very anti-male. <br/>
I am to the point with one friend that if she makes one more comment against <br/>
boys and their &#39;&quot;Wild energy and loudness&quot; that I will have to kindly discuss <br/>
it with her. This friend has one child, a girl, who is particularly anti-boy.<br/>
Any one else encounter this?<br/>

ID, UT, TX) what Maureen describes is my DREAM.  I am very envious of the <br/>
families here in WV who have many generations and cousins, 2nd cousins, 3rd <br/>
cousins within walking distance.  <br/>
<br/>
But living in Florida for a while, I saw another situation that really <br/>
saddened me.  Instead of the child growing and moving away, the parents reached <br/>
retirement age and left their hometowns and children behind.  I imagine it was <br/>
wonderful at first, sort of like starting over for many of our elderly neighbors, <br/>
but then they begin to get REALLY old and they have no one to help them and <br/>
take care of them.  We saw it soooo much, and more than once I held the hand of <br/>
an elderly neighbor while they cried about not seeing their grandchildren or <br/>
children for years. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not only the YOUNG who have bought into the expected &quot;grow up and move <br/>
away&quot; but the older folks too.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nancy in BC<br/>
<br/>
I have to say I don&#39;t believe in my area that I see the anti-boy issue.<br/>
 I was thinking well is it anti-girl? Nope not that either. <br/>
 I have two boys and a girl.  My daughter is 3 1/2 and is the most <br/>
challenging.  I say challenging because we are going though a LOUD stage. She screams at <br/>
the drop of a hat literally.  <br/>
What&#39;s that movie that plays the song &quot;It&#39;s my party and I&#39;ll cry if I want <br/>
too&quot;?  Oh Oh I know Problem child.  At times she reminds me of the teased child <br/>
at her Birthday. Now its really isn&#39;t her it&#39;s the 11 yr. old that gets her <br/>
going.  Yes, he is a boy. But not a rebel or a problem child. Just taunts her.  <br/>
(we are working on this SLOWLY)<br/>
<br/>
When I think about the people I know I really do not think I have any one I <br/>
know that favors either boy or girl.<br/>
I was always a &quot;Tom Boy&quot; (at least that&#39;s what it was called when I was <br/>
little) so to me I often can relate to my boys and girl. I ride the go cart, dirt <br/>
bike and play football.  I also love to shop and do hair with my 3 1/2 girl.  <br/>
She likes the boy stuff just as much though.<br/>
Does your friend have a girl?<br/>
This may be the difference. Do your friends have more than one or two <br/>
children? That might be it right there..<br/>

The Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness<br/>

/ref=sr_8_1/002-8162007-4450422?v=glance&s=books&n=507846<br/>
<br/>
I got it at a used book store.  I put the amazon link there not so you could <br/>
buy it (it&#39;s more than I thought it would be!) but because there are reviews <br/>
and sample pages.  It&#39;s a scream.   I&#39;m so glad we have a copy.  But there&#39;s an <br/>
extensive John Wayne section, so you reminded me!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;this inititation thing isn&#39;t a competition.  It&#39;s just what needs to happen <br/>
for most of the men I dared talk to about this topic.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you worry that maybe unschooled boys are too much with women (even more <br/>
than &quot;schoolboys&quot;)?<br/>
<br/>
My boys are with lots of males in a range of ages (14 to 30), but most of <br/>
them are gamer geeks.  (Not all.  At the moment they&#39;re at a large SCA event, and <br/>
Kirby (in his alter ego as Lord Magnus Gunwaldtsson) got to the third round <br/>
in the first tournament he ever entered.  I got there when he was done and off <br/>
borrowing a moment in a solar shower.  I&#39;ll ask him Monday which two guys he <br/>
beat and who beat him.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Mark (twice divorced, gay) says they took away all the things men <br/>
thought they were supposed to do and didn&#39;t give them any  new stuff to do, so <br/>
all are afloat and kind embarassedly bumping into each other sometimes.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Does your friend have a girl?<br/>
This may be the difference. Do your friends have more than one or two <br/>
children? That might be it right there.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My friend Rhiannon had a girl, a year and a half or so older than Kirby.  I <br/>
just had Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
Rhiannon often looked at me with a look of disdain when Kirby &quot;acted up,&quot; <br/>
because her daughter was demure and cooperative in every way.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years later, Rhiannon had another child.  So did I.<br/>
<br/>
Hers was another girl.  Mine was another boy.<br/>
<br/>
All these kids are teens now.  But when Caiti, her #2, was two or so and <br/>
Marty was two or so, she confided in me that she and her husband use to think I <br/>
had NO idea what I was doing, since Kirby was as he was, and Lily was as she <br/>
was.  But when we had our #2 set, Caiti was crazy, loud, destructive, and <br/>
generally unrepentant (way worse than Kirby had ever been), while MY #2 was every bit <br/>
as calm and cooperative as her &quot;expert&quot; #1.<br/>
<br/>
It was just random elements of personalities.<br/>
<br/>
Now that they&#39;re all older, Marty&#39;s wilder in some ways.  He was a placid <br/>
baby, always just sitting and smiling and agreeing and being fascinated.  Now <br/>
Kirby&#39;s Mr. Cool, rarely gets frustrated.  He used up all his frustration as a <br/>
younger kid, maybe!  Maybe got all the frustration he needed to experience <br/>
before he hit puberty.  (And maybe karate helps him be calm too.)<br/>

still disdainful. The digs and misandry are irritating. And not healthy for <br/>
anyone involved. <br/>
Perhaps I am very sensitive to it, buy my husband notices it also. <br/>

makes comments about how much more connected one can be with a daughter, how much <br/>
more and better and nicer they are , and aren&#39;t I glad I have one??<br/>

My son and I are closer than any other Mom I know with a daughter.  He tells <br/>

I think when her daughter and your son/s get older you will see that she was <br/>
wrong. Not necessarily because of the girl boy thing but her attitude.<br/>

Something bothers me about parents who don&#39;t think anything&#39;s wrong with<br/>
their kids  coming home to live after college.  I think it sets up<br/>
unrealistic<br/>
expectations about what adult life is, and can be&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with kids living at home after<br/>
college. I think maybe if you are referring to young adults who come home<br/>
and don&#39;t work or contribute in any way, then we are talking about something<br/>
different. I really don&#39;t anticipate that my children would be that way.<br/>
Just from seeing what I do now, it won&#39;t happen. And any of them are more<br/>
than welcome to come home anytime. I have one possibly close to going out on<br/>
her own and I am not looking forward to it. I will be happy and excited for<br/>
her, but in all honesty, not for me.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my husband and I were out looking at vans and started talking<br/>
about the 4th of July coming up already. I made the remark about Christmas<br/>
being her soon too. My husband casually said how the kids are getting bigger<br/>
and Tara will graduate next year and be off to college or moving out. That&#39;s<br/>
all it took and he felt bad after but still laughed at the same time. I was<br/>
in tears just at the thought. Of course him and Tara had a big laugh last<br/>
night at my expense! Tara came and hugged me and said she would never leave<br/>
the state or even our town and will move a block away just so I won&#39;t miss<br/>
her and her me!!!<br/>

  Something bothers me about parents who don&#39;t think anything&#39;s wrong with<br/>
  their kids  coming home to live after college.  I think it sets up<br/>
  unrealistic<br/>
  expectations about what adult life is, and can be&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Well I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with kids living at home after<br/>
  college. I think maybe if you are referring to young adults who come home<br/>
  and don&#39;t work or contribute in any way, then we are talking about something<br/>
  different. I really don&#39;t anticipate that my children would be that way.<br/>
  Just from seeing what I do now, it won&#39;t happen. And any of them are more<br/>
  than welcome to come home anytime. I have one possibly close to going out on<br/>
  her own and I am not looking forward to it. I will be happy and excited for<br/>
  her, but in all honesty, not for me.<br/>
<br/>
  Yesterday my husband and I were out looking at vans and started talking<br/>
  about the 4th of July coming up already. I made the remark about Christmas<br/>
  being her soon too. My husband casually said how the kids are getting bigger<br/>
  and Tara will graduate next year and be off to college or moving out. That&#39;s<br/>
  all it took and he felt bad after but still laughed at the same time. I was<br/>
  in tears just at the thought. Of course him and Tara had a big laugh last<br/>
  night at my expense! Tara came and hugged me and said she would never leave<br/>
  the state or even our town and will move a block away just so I won&#39;t miss<br/>
  her and her me!!!<br/>

 unrealistic. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unrealistic, as in being 30 years old and not being able or interested in <br/>
contributing to the household realities of bills, meals, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.  <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;Where as just<br/>
living at home doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t meeting adult responsiblities.  You<br/>
could be paying rent (or your share of the mortgage, whatever,) buying<br/>
groceries for the family, etc.  Being an adult member of the family.<br/>

friends who live at home, that are like that!  <br/>

&lt;&lt; that the rule that kids should be out on their own being adults is still <br/>
school, cog like thinking.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yah, you&#39;re right, I realize that now.   I was so busy reacting against one <br/>
dynamic ( the spoiled adult/child) that I fell head first into the other <br/>
extreme ( out by 18) .  <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Extended family living is still happening in some cultures and seen as <br/>
normal, healthy and beneficial to all.<br/>

Because I need healthy models for this, and around me, I have none!  <br/>

&lt;&lt;when the families stay together it&#39;s <br/>
better for everyone, not necessarily sure if a care taking role by the child <br/>
is <br/>
always healthy, even if necessary, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As opposed to what?  Working harder to pay for a nursing home?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I feel guilty sometimes, but I really don&#39;t want drunks and their problems <br/>
 and their behaviors around my kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, your experience is a good example.  You choose not to be a caretaker.  <br/>
There were reasons why it wasn&#39;t healthy for you or your family.  <br/>
<br/>
I am reading Anna Quindlen&#39;s One True Thing, about a woman going back home to <br/>
take care of her dying mother.  I winced when she quit her job and sublet her <br/>
apartment.  Considering the first chapter has her in a jail cell, I&#39;m <br/>
thinking that it wasn&#39;t the best choice for her,  but I&#39;ll reserve judgment til I <br/>
finish the book.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;   I<br/>
 know lots of people think teenage pregnancy is such a &quot;disaster&quot; but<br/>
 really, I have some friends who had kids when they were teenagers and<br/>
 it *really* helped them iron out the kinks in their life!  they are<br/>
 really efficient at raising their families and running a household and<br/>
 are now in their late 20s looking toward pursuing their own interests.<br/>
 <br/>
 Jana &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll agree with you on that one.  <br/>
<br/>
I was at the park with my son yesterday, and I was chatting with a mom, and a <br/>
group of teenagers were pushing a stroller, I don&#39;t know for sure if one of <br/>
them was the mom to the baby or not, but I said to the mom, next to me,  that <br/>
was me.  Pierced nose, dyed red hair, black clothes, lol, pushing a stroller.  <br/>
I was 20, so not a teenager, but young. <br/>
<br/>
She said, about the girl pushing the stroller, that&#39;s too young.  I said, <br/>
maybe, but nothing matures you faster than being responsible for a child. I think <br/>
it&#39;s true, good or bad.  And I am glad that I had Alex young,  I feel like it <br/>
was meant to be, I am even still with his father *shocking* lol.  It&#39;s <br/>
obviously not always a disaster.  And one of the things that was good was that I <br/>
still had my idealism, which brought me to unschooling!  <br/>

Thanks for sharing your story, it gives me a much clearer picture of a young <br/>
healthy adult making her own way in the world, with your support.  I needed to <br/>
hear that! <br/>

&lt;&lt; Nancy, ate ice cream instead of drinking wine in BC &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t marijuana being decriminalized in BC?  Soon you will have even more <br/>
options! lol <br/>
