<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075505248">thank you for this post. It&#39;s funny how some things are harder to &quot;let <br/>
go&quot; of than others. I know my girls like music, like playing. One <br/>
doesn&#39;t want a teacher at all, but the other does, but not until she <br/>
decides she&#39;s ready. That&#39;s fine. I did suggest they didn&#39;t have to <br/>
follow their books - just  have fun. I am completely amazed at how good <br/>
they sound - much better than a friend who&#39;s been taking school lessons <br/>
for a few years now. I&#39;ve been wanting to get a keyboard for myself, but <br/>
have been hesitant to spend the money. It doesn&#39;t feel like something we <br/>
&quot;need&quot; ... but perhaps that would do a number of things.. putting more <br/>
music into the house, playing for fun, and so on. We do play for fun <br/>
now, but I confess that it&#39;s hard for me not to interfere.  My four year <br/>
old pulls out the old guitar a lot and messes with that, but he keeps <br/>
telling me he wants a violin.<br/>
<br/>
this has been an interesting discussion.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
Susan<br/>

&lt;&lt; Me again:<br/>
No, we don&#39;t have  a tribe of people playing music in our home every day. But <br/>
the lesson here can be used.<br/>
Surround children with music, surround them with musicians if that&#39;s what <br/>
they wish. Give them access to instruments, as many as possible, access to <br/>
teachers they can come and go from as they choose. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s fiddle teacher, and her former fiddle teacher (she dropped out for a <br/>
few months), and others in town, publish a list of jam sessions the kids can <br/>
go to.  One is specifically for kids.  The others are &quot;real&quot;--just whoever.  <br/>
I had planned to start taking Holly just about the time I broke my leg, but <br/>
they&#39;ll still be there.  Mostly it&#39;s bluegrass and old-timey.  One group is <br/>
the live music for the contradancers.<br/>
<br/>
We wanted Holly to do one piece with us in our Wednesday Renaissance music <br/>
group (me, Keith, and two other guys), because there&#39;s a medieval piece <br/>
called &quot;Edi Beo,&quot; with a three-note harmony.   I asked her fiddle teacher for <br/>
advice on fingering, and she told me that it was in a bad key for Holly.  Her <br/>
teacher transposed it (both parts), got me to record it with her (me on <br/>
recorder; we switched parts), she put it on a practice and samples CD for all <br/>
her students, and now the Wednesday group plays it in Holly&#39;s key.    Holly <br/>
and the teacher are doing it for the Christmas concert.<br/>
<br/>
Her usual practices are me and her both.  While she still has a rented 3/4 <br/>
violin, I&#39;m playing her full-size.  I have a better ear and can tune them, <br/>
but I never played &quot;strings&quot;--I played guitar, though, so it&#39;s not foreign.  <br/>
And I do keyboards and recorder and have sung formally with music, &quot;for real&quot; <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;.  So she corrects my bow hold and elbows (the best way to learn is <br/>
often to teach), and I play the melody roughly while she plays the harmony <br/>
well.  So I&#39;m learning to play fiddle with Holly.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s also much easier to SEE music on a keyboard than any other instrument.<br/>
You should get one.  Used if you need to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My four year <br/>
<br/>
old pulls out the old guitar a lot and messes with that, but he keeps <br/>
<br/>
telling me he wants a violin.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are some Chinese-made violins available on E-Bay, new, and inexpensive. <br/>
 Cheaper than a few months&#39; rental, and if you get tired of it you could sell <br/>
it.  But I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My parents had a violin when I was a kid and I used to get it out and mess <br/>
with it, but they sold a lot of instruments one year.  I was very sad they <br/>
did.  My mom did it to do Christmas for us.  Keith and I made a pact when we <br/>
were young NEVER to sell an instrument for money. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And once we even bought an instrument with a tax refund.  A resin <br/>
reproduction of a medieval German instrument that&#39;s in a museum.  A <br/>
double-bore, indirect-blow double-reed thing called a Kortholt.  His mom was <br/>
appalled. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Brace yourselves for sadness, or go right by this to the next e-mail.<br/>
That year, my mom sold a flat-top acoustic guitar (she kept the arch-body <br/>
blues guitar, which is what I learned on before I bought my own),<br/>
an accordian  (all white and gold with mother-of-pearl)<br/>
an electric steel guitar, 50&#39;s Hawaiian/C&W style<br/>
a &quot;Les Paul Jr.&quot; electric guitar and a Fender amplifier<br/>
a violin<br/>
<br/>
I doubt I have one thing left from that Christmas.  I don&#39;t even remember <br/>
what we got.  <br/>

Oh man (or should I say woman&lt;g&gt;), that&#39;s just awful!!! I still have <br/>
my very first guitar (a Sears Silvertone Acoustic) and the old <br/>
electric amp my dad picked up from a garage sale when I was 10. Turns <br/>
out the amp is worth a few hundred dollars now, but I wouldn&#39;t part <br/>
with it for anything! Now I&#39;m trying to retrieve the accordian my <br/>
parents loaned to a family friend years ago.<br/>
<br/>
So people, the lesson here is once an instrument enters your home IT <br/>
SHOULD STAY THERE!!!! For all time and eternity! In our house there <br/>
are more guitars (and pianos and violins and violas and harmonicas <br/>
and etc...) than people. IMHO, a house without music is not a home.  <br/>

I agree with this idea!!! Hugely.<br/>
I regret the fact that I sold my flute nearly every time I think about it.  <br/>
When a person tires of an instrument, they should just put it away, and never <br/>
think of selling it, especially in a house full of children.<br/>
I am now trying to fill our home with instruments and it ain&#39;t cheap!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695230018">We recently attended a free World Music concert at a local <br/>
university, part of a series of concerts that are offered free <br/>
by the College Conservatory of Music here. This one was presenting <br/>
two master mbira musicians from Zimbabwe. It was wonderful! The <br/>
concert inspire us to search the web and find some great sites with <br/>
info about Zimbabwe, and about how to build our own kalimba, or thumb <br/>
harp, or the slightly more complicated mbira. And then we found some <br/>

Is there a loophole in this rule somewhere?  I have an hand-me-down<br/>
accordion that I never really wanted that I&#39;d like to get rid of.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s a quality instrument -- do I get an exception for that?<br/>

OOOOOHHHH,  Sandra, I feel your pain, ouch!<br/>
<br/>
I had never heard the Hawaiian guitar music very much until a local artist, Greg Brown, had a man from Hawaii playing his slack key (I think that&#39;s what its called), at his concert.  It was awesome,   I am going to look for a guitar for myself, just a regular one.  I&#39;ve played violin and cello but I think a guitar would be really cool to learn so I can accompany the kids in all sorts of things.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve been wanting to get a keyboard for myself, but <br/>
<br/>
have been hesitant to spend the money. It doesn&#39;t feel like something we <br/>
<br/>
&quot;need&quot; ... but perhaps that would do a number of things.. putting more <br/>
<br/>
music into the house, playing for fun, and so on.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also much easier to SEE music on a keyboard than any other instrument.<br/>
You should get one.  Used if you need to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My four year <br/>
<br/>
old pulls out the old guitar a lot and messes with that, but he keeps <br/>
<br/>
telling me he wants a violin.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are some Chinese-made violins available on E-Bay, new, and inexpensive. <br/>
Cheaper than a few months&#39; rental, and if you get tired of it you could sell <br/>
it.  But I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My parents had a violin when I was a kid and I used to get it out and mess <br/>
with it, but they sold a lot of instruments one year.  I was very sad they <br/>
did.  My mom did it to do Christmas for us.  Keith and I made a pact when we <br/>
were young NEVER to sell an instrument for money. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And once we even bought an instrument with a tax refund.  A resin <br/>
reproduction of a medieval German instrument that&#39;s in a museum.  A <br/>
double-bore, indirect-blow double-reed thing called a Kortholt.  His mom was <br/>
appalled. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Brace yourselves for sadness, or go right by this to the next e-mail.<br/>
That year, my mom sold a flat-top acoustic guitar (she kept the arch-body <br/>
blues guitar, which is what I learned on before I bought my own),<br/>
an accordian  (all white and gold with mother-of-pearl)<br/>
an electric steel guitar, 50&#39;s Hawaiian/C&W style<br/>
a &quot;Les Paul Jr.&quot; electric guitar and a Fender amplifier<br/>
a violin<br/>
<br/>
I doubt I have one thing left from that Christmas.  I don&#39;t even remember <br/>
what we got.  <br/>

You know what,  I think I made a big mistake,  I guess I know I made a<br/>
big mistake,  I was totally<br/>
thinking that Greg Brown was from here,  Minnesota,  because I&#39;ve seen<br/>
him up here so much ,  duhhhh,<br/>
I&#39;m not even sure,  Is he from Iowa?  very possible.  He has a big<br/>
following in Minnesota.<br/>
<br/>
I love his,  &#39; Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey&#39;!!    Pretty much as sexy as<br/>
Rickman&#39;s voice!<br/>
If Shyrley is reading this she has got to listen to him,  his singing is<br/>
all I need,  Oh and I guess a<br/>
few lines from Die Hard and Robin Hood.    OK ,,,I&#39;ll stop now.<br/>
<br/>
Kelli, feeling really stupid,  sorry about that.****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kelli,<br/>
<br/>
No need to feel stupid, he&#39;s not very well known, I was just excited to<br/>
find out that someone else knew about him.  I saw him for the first time<br/>
at a bluegrass festival in Yosemite (we&#39;ve been going there since I was<br/>
a teenager and now we take our kids).<br/>
<br/>
His writing is so smart and funny, I think my favorite is Morning Coffee<br/>
(or maybe Dream Cafe - too hard to choose just one).<br/>
<br/>
Have you heard his  albums for children?  Bath Tub Blues is very cute.<br/>

I havn&#39;t heard of his children&#39;s songs,  I&#39;ll have to check into it.   When is the Yosemite concert?  Does he do it every year?    <br/>
 <br/>
I also love Morning Coffee and Dream Cafe,   to me his concerts are so fun,  his side comments are hilarious.  <br/>
