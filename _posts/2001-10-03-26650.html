<div id="ygrps-yiv-344557043">Hi all, <br/>
I am going through a divorce...read: acrimonious... and I would like some support<br/>
and some advice from anyone who has &#39;lived&#39; through this. Our home schooling<br/>
(a way of life for us as we have been doing it for 9 years) is being threatened.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please email me privately at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:wegirls@...">wegirls@...</a><br/>
Thanks for your support, <br/>
BC <br/>
