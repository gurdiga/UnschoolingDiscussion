<div id="ygrps-yiv-592640364">To make a long story short, I have a 5 year old nephew whose mother suffers from depression.  This affects her lifestyle and habits and therefore her son&#39;s habits, etc.  (There is no insurance, therefore no medication, but she wouldn&#39;t take it properly if there was.)<br/>
 <br/>
She eats once a day or so, sometimes not at all, and will literally sleep 20 of 24 hours if she is able.  My nephew is in kindergarten now so they feed him lunch and his before-after-care provides snacks, so he does eat something, but his mom doesn&#39;t prepare food for him regularly, sometimes just tells him to eat out of the cereal box.<br/>
 <br/>
The concern most of the family has is that he is absolutely the pickiest eater any of us have ever seen.  If he doesn&#39;t want something, he will literally (and *deliberately*) make himself throw up in the middle of the table.  Of course, then no one wants to eat any of the food (including me!)  He won&#39;t try anything new and will go hungry rather than taste something.  <br/>
 <br/>
(When he was 2, my mother was watching him for a week and by the evening of the 2nd day she was in tears because he *refused* to eat *anything* put in front of him.  My mother finally drove by McDonald&#39;s one day on the way into town and he said something, so she immediately pulled in and bought him nuggets.  He ate NOTHING but nugget happy meals for the entire time my mother had him!!!  When his mother got him back, my mom asked her about it and she said that was what she always gave him, even before he could walk.)<br/>
 <br/>
He is undersize and wants to do nothing but sit in the house watching tv, but on the upside he seems to be very bright.  There are some emotional and behavioral issues stemming (we think) from his life so far (there have been some abusive situations as well as the neglect.) <br/>
 <br/>
Could refusing to eat be a way he maintains some sort of control over his life?  And how do we ensure he is eating enough to be healthy?  Any suggestions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704929244">People on the autistic spectrum often will only tolerate certain foods.  Texture can be a big issue.  They can and will hold out for what feels comfortable to them.  They can also get fixated on the television or computer and have a very difficult time switching gears to another activity.  High intelligence is common, but there is usually some type of language issue involved--either with speech or comprehension or both.  Depression can be a secondary factor for individuals on the spectrum, and autism can be hereditary.  It could be that the mother has some symptoms and your nephew has inherited some, as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I could be way off, too.  But it is something to consider, and it often goes undiagnosed by teachers and pediatricians.  If you can figure out what is going on with him, it will be easier to pinpoint ways of helping him cope.  You may, in any case, want to read more about autism and food intolerance/obsessions.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps--my daughter is on the spectrum and the rate of autism is quite high.  <br/>

  To make a long story short, I have a 5 year old nephew whose mother suffers from depression.  This affects her lifestyle and habits and therefore her son&#39;s habits, etc.  (There is no insurance, therefore no medication, but she wouldn&#39;t take it properly if there was.)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Of course!   And the best way to help him is to give him total control<br/>
over it.  He *should* have total control over it.  It is his.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to ensure he is eating enough is to stop trying to make<br/>
him eat stuff he doesn&#39;t want, and give him what he likes.  Ask him<br/>
what he would like to eat, and fix it for him.  If he loves bagel<br/>
bites or pb&j or cheese on crackers or ice cream sundaes, let him have<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
If eating at the table is too stressful, let him eat in front of the<br/>
tv or while playing video games or while taking a bath or wherever.  <br/>
<br/>
Often when my little guy is too busy playing a game to stop to eat,<br/>
I&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey, that looks like fun.  How about if I watch you play,<br/>
and I can hold your slice of pizza for you, too?&quot;  After about two or<br/>
three bites, his stomach wakes up and suddenly the game is paused and<br/>
he eats, or he likes my holding it and he leans over for a bite every<br/>
few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure there are always snacks he can get himself when he is home.<br/>
 Send him home with peanut butter crackers and cheese sticks and juice<br/>
boxes and milk boxes and cookies and chips and lunchables and anything<br/>
else a 5 year old can fix for himself.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the relatives all pitch in to care for this little boy,<br/>
and it is great that he is loved by you all.  Going a bit further and<br/>
giving him joy at the table instead of &quot;clean your plate&quot; demands will<br/>
help him much more than counting calories and worried faces whenever<br/>
he doesn&#39;t finish his broccoli.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Undersize&quot; might not be a downside.   Does he have a very large mother or <br/>
father?   Large uncles and aunts?   Some people are smaller than others <br/>
naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Watching TV might not be a downside.   It might be the safest possible <br/>
escape, and the kindest source of input and stimuli.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Could refusing to eat be a way he maintains some sort of control over his <br/>
life?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And how do we ensure he is eating enough to be healthy?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can you take him out from time to time?   Might he go for milkshakes?   Maybe <br/>
mailshakes with bananas?   Fruit smoothies?  Protein drinks?   (If not don&#39;t <br/>
push it, but if he&#39;s never had them you might find he likes them.    Carnation <br/>
Instant Breakfast put into a homemade milkshake has been useful here when <br/>
kids were on liquid diet after dental work.)<br/>
<br/>
But past the offer of other foods, or just forget about foods and just amuse <br/>
and entertain him, so that he likes and trusts you and would come to you if he <br/>
wanted help, you don&#39;t need to (nor CAN you) &quot;ensure&quot; him anything.   <br/>
<br/>
Make the offer.   If he&#39;s hungry he&#39;ll take you up on it.    Maybe he&#39;s just <br/>
honestly, truly not hungry.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who lived on almost nothing but pastries throughout her teen <br/>
years.   Donuts and sweetrolls.    She was healthy and fine and when she got <br/>
into her 20s and away from her parents, she started eating all KINDS of gourmet <br/>
foods even the most adventurous of us probably wouldn&#39;t have tried.    She <br/>
knows all about Middle Eastern foods in detail and sauces and goat vs. lamb; she <br/>
knows Japanese, Chinese, Korean, VietNamese foods...    The donuts didn&#39;t kill <br/>
her.   Probably everyone who ever razzed or pressured her to eat something <br/>
else just made her that more determined to have SOME say over her life by <br/>
choosing pastries.    <br/>
<br/>
She was never the least bit pudgy either--always skinny and always healthy.<br/>
<br/>
I would say smile at your nephew, be sweet to him, don&#39;t pressure him, don&#39;t <br/>
alarm him, help his life feel safer and larger instead of smaller and scarier. <br/>
  Help him feel right instead of wrong, and whole instead of partial.<br/>

I&#39;d say do that, too, and get his MOTHER some help.  If she doesn&#39;t  have <br/>
insurance and can&#39;t afford to get meds, then perhaps she could get  government <br/>
help.  Maybe she needs to be committed.  Is there a father  in the picture?<br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s misplaced to focus on the child&#39;s eating habits when it is  <br/>
obvious he is neglected in lots of other more important ways.  Wonder if he  feels <br/>
loved at all?<br/>

She is a danger to others (her son), and herself for not seeking <br/>

living anymore and she takes her sons life and her own.  I don&#39;t <br/>

treatment.****<br/>

his life so far (there have been some abusive situations as well as <br/>
the neglect.) <br/>
<br/>
***Of course he is having problems, he has a mother who essentially <br/>
ignores him on all levels and as you put it there is possible <br/>
abuse.  This child needs someone who will give him the love and <br/>
attention he needs.  If as a family you can have her observed under <br/>
a 51/50 (3 day psychiatric hold for danger to self or others) I <br/>
would.  This child needs someone to be his advocate and protect him <br/>
from this neglect and abuse.  My hope is that someone will step in <br/>
soon before it is too late.*****<br/>

<br/>
***Yes, refusing to eat, eating too much or to little is his way of <br/>
having control over his life.  Chicken nuggets are high in fat, but <br/>
they are protein and that is essential.  If possible try and find <br/>
out if there is any fruit that he likes and try to provide him with <br/>
that.  That way he can at least get some nutrients from a fruit.  <br/>
Veggies maybe pushing it so try to add a fruit to his diet if you <br/>
can.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll like the vitamins that taste like gummy <br/>
bears.  I&#39;m told they taste pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I am coming off strong but you must understand that I <br/>
have a long history of depression myself.  I don&#39;t like that I have <br/>
to take my medication everyday, but if I didn&#39;t I would be where <br/>
this young women is today.  The only reason she doesn&#39;t want help is <br/>
because depression gives you a feeling of hopelesness, fatigue and <br/>
can cloud judgement.  She will need family intervention to get that <br/>
help.  My prayers are with you and yours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245453971">I wanted to add a couple of things to my previous post.  Her <br/>
unwillingness to seek treatment is also due to apathy, which is also a <br/>
symptom of depression.<br/>
<br/>
My reasoning behind a having her under a 3 day hold is so that she can <br/>
have contact with a psychiatrist and begin treatment.  Often these <br/>
meds take a few weeks to kick in, but the medical staff would work <br/>
with her to see beyond herself and give her some hope.  Also, this <br/>
would give this poor child some attention and love from family while <br/>
his mother is beginning treatment.<br/>
<br/>
I have many days where I just want to veg out because of my depression <br/>
and fibromyalgia, but I choose to be there for my 11 you dd and guide <br/>
her through her life while she is home and learning.  That is where <br/>
the meds have helped, they help me to stay on a steady course and keep <br/>
me going.  It hasn&#39;t been easy for myself, my dh or dd, but we take it <br/>
one day at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;ll get off my soap box,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; symptom of depression.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which to the &quot;right&quot; audience can garner some criticism and raise the <br/>
level of guilt she may already be experiencing.  I guess I&#39;m cautioning<br/>
<br/>
against the mother being pre-emptively diagnosed and falling into the <br/>
cracks of the system.  Not out of the question if she&#39;s low income, <br/>
gov&#39;t assisted or uninsured.  She sounds too depressed to seek<br/>
competent <br/>
help within her means (a daunting task for anybody).  Maybe the family <br/>
can assist her to seek the best possible care.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason I had the idea (incorrect maybe) that it&#39;s not really <br/>
known if one or both the parents are abusive.  Difficult to get to the <br/>
bottom of.  The boy is likely to avoid an unknown future with the<br/>
sudden <br/>
loss of both parents, and so can probably be counted on to distrust <br/>
others about anything (food, facts about who&#39;s abusing him, etc.)  It <br/>
wasn&#39;t clear to me, but if the mother is abusive, that&#39;s a very <br/>
different situation, and the boy could definitely be in danger with<br/>
this <br/>
level of depression.<br/>
