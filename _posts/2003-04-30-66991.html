&gt;&gt;&gt; These steps are so wonderful, especially the lovely ritual you have<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; designed in step 2, that I have printed the post for future reference. I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; believe that the latter two steps would be useful for just about<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone. Thank you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for saying that, I&#39;m glad you found it useful. Especially since the<br/>
&gt; person who *asked* for some simple, easy steps to follow totally ignored it<br/>
&gt; in favor of more argument about sheet-spraying.<br/>
