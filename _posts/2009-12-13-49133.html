<div id="ygrps-yiv-643507380">Still deschooling, and finding that my expectations about<br/>
what my children &quot;should&quot; be doing with regards to taking<br/>
care of our home and our possessions have been getting in <br/>
the way of me appreciating my children who they are in<br/>
this moment.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind grocery shopping, even though I really, *really*,<br/>
REALLY don&#39;t like shopping, because I don&#39;t expect that the <br/>
kids, at their current ages, &quot;should&quot; be responsible for buying <br/>
their own groceries.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind laundering their clothes, because I don&#39;t think <br/>
that&#39;s an &quot;age-appropriate&quot; job for them, either.  They do like<br/>
to press the buttons on the machines, and so they do, and they <br/>
are willing to carry their dirty clothes down to the laundry <br/>
room in the basement, because they know my back hurts and that it <br/>
is a bit hard for me to get up and down four flights of stairs numerous times a day, and they do that for my happily, too.  But <br/>
I don&#39;t expect them to take it all on themselves, I don&#39;t even <br/>
expect them to carry the laundry up and down the stairs (although <br/>
I am grateful to them when they do, and I tell them so), and I <br/>
don&#39;t resent that I am the one who does the bulk of the washing.<br/>
<br/>
But I found I was stuck in resentment because they weren&#39;t <br/>
carrying plates to the sink, or wiping up spills, and they were leaving their toys and books just strewn everywhere, and then <br/>
were frustrated when they couldn&#39;t find their things, and the <br/>
things they weren&#39;t doing, I had chosen to classify in my mind<br/>
as &quot;things a child of age X should be doing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I dropped the expectations:  &quot;they should be doing <br/>
this; they are old enough to take on these responsibilities...&quot; <br/>
that freed me to lovingly take care of them, and even to help <br/>
them find a misplaced item for them, when they need that, without <br/>
any snide remarks about &quot;a place for everything and everything in <br/>
its place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read and re-read the pages about &quot;chores&quot; and choices and the<br/>
fact that I chose to bring these people into my life, and the <br/>
more I read, the more it sinks in.  No, they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>
enslave me with endless housework, and no, I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do <br/>
the housework. They are just having fun, and I can choose to facilitate that.  I WANT to make that happen!  <br/>
<br/>
I can remember as a kid, feeling like I had worked hard at home <br/>
to do everything right.  And I got it about 99% right, and I got <br/>
hell for the 1% that I hadn&#39;t gotten right.  I remember getting<br/>
yelled at for dripping water on the floor after a shower:  &quot;YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRY OFF COMPLETELY WHILE STANDING IN THAT SHOWER STALL!&quot;  I remember being shamed for not squeezing the toothpaste tube from the botton and flattening it as I went up.  (I guess that would be funny if it weren&#39;t sad.)  There was *always* something <br/>
like that I was forgetting, and I just don&#39;t want anything<br/>
resembling that for my children.  So I choose to drop the <br/>
expectations about what is &quot;age appropriate.&quot;  (It&#39;s easier said <br/>
than done, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from choosing and choosing <br/>
again, reminding myself that what I want is for my children to feel deeply loved for who they are right now.)<br/>
<br/>
I found myself in the mall recently, and one shop was selling<br/>
signs to hang in the home, and one of those signs read, &quot;Be kinder<br/>
than is necessary.&quot;  I like that.  I don&#39;t know if it is even<br/>
possible, but it is a nice guiding principle, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks to all of you.  Things get more and more peaceful, and<br/>
I am more and more the mother I want to be.<br/>

REALLY don&#39;t like shopping, because I don&#39;t expect that the<br/>

<br/>
Instead of think of it as &quot;grocery shopping,&quot; if you sometimes turn it  <br/>
to an outing with one (or more) of the kids, take your time, look at  <br/>
the odd vegetables, see what&#39;s on sale, say good morning to the  <br/>
butcher, get a donut...   Process over product means you can get both.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were young sometimes I&#39;d take two carts--the boys in one  <br/>
cart, and Holly the the baby seat of the other one.  I&#39;d put most of  <br/>
the groceries in the Holly-cart, but some of the interesting ones in  <br/>
with the boys, and I&#39;d talk to them, or we&#39;d sing or tell jokes.   <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;d only have two kids, one in the basket and one in the  <br/>
baby seat.  Sometimes if the store was really empty I&#39;d let them all  <br/>
down to walk, but it&#39;s kinda dangerous if it&#39;s crowded.<br/>
<br/>
The more you make it about the kids, the less it will seem like  <br/>
&quot;grocery shopping&quot; and will be part of the fabric of your  <br/>
relationships with your unschooled children.<br/>
<br/>
I used to think I&#39;d be taking my kids to the store with me until they  <br/>
were grown and gone, but that didn&#39;t happen at all.  When they&#39;re old  <br/>
enough not to go, it ends up being just me.  And some of my best times  <br/>
at the store then were when I wasn&#39;t in a hurry *and* I was by  <br/>
myself.  I can stall, I can think, I can listen to the music, i can  <br/>
let other people go ahead of me in the line, I can look at all the  <br/>
potted plants and cut flowers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70002082">Yes, it is wonderful when shopping is a social activity, <br/>
and an exploration, and a chance to visit with people,<br/>
but the key word is &quot;sometimes.&quot;  It happens sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I did this with the regular weekly shops when the kids <br/>
were younger and the family was smaller.  But now that we<br/>
are a family of seven, I find that, usually, the kids don&#39;t <br/>
want to accompany me on a &quot;big shop&quot; anymore.  Stocking the <br/>
pantry and the refigerators and freezers (yes we have multiple)<br/>
means filling two or three baskets full of groceries, <br/>
and it takes hours to do, and we run low again after 7-10 days,<br/>
even with a delivery truck bringing us non-perishables, so the<br/>
grocery store is a place everyone has a chance to explore <br/>
*frequently*.  These days, the kids usually want to do other <br/>
things more than they want to accompany me on a &quot;big shop&quot; to <br/>
restock the pantry and refrigerators/freezers.  The kids take sort <br/>
of a &quot;been there, done that&quot; attitude towards grocery shopping.<br/>
<br/>
My attitude is that I choose to shop because we enjoy cooking together, and that means we need ingredients.  Also, I like to <br/>
have lots of different sorts of interesting foods at home for the kids to eat whenever they happen to get hungry, along with a good supply of tried and true favorites and comfort foods.  But I sure like the food prep at home a lot more  than I like the going out alone and filling three carts. (Yes, having a large family was my<br/>
choice, and yes, I am very fortunate that I can feed them, but that knowledge still doesn&#39;t make the shopping all alone anything near to my favorite activity of the week.)<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, when we are doing a &quot;fill in&quot; shop, just getting a<br/>
few odds and ends, or shopping because somebody had an idea<br/>
for a recipe they&#39;d like to try, then we shop as an outing,<br/>
as an exploration, and that is fun.  Sometimes we all go,<br/>
and sometimes just one child will come with me; everybody<br/>
appreciates that everybody wants one-on-one time with Mom.<br/>
If I do have company on a shop, we&#39;ll usually get a snack in the <br/>
store, and definitely incorporate browsing and chatting with <br/>
other customers and with the people who work in the store.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were young, and I only had two of &#39;em, I&#39;d bring<br/>
my son&#39;s toy shopping cart, and he&#39;d push that around, acquire<br/>
items that interested him, and I&#39;d carry my daughter in a sling,<br/>
and she&#39;d reach for or point at items that interested her.  And<br/>
when each of my adoptive kids was new to the family, I&#39;d take &#39;em<br/>
to one of the local Asian grocery stores, to look for items that<br/>
would be comforting and familiar.  (They are all adopted from <br/>
China.) My biological children like the Asian grocery stores, too.<br/>
There are lots of different things to see and touch and<br/>
smell there.  <br/>

<br/>
Kelly, could you just clarify, when you do a big shop, do the kids reluctantly accompany you, or do they stay home while you do the shopping alone? I can see that either way it is a big job, but one that would be much more arduous with 5 unwilling kids in tow! I now do most of my shopping in the evening while my partner stays home with the kids. Sandra, you look at plants - I sneak a look at the trashy magazines to see the latest doings of the Jolie-Pitt clan!<br/>
