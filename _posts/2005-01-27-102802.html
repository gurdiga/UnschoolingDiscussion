TV is about entertainment. Entertainment comes from conflict. Often the<br/>
first thing you learn when you study acting (as an adult that is, I have no<br/>
experience of kids&#39; acting classes) is find the conflict in the scene.<br/>
Sometimes it is with the audience&#39;s assumptions or prior knowledge.<br/>

<br/>
They want the $50,000<br/>
<br/>
But the one you saw had a wife really complaining that the other mom had <br/>
earmarked $15000 toward a motorcycle for her husband.   That one was particularly <br/>
harsh, as everyone was happier with the one mom, and the family wasn&#39;t very <br/>
glad to see the other one come back.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Holly and I were joking (though it&#39;s not all that funny) about TV <br/>
specials a few years out about divorces caused by that show.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I couldn&#39;t imagine being away for 2 weeks.  I would never want my kids to <br/>
participate in it.  That&#39;s what bothered me the most.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
healthy.  Even for 2 weeks.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what got to me, too.  Sometimes the moms are harsh to the kids about <br/>
their habits or interests or how their moms are.  But even when the mom is <br/>
joy-mom, happy-happy, it will make those kids sad to see their own rules-bound mom <br/>
return, so either they&#39;re unhappy during or after, but most I&#39;ve seen seemed <br/>
to be instructive in some ways and illuminating for some people and way worse <br/>
than expected for most of them.<br/>

anyone happens to notice it&#39;s on, but they feel sorry for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I feel sorry for the husbands.  They don&#39;t have their regular confidant, <br/>
while weirdness is all around.<br/>
<br/>

That&#39;s all the people watching on tv would see...mainstream kids <br/>
<br/>
gorging themselves on stuff the mainstreamers perceive as bad. -=-<br/>
<br/>
True!<br/>
<br/>
-=-Trading spouses gives the 50,000.  Wife swap doesn&#39;t give anything as <br/>
<br/>
far as I can see.  I don&#39;t know why people would sign up for wife <br/>
<br/>
swap when they could get the 50000 from trading spouses.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  Trading Spouses is the one that does the two week swap and the cash, <br/>
though.   I thought that was the one that had been seen.  Sorry.  That was the <br/>
one where the mom was really angry about the motorcycle.<br/>
