<div id="ygrps-yiv-958001238">&lt;&lt;They cannot take him away from you for refusing to give him<br/>
medication....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, yes they can.  The poster stated that more was going on with her<br/>
son than &quot;ADHD&quot;, such as hallucinating, and yes, they can most assuredly<br/>
take your son away for not medicating a serious disorder.<br/>
<br/>
The way you get around that is to find a naturopath or some type of<br/>
homeopath that has credentials and is willing to back your decision.<br/>
<br/>
I have spent years working with Child Protective Services as a foster parent<br/>
and as a therapist.  If most people knew the power this agency has, it would<br/>
scare them to death.  At least in Texas, a caseworker can take walk into<br/>
your home and take your child today.  Within 2 days, she has to be able to<br/>
prove to a judge that you are not acting in the child&#39;s best interests.  If<br/>
she can&#39;t make the case, the child is simply returned home but she is in no<br/>
way punished.  She has to prove nothing to take your child away in the first<br/>
place, doesn&#39;t need a warrant or anything.  I had a foster child once for<br/>
over 4 months because the caseworker got mad that the mom moved from a<br/>
shelter where some of the kids were being abused by older kids into her own<br/>
home.  Took the mom 4 months and lots of lawyers to get her back.<br/>

Julie--who isn&#39;t scared of the devil himself but shivers at the thought of<br/>
caseworkers</div>
