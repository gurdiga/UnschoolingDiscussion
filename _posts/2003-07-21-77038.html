 </span></blockquote>Thanks Mary! How badly I needed to hear that!  It is such an incredible <br/>
journey to see all three of us growing ~ we&#39;re experiencing a soulful growthspurt!! <br/>
 I look back at myself 2.5 years ago, my life spiraled out of control, I <br/>
looked to the one thing I *could* control ~ I mistakenly thought it was my <br/>
children.  To see them regain faith in themselves (they put themselves to bed, when <br/>
they were tired, for the very first time tonight ~ it&#39;s been a *let&#39;s stay up <br/>
as late as we possibly can-fest* that I trusted would lose it&#39;s intrigue and <br/>
balance out ~ it has!) and faith in myself as the perfect guide on this leg of <br/>
life&#39;s journey.  <br/>

This quote just popped into my inbox, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no accident: <br/>
&quot;As long as you keep a person down, some part of you has to be down there to <br/>
hold him down, so it means you cannot soar as you otherwise might.&quot;<br/>

And Pam, Thanks for starting that new loop, I couldn&#39;t sign up yet but I will <br/>
be there tomorrow (later today, my goodness!).  I&#39;m glad to bring this <br/>
enlightening conversation to it&#39;s rightful home, I hope some of the never-spanked <br/>
genre will join us, enlighten us on peaceful resolution and guide us thru our <br/>
not-so-peaceful moments without violence of any kind.  <br/>
    <br/>
And the rest of you who cherish the integrity of your children&#39;s faith in you <br/>
~ I&#39;m glad to be here with you, I know it&#39;s the right place!  <br/>
