<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194252381">I posted this at unschoolingbasics, so forgive me if you&#39;re a member <br/>
of both lists!:) Just wanted to share a list I&#39;ve formed, for those <br/>
that are interested:<br/>
<br/>
This has to do with unschooling in a non-direct way, but is<br/>
definitely not an unschooling list.<br/>
I started an email list called &quot;imagination tribe&quot; for the support<br/>
of creativity. Initially, I wanted it there for folks that had taken<br/>
my creativity workshop here in Pensacola, but realized it would just<br/>
be nice to have a safe place on the web in which we can explore our<br/>
creative genius selves!:)<br/>
Since unschoolers are such creative individuals anyway, I thought<br/>
I&#39;d share it with you all, maybe a few of you will feel a need for<br/>
that kind of support.<br/>
If you&#39;re a repressed creative, yearning to break out of your shell,<br/>
or a fully creative genius exploring freely, I hope you&#39;ll join me<br/>
and create a wonderful list.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/imaginationtribe/</a><br/>
<br/>
And here is the group description:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Imagination tribe is a group of people, interested in supporting<br/>
one another in our creative endeavors. Whether you&#39;re a repressed<br/>
creative, yearning to express yourself, or a successful<br/>
artist/writer/dreamer/entrepreneur, join us as we discuss issues<br/>
that pertain to thinking, living and seeing more creatively.<br/>
This group has been started as a base of support for those that have<br/>
taken the &quot;Awakening the Dragon&quot; creativity workshop in Pensacola,<br/>
but is open to all creative souls, seeking other imaginative spirits<br/>
for support and idea sharing.<br/>
This is a safe place to share your dreams and goals. We ask that all<br/>
information and advice will be shared in a spirit of friendship and<br/>
true desire to enable one another. New members will be moderated to<br/>
ensure a supportive atmosphere. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the only one there so far...because I haven&#39;t done my workshop<br/>
here yet. So it looks rather lonely right now.:) After I get my<br/>
business up and running and do the workshop a few times, I expect it<br/>
to get more lively!<br/>
