Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) is gorgeous! Head and shoulders above <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>PLEASE stop saying that we silenced questions we didn&#39;t like. Not speaking <br/>
for the others, but it is very very inaccurate to say that I didn&#39;t like the <br/>
&quot;questions.&quot; I LOVE the questions and I even like the tirades and the debate. <br/>
I participate in such discussions all the time, elsewhere, and have even <br/>
written articles on such subjects.<br/>
<br/>
 This is the wrong list for that kind of debate.  I know, from years of <br/>
online experience, that these topics are like that nasty plant growth <br/>
(whateveritis - we don&#39;t have it here where I live) that just takes over and <br/>
chokes everything else out. So I won&#39;t engage in the discussions of <br/>
homeschooling politics or public school economics or any other such political <br/>
stuff here on this list beyond the possibility of a comment or two, here and <br/>
there. There are lists for certain purposes and neither homeschool politics <br/>
nor public school funding issues are what this list is for.... it truly is <br/>
here as a forum for us all to help each other understand unschooling and <br/>
figure out if we want to unschool and what that looks like in our families <br/>
and how to handle issues that come up in our lives in regard specifically to <br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Those who want to debate such issues HAVE places to do it. Even though I am <br/>
very interested in such debates, why would I insist on doing it here when <br/>
this list has a completely different purpose?<br/>
