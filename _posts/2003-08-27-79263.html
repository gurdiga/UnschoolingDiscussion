You sound a lot like the mother I was talking to in Wal-mart.  And, you are <br/>
absolutely right, I meant nothing &quot;against&quot; FIAR.    I have not done much <br/>
research on FIAR, but from what this mother said, it is a big step AWAY from <br/>
structured lessons for her family.  Her son loves to read and he is enjoying FIAR, <br/>
especially in comparison to doing &quot;school at home- very structured lessons&quot;   I <br/>
talked to this mother about unschooling, the things we do, and don&#39;t do.  And <br/>
for her, it seemed a bit TOO radical.  But, the thing is, as we get to know <br/>
them better, maybe spend more time with them, they may begin to move closer to <br/>
unschooling as they see that it really does work!   The best way to <br/>
demonstrate and convince folks that something is valuable is through modeling and BEING <br/>
it.   <br/>
<br/>
Some folks unschool from the beginning, never sending thier kids to ps or <br/>
doing school at home.  Some folks send thier kids to ps school for  years, then <br/>
decide to take them out and homeschool them.  Some familes homeschool from the <br/>
beginning, but they do school at home.   For the folks that start out either <br/>
in public school, or doing school at home, sometimes they make a flying leap to <br/>
unschooling and just go &quot;cold turkey&quot;  lol..   Others will take smaller steps <br/>
going from structured lessons, to relaxed lessons, to eclectic style, to <br/>
&quot;modified unschooling&quot; to full fledged unschooling.    We  have to meet each <br/>
person where they are, and help support and guide them from there.    To me, for <br/>
you to say that you love FIAR means that you are moving away from &quot;boxed <br/>
curriculum -structured lessons&quot;    It is a step closer to unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
One major key here is that you said that YOU love FIAR-- How do your kids <br/>
like it?   If given the choice, would they do FIAR on thier own?, without your <br/>
direction or requirements?  Maybe they would chose FIAR over other curriculums <br/>
that you have used, and in comparison to them, they &quot;love&quot; FIAR..  Think of the <br/>
things your kids really love to do, things that bring them joy, passion, <br/>
excitment.. Would they chose FIAR over these things?<br/>
