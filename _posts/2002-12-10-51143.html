<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217807573">From: Pam Sorooshian &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pamsoroosh@...">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We see so many AWFUL parenting examples in public places - this was a very <br/>
&gt; very nice encounter:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for sending this Pam, it *is* nice to hear positive about grandparents<br/>
and children in public. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve every heard anything that nice!<br/>
<br/>
I was at WalMart the other day (not known as Squallmart for nothing) and a mom<br/>
with a baby and a two year old was having a hard time keeping the two year old<br/>
going. At one point he was blocking an aisle that I was in with a grandma to<br/>
the right of me. The mom was getting him out of the way and giving him the<br/>
evil eye and I quickly jumped in, &quot;That it was fine, he wasn&#39;t bothering me at<br/>
all&quot;, and the grandma next to me said the same. As we pushed our carts away<br/>
the grandma muttered to me, &quot;Just don&#39;t whack him&quot;. It &#39;twas good to hear.<br/>
   <br/>
While I&#39;m on a roll here, does anyone else go to Trader Joe&#39;s? I want to know<br/>
why they have the nicest staff in the world and the meanest old people who<br/>
shop there? Taking a child into Trader Joe&#39;s is like running the gauntlet.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I LOVE our Trader Joe&#39;s.  They moved closer to us in August and are still <br/>
giving out balloons to the kids each time we go.  They have little shopping <br/>
carts for them.  And, sadly, lots of stuff accessible to their grasp.  But <br/>
then, we would never have tried plantain chips otherwise.  Their aisles are <br/>
packed tight, though.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (3) just reminded me that the last time she went with her father, <br/>
the wind came along and blew her balloon away.  &quot;That was kind of silly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I did ask why they discontinued the Silly Strawberry toothpaste once and the <br/>
manager came right out and looked it up for me.  Turns out to have been not a <br/>
big seller.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you have a bad apple or two there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That sounds great. Ours has some really cool visual displays. The <br/>
store itself is fine with nice people working there. They recently <br/>
remodeled so the spacing is better too. I love sweet potato chips, <br/>
haven&#39;t tried plantain yet. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gasp -- NO SILLY STRAWBERRY??? I&#39;m in trouble. My mint hater loves <br/>
that stuff. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is living in a retirement heavy town? The store I live <br/>
closest to has a relatively high income population that is very <br/>
hostile to young children. I&#39;m talking sour facesand not just to my <br/>
kids either. They really act as if kids don&#39;t have a right to be there <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to hear you are getting up and around a bit more Elizabeth. <br/>
Here&#39;s to quick healing and a fast return to flexiblity. <br/>
<br/>
Hey, I&#39;ve got a question -- do you dream in color?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes! Trader Joe&#39;s is grocery store that sells high end<br/>
yet bargain prices in convenience and snack foods.  We<br/>
miss marrion berry jam, the Porcini mushroom sauce,<br/>
and organic cornchips for 1.75 a largish bag that<br/>
often beats the price of conventional on sale! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a funky little grocery store with organic stuff and interesting foods.  <br/>
And really cheap but good wine.  A trip there accomplishes almost the same <br/>
thing as a supermarket, but in about 1/3 of the time.  Of course, the variety <br/>
isn&#39;t there either, but who really needs 100 kinds of cereal?<br/>

I dream in color.....I also remember dreaming in French when I was in college and studying French,  that was interesting,   Very exciting for my French instructor.<br/>
 <br/>
For those of you who like Greg Brown--last night I dreamt I was in this cool art place/museum and Greg Brown came in,  I yelled at him,  &quot;Hey Baby, Hey Baby, Hey!&quot;.     And I congratulated him on his marriage,       I always remember my dreams when my kids have me up alot at night.      <br/>
