<div id="ygrps-yiv-577618200">I am fairly new to this.  Although I&#39;ve been reading for quite some <br/>
time with very strong convictions that this is what we should be <br/>
doing, we just withdrew our children from school on Monday.  We&#39;ve <br/>
always unschooled our younger children and they flourish beyond many <br/>
others their age, so there is no doubt in my mind that unschooling <br/>
works.<br/>
What I&#39;m having a hard time with is the fact that everyone wants to <br/>
put their 2 cents in, telling us what we &quot;should&quot; be doing with them <br/>
now that they&#39;re home.  My Mom says that they should all have strict <br/>
chores (meaning the house should always be spotless). My mil thinks <br/>
that since the older kids are home the younger ones should now start <br/>
preschool so that I have time to focus on their studies. My sil feels <br/>
that education should be left to professionals.  Our live in nanny is <br/>
somewhat getting the idea of this, but thinks that we should formally <br/>
sit down and &quot;do&quot; the subjects they&#39;re interested in.  Even our <br/>
handyman will make comments like, &quot;some homework you&#39;ve got there&quot; <br/>
when they playing their computer games.<br/>
I feel like everyone, including mere aquaintances are checking up on <br/>
what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
I wish that there was a scripted info packet that I could give to <br/>
everyone that questions what we&#39;re doing.  I don&#39;t have energy or <br/>
desire to always explain our life to others, but it&#39;s not in my <br/>
nature to be rude (I really want to tell them to not worry about what <br/>
we&#39;re doing!).<br/>
I just wonder how others deal with the constant flow of questioning.  <br/>
Please say it gets better.<br/>

<br/>
================<br/>
 <br/>
One thing you might do is design a little kind of &quot;pre-recorded message&quot;  and <br/>
smile and say &quot;Thanks! I&#39;ll think about that.&quot;   After you&#39;ve done  it three <br/>
or four times, they might figure out that&#39;s all you&#39;re going to get out  of <br/>
you. &lt;G&gt;  And probably you&#39;ll only do it twice to each  person.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- My Mom says that they should all have strict <br/>
chores (meaning the  house should always be spotless). My mil thinks <br/>
that since the older kids  are home the younger ones should now start <br/>
preschool so that I have time to  focus on their studies. My sil feels <br/>
that education should be left to  professionals.  Our live in nanny is <br/>
somewhat getting the idea of this,  but thinks that we should formally <br/>
sit down and &quot;do&quot; the subjects they&#39;re  interested in. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
You could say things like &quot;Let&#39;s see how it goes,&quot; and &quot;If we decide this  <br/>
isn&#39;t working, we&#39;ll try something else.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
About the house, you could say &quot;If my first priority was a perfect house,  <br/>
I&#39;d send the kids to school so they couldn&#39;t mess it up.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
-=- Even our <br/>
handyman will make comments like, &quot;some homework you&#39;ve  got there&quot; <br/>
when they playing their computer games.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
You could say &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it have been fun if we&#39;d had these things when we  <br/>
were kids?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Say something sparkly and positive and that will make them think.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I wish that there was a scripted info packet that I could give to  <br/>
everyone that questions what we&#39;re doing. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
You could find a book, like maybe The Unschooling Handbook or The  <br/>
Homeschooling Book of Answers, and if anyone really presses you, smile really  big and <br/>
lend it to them and say you&#39;d be glad to discuss it with them when  they&#39;re <br/>
done.  If they try to discuss it before they&#39;ve read it, smile and  say, &quot;Read <br/>
this first, then we&#39;ll talk. I LOVE this stuff! You should read  it!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I just wonder how others deal with the constant flow of  questioning.  <br/>
Please say it gets better.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
With us, it got better because we were confident, and the kids started  to <br/>
impress the relatives.  You just need to stall them off until your own  <br/>
confidence is bigger than their worry.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Repeat often to self and others: Your concern is appreciated, your <br/>
approval is unnecessary. <br/>
The questions began when I was pregnant and I&#39;ve not done anything <br/>
&quot;normal&quot; since then &lt;vbg&gt; I figured out that NO ONE is willing to do the <br/>
research I do.  Though I was willing to share my with dh to get him on <br/>
board, there was/is a sense of &quot;if you don&#39;t have a firm grip on your <br/>
opposing opinion, it will not be considered&quot; from me.  I&#39;m glad so many <br/>
people are concerned for my family, it&#39;s a wonderful feeling.  I know <br/>
that MOST people who share their [sometimes whacked] ideas with me are <br/>
doing so from a place of concern and love, SOME share because their way <br/>
is threatened [often from in laws], very FEW share because they actually <br/>
know something about which they speak. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&quot; gets better &lt;bg&gt; but the &quot;It&quot; is your attitude, your investment in <br/>
what they say is diminished over time.  You&#39;re the parent, you need not <br/>
justify what you do.  &quot;I&#39;m doing what *I* know is best for my <br/>
family&quot;-period.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Out of all those people I would think that it would be most important <br/>
for the nanny to get it, since I&#39;m assuming she does a lot with the <br/>
kids, maybe even sometimes when you&#39;re not around?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you give her a few days off of her regular duties so that <br/>
she can sit at the computer and ask questions about unschooling.  <br/>
Maybe in the unschooling basics list?  I bet if she went on there and <br/>
said, &quot;I&#39;m a nanny to a family that just decided to unschool, and I <br/>
have some questions/concerns&quot;, they&#39;d give her a lot to think about. <br/>

Good idea.  <br/>
 <br/>
And maybe, too, all concerned could read this and consider planning meals  <br/>
and outings and activities this way until it feels natural:<br/>

To me, this is vital. As we were getting along, I realized that anyone who  <br/>
could see how Julian was turning out and still express concerns wasn&#39;t caring  <br/>
enough to really look at him. This was particularly true of my <br/>
ex-mother-in-law,  who had been a school teacher. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s sad, really, but so exciting when the people who really do care and  <br/>
really do know your kid get excited along with you, as they see what an amazing  <br/>
person this child continues to become.<br/>

I don&#39;t know about others, but I have a hard time with files in yahoogroups  <br/>
sites.  Seems difficult to get to them.   <br/>

If it&#39;s the acme curriculum stuff, it&#39;s also linked at the bottom of  this:<br/>

Thanks for the unschooling curriculum link. It will give me some ideas how to put what we do next time I have to satisfy my LEA.<br/>
