<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507830815">I am seeking some advice.  I am feeling very overwhelmed and lost <br/>
with trying to communicate with my son.  No matter how I have tried <br/>
to approach him about his behavior, it seems to go bad.  I feel like <br/>
I am furthering the rift in our relationship each time I try to talk <br/>
things out with him.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of the issues I am trying to deal with are him saying very <br/>
hurtful things to siblings and physically hurting them everytime I <br/>
turn around.  I don&#39;t think he means to hurt them physically or <br/>
mentally, but when they and myself explain that it is hurting them, <br/>
he seems totally unfazed and uncaring.  I am struggling with how to <br/>
deal with this situation.  He has never been a bad kid and with the <br/>
exception of a few things that we are constantly dealing with I <br/>
don&#39;t really have any problems out of him. I am not yelling (yet, <br/>
but I feel it coming), trying to point out that it is destructive to <br/>
a person&#39;s self esteem to be insulted constantly and so forth.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought that if I could verbally and physically focus on all he <br/>
does that is good might help him to see that kindness is much more <br/>
wonderful for all who come in contact with him.  But,I must be doing <br/>
something wrong because I am making no headway and seem to be making <br/>
the problem worse. I asked him why he felt the need to poke his <br/>
sister in the head and he just laughed and said because I felt like <br/>
it.  Even after she was crying he did it again, before she came to <br/>
me.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t walk around hitting him or anyone else and it seems <br/>
especially odd to me that he would do this &quot;just because she was <br/>
there and he felt like it&quot;.  To me it just seems mean and hateful.  <br/>
He in these ways is behaving like someone I would not want my <br/>
children to play with, because of their hostility and meanness.  <br/>
There are some dynamics to be considered as well.  He is the only <br/>
boy of 5 children and the oldest.  His dad is also getting ready to <br/>
deploy again in less than a week to the Persian Gulf again.  <br/>
<br/>
However, this behavior has been going on for a long time now and <br/>
though I have been trying to be patient and talk it out it has now <br/>
gotten to a point where others in the house are miserable.  Is this <br/>
just a phase that boys go through, or am I being naive.  The girls <br/>
are not near as difficult to deal with and the issues are a lot <br/>
fewer and farther between.  The ideas that have worked to solve <br/>
situations with my girls are not working with my son.  This is <br/>
probably a &quot;Well duh, he&#39;s not a girl, moment&quot; but I am seriously <br/>
worried about the relationship or what seems to be a lack there of <br/>
and the fact that it is snowballing fast in a bad direction.  <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on how to respectfully handle this so that we can work <br/>
on rebuilding a happy relationship.  I am very okay with being <br/>
picked apart, that&#39;s why I love this group, it challenges me to <br/>
think bigger, deeper and more carefully.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping for something better than this,<br/>

<br/>
That separation from his dad has got to be rough.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was that age, Keith was living in Minneapolis, working  <br/>
&quot;temporarily&quot; (turned into four years before we said &quot;enough).  It  <br/>
wasn&#39;t nearly as extreme as a war, so yours will be huge.   Kirby and  <br/>
Keith saw each other once a month and there was resentment and Kirby  <br/>
was growing fast.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to answer any of these for the list, but consider for  <br/>
yourself, at least:<br/>
<br/>
Does your son have enough privacy?<br/>
He WILL get better, I think, but I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s just at a fast- <br/>
growth point of puberty (which is hard under ideal circumstances).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does he have enough privacy?  Are you able to pay special attention  <br/>
to him, make him foods he likes, spend time with just him?<br/>
<br/>
Are there other families he can spend time with who have boys and  <br/>
present fathers?  Is there an adult male in your lives who could talk  <br/>
to him gently about the situation?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If talking is  making it worse, don&#39;t talk then.  Address your  <br/>
daughter instead and maybe say &quot;Are you okay?  I&#39;m sorry he&#39;s being  <br/>
that way.&quot;  And hold her and rock her (or whatever) without any big  <br/>
anger.  Be as calm as you can for her sake so she feels safe with you  <br/>
instead of part of a storm.<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching Jr. High a long time ago it seemed the best thing  <br/>
I could do for a kid who was uncomfortable in his skin and who felt  <br/>
alone in the crowd and was being irritating to other kids for lack of  <br/>
a better way to be, I would find a job for that kid, meaning a  <br/>
responsibility of some sort.  I would ask them for help.  I would  <br/>
send them on errands, ask them to help take things out to cars, or  <br/>
down to the gym, or anything I could find to make them feel more  <br/>
grown and needed and important.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking as an oldest child, the resentment when other kids come  <br/>
along can just build up into a screaming fury, especially if the mom  <br/>
is blaming the oldest for things that go wrong.  His piece of the pie  <br/>
has dwindled to nearly nothing, and now his dad&#39;s gone (again).   <br/>
Don&#39;t expect him to help you be emotionally stable.  He&#39;s probably  <br/>
worse off than you are.<br/>
<br/>
Not an easy situation.  Is there a military support group or any  <br/>
special-situation therapy available?<br/>

Hi, Dana --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you will get some other replies.<br/>
<br/>
The book _Siblings Without Rivalry_ by Faber and Maizlich (?), has been <br/>
recommended several times in the past on unschooling lists.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ve only got one kid, so no practical experience to share.  But I <br/>
understand that what seems to worry you the most is the lack of visible <br/>
empathy.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Deploy *again* - big red flag jumped up at me on this one, especially <br/>
as he is an oldest boy in a military household. My gut feeling is that <br/>
he doesn&#39;t know how to express the fear, anger, and such - those <br/>
really BIG feelings - that knowing your dad (the only other guy in the <br/>
house) is heading off into harms way AGAIN and I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s <br/>
probably heard a time or two (probably not from you but from others) <br/>
about &#39;being the man of the family&#39; and being tough and all like that. <br/>
But he&#39;s really a scared kid who might never see his dad again. And <br/>
that dichotomy is expressing itself in behaviors that distance him <br/>
from others. Are there other boys he knows and is comfortable around <br/>
within your military community that he can hang out with some? Are <br/>
there get togethers/support for families of deployed personnel where <br/>
you are that might help him? It might really help for him to have <br/>
someplace and someone who is in his shoes to be able to talk this <br/>
stuff out with.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents (worth probably way less than that)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030928241">Dana,<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s rough that Dad is leaving again soon. If you haven&#39;t yet, try to talk to him about it, and make sure he knows how you plan to keep in touch with Dad while he&#39;s gone. If he can spend more one-on-one time with his Dad before he leaves, that might help as well.<br/>
   <br/>
  Other than that, it sounds like he might have a higher need for physical activity right now. I have noticed with my son (who is only 5, but the only boy and Daddy isn&#39;t home much because of his job with the Coast Guard) that when he gets rough with the girls, he hasn&#39;t been outside much; so I try to encourage him to get outside to ride his bike or scooter. That seems to help. <br/>
   <br/>
  I hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-854553112">Well as I figured great and sympathetic advice.  I may not know what <br/>
to do sometimes, but this list sure is good at helping me to look at <br/>
it from a different perspective.  <br/>
<br/>
This is not the first deployment for sure, but it has been a pretty <br/>
rough year and dad has been gone alot.  There isn&#39;t much I can do <br/>
about that aspect of it, but I can see to it that he has more free <br/>
time and more mom time (when and if he wants it).  I can only <br/>
imagine what it must be like to be the oldest child of five, only <br/>
boy, who&#39;s dad seems more like a figment of his imagination! <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t help that I had a bunch of surgeries this past summer and <br/>
that was a real downer for everyone.  I am feeling much better now <br/>
and am able to do a lot more that I even thought that I would be by <br/>
this time.  <br/>
<br/>
I am going to list some activities that he might like to do and then <br/>
ask him to add to it, matter of fact while I am at it I can see if <br/>
the girls would like to do it as well.  One on one time is a little <br/>
more difficult, but can be arranged.  <br/>
<br/>
My son only has a couple of friends and seems to like it that way.  <br/>
His favorite friend&#39;s parents are WAY strict and don&#39;t allow much, <br/>
but did finally after 2 years let him sleep over here the other <br/>
night and I know that the boys would like to do it again and this <br/>
kid is 13 and a really nice kid.  They get along great!  So that is <br/>
a possibility.  <br/>
<br/>
I just recently found out about a whole slew of places that I never <br/>
knew about that I thought the kids might like to check out and I <br/>
don&#39;t have any schedule at all especially when hubby is away like <br/>
this.  It is a fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants kind of life and it is <br/>
wonderful (except the missing dad part).  <br/>
<br/>
I think that Zach does feel that somehow he is responsible to be the <br/>
man and that may very well feel overwhelming to him as well.  <br/>
Something to have dad talk to him about maybe before he leaves.  All <br/>
my kids hold some frustration towards the military life, because <br/>
they didn&#39;t ask for this, but were rather born into it.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just had another situation with him and seemed to be able <br/>
to diffuse it with separation (just he and I for a few minutes) and <br/>
some humor on my part instead of a speech.  I guess I will go with <br/>
what works, this time he walked away smiling and teasing me and I <br/>
still was able to address the issue in a non-confrontational kind of <br/>
way.  I hope that just made sense!?!  Much better none the less.<br/>
<br/>
By the way I mentioned karate to him (it&#39;s not the first time we&#39;ve <br/>
talked about it)and he is still not interested at this time and <br/>
wonders why I keep suggesting it:) LOL  And Sandra, I have found <br/>
some great things to re-read on your site addressing siblings!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you all,<br/>
Dana</div>

Made sense to me.<br/>
Humor, or a short statement without emotion can help.   Sometimes I  <br/>
say &quot;I wish I knew the perfect thing to say&quot; and that&#39;s better than  <br/>
saying a stupid thing, or saying nothing at all which can be really  <br/>
hostile.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334773121">I don&#39;t have a boy that age but a girl.  Some of those same things <br/>
happen here.  For us, it is because of a prepuberty/puberty thing.  <br/>
Huge emotions and physical changes.<br/>
<br/>
It has a lot to do with the knowing that you are getting older, <br/>
wanting more responsibility, and wanting to be a little kid at the <br/>
same time.  It&#39;s very hard!  It has come up several times in the <br/>
last few months that my dd has had to be the &quot;big&quot; girl and really <br/>
wanted and needed to be the &quot;little&quot; girl still.  So, when you have <br/>
younger siblings that still are and act like the little kids, it <br/>
makes it really hard to want the grown up things they desire and all <br/>
that comes with it.<br/>
<br/>
Having personal private space is the only thing that has helped us.  <br/>
Well, being extra nice and making sure she still can be the little <br/>
kid sometimes helps too.  Having a dog helps too, that unconditional <br/>
ear always your friend no matter what thing.<br/>
<br/>
Another aspect that you may want to think about is how much <br/>
responsibilty does he have with the younger siblings.  I know it can <br/>
be really easy to say to your oldest while they are in the kitchen <br/>
grabbing something to drink, to grab something for their little <br/>
sibling while they are in there.  While it never hurts to ask, what <br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to do, is go in and offer to get both for both even <br/>
if the older doesn&#39;t have a problem getting it herself.  It&#39;s just a <br/>
nice way to DO for someone else, especially a kid that wants to be <br/>
big and little at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;ll still allow it, hugs help too.</div>

Could you take him to a class just to watch, and maybe talk to the  teacher?  <br/>
Karate seems like it would be such a big help to him, especially  if the <br/>
teacher is a male.  Can you get ahold of any cool Jackie Chan  movies, or Bruce <br/>
(or Brandon) Lee?  Or even better, how about Teenage  Mutant Ninja Turtles or <br/>

 <br/>
Maybe he just doesn&#39;t know enough about it, and he&#39;s a little timid about  <br/>

My heart goes out to him...we were former military, not career (my husband)  <br/>
and before we adopted, my son was the only boy with 3 sisters!  <br/>

big ol&#39; dragon statue on a table in the driveway. I made a quick u-<br/>
turn, and discovered that the sale was actually by a guy who owned a <br/>
store that had to go out of business. I got this cool dragon-holding-a-<br/>
crystal-ball statue (its about a foot high or taller, and heavy), the <br/>
ball lights up for about $40, and a cool long sword (the kind you <br/>
might use to slay a dragon) for less than $20. I also got a couple <br/>
more sword-y type instruments (daggers, i guess)...anyhow thats a very <br/>
late update to my post about whether it would be safe to get my son a <br/>
sword, months and months ago. <br/>
<br/>
If you do a search on swords there are tons of online swords selling <br/>
reproductions for way less than $100. My son&#39;s sword isnt heavy, came <br/>
with a leather scabbard, and isnt that sharp. <br/>

How about a mini trampoline indoors for exercise?  My kids have always <br/>
bounced on everything, but this has been great for them.  They just get on <br/>
it for a minute or two when the impulse strikes.  I got it after people <br/>
here were extolling its virtues for mom exercise.  (I&#39;ve been using it <br/>
before they wake up with some good dance music...)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that has been fun for them is bouncing on an exercise <br/>
ball.  But they can pop.  Ours always seems to find its way to the floor <br/>
heater too.  Suicidal ball.<br/>

had to stop and ask myself why I was feeling this way.  I think it <br/>
is because I have tried to talk and listen, but he doesn&#39;t really <br/>
want to discuss anything.  It is as if he knows things are not okay, <br/>
but either doesn&#39;t want to talk about it and/or work to try and come <br/>
up with a better solution OR that maybe he feels overwhelmed and <br/>
doesn&#39;t even know where to start to really express himself.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was initially writing the post to ask for advice, I didn&#39;t <br/>
really know where to start or how to communicate my thoughts and <br/>
needs to you all so that what I wrote would give you a clear picture <br/>
of what was going on and what I was asking you for.  There have also <br/>
been many times in my life where I have been unsure why I felt or <br/>
acted a particular way, but whatever brought out the reaction in me <br/>
was strong enough to evoke it so it must have been real, at least to <br/>
me.  So I can only believe that whatever is stirring this up in him <br/>
is real to him too.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have all the answers and I can&#39;t change my husband&#39;s career <br/>
choice.  Although, I do have many misgivings about it and have <br/>
voiced these concerns to my spouse.  I am trying to work with what I <br/>
can change and go from there.  I want my children to be happy, feel <br/>
loved, be kind and patient, while at the same time I want to <br/>
personally be happy, loving towards others (especially my children), <br/>
to be able to show kindness and patience and a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to understand where all this behavior is coming from, <br/>
not just focus on the behavior itself.  In the past when dad has <br/>
gone away there have been things that the kids felt responsible for <br/>
because my health had been poor.  This time I am doing so much <br/>
better and they haven&#39;t had to feel responsible for so much.  I hope <br/>
to continue on this path.  This deployment may bring back memories <br/>
of how hard things were last time for him (all of them for that <br/>
matter).  We also dealt with a lot of hurricanes here in Florida <br/>
during the last 6 month deployment - that was no fun and doesn&#39;t <br/>
have good memories attached to that either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that to say that there were some icky memories associated <br/>
with the last long deployment and that could be some of it.  The <br/>
point is, that I am trying to make some sense of it so that I can <br/>
hopefully help all the people in our family to cope better and to <br/>
have other outlets for their emotions rather than be directed <br/>
hurtfully at each other.<br/>
<br/>
I have never been in my kids&#39; shoes.  I never had a father deploy, I <br/>
was never the oldest of 5 children, I never lived away from extended <br/>
family, I always went to public school.  On the other hand I never <br/>
was respected, never allowed to have opinions that didn&#39;t line up <br/>
with my parents, I was raised with discipline and punishment for <br/>
stepping out of their (my parents)lines.  I don&#39;t want this for my <br/>
children.  I don&#39;t want to coerce them into being nice, well <br/>
behaved, soft spoken little puppets.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I do want to respect my children for who they <br/>
are, what their needs, hopes, dreams and desires are even if they <br/>
don&#39;t line up with mine.  I want this because I love them and I want <br/>
them to be happy and partly as well because they are going to be my <br/>
grandchildren&#39;s parents one day;-)  I want these things because I <br/>
believe it is right that they have it and my hope is that they will <br/>
in turn grow understand the benefit of extending these same <br/>
principles and emotional behaviors towards others in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
I just want a joy filled home, to the best that I can give my <br/>
children.  Sometimes shouldering the responsibility for my family <br/>
and trying to be a good mother and wife gets a little overwhelming <br/>
for me.  That is why I love this list.  It helps me to write it <br/>
down, try to step back from the situation and allow others help me <br/>
see the things I might be missing or at least see them from another <br/>
perspective.  <br/>
<br/>
After re-reading your post and thinking about what it really said, I <br/>
feel like you were trying to tell me that you felt that I was <br/>
analyizing this so much that I wasn&#39;t really listening to my son in <br/>
either actions and words.  You have helped me to see that sometimes <br/>
maybe I just need to stop talking altogether and just listen.  <br/>
Thanks in a odd sort of way for helping me to get my emotions a <br/>
little stirred up.  I feel very challenged to make things better and <br/>
will try whatever will work to have all the members of this family <br/>
be happy both inside and out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849291058">I have a 13 year old who went through a similar problem. I found <br/>
getting him to write about his feelings helped. He is a person who <br/>
hates to write. It&#39;s to laborious for him, but he did do it  and he <br/>
did find it helpful. You may want to ask someone else to listen to <br/>
him too. Does he do sports or physical activities with other boys? <br/>
This is important. I had trouble finding this for my son because all <br/>
the neighbours etc were in school and had homework etc. We&#39;ve found <br/>
Karate and soccer to be helpful. It teaches discipline while giving <br/>
them an opportunity to relieve stress. Drawing and painting feelings <br/>
can also be useful in revealing and releasing pent up emotions that <br/>
kids have difficulty expressing. <br/>

&gt; I could find him something more along those lines??? Any ideas???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was recently doing a lot of looking around for different martial<br/>
arts schools for my 9yo. I found a couple of sites that had really<br/>
good explanations of the different kinds of martial arts, whether they<br/>
used weapons, etc. some of them also had links to international<br/>
associations, with some lists of schools by area (didn&#39;t seem like<br/>
complete lists, but a place to start, anyway) I don&#39;t know if I still<br/>
have the sites bookmarked; I&#39;ll check when I get back to my own<br/>
computer and post them on this thread.  <br/>
<br/>
Karate usually doesn&#39;t use weapons (I guess &quot;karate&quot; means &quot;open hand&quot;<br/>
or &quot;empty hand&quot; in Japanese) but there are others that do. Gabriel<br/>
ended up going to a Tae Kwon Do class, because some unschooling<br/>
friends of ours were going, plus the master teaches a small class just<br/>
for homeschoolers in the middle of the day. In Tae Kwon Do they use<br/>
nun-chucks, eventually, maybe other weapons too.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when I first read your question, I thought you were referring<br/>
only to the movies, and I thought of Shanghai Noon and Shanghai<br/>
Knights with Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Not midieval, but Victorian,<br/>
and fun. they have some sexual innuendo/humor in them, but my 9yo<br/>
watched them with us, and it was no big deal for him.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we really love movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Hero;<br/>
and The House of Flying Daggers. While they&#39;re not European midieval<br/>
type movies, they are in that heroic/epic vein, plus they&#39;re<br/>
beautifully filmed and have awesome fight scenes. My son&#39;s favorite<br/>
one is The House of Flying Daggers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684880808">Home-schooled until he was nine, Ansel Adams resisted formal  <br/>
education. After he had difficulties in a string of San Francisco  <br/>
schools, Adams&#39; parents decided enrolling him anywhere else would be  <br/>
futile. He received the rest of his education from his father,  <br/>
tutors, the Panama Pacific Exhibition, and the world around him.<br/>
<br/>
An enthusiastic beachcomber and insect collector, young Ansel lived  <br/>
in acute awareness of nature. Adams would later credit his father for  <br/>
tolerating his unusual path, saying, &quot;I am certain he established the  <br/>
positive direction of my life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In School<br/>
...Each day was a severe test for me, sitting in a dreadful classroom  <br/>
while the sun and fog played outside. Most of the information  <br/>
received meant absolutely nothing to me. For example, I was chastised  <br/>
for not being able to remember what states border Nebraska and what  <br/>
are the states of the Gulf Coast. It was simply a matter of  <br/>
memorizing the names, nothing about the process of memorizing or any  <br/>
reason to memorize. Education without either meaning or excitement is  <br/>
impossible. I longed for the outdoors, leaving only a small part of  <br/>
my conscious self to pay attention to schoolwork... (p. 17)<br/>

I got this from a PBS website.<br/>
<br/>
Excerpts are from Ansel Adams, An Autobiography. With Mary Street  <br/>
Alinder. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1985. I haven&#39;t read it,  <br/>
just ran across this bit.<br/>

<br/>
One of his Ansel Adams&#39; most  famous photos was taken within a mile  <br/>
of the house of my first boyfriend, who lived in Hernandez, which is  <br/>
the first town NW of Espanola.  It&#39;s not a &quot;town&quot; in the legal sense,  <br/>
but is an area that&#39;s had a placename for over 100 years and probably  <br/>
had a post office at one time.<br/>
<br/>
Keith was in an airport in California Friday morning, with a Mormon  <br/>
co-worker who has five children, all in public school (his wife works  <br/>
full time).  Keith didn&#39;t tell me exactly what brought it up (I think  <br/>
they were overhearing someone else&#39;s complaints about kids and  <br/>
school), but Keith told him something like &quot;I have to try hard not to  <br/>
proselytize about unschooling, because it just works.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>
