My kids are still younger so I may not really have any good answers, but I <br/>
would think that you just continue what you&#39;ve done all along except move on <br/>
the more complex thoughts.  For example, when you are clothes shopping, they <br/>
always have % off sales.  Let them figure out what the sales price will be.  <br/>
I know that my dh has already had my ds figuring out algebraic expressions <br/>
when shopping (my ds is 5).  Usually my husband is more responsible for this <br/>
than I am because I am more right brain, he more left.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps even a little.  By the way, I laughed at your previous tag <br/>
about getting your 3 yo off the computer at 10:30pm.  Mine has been up <br/>
playing with her dad (him on one computer, her on the other) until well past <br/>
midnight :)<br/>

&gt;Date: Thu, 29 Jun 2000 02:50:27 PDT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, to move along, how do you guys unschool math? Thats a tough one for me,<br/>
&gt;as it doesn&#39;t seem to come up in my kids daily lives without my pushing it.<br/>
&gt;I found it very easy when the kids were young-I remember asking &quot;How many<br/>
&gt;plates would we need on the table if Aunt Christy were coming to dinner?&quot;<br/>
&gt;and everyone knew fractions pretty well just because we were doing good to<br/>
&gt;find one measuring cup when we made cookies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now that they are older though, it is a little more unnerving to me. On one<br/>
&gt;hand I think that I didn&#39;t understand algebra after taking it, and it <br/>
&gt;hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;hurt me, but on the other hand, will they be limited by not learning higher<br/>
&gt;math as children?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;TIA<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Personally ... I don&#39;t truly unschool math because I&#39;m math phobic and<br/>
get a little acared about the lack of math skills.<br/>
We use Miquon and Key Curriculum&#39; Key to ... series of work books. Math<br/>
isn&#39;t forced on them but I prefer it if they do  a couple of worksheets<br/>
out of there books 3 or 4 times a week.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are happy with that and take control of all their other<br/>
learning.<br/>
Someday I hope to be relaxed enough to let them take on the<br/>
responsibility for there math by themselves.<br/>
<br/>
This is just my own personal phobia about math. I struggled so hard<br/>
through school with it and I just want my kids to be confidant in their<br/>
math skills.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993045267">Hi Jeanne ...<br/>
<br/>
actually, sewing does contain a LOT of math or @ least it did when my MOM<br/>
sew&#39;d, haha ... my mother made EVERYTHING when we were little and bless her<br/>
heart, she still does @ 77 yo!!!<br/>
<br/>
wellllllllllllll, lets see ... first we&#39;d start out w/ using the measuring<br/>
tape to figure out the correct pattern size (add/sub), then we&#39;d figure out<br/>
how much material we needed to buy b/c one of her pet peeves was overbuying<br/>
material (add/sub/multip/div) ... we always bought everything on sale b/c<br/>
her goal was to make the dress/whatever cheaper than what we could buy it<br/>
for b/c otherwise what&#39;s the point of making it (haha, you&#39;d have to know<br/>
mom!  so, I guess that was more of a lesson in economics) ... then we had to<br/>
figure those 25%, 50% sale prices out b/f we selected the material &lt;G&gt;   ...<br/>
she loved to use contrasting material for collars/cuffs<br/>
/whatever to set off the dress, so we figured out how much contrasting<br/>
material to buy if the pattern didn&#39;t give the info (more<br/>
add/sub/multip/div) ... on and on, I could sit here for the rest of the day<br/>
telling what my mother used to come up w/ trying to incorporate math in her<br/>
sewing ... OH, I forgot the buttons, there are so many diff button sizes and<br/>
we used fractions to figure these out ... my sisters and I had so much fun<br/>
digging throught the  sale bins to find a set of matching buttons ... this<br/>
was great fun, I still enjoy doing this today!!!  course I haven&#39;t even<br/>
started talking about using math while CUTTING OUT OR SEWING ... was the<br/>
seam 3/4 or 5/8 in wide or were you supposed to trim the seams to 1/4 or 1/2<br/>
in, etc, etc ... but we talked about FRACTIONS, %&#39;s, $$$, add/sub/multip,<br/>
division/METRIC don&#39;t forget converting everything to metric, mom did this<br/>
b/f the pattern cos converted, lol ...<br/>
<br/>
and, yes if your curious ... I *ADORE* sewing and English smocking today<br/>
(this called for math, too!!!)  but *uhhhhh*, do I enjoy math???   ~~&gt;&gt;<br/>
***NO***!!!  haha ...<br/>
