<div id="ygrps-yiv-894637828">I was wondering if anyone had any input on this.<br/>
We have recently, the last 3-4 months stoped restricting the boys <br/>
candy, they were never really aloud to have it, and so after joining <br/>
this group and doing a lot of dicussing about it we decided to start <br/>
letting the kiddos have candy, when ever they ask for it. In most <br/>
ways it&#39;s working out fine, they almost always want it first thing in <br/>
the morning and they are both willing to eat anything eles in the <br/>
house, so they both eat really well and that&#39;s not the problem that <br/>
we are having. The problem is in the amount of energy increase. <br/>
Now, Jaiden and Avery have never been to keen on naps and they don&#39;t <br/>
take them at all now (they are 1 and 4) they are both very early <br/>
risers (5-6am) and now they are both frequently up until 11pm and <br/>
some nights (depending on the amount of sugar) up until well after <br/>
midnight. We have never inforced a bed time, although we do ask that <br/>
Jaiden watches movies or plays quietly in his room while I nurce <br/>
Avery to sleep. So, on top of the short amount of sleep we are all <br/>
getting (they aren&#39;t really old enough for me to go and take a nap <br/>
and leave them to thier own devices and going to bed before them is <br/>
not an option, at this point) they are so full of energy they ware me <br/>
out just watching them and being that i can only watch before i am <br/>
drafted into all of there adventures, and we have lots of them, I am <br/>
finding my self so tired that i&#39;m rethinking this whole candy thing. <br/>
I don&#39;t want to restict them but I&#39;m at the point that I can&#39;t think <br/>
real clear, I&#39;m so tired. So, those of you that have done this, and <br/>
lived to tell the tale, it will get better wont it?<br/>
I really need some encouragement, I know that this is a big deal to <br/>
them, but I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;ll make it through this period. ;-]<br/>

<br/>
Do you always have candy?<br/>
We don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When we do, it&#39;s not something they have to ask for.  It&#39;s just there.  <br/>
<br/>
What kind of candy are you getting, anyway?  Are there similar options they <br/>
would like?  Yogurt covered raisins?  Fruit rollups?<br/>
<br/>
Variety, not the grossest candy, and not even making them ask for it so it <br/>
doesn&#39;t even seem like a magical &quot;yes&quot; reward...  I don&#39;t know.  It just <br/>
seems that having candy always, making them ask but saying yes somehow misses <br/>
being what people have recommended, but I can&#39;t really figure out how to say <br/>
&quot;that&#39;s not it&quot; without it seeming goofy.  So I&#39;m hoping someone will come <br/>
here and say what I&#39;m failing to say.<br/>
<br/>
There is a continuum in the cookie and candy world.  There&#39;s a difference <br/>
between peanut clusters and gummy worms, it seems to me.  A difference <br/>
between chocolate chip oatmeal cookies and marshmallow pinwheels.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if it&#39;s been just a week or so, it will take longer.  But during this <br/>
&quot;longer,&quot; maybe people who feel their kids aren&#39;t craving sweets will be able <br/>
to paint a better picture of their methods, options, routines, something...<br/>
<br/>
The second batch of brownies I mentioned was cut up and put in a plastic box, <br/>
but right on the counter.  Marty&#39;s birthday came and went.  Thursday Kirby <br/>
and Holly were getting ready to go to a Harry Potter tournament, and I had <br/>
made them scrambled egg sandwiches (Holly&#39;s request--two for Kirby and one <br/>
and a half for her).  I asked if they wanted to take chips, and they wrinkled <br/>
noses.  I asked if they didn&#39;t want to take SOMETHING else, and I looked <br/>
around and saw the brownies.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Brownies!?&quot; Kirby said, so I wrapped up two.<br/>
<br/>
Holly gave hers away to someone as soon as she got there.  She said there&#39;s <br/>
another older boy (teen, I think, from the story) and there&#39;s a joke that she <br/>
always gives him food, so as soon as she walked in he asked if she brought <br/>
him food, and she handed him the brownie.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had another piece of brownie the next afternoon.  Most of it&#39;s still in <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s neither offer nor refuse, like La Leche League says about weaning? <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been this analytical about it for a long time.  I&#39;m hoping by this <br/>
point of reading some of you have figured out what the magic formula might be <br/>
to help Rebecca.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372191839">Hi Elissa, up until 4 months ago we didn&#39;t buy any sugry foods other than friut. After joining this group dh and I dicided to start letting Jaiden and Avery have candy, we looked around and found a couple health food stores that sold all natural candy, and we got a few things, they went over big. Our family (parents and siblings) went a little nuts stocking the boys with candy they were glad we were finally letting the kids be &quot;normal&quot;, thier words not mine so at the moment we have a bunch on hand.<br/>
Although we did by Jaiden a few fruit chewy things earlier this week when he found them at the store. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39702756">Well so far no one has mentioned this so here goes. There have been numerous <br/>
studies conducted that many parents refuse to believe. These studies suggest <br/>
that sugar itself has no bearing on making children hyper.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading up on these studies for years, mostly because I have some <br/>
children who are sweet lovers and some who aren&#39;t. I have never seen in this <br/>
house where too much sugar causes any different behavior. After seeing and <br/>
talking to many parents, I haven&#39;t seen a real difference either. Just my 2 <br/>
cents.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few theories as to why some parents are convinced it&#39;s the <br/>
sugar.<br/>
<br/>
It is believed that when children aren&#39;t allowed the availability of candy, <br/>
then given free reign, it&#39;s the party atmosphere itself which lends the <br/>
children to be extra happy and active. We&#39;ve all seen it at birthday parties <br/>
where candy, ice cream and cake flow to children that finally have an excuse <br/>
to eat as much as they can. Maybe just the restriction itself being lifted <br/>
from not as much candy as you want to go at it, makes the difference in <br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
It is also believed it could possibly be the caffeine in some goodies that <br/>
is causing the hyper behavior. I say hyper as in meaning not sleeping or <br/>
being calm like one would expect. It has been reported that food dyes have <br/>
no affect on most children, but caffeine can.<br/>
<br/>
It has also been said that possibly it&#39;s not the sugar itself, but the food <br/>
it comes from that can cause a change. Like sugar from corn wouldn&#39;t bother <br/>
a child but sugar from sugar beets would. Therefore it&#39;s not really the <br/>
sugar itself but the food it came from.<br/>
<br/>
It is also possible it&#39;s not the sugar itself again, but the lack of other <br/>
&quot;good&quot; foods with it that has an affect. Maybe a child who has been lifted <br/>
of being restricted will eat more candy and less protein for awhile causing <br/>
the change. When it balances out to where the child eats less candy and more <br/>
protein, as time will allow, things get back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
And the last one I can remember is the affect the parent themselves can have <br/>
on the children. The parents behavior affecting the outcome when the <br/>
children have candy. Like saying the candy will make them not sleep and then <br/>
of course the children don&#39;t sleep.<br/>
<br/>
These are just all things I have read and heard and tend to believe on each <br/>
account. Definitely food for thought. Maybe something will make sense to <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670169820">Up until about 4 months ago we never had it at all. Candy was not something that Jason and I ate and was not something that we felt was good for the kids to have. Jaiden had a hard time with this because all around him kids were eating candy and he wasn&#39;t aloud to have it and it made him sad. We did buy him things like yogurt covered raisins and juice pops and he can have all the fruit he wants (it&#39;s all the artifical crap in candy and in processed foods that we don&#39;t like and that I can&#39;t eat with out getting really sick, allergys and such) but those things just wern&#39;t the same. So, once we made the decission to let him have candy we found as many natural candies that we could and bought a few of each and put them out so that the kids could pick and choose at thier will, knowing that the would be like a kid in a candy store &lt;beg&gt; for a while. Jaiden surprised us, he had a few, said he wasn&#39;t sure what all the fuss was about with the kids down stairs, could he please go get some carrots instead. Now he does eat the candy, he does like it and I do think that the sugar keeps him up a little more than normal, but he has been on the go since the day he was born and is just a very hyper kid, so I&#39;m not really as concerened about him as I am about Avery. Avery went nuts with the candy made him self sick a number of times, so we moved the candy out of his reach( but still with in Jaidens) thinking that if it wasn&#39;t right out in front of him it would be a little better. He learned how to climb real quick. So we have to keep it up. <br/>
So, it&#39;s been about 4 months and we don&#39;t really buy much, only when Jaiden asks or something that they love is all gone and it&#39;s been gone for a couple of weeks. Like I said though, the grandparents went nuts at X-mas so we have quite a bit of some things. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-352028930">I understand, it seems to be the same with mine, the only kids I know that are wired after a box of mac&cheese. <br/>
We do buy all natural candies, in fact we found all natural, no fake stuff, organic m&m&#39;s they are sooooooo good, I&#39;m in heaven (I can&#39;t have the colors or flavors either). I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s just the fact that we waited to give them sugary foods and mabey they just don&#39;t process it, haven&#39;t built up any tolerances to it, like Jason can drink a pot of coffee and go to bed, because he&#39;s been drinking it for so long but if I have more than 2 cups I can&#39;t sit still.<br/>
I wonder how long it takes to work up a tolerance?<br/>

  We have recently, the last 3-4 months stoped restricting the boys <br/>
  candy, they were never really aloud to have it, and so after joining <br/>
  this group and doing a lot of dicussing about it we decided to start <br/>
  letting the kiddos have candy, when ever they ask for it. In most <br/>
  ways it&#39;s working out fine, they almost always want it first thing in <br/>
  the morning and they are both willing to eat anything eles in the <br/>
  house, so they both eat really well and that&#39;s not the problem that <br/>
  we are having. The problem is in the amount of energy increase. <br/>
  Now, Jaiden and Avery have never been to keen on naps and they don&#39;t <br/>
  take them at all now (they are 1 and 4) they are both very early <br/>
  risers (5-6am) and now they are both frequently up until 11pm and <br/>
  some nights (depending on the amount of sugar) up until well after <br/>
  midnight. We have never inforced a bed time, although we do ask that <br/>
  Jaiden watches movies or plays quietly in his room while I nurce <br/>
  Avery to sleep. So, on top of the short amount of sleep we are all <br/>
  getting (they aren&#39;t really old enough for me to go and take a nap <br/>
  and leave them to thier own devices and going to bed before them is <br/>
  not an option, at this point) they are so full of energy they ware me <br/>
  out just watching them and being that i can only watch before i am <br/>
  drafted into all of there adventures, and we have lots of them, I am <br/>
  finding my self so tired that i&#39;m rethinking this whole candy thing. <br/>
  I don&#39;t want to restict them but I&#39;m at the point that I can&#39;t think <br/>
  real clear, I&#39;m so tired. So, those of you that have done this, and <br/>
  lived to tell the tale, it will get better wont it?<br/>
  I really need some encouragement, I know that this is a big deal to <br/>
  them, but I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;ll make it through this period. ;-]<br/>
<br/>
  TIA <br/>

&lt;&lt; Well so far no one has mentioned this so here goes. There have been <br/>
numerous <br/>
studies conducted that many parents refuse to believe. These studies suggest <br/>
that sugar itself has no bearing on making children hyper. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to Keith about this tonight, after reading some posts here. <br/>
<br/>
I asked him if he thought I was crazy to think that when parents said sugar <br/>
made kids hyper that it was just the same as when parents used to say coffee <br/>
would stunt their growth--a tale untested by real parents with real kids.<br/>
<br/>
He said he thought maybe so.  That when kids have eaten &quot;too much&quot; sugar (by <br/>
the parents&#39; reckoning) that the parents LOOK for any &quot;bad behavior&quot; to prove <br/>
that it was too much.<br/>
<br/>
I think that in a season when parents have changed rules and it seems like a <br/>
holiday or something very new and different, that that alone might be enough <br/>
to excite them.   Any freedom a usually-limited kid gets is going to be <br/>
stimulating and exciting.  Maybe that is what causes the heightened mood.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I have never seen in this <br/>
house where too much sugar causes any different behavior. After seeing and <br/>
talking to many parents, I haven&#39;t seen a real difference either. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never once seen it.  But I have seen parents say &quot;See?  Too much sugar&quot; <br/>
just because a kid was excited about being at a birthday party, or excited <br/>
about being able to roast marshmallows on a real fire, or excited to be at my <br/>
house making cookies or whatever the exciting (and different) thing was.<br/>
<br/>
(I wrote the above before reading the rest of Mary&#39;s post, where I see some <br/>
of those points have been made. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
It is also possible it&#39;s not the sugar itself again, but the lack of other <br/>
&quot;good&quot; foods with it that has an affect. Maybe a child who has been lifted <br/>
of being restricted will eat more candy and less protein for awhile causing <br/>
the change. When it balances out to where the child eats less candy and more <br/>
protein, as time will allow, things get back to normal.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The sleep-inducing foods to go with it.  Something heavier and soothing.  <br/>

<br/>
Hmmm, I always thought that sugar did have an affect, I can feel the affects when  I have a lot of sweets (refined sugars that is, fruits don&#39;t have the same effect), but then i was always told that certain sugars affected the body and mind in different ways, wonder if all this time it&#39;s been only in my mind ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is believed that when children aren&#39;t allowed the availability of candy, <br/>
then given free reign, it&#39;s the party atmosphere itself which lends the <br/>
children to be extra happy and active. We&#39;ve all seen it at birthday parties <br/>
where candy, ice cream and cake flow to children that finally have an excuse <br/>
to eat as much as they can. Maybe just the restriction itself being lifted <br/>
from not as much candy as you want to go at it, makes the difference in <br/>
behavior.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This i find interesting, because the one that the candy seems to affects Avery (1.5) the most and he hasn&#39;t had the restrictions on the candy that Jaiden has had, at the same time though, Jaiden has always been so very active that if he&#39;s a little more so than normal it&#39;s still not as noticable as Avery that has always been so calm, in comparision to Jaiden i&#39;ve been told by other parents they don&#39;t know how I do it with two &quot;such active and hyper&quot; boys. Avery just can&#39;t sit still and is sleeping so much less than before.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is also believed it could possibly be the caffeine in some goodies that <br/>
is causing the hyper behavior. I say hyper as in meaning not sleeping or <br/>
being calm like one would expect. It has been reported that food dyes have <br/>
no affect on most children, but caffeine can.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now I know that food dyes affect me, but I have crazy food alerrgies, but then I&#39;m allergic to just about everything, and we had just assumed that the boys inherited it from me, due to thier behavoir after having things that contain food dye, and i&#39;m talking about things like canned corn with colors added or mac&cheese, not candy. (oh yah, I do know what happens when you assume stuff ;-)). Also other than chocolate are their candies that contain caffine?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It has also been said that possibly it&#39;s not the sugar itself, but the food <br/>
it comes from that can cause a change. Like sugar from corn wouldn&#39;t bother <br/>
a child but sugar from sugar beets would. Therefore it&#39;s not really the <br/>
sugar itself but the food it came from.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm, very interesting, time to google.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is also possible it&#39;s not the sugar itself again, but the lack of other <br/>
&quot;good&quot; foods with it that has an affect. Maybe a child who has been lifted <br/>
of being restricted will eat more candy and less protein for awhile causing <br/>
the change. When it balances out to where the child eats less candy and more <br/>
protein, as time will allow, things get back to normal.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now both boys eat very well, lots of fresh fruit and veggies, lots of good food (we are a family that enjoys cooking and eating) Although Avery will not eat meat of any kind at all. So mabey he&#39;s not getting enough protein. I&#39;ll try to watch him over the next few days, he&#39;s a grazer and doesn&#39;t eat a &quot;meal&quot; so I&#39;ll have to watch and see what he is really eating.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;,And the last one I can remember is the affect the parent themselves can have <br/>
on the children. The parents behavior affecting the outcome when the <br/>
children have candy. Like saying the candy will make them not sleep and then <br/>
of course the children don&#39;t sleep.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I have ever said this, at least not in front of the kids, but i am sure that they are picking up on my worries, and honestly as tired as i have been the last few weeks i can&#39;t vouch for anything.<br/>
<br/>
These are just all things I have read and heard and tend to believe on each <br/>
account. Definitely food for thought. Maybe something will make sense to <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Mary B<br/>
<br/>
could you tell me where you have gotten your info, I&#39;d like to look in to it. Thanx<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655570929">I&#39;m guessing maybe for the same reason some people thought people who didn&#39;t <br/>
limit video games were buying dozens of games at $50 a pop, some people think <br/>
letting kids eat candy means buying any and all most sugar-bomb of all candy.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
It means not &quot;criminalizing&quot; candy or measuring it out by the bite or the <br/>
ounce.<br/>
<br/>
There are some kinds of sweets I have never had in my house as an adult.  <br/>
Twinkies. Never.  <br/>
The only cookies I&#39;ve bought in the past year were the sugar wafers (cheap, <br/>
three colors; that might have been over a year), oreos (twice?) and Orange <br/>
Milanos by Pepperidge Farm.   When/if the cookies are here, they belong to <br/>
whoever wants to eat them.  None went all at once.  <br/>
<br/>
Candy is more common.  Keith bought a case (36 bars?  more?) from Costco two <br/>
weeks ago,  They&#39;re half gone.  I had one tonight while watching a movie, <br/>
while a visiting adult friend finished off all the brownies (four or five <br/>
brownies &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
<br/>
We never have any plain sugar candy like suckers or jawbreakers.   Marty like<br/>
s Kit Kats and Reeses, and that&#39;s what was in his Christmas stocking.  He <br/>
still has some.<br/>

I went to google and put in <br/>
<br/>
affect sugar hyper research<br/>
<br/>
and got lots of articles, all of which are saying in double-blind studies, <br/>
they didn&#39;t find a difference between kids with sugar-free same and other <br/>
kids had with sugar.<br/>
<br/>
 Main Page : Education Programs : Ask A Scientist! : Q&A<br/>
<br/>
Sugar does not cause hyperactive behavior<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Does sugar make you hyper if you eat a lot of it?<br/>
<br/>
 The answer is no, despite the fact that so many people believe this to be <br/>
true. Many carefully controlled studies have been conducted to test this idea <br/>
and failed to find any effect of sugar consumption on children&#39;s behavior. <br/>
Why, then do so many people believe that sugar causes hyperactivity in <br/>
children? One possibility is that parent&#39;s beliefs affect what they see. In <br/>
one recent study, a group of children thought to be &quot;behaviorally sensitive&quot; <br/>
to sugar were studied. The children were divided into two groups. The mothers <br/>
of one group were told that their children were given a drink with a lot of <br/>
sugar. The mothers of the other group were told that their children had been <br/>
given a drink that did not contain sugar. All children had actually been <br/>
given a drink sweetened with Nutrasweet. The mothers who thought that their <br/>
children had had sugar rated them as more hyperactive than the other mothers. <br/>
These results suggest that parents&#39; and teachers&#39; beliefs about sugar affect <br/>
their perceptions of children&#39;s behavior. Another possibility is that parents <br/>
who believe that sugar makes their children hyperactive only allow them to <br/>
have sugar for special occasions, such as birthday parties or family <br/>
gatherings. These are occasions where children tend to be somewhat excited <br/>
and active anyway. Then when the parents see their children being very active <br/>
and excited, they think that it is due to the sugar. But regardless of the <br/>
reason for people&#39;s erroneous beliefs about this, it is quite clear that <br/>
sugar does not produce hyperactivity, even when researchers have specifically <br/>
focused on children with a presumed &quot;sugar sensitivity&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324242869">My dad, the shrink, told me YEARS ago--when I was a child---that the sugar = <br/>
hyperactivity was a crock. I still hear almost DAILY parents&#39; complaining <br/>
about sugar intake. That it makes their kids crazy. That it rots their teeth. <br/>
That they can&#39;t sleep.<br/>
<br/>
How &#39;bout the kid&#39;s so excited to FINALLY get some? How &#39;bout genetically bad <br/>
teeth? How &#39;bout the excitement of whatever/whereever the child WAS when he <br/>
got the candy?     And what about the complex <br/>
sugars----potatoes/pasta/carrots/bread????? Do THEY not cause hyperactivity <br/>
or rot teeth?<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me it&#39;s one of those old wive&#39;s tales. Children aren&#39;t allowed sugar <br/>
because the parent wants to keep it for her/himSELF!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen any difference in &quot;before&quot; or &quot;after&quot; sugar intake in ME or <br/>
my children. And maybe it&#39;s just the mindset that my father gave me as a <br/>
child---that sugar wasn&#39;t &quot;bad&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I know there have been studies done that say sugar does NOT cause <br/>
hyperactivity. Have there been ANY done to say that it DOES????<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51312351">I have to agree that sugery foods don&#39;t seem to make my kids more &quot;hyper&quot;,<br/>
but with two of my three sugar on an empty stomach will lead to MAJOR<br/>
meltdowns.  I first noticed it when my oldest stopped nursing through the<br/>
night, at about 2.5 .  He would wake up screaming, crying or just incredibly<br/>
irritable.  Within two or three minutes of drinking a cup of juice he would<br/>
be fine.  It took me six months to realize that I had half an hour to feed<br/>
him, or he would crash again.  As he got older, and his brother came along I<br/>
realized that whenever either one on them had sugery foods without anything<br/>
else all hell would break loose!  Now, when they want ice cream or candy<br/>
they will eat a handful of peanuts or a piece of cheese or meat first<br/>
(protein seems to be the most effective).  Or we eat sweets right after a<br/>
meal.  One  problem I have, though, is that when they get overly hungry they<br/>
sometimes melt down (And I mean really meltdown-screaming, fighting, being<br/>
totally hysterical!).  I can tell it&#39;s food related, but if I try to offer<br/>
them some juice or food, they refuse and say it&#39;s not because they&#39;re<br/>
hungry.  If I can get them to drink a little juice you can watch the tension<br/>
drain from their bodies.  We have discussed this a lot, but they still don&#39;t<br/>
seem to be aware of when they are heading for a crash.<br/>
<br/>
BTW- They are 7 and 10<br/>

It helps to be aware. And NOT blame the sugar!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll agree with this. They&#39;re GROWING. They need calories. It doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
come from sugar,  certainly---but that&#39;s the quickest/easiest way. (If the <br/>
parent will stay aware of eating habits, she can keep snacks available <br/>
throughout the day.) As toddlers and teens, they need more sleep and more <br/>
calories to grow. Have you ever seen a 16 year old eat? And sleep? HUGE <br/>
amounts. Because he&#39;s growing. Another huge problem with schools: teens&#39;re <br/>
given one twenty minute period to eat---all day. They should have many <br/>
opportunities to snack---and nap! Like at home! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&gt; them some juice or food, they refuse and say it&#39;s not because they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; hungry.  If I can get them to drink a little juice you can watch the <br/>
&gt; tension<br/>
&gt; drain from their bodies.  We have discussed this a lot, but they still <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem to be aware of when they are heading for a crash.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Carly responded the same way at this age. I&#39;ve observed many a person with <br/>
diabetes exhibit similar symptoms (meltdown, irrational) when their blood <br/>
sugar is bottoming out (this does not mean that your children have diabetes, <br/>
just that their blood sugar is dropping). If you observe the symptoms <br/>
earlier, it is easier to convince them of what&#39;s happening, before they <br/>
become totally irrational. Luckily Carly quickly learned the correlation <br/>
between her sudden mood changes and the need for food. She&#39;d be crying <br/>
saying, &quot;My blood sugar is dropping; I need some food.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
With diabetics, we&#39;d give them a combination of a quick sugar and a <br/>
slow-release sugar (fat/protein). Peanut butter and juice are mainstays at <br/>
the special needs camp I worked in. The kids and counselors were pretty <br/>
cognizant of the symptoms, but occasionally they took too long to come to us. <br/>
It was hard to convince the kids that they needed to get some sugar into <br/>
them. Once we got the quick sugar in, we always followed it with the slow <br/>
sugars.<br/>
<br/>
Early intervention is the name of the game, along with combination of sugars. <br/>
Cheese cubes/yogurt are other good long-lasting sugars. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

Isn&#39;t juice sugar, pretty much?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Now, when they want ice cream or candy<br/>
they will eat a handful of peanuts or a piece of cheese or meat first<br/>
(protein seems to be the most effective).  Or we eat sweets right after a<br/>
meal.  One  problem I have, though, is that when they get overly hungry they<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember giving babies candy at all.<br/>
If there are older kids in the house, maybe they&#39;ll end up with some, but <br/>
they&#39;ll probably be just as happy or happier with other finger-foods.  <br/>
Crackers and cheese.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t put unlimited candy where babies could get it, but I wouldn&#39;t take <br/>
candy away and use it as a reward for eating meat or vegetables, either.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t do dessert here, and I think that&#39;s a BIG part of why the kids <br/>
aren&#39;t sweets hounds.  They were never, ever trained to think that sweet food <br/>
was the paycheck for eathing things they didn&#39;t really like much.  We never <br/>
made them eat anything, and never shamed them out of eating anything, so <br/>
their choices are real (can&#39;t think of a better word.  Honest?  Natural?  <br/>
none are it).<br/>
<br/>
Kids can come to that without it having been a longterm thing, same as with <br/>
unschooling.  But it takes a while, and the better the parents are at <br/>
explaining why and at being confident, the sooner and the better it will <br/>
probably work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106511402">I&#39;m understanding, really I am. So, after my last post and talking to my dad Jason and I brought the candy out of the cubboard and put in in a bowl and put it on the coffee table, the kids were in the other room when we did it, we also put out a bowl of trail mix, my fave, and a bowl of pretzels, Jasons fave, the kids came running through the LR and saw the candy sitting there, eyed it and asked if they could have some, Jason smiled and said, &#39;go ahead, it&#39;s sitting there, no need to ask&#39; and went back to reading and munching on pretzles, snagging a candy here and there. Jaiden said &quot;cool&quot; and ran off to go build something, Avery said &quot;ool&quot; snaged an m&m and a peanut and ran off to knock down what ever it was that Jaiden is building, threre fave game at the moment.<br/>
So, I know that it&#39;s a start and I&#39;m trying real hard to let go of stuff, but its only been a few hours and I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s gonna stay with me for a while. Baby steps, right?<br/>
