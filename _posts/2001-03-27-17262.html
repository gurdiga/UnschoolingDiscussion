<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110785653">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined the group today.  We homeschooled for several years, <br/>
then I took a job at a local private school and my children went <br/>
there for 5 years.  My older one is 16 and wants to be in the Army, <br/>
which you have to have a diploma to get into, so he&#39;s continuing on <br/>
until he graduates.  My 10 year old is finishing 4th grade in May, <br/>
and then we are going back to unschooling.  He is very intelligent <br/>
and eagar to learn.  Working in a school just brought back to me <br/>
how much time is wasted there.  Everyday kids would come into <br/>
my office and I would take their temperature, and send them home <br/>
if they were sick.  The parents always brought them back to school <br/>
next day even if they had a temperature, because they didn&#39;t want <br/>
to take off work, or because, according to state law, they could <br/>
only miss ten days.  I thought how sad it was that people have to <br/>
sacrifice their health, both physical and emotional, to meet some <br/>
arbitrary state standard.  I&#39;m so glad to be out of there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am starting an unschooling group here in town.  I don&#39;t <br/>
even know if there are any other unschoolers here.  I know there is <br/>
a Christian Homeschooling group, but they focus on very structured <br/>
curriculum, and I&#39;m not interested in that.  <br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to enjoy and exploring life with my son, <br/>
without any time constraints or anybody telling us what we have to <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to lots of good information from this group.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
