<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857892605">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
I have a problem that I need some input on by parents who won&#39;t just tell me that my children just need to learn who is boss!<br/>
<br/>
When anyone visits, often my 11 year old son, James, likes to listen to the conversation. While this is okay by me most of the time, sometimes its not. He doesn&#39;t like to let anything go past without understanding it. So he keeps interrupting the conversation with &quot;What did she say?&quot;, &quot;What did she mean when she said...&quot;, &quot;What did you mean when you said that...&quot; &quot;How...&quot; and so on. Whilst in principal I see no reason why he shouldn&#39;t be there or shouldn&#39;t take part in the conversation, his need for constant explanations kills the conversation. The person I am trying to talk to becomes frustrated, I become frustrated, we forget what we were talking about and often run out of time. On one occasion, a friend was trying to introduce me to someone, but James was so demanding that she ended up turning to the lady, throwing up her hands and saying &quot;It&#39;s impossible to talk to Sue.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I get to a stage where I ask him to let me have a talk on my own to whoever, he is hurt and feels ostracized (He suffered a lot with bullying when in school) and just genuinely doesn&#39;t understand why I would need to talk to someone without him there. I then have to try and explain that we are not talking about him, not talking about anything top secret but that we do want to talk and are having trouble having a conversation with his over involvement. I try to explain that a conversation involves listening and talking but that with his constant questions he is monopolizing the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes too there are conversations which are beyond his experience and whilst I don&#39;t want to give the impression that they are top secret, the conversation can&#39;t go beyond his understanding while he insists on a dictionary definition of every word. <br/>
<br/>
I do find the situation is a lot less stressful around people who have a more accepting view of children - unschoolers in particular but it still happens at a lower level. With people who expect to be able to talk exclusively to me and that the children will just go and play quietly somewhere, his needs seem to quadruple and I end up feeling overwhelmed by the struggle of trying to have a conversation. Then I hesitate to ask him to go away, because I know they will expect me to tell him to go away and punish him if he doesn&#39;t. I don&#39;t want to do that. When I ask him to go away he doesn&#39;t understand ends up crying and still doesn&#39;t go away. End of conversation.<br/>
<br/>
We have come so far in the time since we left school and began unschooling (two and a half years ago), but the emotional school scars are still there and I find it frustrating that visitors usually don&#39;t get to see us as we now are - far more relaxed and comfortable with each other - because of this conversation stress.<br/>
<br/>
I want to respect James&#39; need for explanations, but also be able to meet my need to talk to people.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone got any advice?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018393752">Hi Susan,<br/>
I am new to this list and hope I am not overstepping my bounds here:<br/>
 <br/>
But it sounds like James will be a great reporter some day! With his<br/>
keen sense to every detail and his persistent personality along with his<br/>
eagerness to know so much.<br/>
 <br/>
Just a suggestion but why don’t you try to give him a small notebook<br/>
and pencil and let him write down all the things he doesn’t know and<br/>
wants to know more about instead of interrupting you at the time.<br/>
Perhaps explain it to him as a game of “reporter” the idea being to be<br/>
as quiet as possible so he doesn’t miss any details… then he will be<br/>
so busy writing instead of talking….Then you guys could spend some<br/>
quality time afterwards going over the questions and this would give him<br/>
what he ultimately wants which is your undivided attention.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146122814">Hi Susan, <br/>
I was thinking this same thing (why not try giving him a pencil and<br/>
pad of paper so that he could write down his questions without<br/>
interupting and then you can go over eveything with him after the<br/>
conversation) as I was reading your post.  I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t the only<br/>
one with that thought.<br/>
