<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780347553">Firstly, Stephanie I have followed this thread and know you want it <br/>
closed, but to me I feel your husband&#39;s attempt to control a natural <br/>
function of YOUR body is the tip of the iceberg in his controlling <br/>
behaviour, it is an abuse to both you and your child.   I would be <br/>
concerned about what this childish behaviour of his is a precursor <br/>
to, I seriously think he needs counselling.<br/>

Welcome Damian, good to hear a man&#39;s perspective on this <br/>
subject.<br/>

&gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>

&gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>
&gt; watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>
&gt; scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>
&gt; their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>
&gt; melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>
&gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>
&gt; missed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>
&gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>
&gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>
&gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But Damian, some men see this obviously very intimate <br/>
relationship as excluding them, whereas you are drawn into the <br/>
intimacy and become a part of it.<br/>
There is no denying the sensuality of breast feeding, and I feel this <br/>
is what can be a problem for some men, and women too.<br/>
Our warped view of the body mainly stemming from religious beliefs <br/>
where the natural and beautiful functions of the body are made <br/>
sinful, has caused too many people to regard breast feeding as a <br/>
deviant behaviour.<br/>
When I breast fed my first child [I turned 18 two days before his <br/>
birth] I encountered a lot of negative vibes from society in general, <br/>
this was back in &#39;73.  If I was out anywhere with him I would rush <br/>
home to feed him, I was uncomfortable nursing in front of anyone <br/>
except for my husband, and this was a real pity.  With each baby I <br/>
noticed society&#39;s perception of breast feeding changing, it got to <br/>
the point when I had my last baby in &#39;96, that people are more <br/>
likely to frown on a woman giving a baby a bottle than seeing a <br/>
woman nursing.  To my way of thinking, no-one should frown at <br/>
either, because as we know for different reasons not all women can <br/>
breast feed their infants.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>
&gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>
&gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>
&gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>
&gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>
&gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As you point out, a man doesn&#39;t have to be able to feed a baby to <br/>
bond with him/her, there are so many things that a Father can do <br/>
with/for his child that don&#39;t require him to be a pseudo Mother.  <br/>
Babies don&#39;t need two Mothers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109523035">Hello, one and all,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.  I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>
husband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).  Although you want this subject to be<br/>
closed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>
<br/>
As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>
from the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>
have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>
watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>
scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>
their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>
melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>
memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>
are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>
missed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>
drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>
and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>
and self-centred jock!<br/>
<br/>
I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>
the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>
some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>
can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>
pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>
bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>
rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>
<br/>
From a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>
that nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>
could ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>
baby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>
the same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>
the breast-feeding of our babies.  My father bottle-fed me, but he still<br/>
never learned to be sensitive or emotionally intimate with his children.<br/>
He simply FED me.  <br/>
<br/>
In summary, I cannot express adequately just how wonderful an experience<br/>
it has been for ME to be part of our breast-feeding team.  Like Sonia, I<br/>
understand that there are those 1-2% of cases where breast-feeding is<br/>
not possible for medical reasons. But I strongly encourage it for all<br/>
the other fathers, if it&#39;s at all an option for them......<br/>

&gt; My DH was the one that started this whole thing by being uncomfortable about<br/>
&gt; breastfeeding. We have talked about positives/negatives of it, and he knows<br/>
&gt; all the feelings expressed here. I truly feel that he would be more confused<br/>
&gt; by this than if he were to just walk in to my blatant disregard of his<br/>
&gt; feelings, and was nursing. I cannot speak for the reasons that my DH would<br/>
&gt; rather I not nurse, only that we have discussed it (in length) and that we<br/>
&gt; have agreed on expressing milk for the baby. Is that not the next best<br/>
&gt; thing? Not one person has even complemented him on that decision. I just<br/>
&gt; wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he may<br/>
&gt; have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire process<br/>
&gt; has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant without a<br/>
&gt; medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has been a<br/>
&gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>
&gt; feeding? I hope that since this is my DH we are speaking about, that this<br/>
&gt; would now go to the dead topic section, for it is a finished topic in our<br/>
&gt; home.<br/>
&gt; Thank you for all your opinions-<br/>
