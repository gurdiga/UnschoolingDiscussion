*****<br/>
I am editing an anthology about success for preteen and teen girls <br/>
that will be published in fall 2003 by Little, Brown. Would it be <br/>
possible for you to publicize a call for stories about success from <br/>
girls?<br/>
<br/>
The details for girls interested in submitting a story (or poem) are <br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.deebest.com/getpublished.html.">http://www.deebest.com/getpublished.html.</a> Info about the other <br/>
books in this series is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.deebest.com">http://www.deebest.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Please also feel free to forward this to anyone you know who might be <br/>
interested in contributing, or who might know interested girls. Thank <br/>
you very much!<br/>
