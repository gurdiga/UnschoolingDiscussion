<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795920584">Hi Everyone, <br/>
We&#39;ve been learning at home as a family now for going on two years <br/>
after pulling out of the public schools. I finally got around to <br/>
reading John Taylor Gatto&#39;s book &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot;. I wish I&#39;d done <br/>
it sooner when we were agonizing about what to do for our kids. He <br/>
lays out what we figured out after being subjected to the system for <br/>
a few years. Anyway, I know many people audit these groups to learn <br/>
more about homeschooling and unschooling in an attempt to figure out <br/>
if it is for them. Read this book if there is any doubt in your mind <br/>
that institutionalized schooling in America damages children, <br/>
families and ultimately our society. You can also check out Mr. <br/>
Gatto&#39;s web site at www.johntaylorgatto.com . I also strongly <br/>
recommend &quot;Family Matters: Why Homeschooling Makes Sense&quot; by David <br/>
Guterson as well as David and Micki Colfax&#39;s &quot;Homeschooling for <br/>
Excellence&quot;. Good Luck. Caroline<br/>
PS Perhaps Gatto&#39;s book would be a good one for someone&#39;s mother in <br/>
law!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617351276">Hi Caroline.  I just read his book this summer and thought it was great.  I even managed to get my hubby to read it.  He said he agreed with about 1/3 of it and I loved it!!!  <br/>
