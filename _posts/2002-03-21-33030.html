I am a Christian and I am on a few Christian Unschooling Lists and various other lists. I DO feel as though it is my responsibility to raise my children a certain way AND chastise them. Does that mean that I beat them (even lightly) with a dowel? NO NEVER. Does it mean I do not unschool? I dont think so. Does it mean I can be a unschooler as well as a Christian? I think they CAN mutually exsist. <br/>
So speaking as one of THEM, I feel as though your generalization is WAY off base. And really isnt that what all the fuss about to be or not be an unschooler was about? Maybe we should NOT make blanket statements about others that we have no REAL intimate knowledge of.<br/>
JUST MY NOT SO HUMBLE OPINION! :-)<br/>

<br/>
  Not involved enough, I think!<br/>
<br/>
  It was creepy to read that she had marked the Bible passages about her duty <br/>
  to discipline her children, or whatever.  That&#39;s big on some of the Christian <br/>
  homeschooling sites.  That God will punish parents who fail to chastise their <br/>
  children.  They justify spankings and (light) beatings (with dowels) by <br/>
  saying if they DON&#39;T do it they&#39;re not obeying God.<br/>

not come anywhere near describing me.  I guess &#39;Christian&#39; is not nearly<br/>
