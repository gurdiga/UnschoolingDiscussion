<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469361633">Help!  I&#39;m trying to get away from the birthday party bonanza.  We got<br/>
ANOTHER invitation today.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my take: we (American&#39;s) seem to have agreed that we will host a<br/>
party for our child&#39;s birthday and everyone will bring a (hopefully nice)<br/>
gift.  Then when it is another child&#39;s birthday, we give them a gift. <br/>
This struck me as so ridiculous at the last party I attended, when the<br/>
FOUR year old got a giant stack of gifts that he got tired of before they<br/>
were even all opened.  Although my children HAVE received some lovely<br/>
gifts, they&#39;ve also got junk that I couldn&#39;t wait until they tired of or<br/>
broke it.  (And I&#39;m probably guilty of giving junk just bc I didn&#39;t know<br/>
a child well enough to pick out something meaningful.)  I&#39;m so tired of<br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
Lisa, nearly 7, really is quite social and has tons of friends between<br/>
our neighborhood, homeschool group, and friends from my volunteer work. <br/>
She would love to have a party, of course.  I Do NOT want her to get a<br/>
giant pile of presents.  Her birthday is in December and it is just too<br/>
much stuff all at once!  I can&#39;t imagine her choosing just one friend to<br/>
have a special outing with either, she really doesn&#39;t have ONE best<br/>
friend at this time.<br/>
<br/>
How do I get off this merry go round?  Has anyone else said NO to all<br/>
those parties their kids get invited too?  Am I being unfair to her? <br/>
After all, she enjoys the parties!  I&#39;ve talked to her about not having a<br/>
party this year, but she still comes to with ideas about her party.  We<br/>
also discussed renting the skating rink and asking people to bring warm<br/>
clothing, like mittens or hats, to be donated to charity, instead of a<br/>
present for Lisa.  Has anyone tried anything like that?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids can choose - a really nice gift from mom and dad - OR a party with <br/>
friends.  Not both - to expensive.  They usually choose the one really nice <br/>
gift &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do a TON of birthday parties - we have packed days and weekends as <br/>
it is, so we pick and choose the ones that look &quot;low profile&quot;.  The ones at <br/>
skating rinks, or bowling alleys are good.  We ALWAYS give books as gifts <br/>
too.  And ALWAYS with a &quot;gift receipt&quot; so if the recipient has the book, they <br/>
can get a different one.  I have been known to do theme parties on occasion <br/>
(when a child gets that &quot;But SuzyJo had a party and it was SO FUN&quot;) idea and <br/>
chooses the party instead.  For these we request that the child bring <br/>
something homemade, a book, a whatever matches the &quot;theme&quot;.  Most parents are <br/>
thrilled to not have to THINK ABOUT what on earth to get yet another child <br/>
they don&#39;t know well for a gift.  Just a few ideas to throw out there for <br/>
you!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458201034">We don&#39;t do birthday parties with friends at all.  My reasons are the same<br/>
as yours.  It&#39;s just too much about the getting, not about anything<br/>
meaningful.  We usually just have cake and ice cream for our family, and the<br/>
presents we got for the child.<br/>
We also avoid the party scene.  There is one friends we go to.  She usually<br/>
just has my kids for her daughter, and  they have cake and just play.  They<br/>
also do it on the birthday, and in the morning just like a play date.  I<br/>
like that.  Very low key.<br/>
This same friend sent my son his present in the mail.  It was strictly<br/>
things she had made.  Pictures, and a pretty rock she had found, and one she<br/>
had painted.  I think it was the most wonderful present any of my kids have<br/>
ever received.<br/>
We also stay away from most holiday stuff for the same reasons.  Its just<br/>
overkill in my opinion.  We don&#39;t do Halloween.  (just decorate a pumpkin)<br/>
Luckily we live in the country, and don&#39;t have trick or treaters.<br/>
This is a hard battle in my life.  I grew up with all the privledges, and it<br/>
is a hard habit to break.<br/>
This brings to mind Christmas......  But thats another whole post....  :)<br/>
<br/>
I think if it were me, I just explain to friends that it is just too much,<br/>
thank you for the invite, and maybe your kids could send them a homemade<br/>
card if it was someone they feel specailly about.<br/>

those of us that have parties and those that don&#39;t.  My kids always <br/>
had parties when they were younger - although not real extravagant <br/>
ones.  We usually made favors,  sometimes did a craft project, etc.<br/>
My point is that our families live far away.  We can&#39;t have <br/>
grandparents or aunts and uncles at b-days.  Having a party is part <br/>
of what made their day special when they were younger.  As they got <br/>
older they chose to forego the parties or just have a couple of <br/>
friends spend the night or go to the movies.  Also,  my kids favorite <br/>
gifts from their parties have been very original ones.  For instance, <br/>
 when my son was about 8,  one of his friends brought him a pillow <br/>
his mom had made out of material that had all the NFL teams on it - <br/>
very inexpensive, and he still uses it.    I liked the idea of <br/>
bringing things for others - mittens, etc.  I do agree that the <br/>
parties can get out of hand.  We saw that happen when we lived in St. <br/>
Louis - ponies, etc. - things we couldn&#39;t afford.<br/>

I know how you feel and have asked the same questions.  However, this is my <br/>
conviction regarding my own daughter; they are her friends and it&#39;s her <br/>
social life so it has to be up to her.  I can discuss it with her but, like <br/>
her education, it&#39;s important not to push her into MY pov.  She loves the <br/>
parties and this year she wants one of her own, so we are doing what we can <br/>
to honor her desires.<br/>
<br/>
I know it gets tiresome attending those parties with them but it&#39;s one way we <br/>
can show respect for what matters to them.<br/>

My oldest is 10 yo this year and this was her last year to have a party.<br/>
Well at least until she is 12.  We started out in ps and got roped into the<br/>
every year party routine too.  But a couple years ago I gave her a choice -<br/>
you can either have a party with no more than X friends that lasts 2 hours<br/>
OR you can have 1-3 good friends spend the night with you.  Amazingly she<br/>
opted for the overnight and it has stuck.  Next year (11) we will plan a<br/>
family only event.  Then when she is 12 she can have another sleepover (her<br/>
favorite thing) and every other year after that until she is 16 then it is<br/>
family only in an attempt to break her into the idea that your birthday<br/>
involves friends and presents every year of your life!<br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough my 6 yo this year opted to just do the family thing on her<br/>
own!  The deal was you could have a party every year until you were 10 yo<br/>
then every other year after that to 16.  She was such a refreshing attitude<br/>
it blew us away.  So much so, we offered to ask one of her friends to spend<br/>
the night!  LOL!  Sometimes the problem is ME!<br/>

That is such an excellent idea. I bet the parents of the kids you invite<br/>
would just be thrilled with not having to worry about a &#39;gift&#39; and instead<br/>
be able to pick up a practical item they know someone will get much use out<br/>
of.  The kids will love it because kids love to do stuff like go skating<br/>
with all their friends (atleast I did when the youth group at church went<br/>
when I was a kid). You could also do food bank donations or anything like<br/>
that.  What a way to turn around the whole &#39;get&#39; mentality that comes with<br/>
the whole birthday party scene. You don&#39;t mind if I use this idea do you? I<br/>
wonder if it will work on the relatives.  My mil way over gifts my kids. Her<br/>
mother too, except she goes for quantity instead of quality. (I hope I don&#39;t<br/>
sound ungrateful, it just gets out of hand).<br/>

     My kids know that they don&#39;t get big birthday parties.  I have always <br/>
thought they were silly (maybe I am showing my old age, but everyone didn&#39;t <br/>
have these big birthday parties when I was a kid.  Normally, my friends and <br/>
myself, had one big party growing up and another around the age of 16.  Those <br/>
two parties meant alot to us, because we didn&#39;t have one every year), so we <br/>
just didn&#39;t have them.  My kids all knew that they would get one big party <br/>
during their childhood.  They don&#39;t even ask for them (they have all had that <br/>
one &quot;big&quot; party and it is something they all four talk about.  We video taped <br/>
each of their big birthday parties, so they can get them out and watch them <br/>
over and over---they love it!!<br/>
We also didn&#39;t do parties (like Chucky Cheese, McDonalds, or any other fancy <br/>
expensive place).  Instead I decorated the house, went to the library and got <br/>
books on birthday party games and made up our own, and left about an hour of <br/>
free time after games, opening presents and cakes.  The kids (most of who <br/>
always have the big theme birthday parties) all said that it was the best <br/>
birthday party they had ever been to!!!  I think that sometimes we give our <br/>
kids too much, and instead of them really liking it, they are overwhelmed!  <br/>
These kids all thought that this simple, inexpensive birthday party was the <br/>
best fun that they could remember, and that spoke volumes to me!!<br/>
     Anyway, we would still get invites to all the friends birthday parties <br/>
year after year.  Finally though, after years of not returning the favor and <br/>
inviting them to ours (because we didn&#39;t have them:)--oh well) they finally <br/>
quit asking my kids, so things have finally slowed down.  Of course, it is <br/>
easier since we homeschool, and don&#39;t have all those birthday parties from <br/>
the many friends in the classroom.:)<br/>
     My kids all enjoy the small birthday parties at home.  It is usually <br/>
just us, grandparents, and my brother and his wife and kids.  Sometimes, they <br/>
get to pick one kid to come also.  We let them know, that by saving the <br/>
expense of a big party, we can use all of their birthday money on a nicer <br/>
gift than we could have gotten otherwise.  My kids are very happy with this, <br/>
since as they got older, the gifts they want have gotten more expensive.:)  <br/>
Anyway, it works well with my kids.  I wish you alot of luck, as I struggled <br/>
through the same things before we decided to do things this way!<br/>

she has is, and offensive.  <br/>
<br/>
She goes so far with this that she specifically sends me a card and states <br/>
which mail provider she prefers I use.  It has never crossed her mind that I <br/>
have NEVER sent her kids a gift on holidays or birthdays.  I only do it off <br/>
holiday.  She doesn&#39;t get it.  When confronted she says &quot;What, what do you <br/>
mean?  These are the things that Sam wants...&quot;  Even when Sam was less than a <br/>
year old!  The first three years after she had her oldest, Ryan, she&#39;d go out <br/>
and buy what she wanted you to get the kid, then essentially bill you.  Send <br/>
you a note saying you&#39;ve given Ryan a $150 toy, I&#39;ll need to be reimbursed <br/>
before my rent is due.  If you were the recipient of this time saving effort <br/>
on your behalf, and didn&#39;t pay her back, she&#39;d call you on the phone.  When I <br/>
told her I wouldn&#39;t buy my kids a $150 toy for their birthday she&#39;d tell me <br/>
how she figured I could afford to spend this on her son.  She stopped that <br/>
when my mother told her to send the debt to a collection agency.<br/>

&gt; have NEVER sent her kids a gift on holidays or birthdays.  I only do it off<br/>
&gt; holiday.  She doesn&#39;t get it.  When confronted she says &quot;What, what do you<br/>
&gt; mean?  These are the things that Sam wants...&quot;  Even when Sam was less than a<br/>
&gt; year old!  The first three years after she had her oldest, Ryan, she&#39;d go out<br/>
&gt; and buy what she wanted you to get the kid, then essentially bill you.  Send<br/>
&gt; you a note saying you&#39;ve given Ryan a $150 toy, I&#39;ll need to be reimbursed<br/>
&gt; before my rent is due.  If you were the recipient of this time saving effort<br/>
&gt; on your behalf, and didn&#39;t pay her back, she&#39;d call you on the phone.  When I<br/>
&gt; told her I wouldn&#39;t buy my kids a $150 toy for their birthday she&#39;d tell me<br/>
&gt; how she figured I could afford to spend this on her son.  She stopped that<br/>
&gt; when my mother told her to send the debt to a collection agency.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084716765">In my opinion, it&#39;s the grandmothers who do WAY too much.  Until last year<br/>
the only ones at my (6yrold) son&#39;s birthday parties were cousins &<br/>
grandmothers....he was THRILLED when some of his new friends from a new<br/>
playgroup came to his party.  This year, he is very excited planning a theme<br/>
party, planning the activities they will do together.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter just turned 3, we had a fairy princess party (she chose) & all<br/>
her guests got to make magic wands & circlet crowns.  It was great fun.<br/>
Again, the only ones who went overboard were the grandmas.  They can&#39;t help<br/>
it & I can&#39;t find a way to ask....it would seem ungrateful.<br/>
<br/>
I like making a special day & event in honor of my kids....they are after<br/>
all special kids!!!!<br/>

What do you do for Christmas? We are right now trying to implement a new way <br/>
of doing Christmas. This is when our children look like they just bought Toys <br/>
R Us! We decided that since Christ was given 3 gifts, we will give 3 gifts, <br/>
and then we will focus on clothing and needed items. In stockings my children <br/>
are always blessed with undergarments, pencils, and other little goodies. I <br/>
think that this year we are going to tone down the big toy hype and focus on <br/>
family and Christ. We have also decided that instead of shopping for high <br/>
priced gifts for family and friends, we will make bread, soup mixes, cookies, <br/>
and hot chocolate<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339841991">This became a tough issue for me after having three children.  We have a <br/>
large circle of hsing friends, so we would have a party and the whole family <br/>
would have to be invited (because they were too young to be at a drop off <br/>
party).  So if I have 3 kids and our close circle of say six families has 3 <br/>
children (just a for instance) that comes to 18 parties a year not including <br/>
our own childrens.  We had to put a stop to going to most of the parties.  My <br/>
friends know how I feel about it.  My sons were too young so we never had <br/>
friend parties for them. Always at home with just us and grandparents.  When <br/>
they reach a certain age then they are allowed to pick a place to go like <br/>
amusement park. We have a local one which is very inexpensive, free <br/>
admission, and all day ticket passes are $10 each.  My dd does likes to have <br/>
parties with her friends, being more social than the boys. Next year I think <br/>
we may have a sleep over with one special friend.  I really hate to deny my <br/>
kids the fun of having a big party, and if I only had one child I probably <br/>
would go ahead and have parties most years.  Even when we did them for my dd, <br/>
we still didn&#39;t go crazy and spend lots of money on activities, just allowed <br/>
them to play.  Oh and one more side note, when we have just the family <br/>
parties, the kids each get a party bag filled with little cheapo toys like <br/>
chalk, bubbles etc.  We decorate with balloons, bake and decorate the cake, <br/>
wrap presents.  Last year my dd specifically wanted a Bitty Baby and we <br/>
picked her out and her accessories.  This is all she got (oh yeah plus some <br/>
glitter glue I had promised her) for her bday.  While it wasnt&#39; an <br/>
inexpensive gift, it was simple.  It also happens to be her most played with <br/>
toy which she takes everywhere including to bed.  <br/>

&gt;I read this and finally realized what the difference might be between <br/>
&gt;those of us that have parties and those that don&#39;t.  My kids always <br/>
&gt;had parties when they were younger - although not real extravagant <br/>
&gt;ones.  We usually made favors,  sometimes did a craft project, etc.<br/>
&gt;My point is that our families live far away.  We can&#39;t have <br/>
&gt;grandparents or aunts and uncles at b-days.  Having a party is part <br/>
&gt;of what made their day special when they were younger.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right!  I&#39;d never thought of that - we lived in Detroit when my kids<br/>
started this birthday party stuff and their grandparents were 4 hours and<br/>
10 hours away!  No cousins lived nearby either!  Hmmm, always wondered how<br/>
I let that happen.  :o)<br/>

&lt;&lt; We<br/>
 also discussed renting the skating rink and asking people to bring warm<br/>
 clothing, like mittens or hats, to be donated to charity, instead of a<br/>
 present for Lisa.  Has anyone tried anything like that? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I&#39;m so late to this, but I&#39;m behind on my mail as usual!  My friend and <br/>
I started a new gift custom with our kids last year because we both got tired <br/>
of this same dilemna. This is what we do.  We ask each child/family to bring <br/>
an item or two for the local food bank and then after the party, we bag up <br/>
the stuff and the kids bring it in.  Then, so the kids don&#39;t get left out all <br/>
together, we ask each family to bring one grab bag type present (wrapped) <br/>
under $5 in value.  Then we play a game where the kids have to answer <br/>
questions (usually silly ones) and the first one to get a question right goes <br/>
to the pile of gag gifts and picks one out.  The fun part comes in when the <br/>
others get to pick, because they can either take from the people who have <br/>
already chosen or from the pile.  Then, when everybody has a gift, they all <br/>
open them one at a time and show them off.  Lots of times they are comical or <br/>
really simple.<br/>
 This probably doesn&#39;t work with really young kids who get attached to <br/>
things, and may not want to give up their box.  You could probably adapt it <br/>
for this age. We&#39;ve tried it with age 6 and up with great success.  It&#39;s <br/>
really been surprising...we find that the kids are often more interested in <br/>
the game and oohing and ahhing over what other people have unwrapped that <br/>
they don&#39;t seem as greedy.  <br/>
We thought about going cold turkey to no gifts, but ended up thinking that <br/>
this would be a better way to &quot;ease&quot; them off.  Then, when the kids get to be <br/>
12+, we just take them places with their friends and still do the canned <br/>
goods, but we forgo the gifts and the kids seem fine with this.  We do <br/>
usually still do some kind of goody grab bag for everybody, but we try to <br/>
make it practical.<br/>
This is one idea.  BTW, it really helps if you can get a few of the other <br/>
parents to go in with you on this idea!   You might be surprised how many <br/>
people are lurking out there who also want to get &quot;off the bandwagon.&quot;<br/>

We have done this for several years, Stephanie, and it works well for us.  <br/>
The kids do seem to get many gifts from other sources on top of these, but we <br/>
keep the family gifts very simple.  We even break it down further: the kids <br/>
each get one book or game; one toy( or similar item for the older kids...last <br/>
year my 12yog got a camera, for example); and one article of clothing(this <br/>
tends to be something a little special like a sweater I know they like, but <br/>
is too expensive for the ordinary budget!<br/>
I was glad to hear that someone else does the three gifts, too!<br/>

Tim has gone to a reasonable number of birthday parties.  He&#39;s only ever had<br/>
1 in his life, and that&#39;s because I planned it as a surprise.  Every other<br/>
year we give him the choice of a party or a day trip with one other friend.<br/>
Tim doesn&#39;t generally like big groups of kids, so he&#39;s always chosen the day<br/>
trip, and usually somewhere like a big ammusement park or something.  Since<br/>
he&#39;s an only child, it&#39;s more fun for him with a friend anyhow.  We always<br/>
have cake with family and sometimes another family we all like might come,<br/>
too.  But it&#39;s informal.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody&#39;s ever acted like it was a problem that we didn&#39;t invite them all to<br/>
a party.  <br/>
