<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767706210">Tonight is lovely.  I got home from work and was met by a very excited Bekka.  She had called me at work earlier in the day because she wanted to know the recipe for Play Dough...  I told her I couldn&#39;t look it up right then, but after I got home I would look it up and we&#39;d make some.  I told her I was pretty sure that it took flour, salt, and kool-aid (she wanted fruity playdough), and that if she wanted she could get it out and be ready. <br/>
 <br/>
Well, when I got home she had cleared off a spot on the counter, gotten a glass bowl from the sink and washed it, had the flour, salt, kool-aid, and measuring cups/spoons ready.  Mom was on the computer and quite grouchy, so I said &quot;How about we go look at these catalogs while grandma finishes what she&#39;s doing.  After she&#39;s off the computer, then we&#39;ll look up the recipe.&quot;  Bekka said that was fine, as she&#39;s been wanting to go through the catalogs and pick the things she wants to sell. (she&#39;s my budding entreprenuer... lol - we started an LLC for her, and we are in the process of SLOWLY getting a website up and running)  <br/>
 <br/>
ANYWAY... we did that for a while, then my mom got off the puter.  I looked up a recipe, and we got to work.  She measured and stirred while I helped out.  Then she kneaded it to just the right consistency - without me saying or doing anything.  She proceeded to make &quot;CandyLand&quot; stories with the dough - shaping mountains, caves, rivers, and even freaky faces, etc...  We had a blast.  Then she would make animal prints in the dough and have me guess what they were.  My favorite was the carmel marshmellow bear with sprinkles... lol.<br/>
 <br/>
After that, we went to the library.  I had some things to look up, and she skipped off to the kids section of the library.  45 minutes later I get a whispered &quot;mom...&quot; and slight tap on my shoulder - I nearly yelped.  lol... anyway, she had a stack of books and videos that was half as high as she is tall.  She apparently has a thing for bears, since she has gotten 4 books on them, 2 on butterflies (which is because she and her buddy found a cocoon the other day - I remember hearing her tell her friend &quot;That&#39;s called a crysalis &lt;sp?&gt; and I can&#39;t remember where she&#39;d hear that - lol, and THEY say she doesn&#39;t know anything cuz she&#39;s not in school...), she also got a couple of the olsen twins books, a bunch of space and moon books, some mystery books, and some other books on various subjects.  <br/>
 <br/>
Bekka also picked out some videos.  I was surprised that she had picked out a Hamtaro video.  It&#39;s something we had come across a long time ago, and is not easily found in the library.  I think it&#39;s a Japanese animation hamster thing.  I don&#39;t get it really, but she loves it.  She also picked some Spongebob videos.  She had never seen spongebob before, but this past weekend we were visiting a friend that has cable and she really likes the show.  Another one I don&#39;t get/care for... but she&#39;s loving it. I think she got some other ones too, but I can&#39;t remember. <br/>
 <br/>
After we got home, she ran to the shower - something I used have to ask her to do (okay, beg/plead/pester is more likely an accurate description).  I warmed up taco fixings from the other night and put away the dishes I had washed while we had chatted over play dough earlier.  She was out of the shower in record time - and dressed to boot.  She made her tacos exactly as she wanted, and even tried tomatoes (something she has insisted as far back as i can remember that she hated... lol) without me saying &quot;hey, why don&#39;t you try some... pleasseee... just some... just a bite...just a little... just once... it won&#39;t kill you to try it... blah blah blah&quot; (I hate that old me... I have been trying very hard lately to watch what I say - especially regarding food).  She said &quot;Hey, I kind of like these, but not really.&quot;  I said, &quot;That&#39;s fine honey.  Everyone has different tastes.&quot;  if the dear never eats tomatoes, it won&#39;t be the end of the world (and that leaves more for me &lt;bwg&gt;)  <br/>
 <br/>
While eating dinner, we watched Hamtaro and played more play dough, and after that she watched a Spongebob video.  And the whole time that I have been typing this, she has not once &quot;bugged&quot; me.  Okay, there was the one time she said &quot;Mommy, I &#39;m thirsty.&quot;  I (happily!!! and I mean that I felt very happy while doing so) made her warm milk and cinnamon - one of her absolute favorites.  She said thank you.<br/>
 <br/>
Ahhhh... what a lovely lovely evening.    <br/>

&lt;&lt;  I remember hearing her tell her friend &quot;That&#39;s called a crysalis &lt;sp?&gt; <br/>
and I can&#39;t remember where she&#39;d hear that - lol, and THEY say she doesn&#39;t know <br/>
anything cuz she&#39;s not in school...) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love when that happens.<br/>
<br/>
Today Holly was sitting reading &quot;The Body&quot; by Stephen King. <br/>
That&#39;s her next step from Judy Blume. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She was telling me something about the story being in a lull.  I asked her a <br/>
question and I don&#39;t remember what, but she said, &quot;It&#39;s just character <br/>
development at this point.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
Then Marty was telling me all about The Tempest, and why characters did what <br/>
(it&#39;s been a long time since I read it, and I&#39;ve never seen it, but thanks to <br/>
the Ohman family, he saw it a couple of weeks ago).  I found an illustrated <br/>
retelling of it, with lots of full-page illustrations and he went through it <br/>
telling me his favorite bits, and about how it was staged when he saw it.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m a little worried about Kirby&#39;s response to algebra (unthrilled), I <br/>
have no worries about their access to literature. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713236144">Oh, yes, warm milk with cinnamon, honey and butter is a favorite in <br/>
our house, too!  My mom used to make it over toast, but I don&#39;t like <br/>
soggy toast and none of my girls do either...actually, they do like <br/>
to dip their toast in the milk.  Anyhoo, so glad to hear of your <br/>
lovely evening with Bekka, complete with yummy warm milk.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
