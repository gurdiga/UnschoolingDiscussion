<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190160037">Steve and I have taken the same food attitude as we do to the tv.  We have<br/>
worked on not making food a big issue.  It&#39;s been much harder for me because<br/>
of my own food issues to work with this one.  The kids seem to eat plenty of<br/>
healthy foods and also some snack foods.  I don&#39;t want things to be off<br/>
limits otherwise I might set up a food addiction in them (and that&#39;s a fear<br/>
of mine).  Same with TV... we didn&#39;t make a big deal over TV and they watch<br/>
it sometimes for hours at a time and then they&#39;ll go days without watching<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on letting go of everything and anything with my kids and see if<br/>
this unschooling stuff works.<br/>

layered process for me. The minute I think I &quot;got it&quot; about one aspect<br/>
of our lives, then it pops up in some other way and I have to stop and<br/>
question my &quot;automatic&quot; responses, judgments, etc.. It really is a<br/>

<br/>
Yes,  this is so fascinating to me also.   That pretty much describes our journey too.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the movie Shrek  and his onion analogy.  <br/>
<br/>
I think someone else has made this comparison also, but can&#39;t remember if it was on this list or not.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 I feel like our layers are layers that have been heaped onto ourselves from years and years of nodding our heads and going along with what was &#39;good&#39;.     Making kids do things, eating certain things and behaving a certain way.    Alot of main stream thinking.      <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are now peeling away those layers!  Our unschooling life began in homeschooling (the first layer) and continuued its way into our lives. (the next layers)  It led me into reevaluating so many more avenues than I would have ever expected.    It goes to prove that you can&#39;t just say that unschooling is an education or such,  its a  way of life.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would love to go into this more but I am out of town right now and my computer usage is somewhat limited!   &lt;g&gt;     <br/>
