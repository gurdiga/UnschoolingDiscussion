&gt; Unfortunately, while I REALLY don&#39;t mind children&#39;s art on the walls, or ON<br/>
&gt; the walls themselves, Paul does. But I talked to him about it and he says<br/>
&gt; he doesn&#39;t care as long as 1) it&#39;s washable marker/crayon and 2) I<br/>
&gt; personally do the scrubbing before any inspection. He says it looks<br/>
&gt; awful...but all I see is budding talent and personality (the culprit being<br/>
&gt; my two year old free-spirit Megan).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What kind of inspection? Like the local police graffiti force, or ???<br/>
<br/>
From experience with the artistic temperament, I will offer a warning that<br/>
your two year old is highly likely to object to you assaulting and<br/>
destroying her Work with 409 before your husband gets home or your neighbors<br/>
come over or whatever the &quot;inspection&quot; time is. If you can&#39;t convince Paul<br/>
to let her have a perpetual wall where SHE decides when it gets cleaned off<br/>
and if, you might find she&#39;s much happier with large pieces of paper tacked<br/>
to the wall that she can draw on and then keep when they need taking down.<br/>

That&#39;s so cool! Last week we visited my cousin and her family. They have<br/>
painted their living room, and girl&#39;s bedrooms with milk paint, using<br/>
natural pigments. Ella&#39;s room was called italian earth and was an<br/>
orange/terracotta colour. You just paint it on in every direction and get<br/>
different shades happening like when you rag roll. And because you are<br/>
making it from milk (powdered) it&#39;s not expensive and you can repaint every<br/>
couple of years.<br/>
We are going to try it when we are ready to paint Mia&#39;s room.<br/>

There are lots of different recipes available . You can buy it ready made,<br/>
just add water. The most common recipe is made from milk protein, lime and<br/>
earth pigments.<br/>
The place where we can buy the pigments from has recipes and all that we<br/>
need to get started.<br/>
 Here&#39;s a site to check out.<br/>

<br/>
Adriane re-did her room last year.  She painted the walls a robin-egg blue<br/>
and hung bathroom rugs that look like organge or purple or blue flowers on<br/>
the wall.  She made very sheer curtains that are metallic green with a blue<br/>
sheen that matches the walls, and hung sun-catching crystals all in her bay<br/>
window.  The neatest thing she did was take her clothes out of her closet,<br/>
build in a desk and make herself an office.  She took off the closet door<br/>
and hung love-beads.<br/>
