<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426020119">Good Morning,<br/>
Here&#39;s a link that may or may not be of some help.<br/>
<br/>
The following link was forwarded to you by a visitor to About,<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.about.com">http://home.about.com</a><br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My immediate reaction to Paula&#39;s post was as you read. It struck me as very<br/>
dismissive.<br/>
If my gut reaction was wrong (and I do usually follow my gut) - that my<br/>
apologies.<br/>
<br/>
As for these wonderful cows that are free range roaming - great. Sadly most<br/>
of our dairy products do not come from those cows.  However, be that as it<br/>
may, a discussion about whether or not dairy could be causing skin problems<br/>
is pretty much beat to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
While I had very few problems w/ my skin, others in my family did.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the things we used.<br/>
<br/>
Witch Hazel as an astringent.<br/>
<br/>
Once in a while we use apple cider vinegar as an astringent.<br/>
<br/>
We wash w/ oatmeal - Quaker Oats.<br/>
<br/>
Basis superfatted soap is very good<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like, I can post more natural, inexpensive tips.<br/>
<br/>
I really wish our kids didn&#39;t have skin problems.  I fear Brianna will have<br/>
skin problems; her mom did.<br/>
I know that stress is a big factor.<br/>
