<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387082988">Last month I asked if anyone had any experience with the mandatory <br/>
report card check for Pop Warner football.  Here in S. CA they <br/>
require it.  Everyone was surprised that I didn&#39;t have to do report <br/>
cards or test.  Anyways, they asked for a copy of my r-4 affidavit <br/>
and a letter stating we don&#39;t do report cards.  I gave them this and <br/>
then they came back with a paper they wanted me to sign that was <br/>
meant for a principal to sign for a student in &quot;regular school&quot; that <br/>
stated the student was not earning a 70% in school, but they thought <br/>
it would be good for the student to participate.  I signed, but noted <br/>
that my kids do not get grades and have scored quite high on the Iowa <br/>
State test. This was taken a couple of years ago through my original <br/>
affiliatilon with homeschooling.  It sort of ticked me off, but <br/>
sometimes you just do what you need to do to get what you want from <br/>
the system.<br/>
<br/>
My 15 year old son told me today that he didn&#39;t want anyone in Civil <br/>
Air Patrol to know that we don&#39;t do grades and all the jazz.  He is <br/>
concerned that they may not allow him to continue with CAP.  I told <br/>
him they would be crazy not to.  Not to brag, but pleeeeeeaaaaase let <br/>
me!  He knows all the questions they ask the group regarding what <br/>
they were supposed to study and sometimes does not hold up his hand  <br/>
for fear of looking like a know-it-all.  He even knew an answer they <br/>
asked that wasn&#39;t in their curriculum about Chinese gun powder or <br/>
explosives or something like that because he always watches the <br/>
History Channel.  But then again, he has the time.  Most of the kids <br/>
are in summer school, what a drag for those kids! O.K., I&#39;m through. <br/>
<br/>
My oldsest daughter is thinking about going back to ps and I don&#39;t <br/>
want to think of the run-around they are going to give me about that <br/>
hepatitis shot all the kids are supposed to have.  If she does decide <br/>
to go back, I&#39;ll just make up a course of study and report cards I <br/>
guess to shut them up.  I hate to lie, but they don&#39;t make it easy.<br/>

Can you do a report card on the &quot;Excellent / Satisfactory / Needs <br/>
Improvement&quot; model instead of grades?   If I made a report card I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
feel too bad.  I&#39;ve made report cards in school and whole letter grades come <br/>
and go on a subjective basis sometimes.  It&#39;s supposed to be straight from <br/>
the grade books (legal record and all that), but a grade will be raised for <br/>
special effort, or lowered for lack of attendance or lack of participation.  <br/>
It&#39;s hardly mathematical, those numbers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I found myself making up a report card I would add stuff the school didn&#39;t <br/>
have.  Interpersonal skills (in a real way, not as &quot;conduct&quot;) and &quot;music <br/>
history&quot; and &quot;history of science&quot; and &quot;practical sciences&quot; and <br/>
&quot;problem-solving&quot; and &quot;found history / artifacts&quot;... it could be fun!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Those are good ideas.  I keep telling myself that as long as <br/>
their &quot;offered&quot;, they can be &quot;taught&quot; any way I feel is best.  <br/>
<br/>
I know what I really need to do is get a journal going on daily <br/>
activities, so they can all be catergorized, which would make it much <br/>
easier.<br/>

In CA all you have to do is turn over the immunization form and sign the<br/>
back of it saying you don&#39;t believe in the shots.  It is NOT a problem.<br/>
<br/>
As to Pop Warner, either it is a new thing or it is a southern Cal thing<br/>
because Pop Warner has never required it up here in No. Cal.  Or at least<br/>
hadn&#39;t up till two years ago (we are between ages right now with kidlets).<br/>
<br/>
As to report cards, whenever most folks ask for them and don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the<br/>
whole unschooling thing, we use to make one up using a letterhead we had<br/>
made up for our &quot;school&quot; when we were asked for something inorder to get a<br/>
discount at a store.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332968452">Why are any of the shots mandatory?<br/>
Money.  The truth is that if the vaccines work as they say they do, an <br/>
unvaccinated child is the one at risk, rather than posing a threat.<br/>
There are now chicken pox vaccines, I wonder when they&#39;ll be mandatory?<br/>
I&#39;ve also heard all kinds of scary research and experiments on newer <br/>
vaccines, like giving 11 or 12 year old girls vaccines for cervical cancer. <br/>
Which of course poses the threat of them actually contracting cancer.<br/>

The doctor told me the only way that particular strand of Hepatitis <br/>
can invade you system is through:  interveinous drug use, sex, blood <br/>
transfussion and of course stepping on that dirty hypodermic needle <br/>
at the beach! This may sound naive, but my kids are not having sex or <br/>
shooting up.  I guess we&#39;ll have to take our chances on the blood <br/>
transfusion and stepping on a dirty needle thing.  <br/>
<br/>
At the doctor today they wanted to give my son a booster Tetnus shot, <br/>
but didn&#39;t have any on hand, so it saved me a confrontation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255483175">At our local elementary school they have a sign posted that gives you <br/>
the feeling that if you do not have all your immunizations your child <br/>
will not be admitted, but I do know better. Once, many years ago, I <br/>
was enrolling my oldest daughter in Kindergarten and had to get the <br/>
T.B. test out of the way.  I told the office administrator that it <br/>
was weird how I couldn&#39;t get her into school without it, but it was <br/>
o.k. for her to go even though she had AIDS, which she didn&#39;t, but I <br/>
was trying to make a point.  T.B. is curable, right?  AIDS is not. <br/>
Now, I know all it takes is a cough with T.B., but what if someone <br/>
cut themselves, or a small child didn&#39;t know about it and wanted to <br/>
become &quot;blood brothers or sisters&quot;, which one of my daughters friends <br/>
wanted her to do many years ago, but thankfully she knew better! <br/>
<br/>
An unrelated story, but good for this unschooling website, <br/>
nonetheless, this same friend of hers has always been homeschooled, <br/>
she is a bit slow because of eye problems and is about 2 1/2 years <br/>
older than my daughter.   We slowly became unschoolers, and when she <br/>
kept asking my daughter what she was doing as faw as school work, my <br/>
daughter told her the truth, and mentioned &quot;unschooling&quot;.  She then <br/>
told my daughter &quot;How are you going to get a job someday!&quot;  She came <br/>
home and told me and we cracked up!!  Maybe you would just have to <br/>
know her friend to see the funny part about this. I talk to my kids <br/>
about everything under the sun, we converse, I suppose more than most <br/>
mom/kid relationships.  My goodnes, even five years ago, you would <br/>
think all eleven or twelve year olds would know about AIDS!<br/>

Where in So. Cal. do you live?  I&#39;m in North San Diego County in a <br/>
small city called Vista.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the group. I have two boys, David 10 and Matthew 5, and <br/>
am at heart an unschooler. Alas, I have an ex-husband who is ps all <br/>
the way! So, I enrolled them in our school district ISP in hopes that <br/>
it will fly with the court and him...right now he&#39;s giving me a <br/>
hassle. The program starts in September, so I&#39;m unschooling now, but <br/>
when it starts I&#39;ll be dealing with a lot of the ps crap that I&#39;m <br/>
trying to get away from...But, I figure, it is better than ps.<br/>
I&#39;ll just have to fit my way into their way...<br/>

Have you considered a charter school?  They are much more relaxed than a ps<br/>
ISP.  Less paperwork, less rules, more hsing friendly.  AND, legally it is a<br/>
public school!<br/>

&gt; Where in So. Cal. do you live?  I&#39;m in North San Diego County in a<br/>
&gt; small city called Vista.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new to the group. I have two boys, David 10 and Matthew 5, and<br/>
&gt; am at heart an unschooler. Alas, I have an ex-husband who is ps all<br/>
&gt; the way! So, I enrolled them in our school district ISP in hopes that<br/>
&gt; it will fly with the court and him...right now he&#39;s giving me a<br/>
&gt; hassle. The program starts in September, so I&#39;m unschooling now, but<br/>
&gt; when it starts I&#39;ll be dealing with a lot of the ps crap that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; trying to get away from...But, I figure, it is better than ps.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll just have to fit my way into their way...<br/>

&gt; &gt; In CA all you have to do is turn over the immunization form and<br/>
&gt; sign the<br/>
&gt; &gt; back of it saying you don&#39;t believe in the shots.  It is NOT a<br/>
&gt; problem.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As to Pop Warner, either it is a new thing or it is a southern Cal<br/>
&gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; because Pop Warner has never required it up here in No. Cal.  Or at<br/>
&gt; least<br/>
&gt; &gt; hadn&#39;t up till two years ago (we are between ages right now with<br/>
&gt; kidlets).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As to report cards, whenever most folks ask for them and<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; whole unschooling thing, we use to make one up using a letterhead<br/>
&gt; we had<br/>
&gt; &gt; made up for our &quot;school&quot; when we were asked for something inorder<br/>
&gt; to get a<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Last month I asked if anyone had any experience with the mandatory<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; report card check for Pop Warner football.  Here in S. CA they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; require it.  Everyone was surprised that I didn&#39;t have to do<br/>
&gt; report<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cards or test.  Anyways, they asked for a copy of my r-4 affidavit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and a letter stating we don&#39;t do report cards.  I gave them this<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then they came back with a paper they wanted me to sign that was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; meant for a principal to sign for a student in &quot;regular school&quot;<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stated the student was not earning a 70% in school, but they<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it would be good for the student to participate.  I signed, but<br/>
&gt; noted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that my kids do not get grades and have scored quite high on the<br/>
&gt; Iowa<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; State test. This was taken a couple of years ago through my<br/>
&gt; original<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; affiliatilon with homeschooling.  It sort of ticked me off, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes you just do what you need to do to get what you want<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the system.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My 15 year old son told me today that he didn&#39;t want anyone in<br/>
&gt; Civil<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Air Patrol to know that we don&#39;t do grades and all the jazz.  He<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned that they may not allow him to continue with CAP.  I<br/>
&gt; told<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him they would be crazy not to.  Not to brag, but pleeeeeeaaaaase<br/>
&gt; let<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me!  He knows all the questions they ask the group regarding what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they were supposed to study and sometimes does not hold up his<br/>
&gt; hand<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for fear of looking like a know-it-all.  He even knew an answer<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; asked that wasn&#39;t in their curriculum about Chinese gun powder or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; explosives or something like that because he always watches the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; History Channel.  But then again, he has the time.  Most of the<br/>
&gt; kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are in summer school, what a drag for those kids! O.K., I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; through.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My oldsest daughter is thinking about going back to ps and I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; want to think of the run-around they are going to give me about<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hepatitis shot all the kids are supposed to have.  If she does<br/>
&gt; decide<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to go back, I&#39;ll just make up a course of study and report cards I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guess to shut them up.  I hate to lie, but they don&#39;t make it<br/>

Money. The truth is that if the vaccines work as they <br/>
say they do, an <br/>
unvaccinated child is the one at risk, rather than <br/>
posing a threat.<br/>
There are now chicken pox vaccines, I wonder when <br/>
they&#39;ll be mandatory?<br/>

They seem to be mandatory in Virginia, and as an <br/>

my kids caught chickenpox when they were little, as <br/>
does every child in Britian. Most parents consider it <br/>
no more inconvenient than a cold. The drug companies <br/>

Fortunately it hasn&#39;t been taken up cos the government <br/>
considers it too expensive but I bet it wont be long.<br/>
