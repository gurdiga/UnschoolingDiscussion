<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416628187">Hi Mary,<br/>
<br/>
We have only been doing effexor for four months. Have seen good results. Not completely gone but she says the world doesn&#39;t seem to be coming so fast at her. We never had the learning problems other than high distraction and the classroom sounded like a loud echoing place always for her. She would come home from school and cry for 1-2 hours just screaming and biting and hitting.I was always told I was to soft and needed to be firmer etc...<br/>
<br/>
I have never heard of sensory integration. I can&#39;t believe the differences in Canadian(northern) health care and US health care. I will be looking for info on this now for sure.<br/>
One thing about this personality was it sure made me explore parenting,my own issues, marriage and listening to each individual.<br/>

People have all sorts of advice, don&#39;t they. :-P~~~~~ Conor once told <br/>
me that the classroom felt like a war going on, only no one would <br/>
come  help him. &lt;ouch&gt; Glad I rescued him when I did even though I <br/>
wish he had never gone at all. How long was your daughter in school? <br/>
How long has she been out?<br/>

I definitely feel blessed by each my kid&#39;s &quot;quirks.&quot; They have <br/>

Life is good.<br/>

   How long was your daughter in school? <br/>
  How long has she been out?<br/>
  She was in kindergarten,then I curriculum homeschooled her for grade 1. Lots of damage done there for her and I.Then in grade 2-41/2 in montessori. She has been out for 5 years.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Thanks, I will.<br/>
<br/>
  I definitely feel blessed by each my kid&#39;s &quot;quirks.&quot; They have <br/>
  brought me to a place I may never have found otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
  Isn&#39;t that the truth. Can&#39;t imagine life without this journey. I was very compliant and mainstream until I had kids. <br/>
  I actually consider myself lucky that they found me to guide me in my journey or maybe we found each other.<br/>
