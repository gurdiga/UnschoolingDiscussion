<br/>
Sometimes, gentle and firm disciplining of your child can seem impossible. But listening to your heart and the experience of parents you admire can help you provide the loving guidance that makes all the difference in the world.<br/>

Compassionate Connection: Nonviolent Communication with Children<br/>
<br/>
When our baby was a week old, his grandfather expressed concern that my partner and I were holding him too much. Since then, Grandpa has worried about cosleeping and extended nursing, and we have continued to talk together about the differences in our parenting philosophies. At one point Grandpa tried to harmonize our obviously different approaches: &quot;Surely we all want the same thing,&quot; he said. &quot;We want our children to grow up to become independent.&quot;<br/>

Parental Anger: Mindfulness and Letting Go<br/>
<br/>
As a facilitator of parenting workshops, I work with parents on understanding their emotional reactions to their children. Without question, the issue that is raised more than any other is parental anger. One day, listening to a woman talk about how angry she gets with her children, a light bulb clicked on in my head: I realized that the best way to understand the anger in our society is to understand the anger inside of us. The best way to teach our children is to be role models, by looking at and understanding our own anger.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125739246">Wow Judy,  I have never read Mothering Mag,  there are a lot of powerful articles just in that issue.  Can you tell me more about the magazine itself what kind-of background does it have?  I have to send this article to many of my friends, have lots of friends dealing with little boys who are having really hard times dealing with anger.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474188542">oh, what you have been missing!<br/>
It is a fabulous, fabulous publication. Peggy O&#39;Mara is a woman who has <br/>
facilitated many paradigm shifts for our children. and a great speaker! <br/>
if you ever have the chance to see her- DO!<br/>
<br/>
and shoot- I just gave years and years and years worth of back issues <br/>
away ( to my local OB Clinic- &#39;strewing&#39; on a community level ;-)<br/>
 (Am I the oldest parent here?- I have an almost 27 yo...)<br/>

*DO* get yourself a subscription, Kelli.<br/>

Sadly, Catherine Young past away last year ( on Sept 11th- I like to <br/>
think that she was needed to be a &#39;Compleat Mother&#39; to all the people <br/>
who were murdered that day...) but her magazine goes on as wonderful as <br/>
ever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873148711">Oh,  why couldn&#39;t I have had a mother like you?  I do love my mother and everything but I just wonder what I would be like now if I would have had one that accepted me for me.<br/>
Unfortunately, she is older than you and didn&#39;t know these things.<br/>
Also, I wish I would have found a Le Leche group, because I was unable to nurse any of mine and I still have dreams of doing that, sad huh?  Oh well, I can still be a good parent now!<br/>
Do you think I would still like Mothering, even tho&#39; I&#39;m past the birthing part of my life?<br/>
It has alot of parenting things also, right?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello everyone! Here&#39;s what&#39;s new this week at Mothering.com&<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes, gentle and firm disciplining of your child can seem<br/>
&gt; &gt; impossible. But listening to your heart and the experience of parents<br/>
&gt; &gt; you admire can help you provide the loving guidance that makes all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; difference in the world.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Compassionate Connection: Nonviolent Communication with Children<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When our baby was a week old, his grandfather expressed concern that<br/>
&gt; &gt; my partner and I were holding him too much. Since then, Grandpa has<br/>
&gt; &gt; worried about cosleeping and extended nursing, and we have continued<br/>
&gt; &gt; to talk together about the differences in our parenting philosophies.<br/>
&gt; &gt; At one point Grandpa tried to harmonize our obviously different<br/>
&gt; &gt; approaches: &quot;Surely we all want the same thing,&quot; he said. &quot;We want our<br/>
&gt; &gt; children to grow up to become independent.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Parental Anger: Mindfulness and Letting Go<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a facilitator of parenting workshops, I work with parents on<br/>
&gt; &gt; understanding their emotional reactions to their children. Without<br/>
&gt; &gt; question, the issue that is raised more than any other is parental<br/>
&gt; &gt; anger. One day, listening to a woman talk about how angry she gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; with her children, a light bulb clicked on in my head: I realized that<br/>
&gt; &gt; the best way to understand the anger in our society is to understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; the anger inside of us. The best way to teach our children is to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; role models, by looking at and understanding our own anger.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954051601">Be careful what you say if you go to their meetings! I formula-fed both my boys because I had to work full time. When I had my third baby, I had been staying home for over 4 years, so I wanted to breastfeed her. I went to a meeting.... they asked about how I&#39;d fed the boys, and I told them. The rest of the meeting was spent with them attacking my choices and telling me what a bad mom I was. Absolutely no support for me wanting to breastfeed now, no help or advice, nothing. Just criticism for past choices. I was almost in tears by the time I left.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m SO sorry that you had that kind of an experience at a LLL meeting!  How <br/>
awful that must have felt!  Having been a LLL leader, it saddens me to hear <br/>
that you did not feel any support at the meeting you attended, a meeting <br/>
where the primary purpose is to offer support and encouragement to ALL moms <br/>
who wish to breastfeed their babies.  I can certainly understand why you <br/>
would have been brought to near tears after feeling attacked.  I think I <br/>
would have felt that way, too!  No mom should have to defend her choices to <br/>
ANYONE, certainly not people she is going to for HELP!<br/>
<br/>
But, I do want to say that LLL&#39;s policy is offer support through <br/>
encouragement, not attacking moms choices!  I pray and I believe that your <br/>
experience is not the typical experience a mom would have who had formerly <br/>
bottle-fed and wanted now to breastfeed.  We certainly had moms attend our <br/>
meetings who had bottle-fed in the past, but LLL accepts all moms and <br/>
accepts people where they ARE now (or at least this is the ideal).  Each <br/>
group is made up of the people who attend, and each leader is a volunteer <br/>
mom.  Therefore, no two meetings and no two groups are exactly the same, <br/>
but I do know that LLL does not encourage its members or leaders to <br/>
criticize others&#39; choices in any way.  My co-leader said it well.  She <br/>
asked moms who came to our meetings to think of the meetings as a <br/>
supermarket of ideas. Each mom knows her family and her situation best and <br/>
should only take the ideas that SHE feels would work in her situation, and <br/>
leave the rest, just as we don&#39;t buy everything in a supermarket.  The <br/>
point is that LLL acknowledges that each mom is THE expert on her family.<br/>
<br/>
It breaks my heart to think that you came away from La Leche League with <br/>
such a bad (but understandable) impression of the organization.  Many <br/>
people have come to our meetings warily because they had heard that LLL was <br/>
nothing but a bunch of breastfeeding maniacs, and they were pleasantly <br/>
surprised and went on to become members and held group jobs and one person <br/>
I can think of became a leader applicant.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
<br/>
Marji<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  By the way, we have had moms who come to our LLL meetings or call me <br/>
on the phone because they want to wean from the breast and start <br/>
bottles.  And, if this is the kind of support they need, this is the kind <br/>
of support a LLL leader would give.  Having said that, sometimes a mom will <br/>
ask for that kind of information but on further questioning from the LLL <br/>
leader, there is, in fact, a different issue that needs to be resolved and <br/>
then the breastfeeding relationship can continue, IF that&#39;s what the mom <br/>
REALLY wants.  We have to be careful to find out what the mom really wants.<br/>

<br/>
What  a horrible experience!  And how so very helpful (she says, dripping sarcasm.) <br/>
How very sad for them.  They could have welcomed a great mom into their midst, learned from you how to help mom&#39;s who were working to nurse (you could have told them what would and would not have worked for you...what you wish you knew etc.).  and lost they opportunity to advise and help you become a nursing mom to your third.<br/>
<br/>
Different groups have different folks. It pays to shop for the group you&#39;ll mesh with best.  I had a great LLL group in NYC,  but in Brooklyn, even though everyone was Jewish--and Orthodox Jews to boot, in contrast to the other group which was mixed (and where I was the only Orthodox member to the best of my recollection) they were less my type in terms of philosphy of life.  They were lovely people, just not where I was at in different ways.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, though it may have been a long time ago, hugs to  you for what you went through...<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

<h4>Myranda</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-920764517">Wonderful!!! I&#39;m not going to be able to make it though. :*(  We just don&#39;t have the money right now. I live close by, and will hopefully be able to drop in to meet some folks, though!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch regarding the teefers, she&#39;s played nice the past 3 days, I&#39;ll definitely be e-mailing you if she starts back up! :-)<br/>
Myranda<br/>
<br/>
  Okay!  I&#39;m packing my bags!!!  &lt;G&gt;  In fact, I&#39;m planning to come to the <br/>
  SOS conference in South Carolina next week (!!!), and if I remember <br/>
  correctly, you may be there, too!  I&#39;m REALLY looking forward to meeting <br/>
  all these amazing unschooling folks; this is like a dream come-true for me!<br/>
<br/>
  The truth is that I am a retired (emphasis on -tired) leader and I&#39;m not <br/>
  running meetings anymore.  But, that new-teeth thing is really quite <br/>
  manageable!  Please feel free to email me privately if you need some help <br/>
  finding help or some strategies for dealing with your little sweetie trying <br/>
  out her beautiful new teeth.<br/>
<br/>
  Warmly,<br/>

  &gt;promise!!!! I would have loved to have a supporting group to go to, heck, <br/>
  &gt;I still would! As it ended up, my midwife was the only one to help me any, <br/>
  &gt;and that was just once right after the birth, and again twice on the <br/>
  &gt;telephone. Thankfully, I had no problems or I don&#39;t know if I would have <br/>
  &gt;been able to work them out. My only problem now is my little princess has <br/>
  &gt;gotten teeth and is not afraid to use them! LOL<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I&#39;ll keep what you said about LLL&#39;s policies and such, I must just have <br/>
  &gt;found a lousy bunch. :-(<br/>
  &gt;Myranda<br/>
  &gt;   (((((((Myranda)))))))<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   I&#39;m SO sorry that you had that kind of an experience at a LLL <br/>
  &gt; meeting!  How<br/>
  &gt;   awful that must have felt!  Having been a LLL leader, it saddens me to <br/>
  &gt; hear<br/>
  &gt;   that you did not feel any support at the meeting you attended, a meeting<br/>
  &gt;   where the primary purpose is to offer support and encouragement to ALL <br/>
  &gt; moms<br/>
  &gt;   who wish to breastfeed their babies.  I can certainly understand why you<br/>
  &gt;   would have been brought to near tears after feeling attacked.  I think I<br/>
  &gt;   would have felt that way, too!  No mom should have to defend her <br/>
  &gt; choices to<br/>
  &gt;   ANYONE, certainly not people she is going to for HELP!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   But, I do want to say that LLL&#39;s policy is offer support through<br/>
  &gt;   encouragement, not attacking moms choices!  I pray and I believe that your<br/>
  &gt;   experience is not the typical experience a mom would have who had formerly<br/>
  &gt;   bottle-fed and wanted now to breastfeed.  We certainly had moms attend our<br/>
  &gt;   meetings who had bottle-fed in the past, but LLL accepts all moms and<br/>
  &gt;   accepts people where they ARE now (or at least this is the ideal).  Each<br/>
  &gt;   group is made up of the people who attend, and each leader is a volunteer<br/>
  &gt;   mom.  Therefore, no two meetings and no two groups are exactly the same,<br/>
  &gt;   but I do know that LLL does not encourage its members or leaders to<br/>
  &gt;   criticize others&#39; choices in any way.  My co-leader said it well.  She<br/>
  &gt;   asked moms who came to our meetings to think of the meetings as a<br/>
  &gt;   supermarket of ideas. Each mom knows her family and her situation best and<br/>
  &gt;   should only take the ideas that SHE feels would work in her situation, and<br/>
  &gt;   leave the rest, just as we don&#39;t buy everything in a supermarket.  The<br/>
  &gt;   point is that LLL acknowledges that each mom is THE expert on her family.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   It breaks my heart to think that you came away from La Leche League with<br/>
  &gt;   such a bad (but understandable) impression of the organization.  Many<br/>
  &gt;   people have come to our meetings warily because they had heard that LLL <br/>
  &gt; was<br/>
  &gt;   nothing but a bunch of breastfeeding maniacs, and they were pleasantly<br/>
  &gt;   surprised and went on to become members and held group jobs and one person<br/>
  &gt;   I can think of became a leader applicant.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Warmly,<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   Marji<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   P.S.  By the way, we have had moms who come to our LLL meetings or call me<br/>
  &gt;   on the phone because they want to wean from the breast and start<br/>
  &gt;   bottles.  And, if this is the kind of support they need, this is the kind<br/>
  &gt;   of support a LLL leader would give.  Having said that, sometimes a mom <br/>
  &gt; will<br/>
  &gt;   ask for that kind of information but on further questioning from the LLL<br/>
  &gt;   leader, there is, in fact, a different issue that needs to be resolved and<br/>
  &gt;   then the breastfeeding relationship can continue, IF that&#39;s what the mom<br/>
  &gt;   REALLY wants.  We have to be careful to find out what the mom really wants.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   At 15:31 10/3/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;Be careful what you say if you go to their meetings! I formula-fed <br/>
  &gt; both my<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;boys because I had to work full time. When I had my third baby, I had <br/>
  &gt; been<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;staying home for over 4 years, so I wanted to breastfeed her. I went to a<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;meeting.... they asked about how I&#39;d fed the boys, and I told them. The<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;rest of the meeting was spent with them attacking my choices and telling<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;me what a bad mom I was. Absolutely no support for me wanting to<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;breastfeed now, no help or advice, nothing. Just criticism for past<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;choices. I was almost in tears by the time I left.<br/>

Go ahead -- read it and see!<br/>

If you find you don&#39;t want to get a subscription for yourself you could<br/>
perhaps give a subscription to a young woman who would benefit from it<br/>
or donate a subscription to your local library.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great to spread the word.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175000481">So if you want to give your library a subscription gift, do you just <br/>
walk in and hand them a gift card stating that they&#39;ll be receiving <br/>
the magazine, or do you ask their permission first? <br/>
