Not all colleges. That&#39;s one place where choice comes in. I have a  <br/>
degree from Goddard College, which have assign grades, homework,  <br/>
textbooks, or set curricula. Students work with faculty advisors who  <br/>
help them shape their plan for their degree and their semester,  <br/>
within broad degree areas. For on-campus students (I did a low- <br/>
residency degree), faculty offer seminars in areas they&#39;re interested  <br/>
in, or work out seminar topics with students. Attendance is voluntary.<br/>

But of course I meant, &quot;which does not have grades, homework,  <br/>
