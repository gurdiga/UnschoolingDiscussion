&gt;<br/>
&gt; This came thru on a CA homeschooling list.  Anyone know more about this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Just to let you know, the State of Oregon has just had a Bill<br/>
&gt; &gt;   introduced on January 8th, 2001 whose passage would severely<br/>
&gt; &gt;   interfere with parents in homeschooling their children in our<br/>
&gt; &gt;   neighboring state.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I feel the Bill is important to California homeschoolers in that if<br/>
&gt; &gt;   it passes the Oregon legislature, it would only serve to further<br/>
&gt; &gt;   encourage anti-homeschooling interests here in California to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   introduce their own, similar or worse bills.  In my opinion, this<br/>
&gt; &gt;   bill needs to be preemptively defeated not only in the interest of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Oregon homeschoolers, but in the interest of neighboring states as<br/>
&gt; &gt;   well.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   If you want, you can read the entire Bill by following this link:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     OREGON - HOUSE BILL 2174<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Relating to school attendance; creating new provisions; and amending<br/>
&gt; &gt;     ORS 339.030, 339.035, 339.250 and 807.066.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.leg.state.or.us/01reg/measures/hb2100.dir/hb2174.intro.html">http://www.leg.state.or.us/01reg/measures/hb2100.dir/hb2174.intro.html</a><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   In a nutshell, this bill would prohibit parents who are not in<br/>
&gt; &gt;   possession of a high school diploma or a GED, from homeschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt;   their children.  Also, it would prevent any parent who received a<br/>
&gt; &gt;   truancy notice from their school district from homeschooling.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt;   would also prohibit parents from homeschooling who have been deemed<br/>
&gt; &gt;   in violation of the compulsory attendance law in Oregon.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Those homeschooling as well as those only wishing to explore<br/>
&gt; &gt;   homeschooling as an educational option would be required to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt;   state issued homeschooling ID.  In addition, parents would also be<br/>
&gt; &gt;   required to annually submit a notarized instruction plan that would<br/>
&gt; &gt;   detail all the educational materials that would be used during the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   coming school year, as well as submit a full plan of all times and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   places where the child will be taught.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   If this Bill passes in Oregon, it will make any campaign against a<br/>
&gt; &gt;   similar Bill here in California all that much harder to fight.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   If you have any homeschooling friends in Oregon, be sure to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   word out to them of this Bill&#39;s existence.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Its currently been referred to the House Student Achievement &<br/>
&gt; &gt;   School Accountability Committee, which consists of the following<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Representatives:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Rep. Vic Backlund, R-Keizer, Chair (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:backlund.rep@...">backlund.rep@...</a>)<br/>

&gt; &gt;     Rep. Mary Nolan, D-Portland (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nolan.rep@...">nolan.rep@...</a>)<br/>

&gt; &gt;     Rep. Bruce Starr, R-Aloha (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starr.rep@...">starr.rep@...</a>)<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Rep. Cliff Zauner, R-Woodburn (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:zauner.rep@...">zauner.rep@...</a>)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Ask your homeschooling friends in Oregon to write their<br/>
&gt; &gt;   representatives, especially if they live in any of the above<br/>
&gt; &gt;   representive&#39;s districts which are on this committee, and also to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   the chair of the committee Rep. Vic Backlund with their serious<br/>
&gt; &gt;   concerns over this bill.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
