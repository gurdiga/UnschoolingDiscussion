<br/>
I so I could use some suggestions for helping kids get<br/>
along. <br/>
<br/>
What do you do when two kids are fighting for a toy? <br/>
If I am in the room and I see a kid going to take<br/>
something from another I say &quot; I see Jack is playing<br/>
with the car now&quot; That is usually enough and I can<br/>
help the other find another toy. Yet if they really<br/>
want it I suggest that they can ask the the other kid<br/>
if the can play with it. If that kid says no then no<br/>
means no and I help the kids who wanted the car find<br/>
something else or otherwise distract them. <br/>
<br/>
What do you do when the kids really dig in and nothing<br/>
else is okay as a substitute?<br/>
<br/>
What if you didn&#39;t see who had it first. If kids say<br/>
that I am more often at a loss of what to do....<br/>
Sometimes I come into the fray after someone has taken<br/>
something from someone and I don&#39;t want to take it<br/>
back because that seems to me to me to be modeling<br/>
grabbing exactly what just happened already...Usually<br/>
I support the kids who wants the toy back by saying<br/>
you can request the toy back. If the other says no I<br/>
don&#39;t know what do....It seems not okay for somone to<br/>
take the toy away and seems not okay for me to take it<br/>
back....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I could sure use some other ideas how to go<br/>
about this or another way to look at it so I could<br/>
find all those x,y,z ways to react calmly to help the<br/>
kids. <br/>
<br/>
Remembering when ds-3yrs took a ball that was offered<br/>
to him kind of at a Tube Town kind of place. Seconds<br/>
afterwards the kid about 18 mo wanted it back. The dad<br/>
redirected the 18mo old to another ball and the kid<br/>
was fine. Thats probably what I would have done if the<br/>
18mo was mine. I wouldn&#39;t have has a problem with it.<br/>
I wonder if the Dad wished I had done more...I said to<br/>
my ds something like I think the little on wants the<br/>
ball back but he didn&#39;t want to give it back. So if I<br/>
am supposed to help him give it back which I am not<br/>
sure I am...but if I am how do you do that<br/>
respectfully? <br/>
<br/>
I generally strive to see myself as the facilitator of<br/>
getting along rather than the judge and jury... I do<br/>
need to be present for interactions maybe more than<br/>
other parents need to because my dd has a very intense<br/>
temperament. I also wonder when parents say we stay<br/>
out of their kids squabbles. Because if I do that it<br/>
can get really intense and hurtful...Parents who stay<br/>
on the sidelines are you facilitating or are you<br/>
really staying out of it or do you think you have more<br/>
even tempered kids?<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; What do you do when the kids really dig in and nothing<br/>

<br/>
What I did when they were little:<br/>
<br/>
Lift the encroaching kid up and out of the situation (physically) and <br/>
distract him with something useful, needed (help get wood, help feed the cat, <br/>
look at a nest, SOMETHING real), and when he calms down take him back to the <br/>
play area and say &quot;Marty wants to be next with that farmer, please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I say farmer because once there were other little kids over, and the Fisher <br/>
Price stuff was out--big deal town, people, furniture, houses, enough for <br/>
everybody, but at that moment the farmer was IT.  The only character.  <br/>
Everyone wanted him, to touch him, to be him.  There was pulling, yelling, <br/>
crying.  I don&#39;t remember exactly what I did, but I remember a couple of the <br/>
kids were in the kitchen and a couple or three were in the bedroom.  I had <br/>
Phase II planned out and was all proud of my Henry Kissinger-like strategy, <br/>
but then NOBODY wanted to play that anymore, they were SO happy with the <br/>
temporary distractions that the farmer had become of no value or allure <br/>
whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Poor farmer.<br/>
<br/>
(A few years later, Holly would not play Fisher Price unless she had the <br/>
baby.  The baby was the game and the others were supporting characters for <br/>
the Life of the Baby.)<br/>
<br/>
Our next big problem was the computer.  The kids were two and five or so when <br/>
Marty got old enough to want to play baby games.  We made a rule which stands <br/>
to this day, for adults and all.  Whoever has it has it as long as he wants.  <br/>
When he&#39;s done the next-declared person takes it for as long as he wants.  <br/>
The rule when they were little was &quot;no begging, no bugging&quot; but now that <br/>
they&#39;re older, it&#39;s okay to say &quot;I need to leave at 6:00 and would like to <br/>
check my e-mail&quot; or short negotations.  <br/>
<br/>
It works for us.<br/>

don&#39;t always know. The easier kid to pick up and take<br/>
away most of the time is the 3yo. 6 yo doesn&#39;t liked<br/>
to be picked up and take away. I can distract her with<br/>
a book sometimes. What if the encroaching kid is still<br/>
holding the object of desire. Did you ever pry it out<br/>
of clenched hands or wait for him/her to let it go<br/>
give it back? What happened if the other kid din&#39;t<br/>
want to give it to Marty? More distraction stuff to do<br/>
with Marty?<br/>

best by real life examples. I have a  handle on the<br/>
getting the philosophy of letting go and honoring kids<br/>
yet it could still use how does that look in real<br/>
life. Respecting kids and helping them get along<br/>
peacefully with each other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I had <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Phase II planned out and was all proud of my Henry<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is Henry Kissinger like strategy. Was he a better<br/>
diplomat than others? Struggling to remember why is he<br/>
important but don&#39;t remember why...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but then NOBODY wanted to play that anymore, they<br/>
&gt; were SO happy with the <br/>
&gt; temporary distractions that the farmer had become of<br/>

&gt; whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This happens to me too. I get them distracted support<br/>
the kid who isn&#39;t able to speak up for themselves well<br/>
yet. Then they decide they are all fine can get<br/>
along.. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So was that her Fisher Price piece mostly? Did she put<br/>
it away when friends were over...what? We have special<br/>
toys that the kids don&#39;t have to share. <br/>

everything. If someone is playing with something that<br/>
doesn&#39;t really lend itself for playing together or<br/>
they wanting to play alone they get to until they are<br/>
done. It has led to more sharing and more getting<br/>
along. I remember dd 5th bday she didn&#39;t want ds<br/>
playing with ANYTHING she got. It lasted at least 8mo<br/>
with only a few times of her bringing things out to<br/>
play with her brother briefly. This year she got<br/>
things for her bday and immediately handed her prized<br/>
Raichu stuffed animal to her brother to hold and<br/>
snuggle. <br/>

happen did it? <br/>
<br/>
When did you anyone respond here... stop needing to<br/>
step in so much when did that change? Whatever the age<br/>
I think I&#39;ll tack on a few years for good measure :)<br/>

<br/>
Same thing.  Distract them with other things, separate them.  In that case, I <br/>
forgot to say, there was so much confusion that I claimed the farmer until we <br/>
could figure out a good way to handle it.  The kids didn&#39;t even know who <br/>
should have  had it.  The person with the farm and the tractor had a good <br/>
claim on needing the farmer.  The kid who had him in hand didn&#39;t have farm <br/>
equipment.  <br/>
<br/>
The fight wasn&#39;t about the toy, it was about feelings.  As soon as feelings <br/>
were better &quot;it&quot; the situation was better.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That didn&#39;t mean that begging and bugging didn&#39;t<br/>
happen did it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Begging and bugging quit almost immediately and forever.  Kirby tried <br/>
sneaky a couple of times to intimidate Marty but I&#39;d calmly say that maybe <br/>
Kirby should just wait until tomorrow.  When the choice started to look like <br/>
&quot;after Marty&quot; or &quot;tomorrow,&quot; Kirby was motivated to find something else to do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When did you anyone respond here... stop needing to<br/>
step in so much when did that change? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gradually from three to grown.  I still step in sometimes and Kirby is <br/>
fifteen and Marty&#39;s nearly 13.   Sometimes when there&#39;s underlying <br/>
frustration, or someone&#39;s sick, or angry at other factors (often not even <br/>
something in the house), they don&#39;t make the best choices.  To protect <br/>
property and safety, I&#39;ll intervene (artfully if possible, subtly at best, <br/>
and bluntly at worst).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335281864">I like the range of possibilities, Sandra. Sometimes we don&#39;t have the luxury of enough time to go through all of the explanations about why you need to get your cute little behind out of the street so that big ole dumptruck can roar on by.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in the Army, I went to a lot of trouble to create situations in which soldiers in my platoon could see me making decisions while taking them as human beings into consideration. This way, when it came time to issue an order without much explanation, they knew me and knew they could trust me, and would execute the order knowing that when we had time, I would tell them what I knew. Too bad my commander didn&#39;t like my style of leadership!<br/>
