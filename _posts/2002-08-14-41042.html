<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997372013"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;every September I start to feel a little nervous about the fact that <br/>
&gt;&gt;everyone is getting ready for school - even the other homeschoolers all <br/>
&gt;&gt;ask - &quot;so what curriculm are you doing?&quot;  and I start to consider - well <br/>
&gt;&gt;maybe I&#39;ll have some sort of plan....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And you DO have a plan. I&#39;m sure you are planning to continue being with <br/>
your child each and every day. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re planning to continue to read <br/>
to her and answer her questions. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re planning to play with her, <br/>
take her places and show her lots of cool new stuff. That&#39;s the plan.<br/>
<br/>
You might even take a moment to feel a little smug that you didn&#39;t stop <br/>
these supportive learning moments for a &quot;summer break&quot;. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re <br/>
planning to continue unschooling 24/7. ;-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I felt the same way.  When she learned to swim on her own, it was a big <br/>
&gt;&gt;relief for me.  Also, some ammunition to use when people ask, &quot;she&#39;s not <br/>
&gt;&gt;going to school?  How will she learn?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t you just sometimes feel like laughing when whe people say that? I mean <br/>
really. How will she learn?! Are they kidding?!<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
