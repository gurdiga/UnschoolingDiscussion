<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156979652">Good rant!  I have spoken up many times when I &quot;should&quot; have ducked.  I told a colleague at my new job about it as we worked side by side and she was appalled at first.  But I hung in there because I KNOW it is logical and I KNOW it&#39;s right.  Now she&#39;s pretty cool with me.  Ah well.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand I have provoked a friend whose 1st baby is due in 20-some days that he must not send the child to school.  He listens.  He wants excellence in his child and I kept asking him how he was going to ensure that, why he was going to learn it up the &quot;System&quot;?  His wife wants to be home with baby, so I think they may make it work.<br/>
<br/>
So, ... if I&#39;m always ducking, I don&#39;t get a genuine life!!!  You too I think, eh, Nanc?<br/>
<br/>
Got the book &quot;Fierce Conversations&quot; thru Inter-Library loan and read the first 10 pages last night - Excellent! - and right on this rant topic.  The idea there is that we build our lives and our reality one conversation at a time.  And if they are not fierce, then life becomes a lie.  Does that fit, Nanc?<br/>
<br/>
Hope you keep it up!  Rant ON!<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I said&quot;Gee, if you were unschooling you wouldn&#39;t have to think about that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>at all&quot;. She was not   amused.<br/>
I often feel with regular school-at-home type HSers that I must not mention <br/>
the joys of unschooling my children, that they feel very threatened by it.One <br/>
woman was asking me about unschooling and kept coming back to her concern about <br/>
retaining Authority over her children. What is with this????<br/>
I want to be an advocate for unschooling, yet am not comfortable really <br/>
talking about it to these other homeschoolers because it seems to freak them out. <br/>

There are a couple of mainstream education books that don&#39;t flat out say <br/>
&quot;homeschool&quot; but they lay out a lot of evidence that the way public <br/>
school is organized is a poor fit for the way people learn best.  One is <br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s book The School&#39;s Our Children Deserve.  Another has a <br/>
title something like Coloring Outside the Lines.  I don&#39;t remember the <br/>
author and it was mostly about how he enriched his kids education <br/>
outside of school.  Any way, both make a lot of pro-homeschooling points <br/>
even though the books aren&#39;t about homeschooling.  These are good books <br/>
for the parents of very young kids who don&#39;t want to be directly <br/>
&quot;converted&quot; by you to homeschooling but that are open to learning more <br/>
about education.  Stuff on multiple intelligences by Thomas Armstrong is <br/>
also valuable.<br/>

There are a couple of mainstream education books that don&#39;t flat out say <br/>

school is organized is a poor fit for the way people learn best.  One is <br/>

author and it was mostly about how he enriched his kids education <br/>
outside of school.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Coloring Outside The Lines&quot; by Roger Shank  The secondary title: Raising a Smarter Kid by Breaking All the Rules.  It begins &quot;I am writing this book because I am horrified by what schools are doing to children.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;Any way, both make a lot of pro-homeschooling points <br/>
even though the books aren&#39;t about homeschooling.  These are good books <br/>
for the parents of very young kids who don&#39;t want to be directly <br/>
&quot;converted&quot; by you to homeschooling but that are open to learning more <br/>

Thomas Armstrong &quot;In Their Own Way&quot;  Discovering and Enchouraging your childs Personal Learning Style.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely agree with your suggestions  <br/>
There is also a book specifically geared to help kids get through the system but is also Home Ed friendly  &quot;Learning outside the lines&quot;  by Jonathan  Mooney and David Cole.  The authors had learning disabilities and ADHD to deal with and made it through University and try to give suggestions to help them succeed in life despite the &#39;lines&#39; people are always trying to enclose you in. <br/>
