trying to tell this list that even though counties in CA are using scare<br/>
tactics against homeschoolers, that it&#39;s nothing to worry about anywhere and<br/>
the unschool list should not discuss it?<br/>
<br/>
And, in all respect, what do you mean by &quot;nothing more than&quot; scare tactics?<br/>

which were obviously sent hours ago - like this one of Ned&#39;s - are <br/>
just showing up on my computer now.<br/>
<br/>
If you read carefully you&#39;ll see that I didn&#39;t make the statement <br/>
about &quot;nothing more than&quot; scare tactics - HSC legal advisor Linda <br/>
Conrad-Jansen did. What I was saying was that this has happened <br/>
before and homeschool leaders in California are dealing with it quite <br/>
capably. For more information please visit the web site for the <br/>
Homeschool Association of California: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a><br/>
<br/>
For the record: I don&#39;t have any objections to a discussion of the <br/>
situation on this list.<br/>

they&#39;ve been saying for years, and yet I&#39;m not aware of a single county<br/>
that&#39;s ever won.<br/>
