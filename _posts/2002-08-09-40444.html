<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077335141">&lt;&lt;he caused a war.  He killed people from Russian to Africa.  He was a<br/>
monster.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He was insane.<br/>
<br/>
If killing innocent people in a war makes one a monster, how monstrous is<br/>
the United States?  As we get ready to make war on Iraq, I think it is<br/>
important to remember that the people who will die are not the ones who made<br/>
the choices for which their country is being &quot;punished&quot;.  Just like the<br/>
Afghanis.  I don&#39;t think the old, poor, women and children (the ones not<br/>
able to run to Pakistan) were the ones making policy decisions about<br/>
Al-Quaida.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry....but the Evil vs. Good debate starts to grate after awhile.<br/>

&gt; That depends on which Christian church you are talking about. The<br/>
&gt; church I belong to does not have the same concept of Hell as most<br/>
&gt; others. We don&#39;t believe in a literal firey pit. We do believe that<br/>
&gt; all of the evil people will spend eternity with each other though,<br/>
&gt; and never be around good people. I think that would be all the<br/>
&gt; punishment neccessary. And by evil people, we don&#39;t mean people who<br/>
&gt; believe differently than us, we mean really evil people like Hitler,<br/>
&gt; child molestors, murders, etc. You know, people who, by just about<br/>
&gt; any standard, would be considered evil.<br/>

<br/>
What about all the people who helped Hitler directly with the job of killing<br/>
6M people in ovens?  you know, the ones who designed the ovens and built<br/>
them, the ones who sewed the prisoners&#39; uniforms and collected the gold from<br/>
their teeth after they died, those who ordered the trains to collect the<br/>
prisoners. It must have take many millions to do all that (do you think they<br/>
didn&#39;t know what they were doing as they watched their neighbors being<br/>
hauled away and loaded on the trains with none of their possessions and<br/>
their shops destroyed...and all the people in other countries who believed<br/>
he was doing exactly the right thing...<br/>
<br/>
How do I &quot;qualify&quot; as a &quot;good&quot; person?<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure that your brand of Cristianity has enough room in its Hell for<br/>
all the people it thinks really belong there? Exactly where does it draw the<br/>
line. Really, I&#39;ve always been interested in this, and I&#39;m sure the kids are<br/>
too.<br/>
