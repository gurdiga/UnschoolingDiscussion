if you other son turns out to be the next George Lucas?  Goofing off.... to <br/>
me what they are doing is unschooling.  Sounds like your daughter has years <br/>
of indoctrination to work through... Why would she expect you to give her <br/>
work?  Why doesn&#39;t she decide for herself what she wants to learn and go find <br/>
out about it?<br/>
