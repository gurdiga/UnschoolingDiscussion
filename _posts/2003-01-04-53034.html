<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943245378">As far as I know, there aren&#39;t any official unschooling groups in town, but<br/>
there are a lot of unschoolers.  There also used to be a playgroup at the<br/>
old Resource Center for families with young children, but i don&#39;t know if it<br/>
still in existance or not.  I would recommend attending a meeting or two to<br/>
see who you could hook up with.<br/>

Are you familiar with HECLC?  It&#39;s a group trying to start a  new Resource<br/>
Center in Columbus.  Our next meeting is Thursday the 23rd at the<br/>
Worthington Library.</div>

    Sorry I&#39;m so far behind. ;-) If you email me off list I&#39;ll give you my<br/>
number and we can talk, if you like. Did you get to the Inches meeting last<br/>
week? <br/>
