<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966520045">You&#39;re comparing apples to oranges, though. My kid playing video games isn&#39;t <br/>
going to create a medical bill that I&#39;ll be paying. Neither will him not <br/>
cleaning his plate (something that I have NEVER nor ever WILL demand of my <br/>
kids. I don&#39;t fuss about food. Period.) But a kid choosing not to brush his <br/>
teeth, can lead to big dental bills. Especially when said kid eats lots of <br/>
sweets.<br/>
<br/>
Of course being a parent costs money. I expect that. And i do provide <br/>
healthy food for nibbling, and I have also informed my kids that eating a <br/>
slice of cheese, if they can&#39;t get to a toothbrush, is healthier for them <br/>
than not. I guess cheese neutralizes acids or something. Sugarless gum, too.<br/>
<br/>
But, when i go to bed at night, one of the things I say to them is &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
forget to brush your teeth.&quot; (along with &quot;I love you. Please keep the noise <br/>
down.&quot; etc.) And sometimes I remind them during the day &quot;You&#39;ve been eating <br/>
candy. Don&#39;t forget to brush tonight.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the reason I do, is because cavities cost me money, and it&#39;s *mostly* <br/>
preventable. I know it&#39;s not dyed in the wool guaranteed that brushing <br/>
prevents cavities, but I&#39;m sure that not brushing allows the germs to breed, <br/>
and I&#39;m sure that isn&#39;t good.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;m all for kids making choices, but when I have to foot<br/>
&gt;the bill for the dental caries...then I get to tell them what to do. LOL<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I see that you are laughing, but this idea is one step away from a bunch of<br/>
&gt;really horrible parenting ideas:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;while you are under my roof, you&#39;ll do as I say/follow my rules&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I paid for that class, so you have to finish the whole course&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I paid for the computer/game system/tv/videos so I can take them away&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Food costs money, clean your plate&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Did any of us think bringing up children would be financially unimposing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sometimes kids with the best dental hygiene in the world still need<br/>
&gt;orthodontics.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes kids accidentally get hit in the teeth with a baseball.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;I pay for your clothes. I&#39;ll choose what you may wear.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s right up there with having an expectation of gratitude as being &quot;owed&quot;<br/>
&gt;obedience.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It reminds me of the scene in &quot;Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner&quot; when Sidney<br/>
&gt;Poitier&#39;s character says to his father, &quot;You did what you were *supposed* <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;do&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575569946">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;You&#39;re comparing apples to oranges, though. My kid playing video games<br/>

<br/>
Some ordinary parents would use the idea that playing video games &quot;too much&quot;<br/>
could cause eye damage which costs money for eye exams and spectacles.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents would use the idea that food costs money as an excuse to be<br/>
limiting and coercive.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents use the idea of future medical expenses as a reason to restrict<br/>
and limit food consumption. <br/>
<br/>
Some people use the idea that they pay the mortgage to restrict how their<br/>
child can decorate their own room.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t talking about what you do, Heidi, or what I do about tooth brushing<br/>
or giving information about how to have healthier teeth.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking about the larger ideas that money, or the cost of living, or<br/>
the cost of stuff - or the fact that usually it is the job of one or both<br/>
parents to earn the money - that money is used as a rationale for coercion<br/>
and limiting and punitive, conditional parenting. The whole idea of whose<br/>
money is it, whose home is it, whose stuff is it, whose life is it, who is<br/>
the boss. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are new folk on this list who haven&#39;t yet thought about how<br/>
these ideas might be permeating their lives, even if you are personally<br/>
beyond them. <br/>
