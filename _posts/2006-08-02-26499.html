<br/>
I do understand, but it&#39;s also a kind of snarky, accusing question.   <br/>
I doubt you meant it to be antagonistic, but &quot;Throw me a bone&quot; isn&#39;t  <br/>
a nice way to ask.  If you don&#39;t understand or you&#39;re getting angry,  <br/>
I am absolutely confident that it&#39;s not that I and others have failed  <br/>
to spend enough of our time sharing the details of our homelives.    <br/>
We have piled up a gigantic BONEYARD of clues and confessions and  <br/>
stories, from MANY, many unschoolers who have written over the years.<br/>
http://http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/<br/>
http://sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>
<br/>
Something brand new yesterday might help more than anything.  It&#39;s  <br/>
the homeschooling blog carnival&#39;s August edition with links to nearly  <br/>
20 pieces of writing all related in theme, and this time it&#39;s about  <br/>
the extension of the principles of unschooling into other parts of life.<br/>
http://anunschoolinglife.blogspot.com/2006/08/unschooling- <br/>
voices-2_01.html<br/>
<br/>
-=-I just want to know you are real.-=-<br/>
<br/>
http://sandradodd.com/zeneverything talks about me swatting Marty  <br/>
when he was just little, when I got too frustrated to do any better.   <br/>
Will knowing I spanked my kid make you feel better, and like I am  <br/>
real?  It&#39;s not like you dragged it out of me.  I wrote it myself  <br/>
years ago, and made it public in the hope that it would help others.<br/>
<br/>
If finding where you can relax and settle and be just better than the  <br/>
worst things some of us have ever done is going to comfort you,  <br/>
you&#39;re doing QUITE a school thing, I think, which is grading on the  <br/>
curve. Justifying slack.  I don&#39;t want to justify slack in my life or  <br/>
to help others do so.  That would not make me more &quot;real.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone here remembers the last time someone told us (here or  <br/>
on UnschoolingDiscussion) that she would feel better if people would  <br/>
tell her of the times they&#39;d failed.  Maybe you could be directed to  <br/>
that thread if you want.   A list where people share negative stories  <br/>
won&#39;t be as helpful as one where they share successes.<br/>
<br/>
You can find LOTS of places where moms badmouth their kids and  <br/>
justify their own failures and the moms all sooth and comfort each  <br/>
other while belitting their kids.  They&#39;ll take turns saying &quot;it&#39;s So  <br/>
HARD being a mom, and kids are so silly/immature/crazy/mean/ <br/>
sneaky.&quot;   Maybe that&#39;s not what you have in mind.  I hope not, but  <br/>
such places exist in abundance.  They don&#39;t help people unschool,  <br/>
except maybe in the way that they see that mindful parenting really  <br/>
DOES make a profound difference in every part of life.<br/>
<br/>
I hope no one here is expecting this list to be the sole source of  <br/>
unschooling information.  It was never intended to be that.  The  <br/>
first assumption of this list, which I think is clear from the  <br/>
description, is that I&#39;m assuming group members will have read some  <br/>
John Holt.<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/<br/>
The whole group description is there, but in addition to the John  <br/>
Holt preface (there&#39;s lots of Holt to read here:<br/>
http://sandradodd.com/johnholt )  it says &quot;It&#39;s an idea group and is  <br/>
intended to lean more toward pure unschooling than neutral, general  <br/>
homeschooling discussion�there are hundreds of general homeschooling  <br/>
discussions for newcomers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here are dozens of other sources linked for anyone who thinks this  <br/>
list alone isn&#39;t providing enough information.  This page also has  <br/>
existed for a while and hasn&#39;t been hidden:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-967661311">-=-Do your kids ever do anything that irritates you, troubles you, makes<br/>

real.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The one thing my kids do sometimes that irritates me is to look at the<br/>
negative side of things.  On occasion they are tired or stuck in a rut and<br/>
they seem to see the worst in people and in themselves too.  It drives me<br/>
crazy.  I am a person who focuses on the glass being half full rather than<br/>
half empty.  I have a hard time being around people who see all the negative<br/>
things in life and not the hundred little positive things that are around us<br/>
every day all the time.  When they get like that though, I know that<br/>
something isn&#39;t right and we talk about it and try to get to the bottom of<br/>
the issue that is of concern to them.  (sometimes they just need a little<br/>
more sleep) We also talk about how their attitude can affect the people<br/>
around them.  Often just drawing their attention to it makes them realize<br/>
they are doing it and they apologize and find something positive to think<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
We rarely argue here.  We sometime misunderstand each other and get a little<br/>
grumpy but we always talk about it immediately and figure out where the<br/>
misunderstanding came from and sort it out.  <br/>
<br/>
I think one thing that is important to mention is that in our family we all<br/>
seem to have a high intrapersonal intelligence. (We all seem to know<br/>
ourselves well and what we want most of the time.  We don&#39;t have to try to<br/>
figure each other out, we just ask.) Interpersonally is more challenging for<br/>
all of us outside our own family.  (I just don&#39;t get what makes some people<br/>
tick sometimes.)  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel socially awkward in a group setting.  But I have to say<br/>
recently I&#39;ve dealt with some kids who seem to have no clue about what other<br/>
people might be feeling at all and it shows so much in how they talk to<br/>
other people, inadvertently putting them down without thinking about it<br/>
much.  (public schooled kids too...there goes that socialization issue<br/>
arguement)<br/>
<br/>
Not sure where this is going really.  I just thought I&#39;d answer your post as<br/>
if you were talking to me.  We are a real family.  We have our frustrations<br/>
and our misunderstandings.  The girls have free access to TV, yet don&#39;t<br/>
watch all day long most of the time.  We spend time with our animals, we<br/>
play games (board and computer), email, write to penpals, they visit friends<br/>
and have them over, enjoy pony club, swimming in our small pool, going to<br/>
water parks, hanging out.  The girls are happy.  They play well together.<br/>
We problem solve when misunderstandings happen but life is generally pretty<br/>
smooth and enjoyable.  But like I said, I focus on the good things.  Life is<br/>
good!<br/>

 <br/>
Sheesh, I get so sick of all those cliche&#39;s...all teens will rebel, &quot;you&#39;re  <br/>
spoiling your kids&quot;, kids need lots of structure...<br/>
 <br/>
If finding out whether we are real people out here includes everyone, let  me <br/>
share this.<br/>
<br/>
When I first began homeschooling I fell into the jumper wearing, spanking,  <br/>
school at home, M. Pride, Homeschool Legal defense patriotism <br/>
thing...LOL...Talk  about not being real.  The expectations and the box most homeschoolers were <br/>
 put in, were expected to be, was a hundred time worse than any unschooling  <br/>
&quot;utopia&quot; someone might be reaching or striving for.  The pressure for our  <br/>
kids to perform better than school kids was tremendous.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling has opened us up to life...to family, time spent together, time  <br/>
spent pursuing what we love, enjoy, are passionate about.  When I made the  <br/>
comment that &quot;I think each kid has a TV in their rooms&quot; I realized later I would <br/>
 have hidden that fact in the past from other more academic and especially  <br/>
religous home schoolers.  Now I don&#39;t give a rats a**.  We have 3 or 4  game <br/>
systems too, and I don&#39;t even know what they are or what games we  have!<br/>
 <br/>
Being real can just mean saying to heck with all the expectations out  there, <br/>
and concentrating on your family, simply living, growing and  learning.  More <br/>
and more, I look ahead to the end of my life, and ask  myself, &quot;What will <br/>
matter most when I&#39;m 80?  That my kids learned French  and Algebra, or that they <br/>
can form good relationships with people?  That  they shoot for a top ten most <br/>
in demand career, or that they learn peace  and contentment in their lives and <br/>
souls?  <br/>
 <br/>
What would be a better gift to our kids,...the aching urge to break  free <br/>
from the nest because theyr&#39;e so confined and disciplined at home, or lots  of <br/>
freedom NOW so that that home is not something they want to push away.   I don&#39;t <br/>
know about all of you, but I want my kids to take their time leaving..my  <br/>
rejection of another hateful &quot;cliche&quot; that kids should be pushed out on their  <br/>
18th birthday...phooey.<br/>

<br/>
Pushing the algebra and French and putting pressure on them to choose  <br/>
a top-ten career - that can interfere with their ability to for good  <br/>
relationships, be considerate and caring, live a peaceful and happy  <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
But focusing on having that peace and happiness now, in their right- <br/>
now-real lives, won&#39;t interfere at all with them choosing to learn  <br/>
algebra or french or become a doctor or engineer or architect or  <br/>
whatever they might find is their calling.<br/>

<br/>
They might have all that, but would have CHOSEN all that.<br/>
<br/>
I finished a college degree at the age of 20.  It was a GOOD one, in  <br/>
that I liked it, I use things I learned still, but it wasn&#39;t &quot;a good  <br/>
one&quot; in that it was a technical sciences degree with which people can  <br/>
get puffed up big-salary jobs for doing sometimes less work than  <br/>
other people do.   I had English with a minor in psychology (and a  <br/>
minor minor I finished the next year in anthropology) and an I-don&#39;t- <br/>
like-to-talk-about-it minor (certification requirements, not called a  <br/>
minor, because it was embarrassing, in education.  RICH AND FUN for  <br/>
me, good for being an English teacher and not much more.<br/>
<br/>
I married a guy who didn&#39;t have a degree, who&#39;d been going to school  <br/>
a little, some, off and on, since his parents basically told him it  <br/>
was that or the military when he finished high school, and he  <br/>
finished a degree in engineering at the age of 29, nearly 30.  He had  <br/>
just turned 30 when Kirby was born that next summer.   Engineering,  <br/>
with a minor in theatre.  Yep, it was one of those university  <br/>
advisors Tetris situations. &lt;g&gt;  Shuffle 160 mismatched credits of  <br/>
someone who changed minors three times into something that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
So I look at Kirby, who&#39;s 20 and thinking of taking culinary arts  <br/>
courses, maybe, not in a hurry, who was made an expert cashier today  <br/>
(or whatever they call it) which comes with a raise and an obligation  <br/>
to train others, and I don&#39;t think &quot;OH NO!  He&#39;ll never be able to go  <br/>
to college!&quot;  Because here I am, &quot;not using my degree,&quot; and there&#39;s  <br/>
Keith, who was much less unemployed when he was Kirby&#39;s age than  <br/>
Kirby is now, and I just don&#39;t worry at all.<br/>
