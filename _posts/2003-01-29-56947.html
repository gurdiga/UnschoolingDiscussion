<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know, but here&#39;s food for thought.<br/>
<br/>
When a friend of ours decided to go to seminary, he had to take the GRE&#39;s.<br/>
Graduate Record Exams.  They&#39;re supposed to be an indicator of success in<br/>
graduate education.<br/>
<br/>
The man held a Ph.D. in Math.  He has 3 degrees already, and they HAD to<br/>
have GRE&#39;s to admit him.  (Were they worried about him not succeeding in<br/>
grad school?)  And then, of course, he aced the math portion, and they were<br/>
very impressed.  DUUUUUH!<br/>
<br/>
Stupid tests make numbers to stick in a computer.  Computer gotta have the<br/>
numbers, nobody else cares.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724648618">Just a thought I got here about testing for now reason whatsoever other <br/>
than to fill in the blanks--<br/>
<br/>
When I was pregnant with ds, my midwife was concerned that he was breech <br/>
and sent me to the doctor in case I ended up &quot;needing&quot; a hospital birth. <br/>
After the exam and ultrasound, I was asked to give a sample for a <br/>
pregnancy test...huh?!?!...oh, yeah, we need it for the records...<br/>
