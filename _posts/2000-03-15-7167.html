&lt;&lt; you have to be equally<br/>
<br/>
compassionate and understanding with yourself as you are with your kids<br/>
<br/>
- don&#39;t hold either up to a standard of &#39;the right way to be&#39; just<br/>
<br/>
desire honesty and contentment.   the more you accept the way things are<br/>
<br/>
-without harsh judgment, and the more you have a clear idea of what you<br/>
<br/>
want then just live your life, the more you are able to behave in a way<br/>
<br/>
that feels natural and promotes happiness in everyone.<br/>

i find this to be true, too. and am glad you brought it up again.  being <br/>
accepting of where we are is not only salve for the soul, it is also a good <br/>
example for the kids.  i believe that the overall attempts with my kids are <br/>
very valuable and that individual screwups by me are not the most important <br/>
thing.  and the kids are certainly going to be familiar with humaness and <br/>
persistance if i just keep trying.  sometimes though, i feel apathetic and <br/>
overwhelmed when i havent had enough positive reactions (from myself toward <br/>
them!)  but just today i had several of those wonderful moments that i cling <br/>
to with my little ones, and those will see me through more days of mistakes <br/>
and give me patience for the challenges i struggle with in parenting.  making <br/>
the most of the positive things gives me fuel for the stretches where my <br/>
patience is thin and negativity abounds.  now, when i see what i am writing, <br/>
it validates me that i am under a burden (for me) and i do need to credit <br/>
myself for hanging in.  i feel like i am headed back into the trenches as i <br/>
will have a newborn, two yr old, 4yo (boys) and 8 & 10yo girls this summer.  <br/>
and the pregnancy might be putting demands on me that make my resources have <br/>
less depth than i&#39;d like.  not complaining, just trying to affirm why i seem <br/>
to be grasping for some even parenting patience lately!  (could it be the <br/>
challenging 21month old who loves to throw things and bop everyone?  or <br/>
perhaps the four yo trying out his recent burst of testosterone that i have he<br/>
ard they get around this age?  or maybe the feisty antagonizing daughters <br/>
whose love-hate relationship has its moments?  haha...perhaps!!!! ty for the <br/>
vent :) )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578626869">I wonder if Zach would do better if he &#39;got ready to go&#39; as part of <br/>
his morning routine that day....even if actually going wasn&#39;t until <br/>
later.  I mean,  if he&#39;s able to maintain his clothes ok,  he could <br/>
put them on when he dresses.  If not,  he sets out the clothes,  <br/>
socks,  shoes, whatever,  so that changing will be very quick.<br/>
  And maybe he could gather any other needed supplies and get them in <br/>
the van *way early*...so that he mostly just needs to walk out at the <br/>
appropriate time.<br/>
    Of course,  this is more a suggestion of something to discuss <br/>
with Zach to see if he wants to try it this way with your reminders, <br/>
etc.<br/>
   My oldest agreed to do this for things and it&#39;s helped us quite a <br/>
bit.  If we need to go somewhere in the early morning,  she sets up <br/>
her &#39;stuff&#39; the night before.<br/>
