I may get burned on this one, but choices to me does not extend to choosing<br/>
your own foods at an early age.  Like many things, I&#39;m sure folks with older<br/>
kids perspectives on this are probably different than mine, since my son is<br/>
5, not 15.  I can easily see how this might change as a child grows older.<br/>
<br/>
However, the cook chooses the food here.  The cook is me, always, as at the<br/>
moment, I am the only one inclined toward kitchen duty.  But since my son<br/>
left the realm of really mushy food at a year or so, he has eaten what we<br/>
eat.  Options include take it or leave it.  That holds true for other<br/>
children who have eaten at my house, friends and long-term visiting kids.  I<br/>
don&#39;t have the resources (financial or otherwise) to stock a variety of<br/>
foods for choosing; however, if someone decides to &quot;leave it&quot; with a<br/>
particular food, there is usually something on the table they &quot;take&quot;, so<br/>
nobody starves.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever thought of breakfast choices (icecream or otherwise)<br/>
as related to unschooling, though!  :)<br/>
