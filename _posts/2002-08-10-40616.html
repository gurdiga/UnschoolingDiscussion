&gt; &quot;Christianity comes from Christ, religion is man made.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned carries on:::<br/>
<br/>
Who knew that this was a religion group....? Well, so be it. I&#39;ll give it a<br/>
shot.   (it will tie in, just wait)<br/>
<br/>
The Bible tells the story of the evolution of man&#39;s perception of, and<br/>
relationship to, the supernatural -- god -- the &quot;greater force&quot; behind<br/>
worldly things, and the spiritual life, so to speak. &quot;It&#39;s all in God&#39;s<br/>
hands,&quot; as they(we)<br/>
 say.<br/>
<br/>
Early on, man desperately needed explanations for things that were, and<br/>
still often are, beyond our comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
Faced with often overwhelming natural forces, we imagine an all powerful<br/>
spirit that controls the world, indeed, the universe, and in the process,<br/>
controls our puny existence.<br/>
<br/>
Early &quot;gods&quot; were the very forces of nature...Zeus, Mars, etc. There were<br/>
graven images of animals, tree worshippers, sacrifices (murders) to show our<br/>
fear of the forces of &quot;heaven.&quot; Kings became gods to their people.<br/>
<br/>
Humans have, is seems, always had a need to ascribe anthropomorphic<br/>
qualities and motives to the forces of nature and to the nether world and to<br/>
the firmament. Thus, some gave their god a male human form and placed &quot;him&quot;<br/>
in the heavens. &quot;He&quot; was to be the good (god) guy who would protect them, if<br/>
they obeyed certain rules. And to explain all the &quot;bad&quot; stuff that happens,<br/>
they created another guy (bad guy) and he lived, they were sure, underneath<br/>
everything.....in Hell.<br/>
<br/>
All this imagery has been incredibly useful for financial institutions such<br/>
as churces. The threat of Hell and damnation, along with the promise of<br/>
someday sitting on the knee of a benevolent &quot;creator&quot; comprise the twin<br/>
enticements for supporting a huge corps of therapists called clergy. (Hmm,<br/>
sounds like what the public schools do to create their brand of conformity,<br/>
&quot;Sit still and be quiet, and you&#39;ll get As; but if you don&#39;t we&#39;ll drug you<br/>
into a stupor)<br/>
<br/>
But the Bible goes further, because man is still evolving. Man&#39;s view of<br/>
&quot;god&quot; changed over the centuries to a more and more enlightened idea. That<br/>
advanced thinking is described in the New Testament. For my money, Jesus<br/>
(and a few others, like Buddha) led the way out of the era of nature and<br/>
animal worship into an era in which god is seen simply as man&#39;s highest view<br/>
of himself. Jesus called it Love. Christianity changed everything, or, as<br/>
Ren said, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; turn[ed} the status quo on it&#39;s head.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Religion has become a personal thing, instead of a group thing, even though<br/>
many people still enjoy group rituals and celebrations or their &quot;truth.&quot;<br/>
There&#39;s even a joke, &quot;Hey, I saw God, and she&#39;s black !&quot;  -- talk about<br/>
upsetting the apple cart...<br/>
<br/>
So, today, we don&#39;t grovel in front of a carved statue of a beast, we don&#39;t<br/>
pray (beg) to an unknowable &quot;man&quot; in the sky, but we grow (if we can) in an<br/>
understanding and demonstration of our own highest ethics and best<br/>
attributes. If we read the Bible (which I used to but don&#39;t these days) we<br/>
learn that we are created in the image and likeness of God.<br/>
<br/>
What &quot;good news&quot; (the meaning of &quot;gospel&#39;) that is!  If we can believe that,<br/>
then we know that we are not born as &quot;sinners,&quot; but with all the qualities<br/>
we need in order to perfect our lives. It means there is no need to beg for<br/>
favors, no need to pay for forgiveness, no need to believe that anyone or<br/>
anything has power over us or is god&#39;s go-between. (Martin Luther drew that<br/>
line in the sand for us, saying, in effect, that we could speak driectly to<br/>
god, if we wanted to. Wow, what a breakthrough)<br/>
<br/>
We have examples of people in several cultures coming to similar<br/>
conclusions. Man has evolved much since the days of cow worship and man<br/>
worship. Today, there need be no intermediary (priest) between man and<br/>
whatever we view as a creative/benevolent spirit, or god.<br/>
<br/>
 The same evolution took place in nations...America was founded on the still<br/>
relatively new (in 1750) idea that the individual is more important than the<br/>
group, and our government was viewed by the framers as the mechanism to<br/>
protect individual citizens from harm, whether from other individuals or<br/>
groups.  While government schooling is the last vestige of socialist ideas<br/>
(top-down control, or subsumption of individuals to the group),<br/>
homeschooling is helping our country to overcome that oppression and evolve<br/>
to a higher level of self- and universal awareness.<br/>
