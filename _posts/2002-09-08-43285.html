Your job isn&#39;t to make sure she learns &quot;everything she needs to know&quot;. You <br/>
can&#39;t know what everything she needs will turn out to be, anyway. But you can <br/>
and should help her to explore the world and everything in it, help her to <br/>
find the people she can learn from (people to talk to, people to read, people <br/>
to watch), help her to understand the world as it presents itself to her.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my opinion, anyway, on our obligations as parents.<br/>

un/homeschooler, I am still struggling, and trying to build up the <br/>
matrix for this great adventure - part of which is my own &#39;letting <br/>
go&#39; of all the school-is influences I have carried around for so <br/>
long.  I still hear the niggling voices, and feel comforted (despite <br/>
my best efforts not to) when we do something &#39;schooly&#39;  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on it, though... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
The same way we do that with babies, naming things and explaining them, just <br/>
continues with older kids, with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Language learning continues all our lives.  Much of EVERY &quot;branch of <br/>
knowledge&quot; is just vocabulary.  The names of countries becomes knowledge <br/>
about those countries in SO many instances.  The names of geometric shapes <br/>
and their parts.  The names of different kinds of dogs.  Trees.  Birds.<br/>
<br/>
And so you answer questions (with words, or finding more pictures or video or <br/>
things to touch and smell and take apart) and they show they understand more <br/>
by doing the things, recognizing them the next time, understanding how to use <br/>
them, or talking about them with words.<br/>
<br/>
Things we learn build on and are attached to and connect to other things we <br/>
knew.  With words you get concepts.  Concepts are the building blocks of our <br/>
internal models of the universe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s truly depressing to me is how much I&#39;m learning from unschooling my 6<br/>
year old.  I have 13 years of public education, 4 years of college, and 2 of<br/>
graduate school.  Sheesh, you&#39;d think I&#39;d at least know enough to teach a 6<br/>
year old!  But I don&#39;t.  So we learn together, and have quite a bit of fun<br/>
at it, once Mom gets past her hangups!<br/>
<br/>
I was reading John Taylor Gatto&#39;s Dumbing Us Down again the other day, and I<br/>
think it&#39;s in one of the introductions that John or someone else (David<br/>
Albert?) points out that the body of knowledge is expanding so fast, that<br/>
it&#39;s unreasonable to expect children to learn a set amount of stuff.  But<br/>
that the most important parts are that they learn to think critically, and<br/>
learn to find information when they need it.  I can&#39;t think of a better way<br/>
to teach those two things than by unschooling.<br/>

me. When Casey didn&#39;t know an anwer, she usually knew where to get it. <br/>
(Looking up an answer is always permissable in our games like this. ;-)) If <br/>
there was a geography question she looked on the globe. There was a question <br/>
about who starred in Jumanji and she ran to get her copy of the movie to <br/>
read the jacket cover. She reasoned out a question about the function of red <br/>
blood cells by telling us that she knew white blood cells fight infections. <br/>
So she figured it must be the red ones that carried the oxygen. I was very <br/>
impressed.<br/>
