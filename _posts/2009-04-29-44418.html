<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613790197">I was the one who was ambivalent about TV watching and posted a month or so back about it...just wanted to update:<br/>
<br/>
We decided to get a TV.  Not any old TV, but a fancy, flat-screen, 32 inch one (my husband&#39;s choice, he works for a company that works on TV&#39;s, so I let him make all the decisions about it).  For those considering an upgrade, Costco has a really great price (ours was $427).<br/>
<br/>
Seth, our 3.5 year old, is currently watching PBS&#39;s Create, in which a man is making a ladder.  We&#39;ve not made the decision to get cable,  because I refuse to pay for channels I don&#39;t want.  Who knows, maybe in a year I&#39;ll have changed my mind on that, too...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m realizing more and more just what a great tool a TV is (and I&#39;m finding that even people who watch quite a bit of TV, but are not unschoolers, believe there&#39;s something bad about it, which is weird).  The only problem now is that I&#39;m on the computer a LOT more, which means things that were getting done before, aren&#39;t getting done as much...oops!    <br/>
<br/>
I also spent some time showing Seth how to play video games, and it was a lot of fun!  I usually have a hard time finding something that both he and I love doing together, so perhaps this will be one of those things, and if that&#39;s all we do for hours, how can that be bad?<br/>
<br/>
I continue to read the posts for encouragement on our unschooling/ deschooling path. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One way to look at it is that you&#39;re paying for the ones you want and  <br/>
the others come free :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like with newspapers and magazines. You get the whole thing even  <br/>
if you only read a couple of articles. It&#39;s easier not to feel guilty  <br/>
about not reading the whole thing (and who can with a newspaper!) if  <br/>
you think of it as paying for monthly access to a couple of articles  <br/>
rather than paying for a magazine full of articles. Same with cable.  <br/>
You&#39;re paying for access and with that access you get a slew of  <br/>
channels.<br/>
<br/>
Even of the channels you will watch, you don&#39;t watch them 24/7 even  <br/>
though you&#39;re paying for that. You pick and choose what to watch,  <br/>
when to watch.<br/>

It seems unfair to blame the TV for your increased computer use, but  <br/>
I&#39;m sure you know that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable either, but there seems to be a glitch in thinking  <br/>
here:<br/>
&quot;We&#39;ve not made the decision to get cable, because I refuse to pay for  <br/>
channels I don&#39;t want. Who knows, maybe in a year I&#39;ll have changed my  <br/>
mind on that, too...&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Refuse&quot; is a harsh word.  Getting cable TV is a necessity for people  <br/>
far from broadcast or translators.  In New Mexico lots of people live  <br/>
where they can&#39;t get reception.  We, on the other hand. live in plain  <br/>
view of the mountain that has the TV broadcast towers on it.   My  <br/>
husband is very thrifty, which comes in handy.  He&#39;s kind of techno- <br/>
avoidant (LOTS, considering that he&#39;s an engineer with a computer  <br/>
science degree).  He stalled forever about getting a CD player and  <br/>
still doesn&#39;t have a cellphone.   Because it makes him feel really  <br/>
good to avoid spending money and moving up electronically, I don&#39;t  <br/>
whinge (a word Schuyler loves) about cable.  Maybe I spend as much as  <br/>
we would spend on cable on buying DVDs.  I might even if we had cable.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, cable isn&#39;t paying for every channel.  It&#39;s paying for  <br/>
CHOICES of channels.  If you go to a buffet and eat what you want to  <br/>
eat, do you spend that time thinking about food that might still be  <br/>
there at the end of the shift, and that you don&#39;t like having paid for  <br/>
that food you didn&#39;t eat?   If so, it can&#39;t be good for your  <br/>
digestion.  You paid for the array of choices.<br/>
<br/>
My kids loved PBS shows.  Holly was talking about Zoom yesterday, and  <br/>
singing Zoobilee Zoo a week ago.  She&#39;s 17.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have basic cable even though we live in the Los Angeles Metropolitan <br/>
area and have more over-the-air tv stations than anywhere else in the <br/>
world. The cable tv comes with DVR capability (which is like tivo). <br/>
DVRing is awesome and makes it possible for us to watch what we want so <br/>
much more conveniently than without it. The extra cable channels offer a <br/>
whole lot of interesting random opportunities to sample things we&#39;d <br/>
probably not search out.  Mostly we have them for international soccer <br/>
watching - which my husband and youngest daughter are very very into. We <br/>
don&#39;t pay extra for any &quot;premium&quot; channels like Showtime or HBO, though. <br/>
It is a matter of budgeting, for us. If we had unlimited income, we&#39;d <br/>
get all the premium channels - to have more choices. There are sometimes <br/>
HBO shows someone wants to watch, but we get them on DVD from netflix or <br/>
watch them onlline. Netflix is, for us, a better use of the extra money <br/>
than paying for premium cable channels.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is SO cool, to me, that my kids watch tv with no guilt, that they <br/>
really enjoy it so much. Rosie was telling me her plans for the summer <br/>
and she included a day-per-week of lots of tv-watching right in there <br/>
with all the other things she wants to do - with great eagerness and <br/>
enthusiasm. She has a list of shows she wants to watch that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
have time for, right now.<br/>
