&lt;&lt; But, I still think the choice to stay at home is denigrated--it&#39;s a choice,<br/>
<br/>
but not such a good one. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re hanging with people who think it&#39;s not good, find better friends.<br/>
Or find people who know the value of it.<br/>
<br/>
Change can&#39;t be whole and complete or we wouldn&#39;t recognize the place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I caught a tremendous amount of flack as a grad<br/>
<br/>
student because I was not going into debt to put my babies in childcare.<br/>
<br/>
Another female grad student with kids was told not to apply for an award<br/>
<br/>
because it was for &quot;serious dissertating students only,&quot; a comment that did<br/>
<br/>
not, apparently, apply to the 3 male grad students with toddlers and infants<br/>
<br/>
at home. I was told point blank that I should have waited to have children<br/>
<br/>
until after I had tenure; being a mother was secondary to a career.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Flak.<br/>
Spelling moment, because I know you write a lot and probably care. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
We hear it said a lot, but don&#39;t see it written as much.<br/>
<br/>
I see that it&#39;s not fair that dads are considered more unbounded than <br/>
mothers, but as a mother do you think the dad at home is just as good in every way as <br/>
the mom at home?  I don&#39;t.   The balancing circumstance had better be REALLY <br/>
really good for a nursing mom to leave a baby, or to wean a baby so that <br/>
others can keep it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was<br/>
<br/>
also told point blank that I should not limit my job search geographically<br/>
<br/>
for my husband because after all we could end up divorced and I&#39;d have<br/>
<br/>
sacrificed my career to live in the backwoods with someone else.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well isn&#39;t that feminism gone wild, to say &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re married but your <br/>
career should be your own true love&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would, apparently, be a much stronger female rolganized sports.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And leaving them with the role models of bus drivers, teachers, and <br/>
hamburger-stand service folk.  Another small pool of women, and not that they aren&#39;t <br/>
working hard but will the kids REALLY see the Entire World of Possibility from <br/>
school?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think the second wave feminism<br/>
<br/>
of the &#39;60s and &#39;70s did a really great job of carving out a certain kind of<br/>
<br/>
equality in the male-dominated marketplace, but it did so based on a male<br/>
<br/>
model of work that left families in the dust or at least required them to be<br/>
<br/>
invisible and undemanding.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Since the 60&#39;s, cottage industry has been making a comeback, though (at least <br/>
where I am).   It&#39;s pretty highly respected here for someone to do furniture <br/>
or pottery or welding or whatever from home, and not necessarily have a shop <br/>
and warehouse where they go.  (But New Mexico isn&#39;t real in lots of ways, and <br/>
certainly isn&#39;t American mainstream overall.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would like<br/>
<br/>
to see corporate culture become more family-friendly, allowing both men and<br/>
<br/>
women the time, space and support they need to put their families first.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Paternity leave is no longer a fantasy or a joke.<br/>
Personal time, same.<br/>
Family counselling benefits (to prevent divorce it seemed, three emergency <br/>
counselling visits) were one of the benefits Keith had when he went to work for <br/>
Sperry before Kirby was born.  Sperry became Honeywell, benefits change from <br/>
time to time, but they seem family oriented to me.<br/>
<br/>
Things are changing.<br/>
<br/>
In the current, August 9, Newsweek, Anna Quindlen has a wonderful column <br/>
about how liberalism has chnaged the country.  It&#39;s worth reading.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
if they put those online or not.   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We liberals have been shamed into thinking our vision failed, when in fact <br/>
it has simply been absorbed ito the national self-potrait.  From the idea that <br/>
a woman ought to have the same legal rights as her male counterparts to the <br/>
belief that workers should count on being safe from hazardous conditions, <br/>
formerly liberal principles have become bedrock democracy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Around 1985 a young female friend of ours came over for help on an essay for <br/>
college.  She had a list of options, and one was to tell how feminism helped <br/>
her life, or how it had not.  She was going to write about how the feminist <br/>
movement had had no effect on her life.    Keith, who had not long before that <br/>
been a sexist pigboy from a family of all boys in a military/redneck town didn&#39;t <br/>
even glance at me before saying, &quot;What!?  You need to write how it DID make <br/>
your life better.&quot;   And he went on sensibly about her being at the university, <br/>
not being pressured to marry, not being limited to nursing or elementary <br/>
education, and so forth.    She wrote the pro-feminism essay.<br/>
<br/>
Someone several years ago came into a discussion like this one (AOL days I <br/>
think) and said the 60&#39;s were dead and had had no effect.   How nutso.  How <br/>
blind.   People can buy health food easily in most parts of the country.   I&#39;m one <br/>
mile from a Keller&#39;s farm store, which pre-dates the hippies and sells <br/>
organic meats (and other cool stuff), less than a quarter mile from a Wild Oats and <br/>
a Keva Juice in the same little mall, across the street from an Ayurvedic <br/>
medicine teaching facility, two blocks from an Ayurvedic vegan restaurant.   <br/>
There&#39;s a shop across the main road from my house (a few hundred yards) that sells <br/>
supplies for wiccans, and nobody has so much as egged their windows.<br/>
<br/>
People wear their hair short or long as they wish, with little flak or <br/>
pressure.   Boys (and men) wear beards if they want to, and don&#39;t if they don&#39;t want <br/>
to.   Girls (and women) can wear long skirts, short skirts, or pants.  They <br/>
can dress like boys if they want to, and few people say a word.<br/>
<br/>
Try that in the 50s.<br/>
Try that in the 60s!   <br/>
<br/>
Late 60s, young men with long hair were in danger of being held down by <br/>
rednecks and shaved.  Young women who dared to wear mini-skirt or to go braless had <br/>
that brought up in court, if she were molested, as evidence that she had <br/>
&quot;asked for it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Try THAT in the early 21st century, and be laughed out of the legal <br/>
profession.<br/>
<br/>
When change comes that steadily and solidly, it hardly shows, but by looking <br/>
back forty or fifty years you see the huge speed at which things changed.<br/>

I have found people who value it through unschooling, this list, LLL, soon<br/>
the Live and Learn Conference--and that makes a huge difference. I have been<br/>
working to surround myself with like minded people because it keeps me from<br/>
feeling like such a freak. *g*<br/>

<br/>
See, what I&#39;m looking for is not an either mom or dad kind of set up. I<br/>
think that babies benefit hugely, as do fathers and families, when the<br/>
father is just as involved in child rearing and care as the mom. That means<br/>
the dad taking care of and bonding with the baby, carrying and cosleeping,<br/>
skin to skin contact--none of which precludes the mom nursing and practicing<br/>
all of these things as well. Babies benefit hugely from a close relationship<br/>
with both parents, and I think this kind of relationship makes dad a kinder,<br/>
gentler parent in the long run. You&#39;re right that I think the mom is<br/>
paramount, but I think the dads are far more important than they&#39;ve<br/>
generally been.<br/>
<br/>
When we were in grad school, dh used to care for the babies while I was<br/>
teaching and doing office hours. This was one to two hour stretches, in<br/>
between nursings, either at home or in his lab. He helped deliver them,<br/>
carried them, nurtured and cared for them in a far more active way than most<br/>
fathers, even though he never got to give them a bottle. Attachment<br/>
parenting works best, in my opinion, when both parents practice it, which<br/>
requires more physical presence from fathers than most jobs allow.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m looking for shorter work weeks, more vacation time, flexible hours<br/>
for BOTH parents, enabling families to be TOGETHER more and both parents to<br/>
be primary caregivers. I&#39;m looking for families to come first in real life,<br/>
not just in empty political rhetoric that furthers a particular corporate<br/>
agenda that ultimately undermines real families.<br/>

Yes, things are changing. The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) was a huge<br/>
step in the right direction, though there are still lots of loopholes and<br/>
shortfalls.** Compared to countries like Sweden, however, America lags far<br/>
behind--just google it. Sweden offers 18 months of parental leave at 80%<br/>
salary, and another source cites up to 96 weeks. Australia and New Zealand<br/>
offer up to 52 weeks, Canada and Denmark 50 weeks, Italy 47, Finland 44, UK<br/>
40 (not clear what pay percentage). America offers 6 weeks paid leave and up<br/>
to 6 months, or 24 weeks, unpaid at some companies; the FMLA only offers 12<br/>
weeks UNPAID and that only in certain circumstances.** In France every<br/>
single worker is guaranteed 5 weeks vacation every year, and the country<br/>
even subsidizes vacations for low income families so they get to go<br/>
somewhere. In America most workers get 2 weeks vacation a year, many of whom<br/>
can&#39;t even schedule the time off because they&#39;re too busy or they&#39;ve used it<br/>
up staying at home with sick children or covering for daycare closings.<br/>
That&#39;s not even touching upon the health care issue and how many families,<br/>
or even just children, are uninsured and without access to basic medical and<br/>
preventative care. Yes, things are changing, but they still have a ways to<br/>
go for families.<br/>

I think one of the biggest ways things are changing is through cottage<br/>
industry, consulting and free agents. That&#39;s why I think Daniel Pink&#39;s book<br/>
_Free Agent Nation_ is so fascinating and so important. As workers retake<br/>
control over their own labor, they are retaking control over their families<br/>
as well, which is why writing that book led Pink to discover homeschooling<br/>
generally and unschooling in particular. In his speech at a recent Maryland<br/>
homeschooler&#39;s conference, he specifically stated that what he is really<br/>
calling free agent education is UNschooling, not homeschooling. I think<br/>
America is inching in the right direction, and I really feel that<br/>
unschoolers are on the cutting edge of that change. I&#39;m excited, energized<br/>
and optimistic about the possibilities unschooling has to offer--I think we<br/>
are living a big part of the change.<br/>

**Many employers are required by federal law to allow their employees (both<br/>
men and women) 12 weeks of unpaid family leave after the birth or adoption<br/>
of a child under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). At the end of your<br/>
leave, your employer must allow you to return to your job or a similar job<br/>
with the same salary, benefits, working conditions, and seniority. You are<br/>
among the 60 percent of U.S. workers who are eligible if you meet both of<br/>
the following conditions:<br/>
. You work for the federal government, a state or local government, or any<br/>
company that has 50 or more employees working within 75 miles of your<br/>
workplace<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
. You have worked for your employer for at least 12 months and for at least<br/>
1,250 hours during the previous year (which comes out to 25 hours per week<br/>
for 50 weeks)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are a few exceptions: Your employer can deny you this leave if you&#39;re<br/>
in the highest paid 10 percent of wage earners at your company and your<br/>
employer can show that your absence would cause substantial economic harm to<br/>
the organization. In this case, your employer isn&#39;t required to keep your<br/>
job open for you. Another exception is if you and your partner both work for<br/>
the same company. In this case, you&#39;re only entitled to a combined 12 weeks<br/>
of parental leave between the two of you. Even if you&#39;re not eligible under<br/>
the FMLA, you may still be eligible for leave under your state&#39;s provisions,<br/>
which are usually more generous than the FMLA, or under your company&#39;s<br/>
policy.<br/>

It is also split so that the first 6 months (I think) is maternal leave and the rest is parental, availible to either parent and could be worked I think so that the mom could take her maternal leave and the dad the parental leave at the same time. I took both with Harry so I had the year. I think the parental leave is availible to adoptive parents as well though I&#39;m not sure of the maternal leave. I do think the rate should be much higher because I saw many low income friends who could only afford a month or so off work before having to go back...But I know we have it pretty good up here.<br/>
