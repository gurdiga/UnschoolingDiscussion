<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831799139">I&#39;m not sure what a &quot;covering&quot; school is, but I know that there is a sister<br/>
Sudbury Valley School in Florida that has few requirements (you have to show<br/>
up by 11:00am and stay for at least four hours). The one we visited in<br/>
Massachusetts was very fun, completely open in every way (except the above<br/>
requirement) and wasn&#39;t expensive relative to other private schools. I don&#39;t<br/>
have time to look it up right now, but wanted to give you info in case you<br/>
wanted to link it.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501992143">Have you tried Florida Unschoolers?  They may not be accepting new  members <br/>
but it&#39;s worth a try.  We belong and the requirements are  minimal.  If they <br/>
are not accepting new members, perhaps Nance (the lady in  charge) can point you <br/>
in the right direction.  Go here for the contact  info: <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862279822">Thanks, Wendy.  That looks like just the thing.  I don&#39;t live in  Florida, <br/>
but my friend does, and she has had her fill of religious covering  schools.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks to everyone else who replied, too.<br/>
