<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052724285">I love Keith Devlin&#39;s writing and his radio program - I take a lot of  <br/>
what I talk about at conferences from him.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you all might enjoy his ideas, even though you&#39;re not doing a  <br/>
&quot;curriculum.&quot;<br/>

Math + Rigor = College<br/>
According to the recent US Department of Education Report Mathematics  <br/>
Equals Opportunity, completion of a rigorous program of mathematics at  <br/>
high school pays huge dividends when it comes time to enter college,  <br/>
regardless of the course of study pursued at college level.<br/>
Does this provide support for the back-to-basics movement? Not at all.  <br/>
At least, not at all if by &quot;basics&quot; you mean the ability to perform  <br/>
mental arithmetic or do long division. The message in the DOE report is  <br/>
that, for most people, when it comes to high school math, it&#39;s not what  <br/>
you learn that counts, it&#39;s the mental skills you develop.<br/>
<br/>
When the automobile became widely available, skill at riding a horse  <br/>
was replaced by skill at driving a car. Likewise, in the age of the  <br/>
pocket calculator and the electronic computer, computational skill is  <br/>
no longer necessary. We need other abilities. Training students to be a  <br/>
poor imitation of a $30 calculator is a waste of time for both teacher  <br/>
and students.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I say this kind of thing, I am invariably bombarded with  <br/>
accusations that I am advocating a lowering of standards. Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
Using -- I mean using properly -- calculators and computers does not  <br/>
represent a reduction in skill or the need for accuracy. On the  <br/>
contrary, successful use of today&#39;s computational aids requires far  <br/>
greater mathematical skill, and much more mathematical insight, than we  <br/>
old timers had to master to get our sums right.<br/>
<br/>
Those who claim that use of computational aids and an increased  <br/>
emphasis on conceptual understanding lead to lower standards are way  <br/>
off target. In my experience, the only thing that leads to lower  <br/>
standards is a lowering of standards. And you can lower standards just  <br/>
as easily with an abacus as with the latest Pentium computer.<br/>
<br/>
Today we live in a society that is largely shaped by mathematics --  <br/>
though by one of life&#39;s paradoxes, the more important mathematics has  <br/>
become in our lives, the more it has disappeared into the background.  <br/>
You would not know it unless you looked closely, but large parts of  <br/>
modern communications, transport, medicine, entertainment, sport,  <br/>
financial trading, and even law enforcement, all make heavy use of,  <br/>
often sophisticated mathematics. In the industrial age, we burned  <br/>
fossil fuels to drive the engines of society. In the information age,  <br/>
the fuel we burn is mathematics. The mathematics involved is so  <br/>
specialized that we cannot hope to teach it in our schools. What we can  <br/>
-- and should -- do is make sure our children are prepared to acquire,  <br/>
quickly and efficiently, what particular math skills they require when  <br/>
the time comes.<br/>
<br/>
The bulk of that basic skill set on which each individual can build in  <br/>
later life has little to do with numbers or arithmetic. The industrial  <br/>
age was an age of number and arithmetic. The information age is quite  <br/>
different. The mathematics used today is the mathematics of abstract  <br/>
patterns, relationships, and structures. As we continue to revise our  <br/>
curriculum for the high school math class of the next millennium, we  <br/>
have to accept the fact that the mathematics we teach today&#39;s students  <br/>
will not be (at least, should not be) the same as their parents  <br/>
learned. But that does not make it easier or less rigorous. Quite the  <br/>
opposite.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of arithmetic, getting the right answer to a long division  <br/>
problem using pencil and paper is no more important to today&#39;s new  <br/>
citizen than being able to use a horse-drawn plow. On the other hand,  <br/>
getting the right answer to a problem using a powerful calculator or a  <br/>
computer can be crucially important. It&#39;s also much harder. It&#39;s not  <br/>
the same problem the student is solving, of course. That&#39;s why the math  <br/>
curriculum has to change. The need for accurate, rigorous, precise  <br/>
logical thinking is more important to more people today than at any  <br/>
time in history. To try to achieve that ability by harking back to the  <br/>
mathematics taught a half century ago, as continues to happen in states  <br/>
across the nation, will surely fail with today&#39;s students. They -- and  <br/>
we -- deserve better.<br/>

Keith Devlin ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:devlin@...">devlin@...</a>) is Dean of Science at Saint  <br/>
Mary&#39;s College of California, in Moraga, California, and a Senior  <br/>
Researcher at Stanford University. A regular commentator on mathematics  <br/>
issues for National Public Radio, he has just finished work on a  <br/>
six-part television series and accompanying book called Life By the  <br/>
Numbers, which set out to show how mathematics is used in sports,  <br/>
entertainment, communications, transport, business, in fact, in all  <br/>
walks of life, both work and play. Hosted by movie star Danny Glover,  <br/>
Life By the Numbers will air nationwide on PBS in April. The book will  <br/>
be published at the same time.</div>
