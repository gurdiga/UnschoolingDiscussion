<br/>
&quot;One thing that has always bugged me, and I&#39;m sure it does most of you, is<br/>
to sit down at the dinner table only to be interrupted by a phone call from<br/>
a telemarketer. I decided, on one such occasion, to try to be as irritating<br/>
as they were to me. The call was from AT&T and it went something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Me: Hello.<br/>
AT&T: Hello, this is AT&T...<br/>
Me: Is this AT&T?<br/>
AT&T: Yes, this is AT&T...<br/>
Me: This is AT&T?<br/>
AT&T: Yes. This is AT&T...<br/>
Me: Is this AT&T?<br/>
AT&T: YES! This is AT&T, may I speak to Mr. Byron please?<br/>
Me: May I ask who is calling?<br/>
AT&T: This is AT&T.<br/>
Me: OK, hold on.<br/>
At this point I put the phone down for a solid 5 minutes thinking that,<br/>
surely, this person would have hung up the phone. Much to my surprise, when<br/>
I picked up the receiver, they were still waiting.<br/>
Me: Hello?<br/>
AT&T: Is this Mr. Byron?<br/>
Me: May I ask who is calling please?<br/>
AT&T: Yes, this is AT&T...<br/>
Me: Is this AT&T?<br/>
AT&T: Yes, this is AT&T...<br/>
Me: This is AT&T?<br/>
AT&T: Yes, is this Mr. Byron?<br/>
Me: Yes, is this AT&T?<br/>
AT&T: Yes, sir.<br/>
Me: The phone company?<br/>
AT&T: Yes, sir.<br/>
Me: I thought you said this was AT&T.<br/>
AT&T: Yes sir, we are a phone company.<br/>
Me: I already have a phone.<br/>
AT&T: We aren&#39;t selling phones today, Mr. Byron.<br/>
Me: Well, whatever it is, I&#39;m really not interested but thanks for calling.<br/>
When you are not interested in something, I don&#39;t think you can express<br/>
yourself any plainer than by saying, &quot;I&#39;m really not interested&quot;, but this<br/>
lady was persistent.<br/>
AT&T: Mr. Byron, we would like to offer you 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a<br/>
day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.   Now, I am sure she meant she was<br/>
offering a &quot;rate&quot; of 10 cents a minute but she at no time used the word<br/>
rate. I could clearly see that it was time to whip out the trusty old<br/>
calculator and do a little ciphering.<br/>
Me: Now, that&#39;s 10 cents a minute 24 hours a day?<br/>
AT&T: (getting a little excited at this point by my interest) Yes, sir,<br/>
that&#39;s right! 24 hours a day!<br/>
Me: 7 days a week?<br/>
AT&T: That&#39;s right.<br/>
Me: 365 days a year?<br/>
AT&T: Yes, sir.<br/>
Me: I am definitely interested in that! Wow!!! That&#39;s amazing!<br/>
AT&T: We think so!<br/>
Me: That&#39;s quite a sum of money!<br/>
AT&T: Yes, sir, it&#39;s amazing how it adds up.<br/>
Me: OK, so will you send me checks weekly, monthly or just one big one at<br/>
the end of the year for the full $52,560, and if you send an annual check,<br/>
can I get a cash advance?<br/>
AT&T: Excuse me?<br/>
Me: You know, the 10 cents a minute.<br/>
AT&T: What are you talking about?<br/>
Me: You said you&#39;d give me 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,<br/>
365 days a year. That comes to $144 per day, $1008 per week and $52,560 per<br/>
year. I&#39;m just interested in knowing how you will be making payment.<br/>
AT&T: Oh, no, sir. I didn&#39;t mean we&#39;d be paying you. You pay us 10 cents a<br/>
minute.<br/>
Me: Wait a minute here!!! Didn&#39;t you say you&#39;d give me 10 cents a minute.<br/>
Are you sure this is AT&T?<br/>
AT&T: Well, yes, this is AT&T, sir, but......<br/>
Me: But nothing. How do you figure that by saying that you&#39;ll give me 10<br/>
cents a minute that I&#39;ll give you 10 cents a minute? Is this some kind of<br/>
subliminal telemarketing scheme? I&#39;ve read about things like this in the<br/>
Enquirer, you know. Don&#39;t use your alien brainwashing techniques on me.<br/>
AT&T: No, sir, we are offering 10 cents a minute for.....<br/>
Me: THERE YOU GO AGAIN! Can I speak to a supervisor please!<br/>
AT&T: Sir, I don&#39;t think that is necessary.<br/>
Me: Sure! You say that now! What happens later?<br/>
AT&T: What?<br/>
Me: I insist on speaking to a supervisor!<br/>
AT&T: Yes, Mr. Byron. Please hold.<br/>
So now AT&T has me on hold and my supper is getting cold. I begin to eat<br/>
while I&#39;m waiting for a supervisor. After a wait of a few minutes and while<br/>
I have a mouth full of food:<br/>
Supervisor: Mr. Byron?<br/>
Me: Yeth?<br/>
Supervisor: I understand you are not quite understanding our 10 cents a<br/>
minute program.<br/>
Me: Id thish Ath Teeth & Teeth?<br/>
Supervisor: Yes, sir, it sure is.<br/>
I had to swallow before I choked on my food. It was all I could do to<br/>
suppress my laughter and I had to be careful not to produce a snort.<br/>
 Me: No, actually, I was just waiting for someone to get back to me so that<br/>
I could sign up for the plan.<br/>
Supervisor: OK, no problem, I&#39;ll transfer you back to the person who was<br/>
helping you.<br/>
Me: Thank you.<br/>
I was on hold once again and was getting really hungry. I needed to end this<br/>
conversation. Suddenly, there was an aggravated but polite voice at the<br/>
other end of the phone.<br/>
AT&T: Hello, Mr. Byron, I understand that you are interested in signing up<br/>
for our plan?<br/>
Me: Do you have that friends and family thing because you can never have<br/>
enough friends and I&#39;m an only child and I&#39;d really like to have a little<br/>
brother...<br/>
