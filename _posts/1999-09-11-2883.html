  I LOVED your comments and thoughts on religion and homeschooling. I think <br/>
that this &quot;natural approach&quot; is one which all children use, toward religion <br/>
as well as education, and we would be wise to learn from them.<br/>
Your quote from John Woolman really struck a chord with me...I printed it out <br/>
a pasted it inside my personal journal so that I might remember it.<br/>
  I also agree with the comments made that unschooling and Christian living <br/>
CAN go hand-in-hand. We model learning to our children, why not model our <br/>
faith? Lead by example, right?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for your kind remarks.  In the late 19th/early 20th century, &quot;The<br/>
Journal of John Woolman&quot; was considered such essential reading for<br/>
understanding American history that it was the first book (along with<br/>
Ben Franklin&#39;s Diary) to be published in the Harvard Classics Series.<br/>
History was NOT always taught as a series of names of generals, battles,<br/>
and dates, and because of the journal nature of Woolman&#39;s work, it<br/>
provides a perfect take-off point for dialogue about values as they<br/>
pertained to pre-Revolutionary America.  I highly recommend it -- not so<br/>
much for kids (though of course if they express interest, go for it!)<br/>
but for parents trying to re-energize interest in history for<br/>
themselves!<br/>

I did too, David.  I think it&#39;s where I&#39;m headed, but it&#39;s taking me a long <br/>
time to get there.  Thanks for a great post!<br/>

&gt; Thanks. Much appreciate it. It&#39;s always nice to know that others can<br/>
&gt; share the direction, especially when the road gets hard!<br/>
