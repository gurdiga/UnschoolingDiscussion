<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593388075">&lt;The class is an hour, but seems to dominate an entire<br/>
afternoon by the time we get ready to go and include the 40 minute round<br/>
trip drive.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is our lives.  We live in a small village that is 15-25 miles away from any<br/>
town.  My dd is still going to kindergarten M-W-F 20 miles from home.  (This will<br/>
be her last yr. and I refuse to put her on the bus at 7:00 am for a 50 min. bus<br/>
ride.)  All we are involved in this year is cub scouts/boy scouts and of course<br/>
they are in different towns.  Some days I drive 100-180 miles round trip just doing<br/>
the necessities.  (Which include getting out of the house for MY sanity!)  Not to<br/>
mention it eats up a whole afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else in this situation?  I&#39;ve wanted to move back to the city now for 2<br/>
years and finally my husband is considering it.  (He commutes there everyday<br/>
anyway.)  But, we moved out here in no-man&#39;s land because we could get a huge<br/>
house, 1/2 acre for next to nothing.  (But, it was also when the kids were small<br/>
and not involved in things.)  If we move, it&#39;ll be a smaller house for twice the<br/>
house payment.  But, everything we need, library, pool, groceries, church, etc.<br/>
will be within a five mile radius.  Very appealing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061334566">We live a 10 minute drive to town.  Just this one activity is at the<br/>
opposite end of town from where we live.  I have two homeschooling<br/>
friends who live out of town.  One family (are you still out there<br/>
Julie?) seems to enjoy their country life, with land for a big garden,<br/>
etc.  The other family has said she is seriously considering moving into<br/>
town, since she seems to be in town so often anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I live in the suburbs.  My neighborhood is nice for having lots of<br/>
children and only local traffic, so kids really do play in the streets<br/>
around here.  But sometimes I dream of living really in town, where I<br/>
could walk to the library, park, etc.  Ah, the grass is often greener...<br/>

  We are Suzy. I am 20 min-45min from everywhere we go.  I am 30 min from<br/>
the grocery store.  At times, we carschool.  I bring alon so many snacks<br/>
that the car is often called Mom&#39;s Cafe on Wheels!  My definition of a<br/>
reasonable distance to drive has changed in the past 6 yrs of hsing.  Now if<br/>
we really want to do something, and it works for our interests and schedule,<br/>
my attitude is that it just sounds far!!!  Books on tape are great for our<br/>
longer excursions!!<br/>
