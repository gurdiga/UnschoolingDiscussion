<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730649360">****Ooooooh, yeah.  I&#39;ve had quite a few of these moments while growing up. <br/>
I didn&#39;t like to know what my xmas gifts were ahead of time and was<br/>
never the kid trying to find the stash and see what I was getting.<br/>
Knowing this, my mom would still SHOW me what she picked out and then<br/>
ASK me if I liked it.  Thinking that if I answered honestly that she&#39;d<br/>
still have plenty of time to return/exchange it that we&#39;d all be happy.****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH THIS WAS ME!!!  I left off the last sentence because THAT wsn&#39;t me, but <br/>
the above was SO me!  Every year before birthdays and Christmas, the kids <br/>
and I make a big day of wish lists.  I grab pen and paper and we go wishing. <br/>
  For years, I got every item on the list.  It didn&#39;t take long for them to <br/>
sulk if something was missing.  Last year, I decided to chuck the list.  We <br/>
still go wishing but I leave the list at home now.  I told everyone in my <br/>
family to buy whatever they wanted my children to have.   wouldn&#39;t even give <br/>
them ideas.  Christmas was AMAZING!!!  The kids were so excited and <br/>
surprised at what they got.  I didn&#39;t hear ONE sulk.  My 6 year old even <br/>
asked me if she could have a &quot;surprise&quot; birthday this year.  Not the typical <br/>
surprise, we&#39;re all here, but the kind without lists.  Her birthday is in 2 <br/>
weeks and she told me she doesn&#39;t even want to go wishing because she wants <br/>
EVERYTHING to be something special we all pick for her.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny that we can&#39;t see how much our desire to please our kids truly <br/>
doesn&#39;t please them afterall.<br/>
