<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044283373">I just wanted to jump in here, before this topic disappears, and mention <br/>
my kids&#39; current favorite book, &quot;The BFG&quot; , by Roald Dahl--or anything <br/>
by him, really. We love looking in the sky for &quot;bellyhoppers&quot; .<br/>
<br/>
  For younger kids (five or so, but my 8-year-old also loved it) there&#39;s <br/>
&quot;The Teddy Robinson Storybook&quot;, by Jane G. Robinson. It was first <br/>
published in the 50&#39;s. i think, but I got it from Chinaberry.com.<br/>
<br/>
(I will write a &quot;proper&quot; introduction soon--unless I just jump in again <br/>
when the topic is too tempting!)<br/>
