Did you get alot out of that book?<br/>
 <br/>
I ordered it in August,  from Amazon and they finally told me in late September they couldn&#39;t get it.    I was thinking about checking out Fun books to see if they carried it.           <br/>
 <br/>
If its worth it I&#39;m going to order it.<br/>

sure I am going to get much out of the book. That way, if I don&#39;t get anything<br/>
out of it, I am not out any money. :o) And if I do think that I will refer to<br/>
it again, then I can always order it. And sometimes I have found that I get<br/>
a lot out of it, but that I probably would not need to read it again...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411183261">I have that book too.  I read some of it to my dh (because he doesn&#39;t <br/>
read books for himself).  He said that his passion is computers and <br/>
video games.  If he quit his job, then he couldn&#39;t afford the game <br/>
cube and the x-box or parts to build his own computer.  He hates his <br/>
job, but he says he&#39;ll stick it out because he can retire when he&#39;s <br/>
50 (a mere 18 years away...sigh...)<br/>
<br/>
Another good book along the same lines is called Possum Living.  Dh <br/>
said he would rather go to a job he hates than do half of the work <br/>
that the people in that book do to keep themselves fed.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127655824">I&#39;ve often thought that what we could do is work things out so that <br/>
our kids can unjob if they want to.  They will always have their <br/>
bedrooms and something to eat in this house.  We&#39;ll always pay for <br/>
the electricity and the cable and the water, etc.  So they really <br/>
only need to work if they want more than we can honestly afford to <br/>

Do they actually buy new books for you?  I am a regular,  and my husband is on the library board which OKs purchases,   but I know funds are limited.   They get grants for books but I think they are very mainstream books.   Like the top selling ones.<br/>
 <br/>
Or do you mean requesting books from other libraries?<br/>
 <br/>
Because when I do the request it goes to all libraries in the system.  And those libraries don&#39;t have them either.<br/>
 <br/>
I can buy a few,  but I try to be selective,   otherwise,  you know what we were talking about before,     the  hundreds of dollars in book store bills,   that tends to be me and I won&#39;t be in the unjobbing world quick enough if I keep doing that.

Yeah, I ask. They buy. But maybe there&#39;s a lot of $$ in our county library. <br/>
They&#39;ve ordered Gatto&#39;s books, The Teenage Lib Handbook (directly from <br/>
Grace). A few Holt&#39;s they didn&#39;t have. Some dog breed and training books I <br/>
requested. Some beekeeping books. We haven&#39;t gotten Mary Griffith&#39;s books <br/>
yet, but I asked again. But I bought it myself.<br/>

But if there are a lot of requests for homeschooling books, I guess they&#39;re <br/>
considerd &quot;top-sellers&quot;! &lt;G&gt; I have two other friends that request the same <br/>
books---so maybe they need more than one request? Depends on the library <br/>
maybe. I&#39;ve had NO trouble getting in homeschooling books---maybe because I&#39;m <br/>
so active/vocal in homeschooling and I&#39;m in the library 2-3 times a week? <br/>
<br/>
I LOVE our library!<br/>

but the kids had been with various nannies.  They were all so happy to see <br/>
me, talking about my ankle, etc.  I usually search the catalogue on line and <br/>
go in with a list, but add and delete as I go.  I was amazed that my nanny <br/>

out of their network, they charge a $3 fee, but can still get it usually.  I <br/>
noticed yesterday they had a book with a &quot;new&quot; sticker on it that we had <br/>
requested from interlibrary loan and mentioned it to the librarian.  She read <br/>
it when it came in and decided her children&#39;s section should purchase it.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, they were a bit put off by Nathan&#39;s Swan Lake obsession.  <br/>
We were the only ones in there for a while and we got some big kid ballet <br/>
books, which he loved.  Then he started dancing around.  They don&#39;t mind <br/>
noise, I think they were just put off by the boys and ballet thing.  One of <br/>
the ladies said &quot;Well, it can&#39;t hurt him.&quot;  As if she has trying to convince <br/>

I&#39;d request the unjobbing book or if you have to buy it, go used from Amazon.<br/>

Yeah, I ask. They buy. But maybe there&#39;s a lot of $$ in our county library. <br/>
They&#39;ve ordered Gatto&#39;s books, The Teenage Lib Handbook (directly from <br/>
Grace). A few Holt&#39;s they didn&#39;t have. Some dog breed and training books I <br/>
requested. Some beekeeping books. We haven&#39;t gotten Mary Griffith&#39;s books <br/>
yet, but I asked again. But I bought it myself.<br/>

You guys are lucky,   our library is connected with other  libraries in our region, northern Minnesota,  but these are very conservative IMO,  and a bit behind sometimes,   except for those &#39;best&#39; sellers.   They have all the new fiction but nonfiction would be another thing.   For example,  I couldn&#39;t get The Continuum Concept, so I ordered that one.     If I could be connected up with Minnespolis/St. Paul I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t have a problem.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if I dare go through amazon again with that book,    maybe I&#39;d have a better chance going through the used side?      The thing with that is that usually I end up spending just as much with shipping,   I&#39;ll price both,  there and FUN books.<br/>
