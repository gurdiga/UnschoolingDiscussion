<div id="ygrps-yiv-133947603">Hi Katy,<br/>
<br/>
After reading some of the other posts,  I would like<br/>
to add that, <br/>
the best  sources of legal information will come from<br/>
those <br/>
in-the-know in your state, as well as experienced<br/>
online sources.<br/>
<br/>
Here are 2 of the best:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AHSA-USA/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AHSA-USA/</a><br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHEN-LegClearinghouse/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NHEN-LegClearinghouse/</a><br/>
<br/>
I would caution you not to rely on an attorney without<br/>
experience <br/>
in advocating for homeschoolers.  There may be too<br/>
much of a <br/>
learning curve for them to overcome.  You need<br/>
knowledgeable <br/>
And right-now.  The sources above will supply you with<br/>
both.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, just as you don&#39;t want to invite in authorities<br/>
without a <br/>
warrant, likewise, I would not offer anything beyond<br/>
that which <br/>
proves you&#39;re legal and that your child is healthy.<br/>
<br/>
CPS has no business evaluating your records.  Should<br/>
they do <br/>
so and decide that they aren&#39;t sufficient, then<br/>
another Pandora&#39;s <br/>
box could be opened.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you stick to the basics; refuting the charges being<br/>
investigated, <br/>
and supplying  enough verification to negate the<br/>
potential of a <br/>
warrant being issued, you should come out of this OK.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing: exhibitng the posture of a secure,<br/>
comitted, <br/>
intelligent parent and &quot;educator&quot;  will work in your<br/>
favor. <br/>
<br/>
Knowing the law, being able to properly refer to the<br/>
passages <br/>
that pertain to you, as well as rattling off a list of<br/>
the <br/>
organizations, activities and &quot;enrichment<br/>
opportunities&quot; from <br/>
which your son benefits  in his individualized<br/>
educational plan ... <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you get the message.   Speaking as a teacher<br/>
at a <br/>
parent-teacher conference  would,  will further your<br/>
image as a <br/>
competent mother-teacher to the bureaucratic powers<br/>
that be.  <br/>
When in Rome ...<br/>
<br/>
Be brave and confident.<br/>

 <br/>
That&#39;s all true.<br/>
It maybe be that if she agreed for them to come back, they&#39;re coming back,  <br/>
though.<br/>
Depends on the state, the county, whether she signed something maybe.  <br/>
 <br/>
I would DEFINITELY ask for the records in advance.  There might be  something <br/>
in there that lets you know who reported it, and it&#39;s possible that  would <br/>
help.  If it&#39;s an ex-anything (boyfriend, in law, husband, best  friend) it <br/>
could be harrassment, and all KINDS of government workers are  familiar with being <br/>
used as pawns in other people&#39;s personal vendettas, and they  don&#39;t like it <br/>
any.  <br/>
 <br/>
If it&#39;s a neighbor just being irritated that kids are there in the daytime,  <br/>
that&#39;s a different kind of complaint again.  <br/>
 <br/>
The family I know best who got visits didn&#39;t get them for  homeschooling.  <br/>
They had adopted three kids and so they were already a case  file with agencies. <br/>
 Homeschooling was just one more thing for them to ask  about.<br/>
