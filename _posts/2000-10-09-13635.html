<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745408635">Hi once again all,<br/>
<br/>
So much news and so little time....<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a story that appeared a couple days ago in a major Japanese paper <br/>
on the increasing numbers of families pulling out of the public school <br/>
system in Japan, and their reasons for doing so.<br/>
<br/>
For those who would like to grasp the bigger picture of the current <br/>
&quot;education crisis&quot; in Japan, this rather long article also offers some <br/>
good background on how dumbing down, cram schools (known as *juku*) and <br/>
breakdown of order in classrooms (*gakkyu hokai*) fit into this scenario. <br/>
<br/>

BOREDOM MAIN REASON FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL EXODUS<br/>
<br/>
Giving up time to play and sleep is worth it for a chance<br/>
to have fun while learning, say children and parents alike.<br/>
<br/>
Asahi Shimbun<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When children fall behind at school, it&#39;s not necessarily because the <br/>
work is too hard for them. Sometimes it&#39;s just the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
This year, the Ministry of Education announced plans to introduce a <br/>
lighter curriculum in public schools by 2002 after it received complaints <br/>
from parents and others that the education system put too much pressure <br/>
on students. Now some students are paralyzed with boredom.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;dumbing down&quot; of Japan&#39;s education system is one of the reasons that <br/>
private schools, especially junior highs, are gaining in popularity. A <br/>
worse problem, *gakkyu hokai*, which is the total breakdown of classroom <br/>
order, may be another cause.<br/>
<br/>
After-school *juku* (cram schools) that claim to prepare children for <br/>
private junior high school entrance exams are thriving accordingly. Asahi <br/>
Shimbun has received stacks of letters from parents, students and <br/>
teachers on the volatile subject of *juku*. Here is a sampling:<br/>
<br/>
Piano teacher, 37, Tokyo:<br/>
<br/>
My son is in fifth grade of elementary school. He goes regularly to a <br/>
cram school to prepare for private junior high school entrance exams. <br/>
He&#39;s had to give up his extracurricular activities that he used to enjoy, <br/>
and his time to play with his friends and sleep are both limited -- but <br/>
even so, I feel it&#39;s better than having him go to a public junior high <br/>
school in Tokyo.<br/>
<br/>
I feel this way for two reasons. First of all, public junior and senior <br/>
high schools nowadays are absolutely chaotic. Secondly, I don&#39;t trust the <br/>
grading system in use in the public schools.<br/>
<br/>
In Tokyo&#39;s public schools, student delinquency is simply taken for <br/>
granted. Nobody tries to do anything about it. Kids talk on cell phones <br/>
in class. They stay out all night drinking. Even their parents seem to <br/>
have given up on them. &quot;That&#39;s the way kids are today,&quot; they say.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, public junior high schools raise the grades of <br/>
students going on to public senior high schools at the expense of those <br/>
planning to enter private senior high schools.<br/>
<br/>
(Editor&#39;s note: In each public junior high school class, a fixed <br/>
proportion of students must be given the top grade of 5, a slightly <br/>
larger proportion a grade of 4, and so on, all the way down to 1. <br/>
Together with entrance exams, these grades determine admission to senior <br/>
high school.)<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, teachers have begun to use this grading system as a club to <br/>
beat the students with. &quot;That sort of behavior will affect your grades,&quot; <br/>
they threaten -- as if to encourage students to fawn on them and worm <br/>
their way into their good graces for the sake of marks.<br/>
<br/>
Homemaker, 44, Hyogo Prefecture:<br/>
<br/>
My two childen attended a school well-known for its *sogo gakushu* <br/>
(comprehensive studies). The teachers were wonderful, but the problem was <br/>
that so much of the school day was taken up with comprehensive studies <br/>
that there was scarcely any time for the basic subjects.<br/>
<br/>
When my older child was about to graduate from elementary school the <br/>
teacher assured me, and I believed it, that academic skills come <br/>
naturally with the mastering of &quot;life skills&quot;; therefore it was not <br/>
necessary to send the child to cram school.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine my surprise when the junior high school homeroom teacher <br/>
complained to me that my child totally lacked basic academic skills! When <br/>
I talked with other mothers, I found that they had all been sending their <br/>
children to cram schools since their second year of elementary school.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I did with my younger child -- who seems to prefer the <br/>
after-school study: &quot;School&#39;s okay, but at *juku* we learn all kinds of <br/>
things I didn&#39;t know, so it&#39;s really fun.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Homemaker, 48, Fukuoka Prefecture:<br/>
<br/>
My middle daughter is now a first-year university student.<br/>
<br/>
Just before she graduated from elementary school, we moved. Almost all <br/>
the public junior high schools in our new neighborhood were in a state of <br/>
chaos. We had to move fast. We had her take private junior high school <br/>
admission tests, which fortunately she passed, and she enjoyed six <br/>
peaceful years.<br/>
<br/>
It was different with my youngest daughter. Shortly after we moved, her <br/>
school was hit by a wave of *gakkyu hokai* (classroom breakdown). Two or <br/>
three of the boys were running amok in class, attacking the other <br/>
children and even the teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching became utterly impossible. I don&#39;t know how many PTA meetings <br/>
were held. Anyway, my daughter absolutely refused to go to a public <br/>
junior high school -- and insisted on being sent to cram school.<br/>
<br/>
We could not easily afford to send both girls to private schools, but a <br/>
learning environment in which children can study undistracted is surely <br/>
worth financial sacrifice. I think that unless public schools change, the <br/>
exodus into private schools will continue.<br/>
<br/>
Second-year student, 17, of a private girls&#39; high school in Osaka:<br/>
<br/>
Elementary school was difficult for me, especially the math.<br/>
<br/>
What was most important was treating everyone the same. Every effort was <br/>
made to make sure everyone got through the material and nobody fell behind.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some students will understand something after hearing it just once; <br/>
others will need to hear it 20 times before they understand,&quot; the <br/>
teachers would say. But what is the student who understands the first <br/>
time supposed to do during the remaining 19 explanations? The slow <br/>
students improve, but the ones who learn quickly are simply wasting their <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to wait until everyone learns what&#39;s being taught. <br/>
But when the lesson has to slow to the pace of kids who don&#39;t even know <br/>
their multiplication tables, it&#39;s terribly boring. If those who can do a <br/>
test in five minutes have to just sit there for 45 minutes, they will <br/>
inevitably lose interest in school.<br/>
<br/>
Third-year student, 17, at a private high school in Yokohama:<br/>
<br/>
Elementary school Japanese, math, social studies and science were all <br/>
boring. Lots of people say that. Japanese was just writing simple Chinese <br/>
characters and reading easy stories. Math was extremely basic.<br/>
<br/>
At the cram school, on the other hand, they gave us novels and essays to <br/>
read, and we learned a lot of interesting word combinations. In math we <br/>
had to solve difficult problems. For kids who have a thirst for <br/>
knowledge, school is just not enough.<br/>
<br/>
At elementary school, they treat everyone equally. They don&#39;t want one <br/>
student to be different from another. The lessons are easy so that <br/>
everyone will be able to understand them. As a result, students with <br/>
genuine ability don&#39;t have the chance to develop it. What a waste.<br/>
<br/>
Second-year student, 14, at a public junior high school in Osaka:<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t stand kids who spend their time going to cram school and cramming <br/>
for exams. I never study. I never listen in class either. Don&#39;t have to. <br/>
I can pass without working. The teachers say, &quot;If only you&#39;d try a little <br/>
harder, you could go anywhere.&quot; That&#39;s just noise to me.<br/>
<br/>
I have some friends who are pretty bad dudes. To me, they&#39;re a lot more <br/>
interesting than the nerds who do nothing but study.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind kids studying because they know what they want to do in <br/>
life. &quot;In future, I want to be such-and-such, so I&#39;m going to a private <br/>
junior high.&quot; That&#39;s okay. But &quot;I&#39;m going to a private school to get away <br/>
from bullying&quot; -- no. People should study in order to get ahead in life.<br/>
<br/>
Teacher, 41, at a junior high school in Mie Prefecture:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to decide whether to send my elementary school daughter to <br/>
public or private junior high. I teach at a public junior high, but the <br/>
truth is I don&#39;t have much confidence in the public school system.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, there isn&#39;t enough class time. For example, for a course <br/>
that was built around 140 hours of classroom instruction in the school <br/>
year, only 80 percent of that time is available. School events have been <br/>
cut.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, club activities are over-emphasized. In the sports clubs, <br/>
winning is considered everything. Training is continuous, the only breaks <br/>
are for summer&#39;s Obon and New Year&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
About 10 percent of the kids in the grade I teach can read almost no <br/>
kanji at all. Those are the kids who cut classes, or when they do show <br/>
up, cause trouble. You can&#39;t hold the lessons down to their level without <br/>
boring the rest of the class. One way to save the public school system <br/>
might be to organize separate classes for advanced, intermediate and <br/>
slower students.<br/>
<br/>
Teacher, 37, at a junior high school in Nara Prefecture:<br/>
<br/>
The public junior high school where I work is in an area where private <br/>
junior high schools are especially popular.<br/>
<br/>
During the summer holidays we had lecturers come in to help us prepare <br/>
for the new, somewhat lighter curriculum being introduced in 2002.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the local cram schools were busy handing out sample <br/>
end-of-term tests to their students. The samples basically came from <br/>
tests we had given in past years.<br/>
<br/>
Even supposing students get good marks on these test, can we say they <br/>
have really benefitted from the exercise? Or does it merely harm those <br/>
kids who don&#39;t attend cram schools?<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, schools are being asked to provide an education rich in <br/>
experience; on the other, there&#39;s the prevailing view that marks are <br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a contradiction here. As long as the marking system and senior <br/>
high school entrance exams remain what they are, I doubt that change is <br/>
possible.<br/>
