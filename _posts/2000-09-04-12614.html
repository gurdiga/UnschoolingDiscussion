<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941551414">me again ...<br/>
<br/>
actually I COULD give them a Legos test today, Nance and they&#39;d both pass w/<br/>
FLYING COLORS!!!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe the Star Wars sort of city my fellas built this morning,<br/>
it&#39;s INCREDIBLE ... *ack*, I don&#39;t have the HEART to tell them I NEED to<br/>
vacuum!!!  nahhhhhhh, I&#39;ll save *that* chore for *another* day &lt;G&gt; ...<br/>
goodness, I think I just might have a couple of budding architects on my<br/>
hands ... hehe, don&#39;t the critics of UNschooling argue that dch aren&#39;t<br/>
*learning* if they aren&#39;t sitting @ their little desks filling out<br/>
workbooks???  *nooooo*, the critics are WRONG, my dch learn WONDERFUL things<br/>
via play ... mannnnnn, I wished ya&#39;ll could see those busy little minds just<br/>
clicking along as the work w/ the creative juices flowing ... how gratifying<br/>
for me to kick<br/>
back and watch their adventure, yep, it just does a mama&#39;s heart *proud*<br/>

&gt;  hehe, actually my boys showed me about the Family Circus comic yesterday<br/>
...<br/>
&gt;  the comic kids were so excited about getting on the schoolbus and one of<br/>
my<br/>
&gt;  boys said &quot;HA, I wonder if they&#39;ll be as excited on the 2nd day of<br/>
&gt;  school!!!&quot; haha  ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; **Sharp kid!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I love your story about your kidlets helping each, what<br/>
&gt;  nice children you have :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
