I too had a child who was very persistent and reacted badly to being left alone during tantrums. Somehow we got through but there were many times I wished for more wisdom. A few years ago I  noticed a book that came out in 1999 (she was 10 by then, so too late) called Time In: When time Out Doesn&#39;t Work by Jean Illsley Clarke. I can&#39;t recommend a book that I haven&#39;t read, but think I will try to get it from the library and read it. The La Leche League review says: &#39;.....stresses the competence of both adults and children and reinforces their connectedness.&#39;<br/>
The title intrigues me- maybe it would help you (and your son) to at least know that time out maybe isn&#39;t for everyone.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181500540">When I first started time out, I used it as break in the action or <br/>
anger(mine). I never sent my child away; I was normally right there <br/>
in the room. Very quickly I learned that having him control his <br/>
actual time worked much better than a set time. I said to him....&quot;get <br/>
up when you think you can act, sound, or feel better.&quot; I wanted him <br/>
to never dread his room or the place where he chose to have a time <br/>
out. I felt that time out was good for him because we used the time <br/>
for his comfort as well as my anger. (When he was little, I probably <br/>
terrified him. But he never seemed scared, just mad at everything.)  <br/>
When he got older, he went to his room on his own. I never tried to <br/>
restrict what he did there and he would stay for quite a while <br/>
sometimes just thinking and playing. <br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the line after he heard himself and I think because <br/>
he was just growing up too, he started apologizing. Maybe it was <br/>
because I would apologize to him for not being able to deal with his <br/>
tone. At that time, time outs just kinda stopped and even though he <br/>
still got nasty sounding, I wasn&#39;t so mad.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;time in&quot; books sounds like a nessesary read for me. I&#39;ve a <br/>
grandson just born and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get him sooner than I think. <br/>
(They are overseas right now.) Does or has anyone else used time outs <br/>
and how have they evolved for you? Sara in NC</div>
