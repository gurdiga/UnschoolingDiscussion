<div id="ygrps-yiv-57287102">Does it say anywhere how long one would have to worry when exposing <br/>
themselves to someone who had the vaccination? Otherwords, if someone gets <br/>
vaccinated against smallpox, how long would someone have to stay away to <br/>
make sure they didn&#39;t catch it??<br/>
