<div id="ygrps-yiv-672376354">We had such a busy September, hiking, camping, bird watching and volcano<br/>
exploring.  I can&#39;t believe it went so fast.  <br/>
I was out yesterday cleaning up the garden.  I found an enormous zucchini<br/>
I&#39;d somehow missed.  I brought in the rosemary and some other things I<br/>
couldn&#39;t bear to leave to winter.  Today it&#39;s forty degrees and windy and<br/>
I don&#39;t feel much like working.  <br/>
<br/>
We went bird watching this morning but the cold and my sore leg brought<br/>
us home before very long.  So now I&#39;m sitting listening to bird songs,<br/>
this sounds more than a little obsessive I know, and answering e-mail. <br/>
Dylan doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s cold so he&#39;s playing outside.  Every once in a<br/>
while I see the top of his red hat bob past the window.   My little dog<br/>
is wondering what all these eerie sounds are, he&#39;s apparently never hear<br/>
a loon before nor the pig like grunting of pelicans. ( or was that me<br/>
eating cookies?)<br/>
<br/>
The Montana DOL killed three bison today that wandered out of Yellowstone<br/>
park.  This isn&#39;t a political list so I won&#39;t climb on my soap box, but<br/>
it&#39;s disheartening to say the least.  While the bitterns are gurgling<br/>
maybe I&#39;ll e-mail my stinking governor and give her what for.  <br/>
<br/>
So it is with Great Egret that I sign off  (oh, man!  Bad bird humor.)<br/>

<br/>
I am going no-mail for a while. I have a back surgery<br/>
(finally) coming up, soon, and need to empty my mail<br/>
box so that post don&#39;t bounce.<br/>
<br/>
There will still be room for personal letters...they<br/>
are more than welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful that part of me is fixable!!!<br/>
<br/>
See you in December, or there about :-) I hope that<br/>
many of you are having fun traveling to the<br/>
conference, right now. I know it will be wonderful!!!<br/>
Kelly has done so much....<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
Thank you for all you have done<br/>
