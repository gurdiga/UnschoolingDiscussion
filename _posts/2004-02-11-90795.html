<br/>
       Unschoolers in FL have answers to all these legal fear factors, with a <br/>
pretty good track record so far. :)<br/>
<br/>
       First, the legal requirement is academic progress &quot;commensurate with <br/>
the child&#39;s ability&quot; and that&#39;s a piece of cake for successful unschoolers, <br/>
imo. Always has been for us. How could a child fail to measure up to himself (an <br/>
unschooling child, I mean, not a schooled child being royally screwed up like <br/>
in the Rosemond column I posted yesterday!)<br/>
<br/>
       There really are certified teacher-evaluators in Florida who share the <br/>
unschooling philosophy and are willing to help; I&#39;ve even heard of a few <br/>
happy to arrange a fax or email exchange to review your child&#39;s portfolio, for <br/>
those who can&#39;t find an evaluator in their area they especially like. You could <br/>
subscribe to the yahoo group &lt;FL-HomeEducation-law&gt; for more.<br/>
<br/>
       Second, Florida also has a different legal option to comply with <br/>
compulsory attendance requirements. If the independent home education statute <br/>
doesn&#39;t work well for your family, for whatever reason, you can enroll in a <br/>
&quot;private school&quot; that matches your personal philosophy of learning and will support <br/>
your unschooling as you wish it to (no curriculum, tests, or organized classes) <br/>
-- there are  unschoolers who offer these &quot;schools&quot; free of charge, as a <br/>
service to others. <br/>
<br/>
       You could even start such a &quot;school&quot; yourself and thereby help others! <br/>
I know unschoolers who have done this. Some estimate that that there are more <br/>
FL homeschoolers using this option than the total registered under the <br/>
independent statute and stuck filing annual evaluations.See more at<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parentdirectededucation.org/Homeschooling%20in%20Florida.htm">http://www.parentdirectededucation.org/Homeschooling%20in%20Florida.htm</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       I should note that one disadvantage of the private school option over <br/>
independent home education is that Florida law provides broad public program <br/>
access for independent home ed families who wish it, like dual enrollment in <br/>
for-credit high school and college courses, free virtual classes, <br/>
extracurricular participation parttime at local schools (symphony, sports teams, et cetera.) <br/>
This is not available if you go the private school route instead, although <br/>
large &quot;regular&quot; privates often have certain access under their own agreements.<br/>
<br/>
       And although &quot;private school homeschooling&quot; shields you completely <br/>
from the school superintendent, you then do have to send your child&#39;s basic <br/>
identifying info, including certain medical info, and attendance records, to the <br/>
&quot;school&quot; office you choose. (So you can either be on file with the government or <br/>
some private citizens or businesspeople who are unaccountable and perhaps <br/>
even unknown to you! I&#39;m not crazy about either one, but there it is. Unless you <br/>
become a school yourself.) <br/>
<br/>
       Lastly -- for this post at least -- the worst that can happen to an <br/>
unschooler under the FL home ed statute is a sort of probation that gives you a <br/>
year to come into compliance -- in other words, to show the child has made <br/>
progress commensurate with ability, under any legal method. At the end of that <br/>
second year, the worst that could happen is that the Superintendent could <br/>
&quot;terminate&quot; your home ed program for non-compliance and say you had to put the child <br/>
in &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       All the scary stuff, the truancy and CPS interventions, cannot kick in <br/>
because of academic failure. They are for the parent&#39;s legal compliance <br/>
failure, things like not keeping any portfolio or reading materials list, failing <br/>
to turn any evaluation at all, or failure to register your child anywhere under <br/>
any option. You don&#39;t want anything to do with these legal problems, believe <br/>
me! Fortunately they are very easy to avoid because there are several fine <br/>
options for unschoolers. JJ (see pompous sig below in case you find it useful to <br/>

requirements and are unschooler friendly.   After years of doing portfolio&#39;s, I just <br/>
did that.  Now, I can keep pictures and related materials that the kids want to <br/>
keep without worrying about creating a portfolio for someone else to critique <br/>
and decide if my children are making progress.<br/>
<br/>
     E-mail me off list if you would like more information about some local  <br/>
Jacksonville area schools of this type.  You can also start your own.<br/>
<br/>
     Another alternative is to find an unschooling friendly evaluator or a <br/>
friend who has a teaching certificate. <br/>

&lt;&lt;  I&#39;ll never forget a 16 year old coming to me and asking me if he <br/>
addressed an envelope correctly.  He hadn&#39;t.  I taught him how.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But what good does it do a ten year old to know if she doesn&#39;t have anyone to <br/>
write to?<br/>
and if someone needs to know, why can&#39;t he just look at several other <br/>
envelopes and copy that format?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s SO minor a deal, and people ever only learn it once.  After that, <br/>
they&#39;re just reviewing, or going through the motions to satisfy yet ANOTHER teacher.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My question is...how did these families get through the system?  I know how <br/>
my mother in law did it.  She was (to quote my husband) &quot;on the run&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very few states require yearly testing.  A few require occasional.  Many <br/>
require none.<br/>
<br/>
Floridians will have helped you out by now, I&#39;m sure, but as to the idea of <br/>
&quot;late,&quot; it&#39;s best to find ways to live without having to worry about it.<br/>

Great question, Holly.  A personal concern of mine as my daughter is not an &quot;early&quot; reader.  I live in NY had to do our first test this year.  We used the at home, homeschooler, not timed test and as much as i played it down and attempted to ease it into our routine with out much fuss and veiw it as a &quot;learning experience&quot; - it was an intrusion.  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately I only have to do this every other year for a few years.   But don&#39;t want to &quot;go on the run&quot; or &quot;underground.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How have other NY unschoolers on this list dealt with tests?<br/>
Or should i be looking this up in the archives?  oops...&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Last night my nephew telephoned to include me in a survey he was conducting for his 8th grade science class at school.  He was graphing the result of 12 persons answers to the following question.  <br/>
<br/>
Name the three different categories of rocks?  <br/>
<br/>
Of the four people he had surveyed so far, none could name all three categories.  Only one knew one category.  All were adults over the age of 40 - all had taken earth science in their schooling years.  I told him I thought it would be interesting if he were to ask the ninth graders who had taken the class last year to see how many knew the answer.  btw - my nephew didn&#39;t &quot;know&quot; all three categories - he had to check his notes ;-)<br/>
<br/>
He also didn&#39;t seem to know the purpose of the assignment.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Name the three different categories of rocks?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary<br/>
<br/>
I remembered it from 9th grade, and it was told to me again in college <br/>
geology 101.<br/>
<br/>
But I live in rock-land, pretty much, where there are all three kinds of rock <br/>
are visible, I&#39;ve laid flagstone (sedimentary), my dad worked for a mining <br/>
company for years keeping their digging and crushing and sifting and packing <br/>
machinery in operation, but you can&#39;t help but learn what you&#39;re working with <br/>
when the whole company has six employees and they&#39;re frequently out at <br/>
prospecting sites.  That was fun for me, being around those guys sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;All were adults over the age of 40 - all had taken earth science in their <br/>
schooling years. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they lived where grass covers the earth and they never worked around rocks <br/>
or had any interest, it was GOOD that they let that information slip. When <br/>
they need it they can get it back.  If they don&#39;t ever need it, they can use <br/>
that storage space for other better things they DO need.<br/>
<br/>
Being in Albuquerque, I don&#39;t need to know the capital of South Dakota NOR <br/>
how to pronounce it, but I&#39;ve always kinda like trivia (and language) so I don&#39;t <br/>
mind knowing.  But I don&#39;t fault anyone for not knowing the capital of New <br/>
Mexico who doesn&#39;t live here and has no need to know.<br/>

<br/>
I got a couple of private emails and managed to get in contact with a &quot;private&quot; school that is pro-unschooling.  All they do is keep attendance records and there is no charge/tuition/fees, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
A few people have also suggested that I start my own.  Although I&#39;m eager to help out, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m quite ready for that just yet!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481504779">The point of mentioning Joe&#39;s asking me to help him address the envelope wasn&#39;t to say I was worried about them reading late, but to point out that I want that kind of thing to be &quot;okay&quot; for my kids without being scared of the &quot;Big Bad School Board&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband and BIL are two of the brightest young men I know.  They are smart, funny, kind, successful and happy.  I just remember thinking &quot;wow, I kind of took for granted that everyone know how to do this!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I began this adventure, I truly thought I&#39;d find some cirriculum that worked for us and that would be it.  Until I asked Madison to sit down and practice his handwriting.  The look in his eyes was like I&#39;d just slapped him in the face.  Unschooling had been my gut reaction years ago when I considered homeschooling and I reverted back to that.  So glad I did.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s patootie if they can recite memorized facts that they won&#39;t ever have to recite in daily life.  I just want them to live.  I want them to love life.  I want to watch them grow into the individuals that I know they are.  I want to KNOW my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I thank my stars every day for my DH.  He&#39;s so insightful and we have this connection that is just amazing.  I&#39;ll say something that to some people may sound so far out of left field it&#39;s almost right and he GETS it.  I love that.  And I love my MIL for giving me that gift.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Morgan asked me today if she could watch me do my taxes.  I said &quot;It&#39;s boring&quot;...she said &quot;So, I just want to be with you&quot;...The proof is in the pudding.  :)<br/>

  &lt;&lt;  I&#39;ll never forget a 16 year old coming to me and asking me if he <br/>
  addressed an envelope correctly.  He hadn&#39;t.  I taught him how.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  But what good does it do a ten year old to know if she doesn&#39;t have anyone to <br/>
  write to?<br/>
  and if someone needs to know, why can&#39;t he just look at several other <br/>
  envelopes and copy that format?<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s SO minor a deal, and people ever only learn it once.  After that, <br/>
  they&#39;re just reviewing, or going through the motions to satisfy yet ANOTHER teacher.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;My question is...how did these families get through the system?  I know how <br/>
  my mother in law did it.  She was (to quote my husband) &quot;on the run&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Very few states require yearly testing.  A few require occasional.  Many <br/>
  require none.<br/>
<br/>
  Floridians will have helped you out by now, I&#39;m sure, but as to the idea of <br/>
  &quot;late,&quot; it&#39;s best to find ways to live without having to worry about it.<br/>
