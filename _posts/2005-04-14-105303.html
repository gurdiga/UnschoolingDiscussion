<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050563037">I&#39;ll preface this by saying that although I have tried to explain numerous times about unschooling to my MIL, she still doesn&#39;t quite seem to be able to stop asking, &quot;well what about their lessons?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So yesterday  I was telling my husband that the kids and I had an educational day. He looked at me rather weird when I mentioned the E word. (that was a joke and a word I don&#39;t use often) Anyway, I explained how me and the kids watched School of Rock and really enjoyed it and then talked about the style of Constantine and Bo on American Idol. We had a nice discusion about rock music because of the movie. My husband said he would have to watch it too.<br/>
<br/>
Then today were able to spend the day at the beach with all 4 kids. Something we don&#39;t do as much as I would like. Tara (19) is kept pretty busy. We had a perfect beach day and the expert sand castle maker (Tara&#39;s own words) helped all 3 of the younger ones build. We searched for shells and rocks and Joseph&#39;s (10) fascination with bottle caps had them finding some ones we never heard of. <br/>
<br/>
Later after we are all home and showered, my MIL stops by. Again my husband must of got the lesson question. I walked into the room as he was explaining that yesterdays learning came from rock and roll and today was beers of the world.<br/>
I somehow don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be asking again anytime soon!!!!<br/>

Reminds me of Animaniacs&#39; song about cheeses of the world<br/>
 <br/>
OH, how I love my Cheeeses; cheese from around the world...<br/>
 <br/>
They loved to sarcastically make the show educational. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
That song was geography and vocabulary.  Holly only discovered it very  <br/>
recently.  I&#39;ll be glad when Animaniacs comes out on DVD.<br/>

I&#39;m glad you mentioned this, as I recently decided to host a &quot;Cheese Festival&quot; during the dreariest month of the year (which is February here).  I&#39;ve just started thinking about a list of &quot;cheesy&quot; music (figuratively), but some literally cheesy music would be great.<br/>
<br/>
(Originally I was planning a &quot;fog festival&quot;, on the principle that when life sends you lemons you can make lemonade, but fog didn&#39;t give me many menu ideas.)  (Except Pavlova, the national dessert from the Land of the Long White Cloud.)<br/>

If you don&#39;t have a copy of that song, I&#39;ll send my tape and you can pull it <br/>
off of there and return it later.   Different cheeses introduce themselves in <br/>
their native.... cartoon accents, and tell about themselves.  Then there&#39;s the <br/>
fine booming march chorus.<br/>
