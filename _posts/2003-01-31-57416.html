<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097253050">Marty and I watched Signs the other night.  Marty had seen it in the theater <br/>
and told me he wanted to be there when I saw it, so I rented it.   It wasn&#39;t <br/>
nearly as scary as I was afraid it would be.<br/>
<br/>
Mary has also seen The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, so we were able to make <br/>
comparisons.  <br/>
<br/>
Turns out Kirby has seen NONE of those three movies.  So I&#39;ll rent the other <br/>
two before long and Kirby and I will probably watch them together.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the same as getting a movie they  never heard of and saying &quot;I&#39;d <br/>
like for you to watch this with me.&quot;   Once you get going with a shared movie <br/>
history, one will lead naturally to another.  You can go by director, or <br/>
subject (submarine movies or westerns) or actor (Holly asked last night what <br/>
Tom Cruise was in, and we couldn&#39;t think of anything offhand that she would <br/>
have seen or might like), or time period or place or language (I&#39;ve decided <br/>
never to watch a French movie ever again, after Brotherhood of the Wolf and <br/>
The Piano Teacher [which nobody should watch ever]).</div>
