<div><font face="Arial" size="2">It&#39;s not my intention&nbsp;to start a debate or 
create a controversy about the merits (or not) of this press release and/or the 
new publications that are mentioned below, but I did notice the portion that 
I&#39;ve highlighted in bold and have underlined.&nbsp; I know we have some aspiring 
teen and preteen writers in our midst.&nbsp; I, therefore, didn&#39;t want to pass 
up the chance to let them know about this career opportunity.&nbsp; Also, I 
think it would be great if the magazine, and&nbsp;its web edition, had some 
input from at least one homeschooler.&nbsp; Please let us know if any of our 
homeschooled kids become involved.&nbsp; </font></div>

  PUBLICATION FOR TEEN 
  GUYS<br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>Rodale 
  Inc., a publisher of healthy living information, has<br>announced that MH-18 
  was chosen as the official title of its <br>new magazine and website aimed at 
  teenage guys in grades <br>8 to 12. <strong><u>MH-18 has also announced a 
  talent search for high <br>school and junior high school students to 
  contribute story <br>ideas and articles to its online and print publications. 
  MH-18 <br>is seeking to recruit high-school-age field reporters to report 
  <br>and write about trends, issues and events that affect them. 
  <br><br></u></strong>MH-18, which is a spin-off of Men&#39;s Health magazine, is a 
  new <br>publication that will provide teen males with information on 
  <br>topics including fitness, sports, girls, gear and life. The new 
  <br>publication will premier on the Web later this spring and the <br>magazine 
  will launch with issues in September and December <br>of 2000. The magazine is 
  expected to roll out bi-monthly in 2001. <br><br>``MH-18 has a code-like 
  quality that appeals to teens,&#39;&#39; says Jeff <br>Csatari, Editor of MH-18. 
  ``Eighteen is a magical age that <br>everyone aspires to, whether you&#39;re 13 or 
  17.&#39;&#39; </font></div>
