<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111224525">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been noticing a &quot;poor me&quot; increase with one of my girls.  We  <br/>
have twins and the relationship between them has always been that  <br/>
Athena is the one to take initiative, to command, to lead.  She is  <br/>
quick of mind (figures things out, anticipating your next move etc).   <br/>
Penelope is intuitive, more fearful of making mistakes, lets others  <br/>
(her sister and us) decide, etc.  Athena has been the one to take  <br/>
things from Penelope.  Penelope then whines and cries and then gets  <br/>
furious.  When I try and step in, not to fix things (though I have  <br/>
made that mistake in the past) but to separate them and then give  <br/>
each their chance to speak their mind, Athena immediately feels like  <br/>
I&#39;m favoring Penny and storms off slamming doors and saying hurtful  <br/>
things and then Penny *seems* to play the victim for all its worth  <br/>
(she often can&#39;t suppress a smile watching me giving her attention.   <br/>
Then she makes herself get all upset again, slumps her shoulders,  <br/>
sighs, she even slumps to the floor and lays there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to handle this.  How can I help her get out of the  <br/>
victim frame of mind?  I tell her that I want her to feels safe in  <br/>
her home, that if she cannot deal with an argument with Athena to  <br/>
come and get me if I haven&#39;t already stuck my head in.  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Not sure how old your girls are, but we have fighting siblings here  <br/>
too (mostly our 5 and 7 year olds), it seems to happen more in the  <br/>
winter, when they are inside together more during the day, and that  <br/>
they both need more connection and help from me.  I have found that  <br/>
instead of ignoring the &quot;offender&quot;, they are the child who needs my  <br/>
attention most.  I try my best to remember that they are in pain and  <br/>
always presume positive intent (i.e. of course do not want to hurt  <br/>
their sibling, but just simply cannot control themselves sometimes,  <br/>
being a little kid and all).  So, one thing that has really helped  <br/>
is, when I hear a fight happening and I come upon the kids, I  <br/>
immediately apologize to the &quot;offender&quot;, I say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m really  <br/>
sorry I didn&#39;t get here in time&quot; and &quot;looks like you needed my help&quot;,  <br/>
and then I help mediate the conflict, respectfully.  Another thing  <br/>
that helps is family meetings, sometimes daily, where each of us talk  <br/>
about our *problems*, *plans*, and *sharing* (make three columns on a  <br/>
big dry erase board) we get a lot of problems worked out that way,  <br/>
when the emotions are NOT high, and make agreements that we can refer  <br/>
back to when in the thick of disagreements.  Other things that have  <br/>
worked were creating more space for &quot;special time&quot; with each child,  <br/>
10-15 minutes a day, each.  Also, we parents are so relieved to have  <br/>
things going well between our children that we sometimes don&#39;t notice  <br/>
the details of the generous and flexible moments between them. If you  <br/>
look carefully, I think you&#39;ll see sharing, assistance, and  <br/>
thoughtfulness at moments and in places you hadn&#39;t noticed before,  <br/>
and your noticing of those times will only create more!  Also, all of  <br/>
the kids know that they can call out &quot;mama! problem!&quot; when they have  <br/>
an issue they don&#39;t feel they can take care of peacefully on their  <br/>
own - even my teenager will use this code word he has always known if  <br/>
he gets into a situation with the youngers (they wouldn&#39;t leave his  <br/>
room last night and he was really tired and starting to feel mad), so  <br/>
it helps both the &quot;victim&quot; and the &quot;offender&quot; (not that we use ever  <br/>
those labels either, this is just for clarification of this post)  <br/>
feel empowered to feel safe in their home and not have the burden of  <br/>
solving every problem themselves.<br/>

Thank you for your reply.   If I did this I really believe Athena  <br/>
would feel incredibly relieved.  It takes the weight off of her  <br/>
losing control.  Yes, both girls (nearly 8) spend most of the day in  <br/>
peaceful play, sharing and working out problems together.  There are  <br/>
a few buttons Penny has and I would like to find a way to help her  <br/>
out of the slump to the ground state she gets in.  Athena will  <br/>
suddenly take the play where Penny doesn&#39;t want to go, and Penny&#39;s  <br/>
immediate reaction is a whiney cry, an immediate slump and frowns and  <br/>
more whines.  Maybe I&#39;m rushing things.... I mean, I have said before  <br/>
that I am re-connecting with unschooling/peaceful parenting and  <br/>
although I haven&#39;t gone &quot;mainstream&quot; I have been leaving them to  <br/>
their own defenses when they fight.  I will try your suggestions.  I  <br/>
also like the family meeting idea.  We used to write down the  <br/>
problems (sibling rivalry techniques) and it worked then for the most  <br/>
part.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Vida<br/>

The idiom is &quot;leaving them to their own devices.&quot;<br/>

Neither leaving them to their own devices nor to their own defenses  <br/>
is a good idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537365830">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the correction.  After living in Greece for 20 years, it  <br/>
is amazing how you begin to forget the language.  I find myself half  <br/>
translating Greek and English in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
I have read your articles and Joyces as well.  They have been very  <br/>
helpful.  At times, when in the middle of a big fight it can be hard  <br/>
to break the old habits and upgrade to newer ones.  I keep striving,  <br/>
and things are getting better.  I just want to know if there is a way  <br/>
to help her inner light glow stronger so that she can find a way out  <br/>
of the &quot;victim&quot; role.  I think the essence is her fear of making  <br/>
mistakes and displeasing others, especially her sister, so she gives  <br/>
in even though she wants something else.  She just hates fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Are there more possibilities that I&#39;m not seeing here?  (this is more  <br/>
a question to myself, I realized you can&#39;t really answer that for  <br/>
me).  Like I said, from DAY 1, when I switched from being less  <br/>
present with them to very present, things have turned around.  The  <br/>
more I say &quot;yes&quot; to Athena, for example, the less she demands and is  <br/>
able to share.  But I don&#39;t see *very* much change with Penny, mostly  <br/>
because the dynamic is between the two of them.  With me I see that  <br/>
she is being more cuddly.  That is a sign that she is feeling *safer*  <br/>
with me.  I don&#39;t know, perhaps I&#39;m rushing the process.<br/>

Any change is change.  Some people take a while to process their  <br/>
thoughts; some people seem to do it immediately.  If you saw any  <br/>
change, that&#39;s progress.<br/>
