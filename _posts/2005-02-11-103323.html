&lt;&lt; it seems it will take a lifetime for me to fully embrace it all  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Ah...<br/>
You don&#39;t have a lifetime.  <br/>
You don&#39;t even have your child&#39;s whole childhood.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t feel bad about pressing people to hurry up and change if <br/>
they&#39;re going to.   Some homeschooling folks advocate letting parents take <br/>
their time to figure out what homeschooling will work best for them, and to let <br/>
them gradually move through all the stages they might need to settle on what <br/>
works. <br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s nonsense in the case of a parent whose child is unhappy in ANY <br/>
degree, or a parent who has seen unschooling&#39;s results and wants them.   <br/>
<br/>
There just isn&#39;t a lot of time to waffle and weasle and justify lack of <br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
And because I&#39;ve changed the subject, in case anyone had quit reading the <br/>
money management thing, I&#39;m going to repaste what I wrote under that heading a <br/>
minute ago:<br/>

&lt;&lt; but there are times when things just come out - or I speak in a way that <br/>
sound like the way my mother spoke to me and I feel like all I can do after is <br/>
apologize and hope that I can do better next time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=I feel like all I can do after is...-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s worth working on.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Better&quot; than a bad situation is better than nothing.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to do your optimal best, first picture it and define it and <br/>
REALLY know what your principal goals are.  Mine were &quot;learning environment&quot; and <br/>
&quot;joy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When you make a decision, no matter how small, give yourself two choices.  <br/>
Don&#39;t move until you&#39;ve considered TWO options.  Then choose the better one.  <br/>
When you&#39;re on automatic, telling yourself there&#39;s only one way t</div>
