<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515748029">In July this year this amazing hoard of gold and silver was found in Staffordshire by a hobbyist with his metal detector. This week an inquest is being held to see whether the hoard will officially be defined as &#39;&#39;treasure&#39;&#39;, I thought I would just post about it here in case anyone missed the news.(Appologies if it&#39;s already been discussed.)<br/>
<br/>
The hoard contains over 1,500 individual items, fascinating things like helmets, sword fittings, religious inscriptions, crosses.... approximately 5 kg of gold and 1.3 kg of silver! (Sutton Hoo had 1.66kg of gold). I thought some of the families who are into history, or any budding archaeologists, might be interested in this.<br/>
