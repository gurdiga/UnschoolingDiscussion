<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324043845">Hi Carol --<br/>
<br/>
My husband is out of town this weekend, and the running joke that we have <br/>
about his trips is that when he is gone, I do something &quot;spontaneous&quot;. <br/>
(That&#39;ll teach him to leave!) Once we got a new dog. Once I painted my <br/>
daughter&#39;s room dark blue. (Her request.) Once I raked up all the leaves in <br/>
our huge wooded back yard. (Where was my imagination that time?) <br/>
<br/>
This trip (a &quot;fun&quot; ice-climbing trip in New Hampshire for him), I am busy <br/>
papering the dining room with favorite quotes. Mostly unschooling stuff. <br/>
There is glue involved. On the walls. Margaret Mead (&quot;My grandmother wanted <br/>
me to have an education so she kept me out of school&quot;,etc.); H. L. Mencken; <br/>
Einstein (&quot;The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a <br/>
faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has <br/>
forgotten the gift.&quot;,etc).; Dan Quayle (&quot;We&#39;re going to have the <br/>
best-educated American people in the world.&quot; Snort.); John Holt (of course); <br/>
Plato; Jack Handy (of Saturday Night Live &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot;: &quot;Instead of having <br/>
&#39;answers&#39; on a math test, they should just call them &#39;impressions&#39;, and if  <br/>
you got a different  &#39;impression&#39;, so what, can&#39;t we all be brothers?&quot;); and <br/>
now, with your permission, I can paste your Boredom poem in our subversive, <br/>
inspirational, dining room. Your poem was beautiful, and the great thing <br/>
about my dining room is now it FILLED with Truth. Please? You&#39;d be in good <br/>
company. (Well, mostly.)<br/>
<br/>
Mark&#39;s gonna love this.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760577372">Wow, Laura - I&#39;m not sure my efforts should up there on the wall with the words<br/>
of Mead, Einstein, Holt, Plato, etc, but perhaps you could put me somewhere near<br/>
Dan Quale and any &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot; quotes! (I just love that book!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d be honoured to have a place on your wall :-)<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of such a wall - can I steal your idea, please?<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few years ago, a family I knew were building a new house. It was a very<br/>
elegant, fashionable, keeping-one-step-ahead-of-the-Jones sort of house. But<br/>
before they got around to painting / wallpapering the living room, one of their<br/>
small kids had a birthday party, and as a fun activity, the kids all got to paint<br/>
pictures on the walls. Well, they are both grown and gone to university now, so I<br/>
guess they may have painted the wall by now, but for years the kids paintings<br/>
remained, and were added to by their own kids and many visitors (adults as well<br/>
as children), for whom the delight of being &#39;allowed&#39; to draw on the walls was<br/>
irresistable!<br/>
<br/>
It was a wonderful wall, and a great reminder to me that you can&#39;t catagorize<br/>
people - This woman was the last I would have thought of as likely to do a thing<br/>
like this :-)<br/>
