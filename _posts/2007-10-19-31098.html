environmental awareness intersect.<br/>
<br/>
From today&#39;s Chicago Tribune: &quot;A Latvian emigre teaching mathematics in <br/>
upstate New York in 1997 used crochet to produce the first physical model of a <br/>
convoluted geometric abstraction. Inspired by her, two Australian sisters living <br/>
in Los Angeles decided about two years ago to expand the model into a symbol of <br/>
their homeland, the endangered Great Barrier Reef. Galvanized by the sisters, <br/>
120 Chicago area residents began three months ago to crochet their own <br/>
reef.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
chicagotribune.com/reef  has the full article and a few not very satisfying <br/>
pictures. Searching for more I ended up at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theiff.org/reef/index.html%c2%a0">http://www.theiff.org/reef/index.html%c2%a0</a> The Institute for Figuring is home to the project. Reef pages include many <br/>
many very cool photos, discussion of the algorithim used to create the reef, <br/>
crocheting instructions.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the Institute&#39;s pages include many more very cool connections.  <br/>
&quot;If mathematics is a language of pattern its structures may be seen as the <br/>
verses of a formal, yet fantastical poetics. Across the globe people have <br/>
delighted in the harmonies of this language and the patterns discovered therein. These <br/>
are the songs that figures sing amongst themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Chicago&#39;s reef and parts of the larger reef project are on display at the <br/>
Chicago Cultural Center through December 13th.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure this artist is part of the mathematical side of crocheted coral reefs, but if you appreciate the artwork in it you might like this blog.<br/>

I&#39;ve followed her work for the last year or so and it&#39;s amazing.  I&#39;ve linked her coral garden.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453620734">Ok WOW! OMG!  I&#39;m a bit speechless.  I knew this deep in my soul from <br/>
doing crochet myself that there is something deeply mathmetical about <br/>
it.  I don&#39;t know, it is just something that I feel when I do it.  A <br/>
deep connection to the ratio, balance, and infinite of all things down <br/>
to a molecular level.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know how else to explain that, but then you go and put up <br/>
this thing about coral reefs and algorithms.  I knew I wasn&#39;t odd to <br/>
feel these things about something like scraps of strings and fabric!</div>
