tempt good Christians to turn from Jesus, who lovingly and patiently stands <br/>
at the door and knocks, who will accept them back with open arms, who left <br/>
the ninety and nine to go after that one lost lamb (that story never made <br/>
good sense in any way).  Take your time thinking about the freely offered <br/>
grace God is offering you, in His infinite love. And if you die before you <br/>
&quot;decide,&quot; you&#39;re going to burn in eternity in sulphurous pits where you will <br/>
cry out but will not be heard, where your thirst will not be quenched.<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day!   :-)<br/>

Oh.  In an article about two teenaged girls who were rescued from being <br/>
abducted, one said she knew there was a bowie knife in the car.  It was he b<br/>
oyfriends car the abductor had stolen.  She wanted to get the guy, but was <br/>
worried about whether if she killed him she would go to hell.<br/>

I don&#39;t think you&#39;re Baptist.  That&#39;s okay.  And it&#39;s okay not to defend <br/>
Baptists.  And when I was sarcastic it was all Baptist rhetoric I had pieced <br/>
together to build that.  And there ARE people who believe that way.  I will <br/>
send you photocopies of recent letters from my cousins in Texas, concerning <br/>
their father&#39;s request for contact after many years of estrangement (their <br/>
choice).  No, he&#39;s no longer Baptist, so they wouldn&#39;t even tell him how many <br/>
kids they had.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m serious.  I&#39;ll send you copies if you still doubt I have earned my <br/>
opinions the honest, slow hard way.<br/>

I did not know until LAST THURSDAY that this was in Hair.  Holly likes<br/>
Hair.  <br/>
I never did.  She&#39;s familiar with the video; I&#39;m not.  I had bought a<br/>
bunch <br/>

listened to them all and she put on Hair while I was getting ready for<br/>
the <br/>
conference.   **<br/>
<br/>
Does Holly know?  She seems to have a photographic (cinematic?) memory<br/>
for video.  (Saturday night she was comparing the beginnings of two<br/>
movies from memory and talking about the types of fades and wipes and<br/>
stuff marking the transition from one scene to the other.  I can&#39;t<br/>
remember that stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know because I learned all the Hair song lyrics listening to the<br/>
album in olden days, **before video was invented**.  That&#39;s what I<br/>
remembered the &quot;what a piece of work is man&quot; stuff from.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
seen the movie.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that some parts of the stage musical didn&#39;t get included<br/>
in the movie. <br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  (How about a google search to figure out where in the world the<br/>
musical is playing and then the classic unschooling &quot;lesson&quot; in long<br/>
division to figure how long it would take to get there.)  (If you don&#39;t<br/>
know this story, ask Pam S.)</div>
