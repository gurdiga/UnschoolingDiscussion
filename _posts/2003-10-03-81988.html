<div id="ygrps-yiv-221813188"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If he learns to read on his own and he knows it, and you know it, he <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d revise that to read:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not much is PERCEIVED as harder than a young person&#39;s figuring out how to <br/>
read on his own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers know that reading can be learned without instruction. The rest of <br/>
society views it as nearly impossible without schools. It&#39;s the *perception*.<br/>
<br/>
There are other things that might be harder for him to learn---maybe many <br/>
things. But if he knows that HE learned to read (which society believes to be <br/>
nearly impossible without early intervention and phonics and &quot;readers&quot; and flash <br/>
cards and hours and hours and hours od painstaking read-alouds)  on his own, <br/>
he&#39;ll be empowered to know that he can learn so many other things on his own. <br/>
It&#39;ll destroy the myth of the need for teachers for every little thing he needs <br/>
to know. He&#39;ll learn that he can willingly ask for assistance and receive it <br/>
graciously. Very important, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279512126"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But are you guys saying, that because you spend *some* of your time<br/>
 </span></blockquote>playing, you don&#39;t consider work...work?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I spend ALL of my time playing!  ANd work is only what you make it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;What about running a household?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dishes? Chores? Check books and other necessary evils?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
What about it? I do those things because they are important to me. If there <br/>
was something I REALLY found distasteful (like checkbook balancing), I&#39;d find a <br/>
way around around it in order to have a playful, joyful life. (I got rid of <br/>
the checkbook. I just use cash. BINGO!) If I truly hated housework---if it gave <br/>
me no joy, I would hire someone to do it for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I guess when I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>said &quot;grow up&quot; about my kids that I was wondering when in thier lives I<br/>
would begin to see that tendancy in them to understand that part of our<br/>
lives is &quot;necessarry application&quot; and other is fun and discovery. Even if<br/>
we end up in jobs we love, all of life is not fun and games.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe that, if your life is NOT all fun and games, you need a new <br/>
life----or at least new priorities! &lt;G&gt; You&#39;ll see a tendency to do &quot;necessary <br/>
applications&quot; when the child is ready. It&#39;s different for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And those times that it&#39;s not doesn&#39;t have to be miserable drudgery but <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it does<br/>
take a willingness and dedication right?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;So, is there any time in a child&#39;s life when one can expect to see a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pleasant/contented/willing understanding that parts of the day are for<br/>
work and other parts are for play?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in your children&#39;s lives. Not in mine. I want them to know that you can <br/>
find joy in ALL parts of your life. That there are others you can pay if <br/>
there&#39;s something that you find truly distasteful----or that you can be creative <br/>
in dealing with it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Are there ways to encourage<br/>
 </span></blockquote>responsiblity and a joyful dedication to getting those things done that<br/>
we don&#39;t always prefer that don&#39;t communicate &quot;life isn&#39;t about<br/>
playtime&quot;? Is there a way to thow out the bathwater without tossing the<br/>
baby?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Looks to me that YOU&#39;RE throwing out the joy while tossing the life! I hate <br/>
the words &quot;work&quot; and &quot;chore&quot;. There are things that need to be done in order to <br/>
make your life more joyful and pleasant----like clean clothes and clean <br/>
sheets and clean dishes and a stocked refrigerator and clean toilets and vacuumed <br/>
carpets. These things can be done begrudgingly or joyfully. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re making children do these things that are important to YOU &quot;just <br/>
because&quot;, the children will learn that chores suck and they won&#39;t want to do <br/>
them. If you model giving, loving care of your property and if you take care of it <br/>
because it&#39;s important to the house&#39;s and to your well-being, the children <br/>
will take ownership and act accordingly. But THEY NEED TO SEE YOU MODEL THAT <br/>
BEHAVIOUR!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;So far modeling is as far as I go. But I&quot;d honestly like to raise<br/>
 </span></blockquote>children who have healthy priorities. Will that happen with *just*<br/>
modeling?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Uh huh. And I&#39;d also talk out loud: &quot;I love clean sheets at night. I&#39;m going <br/>
to wash mine today. Do you want to bring down your sheets too?&quot; and tell them <br/>
when you tuck them in how nice the sheets smell and feel.  &quot;I&#39;m going out to <br/>
garden.&quot; If they show up, just talk about how much you love homegrown tomatoes <br/>
and cucumbers and how much you like providing them.  While you&#39;re folding <br/>
clothes, talk about how small or suddenly HUGE their shirts are (that amazes me <br/>
still!) and how much you love having clean clothes. JOYFULLY model the <br/>
behaviour-----complaining while dusting won&#39;t accomplish it!<br/>
