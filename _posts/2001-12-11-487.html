I sent this to Anton:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Kirby has a job at minimum wage plus first obligatory raise.   He spends<br/>
most of it on anime books (I forget the Japanese word for cartoon books<br/>
based on animated series)...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
...and he responded:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The magic word of the day is: Manga<br/>
<br/>
For more info and links:<br/>

<br/>
Now that I&#39;m about to send this (and thought that I was being so helpful),<br/>
it occurs to me that you&#39;re not looking for the word--if you were, all you&#39;d<br/>
have to do is ask Kirby!<br/>
<br/>
Ah, well. If anyone else is interested....<br/>
<br/>
Susan<br/>
Btw, to everyone else: this is my first post on this list. I have two girls<br/>
(WOMEN!), 19 and 21. Anton is my oldest daughter&#39;s....um....ah...it remains<br/>
to be seen just what he is (more later).</div>
