<div id="ygrps-yiv-171992651">&lt;&lt;Can you describe it in text?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It looks a lot like a bear hug from behind the violent person.  Person A is<br/>
becoming violent.  Person B comes up from behind and reaches around Person A<br/>
with both arms.  Person B&#39;s right hand holding Person A&#39;s left wrist; Person<br/>
B&#39;s left hand holding Person A&#39;s right wrist.  Then Person B pulls Person<br/>
A&#39;s arms tight, criss-crossed across their chest.  Person B can then gently<br/>
sit down and wrap their legs around Person A&#39;s waist.  You can hang out like<br/>
that for a long time without getting too tired and you don&#39;t have to worry<br/>
about potential breathing problems that happen with some other holds.<br/>
<br/>
What I like best about it is that as Person A calms down, the hold is easily<br/>
released into a hug.<br/>
