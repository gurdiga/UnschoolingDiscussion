I would have at least pretended to like it, being on TV and all.  [;-)] <br/>

I *loved* the room when it was finished.  <br/>

I&#39;ve never seen anyone else just hate it, although some people are <br/>
definitely not sure.  I kinda felt sorry for the gal, because she seemed <br/>
kinda like a shrew.  lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135691693">There&#39;s a show in England called Changing Rooms that<br/>
sounds just like this.<br/>
I saw one episode where a woman just hated what they<br/>
had done. She didn&#39;t get stroppy or anything, but she<br/>
cried (she did wait until she thought the cameras<br/>
weren&#39;t rolling - but they were). <br/>
Mostly they did pretty cool stuff, but sometimes it<br/>
looked a bit cheesy to me.<br/>

Americanized version of the show.<br/>
