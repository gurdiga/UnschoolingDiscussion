<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038189357">From another list:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Today is November 19th, 1999.<br/>
<br/>
The numerical format for today is 11-19-1999. All of the digits are odd.<br/>
<br/>
 The next Odd day after that will be 1-1-3111 - which is well over a<br/>
thousand<br/>
 years away, which we will never see.<br/>
<br/>
 Days such as 4-13-89 have both even and odd digits, thus, it is neither odd<br/>
nor even.<br/>
<br/>
 The next even day will be 2-2-2000 - the first one since 8-28-888.<br/>
<br/>
 So, now you have a reason to celebrate this Friday as it&#39;ll be your last<br/>
odd<br/>
day on  Earth!!!!!!<br/>
