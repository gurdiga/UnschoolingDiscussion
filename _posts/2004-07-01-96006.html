If you&#39;re out there in cyber land somewhere, could you email me?<br/>
I have a couple questions for you about the T-shirts you sell...I&#39;m <br/>
going to need a source for next years conference, as well as canvas <br/>
bags.<br/>
I looked under &quot;members&quot; to try and find ya...but didn&#39;t. <br/>
If anyone else has Mary&#39;s (MaryB in Florida) email, could you let me <br/>
know? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

If you do not get her by e-mail, let me know.  We are in the same homeschool group, and I see her a couple of times a week.  Also, as far as I know, she is not doing the t-shirts anymore.  Let me know if I can help ya.<br/>
