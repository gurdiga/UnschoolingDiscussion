   It looks as if Buzz gave you better info than I could have, I&#39;m very new<br/>
to the unschooling scene.  As for cost of living, a two bdrm house in To in<br/>
a reasonable neighbourhood, about $250,000, obviously it can go up alot<br/>
from there, not down very much unless your REALLY into home renovation. As<br/>
for the burbs, that depends on how far you want to drive, One hour drive<br/>
which is very suburban, varies alot.  Ie. New subcivisions ar aften around<br/>
200,000, but very crowded, if you are willing top drive a bit further and<br/>
live more in the country less.  Depends which direction you drive.  Maybe<br/>
I&#39;ll see you on the Toronto Homeschool list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve unsubscribed, not because this wasn&#39;t fascinating, just too much<br/>
volume at this stage of my life.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck Holly finding work.<br/>
