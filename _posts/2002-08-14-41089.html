<div id="ygrps-yiv-408222541">I don&#39;t know how long it takes to load with dial-up, but i&#39;d think <br/>
it&#39;s well worth the time.  The creation stories are beautifully <br/>
illustrated and narrated.  My almost 4-year old son loved looking and <br/>
listening to the stories.  While I did get this link from an atheist <br/>
list and it does include the old testament creation story among the <br/>
myths, it delivers the story with out mocking it.<br/>
