As I said earlier, I will be putting a transcript together (probably<br/>
along with a narrative) for her and just wondering what I&#39;ll put on<br/>
it, if she doesn&#39;t complete more &quot;traditional&quot; classes. I know, not<br/>
very unschooly of me, but I just think that a more traditional route<br/>
might be easier for school people to understand if she does decide to<br/>
pursue college at some point.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So....your goal is have her unique learning experience look like every <br/>
other traditional high school student&#39;s in the US?<br/>
<br/>
*WHY* would that be appealing to a university? What about that would <br/>
make the college stop and think, &quot;Hmmm...maybe *this* student would be <br/>
a good match?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If her transcript looks like every other transcript that passes across <br/>
the admissions desk, WHY would the admissions officer look twice? Why <br/>
would he look once? It&#39;s just the same ol&#39; same ol&#39;---nothing new. <br/>
Nothing inspired. Nothing diverse.<br/>
<br/>
Colleges and universities are looking for students who SPARKLE! Make <br/>
her transcript sparkle! SHOW that she&#39;s different! Unique! An *honor* <br/>
to have her as a student there!<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t NEED another &quot;A&quot; student cheerleader president of the <br/>
student body. Seriously! Those are a dime a dozen.<br/>
<br/>
What they want is diversity. What does *YOUR* child have to offer the <br/>
school? What does *your* child have that NO other applicant has?<br/>
<br/>
Submit THAT!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
 I have read some of Alison Mckee&#39;s<br/>
books on how to put together portfolios..... but with 5 kids, I don&#39;t<br/>
know how easy this would be for me to do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
One at a time---unless you have quintuplets. Even then---one at a time.<br/>

<br/>
GOOD, Kelly.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I&#39;ve thought every time someone has talked about making a  <br/>
transcript that looks like a &quot;real transcript.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why not make a summary of unschooling that looks like the child&#39;s  <br/>
real experience?<br/>
<br/>
Much (most) of what is said to be &quot;required&quot; by universities is  <br/>
really required by high schools.  High school guidance counsellors  <br/>
won&#39;t help a child in the same way who isn&#39;t going along with all the  <br/>
school&#39;s recommendations as he will help one who&#39;s bucking the  <br/>
system.  Without school&#39;s threats of what college requires, y&#39;know,  <br/>
kids in high schools might start making their own decisions or  <br/>
something.<br/>

I say two things:<br/>
<br/>
One at a time and it will be easier each time, or<br/>
<br/>
if it seems too hard to do, put your kids in school.  The school will  <br/>
provide a transcript.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199665525">I understand what you&#39;re saying, but I just thought it might be <br/>
helpful to have a more traditional transcript along with a narrative <br/>
explaining all of my daughter&#39;s learning experiences. Of some of the <br/>
things I&#39;ve read about putting together portfolios, most of them <br/>
talked about having a portfolio and SAT or ACT scores, and/or college <br/>
courses taken during high school years (to show colleges that your <br/>
child can do college level work----their words, not mine). What if <br/>
she doesn&#39;t have any of those things? As I said previously, she&#39;s <br/>
probably not heading in that direction anyway and I personally don&#39;t <br/>
think <br/>
college is the be all/end all road to success, but it can open doors, <br/>
in certain situations. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot more to being a &quot;successful&quot; person though....doing <br/>
something that you love do in life, being compassionate and loving <br/>
towards others, and just being the best person YOU can be, using all <br/>
the gifts God gave you.<br/>
<br/>
I was really just looking for much needed advice and some of you gave <br/>
me a lot that was really helpful. Some of you, though, may want to be <br/>
a bit more compassionate in your responses to others. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks....<br/>

We know all this.  People here are trying to give you alternatives to  <br/>
what you&#39;ve already found easily and obviously.  We know it&#39;s all out  <br/>
there.  You can go with those things or you can consider alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I was really just looking for much needed advice and some of you  <br/>
gave me a lot that was really helpful. Some of you, though, may want  <br/>

<br/>
As the list owner, I have this very important advice:  Read lots  <br/>
before you post.<br/>
<br/>
Read the links that have been put up today.  Read the archives  <br/>
(linked at the bottom of each e-mail)---not years&#39; worth, but a few  <br/>
topics.  Go to the page and search for transcripts or portfolios.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I personally don&#39;t think college is the be all/end all road to  <br/>
success, but it can open doors, in certain situations. -=-<br/>
<br/>
At least read the list until you see why telling the over-a-thousand  <br/>
people here things like that college can open doors in certain  <br/>
situations isn&#39;t the best kind of statement you can make to help  <br/>
yourself understand natural learning or to help anyone else  <br/>
understand it.<br/>
