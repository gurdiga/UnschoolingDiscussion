My family&#39;s going down the first weekend in March. What to do? Where to go? <br/>
What not to miss? We&#39;re staying @ St Petersburg Beach.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-436281221">Clearwater Beach is a nice spot. The beach itself is lovely and fairly unpopulated. Sand Key is just up (or down?) the road, a great place for shelling, especially sand dollars. There is a bird sanctuary that we found fasinating. There used to be a steel drum band at the big hotel at the south end of the beach....but that was a few years ago.<br/>
Hope you have a lovely trip!<br/>

I believe there is a Salvador Dali museum close by:<br/>

I missed out on it when we went to St. Pete Beach a few years ago...I <br/>
was with my mom and kids and we hadn&#39;t rented a car.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to Florida for our annual vacation that first weekend + <br/>
of March also since I&#39;m due w/baby #6 in July (I think I saw your <br/>
name on another list?).  It&#39;s DH&#39;s and DS&#39;s dream vacation...spring <br/>
training in Clearwater/Sarasota, and then for more family-oriented <br/>
stuff down in the Everglades.  I&#39;m really looking forward to it, esp. <br/>
the warmer weather!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Yes, Thank you----and everyone else for the helpful hints. <br/>
The Dali Museum is high on my list. We&#39;re also looking at the &quot;sponge tour&quot; <br/>
with the glass bottom boats. Busch Gardens,  the Aquarium, the Pier, and MOSI. <br/>
Don&#39;t know that we can do ALL of it in five days, but we&#39;ll try!<br/>
