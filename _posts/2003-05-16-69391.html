We&#39;ve spent a lot of time in dirt and mud recently, trying to get a garden <br/>

catching, seed scattering, hay strewing (and feeding to hobby horses).  Two <br/>
weeks of rain, flooded back yard, dead baby opossum on the deck. MUD on the <br/>
driveway.  Rolling and luxuriating in the mud.  My daughter (almost 4) got <br/>
stuck in her pjs the day it started raining - she had to check to make sure <br/>
it turned into mud.  Stripped down in the rain and made it back inside <br/>
without a whimper.  Slathered mud all over the steps and the kitchen walls <br/>
and went back to watching Sesame Street.  The seeds are sprouting, much <br/>
excitement.  More rain, spent time in Grandma&#39;s basement during a tornado <br/>
warning, got a cold, read lots of books.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also been weaving a baby blanket for a friend.  We set up the new to us <br/>
loom, learned how to live with it, wound a warp, tangled up a whole mess of <br/>
cotton yarn, sleyed the reed and threaded the heddles, wound bobbins for the <br/>
boat shuttles, measured out the progress, made a color spreadsheet of the <br/>
template and started weaving away.  The kids love being woken in the morning <br/>
to the sound of the loom, the soothing wood and metal.  They love shooting <br/>
the shuttle across and beating it in.  Unfortunately, they love to retie the <br/>
treadles, which can really mess up the pattern, but I&#39;ve learned to check it. <br/>
 Nathan has asked for a big boy blanket because he&#39;s turning 5 and no longer <br/>
chews on his blankie.  I need to learn to double weave.<br/>
<br/>
All this has brought life sciences, math, literature and great pleasure to <br/>
our lives.  Thanks for getting a new thread going, cluelessness is tiresome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706992235">We spent the whole morning at the beach.  My gf whose daughter is in <br/>
preschool got to play hooky and us and our combined group of 5 kids <br/>
went.  It was a beautiful day with a calm ocean!  We talked about the <br/>
tide and what makes the waves.  Keiran, 4 is getting more and more <br/>
comfortable and just laying in the waves and my 2yo let me take him <br/>
out swimming.  I can already see such a difference between our kids.  <br/>
Keiran is still innocent, trying to kiss her dd and she was <br/>
going &quot;yuck&quot;.  It was funny, Keiran hugs and kisses everyone with <br/>
NO &quot;romantic&quot; intent but she is already picking out boyfriends at <br/>
school.  She also uses terms like &quot;scaredy cat&quot;.  I took time to <br/>
explain that one to her!   Funny, because her mom would just say <br/>
thats not nice, but I really wanted her to understand that comment.  <br/>
Different parenting equals different kids, the real communication <br/>
makes such a big difference :)  <br/>
<br/>
I kept thinking how lucky we were that this was our life, not a day <br/>
off, not hooky.  My gf was laughing saying her daughter got ready <br/>
with no arguement this morning to go have a day off.  What she <br/>
probably does not realize is that while her daughter still has some <br/>
level of fun in school, she is already balking at going and all they <br/>
do is play all day.  She will most likely be in for some trouble when <br/>
real school starts.  Now me, I will be pleasantly collecting shells <br/>
with the boys :)<br/>
<br/>

..who needs a pool..I have the whole ocean :)<br/>
