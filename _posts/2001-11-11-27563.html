<div id="ygrps-yiv-150822567">Hey everybody,<br/>
I&#39;m fuming here and need to get some perspective on this situation before I<br/>
make a decsion.<br/>
<br/>
Early this afternoon a 10 yo neighbor boy came over asking to play with my<br/>
dd.  We were leaving in 1.5 hours to go to a Harry Potter party at the<br/>
library and invited him.  He informed me that he&#39;d leave a message for his<br/>
dad,  but that it would be fine.  I said I wanted him to talk to his<br/>
dad....to which he replied that he couldn&#39;t.   Turns out his mom is out of<br/>
town and his dad had taken his 8 yo brother fishing.....leaving him alone.<br/>
He assured me his dad wouldn&#39;t mind as long as he left a message saying<br/>
where he went.  I reluctantly agreed.  ( I also left a message with his<br/>
father to say that *surely* his son was mistaken that he had been left alone<br/>
and locked out of his own home,  but that if I didn&#39;t hear from him,  I was<br/>
taking his son with me so I knew he&#39;d be relatively safe.)Then he went home<br/>
to get his library card.<br/>
He returned without it,  saying he was locked out.  (My dd confirmed this<br/>
since she went with him.)<br/>
<br/>
So...the guy goes fishing with one child and locks the other one out????<br/>
GEEEEEZ.  I SO want to call CPS,  but am afraid of the retaliation from this<br/>
overgrown-adolescent-&#39;dad&#39;.  I tried to remain calm with the boy.  Later, I<br/>
was able to ask him if this is unusual.  He said no,  but usually his dad<br/>
leaves the back door unlocked.  My dd later informed me that just yesterday<br/>
the guy dropped both boys off on our street while he ran a few errands.   He<br/>
did not ask anyone to supervise his children or inform anyone that he was<br/>
not home.<br/>
<br/>
GRRR!  GRRR!  GRRR!</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder does this happen when the Mom is at home? I<br/>
might try to be helpful rather than call CPS which<br/>
could get the kids in more unhappy of a mess than they<br/>
already are if they really. I would be concerned it<br/>
get the kids in a foster care situation which does not<br/>
always guarantee a better situation for all kids. <br/>
<br/>
So I might connect up with the Mom when she gets back<br/>
and say. Your son got locked out of the house when you<br/>
were out of town. I would be happy to keep an xtra key<br/>
for the kids so they can get in the house when they<br/>
get locked out. Build a connection if you feel up to<br/>
it. That&#39;s what community is about isn&#39;t? It&#39;s what I<br/>
would hope I would have the courage to do. <br/>
<br/>
Absolutley do not threaten them ever that you will<br/>
call CPS. If you decide to they won&#39;t know who called<br/>
because CPS won&#39;t tell them. It&#39;s likely they will<br/>
suspect neighbors called on them. <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds likes a better solution to me.  Or something to let her know that this <br/>
went on and you are available to help in some small way.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, this is not that uncommon a situation.  <br/>
<br/>
My recent encounter:  A young boy (I though 6 or 7 yo, turned out he was 8 <br/>
(but he had to think about it!)) came to the door selling that school <br/>
fundraiser stuff (notice my ladylike restraint).  Alone!!!!<br/>
<br/>
It was one of the half-days of ps.  <br/>
<br/>
In our first encounter I asked where his Mom or Dad were -- &quot;Oh, Dad&#39;s at <br/>
work until 6:00 and Mom&#39;s at work too.&quot;  OK -- half day of school.  He&#39;s <br/>
alone until 6:00, from 1:00 on.  This was about 1:30 -- he could have been <br/>
missing until 6:00 before anyone even knew!<br/>
<br/>
Ack.  I did the wrong thing and told him to come back.<br/>
<br/>
I should have just had him wait out on the front deck.<br/>
<br/>
I called the school.  No, he was not supposed to be selling door to door.  <br/>
But, no, it was not the school&#39;s problem and there wasn&#39;t anything they could <br/>
do about it.  &quot;Well, the first words out of his mouth are that he&#39;s selling <br/>
this stuff for XYZ School.&quot;  No matter.<br/>
<br/>
So, he came back and I had him sit down out on the front deck and gave him a <br/>
good talking-to.  And he &quot;Yes ma&#39;am&quot;-ed me and seemed to be heading in the <br/>
direction of his house.  From what I gathered about 5-6 blocks away.  He also <br/>
claimed that nobody had ever told him that he shouldn&#39;t be going up to <br/>
strangers&#39; homes or that he shouldn&#39;t be out by himself.  He was 8 -- and <br/>
little -- I could have picked him up under one arm!<br/>
<br/>
Hope he made it home.  Should I have taken him home?  Who knows what I could <br/>
have been in trouble for in that case.  But it seemed wrong to send him off <br/>
alone.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the school is at fault for pumping these little kids up about the <br/>
trinkets they can win for selling enough of this junk.  And the parents are <br/>
at fault too.  <br/>
<br/>
But, as the school&#39;s assistant prin told me, this is not an uncommon thing.<br/>
<br/>
Vent over!<br/>
