<div id="ygrps-yiv-916616857">OH SHIT OH SHIT! I made a HUGE mistake!!<br/>
I am very very sorry!<br/>
Teresa, that was immature and nasty of me.<br/>
Please forgive me. I am really sorry, I thought someone was telling me to <br/>
chill and I responded before reading thouroughly. I relaly put my foot in my <br/>
mouth and may have hurt some feelings and I apologize. I am so embarrassed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639566408">I think Yol has already unsubbed.. Or maybe she did ignore the insult.  I <br/>
havnent talked to her about it.  I am surely not going to point it out to <br/>
her, that would add insult to injury.  And dont feel like you have to <br/>
apolgize to me, unless it sincere.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549643141">The apology was for the passive agressive response and it was to you because <br/>
I mentioned you. I put my foot in my mouth.<br/>
