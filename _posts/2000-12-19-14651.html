<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414290001">Hi Tiffany ...<br/>
<br/>
I agree w/ Robin, you&#39;ll find that unschooling fms are interested in SO MANY<br/>
THINGS in this life, so really, *anything* goes on this list; potty<br/>
training, pros/cons of spanking and daycare, you name it, it&#39;s been<br/>
discussed :)<br/>
<br/>
honestly, b-f&#39;ing posts brought back such great memories ...  my older dch<br/>
are grown and on their own and my younger boys (12/10) are well beyond the<br/>
bottle stage (they were bottle babies b/c we adopted and I didn&#39;t have<br/>
enough time to prepare or believe me, I WOULD HAVE!!!  SNIFF :::::::) ...<br/>
the post about snuggling by the Christmas lights REALLY got to me and also<br/>
the one about being KICKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT by tiny toes;<br/>
SNIFFFFFFFFFfffffff!!!   oh what precious memories I have of my precious<br/>
babies; b-f/bottle ...<br/>
<br/>
you *do* have a valid point though, Tiffany ... *sometimes* things discussed<br/>
on this list, or any other, don&#39;t interest us *personally* but might be<br/>
useful for someone else ... trust me, if you give us time and hang around<br/>
long enough something&#39;ll *snag* ya b/c this list talks about EVERYTHING<br/>
under the sun &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
happy day everyone ...<br/>
Pris ~&gt; back to lurking under her rock, shoot it&#39;s such a pretty day in TX I<br/>
just MIGHT come out and sit ON MY ROCK :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;       I am new here.  Please don&#39;t take offense, but isn&#39;t this an<br/>
&gt; unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; list???  I have not seen a post yet that had to do with unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know. Unschooling to me means learning from life, that there is no<br/>
&gt; clear delineating between &quot;schooling&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;, that learning can<br/>
&gt; happen anywhere and everywhere. Every post on this list is about life and<br/>
&gt; learning, and although some of the topics will not appeal to each of us,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found that overall there is much to be learned from the wisdom on<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; list.<br/>
