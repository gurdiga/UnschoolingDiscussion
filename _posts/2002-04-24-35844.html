&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;We are making a homophone chart.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not already doing it, this might be a good jumping-off point for <br/>
the history of the words (etymology is what word history is called, but the <br/>
kids might not want to know that just yet!).<br/>
<br/>
When there are homophones, either they were once pronounced differently, or <br/>
they came from two different languages.<br/>
<br/>
And what are homophones in one dialect won&#39;t be in another.  That might be <br/>
another side-collection to make.  We were watching an Australian movie the <br/>
other night and sometimes had to rewind just to see what they had said.  <br/>
Their homophone chart wouldn&#39;t look like ours.<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico, these three words are pronounced the same way:  Mary, merry, <br/>
marry<br/>
In New Jersey, they are not.<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico, you might have to ask if someone wants a stickin&#39; pin or a <br/>
writin&#39; pen.<br/>
<br/>
My third grade teacher (from somewhere in New England) tried to tell a bunch <br/>
of eight-year-old New Mexicans that the words &quot;year&quot; and &quot;ear&quot; were homonyms. <br/>
 We all looked at each other like she had said to eat our desks, and marked <br/>
them as homonyms just to humor her (and make the five points &lt;g&gt;), but we <br/>
knew she was loony about that one little thing.<br/>
