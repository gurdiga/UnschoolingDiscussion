<div id="ygrps-yiv-394739446">&lt;&lt; My point is that our families live far away.  We can&#39;t have <br/>
 grandparents or aunts and uncles at b-days.  Having a party is part <br/>
 of what made their day special when they were younger. &gt;&gt;<br/>

  I agree with this! Now that our family is spread out, the boys want to make <br/>
their day seem special, and I think that inviting friends over is how they do <br/>
it. I&#39;ve also noticed that as they get older they are wanting one or two <br/>
special friends to come over for the night instead of the big party thing...<br/>
