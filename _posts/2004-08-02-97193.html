<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105772281">&lt;&lt; Sometimes<br/>
<br/>
simple isn&#39;t going to be organic or non-toxic or politically correct, and<br/>
<br/>
sometimes with small children that&#39;s okay because being with them in peace<br/>
<br/>
and love is more important (sorry folks) than saving the world. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why is that a &quot;sorry folks&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I think a kid sitting in her patient mother&#39;s lap eating a twinkie is way <br/>
better off than one whose mom is a jittery wreck about the future of the <br/>
rainforest and is making her eat spotty apples with organic almond butter and drink <br/>
guava juice, and then the mom bursts into tears because of the war in Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
In the 50&#39;s, motherly self-righteousness seems to have involved clean stoves, <br/>
Pine-Sol-ed floors, and starched ironing, and kids were damaged or neglected <br/>
in the pursuit of those perfections.  Now I see moms intent on world-wide <br/>
level concerns while their kids are just wanting some direct interaction without <br/>
being told their interests are dangerous, ecologically unsound, politically <br/>
incorrect or serving corporate demons.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a kid might love a plastic pony whose eyes are too big.<br/>
It would be a true shame if a kid loved the pony more than the mom.<br/>

Maybe you meant something in your post that I am<br/>
missing, but this is not an either/or thing, either<br/>
happy and loved and filled with junk food or natural<br/>
diet and neurotic mother and ruined childhood.  Why<br/>
not a happy kid in a patient mother&#39;s lap eating an<br/>
all natural fruit snack and chocolate milk made with<br/>
homemade chocolate syrup.  If a mom has concerns about<br/>
the rainforest why does that make her a jittery wreck.<br/>
 Why would she automatically burst into tears because<br/>
of the war in Iraq unless she has a family member<br/>
serving there.  (I hope you don&#39;t actually know a<br/>
mother like the one you described.  That would be<br/>
pretty sad.)<br/>
<br/>
A mother is a whole person, who not only raises her<br/>
child, but also may have concerns about the world her<br/>
child is growing up in.  I am not just concerned about<br/>
the environment I am raising my child in at home, but<br/>
also the world he lives in now and will have to live<br/>
in as an adult.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now I see moms intent on world-wide level concerns<br/>
while their kids are just wanting some direct<br/>
interaction without being told their interests are<br/>
dangerous, ecologically unsound, politically <br/>
incorrect or serving corporate demons.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Direct interaction is about the mom and the child. <br/>
That is all that has to be present.  Now if the mom is<br/>
on the phone crusading all the time or spending all<br/>
her time at rallies and meetings with no time for her<br/>
kids that would be a bad thing.   <br/>
I am not a big fan of politically correct, but I would<br/>
certainly tell my child if something is dangerous. <br/>
Ecologically unsound?  I would not harp on this until<br/>
all the joy was sucked out of life, but I would<br/>
discuss my beliefs and feelings about this (although<br/>
if my child just wanted to cuddle I wouldn&#39;t say let&#39;s<br/>
talk about saving the planet instead).  I am not sure<br/>
what a kid might be interested in doing that would be<br/>
ecologically unsound.  And corporate demons? <br/>
Consumerism can be a big problem.  If my child is not<br/>
interested in having my values, I would at least like<br/>
him to have his own values, not what he has been<br/>
brainwashed into thinking from TV commercials whose<br/>
only interest is in selling a product.  If a child&#39;s<br/>
idea of direct interaction with mother is to go to the<br/>
store and buy as many toys that were seen on TV as<br/>
possible, then I guess there could be a problem in<br/>
more ways than one.  <br/>
I am not sure from your comments if you really have a<br/>
problem with people who follow a natural diet.  But<br/>
this is something I was thinking about in the<br/>
discussion about the three kids who are fighting too<br/>
much and the mom whose little girl has behavior<br/>
problems when she eats certain things.  A lot of<br/>
people, kids and adults, have food sensitivities<br/>
and/or food allergies that can cause behavior<br/>
problems.  Everyone talks about sugar and<br/>
hyperactivity, but I have no problem with sugar.  A<br/>
lot of what people think of having sugar in it<br/>
actually has corn syrup.  High fructose corn syrup is<br/>
everywhere and some people have corn allergies (my<br/>
nephew and I do).  Highly processed snacks and<br/>
convenience foods also contain a lot of artificial<br/>
colors and flavors and artificial colors in particular<br/>
can cause behavior problems.  A change in diet can<br/>
sometimes make a big difference in behavior.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Many jittery wrecks blame the rainforest or something else entirely out of <br/>
their control and then try to micromanage their children&#39;s lives to make up for <br/>
their free-floating frustrations.<br/>
<br/>
Some of them are unschoolers, and if someone lists priorities and the child&#39;s <br/>
happiness isn&#39;t in the top five or six, I worry.  If someone tries to assure <br/>
the list that she really cares about her child&#39;s future and so she has to stop <br/>
all wars and make sure all homesless are sheltered so that her child can be <br/>
happy, I think she&#39;s got screwy priorities.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an example, and it&#39;s made up, but it&#39;s based in experience.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not automatic.  When people work up a bundle of depression and fear of <br/>
the world and lack of control, they&#39;re often looking out and about at what they <br/>
would like to change instead of looking at their own personal wellbeing.   <br/>
Many people who try to over-control their children (and their environment, the <br/>
color of their toys, the material of which their toys are made, whether their <br/>
sheets and clothing are logo-free, etc.) are projecting some lack of control <br/>
and could probably do WAY better to look at emotional, direct human factors.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not an either or thing, but health food eaten in sorrow is less healthy <br/>
than junk eaten in joy.   In around those two vague data clumps are LOTS of <br/>
shades of emotion and other biological factors.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Everyone talks about sugar and<br/>
hyperactivity,-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some people look it up instead of going by the tales of daycare moms, and <br/>
find that studies have proven no connection between sugar and hyperactivity.  The <br/>
&quot;everyone&quot; talking about it should stop.<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I&#39;m having a hard time coming to terms with as a &quot;newbie&quot; on this list. I have 4 kids...7,5,3 and 18 months with baby #5 due in October. For the last several years I have been learning about Waldorf, and connected with a Waldorf community locally. There is so much I just love about Waldorf philosophy, and it really resonates within my soul as truth when I watch my children...and of course other parts I totally dismiss :)<br/>
 <br/>
Now that my oldest is 7, and I&#39;m rejecting using any kind of curriculum with her-including a Waldorf one, I&#39;m diving more into the unschooling world. What I&#39;m pondering lately is this concept that I keep hearing on this list that if parents choose to control certain things in their house they are automatically &quot;over controlling&quot; and are doing as SAndra&#39;s post says above. <br/>
 <br/>
There are some things that seem &quot;controlled&quot; by the parent, especially when kids are as young as mine are, by the simple fact that I make certain choices for *myself* and therefore this is what my kids are exposed to. For example, don&#39;t like many sweets, and I definitely see behavior changes in my children (no matter what people &quot;talk about&quot;) when they have certain food colorings and an extraordinary amount of sugar. But, mainly because I don&#39;t care for it it&#39;s just not in our house much, and my kids don&#39;t really know otherwise. They don&#39;t know twinkies exist, not because I wouldn&#39;t allow them to have one, but because I just don&#39;t buy them so they haven&#39;t been exposed to what they are. <br/>
 <br/>
However, if we have cake, ice cream or cookies in our home I would never consider telling them they couldn&#39;t eat any of it, nor do I try and limit it at all. They get it when they feel like eating some, and they stop when they&#39;re done. No big deal to me. <br/>
 <br/>
So..this is just one example, but to me this doesn&#39;t feel &quot;controlling&quot; at all. By the simple fact that I do the grocery shopping, I do have some control over what I buy. If anyone in our house has a request, husband or child, I will do my best to honor their request if money allows. My children just don&#39;t *know* to ask for anything other than what they&#39;ve been exposed to so far.<br/>
 <br/>
This example can be taken to media too. I don&#39;t watch much TV at all, and never do I watch during the daytime as it just doesn&#39;t interest me. Therefore, this is what my children have had modeled for them in their lives and they choose not to watch much TV either. I have never said &quot;no&quot; when they ask to watch, but after 30 minutes to one hour they are all up and playing somewhere again. It is rare that they would sit through a movie, it&#39;s like they just get bored with it. <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;limit&quot; TV over the years, but I didn&#39;t sit them down with a program guide and tell them all of the 599 channels we have to choose from either. So, like my previous example, they only know what we&#39;ve lived and they have lived with my influence as the caregiver home with them all day.<br/>
 <br/>
And, I admit, I do have issues with my young children being exposed to media (whether it&#39;s TV programs, commercials, etc) that is overly commercial, sexual, violent or just degrading in general. So, when they ask to watch TV I turn it on a non commercial channel, like PBS or Noggin to avoid commercials. OR, I record things on tivo and fast forward through the commercials (which they like to do anyway). They never, ever, ask for &quot;other&quot; channels...they don&#39;t know they exist really. So, I do not say &quot;no&quot;, but I&#39;m not exposing them to the whole line-up either. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve always not quite fit in with the Waldorf crowd, because in their &quot;opinion&quot; I give my children way too much freedom. Now, I&#39;m beginning to feel like I don&#39;t mesh with the unschoolers either because I &quot;control&quot; too much.<br/>
 <br/>
One last example would be video games. We don&#39;t play them, and my children have no idea what they even are. They&#39;ve never seen one/them and wouldn&#39;t know it if they did. The same with computer games....<br/>
 <br/>
It just seems that as they find out about these things on their own, they&#39;ll be ready to have them in their lives. But, if my child said they would really like a computer game, or video game, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to getting them one either. So, what&#39;s the balance? <br/>
 <br/>
I am in a good place now, where I&#39;m really thinking about my beliefs and what feels right with my children. Questioning why I do things the way I do, opening up for change. So, I welcome thoughts and comments to aid me in my process. Thanks to you all so much for reading all of this~<br/>

I do believe my<br/>

about chemical additives in highly processed foods. <br/>
Many of these have never been proven safe.  I am also<br/>
concerned about pesticides in our food and genitically<br/>
modified organisms (these aren&#39;t even called<br/>
genetically modified foods, they are &quot;organisms&quot;)<br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean that I micromanage my child&#39;s life<br/>
or I am trying to control external aspects of our<br/>
lives to make up for lack of control in my own life. <br/>
If you said you didn&#39;t feed your child Drano because<br/>
it is toxic, no one would think you were were<br/>
micromanaging or projecting your own lack of control<br/>
onto your child. <br/>
*********************************************************<br/>
Ok, <br/>
Diane has said some of what I wanted to say, and I totally agree with you here. I buy organic, healthy whole foods for many reasons. I believe it is the best way to nourish our bodies (just like I chose breastfeeding my children for the same reason), I like supporting the environment in this way, and frankly it&#39;s a less expensive way to feed our family. Less processed foods, more whole foods. <br/>
 <br/>
There are things I choose as a mother when they&#39;re babies, such as unassisted birth, breastfeeding, not vaccinating, cloth diapering, attachment parenting, co-sleeping, etc. I have made all of these decisions after much soul searching and thinking about what, intuitively, feels right for my child. It feels hard just to seemingly throw all of my values aside because my child is some certain age and expect them to understand all aspects and ramification of every decision they make. They can certainly understand a great deal (I see my now 7 yo having great comprehension of these issues) but not as completely as an adult can (when we&#39;re speaking of a 5 or 7 yo versus an adult). <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t expect my kids to understand *why* we eat organic food at their ages (7 and under)....I certainly explain it to them, but I don&#39;t get a sense that they can really and fully grasp an issue such as this at their age, so I make this decision for us. Just as I wouldn&#39;t hold up a bottle of formula next to my breast to an infant and expect them to choose, they wouldn&#39;t have the ability yet. I&#39;ve always felt that through modeling and sharing in non-judgemental ways *why* I make the choices that I do and then allowing them to come into thier own beliefs and choices as they grow seems natural. And allowing them to have different choices and beliefs than I do, this seems key to me too. <br/>
 <br/>
*BUT*, as a very close knit homeschooling family where I am thier main influence, at their age their choices are limited to what I&#39;ve exposed them too. And that was what my last post was about.... :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you&#39;re interpreting the unschooling idea of not controlling as giving them limitless options. It&#39;s certainly not, I couldn&#39;t afford that. It&#39;s simply letting their choices be their own. So, when your kids feel hungry they&#39;re free to eat and free to pick what they want to eat. It doesn&#39;t mean you supply them wth every food choice under the sun. <br/>
<br/>
And, I admit, I do have issues with my young children being exposed to media (whether it&#39;s TV programs, commercials, etc) that is overly commercial, sexual, violent or just degrading in general.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But the point is that if they asked to watch something different or wanted to watch the commercials, would you respect that choice? BTW, you&#39;ll likely find as I have that an unschooling kid with an active mind is not going to be unduly influenced by a TV commercial.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always not quite fit in with the Waldorf crowd, because in their &quot;opinion&quot; I give my children way too much freedom. Now, I&#39;m beginning to feel like I don&#39;t mesh with the unschoolers either because I &quot;control&quot; too much.<br/>

 <br/>
Your oldest is 7. Most kids aren&#39;t exposed to a lot of things before  &quot;school <br/>
age&quot;, so it&#39;s easy to keep things from them.<br/>
 <br/>
As your children get older and are exposed to new and, to them,  *really* <br/>
cool things, will you really and truly be ready to let them? It&#39;s easy  now <br/>
because of their ages. But in five years when your oldest is 12 and your  youngest <br/>
(so far) is four, will you be OK letting these &quot;outside,  UnWaldorfy&quot; things <br/>
intrude on the youngest&#39;s life? Will your oldest feel  &quot;cheated&quot; in that she <br/>
didn&#39;t get to play with video games or eat a Big Mac  or watch &quot;Ed, Edd, and <br/>
Eddy&quot; like all her friends?  And what about the  younger ones? Will you still be <br/>
protecting them to the same extent----or will  you be able to back off and <br/>
allow your oldest to bring the &quot;outside&quot; world&quot;  in?<br/>
 <br/>
Just a few questions to throw at you! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

It was an illustration.  There are as few people who love and cuddle  their <br/>
kids patiently while feeding them junk food as there are who stress about  the <br/>
rainforest and make their kids a nervous wreck.  <br/>
 <br/>
But I do know some of both.  If you&#39;re not one of them, good.   :)<br/>

You have  gone from talking moms who feed their kids<br/>

to moms who control the logo of their kids  sheets.  I<br/>
think these are two far different  categories.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Most of the moms I know who do one, often do the other. They seem to go  <br/>
hand-in-hand around here.<br/>
 <br/>
I live between two extremes---either bible-thumpers who  want keep their kids <br/>
from the spiritual evil outside world or crunchy  earthmoms who want to keep <br/>
their kids from the commercial evil outside  world! &lt;g&gt; Then there&#39;s ME, the <br/>
radical unschoolers! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can&#39;t agree that junk eaten happily is better  than<br/>
 </span></blockquote>healthy food eaten unhappily.    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Really? <br/>
 <br/>
If I want to happily eat a Big Mac followed by a  Twinkie and my husband <br/>
says, &quot;No, honey. I need you to stay healthy! I love  you! I&#39;ve made this <br/>
delicious plate of lentils and rice&quot;----which I HATE----I  can&#39;t even stand the smell <br/>
of them cooking! Well, I can tell you, for sure, that  I&#39;d be pretty <br/>
miserable. <br/>
 <br/>
Now, I can choose all, by MYSELF, to eat a salad with organic,  chemical-free <br/>
vegetables from my own garden----and eat it joyfully. But  when I want a <br/>
Snickers bar, well---that&#39;s what I want. If I&#39;m forced to eat one  of those nasty <br/>
carob wheat-free rocks because someone else thinks it&#39;s &quot;better&quot;  for <br/>
me,---well....  <br/>
 <br/>
Moms&#39; will shame their kids into eating only healthful foods. I see it all  <br/>
the time. There&#39;s a boy who goes to park with us. I often pick up fast food  <br/>
for me and Duncan. This child gets only organic vegetarian. That&#39;s  fine, if <br/>
it&#39;s his choice----but he continually asks whether he may have a  french fry or a <br/>
coke. No---it&#39;s carrot sticks and water because &quot;that *junk* is  bad for <br/>
you.&quot; Sad kid.<br/>
 <br/>
Better for a child (a PERSON) to understand what is best for his body, but  <br/>
to still be able to choose &quot;unhealthful&quot; foods than to eat only what someone  <br/>
else decides is acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Food eaten unhappily is<br/>

unhealthy it is still going to be unhealthy  no matter<br/>
what your emotional state is while eating  it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Sure, it&#39;ll still be unhealthful---and actually whether you believe it or  <br/>
NOT. But the point is that your emotional state is MORE important. And the  <br/>
relationship between a child and his mother is MORE important than ANY  food he <br/>
can put in his mouth.<br/>

simply  letting their choices be their own. So, when your kids feel hungry they&#39;re <br/>

My sons right now are living on a diet of chicken nuggets, chocolate, <br/>
cereal and milk and breastmilk.  (Depending on the kid!)  I was THRILLED <br/>
that they both had some mac and cheese yesterday.  But over time, the eat <br/>
well enough.  They are growing like weeds and are hugely healthy.  Those <br/>
chocolate bars are NOT GOING TO KILL THEM.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565658299">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So, what&#39;s the balance? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that parents do control some things just like you posted, by what<br/>
groceries they buy, by whether or not they like to go to the mall, by<br/>
whether or not they have a computer or more than one tv.<br/>
<br/>
I think the issues come up when the kids are old enough to be out on their<br/>
own, out from under mom&#39;s vision.  Is mom going to have a fit because the<br/>
11yo bought a gameboy with his birthday money?  Is mom going to have a fit<br/>
because 13yo watched an R movie at a friends&#39; house?<br/>
<br/>
I think the balance comes in when you have to work on meeting everyone&#39;s<br/>
desires and learning to control ourselves rather than others.  My dd is a<br/>
vegetarian but would never dream of telling the rest of us not to have meat.<br/>
I can&#39;t stand to spend time at the mall, but I take my dd when she asks.<br/>
<br/>
We eat healthy food at home, mostly organic because as a &quot;good mom&quot; I can&#39;t<br/>
see giving my kids something I think is bad for them.  I simply don&#39;t buy<br/>
it.  The kids eat what they want when they are out and about.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that is any different than someone who has issues around<br/>
alcohol not having alcohol in their home, not supplying to their kids.  My<br/>
kids have always been free to have any alcohol.  They choose not to.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Many people who try to over-control their children (and their<br/>
&gt;environment, the<br/>
&gt; &gt;color of their toys, the material of which their toys are made, &gt;whether<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; &gt;sheets and clothing are logo-free, etc.) are projecting some &gt;lack of<br/>
control<br/>
&gt; &gt;and could probably do WAY better to look at emotional, direct &gt;human<br/>
factors.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is what I&#39;m having a hard time coming to terms with as a &quot;newbie&quot; on<br/>
this list. I have 4 kids...7,5,3 and 18 months with baby #5 due in October.<br/>
For the last several years I have been learning about Waldorf, and connected<br/>
with a Waldorf community locally. There is so much I just love about Waldorf<br/>
philosophy, and it really resonates within my soul as truth when I watch my<br/>
children...and of course other parts I totally dismiss :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now that my oldest is 7, and I&#39;m rejecting using any kind of curriculum<br/>
with her-including a Waldorf one, I&#39;m diving more into the unschooling<br/>
world. What I&#39;m pondering lately is this concept that I keep hearing on this<br/>
list that if parents choose to control certain things in their house they<br/>
are automatically &quot;over controlling&quot; and are doing as SAndra&#39;s post says<br/>
above.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are some things that seem &quot;controlled&quot; by the parent, especially<br/>
when kids are as young as mine are, by the simple fact that I make certain<br/>
choices for *myself* and therefore this is what my kids are exposed to. For<br/>
example, don&#39;t like many sweets, and I definitely see behavior changes in my<br/>
children (no matter what people &quot;talk about&quot;) when they have certain food<br/>
colorings and an extraordinary amount of sugar. But, mainly because I don&#39;t<br/>
care for it it&#39;s just not in our house much, and my kids don&#39;t really know<br/>
otherwise. They don&#39;t know twinkies exist, not because I wouldn&#39;t allow them<br/>
to have one, but because I just don&#39;t buy them so they haven&#39;t been exposed<br/>
to what they are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, if we have cake, ice cream or cookies in our home I would never<br/>
consider telling them they couldn&#39;t eat any of it, nor do I try and limit it<br/>
at all. They get it when they feel like eating some, and they stop when<br/>
they&#39;re done. No big deal to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So..this is just one example, but to me this doesn&#39;t feel &quot;controlling&quot; at<br/>
all. By the simple fact that I do the grocery shopping, I do have some<br/>
control over what I buy. If anyone in our house has a request, husband or<br/>
child, I will do my best to honor their request if money allows. My children<br/>
just don&#39;t *know* to ask for anything other than what they&#39;ve been exposed<br/>
to so far.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This example can be taken to media too. I don&#39;t watch much TV at all, and<br/>
never do I watch during the daytime as it just doesn&#39;t interest me.<br/>
Therefore, this is what my children have had modeled for them in their lives<br/>
and they choose not to watch much TV either. I have never said &quot;no&quot; when<br/>
they ask to watch, but after 30 minutes to one hour they are all up and<br/>
playing somewhere again. It is rare that they would sit through a movie,<br/>
it&#39;s like they just get bored with it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t &quot;limit&quot; TV over the years, but I didn&#39;t sit them down with a<br/>
program guide and tell them all of the 599 channels we have to choose from<br/>
either. So, like my previous example, they only know what we&#39;ve lived and<br/>
they have lived with my influence as the caregiver home with them all day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And, I admit, I do have issues with my young children being exposed to<br/>
media (whether it&#39;s TV programs, commercials, etc) that is overly<br/>
commercial, sexual, violent or just degrading in general. So, when they ask<br/>
to watch TV I turn it on a non commercial channel, like PBS or Noggin to<br/>
avoid commercials. OR, I record things on tivo and fast forward through the<br/>
commercials (which they like to do anyway). They never, ever, ask for<br/>
&quot;other&quot; channels...they don&#39;t know they exist really. So, I do not say &quot;no&quot;,<br/>
but I&#39;m not exposing them to the whole line-up either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always not quite fit in with the Waldorf crowd, because in their<br/>
&quot;opinion&quot; I give my children way too much freedom. Now, I&#39;m beginning to<br/>
feel like I don&#39;t mesh with the unschoolers either because I &quot;control&quot; too<br/>
much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One last example would be video games. We don&#39;t play them, and my children<br/>
have no idea what they even are. They&#39;ve never seen one/them and wouldn&#39;t<br/>
know it if they did. The same with computer games....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It just seems that as they find out about these things on their own,<br/>
they&#39;ll be ready to have them in their lives. But, if my child said they<br/>
would really like a computer game, or video game, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to<br/>
getting them one either. So, what&#39;s the balance?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am in a good place now, where I&#39;m really thinking about my beliefs and<br/>
what feels right with my children. Questioning why I do things the way I do,<br/>
opening up for change. So, I welcome thoughts and comments to aid me in my<br/>
process. Thanks to you all so much for reading all of this~<br/>

I cannot in good conscience force the kids to live the way I want to.  As an<br/>

So the  way we work it is that I don&#39;t buy junk food.  The kids get a<br/>
generous amount of spending money and they are welcome to buy it or have it<br/>
when over at a friends&#39; house, etc..  I also work to make sure that the<br/>
healthy food I serve is stuff they like.  This morning we had whole wheat<br/>
pancakes made with honey, our own free-range eggs, applesauce and whole raw<br/>
milk from our own goats.  I go out of my way to make sure the stuff is<br/>
healthy and palatable but if the kids want a pop-tart they are going to have<br/>
to pop for it themselves.<br/>

&gt; relationship between a child and his mother is MORE important than ANY<br/>
food he<br/>
&gt; can put in his mouth.<br/>

There  are things I choose as a mother when they&#39;re babies, such as <br/>
unassisted birth,  breastfeeding, not vaccinating, cloth diapering, attachment <br/>
parenting,  co-sleeping, etc. I have made all of these decisions after much soul <br/>
searching  and thinking about what, intuitively, feels right for my child. It feels <br/>
hard  just to seemingly throw all of my values aside because my child is some <br/>
 certain age and expect them to understand all aspects and ramification of  <br/>
every decision they make. They can certainly understand a great deal (I see my  <br/>
now 7 yo having great comprehension of these issues) but not as completely as <br/>
 an adult can (when we&#39;re speaking of a 5 or 7 yo versus an adult).  &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
ANd when they become parents, how will you feel if they decide to  C-section, <br/>
bottle-feed, vaccinate, disposable diaper, spank, and use  cribs?<br/>
 <br/>
They need to be allowed to make their own decisions without your shaming  <br/>
them or their upsetting you. Will you be OK in five years when things (and their  <br/>
ideas) may change?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  How to they get to the point where they do understand though? Experience. If you (a general you, not specificly you) deny them choice you deny them the experience they&#39;ll need later. My daughter  (6)knows from experience that sugary junk food does nothing to satisfy her hunger so she can make informed choices about what to eat when she is hungry. For me, the experience and learning that comes from letting them choose chocolate and cheesies for a lunch will lead to a much healthier lifestyle and attitude down the road. I wonder if sometimes in our worry about keeping our kids healthy today we don&#39;t hurt them when they are out on their own.<br/>
<br/>
   I don&#39;t expect my kids to understand *why* we eat organic food at their ages (7 and under)....I certainly explain it to them, but I don&#39;t get a sense that they can really and fully grasp an issue such as this at their age, so I make this decision for us. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My daughter, after a horrible night where she couldn&#39;t get to sleep, understands why chocolate doesn&#39;t work as a bedtime snack. She knows peanut butter sandwiches are good cavity causers because they sit on her teeth all night and understands that cheese has lots of protein that fills her up. So her bedtime snack choice is usually cheese. Maybe your kids aren&#39;t getting enough credit?<br/>
<br/>
  Just as I wouldn&#39;t hold up a bottle of formula next to my breast to an infant and expect them to choose, they wouldn&#39;t have the ability yet. I&#39;ve always felt that through modeling and sharing in non-judgemental ways *why* I make the choices that I do and then allowing them to come into thier own beliefs and choices as they grow seems natural. And allowing them to have different choices and beliefs than I do, this seems key to me too.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;snipped &lt;There are some things that seem &quot;controlled&quot; by the parent,<br/>
especially when kids are as young as mine are, by the simple fact that I<br/>
make certain choices for *myself* and therefore this is what my kids are<br/>
exposed to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering really about the exposure that the children get to things<br/>
that aren&#39;t chosen by you. My children are now 18, 9, 8 and 3. There are<br/>
many things they don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; about because I&#39;ve chosen, for one reason or<br/>
another not to have or do. And this is mainly for the 3 younger kids.<br/>
Personal issues, money matters, just not knowing of things myself, etc. I<br/>
don&#39;t see how anyone can expose themselves to everything there is in the<br/>
world. BUT, my kids know about so many things that we don&#39;t have or haven&#39;t<br/>
done or watched or read, etc. It just comes from being out in the world and<br/>
having friends and visiting places and families. Even my 3 year old will<br/>
come and tell me about a little friend and what they ate or watched or where<br/>
they went. That&#39;s life. Unless the children are never exposed to kids doing<br/>
anything different than themselves, don&#39;t they just naturally learn all<br/>
about that other stuff without you showing them?<br/>
<br/>
And my children have no schooling friends at all. That&#39;s not really because<br/>
I chose that, it just worked out that way. They have a nice group of all<br/>
homeschooling children that we see regularly and other homes we go to. If I<br/>
chose no TV or even just PBS or something, I still can&#39;t see how my kids<br/>
wouldn&#39;t know about Disney and YuGiOh and That&#39;s So Raven, etc.!! They<br/>
really come to me constantly about things they saw or heard and just full of<br/>
questions of topics that are *new* to them.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;  What I&#39;m pondering lately is this concept that I keep hearing on this <br/>
list that if parents choose to control certain things in their house they are <br/>
automatically &quot;over controlling&quot; and are doing as SAndra&#39;s post says above.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not doing what I wrote, then you&#39;re not.  There&#39;s not an <br/>
&quot;Automatically.&quot;  <br/>
There is such a thing as over control.<br/>
There is such a thing as controlling because it feels good.<br/>
There are examples all around of us of families who choose toys because they <br/>
look good on the shelf, and limit toys because the shelf is full.   Home <br/>
decorating takes precedence over child development in some families.  Friends of <br/>
ours only allowed primary color toys, not pastels.  They wanted all toys to <br/>
match the decor.<br/>
<br/>
Someone on one of these lists said her mother would re-wrap any Christmas <br/>
gifts that didn&#39;t match her tree color scheme, in paper that matched it.  That&#39;s <br/>
a burst of control beyond my personal ability for sure.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There are some things that seem &quot;controlled&quot; by the parent, especially <br/>
when kids are as young as mine are, by the simple fact that I make certain <br/>
choices for *myself* and therefore this is what my kids are exposed to. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the kind of control to which I objected.   The logical (meaning <br/>
analagous, ultimate, parallel, not &quot;sensible&quot;) extension of that would be the <br/>
idea that a parent would say to a three year old, &quot;Would you rather watch <br/>
Barney&#39;s Birthday Special or Women of WalMart?&quot;  (Kirby got that for his 18th <br/>
birthday from a female friend who works at a video store and thought he would be <br/>
amused.  The Walmart women aren&#39;t wearing their work smocks...)   <br/>
<br/>
Of course there are natural limitations in homes.  I don&#39;t have much country <br/>
music.  I have a fair amount of really OLD country and old-timey stuff, 40&#39;s <br/>
and before, but not current popular C&W because it gags me.  But if I had a kid <br/>
who liked it I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Not in my house.&quot;  Yet they&#39;ve &quot;been exposed to&quot; <br/>
dozens of musical styles in some depth and breadth, live and video and <br/>
recordings, over the years.  Yet I didn&#39;t provide the top 40 Country updates.<br/>
<br/>
-=- For example, don&#39;t like many sweets, and I definitely see behavior <br/>
changes in my children (no matter what people &quot;talk about&quot;) when they have certain <br/>
food colorings and an extraordinary amount of sugar. -=-<br/>
<br/>
People often see what they want to see.  I&#39;m saying nothing about food <br/>
colorings, but the  prevailing &quot;wisdom&quot; that sugar causes kids to be hyper has been <br/>
disproven in tests with moms who were sure it was true, and found they were <br/>
falsely characterizing an outside agent for the sake of saying no to their <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They don&#39;t know twinkies exist, not because I wouldn&#39;t allow them to have <br/>
one, but because I just don&#39;t buy them so they haven&#39;t been exposed to what <br/>
they are. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly discovered Twinkies last year, watching a rented DVD of Howdy Doody <br/>
shows, and it was the black and white advertisement when Twinkies were first <br/>
created in the 50&#39;s.  They really looked awful in B&W so they were described by <br/>
Buffalo Bob in words, but still not appealing. &lt;g&gt;   I didn&#39;t hide Twinkies from <br/>
her.  I haven&#39;t avoided cookie aisles.  She&#39;s just always had enough food she <br/>
liked that she wasn&#39;t out scouting something more, something flashier, <br/>
something sweeter.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However, if we have cake, ice cream or cookies in our home I would never <br/>
consider telling them they couldn&#39;t eat any of it, nor do I try and limit it at <br/>
all. They get it when they feel like eating some, and they stop when they&#39;re <br/>
done. No big deal to me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Same as here.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am in a good place now, where I&#39;m really thinking about my beliefs and <br/>
what feels right with my children. Questioning why I do things the way I do, <br/>
opening up for change. So, I welcome thoughts and comments to aid me in my <br/>
process. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t also read at unschooling.com and sandradodd.com/unschooling <br/>
there are lots of ideas there.  About parenting and unschooling (another set of <br/>
considerations), collections of some of the best posts and little articles are <br/>

It&#39;s not the only one right way, but it&#39;s a way most people had never <br/>
considered.<br/>

Crying and eating at the same time hardly works at all, but kids all over the <br/>
country are shamed to tears, somewhere, every moment of every day.  I hope <br/>
it&#39;s not as bad as it was when I was little, but I know it still happens.  Kids <br/>
are forced to eat what they don&#39;t want, and after it&#39;s cold, and sometimes <br/>
it&#39;s brought out again for the next meal.<br/>

Sadness and sorrow aren&#39;t good for digestion.<br/>

They&#39;re also not good for a peaceful, loving relationship between a mother <br/>

They can both be in the same category of over-controlling the environment for <br/>
a hoped-for magical effect.<br/>

never a good thing,  but if you believe junk food is<br/>
unhealthy it is still going to be unhealthy  no matter<br/>
what your emotional state is while eating  it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you mean to say it&#39;s the belief that makes it unhealthy?<br/>
<br/>
Kelly wrote this, and it&#39;s exactly what I meant:<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440709537">I struggled with this &quot;non-control&quot; issue too - especially in regards to media exposure and food.  At first, every thing I read seemed scary and like I was expected to give my child EVERY option under the sun.  I have slowly begun to realize that this is not necessarily the case.  It is allowing my child(ren) to have choices based on the available options while being open to exploring and discovering new options.  At least, that is where my thoughts have evovled to at this point.... :)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think of it as controlling unless you say &quot;heck no&quot; without any sincere consideration (and darned solid reason) as to why you are saying &quot;no&quot;...  I have learned how to say &quot;yes&quot; and explore things with my daughter.  I have learned a new way of approaching things.  Instead of saying &quot;we can&#39;t&quot;, I am learning how to say &quot;how can we...?&quot;  I think that I am learning just as much as my daughter in this process!  <br/>
<br/>
I keep trying to remind myself of the things I want my daughter to learn, see, experience, think, believe, etc...  I want her to be strong, independant, creative, caring, compassionate, and a SMART risk-taker/mistake-maker.  I don&#39;t want her to grow up with the fear, guilt, opression, and anxiety I have experienced in my own life.  To do that, I need to model these things and even change the way I think and look at a problem.    It is sometimes very painful, but a good kind of pain...<br/>

infant and expect them to choose, they wouldn&#39;t have the ability yet. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had to chuckle at this image. A couple of women in our playgroup have been<br/>
trying to get their infant to accept bottles so that they can get a break,<br/>
or a chance to go to the store and not have Daddy unable to feed baby if<br/>
needed. (Not something I ever aspired to - Jayn has never had a bottle).<br/>
They have gotten to the point that the babies will take one fairly easily<br/>
from their fathers or other caregivers, but when Mom is there they just want<br/>
breast, and will bat the bottle away. Sounds like a strong ability to choose<br/>
to me.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I know, it struck me, too.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
I would really like to take Will to see the Yankees play in Yankee Stadium  <br/>
on our way to Boston for the conference.  The only tickets left were $80,  <br/>
each.  We would have to give up something else we wanted to do (maybe Cedar  Point <br/>
or the whale watch or something else) in order to be able to afford the  game <br/>
at Yankee Stadium.  We decided to look at the schedule and see where  else <br/>
they might be playing, and it turns out they&#39;re playing in Cleveland 4 days  <br/>
before the conference, and the tickets were only $20 each.  So the natural,  <br/>
concrete contraints of limited funds caused me to look for another way to get  <br/>
what I want (to take Will to see the Yankees).  Because *I* am not the one  <br/>
making the decision, but we are being &quot;coerced&quot; by the contraints of money, Will  <br/>
is not bothered by the fact he won&#39;t be able to see Yankee Stadium, and is <br/>
happy  to see them play in Cleveland.  <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s a real life example.  But I remember the exact example where  this <br/>
became clear to me.  It was the classic &quot;toddler not willing to  get in the car <br/>
seat&quot;, but mom coerced her into the seat because she had a  doctor&#39;s <br/>
appointment.  The mom coerced the toddler because of the time  coercion of the doctor&#39;s <br/>
appointment.  The TCS/NCP adherents would reject  and rebuff that coercion <br/>
which might lead them to coerce their child, by  cancelling the appointment or <br/>
not showing up.   Usually my time  coercion issues are not about something <br/>
involving other people, but just a  desire to get something &quot;done&quot; in a reasonable <br/>
amount of time, or, &quot;I&#39;d like to  be in bed by 10:00 tonight because I&#39;m <br/>
tired, so would you PLEASE come up and go  to bed so I can help you get to sleep?&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Like Sandra, I don&#39;t believe TCS/NCP is practical.  However, the idea  that <br/>
outside forces (time, money) can cause me to react in negative way towards  my <br/>
self and others is simply profound.  I believe the coercion of time  and money <br/>
can be removed from most situations.  Even if it can&#39;t, it&#39;s  easier to make <br/>
hard decisions when what is coercing me is  idenitified.<br/>

&lt;&lt; We eat healthy food at home, mostly organic because as a &quot;good mom&quot; I can&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
see giving my kids something I think is bad for them.  I simply don&#39;t buy<br/>
<br/>
it.  The kids eat what they want when they are out and about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think that is any different than someone who has issues around<br/>
<br/>
alcohol not having alcohol in their home, not supplying to their kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same because alcohol is illegal and known to cause <br/>
much death both directly and indirectly.  &quot;Issues&quot; around alcohol isn&#39;t the same <br/>
as &quot;issues&quot; around non-organic food.  And what is certified organic isn&#39;t <br/>
always superior to what&#39;s locally grown without the bothering of getting certified <br/>
organic.  A tomato from my neighbor&#39;s back yard is probably better for me <br/>
than an organic tomato grown in an organic hydroponic greenhouse and then shipped <br/>
six states away where it sat in a truck, then a warehouse and then a grocery <br/>
store.    But my neighbor&#39;s yard isn&#39;t &quot;certified organic.&quot;  (I have tomatoes <br/>
in my own back yard, likewise non-pedigreed or degreed, but for the sake of <br/>
example...)<br/>

It is natural.<br/>

The problem is when it is judgmental and restrictive and the mom is more <br/>
concerned with what&#39;s in the food that with what&#39;s in her child&#39;s emotional <br/>

&lt;&lt; Like Sandra, I don&#39;t believe TCS/NCP is practical.  However, the idea  <br/>
that <br/>
outside forces (time, money) can cause me to react in negative way towards  <br/>
my <br/>
self and others is simply profound.  I believe the coercion of time  and <br/>
money <br/>
can be removed from most situations.  Even if it can&#39;t, it&#39;s  easier to make <br/>
hard decisions when what is coercing me is  idenitified. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of big words. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I see it as &quot;try to get to &#39;yes&#39;&quot; and Joyce wrote something very cool about <br/>
this which I saved here:<br/>

<br/>
(and some other voices are there too)<br/>
<br/>
Often parents say &quot;can&#39;t&quot; when they mean &quot;don&#39;t want to be bothered.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s a way to &quot;no,&quot; and a cushiony justification for &quot;no&quot; because it&#39;s <br/>
easier to say no.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a passage from an otherwise unrelated article:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wed, Jul 28, 1993<br/>
The first thing [Marty] said after “good morning” was “Mom, if you count to <br/>
infinity, is it illegal?”<br/>
<br/>
I explained to him about infinity, with a million plus one and a “gadillion” <br/>
plus one. He was fine with the explanation, and I said, “Who told you you <br/>
can’t count to infinity?” He said I did, so I explained the difference in things <br/>
that are impossible and things that are illegal (have consequences).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can&#39;t&quot; sounds pretty permanent. We were careful not to say, in our kids&#39; <br/>
hearing &quot;Marty can&#39;t read.&quot; We would cheerfully say, &quot;Marty doesn&#39;t read yet&quot; (or <br/>
Kirby, or Holly). With that, every time it was discussed we were clearly <br/>
indicating that we thought the child WOULD read before long, and it was not a <br/>
concern. They were certainly learning in many other ways, as anyone close enough <br/>
to discuss their reading could see! <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/persephonics">http://sandradodd.com/r/persephonics</a><br/>
<br/>
(but it&#39;s about reading, not about coercion, or maybe they tie in anyway!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731492614">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;One last example would be video games. We don&#39;t play them, and my<br/>
children have no idea what they even are. They&#39;ve never seen one/them and<br/>
wouldn&#39;t know it if they did. The same with computer games....<br/>
 <br/>
It just seems that as they find out about these things on their own, they&#39;ll<br/>
be ready to have them in their lives. But, if my child said they would<br/>
really like a computer game, or video game, I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to getting<br/>
them one either. So, what&#39;s the balance? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sparked some thoughts in me. , about strewing and Unschooling and what<br/>
happens if we are leaving children to find out about things &quot;on their own&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Strewing is deliberately choosing to make available stuff, activities,<br/>
games, technologies, people that the kids might be interested in now or<br/>
soon. It is proactive, not passive.  <br/>
<br/>
Suppose some parents didn&#39;t like horses. They don&#39;t ride them, and they<br/>
don&#39;t live in the country. They rarely watch tv, and don&#39;t ever mention that<br/>
there is a show called &quot;Mr. Ed&quot; (showing my age), and incidentally don&#39;t<br/>
have the Westerns channel.  They don&#39;t go to the petting zoo where there are<br/>
foals, or the circus with trick riders, maybe specifically avoiding them, or<br/>
maybe just because it never came up. It actually takes work to keep<br/>
something this ubiquitous on the fringes of life.<br/>
<br/>
By chance the kid, at some older age, happens to make friends with a girl in<br/>
a pony club, and it sparks a fantastic interest. The kid is amazed that<br/>
there is this huge culture about horses, and there are games like Barbie<br/>
Horse Rescue, and it is an Olympic sport, and there is controversy about the<br/>
evolution of horses, and different riding styles, and a whole culture of<br/>
clothes and saddles and leather work, and breeds and movies, and the role of<br/>
horses in wars and history....and on and on. Connections unlimited. The kids<br/>
find out that they have a talent for, or enjoyment of, riding, and maybe<br/>
feel resentful that they missed out on years of being part of this culture.<br/>
<br/>
Computer/video games are as broad a category as horses - there are lots of<br/>
variations, not one homogenous type of game. The experience of unschooled<br/>
children, as described repeatedly on these lists, is so overwhelmingly<br/>
positive, so full of fantastic learning, skills building, social interaction<br/>
through commonality of interests, connections to other areas of interest,<br/>
fun, fun, fun. It seems like deliberately withholding knowledge of this is a<br/>
shame. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling in ACTION. Strew some stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260579587">&lt;&lt;&lt;But I don&#39;t think<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; alcoholic beverages should be equated non-certified produce.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then don&#39;t equate it at your house.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t eat &quot;certified produce&quot; here either.  We eat stuff I grew in an<br/>
organic manner from organic seed fertilized by our organically fed goats.<br/>
<br/>
All families are different and the issues they are dealing with are<br/>
different.  Alcohol supplied to children by their parents isn&#39;t illegal in<br/>
Texas for one thing.  Secondly, my young son has Hepatitis and anything I<br/>
can do to ease the job his overworked little liver is forced to do, the<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
If he was into alcohol, I would refuse to buy it for him for his safety.<br/>
Not all Hepatitis carriers who drink will have a bad reaction.  He was into<br/>
highly processed, chemically laden food.  As I have educated myself on the<br/>
liver and nutrition, I refused to buy something that I thought might shorten<br/>
his life.  Not every Hepatits carrier who eats junk food will have a bad<br/>
reaction.<br/>
<br/>
People who have lost a child to a predator will be much more<br/>
watchful/paranoid than people who have never ran across that in real life.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was a highway patrolman.  He saw enough dead kids to last a lifetime<br/>
and he is an absolute fanatic about seatbelts at all times, no matter what,<br/>
period.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, some people are just nuts &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; We eat healthy food at home, mostly organic because as a &quot;good mom&quot; I<br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; see giving my kids something I think is bad for them.  I simply don&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; it.  The kids eat what they want when they are out and about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think that is any different than someone who has issues around<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; alcohol not having alcohol in their home, not supplying to their kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same because alcohol is illegal and known to cause<br/>
&gt; much death both directly and indirectly.  &quot;Issues&quot; around alcohol isn&#39;t<br/>
the same<br/>
&gt; as &quot;issues&quot; around non-organic food.  And what is certified organic isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; always superior to what&#39;s locally grown without the bothering of getting<br/>
certified<br/>
&gt; organic.  A tomato from my neighbor&#39;s back yard is probably better for me<br/>
&gt; than an organic tomato grown in an organic hydroponic greenhouse and then<br/>
shipped<br/>
&gt; six states away where it sat in a truck, then a warehouse and then a<br/>
grocery<br/>
&gt; store.    But my neighbor&#39;s yard isn&#39;t &quot;certified organic.&quot;  (I have<br/>
tomatoes<br/>
&gt; in my own back yard, likewise non-pedigreed or degreed, but for the sake<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; example...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
How did you all arrive at the conclusion that emotional wellbeing was more important than so many other factors?<br/>
<br/>
Not that I disagree, I&#39;m just curious how unschooling evolved into placing so much emphasis on emotional wellbeing.<br/>
