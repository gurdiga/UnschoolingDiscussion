           -- Views from the world of learning in Japan --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the 20 February 2001 edition of KnoK (pronounced &quot;knock&quot;) <br/>
NEWS, an informal and periodic bulletin concerning issues of learning in <br/>
Japan. It is brought to you by the Covert family -- Kazumi, Kenya and <br/>
Brian -- a multicultural, homelearning family in Osaka, Japan.<br/>
<br/>
KnoK stands for *Kodomo no Kokoro*, meaning &quot;Heart of a Child&quot; in <br/>
Japanese. It is our belief that the heart of any child is indeed at the <br/>
center of true learning, wherever and however such learning may take <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
              &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDITOR&#39;S WELCOME:  We&#39;re back!! After a few months&#39; hiatus, KnoK NEWS is <br/>
on the beat in February and ready to run again with this first edition of <br/>
the new century.<br/>
<br/>
The year 2001 is the &quot;Year of the Snake&quot; according to the Japanese <br/>
calendar, and as the snake is the symbol in many cultures of change and <br/>
transformation (&quot;shedding one&#39;s skin&quot;), we can only hope that the coming <br/>
months of this year will be one of positive transition for the <br/>
homelearning movement in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
2000 saw us off to a good start: The news media here covered home <br/>
education in Japan more extensively than ever last year, and the coverage <br/>
was mostly respectful and accepting in tone. Alternative forms of <br/>
education in Japan such as free schools and community-based learning <br/>
centers have been getting fairly positive press as well, and that is <br/>
indeed something to be thankful for.<br/>
<br/>
Japan is seeing a slow but steady rise in the numbers of homelearning <br/>
families nationwide who are turning away from school and embracing <br/>
education at home (2,000 to 3,000 homelearners nationwide by &quot;unofficial&quot; <br/>
counts, possibly more). We are even starting to hear firsthand of cases <br/>
in which Japanese school officials are cooperating fully with Japanese <br/>
families who declare their intention to homelearn -- a good sign. Perhaps <br/>
the educrats in Japan, like other countries, have merely run out of ideas <br/>
on how to regulate the spirit of learning to death. But whatever the <br/>
reason, there is no denying that Japanese homelearners are moving in a <br/>
forward direction in society. <br/>
<br/>
The more we at KnoK NEWS look around at the barren state of mainstream <br/>
education in Japan, in fact, the more we find a new, budding &quot;oasis&quot; in <br/>
the form of yet another homelearning family here, another alternative <br/>
school there, and on and on. So it seems only fitting that we devote this <br/>
edition of KnoK NEWS to these oases of sanity -- small and scattered, but <br/>
strong in spirit -- that are, in their own ways, changing the face of <br/>
education in Japan for the better.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we want to thank KnoK NEWS readers for your continued interest <br/>
in what we are doing, and ask for your understanding in the future as we <br/>
try to more effectively work our newsletter schedule in with our <br/>
homelearning activities. (Or is that a contradiction in terms?  &lt;g&gt; )<br/>
 <br/>
As always, feel free to pass this newsletter around and share it with <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
<br/>

BOOK REVIEWS:<br/>
<br/>

*Kodomo ga Gakko ni Ikitaku-naku natta Toki Yomu Hon*<br/>
[The Book to Read When Your Child No Longer Wants to Go to School]<br/>
Keiko Itoh, et al, translators<br/>
Marunouchi Shuppan/Atmark Learning Inc., 2000<br/>
287 pp., 1,500 yen<br/>
<br/>
Despite its eye-catching title, this newest book on home-based learning <br/>
to hit the bookstore shelves here in Japan is not an original piece of <br/>
work. Rather, it is a Japanese translation of the book &quot;Homeschooling <br/>
Almanac 2000-2001,&quot; published in 1999 by Mary Leppert and Michael <br/>
Leppert, the well-known US homelearners. While the Japanese version of <br/>
the Lepperts&#39; excellent book is abridged (only Part 1 of the original is <br/>
translated), it does manage to cover many of the important questions and <br/>
answers that slowly increasing numbers of families in Japan are facing as <br/>
they turn away from conventional schooling.<br/>
<br/>
This new book stands in good company with various other <br/>
Japanese-translated versions of English-language homelearning books, such <br/>
as John Holt&#39;s &quot;Teach Your Own,&quot; &quot;School is Not Compulsory&quot; by Education <br/>
Otherwise, &quot;The Homeschooling Book of Answers&quot; by Linda Dobson, and &quot;Home <br/>
Schooling: Parents as Educators&quot; by Maralee Maybery, et al.   <br/>
<br/>
We welcome this newly translated book as the latest addition to the <br/>
Japanese homelearning community, and we hope it fosters an even greater <br/>
awareness of homelearning throughout Japan in the coming years.<br/>
<br/>
If there is any drawback at all to this book, though, it would be the <br/>
lack of transparency concerning the background of its promoters/supporters.<br/>
<br/>
On the front-cover promotional overleaf of this book, an organization <br/>
called the Homeschool Support Association of Japan (HoSA) <br/>
(http://www.homeschool.ne.jp/) heartily endorses this new book as being <br/>
&quot;necessary reading for those who are confronted by the various study <br/>
needs of children&quot; (translation from Japanese). What is not revealed <br/>
anywhere in this book is that promoter HoSA, a nonprofit organization, is <br/>
itself essentially a creation of the co-publisher of this book, Atmark <br/>
Learning Inc. (http://www.inter-highschool.ne.jp/)<br/>
<br/>
Atmark, a Tokyo-based for-profit corporation that suddenly appeared on <br/>
the Japanese homeschooling scene early in 2000, specializes in offering <br/>
&quot;American-style&quot; high school studies to Japanese students on the Internet <br/>
through a tie-up with the Alger Learning Center & Independence High <br/>
School, an academic institution in Washington state, USA.<br/>
<br/>
HoSA bills itself as an independent home-ed support association, yet <br/>
HoSA&#39;s official list of supporters is overwhelmingly from the twin fields <br/>
of industry and academia in Japan: heads of corporations (such as <br/>
Microsoft Japan) and some Japanese university-level academics with clout. <br/>
Only one genuine homelearner from Japan&#39;s grassroots homelearning <br/>
community is listed as a HoSA official supporter. <br/>
<br/>
Atmark and HoSA also have a common founder and leader: Mr. Kozo Hino, a <br/>
Japanese businessman with a background in education-related enterprises. <br/>
It is he who writes the inspiring afterword of the Japanese version of <br/>
this book. Yet these connections are never revealed to the reader. <br/>
<br/>
We certainly applaud the presence of this new book on Japanese bookstore <br/>
shelves and would recommend that people read it. But at the same time, we <br/>
would like to see the direct connections between HoSA, as an &quot;official&quot; <br/>
support group, and Atmark, as its corporate parent, made more transparent <br/>
in future editions of this book. <br/>

*Creating Learning Communities*<br/>
Ron Miller, editor<br/>
The Foundation for Educational Renewal, Inc., 2000<br/>
380 pp., $29.95<br/>
<br/>
If you want to change the world around you, then you must first dare to <br/>
envision how that world would look.<br/>
<br/>
This, in a nutshell, is the inspiring message that &quot;Creating Learning <br/>
Communities&quot; offers its readers. And it is no exaggeration to call the <br/>
contributors to this book &quot;visionaries&quot; in their own right: Patrick <br/>
Farenga, Wendy Priesnitz, Linda Dobson and Ann Lahrson Fisher are among <br/>
those names who will be easily recognizable in the international <br/>
homelearning community, and likewise for Jerry Mintz, Ray Ison, Kathia <br/>
Laszlo and Ron Miller (editor of this collection) in the global <br/>
alternative-education community.<br/>
<br/>
Of particular interest to those of us here in Japan are the essays <br/>
contributed to this book by Dayle Bethel (founder and dean of The <br/>
International University&#39;s Asia-Pacific Learning Centers in Kyoto, Japan <br/>
and Honolulu, Hawaii) and by Motoshi Suzuki (a graduate student at the <br/>
TIU Kyoto Learning Center who also helps coordinate its programs).<br/>
<br/>
Bethel&#39;s essay on &quot;Work, Community, and the Development of Moral <br/>
Character&quot; focuses on how work can serve as a positive factor in human <br/>
growth and learning. Most enlightening is Bethel&#39;s recognition of the <br/>
work of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, a Japanese teacher and author in the early <br/>
1900s who was far ahead of his time in his commitment to community-based <br/>
education in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Suzuki&#39;s essay, in turn, covers the background of the TIU Kyoto Learning <br/>
Center, its programs, and how his continuing studies in holistic <br/>
education at TIU Kyoto have transformed his life -- a rare experience <br/>
indeed, when you consider that contemporary Japanese universities do <br/>
little more than prep their students to become efficient &quot;company <br/>
soldiers&quot; out in the battlefields of the business world.<br/>
<br/>
This book has been talked about in other online forums and KnoK NEWS <br/>
readers have probably heard something about this collection elsewhere in <br/>
the cyber-community. But we just couldn&#39;t let another edition of KnoK <br/>
NEWS go by without *highly* recommending this book. If you want to catch <br/>
a glimpse of how the visions of community-based learning are sure to <br/>
change the world in the years to come, this book provides a most reliable <br/>
blueprint.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody in Japan who is interested in ordering a copy of &quot;Creating <br/>
Learning Communities&quot; can do so through the TIU Kyoto Learning Center at: <br/>
 motoshi@...-inet.or.jp  [Disclaimer: KnoK NEWS has no affiliation <br/>
or connection whatsoever with either TIU Kyoto or this book, other than <br/>
offering our full moral support for the educational missions of each.]<br/>

fact, GHB students and staff are visiting in Thailand to take part in <br/>
activities of Moo Baan Dek, a pioneering &quot;children&#39;s village school&quot; that <br/>
is to Thailand what the Summerhill school is to the UK.  [Note: There may <br/>

--&gt; http://www.L-Net.com/<br/>
A newly opened, alternative &quot;international school for Japanese people&quot; <br/>
located on Mount Rokko in the city of Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture. This school <br/>
seems to be getting a lot of attention in the Japanese mass media these <br/>
days. A few homelearning children are reportedly enrolled in LearnNet <br/>
programs, which include Montessori-based methods and afterschool <br/>
activities. This website includes homelearning and alternative education <br/>
links, as well as its own online discussion list. <br/>
<br/>
(7) MOORE JAPAN (japanese)<br/>
--&gt; http://www.geocities.co.jp/Milkyway/5262<br/>
Yes, the US homelearning pioneers Dr. Raymond and Dorothy Moore are <br/>
making inroads into the Land of the Rising Sun! Moore Japan is based in <br/>
Gunma Prefecture, and for some time now has been publishing a print <br/>
newsletter in Japanese on home education. Moore Japan does not have its <br/>
own website up yet, unfortunately, but it does offer an extensive set of <br/>
essays on childraising through this website of the SDA Osaka Center, a <br/>
Protestant Christian organization based in Osaka, Japan. Click on number <br/>
8 on the left-hand side of this website&#39;s main page to see the Moore <br/>
Japan essays in Japanese.  [The organization can be contacted directly by <br/>
writing to: &quot;Moore Japan,&quot; c/o Nihon Kensei Kyokai, 3964 Oaza <br/>

<br/>
(9) T.I.U. KYOTO LEARNING CENTER (english)<br/>
--&gt; http://www.tiu-asiapacific.org<br/>
Website of an independent-study program in Japan that has been offering <br/>
alternative education to university students for more than *two decades* <br/>
-- since way back in 1975, that is, when the concept of holistic, <br/>
community-based learning was a much crazier idea in Japanese society than <br/>
it is today. The Kyoto Learning Center is a branch of The International <br/>
University (http://www.tiu.com) in Independence, Missouri, USA. Dayle <br/>
Bethel (noted in the book review above) established the Japan program <br/>
first in Osaka, then in Kyoto, where it remains today.<br/>
<br/>
(10) TOKYO HOMESCHOOLING NETWORK - &quot;HINATA BOKKO&quot; (japanese)<br/>
--&gt; http://www.alpha-net.ne.jp/users2/gratias/bokko.html<br/>
A new homelearning support group in Japan! This is the webpage to apply <br/>
for membership in the recently formed Tokyo Homeschooling Network, a <br/>
local Japanese group. The Japanese phrase *Hinata Bokko* in the group&#39;s <br/>
name means to &quot;bask in the sun&quot; -- an appropriate description indeed for <br/>
Japanese parents and children who have decided to step out of the shadows <br/>
of the collapsing public-school system and embrace homelearning as a <br/>
viable alternative in Japan.<br/>
