<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596222422">For all those equestrian enthusiasts out there in cyberland, I found <br/>
this website on an ad at the official site for the Olympic Games<br/>
<br/>
www.clipclop.com<br/>
<br/>
haven&#39;t looked at it all, but it looks quite cool.  just downloading the <br/>
demo version of &#39;virtual horse&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
