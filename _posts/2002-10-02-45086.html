<div id="ygrps-yiv-881010473">There are ways around this. Have the child with someone else that day.  Make sure a friend the child likes to play with is there.  Meet only as adults, when dhs can take over.  Have a way that the children don&#39;t have to interreact much; a video for instance that both like to watch.  Or two different rooms to play two different games.  Make sure the older child&#39;s room is off limits to the younger ones.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t usually have to be one person&#39;s way or the other...<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

  &lt;&lt; My seven year old would at times get<br/>
  quite fed up with my friend&#39;s twin four year olds and say similar things.  I<br/>
  told him to live with it as their Mother is my friendT and they are my<br/>
  friends and he can play in a different room if he doesn&#39;t want to be around<br/>
  them when they are visiting.<br/>
    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s not the most sympathetic response &quot;live with it&quot; in regards to a <br/>
  situation in which the child has very little control.<br/>
  Is it really the end of the world to take a break from some friends for a few <br/>
  months? In order to save a child&#39;s esteem?<br/>
  Saying &quot;I don&#39;t like  ABC&quot; or whatever people they&#39;ve decided to announce <br/>
  they don&#39;t like is fairly common at a young age.<br/>
  Often it has to do with the fact that they are figuring out autonomy. They <br/>
  can say it, so they do! I would take it seriously, but also remember it may <br/>
  be a developmental stage in which the child is figuring out what he really <br/>
  does and doesn&#39;t like.<br/>
  Or that he can say powerful things.<br/>
  But the other child should not have to suffer hurt feelings over it all the <br/>
  time.<br/>
  Parent&#39;s are required to put children first in this situation I believe.<br/>
  Just as we are in a lot of situations.<br/>
  It doesn&#39;t mean giving up our personal needs, it may mean putting them on <br/>
  hold for the better good.<br/>
  If a person isn&#39;t willing to give up their own needs to place a child&#39;s first <br/>
  many, many times, they aren&#39;t ready to be parents.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;<br/>
  Also, asking a child to give a reason for not liking someone can be like<br/>
  asking for the moon.  Analyzing one&#39;s feelings is something that even adults<br/>
  find hard&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I agree.<br/>
  Especially if, as I mentioned above, the child is merely trying out the ways <br/>
  in which he can wield some power.<br/>
  Or test out reactions.<br/>
  But I would always try to have a respectful reaction. <br/>
