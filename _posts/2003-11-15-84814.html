Wow, wow, wow!!! How DO you make it work? It&#39;s the one bathroom part that is hardest for us. I told dh if we built another bathroom and a game room I could live here for a very, very long time. :)<br/>

If it weren&#39;t for our second bathroom and second refrigerator, there&#39;s no <br/>
way we could do it in our place. Even though we primarily use the upstairs <br/>
bathroom, having that second potty is key! And I&#39;d be totally lost without <br/>
my overflow fridge. Where else would I store the 5 gallons of milk we buy <br/>
per week? EEK!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also lucky &#39;cause we have some nice outside living space. That makes <br/>
a very big difference 2-3 seasons out of the year.<br/>

Basically we&#39;ve had to give up all pretense of modesty; although Sarah knows she can&#39;t go into the potty if Daddy&#39;s in there. The babies are still little enough that it doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re in there at the same time as either of us. <br/>
 <br/>
In a nutshell, I hate it. We have to put a fan in the window just to cook because the heat in the galley kitchen can be incredible! But there is NOTHING else available for year-round rent on Cape Cod. People up here don&#39;t tend to have so many children and don&#39;t need four or five bedroom houses. We even qualify income-wise for section 8, which has a four bedroom available, but they say that there isn&#39;t enough of an age difference between the kids for that fourth bedroom! ?!! Go figure!  <br/>
 <br/>
Only another 18 months left to go.<br/>
 <br/>
We do have a basement, but it&#39;s not liveable space.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670020364">Hi to all,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to stumble upon this subject but are y&#39;all talking APARTMENTS or <br/>
HOUSES? 600, 800, 1500sq feet in a house are never, EVER the same as in <br/>
an apartment. If you count basement, garage/shed &/or front/backyard, <br/>
that makes a hell of a lot of difference than the same footage in an <br/>
apartment.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, in an apartment the square footage usually includes the <br/>
closets, kitchen & bathroom. Once you put in furniture for storage <br/>
space, you are left with about 150/200 sq feet of livable space. The sq <br/>
footage in houses is actually calculated differently. There is no <br/>
national standard for it but usually it only includes actual livable <br/>
spaces. Not so in NYC.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d do anything for an unlivable basement ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
/ l i z a, who live in about 200 sq feet of actual livable space in nyc <br/>
with her 2 kids and hubby<br/>
