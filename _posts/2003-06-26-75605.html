<div id="ygrps-yiv-125613744">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jeva and I&#39;m a single unschooling mother of 1 beautiful <br/>
unschooled free spirited son named Max/9 and many animal friends <br/>
(unschooled too). I have a dilemma and am hoping I can get some good <br/>
orderly direction with it.<br/>
<br/>
I know in my heart I need to ignore unsupportive people, but I have <br/>
had it with a neighbor. This woman lives next to us, also works in <br/>
the corner store near where we live, and for some strange reason is <br/>
CONSTANTLY discussing my son&#39;s education. It got so bad that we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go in there. My son would go into the store to purchase <br/>
something and the woman purposely would charge him too much. I take <br/>
it her thinking was because he&#39;s homeschooled that he can&#39;t count <br/>
change? I&#39;m not sure and can&#39;t say what&#39;s in her head, but after the <br/>
5th time of noticing this (we thought SHE was the one who couldn&#39;t <br/>
count lol!) I called the store to complain about her and we never <br/>
went back. <br/>
<br/>
It was bad enough to have her always bring up his schooling when <br/>
simply buying a cup of coffee, but I would ignore her. She has even <br/>
brought it up to family members who have gone in there. It&#39;s so <br/>
annoying to have someone, who obviously needs a life, gossip and talk <br/>
to other neighbors behind your back about our insane method of <br/>
education and how I&#39;m ruining my son&#39;s life, {add your own uninformed <br/>
comment of choice here}etc...<br/>
<br/>
The last straw for me came the other day when she was passing my son <br/>
and his friends on the way home and told Max that &quot;Your Grandfather <br/>
is GOING TO MAKE YOU GO TO SCHOOL!!!&quot;. Max didn&#39;t say anything (shock <br/>
and disbelief probably) but was fairly upset when he got home from <br/>
play to tell me.<br/>
<br/>
I called her and told her that we have had enough of her gossip and <br/>
it&#39;s none of her business how we live or choose to educate, or <br/>
anything concerning our lives. Of course she reacted and it got <br/>
nasty. She kept hanging up on me, I called back until I finished what <br/>
I had to say and then hung up on her. lol! Pretty silly stuff, but <br/>
how upsetting to have some nut so obviously obsessed with your life <br/>
that they spend WAY too much time discussing your business with <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you all had anything remotely like this happen? It was <br/>
horrible. It&#39;s a good thing we live in a very homeschool friendly <br/>
state or I&#39;d be concerned she&#39;d do something like attempt to report <br/>
us. Pretty scary stuff. I really dislike confrontation, but that was <br/>
my last straw. If nothing else, I just wanted her to know that I knew <br/>
what she had said, that it&#39;s not acceptable, and to never speak to my <br/>
son again. There was no reason in what she told him and it was a <br/>
total lie meant to scare my son. How mean.<br/>
<br/>
So it would really help me if anyone can share incidents like this <br/>
and how you handled them or perhaps didn&#39;t, just ignored it?<br/>

you can.  First I would tell her boss about it and explain that they have<br/>

She sounds nuts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921971224">Thanks Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
I had called the store where she works a couple of times when she <br/>
would overcharge us. No real response. <br/>
<br/>
I will have to get a report and record everything. She really appears <br/>
to be unbalanced. One of the neighbors told me &quot;she beats her kids&quot;. <br/>
No discussion, no guidance, just a beating. What a sick individual. <br/>
Pretty scary. Most of the neighbors won&#39;t allow their children to <br/>
play with her son as he&#39;s so mean. Good evidence that bullies raise <br/>
more bullies. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756766966">I like the idea of making a record of it.  Also I would write to the woman.  <br/>
Just a letter stating some specific things that she has done.  Also saying <br/>
that if she continues to harass you or your son that you will seek legal advice.  <br/>
I really don&#39;t know about the law but you could ask the local law enforcement <br/>
how to go about filing something so it is on record that she does this.  And <br/>
also let her know in the letter that you did file whatever and you will <br/>
continue to do so with ever event that occurs.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t go pointing fingers, with the spanking thing. There is no actual <br/>
proof.  You didn&#39;t actually see her beat her child.  You heard it from a <br/>
friend.....  Just stick with the facts.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that I have no ideas.  It must be such a hard situation.  I don&#39;t <br/>
have to deal with that so I have no real first hand knowledge.  But keep us up <br/>
to date with what the police say and what comes of all this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291595217">Thank you Pam, you are right in that I didn&#39;t witness anything, just <br/>
going by her son&#39;s behavior. I know she&#39;s called the police on one <br/>
neighbor claiming their dogs bark all the time and reported another <br/>
for her dogs not being licensed, so at least with those facts, I know <br/>
I&#39;m not the only target.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll send it certified or registered so I know she gets my <br/>
letter. I would only hope she doesn&#39;t attempt to turn it around and <br/>
use it saying I&#39;m harrassing her.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty sad that someone would go to such lengths, but she&#39;s obviously <br/>
not well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the suggestions. :) I feel better just sharing it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think some of it&#39;s genetic.<br/>
<br/>
MAYBE she&#39;s mean because people were mean to her, but maybe she&#39;s lacking in <br/>
conscience from fetal alcohol syndrome (a guess, thinking of my half brother), <br/>
and maybe she has a harsh personality and married someone likewise harsh and <br/>
has double-harsh children.<br/>
<br/>
I think kindness and reason can make a genetically harsh kid softer.  I think <br/>
cruelty can make a gentically soft kid harsher.  But I don&#39;t believe in the <br/>
blank slate, matching-lumps-of-clay birth of humans.<br/>

problems with your child, but don&#39;t you think that honey would have <br/>
worked better than vinegar?  (Sarcasm alert. I have no problem with <br/>
how you reacted.  I DO have a problem with hypocrisy.)<br/>
