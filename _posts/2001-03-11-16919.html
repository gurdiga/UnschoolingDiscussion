&lt;&lt; Seems weird to me, because I am an unschooler that still calls myself a <br/>
 homeschooler to everybody but fellow unschoolers, because I just don&#39;t want <br/>
 to get into my reasons and the whole thing...<br/>

    This is us too. I really do not want to get into it w/ someone. Usually <br/>
they think I crazy just for homeschooling let alone child led learning and <br/>
living life. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510320357">Thanks for this info...  I hadn&#39;t heard of the portfolio option... it&#39;s nice<br/>
to hear from someone who did the &#39;in home&#39; assessment offered by FLO - I&#39;ve<br/>
heard from others who have used the visitor assessor... Thanks again -<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have discovered FLO (I was on the WHEN list for awhile) and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; intrigued<br/>
&gt; by the evaluation option. Did you do that or the test?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just did the &quot;Checklist Assessment&quot; from FLO.  It was easy to do and<br/>
&gt; now I&#39;ve met that legal requirement.  I was more surprised by things on<br/>
&gt; it that my daughter knew that I didn&#39;t know that she knew.  This<br/>
&gt; assessment seems to be based on a &quot;typical course of study&quot;.  It had<br/>
&gt; sections for the 11 subjects that are required in Washington.  Under each<br/>
&gt; subject, there was a list of things that the typical second grade class<br/>
&gt; would cover.  I needed to check off the ones my daughter knew.  FLO also<br/>
&gt; sells a &quot;free style assessment&quot;.  I am told it has spaces to write about<br/>
&gt; what your child does.  I think I will go that route next time, as it<br/>
&gt; seems that would be more suitable to unschooling.  We also have the<br/>
&gt; option of keeping a portfolio (ie, scrapbook) in lieu of testing.<br/>
&gt; Currently, our law does require that the portfolio or assessment needs to<br/>
&gt; be reviewed by a person certificated in the field of education.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It helps to remember that WA state law says that the test/assessment is<br/>
&gt; for the parent.  We do not have to give the results to anyone, but we are<br/>
&gt; required to &quot;make a good faith effort to remedy any deficiencies&quot;.<br/>
