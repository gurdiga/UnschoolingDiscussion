Our kids  don&#39;t post phone numbers or addresses and<br/>
use usually first names or screen  names.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--------------<br/>
 <br/>
Our kids use names sometimes, and their sites are linked to my site  which <br/>
has my address (if people look long enough) and Keith and I have been in  the <br/>
phone book with the same phone number (though this is the second of two  houses <br/>
with that phone number for nearly 30 years.   Nobody has so  much as burned a <br/>
cross or a sack of dog shit at our house.<br/>
 <br/>
When the kids first got e-mail I set them up with their real names (as  <br/>
mine&#39;s set up), partly because it has been really USEFUL that I&#39;ve used my real  <br/>
name in lots of ways.  But the boys opted out after a while for fantasy  game na<br/>
mes that are now outdated.  Holly had AstaHD for a while (her SCA  name and <br/>
then her initials, and still uses that for neopets) but uses  HollyLynnDodd now. <br/>
 She&#39;d&#39;ve used HollyDodd, but I guess it was  taken.  On Halo 2 she used the <br/>
default randomized thing they assigned her  (as did Kirby, but I think Marty <br/>
created one; can&#39;t remember what his is).<br/>
 <br/>
I think the opposite of living in fear is living with such courage that  <br/>
others are afraid to mess with you. &lt;g&gt;  People just don&#39;t threaten  my kids.  <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s personality.  Maybe it&#39;s confidence.  It&#39;s  not cluelessness, though.  <br/>
 Maybe it&#39;s confidence born of a life  lacking in lack. &lt;g&gt;  They are not <br/>
needy, and so strangers can&#39;t get  their attention with candy (literal or <br/>
figurative).<br/>
 <br/>
HEY!  That&#39;s a good, good thing to add to our evidence about the  results of <br/>
limiting food.<br/>
 <br/>
Just think what factors would need to be in play for a child to go with a  <br/>
strange man into a car because he offered her candy.<br/>
