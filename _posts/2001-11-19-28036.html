I like the way you articulate this issue.   I am &quot;on the same page&quot; (maybe<br/>
that explains my liking it?)  I don&#39;t think my children will automatically<br/>
develop healthy habits (e.g., brushing teeth).  I, too,  am working to<br/>
establish routines and parameters within which they can grow and develop<br/>
into them&quot;selves&quot;.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The biggest problem in discussing the idea of control in general<br/>
&gt; &gt; is that most people begin with the socially implanted idea that<br/>
&gt; &gt; control is the norm. It&#39;s what children need. So someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggesting &quot;I have come to the conclusion that control works for<br/>
&gt; &gt; my kids,&quot; is really a reinforment of the social norm.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The idea many are working towards is to throw away that idea and<br/>
&gt; &gt; begin with a new base of operations, a new norm: the idea that<br/>
&gt; &gt; control isn&#39;t necessary, that children will self-regulate when<br/>
&gt; &gt; given the freedom to do so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Joyce,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I firmly respect your opinion here BUT.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve considered myself an unschooler for 11 years now, ever since I<br/>
&gt; first read John Holt and decided my oldest was not ever attending<br/>
&gt; traditional school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Over the years, I have had this idea forced on me on nearly every<br/>
&gt; unschooling list I&#39;ve been on. I&#39;ve been called a control freak<br/>
&gt; because I expect my children to make their beds and brush their<br/>
&gt; teeth. My parenting has been attacked and I&#39;ve been told I certainly<br/>
&gt; must not bea &quot;real unschooler&quot;. Now I&#39;m not saying that you are doing<br/>
&gt; this, Joyce. I believe I understand the message of your post - With<br/>
&gt; ideas about how to force and control children so readily available,<br/>
&gt; it is important to put other messages out there (am I hearing you<br/>
&gt; correctly?). I just want to voice an opinion that says please don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; narrowly define unschooling for me. For me, I know that experience<br/>
&gt; plays a big part in life. For me, my experience is SOMETIMES more<br/>
&gt; important, more vital than the opinions of my children. But I share<br/>
&gt; it with them rather than lay down the law. This has been a life long<br/>
&gt; effort of building a relationship and trust where my word means<br/>
&gt; something to them. I do know more than they do in many areas but my<br/>
&gt; trust in them bleeds through and affects both of our decisions. BUt<br/>
&gt; if push came to shove, I am the parent and the authority in the<br/>
&gt; household. I&#39;ve been known to force or manipulate to get kids off a<br/>
&gt; plateu or to move them beyond a comfort level they&#39;ve stayed at a bit<br/>
&gt; too long. I&#39;ve pushed them into activities that exposed them to ideas<br/>
&gt; they thought they wouldn&#39;t like because I knew/felt there was value<br/>
&gt; (and most of the time I was right). I consider these nudges to be<br/>
&gt; parenting responsibilities. I&#39;ve helped my kids get over fears and<br/>
&gt; opened their eyes to differences of opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For some, I know I don&#39;t live up to the title &quot;unschooler&quot;. But for<br/>
&gt; me, it is a term still evolving and not one I&#39;m always comfortable<br/>
&gt; with. Life-learner feels so much better. And if these nudges and<br/>
&gt; authority keep me from the select group, so be it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope this doesn&#39;t feel attacking, Joyce. I&#39;m not wanting to oppose<br/>
&gt; your views but you reminded me of some previous situations in the<br/>
&gt; unschooling community that I wanted to address.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; in peace,<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;that television viewing is always benign&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Of course it isn&#39;t always benign.  But I don&#39;t think that is the issue.  I<br/>
&gt; think the issue is who decides when it has become malignant?  How is that<br/>
&gt; decision arrived at?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a very sensitive 10yo dd.  &quot;Matlock&quot; scares her.  When something is<br/>
&gt; coming on that I think might cause her problems, I say &quot;This program is<br/>
&gt; about such and such.  It might be too scary for you.&quot;  Then she decides if<br/>
&gt; she wants to watch it or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She went through several months of sitting on her behind watching<br/>
 </span></blockquote>television<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; reruns all day.  She was crabby and tired all the time.  I pointed out<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I thought she would feel better if she got her blood flowing, got outside.<br/>
&gt; SHE decided that she would give it a try and SHE decided that she agreed<br/>
&gt; with me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was television viewing benign in those situations?  No.  But Adriane was<br/>
&gt; able to found that out for herself and I feel that I have to trust her to<br/>
&gt; find those things out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other times, I have been dead wrong with my suggestions.  We have fire<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ants<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; here and little kids just love to stir the mounds and watch the ants<br/>

&gt; &gt;They have both chosen their own clothes for years and usually look<br/>

&gt; &gt;care &#39;cause I usually do too.  Today, in the same clothes they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;always worn, they suddenly look like they are two unique and<br/>
&gt; &gt;interesting individuals who like to dress their personalities.  They<br/>
&gt; &gt;both were standing straight and tall and interacting with the world<br/>
&gt; &gt;around them.  I don&#39;t know how many teens you all see regularly but<br/>
&gt; &gt;if they are anything like the high schoolers around here you will<br/>
&gt; &gt;recognize that as a great thing.  No pouting at the wait.  No whining<br/>
&gt; &gt;that they wanted anything.  Just a bit of conversation about the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So true, Dan. I had the pleasure of meeting Sandra a little over 4<br/>
&gt; years ago when she agreed to speak at a conference here in Columbus.<br/>
&gt; As a harried conference coordinator, I barely got time to say hello,<br/>
&gt; but the response from our attendees said it all. Sandra was very well<br/>
&gt; received and she spoke to the heart of the matter. Yes, she<br/>
&gt; challenged people.. made them rethink what they accepted as given<br/>
&gt; realities. But isn&#39;t that a lot of what home education and<br/>
&gt; specifically unschooling is all about?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing I&#39;ve come to learn is that the most passionate people are<br/>
&gt; often the ones who are the most difficult to get along with. But<br/>
&gt; passionate people change the world and I&#39;m thankful for the Sandra&#39;s<br/>

&gt; textbooks and documentation? I can see that as they would<br/>
&gt; apply &quot;credit&quot; for the work and give it the &quot;authority&quot; he seems to<br/>
&gt; need. And in the meantime, Mom can still feel that she is following a<br/>
&gt; more relaxed atmosphere while getting  back up from an &quot;authority&quot;.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  How&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the weather where you are?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It began raining here Saturday evening, and though the rain had stopped<br/>
&gt; by midnight, the sky was full of clouds.  We knew there wasn&#39;t much<br/>
&gt; chance of seeing the meteor shower.  We laid on a tarp, wrapped in<br/>
&gt; sleeping bags, my son&#39;s little warm hand in mine.  While we were hoping<br/>
&gt; for the clouds to break,  we began to hear the geese.  They came over our<br/>
&gt; little town in waves,  their bellies shimmering like silver ribbons<br/>
&gt; against the grey sky.  The sound was indescribable.   I can&#39;t begin to<br/>
&gt; imagine how many there were.  When our hot chocolate ran out and my son<br/>
&gt; fell asleep, we carried him inside.  We went out again about two o&#39;clock<br/>
&gt; and still the geese were coming.  We watched and listened for two more<br/>
&gt; hours, before their numbers seemed to dwindle.  It was all so utterly<br/>
&gt; magical.   Not one shooting star but thousands of shining geese, and they<br/>
&gt; sang to us too.<br/>

Actually,  things have gotten much better in the past 4-5 months...dd has<br/>
become more able to be responsible and trustworthy about avoiding foods she<br/>
needs to.  From about age 4 until recently,  our dd was more likely to tell<br/>
us what we wanted to hear rather than what she really ate.  I believe this<br/>
was reinforced by the aforementioned parents she was with;  since I tried to<br/>
remind them of her requirements each time.<br/>
<br/>
It was really tough for awhile.....wanting her to spend time with her<br/>
friend,  but not trusting the parents!  We tried limiting play times to<br/>
after she&#39;d eaten her....but you know how kids eat...some days just grazing,<br/>
others just picking.<br/>
<br/>
And it was difficult to finally have dd &quot;get&quot; the importance of this...after<br/>
all,  it wasn&#39;t a clear connection between food consumtion and the physical<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow,  we still limit her exposure to that family.  And when she goes,  we<br/>
talk about what she might pick from a menu.  If they&#39;re eating at home,  I&#39;m<br/>
not too shy to ask the menu,  and willing to supplement.  It&#39;s also worked<br/>
well to meet them places and pack-a-lunch.<br/>

&gt; Of course it isn&#39;t always benign.  But I don&#39;t think that is the issue.  I<br/>
&gt; think the issue is who decides when it has become malignant?  How is that<br/>
&gt; decision arrived at?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a very sensitive 10yo dd.  &quot;Matlock&quot; scares her.  When something is<br/>
&gt; coming on that I think might cause her problems, I say &quot;This program is<br/>
&gt; about such and such.  It might be too scary for you.&quot;  Then she decides if<br/>
&gt; she wants to watch it or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She went through several months of sitting on her behind watching<br/>

&gt; Was television viewing benign in those situations?  No.  But Adriane was<br/>

&gt; &gt;They have both chosen their own clothes for years and usually look<br/>
&gt; &gt;like refugees from a poorly funded Salvation Army.  I don;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;care &#39;cause I usually do too.  Today, in the same clothes they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;always worn, they suddenly look like they are two unique and<br/>
&gt; &gt;interesting individuals who like to dress their personalities.  They<br/>
&gt; &gt;both were standing straight and tall and interacting with the world<br/>
&gt; &gt;around them.  I don&#39;t know how many teens you all see regularly but<br/>
&gt; &gt;if they are anything like the high schoolers around here you will<br/>
&gt; &gt;recognize that as a great thing.  No pouting at the wait.  No whining<br/>
&gt; &gt;that they wanted anything.  Just a bit of conversation about the<br/>
&gt; &gt;movie and what was left out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sound like nice kids.  I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed getting to know my daughter<br/>
&gt; better when she became a mother.  My step-daughter vaccilates between<br/>
&gt; refugee and dressing her personaility, with the percentage way over on the<br/>
&gt; personality side by now.<br/>

&gt; So true, Dan. I had the pleasure of meeting Sandra a little over 4<br/>
&gt; years ago when she agreed to speak at a conference here in Columbus.<br/>
&gt; As a harried conference coordinator, I barely got time to say hello,<br/>
&gt; but the response from our attendees said it all. Sandra was very well<br/>
&gt; received and she spoke to the heart of the matter. Yes, she<br/>
&gt; challenged people.. made them rethink what they accepted as given<br/>
&gt; realities. But isn&#39;t that a lot of what home education and<br/>
&gt; specifically unschooling is all about?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing I&#39;ve come to learn is that the most passionate people are<br/>
&gt; often the ones who are the most difficult to get along with. But<br/>
&gt; passionate people change the world and I&#39;m thankful for the Sandra&#39;s<br/>

&gt; textbooks and documentation? I can see that as they would<br/>
&gt; apply &quot;credit&quot; for the work and give it the &quot;authority&quot; he seems to<br/>
&gt; need. And in the meantime, Mom can still feel that she is following a<br/>
&gt; more relaxed atmosphere while getting  back up from an &quot;authority&quot;.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Really, the best way to stop a flame war is to change the subject.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  How&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the weather where you are?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It began raining here Saturday evening, and though the rain had stopped<br/>
&gt; by midnight, the sky was full of clouds.  We knew there wasn&#39;t much<br/>
&gt; chance of seeing the meteor shower.  We laid on a tarp, wrapped in<br/>
&gt; sleeping bags, my son&#39;s little warm hand in mine.  While we were hoping<br/>
&gt; for the clouds to break,  we began to hear the geese.  They came over our<br/>
&gt; little town in waves,  their bellies shimmering like silver ribbons<br/>
&gt; against the grey sky.  The sound was indescribable.   I can&#39;t begin to<br/>
&gt; imagine how many there were.  When our hot chocolate ran out and my son<br/>
&gt; fell asleep, we carried him inside.  We went out again about two o&#39;clock<br/>
&gt; and still the geese were coming.  We watched and listened for two more<br/>
&gt; hours, before their numbers seemed to dwindle.  It was all so utterly<br/>
&gt; magical.   Not one shooting star but thousands of shining geese, and they<br/>
&gt; sang to us too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    Lynda, sorry I have been deleting so I need you to tell me what you meant <br/>
here. These things can be mentally controlled? Just curious. I have had 8 <br/>
encounters,family,friends,acquaintences that have miscarried this year. I <br/>
have been so concerned I would too, like why should this work for me if so <br/>
many people are having miscarriages. Sadly yesterday I watched a dear <br/>
friend&#39;s son while she went for her first appt. (7wks) and there was no heart <br/>
beat. She is so torn up. Her 2 yo daughter died last year this Dec, So this <br/>
is really hard on her. My personal theory is, this baby wasn&#39;t healthy enough <br/>
and nature took its course. But I can&#39;t tell that to someone who is having <br/>
such a tough time w/ life this past year.<br/>
<br/>
   Just curious.<br/>
