<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049151322">Whenever there is something on television or radio that is controversial I<br/>
try real hard not to influence, at least not too much, how the kidlets<br/>
think.  I think elections are great training grounds for research skills and<br/>
learning about history.<br/>
<br/>
In the last twelve years there has been lots of stuff out there about the<br/>
various folks in political office.  Quayle gave reporters enough material to<br/>
last them for years.  The comic book about Bush and Quayle when they ran<br/>
against Clinton was quite a hoot.  Clinton and all his picadillos have kept<br/>
the press busy.  BUT, never in the history of the U.S. has more negative<br/>
publicity been generated by the presence of one person than has happened in<br/>
the less than four week since the election.  Third World countries are<br/>
making jokes about Dubya, the media is having a heyday.<br/>
<br/>
So, following the house rule of &quot;get the facts, digest the facts, make a<br/>
decision,&quot; (one of the joys of unschooling!) the kidlets decided to do a web<br/>
search and then did research at the library.  Then they did a math thingy<br/>
(several graphes and pie charts, etc.) and then extended their charts to the<br/>
year 2004.  The projection is that by the time Dubya leaves the White House,<br/>
if he&#39;s ever officially elected, he will have generated more negative<br/>
publicity for the U.S. than Quayle, Clinton and all prior elections and<br/>
politicians combined.  Well, I questioned there numbers because we are<br/>
talking a phenominal number by the end of 2004 and it came back to bite me<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They finished their little &quot;study&quot; on Thursday and what should arrive in the<br/>
mail on Friday but a Christmas card with a hohoho inside (thank you,<br/>
you-know-who &lt;g&gt;, hubby is hanging it at the top of our Christmas card tree<br/>
&lt;g&gt;).  First thing eldest kidlet said was &quot;See!&quot;  Here&#39;s the &quot;gift&quot; from<br/>
inside the card, a seed packet which reads:<br/>
<br/>
BUSHLEAGUE SEED CO.<br/>
*TEXAS* HOMEGROWN DOPE<br/>
<br/>
[Goofy looking cartoon drawing of Dubya in a pot of weed]<br/>
<br/>
Planting Instructions:  Usinga silver spoon, plant in shallow hole. Protect<br/>
from draft.  Feed with loads of family and soft money.<br/>
<br/>
The back reads:<br/>
<br/>
TEXAS HOMEGROWN (legalized) DOPE<br/>
An ornamental shrub developed to protect corporate boardrooms and gated<br/>
communities.<br/>
<br/>
WHERE TO PLANT:  Grows easily in poor environment; oblivious to air or water<br/>
quality, and unaffected by chemical or radioactive contamination.<br/>
<br/>
RECOMMENDED PLANTING DEPTH:  Extremely shallow.<br/>
<br/>
DAYS TO MATURITY:  When Mommy and Poppy say so.<br/>
<br/>
WHEN TO PLANT:  Whenever migrant labor is available.<br/>
<br/>
CARE:  Thrives with lack of illumination.  Protect from pests such as single<br/>
working mothers and investigative reporters.  Feed with special interest<br/>
fundraisers until firmly rooted in the Public Treasury.<br/>
<br/>
This Dope provides short term euphoria with big tax breaks for the rich.<br/>
Long term side effects could include fiscal pain, swelling welfare rolls,<br/>
and an increase in death by lethal injection.<br/>
