<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574907750">Please keep in mind I&#39;m not an expert, allergist, MD, etc, but this is what<br/>
I understand to be true. you cannot catch a cold from being cold. Being<br/>
cold, however does lowere your resistence and can make you more susueptable<br/>
to catching colds. I don&#39;t know about summer colds, as in catching a cold<br/>
every summer, but I know that one can catch a cold anytime. The reason<br/>
people catch more colds in the winter is because they are closed in<br/>
together. If everyone opened their windows in winter we&#39;d probably catch<br/>
less colds than in summer, because the cold temps. actually kill the cold<br/>
virus. I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t catch a cold from sleeping under a fan. It&#39;s most<br/>
likely that your son has the same allergies as you, but if all 3 of you have<br/>
it, it could be a cold. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any way to distinguish cold<br/>
symptoms from allergy symptoms.<br/>

&gt; Okay, this is OT but I need some help settling a debate between DH<br/>
&gt; and me. I have been diagnosed by my OB&#39;s nurse with allergies. My<br/>
&gt; 1yos has the same symptoms so I assume that what he has is allergies<br/>
&gt; as well. I guess what I want to know is what are the symtomatic<br/>
&gt; differences between allergies and a cold? Can you get a cold just<br/>
&gt; from being cold? Is there REALLY such a thing as just a summer cold<br/>
&gt; (a cold that you get every summer)? And can you get a cold from<br/>
&gt; sleeping under a fan? I don&#39;t believe these wives tails about colds<br/>
&gt; but DH does. I just need to hear from someone else that they are not<br/>
&gt; true. Oh, DH is convinced that the nurse is wrong and that he caught<br/>
&gt; his &quot;cold&quot; from me and our son. Corallyn<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834296155">O.K., a cold is a virus.  An allergy is an irritation that can do anything<br/>
from effect something topically to irritate the immune system.  You canNOT<br/>
catch an allergy!  However, someone who has never be allergic before can<br/>
develop allergies later in life from a variety of reasons and causes.<br/>
<br/>
Where you sleep or how you sleep can effect whether or not you become prone<br/>
to colds.  IE.  You use the fan, your throat and sinus cavities become<br/>
irritated and are thus more suseptible to invading cold viruses.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you can&#39;t get a cold from being cold but again you are more suseptible<br/>
and therefore are more likely to get a cold.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking mild symptoms of colds and allergies are basically the<br/>
same which is why it usually takes a professional to determine which is<br/>
which at first.  However, colds go away after running a routine coarse. <br/>
Allergies, depending on the type, don&#39;t go away until the cause goes<br/>
away--pollen born allergies are usually only seen from spring through the<br/>
end of autumn.<br/>
<br/>
Other allergies go away from you remove the things you are allergic to such<br/>
as wheat or dairy products.<br/>
<br/>
There are a bunch of sites on the net along with descriptions of colds from<br/>
the simplistic to the detailed medical.  You might want to print some of<br/>
those out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117991992">Just wanted to say thanks for the replies. None of the medical people <br/>
that I know were home tonight when I sent the post and hadn&#39;t been <br/>
home for a while. It has been really bugging me since DH insists that <br/>
I got this from the fan being on at night. Which, by the way, we <br/>
sleep with year round being in such a hot, humid climate here in <br/>
Houston. Seems to me that if it were caused by the fan then we would <br/>
both be sick year round as well. The other thing about it is that <br/>
only 1yos DH and me have this. 3.5yod and 5.5yos do not and I snuggle <br/>
with them every night. I did finally get a hold of my sister and my <br/>
mil they both said the same thing, that you can&#39;t get sick from <br/>
sleeping with the fan on or solely from getting cold (Sorry, <br/>
earthmoon. Neither of these theories make sense to me. Maybe it is my <br/>
medical upbringing, mom&#39;s an R.N., dad&#39;s a Chiropractor, and bil is <br/>
M.D. I would be interested in hearing your theory behind it though.) <br/>
I can see how the cold would make you more suseptable to a cold, but <br/>
the virus or the bacteria have to be presant in order to actually get <br/>
sick from being cold. Anyway, thanks again. Corallyn</div>
