&lt;&lt; Well, for me I&#39;m an on-the-go kind of person. There&#39;s a lot of things I&#39;d <br/>
rather be doing than eating, frankly. I like food, it&#39;s good nourishment for <br/>
the body, but that&#39;s mostly what it is to me. If you gave me the choice <br/>
between being able to have a really gorgeous 4-course meal and going on a 40 <br/>
mile bike ride, I&#39;d choose the cycling any old day. Now someone else might <br/>
choose the meal, but that doesn&#39;t make them any more joyful, soulful, or <br/>
refined than me. I get my joy elsewheres. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES!! I get so much more soul nourishment from biking or being outdoors. Dh <br/>
and I  doing our triathlon training together is hugely enjoyable for both of <br/>
us.<br/>
The Italian version of lots of good food, good wine and good conversation is <br/>
wonderful...but not realistic for day to day here.<br/>
I do cook from scratch some, but I also use convenience foods to free up time <br/>
for us all to do things we REALLY love to do together.<br/>
I don&#39;t think idealizing meal time and trying to make it the end all be all <br/>
is necessary in an unschooling family where interests are varied and <br/>
connection time plentiful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much idealizing it or making it the end all be all but <br/>
a wonderful experience that enriches the lives of our families and ourselves. <br/>
 For you it might be entirely something else, like that bike ride or whatever <br/>
but there have to be plans and equipment and driving to complete a 40 mile <br/>
bike ride.  The family meal can be prepared will there is a multitude of <br/>
other things going on but you are still accessible to those why need you.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe it still hasn&#39;t been explained properly by me.  I know many <br/>
families who feel just as you do.  Meal time isn&#39;t important, everyone is <br/>
feed and no one goes hungry, there is way more to life than cooking can <br/>
provide and that&#39;s OK.  But I&#39;m telling you that when children from THOSE <br/>
families come to my house they are so very impressed that this happens almost <br/>
every day and I sometimes even feel embarassed because they make such a big <br/>
deal of it.<br/>
<br/>
One 18 year old insists you have to be &quot;rich&quot; to do that and his dectective <br/>
father and school teacher mother could never afford to EAT everyday.  Of <br/>
course they EAT everyday!  Their kids are 18 and 20 and are in college and <br/>
the mother just does not feel like cooking after working all day, maybe if <br/>
she knew how important it is to her son she might, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
Again, maybe this doesn&#39;t become so important until the children are older, <br/>
but I&#39;ve always done it, or maybe it&#39;s just important for that very reason?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869720877">I don&#39;t think  I&#39;ve made me point well.....<br/>
I am not trying to downplay to joy of cooking homemade foods nor family time <br/>
spent eating together. I think it&#39;s important to cook foods everyone enjoys <br/>
and remember each persons favorites.<br/>
I am trying to point out that as a family, we are all together playing and <br/>
connecting quite often and it doesn&#39;t make a bit of difference if families <br/>
are connecting and talking together over food or simply playing.<br/>
Food doesn&#39;t have some magical hold over our lives to the point that we <br/>
aren&#39;t going to connect deeply in the absence of it.<br/>
It does add pleasure and enjoyment to our lives, just like a lot of other <br/>
things do.<br/>

time?  <br/>
<br/>

the Pooh (complete with balloons, crepe paper, toys wrapped up like <br/>
presents, a card, and leftover superbowl party cake), my 5 year old <br/>
wants me to help him finish putting together his playmobil pirate <br/>
ship, and my 9 year old wants me to plan for girls&#39; club that we&#39;re <br/>
having at our house tomorrow and help her hem her new jeans.  I also <br/>
really need to clean the playroom. <br/>
<br/>
If I have to take the time to make a big meal and then do all the <br/>
cleaning up that a big meal requires, one of those cool things that <br/>
my kids want to do with me probably won&#39;t happen.  <br/>

<br/>
I think that depends on who and what and where you are. I can take <br/>
off for a bike ride from my front door with no plans, just the <br/>
equipment of my bike, a powerbar in my pocket, and no driving and be <br/>
back home in 2 hours. I can&#39;t imagine *driving* to go for a bike <br/>
ride, that seems to defeat the purpose. We go for family bike rides <br/>
in much the same way (though my kids aren&#39;t up to riding 40 miles of <br/>
course :-). But preparing a meal is more or less a stressful event <br/>
for me, as I am not a good cook. Baking cookies or something can be <br/>
fun, but that&#39;s different than a daily meal. So for our family, the <br/>
bike ride would involve far less preparation and stress and only <br/>
minimally more equipment (you ought to see my kitchen after I cook, <br/>
my DH will remark &quot;Where&#39;s the battle?&quot;).<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>such a big <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; deal of it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure, because it&#39;s something different. My kids love to go over to <br/>
our friends house where the mother always has a grand meal on the <br/>
table and it is a very special occasion. They *are* most impressed <br/>
(and so am I!). Then again, I don&#39;t think my very, extremely active <br/>
kids would be happy living in that house because the parents are much <br/>
more homebodies than we are. My kids go nuts if we stay in the house <br/>
one day, let alone every day! My strengths don&#39;t lie in cooking, but <br/>
they do lie in being active enough to keep up with my kids running <br/>
around all day, taking them biking, swimming, hiking, camping, to <br/>
track meets, fun runs, the beach, the mountains, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy for me to look at the way other people do things and <br/>
conclude that my parenting is somehow lacking because I don&#39;t hand-<br/>
cook every meal like one of my friends or hand-knit and sew all my <br/>
kids clothes like another, or sit down and do crafts all day like <br/>
another, or whatever. But we can&#39;t all be everything. I think the <br/>
best I can hope for is to be myself, and to meet the needs of my kids <br/>
as best as I can do. And if that means that they lack a sit-down <br/>
dinner every night, but get to go for a family bike ride, I&#39;m sure <br/>
they&#39;ll be fine :-)<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I&#39;ve always done it, or maybe it&#39;s just important for that very <br/>

<br/>
Maybe. My mom isn&#39;t a particularly good cook, and I never missed it, <br/>
not even when I was older. I don&#39;t like to sit still, and I was <br/>
always glad not to be forced to sit down for a whole meal except on <br/>
those torturous holiday occasions. It really is more or less torture <br/>
to have to sit down for an hour just to eat. I think that&#39;s okay. <br/>
It&#39;s okay to accept that people are wired differently and that <br/>
something that is very pleasurable for one person is not particularly <br/>
so for another. My DH is even worse. Even in a restaurant he wants to <br/>
eat as quickly as possible and have it over with. He&#39;s more of a <br/>
fidget-body than I am, and I&#39;m sure if his childhood was being lived <br/>
now, he&#39;d be put on various drugs to &quot;control&quot; his hyperactive <br/>
tendencies.<br/>
<br/>
One size will never fit all, and I&#39;m glad that I got to be my kids&#39; <br/>
parents, because our lifestyle fits them fine. Who knows, maybe <br/>
they&#39;d think it was torturous to be born into a family that has <br/>
regular sit-down meals!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the thing, we do all of the above stuff TOO.  The family meal isn&#39;t <br/>
our ONLY source of family time, it&#39;s in addition to the baseball games, <br/>
basketball games, swim meets, All Star Cheer practices and competitions, <br/>
camping, the beach college games, high school games, museum trips, it&#39;s more <br/>
of a coming together AFTER all the experiences have wound down and reflecting <br/>
on our day, EVEN if we&#39;ve been together all day it&#39;s a good thing to reflect <br/>
on what was or wasn&#39;t accomplished or enjoyed or even disliked in that span <br/>
of hours before.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not one or the other at all, Monday&#39;s and Wednesdays are leftover or <br/>
eating out days in our house because of the youngest daughters committment <br/>
(which turned into a family committment) for All Star Cheer competition <br/>
squad.  But more often than not we are all there even though I didn&#39;t run <br/>
around and prepare a brand new meal for the evening.<br/>
<br/>
I understand if meal time is not an important thing to some families and <br/>
that&#39;s fine, I know LOTS of people who don&#39;t make it a priority and their <br/>
lives are rich and full without it.  For ME and MY family it is a VERY <br/>
important part of keeping us close and it makes my family feel loved, so I do <br/>
it, in addition to all the other things that I would never miss out on with <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest son has probably played more than 2000 baseball games in his <br/>
life, when he&#39;s angry with me he likes to remind me of the ONE baseball game <br/>
I missed of his (giving birth) and the ONE game I watched from the car (after <br/>
giving birth) that&#39;s everything from T-Ball to post HS American Legion and <br/>
about to be college ball... and all my kids are that involved, some even more <br/>
so with two or three sports/jobs/interest ect.  <br/>
<br/>
So we are busy too, you don&#39;t have to be a &quot;homebody&quot; just because you <br/>
lovingly prepare meals for your family.<br/>

clean up.  If I were the one doing the cleaning up it would be very difficult <br/>
for me as well.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago one of my children or husband got a big magnet that is still on the <br/>
fridge, it says;  &quot;good cooks NEVER do dishes&quot; and we live by that in our <br/>
house.  If one of the children were to ever prepare a meal ( it MIGHT happen) <br/>
then of course, no clean up for them that night.<br/>
