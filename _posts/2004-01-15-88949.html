<div id="ygrps-yiv-890157257">I was doing some reading at the NHEN website this evening when I came across <br/>
a story written by Mark Hegener titled &quot;Crafting Ships&quot;. This paragraph stood <br/>
out:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What was his lesson in all of this drilling and sawing and sanding? Was <br/>
there a lesson for me as well? Who dare put a value on it? There will be no <br/>
portfolio material produced with this lesson. The project will probably not even <br/>
rate precious display case status for very long, because there are always so <br/>
many of these projects and we have many children doing them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It made me think of all the times these past few years that I have wrestled <br/>
with myself to let go of wanting to record each moment like this. All the <br/>
little self initiated projects my kids start, some get finished, some don&#39;t. All <br/>
the while they are learning, geesh, I even start to dislike that word sometimes, <br/>
all the while they are doing what?  How do we describe just living and <br/>
following ones heart? All the while that is going on I too have a lesson going on, <br/>
that of watching and enjoying and learning that not everything along the path <br/>
has to be photographed or put in a scrapbook for some reviewer down the road. <br/>
There will be enough to present to the reviewer at the end of the year and <br/>
something&#39;s are just meant to be done for their own sake. To be enjoyed for that <br/>
time and not to worry what anyone is getting out of it. I have been learning to <br/>
calm myself down to let living happen. Just daily living, trusting and moving <br/>
on.<br/>
