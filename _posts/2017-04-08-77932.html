<div id="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><html><head></head><div class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">It’s nice to see a new question! :-)</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">Anonymously sent:</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"></div>We decided to not send our little boy to school when he was 2 and since then we have learned so much and recently have taken the unschooling route as it makes so much sense to us but we still have &quot;wobbles&quot; and both my husband and I, although we are on the same parenting page, are often finding ourselves slipping into controlling comments and are trying so hard and reading books and listening to Unschooling Podcasts. Currently our previously social and outdoorsy loving little boy is now playing Minecraft from Morning to night but we are trying to go with it, keep connection and trust him but we are finding it hard!)<br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">Anyway! What I actually wanted to ask you and the group please is this :-<br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">Our little lad is 5 this month. Recently he has an aversion to trimming his nails. We have gone with it for the past couple of months - we have offered to do it but also to help him to do it himself. He says he is scared because it hurts. He agreed that we could do it while he was asleep which we tried twice but he woke and declined it as said he was scared and it hurts. <br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">The only reason this is now a concern is because his feet are hurting because his nails are growing very long and curling into his own toes!! My husband last night said we are neglecting him and we were both so upset. <br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">We really want to respect his body autonomy and wouldn&#39;t ever force it because of his rights and the trauma, but at the same time we have tried talking to him about keeping his feet healthy and explaining that if we/he tried it he may see that it doesn&#39;t actually hurt. <br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">However I am aware that to him, he IS scared and it actually may hurt because the tension in anticipation of us doing it must be awful. <br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">We have offered him to do it using scissors, various clippers and even biting them off with his teeth!<br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">Just feeling a little stuck now as they are now not growing well. It has been quite a few months <img alt="&#x00d83d;&#x00de2c;" class="ygrps-yiv-425543425_1ift ygrps-yiv-425543425_2560 ygrps-yiv-425543425img" style="border:0px;display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 1px;" id="ygrps-yiv-425543425CBD40E1A-8063-4AF0-A057-F262BC0BF191" src="cid:2DEE2E92-C43B-4811-899C-2E2998C29649@PK5001Z"> Do we wait until he can&#39;t put his shoes on because of pain? This just doesn&#39;t feel right either! I think we need some suggestions that we may not have thought of. <br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425"><br class="ygrps-yiv-425543425">Many thanks for your help.</html></div>

If it’s not that, maybe he doesn’t like the sound of nail clippers.  I don’t.  I can’t be in the room when someone else is using nailclippers.  It’s different if it’s me, or they’re doing it to me—still not good, but not full-nervous-system painful.  What some people get with chalk on a chalkboard (rarer now than it once was) or someone squeaking the outside of a balloon, I get from nail clippers.<br/>
<br/>
What helps me, for me is to ONLY clip mine when I’m just out of a bath or shower (hot tub, when ours worked—poor wooden hot tub gave up in the New Mexico dry heat after eight years—a good run.<br/>
<br/>
For hand, I soak one hand for about five minutes in warm water and then cut those nails.  Then I soak the other hand.  If I do both at once, the sound starts to bother me before I finish.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe consider doing the one worst toenail, after a warm soak, and see how he handles that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another different idea is to take him to a pedicure shop—not to have his done, but to see you (and maybe his dad) have yours done by a professional.  If it seems interesting and not scary to watch, maybe he would let you play that at home for him.  Or maybe he would be willing to let the pedicure professionals do his another time.  I wouldn’t press him to do it right then, but give him time to think.<br/>
<br/>
Your husband is right, about the neglect.  There are things parents can’t leave alone.  Ingrown toenails can be bad, and shoes are required lots of places, and you can’t say to any social worker or judge “Well, we’re unschoolers, and didn’t want to take away his choice.”<br/>
<br/>
-=-We really want to respect his body autonomy and wouldn&#39;t ever force it because of his rights-=-<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere (and not in this discussion, I don’t think) you’ve picked up slogans or “truths” that aren’t true.  And cutting a child’s nails isn’t “force” and shouldn’t be trauma, unless you have layered it in “rights” and “body autonomy” that are slogans and not real “rights.”<br/>

<br/>
Rephrasing it without “teach” will be better for helping others with unschooling (and for moving a step closer).<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/teach">http://sandradodd.com/teach</a><br/>
<br/>
With Kirby, our oldest, Keith and I helped him to breathe sometimes, and he asked me about meditation one day when he was nine, and I showed him that, with breathing to a slower heartbeat.  Lots of times we had already helped him breathe when he was afraid or in pain, and we saw him help other kids as he got older, and was in situations where a child might need help calming down (he taught karate to younger kids when he was a teen, and he worked running gaming sessions and tournaents for a gaming shop—sometimes tempers rose up, but he was a good coach).<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/teaching">http://sandradodd.com/teaching</a><br/>
It might seem minor, but it will make a big difference to stop using “teach” even in thoughts.<br/>

<br/>
That’s a good idea!  <br/>
Maybe a variety to try—metal file, glass file, emery boards.  One of them might not bother him (feeling or sound, whatever it might be).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Instead of trying to persuade him to see your point of view, meet him where he is.  He is 5yo, into Minecraft, and nail trimming is scary to him. <br/>
 <br/>
Approaching it playfully is likely to help you meet him where he is… Maybe he could be a bear who needs his claws trimmed to keep from popping the balloons he wants to play with.  <br/>
<br/>
Could he be a crocodile who just needs his trimmed a little bit, under water.  He could put on flippers with his toes sticking out, wear goggles, snorkel etc.  Any sound would be dulled.<br/>
<br/>
Could he be a miner who’s also scared, but needs his nails trimmed so he doesn’t keep getting them knocked off on rocks etc.  Maybe the only tool he can find is a file - filing them down a bit may help get him started.<br/>
<br/>
Playing barefoot at a beach may help to naturally trim his nails.<br/>
<br/>
I heard of someone who collected their nail clippings and tied them up in the toe of a stocking to make a scourer! Maybe a miner could use one of those for polishing rocks….<br/>

<p>My son has never liked having his nails cut - it didn&#39;t matter what implement I tried - scissors, clippers, he was worried I was going to cut him and said it hurt.<br>
<br>
Somehow, he&#39;s figured out how to keep them short himself...I just asked him - he said he bites them - both his toe nails and his finger nails. He used to overbite his finger nails, but stopped when he made them bleed - now they are just short, but not too short.<br>
<br>
Other ideas (biting one&#39;s own toenails might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea...or they may not be that flexible!)....After a bath, shower or soaking feet, toenails can be very soft - sometimes soft enough to pull off with just fingers, or else cut a little bit
 into the side and then use fingers.<br>
<br>
An emery board could also work - but may only once they are a bit shorter than currently. And again it&#39;ll be easier if they are soft.<br>
<br>

<br>
You can both respect him and find a way to keep his nails short. If he ends up with ingrown toenails or an infection - you WILL &#39;have to&#39; force him and it&#39;ll be in a hospital - where doctors may ask you uncomfortable questions...better to figure out a better&nbsp;way
 at home now..</span></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580504427">Reading this made me think of cutting my dog’s nails - it sounds funny, but nail clipping in dogs can be hugely difficult and there are whole Facebook groups set up around desensitising and helping the dog be comfortable with the process.  <br/>
<br/>
As well as the suggestions given, especially the ones about letting them soften in the bath, here are some others, inspired by my dog, that may help:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- take him to a beach or tennis court and let him run around barefoot.  If it’s safe, he could also do this on the cement pathways<br/>
- Start by just touching the clippers (or scissors) to each nail.  If he’s ok with that, press them a little against each one.  Then leave it for a day<br/>
- If you can have him be a bit distracted by a tv show, try just clipping the tiniest, tiniest shaving off one nail.  Then leave it again. Over a few days, see if you can clip a tiny little bit off each one. Only ever do one during each session. This is also something you could do while he’s asleep <br/>
- use a file, or help him to use one. <br/>
<br/>
Of course treats are a big part of the process with dogs.  That might help here too!  One tiny clip and then a treat. <br/>
<br/>
He can also try peeling them off while he’s sitting in the bath.  That’s actually how I do my toe nails, it’s a habit I’ve always had and I find it strangely satisfying.</div>
