<div id="ygrps-yiv-194486169">Hi Janet,<br/>
My dd (8 and 10) have enjoyed the American Girls series.  We also read some <br/>
&quot;If you&quot; (during the Civil War, traveled on the underground railroad, <br/>
etc.)books.  Those aren&#39;t exact titles but they all start with &quot;If you&quot;.  <br/>
You might also look at some very junior biographies.  My 10yod has begun <br/>
reading the &quot;Dear America&quot; books.<br/>
Do you have any museums near you?<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any games.  My dds do enjoy dressing up and pretending they <br/>
are people from various times.<br/>
The most important thing is be sure your daughter is interested in learning <br/>
about history.  You could bring the books home from the library and have <br/>
them available to her and let her indicate her interest. If she&#39;s not <br/>
interested now, maybe she will be later.  The history will stay the same and <br/>
maybe other interests of hers will involve history.<br/>
do you mind a personal question?  What do the abbreviations after your son&#39;s <br/>
name mean?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5111225">Hi Valerie - i&#39;m behind in checkin emails... and am checking them in<br/>
reverse! Thanks for sharing your experience with FLO.. the more I hear the<br/>
merrier! Sounds like you did the home visit assessments before that? How did<br/>
you like that and what made you change to doing the test? i understand that<br/>
you like the test now due to it being shorter and simpler, but why did you<br/>
change? Just curious... I find often that hearing other people&#39;s experiences<br/>
triggers trains of thought that might not have occurred otherwise - so<br/>
thanks for the input!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was getting worried in advance!! I do<br/>
&gt; my best worrying that way...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have discovered FLO (I was on the WHEN list for awhile) and I&#39;m intrigued<br/>
&gt; by the evaluation option. Did you do that or the test?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nina<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **Oh Nina, you were born to be a mom if you excell in worrying. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We did the Metropolitan test thru FLO. I chose that one because it was the<br/>
&gt; shortest. Just $22 I think. It&#39;s like a shorter version of the CAT. They<br/>
&gt; sent it to me. I &quot;administered&quot; it to my 10 year old daughter. We mailed it<br/>
&gt; back. They sent the results. It was much simpler than I expected. This was<br/>
&gt; my daughter&#39;s first test. We&#39;ve never even done worksheets, so I wondered<br/>
&gt; how she&#39;d do. Now I know these tests are bogus, but (since we opted to play<br/>
&gt; the game) it was great that she did so well. She tested at a 5th grade level<br/>
&gt; and scored anywhere from grade 4.5 to 11.0. That really reassured the<br/>
&gt; grandparents---ha. So it wasn&#39;t any big deal. We&#39;re the only ones with the<br/>
&gt; test scores. FLO doesn&#39;t turn it into anyone else. And I&#39;m sure no one will<br/>
&gt; ever ask to see them, either. I know a mom up in Edmonds with 8 kids...has a<br/>
&gt; box stuffed full of annual tests...and is disappointed that no one ever<br/>
&gt; wants to see them. (she&#39;s kidding about being disappointed of course) We did<br/>
&gt; evaluations for the 2 years prior to testing. That&#39;s great, too, depending<br/>
&gt; on who&#39;s doing it. I think we&#39;ll stick with testing just because it was<br/>
&gt; simpler and shorter.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**Hi Nina. I didn&#39;t use FLO for the assessments. My cousin was a certified<br/>
state teacher so I had her do it. Back then, Cristina was 8-9 and had this<br/>
panic over tests. I have no idea why since she&#39;d never had one. So we&#39;d go<br/>
to my cousin&#39;s house and she&#39;d talk with her about what she knows and she<br/>
also had her fill out some quizzes. Then my cousin would write a note (for<br/>
my records) saying that Cristina was on par with her grade level.<br/>
<br/>
Then this cousin let her certification slide and I discovered FLO. I was<br/>
quietly worried that Cristina would flip over having to take a test, but<br/>
when it came down to it there was no problem. I think she was just scaring<br/>
herself from what she had heard from ps kids and what she saw on TV.<br/>
