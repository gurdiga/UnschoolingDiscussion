<div id="ygrps-yiv-522244532">I&#39;m new to the group.  I have a question that I would like to hear a radical<br/>
unschooler&#39;s (or really any) approach on.<br/>
<br/>
A little background: I have 3 kids (almost 6, 3 and 10 weeks) and a husband<br/>
that travels regularly.  Since we moved to this house we have had a problem<br/>
with the neighbourhood boys (around 5, 7 and 11) that have no boundaries and<br/>
play out on the street constantly.  Our neighbourhood recently had a child<br/>
abductor around, so it is not safe enough for this.  They also tormented one<br/>
of our dogs (over the fence) to the point that he now tries to bite children<br/>
he doesn&#39;t know out of fear.<br/>
<br/>
So every day when they finish school they turn up on my doorstep (their<br/>
mother really has little to do with them) and want to come inside and play.<br/>
While they are here, things are misused and broken and the house is<br/>
completely trashed.  I can&#39;t redirect them outside because the dog will bite<br/>
one of them.  I honestly don&#39;t have the energy to clean up after 3 extra<br/>
children, while carrying my baby and tending to the household, kids and<br/>
pets.  I have even asked the boys to help tidy up before they go but they<br/>
just run off.  They will stay for hours at a time with no consideration for<br/>
meal times (sorry, turning into a rant now!).<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that my kids want to play with them.  I don&#39;t want to say no,<br/>
but have because I just can&#39;t face having them over again.  I have tried to<br/>
explain that they create a lot of extra work for me and it&#39;s just too much,<br/>
but my kids just want to play (I can&#39;t blame them for that).<br/>
<br/>
So what would you do?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212906700">Hi Melissa,<br/>
Do you have the energy to invite the kids over for a popsicle and sit  <br/>
them down to discuss some rules of your home.<br/>
Let them know that you like it when they visit, but they need to  <br/>
understand that there are rules in your home.<br/>
Maybe they can make up their own rules as well.<br/>
Be respectful of the home.<br/>
Kind to the dog. - you may have to reintroduce the dog to the  <br/>
children (you holding the dog) and them gently approaching him.<br/>
Maybe a time limit to their visit (ie: leave 1/2 hour or hour before  <br/>
your lunch or dinner)<br/>
Clean up together before leaving. etc.<br/>
If the rules are not followed then they will have to leave.  The ball  <br/>
will be in their court.<br/>
It may take a few goodbyes before they get that the rules cause  <br/>
consequences.<br/>
You will be able to say yes a lot more to them if they understand  <br/>
reasonable boundaries.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987632380">Wow! How rude are you?!!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has 3 kids. She has helped more people with her wit, wisdom and <br/>
experience than your insulting of her will ever do.<br/>
<br/>
Rereading Sandra&#39;s post I see nothing to take offense at. Really. Someone <br/>
came looking for help with children and Sandra offered very practical <br/>
suggestions. Your response isn&#39;t practical, nor is it about the problems the <br/>
OP was having. It was just a mean remark. That&#39;s all. Just mean.<br/>

<h4>Sandra Dodd</h4>
<time>22 Jun 2007, at  7:31am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963564100">-=-God, does Sandra Dodd even HAVE kids? Why does everything she  <br/>
types sound so<br/>
holyier than thou Martha Stewart evil mother in law-ish??-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you asking God, or are you asking the others on the list?<br/>
<br/>
God knows, and at least twenty of the other moms have been to my  <br/>
house, and at least 100 of the other moms have met my kids at  <br/>
conferences.<br/>
<br/>
I let that post through because it made me laugh.  And those who&#39;ve  <br/>
been to my house will  laugh at the &quot;Martha Stewart&quot; comment.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how your mother in law is.  Mine&#39;s pretty harsh, but she  <br/>
backed down and put IN WRITING that our homeschooling was having   <br/>
really good results.<br/>
<br/>
You know why she wrote that?  Because after years of her being SURE  <br/>
that the other grandkids would turn out better, they did not.  They  <br/>
got surly and awful and their go-to-church parents separated and  <br/>
those kids never came to visit them when they weren&#39;t forced to, but  <br/>
mine go voluntarily and sweetly.  Kirby went when he was 18, and he  <br/>
had been pretty much excused-for-all-time when he was 15 and she said  <br/>
none of her boys ever went on family trips once they turned 15.<br/>
<br/>
She wrote that because she saw the results of what we were doing.   <br/>
When she told Marty, who was a little guy maybe five or six, that he  <br/>
couldn&#39;t have any dessert because he didn&#39;t finish his (canned)  <br/>
vegetables, I pushed my little raisin compote bowl over and said he  <br/>
could have mine, without a glance at my mother in law.<br/>
<br/>
She changed her mind and admitted it, which people do here too, if  <br/>
they stick around long enough.<br/>
<br/>
I cared more about Marty than I did about her.<br/>
I care more about the children of those who come to this list than I  <br/>
care about the moms.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom&#39;s priority is her own feelings and the work it will take for  <br/>
her to clean up after a visit, that will be an ongoing problem for  <br/>
her children.<br/>
<br/>
I put my kids&#39; happiness and peace and learning above my own.  The  <br/>
results are stunning.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unexpected">http://sandradodd.com/unexpected</a><br/>
<br/>
I want to help other people learn the simple, simple truth that if  <br/>
they are generous with their children, the whole family&#39;s life gets  <br/>
better right then and there and stays better for years, maybe for the  <br/>
rest of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
The whole world around you will say &quot;take care of yourself first;  <br/>
they&#39;re just kids; tell them what to do; don&#39;t take any lip; you&#39;re  <br/>
the parent; you&#39;re the boss; it&#39;s your house; you know what&#39;s best;  <br/>
they don&#39;t ned to be making choices; they&#39;re too young; what do they  <br/>
know?; you waited all these years, now it&#39;s your turn; keep them in  <br/>
line; don&#39;t let them make a mess; make them clean up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If those are the messages you like, this isn&#39;t the list for you.   <br/>
Coming here and complaining about the list only makes a person look  <br/>
churlish and immature.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to stick around and READ and think instead of writing  <br/>
snarky little complaints, it might do your family a lot of good.  If  <br/>
you don&#39;t want to do your family a lot of good, this isn&#39;t the list  <br/>
for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to change, if you don&#39;t want to consider ideals and  <br/>
aim for them, but you&#39;re happy with justifications and excuses, this  <br/>
isn&#39;t the list for you.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was five and Marty was nearly three when I had Holly.<br/>
Kirby is nearly 21 and Holly is 15 and a half.  They&#39;re healthy,  <br/>
happy, respected and respectful.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has worked since he was 14 and was offered a job.  He still  <br/>
lives at home, though others have asked him to move into apartments  <br/>
with them because they LIKE him.  He&#39;s considering moving to Austin  <br/>
in August because his job is moving there.  He might or might not,  <br/>
but we&#39;ve assured him he can try it, learn what it&#39;s like to live  <br/>
somewhere else, and come home whenever he wants to.  (Other families  <br/>
we know threw their kids out when they were 18, or started charging  <br/>
them serious rent, or gave them a choice of military or college,  <br/>
period.--THAT sounds evil to me.)<br/>
<br/>
Marty has worked since he was 14 and was offered a job, but this  <br/>
summer he&#39;s living on his savings (many thousands of dollars he  <br/>
didn&#39;t spend while he was working) so he can travel a little, take  <br/>
his sister to a music festival in another city overnight, do some  <br/>
camping, and goof around.    Yesterday he went to a movie with  <br/>
friends, even though he said he would go with me to do something that  <br/>
evening--a presentation on medieval costume.  He assured me they  <br/>
would be there, in costume, on time.  They were there, they were  <br/>
early, they helped arrange the tables and cleaned up afterwards.  Not  <br/>
many fifteen year olds and their 21 and 22 year old friends will do  <br/>
that for a mom.  They did it for themselves, though.  They were  <br/>
interested in the topic.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is in Rhode Island visiting another unschooling family.  She  <br/>
saved her own money from babysitting, bought the ticket and took  <br/>
spending money.  I was sad to take her to the airport.  She was glad  <br/>
to go, but was already looking forward to coming back to hang out  <br/>
with her friend Sierra, and with London and his brother Romeo and  <br/>
their friend Buddy.  She has plans for 4th of July, and that music  <br/>
festival, and a medieval campout.  She and Marty are going to Florida  <br/>
and North Carolina in August.  She&#39;s going with me to a homeschooling  <br/>
conference in September.<br/>
<br/>
What was the question?  Do I have kids?<br/>
God knows I have kids.<br/>
God knows they&#39;ve never been to school, nor been &quot;schooled at home,&quot;   <br/>
and that they&#39;re very HAPPY kids.<br/>
<br/>
God knows this list has helped other people&#39;s families be happier too.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-494496847">I believe in ballance. I have found that if I say yes to my children <br/>
all the time and forget to say yes to what I want or need then I am <br/>
too drained to be a happy mom. I believe the problem lies within <br/>
society. In an ideal society the mom would have much much nore help. <br/>
She wouldn&#39;t have to do it all herself. Last night my 18 month old <br/>
was up from 1-5am. She was teething. Then my four year old got up at <br/>
6.30am. We all sleep together. My four year old still nurses once a <br/>
day in the morning. I just couldn&#39;t do it this morning. My husband <br/>
couldn&#39;t help with night time parenting because he has a hard day of <br/>
work. I have piles of dishes and I even have a mothers helper this <br/>
morning. I still just need to relax. I only have two kids. I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine what it is like to have more right now. When I can&#39;t nurse my <br/>
four year old because I am too wiped out I tell her why and offer her <br/>
a bottle of rice milk and hold her when she cries. When I just can&#39;t <br/>
say yes because it is too draining for me physically(I don&#39;t want to <br/>
example to them that I give and give and give and never nourish <br/>
myself) I offer as many alternatives as I can. If you can afford it a <br/>
mothers helper can really be a blessing.  I practice getting my <br/>
children involved in finding a solution. They are so smart. You <br/>
already told them that you don&#39;t like cleaning up after the neighbors <br/>
kids. You are exausted and caring for a baby. Maybe ask them what <br/>
they think could be a solution. If you don&#39;t like having the <br/>
neighbors children around and you still want to honor your childrens <br/>
desires then maybe a compromise would work. Maybe allow the visitors <br/>
for 45 min only?  Or see if you could find other friends with <br/>
children to come over for a visit. Maybe your kids would like to play <br/>
with thier kids as well and then there would be another parent around <br/>
to clean up after their own children.<br/>
I wish I could send you a mothers helper. Maybe lots of them. I <br/>
really think us moms don&#39;t have enough support in this society. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329414426">Well I&#39;m not G-d  -  wouldn&#39;t want to get struck by lightening or anything ;)      (my favorite saying to my 13 yr old son when he makes an: I wonder about religion and G-d observation - our son dissects everything even G-d and religion)<br/>
<br/>
But what was wrong with Sandra&#39;s responses ?  - I thought they were very practical - not way out there in thinking - just bring the dog in and let the kids play outside is very simple IMO - not evil at all.  Sometimes we cannot see the forest for the trees (cannot see the big picture due to being bogged down in details) or cannot see the trees for the forest (cannot see the details due to only seeing the big picture) because we are so caught up in the moment - so we ask for help / suggestions.  I may not even follow those suggestions, but those suggestions often stimulate my brain to think up my own solution - oh my, stimulate me into thinking for myself!!!!!  How unschoolish!<br/>
<br/>
Some day I may be a mother-in-law and my mother is a mother-in-law:   So what is with the stereotypes ? My husband certainly does not think of my mother as evil (I just asked him) - she may not be the smartest - LOL - she just got married for the fourth time last Saturday and we all think she has a screw loose but hey it&#39;s her life and I&#39;d never say this to her - but certainly not evil.  I do love her dearly - she&#39;s my mom, not perfect (no one is), but my mom anyway !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then I found out that her new hubby has a cat that they are leaving with one of his son&#39;s because my dear hubby has severe cat allergies.  She said they decided that the cat would be better off with the son because if they took the new cat to her house (which is where they will live) then we could not stay with them when we visit.  They will live in AL and we live in MO. - 16 hours away.    How very kind and considerate.<br/>
<br/>
AND my mom and I just got through exchanging emails about school and education - she is admitting for the first time that she thinks our son is getting the best there is - that if she had it to do over she would not send her children to school.  Shoot - I went and tried to find the emails so I could quote her but I&#39;ve deleted them.  Oh well they are in my heart.<br/>

all. Sometimes we cannot see the forest for the trees (cannot see the  <br/>

trees for the forest -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think I know the answer.<br/>
<br/>
People come here wanting &quot;support.&quot;<br/>
But &quot;support&quot; I think people (women) want cooing sympathy and &quot;there  <br/>
there&quot; noises.<br/>
&quot;You can&#39;t help it.&quot;<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Poor thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The support I offer is how they can change their thinking and their  <br/>
perspective and actions so that their priorities shift to the point  <br/>
that they don&#39;t NEED cooing tea-party noise, but they can take their  <br/>
confidence from their children&#39;s peace and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
So because I said &quot;Well change something,&quot; I wasn&#39;t &quot;supportive&quot; of  <br/>
the mom.<br/>
<br/>
The forest didn&#39;t come and ask for help, the tree did.  The weeping  <br/>
willow doesn&#39;t want someone to say &quot;Stop crying and look up at the  <br/>
sun and GROW!  You have baby trees down that that need you to be fun  <br/>
and good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to point out to people that they DO have choices, that  <br/>
they make choices all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Some people like to choose to think they have no choice.<br/>
That&#39;s not growth.  That&#39;s curling up and giving up.<br/>
That&#39;s martyrdom.<br/>
<br/>
Some people say putting children first is martyrdom.  Making choices  <br/>
is strength and freedom.  CHOOSING to put someone else first isn&#39;t  <br/>
even a little bit similar to feeling forced to do so.<br/>

If ALL a mom has to do to arrange for her children to have a play  <br/>
time with other kids that they wanted to have is to clean up after  <br/>
it, she should be glad, not weepy-willowy.<br/>

types sound so holyier than thou Martha Stewart evil mother in<br/>
law-ish??-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I read comments like these I image that the poster is feeling very<br/>
over-whelmed with life or with their kids.  I image that the poster<br/>
can&#39;t even comprehend that there might be a way to accommodate her kids&#39;<br/>
desires and not completely loose herself in the process.  I guess it&#39;s<br/>
because I was once that mom who read these posts and thought how harsh<br/>
(and unrealistic) they sounded.  The first time I posted (not to this<br/>
list, but one with many of the same members) I was pretty overwhelmed<br/>
and believed that I really needed time to myself (to work) and my son<br/>
had decided that he didn&#39;t want to go wherever it was I had arranged for<br/>
him to go.  My reason for posting was really about wanting ways to<br/>
manipulate him to go without it really looking like I was manipulating<br/>
him.  I was very hurt by the responses that questioned that motive and<br/>
asked how I could work with his needs and keep him with me.  I suspect<br/>
if I went back and read those posts today I would think there was some<br/>
really good advice there.  I think I would see how the posters really<br/>
cared about my kids and how they knew if I could be generous with them,<br/>
that life would indeed get better for all of us.  Being able to read<br/>
those posts differently took a shift in consciousness for me.  It was<br/>
slow and gradual and real.  I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t leave in a huff.  I&#39;m glad<br/>
I decided that it was more important to try and figure out what these<br/>
moms knew.<br/>
<br/>
Just recently, my younger son decided that he never wanted to be away<br/>
from me.  This was new for him because he had always been pretty<br/>
independent.  However, he suddenly didn&#39;t want to be any place without<br/>
me.  I never forced him to stay anywhere although this meant rearranging<br/>
my schedule many times.  Some of my more conventional friends thought I<br/>
should just peel him off of me and drive away.  But I didn&#39;t and I just<br/>
remembered that this was a season in our life and that at this moment my<br/>
son had a deep need to be with me.  I knew that he was my first priority<br/>
and whatever else I had going on could be rescheduled but his immediate<br/>
needs could not. It was fascinating watching how he worked it all out<br/>
for himself.  First, he&#39;d say that he wanted to go to so and so&#39;s house<br/>
but only if I stayed.  Then he&#39;d say that I could leave, but only when<br/>
he said I could.  Then he said I could leave, but we needed to hug and<br/>
kiss and I had to continue waving to him until I was out of sight.  Now<br/>
months later, it&#39;s just a kiss and a hug.  Yesterday, I picked him up<br/>
from a friend&#39;s house where he had spent the past 24 hours.  As we were<br/>
getting ready for bed, we were talking about his sleep-over.  I asked<br/>
him if he missed me while he was there.  He said, &quot;No, I was having fun<br/>
and I didn&#39;t think of you at all.&quot;  How sweet it that.  Because he knows<br/>
that he gets to choose when he&#39;s away from me and that I&#39;d be there in a<br/>
split second if he needed me, he is able to have such a confident and<br/>
secure attitude and completely enjoy being right where he is, with or<br/>
without me.  What a gift and a great way to be in this life!<br/>
<br/>
For this I give much credit to all you Martha Stewart Evil<br/>
Mother-In-Law-ish posters!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
Not too sweet the first few times, in my experience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago I was kinda whining about not knowing exactly where  <br/>
Marty was or exactly when he would be back (he had driven to the  <br/>
farthest highest mountains of northern Colorado ALL BY HIMSELF, and  <br/>
he&#39;s ONLY eighteen).  Kirby listened to me for a little while, trying  <br/>
to gather up some sympathy (I hoped), and said, when I slowed down,  <br/>
&quot;Wherever he is, I can guarantee he&#39;s not thinking about you.&quot;   I  <br/>
guess I had said something like &quot;Doesn&#39;t he care if I&#39;m worried?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny now, but that day I was in the mom-angst mode.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s in Rhode Island.  Mom-angst strikes.  But I don&#39;t hope she&#39;s  <br/>
thinking about me.  What an anchor THAT would be, if my kids spent  <br/>
much time thinking about what their mom thought about where they  <br/>
were.  And an evil anchor if I would get mad that they weren&#39;t  <br/>
thinking of me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sure I thought of my mom sometimes, and still do, but less and less  <br/>
as time went by.<br/>
The thoughts I think of my mom aren&#39;t always nice.<br/>
I&#39;d like to do better with my own kids.<br/>

Yes, I agree.  For a moment when DS said that he hadn&#39;t missed me at<br/>
all, I thought of kidding him by say, &quot;What?!!  Don&#39;t you love me??&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This is so true!  And getting back to the OP&#39;s request for ideas about<br/>
kids visiting her house, a shift in perspective can be huge.  <br/>
<br/>
I was having a similar challenge with a certain friend of my son&#39;s.  My<br/>
son loves this friend and loves spending time with him, but I was having<br/>
quite a challenge being with him.  He was rude and could be quite mean.<br/>
So I did some pretty extensive personal work on changing my perspective<br/>
of him and it&#39;s amazing how HE has changed. &lt;g&gt; I really want to<br/>
appreciate my son&#39;s choices in friends and respect those choices as much<br/>
as I would respect any other choice or preference.  I also want to be a<br/>
place where kids feel comfortable and want to hang.  Recently my mom was<br/>
watching my boys and another unschooling friend.  My mom made them pizza<br/>
for lunch and this friend said that she didn&#39;t like that pizza.  Being<br/>
of the old school, my mom said that she was sorry but that&#39;s what she<br/>
had made and J could eat it or not, but she wasn&#39;t fixing anything else.<br/>
(My mom was telling me this story later.)  So J said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going<br/>
to see what else is in the kitchen&quot; and proceeded to look through all<br/>
the cabinets and fridge.  My mom was taken aback by this bold tactic.<br/>
She said to me that she would never have allowed her kids to rummage<br/>
through another person&#39;s cabinets.  I laughed and said that J was<br/>
welcome to look through all my cabinets in order to find something to<br/>
eat and that I was glad that she felt that comfortable in my house.  I<br/>
also told my mom that there were many times when I was a kid that I<br/>
helped myself at friends&#39; houses.  But only in houses where I felt<br/>
welcomed and loved.  <br/>
<br/>
So maybe if those kids who are being such a challenge had somewhere they<br/>
could go where they felt loved and wanted, they&#39;d want to be more<br/>
respectful and helpful.  Maybe all they need is a safe haven and your<br/>
house can be it.  It&#39;s amazing what can happen when we just look at<br/>
kid&#39;s with a different perspective, take them seriously and help them<br/>
get their needs met.  And in being kind to these kids, your kids get to<br/>
spend time with friends they enjoy.  All the better!<br/>

&gt;Date: Fri, 22 Jun 2007 08:31:23 -0600<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-=-God, does Sandra Dodd even HAVE kids? Why does everything she<br/>
&gt;types sound so<br/>
&gt;holyier than thou Martha Stewart evil mother in law-ish??-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Are you asking God, or are you asking the others on the list?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;God knows, and at least twenty of the other moms have been to my<br/>
&gt;house, and at least 100 of the other moms have met my kids at<br/>
&gt;conferences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I let that post through because it made me laugh.  And those who&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;been to my house will  laugh at the &quot;Martha Stewart&quot; comment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know how your mother in law is.  Mine&#39;s pretty harsh, but she<br/>
&gt;backed down and put IN WRITING that our homeschooling was having<br/>
&gt;really good results.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You know why she wrote that?  Because after years of her being SURE<br/>
&gt;that the other grandkids would turn out better, they did not.  They<br/>
&gt;got surly and awful and their go-to-church parents separated and<br/>
&gt;those kids never came to visit them when they weren&#39;t forced to, but<br/>
&gt;mine go voluntarily and sweetly.  Kirby went when he was 18, and he<br/>
&gt;had been pretty much excused-for-all-time when he was 15 and she said<br/>
&gt;none of her boys ever went on family trips once they turned 15.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;She wrote that because she saw the results of what we were doing.<br/>
&gt;When she told Marty, who was a little guy maybe five or six, that he<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t have any dessert because he didn&#39;t finish his (canned)<br/>
&gt;vegetables, I pushed my little raisin compote bowl over and said he<br/>
&gt;could have mine, without a glance at my mother in law.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;She changed her mind and admitted it, which people do here too, if<br/>
&gt;they stick around long enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I cared more about Marty than I did about her.<br/>
&gt;I care more about the children of those who come to this list than I<br/>
&gt;care about the moms.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If a mom&#39;s priority is her own feelings and the work it will take for<br/>
&gt;her to clean up after a visit, that will be an ongoing problem for<br/>
&gt;her children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I put my kids&#39; happiness and peace and learning above my own.  The<br/>
&gt;results are stunning.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unexpected">http://sandradodd.com/unexpected</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I want to help other people learn the simple, simple truth that if<br/>
&gt;they are generous with their children, the whole family&#39;s life gets<br/>
&gt;better right then and there and stays better for years, maybe for the<br/>
&gt;rest of their lives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The whole world around you will say &quot;take care of yourself first;<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re just kids; tell them what to do; don&#39;t take any lip; you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;the parent; you&#39;re the boss; it&#39;s your house; you know what&#39;s best;<br/>
&gt;they don&#39;t ned to be making choices; they&#39;re too young; what do they<br/>
&gt;know?; you waited all these years, now it&#39;s your turn; keep them in<br/>
&gt;line; don&#39;t let them make a mess; make them clean up.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If those are the messages you like, this isn&#39;t the list for you.<br/>
&gt;Coming here and complaining about the list only makes a person look<br/>
&gt;churlish and immature.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you want to stick around and READ and think instead of writing<br/>
&gt;snarky little complaints, it might do your family a lot of good.  If<br/>
&gt;you don&#39;t want to do your family a lot of good, this isn&#39;t the list<br/>
&gt;for you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you don&#39;t want to change, if you don&#39;t want to consider ideals and<br/>
&gt;aim for them, but you&#39;re happy with justifications and excuses, this<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t the list for you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kirby was five and Marty was nearly three when I had Holly.<br/>
&gt;Kirby is nearly 21 and Holly is 15 and a half.  They&#39;re healthy,<br/>
&gt;happy, respected and respectful.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Kirby has worked since he was 14 and was offered a job.  He still<br/>
&gt;lives at home, though others have asked him to move into apartments<br/>
&gt;with them because they LIKE him.  He&#39;s considering moving to Austin<br/>
&gt;in August because his job is moving there.  He might or might not,<br/>
&gt;but we&#39;ve assured him he can try it, learn what it&#39;s like to live<br/>
&gt;somewhere else, and come home whenever he wants to.  (Other families<br/>
&gt;we know threw their kids out when they were 18, or started charging<br/>
&gt;them serious rent, or gave them a choice of military or college,<br/>
&gt;period.--THAT sounds evil to me.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Marty has worked since he was 14 and was offered a job, but this<br/>
&gt;summer he&#39;s living on his savings (many thousands of dollars he<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t spend while he was working) so he can travel a little, take<br/>
&gt;his sister to a music festival in another city overnight, do some<br/>
&gt;camping, and goof around.    Yesterday he went to a movie with<br/>
&gt;friends, even though he said he would go with me to do something that<br/>
&gt;evening--a presentation on medieval costume.  He assured me they<br/>
&gt;would be there, in costume, on time.  They were there, they were<br/>
&gt;early, they helped arrange the tables and cleaned up afterwards.  Not<br/>
&gt;many fifteen year olds and their 21 and 22 year old friends will do<br/>
&gt;that for a mom.  They did it for themselves, though.  They were<br/>
&gt;interested in the topic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Holly is in Rhode Island visiting another unschooling family.  She<br/>
&gt;saved her own money from babysitting, bought the ticket and took<br/>
&gt;spending money.  I was sad to take her to the airport.  She was glad<br/>
&gt;to go, but was already looking forward to coming back to hang out<br/>
&gt;with her friend Sierra, and with London and his brother Romeo and<br/>
&gt;their friend Buddy.  She has plans for 4th of July, and that music<br/>
&gt;festival, and a medieval campout.  She and Marty are going to Florida<br/>
&gt;and North Carolina in August.  She&#39;s going with me to a homeschooling<br/>
&gt;conference in September.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What was the question?  Do I have kids?<br/>
&gt;God knows I have kids.<br/>
&gt;God knows they&#39;ve never been to school, nor been &quot;schooled at home,&quot;<br/>
&gt;and that they&#39;re very HAPPY kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;God knows this list has helped other people&#39;s families be happier too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
