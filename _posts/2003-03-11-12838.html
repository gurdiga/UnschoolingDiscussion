<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525047575">Anyone new to this list should be advised that we do not ALWAYS talk about <br/>
Alan Rickman, and that this is the first time the topic of vibrators has... <br/>
(cancelled use of &quot;come up&quot; and cancelled &quot;arisen&quot;) ... been a topic (she <br/>
said again redundantly).<br/>

For those with too much class and responsibility to go to that site, I have <br/>
brought you one quote and you can feel educated without wallowing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- . . . a device the color of Barbie flesh and shaped only vaguely like the <br/>
one thing Ken could never give her-=-<br/>
<br/>
All Ken ever gave Barbie was the benefit of being half a cute couple.<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter who plays Barbies.  She has &quot;Barbieland,&quot; in a closet under <br/>
the stairs.  It&#39;s all hers, all Barbie, all the time.   I never had a Barbie, <br/>
never wanted a Barbie, played with some once when I was really young, and <br/>
I&#39;d&#39;ve rather picked dead mice up pretty much afterwards.  But that&#39;s just <br/>
me.    Holly LOVES doing their hair.  Braids, clips, curlers... loves it.  <br/>
All I like to do is separate dishes from shoes, maybe sort clothing and line <br/>
up the clone army of Kelly dolls.  <br/>

Anthropologists have postulated that the desire to &quot;groom&quot; (either<br/>
Barbie or our primate offspring) is innate in us.  (Or at least in women.)<br/>
<br/>
I used to baby-sit my step-sisters by letting them comb my hair, so I<br/>
find the theory believable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids and I saw the IMAX movie about Jane Goodall and the chimps<br/>
yesterday.  Frodo, the dominant male, demands grooming from the others but<br/>
*never* grooms them; he&#39;s described as a bully, an iron-fisted ruler of his<br/>
troop.  There was a scene where all the youngsters were playing with a troop<br/>
of baboons, but as soon as Frodo showed up, all the fun stopped and his<br/>
mortified troop began grooming him.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what that says about the desire to groom Barbie &lt;g&gt;<br/>
