<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144068654">Dear friends <br/>
<br/>
Please forgive this form letter, but I wanted to communicate with you as<br/>
quickly as possible.  Some of the families on this list (and others of<br/>
you as well) have contributed to a small fund I formed with the proceeds<br/>
from my homeschooling book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot;<br/>
(www.skylarksings.com) to help build 10,000 cyclone-proof houses in the<br/>
coastal areas of southeast India.  The funds were to be used to purchase<br/>
two cinder block-making machines.  These houses  which people in the<br/>
villages are being trained to build themselves  are replacing homes<br/>
made of mud and straw, with thatched roofs that rot easily, which are<br/>
wet inside (with children sleeping on the floor) during the entire<br/>
monsoon season, and which are often destroyed in seasonal flooding.<br/>
<br/>
I am pleased to report that the machines were purchased in February and<br/>
building is now under well underway. Each house requires 600 blocks and<br/>
contains 352 square feet of living space (this can be a little more than<br/>
double an average poor familys current living space, if you can believe<br/>
it!), plus a veranda, with space for a kitchen garden and cattle shed at<br/>
the back.  These villages are made up of 11,000 families whose ancestors<br/>
had been landless laborers for up to 700 years, but now have regained<br/>
land peacefully through the efforts of my Indian mothers organization,<br/>
Land for the Tillers Freedom (LAFTI).  As a result of her work in land<br/>
reform, she has now been formally nominated for the International Right<br/>
Livelihood Award, which is the alternative Nobel Prize awarded by the<br/>
Swedish Parliament, and given to individuals or groups who making a<br/>
lasting difference in the lives of communities through dedication to<br/>
human rights, social justice, community development, and environmental<br/>
restoration.<br/>
<br/>
I now have pictures of the blocks being made through a joint effort of<br/>
men, women, and children, and the pride in the faces of the people is<br/>
impossible to describe.  I will try to find a way to post the pictures<br/>
on the web sometime soon.  My mother takes special pleasure in reporting<br/>
that in her previous housebuilding efforts, trees (which are very scarce<br/>
in coastal South India) had to be cut down to fuel the firing of<br/>
bricks.  Cinder blocks, which provide excellent insulation against the<br/>
heat, can be made from all locally-available materials and require only<br/>
sun and water (both of which they have aplenty) for curing.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, my fathers struggle against multinational-based prawn<br/>
companies that continue to cut down mangroves and salinate the soil in<br/>
violation of Indian law, continues apace. In one village, when people<br/>
went out to protest the destruction of their livelihood (the rice<br/>
fields), the corporation hired goon squads to sit fire to all 35 homes.<br/>
I am grateful to announce that the people have now completely rebuilt<br/>
their village  in cinder block  with your help (and that of a small<br/>
Italian aid agency.)<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who are homeschooling children who might be able to<br/>
appreciate all of this (and how we homeschooling families have managed<br/>
to make a difference in such a far off place), I invite you to have them<br/>
write to me with any questions they might have  about India, about life<br/>
in a village, or about how we can all make difference in working to make<br/>
the world a better place for all of us.  I promise to answer all<br/>
questions as best I can.<br/>
