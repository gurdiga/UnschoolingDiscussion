<div id="ygrps-yiv-757304792">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Steven Johnson has an article in the July 2005 Discover magazine about<br/>
the amazing learning that goes in in video games, as well as some<br/>
recommendations for good video games. (Johnson is the author of the<br/>
book _Everything Bad is Good for You_, which is apparently debunking<br/>
myths about TV, video games, and so on.)<br/>
<br/>
You can probably find Discover at your library, or you can access the<br/>
article here:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.discover.com/issues/jul-05/features/brain-on-video-games/">http://www.discover.com/issues/jul-05/features/brain-on-video-games/</a><br/>
<br/>
You can read the full article by becoming a Discover.com member for<br/>
free and then paying $1.00 for the article.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite moment in the article is when the author is showing his<br/>
seven-year-old nephew the SimCity neighborhood that he built. When<br/>
the author notes that he&#39;s having problem getting a certain area with<br/>
factories to come back to life, the boy turns to him and says, &quot;I<br/>
think you need to lower your industrial tax rates.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeow.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248787639">I LOVE video games.  The boys are learning how to read because after <br/>
winning all the games they have, they still think that it may have <br/>
hidden things to find so they are learning how to read all the <br/>
comments that pop up on the screen.  :)  We have no game restrictions <br/>
here.  They even own the game Manhunt.  (Which I guess their was all <br/>
this conflict about because it was SOOO violent)  But we talk about <br/>
it, and they know it&#39;s a game.  The camera angles are cool, the talks <br/>
about the human body, arteries, blood, were really interesting.  There <br/>
is a lot of hide and seek strategy kinda thing going on within the <br/>
game.  They tired of it when they won it so quickly.  Right now they <br/>
love the car game?  uhh.. The grand theft auto game.  The new one.  I <br/>
am unsure of the &quot;edition&quot; of it.  But that one has &quot;missions&quot; that <br/>
are good because some of them are timed and you have to get a sequence <br/>
of events right or else you can&#39;t win it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Def. one of those things that gets a bad rap in my book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489251985">I never thought I&#39;d say it, but I love video games, too. I&#39;m watching my 10 <br/>
year old girl, playing Runescape, learning to read, asking how to spell this <br/>
word or that word, and recognizing many words from Runescape in other <br/>
contexts. And, lately she&#39;s been putting in a math oriented video game <br/>
called Operation Neptune, that we&#39;ve had hanging around the house for five <br/>
years that *I* used to play a lot, but none of the kids was into it all that <br/>
much...and now, my 10 year old plays it daily.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re an important learning tool, IMO, and I&#39;m glad we have lots of <br/>
variety for the kids to choose from. Besides! LOL my son wants a hand held <br/>
Nintendo, one of those new ones that you can move the characters with your <br/>
finger or a stylus on the screen? Well, he wants one, and so to earn some <br/>
money, he&#39;s been doing extra chores pretty much every day, and saving his <br/>
money. The cat box is being maintained, the patio is clean, the van has been <br/>
getting emptied out regularly...yeah, I like video games!<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-560758329">DS (almost 7) and I have been playing the Spyro video games together for several years.  The second and third Spyro games, especially, are our favorites.  There are certain skills I absolutely cannot master which he&#39;s mastering quite well now!<br/>
 <br/>
For a while, we also had a Barbie Explorer video game (before DS developed a very strong dislike for anything Barbie LOL) and that was fun and rather challenging -- you could also play it 2-player, which was a perk for us. Too bad we can&#39;t do that with Spyro.<br/>
 <br/>
DS has definitely honed his reading skills by playing video games. I also think it&#39;s amazing he can pick up a brand new game and figure it out rather quickly without referring to a guide -- I know this very thing was discussed somewhere, maybe on the unschooling info message boards.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690859828">Since Harry Potter&#39;s coming out Saturday :-) I thought I&#39;d let people <br/>
know there are two local (to us) kids who&#39;ve written and put out 2 CDs <br/>
of songs about Harry Potter and his world. The kids were 14 and 17 for <br/>
the first CD in 2002 and have been touring a bit the past 2 summers. <br/>
(They&#39;re schooled so perhaps even more surprising that they&#39;re rising <br/>
above the norm ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Most of the songs are ballads in a mellow punk style I guess you&#39;d call <br/>
it. We listened to the first CD and it was enjoyable :-) If you go to <br/>
their website you can listen to three songs from each album.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739813836">How cool!<br/>
(Saturday, Saturday...    waiting...)<br/>
<br/>
This morning on The Today Show they had parent/kid teams of Potter Trivia <br/>
participants.    It was cute, but as they were introducing them I was thinking <br/>
how they wouldn&#39;t have video game trivia contests on TV like that.   The the <br/>
prize for the winning team was a PS2 and games to go with it.   The girl looked <br/>
THRILLED and the mom was fine with that too.   For a second I thought those who <br/>
were so dedicated to reading might shun a video game system.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard them, but when I went to buy Keith something by his <br/>
current-favorite group right now (a weird group, too, from the Faroe Islands), another <br/>
CD was recommended at Amazon, and I&#39;ll probably buy him one of those for <br/>
Christmas, so it&#39;s not a recommendation by me because I don&#39;t know exactly what <br/>
it&#39;s like, but it&#39;s songs about the Lord of the Rings world.   It&#39;s by a Finnish <br/>
group I haven&#39;t heard.   <br/>

<br/>
 These are metal bands (odd, yeah) so it&#39;s probably not as acoustically <br/>
friendly as the Potter-song kids, which sounds pretty good.   Too bad my kids don&#39;t <br/>
like Harry Potter. &lt;g&gt;   I do though!<br/>
<br/>
The CD Keith is liking so much is called &quot;How Far to Asgaard&quot; by a group <br/>
whose name doesn&#39;t spell out right outside of the runes, but is called in English <br/>
TYR.<br/>
