 </span></blockquote>Hi Cindy!<br/>
<br/>
I think your idea about the journal is great. <br/>
<br/>
Although I&#39;m sad to see that there is no magic!!!!??? what???<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 40something &lt;g&gt; and this is news to me.<br/>
<br/>
When we talk about magic at our house, we discuss the ability to hold <br/>
something in your head long enough to make it true.<br/>
<br/>
My son wants to live in a mansion because they have people who clean up <br/>
and cook for you. He&#39;s five years old.<br/>
<br/>
We talk about how something so grandiose might take quite some years to <br/>
appear so we need to keep good thoughts about it!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe our magic isn&#39;t as instantaneous as Megan hopes it to be.. but it <br/>
does exist!!! <br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>

unfortunately it won&#39;t have that magic power.  I had thought about<br/>
giving her a nice journal and a decorated pen so we could write down<br/>
her stories about the imaginary places she&#39;s created and tell her that<br/>
the best way to visit those wonderful places is by reading and writing<br/>
about them.  Does this sound okay?  Does anyone have any other ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
