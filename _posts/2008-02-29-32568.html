Have you tried it?  I know that I really don&#39;t like sewing, but crocheting and knitting have been different for me.  I love both of those.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that I think we have to do everything our children do, but if you&#39;re willing to give it a try, maybe it won&#39;t be as bad as you think.   Yet,  if you have a strong aversion to it, maybe it will... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I do not think that you need to be a knitter in order to support your<br/>
daughter in her endeavors.  Knitters tend to be very helpful, welcoming<br/>
people.  Given a little effort she will be able to find other people to<br/>
show her whatever she wants to learn.  If you are an unwilling<br/>
participant I think that you will actually hold her back.<br/>
<br/>
Knitters are used to being the weird person in the room knitting, so<br/>
they aren&#39;t going to be phased by you reading a book.  <br/>
<br/>
I will mention that knitting is very different than sewing, so you may<br/>
love it if you tried it with an open mind.  Or you might be interested<br/>
in trying something related to knitting - like spinning or dying yarn or<br/>
weaving.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you never knit there are lots of ways to support your daughter. <br/>
Knitters love yarn.  They love to be around yarn.  Let her hang out in<br/>
yarn stores, attend knitting sessions.  Buy her yarn, lots of yarn. <br/>
There are knitting conferences with tons of classes and huge markets. (I<br/>
just got back from one in the Bay Area.)  Get her a knitting magazine,<br/>
my favorite is Interweave Knits.  Help her check out<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.knitty.com">http://www.knitty.com</a>  There are a ton of knitting blogs.  The newest<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;ve found resources and a knitting circle for her, that&#39;s  <br/>
support.  You can support her financially--get her all the yarn and  <br/>
books she wants.<br/>
<br/>
Sit at the knitting store and read a book.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Truthfully, I have no interest in any type of sewing-=-<br/>
<br/>
Knitting isn&#39;t sewing (said the non-knitting sewer defensively  <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;).  If you want to refer to them both under one header, I think  <br/>
&quot;needle arts&quot; is as close as you can come.  Fiber arts MAYBE, but I  <br/>
don&#39;t think of sewing as fiber arts.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s a technicality, but it&#39;s worth considering.  I find  <br/>
knitting and crochet repulsive, but I like sewing.  Others are the  <br/>
other way around.  Some like neither.  But support your daughter with  <br/>
transportation, financial backing and time and space for her hobby, I  <br/>
think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46184454">Thanks for all the thoughtful answers.  When I used the word sewing, I <br/>
did indeed mean all the types of things I&#39;ve had a little experience <br/>
doing, i.e. hand sewing, machine sewing, crochet, and cross stitch.  <br/>
It&#39;s been many years since I&#39;ve done any of that as I really don&#39;t <br/>
like working with my hands with needles, thread, yarn, etc.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am genuinely happy to help Allie follow this interest by providing <br/>
supplies, lessons and transportation.  I&#39;m also happy to know I don&#39;t <br/>
need to learn alongside her though I will definitely be a happy, moral <br/>
support for her.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041323981">Hi--<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think whether you knit or not will necessarily prevent her from it if it is something she <br/>
is really interested in.  When I was young I was taught beginning crochet by a kind caretaker <br/>
while my mother was ill.  She went away but I continued to crochet--even though my mother <br/>
didn&#39;t know how.  In my case I was definitely hampered by no longer having a mentor, but I <br/>
plugged away at it anyway, eventually teaching my brother who went on to make many <br/>
scarves himself.  <br/>
<br/>
I still crochet when the occasion demands.  There have been times that it has brought me <br/>
great comfort, like freshman year in college when I crocheted a huge double-strand blanket <br/>
that saw me through.  It&#39;s funny, back then I didn&#39;t even see the symbolism of making myself <br/>
a security blanket!<br/>
<br/>
So good luck to your daughter.  Joanna</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066305486">My daughter is also 10 and has been knitting for the last year and a <br/>
half. We are lucky to have a kid&#39;s knitting group at our library, but <br/>
the real key to her love affair with knitting is a fantastic book <br/>
called &quot;A First Book of Knitting for Children&quot; by Bonnie Gosse and <br/>
Jill Allerton. My daughter took off with this book and made every <br/>
single project several times over, all on her own. In fact she even <br/>
ended up teaching me how to knit, which was a lot of fun for her, <br/>
being the &quot;expert&quot; and teaching me.<br/>
<br/>
I think my daughter enjoys having an interest/skill that I am not <br/>
involved in. I don&#39;t think you need to do it with her.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about the book for this age is that the projects are <br/>
stuffed knitted animals... My daughter makes them and then plays with <br/>
them, they are her favorite toys. The patterns are very easy to <br/>
follow. The authors also have a second book with more patterns. I got <br/>
the book used from Amazon, and highly recommend it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Tina, I&#39;ll see if she wants that book.  She had her first <br/>
knitting lesson saturday morning and it was awesome.  She absolutely <br/>
loved it.  She worked on knitting all day yesterday.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to say that it&#39;s times like that where I truly appreciate <br/>
unschooling.  To see her so happy and excited about something just <br/>
makes my heart soar.  I love the zest for life that unschoolers <br/>
have.  I&#39;m still trying to find it myself.  I&#39;ve spent my life <br/>
steeped in the old trappings that kept me down.  Yesterday, I was <br/>
talking with Allie and tried to explain why I am reluctant to learn <br/>
a new skill.  I grew up with a mom who didn&#39;t understand why anyone <br/>
would want to do anything difficult.  Anytime I wanted to try <br/>
something that she thought was going to be difficult or too <br/>
challenging, she&#39;d remind me that I&#39;d probably fail and then be <br/>
depressed.  She said it wasn&#39;t worth trying if the outcome would be <br/>
miserable.  And I won&#39;t even go into the times I had school teachers <br/>
tell me I had no talent with the subject and suggest I switch to a <br/>
different class.  Ugh!  With my children, I try to focus on the <br/>
experience and not the outcome.  I just want them to enjoy life to <br/>
the fullest and not be afraid of trying things.  So Allie gave me a <br/>
hug and a kiss and told me she&#39;d be happy to teach me how to knit as <br/>
she learns.  I think it should be fun!<br/>

I love the image of your  having learned to crochet while your mother  <br/>
