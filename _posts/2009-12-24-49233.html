<div id="ygrps-yiv-58397554">Christmas and snowstorms have slowed the list because moderators are  <br/>
busy, and some posts from early in the week were still in the queue.   <br/>
Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
One was an enthusiastic reminder that the Unschoolers Winter Waterpark  <br/>
Gathering in Ohio would make a good Christmas gift for a family.    <br/>
That&#39;s true, it would, and it looks like it would be a ton of fun with  <br/>
the most expensive part for most people being just getting to Ohio in  <br/>
the winter. :-)  But the post was cut from a Word file or something  <br/>
and was full of odd symbols.  It&#39;s also regional and so not the best  <br/>
thing for the list.  Still, it DOES look super fun and here&#39;s the link:<br/>

Yesterday Keith said, kind of, &quot;Let&#39;s go get a van.&quot;  So there&#39;s more  <br/>
to the story than that, but we did.  We went to CarMax and looked at  <br/>
three used mini-vans we had already read about online.  It was  <br/>
snowing,  I picked the least expensive of the three  (and didn&#39;t even  <br/>
look at the Hondas or Toyotas because they were twice as much or more)  <br/>
and Keith is pained by spending money.   But after a few hours spent  <br/>
unexpectedly sitting in the credit union finance office, and back to  <br/>
the car dealer, I drove a van home that I hadn&#39;t expected at all when  <br/>
I woke up, and that was an AWESOME Christmas thing.  But it also took  <br/>
a day out of a busy week.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon we&#39;re going to a Christmas party/dinner at Marty&#39;s  <br/>
girlfriend&#39;s parents&#39; house.  Marty and Ashlee have been a couple for  <br/>
a year now (by one reckoning, and six months by another), and she  <br/>
wants us to meet her parents.   Kinda nervous business.  They live in  <br/>
Bernalillo (a town older than Albuquerque, I think, 15 miles north of  <br/>
here).<br/>
<br/>
So that, and Christmas itself, will cause me distractions.<br/>
<br/>
For those far to the east of here, especially, or those who don&#39;t do  <br/>
Christmas, there&#39;s a chat tomorrow which I might still be on so that  <br/>
(maybe) I can hear about Holly&#39;s Christmas, and see if anyone has  <br/>
Christmas emergency unschooling needs.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We have a different chat room.  If you were gone from the chats  <br/>
because the font was too small, this one can be adjusted on your own  <br/>
display.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that sometimes posts are waiting for approval and that the  <br/>
moderators are busy.   Things will get calmer.<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas where applicable!<br/>
