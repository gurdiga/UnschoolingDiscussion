<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070165123"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yes, I do believe that if individuals were to feel that religious<br/>

 </span></blockquote>too.<br/>
<br/>
And if it didn&#39;t?  If they just came here to try to get people to join their<br/>
religion?  What about someone who wanted to get everyone on the list to buy<br/>
a Chevy?  Maybe someone wants to convince everyone in the world to try<br/>
heroin?  What if someone came here and started talking about how bad black<br/>
people or Jews or homosexuals are and how they should all be killed?  Is<br/>
there a line you would draw anywhere?<br/>
