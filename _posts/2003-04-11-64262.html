<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712177293">That was how I understood it. And as Pam was saying about it continuing in to adulthood to mean, if they were doing something to someone that that person didn&#39;t feel confortable with, No or Stop would mean exactly that. A way of honoring another persons bounderies. At least that was how I understood it.But as usual email isn&#39;t the best way to communicate so I could be wrong. But this is something I do want my children to understand. And i want them to understand that people should honor their bounderies. Tracy<br/>

hardly ever and never use the hose unless asked or something to that effect.  <br/>
When someone says no to tickles or kisses or hugs even, that is the end of <br/>
it.  No means No.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393257212">So, as a parent, how do you enforce the rule that no means no and <br/>
stop means stop?  If you have two children, and child 1 keeps <br/>
throwing wooden blocks at child two, child one hides under a table to <br/>
keep from getting hit with the blocks, screaming, &quot;Stop throwing the <br/>
blocks at me&quot; and child 1 won&#39;t stop.  Then what? <br/>
<br/>
I know some have said in the past that you should remove the child <br/>
who&#39;s being hurt.  However, I have done that and sometimes feel like <br/>
I&#39;m just a shield, and sometimes not an effective one.  I have been <br/>
holding a hurt child only to have the other child come and try to hit <br/>
them on the leg or pull their hair while I&#39;m not looking.  WHILE I&#39;m <br/>
holding them.  Do you go somewhere and lock the door until he stops <br/>
banging on it and decides to calm down?  <br/>
<br/>
Is there ever a time that you&#39;re firm with your kids and say, &quot;NO!  <br/>
You will NOT keep hurting your sister, and then physically remove the <br/>
child from the situation?  If you tell them he has to go to his room <br/>
if he has to throw things but that he can&#39;t throw things at his <br/>
sister but he refuses to go to his room, do you physically put him <br/>
there?  If he leaves, do you keep putting him back in?  <br/>

<br/>
He doesn&#39;t need to be in his room, he needs to talk to you, after the other <br/>
kid&#39;s in a safe place.<br/>
<br/>
Probably he needs food and attention, not isolation/punishment.<br/>
<br/>
But what led up to the incident?<br/>
<br/>
The other kid might have provoked it.  It&#39;s possible.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not fair to the kids for the mom only to look at the final phase without <br/>
finding out what steps the kids too earlier to make things better or worse.<br/>

course. (Not as a punishment, the child would come out when ready and  <br/>
if it takes TOO long and I think they might really be in there feeling  <br/>
awful about what happened, I go in and hug them and maybe they cry a  <br/>
little and then we talk.<br/>

calm enough to talk it out.<br/>

If you can figure out what this is about (assuming this is behavior  <br/>

deal with the underlying issues - not with the particular incident.<br/>
<br/>
Read &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry.&quot; You&#39;ll like it - it&#39;ll give you lots  <br/>
of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I know somebody who also has three daughters. Once she said to me,  <br/>
accusingly, &quot;Your daughter said that none of your three girls have ever  <br/>
hit each other.&quot; I said, &quot;Hmmm - I think they did a time or two when  <br/>
the oldest were about 6 and 3.&quot;  She didn&#39;t believe me. She wanted to  <br/>
know what i did to punish them when they fought. John Rosemond whose  <br/>
advice shouldn&#39;t be listened to does have one really good bit - he  <br/>
says: &quot;Strike while the iron is cold.&quot; This means that responding to  <br/>
problems after-the-fact is tough - but if you plan ahead, don&#39;t wait  <br/>
until the &quot;iron is hot&quot; - the things you do when there are no problems  <br/>
can help prevent problems from occurring.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have never really had anything escalate that far.  Usually the younger one <br/>
will give a quick swat at his brother, or sometimes he thinks it is in fun <br/>
but the older one doesn&#39;t.  I usually hold the one being hurt and say that we <br/>
never leave anyone feeling hurt or sad.  We have to be there as a family for <br/>
each other. I usually repeat that No means No.  If Dallen thought is was <br/>
funny he would be laughing. I say something like would you come over hear and <br/>
help me to help Dallen feel better. I try to get the hurt one to express <br/>
their feelings and try to get the one doing the hurting to talk about how <br/>
they were feeling. Usually he comes over but if he doesn&#39;t that is OK.  I <br/>
will say something like why don&#39;t you go find a nice book for the three of us <br/>
to read together. <br/>
<br/>
Like I said it rarely gets that far I can usually see an argument in the <br/>
making and I step in to try to help them resolve the conflict in a more <br/>
appropriate manner.  What seems to be the problem and let each boy state what <br/>
they think is going on.  &quot;What can we do about it&quot; and give each child a <br/>
chance to brain storm possible solutions and I will suggest some.  It usually <br/>
takes some time but we can come to a compromise so that each one gets some of <br/>
what they want.  I try my hardest because I think problem solving is a skill <br/>
that takes practice.  I really liked the book &quot;Raising a Thinking Child&quot; at <br/>
least I think that is the title.  Haven&#39;t read it for a while.<br/>
Anyway just some random thoughts.  Real tired so they may be real random.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - it has been a long time since I dealt with these issues and I <br/>
haven&#39;t read the book in years, but I always assumed that those things <br/>
would happen and you&#39;d just keep at it. Persevere.<br/>
<br/>
The expectation that someone would be able to say these things and then <br/>
the kid would go &quot;Oh yeah&quot; is unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re doing is building up credit - it takes a while. You get <br/>
credit for listening, for commenting appropriately, for being loving <br/>
when he&#39;s not, for having good instincts about when to hug and when to <br/>
give space.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a magic pill - to use these ideas. It doesn&#39;t work <br/>
instantaneously. At least not usually - although sometimes it does seem <br/>
like a miracle cure at first.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago, at our park day, a little girl came, crying, to <br/>
her mom. Her brother was being mean, she said. In their pretend play, <br/>
she was his dog and she wanted to be named one thing and he said that <br/>
was a stupid name and told her she was named something else. Her mom <br/>
held her and hugged her while she cried and cried. She&#39;d gulp and <br/>
breathe and recover a little and look at her mom and say, &quot;Its not fair <br/>
I WANT to be Penny and he won&#39;t LET me.&quot; And then cry some more. Mom <br/>
patted her back gently. She&#39;d comment just a little, once in a while - <br/>
&quot;You REALLY want to be Penny, huh.&quot; Stuff like that. At one point mom <br/>
kind of repeated something the girl had been saying, &quot;He called the <br/>
name you want to be stupid,&quot; The girl&#39;s crying got MUCh bigger and she <br/>
said, &quot;He always thinks my  ideas are stupid because he&#39;s older and he <br/>
thinks my ideas are for babies and.....on and on in a rush of <br/>
resentment and upset all against her brother.&quot; Mom NEVER argued with <br/>
her. Just hugged her while she got it ALL out. Said things once in a <br/>
while like, &quot;Oh,&quot; or other equally sympathetic, but noncommittal, <br/>
sounds. This took a LONG time - 20 minutes maybe. The son came over in <br/>
the middle of it - one of the other kids had tried to intervene, but he <br/>
wasn&#39;t budging. Eventually the girl was done and ready to go play again.<br/>
<br/>
The mom never got up and tried to intervene and force the boy to give <br/>
in - even though I imagine it was really frustrating, considering how <br/>
silly the whole fuss seemed - who CARES what name your pretend pet dog <br/>
chooses? Answer - both of these kids cared a lot - or maybe this wasn&#39;t <br/>
even ABOUT that, really. Maybe he&#39;d been bossing her around for an hour <br/>
and this was just the final straw OR maybe she&#39;d been refusing to go <br/>
along with any of HIS ideas for the previous hour. NO way could mom <br/>
really know. Neither kid wanted to work it out - neither wanted to talk <br/>
about it at that point.<br/>
<br/>
I was SO impressed with this mom&#39;s patience. She built up HUGE credit <br/>
with her daughter - she was so there for her - so NOT impatient and <br/>
wanting her to hurry up and get over it. She didn&#39;t interfere - allowed <br/>
her daughter to set the timing. She didn&#39;t force a solution - didn&#39;t <br/>
force her to go &quot;talk about it&quot; - didn&#39;t try to make them work it out <br/>
since it was obvious that, at that time, anyway, neither wanted to do <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Her kids played happily together for hours following that incident. All <br/>
was forgotten and forgiven. Maybe they talked about it later - or maybe <br/>
not. I know they talk about stuff like that - when everybody is feeling <br/>
good and they have a bit of distance and perspective. Either way, it <br/>
was a lovely lovely thing to watch such patience and kindness and <br/>
intelligence at work!!!<br/>
