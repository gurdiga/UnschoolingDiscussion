<div id="ygrps-yiv-421128439">This is from the Writer&#39;s Almanac:<br/>
<br/>
***It&#39;s the birthday of the novelist Don DeLillo, (books by this <br/>
author) born in New York City (1936). He is the son of Italian <br/>
immigrants, and he didn&#39;t read at all when he was growing up in the <br/>
Fordham section of the Bronx. Instead, he was obsessed with games: <br/>
card games, alley games, rooftop games, fire escape games, punch <br/>
ball, stick ball, handball, or stoopball.<br/>
<br/>
But when he was 18, he got a summer job as a playground attendant. <br/>
He was supposed to patrol the park and blow a whistle if he saw <br/>
anything out of order, but instead he began to spend every day <br/>
sitting on a park bench reading books he got out of the library. He <br/>
read Melville, Hemingway, Faulkner, and James Joyce, and he <br/>
said, &quot;It was through [those books] that I learned to see something <br/>
in language that carried a radiance, something that made me feel the <br/>
beauty and fervor of words, the sense that a word has a life and a <br/>
history.&quot;***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s never too late and I&#39;m sure all those wonderful games helped <br/>
prepare his mind for his thinking and writing. <br/>
