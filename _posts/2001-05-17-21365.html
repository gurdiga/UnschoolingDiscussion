 </span></blockquote>I think schooling causes a lot of damage before the child is ready to say,<br/>
&quot;Get me out of here.&quot; I, personally, wouldn&#39;t do it. My daughters will have<br/>
to come up with some pretty compelling reasons if they ever want to try<br/>
school (and such reasons do exist, but not in first grade -- I&#39;m thinking<br/>
things like some sports team stuff, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t view school as &quot;just another way to learn&quot; where I can give them a<br/>
free choice in the matter, I view it as dangerous to them on almost every<br/>
possible level, and will protect them from it if at all possible.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I have an opinion. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s kind of like saying it&#39;s OK to drink a mild poison until <br/>
you start &quot;showing troubles&quot; and then you can stop drinking it. By <br/>
that time, the damage is done. Personally, I&#39;d avoid the poison and <br/>
I&#39;d avoid public school. I think it poisons children&#39;s minds with the <br/>
concepts that they need someone else to teach them in order to learn, <br/>
that adults can and should control every aspect of their lives, that <br/>
what 30 other children their own age think about their clothes <br/>
matters more than anything else in the world, that what those in <br/>
authority say about an issue is the definitive word, and many more <br/>
things that I really don&#39;t want my kids to learn. If I ever started <br/>
having doubts as to whether or not I should send my kid to PS, I <br/>
would go back and read John Taylor Gatto&#39;s &quot;Six-Lesson Schoolteacher&quot; <br/>
again and again until I stopped :-)  ( <br/>

<br/>
The reason kids look forward to going to public school is the <br/>
overwhelming propaganda and cultural machine that makes sure kids get <br/>
excited about it. Maybe you could talk to your daughter about her <br/>
specific concerns - what is it exactly that she wants from school. <br/>
More time with friends? Different crafts and opportunities to learn? <br/>
Riding a bus?? All of these things are things that you can arrange <br/>
for her without also burdening her with school.<br/>
<br/>
For me, school is a place where  the magic that lives inside each <br/>
child is methodically extiguished. I want to keep the magic alive for <br/>
my children as long as they want it to burn.<br/>
