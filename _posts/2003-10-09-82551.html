I LOVE THAT !!!!!!!!!!! I wrote it down so I will not forget it. <br/>
&quot;YOUR CONCERN IS APPRECIATED BUT YOUR APPROVAL IS <br/>
UNNECCESSARY&quot; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love it !<br/>
Also Mary Ellen I love your input &quot;WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW&quot; ?????<br/>
I think your response will depend on how you are approached. As you <br/>
all know one can easily get caught off gaurd while we are <br/>
undergoing &quot;interrigation&quot; but nicely put by Sandra of how they <br/>
really want to make sure that we know what we are doing <br/>
LOL.......................... I was questioned last night myself @ my <br/>
sons football field and I really can qlick with a person and be <br/>
having a wonderful conversation when all of a sudden we smash into a <br/>
brick wall as soon as I mention the word HOMESCHOOLING ! <br/>
My son and I always talk about our responses.  I tell him that we <br/>
don&#39;t owe them ANY explanation so do not feel pressured to perform <br/>
answers of what you have recently learned. When you think about it we <br/>
could reverse that one too. &quot;I don&#39;t ask you to explain why your <br/>
child is in school so don&#39;t ask me to explain why mine is not&quot;  I <br/>
guess this topic has struck a chord.  I will keep Majorie&#39;s quoye <br/>
nice and handy thank you very much.  I was wondering Majorie do you <br/>
have a nice quick one-liner for that question you all have heard a <br/>
thousand times.  &quot;oh- your still homeschooling hows that going <br/>
anyway?&quot;  (hope you can feel doubtful undertones often displayed) <br/>
WHAT IS UP WITH THAT ??? Sorry like I said it struck a chord in me.<br/>
<br/>
Tia, thanks for the virus warning :)<br/>
<br/>
Who was that who wrote about the secrets of math and gambling.  I <br/>
just got back from the casino and I could of used you at my table <br/>
LOL................<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I always say &quot;great!&quot;  and the more doubtful the undertones, the more<br/>
emphatic the response!  You can always follow up with &quot;So, how&#39;s your school<br/>
experience going?&quot; (with or without doubtful undertones depending on how<br/>
friendly you feel towards the questioner at that moment).<br/>
Remember, people that ask about homeschooling in this manner don&#39;t usually<br/>
care how homeschooling&#39;s going, they usually want you to say someting bad<br/>
about it to validate their own decision(or lack of decion!) in sending their<br/>
kids to school.<br/>
