<h4>Nora or Devereaux Cannon</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553093805">We hit the parent death concern smack up with Snow White - or<br/>
Cinderella - or Hansel and Gretel.  I really don&#39;t remember the<br/>
trigger, but I do remember the concern.  What we did was point<br/>
out that it was a literary device to allow something very<br/>
unlikely (like happens in a fairy tale) to happen.  Not that<br/>
parents don&#39;t occasionally die or fairies necessarily never do<br/>
your chores, but that it was a writer&#39;s trick, like starting<br/>
&quot;once upon a time&quot;.  Ours really likes versions of the same story<br/>
with differences and enjoys picking out the similarities and<br/>
differences, which is probably related to why this worked for<br/>
her.<br/>
