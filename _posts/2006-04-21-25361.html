<div id="ygrps-yiv-45169590">I feel like my soul has gone to detox.Hope,what a beautiful word to <br/>
me,hidden under mountains of stuff bought to keep up with the <br/>
Jone&#39;s,hidden under mountains of numbness,brought on by years of <br/>
making the wrong decisions.Funny though how being hurt can project you <br/>
so far out into space that finding your way back is not only <br/>
daunting,but downright doubtful.I found my way back though,one right <br/>
choice at a time.Unschooling ,a step in the right direction.Why do I <br/>
feel that I am learning more about myself than I thought possible.Is <br/>
watching my children discover life,showing me what I lost all those <br/>
years ago?Did I lose that wonder?I know what getting old is.Its not <br/>
wrinkles or grey hair,or needing glasses,its being lost in <br/>
space.Losing the wonder.Whats the chance that by letting my children <br/>
follow there hearts and minds that I might find my own?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388929089">Might I suggest the book &quot;Women Who Run With The Wolves&quot; by Clarrissa <br/>
Pinkola Estes, Ph,D..  It talks about using fairy tales as guides to <br/>
our lives, about becoming lost from ourselves and finding our way home.<br/>
