<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Pagan is a blanket term, for many different 
religions, or spiritual paths.&nbsp; Pagan basicly means Earth Loving, and one 
who celebrates the seasons &amp; natural cycles of life. Although they are not 
Christian, many come from CHristian backgrounds, and have found a path other 
than that, that rings more true to them.&nbsp; There are many sites on the 
internet, but you will find soo many different takes on Pagan, there are so many 
Earth Centered ways of practicing your religion, so I would start just by asking 
your friend what it is he personally believes.&nbsp; How he/she likes to 
celebrate his belief, what is important to him or her, and what they like to 
do...because often&nbsp; Pagan is not only a religious path, but a way of life, 
something the entire life is integrated&nbsp;with , making their truly no 
mundane....but All Sacred.&nbsp; Michelle*</font></div></html></div>
