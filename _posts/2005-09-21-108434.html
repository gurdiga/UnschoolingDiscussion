<div id="ygrps-yiv-697021496">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever made their own excavation rock?  Plaster of Paris is too hard.<br/>
My 9 yod is planning a B day party. She wants to do a scavenger hunt and she also wants everyone to be able to dig for treasure.<br/>
The ones that you buy are way too expensive, and plastic dinosaurs are not the treasure she wants to hide : )<br/>
Any ideas would be appreciated.<br/>

FYI it is a camp out theme overall<br/>

We did this with moderate success using reptile sand and watery glue.  <br/>
Reptile sand is fine grain sand used in reptile tanks but you could<br/>
probably use any fine sand and get a better price.  We mixed the watered<br/>
down glue and sand in an old casserole dish, shoved the dino down inside<br/>
and patted the sand over the top.  It took several days to dry hard.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe clumping cat letter would work, but I think that would be more<br/>
expensive than a bag of sand from the home improvement store.    <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d like to buy a different vowel.  I think a clumping cat letter would<br/>
be the wad of paper a cat barfs up after sorting your mail.   I don&#39;t<br/>
recommend cat barf as an ingredient in dino excavation sand. <br/>

<br/>
I had a friend make some with Plaster of Paris and vermiculite.  It was <br/>
harder to break than the packaged dino boxes.  You&#39;d have to play with <br/>
ratios; I&#39;m guessing she had 50:50, and I thought that if I ever made any I <br/>
would increased the vermiculite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002638022">We made treasure stones once.   We got the recipe off Kids Concoctions on<br/>
PBS.  Although ours did look kind of like rocks, they sure didn&#39;t feel like<br/>
them because they weren&#39;t as hard but it was fun.  Here it is.  <br/>
<br/>
1 cup flour,1 cup used coffee grinds,1/2 cup salt,1/4 cup sand,3/4 cup<br/>
water. Mix all dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Slowly add water<br/>
and knead until the mixture is the consistency of bread dough. Break off a<br/>
piece of dough and roll it into the size of a baseball. Make a hole in the<br/>
center of the ball big enough to hide treasures in. Fill the hole with<br/>
treasures and seal with some extra dough. Let your Treasure Stone air-dry<br/>
for 2-3 days or until hard, or bake in the oven on a cookie sheet at 150<br/>
degrees for 15-20 minutes. You can also add 1 Tbs of powdered tempera paint<br/>
to tint your Treasure Stones different colors.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-497096691">And I meant to mention that you couldn&#39;t chisel them open because they do<br/>
feel like cooked play dough.  But if you only are concerned with finding the<br/>
rocks and getting the treasures out, that recipe would work fine.  (and it&#39;s<br/>
cheap)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673764581">What about regular yard dirt with the addition of some elmer&#39;s glue mixed <br/>
with the water?   <br/>
<br/>
Those permanent sand castles they used to make were done that way, I think <br/>
(and you wouldn&#39;t want to use THAT much glue).    Maybe don&#39;t put the glue-dirt <br/>
right on the dinosaur either, or it might stick to it too much.    Maybe just <br/>
mud-ball the dino and then use more of the same dirt but with glue and water?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dinosaurs are not found in hard-hard rocks anyway, but in sandstone that can <br/>
be scratched off with any old tool, usually.   Sometimes it&#39;s not even <br/>
sandSTONE yet, just still a layer of compacted sand (not loose, but not rock) between <br/>
layers of harder stuff, like under a layer of volcanic ash or rock.<br/>
<br/>
The bones they&#39;re &quot;excavating&quot; in labs   at the museums or universities, <br/>
they&#39;re taking off plaster of paris that THEY put on so the bones could be moved.<br/>
