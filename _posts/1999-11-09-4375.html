<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871708241">This topic again brings at least two books to mind which I think we&#39;d all be much<br/>
better if everybody read .....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Real Boys&quot; by William Pollack<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I Don&#39;t Want to Talk About It&quot;  by Terrence Real.<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody read these?  The first is about the stifling &quot;code&quot; which boys are<br/>
raised under in this culture.  This code in many ways is a code of silence.  The<br/>
learned inability to express feelings (except mad) openly.  The derision that<br/>
awaits any boy who expresses all of his feelings.<br/>
<br/>
The second is a parsing apart of &quot;covert male depression&quot; which is amazingly<br/>
widespread.  There are all these families with depressed men wherein the men do not<br/>
experience their depression directly but inflict it on their families in a blind<br/>
fashion which corrodes relationships.  The assignment would appear, for men, to be<br/>
experiencing pain in order to be freed from it. The unexpressed grief, among other<br/>
feelings, of men is like an affliction on the world.  Men often act out in some<br/>
form of violence that which they will not experience directly.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to get some feed back from people on these books.  I found them very<br/>
important.<br/>

&gt; Both my boys love their babies.  They play with them differently than my<br/>
&gt; daughter does, but they do enjoy them.<br/>
&gt; I never encouraged them to play with or hid dolls from them.  They both want<br/>
&gt; carriers and beds for their babies.  Hubby slightly disapproves, but not enough<br/>
&gt; to say anything.  I think his feelings are just throw backs to the way he was<br/>
&gt; raised.  He&#39;s learning  :)<br/>
&gt; My four yr old in particular is very nurturing.  I love seeing him like this.<br/>
&gt; He is also the one that is *ell on wheels too!  Interesting.<br/>
&gt; And, after all, they will most likely grow up to be Daddies some day!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I need help finding something for my son.  He is turning 5 in a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;weeks, and wants a backpack carrier for his baby.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Natural Baby used to carry one, but don&#39;t anymore.  Does anyone know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;where I might find one?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Ann<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know that there is a doll sold in major toy stores which comes with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; back pack carrier, but I don&#39;t know about buying one seperately.  Let me<br/>
&gt; &gt; say though, that it is nice to hear someone else who has a son who is<br/>
&gt; &gt; attached to his doll(s.)  I get those same sideways looks and amused smiles<br/>
&gt; &gt; from my ex-playgroup aobut my son&#39;s dolls as I do about him kissing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other children (boys too!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; An uncomfortable sort of, &quot;Oh!  You&#39;re teaching him to be sensative!  Well<br/>
&gt; &gt; I suppose it&#39;s allright at this age, but he&#39;ll be too old for that sort of<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing soon.  And you don&#39;t want to encourage that sort of un-masculine<br/>
&gt; &gt; behavior too long....&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It really sickens me, and was the last straw for me with that previous<br/>
&gt; &gt; group.  I mean, why should boys be treated differently simply by virtue of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the fact that they are boys?  I believe in treating each child as an<br/>
&gt; &gt; individual and parenting them each to their unique personalities and<br/>
&gt; &gt; interests, not directing their play and guiding their interests.  Luckily I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a very wonderful husband who does not feel that his or his sons&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; masculinity are threatented in any way by being sensative, showing emotion,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or doubt, being caring and affectionate, etc.  Our boys play rough and<br/>
&gt; &gt; tumble sometimes, but they are just as likely to want a cuddle, to nurture<br/>
&gt; &gt; or parent their dolls or stuffed animals, or play cooking as they are to<br/>
&gt; &gt; play sports or build with blocks.  I hope to raise them to be well rounded<br/>
&gt; &gt; and whole men, not particularly macho men.<br/>

You recommended them to me before. I just borrowed them from the library but <br/>
have not had time yet. I am interested in what you say about depressed men. <br/>
Does the book offer suggestions? The men I know would never admit to it if <br/>
they were or go for any help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208848648">I, too, have Real Boys on my reading list.  I&#39;ve heard the author speak and<br/>
thought his principles and ideas were wonderful.  However,  parenting only<br/>
daughters puts me in a bit of an akward position.  I probably err on the<br/>
side of &#39;no comment&#39; when it comes to rearing boys because many parents<br/>
think if have no idea what it&#39;s like to have a son.  (I disagree,  though I<br/>
don&#39;t have a son,  I did grow up with three brothers and frequently interact<br/>
with other people&#39;s sons.)<br/>
    Then of course,  I feel strongly about how all children are brought<br/>
up....knowing they&#39;ll be the &#39;movers and shakers&#39;  on this planet someday.<br/>
And on a more personal level....I hope there are healthy,  responsible,<br/>
loving young men out there when my daughters are older!<br/>
