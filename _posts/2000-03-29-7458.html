<div id="ygrps-yiv-691257836">Hey!  I would love to hear from YOU!  How was your experience as an hs-er? <br/>
 Are you a well-balanced and happy person?  {Smile}  Can you support yourself <br/>
and live a &quot;normal&quot; life?  I&#39;m basically asking because I have these fears <br/>
sometimes in the middle of the night that I might be doing a horrible <br/>
disservice to my daughter as I know she doesn&#39;t know all of the science, <br/>
history, math, etc. as other kids her age.  In my waking moments, I know that <br/>
she is becoming the most incredible human being and has so many special gifts <br/>
to share with the world and I believe this world needs more people like her. <br/>
I would love it if you could share some of your thoughts.  Thanks,  Jackie</div>
