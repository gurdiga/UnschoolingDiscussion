<div id="ygrps-yiv-857022775">Jackie auditioned for a play last night.  It was her third audition with the same theater and she felt really good about it.  We just found out that she didn&#39;t get a part.  She is SO disappointed.  She didn&#39;t get a part the last two times either, but didn&#39;t mind so much then.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of what to say or do to comfort her.  We usually help at the concessions during the plays.  She says she doesn&#39;t want to work for concessions or even see this play.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

they are looking for in actors. Be super nice and let them know  <br/>
you&#39;re not complaining, that you just want to know how to do better  <br/>
next time. Does the theater also give classes? That might be a good  <br/>
way for your daughter to gain skills and let the theater folk get to  <br/>
know her better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109499708">Sometimes, it has nothing to do with the quality of acting, but rather how<br/>
the director views the characters.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter and I did Ramona Quimby at a local theater - and the lead role<br/>
for Ramona was not at all what I pictured Ramona to be like when I read the<br/>
books. However, the girl was really good and it worked out great....but<br/>
often it is just perception on the part of the director - or whoever is<br/>
doing the casting. I do think the suggestion of calling the director is good<br/>
as well - but I would venture to guess that it is not that your daughter did<br/>
a poor audition - but just that there was someone else who the director<br/>
thought fit the role....<br/>
<br/>
When we did audition for Ramona - my daughter was not offered a major part<br/>
but was in the children&#39;s ensemble. I thought she would be really<br/>
disappointed but overall was just happy being part of the play. I imagine<br/>
that if she tried three times and didn&#39;t get a major part she would be<br/>
disappointed - just like your daughter. When I was in high school this<br/>
happened to me because I had a major role, and then the next play didn&#39;t get<br/>
one. I just assumed it was me - and I never auditioned again - until Ramona.<br/>
I think the perspective I have of the whole process as an adult is not the<br/>
same as I had when I was a teen. I totally internalized at that time, but<br/>
now I can see that it wasn&#39;t me per se - but that I didn&#39;t fit the roles.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your daughter will try again - or try with another theater!! And tell<br/>
her to make sure she doesn&#39;t wait 20 years like I did! I missed a lot of<br/>
fun!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t make her work concessions, if she thinks that would make  <br/>
her feel better.  Find another cool thing to do with that time and  <br/>
energy if she wants to do that.   But it might help for you to look  <br/>
up some actors&#39; biographies to find stories of how many times  <br/>
professionals had been turned down in the past, or when they were new  <br/>
(or even now).<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good idea.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I will talk to the director too, to find out if Jackie needs to work on something or if it was just a case of someone else being better suited for the role.  We did discuss that about 4 times the number of people needed tried out.  LOTS of people did not get a part.<br/>
<br/>
We are going tonight to work concessions for the current play.  She wants to go.  She said that maybe she will work at the one she didn&#39;t get a part in too.<br/>
<br/>
When her dad found out on Wednesday that she didn&#39;t get the part, he took a little time off work and took her out for lunch.  She came home from that quite a bit cheered up.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also been able to think of some things that will work out better because she didn&#39;t get a part.  Lisa has a dance competition in Idaho the second weekend of the play.  Now Jackie will be able to come with us to that.<br/>
