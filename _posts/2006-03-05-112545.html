<h4>Kimberly</h4>
<time> 5 Mar 2006, at 12:22am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-132008479">I am new to the group. I&#39;m Kimberly, married to Darren<br/>
and have 2 girls- Chloe (5 1/2) and Kylie (2 1/2). <br/>
<br/>
A bit of background- Chloe was born at 22.5 weeks<br/>
gestation and was 1.5 lbs at birth. The only issue<br/>
with her early birth is that she has extremely mild<br/>
cerebral palsy on her left side which for her means<br/>
her calf and hamstring muscles on that side are<br/>
tighter/looser than they should be. She does also have<br/>
a problem with constipation so she takes Milk of<br/>
Magnesia every night which works great. It isn&#39;t habit<br/>
forming to her body like MiraLax is. Thank goodness<br/>
she wasn&#39;t on it long enough for that to happen. Chloe<br/>
is who I am basically asking about for now. I think! <br/>
<br/>
I let my girls get up when they wake up. I was using<br/>
an alarm and having them get up at 8am. Sometimes they<br/>
would get up early and sometimes later. Now they seem<br/>
to get up anywhere between 7:30am and 9am on their<br/>
own. Chloe doesn&#39;t take a nap but Kylie does for<br/>
however long she sleeps. I have just within the last 3<br/>
weeks let her get up on her own (open her door and get<br/>
up). <br/>
<br/>
I have read a ton - and I mean a ton of emails<br/>
regarding unschooling on this group but can&#39;t come<br/>
across anything to answer my questions so I&#39;m hoping<br/>
for some help as I am trying to deschool my brain. <br/>
<br/>
Chloe would watch tv a good part of the day if I let<br/>
her - and I have tried it just recently- and play Xbox<br/>
and Gameboy and play computer games and not help me<br/>
around the house at all if I didn&#39;t ask. She is<br/>
genuinely a very loving and caring child. How do you<br/>
handle cleaning around the house? I have absolutely no<br/>
problem letting her and her sister leave their room a<br/>
mess since it is their room. Growing up my mother told<br/>
me that it wasn&#39;t &quot;my (meaning me Kimberly) room as it<br/>
was hers because she is the one who paid the rent,<br/>
food, etc. Make a long story short she was a horrible<br/>
mother who I no longer speak with. So I don&#39;t want my<br/>
kids feeling the same way. It is their room regardless<br/>
of who pays the rent here. What I am concerned with is<br/>
that my 2 1/2 year old gets into her sisters things<br/>
and leaves them all over when Chloe has picked up her<br/>
room (at my asking) and she gets frustrated over this.<br/>
Do I put them in separate rooms? Kylie wanted to go in<br/>
Chloes room and would have her way in it and I&#39;d end<br/>
up picking it up which I got tired of. I was also<br/>
tired of closing Chloes door so Kylie wouldn&#39;t go in. <br/>
<br/>
Also- how do you handle snacks when they haven&#39;t eaten<br/>
very good at lunch, dinner, etc? Chloe will say she is<br/>
full but then want an immediate snack. What is<br/>
considered a snack? Cookies, candy, fruit, yogurt? How<br/>
many snacks a day? Whenever they want? <br/>
<br/>
One more thing- we have 3 bedrooms upstairs - one for<br/>
me and my hubby, one for the girls (there is a<br/>
two-shelf bookcase in there loaded with books, a tub<br/>
for Barbies, Barbie clothes, cars, etc, a baby doll<br/>
bed, a baby doll stroller, a goldfish on top of their<br/>
dresser) and one I am trying to get away from calling<br/>
the &quot;schoolroom&quot;. In the &quot;schoolroom&quot; I have a total<br/>
of 8 stackable storage shelves along one whole wall<br/>
that were meant to store shoes on in a closet but I<br/>
have toys on them in plastic tubs. Toys such as gears,<br/>
playdoh, playdoh pieces, jigsaw puzzles, pegboard,<br/>
lacing cards, duplos, mega blocks, etc. I have a play<br/>
kitchen and tons of play food with Dora talking house<br/>
along another wall, non-fiction books on different<br/>
things such as bugs, cultures, occupations, animals,<br/>
etc on a stackable shelf with workbooks underneath,<br/>
craft things on another wall. It feels too schoolish I<br/>
think for Chloe. She doesn&#39;t go in there too much.<br/>
What can I do differently? I don&#39;t want big bookcases<br/>
all over - or do I? <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to read to this point!<br/>
Any help would be very much appreciated! I know every<br/>
family is sooo different but sometimes it is just one<br/>
thing someone says that helps so much! <br/>
<br/>

mother and wife to Darren, Chloe and Kylie<br/>

house at all.  Her only job is playing and learning and growing.  All<br/>
her energy should go into those.  Your job as an unschooling parent is<br/>
to free her from those expectations so she can do her job.<br/>
<br/>
How long did you try &quot;just letting her watch tv&quot;?    <br/>
<br/>
Is she watching tv because it is what she enjoys, or because you<br/>
aren&#39;t engaged and the other options seem less appealing?  Are you<br/>
watching tv with her, engaging her about the shows she chooses?  Are<br/>
you playing the video games and computer games with her?  <br/>
<br/>
How are you engaging the girls throughout the day?  Many times parents<br/>
complain about their children watching too much tv or playing video<br/>
games all the time, but the parent hasn&#39;t gotten down with them and<br/>
tried to see what is appealing to them about what they are doing,<br/>
participating in them with the kids, nor really offered any alternatives. <br/>

said no, it couldn&#39;t be, Schuyler is taking a nap, which she knew with<br/>
certainty because the door was closed.  But I had gotten up and opened<br/>
and closed the bedroom door and opened and closed the front door and<br/>
wandered off, crossing a few minor suburban roads as I went.  I was<br/>
never closed into a room for a nap again.<br/>

weren&#39;t going to take away the television?  Did you sigh and make<br/>
those little comments that let her know you didn&#39;t really believe that<br/>
this was something you could trust her to choose?  Did you then start<br/>
to limit her again thereby underscoring her belief that television is<br/>
a restricted good that she must hoard and treasure and watch as much<br/>
as possible whenever she is given the opportunity?  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has put together a great list of &quot;if I let&quot; quotes here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet</a> and Pam Sorooshian has a wonderful<br/>
piece on the utility of restricted versus unrestricted goods here:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you<br/>
&gt; handle cleaning around the house?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I usually wait until it is a bit fuzzy from the dog fur and maybe I<br/>
stepped on a jack and hurt that soft part of my foot&lt;g&gt;--although<br/>
recently because we are selling the house and have put a bunch of<br/>
stuff in storage the house is much cleaner. A clean house isn&#39;t among<br/>
my top priorities.  If we have guests coming there is usually a fury<br/>
of cleaning, but that is my need and not Simon and Linnaea&#39;s need. <br/>
And when it is their need they clean.  The other day Linnaea helped<br/>
clean the house because she wanted to help us get as much money as<br/>
possible when we sell the house so that we can maximize the size of<br/>
our next house&#39;s backyard.  Dawn (in NS) wrote a wonderful post at<br/>
unschooling.info about creating clean spaces for her children to make<br/>
a new mess in:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can understand Chloe&#39;s frustration.  She did a job that she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to do and then along comes her pain in the butt younger sibling<br/>
and messes it up.  I&#39;m sure my brother felt that toward me more times<br/>
than I can remember.  I loved going into his room, it was full of so<br/>
many exciting things that might just lead to me having a closer<br/>
relationship with him.  He used to leave tapes in his big tape<br/>
recorder with a sign on the recorder saying HANDS OFF!! so of course<br/>
the first thing I would mess with when I&#39;d snuck in his room.  And<br/>
there he would be speaking with a vampire accent telling me how I was<br/>
going to be consumed by evil demons for entering into the sacred<br/>
chamber of Sam.  I loved it, but I don&#39;t really know how he felt about<br/>
it.  And now, when we are all grown, our relationship is a study in<br/>
disinterest, so I am unlikely to ask him.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, my two children, Simon and Linnaea sort of share a room.  I mean<br/>
their official room is one that they share, but Linnaea is more likely<br/>
to sleep in David and my bedroom on a futon on the floor and Simon<br/>
will often sleep downstairs on the couch.  Recently Linnaea has been<br/>
sleeping on the sofa-bed downstairs with Simon on the other couch. <br/>
So, there is no real sense of personal space. If their bedroom gets<br/>
trashed, as it often does when friends come over, it is my gift to<br/>
them that I clean it.  I love cleaning their room, I love the process<br/>
of setting out their favorite things so that they can find them at<br/>
some later moment. I love seeing what they have strewn about and<br/>
imagining the path that it took to arrive there.  Yesterday we had to<br/>
show the house on relatively short notice.  Simon is trying to save up<br/>
to buy King Kong for the Gamecube and has been asking for ways to earn<br/>
money.  I offered him 3 pounds to clean his room, he wanted 5, but I<br/>
thought it was only worth 3, so he negotiated for more money if he<br/>
cleaned a different room as well.  In the end he only got 3 pounds<br/>
because while he was motivated enough to clean the one room he just<br/>
wasn&#39;t keen enough to keep going.  He did a pretty good job for an 8<br/>
almost 9 year old who has never cleaned his room before (actually I<br/>
think he has cleaned it before, he and Linnaea both have helped me<br/>
clean before, and they&#39;ve both independently cleaned the living room<br/>
as a gift to David and me).  But if Linnaea (who is 5 almost 6) had<br/>
come into the room when it was clean and played with her toys and<br/>
dressed up and left little piles of busyness all over the room, it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have negated what he had done. It wouldn&#39;t have taken away<br/>
from the 3 pounds that he had earned. It wouldn&#39;t have put stress on<br/>
their relationship.  I would have swept through and tidied it back up<br/>
as best I could in what time I had before the showing. Having that<br/>
peace in their lives allows them to enjoy each other in ways that I<br/>
cannot remember enjoying with my brother.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>In our house everything that is eaten is food: a candy bar is food, a<br/>
cookie is food, a burrito is food, brocolli is food, nori is food. <br/>
And just as I eat whatever and whenever I want so do they.  I put out<br/>
food for them most days.  So I&#39;ll fix a tray of celery and carrots or<br/>
some fruit or olives or a selection of chips (in Britain they tend to<br/>
sell most chips (crisps here) in individual serving packets) and bring<br/>
it to wherever they are (for another description of the kind of thing:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter.html)">http://www.sandradodd.com/eating/monkeyplatter.html)</a> They eat what<br/>
they want and I put away or throw out what they leave.  There are<br/>
usually some sweets in the house as well as lots of savory treats.  If<br/>
they want something specific they ask and if we have the ingredients I<br/>
will fix it and if not than it will either be written into the next<br/>
grocery list or we will go out and get what is lacking in that moment<br/>
(or call David at work to pick it up on his way home).  Maybe Chloe is<br/>
full of whatever she is eating.  Maybe the idea of another bite of<br/>
mashed potatoes is more than she can handle, but a nice dish of ice<br/>
cream with chocolate syrup is what is needed to give her that lovely<br/>
full feeling.<br/>

puzzles or read a book or do crafts?  Is it a space that you visit? <br/>
Or is it a place that was set up so that Chloe could go there by<br/>
herself and learn?  Most of our lives are lived in the family room, in<br/>
the more public spaces of the house.  If Linnaea wants to sculpt with<br/>
playdoh I pull out a big plastic picnic mat and put it out on the<br/>
floor along with her backpack filled with playdoh tools and tubs.  If<br/>
Simon wants to work on his paint by numbers set it comes out on the<br/>
kitchen table (which may need a bit of tidying to make space).  Most<br/>
of the craft things are downstairs, visible, relatively accessible. <br/>
There isn&#39;t any separation of life and art or life and books or life<br/>
and children.  Maybe if you put a really comfy chair in there and<br/>
starting using the space yourself Chloe would be more likely to see it<br/>
as an inviting space.<br/>

Please read some of those.  I won&#39;t add yours because &quot;a good part of  <br/>
the day&quot; isn&#39;t very dramatic, but statements like that are not  <br/>
helpful, and they&#39;re false anyway.<br/>
<br/>
If you starve someone for a week, he will eat all the food he can get  <br/>
for a long time thereafter (once he&#39;s recovered well enough to eat.<br/>
<br/>
If you give someone access to lots of good food and he trusts that  <br/>
that source isn&#39;t about to be taken away, he will only eat what he  <br/>
really wants or needs.<br/>

&gt; Magnesia every night which works great. It isn&#39;t habit<br/>
&gt; forming to her body like MiraLax is. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This cought my eye.<br/>
When my daughter was 2 she spent a year having a hard time with<br/>
constipation. We went from doctor to doctor. It was so frustrating.<br/>
Finally I found some info on the internet and started giving her<br/>
mineral oil at night (careful that she does not cry while swallowing<br/>
it so that it does not end up in her lungs) and metamusil twice a day<br/>
with apple sauce. Within weeks she was fine. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you<br/>
&gt; handle cleaning around the house? I have absolutely no<br/>
&gt; problem letting her and her sister leave their room a<br/>
&gt; mess since it is their room. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really don&#39;t know about this one either. The ideas on unschooling<br/>
web sites about chores appeal to me. But I am often  unable to hold my<br/>
tongue and clean around them as they play without eventually blowing<br/>
up, which seems even worse to me than if I asked them to help in the<br/>
first place. <br/>
When I do keep my mouth shut and switch my focus from cleaning to<br/>
them, often they actually help me out and even take pride in their<br/>
work. Which makes me think that there might be something to that study<br/>
on success that I keep hearing about. If taking pride in ones work,<br/>
feeling a sense of accomplishment, competence, participation through<br/>
being part of the house cleaning team leads to a success in adult life<br/>
(as the study I mention below suggests), may be involving them in<br/>
chores is a beneficial thing after all? I don&#39;t know...<br/>
<br/>
Here is an article about the study:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://education.umn.edu/research/ResearchWorks/Rossmann.html">http://education.umn.edu/research/ResearchWorks/Rossmann.html</a> <br/>
<br/>
Quote:<br/>
&quot;Using measures of individual&#39;s success such as completion of<br/>
education, getting started on a career path, IQ, relationships with<br/>
family and friends, and not using drugs, and examining a child&#39;s<br/>
involvement in household tasks at all three earlier time, Rossmann<br/>
determined that the best predictor of young adults&#39; success in their<br/>
mid-20s was that they participated in household tasks when they were<br/>
three or four. However, if they did not begin participating until they<br/>
were 15 or 16, the participation backfired and those subjects were<br/>
less &quot;successful.&quot; The assumption is that responsibility learned via<br/>
household tasks is best when learned young.<br/>
<br/>
How the tasks are presented also influences children&#39;s abilities to<br/>
become well-adjusted adults. The tasks should not be too overwhelming,<br/>
parents should present the tasks in a way that fits the child&#39;s<br/>
preferred learning style, and children should be involved in<br/>
determining the tasks they will complete, through family meeting and<br/>
methods such a weekly chore chart. They should not be made to do the<br/>
tasks for an allowance. The earlier parents begin getting children to<br/>
take an active role in the household, the easier it will be to get<br/>
them involved as teens.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I am concerned with is<br/>
&gt; that my 2 1/2 year old gets into her sisters things<br/>
&gt; and leaves them all over when Chloe has picked up her<br/>
&gt; room (at my asking) and she gets frustrated over this.<br/>
&gt; Do I put them in separate rooms? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My girls are 5 years apart. They shared a room until the younger one<br/>
was 2 1/2. The spare bedroom was the older girl&#39;s playroom where she<br/>
has her art table and all her supplies. We put a plastic cover on the<br/>
doorknob to prevent the younger one from going in there alone. When it<br/>
started to be a problem for her, we made a big deal of setting up<br/>
their bedroom as her own special room with her own toys, bed, and<br/>
things. The older one moved into her playroom. We took the plastic<br/>
cover off the doorknob and try to help them both to respect each<br/>
other&#39;s space, room, things. They do pretty well with that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also- how do you handle snacks when they haven&#39;t eaten<br/>
&gt; very good at lunch, dinner, etc? Chloe will say she is<br/>
&gt; full but then want an immediate snack. What is<br/>
&gt; considered a snack? Cookies, candy, fruit, yogurt? How<br/>
&gt; many snacks a day? Whenever they want? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I struggle with food, too. We (parents) choose not to buy stuff with<br/>
sugar and I worry that the kids will see it as limits that are too<br/>
controlling. On the other hand, I literally suffer (and as a result of<br/>
my pain, my family suffers from my neglect) when I eat sugar and if it<br/>
is around me or anywhere in the house, it&#39;s truly too hard for me not<br/>
to eat it. It&#39;s pretty much as if someone was trying to stop smoking<br/>
and others smoked in front of him/her or smoked in the house (or with<br/>
trying to stop drinking alcohol). My younger girl loves to eat even<br/>
when she is not hungry and would eat all the time - same as you<br/>
describe with Chloe. I have noticed that often she is just asking for<br/>
attention, not food. An offer of play, reading book etc. easily puts<br/>
her attention on something else than food. Not that I criticise her<br/>
wish to eat, if she asks again, she gets what she wants (cold cuts,<br/>
frozen blueberries, fruit, left-overs, cheese -whatever).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Usually when someone&#39;s talking about chores, they&#39;re not talking  <br/>
about &quot;involving children,&quot; but rather commanding and requiring and  <br/>
shaming and punishing.   Children rarely escape chores rules without  <br/>
being belittled and left alone to do something distasteful, all the  <br/>
while building up a big charge of resentment and maybe hatred,  <br/>
depending how large the chore load is and what the penalty is for not  <br/>
&quot;finishing chores.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the first and biggest things a parent can do when thinking  <br/>
about this is to really look at the word &quot;chore.&quot;  It doesn&#39;t sound  <br/>
fun.  It doesn&#39;t sound like something one would choose to do.  It  <br/>
will help (not might, but full-on WILL help) to talk about the things  <br/>
themselves as what they are—cleaning the kitchen, feeding the dog,  <br/>
pulling the weeds—rather than defining them as a class of evils and  <br/>
THEN deciding whether or not to &quot;require&quot; children to &quot;do them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And of that study, I would bet big bucks that the researchers have  <br/>
never met a teen who grew up without chores, whose parents gave him  <br/>
lots of choices and opportunities, and who didn&#39;t go to school.  So  <br/>
honestly, that research doesn&#39;t apply to us.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The earlier parents begin getting children to<br/>
take an active role in the household, the easier it will be to get<br/>
them involved as teens.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to &quot;get them&quot; to take an active role if they have,  <br/>
since birth, been treated respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The assumption is that responsibility learned via<br/>
household tasks is best when learned young.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The assumption is that responsibility (defined, it seems from that  <br/>
excerpt as &quot;success in their<br/>
mid-20s&quot; was learned from household tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who gets a chance to meet my kids at a conference or here  <br/>
should talk to them, spy on them, see whether they seem responsible.   <br/>
They don&#39;t have to have jobs, they don&#39;t need to have jobs, but they  <br/>
do.  They&#39;re SUPER responsible kids.<br/>

She&#39;s right.  They are super responsible...and kind, and all those good<br/>

I also know myself.  I did not do chores.  My mom is and was a<br/>
perfectionist, and liked things just so...so she did them herself.  My<br/>
grandma mostly raised me, and DOTED on me.  No chores.  I could help if I<br/>
wanted, and I mostly did, but not always.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m good now.  I clean my house, am very organized, and even though we move<br/>
often, the unpacking gets done and there is not chaos in my house or my<br/>
head.<br/>
<br/>
Studies are studies.  Real life is different, and kids do best when they can<br/>
BE kids.  If you knew there would be famine next year, would you start<br/>
starving your kids now, just so they&#39;d &quot;be prepared&quot;?  Maybe not.<br/>

language and the word chores doesn&#39;t even translate into my language.<br/>
We just use the things themselves as you mention them. I actually have<br/>
never felt comfortable with all those recommended chore charts etc. It<br/>
does make it all seem like a pile of unpleasant things to do, while<br/>
for example organizing and cleaning the sinks is something that my<br/>
older daughter enjoys doing (according to her). Yesterday I wrote a<br/>
list of all the things that needed to be done over the weekend (park<br/>
outing desired by my daughter included). some of the stuff were<br/>
cleaning tasks, some were things that were due (sending Thank You<br/>
cards etc.), some were things we all would enjoy. I posted it on the<br/>
wall and everyone participated by choice. It worked out just fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367424438"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; One more thing- we have 3 bedrooms upstairs - one for<br/>
&gt; me and my hubby, one for the girls (there is a<br/>
&gt; two-shelf bookcase in there loaded with books, a tub<br/>
&gt; for Barbies, Barbie clothes, cars, etc, a baby doll<br/>
&gt; bed, a baby doll stroller, a goldfish on top of their<br/>
&gt; dresser) and one I am trying to get away from calling<br/>
&gt; the &quot;schoolroom&quot;. In the &quot;schoolroom&quot; I have a total<br/>
&gt; of 8 stackable storage shelves along one whole wall<br/>
&gt; that were meant to store shoes on in a closet but I<br/>
&gt; have toys on them in plastic tubs. Toys such as gears,<br/>
&gt; playdoh, playdoh pieces, jigsaw puzzles, pegboard,<br/>
&gt; lacing cards, duplos, mega blocks, etc. I have a play<br/>
&gt; kitchen and tons of play food with Dora talking house<br/>
&gt; along another wall, non-fiction books on different<br/>
&gt; things such as bugs, cultures, occupations, animals,<br/>
&gt; etc on a stackable shelf with workbooks underneath,<br/>
&gt; craft things on another wall. It feels too schoolish I<br/>
&gt; think for Chloe. She doesn&#39;t go in there too much.<br/>
&gt; What can I do differently? I don&#39;t want big bookcases<br/>
&gt; all over - or do I? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I had that much space I would dedicate one room just for sleeping <br/>
dressers and bedroom stuff and perhaps stuffed animals and books.  <br/>
Then the other room I would set up as the play space and make it fun <br/>
and functional and comfy, and most importantly easy for me to clean <br/>
up fast.  I mean, bins and throw it in type clean up so that it is <br/>
easy for anyone.  This way it is everyone&#39;s space, so no one person <br/>
feels like they have responsibility to do all the cleanup.  Everyone <br/>
can help and everyone can use it and mess it up again.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is really small so the whole house is one big toy bin.  <br/>
Messy all the time!  However, sometimes I do need to vaccuum, so I <br/>
ask for help to pick up the floor because I feel they should have a <br/>
say in where things get put away.  Generally they are willing to <br/>
help, sometimes they are not and I do it myself.  It is easier to do <br/>
it myself than try to get someone to help if they are unwilling.<br/>
<br/>
If my youngest goes into my oldest dd&#39;s clean room and messes it up, <br/>
I will generally clean it up better than how it was to begin with.  <br/>
It&#39;s only fair really as they have little control over the set up of <br/>
our living space.  When we lived in a big house it really wasn&#39;t <br/>
that big of a deal for anyone because it was easier to live in the <br/>
space that was messy, yet still have the ability to walk through the <br/>
spaces without stepping on things.  It was also easier to keep toy <br/>
areas seperate from spaces that one could relax in without clutter.  <br/>
Projects could be left out and be untouched for a few days without <br/>
having the need of the space.  It just isn&#39;t so where we live now, <br/>
so we all help a little to keep everyone happy.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now my oldest dd has set up a huge painting project that is <br/>
taking up the entire living room space.  She has set it up in a way <br/>
where spills are addressed and her little sister can paint without <br/>
damaging the carpet.  It&#39;s really cool that she was so nice to do <br/>
that even though she really just wanted to paint something for <br/>
herself.  She knew her sister wouldn&#39;t stay out of her way so she <br/>
made it possible for her to paint as well.  It is win/win for <br/>
everyone.  I like to encourage this type of interaction between my <br/>
kids, so the best thing I can do to help is offer to do all the <br/>
cleanup when they are done.  My oldest will probably clean her own <br/>
stuff and I will probably clean up my youngest and her mess.  This <br/>
way my oldest can finish whenever she wants to and she doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to worry about helping her sister finish up.</div>
