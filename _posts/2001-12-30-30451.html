<br/>
::waving::  We have that book, too, and my oldest LOVED it.  The title is<br/>
&quot;The First Honest Book About Lies&quot; (if, in fact, we&#39;re talking about the<br/>
same book!) and here&#39;s the URL at Amazon.com if others would like to read<br/>
about it:<br/>

<br/>
There are a few others listed as &quot;Customers who bought this book also<br/>
bought:&quot; that looked interesting, too.  (I love that feature of Amazon!)<br/>
It&#39;s really a *wonderful* book for both adults and young adults...opens up<br/>
avenues for lots of interesting conversations.  I got mine from Holt&#39;s<br/>
bookstore several years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here--first post.  I knew about the list, but had sort of weaned<br/>
myself off lists and wasn&#39;t looking to join any others.  But an unschooling<br/>
adventure led me here by way of Sarah Carothers, so here I am.<br/>
<br/>
I met Sarah on a dogs email list.  :-)  I had just bought a puppy and joined<br/>
this particular list to learn more about the breed (hence my unschooling<br/>
adventure).  Sarah and I both have the same breed of dog, Havanese, (and we<br/>
both bought the dogs quite recently), they&#39;re almost exactly the same age<br/>
and when we exchanged photos last night we found out they look just alike!<br/>
We started corresponding when I mentioned that I homeschool.  Turns out we<br/>
have a lot in common besides our new puppies.<br/>
<br/>
Looking through the list of listmembers, I recognize several names.  I&#39;ve<br/>
been mostly &quot;off&quot; email for about the last year-and-a-half or so, but<br/>
recognize names here from when I was active in other HEM (and, before that,<br/>
AHA) lists.  My email address was different then (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:moyerles@...">moyerles@...</a>).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Oklahoma (just north of Tulsa), have 3 children (Matthew, 15, Sarah,<br/>
13 today, and Elizabeth, who will be 9 soon) and now a new furbaby, Sparky.<br/>
My kids have never been to school and we&#39;ve always unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to it....<br/>

+ example, as<br/>
+ I&#39;m wasting away in Bartlesville next weekend at the in-laws, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
Karen,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m quite close to Bartlesville--in Skiatook (about 30 minutes south of<br/>
B&#39;ville)--and would love meeting you.  We&#39;ll be around all weekend, I think.<br/>
My phone number is 918-396-0108 (it is long distance from B&#39;ville).  I&#39;m<br/>
trying to make plans with some (mostly) unschooling friends for a small<br/>
party, but not yet sure if we&#39;re going to try to do that New Year&#39;s Eve or<br/>
next weekend, but if you&#39;re here then you&#39;re welcome to come to that, too.<br/>
It&#39;s just 3 other families...  Either way--give me a call!  Beware,<br/>
though....if you meet Sparky in person it will be enough to push you over<br/>
the edge from &quot;considering&quot; into &quot;doing&quot;.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I did get my Havanese here--there is a small family breeder in Broken Arrow<br/>
(Tulsa suburb).  They are homeschoolers, too, in fact....and a<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling friend of mine bought the sibling of the puppy we<br/>
got.  There must be some sort of attraction there...  They don&#39;t have any<br/>
more pups from this litter, but I think they have two females, so may have<br/>
pups again soon-ish.  I know there&#39;s a breeder in Ardmore, too, who says she<br/>
will have pups mid-summer, but those are the only ones I know about in<br/>
Oklahoma so far.  Where do you live, Karen?  I&#39;m *considering* breeding,<br/>
too, but it will be at least 2 years before we had pups....probably more<br/>
like 3 years.<br/>
<br/>
I notice that Sarah said she was going to attach a photo but there was no<br/>
attachment.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because the list doesn&#39;t accept them or<br/>
if she forgot or had a problem, but I&#39;ll try attaching a (small) photo of<br/>
Sparky, too.<br/>
<br/>
I really will try participating in some of the more intellectual<br/>
conversation soon.  :-)  My daughter&#39;s birthday is today and she has 5 girls<br/>
over for a party right now, so I&#39;m a little distracted.  Enjoying the<br/>
conversation here, though....<br/>
