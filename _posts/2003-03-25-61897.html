<div id="ygrps-yiv-926829237">Thanks for the computer suggestions..we defrag every week, ran it <br/>
anyway; that didn&#39;t help neither did changing my settings or anything <br/>
else we could think of. SO I&#39;m going to unsub and see if the problem <br/>
continues. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll think of what has been said and I appreciate everyone&#39;s honesty <br/>
if not quite their bluntness. <br/>
<br/>
With any luck I&#39;ll be back...if I&#39;d be welcome, that is. In case <br/>
anyone wants to reply, I&#39;ll not be unsubbing just yet but within the <br/>
next couple days.<br/>

You could just go no mail.   You&#39;re still a member of the group that way<br/>
but you read at the yahoo groups web site instead of having mail<br/>
delivered.   Or did I miss that you&#39;re not on-line.  I&#39;m so slow.<br/>
  <br/>
***I&#39;ll think of what has been said and I appreciate everyone&#39;s honesty <br/>
if not quite their bluntness.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you don&#39;t like blunt.   It seems the best we can do for each<br/>
other is to say it, get it out there and let it be digested.   I hate to<br/>
see people waste one precious minute getting to a better place with their<br/>
kids.   We don&#39;t have them nearly long enough as it is.  It seems a damn<br/>
shame to waste any time at all.  <br/>
<br/>
If you had a big leach stuck to you wouldn&#39;t it be better if someone told<br/>
you right out?   Would you want person after person to see the leach and<br/>
not say anything to you?  <br/>
Well here, school and anything like it is that leach stuck on you,<br/>
sucking the blood out of the life you could be having with your child.   <br/>
We have the salt shaker.   And maybe even a recipe for leach flambè.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find a way to stay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98603809">No mail...oh...DUH! Geez what a day I&#39;m having<br/>
today...that sounds like a better option than<br/>
completely unsubbing as I have enjoyed this group.<br/>

I was working on a booger analogy first but it went awry, as my analogies<br/>
so often do.<br/>

<br/>
I think you can spell it either way!  <br/>
 The only reason I thought it looked different was because we have a Leech Lake near me and Leech Lake Indian Reservation so I see that a lot around here.<br/>
 <br/>
It was very &#39;on&#39; for me,  the analogy that is.   <br/>
 <br/>
The leechy schoolish ideas were sucking the unschooling force from me.          &quot;Kelli, feel the force&quot;   said the unschooling jedi master.<br/>

I get that one too,   like the pesky booger on the hobbit&#39;s finger in Lord of the Rings.   We love that scene,  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
it might only be in the extended version though. <br/>
