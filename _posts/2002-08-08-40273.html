 </span></blockquote>The first king of Israel was Saul. He worked to unite the twelve tribes<br/>
of Israel (from the twelve sons of Jacob who was called Israel) which<br/>
were scattered about the land.  Saul became jealous of David after the<br/>
public acclaim from killing Goliath and tried to kill him twice. David<br/>
and fled to the south which was the land of the tribe of Judah. THe<br/>
northern tribe of Israel and the southern tribe of Judah were separated<br/>
by pagan cities whom they warred with.The other  Hebrew tribes were<br/>
scattered about them. The Philistines killed Saul and David who had been<br/>
getting stronger armies was anointed king of Judah and defeated the<br/>
Philistimnes again and united the tribes. TRibe of Israel never liked<br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
David moved the capital for the first time to Jerusalem (after battling<br/>
its pagan inhabitants). He had the strong backing of the tribe of Judah<br/>
(from whence comes the name of the religion: Judaism) but united and<br/>
ruled all the Israelites  in their lands as king. and conquered<br/>
neighboring land too expanded his kingdom. His son Solomon expanded it<br/>
even further as an Empire, ruling neighoring lands. After Solomon&#39;s<br/>
death, Israel and Judea split apart again and the rest of the tribes<br/>
took sides with them. They were rivaling kingdoms until Israel fell to<br/>
the Assyrians. About 45 years later, Judah was taken by the Assyrians as<br/>
well. This whole period was that of the prophets.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s more or less what is recorded. I might have missed something. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re talking about a culture, not a kingdom with a wall around it, or even <br/>
a defended border.  Nomadic tribes can coexist with other nomadic tribes in <br/>
the same area and still be &quot;nations.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve been to musuems I&#39;ve seen displays of Persian and Babylonian and <br/>
Egyptian cultures, but not artifacts of ancient Israel.  Are there lots of <br/>
them?  Where would they have been kept all these years?  And if they&#39;re found <br/>
nowadays by archeologists I guess they&#39;d be stored in Israel.  Not a safe <br/>
storage place lately.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a big material culture, even from their own accounts.  And they <br/>
kept being conquered and scattered, by their own accounts.  <br/>
