<br/>
<br/>
LOL!  This topic comes up a lot in our house!  When I was a controlling type <br/>
of parent, I use to have the rule *no R rated movies unless watched at home <br/>
with a parent present*.  My rationale was that at home my children would be free <br/>
to leave the room if they were disturbed by something, and a parent would be <br/>
close at hand if they wanted to talk about something.  I still think watching <br/>
movies that might be disturbing at home with a parent is a good idea, but we <br/>
don&#39;t have this rule anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really like watching movies at home and am very disturbed personally <br/>
by graphic displays of violence, and I&#39;m probably more sensitive in this area <br/>
than any of my children.  Letting go of the *a parent must be present* rule <br/>
gives my children the chance to see lots more movies.  Also my 15 yo dd looks <br/>
like an adult and no one ever questions her when she goes to see movies at the <br/>
theater.  It probably doesn&#39;t hurt that all of her friends are 17 or older. <br/>
<br/>
One of the best things about dropping the movie rules is that my kids are now <br/>
far more discerning in what they watch.  I think before they thought it was <br/>
cool to watch horror movies and now they just say *I don&#39;t like that*.   Having <br/>
the freedom to watch anything, helps them decide what they really do want to <br/>
watch.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a child who needed me to get into an R movie at the theaters, and I <br/>
really didn&#39;t want to see that movie, I would try to recruit another adult to <br/>
see it with them.  If this wasn&#39;t possible, they&#39;d have to wait &#39;til it came <br/>
out on DVD...which doesn&#39;t take all that long now &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s sixteen?<br/>
Is there an adult friend of yours who would go with her?<br/>
<br/>
I would pay someone else&#39;s ticket who&#39;d be willing to see it with her.<br/>
<br/>
If it were &quot;The Passion of the Christ,&quot; I would try to talk her into waiting <br/>
for DVD.  They WILL have DVDs soon, no doubt, considering the expense of the <br/>
movie production and their intent.  It won&#39;t be as intense at home as it is in <br/>
a movie theatre in the dark where you can&#39;t easily get away from it and you&#39;re <br/>
sharing the expansive energy of a several hundred fervent fans.<br/>

<br/>
It is The Passion of the Christ. I thought for sure, the list would <br/>
figure it out: over the top violent; &quot;a movie&quot; as if there were any <br/>
other movie being talked about everywhere, right now...etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to see it because: 1)the violence 2)I don&#39;t go to other <br/>
things just because everyone else is going 3)my imagination is just <br/>
as vivid as I want it to be; Mel Gibson has a much more graphic <br/>
imagination than I. 4) I&#39;ve read the book LOL<br/>
<br/>
But my girl and I talked about it today, and she&#39;s decided, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to see the movie just because everyone in her youth <br/>
group is going. If she were to go, it would be just to check it out, <br/>
and she didn&#39;t want to attend this particular movie, &quot;just because.&quot; <br/>
If she were desperately craving to go see it, we&#39;d go together. As it <br/>
is, we&#39;re staying away. <br/>

also think that age 16 is old enough, in most cases, to see whatever <br/>

you buy the ticket and let her go.  Does she havea  friend who would go <br/>
with her?  Again, you can buy tickets, and then go to see peter pan <br/>
yourself or something.  :-)  Another adult that could go with her?  Wait <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;a movie&quot; out that my 16 year old is saying she wants to go see,<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know is too violent for me. I don&#39;t want to see it, and she<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; go without a guardian, being under 17.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What To Do?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks<br/>

This site has a very christain leaning, and one shouldn&#39;t read the <br/>
reviews if you don&#39;t want the ending given away (although that&#39;s hardly <br/>
a problem in Passion) but I have found it helpful for me in making <br/>
choices regarding which movies I want to see myself, or which movies I <br/>
want to take young children to see.  I just take all they say with a <br/>
large spoon of salt, and consider this website as only one source of <br/>
information, which I use to make an informed decision.<br/>

worse than Good Fellas... Saving Private Ryan is gorier.<br/>
<br/>
I actually felt like the movie was so stylized that the violence just didn&#39;t hit me nearly as <br/>
hard as say, Cold Mountain (more recent, far more emotionally powerful and painful to <br/>
watch movie).<br/>
<br/>
If the viewer is familiar with the Christ story, then this movie doesn&#39;t hold the shock value <br/>
that other movies have. And it is possible to avert the eyes since everyone knows when the <br/>
nails will be hammered or the whip will be let fly.<br/>
<br/>
The objectionable parts, for me, had less to do with the violence and more to do with the <br/>
caricatures of the Jews and Romans.<br/>
<br/>
Mature teens who are used to viewing R rated movies won&#39;t find this one more difficult to <br/>
watch, though they may find the story more personal. I actually wish I had been more <br/>
moved. <br/>

Ah, there y&#39;go.  I fear Saving Priate Ryan and will probably never see it.   <br/>
I was warned off Pulp Fiction by my husband after he saw it in the theatre, <br/>
and the way I had to watch it finally was years later on DVD, in small bits.<br/>

I&#39;m just all for video or DVD and good old &quot;pause&quot; and &quot;mute&quot; for easing into <br/>

by Tarantino again. Mafia movies always put me over the edge. I did see SPR in the theater, <br/>
though, and made it through.<br/>

 I have a really hard time with violence on the screen, too. I would have waited with the <br/>
Passion, but in my context it became necessary for me to have an informed opinion. :)<br/>

horrific, violent, brutal.   I&#39;m sure the movie will have a different <br/>
effect on individuals based on thier personal beliefs.  It was <br/>
particularly difficult for me because I know the story is true.  It <br/>
was not some made up, blow em up, aliens from space, <br/>
action/fantasy/fiction movie. I think Heidi&#39;s daughter made the right <br/>
decision, much better to see it at home where you can walk away, fast <br/>
forward, come back later.<br/>

I agree.  I haven&#39;t seen the movie, but I know the story &lt;grin&gt;.  I was<br/>
watching Dennis Miller tonight and they were talking about all the<br/>
anti-semitism, etc., etc..<br/>
<br/>
How can something be bigotry if it is a representation of historical fact?<br/>
It is like saying &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; is Anti-German or &quot;The Donner Party&quot; is<br/>
Anti-carnivore.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t like it is some new theory that Mel came up with....The plot has<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shown as the villians.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t been able to see the movie yet, but its my understanding <br/>
that Pilate was portrayed &quot;sympathetically&quot; (as in, not really <br/>
wanting to crucify Jesus), but the Roman soldiers who beat and <br/>
crucified Jesus were portrayed as out of control sadists, and also <br/>
not very smart. Mel Gibson states that he wanted to be true to the <br/>
Gospels, and so i went and reread the crucifiction parts. Pilate IS <br/>
protrayed sympathetically there. Also its ridiculous for anyone to <br/>
say that &quot;the Jews&quot; were the villians, as obviously Jesus, Mary, Mary <br/>
Magdalene, and all of the disciples were Jewish. From everything i&#39;ve <br/>
heard on tv programs, yes, the &quot;Jewish religious leaders&quot; were not <br/>
portrayed very positively, but again, they arent exactly heroes in <br/>
the New Testament either. I think there is some merit to the argument <br/>
that many of the arguments against this movie are arguments against <br/>
the Gospels themselves. (disclaimer: I am no Bible expert!)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As Roger Ebert argued, its such a moot point to argue who was &quot;at <br/>
fault&quot; as, according to Christian doctrine, Jesus&#39; death was <br/>
preordained and *required*. Christians believe that Jesus came to <br/>
earth for the very purpose to die for our sins. He was the <br/>
&quot;sacrificial lamb&quot;, accepted this role, and did not try to flee or to <br/>
defend himself. Mel Gibson has stated that this is the reason it is <br/>
HIS hand that was filmed pounding the first nail into Jesus&#39; palm, <br/>
because he feels HE is as much to &quot;blame&quot; for the death as anyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977694414">I was actually going to take my 7 yo son to see The Passion of the <br/>
Christ, until i read Roger Ebert&#39;s review and he stated &quot;This is the <br/>
most violent movie i have ever seen.&quot; For a movie reviewer, who has <br/>
seen thousands of movies, to say this, means that it is VERY violent. <br/>
I don&#39;t think violent necessarily means &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;without <br/>
value&quot;...but it made me pause and think that i probably won&#39;t be <br/>
taking my son. He said he did want to go, even though its subtitled <br/>
and he isnt the quickest reader yet. I wasnt too worried about the <br/>
violence aspect because he isnt that sensitive and has been exposed <br/>
to alot of different movies. The only movie that i actually felt <br/>
super uncomfortable letting him watch was &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, <br/>
which was actually kinda weird and funny but SUPER gory (probably one <br/>
of the most gory movies ive ever seen), it was just too &quot;in your <br/>
face&quot;, and i asked him if he wanted $5 to go play video games instead <br/>
(in retrospect, not the safest thing to do!), and he jumped at the <br/>
chance. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll definantly offer him the chance to watch &quot;Passion&quot; when we get <br/>
it on DVD, so he can stop it or leave the room if he wants. But i <br/>
can&#39;t really imagine keeping a 16 yo from watching anything. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, i find emotionally &quot;violent&quot; movies or scenes way more <br/>
damaging to my psyche....i will NEVER forget how i felt during the <br/>
seen in Schindler&#39;s List, where all the children were loaded up in <br/>
trucks and were being driven off, waving goodbye to their mothers, <br/>
who ran toward them screaming for their children. That pierced my <br/>
soul, just the idea of it. Or the scene in Sophie&#39;s Choice, in which <br/>
Sophie must choose which child will die, her daughter or her son. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t even bring myself to finish the second half of &quot;Life Is <br/>
Beautiful&quot;...as soon as the Nazis showed up, i turned it off. I just <br/>
didnt want to know....the other day my sister told me how it ended. I <br/>
don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll ever finish that movie. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94855112">Yes. I didn&#39;t have a problem with what was shown in a technical manner of the violence. <br/>
 <br/>
In the opening scene, He steps on a snake. The fight between the apostles and the soldiers is not graphic, although they do clearly show the guy who lost an ear...but Christ heals him. <br/>
 <br/>
At His arrest, he&#39;s hit and spat upon. He&#39;s sent to be tortured, but not killed, by Pilate. A Cat-o&#39;nine-tail is a brutal weapon. The damage shown actually...wasn&#39;t quite as bloody as it would have been in real life. It was more that you could clearly see the edges of the openings, whereas in real-life, had someone been beaten that severly there would have been much more blood. The blood in that scene was more of the trail as they dragged Christ away. The Roman soldiers are portrayed as enjoying what they are doing though, which &quot;could&quot; be true. <br/>
 <br/>
They do keep punching and kicking Christ at just about every oppportunity, and are shown using the butt of a spear to press the thorny crown into His head. As He is carrying the cross, they continue to strike at Him to keep Him going as if He was an animal. <br/>
 <br/>
The crucifixion scene itself shows them placing the nail on his hand, then shows them drawing back to drive it in...then shows it poking through the wood beneath with blood running down. <br/>
 <br/>
The only part that I didn&#39;t actually watch was while, on their crosses, after taunting Christ, the one theif has an eye poked out by a crow. <br/>
 <br/>
Afterwards, when the soldier pierces Christ&#39;s side, the blood is showing spewing forth..showering the soldier, rather than seeping out as is commonly portrayed. <br/>
 <br/>
What affected me was that it is so easy, even as a Christian, to just think..Ok, Christ died for my sins and it happened to be up on a cross. To keep it in a sanitized sort of understanding, not dwelling on the brutality of it. <br/>
<br/>
This movie brought that home in a way nothing else has. I fully came to realize that anyone else would not have been able to keep going through all of that, let alone to live so long upon the cross. And the fact that He CHOSE to do so is amazingly wonderful. <br/>
 <br/>
There are some very Catholic overtones to the story as it is portrayed, but given that the director is a devout Catholic, then it&#39;s to be expected. But overall, it is true to the Gospels and wonderful. <br/>
 <br/>
One thing that I especially liked is that Mr. Gibson didn&#39;t ignore the spiritual warfare aspect of the entire situation. Satan is there prominently, taunting Christ and trying to get Him to give up. While the Scriptures don&#39;t mention that Satan was there, it&#39;s easy to understand that he must have been...how could he not have tried, especially given his earlier temptations to Christ? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856703006">About violence and brutality on the screen, and how reason can cope <br/>
with it --      <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  To keep it in a sanitized sort of understanding, not dwelling on the <br/>
&gt; brutality of it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>      To reason about it rather than being emotionally overpowered and <br/>
rendered intellectually helpless before it, you mean? <br/>
<br/>
       Yeah, that seems to be the whole point of this film. From all accounts <br/>
(haven&#39;t seen it myself) it does an effective job of short-circuiting reason <br/>
and going straight for the emotional jugular vein, even of non-Christians one <br/>
way or another. <br/>
<br/>
       Religion is all about Power of Story, and so are the movies. It&#39;s a <br/>
potent combination.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       Not to quibble (since we just agreed this is about emotion rather than <br/>
knowledge and reason), but didn&#39;t death on the cross usually require days to <br/>
slowly perish from asphyxia? I was taught that Jesus&#39; death was unusually <br/>
quick in coming, probably because of the earlier wounds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       Again not to quibble, but I&#39;ve read news accounts saying Gibson cannot <br/>
be considered a &quot;devout Catholic&quot; and may not be Catholic at all. Apparently <br/>
he rejects most tenets of organized Catholicism, including the Pope&#39;s <br/>
infallibility. OTOH, I am neither Catholic nor Jewish, nor have I see the movie, so <br/>
what do I know? &lt;g&gt; The point is that there are questions, lots of reasonable <br/>
questions, when one isn&#39;t all caught up in vivid, violent, emotional power of <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; One thing that I especially liked is that Mr. Gibson didn&#39;t ignore the <br/>
&gt; spiritual warfare aspect of the entire situation. <br/>

<br/>

ANYONE make about this movie, Elizabeth!  Good for you. <br/>
<br/>
       Spiritual warfare indeed.  JJ<br/>

The Romans didn&#39;t have a particular stake in Jesus&#39; death over, say, the two theives on the <br/>
cross. So why the extra laughter and joking and making their task harder by beating him <br/>
all the way up the Via Dolorosa?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree.  I haven&#39;t seen the movie, but I know the story &lt;grin&gt;.  I was<br/>
&gt; watching Dennis Miller tonight and they were talking about all the<br/>
&gt; anti-semitism, etc., etc..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How can something be bigotry if it is a representation of historical fact?<br/>
&gt; It is like saying &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; is Anti-German or &quot;The Donner Party&quot; is<br/>
&gt; Anti-carnivore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It isn&#39;t like it is some new theory that Mel came up with....The plot has<br/>
&gt; been around for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And that position has been responsible for the deaths of millions of Jews over the course <br/>
of our Christian history. It&#39;s one thing to show a representation of the Gospel that includes <br/>
Jewish leaders who wanted Jesus dead (there is no real treatment of the reasons for that <br/>
position in this movie), it&#39;s another to make them look like villians in a melodrama.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the history of composition of the Gospels (Marcus Borg has a pretty readabled <br/>
book called _Reading the Bible Again for the First Time_). You&#39;ll get a window of insight <br/>
into why the Gospels are written the way they are based on the times in which they were <br/>
written...<br/>

had anticipated being moved to tears over what Jesus went through. I was not only not <br/>
moved, but I was left cold.<br/>
<br/>
I felt like who Jesus is to me was missing from that movie.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s easy to think that &quot;because it&#39;s in the original story, it is legit.&quot; When we think of WWII <br/>
movies, we have had to come to a place where we no longer caricature the Japanese, for <br/>
instance, because the issues were far more complex than what we wanted to believe about <br/>
them right after WWII.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of nuanced understanding of Romans, Jews, etc. has been stunted in Christian <br/>
history because of a literalist interpretation of the Gospels without also learning the <br/>
hitorical context of composition. That literalism has been the groundwork for generations <br/>
of anti-semitism.<br/>
