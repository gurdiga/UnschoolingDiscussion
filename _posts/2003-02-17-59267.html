<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104870149">Hey everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve an almost 4 who wants to learn to read. I do not think at this point<br/>
she will be satisfied with simply telling her the letters as she requests. I<br/>
have the feeling that she actually wants more of a workbook type thing,<br/>
where she is reading words etc. and well, learning to do what her older sibs<br/>
already are doing. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m trying to find a reading system that is fun, relaxed and not<br/>
restritctive. Obviously we start and stop at her request, even if we stop<br/>
for five years... which is why I want something inexpensive.  <br/>
<br/>
The thing is she really wants to learn to read. She likes the Bob books, but<br/>
I&#39;m not certain it is enough for her in the end...<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone unschooled their child in reading actually using some system?<br/>
What system worked well for your child? <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;So I&#39;m trying to find a reading system that is fun, relaxed and not<br/>
restritctive.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One easy thing you could make is get a piece of cardboard and cut two slots <br/>
with an exacto.  Not just a line, but a little open rectangle for a paper to <br/>
slide through.  I&#39;m explaining this backwards...<br/>
<br/>
Think of an easy word, and maybe one like her name or like a word she likes.<br/>
<br/>
Put all but one letter or sound in, like if her name&#39;s &quot;PAT&quot; you could leave <br/>
a blank and then put <br/>
A T<br/>
<br/>
Then on a strip of other paper you can write all the other letters or blends <br/>
that could go there, and you pull the strip through and she can read all <br/>
those letters.<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to do that sort of thing, but this one&#39;s fun and not so <br/>
frustrating because they don&#39;t try every letter and sound in the world, you <br/>
just put those that will make words they know.<br/>
<br/>
So your strip could have <br/>
b<br/>
c<br/>
f<br/>
h<br/>
m<br/>
p<br/>
r<br/>
s<br/>
  (they probably don&#39;t know &quot;tat&quot; but if they do, use a t!)<br/>
v<br/>
ch  (unless you want to save blends; we used them early on for our homemade <br/>
reading toys)<br/>
dr<br/>
   (the probably don&#39;t know &quot;frat,&quot; but maybe)<br/>
spl<br/>
th<br/>
<br/>
Those things are disposable, though Holly found one the other day that had <br/>
three slots on one piece of purple cardboard (which came in the back of some <br/>
gift box she got) and it only had two paper strips left, and she said <br/>
forcefully &quot;Don&#39;t throw that away!&quot;  So maybe they&#39;re not always disposable. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can get workbooks without &quot;finding a reading system.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
Well ages ago, long before the idea of homeschooling hit me, I purchased a <br/>
program for Tara through the encyclopedia&#39;s I had bought. This was about 13 <br/>
years ago. Anyway, it was called the Phonics Factory. Had games and all <br/>
kinds of things to do. Well Tara never used all the stuff or even in the <br/>
order it was suppose to go. It also had some audio tapes too. I saved it all <br/>
the years and had it laying around for Joseph and Sierra. By that time I had <br/>
only saved one phonics book, the tapes and the smaller reading books that <br/>
went with it. The kids pulled it out every now and then to listen or play. <br/>
Sometimes a few days in a row, then nothing for month or two. It&#39;s not what <br/>
&quot;got&quot; them reading but it was something fun for them while they figured out <br/>
what they wanted and how to go about it. The thing they really liked was the <br/>
little books. Read along with fat cat and dandy duck and so on. The books <br/>
were progressive and it started out with small sentences and then a picture <br/>
of exactly what the sentence was. Point being, made the kids feel like they <br/>
were reading when they just weren&#39;t ready to actually read themselves. It <br/>
was a fun thing. I&#39;m sure you could find regular books like that for your <br/>
child. That way she would feel like she was reading and having fun and not <br/>
pushing herself or getting frustrated. Even some rhyming books like Dr. <br/>
Seuss might make her feel like she&#39;s reading. All the rest will come when <br/>
she&#39;s ready.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Bob books are great -- you don&#39;t need to know if it&#39;s enough for her in<br/>
the end as long as they seem to be working for her now.<br/>
<br/>
About 2 (?) years ago my oldest (then 6 if I&#39;m not muddling my dates) said<br/>
firmly, &quot;I want to learn to read&quot; and after some conversation I ended up<br/>
buying the Horrible Yet Effective book &quot;How to put you and your child&#39;s<br/>
teeth to sleep while teaching your child to read in 100 easy lessons&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Brit and I, over the course of about 7 months, did the first 30-some lessons<br/>
and then she just stopped (I asked her a few times, she didn&#39;t want to at<br/>
that moment, so I just let it fade, not without gratitude). It did help her<br/>
learn a few useful tricks, and she continued on her merry unschooling way,<br/>
still not reading &quot;really&quot;, but doing as she had done before with picking up<br/>
little bits of reading knowledge here and there.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, Brit again came to me and said determinedly, &quot;I want to learn to<br/>
read. I&#39;m 8 years old, for crying out loud&quot; (yes, she really does say &quot;for<br/>
crying out loud&quot; &lt;g&gt; I&#39;ve picked up the phrase from her).<br/>
<br/>
After I was brought round with smelling salts (tip for unschooled children:<br/>
the way to get your nice calm radical unschooling mom to sink to the floor<br/>
is to let her know you agree with the former President that all children<br/>
need to read by the time they&#39;re 8 years old &lt;g&gt;) and had with tip-toeing<br/>
care made a delicate speech on the fact that many unschooled kids learn to<br/>
read MUCH later than 8, my darling mule, er, I mean daughter, nodded and<br/>
smiled and said, &quot;Yes, but I want to learn to read now. Let&#39;s find that book<br/>
we used before.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;re back to it. I remember to ask most days, or she remembers to ask<br/>
most days, and it&#39;s been about 10 days now and her 5 year old sister decided<br/>
to sit down with us each time, too, which admittedly makes it more fun but<br/>
if you think I *like* looking like the Poster Mom for school at home with my<br/>
children pouring over a *shudder* Reading Program every day, well... all I<br/>
can say is, I have found that there are no limits to the things I&#39;ll do for<br/>
love of my daughters. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We used the little boxed sets of Bob Books.  They are also divided up<br/>
into books which have one or two vowels sounds and have clear<br/>
illustrations.  As our son was in school at the time, I can&#39;t say they<br/>
&quot;taught him to read&quot; but I do think they were a big part of his<br/>
lightbulb moment.<br/>
<br/>
And, as with the other set mentioned, they are little books which make<br/>
kids feel good about what they are acomplishing.  I recommend them.<br/>

<br/>
Holly saw that at a friend&#39;s house and wanted a copy.  We got one.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked her lately what she thought  helped her most, she said the three <br/>
lessons we did in that (around #18ish) helped a little, but mostly it was <br/>
Harry Potter cards.<br/>
<br/>
If by the time she wanted that book she could start way into it, some people <br/>
would say she could already read. <br/>
<br/>
I think she just stayed at simmer a long time before she boiled.  Now she can <br/>
read just about anything, though she still sounds words out phonetically <br/>
sometimes and misses.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day she misread &quot;curtain,&quot; so I wrote down<br/>
carton<br/>
curtain<br/>
certain<br/>
<br/>
It took fifteen seconds, and seemed to help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-495980827">snip&gt;&gt;&gt;Has anyone unschooled their child in reading actually using some<br/>
system?  What system worked well for your child?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids express an interest in something, I do not look for a system to<br/>
help them learn it.  I try to answer their specific questions as they come<br/>
up, and bring things to their attention that might relate to that interest.<br/>
I do have a fair amount of &quot;learning toys&quot; around my house.  I bought a lot<br/>
of it before I was introduced to unschooling.   I have kept a lot of it,<br/>
because my kids enjoy PLAYING with it.  I enjoy playing with them or<br/>
watching them play and noticing what they are learning, but I have let go of<br/>
feeling that there must be a particular outcome from using those items.<br/>
They love to make geometric designs with cuisenaire rods, for instance.<br/>
This morning, I had the scrabble letters out to help me do the Jumble<br/>
puzzle.  My 7yod took two letters and asked me what it said.  She repeated<br/>
the sound.  Then she added a new letter and did the same thing.  She got up<br/>
to 6 or 7 letters.  It was pretty hard to pronounce, since it was mostly<br/>
consonants!  When she added an &quot;s&quot; I said, now you made it plural, and said<br/>
the new word.  Then, she got out some paper and folded it to make a little<br/>
book.  She said she was making a book to help kids learns to read.  She made<br/>
a list of &quot;_at&quot; words on the first page, then &quot;_an&quot; words.   She asked me if<br/>
I could think of any more.  I said wan, but she said that would be too hard<br/>
for kids because it didn&#39;t sound the same as the other &quot;_an&quot; words.  Then<br/>
she said it was enough for now, and went off to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting thing, is that my not-yet-reader loves to write.  She<br/>
writes a lot, either copying things or asking me to spell them for her.  She<br/>
now knows how to write many words on her own, even though she can&#39;t always<br/>
read what she has written, can&#39;t read the same word in another context.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas that might, or might not! be helpful in your situation.<br/>
<br/>
My 7yod loves her board books that have one word for page.  She &quot;reads&quot; them<br/>
to us often.  She has also memorized a couple of short books and reads them<br/>
to us.  I have heard that many children learn to read by memorizing a book,<br/>
then at some point connecting how the printed word matches what they are<br/>
saying.  (Does that make sense?)<br/>
<br/>
How about Richard Scary&#39;s Biggest Word Book Ever?  I loved that book when I<br/>
was a kid.  It has little stories that you can read to her, and if she<br/>
really wants to read, it is full of pictures with labels.  If she changes<br/>
her mind about learning to read right now, it can be just another book in<br/>
the house and you won&#39;t have wasted your money.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;snip&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have the feeling that she actually wants more of a workbook<br/>
 </span></blockquote>type thing, where she is reading words etc. and well, learning to do what<br/>
her older sibs already are doing. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of inexpensive workbook/coloring books for young kids.  Why<br/>
do you think she wants a workbook?  Are her older sibs schooling?  Are her<br/>
older siblings doing workbooks, and that&#39;s why she wants them?  Just be sure<br/>
that a workbook doesn&#39;t become something she feels she *must* do or that she<br/>
thinks that is the only way to learn how to read.  Be careful to not go<br/>
overboard and push her beyond what she is interested in.  Be willing to let<br/>
her stop.  (It sounds like you are prepared to do that.)  She might be quite<br/>
happy to play at reading, rather than truly be reading.<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago, my mom bought us a phonics sticker book.  Each page had<br/>
one set of words, like &quot;_at&quot; with a bunch of words that could be made from<br/>
that sound and with pictures to help them figure out the word.  Truthfully,<br/>
my kids haven&#39;t used the book a lot, but it might be just the ticket for a<br/>
young child who is asking to learn how to read.  Just checked and I still<br/>
have it.  ISBN 1-56293-825-8 My Phonics Word Book.  Beginner Picture<br/>
Dictionaries are fun for some kids.<br/>
<br/>
snip&gt;&gt;&gt;She likes the Bob books, but I&#39;m not certain it is enough for her in<br/>
the end...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you already have the Bob books, why not read them to/with her?  I did use<br/>
Bob books with my first child, but she took off reading on her own without<br/>
ever going beyond the first set.  If Bob books are not enough for her, you<br/>
can worry about that when they become not enough.  She might be very happy<br/>
to have just a few books that she can really read and not need more than<br/>
that for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, go to unschooling.com and read the essays on reading and<br/>
late readers.  There is at least one that describes many ways to help<br/>
children learn to read and also these essays will reasure you that she will<br/>
read when she is ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597800676">I have used magnetic letters to demonstrate sounding out words, then doing<br/>
rhyming words or changing certain letters to see what happens to the word.<br/>
But, one of mine wanted me to &quot;teach him to read&quot;.  I got the book  _Teach<br/>
Your Child To Read in 100 Easy Lessons_ from the library and he loved it.<br/>
But, I have to warn you, that if you use it according to the instuctions it<br/>
could be mind-numbing!!!  They tell you exactly what to do and what to say<br/>
and what the child should say.  We just skipped all that and he learned the<br/>
sounds as they were presented and read the words for practice.  What I<br/>
really liked about it was that it starts with just a few letters, you read<br/>
words containing just those letters, then they gradually add more.  They<br/>
also have different notations for hard and soft vowel sounds, which<br/>
gradually are eliminated toward the end of the book.<br/>
<br/>
They recommend a lesson a day, but we often did four or five in a row since<br/>
we skipped all the repetitve stuff.  Sometimes we skipped it for several<br/>
days, then reviewed before going on.<br/>
<br/>
 I realized after getting this book that when I told them what sounds a<br/>
letter makes I had it all wrong!  M sounds like mmmmmm, not mah.  T isn&#39;t<br/>
really tah, but a very short &quot;t&quot;.  It makes a big difference.  Mat isn&#39;t<br/>
pronounced &quot;mah-a-tah&quot;, even if you run it all together it doesn&#39;t sound<br/>
like mat.  I hope this makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>

<br/>
We just went to the pages of words, which ends up being kind of like pulling <br/>
a strip of paper through cardboard cut-outs.   She only did just a very few <br/>
pages and then went back to other things.  I&#39;m sorry we ever bought the book <br/>
(used), but it made Holly feel better somehow, like a talisman.<br/>
<br/>
All my kids can read anyway, and I would MUCH rather Holly have visions of <br/>
Harry Potter cards in her head than the two-color weird vowel markings and <br/>
soft/hard consonant made-up annotations that were in the book.  YUCK!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830784183">We make up different variations of the Memory game. My 3dd and 5dd cut<br/>
out pictures of different objects out of magazines and glue them to 3x5<br/>
cards. For 3dd, 5dd will write the first letter of the word on another<br/>
3x5 card. For 5dd, I will write the whole word on another 3x5 card. We<br/>
use about four object cards and four letter or word cards at a time,<br/>
otherwise it gets overwhelming for them. Flip all the cards upside down.<br/>
Flip over two at a time and match the picture to the letter or word. We<br/>
have also done this using 3x5 cards with uppercase and lower case letters<br/>
on them. 5dd liked to have a list of all the letters near by for a quick<br/>
glance if she forgot. The only rule was having fun.<br/>

Both girls also like Reader Rabbit and JumpStart computer &quot;games&quot;, which<br/>
are really no more than workbooks on disk. A little more interactive, and<br/>
even though I hate the &quot;smiley face reward&quot; idea, the girls love to work<br/>

use it like the directions said, but it served it&#39;s purpose at the time.<br/>

&gt; They recommend a lesson a day, but we often did four or five in a row since<br/>
&gt; we skipped all the repetitve stuff.  Sometimes we skipped it for several<br/>
&gt; days, then reviewed before going on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I realized after getting this book that when I told them what sounds a<br/>
&gt; letter makes I had it all wrong!  M sounds like mmmmmm, not mah.  T isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really tah, but a very short &quot;t&quot;.  It makes a big difference.  Mat isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; pronounced &quot;mah-a-tah&quot;, even if you run it all together it doesn&#39;t sound<br/>
&gt; like mat.  I hope this makes sense.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good Luck,<br/>

it. And it really helped because my daughter had/has some speech <br/>
problems and she just didn&#39;t pick of the different nuances the way other <br/>
  kids seem to. I liked the page of the different sounds set up in a <br/>
chart and even just looking at them transcribed so that each separate <br/>
sound was shown clearly seemed to really resonate with her. Maybe the <br/>
best way to use Teach Your Child.... is for the parent to read it. ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We ended up homeschooling speech therapy too. My insurance approved a <br/>
set of exercises, then the speech therapy office thought they didn&#39;t, so <br/>
they offered us a reduced package where we went four times and paid <br/>
directly. I took hand written notes from the therapist and transcribed <br/>
them and used the exercises to help my daughter at home. It turned out <br/>
that a big problem for her speaking clearly was just a very minor tongue <br/>
holding thing. Once she became aware of it her speech dramatically <br/>
improved in a short time. She had pediatric dental problems and lost her <br/>
front teeth early and that probably helped contribute to the lack of <br/>
awareness. So, I am glad we went. Found out later that my insurance <br/>
would have covered it and they would have set us up for the maximum <br/>
amount covered by our insurance -- 25 sessions. I think that would have <br/>
been way too much &quot;school&quot; for us. Funny how our suggested needs for <br/>
therapy assistance expanded or shrank depending on the insurance support. ;)<br/>
