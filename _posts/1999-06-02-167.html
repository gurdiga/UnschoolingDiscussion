&gt;Hi Shannon,<br/>
&gt;	That was me who thought I was the only one from CA, but as I said, <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been flying through all of the bios here.  Glad to see someone else<br/>

<br/>
Santa Cruz Mountains huh?  I grew up in San Francisco, and when my best<br/>
friend (who lived in Menlo Park) moved to Boulder Creek I started spending<br/>
a lot of time up there in BC, Ben Lomond (sp?) and the surrounding area.  I<br/>
had friends of my own up there before long.  The kids all went to Scotts<br/>
Valley high, and some of them lived on a commune up in BL with their<br/>
parents.  My friend still lives in the area, though we have drifted apart.<br/>
I believe she is one of the local mail carriers!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236285418">Hi Nanci,<br/>
	Small world.  I live in Boulder Creek.  I, too, spent time here as a <br/>
teenager, but that was a zillion years ago.......I&#39;ve come to find out over <br/>
the 12 years we&#39;ve owned a home here, that many have youthful ties to this <br/>
area.  <br/>
	Hmmm, there is no Scotts Valley High........not yet at least.  <br/>
They&#39;ve been working on the politics of getting a h.s. built there for years <br/>
but the kids in this area go to San Lorenzo High; Scotts Valley kids go to <br/>
Santa Cruz.  <br/>
	Gosh, I wonder if I know your friend.  A couple of our really close <br/>
friends are postal employees in Soquel.  Thanks for the email.<br/>
Judy in CA<br/>
