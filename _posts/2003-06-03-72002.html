<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938010823">This was posted on my local support group list last weekend.  No one else <br/>
has responded so I want to try to help.   I know this family but not real <br/>
well.  Have never discussed unschooling with them.  Hubby is a pretty <br/>
mainstream thinker, other than supporting the homeschool thing...<br/>
Any suggestions to fulfill the request for a test?  very easy and general?<br/>
And what materials would you suggest for helping the mom persuade the dad <br/>
that testing and &quot;what she&#39;s supposed to know&quot; are so unnecessary?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I was wondering if anyone could help me find a first grade test. My <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;husband<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wants our daughter tested because he wants to make sure she knows what she <br/>
is<br/>
supposed to know.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to spend any $ because $ is tight ,like for everyone.<br/>
Does any one know of any websites that have test that can be printed out or<br/>
anything like that.<br/>
Thanks for any help and have a great rest of the weekend&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks you guys.<br/>
<br/>

having been exposed to those topics.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the link here, but if you go to google and put in worldbook <br/>
grades I think it will show up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OMG, we just did this by accident last week, my 10yo unschooler and <br/>
I. I had a copy of it printed out in my homeschooling notebook (a 2 <br/>
inch binder that weighs about a hundred pounds, but I poke holes in <br/>
EVERYTHING and file it in their for the doubting days)<br/>
<br/>
We are coming to the end of our second year(first full year) of <br/>
unschooling and were discussing putting together a portfolio. As a <br/>
former schooler, I know she expresses concern that she is not as <br/>
*smart* as the other kids her age, that she doesn&#39;t sit down and <br/>
learn enough....still deschooling. <br/>
<br/>
So I came across this sheet, and had an example off the top of my <br/>
head for every topic on the scope and sequence, with exception to <br/>
prime numbers and sentence types (declarative, exclamatory, <br/>
interrogative if I recall--I thought it was insignificant because she <br/>
knows how to speak and write correctly without knowing how to label <br/>
the sentence type). <br/>
<br/>
She was like WOW! I learned a lot this year without sitting down and <br/>
doing much at all! <br/>
<br/>
I really tried to impress that this list doesn&#39;t mean she knows <br/>
everything that a kid at the local school knows, because some school <br/>
curriculums vary from district to school to even classroom. I said <br/>
that someone will always know more than her about a subject, and as <br/>
long as she is learning things that have meaning to her personally, <br/>
that is what concerns me most.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t even going to mention it here, because it didn&#39;t sound <br/>
unschoolish enough, but it made us both sit back and say HEY! This <br/>
stuff works without all the stress and hassle. <br/>
