<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That why I said &quot;for the most part.&quot; I know there are bad eggs out there as<br/>
&gt; there is in any situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry that wasn&#39;t clear to me.  You said &quot;for the most part&quot; in<br/>
reference to the hunters part.  I objected based on the second sentence:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; It is non hunters that litter, cut<br/>
&gt;&gt;down trees and do cruel things to animals.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And my point is that most non hunters don&#39;t do those things, either.  There<br/>
are a few bad eggs.  But you phrased it as though there are a few good eggs,<br/>
but most are rotton.  I&#39;m suspicious that there are rotton eggs on both,<br/>
with the majority being good.<br/>
<br/>
brenda<br/>
who still wants to believe that most people are good, so if it&#39;s not true,<br/>
don&#39;t tell me.</div>
