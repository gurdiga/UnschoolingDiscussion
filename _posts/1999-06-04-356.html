<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167218795">I had an experience this morning where my best friend, who lives in Los<br/>
Angeles to my Tacoma, WA, told me not to send her any information on<br/>
homeschooling or unschooling. She said she just didn&#39;t agree with me and<br/>
that she had her way and I had my way and that was the way it was. She said<br/>
she didn&#39;t want to argue about it, so we just couldn&#39;t talk about it. (We<br/>
haven&#39;t argued about it. In fact, we&#39;ve hardly talked about it. )<br/>
<br/>
But before she told me this, in a previous email she said, &quot;I guess the<br/>
main thing I&#39;m concerned about is that they&#39;re going to miss out on social<br/>
things at school and that they won&#39;t have a varied curriculum.  Also, how<br/>
do they get a diploma or credits for going to college?  I don&#39;t know<br/>
anything about these things.  What about proms, football games, etc.,<br/>
things that I really loved in school.  Tell me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I tried to tell her. I sent her one article from the free emails from<br/>
the Home Ed Magazine. ONE article. I was going to try to spoonfeed her. She<br/>
couldn&#39;t even read that. She knows absolutely NOTHING about the subject,<br/>
but she has already formed her opinion. I&#39;m telling you, I &#39;bout crapped my<br/>
drawers. I have know this woman longer than I&#39;ve known my husband (16<br/>
years), and I never knew she was so narrow-minded. I&#39;m at a loss for what<br/>
to do because it&#39;s going to be hard for me to get over her closed mind.<br/>
<br/>
What she is saying is that her opinion, which is based on NOTHING -- she<br/>
has already admitted the knows nothing about the subject -- is more valid<br/>
than my opinion, which is based on a lot of time and research and the love<br/>
of my children. Boy, the more I think about it, the madder I get.<br/>

&gt;     Unfortunately, we have done so in a way.  We don&#39;t see my parents even a<br/>

&gt;hate to see it happen like that, but whenever I bend just a little and<br/>
&gt;apologize, they seem to think that I am admitting that I am wrong, and they<br/>

Robin ~<br/>
<br/>
I know exactly how you feel. My friends, too, have severely questioned<br/>
my unschooling choice. When they are just asking me general questions<br/>
about it, I can sense their disapproval. I&#39;ve learned to say as little<br/>
as possible, but I think that the unschooling website section about how<br/>
to explain it to other people is going to be helpful with regard to<br/>
certain &quot;buzz words&quot; which might prove beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the reason many people (like your friend) are so angered at our<br/>
unschooling decision is because deep inside, they are jealous at seeing<br/>
someone else take control, charge, and power over their life. Think<br/>
about it: most women we know are on the fast track and life, in essence,<br/>
is controlling them. When they see another woman who is taking charge of<br/>
her life and (probably) doing so at some level of sacrifice, it forces<br/>
them to look truthfully at their own life. At least, that&#39;s what I see<br/>
happening with a couple of my girlfriends. I even hear them make<br/>
comments like, &quot;Maybe I should have homeschooled my kids,&quot; but then they<br/>
go right back to questioning my choice.<br/>
<br/>
I think trying to &quot;convince&quot; others that unschooling is the right thing<br/>
to do is like trying to convince someone to change their religion or<br/>
something like that, just because we think they should. In my case,<br/>
unschooling was a discovery I had to make for myself, just like my being<br/>
born again was a discovery I had to make for myself. Embracing<br/>
unschooling was a process for me; a journey. How do you &quot;explain&quot; that<br/>
to someone else? Why should we be required to? We don&#39;t have to explain<br/>
to them why we go to the church we do, or why we shop at the grocery<br/>
store we do, etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that most people truly believe that public school education<br/>
in this country is in big trouble, but they are not willing to do<br/>
anything about it. And those of us who ARE willing to do something about<br/>
it, are threatening to them.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents...<br/>

I must have left out a puzzle piece here. My friend&#39;s only child is 32<br/>
years old, just got married. We are only talking about MY children, who are<br/>
her godchildren. So she has a vested interest in them (7 and 2 years). But<br/>
it doesn&#39;t sound like it because she&#39;s not even willing to learn one tidbit<br/>
of info regarding home/unschooling. She loves them, I know, so I would have<br/>
thought she would have taken an interest in this -- even if she disagreed.<br/>
I would have thought she would want to know more so she could THEN form her<br/>
opinion.<br/>

I think you hit several nails on the head. I shouldn&#39;t be trying to<br/>
explain. I&#39;m going to force myself to stop that right away. And yes, I<br/>
think people are scared or threatened when we show we CAN do something<br/>
different than the norm. My friend is from the school of &quot;Well, we&#39;ve<br/>
always done it this way, so we will continue to do it this way.&quot; That<br/>
doesn&#39;t make it right, though. I sound confident, don&#39;t I? I&#39;m not. But I<br/>
will work on that, too.<br/>

that&#39;s a fine line. Yes, she hurt my feelings when she showed me she didn&#39;t<br/>
give a crap for my opinion. All this time I thought we were on equal<br/>
footing, ond now I guess she&#39;s always been too smart for me, or so she<br/>
apparently thinks (has thought). I know we will have to speak on the phone<br/>
to work this out, but I don&#39;t feel like it now. I need some time with my<br/>
thoughts.<br/>

homeschooling until she has read at LEAST as many books and articles on the <br/>
subject as you have.  An informed, negative opinion is one thing.  Choosing <br/>
ignorance is another.  Shut the door on her opinions now and save yourself <br/>

You are RIGHT ON!  I&#39;ve been mainly lurking, but had to express my thoughts <br/>
on your statements.<br/>
(I&#39;m feeling the need to qualify myself, since I haven&#39;t introduced myself, <br/>
yet:  I come from a psychology back-ground & as a matter of fact, my MIL is <br/>
a psychologist-who has been quite supportive of our parenting/educating <br/>
decisions...)<br/>
Anyway<br/>
YES, these people see our choices as a threat to them.  They will not be <br/>
convinced.  Don&#39;t even bother trying.  They have been in denial of their <br/>
abilities to choose options outside of their realm.  They are threated that <br/>
we may feel superior, like they&#39;re being judged--so they get defensive and <br/>
judge us.  (...the best defense is a good offense...someone once said)<br/>
They are more comfortable with feeling helpless, not questioning authority, <br/>
and acting like they can&#39;t be part of the solution to what ails this <br/>
society. (the &quot;boys will be boys&quot; mentality when their child bullies <br/>
someone...)<br/>
They take comfort in their denial that the horrible acts among this <br/>
country&#39;s high schools, will never happen to them....  (today, maybe...)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Robin,<br/>
I hear you.  I have a very small group of friends here, consisting of the<br/>
other mothers in my playgroup.  I don&#39;t make friends easily owing to some<br/>
shyness and my fear of judgement or rejection, although I am (I believe) a<br/>
fairly articulate and intelligent person, and I know I am a loyal and<br/>
thoughtful friend.  It took me a long time to get to know these women, and<br/>
we are still mostly more acquaintances than friends.  Today I shared my<br/>
excitement with them about unschooling and all the information I was<br/>
discovering on the internet.  They told me they thought the &quot;lack of<br/>
accountability&quot; for Idaho homeschoolers was &quot;awful&quot; and that many people<br/>
would probably not teach their children the basic necessities.  They went<br/>
on to say &quot;How are you going to socialize you kids when there are not many<br/>
other homeschoolers around here?&quot;  I tried to explain that there are other,<br/>
non-homeschool related social outlets (like this playgroup!!) scouts, youth<br/>
groups, 4H, on and on.  They nodded, but seemed dissatisfied.  <br/>
<br/>
I dropped the subject after a few more unsuccessful minutes of trying to<br/>
help them see the positives of unschooling.  I tried to tell them that I<br/>
believe that many children have been failed by the ps system.  They told me<br/>
that was &quot;not true&quot;, even though I, myself, am a case in point and I know a<br/>
number of other adults, and kids now in ps who are similarly affected.<br/>
Like my next door neighbors, and my niece and nephew to name just a few.  <br/>
<br/>
I am really disappointed!  I don&#39;t get to go out much and talk to other<br/>
Mothers or have any social outlets because my children are so little and<br/>
can&#39;t keep up with a very large outing and their nap and feeding schedules<br/>
often vary depending on a number of factors.  Also it&#39;s hard to do anything<br/>
when both hands are occupied with one toddler who runs away laughing at<br/>
every opportunity and one who is still very unsteady on his feet and must<br/>
usually be carried.  The other moms in the playgroup take their children to<br/>
kinder-gym and kinder-music and stuff like that.  But I don&#39;t see a need<br/>
for that, and we have plenty of fun right here at home, or in the local<br/>
playground.  I am desperate to meet someone around here with similar age<br/>
kids and similar interests in homeschooling/unschooling.  We are not<br/>
religiously affiliated, and the in the large Mormon and fundamental<br/>
Chirstian population here it is hard to find friends who won&#39;t judge you or<br/>
try to convert you.<br/>

I am curious about anyone here who chats using AOL online or ICQ.  I use<br/>
both, and always have them on when I am online, so I can be contacted.  It<br/>
helps me deal with my &#39;emotional isolation&#39; if I can blow off steam<br/>
chatting with folks in the evening.  I find it really helpful for dealing<br/>
with adoption issues when my adoption aqaintances are online and I am sure<br/>
I would fine it the same for unschooling friends.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be nice to have some folks to call friends again.  It has been a<br/>
long time, with lots of moving, getting married and having babies, and all<br/>
the friends I used to have things in common with don&#39;t have time for me<br/>
now, in their professional lives.  I really miss having folks over for a<br/>
relaxing evening of adult conversation and good food.  I grow weary of<br/>
conversations about monsters, dragons, A Bug&#39;s Life,  hockey, soccer, etc<br/>

My dh and I have come to the conclusion the WE GET IT!!!  We have to grow and nuture our kids, not give birth, start them in early school programs not necessairly for the benefit of learning but just to get them out of our hair.  We have to be involved in everything they do.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had my dd in a kid&#39;s music class since she was 3 months(she is now 2) which she just loves.  The other parents were discussing, pre-preschool and why didn&#39;t the park district have more classes for kids that weren&#39;t parent involved?  My mouth dropped.  They are only 2!!  How can you not be involved??  One mom was saying that she was trying to figure a way to get her ds in prescool early just to have more time to herself.  <br/>
<br/>
Quite frankly. the thought of preschool sort of made me sad.  I have seen my daughter progress so much over the first two years of her life, could I let someone else have the privlege of seeing her draw picture of her family, and etc.  I guess that is why the idea of homeschooling came so naturally to us.  God gave us these children to grow, not manufactor like a pair of shoes and hope the person who gets them treats them well.<br/>
<br/>
I think that is the country&#39;s biggest problem right now, kids are manufactored not grown.  Be confident in knowing that you are growing good children who are going to be responsible active particpants of future society.  It is the other peoples&#39; children you have to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...<br/>
<br/>
I will get off of my soap box now!!!<br/>

Thanks for the sympathy.  However, I find it difficult to manage all my<br/>
stress relief, shoulder crying and comiserating, as well as all my<br/>
comraderie and sharing of mutual excitement and ideas, over the internet.<br/>
I don&#39;t know anyone in person who is &#39;like minded.&#39; <br/>
<br/>
 I like to get together for tea with girlfriends while my kids are sleeping<br/>
(not happening) or go out to lunch together at a little cafe (not<br/>
happening) or have couples and single friends over for dinner and<br/>
conversation (not happening.)  I am also a very physically affectionate<br/>
person and I enjoy being tactile with people.  I like to hug my friends and<br/>
be close to them when we are talking and sharing.  But I don&#39;t have any<br/>
good friends here like that.  We moved too recently and I am too shy and<br/>
cautious with strangers in person.  The ladies in the Playgroup seem to be<br/>
maintaining their emotional comfort distance, and my husband is always<br/>
nagging me to make some better friends, as he knows I need them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856625277">Hello to all:<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list so I guess I should  just jump in and introduce<br/>
myself. My name is Olivia and I live in Mass. We will &quot;officially&quot; be<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling one 6yo at the end of kindergarten this June. In<br/>
reality, we will simply be going back to the kinds of fun things we had<br/>
time to do before the intrusion of school schedules. I am a little nervous<br/>
about mentioning to people that my son will not be going to first grade in<br/>
the fall; I hate having to explain our reasons over and over again to that<br/>
puzzled or disapproving look on people&#39;s faces. Also, I worry about my<br/>
only-child son not having  many non-adult playmates available once public<br/>
school resumes in September. We are working on finding similarly-minded<br/>
families in the area.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t going to post just yet, but Julie&#39;s comments about &quot;manufactured&quot;<br/>
children struck a chord with me. While sitting on the sidelines of my son&#39;s<br/>
sporting events and on a recent school field trip, I had the chance to hear<br/>
lots of conversations about how &quot;busy&quot; kids are: that is, how they are<br/>
shuttled from one place to another while parents work. Some kids never see<br/>
a parent from 7AM to 7PM. A very large number of my son&#39;s kindergarten<br/>
classmates this year went right to day-care from school. (This makes it<br/>
hard to have friends outside of school if you don&#39;t go to daycare.) <br/>
<br/>
I am a stay-at-home mom (a rarity around here), and people always ask when<br/>
I will be going back to work, or say  they couldn&#39;t stand to be at home all<br/>
day with their kids. I began to feel like something was wrong with me<br/>
because I wanted to have my son close to home and felt like something was<br/>
not right about turning over my little boy to an anonymous school system<br/>
that is not welcoming to parents in the classroom. I am sure that other<br/>
parents must feel isolated from their children once they go to school, but<br/>
they are told by society that they have to learn to &quot;let go&quot;. I thank a<br/>
friend of mine for suggesting the idea of homeschooling last fall. Like a<br/>
lot of people here, I started by searching the internet and read my first<br/>
Holt book &quot;How Children Learn&quot; and it was a breath of fresh air. I know, in<br/>
my heart, that there is nothing wrong with wanting to be home with my son,<br/>
even if other people try to convince me otherwise, especially if that is<br/>
what he wants too. I am glad to be able to give him the option of learning<br/>
outside of school. I wonder how many kids who say they like school do so<br/>
only to please parents, or because school is better than the alternative of<br/>
all-day day-care or being home alone.<br/>
<br/>
OK, thanks for sharing the soap-box! LOL<br/>

&gt;Gee thanks Marti!<br/>
&gt;I am curious about anyone here who chats using AOL online or ICQ.  I use<br/>
&gt;both, and always have them on when I am online, so I can be contacted.  It<br/>
&gt;helps me deal with my &#39;emotional isolation&#39; if I can blow off steam<br/>
&gt;chatting with folks in the evening.  I find it really helpful for dealing<br/>
&gt;with adoption issues when my adoption aqaintances are online and I am sure<br/>
&gt;I would fine it the same for unschooling friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It would be nice to have some folks to call friends again.  It has been a<br/>
&gt;long time, with lots of moving, getting married and having babies, and all<br/>
&gt;the friends I used to have things in common with don&#39;t have time for me<br/>
&gt;now, in their professional lives.  I really miss having folks over for a<br/>
&gt;relaxing evening of adult conversation and good food.  I grow weary of<br/>
&gt;conversations about monsters, dragons, A Bug&#39;s Life,  hockey, soccer, etc<br/>
&gt;from a two year old&#39;s perspective!  I feel like I am regressing!<br/>

Hi and welcome!  You are so right about not letting anyone convince you <br/>
otherwise!  Do what is right for you and your family.  I have never had to <br/>
defend myself about home schooling, everyone I meet wants to know about it <br/>
and how they can get started.  But, I know some people that do and I really <br/>
feel sorry that that has to happen.  I know people that can&#39;t wait for school <br/>
to start to &quot;get rid&quot; of their kids .  Can you imagine how their kids must <br/>
feel to hear their parents  say that, or see them type that in the chat <br/>
rooms?  It really makes me sad.  I am so thankful that I have a husband that <br/>
is supportive, as I am sure all of us are!  <br/>

Thanks for the welcome. I find it so much more relaxing to spend time with<br/>
people who &quot;get it&quot;...that is, can understand my feelings without too much<br/>
explanation. Unfortunately, there will always be times, like when we run<br/>
into a neighbor or someone from a former school, when I&#39;ll have to explain<br/>
why my son isn&#39;t going to school anymore. I should just print up a sheet of<br/>
questions and answers ahead of time and pass them out at the beginning of a<br/>
conversation. LOL  Yes, I feel badly for kids whose parents talk about them<br/>
in such negative ways, especially while the kids are present. Adults don&#39;t<br/>
think that kids are listening, but then you hear those comments repeated<br/>
later by the kids: obviously they were tuning in quite clearly. <br/>

<br/>
About being with people who &quot;get it&quot; philosophically:<br/>
<br/>
A friend who homeschools her 4 children called today to say how<br/>
uncomfortable she is finding it to attend events with pre-homeschool<br/>
playgroups and friends who have just found out she is homeschooling. She<br/>
said she feels like a circus curiosity! People always turn the conversation<br/>
towards the HS subject and away from general chit-chat. Some people have<br/>
treated her homeschooling like a situation from which she needs to be<br/>
rescued. They talk about getting her help and getting her son back to<br/>
school as if &quot;why would she want to be with her kids all day!&quot;  Also, they<br/>
discuss all this in front of her very perceptive kids, who later ask what<br/>
that person was talking about. She feels that people put her oldest son<br/>
(almost 6yo) in a very uncomfortable position when they ask about school,<br/>
what grade he is in (he said  &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; - they don&#39;t follow grades),<br/>
or ask him why he doesn&#39;t want to go to school. Do we really need to find a<br/>
whole new set of acquaintances when homeschooling? Hopefully not, but it<br/>
would make it so much easier to start from scratch!<br/>

I guess it all depends on how you look at things.  I find that I love it when <br/>
people want to talk to me about homeschooling.  I guess I am a teacher at <br/>
heart, but I love to help newbies.  No one ever helped me, I just sorta had <br/>
to fend for myself, guess that is why I am not much into joining groups.  <br/>
Even new people to chat rooms on AOL.  I like to help, someone did take the <br/>
time to help me learn how to download and play wavs, and new people never <br/>
know how.  Anyway, my point, I would find this a great teaching experience <br/>
instead of feeling weird.  I so enjoy what I do that I can&#39;t resist talking <br/>
about it.  So....., no, I don&#39;t think we need to get new friends, just look <br/>
at the situation in a different light.  If it still bothers you, or rather <br/>
your friend, then you might want to get new friends!! <br/>
Am I ratteling here? It is late, I am dead, I apologize!<br/>
nite,<br/>

Of course I had to check my mail before I went to bed!  I think my friend<br/>
is not having people ask about homeschooling in a pleasant,<br/>
information-seeking way, but rather it&#39;s putting her in a defensive<br/>
position. She doesn&#39;t want to have to spend all of her visit, every visit,<br/>
explaining that they are really doing ok, that the kids are happy, and this<br/>
is truly the best option for their family. Sometimes it&#39;s nice just to have<br/>
friendly conversation. I guess she&#39;s been having some negative responses<br/>
from friends, and in front of her kids. We love to talk about homeschooling<br/>
 to interested parties, but always defending oneself can be draining. ( I<br/>
do appreciate all the help people have given me during my homeschooling<br/>
research, and, maybe someday (I hope) when I have more experience, I can<br/>
share that help too.) Right now we need to build our confidence first.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I really didn&#39;t mean to agitate you just before bedtime!  Thanks for<br/>
your perspective!<br/>

Perhaps you touched a nerve with you friend and it was a sensitive one at <br/>
that.  Some people are uncomfortable with being challenged to look at <br/>
something differently.  She may have felt threatened by the information.  <br/>
Maybe she didn&#39;t like thinking that she wasn&#39;t doing the best thing for her <br/>
kids and that made her feel bad.  I don&#39;t discuss this with my sister at all. <br/>
 She sends her kids to preschool which is really an all day daycare center <br/>
under the guise of a school and the older one goes to school.  If I told her <br/>
about the reasons why I homeschool, she would definitely think I was <br/>
criticizing here and saying that she was a bad mother.<br/>

<br/>
I had a friend like that a few years ago. She was constantly belittling our <br/>
choice to homeschool and making me feel rotten (I am NOT a person who likes <br/>
to argue). I finally figured out that she was angry with me because I was <br/>
trying to be different and she can&#39;t understand that concept. She has to have <br/>
the cars, house, clothes ect that everyone else has, and that I stepped out <br/>
of her comfort zone was scary for her. I try very hard NOT to discuss our <br/>
homeschooling life simply because I don&#39;t want to make others feel like I&#39;m <br/>
putting them down for their educational choices. So while my friends rant and <br/>
rave about the school system, I just keep my mouth shut and smile. <br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am new to this list so I guess I should  just jump in and introduce<br/>
&gt;myself. My name is Olivia and I live in Mass. We will &quot;officially&quot; be<br/>
&gt;homeschooling/unschooling one 6yo at the end of kindergarten this June. In<br/>
&gt;reality, we will simply be going back to the kinds of fun things we had<br/>
&gt;time to do before the intrusion of school schedules.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Olivia,<br/>
<br/>
How I wish that  I had been smart enough to search out options when mine<br/>
were that age.  I watched my first born climb onto that huge bus on the<br/>
first of many morning with a gut feeling that this was wrong. My children<br/>
had attended a wonderful daycare in the center of my college, and that<br/>
seemed okay. I had scheduled my classes so as not to have to be there all<br/>
day or even every day. The boys felt like they were living a part of my<br/>
life at the same time. That may sound strange, but by the time that I<br/>
graduated they knew things about the university that I hadn&#39;t known until<br/>
they told me, they visited the planetarium, the biology museum, the library<br/>
and more. But ps that was different. I wasn&#39;t there to stop in between<br/>
classes and take them out with me, we couldn&#39;t walk over the bridge now and<br/>
tell the story of the three trolls like we&#39;d done. Where the day care<br/>
allowed us to remain a family unit still, ps took my son away from me. I<br/>
was now only supposed to show up if invited which bothered me. The things<br/>
my son came home with were horrible, and he began to wet himself out of<br/>
fear almost everyday.  I knew it was wrong but didn&#39;t know I had an option.<br/>
Each day seemed to get worse, until at the end of his 6th grade, he left<br/>
and has slowly become a wonderful teen with a great deal of self esteem and<br/>
self respect finally.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I am a little nervous<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;about mentioning to people that my son will not be going to first grade in<br/>
&gt;the fall; I hate having to explain our reasons over and over again to that<br/>
&gt;puzzled or disapproving look on people&#39;s faces.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you don&#39;t have to. Not many around us even think about it. And some<br/>
who do are so supportive, many with smaller children will ask questions and<br/>
remark how they have decided to keep their children home also. To those who<br/>
have questioned, I have different approaches. To the cashier at the grocery<br/>
store or something who asks why? I simply remark &quot;because we love it&quot; and<br/>
keep on with my business at hand. Friends I&#39;ve answered more indepth when<br/>
they are serious and not just trying to show me the errors of my ways. But<br/>
I&#39;ve walked away from friendships which had lasted up til then almost 15<br/>
years because I wouldn&#39;t take being treated disrespectfully for our<br/>
decisions. Family, well, after telling them why, if they didn&#39;t accept it I<br/>
simply said that they had the chance to make the decisions they felt were<br/>
appropriate for their families and now it was our chance to make our<br/>
decisions. I also told them I wouldn&#39;t tolerate disrespect from them for<br/>
our decisions over education.  That worked and now even my grandparents who<br/>
in the beginning were very against it are thrilled by the way my children<br/>
have blossomed in the two years we&#39;ve been home together.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 Also, I worry about my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;only-child son not having  many non-adult playmates available once public<br/>
&gt;school resumes in September. We are working on finding similarly-minded<br/>
&gt;families in the area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t worry about that too much IMO, I find that the younger the<br/>
child, the less they seem to need others in the same age group around. As<br/>
they mature, they tend to find one or two close friends within a couple<br/>
year age span and keep those friends for most of their lives. Even in<br/>
school, I didn&#39;t have many friends and those I did, didn&#39;t even go to my<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wasn&#39;t going to post just yet, but Julie&#39;s comments about &quot;manufactured&quot;<br/>
&gt;children struck a chord with me. While sitting on the sidelines of my son&#39;s<br/>
&gt;sporting events and on a recent school field trip, I had the chance to hear<br/>
&gt;lots of conversations about how &quot;busy&quot; kids are: that is, how they are<br/>
&gt;shuttled from one place to another while parents work. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is true it seems everywhere (at least in the US) While my boys played<br/>
local soccer for years, parents would ask us if they played baseball at the<br/>
same time, I&#39;d say no we chose one sport for summer, they&#39;d ask which<br/>
soccer traveling league we were on, I&#39;d say none that the costs and time<br/>
took too much from other activities that we wanted. I was told that it&#39;s a<br/>
parents responsiblity to provide all this, it was as if becoming a slave<br/>
with a vehicle was what turned out good children. I didn&#39;t agree and found<br/>
that while the season for soccer seemed too short at times, my children<br/>
didn&#39;t desire/want the hectic schedule that these families believed they<br/>
had to have.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wonder how many kids who say they like school do so<br/>
&gt;only to please parents, or because school is better than the alternative of<br/>
&gt;all-day day-care or being home alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t it amazing how many say they love school. I have a friend who&#39;s<br/>
children still go to school. her daughter (10) tells us how much she likes<br/>
school, then she will ask my 11 yo son what he did today. He will tell her<br/>
and she will remark with &quot;Not fair!&quot;.  I don&#39;t think many know they have an<br/>
option or because school starts at such an early age, they can&#39;t imagine a<br/>
life outside of school.  When my boys were in school, they came home to<br/>
want to veg out in front of the tv, summer vacations became boring, and<br/>
they really didn&#39;t have many interests. But once the decision was made to<br/>
hs and they had their time to deschool they came up with several hobbies<br/>
and found ways that were enjoyable to fill their time. Now they can&#39;t<br/>
imagine sitting in a classroom all day anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;OK, thanks for sharing the soap-box! LOL<br/>
&gt;(Next time I&#39;ll try for not so long and rambling!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t do that, I enjoyed your ramble.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192477032">Hi Lois:<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughtful response. Your family&#39;s college experience<br/>
sounds wonderful; your children had the benefit of varied resources and a<br/>
wide range of contacts while there with you. Yes, public school is very<br/>
divisive to the family unit, separating siblings and children and parents.<br/>
I hated that feeling that something was not quite right when my son went on<br/>
that schoolbus.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that my parents have gradually tried to understand my<br/>
motivations for wanting to try homeschooling, although they still question<br/>
&quot;how will he (my son) learn everything he has to know?&quot;  And  &quot;how are you<br/>
going to make him to learn about subjects that he doesn&#39;t like?&quot;  I try to<br/>
explain my feelings: I don&#39;t think because a state school board decides<br/>
what children should know that this is the definitive book of knowledge.<br/>
And no, I am not going to force him to &quot;study&quot; a subject that is of no<br/>
interest to him right now; that would only push him further away from it.<br/>
We saw that happen in school this year. The school instituted a mandatory<br/>
reading program complete with a competition and prizes. My son had learned<br/>
by himself to read at about age 4, and had always enjoyed reading with me<br/>
at bedtime. But now, because he was forced to do it, he didn&#39;t want to read<br/>
anymore, especially at the end of the program. He is gradually coming back<br/>
to reading, but only the books he likes, not the ones recommended in school.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had had the option to learn at home when I was a child. I was very<br/>
shy and terrified of tests and failing, even though I was a &quot;model&quot;<br/>
student. I would have preferred to stay home and read and draw and make<br/>
things with my mom. But if you had asked me then, I would probably have<br/>
said I liked school because I thought I should like it. Our culture<br/>
revolves around &quot;education&quot; (not learning) as a rite of passage. Too bad it<br/>
is a rite that is a trial-by-fire.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing more of your comments!<br/>
<br/>
