&gt; LOL!<br/>
&gt;  As an emancipated minor at sixteen I moved from hickville to Portland,<br/>
&gt; OR.  I met a wonderful friend, we hit it off right away and spent every<br/>
&gt; minute together.  It was five<br/>
&gt; days before I realized we were DATING!  Wow!  I won&#39;t say I was a<br/>
&gt; sheltered child but certainly never encountered this in my little world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was that you, Pam?<br/>
&gt; ( what are you doing later? )<br/>
