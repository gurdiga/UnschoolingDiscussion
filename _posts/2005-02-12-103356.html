<div id="ygrps-yiv-406017143">&quot;Crunchy&quot; is shorthand for<br/>

<br/>
You know, the kind of folks you find at Whole Foods buying organic<br/>
produce and wafting patcholi and sandelwood through the aisles . . .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466568710">Here&#39;s a quiz you can take to see how crunchy you are.  You can tell <br/>
by the kind of questions it asks exactly what you must do to call <br/>
yourself &quot;crunchy&quot;. lol  (And it was interesting that homeschooling <br/>
with no curriculum gives you more points than homeschooling with <br/>
curriculum).  <br/>
