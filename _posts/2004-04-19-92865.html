<div id="ygrps-yiv-498886186">&lt;&lt;How involved should I be...?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You should be as involved as he wants you to be.<br/>
<br/>
My ds (10) loves skeet shooting.  I buy ammo and guns, I take him to<br/>
practice, I remind him when a competition is coming up, I remind him to<br/>
clean his gun, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
But I only do it as long as he is happy about it.  If he ever said he didn&#39;t<br/>
want to go to practice, he wouldn&#39;t.  If he got to where he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
go to competitions, I would quit reminding him.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest job of an unschooling parent is to remember that it is the kids&#39;<br/>
sparks, not yours.  You can&#39;t hound them because &quot;they&#39;ll thank me later.&quot;<br/>
On the other hand, you can&#39;t just ignore them and leave them to fend for<br/>
themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139710388">People from the beginning of time have passed down information to <br/>
their children. It doesn&#39;t have to be a lecture, or teaching, and <br/>
certainly not forced. Unschooling is not leaving your children to <br/>
find all the answers on their own. I see myself as my sons helper <br/>
and companion. If he has a question, I ask him what he thinks the <br/>
answer might be, or I help him find the answer. If he is interested <br/>
in something I help him to get all of the information he wants on <br/>
it, we go on field trips,  find resources, we explore, discuss <br/>
things and research together. Often one &quot;spark&quot; will lead to <br/>
another, and the connections made are something that someone in <br/>
school will never have. I wouldn&#39;t worry that your son won&#39;t have <br/>
any interests, that won&#39;t happen. I also wouldn&#39;t worry that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know everything that is taught in public school, he will <br/>
know more about so many things, and really understand them in a way <br/>
that public school kids don&#39;t, if they even remember what was taught <br/>
in the first place. Peace - Tara<br/>

<br/>
I am by no means a seasoned h/un schooler and I&#39;ve had these thoughts too.  I <br/>
see my kids as sponges though, they are sucking up every bit of what they are <br/>
exposed to.  So exposure works for us.  My oldest is 6 and the other is 2.5 <br/>
and they both absorb so much, and I don&#39;t always see it when it happens, <br/>
sometimes it may come later or may come from out of nowhere.  But it comes and <br/>
that&#39;s the point.  Once, when my 6 yr old was 3, DH and I were gabbing away in the <br/>
car and DS was listening to music in the back of the van (speakers on in back, <br/>
not in front) and I said something like, &quot;Thanks Hon, you&#39;re as strong as an <br/>
Ox.&quot;  And from the back comes, &quot;MaMaaaa, you&#39;re speaking metaphorically!&quot;  <br/>
Well, to say the least DH and I both looked at each other and I nearly wrecked <br/>
the van cuz it was so wild to hear my 3 yr old say that.  And we have no idea <br/>
where it came from, we asked and he said I dunno.  But he was right and he still <br/>
knows what it means, he absorbed it for good.  One of my professors used to <br/>
say that by the end of the semester he&#39;ll be glad to send us home so we can <br/>
dump our &quot;disks&quot; and come back fresh next time.  And this is sooooo true, my <br/>
&quot;disk&quot; crashed hard and I remember little about a lot of things from school <br/>
because it was jammed in and memorized for the time being and without meaning, but I <br/>
retained what was of interest to me from those few teachers who didn&#39;t teach <br/>
as much as they shared their knowledge and love of a subject.  Imagine if <br/>
everything could be interesting, if we could stay &quot;easily amused.&quot;  Well, I think <br/>
kids can.  Your son will have sparks and is probably having them now, unless <br/>
he gets up and does nothing but stare at a wall (which he may just love the <br/>
texture, the wallpaper, the tint :0) ) then he already has interests, he does <br/>
stuff, and stuff will become sparks and possibly flames and if he needs you, jump <br/>
in, facilitate and expose.  If he doesn&#39;t then just let him go about it.  I <br/>
have a BSBA with a minor in Biology and so I schooled for a long time but I <br/>
couldn&#39;t give you but one sentence on Columbus right now and that&#39;s not because <br/>
there was never a spark or that it doesn&#39;t interest me, I just flat out didn&#39;t <br/>
NEED it so I didn&#39;t retain it.  My 6 yr old never knew what a president was <br/>
until he started learning about currency and the pictures on the money sparked <br/>
his interest and we got a book about presidents and we read it together and we <br/>
both retained a lot of it by choice, before this, I couldn&#39;t give you a <br/>
sentence on any president either (well at least not fact, but I could do opinion :0) <br/>
)  My 2.5 year old is fascinated with the trash trucks when they come.  They <br/>
have huge mechanical arms that pick up the trash, not like the old ones where <br/>
the guys throw it in the back.  He LOVES these trucks but a fly by down our <br/>
street wasn&#39;t enough, he cranes his neck until it disappears.  So we went to the <br/>
dump one day, and we watched until he had his fill, and we talked about the <br/>
recycling and all that and when we got home later and I asked him to throw <br/>
something away for me, he understood what the different trash was for now.  See <br/>
learning in everything and they will too.  And exposure helps.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry so loooong winded but I get shaky too<br/>

Kinda, but library and field trip should be only two of fifty things you&#39;ll <br/>
eventually consider I hope.<br/>

<br/>
You can tour a car wash just by taking your car to be washed.  <br/>
&quot;To tour&quot; sounds so formal.<br/>
To hang out and watch is doable every day.   <br/>
<br/>
I like to watch the produce guys work at the grocery store.  You don&#39;t have <br/>
to get a tour.  Just stall while you&#39;re there, and watch what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
How about flower shops?  You don&#39;t have to be needing to buy flowers just to <br/>
go in and look around, and you might get to see them arranging or making <br/>
things.   BIG floral seasons coming up, with proms and mothers&#39; day.   Even if you <br/>
don&#39;t think you&#39;re interested, I bet you&#39;d find interesting things.<br/>

Instead of trying to plan your next many years, just live today.  What&#39;s he <br/>
doing right now?   <br/>
<br/>
Learn it by doing it.  Like riding a bike.<br/>

As involved as he wants to get with it. Whenever you see his interest<br/>
waning, it&#39;s time to stop. Or when he says so, that&#39;s a good indication!!<br/>
When he&#39;s finished, it might be done with forever and it might pick back up<br/>
again later. It could be as brief as you explaining something and then again<br/>
could entail field trips, books, movies, etc. It&#39;s all up to him as to how<br/>
much.<br/>

learn about Christopher Columbus in school were pretty much wasted? Or, could <br/>
have been better spent learning something else-therefore, we shouldn&#39;t worry <br/>
about them learning EVERY subject they learn in school? I worry about that <br/>
myself, sometimes, but then I try to remember that not everyone needs every thing <br/>
they had to learn in school for their daily life/career. Its hard-especially <br/>
since homeschooling is &quot;newly&quot; accepted by me, and unschooling even newer!<br/>

LOL mine was, too! Still enjoys watching them. And often, when he is throwing <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the hours were wasted learning about Columbus in that way.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is living life in a rich environment, he can&#39;t *not* hear about<br/>
Columbus. Columbus comes up in kids cartoons all the time! :-) There are<br/>
jokes. Coumbus get&#39;s mentioned in commercials on Columbus Day.<br/>
<br/>
If we look at what&#39;s available in the world and divide it into things they<br/>
like/probably will like now and things they don&#39;t like/probably won&#39;t like<br/>
now -- but their tastes will change and those aren&#39;t fixed categories --<br/>
then the like pile will contain good picture books. Some will be about teddy<br/>
bears and ice cream and spies and mysteries and different kinds of pasta and<br/>
samurai and Columbus and trains and Pokemon. Columbus is just one of many<br/>
things in the world. In real life he isn&#39;t separate from teddy bears. He&#39;s a<br/>
like or not like, part of a joke or not part of a joke, in a TV show or not<br/>
in a TV show.<br/>
<br/>
Do you worry that you&#39;re kids won&#39;t find out about ice cream? Some kids<br/>
actually don&#39;t like ice cream. But they know about and have sampled it.<br/>
<br/>
Same with Columbus. Treat him like ice cream. Or turtles.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll think what they hear about him is interesting or not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What *do* people need? People need what they use. And they learn what they<br/>
need by using it.<br/>
<br/>
They things they don&#39;t use are the things they don&#39;t need.<br/>
<br/>
What most people don&#39;t understand about learning is that you don&#39;t need to<br/>
understand something in order to use it. You learn how to use it by using<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Think about how kids learn English. They have no clue how to use English. In<br/>
fact they don&#39;t even know what English is. But they find bits and pieces of<br/>
English -- and other tools like pointing -- useful to get what they need.<br/>
Saying &quot;ook&quot; gets them milk more efficiently than crying. So, as they use<br/>
&quot;ook&quot; and get feedback -- like Mom saying &quot;Oh, you want some milk?&quot; -- they<br/>
get better at English as a side effect. We don&#39;t need to explain the proper<br/>
rules of English to them before they start using it. English is just there<br/>
and they pick up the parts that look useful for what they want to get. They<br/>
don&#39;t even need to use English properly. But properly comes along as a side<br/>
effect of using English. As they use English they find ways that work better<br/>
to get what they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Learning works that way for math and science and history.<br/>
<br/>
But those -- like English -- aren&#39;t actually things to learn. They&#39;re<br/>
*tools* to help you do something else. But you don&#39;t need to know the right<br/>
way to use a tool to use it. You just use it to get something else. How well<br/>
the tool works gives you feed back on using it better.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter asks how long until Daddy gets home. We use math as a tool to<br/>
figure that out. The point isn&#39;t the math. The point is finding out &quot;how<br/>
long until.&quot; Math is a side effect of wanting to know &quot;how long until.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A hammer is a tool, not the point. The point is to build a bird house. How<br/>
well the nails go in gives us feedback on how to build the house better and,<br/>
as a side effect, how to use a hammer better. But the point is never the<br/>
hammer. It&#39;s always what you&#39;re using the hammer to make.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, they added more detail all the time, but I&#39;d already read about it in <br/>
books and encyclopedias, and that was in ancient days.  Now kids have &quot;Lies My <br/>
Teacher Told Me&quot; kinds of books, and the internet.   And even if they&#39;d told me <br/>
12 times in school (which I&#39;m grateful they didn&#39;t; some years they repeated <br/>
other things I already knew instead), it was still the same low-level, <br/>
dates-and-political details (who paid for it, what his alleged intent was), and <br/>
nothing more detailed than what I might need to answer questions on Jeopardy <br/>
someday.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my most common justification for passing trivia and historical details <br/>
to my kids.  &quot;In case you&#39;re on Jeopardy someday, and they ask you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told them I want a cut, too, if they make big bucks knowing something <br/>
they learned from me.   At LEAST 10 percent.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s true - my kids were interested in what it was all about, just <br/>
from hearing people mention Columbus day. So we checked some books <br/>
out of the library. Then after we read the sugar-coated versions, I <br/>
read some sections from &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot; - what <br/>
followed was a really interesting discussion about how history gets <br/>
to be history, how certain people get venerated enough to have a <br/>
whole day named after them but maybe they aren&#39;t really great people <br/>
or even very nice people, how our cultural mythology gets built, etc. <br/>
Because it was an interesting and engaging discussion over several <br/>
days/weeks, and because the kids initiated it, I&#39;m sure they retained <br/>
a lot more (not to mention a lot more *accurate*) info than I ever <br/>
got in school.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that unschooling has shown me is that our kids live in the <br/>
real world. The things in the real world interest them because <br/>
they&#39;ve never learned to categorize them into things they should know <br/>
or not. Like Joyce said - they&#39;ll know about ice cream and they&#39;ll <br/>
know about Columbus, sooner or later. Sometimes the breadth of what <br/>
they know truly amazes me. I think that there must be something <br/>
freeing about unschooling that allows their brains to make and retain <br/>
connections between things. Perhaps it&#39;s just that they don&#39;t have <br/>
schoolwork to push all those things out of their memory banks. Like <br/>
one day we were talking about Julius Caesar and I mentioned that <br/>
Shakespeare had written a play about him. My son (7) said &quot;Oh yeah, I <br/>
know that. That&#39;s where that &#39;Unleash the dogs of war&#39; quote comes <br/>
from.&quot; The kids hit me with stuff like that all the time. Turns out, <br/>
he remembered the quote from one of the chapter headings <br/>
in &quot;Watership Down&quot;. The stuff that&#39;s meaningful sticks with <br/>
them, and they have this nice, interconnected web inside their head <br/>
with stuff that they learn from everywhere - books, movies, their <br/>
friends, etc. all tied in. And there&#39;s no-one around to tell them <br/>
that some of it isn&#39;t important.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying.  I am way new to this whole thing too but it <br/>
just &quot;feels right&quot;.  I taught for a long time and what better career than that <br/>
to display all you learned prior to?  I didn&#39;t use much of anything I learned <br/>
formally.  I think school was a waste of time then and it&#39;s even worse now.  <br/>
Today it seems that it is based on crowd control, conformity, and undue <br/>
discipline.  I never had a &quot;bad&quot; school life, I was rarely ever picked on, I did <br/>
pretty well, and it was a good social place when we got a minute to socialize.  <br/>
But I can look back now and say I didn&#39;t HATE school but it was a HUGE waste of <br/>
12 years and college wasn&#39;t a whole lot different.  I want that sparkle to <br/>
stay in my kids eyes for as long as it can, hopefully forever.  They&#39;re born <br/>
with it, they are naturally amazed at so many things, thinking and figuring is <br/>
natural, how can anyone say that school can help them keep that love of life and <br/>
learning alive?  I had a million SPARKS as a child, especially during school <br/>
breaks and Summer, but every bit of those sparks were diminished and <br/>
eventually put out by going back to school and being forced to learn stuff that had no <br/>
meaning to me at the time.  But I did well, because I had to, because I was <br/>
drilled to, because I was forced to.  I don&#39;t want that for mine, and I bet you <br/>
don&#39;t either.  That might be why you are exploring this whole &quot;NEW&quot; world.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; LOL mine was, too! Still enjoys watching them. And often, when he is <br/>
throwing <br/>
something away, he will sloooooowly lift it in both hands, with both arms <br/>
locked straight, above his head, and &quot;dump&quot; it into the trashcan!! It is VERY <br/>
<br/>
frustrating when I&#39;m in a hurry, but if I bite my tongue and realise this <br/>
stage <br/>
will not last very long (and how adoreable it really is!) I&#39;ll relax in a few <br/>
<br/>
moments and enjoy it. Homeschooling is HARD! LOL Waaaay more self-control <br/>
than <br/>
I ever imagined needing! :~)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They are wonderful at every stage but infancy and toddlerhood hold a special <br/>
place for me.  I do the same thing, I get in a hurry sometimes and at the cost <br/>
of everyone else, I&#39;m hollering to get out the door or whatever and I am <br/>
learning to take it easier.  Before my son went to Kindergarten this year, we were <br/>
pretty much an unschooling family, I just didn&#39;t know it had a name.  But now <br/>
that he is in K, our lives are hectic and regimented, confining, and <br/>
restricted.  He has chosen to finish this year but is adament about not going back.  <br/>
And I am soooo grateful for that.  I made a mistake of putting him in because I <br/>
lost my nerve and confidence but we are back on track and we look forward to <br/>
June when this is behind us and we can go back to real life, freedom, and self <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Since we are both &quot;Newbies&quot; and have kids close in age, feel free to email me <br/>

----------------<br/>
<br/>
And in all the world there&#39;s nobody who could possibly know what parts of <br/>
their personal web are more important than others  <br/>
<br/>
We saw a HUGE near-dead moth today.  The kids examined it and we decided to <br/>
leave it there.   We saw a hawk.  (We were driving from Chama to Albuquerque.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe neither of my kids will ever think of those moments again.  Maybe one <br/>
will be a vet or biologist because of thoughts following what they saw today.  <br/>
Maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to let it all flow because I&#39;m old ow and I&#39;ve known lots of people <br/>
with very particular specialities.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking about names, because of &quot;Chavez Creek&quot; and I was telling them <br/>
the Spanish &quot;-ez&quot; names are patronymics, like &quot;-son&quot; in English, and we <br/>
talked about other names that are trades names, like Miller, Smith, Jaramillo, <br/>
Borrego.<br/>
<br/>
But about first names, I said they&#39;re harder to say, and we discussed <br/>
Alexander, Marty&#39;s middle name.  We named him after a friend, both the &quot;Martin&quot; and <br/>
the &quot;Alexander&quot; being the real name and SCA name of a special man who died <br/>
years ago but who was close to me and Keith.<br/>
<br/>
I told him I didn&#39;t think until years later that &quot;Sandra&quot; is a form of <br/>
&quot;Alexander.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Isaid other than knowingitwas a really old Greek name with lots of versions <br/>
in European languages.  I said I didn&#39;t know what it meant, maybe it was being <br/>
from Alexandria, or maybe Alexandria was named after a person.  Marty said &quot;I <br/>
think Alexandria was named for Alexander the Great.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
In a big way it doesn&#39;t matter.  I mean, it&#39;s not our job to know or confirm <br/>
or inform people of that.   But it was cool that he had known something <br/>
&quot;important&quot; that I didn&#39;t tell him.<br/>
<br/>
But IS it important?<br/>
Wasn&#39;t it more important that he knew where to turn in Espanola to get to <br/>
Santa Fe, and how to get off on the new bypass around Santa Fe?<br/>
<br/>
Much more important, today.<br/>
