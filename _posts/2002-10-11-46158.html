<div id="ygrps-yiv-1249079669">(We can&#39;t all be cheerleaders or homecoming queens or presidents of student<br/>
councils, I feel like that is so often what is expected.  Some of us just have<br/>
to be readers or writers or artists.<br/>
Has anyone else come to these conclusions?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have come to accept it.  I&#39;ve always know I&#39;m an introvert.  I love having a<br/>
nice conversation with 1 or 2 people.  Get a whole group of people together<br/>
and I start feeling tired really quickly.  This has led me to cut of ties with<br/>
people for months at a time just to get back to myself.  I find I like to<br/>
actually listen to what people are saying and many people talking at once<br/>
limits my ability to focus on (and understand) one person.  I have a friend on<br/>
this list who thrives on lots of people being around.  I think that&#39;s cool<br/>
too.  If everyone was an introvert there&#39;d be less progress.  If everyone was<br/>
an extrovert there&#39;d be chaos.<br/>
