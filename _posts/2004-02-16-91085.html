<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843239498">There are different interpretations of what learning on one&#39;s own <br/>
means. To John Holt, as a forty-something single man, learning to play the cello <br/>
&quot;on his own&quot; meant that is was wholly his own desire, he made his own plan, <br/>
chose his own experiences including mentors and teachers and peers and <br/>
professional retreats.<br/>
<br/>
       But part of what he chose was formal instruction. And he seemed to <br/>
believe it was essential, according to his account in Never Too Late.<br/>
<br/>
       For example, Holt described something very difficult and peculiar <br/>
about the proper thumb position for cellists, apparently a technique no one would <br/>
ever just &quot;invent&quot; sitting around his own bedroom experimenting, and without <br/>
which one is sadly limited. Also, he found it was important to play with and <br/>
learn from all three types of musicians -- those of lesser ability, those of <br/>
comparable ability, and those much better than oneself. <br/>
<br/>
       FWIW, my own floundering about with music-making leads me to accept <br/>
that mastering a musical instrument is both gift and lifelong challenge no <br/>
matter how young or old you are, taught or not, or what methods or experiences you <br/>
might combine. <br/>
<br/>
       I wonder if it&#39;s like those birthday interviews with folks turning <br/>
100, where you really want to believe whatever they say is their secret to long <br/>
life, but in the back of your mind you realize it really doesn&#39;t apply to <br/>
anyone but themselves, and they likely turned 100 IN SPITE OF the cigarettes and <br/>
booze, not because of it! &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>

I read Never Too Late a while ago, but if I remember correctly; Holt also <br/>
used formal instruction in a very casual manner.  He would get to a point where <br/>
he felt that he could go on his own a while.  Then he would just enjoy playing <br/>
by himself and with the groups that he participated in.  Eventually he would <br/>
reach a point where he went back and took some  more lessons to help him <br/>
progress.<br/>

I think this is something we need to consider with our children.  Lessons <br/>
don&#39;t have to be once a week.  Someone can take two or three lessons and then go <br/>
on their own for a while.  When they want to they can take more.<br/>

<br/>
Cello isn&#39;t rock&#39;n&#39;roll guitar, or drums.  There are many different musical <br/>
styles.  Nobody will learn operatic singing without instruction (it&#39;s more like <br/>
ballet than like most other types of music, in that there is a tradition and <br/>
technique specific to that style).  But learning to sing operatically will NOT <br/>
at all in any way help someone be a folksinger, rock or blues singer.  <br/>
<br/>
That thumb position for cellos had to come from somewhere.  And if someone <br/>
might not think it up, he might see it watching cellists in person or on video.<br/>
<br/>
Paul McCartney learned to read and write music years after he was one of the <br/>
most respected musicians in the world.   <br/>
<br/>
Just as with language, you don&#39;t need to know how to read and write it to use <br/>
it well.<br/>

until the student thinks it is and that may be never according to what they want <br/>
to do with their music. That is the hard part for me doing nothing when all <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558355650">I took piano lessons when I was five, and then quit when I was six.  I still <br/>
have my report card, so I could tell you the date of every lesson. &lt;g&gt;   It <br/>
was a year or so (I don&#39;t want to go find it).<br/>
<br/>
When I was ten I joined band at school so I could get out of class.  I played <br/>
clarinet because I had NO idea what my choices were when they asked us to say <br/>
what instrument we wanted, so I copied &quot;clarinet&quot; off my friend&#39;s paper.  <br/>
Turns out that whole back row copied.  They had never shown us instruments or <br/>
told us what all our options were, and I ran with a whole large crowd of <br/>
firstborns with no older siblings to copy.<br/>
<br/>
The two instruments I play now are guitar and recorder.  I play recorder <br/>
better than I play guitar, but I learned recorder on my own, then took a year of <br/>
lessons at the university to learn Baroque technique (to do sonata-stuff, which <br/>
isn&#39;t all that fun for me).  But I had already been in a Renaissance group <br/>
before that, and so it didn&#39;t propel me along except along a particular route.   <br/>
 The teacher insisted on a thumbrest.  I used it when he was looking and took <br/>
it off when he wasn&#39;t.  It was irritating, but he was a clarinet professor <br/>
and believed thumbrests were essential.  They&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
Guitar, I had one lesson and learned more by messing with it, watching other <br/>
guitarists who were doing fingerpicking, and asking questions.  My mom played <br/>
guitar, but with a flatpick, and I wanted to learn fingerpicking, so I did.  I <br/>
use it to accompany singing, and that&#39;s all.  I don&#39;t do guitar for guitar&#39;s <br/>
sake.  So I&#39;m not &quot;a guitarist.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can read music, but I don&#39;t for guitar.  I don&#39;t even think notation when <br/>
I&#39;m playing guitar, nor note names.  Chord names, yes, but if I do a run or an <br/>
ornament, I don&#39;t think of what part of the chord that is, I just do it by ear.<br/>
<br/>
Piano, I can do by written music or by ear, but there&#39;s a kind of <br/>
disconnection in my head, like I use a different part of my body, kind of.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of any nation&#39;s folk music, people learned it by being around <br/>
others who played, and picking things up very gradually.   In many times and <br/>
places, instruments were made by hand (still in many places) in traditional ways, <br/>
and they don&#39;t come from professional instrument makers or factories.  Banjos <br/>
started off in lots of folk ways before some manufacturers started creating <br/>
specific banjo designs that they could mass produce.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had friends who made ceramic dumbeks, throwing the clay and then <br/>
stretching goat skin on it, getting good enough to sell them.<br/>
<br/>
An English professor I knew wanted to learn to make violins, so apprenticed <br/>
to a violin maker in his &quot;after school&quot; hours.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think of music as a big curriculum/assembly-line where you have to <br/>
enter at the kindergarten door and come out a graduate.  It&#39;s not that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-714022091">AND...<br/>
For some reason I keep forgetting to tell this story. I forgot at the <br/>
conference in South Carolina.  I forgot in the e-mail just before this!<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian&#39;s middle daughter, Roxana, plays piano.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to see the very-beginner books on their piano, the first time I went <br/>
over.  I&#39;d go there every year or so, sometimes more, sometimes less, and there <br/>
would be a more advanced book, and there started being easy Andrew Lloyd <br/>
Weber things, because that was Roxana&#39;s passion for a while (might still be), and <br/>
once Pam said she was tired of hearing the same ALWeber stuff.  So the next <br/>
time I went there, I took a Clementi book  (Six Sonatinas) and gave it to Roxana <br/>
as a gift.  I was thinking she might just never have tried that kind of easy <br/>
Baroque stuff, which sounds complex but isn&#39;t very hard, really.  And the <br/>
by-product if she liked it was Pam could hear something new.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana sat down and started playing them.  Not full speed, of course, but <br/>
both hands, and clearly she was reading them well and easily and would only have <br/>
needed some practice to get them going as fast as she wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Pam &quot;How long has she taken lessons?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She&#39;s never taken lessons.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised; I&#39;d never asked.  She had certainly learned, though, to read <br/>
music, and she was sight-reading which lots of people fail ever to do.  They <br/>
will &quot;practice&quot; and pick things out phrase by phrase (like reading <br/>
phonetically without expectation of comprehension), but they won&#39;t just read a whole page <br/>
of music to see what it sounds like.  Roxana could do that.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t dismiss it for requiring a teacher.<br/>
I&#39;m saying the techniques don&#39;t transfer to blues or folk singing, which have <br/>
their OWN traditions, and which do things purposely which (specifically) <br/>
operatic teachers will swear will damage your vocal chords, or are just *wrong.*  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s wrong for opera is not wrong for everything.<br/>
<br/>
Classical guitar teachers will show you exactly how to sit and how to hold a <br/>
guitar.  You MUST have a stand to put your foot on or &quot;it&quot; won&#39;t work.   &quot;IT&quot; <br/>
in that case cannot possibly be &quot;playing a guitar.&quot;  It is &quot;playing the guitar <br/>
the way classical guitarists have come to sit to play a guitar.&quot;  Flamenco <br/>
guitarists who do have a closer relationship to classical guitarists than, say, <br/>
Johnny Cash or Jon Bon Jovi, sit to play, but they don&#39;t sit one particular <br/>
way.  They seem lots of times to be moving their feet around while they play, <br/>
shifting their bodies, getting almost EXCITED (in comparison).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I want to sing folk music I will still<br/>
<br/>
need to study folk music--&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Study&quot; is too strong a word for something that really involves doing first <br/>
and analyzing later. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And why re-invent the wheel?  If I want to sing opera, I should study opera,<br/>
<br/>
not re-invent operatic singing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True.  And ballet needs serious ballet-everything.  Abusive teachers, ankle <br/>
damage...<br/>
<br/>
If people choose a tradition which doesn&#39;t exist outside of a curriculum and <br/>
teachers, then there they are.  That&#39;s one problem with discussing music or <br/>
dance or theatre, is the hundreds of years of formal tradition that goes with <br/>
some of the styles within those.   Some are loose and some aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
But just as with regular public school teachers, some of the teachers have <br/>
not ever seen anyone learn it without the whole rigamarole of years of <br/>
instruction and hour a day practice and checkmarks on pages and going through someone <br/>
or other&#39;s course of study (Thompson Piano, add Bach after book 3, add Bartok <br/>
after book 4, etc, whatever all).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a &quot;How to Play the Cello&quot; video that gives basic instruction <br/>
and some exercises. It cost $20 and is excellent if you want just the <br/>
basics and want to work on them when you feel like it and at your own <br/>
pace.<br/>
<br/>
I played cello up until high school - didn&#39;t touch it again until a few <br/>
years ago. I still just dabble -play around with it when I feel like <br/>
it. I have fun, but don&#39;t work at it and my skills are FAR below what <br/>
they were when I left off as a teenager.<br/>
<br/>
My 13 plays around with it too - and is learning slowly, but surely, <br/>
mostly on her own, with a few pointers from me when she asks for them. <br/>
She watched the video when we first got it and it helped her with how <br/>
to hold the bow and how to position her fingers.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember how she learned to read music - all three of my kids <br/>
just do and I&#39;m not sure how they picked it up. They learned to read <br/>
music just like they learned to read English - they were surrounded by <br/>
a music-rich environment, encouraged to enjoy it, to play around with <br/>
it, and their questions were answered and they were supported when they <br/>
showed an interest. The older two have had some music lessons - just a <br/>
few here and there over the years - nothing they stuck to for more than <br/>
a few sessions, but that gave them some basis for learning, I think. I <br/>
don&#39;t think that they could have spent years just passing by all the <br/>
music that is always sitting out on the piano and on the electronic <br/>
keyboard in our living room without learning how it worked. Rosie is 13 <br/>
and has never had any music lessons of any kind, but can read music <br/>
enough to play the melody line of songs on the piano and is starting to <br/>
put some left hand with it and is learning to play the cello.<br/>
<br/>
I ask myself, &quot;What is the point of music lessons?&quot; &quot;Why do parents <br/>
want kids to play musical instruments, why do they think it is <br/>
important and are willing to spend money on it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The only answer I can come up with that makes sense for my family is <br/>
&quot;to enjoy music.&quot; So that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing - right now. They don&#39;t <br/>
have to &quot;take lessons&quot; and be forced to &quot;practice&quot; now in order to <br/>
enjoy it later.<br/>

<br/>
Used to be because the only music there was going to be was what people made <br/>
themselves.  Secondarily, it was considered a religious duty to develop <br/>
musical talent if one had it, to use in worshiping God.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have the leftovers of the strong tradition which doesn&#39;t have the <br/>
first purpose since the invention of the Victrola, and the second which doesn&#39;t <br/>
apply to everyone, not even all Christians or all obviously-musically-talented <br/>
people.  But that&#39;s why it was pushed so hard in the 19th century.   Plus it <br/>
showed breeding and culture.  It&#39;s what rich families did, so poorer families <br/>
wanted it too.<br/>

I was in a hoity-toity voice session at a Renaissance music workshop one <br/>
summer at Taos Ski Valley, run by some of music department of New York City <br/>
College or someplace (it was a long time ago) and I was in a French chanson session, <br/>
doing fine until the teacher asked me to do something one-on-one with <br/>
someone, which I could do---I could read music, I could pronounce the French fine, I <br/>
was fine--and then she said &quot;You sound like a folksinger.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said it in a way intended to cut me to the quick and inspire me to &quot;do it <br/>
right.&quot;  And I know what I did that tipped her off, and I could have <br/>
prevented it had I been trying to impress her and get a scholarship to the college <br/>
where she taught or something [*snort*] but I was just there to play recorder, <br/>
and did the other stuff because it was a vocal-session time and I like two-part <br/>
stuff a lot.  This was kind of the French equivalent of Thomas Morley <br/>
canzonets.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t insulted.  I WAS a folksinger.  And they were lucky to have me in <br/>
their little session.  Most of the people there were older, wealthy geeks with <br/>
nothing to converse about at meals and when the final party came, I got out my <br/>
guitar and sang ballads and a couple of the teachers seemed dumbfoundedly <br/>
amazed.  Something cool, interesting to people, entertaining, and they had never <br/>
studied it (nor even ever heard of it).<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, it wouldn&#39;t have been advantageous to me to learn her way at the <br/>
cost of what I was already doing.   If I were to do a serious French-chanson <br/>
thing I could remind myself to sing the one way instead of the other.  It has to <br/>
do with how to move from one note to another, in an indirect fashion (aim <br/>
higher and settle on it) instead of sometimes a direct fashion which causes a <br/>
little voice break.  Hard to describe, but it&#39;s a throat and head-position and <br/>
brain thing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yes.  Writing them down killed the tradition, pretty much.<br/>
There came to be &quot;the right way&quot; (what the collector had cleaned up and <br/>
published) and &quot;the wrong way&quot; (what still existed out in the real world).<br/>
<br/>
With folk music, you get the double problem.  Some thing still exist because <br/>
they were recorded in the 1920s and so weren&#39;t lost, but they exist mostly in <br/>
versions of that one recording, which is both natural and somewhat unnatural.  <br/>
 And 78 rpm records were limited to just a few minutes (five?  I don&#39;t know <br/>
how long at max, anyone know?) and so some kinds of songs weren&#39;t preserved <br/>
that way and some were shortened to fit.<br/>

Nevermind that folksinging involves centuries of tradition and &#39;training&#39; from birth at times. They understand that the music and words are passed on but don&#39;t think that inflections and tones and harmonies and techniques are passed on as well? So it&#39;s not formal training. The conflict I mentioned between classically trained fiddlers and the traditional ones is a recognition, I think, that traditional is not untrained but carries a definate sound and intent of its own instead of traditional being some sort of void that has to be filled or better, a rough spot that needs polishing.<br/>
