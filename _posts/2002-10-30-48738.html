&gt; That&#39;s what I was wondering,somebody mentioned getting books from the<br/>
&gt; library to read about certain things,but I would have assumed doing any<br/>
&gt; type of research was not unschooling,I guess I have a lot to learn.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is about following your interests on your own timetable with<br/>
your own motivation at your own will to continue or stop at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are interested in unschooling your children, of course you would<br/>
research. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve heard about unschooling and unschoolers,<br/>
but I think some people or publications have been misleading you about what<br/>
we are and do.<br/>
<br/>
Have you been to the unschooling.com message boards yet? Those will be of<br/>
much more use to you than reading this list at present, if your time is<br/>
limited for reading right now.<br/>

Don&#39;t treat them like third graders, or objects or subjects.<br/>
<br/>
If you had a grown friend, or a sister, or a neighbor, who wanted information <br/>
on raised bed gardening, would you consider getting books from the library to <br/>
help her?  Would you consider going on the internet and printing something <br/>
out for her?   (I would, if it were my friend asking about something I <br/>
couldn&#39;t just recite or diagram by myself right then and there.)<br/>
<br/>
Helping them with resources is a real-world skill. <br/>
<br/>
Requiring your children to go to the library and check out books on <br/>
raised-bed gardening would NOT be natural.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t drive my neighbor or friend to the library, show them how to use <br/>
the search files, and then say &quot;You go and get those books, while I sit here <br/>
and read magazines.  And I want them read within two weeks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m partly just rambling, but I&#39;m hoping I&#39;m triggering some thought process <br/>
or  mindset which you need to undo to see unschooling clearly.<br/>

Hi!I&#39;m definitely getting this unschooling thing as I read more posts.I really believe if we have gone to an actual school in our lives,then we are brainwashed & programmed to think only one way.I never thought outside of the box & so all these posts are quite interesting.I have definitely had a learning experience I would have never conceived of had I not found the unschooling book at the library.I definitely had a different idea of what unschooling was & from all that i have read from these posts,it makes total sense to me now.I definitely know learning is happening all the time,regardless of whether you think it is or not,I just always believed the proof of learning was to see it written but that&#39;s not true.My middle daughter(now 6) was reading a book to her sisters  & i & started reading these big words i never taught her & all i could think was wow,how on earth did she learn that since i didn&#39;ts it down & teach her those words so she must have learned it just by listening to our conversations or something.She even talks using big words i haven&#39;t taught her,so i do believe there is learning going on all the time.i&#39;m really glad i found this board b/c i now see things clearly & not the way most people &quot;think&quot; kids should be taught.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I think it&#39;s really true that school brainwashes us to think that<br/>
there is one right way to learn and one right set of subjects.<br/>
<br/>
Annoyingly, once the ideas of unschooling make sense to you, you will<br/>
still have relatives who have their heads still stuck in the<br/>
brainwashing box.<br/>
<br/>
You can count on it!  So save the best explanations here and recycle<br/>
them and use them to convince other people later.<br/>
