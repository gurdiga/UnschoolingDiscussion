 <br/>
MAYOR TELLS TEACHERS TO CHANGE TUNE<br/>
<br/>
Yasuura, Hiroshima -- In a scathing letter lashing out at teachers in <br/>
this town&#39;s elementary and junior high schools, the mayor has demanded <br/>
that they quit their jobs if they fail to enforce a law requiring them <br/>
and their pupils to sing the national anthem, the Mainichi has learned. <br/>
<br/>
Mayor Norihiko Okita, 54, mailed copies of the letter to some 90 faculty <br/>
members at seven municipal elementary and junior high schools, calling on <br/>
them to &quot;resign if you cannot abide by the Constitution and the laws.&quot;<br/>
