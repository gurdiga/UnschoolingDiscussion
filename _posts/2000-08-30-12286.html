<div id="ygrps-yiv-199197235">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share our recent interest catalyst.  Yes it was... THE TV.<br/>
(g)  <br/>
<br/>
Alex (6) surprised me at breakfast the other day by asking me about the<br/>
story of Macbeth. Through our ensuing conversation, I learned that there<br/>
had been something on Arthur about Macbeth.  Also, this week, the movie<br/>
of choice in the house has been Hercules (Disney).  This was being<br/>
requested 2 times a day!  Well, it does have great music and some pretty<br/>
funny dialog, so I was roped in each viewing.  This led to some of the<br/>
following questions from Alex:  Who was Odysseus, who was Pandora (of The<br/>
Box fame), what was the Trojan Horse, what is Cerebus.  We looked in the<br/>
encyclopedia for some answers and also got books from the library.  There<br/>
are some great books for kids about what you would consider &quot;adult<br/>
stuff&quot;.  Alex has been reading (or read to) about the adventures of<br/>
Odysseus, the Trojan War, and Greek Mythology.  We also got a kick out of<br/>
learning the 12 labors of Hercules and then noticing what was made<br/>
mention of in the movie.  Also, we got a great book called the Tales of<br/>
Shakespeare, which has some of the plays in a sort of comic book lay out.<br/>
 Very cool.  Yesterday we read Macbeth and Romeo & Juliet.  Alex really<br/>
liked all the fighting and mayhem.  I wanted to cry at the end of R & J.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this was so long, I just thought it was all way too cool.<br/>
<br/>
