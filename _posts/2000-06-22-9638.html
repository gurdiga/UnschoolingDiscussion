&gt;<br/>
&gt; Need some input... I went to my library this morning and talked to the Branch<br/>
&gt; Manager who was wonderful..  I told her there were no books on unschooling<br/>
&gt; and 7 on homeschooling and she asked me if I could suggest some. She said<br/>
&gt; they had plenty of money in their budget for those books.  I quickly whipped<br/>
&gt; out my copy of The Unschooling Handbook and she ordered it from Amazon.com as<br/>
&gt; we were talking.  She asked me if there were anymore I could recommend.  I<br/>
&gt; could only think of the Colfax&#39;s book and didn&#39;t know if that was unschooling<br/>
&gt; or homeschooling.  Anyway she ordered that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I told her about the unschooling loop and she asked me to ask you for<br/>
&gt; recommendations of unschooling books.  She is more than willing to buy<br/>
&gt; several more books if I can give her the names and authors...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nancy Wallace&#39;s &quot;Child&#39;s Work: Taking Children&#39;s Choices Seriously&quot; is my<br/>
favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Also, John Taylor Gatto&#39;s &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Linda Dobson&#39;s &quot;The Art of Education&quot;,<br/>
<br/>
and, if I&#39;ll be so bold, my own (as below).<br/>
