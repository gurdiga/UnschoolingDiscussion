&lt;&lt; I have also been having good luck lately with talking about the 3 steps<br/>
<br/>
to solving a problem (I got this from Sandra). First option is to talk with <br/>
the other person.<br/>
<br/>
If that does not work, second option is to find me or another adult. If that <br/>
does not work<br/>
<br/>
then you can hit. So when he starts hitting, I ask him what he tried <br/>
first...usually he<br/>
<br/>
did ask Kyle to stop doing something so I can ask him what he should have <br/>
tried next. And<br/>
<br/>
that is the step he usually skips. ;o) But it gives us a good framework to <br/>
talk about<br/>
<br/>
how he had other options then hitting. I think that often at 6 he can&#39;t see <br/>
the other<br/>
<br/>
options so this helps remind him and helps us talk about them. Not a cure <br/>
all, but it is<br/>
<br/>
getting better. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When the boys were little and I was trying to figure out how to say &quot;Yes&quot; a <br/>
lot and not no, I came up with that once when Kirby said he REALLY wanted to <br/>
hit Marty.  Somehow it came around to &quot;when can I hit him?&quot;  I said You can <br/>
hit him (which was the answer Kirby REALLY wanted!) IF first you try to talk <br/>
to him and if that doesn&#39;t work you get a grownup to try to help you settle <br/>
it, and if THAT doesn&#39;t work, then  you can hit him.<br/>
<br/>
So if he hit Marty (or the other way) the main offense was that they didn&#39;t <br/>
follow procedure.<br/>
<br/>
Just as I had suspected, they never got past the grownup-assistance stage, so <br/>
the stage three never materialized.  But I suppose the boys sometimes had <br/>
hope that it would.<br/>
