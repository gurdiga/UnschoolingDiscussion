<div id="ygrps-yiv-833259634">I have been slowly trying to move toward saying &quot;yes&quot; more often when DD says she&#39;s hungry and asks for foods.  I have tried to quit saying &quot;after you eat dinner&quot; for sweets requests, offered suggestions or given her things to snack on while waiting for dinner, and have in general changed a lot of how we&#39;ve dealt with food.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, as I was preparing dinner, DD started to head toward the fridge.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;I&#39;m hungry.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m making dinner.  It&#39;ll be done in about 10 minutes, can&#39;t  you wait?&quot;  I replied (getting slightly annoyed).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But I&#39;m hungry now,&quot; she said, starting to whine.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m starting to think that this is crazy and wondering why she can&#39;t just wait 10 or 15 more minutes, yada yada yada...  Then, I stop.  Maybe she is hungry, maybe her stomach hurts a little, maybe it won&#39;t hurt if she does eat something first...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was going to save the pineapple for dinner, but if you&#39;d like you can have it now,&quot;  I offered.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll take that!&quot;  She says, ecstatic because she loves pineapple.<br/>
<br/>
Wow... that was easy.  She ate her pineapple, I finished making the chicken nuggets and green beans (which were her requests too), and we ate our dinner - peacefully.  <br/>
<br/>
The big thing that I realized this morning is that she never asked for dessert.  That used to be her whole concern - even from waking up in the morning.  She would ask &quot;What are we having for dinner?  What&#39;s for dessert?&quot;  Now, if she wants some, she eats it.  And, I am doing the same.  Sometimes I will want something when she does, other times I won&#39;t - so I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Later on, we were working on a computer game that we&#39;d gotten from the library.  It was particularly challenging, and we&#39;d switch off and on taking turns trying to figure it out.  At one point, while it was my turn, I heard her munching on something.  I didn&#39;t say a word.  She had grabbed the bag of chips and had eaten 2 or 3 - then was off and wanting her turn.  <br/>
<br/>
She had also gotten out the remainder of some carrot cake we had bought (her newly discovered favorite and my long-time weakness...) and 2 forks.  I suggested I make some coffee, and she was so excited.  We shared the remainder, and she actually stopped at some point.  I am the one who finished, and consequently had to admit, &quot;I ate wayyyy too much!  I feel full & extremely sugared!&quot;  She giggled and said, &quot;I&#39;m not!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was nice and amazing.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t it though? We often do &quot;courses&quot; of a sort (similar to what <br/>
you did with the pineapple) - maybe set out some crisp veggies/salad <br/>
or slices of cheese or something (that coordinates with the meal) <br/>
and DS will munch on that for the last few minutes while dinner is <br/>
finishing up. Often (because we love chili and fajitas and stuff) <br/>
I&#39;ll be grating cheese and DS will wander through and ask for a <br/>
slice or grab a small &quot;squeeze&quot; of the shredded stuff. Or, he&#39;ll <br/>
grab a few slices of bell pepper while DH is slicing them up for <br/>
fajitas. Whatever. It&#39;s so much easier and calmer and all to not <br/>
have to fuss over 5 or 10 minutes. On Sunday we went to a restaurant <br/>
and DS ate a salad, a bowl of spinach artichoke dip and a bowl of <br/>
mac & cheese and decided that he was full enough and skipped dessert <br/>
(DH and I also skipped dessert). We double checked in case we <br/>
misunderstood because he loves the worms/dirt pudding dessert they <br/>
have at this place and he said yeah he was full and ready to leave. <br/>
He&#39;s so much less likely to get himself over full than we are and <br/>
we&#39;re slowly (re)learning to eat that way too.</div>
