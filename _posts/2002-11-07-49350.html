The San Antonio Express-News had a big article about the &quot;to do Halloween or<br/>
not do Halloween&quot; rift in the Christian community.  One of the local<br/>
Christian book stores was selling Halloween packets with good success.  The<br/>
packets were religious tracts to be handed out to trick or treaters.  I<br/>

 </span></blockquote> My kids came home with a bunch of those in their Halloween <br/>
candy. The tracts talked about when else do you get children on <br/>
your doorstep you can talk to about Jesus. Can you imagine the <br/>
fuss if Stanists or Witches did the same thing!<br/>
