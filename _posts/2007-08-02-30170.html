<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089296713">Just now, moments ago by instant message, a discussion with a  <br/>
childless, male 35-year-old friend turned to the importance of words,  <br/>
and breathing, and some of this might help the mom with the daycare,  <br/>
and other situations I don&#39;t even know about in some lives of other  <br/>
readers probably:<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
Me:<br/>
If I were still young enough that the focus of my life was making  <br/>
friends and seeing and being seen, it wouldn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
Things really change with age, though. I&#39;m through that phase of  <br/>
defining myself by others&#39; positive regard.<br/>
<br/>
The friend:<br/>
Happiness comes from within.<br/>
There&#39;s been some really interesting stuff about that that people  <br/>
have posted when I&#39;ve done some myspace blogging<br/>
<br/>
Me:<br/>
Happiness doesn&#39;t come from within for a 13 year old.<br/>
Nor for a two year old.<br/>
But human development phases seem real and true, in my experience,  <br/>
and they don&#39;t end at 21.<br/>
<br/>
The friend:<br/>
True. Eventually you have to stop being a child.<br/>
<br/>
Me:<br/>
Not really.<br/>
Some people get stuck in a phase and live there forever.<br/>
If one wants to find happiness from within, THEN they will discover a  <br/>
need to stop being a child.<br/>
&quot;have to&quot; is too strong a term. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The friend:<br/>
If you want to function, well, in modern society. I guess.<br/>
I&#39;m working on breaking out of that mode now, and I&#39;ll be 35 on  <br/>
Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Me:<br/>
I bet you can ease out and not have to break out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Keep some of the childish wonder and joy. Don&#39;t artificially turn  <br/>
your back on the good parts.<br/>
<br/>
The friend:<br/>
Easing out, breaking out. Careless use of words. there&#39;s an initial  <br/>
breaking, when I realised how much I knew was true and right wasn&#39;t,  <br/>
and then easing past and round some corners<br/>
<br/>
Me:<br/>
I think it&#39;s more than careless use of words. When you say &quot;break  <br/>
out&quot; it indicates that you feel trapped or bound or that there&#39;s a wall.<br/>
I would like to propose that careful use of words will lead to more  <br/>
clarity of thought which will help you ease toward being the way you  <br/>
feel more comfortable being.<br/>
Stronger and more confident, if you&#39;re using words you really mean to  <br/>
use, to share thoughts you consciously thought.<br/>
<br/>
The friend:<br/>
I guess. I do tend to feel trapped by some of this stuff. It&#39;s a  <br/>
struggle. Seeing things as they are RIGHT NOW and not looking at what  <br/>
that&#39;ll mean to me in 5 years (ONLY) or what that&#39;ll make Tom, Dick,  <br/>
or Harry think.<br/>
<br/>
Me (to the end):<br/>
It&#39;s not easy and our culture makes it even harder.<br/>
When people hear &quot;stop and smell the roses&quot; they think of thorns, and  <br/>
ownership, and the cost of the roses, and whether they require more  <br/>
water than xeriscaping would.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why deep breathing helps. It makes brains slow down.<br/>
Although it&#39;s usually dolled up as formal meditation or chanting or  <br/>
yoga (which has other benefits, certainly, but for my current  <br/>
argument, the breathing...)...<br/>
what it immediately does is slow the heart which stills the brain.<br/>
And then thoughts can step gently and slowly around, instead of  <br/>
trying to jump on the speeding train of brains going the speed of  <br/>
people who are thinking of cost and future and past and promotion and  <br/>
danger and they&#39;re breathing fast, fast, fast.<br/>
And shallow, shallow, shallow.<br/>
<br/>
Deep breaths change everything, for a few moments.<br/>
I&#39;m going to lift that, what I wrote above, and save it.<br/>
I never wrote it so clearly before.<br/>
<br/>
======================================================<br/>
Shallow breathing maintains a state.  If  you&#39;re angry or afraid and  <br/>
you breathe shallowly, you stay that way.<br/>
If you&#39;re calm (as in a meditative state) then breathing shallowly  <br/>
maintains it, once you&#39;ve gotten there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... I thought it might be worth bringing it here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-867691261">I for one, appreciate many little tidbits that are thrown out there <br/>
without a necessary purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just getting to the point in my life where I can begin to learn <br/>
about the power of breathing, as well as the power of being sensitive <br/>
to our bodies in general.  It&#39;s taken me, like, 42 years to get <br/>
there???  I think that by learning that myself, perhaps my kids will <br/>
recognize it sooner (maybe not, but that&#39;s okay), and be better able <br/>
to stay in tune with their own needs.<br/>
<br/>
Little things and images stick and can become a mantra of sorts (or <br/>
something you post on the kitchen cupboard).  A while back you posted <br/>
about the &quot;soft meadow of yeses,&quot; and on some days I will wonder to <br/>
myself, how soft is our meadow today?  <br/>
