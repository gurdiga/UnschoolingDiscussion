 </span></blockquote>Anne posts/sends only those offers made by the sites themselves directly <br/>
to her and her members - there are a lot of &#39;not quite legit&#39; sites out <br/>
there - but hers is 100% legal (her husband is a police detective and she <br/>
is quite moral).  She is a registered affiliate of most of the sites she <br/>
has codes for (Mother Nature, Planet Rx, Amazon, Border, Barnes & Noble, <br/>
Petsmart, Vitamins.com - and so on).  In fact - for many of them, she has <br/>
been an affiliate for so long that she gets offers not available <br/>
elsewhere.<br/>
Hope this eases your mind!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713206803">Hi,<br/>
The fastest and most earger way for the kids to learn about percetiles is when<br/>
they started investing money in stocks.  Here they have a chance to see the<br/>
 activity of the market. They love to see how much they made sometimes<br/>
on a daily basis.  Or they watch a stock for a while and do their calculations<br/>
before they trade.  If you want, this can be done without real money  in the<br/>
internet (for free) or they can have  their own account with online access to<br/>
trade daily if they have the minimum required if not you have your own account<br/>
with your minimum and the kids can watch your shares activity.  <br/>
<br/>
For the younger ones,  percentile is always challenging for them to take up<br/>
when it is their ownership at stake, like dividing the candies with sibling<br/>
something of that nature.<br/>
