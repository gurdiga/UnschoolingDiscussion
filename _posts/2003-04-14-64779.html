&lt;&lt;   Can you buy really large stretched <br/>
 canvas in art stores or is it more cost effective to make your own? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
DEFINITELY cheaper to make your own.<br/>
You can buy canvas in rolls. The frames are simple, better if you have a <br/>
compouns miter saw to cut angles with, but not necessary.<br/>
Actually, you wouldn&#39;t even have to make a frame for it with that type of <br/>
art, you could buy a large roll, hang it against a wall or something <br/>
supportive while they catapault it and hang it from a wall in your house.<br/>
OR use it as a floor covering.<br/>
Cover it with Gesso before they splatter it, let it dry really good. Then <br/>
after the paint splatters (Oh, and use a permanent type of paint. Acrylic <br/>
would be best) seal it with a clear top coat and it should be fine for a long <br/>
time!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
