<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007976304">--- I always just share with others the fun things I see my kids do <br/>
and I do not necessarily tell people that my kids are unschooling (I <br/>
don&#39;t always want to deal with the blank looks!). I just talk about <br/>
the things the kids have done/are doing, the fun they are having or <br/>
the grains of real education they have gleaned and learned on their <br/>
own and I do not worry about alienating others.<br/>
<br/>
If you are teaching in a Waldorf school then these others should know <br/>
that they are &quot;different&quot; from the norm, too. I think we need to be <br/>
ourselves in discussing what happens in our homes and unapologetic <br/>
about what we do. If we believe in what we are doing, then who&#39;s <br/>
business is it as to how we get there? I am not trying to be rude-I am <br/>
just stating things how I see them.<br/>
