<div id="ygrps-yiv-850947778">Went to the European LLL conference weekend before last, <br/>
where Kathy Dettwyler did her &#39;Beauty and the Breast&#39; talk.  V <br/>
interesting.  It was very moving, at the end, as one woman came <br/>
forward and told us she&#39;d had a mammogram 9 years before, and <br/>
had tried to stop wearing her prosthesis two years ago.  She had <br/>
never known why it was such a big problem for her, but after the <br/>
talk, she did.  The focus in our culture on the breast is amazing!  <br/>
Breast implants were compared to fiit-binding, which was a really <br/>
interesting way to ook at things.  And it&#39;s funny how topics <br/>
converge, but on another list, a vitriolc discussion of religion has <br/>
turned, slowly, to a commentary on repression of women!  How <br/>
bizarre!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-583111521"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So it starts with the parents... As I have seen there are many &gt;parents who are just not involved with their kids and these would be <br/>
&gt;considered &quot;good parents&quot;... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure, we always see the media shaking their heads at these &quot;baby killer teens&quot; and saying &quot;tsk tsk.  And they came from such a good family too....such solid upstanding citizens...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;... No bonding with mother or father... But they make lots of money &gt;and isnt&#39; that more important? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It always was in my family.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So it&#39;s not surprising when at 15 years old they end up pregnant... &gt;Because of their real disconnection with anything outside <br/>
&gt;themselves, it&#39;s easy to see how it&#39;s very easy for them to flush a &gt;baby down the toilet, whether that&#39;s through abortion or actually &gt;having the baby and killing it.  It makes complete logical sense &gt;given their upbringing... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what happened to me when I was 16.  I got pregnant, looking for love.  But contrary to the teens who find their babies disposable, I wanted desperately to keep the baby.  I knew what taking care of a baby was, and I welcomed that work in order to actually have a REAL loving relationship for once in my life.  One that could not be taken away from me.  One that was mine to cherish and keep safe.  <br/>
<br/>
I was wrong.  It could be taken away from me.  My parents forced me (through various methods of coersion and abuse) to have an abortion.  They were more concerned about keeping up appearances.  I mean, what would the neighbors think!?  What would Grandma think, if word got out?!  Meanwhile, while I was in having the operation they forced me into, they were out of town being wined and dined as honored business guests.  I had to take a cab home.  I still grieve over that lost little one when I tuck my children in at night.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896404723">Nanci, the same thing happened to me. My Dad, the good catholic, tried to <br/>
make me have an abortion, but when I packed my bags instead he sent me off <br/>
to a maternity home and I gave the baby up for adoption. He is 22 years old <br/>
now! I do not think of him very often anymore, but recently a boy came into <br/>
my restaurant and I had a very strong feeling that it could be him! Funny, <br/>
this young man looked almost exactly like my Dad when he was that age. He&#39;s <br/>
probably the grandson my Dad has been dreaming of-poor Dad is still hoping <br/>
for an athlete, but none of the grandchildren are into sports.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that was my last email to read, so I really am gonna turn this thing <br/>
off and catch that sunrise.<br/>
