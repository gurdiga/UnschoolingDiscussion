<div id="ygrps-yiv-665209361">We were discussing this on another list not too long ago and while I<br/>
remember the doc (he&#39;s practiced in SF), I couldn&#39;t remember the name.<br/>
Someone on the list was kind enough to get the info.  Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Feingold.  They&#39;re on the web somewhere, the Feingold Association.  My aunt<br/>
used their diet recommendations with my hyperactive cousin, with success.<br/>
And, on an aside, they also are the ones who identified food allergies as<br/>
causing eczema, which has changed my life.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673470950">well, I can&#39;t remember any of the sites...I&#39;ve been to<br/>
plenty as ds is very hyperactive...<br/>
but my kids (5 and 3) are the same way with anything<br/>
sweet. It was easier to stick to feeding them<br/>
healthier when I wasn&#39;t around any family...but alas.<br/>
Grammas and grampas are made for spoiling and giving<br/>
cookies and we are currently living with my mom and<br/>
sisters who like having junk food around the house.<br/>
(not to say that I&#39;m not myself a Pepsi-holic...but<br/>
that&#39;s utterly beside the point.)<br/>
Some things that I have done and have really helped<br/>
are<br/>
<br/>
*feeding ds plenty of protein (I can&#39;t do that no<br/>
wheat thing either...)<br/>
ex: eggs and bacon (we are bacon freaks...just can&#39;t<br/>
get enough of the stuff...)in the morning.<br/>
he did sooo well (hyperactivity wise) when he had an<br/>
egg every morning and lots of peanut butter...<br/>
<br/>
*giving them things that i still treat like sweets<br/>
(just as a reverse psychology thing, though) and that<br/>
they still love like sweets...like arrowroot cookies<br/>
from Wild Oats (health food store) that have molasses<br/>
and honey..etc... in them. they&#39;re small so I can give<br/>
them lots of them..they feel special and I know it<br/>
still isn&#39;t as bad for them as a candy bar. <br/>
<br/>
*I give them &quot;special juice coke&quot; (though at first I<br/>
had to call it &quot;kid coke&quot; or soemthing cuz they didn&#39;t<br/>
like that whole &quot;juice instead of coke&quot; thing..<br/>
I buy juicy juice (no added sugar) concentrate (not<br/>
frozen, in coke-like cans) and mix it with club soda<br/>
or something like that (just carbonated water with no<br/>
sugar...instead of with water) and they get the fizzy<br/>
part and no corn syrup and artificial color<br/>
stuff...wacky straws help.<br/>
<br/>
*peanut butter balls....they have peanut butter, dy<br/>
milk, rice cereal, coconut, and honey... you roll them<br/>
into balls and refrigerate them...they are super<br/>
sweet, but still only good for you stuff in them. they<br/>
go fast though.<br/>
<br/>
I have read lots about all the different things to do<br/>
for &quot;ADD&quot; sorts of stuff...my ds isn&#39;t neccesarily<br/>
&quot;hyper&quot; allll the time...soemtimes he just can&#39;t<br/>
concentrate...I believe that what people (whoever they<br/>
are) have termed &quot;ADD/ADHD&quot; is in fact a medical<br/>
problem and my ex suffered from it alot....pycnogenol<br/>
helped him...but can&#39;t give that to kids...wouldn&#39;t<br/>
think of ritalin... <br/>
so I&#39;ve read alot about diet...Essential Fatty Acids<br/>
help alot if they are abundant in the diet...and<br/>
interestingly raw sugar..in a pure form doesn&#39;t make<br/>
kids hyper...it&#39;s actually a sedative. in some places<br/>
they give kids sugar cane to suck on to calm them. (I<br/>
tried it once) but ARTIFICIAL sweeteners and additives<br/>
are what mess things up. Now, I&#39;m not one to talk as<br/>
my kids learned how to say &quot;&#39;donald&#39;s, mommy, peez?&quot;<br/>
before they learned to say &quot;apple&quot; but I have gone<br/>
thru times where we really stuck to a diet of eating<br/>
even just LESS of the artificial stuff and sweets and<br/>
I noticed a huge difference. Oh! A good book is &quot;meals<br/>
that heal for toddlers&quot;.... or something like that.<br/>
has alot of good info in it about how different foods<br/>
affect kids. <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah. also, I try to give them sweets that seems<br/>
like more than it is. like mini m&ms, mini donuts,<br/>
when we make cookies we make them really small,<br/>
vanilla wafers....etc, etc...<br/>
or I fry bananas in honey to put on thier ice<br/>
cream....<br/>
and put lots and lots of nuts on it. (the nuts have<br/>
efa&#39;s) they are still getting &quot;ice cream&quot; but the<br/>
fruit and nuts almost out weigh it. <br/>
trying to tell them sweets were bad for them and no<br/>
they couldn&#39;t have them just made them try to sneak<br/>
some from gramma.<br/>
<br/>
ALSO, they love sleepytime tea. with lots of honey.<br/>
<br/>
there are also some recipes for homemade fruit rollups<br/>
that you can use fresh fruit and non-artificial<br/>
ingredients in. That is, assuming you have time. :)<br/>
hope some of that is useful. <br/>
