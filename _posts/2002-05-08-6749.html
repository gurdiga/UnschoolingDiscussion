&gt; being of my children, is there any real harm in *structuring* time to<br/>
&gt; play games from the &quot;Family Math&quot; book, do science experiments, watch<br/>
&gt; movies for &quot;history&quot; and &quot;science&quot;, do vocabulary cartoon books and<br/>
&gt; word puzzle books.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see any reason not to create times to invite your kids to play games, <br/>
do science experiments, watch movies or play with puzzle books.<br/>
<br/>
I do all those. So do all unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
But we don&#39;t plan them ahead, on a schedule, with the purpose of covering <br/>
certain material.<br/>
<br/>
We JUST DO THEM for their own sakes and the learning always happens. We can&#39;t <br/>
prevent it.<br/>
<br/>
So - if you can&#39;t trust that leaning will just happen and you feel like you <br/>
want to make certain that specific learning happens on a particular schedule, <br/>
then at least watching movies and doing science experiments is NICER than <br/>
reading a boring textbook and answering stupid questions at the ends of the <br/>
chapters.<br/>
<br/>
It is remotely possible that you&#39;ll start to trust that learning can &quot;just <br/>
happen&quot; out of the activities the kids choose to do and that you don&#39;t need <br/>
to pick certain movies to make sure that they cover certain parts of history <br/>
or plan certain science experiments to make sure they learn particular <br/>
scientific concepts. But it is really that &quot;trust&quot; that makes unschooling <br/>
unschooling - not so much what you and the kids are doing. <br/>
<br/>
If I say, &quot;Hey, Rosie, wanna play some games from the Family Math book?&quot; <br/>
She&#39;ll say, &quot;Sure.&quot; We play them because they&#39;re fun - not to learn some <br/>
particular skill that I&#39;ve decided it is time for her to learn. It is NO <br/>
different than if I say, &quot;Hey Rosie, wanna play FLUX or UNO or whatever....&quot; <br/>
She&#39;ll say, &quot;Sure&quot; if she wants to or &quot;Not now&quot; if she doesn&#39;t or maybe , &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t really LIKE that game, let&#39;s play something else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - here we might have a parent-led activity that comes right out of a math <br/>
book - but it would still be unschooling because of the INTENT. The intent is <br/>
to have a good time. We LIKE lots of the family math games - Rosie and I <br/>
happen to LOVE strategy games.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t probably ASK either of my other daughters if they wanted to play <br/>
those games - they don&#39;t like those kinds of games. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not making Rosie play them in an underhanded attempt to make her learn <br/>
something. I&#39;m TRULY just offering to play a fun game because we both enjoy <br/>
it - the LEARNING happens because learning always happens and we can&#39;t <br/>
prevent it.<br/>

simple experiments. I read them all. Every once in a while something comes up <br/>
and I jump up and have the ability to demonstrate something in a really <br/>
clever way. It is cool. Once in a while the experiments just strike me as so <br/>
cool that I jump up from the computer and grab whichever kid is around and <br/>
say, &quot;HEY  - watch this, it is SO cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a scheduled, pre-decided, course outline for science and I&#39;m not <br/>
using these experiments to make a kid learn particular science concepts that <br/>
I think she should learn. We&#39;re having a cool time doing something fun JUST <br/>
because it is fun and cool and for no other reason. And, lo and behold, <br/>
Learning Always Happens and we just can&#39;t prevent it.<br/>

&gt; what<br/>

because he wanted a certain sound for an opera he was writing.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have to know that - she learned it somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is very likely that I learn way more &quot;information&quot; from Roxana <br/>
than she does from me.<br/>
<br/>
What I give her is my own sense of enthusiasm for interesting stuff, support <br/>
for her interests as being worthwhile and helping her find resources - <br/>
driving her places, noticing when things of interest to her are available.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not REAL interested in science fiction, for example, but she is. I saw a <br/>
notice that Ray Bradbury is speaking in a couple of weeks very near our home. <br/>
So I told her about it and she REALLY wants to go. So I&#39;ll take her.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have to give her &quot;author lessons&quot; - which is what schools do a LOT <br/>
of these days. She got interested in authors because she liked their books -- <br/>
seems sort of, uh, &quot;natural,&quot; doesn&#39;t it?<br/>

understanding unschooling (and it&#39;s been considerable) learning something <br/>
else you&#39;ve always been curious about.  If there isn&#39;t anything right now <br/>
that you&#39;re curious about, spend some time at the library browsing the <br/>
non-fiction shelves.<br/>
Since you like lists, &lt;g&gt; pick at least 2 books from at least 3 different <br/>
sections.  You don&#39;t have to read them.  Take them home and browse through <br/>
them.  Give yourself permission to put them down if they aren&#39;t <br/>
interesting.  See if anything catches your fancy.  Leave them where your <br/>
girls might pick them up and glance at them.  If nothing grabs you or them, <br/>
go back and get some more.  Explore sections you&#39;ve never been interested <br/>
in.  Walk down a row of bookshelves and randomly pick 3 books.  I like to <br/>
do this in the youth section.  A lot of non-fiction concepts are easier to <br/>
understand if you read a kid&#39;s book about them first.<br/>
If you feel the need to schedule activities, why not schedule a time each <br/>
day when you will be available to do whatever they want with them.  Read to <br/>
them or play games or watch movies or do experiments or go for a walk or go <br/>
shopping.  Whatever *they* want to do.  Have a few ideas ready in case they <br/>
can&#39;t think of anything at first.<br/>
Try to think out loud more than you probably do now.  (This is a biggie for <br/>
me - hard to remember.)  At the grocery store, do some of your mental math <br/>
out loud.  (Assuming they&#39;re with you.  Might be embarassing otherwise - grin)<br/>
You&#39;re so close, Pat.  It&#39;s right there under your nose.  %^)  Don&#39;t give <br/>
up now.<br/>

romantics, and, and, and.  A lot of contemporary music sounds to me like it <br/>
was meant to be as ugly as possible, but I do like R. Vaughn Williams, <br/>
Hanson, Shostakovich, and some others.  Our orchestra is doing a premier of <br/>
a work by a New Zealand composer next month.  I forget her name.  It&#39;s <br/>
actually quite nice.<br/>

but the slow movements.  My college boyfriend and I used to stay up all <br/>
night listening to Mahler.  The joy of my life was getting to play in <br/>
Mahler&#39;s sixth symphony.  I had also gotten to play in his first symphony <br/>
at one time, but that was when I discovered that French horns actually have <br/>
strings . . . . . . . and they can break.  %^(<br/>
