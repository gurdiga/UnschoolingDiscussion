&lt;&lt;I&#39;d love to change the world and have it widely accepted... The only way I <br/>
can do that is to live it and when people see by example what&#39;s happening to <br/>
my children, maybe they&#39;ll want to look a little closer and see how they got <br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>
I know and understand the feeling of frustration though...  Keep up your <br/>
belief&#39;s...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  I also acknowledge that I can&#39;t get anywhere *arguing* the <br/>
merits of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What I tend to do is wait for my moment and point out the drawbacks of <br/>
schooling.  I make it sound like a critique of public schooling, and slip it <br/>
past their guard that way.  But I criticize things that also apply to school <br/>
at home.  I try to discuss the quantities of stuff presented and FORGOTTEN in <br/>
public school.  I think that makes a strong case against forced learning.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes ask people whether they studied a foreign language in high school <br/>
and if they still remember it today.  Our brains are pretty good at discarding<br/>
 information that isn&#39;t used.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388253850">One of my favorite tricks when giving homeschooling seminars is to ask how<br/>
many people in the room had chemistry in high school or college. The<br/>
majority of people will raise their hands. Then you present a fairly basic<br/>
chemistry problem and ask how many people would be willing to come up and<br/>
balance this chemical equation. Almost invariably there are no takers. If<br/>
any one does offer, it is usually because they are working in the field or<br/>
have just gone back to college and are taking chemistry courses.<br/>
<br/>
After doing this kind of demo, it is then much easier to make the point that<br/>
much of what you have to learn in school turns out to be unimportant outside<br/>
of school, and that being forced to learn something that you don&#39;t use on a<br/>
regular basis will give the same end result as never learning it in the<br/>
first place.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a good point.  I&#39;ve seen this done at conferences, too, with algebra <br/>
or higher level math and seen the same reaction from the audience.  Thanks <br/>
for bringing this up, Billy, because I&#39;ve been having major doubts about my <br/>
soon to be high school age daughter and all the academics we seem to be <br/>
missing!<br/>
