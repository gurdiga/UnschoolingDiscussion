<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881517123">What I&#39;ve noticed, though, is that with the range of my kids&#39; ages that<br/>
there aren&#39;t a whole lot of toys that *everyone* wants to play with,<br/>
particularly at the same time. And the older kids have more possessions that<br/>
are &quot;theirs.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Kathleen<br/>
 <br/>
********<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not so worried about my kids sharing, like Kathleen said above is true mostly at our house too.<br/>
 <br/>
My problem, if you can call it that, (I&#39;m probably thinking too much about this too soon) is that next April we are going to have another baby, and I am worried about everyone sharing me! This wouldn&#39;t have been a &#39;problem&#39; seven or eight years ago when Jack was two and three, I wouldn&#39;t have even given it much thought. Moly and Jack are 11 and 9 and next spring they will be 12 and a month away from 10. They are active, have their own interests and friends and are still at an age where they depend on me to get them here and there. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not going to be able spread myself around enough. <br/>
 <br/>
I never, EVER expected another child. When Jack was four and we hadn&#39;t had another, both Darin and I went to see different doctors and everyone said the same thing. &#39;Be happy, you have one of each, both healthy... sometimes, for no reason, there is unexplained secondary infertility...&#39; Now we both feel like we are starting a brand new family. I know this is the wrong way to look at it, we are excited. Jack seems to be excited, Moly is ambivalent Darin is excited, I&#39;m all sorts of things, but mostly I&#39;m concerned about Moly and Jack having to share me, my time with them, me shortchanging them... I remember how long it takes to nurse, I remember having to put all sorts of things on hold because certain things just have to come first with a baby. When Moly was two and Jack was a baby Moly was too young to &#39;explain&#39; to and she was still nursing at that time anyway, there was no sharing problem. I just know things are going to be different and honestly, I just don&#39;t know. Like I said at<br/>
 the beginning, this might be more my problem than anyone else&#39;s and I might be obsessing this too much, but I am really worried about this.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t be sad or worried!  It is WONDERFUL!  My children are almost-16,<br/>
14, and 7.  <br/>
<br/>
The older two are best of friends, and the youngest is growing up with<br/>
a much closer relationship to his siblings because we are all<br/>
unschooling.  They take the time to play with him, and they are often<br/>
more patient with him than even I am.<br/>
<br/>
I was told I wouldn&#39;t have any more children after Andrew, and then<br/>
Aaron came along and he is such an awesome little person.  <br/>
<br/>
He has taught the older children things as well, such as patience,<br/>
caring for little ones, etc.  They absolutely LOVE showing him all the<br/>
things they enjoyed when he was little, and it gives them the &quot;excuse&quot;<br/>
to relive their own littleness while enjoying his.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my oldest has her own room in the basement, often she will<br/>
sleep in the littlest&#39;s room on his bunk bed and they will talk until<br/>
3am about HomestarRunner or whatever.  They often go to park days with<br/>
us, and Aaron cheers his sister&#39;s volleyball team.<br/>
<br/>
Buy yourself a baby sling, and a good car seat, and take the wee one<br/>
with you while you take the olders to their activities.  If you are<br/>
nursing, then you only need to grab a diaper and some wipes and you<br/>
are set for any short outing, and away you all go!<br/>

Ditto that.  Nine years between my last two children.  The olders  were 11 <br/>
and 9 when the baby was born.  <br/>
 <br/>
The baby has benefitted so much from hanging with his brothers.  It&#39;s  hard <br/>
when you have 3 any time.  But your baby is going to grow up basically  in a <br/>
house full of adults.  That will make it easier on you as far as the  <br/>
practicalities.  Babies are so portable.  My youngest grew up at the  baseball fields <br/>
while his brothers played...so now he&#39;s the biggest baseball  freak of them all. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Susan, what you said about your oldest and your youngest staying up all  <br/>
night...reminds me of my oldest and youngest, 11 years apart.  They are the  best <br/>
of buds.  They spend their time wrestling, of all things, and now that  Will <br/>
is almost 12 they share music and video games.  It&#39;s a very sweet  relationship.<br/>

***Thank you Susan, I needed a good, sweet story about this. I was laying in bed this am and Jack had come in for a snuggle. I was thinking about how I didn&#39;t want this baby to be the end of Jack doing that. He still climbs in bed a few times a week. Moly just every so often and I miss her doing it. I&#39;m glad for my still time with Jack. And <br/>
I was thinking about how Sandra had said I needed to think happy thoughts, how right she was, and how I wished it was that simple for me. <br/>

*****Thank you both! I really needed to hear things like this. I guess since I had such an adversarial relationship with my sister and brother, I was transferring those feelings onto this pregnancy. I have even thought of going to see someone about the way I am feeling. It has eaten away at me. I tell Darin everything, and I&#39;ve told him nothing about how I feel about this baby. For all he knows I&#39;m just happy and excited, and I am, on one side. Its this other thing that keeps creeping in. Thank you.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that it&#39;s best to keep your thoughts positive. All sibling <br/>
relationships are different. My sister is 16 months older than I am. We are <br/>
very different and never really saw eye to eye while we were growing up <br/>
(we&#39;re close now, even though we live far apart). And my brother is 10-1/2 <br/>
years younger than me. I was so ready to have a close connection with a <br/>
sibling, that I  could hardly wait for him to be born. He was my little <br/>
buddy and we did everything together. He hardly talked before he was 3, <br/>
partially because he didn&#39;t have to... he had 4 &quot;grown ups&quot; in the house to <br/>
attend to his needs! It was really hard on both of us when I went away to <br/>
college at 18 (he was 7), but I know we both treasure those wonderful years <br/>
we had together while he was little.<br/>
<br/>
And I know my mom was a different mom with my brother than she had been <br/>
with my sister and me. She was so much more relaxed because she had been <br/>
through it before and knew most of what to expect. Also, our financial <br/>
situation was better and she had more help and support. She was determined <br/>
to &quot;spoil&quot; her youngest, regardless of how others perceived it. I hope <br/>
you&#39;re able to do the same for your babe :-)<br/>
<br/>
Make it a great day!<br/>

Cause and effect?   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Madelyn intimately knew &quot;every&quot; baseball diamond, soccer field, and <br/>
basketball court in Northwest Washington. <br/>
<br/>
She detests all team sports.  <br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;d been whole-life unschooling at the time, I would&#39;ve made <br/>
sure she wasn&#39;t dragged to all those games. But either way, I think <br/>
she probably still wouldn&#39;t like them. <br/>

<br/>
Even though my children were older and got along pretty well, I <br/>
read &quot;Siblings Without Rivalry&quot; by Adele Faber because it was <br/>
recommended so often on various unschooling lists. It turned out <br/>
that the best thing about the book for me was reading how the <br/>
sibling relationships in our families of origin can affect our <br/>
parenting. I think the last chapter of the book is dedicated to how <br/>
parents who used the ideas in the book had healing experiences with <br/>
siblings/parents/selves. <br/>

whose very glad to have dd14 here to reap the full benefits of <br/>
unschooling. . . .</div>
