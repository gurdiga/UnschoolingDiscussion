&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2478<br/>
&gt;Date: Sun, Oct 13, 2002, 2:17 AM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was recently talking to another homeschooler. I mentioned being on this<br/>
&gt; list again. She was asking me something I couldn&#39;t answer. She said she<br/>
&gt; either was on a list or heard about, not sure which one, about unschoolers<br/>
&gt; that sounded a bit different than what I see here. It was to the degree of<br/>
&gt; if a child wants to write on the walls with crayons, to let them because<br/>
&gt; they obviously have a &#39;need&#39; to do so. She said there was a word for it. I<br/>
&gt; thought maybe radical unschoolers but she said no. Just wondering if anyone<br/>
&gt; is familiar with this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have no problem with my children writing on the wall with crayons. I<br/>
would like to negotiate which wall ;) and maybe tack up a huge sheet of art<br/>
paper there first, but the premise doesn&#39;t bother me. Maybe even without the<br/>
sheet of paper first -- one wall devoted to &quot;crayon mural&quot; wouldn&#39;t phase<br/>
us. If we needed to move, paint is cheap.<br/>
<br/>
She may be thinking of NCP (non-coercive parenting) or TCS (taking children<br/>
seriously) parenting, or she may be thinking of this list right here as I<br/>
can imagine others giving my response in paragraph 1. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do call myself a radical unschooler sometimes, but it has nothing to do<br/>
with crayons on walls, it has to do with a visceral distaste for being<br/>
lumped in with people who insist they are &quot;unschooling except for math!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121280794">That sounds like Taking Children Seriously, maybe?  TCS which has been<br/>
talked about here before.<br/>
I am on the Montana unschoolers list and the list owner there refers to<br/>
herself as a &quot;rabid&quot; unschooler. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
SHE IS TOO!  (Hi Dana, lovey, if you&#39;re lurking on this list!)  I tend to<br/>
think of myself that way.  <br/>
In the house we lived in before this one my son did indeed have a wall he<br/>
could write and draw on with crayons.  It was interesting.&lt;g&gt;  We painted<br/>
it before we moved and he was past the age of wanting to draw on walls<br/>
when we moved into this house.  If he wanted to now I don&#39;t think I&#39;d<br/>
have a problem with it. <br/>
He jumped on the sofa too, and other parents are not wild about such<br/>
things.  (I am making payments on new upholstery as we speak, though.&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe your homeschooler was lurking on the MT list. &lt;g&gt;  But<br/>
seriously,  if it wasn&#39;t TCS I really don&#39;t know.  <br/>
