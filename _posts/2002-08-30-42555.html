&lt;&lt; Guess what Morgan *always* wanted to do at our house?  To the point <br/>
where it was frustrating Noah.  He wanted to play with other things, but <br/>
Morgan only wanted to play guns. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have that situation with video games.  Kids without game systems ONLY want <br/>
to play games here, unless they&#39;re here for so long their butts get tired.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why we got Kirby a game system long ago, because he would go to a <br/>
family&#39;s house with a Nintendo and be mesmerized.  <br/>
<br/>
It seemed to be a need.  Had they said &quot;No you can&#39;t play it,&quot; he would have <br/>
been distracted by the desire for it and the feeling they were being mean.<br/>
<br/>
So when kids come over I don&#39;t say &quot;No, go play with my kids.&quot;  I let them <br/>
play computer games and Nintendo and Playstation as long as they want to.   <br/>
But it would be better for all concerned if their parents (who can afford it) <br/>
would just buy them a system and let them explore that HUGE interest.  Then <br/>
they could play with my kids sometimes at our house!<br/>
