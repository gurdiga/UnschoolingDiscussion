<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755191466">Well, that was a timely and provacative post, our dear Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
And coming at this time of graduation and such - much needed perspective.<br/>
Especially for those of us who daily feel like salmon swimming upstream in<br/>
our endeavors to recognize these children we are parenting as perfect just<br/>
as they are, in all they are doing. <br/>
<br/>
Mostly I stumble on MY issues - my views of what is and is not education -<br/>
my history with schooling and the injuries and victories that were mine -<br/>
my struggle to gain my parents&#39; approval until the day they died, even<br/>
though my path was different that what they envisioned for me - my<br/>
inability to always express eloquently to those questioning or judging my<br/>
childrens&#39; educational journey - my comparing the &quot;accomplishments&quot; of<br/>
graduating children this spring to my teens&#39; lives and choices - my having<br/>
to justify to an ex what validity researching and making authentic<br/>
chainmail armor has to do with education, for example. Really, my children<br/>
are fine - I&#39;m the one just stumbling/bumbling along, learning from their<br/>
clarity each and every day. <br/>
<br/>
I am grateful for many people on this list and their deep and clear<br/>
commitment to unschooling and all that brings up in our lives. And, while<br/>
Sandra&#39;s posts are often poignant, this recent one was brilliant and<br/>
relevant beyond words.<br/>
<br/>
In aloha, Lee<br/>
