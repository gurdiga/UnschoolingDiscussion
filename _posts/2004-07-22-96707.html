 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been watching this discussion carefully, because  while part of me<br/>
would like to, I haven&#39;t fully embraced &quot;no bedtime&quot; for the little ones in<br/>
my house.  My children are 10, 4.5, 3 and 1.  My answer to the above<br/>
question would be:  Well, for me, the point would be that *I* really need<br/>
some downtime in the evening, in order to feel sane and be able to enjoy<br/>
being their mommy the next day.  I feel quite strongly about this and just<br/>
want it sooooo badly.  I can can actually feel my chest tightening just<br/>
thinking about how much this has been frustrating me.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, bedtime has become a major hassle like never before, in part I<br/>
believe, because the 3 yr old, instead of being in her crib now shares a<br/>
full-size bed with the 4.5 yr old and they bug each other incessantly.  I<br/>
would like to get two twins, but am not in a financial position to do that<br/>
at the moment.  Anyway, for the past couple of months, I&#39;ve tinkered with<br/>
letting them play quietly in their room if they still want to be up past<br/>
10:00, and they either play too loudly and wake the baby, or (more often)<br/>
they fight and wake the baby, or one calls me to tell on the other,<br/>
&quot;Maaaaaaaaahhhhhhmeeeeeeee!&quot; loudly and wakes the baby.  I can usually last<br/>
awhile, just kindly reminding them that Evan is sleeping in the next room<br/>
and he&#39;s tired, etc... and hugging them and asking them to please play<br/>
quietly or go to sleep, but by 11:30, sometimes sooner, sometimes later, I&#39;m<br/>
furious and yelling (under my breath) and talking to them through gritted<br/>
teeth and just completely exhasperated.  I&#39;ve tried so many ways to give<br/>
them more freedom without completely giving up any opportunity to have a<br/>
single braincell to myself, and nothing seems to work consistently.  In<br/>
fact, everything seems worse than when I just insisted they go to bed in the<br/>
first place.<br/>
<br/>
I do truly need some time to myself, especially since my husband works in<br/>
Portland, three hours from here and is only here on weekends.  With kids<br/>
this young, how can I eliminate bedtime and still enjoy the solace the<br/>
evening brings me?  Has anyone had this problem?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what if one child is tired and the other is not?  Sometimes the 4 year<br/>
old just wants to go to sleep, but the 3 year old just HAS to bug her.  We<br/>
don&#39;t have another quiet room for her to sleep in.  The 10 year old, who<br/>
regulates her own sleep quite well is in one of the three bedrooms, and the<br/>
baby is with me in the other.  If she came out here into the living room and<br/>
actually went to sleep, that would be one thing, but when I&#39;ve tried having<br/>
her do that, she starts playing or talking to me about anything and<br/>
everything (remember this is time I really, really want to myself  to read,<br/>
watch an adult-themed movie, knit quietly and think...whatever!).  It just<br/>
doesn&#39;t work.  Those of you who have actually gone to no bedtime when your<br/>
kids were younger, what did you do to have time to yourself?<br/>

James and I get our adult together time in the morning before Jayn gets up,<br/>

Jayn suddenly jumped back into her night shift a few days ago, and I am<br/>
reeling a bit having to push myself to follow her. She took a nap on Tuesday<br/>
night and that did it. I thought we had a good 2 weeks worth of &quot;days&quot; to<br/>
live in. At least it is a lot cooler at night. I look forward to her being<br/>
old enough to not want my attention for the whole night. My natural rhythm<br/>
is to go to bed about 1 and get up at about 10-11. This is my favorite. Dh<br/>
is the early riser - and has a great ability to nap in the afternoon that<br/>
eludes me no matter how tired I might be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Andrea,<br/>
<br/>
I hear you completely.  We have 5 kids (13, 11, 7, 5 and 4).  I also was so<br/>
desperate to have time to myself that I was pushing my kids away from me in<br/>
the evenings to get it.  I JUST needed a couple of hours to wind down.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t work.  The kids pushed back HARD.  They would get really wound up<br/>
and loud.  They would tattle on each other, poke each other, pester each<br/>
other.  I was so sick of &quot;MMMMOOOOOMMMM!!!!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So I gave in and decided to ride the wave.  They stay up as late as they<br/>
want as long as I am awake.  I do put the little kids down when I go to bed<br/>
because I have daredevils.  I also made sure that we spent lots and lots of<br/>
time outside, swimming, riding bikes, during the day.  In the evening, I<br/>
would watch tv with the kids or bake.  If I wanted to read, I would sit at<br/>
the kitchen table so everyone knew where I was.  I made sure to be willing<br/>
to put the book down to hold a child, get a blankie, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
It only took about 4 days for things to calm down into a rhythm.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We were in a babysitting co-op that was an extension of a playgroup, and <br/>
sometimes our kids were visiting another family. <br/>
<br/>
But on days when the kids were home and we were home, if by &quot;time to <br/>
yourself&quot; you mean sex, I would wake my husband up in the middle of the night.  <br/>
Usually kids were awake when he wanted to go to sleep, and a baby was awake when we <br/>
woke up.<br/>
<br/>
Even without that, arousal of the mother can signal something that wakes a <br/>
nursing baby up.  Milk lets down, or a the scent of a hormone broadcasts itself <br/>
or SOMETHING.  <br/>
<br/>
Distance might help that, but we had a small house when we had babies.<br/>

hated that thing.  I much prefer long walks and swimming.  I also eat too<br/>
much, especially in the evening.  It&#39;s weird--I know better, but it&#39;s sort<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyway, the point is, that without being able to care for myself<br/>
both mentally and physically, sex is the last thing on my mind!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I too need to have some down time for myself. For me it&#39;s best that it&#39;s<br/>
late at night when everyone else is asleep or at least tucked away. I don&#39;t<br/>
do well with mornings at all. Most nights my husband is in bed right after<br/>
the kids go to their respective corners. I wake him later for some loving<br/>
and after over 14 years, I&#39;ve never had any complaints. &lt;BG&gt; But you said<br/>
that&#39;s not your problem.<br/>
<br/>
Our house is on the larger size and that makes it convenient for everyone to<br/>
find a place to go. There is still switching around with who is sleeping<br/>
where though. My two younger girls share a room and hardly ever actually<br/>
sleep in their beds. We are actually considering getting rid of them! The<br/>
girls are on the floor all the time. Sleeping in different spots and on<br/>
sleeping bags, bean bag chairs and making various tents out of sheets and<br/>
tables. I&#39;ve had kids sleep in the playroom and my son will also sleep with<br/>
the girls and vice versa. Wherever they are happy is fine with me. There has<br/>
even been talk about them sleeping with our oldest in her room. She&#39;s up for<br/>
it but they can&#39;t seem to get her home early enough on the nights she<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to wake up early the next day. They aren&#39;t morning people<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
So the point is I need my down time too and the kids still get to stay up<br/>
late. They understand respect of others in the house. Dad is in bed usually<br/>
by 11:30 and when our oldest has to open for work the next day, she&#39;s in bed<br/>
by that time too. Or at least in her room for the night. The youngest are 9,<br/>
8 and 3. So as long as they are in their room or someone else&#39;s and<br/>
relatively quiet, they stay up and I still have my time. Of course I don&#39;t<br/>
have the fighting with them or have to tend to them often. Maybe try and<br/>
start helping them come up with solutions of their own to solve problems<br/>
that arise instead of you always going in to fix things. Or the one that<br/>
sleeps well can stay with the older one that sleeps earlier. Half the time<br/>
around here I never know where the kids will end up sleeping. But there are<br/>
other choices aside from them sleeping early and not liking it to staying up<br/>
late and stressing you out.<br/>

Yes I wanted to comment on this also. Grab all the kids and take a walk<br/>
around the neighborhood or go to a local park to walk. Le tthe kids grab<br/>
bikes or scooters and strollers. When it gets a little cooler here, we all<br/>
do that in the evening. We grab the dogs and the kids grab their scooters<br/>
and off we go. Let them push, pedal, pull or roll on whatever they like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898861520">==Can you put the kids in a stroller and take a walk? ==<br/>
<br/>
Well, I do, sort of.  I put the baby on my back, the 3 year old in the<br/>
stroller (my double stroller was stolen off my porch --grrrr--and we haven&#39;t<br/>
replaced it.) and the 4 year old walks.  It&#39;s really nice and we do it all<br/>
the time, but it doesn&#39;t really raise my heart rate...nor does it give me<br/>
that so longed for time alone!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-297022788">I just wanted to add that I just got a set of resistance bands from Bell.  They are easily stored, packed, traveled with etc.  And they really do give quite a workout.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take long to do the exercises.  The site I use is:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.changingshape.com/exercise/">http://www.changingshape.com/exercise/</a><br/>
<br/>
Its excellent and even gives demonstrations of the exercises.  It also has substitutions with other exercises that use machines (if you can get to a gym) or free weights.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I got was a stability ball (I guess thats what its called).  I have found that abdominal exercises are MUCH easier to do and much more effective on one of them.<br/>
<br/>
I got the whole thing for about $23.00.<br/>
<br/>
I also swim, but I can&#39;t always get there. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479960934">Oh, Oh, I am glad I saw this the second time around.  I missed it the first<br/>
time.  I was in your shoes, not too long ago.  I finally found a solution<br/>
that works well for me. Maybe it&#39;ll work for you too.  (before this I wasn&#39;t<br/>
into aerobics at all and I don&#39;t consider myself very coordinated)  I<br/>
discovered Leslie Sansone Walk Aerobic tapes.  They are very basic using<br/>
just four or five steps for the most part.  There are side steps, kicks,<br/>
marching in place, kick backs, and knee lifts.  They are all low impact but<br/>
still get me sweating.  Leslie is sweet but not sugary fake.  (get ready, I<br/>
am going to sound like an infomercial now.)  <br/>
 <br/>
Over the last 14 or so months, I&#39;ve lost 30 lbs and increased my muscle mass<br/>
substantially.  I no longer have an aching back and I look forward to<br/>
exercising every day.  I&#39;ve not really dieted at all but I am trying to make<br/>
better choices more often and I try to eat fruits, whole grains,  and<br/>
veggies every day.  I still eat a moderate amount of sweets, so I don&#39;t feel<br/>
like I am depriving myself.  My kids quickly got used to the fact that I<br/>
exercise every morning.  They know that it is my *me* time.  I make sure<br/>
they have something to eat and maybe a TV show to watch.  Sometimes they<br/>
bring their barbies down and barbie exercises with me.  :0)  <br/>
 <br/>
The tapes are only around $9 each at Walmart.  Often cheaper on ebay or<br/>
half.com.  If you hate them, you can always re-sell them on half.com.  I am<br/>
really enthusiastic about them because I had tried for years to find a way<br/>
to keep in shape with small kids and a dh that travels.  It wasn&#39;t my lack<br/>
of willingness that kept me out of shape.  I just hadn&#39;t found an activity<br/>
that kept my interest that didn&#39;t kill me.  I tried the stationary bike, the<br/>
treadmill, walking or running outside etc.  They either bored me or I<br/>
couldn&#39;t do them consistently because of the weather or the fact that dh<br/>
travels a lot.  I had done other aerobic tapes in the past, but you had to<br/>
be in great shape to begin with to even consider doing them.  Leslie works<br/>
for beginners as well as fit people because you can easily tailor it to your<br/>
fitness level.<br/>
 <br/>
(whew! all that enthusiasm is tiring!  LOL!)<br/>

It does help!  In fact, right after I wrote that this morning, we packed up and headed to the beach.  It was such a hot day and I was so thankful to be able to play in the water and feel the offshore breezes kick in.  The kids occupy themselves for hours out there, building in the sand and playing in the tidepools and surf.  I do notice that they sleep better if we get out to the beach or for a hike or some outdoor activity every day.  Sometimes, when I&#39;m tired, or am trying to catch up on housework, we&#39;ll stay home all day, and those days are the ones that are the hardest and that lead to the most problematic nights (fighting and such...)<br/>
<br/>
Yep, being near the beach is nice, though I don&#39;t know how long we will stay here.  Were supposed to stay through July, but it looks like there&#39;s a chance we&#39;ll stay through the winter, too.  I hope we do.  I like storm watching!<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Those of you who have actually gone to no bedtime when your<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids were younger, what did you do to have time to yourself?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Andrea,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hear you completely.  We have 5 kids (13, 11, 7, 5 and 4).  I also was<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; desperate to have time to myself that I was pushing my kids away from me<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the evenings to get it.  I JUST needed a couple of hours to wind down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It didn&#39;t work.  The kids pushed back HARD.  They would get really wound<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; and loud.  They would tattle on each other, poke each other, pester each<br/>
&gt; other.  I was so sick of &quot;MMMMOOOOOMMMM!!!!&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I gave in and decided to ride the wave.  They stay up as late as they<br/>
&gt; want as long as I am awake.  I do put the little kids down when I go to<br/>
bed<br/>
&gt; because I have daredevils.  I also made sure that we spent lots and lots<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; time outside, swimming, riding bikes, during the day.  In the evening, I<br/>
&gt; would watch tv with the kids or bake.  If I wanted to read, I would sit at<br/>
&gt; the kitchen table so everyone knew where I was.  I made sure to be willing<br/>
&gt; to put the book down to hold a child, get a blankie, whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It only took about 4 days for things to calm down into a rhythm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; should anyone sleep when someone else thinks that they are tired?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the point?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pat==<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been watching this discussion carefully, because  while part of me<br/>
&gt; &gt; would like to, I haven&#39;t fully embraced &quot;no bedtime&quot; for the little ones<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my house.  My children are 10, 4.5, 3 and 1.  My answer to the above<br/>
&gt; &gt; question would be:  Well, for me, the point would be that *I* really<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; &gt; some downtime in the evening, in order to feel sane and be able to enjoy<br/>
&gt; &gt; being their mommy the next day.  I feel quite strongly about this and<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; want it sooooo badly.  I can can actually feel my chest tightening just<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking about how much this has been frustrating me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lately, bedtime has become a major hassle like never before, in part I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe, because the 3 yr old, instead of being in her crib now shares a<br/>
&gt; &gt; full-size bed with the 4.5 yr old and they bug each other incessantly.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would like to get two twins, but am not in a financial position to do<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; at the moment.  Anyway, for the past couple of months, I&#39;ve tinkered<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; letting them play quietly in their room if they still want to be up past<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10:00, and they either play too loudly and wake the baby, or (more<br/>
often)<br/>
&gt; &gt; they fight and wake the baby, or one calls me to tell on the other,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Maaaaaaaaahhhhhhmeeeeeeee!&quot; loudly and wakes the baby.  I can usually<br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; awhile, just kindly reminding them that Evan is sleeping in the next<br/>
room<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he&#39;s tired, etc... and hugging them and asking them to please play<br/>
&gt; &gt; quietly or go to sleep, but by 11:30, sometimes sooner, sometimes later,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; furious and yelling (under my breath) and talking to them through<br/>
gritted<br/>
&gt; &gt; teeth and just completely exhasperated.  I&#39;ve tried so many ways to give<br/>
&gt; &gt; them more freedom without completely giving up any opportunity to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; single braincell to myself, and nothing seems to work consistently.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact, everything seems worse than when I just insisted they go to bed in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first place.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I do truly need some time to myself, especially since my husband works<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Portland, three hours from here and is only here on weekends.  With kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; this young, how can I eliminate bedtime and still enjoy the solace the<br/>
&gt; &gt; evening brings me?  Has anyone had this problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, what if one child is tired and the other is not?  Sometimes the 4<br/>
&gt; year<br/>
&gt; &gt; old just wants to go to sleep, but the 3 year old just HAS to bug her.<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have another quiet room for her to sleep in.  The 10 year old, who<br/>
&gt; &gt; regulates her own sleep quite well is in one of the three bedrooms, and<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; baby is with me in the other.  If she came out here into the living room<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually went to sleep, that would be one thing, but when I&#39;ve tried<br/>
&gt; having<br/>
&gt; &gt; her do that, she starts playing or talking to me about anything and<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything (remember this is time I really, really want to myself  to<br/>
&gt; read,<br/>
&gt; &gt; watch an adult-themed movie, knit quietly and think...whatever!).  It<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work.  Those of you who have actually gone to no bedtime when<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids were younger, what did you do to have time to yourself?<br/>

<br/>
Julie, it&#39;s good to hear that it&#39;s working for you to just let go and let<br/>
them schedule themselves.  I wish I could just turn the corner on all of<br/>
this, you know?  Not just the no bedtime idea, all of it.  I&#39;m still<br/>
struggling with letting them choose to eat candy whenever they want. (Mainly<br/>
because my 4 yo daughter wants it almost all of her waking hours and to the<br/>
exclusion of most other food, no matter what I offer!)  The idea of letting<br/>
my children make their own choices about food and sleep and all makes sense<br/>
to me when I read your posts, but I think I&#39;m still afraid of the<br/>
possibility of complete chaos, unhealthy kids and never having a minutes<br/>
peace again!  And I have to admit that I&#39;m having a hard time not<br/>
controlling some things.  My kids do push back hard, too.  I want to just<br/>
quit fighting them.  I think part of my fear stems from not feeling  like<br/>
*I* have it together enough to let go of my controls over them....ugh...I<br/>
can&#39;t explain.  My head is foggy and tired.  I&#39;ll try again in the morning<br/>
<br/>
But thank you for telling me about your experience, and thank you to others<br/>
for your input as well.  I&#39;m processing it.<br/>

&gt; I hear you completely.  We have 5 kids (13, 11, 7, 5 and 4).  I also was<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; desperate to have time to myself that I was pushing my kids away from me<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the evenings to get it.  I JUST needed a couple of hours to wind down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It didn&#39;t work.  The kids pushed back HARD.  They would get really wound<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; and loud.  They would tattle on each other, poke each other, pester each<br/>
&gt; other.  I was so sick of &quot;MMMMOOOOOMMMM!!!!&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I gave in and decided to ride the wave.  They stay up as late as they<br/>
&gt; want as long as I am awake.  I do put the little kids down when I go to<br/>
bed<br/>
&gt; because I have daredevils.  I also made sure that we spent lots and lots<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; time outside, swimming, riding bikes, during the day.  In the evening, I<br/>
&gt; would watch tv with the kids or bake.  If I wanted to read, I would sit at<br/>
&gt; the kitchen table so everyone knew where I was.  I made sure to be willing<br/>
&gt; to put the book down to hold a child, get a blankie, whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It only took about 4 days for things to calm down into a rhythm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve been watching this discussion carefully, because  while part of me<br/>
&gt; &gt; would like to, I haven&#39;t fully embraced &quot;no bedtime&quot; for the little ones<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my house.  My children are 10, 4.5, 3 and 1.  My answer to the above<br/>
&gt; &gt; question would be:  Well, for me, the point would be that *I* really<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; &gt; some downtime in the evening, in order to feel sane and be able to enjoy<br/>
&gt; &gt; being their mommy the next day.  I feel quite strongly about this and<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; want it sooooo badly.  I can can actually feel my chest tightening just<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking about how much this has been frustrating me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lately, bedtime has become a major hassle like never before, in part I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe, because the 3 yr old, instead of being in her crib now shares a<br/>
&gt; &gt; full-size bed with the 4.5 yr old and they bug each other incessantly.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would like to get two twins, but am not in a financial position to do<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; at the moment.  Anyway, for the past couple of months, I&#39;ve tinkered<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; letting them play quietly in their room if they still want to be up past<br/>
&gt; &gt; 10:00, and they either play too loudly and wake the baby, or (more<br/>
often)<br/>
&gt; &gt; they fight and wake the baby, or one calls me to tell on the other,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Maaaaaaaaahhhhhhmeeeeeeee!&quot; loudly and wakes the baby.  I can usually<br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; awhile, just kindly reminding them that Evan is sleeping in the next<br/>
room<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he&#39;s tired, etc... and hugging them and asking them to please play<br/>
&gt; &gt; quietly or go to sleep, but by 11:30, sometimes sooner, sometimes later,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; furious and yelling (under my breath) and talking to them through<br/>
gritted<br/>
&gt; &gt; teeth and just completely exhasperated.  I&#39;ve tried so many ways to give<br/>
&gt; &gt; them more freedom without completely giving up any opportunity to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; single braincell to myself, and nothing seems to work consistently.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact, everything seems worse than when I just insisted they go to bed in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first place.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I do truly need some time to myself, especially since my husband works<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Portland, three hours from here and is only here on weekends.  With kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; this young, how can I eliminate bedtime and still enjoy the solace the<br/>
&gt; &gt; evening brings me?  Has anyone had this problem?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, what if one child is tired and the other is not?  Sometimes the 4<br/>
&gt; year<br/>
&gt; &gt; old just wants to go to sleep, but the 3 year old just HAS to bug her.<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t have another quiet room for her to sleep in.  The 10 year old, who<br/>
&gt; &gt; regulates her own sleep quite well is in one of the three bedrooms, and<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; baby is with me in the other.  If she came out here into the living room<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually went to sleep, that would be one thing, but when I&#39;ve tried<br/>
&gt; having<br/>
&gt; &gt; her do that, she starts playing or talking to me about anything and<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything (remember this is time I really, really want to myself  to<br/>
&gt; read,<br/>
&gt; &gt; watch an adult-themed movie, knit quietly and think...whatever!).  It<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t work.  Those of you who have actually gone to no bedtime when<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids were younger, what did you do to have time to yourself?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand!!!!  May I suggest not &quot;letting go of all controls&quot; all at<br/>
once.  Work just to say &quot;yes&quot; more.  Slow down.  Each time your kids ask if<br/>
they can do something, think carefully about it, take your time and really<br/>
think.  Is there a valid real, true reason to say &quot;no&quot;?  Or is the tendency<br/>
to say &quot;no&quot; based on some fear of something possibly happening in the<br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
My kids DON&#39;T get all the candy they want.  There are 2 really real reasons<br/>
for that.  Number 1 is that we are a family of 7 with expensive hobbies (the<br/>
kids compete in gymnastics, stock shows and shooting events) living on one<br/>
income.  Food money is limited so we need to buy for the nutritional punch.<br/>
(That said we just had cake and punch yesterday because the kids were sad at<br/>
missing a wedding reception).<br/>
<br/>
Number 2 is that my 11yo son&#39;s teeth were actually rotting out of his head.<br/>
The dentist said that if he continued on his present diet he would be in<br/>
dentures by the age of 20.  It is apparently a genetic problem through his<br/>
birth mom.<br/>
<br/>
These are real, true reasons....not some possibility that might somehow<br/>
occur....not something that will make me pass some unschooling standard or<br/>
mothering standard.  Just real life issues.<br/>

&gt; Sorry for the empty reply I just sent!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Julie, it&#39;s good to hear that it&#39;s working for you to just let go and let<br/>
&gt; them schedule themselves.  I wish I could just turn the corner on all of<br/>
&gt; this, you know?  Not just the no bedtime idea, all of it.  I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; struggling with letting them choose to eat candy whenever they want.<br/>
(Mainly<br/>
&gt; because my 4 yo daughter wants it almost all of her waking hours and to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; exclusion of most other food, no matter what I offer!)  The idea of<br/>
letting<br/>
&gt; my children make their own choices about food and sleep and all makes<br/>
sense<br/>
&gt; to me when I read your posts, but I think I&#39;m still afraid of the<br/>
&gt; possibility of complete chaos, unhealthy kids and never having a minutes<br/>
&gt; peace again!  And I have to admit that I&#39;m having a hard time not<br/>
&gt; controlling some things.  My kids do push back hard, too.  I want to just<br/>
&gt; quit fighting them.  I think part of my fear stems from not feeling  like<br/>
&gt; *I* have it together enough to let go of my controls over them....ugh...I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t explain.  My head is foggy and tired.  I&#39;ll try again in the morning<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But thank you for telling me about your experience, and thank you to<br/>
others<br/>
&gt; for your input as well.  I&#39;m processing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201513795">I have always been an athlete and was a competitive rower in college.  My<br/>
cousin rowed in the &#39;84 Olympics (took a silver) and I learned that our<br/>
teams did the same workout.  Although I have a Concept II ergometer and some<br/>
free weights, some days I do these body circuits instead.  The workout<br/>
routine both of our teams did requires no equipment except a timer.  (We<br/>
obviously trained on the water and with weights, this was a winter aerobic<br/>
workout)<br/>
<br/>
Here it is, and on days when I don&#39;t feel like erging, I remember if it is<br/>
good enough for the Olympic team, it is nothing to turn my nose up at:<br/>
Pick 5-6 callisthenic exercises.  We did situps, pushups, jumpies, back<br/>
arches, bench pulls.  Currently I do situps, pushups, jumpies, back arches,<br/>
triceps dips, anything else I want to work on.<br/>
<br/>
You will do the exercise for 45 seconds, 15 seconds off, six times.  Take a<br/>
2 minute break and switch to the next exercise.  You end up with 30-40<br/>
minutes of fairly intense cardio.  Truly, at some point in the pushup<br/>
sequence I often end up doing pushups against the wall, as it is pretty<br/>
rigorous.<br/>
<br/>
A good part about these body circuits is I can do them any any room the kids<br/>
are in (mine are all young) and it often leads to play and wrestling and kid<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
If you have some spare money to invest, I highly recommend the Concept II.<br/>
The only exercise or sport that works more muscles and gives more of a<br/>
cardio workout is cross-country skiing.  That is a fact, not an opinion.<br/>
www.concept2.com.  Be warned, you may become addicted and compete in the<br/>
indoor rowing championships (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.crash-b.org/)">http://www.crash-b.org/)</a>.<br/>

I know exactly how you feel.  <br/>

I think it&#39;s because part of you does know that you<br/>
have influence over them as their Mom, and you&#39;re<br/>
taking a real responsibility for that, trying to do<br/>
what&#39;s best. <br/>
<br/>
The problem is, you&#39;re changing your mind about what<br/>
best *is*, and it takes time and effort to change that<br/>
mindset.  Won&#39;t happen overnite.  But you&#39;re doin it.<br/>
<br/>
   It&#39;s really overwhelming at first, acknowledging<br/>
all that &#39;power&#39;.  But you&#39;re acknowledging it so that<br/>
you can really use it to the advantage of your kids.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;ugh...I<br/>
can&#39;t explain.  My head is foggy and tired.  I&#39;ll try<br/>
again in the morning&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard work, what you&#39;re doing.  Give yourself time<br/>
to think, and take care of yourself.  If you have<br/>
young ones, I know that&#39;s hard, but try.  It helps a<br/>
lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-419561012">I just learned last Thursday that my Mom is moving back to town -- next weekend (the 31st).  We&#39;ve had a pretty close, but somewhat conflicted, relationship over  the years.  She&#39;s pretty much always lived near me, but for a few years and this past year.  She&#39;s usually pretty good about respecting our differences, tho there was a recent episode where she recommended spanking.  I think that was part of her depression and loneliness at being in NC, so I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t come up again -- and I was very firm that I won&#39;t hit my kids.<br/>
 <br/>
So, she&#39;s coming back, looking forward to spending time with me again and, I think, in a much better place emotionally.  She&#39;ll be house-sharing with a woman who&#39;s been her closest friend since I was a teenager, so they&#39;ve both been thru a lot together.  I&#39;m happy to have her nearby, in that I do enjoy her company and the boys love her.  BUT......<br/>
 <br/>
Several times lately, she&#39;s offered (totally unsolicited, mind you) ways I can include specific learning into Andy&#39;s &#39;schooling.&#39;  I&#39;ve never bothered to explain the unschooling thing to her because a) she was in NC and b) it&#39;s not something I&#39;m going to change, so it&#39;s not really open for debate.  Okay, that&#39;s very much my style since childhood -- I do what I want, let them believe what they want and share my thoughts only on a need to know basis.  I also do a fair amount of tongue-biting, because the fight&#39;s just not worth it.<br/>
 <br/>
Add to that, the inl-aws will be here in just 10 short weeks (early Oct) and I&#39;m probably just days away from developing a nervous tic and dumping all my stress on poor Gary.  I&#39;ve already begun stressing over the housekeeping to be done before then -- if I start tomorrow I just might be done by the time they arrive.  Of course, they will arrive with expectations for what Andy &#39;should&#39; be learning.  My mil is very bothered that Andy still writes in all caps and often reverses the &#39;N.&#39;   <br/>
 <br/>
And, of course, they&#39;ll be concerned about Andy&#39;s weight -- and no one will be quiet about that one.  With the in-laws it&#39;s about how we should sign Andy up for a regular activity - or that he&#39;d get regular exercise in school with PE and playground time -- even if it&#39;s not what Andy wants.  It&#39;s not like he&#39;s huge.  Neither of the doctors he&#39;s seen recently are concerned, his BMI is just slightly in the &#39;overweight&#39; range, and he&#39;s aware of it.  It breaks my heart to hear him, at age 8, saying he&#39;d like to be &#39;less fat&#39; and &#39;not so big.&#39;  <br/>
 <br/>
Reading this, I guess it&#39;s more about how I can stop my own worries now and get past the stress.  It&#39;s like constant warfare between the voices of my childhood -- what about school, he&#39;s too smart to not be writing, watch his weight now or he&#39;ll be fat forever, etc. and the rational, joyous truths I&#39;ve come to know in the last few years in my life with these children.  And it&#39;s the frustration that the only person who doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m misguided, too easy and naive is Gary.  I know it shouldn&#39;t matter to me what anyone outside our home thinks or wants, but the good daughter in me is feeling really battered right now.  And I don&#39;t want to spill over and dump on the guys.<br/>
 <br/>
Syl, who just needed to vent, I guess.<br/>

 <br/>
 Since her last departure, we&#39;ve embraced unschooling here.<br/>

You could explain that too, maybe.  I would personally (because of the way I <br/>
am) do it in writing, in one joint letter to all of them.  Tell them you have <br/>
a head full of negativity and you don&#39;t want that for your kids, so they are <br/>
welcome to come and be positive and happy and friendly but they are NOT welcome <br/>
to come and criticize or make fun of or try to be teachers.  One infraction <br/>
and they can leave the house.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I would do.  And then if it pissed them off so they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
visit, I would be relieved.<br/>

<br/>
OK, I&#39;m not you and I have no idea how scary your in-laws are, but I <br/>
would talk to them now about NOT making weight comments in front of your <br/>
son.  Even if you have to offer to spend half and hour on the phone now <br/>
&quot;listening to their concerns&quot;, I think it would be worth it to avoid <br/>
damaging your son&#39;s opinion of himself.   And it&#39;s okay with me &lt;g&gt; if <br/>
you make your husband do the talking on this issue.<br/>
<br/>
**but the good daughter in me is feeling really battered right now.  And <br/>
I don&#39;t want to spill over and dump on the guys.**<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to vent here, **especially** about how hard it is to &quot;sell&quot; <br/>
unschooling to our assorted friends and relations.   Telling you that <br/>
you&#39;ve made a wise decision (in choosing unschooling) and that outside <br/>
critics don&#39;t know what they are talking about is practically our <br/>
primary function on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Would role-playing help you work up some really strong sounding answers <br/>
and boundary enforcing statements?  (I don&#39;t do role-playing myself, but <br/>
I do do a lot of mental rehearsal.  First I do the &quot;dreading&quot; and then I <br/>
work up some &quot;snappy comebacks&quot; and then some tactful comebacks.)   I <br/>
was thinking that if you are really feeling timid right now, you should <br/>
take the role of the interfering in-law and your spouse should practice <br/>
the &quot;this is our decision&quot; answers.  It could be almost fun to play the <br/>
role of your m-i-l, if you wear a hat with a stuffed vulture on your <br/>
head and carry a big handbag. &lt;g&gt;  (Idea stolen from Harry Potter #3)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
** I also do a fair amount of tongue-biting, because the fight&#39;s just <br/>
not worth it.**<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm.  I think it&#39;s possible to disagree without having a fight.  BUT, I <br/>
haven&#39;t met your m-i-l, AND my natural tendency is to get a megaphone <br/>
and tell everyone exactly how I feel.  Tongue biting is just way too <br/>
deferential for me.  YMMV.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, *I&#39;ll* roleplay with you, and I bet other people will too, if you <br/>
don&#39;t mind.  You could post 5 disagreeable things that, based on her <br/>
track record, you think your m-i-l might come up with.  I bet we can <br/>
come up with more than 5 possible responses to each one, ranging from <br/>
very calm to very fiery.  (And possibly a couple of humorous ones.)</div>

Would having some literature available to hand to the family be helpful -<br/>
would they at least be quiet long enough to read it while you escaped.<br/>

<br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not really that I fear their disapproval, just that I don&#39;t want to talk about it if they disagree. I won&#39;t be swayed, so can&#39;t we find something pleasant to talk about?<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t feel any need to defend what we do, in that I know we&#39;re right.  For me it would be like wasting time arguing that grass is indeed green.  In myself, I really could not care less what they think -- as long as they don&#39;t share their thoughts with my kids.  <br/>
 <br/>
I will make a pre-emptive strike with my Mom about Andy&#39;s weight.  We came down pretty hard on the inlaws after our last visit re: mil&#39;s comments about his weight so I&#39;m quite sure they won&#39;t say anything in front of Andy.  I realize they are all very genuinely concerned.  We just have different strategies. I hope mine are more successful than my Mom -- we all three ended up with weight, food and diet issues.<br/>
 <br/>
Not having them visit isn&#39;t really an option, since the boys absolutely adore all their grandparents -- they even like my Dad.  I love the inlaws, they&#39;re good people and they&#39;ve been very good to us over the years.  Also, Gary is an only child, so keeping relationship with them is just part of the whole package.  We were both raised to be &#39;good&#39; children.<br/>
 <br/>
I think we&#39;re just going to be ourselves, and they can like it or not.  If they say something inappropriate, I&#39;ll just cut them off ann make it clear in front of the kids where we stand.  The hell with graciousness.  From now on, I&#39;ll opt for honesty and integrity.  I&#39;m not going to compromise our kids, or ask them to compromise themselves, for anyone. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217780559">It is possible your son is going to have a growth<br/>
spurt or will later grow into his weight as he gets<br/>
older. We do all come in different shapes and<br/>
sizes and as long as he is not obese and risking his<br/>
health there is nothing wrong with being his own shape<br/>
and size.  <br/>
<br/>
**********<br/>
 <br/>
At first (some 18 mos ago) I thought it was prep for a growth spurt.  My oldest son (19) was a stick-child, but just before a growth spurt he would gain just enought weight to look as if I actually fed him. &lt;g&gt; Then he would shoot up a few inches and be a stick yet again.   As an adult, he&#39;s 5&#39;10&quot; and only 120 lbs -- still a stick.  He was the kid who practically had to be force-fed<br/>
 <br/>
Andy has always been &#39;solid&#39; compared to both the other boys -- his younger brother is just overall small for his age.  Yes, he will grow into his current weight in that he will someday be tall enough to weigh more than his current 100 lbs.  And yes, he will likely always be stocky.  I could see that even when he was toddler -- he&#39;s just a big kid, tho not overly tall.  Additionally, he has food issues around textures and eats no meat (another sensory issue) so his diet is very comfort-food oriented, which others see as an indulgence on my part.  It&#39;s easy for them to say it&#39;s my fault he&#39;s overweight.  My Mom&#39;s take on it is that I &#39;let this happen.&#39;  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d much rather deal with this now than to have it sneak up on him in his 20&#39;s as happened to me and my sibs. Our diet was so totally controlled by Mom in our childhood that we rebelled in adulthood -- we were the young adults cruising the &#39;sugar-frosted sugar&#39; cereal aisle, and shunning all &#39;healthy&#39; food.  I guess since that happened after we left home, my Mom can feel that she didn&#39;t &#39;let it happen.&#39; I want Andy to find his own way to a relationship with food before adulthood, and to have a much better sense of self than I ever had.  <br/>
 <br/>
What I dislike most about the whole thing is that people tell me he&#39;s overweight -- like they think we haven&#39;t noticed yet.  Sorta like they feel if I knew I&#39;d have already fixed it, or I&#39;d have him eating nothing but celery sticks as proof that I was taking care of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999154243">Thanks for the suggestion Angela.  Actually, I hate sappy, cheerleader-like<br/>
aerobics too, so I&#39;m glad to hear there are alternatives.  I&#39;ve recently<br/>
checked out a couple of DVD&#39;s from the library, Tae-Bo and a Beginning Yoga<br/>
DVD that looks good.  I&#39;m going to try them and look into some others,<br/>
including the one you&#39;re suggesting.  I remember loving &quot;Perfectly Fit:<br/>
Abs&quot;.  While not really a sweating work out, it was great for strengthening<br/>
my stomach muscles and getting rid of back pain.  It was challenging, and I<br/>
liked the calm scenes and low-key instruction.  Problem is my VCR is broken<br/>
and I can&#39;t seem to find it on DVD.  Probably isn&#39;t even being produced<br/>
anymore.  It was several years ago that I used it.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know how I can transfer a video tape to DVD.  Probably a basic<br/>
thing, but I&#39;m ignorant about how to do that.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Oh, Oh, I am glad I saw this the second time around.  I missed it the<br/>
first<br/>
&gt; time.  I was in your shoes, not too long ago.  I finally found a solution<br/>
&gt; that works well for me. Maybe it&#39;ll work for you too.  (before this I<br/>
wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; into aerobics at all and I don&#39;t consider myself very coordinated)  I<br/>
&gt; discovered Leslie Sansone Walk Aerobic tapes.  They are very basic using<br/>
&gt; just four or five steps for the most part.  There are side steps, kicks,<br/>
&gt; marching in place, kick backs, and knee lifts.  They are all low impact<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; still get me sweating.  Leslie is sweet but not sugary fake.  (get ready,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; am going to sound like an infomercial now.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Over the last 14 or so months, I&#39;ve lost 30 lbs and increased my muscle<br/>
mass<br/>
&gt; substantially.  I no longer have an aching back and I look forward to<br/>
&gt; exercising every day.  I&#39;ve not really dieted at all but I am trying to<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; better choices more often and I try to eat fruits, whole grains,  and<br/>
&gt; veggies every day.  I still eat a moderate amount of sweets, so I don&#39;t<br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; like I am depriving myself.  My kids quickly got used to the fact that I<br/>
&gt; exercise every morning.  They know that it is my *me* time.  I make sure<br/>
&gt; they have something to eat and maybe a TV show to watch.  Sometimes they<br/>
&gt; bring their barbies down and barbie exercises with me.  :0)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The tapes are only around $9 each at Walmart.  Often cheaper on ebay or<br/>
&gt; half.com.  If you hate them, you can always re-sell them on half.com.  I<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; really enthusiastic about them because I had tried for years to find a way<br/>
&gt; to keep in shape with small kids and a dh that travels.  It wasn&#39;t my lack<br/>
&gt; of willingness that kept me out of shape.  I just hadn&#39;t found an activity<br/>
&gt; that kept my interest that didn&#39;t kill me.  I tried the stationary bike,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; treadmill, walking or running outside etc.  They either bored me or I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t do them consistently because of the weather or the fact that dh<br/>
&gt; travels a lot.  I had done other aerobic tapes in the past, but you had to<br/>
&gt; be in great shape to begin with to even consider doing them.  Leslie works<br/>
&gt; for beginners as well as fit people because you can easily tailor it to<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; fitness level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (whew! all that enthusiasm is tiring!  LOL!)<br/>
