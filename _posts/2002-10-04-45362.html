 </span></blockquote>I think that being &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; is what people have trouble with.<br/>
 <br/>
I have one child, and will never have another from my body.  Now that my son<br/>
is 6, people have finally stopped asking so often when I&#39;m going to have<br/>
another.  We&#39;ve looked into adopting, but we want an older child, and would<br/>
like Tim a little older before we go that route.  Telling people that gets<br/>
me all the adoption horror stories.  People seem to have a hard time with<br/>
the idea that virtually all adoptions are happy and uneventful, and that<br/>
adopted children by and large do *not* grow up to be ax murderers!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m becomming convinced that unless you have two children, preferably one of<br/>
each gender, born of your own body, and then stop, you&#39;re wierd in the eyes<br/>
of the world.  (oh well, who cares, right?  It&#39;s whatever is right for your<br/>
family.)<br/>

Well.....I agree that people shouldn&#39;t fill you up with negativity when you <br/>
tell them your plans. <br/>
BUT, I was raised with three adopted siblings, and while two of them would be <br/>
considered &quot;happy/uneventful&quot; by the outside world, the damage within our <br/>
family was pretty tough.<br/>
Adopting older children is a huge responsibility, and they often have <br/>
problems you won&#39;t know about until well into the venture.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Virtually all&quot; suggests the adoption horror stories are lies.<br/>
<br/>
I know as many bad stories as good, and I know lots which turned out <br/>
imperfectly if you look at them from 30-year perspectives, and not just count <br/>
five year olds, ten year olds, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;BUT, I was raised with three adopted siblings, and while two of them would <br/>
be <br/>
considered &quot;happy/uneventful&quot; by the outside world, the damage within our <br/>
family was pretty tough.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know a family now with three adopted of five.  The two natural children are <br/>
lost in the shuffle (the nicest way to say that).  My parents raised two <br/>
cousins along with me and my sister.  One did will.  The other never did, <br/>
rarely had a good day, did not do well with her life, still hasn&#39;t, much <br/>
badness.  She &quot;sexualized&quot; my little sister, in our home.<br/>
<br/>
Not an infant adoption, so doesn&#39;t count in some ways.<br/>
<br/>
I know an adopted child who caused her parents all the problems they ever <br/>
had.  They had charmed lives, sweet marriage, three really very interesting, <br/>
honest, energetic boys, and adopted a girl who was mean, sneaky, has been <br/>
arrested several times, and last I knew didn&#39;t seem very grateful at all.  <br/>
But they were good Catholics and saw it as doing something for Jesus, so they <br/>
were not regretful.<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring the potential problems isn&#39;t good for the kids one already has.<br/>
