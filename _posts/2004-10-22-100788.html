<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983125256">The thread called &quot;Adult Results&quot; reminds me of the questions I sometimes get from <br/>
people about unschooling. When I offer answers, I am occasionally told that what I&#39;ve just <br/>
explained can&#39;t be true unschooling because... x, y, z. Or they wonder if I know how the <br/>
kids are learning, or if I worry about their choices, or... <br/>
<br/>
As I was driving around thinking, I realized that there may be a fundamental <br/>
misconception of unschooling that underlies the questions. While some school-at-homers <br/>
misunderstand unschooling to be &quot;free time for personal interests&quot; after minimal required <br/>
work is done (and we say, that&#39;s not unschooling), there are others who actually think <br/>
unschooling means the kids are completely unattended and that they learn exclusively by <br/>
osmosis without ever studying or applying themselves to a topic in any kind of systematic <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
So if a homeschooling friend hears from me that one of my kids is studying math with a <br/>
curricula, I&#39;m told, &quot;But I thought you unschooled.&quot; If my daughter takes a French class, <br/>
they think she is no longer unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
They wonder how my kids learn to handwrite. One of my kids uses a handwriting book. <br/>
She asked for one. She wants to learn cursive. She thinks it&#39;s fun to fill it in. But I get the <br/>
impression that some people think unschoolers learn cursive by simply growing up. And if <br/>
in simply growing up the child didn&#39;t learn cursive, then unschooling &quot;failed&quot; her.<br/>
<br/>
I read to the kids every day. We talk about what we read and often it leads to follow-up <br/>
discussions and interest in a topic of historical interest. This looks a lot like what people <br/>
do who use Sonlight or Greenleaf for their &quot;history studies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yet I know that it is nothing of the sort. There is no requirement to listen to me, the kids <br/>
help me pick the books and I am not testing or evaluating how much information they <br/>
retain. I&#39;m not trying to &quot;cover an era of history&quot; for its own sake. Yet they are learning <br/>
history too.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is all about involvement in our kids&#39; lives, living our values and ideas before <br/>
them, learning along side them, giving them resources to sate their curiosity and honoring <br/>
their desire to study or prepare for whatever interests them. (Whether that study is for a <br/>
current passing interest or is somethiing they perceive as necessary to a future they <br/>
desire, like college or art school or joining a rock band).<br/>
<br/>
It is *not* leaving kids unattended and withholding curricula or classes or anything that <br/>
might be misunderstood as &quot;schoolish&quot; in an attempt to say that my kids learned <br/>
everything they needed without anyone&#39;s help or input. I think some people imagine <br/>
unschooling must be kids in a home doing virtually nothing but playing video games and <br/>
yet somehow magically come out at 18 with ACT scores in the 30s on their way to a <br/>
prestigious college, and if that doesn&#39;t happen, then somehow unschooloing failed...<br/>
