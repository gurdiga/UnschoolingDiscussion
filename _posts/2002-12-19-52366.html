Do any of you with fast reacting kids (or fast reacting selves) seek out <br/>
those types of movies?<br/>

I don&#39;t like the &quot;I forgot to breathe&quot; feeling.  The one about nuclear bombs <br/>
on a truck trying to get out of Russia was too much for me.  (Keith says <br/>
&quot;Peacemaker.&quot;) Because it was video I could turn it off and recover.  The <br/>
Bourne Identity was a bit much.   I still haven&#39;t watched the first Mad Max <br/>
movie, and just the other day when we read there will be a fourth one, my <br/>
husband reminded me I probably still don&#39;t want to watch that first one.<br/>
<br/>
I like chick flicks.  I like historicals.  I especially like movies that have <br/>
to do with the nature of reality, or with a young irritating man growing into <br/>
maturity, or with ethics and morality.  And I know I haven&#39;t seen them all, <br/>
so feel free to make recommendations!!  <br/>
<br/>
Some I was thinking of as I wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
nature of reality,  (Last Action Hero, The Matrix [I overlooked the violence <br/>
to get Lawrence Fishburn and nature-of-reality], Rosencrantz and Guildenstern <br/>
are Dead)<br/>
<br/>
or with a young irritating boy/man growing into maturity,   (Guarding Tess, <br/>
Seven Years in Tibet, Brother Sun/Sister Moon, The Karate Kid, About a Boy)<br/>
<br/>
or with ethics and morality (The Emperor&#39;s Club, Crimson Tide, El Cid, Ben <br/>
Hur)<br/>
<br/>
Action just for the sake of action, like Air Force One or Executive Decision <br/>
or The Rock, those aren&#39;t physically comfortable for me to watch.  Die Hard; <br/>
too much.   Well-Drillers in Space I kinda liked, for the cast, but the <br/>
dramatic tension isn&#39;t good for my part me &quot;it&#39;s only a movie.&quot;  If I forget <br/>
for even two or three minutes, I can get uncomfortable.<br/>

Oh, I really like him in The Sixth Sense and in Mercury Rising - two more films my older boys also really were interested in...Leonie W. - who finds films and unschooling and learning mix well <br/>
