I would highlight the fact that only having two or three kids to worry about<br/>
lets you use different strategies than you do in a class room.  That you are<br/>
with them all the time and use all the things in life to teach them, not<br/>
just textbooks and specific times of day.  That you may not cover the same<br/>
things that school kids do, but that school kids won&#39;t come close to the<br/>
breadth that you WILL cover.<br/>

&quot;...Use all the things in life to teach them...&quot;  Good idea for a<br/>
come-back/explaination.  Sometimes in the heat of a moment you can&#39;t think<br/>
of something to say and so I&#39;m going to practice too!<br/>
Thanks, Lisa</div>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes it helps to turn the subject to yourself.  I like to bring up all<br/>
the things that I&#39;ve learned since I *left* school.  I am quite an expert on<br/>
a variety of subjects.  They were important to me, so I looked into them.<br/>
Of course, this might backfire, since a lot of my self-education is so<br/>
radical...all that breastfeeding, homebirthing, having a lot of kids,<br/>
unschooling, etc.  I think there are a few other things that are more<br/>
mainstream that I&#39;ve learned, but the radical stuff is what I had to learn.<br/>
Most of the mainstream stuff is just that...fed in all the time<br/>
(mainlined???) and so we don&#39;t have to actively seek to learn it.  In fact,<br/>
we have to actively seek not to absorb some of that stuff!<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah...it helps to have the other person think about all of the things<br/>
that they&#39;ve learned about since they left school.<br/>
