<div id="ygrps-yiv-552662537">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I have been enjoying the converstaions lately. I recieve flack on our<br/>
homeschooling all the time. I am the closes thing to a radical in my family.<br/>
hehehehe... I am always hearing and reading  of people trying to explain<br/>
their choice to unschool. As for me, I haven&#39;t bothered telling anyone. We<br/>
started out doing school at home and have gradually come into unschooling.<br/>
We have been &quot;at it&quot; for three years now, and I haven&#39;t told anyone. They<br/>
all assume I do school at home, I let them assume. If I am ever asked I will<br/>
give a truthful answer, but until then....<br/>
<br/>
Is this bad? Is there a reason I should explain my choices to others? Is<br/>
this a sign that I am really a chicken? :) Well, the last statement is true,<br/>
at least in regards to my mom. (an over bearing woman, who only sees black<br/>
and white, I love her and know she means well, but I shake at the thought of<br/>
her anger). When I talk to other people I will state my beliefs and<br/>
opinions, from there I allow them to say what they please, for I know in my<br/>
heart what is right for my family. And I secretly feel sorry for people who<br/>
can&#39;t see the joy in my life or find the happiness in their children.<br/>

<br/>
It makes you someone who is confident enough in her own choices not to have <br/>
to justify them to others.<br/>
<br/>
It makes you someone who is not looking for unnecessary confrontations.<br/>

My MIL, who had kind words to say today about the kids when she stopped by <br/>
(without calling ahead -- grrrr -- but the kids were wonderful) wouldn&#39;t get <br/>
unschooling and we don&#39;t discuss that.  She sees lots of books and &quot;stuff&quot; <br/>
around and happy kids.  That seems to be enough.<br/>
<br/>
Throw &#39;em a bone and move on, I say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82231874">I&#39;m in the same mode of thinking, Sheri.  I don&#39;t offer much about the way we don&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; unless pressed.  Usually, I just say we learn from life, and use things all around us, and I don&#39;t buy a certain packaged curriculum.  Call me paranoid, but I just don&#39;t see why it is anybody&#39;s business, unless they are trying to find a better fit for their own family.  I don&#39;t want to volunteer anything that could come back and bite me later.<br/>
<br/>
People might guess....I am always telling other homeschoolers that they should relax a bit and not be so rigid in keeping schedules, and look for opportunities to insert a bit of knowledge.  The best advice I try to give is to really REALLY answer the kids&#39; questions instead of giving them the &quot;not now, dear&quot; line.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, we found some gecko eggs, which the youngest kids wanted to keep and hatch.  They asked me what kind of food they&#39;d need to provide, and decided to go look it up when I said I didn&#39;t know.  First, they had to figure out how to spell the word &quot;gecko&quot;.  It was great.  I did read the paragraph to them, to speed things along a bit, but made them find the article to begin with.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For many years that is what my family saw too, happy kids, lots of stuff, <br/>
books,<br/>
never really asking about the homeschooling, never quizzing the kids.  Finally<br/>
my dad and I were talking and he was asking me how we go about it and I had&#39;<br/>
to tell him.  I never used the word unschooling but he totally got what I was <br/>
talking about. Unreal. Had another great conversation about the HSC conference<br/>
in CA with mymom the other day, again talking about unschooling without<br/>
using the word. She totally was into what I was saying. Very cool. You just<br/>
never know.  I am glad that I didn&#39;t try to educate them about what we were<br/>
doing, all they saw were how wonderful their darling grandchildren were, all<br/>
the while hearing more and more good stories about hs&#39;ers in the paper etc.<br/>
My mom saves all teh good articles for me (she knows I don&#39;t like to read the<br/>
bad ones like Time).<br/>
