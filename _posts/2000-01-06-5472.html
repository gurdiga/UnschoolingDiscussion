<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568525517">please introduce another topic but the &#39;influences&#39; thread is really not about<br/>
pokemon it&#39;s more about religion and freedom to state opinion - kind of an<br/>
etiquette thing.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas on setting up a &quot;dinosaur dig&quot;?<br/>
 i don&#39;t but you might be interested in the following link - i had sent about<br/>
6 weeks ago<br/>
<br/>
hi,<br/>
<br/>
below you&#39;ll find a copy of the intro for the texas memorial museum&#39;s annual<br/>
paleontology showcase to give<br/>
you an idea what this exhibition is, you&#39;ll also find a link to the site.  i<br/>
thought some others might be interested<br/>
because it has a  Virtual Tour of this exhibit! as well as a<br/>
 Curriculum Guide on-line.<br/>

Welcome to TMM&#39;s annual paleontology showcase! The Texas Memorial Museum has<br/>
millions of fossils in its<br/>
collections. Spanning hundreds of millions of years, our fossils tell the<br/>
story of the natural history of Texas. At<br/>
any given time, however, only a fraction of TMM&#39;s fossils are on display in<br/>
exhibits. The rest are in our<br/>
research labs, on loan to other museums around the world, or stored in our<br/>
collection areas.<br/>
<br/>
This exhibit allows us to show off some of TMM&#39;s finest fossils. Some, like<br/>
the saber-toothed cat and the<br/>
exquisite starfish from South Austin, are old favorites that haven&#39;t been on<br/>
display in<br/>
years. Others, like Chasmosaurus and the plesiosaur, are newer acquisitions<br/>
that have never been seen in<br/>
public. In addition to our own specimens, we are fortunate enough to have a<br/>
few rare pieces on loan for this<br/>
exhibit. Two specimens are on loan from other museums: Confuciusornis from the<br/>
Beijing Museum of Natural<br/>
History, and Thrinaxodon from The University of California at Berkeley. In<br/>
addition, Diplocaulus is on loan<br/>
from a private collector. We are grateful to these lenders for allowing us the<br/>
chance to display their specimens.<br/>

I have the sandbox -- what do I have to add -- that won&#39;t permanently ruin <br/>
the sandbox??  Maybe it has to be a separate thing??<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to suggestions.<br/>

<br/>
I suppose I could tell you all the things my kids have learned from playing<br/>
Pokemon, but I won&#39;t.  :p<br/>
<br/>
But, there is a nice thread on the topic on the unschooling.com website, in<br/>
case anyone&#39;s interested.<br/>
<br/>
Also, did you know there&#39;s a list for working and homeschooling? It&#39;s on<br/>
Onelist too... here&#39;s the URL for more info:<br/>
