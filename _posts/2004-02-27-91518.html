<div id="ygrps-yiv-184302891">Hi, I just had a light bulb moment that I wanted to share with you <br/>
all.  My DD just asked to eat a bannana.  Once it was peeled, she <br/>
wanted a knife to cut it up and eat it.  Normally, I would have told <br/>
her &quot;no&quot; that she might hurt herself and then I would do it for <br/>
her.  However, after reading the most recent threads with much <br/>
interest, I decided to let her do it for herself.  I gave her a <br/>
butter knife and a fork.  She proceeded to cut up the bannana and <br/>
eat it with the fork.  She then looked at me and said &quot;look, I did <br/>
it mommy!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It may seem like something small but it was a BIG step for me and I <br/>
have all of you to thank for it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Melissa</div>
