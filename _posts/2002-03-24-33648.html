<div id="ygrps-yiv-440626589">Its been beautiful traveling through NY state, visiting some old <br/>
friends and making our way to Canada. Here I sit with three lovely <br/>
boys of various ages playing Super Smash Brothers II on Game Cube.<br/>
<br/>
Had a restless night so I logged on and read some posts. Not nearly <br/>
as many as I wanted, but the list has been ever so prolific of late.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see the irony going here?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to take the liberty to sum it up in how _I_ perceive this <br/>
whole she-bang. We&#39;re off to rollar skating soon, so I might not add <br/>
all that I wanted to. And I find it necessary to paraphrase, if I <br/>
don&#39;t say what the original poster intended, its purely by perception.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody posted something.. and in that post they said they required <br/>
something of their children. Elissa (the brave one who has already <br/>
stepped forward on more than one occasion) said, and I paraphrase all <br/>
of this, &#39;you are not an unschooler, you might like the eclectic <br/>
homeschool list&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
When the issue went further, and nobody could find anything in GWS or <br/>
Holt&#39;s work that said anything about not requiring. And Elissa said <br/>
something on the order &#39;if you require X (x=anything) then you are <br/>
not an unschooler, there are other lists to go and find what you <br/>
need.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
This broke off into an larger mushroom because Elissa has stated her <br/>
unschooling philosophy included chores. <br/>
<br/>
Then Helen and a few others came along and talked about how <br/>
requirements of our children did not mean being outside of the <br/>
unschooling scope. As that went on, Elissa said that we need to move <br/>
forward and forget it, she apologized already.<br/>
<br/>
Bear with me here, its a chronologed perception.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I see after the fact, the brave Elissa said she did send out <br/>
a &#39;call to help&#39; because this list was letting unschooling fall into <br/>
a category that wasn&#39;t &#39;real&#39; or &#39;true&#39; unschooling. It is netiquette <br/>
not to discuss one list on another, but since there were no clear cut <br/>
statement in a welcome letter, the horse is out of the barn, and the <br/>
issue is moot. Maybe it will fire a spark in people here that run <br/>
lists to add a letter to their protocol.<br/>
<br/>
As the mushroom grows, we begin seeing posts that are saying &#39;well <br/>
why are you (plural) defending people who require their children to <br/>
do math and call themselves unschoolers&#39;. This never happened. Do you <br/>
see the telephone game being played with all the honest intentions of <br/>
the people doing the communicating?<br/>
<br/>
In an attempt to put unschooling into a common definition, most <br/>
people here were trying to find what does fall under it. Some were <br/>
still riled up over the original incident (from either side, if the <br/>
shoe fits wear it, if not, don&#39;t buy into it).<br/>
<br/>
Those, like myself, were unaware that a message that we get from the <br/>
moderators periodically on the list, were not give when someone new, <br/>
or renew, signs on. The one that states &#39;Because unschooling means <br/>
different things to different people... (could Cindy or Mary please <br/>
repost that for clarity). So the effort by some to clarify their <br/>
positions became what seems to be a struggle for &#39;right&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I was mistaken in my communications more than once. I was <br/>
told I didn&#39;t want people to share their experiences, and I didn&#39;t <br/>
want the word mindful used, and some other comments. Neither was <br/>
true, but I don&#39;t blame the person who misunderstood. I feel it was <br/>
the way the dynamics of how the conversation was going that it was <br/>
hard to see through the misagosh.<br/>
<br/>
Some people post in response to a specific issue. And call out those <br/>
posts. Sometimes by name. Some people talk in theory and philosophy <br/>
because it is their style.<br/>
<br/>
Tlatter says &#39;unschooling is not doing one subject and then calling <br/>
yourself an unschooler&#39;, when there was no such specific post to that <br/>
mentioned. And this is the irony of it all.<br/>
<br/>
Frustration flew, as there was no such need to defend something that <br/>
didn&#39;t happen and then all the going back and forth with the original <br/>
incident being totally neglected.<br/>
<br/>
Helen, whom I have respect for in the posts I&#39;ve seen here and on <br/>
some of the homeschooling legal alerts boards, was overwhelmed at <br/>
seeing this going on yet again. I can understand when someone&#39;s true <br/>
livlihood is at stake because of this. Personally, I didn&#39;t subscribe <br/>
to HEM because of something prejudicial that was said from one of her <br/>
columnists, and told her so back in December, in a private note. <br/>
Somehow I didn&#39;t get the feeling that it mattered, just one <br/>
subscription. Apparently it is more than that now, and one of the <br/>
people that I stayed here for is gone.<br/>
<br/>
Taking sides? Is that what people see that it looks like? What a <br/>
shame. I appreciated information and POV from people like Helen, <br/>
Lynda, Tia and many others. I&#39;ve also disagreed with people on <br/>
issues, and still can agree with them on other issues.<br/>
<br/>
As far as black cats. As the thread went. No, you can&#39;t call a black <br/>
cat anything else. BUT we are using a physical definition for an <br/>
object that absorbs all the light. In physics, when an object absorbs <br/>
all the colors of the spectrum, its going to reflect black back. How <br/>
can anything so cut and dry be ascribed to the therm &#39;unschooling&#39; <br/>
which is as organic as the mountain I am sitting on right now. <br/>
Analagies work sometimes. And sometimes one is comparing apples to <br/>
oranges.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, as unschooling lives would have it, the plans changed <br/>
from the time I started this missive. So we&#39;re off to go bowling and <br/>
find what else this place offers. I love road trips within road trips.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269335693">I was thinking about this today.<br/>
I can remember being a new homeschooler on the AOL boards about 5 <br/>
years ago.  I remember going to the unschooling section quite a bit <br/>
and learning and thinking and coming to unschooling with my family.  <br/>
It was quite a struggle and a very exciting journey.<br/>
I also remember there being a lot of fuss about this and that on the <br/>
P/CP boards and sometimes on the unschooling boards, and as I recall, <br/>
I paid very little attention to it.  I wanted to hear about <br/>
unschooling and what people thought of it.  How they lived it.  Why <br/>
they thought something wasn&#39;t unschooling and ways to get to it <br/>
without as much struggle or frustration.  Those were the posts I paid <br/>
attention to.  The bickering and stuggle between the forceful powers <br/>
of that board meant absolutley nothing to me.  I couldn&#39;t relate.<br/>
I figured it was something important for them to stuggle through, but <br/>
I needed to focus on ME and what I needed for my family.<br/>
I remember lots of people leaving, complaining about the changes of <br/>
the boards(I still had no interest in that).  The unschooling board <br/>
eventually became pretty barren except for a few wonderful people <br/>
like Linda Wyatt and others.   <br/>
I became a part of the P/CP &quot;crew&quot; and had many lively discussions, <br/>
but not too many on unschooling.  <br/>
The unschooling section would get heated up now and then, and I would <br/>
have a boost in my learning.<br/>
I ALWAYS learned more when the discussion of &#39;what is unschooling and <br/>
can it be defined&#39; came up.<br/>
The more i participated in, the more I learned.  Though it took a <br/>
while for me to be brave enough and feel confident enough too <br/>
participate.<br/>
Anyway....lets talk about unschooling!  Lets let people feel very <br/>
radical about it, and lets hear why people think it doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
be quite so.<br/>
Lets argue and share and ramble and feel free!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890710033">I really don&#39;t understand the purpose of this post<br/>
I am hurt that you have found it necessary to point out things I have &quot;said&quot;<br/>
which I believe was completely misrepresented. I<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Somebody posted something.. and in that post they said they required<br/>
something of their children. Elissa (the brave one who has already<br/>
stepped forward on more than one occasion) said, and I paraphrase all<br/>
of this, &#39;you are not an unschooler, you might like the eclectic<br/>
homeschool list&#39;.<br/>
When the issue went further, and nobody could find anything in GWS or<br/>
Holt&#39;s work that said anything about not requiring. And Elissa said<br/>
something on the order &#39;if you require X (x=anything) then you are<br/>
not an unschooler, there are other lists to go and find what you<br/>
need.&#39;&gt;&gt;<br/>
***When? Show me.<br/>
This broke off into an larger mushroom because Elissa has stated her<br/>
unschooling philosophy included chores.<br/>
*****WHAT? No way. Not in this house.<br/>
<br/>
Then Helen and a few others came along and talked about how<br/>
requirements of our children did not mean being outside of the<br/>
unschooling scope. As that went on, Elissa said that we need to move<br/>
forward and forget it, she apologized already.<br/>
*****This is totally wrong. I apologized for my words and how I came across.<br/>
WHY is there a need to keep this whole rediculus conversation going.<br/>
She said, she said. This is BS<br/>
I may have suggested another list (although I don&#39;t ewven KNOW of any<br/>
Eclectic lists personally.<br/>
Leave me out of this.<br/>

up again. I believe that I have been misrepresented by Kolleen. i&#39;m not sure<br/>
why she chose to focus a post completely on me, I was not talking to myself.<br/>
I have been making some adjustments in my writing, I&#39;m very new to<br/>

been trying to help someone else as I have been helped here. I obviously<br/>

Elissa, please don&#39;t stop posting!  And try not to feel picked on.  <br/>
I&#39;ve BTDT with having others words attributed to me because I was part <br/>
of a conversation.  It&#39;s usually best to just politely say, that <br/>
wasn&#39;t me.  I&#39;m pretty sure Kolleen didn&#39;t mean to pick on you.  It&#39;s <br/>
hard to be away and come back into a situation like this and read it <br/>
all at once and keep the players straight.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I look forward to hearing more from you.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420452900">Dear Elissa,<br/>
<br/>
Please realise that no matter how clearly someone *says* something, <br/>
there will always be someone who *hears* something completely different. <br/>
None of us can say the same thing in a sufficient number of ways to make <br/>
the intended meaning clear to everyone - especially in this sort of <br/>
situation where many of the words we use are defined differently by <br/>
different people eg christian, unschooling, discipline, hitting - even, <br/>
apparently, black (I was accused of being racist for saying my cat was <br/>
black, even if it was covered in baby talc??!!). The best we can do, is <br/>
the best we can do!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I am *not* suggesting that this is a one way problem, nor am <br/>
pointing the finger at anyone! It is a basic problem of human communication.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that for, many if not most, the intention of your messages have <br/>
come through loud and clear, but there will always be a few whose past <br/>
experiences will either not allow them to hear you, or who have a <br/>
different understanding of the words.<br/>
<br/>
(((hugs)))<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950304096">I wrote a post that hasn&#39;t come through about this. Maybe later??<br/>
Just wanted to let Elissa know I think she does a great job of <br/>
communicating and I completely agree with Carol here.<br/>
