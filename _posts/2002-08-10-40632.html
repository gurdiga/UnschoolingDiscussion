<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357987394">I also used Phonics Pathways by Dolores Hiskes with my daughter. This is the program that actually helped her learn to read.  I liked the fact that we could just open the book and start reading. There was no prep work involved. The book is printed in a 24 point type face with lots of white space on the pages. The words are grouped by letter sounds which makes it a useful reference book also.  New words are listed before the sentence so the child has a chance to read the new word before tackling the entire sentence.  <br/>
  <br/>
Some very easy readers dd like were; Suzy Mule, Foxy Fox, Lucky Duck, Penny Hen, etc. The authors last name was DeRubertis.<br/>
