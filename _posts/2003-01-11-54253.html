such.. I remember so many times when my children were smaller and they balked <br/>
at taking medicine that they NEEDED to get better.. We&#39;ve never been the type <br/>
of family to run to the Dr for every little sneeze or rash, and our children <br/>
have been very healthy ( thanfully)  But, they&#39;ve had the occasional sinus <br/>
infection, bronchititis, chicken pox, typical child hood illnesses.  They had <br/>
to be coerced , bribed, pleaded with, whatever it took to get them to take <br/>
thier medicine.   Ethan always resisted the most, hardly ever finishing his <br/>
RX.. And he had recurring ear infections to the point that he had to get <br/>
tubes.. His hearing was affected,and that affected his speech and also <br/>
frustrated him.  One thing led to another, but I couldnt get him to <br/>
understand the consequences of not taking his medicine.  Then he resisted <br/>
wearing ear plugs in the pool or bath.Of course, all of this took place <br/>
before I ever thought of  &quot;not&quot; coercing them, and I used every tactic I <br/>
could think of get that medicine in them..  .  Just last month, no, in <br/>
November, when JP burned his eye,  it would take two of us to hold him down <br/>
and force the eye drops into his eye. It was awful, he had to be restrained, <br/>
physically held down,  but he needed the drops for his cornea to heal.   I <br/>
delayed taking him to the Dr for 3 days becasue he was so scared of going.  I <br/>
hoped he would get better through the course of nature and not have to see <br/>
the Dr.. Well, when I finally took him, his eye was much more infected than <br/>
it would have been if I had taken him right away ( despite his terror over <br/>
going).  So, I wonder too, whats a mother to do?  Fortunately, my children <br/>
are most all big enough now to understand the necessity in taking medicine or <br/>
following safety standards.. ( seat belts and bike helmets come to mind too.. <br/>
my kids HATED them.. I had to &quot;make&quot; them wear them)   I am sure its <br/>
difficult for a child who pretty much gets to do what he wants, and is <br/>
allowed to avoid anything he doesnt want to do, all of the sudden is required <br/>
to take yucky medicine, or wear knee pads to skate.. How have some of the <br/>
veterans handled these challanges?<br/>

I don&#39;t know but if anyone has an answer, I sure could use it. Out of all 4 <br/>
kids, my oldest is the only one that never gave me a problem with taking <br/>
meds. She&#39;s still good when she needs to take something. I have tried <br/>
everything with the other 3. I finally got the 7 and 8 year olds to take a <br/>
small pill. Unfortunately not everything they need to take comes in a <br/>

I totally understand where your kids are coming from. I have never been <br/>
able/willing to take meds. The few times when it could not be avoided I <br/>
always washed them down with something sweet. Usually a milkshake. Now my <br/>
kids are the same way so they pick their favorite thing and I stock up on <br/>
it until their done having to take meds. My son usually picks yogurt or <br/>
that weird applesauce (striped or crazy colored) my daughter will have a <br/>
fruit smoothie. It&#39;s all so unpleasant for us but we also know the <br/>
alternative is worse. Frankly I&#39;ll take any excuse to sip a homemade <br/>
strawberry shake!<br/>

<br/>
This may be off topic, but I have to say that yet another wonderful apect of homeopathy is that children love to take their medicine (the kid who doesn&#39;t is rare and you can always dissolve it in water), because it comes in the form of sugar pellets!<br/>
<br/>
I was mostly treated with homeopathy as a child, and the times when my father made me take antibiotcs I hated the way they made me feel. It was hard for me to believe that what he was giving me was meant to make me feel good! <br/>
<br/>
My dd has been treated homeopathically since she was a baby, never with antibiotics, Tylenols, etc. Kids respond wondefully to homeopathy because they&#39;re so vital and alive! And families who discover it see the magic effects of it and continue using it. It&#39;s a complete and profound system of medicine with no &quot;side effects.&quot;<br/>
Homeopathy is to health what unschooling is to education, and most people need to be de-schooled fom their old ways of perceiving health and disease.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought for those who want to stop struggling with this kind of stuff and keep their kids healthy.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, we&#39;ve not had the medicine issue yet cos while they&#39;ve had various things, chickenpox, measles, rubella etc etc, they&#39;ve never needed any medicine. Homeopathic remedies are tiony little sugar<br/>
pills and my main problem when they were young was *stopping* them taking them.<br/>
As for seat belts and helmets. I&#39;ve explained to them that it is the law. I am required to wear a seatbelt too so that helps. The helmet thingy is trickeir. VA law doesn&#39;t require me to wear one so I<br/>
don&#39;t (I know all the stats and arguments and I&#39;ve come down on the &#39;not wearing&#39; side) and UK law doesn&#39;t require helmets for cycling or skating. VA law requires all youg people under 14 to wear one.<br/>
My daughter is furious after years of biking without one. So I explained the law, pointed out that it is me that gets in trouble, not her. She now agrees to wear one but complains everytime. Cycle<br/>
helmets are badly designed for people wearing glasses.<br/>
<br/>
I personally think safety laws have gone mad in this country but thats a whole nother topic :-)<br/>
Actually, they are going mad in the UK too. Recently children were forbidden to make daisy chains and pick buttercups in school in case they picked up any bacteria. Ye gawds!<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know but if anyone has an answer, I sure could use it. Out of all 4<br/>
&gt; kids, my oldest is the only one that never gave me a problem with taking<br/>
&gt; meds. She&#39;s still good when she needs to take something. I have tried<br/>
&gt; everything with the other 3. I finally got the 7 and 8 year olds to take a<br/>

&gt; Everytime they get sick, it&#39;s a major stress time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Mikey (now 5) was a baby/toddler and the doctor would prescribe<br/>
something, I&#39;d have to grill the doctor on alternatives, because it was<br/>
simply impossible to give her oral medications. She drank only water (if you<br/>
mixed meds in she would not) and breastmilk from the breast. She ate only a<br/>
few things and would touch none of them when she was not feeling well,<br/>
getting nourishment only from nursing, so it was no good mixing the meds in<br/>
with any kind of food.<br/>
<br/>
In desperation I once poured a dose down her and made her swallow it (yes, I<br/>
am as capable of being an idiot as the next mom &lt;g&gt;) and Mikey looked at me<br/>
pityingly and then threw it up on me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, Mikey got over her ear infections with a little warmed garlic oil in the<br/>
ear, got past croup by being rocked in steamy bathrooms, and got over colds<br/>
with breastmilk and crossed fingers.<br/>
<br/>
If she had ever had something that was truly life-threatening-without-meds<br/>
they would have had to use an injection or an i.v. or whatever. And of<br/>
course no baby is going to choose such a thing and it&#39;s impossible to ask<br/>
their permission. This is where non-coercive and I part company. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Today, Mikey will take meds -- she&#39;s very stoic, but if she has pain, she&#39;ll<br/>
tell me, and if I suggest something (for example, for a pulled muscle a<br/>
chewable pain reliever) she&#39;ll take it.<br/>
<br/>
Brit (8) was easy to dose as a baby, and now extremely finicky about<br/>
medications and hates to take them. I let her decide and help her with<br/>
alternatives. If she gets very, very ill she does elect to take something<br/>
that will make her feel a bit better, so I have no fears that she would<br/>
refuse to do something about a hot appendix or other such scenario.<br/>

You&#39;re right, they don&#39;t mind taking the homeopathic pills. Unfortunately <br/>
though, the ones from the health food store didn&#39;t do squat for the kids and <br/>
I can&#39;t afford to take them to a homeopath which my ins. doesn&#39;t cover. <br/>
Especially when I have 4 kids who have been sick off and on for the past 6 <br/>
weeks with some kind of damn bug in our house. Last night the baby was sick <br/>
again when we all went to the circus. She&#39;ll take Dimetapp and today she is <br/>
just a bit stuffy. They haven&#39;t had anything but colds for the most part and <br/>
I just can&#39;t swing the whole family to a homeopath now from my own pocket.<br/>

No mold here. We have no basement and since we moved in a little over 2 <br/>
years ago, we&#39;ve had to renovate so much we would have seen it. In fact <br/>
we&#39;re still working and well with how I am, I look EVERYWHERE!!!<br/>
<br/>
Generally my kids are only sick with a small cold once a year. Generally <br/>
around Oct. or Nov. Been like that for years. Even with the oldest in <br/>
school, it&#39;s never been more than that. No ear infections or anything. But <br/>
this year, I don&#39;t know. Something has got a hold of us. I&#39;m hoping this is <br/>
the last of it for awhile. Of course my kids have been spending more time <br/>
than usual out and about and with other kids and my oldest is also working <br/>
too. Bringing something funky home!!!!<br/>

kids should wear helmets when sledding. How ridiculous can you get?!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726664299">When my ds was on an 10 day antibiotic regime we made a advent <br/>

door.  We filled it full of toys from the dollar store and candy and <br/>
anything we thought he&#39;d like.  It worked really well.<br/>
