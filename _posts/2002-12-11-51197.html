<div id="ygrps-yiv-150314039">Yeah.. attendance policies were a very sore spot with me too.  Students are <br/>
only allowed 8 absences ( for a class that meets every day) per semester.   <br/>
Well, with 4 children, my 8 days were eaten up by mid semester. I did all the <br/>
letter writing, ect too, and I also had an A average.. It didnt matter, if I <br/>
had missed one more day, i would hvae failed.  I just took my kids to school <br/>
with me.   I thought it was the most ridiculous policy.. to me ANY attendance <br/>
policy in college is ludicrous.  We PAY to take the course.. The school works <br/>
for the student, not vice versa.  If a student can master the material and <br/>
keep up thier GPA, why does it matter if they are in the room or not????   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was at a community college (late 60s) the policy was that it was your<br/>
responsibility to make up anything you missed.  If you missed an exam<br/>
because of an unexcused absence (not ill or anything) they could fail you on<br/>
that test.  I had a chance to take an extra week at spring break to meet my<br/>
father in Germany.  He was travelling for work in the Persian Gulf and had<br/>
never been back to Germany since he left at age 13.  None of the teachers<br/>
gave me any static about it or failed me on any tests . . . except my<br/>
*German* teacher.  She had never liked my free spirit, and she scheduled an<br/>
exam that week on purpose, so she could fail me on it . . . sigh.<br/>
