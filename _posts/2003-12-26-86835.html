Finally the headmistress put me in charge of unlocking the hall<br/>
and supervising the chair arranging for the daily morning assembly -<br/>
requiring me to be there half an hour before the rest of the school. I<br/>
remember feeling astonished. I was never late for school again, including<br/>
after that year was up.<br/>
That&#39;s interesting. So what was it in the new arrangement that got you there <br/>
on time? Suddenly you were able to plan ahead, or whatever was required, to <br/>
overcome the previously insurmountable misadventures. How come?<br/>

~~Now I &quot;have <br/>
to&quot; go warm up the coffee -- because I choose to have another cup.~~<br/>

Well, I &quot;have to&quot; heat it up if I want it warm. I could have had it cold, but <br/>
I chose to have it warm. I get the :) -- I get that you are kidding. But <br/>
there are times when a &quot;have to&quot; is just an expression. There are times when a <br/>
&quot;have to&quot; is a burden. It&#39;s nice people here are taking the time to help each <br/>
other -- but acknowledging the other person&#39;s point of view is helpful too. <br/>
Sometimes I just mean &quot;have to&quot; and am not complaining and the kids are not <br/>
complaining and I don&#39;t need help getting that phrase out of my life. Sometimes I <br/>
might need that help. Define and dissect all you want. Have fun! :) But <br/>
sometimes, really, as another poster wrote, &quot;A cigar is just a cigar.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe some people don&#39;t want to accept that -- and that&#39;s fine with me. <br/>
If, every time I write the words &quot;have to,&quot; you conjure a scene of how my life <br/>
is burdened, that is your choice. <br/>

What I, or anyone else, &quot;conjures up&quot; makes no difference.

No, but if someone&#39;s reaction to &quot;you don&#39;t *have* to&quot; is yes I do, I DO, I <br/>
DO HAVE TO!  that&#39;s a reaction that seems perhaps to be indicative of some <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771984819">It was the appalling idea of letting down the entire school if I was not<br/>
there. The &quot;insurmountable misadventures&quot; (fantastic phrase!) just<br/>
evaporated. I actually became so anxious to be on time, that I was generally<br/>
extra early. I guess there had never been a reason I cared about to just be<br/>
on time to deadly dull but compulsory assembly each day.<br/>

<br/>
People do use it that way but they do so at their own peril ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It helps people get the responses they expect (and keeps the list useful) if<br/>
people keep in mind that what they&#39;re sharing gets treated as examples of<br/>
the ideas/principles/philosophies of unschooling. If they use words casually<br/>
and imply something that will get interpretted in a way they don&#39;t intend,<br/>
then it&#39;s going to be held up to examination.<br/>
