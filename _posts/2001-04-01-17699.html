  writes:<br><br>&lt;&lt;&nbsp; Dh and I did try an herbal supplement for 
  &quot;active&quot; children to help his <br>neurotransmitters connect so stepson could 
  think better and control himself. <br>&gt;&gt;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I 
  ask what this herbal supplement was? I do not label my dd except to <br>say 
  she is a highly spirited individual. (that&#39;s an understatement lol)&nbsp; . 
  <br>Our concern is her inability to chill out. If she freaks over something 
  she <br>cannot unlock and it escalates. We are moving to a condo from a ranch 
  and I <br>am already tried of asking her to lower her voice or walk instead of 
  skip.&nbsp; <br>Dh is going to be beside himself the first night her nose is 
  bugging her and <br>she &quot;can&#39;t handle it&quot; &lt;------ her words and screams. I 
  use Rescue Remedy for <br>some things but not a lot. Also we tried Valerian 
  for sleep troubles but it <br>didn&#39;t seem to help.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
