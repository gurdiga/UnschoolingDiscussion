<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695611678">I just went through a divorce with a nasty ex who wanted to have custody<br/>
and based the fight on the fact that I home- school.  There are so many<br/>
really good statistics out that show that home- schooled children test<br/>
higher on standardized testing that your average public schooler.  It is<br/>
a very frightening situation but I think that if you present clear facts<br/>
as to the positives of home-schooling you have a pretty clear cut case.<br/>
If your children are under the age of 12(I am not sure about that) they<br/>
will not be allowed to testify in court so you should make sure that you<br/>
document the time you spend and the progress that your children are<br/>
making in their education.  I had pictures that my son has drawn and<br/>
pictures of us at museums etc.  We used those in court and I think that<br/>
it made a really big difference on the judge&#39;s decision in the end.  I<br/>
won and the judge gave my exclusive rights to the decisions on the<br/>
education of my son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46945207">You might also want to do stuff like tape mainstream programs that are<br/>
pro-homeschooling.  Don&#39;t know if the one tomorrow morning is going to be<br/>
pro or con, but you might want to tape Good Morning America and then if it<br/>
is good, keep it, if not, tape over it &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good thing to have plenty of supporting documentation.<br/>
