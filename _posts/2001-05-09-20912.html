<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623130404"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: &quot;Eileen M.&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ravensegg@...">ravensegg@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, under normal circumstances, breast milk is<br/>
&gt; designed for babies, and the female human breast is<br/>
&gt; designed to deliver that milk.  But for many reasons<br/>
&gt; some babies do not thrive on breast milk.  They may be<br/>
&gt; (as my son was) lactose intolerant *and* allergic to<br/>
&gt; milk.  Their mother may be eating something to which<br/>
&gt; they are allergic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, but the mother can stop eating what they are allergic to. Both my<br/>
kids are allergic to milk. Well, I haven&#39;t had any dairy products in a long<br/>
time, and I sure do miss my ice cream :-) but it&#39;s really not that big of an<br/>
issue. All that means is that *cow&#39;s* milk is not beneficial to babies, not<br/>
that mother&#39;s milk isn&#39;t. The only disease I am aware of that necessitates<br/>
total weaning is Galactosemia, an extremely rare metabolic disorder that<br/>
necessitates that the child be on a special diet for life. In this case, it<br/>
isn&#39;t so much of a case of mother&#39;s milk not being beneficial, but that the<br/>
baby has a genetic disease that prevents them from receiving proper<br/>
nutrition from many different sources.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They may be severely hypoglycemic<br/>
&gt; (again, as my son was) and the milk simply doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have enough sugars in it to keep them alive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>According to LLL:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Symptomatic hypoglycemia in newborns is largely due to delayed or<br/>
inadequate feeding and is more likely to occur when mother and baby are<br/>
separated after birth. Some newborns are given sugar water on the erroneous<br/>
assumption that this will prevent hypoglycemia. Instead, giving glucose<br/>
water causes a sudden rise in the blood glucose levels, which in turn<br/>
stimulates the secretion of insulin by the pancreas. The high level of<br/>
insulin results in an equally sudden drop in glucose levels. It is<br/>
interesting to note that the treatment for hypoglycemia in adults is small,<br/>
frequent, high-protein meals. That is exactly what the baby gets when he is<br/>
allowed to breastfeed on demand from birth.<br/>
<br/>
Immediate and frequent feedings of colostrum, preferably ten to twelve<br/>
feedings per day in the first few days, stabilize blood glucose levels.<br/>
Undiluted human milk is the best food, particularly for preterm infants. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In some hospital settings, newborns are at risk for developing hypoglycemia<br/>
even after an uneventful labor and delivery. Babies who are not fed soon<br/>
after birth, are left uncovered in a nursery warmer, or are left in a<br/>
nursery to cry, are under stress. As a result they use up their stores of<br/>
glucose and are at risk for developing hypoglycemia. It is important to put<br/>
the baby to the breast immediately after birth, make sure the baby is kept<br/>
warm and dry (preferably in the mother&#39;s arms), and not allow long<br/>
separations when the baby may be left to cry. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
and finally:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The best way to stabilize blood sugar and prevent hypoglycemia in all<br/>
infants is prompt and frequent feedings of colostrum and human milk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even if supplements need to be given - glucose, etc. the baby can still<br/>
benefit from breastfeeding. The supplements are a small addition to the<br/>
millions of beneficial properties of the breastmilk.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They may<br/>
&gt; be too weak to suck.  Their mothers may be unable, due<br/>
&gt; to stress, nutritional problems etc, to provide<br/>
&gt; sufficient breastmilk.  They may need a different<br/>
&gt; balance of nutrients for a variety of health reasons<br/>
&gt; than breast milk can provide.  They may be too<br/>
&gt; underdeveloped to process breastmilk.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But as per the original statements, all these babies would *benefit* from<br/>
breastfeeding. If they&#39;re too weak to suck, they can be supplemented with an<br/>
eyedropper and breastmilk until they gain their ability to suck -<br/>
breastfeeding (left undisturbed) is a relationship of many years, not just<br/>
the first few days, weeks, or months. If the mothers are unable to provide<br/>
sufficient breastmilk, that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother problem. Obviously the mothers<br/>
should be supported to the degree that they can provide breastmilk, but if<br/>
not that still doesn&#39;t mean that the baby wouldn&#39;t benefit from it, just<br/>
that the mom can&#39;t provide it. In many cases, a donor mother can provide<br/>
breastmilk (which can even be pasteurized) - this is less rare than you&#39;d<br/>
think. I&#39;ve both donated my breastmilk (to an adopted baby) and wet nursed a<br/>
friend&#39;s baby when she was in the hospital. If breastfeeding was more<br/>
supported, these alternates would be more common.<br/>
As for babies needing a different balance of nutrients than breastmilk<br/>
provides, the baby would still benefit from breastfeeding, perhaps enhanced<br/>
by the addition of whatever else breastmilk would be &quot;lacking&quot;. As<br/>
breastmilk contains over 400 ingredients that scientists have yet to<br/>
identify, and infant formulas contain about 20, I&#39;d be pretty suspect of<br/>
someone claiming that a formula could provide what breastmilk could not<br/>
(unless of course in the case of those rare disorders where the baby isn&#39;t<br/>
able to process some things, or where the baby needs something specific,<br/>
like glucose drops). In any case, it&#39;s a simple matter to supplement the<br/>
baby&#39;s diet in addition to providing the breastmilk. As for a baby being<br/>
underdeveloped to process breastmilk, research in the last decade has found<br/>
that this is rarely the case. The mother&#39;s milk actually *changes*<br/>
dramatically when a baby is born prematurely and is ideally suited for the<br/>
premature infant. Scientists now realize that breastmilk is the best food,<br/>
even for preemies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The majority of babies in the NICU my son was in could<br/>
&gt; not use breastmilk for one reason or another.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But this was 11 years ago, right? They have learned a lot about the benefits<br/>
of breastmilk for preemies in the time between then and now. Now mothers<br/>
with babies in the NICU are encouraged to pump and to put the baby to the<br/>
breast. The babies can be fed with eyedroppers or SNS (supplemental nursing<br/>
systems) to prevent nipple confusion. Every mom of a NICU baby that I&#39;ve<br/>
known in the last few years has been encouraged strongly to breastfeed as<br/>
preemies need breastmilk even more than full-term babies.  There is even a<br/>
book out now: &quot;Breastfeeding Your Premature Baby&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And<br/>
&gt; most babies will refuse the breast once they are<br/>
&gt; initiated on a bottle... the bottle provides faster<br/>
&gt; service with less work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the more reason that hospitals and new mothers should be aware that<br/>
there are alternatives to bottle feeding for babies who need supplementing.<br/>
Droppers, cups, tube and finger feeding, and SNS are just some of the<br/>
possibilities that will not induce nipple confusion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But it is a sweeping generality to say that *all*<br/>
&gt; children benefit from breast feeding in infancy.  Some<br/>
&gt; babies would die or fail to thrive from breast<br/>
&gt; feeding, so it is not factually the case that all<br/>
&gt; children benefit from breast feeding in infancy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say other than the genetic disease I mentioned above (in which case the<br/>
baby has a host of problems with food, not just breastmilk), *all* babies<br/>
would benefit from breastfeeding (even if it is just partial breastfeeding).<br/>
Breastmilk benefits babies in a thousand different ways, and the nutritional<br/>
aspect is just one of them. The white blood cells and disease protection,<br/>
the bonding, the suckling promoting healthy jaw development, the anti-cancer<br/>
properties of breastmilk are among the benefits that  a baby would get from<br/>
breastfeeding, even *if* they were among the very rare cases that also<br/>
needed supplementing with some other nutritional additive.  Typically,<br/>
babies that would die or fail to thrive would do so because of lack of<br/>
support and accurate information about breastfeeding.  A lot of that has<br/>
been dispensed by the medical profession in the last few decades of<br/>
dominance by the formula companies (See the book &quot;Milk, Money, and Madness&quot;<br/>
for a thorough treatment of that topic).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Need a lift back onto the soapbox?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, thanks :-)<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons that the breastfeeding soapbox is so important is that so<br/>
much misinformation has been given about breastfeeding. The World Health<br/>
Organization estimates that a *MILLION* babies die every year around the<br/>
world from *lack* of breastfeeding, including a whopping 10,000 here in the<br/>
(supposedly modern) United States. It is vitally important that mothers<br/>
receive accurate information about breastfeeding, and support to do so.<br/>
Fortunately, scientists and medical professionals are just starting to<br/>
realize how important breastfeeding is and how in almost all circumstances<br/>
it is possible and indeed necessary. Maybe someday we will see it supported<br/>
properly. I think it is one of the most vital health issues on this planet.<br/>
