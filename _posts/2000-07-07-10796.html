Sorry, but we are role players and Black Pudding is the name of an insidious and blobesque monster that dissolves/absorbs it&#39;s victims.    MMMmmmmmm......not just for breakfast anymore.  That is the only reference I have for Black Pudding.  I grew up in Northern California and, except for living beifly in VA, Kansas and the Southwest, have always lived in the Northwest.<br/>

Bacon over here is like, well, bacon, I suppose!  <br/>
Someone else could probably explain the difference <br/>
better...  I&#39;m not entirely sure what goes into black <br/>
pudding, like haggis, it&#39;s probably best to not know, <br/>
but it&#39;s a sausage with blood in, which makes it black. <br/>
 Fried bread is, well, bread, fried, ya know?  done in <br/>
the same pan as everything else, should come out nice <br/>
and crispy, and dripping &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s great for the <br/>
cholesterol levels... whaddya mean you&#39;re trying to <br/>
*reduce* your cholesterol???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the Bacon drippings or you can butter both sides sell and fry till<br/>
golden and crisp.<br/>
That&#39;s when I top each slice with an over easy egg and smash the yolks<br/>
so it drips and runs all over the fried bread.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;s a rare treat around here .... I get indigestion just drooling over<br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948236600">anyone on the Atkins diet or something similar can lick their lips, <br/>
everyone else can look away now...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
just slices of bread (white, of course &lt;g&gt;) fried in the pan after <br/>
everything else, otherwise it soaks all the oil up so you can&#39;t cook <br/>
the eggs properly &lt;g&gt; <br/>
