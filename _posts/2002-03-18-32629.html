<div id="ygrps-yiv-714366364"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;No matter what we do,  public school, school at home, or unschooling, Zack<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;will still reach the age of 18 with the same basic body of knowledge.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Not to nitpick, but that body of knowledge probably won&#39;t be exactly the<br/>
&gt;&gt;same. IMO the unschooled child&#39;s knowledge will be broader, more in-depth,<br/>
&gt;&gt;full of life, questioning and ever continuing. However, it may not contain<br/>
&gt;&gt;some of the facts, figures, outlines and dates that were forced on a<br/>
&gt;&gt;schooled child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He&#39;ll be able to read and write, compute numbers, have an idea of what has<br/>
&gt;occured over time (history), a general idea of how our society functions,<br/>
&gt;and a sense of the natural world. My opinion is that his attitude and<br/>
&gt;outlook on life may be VERY different depending on how he gets there. and<br/>
&gt;also his happiness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Basic knowledge. An interesting term and prolly one that is sought with <br/>
more definitions than &#39;homeschooling&#39; *smile*<br/>
<br/>
The particulars on acadamia never entered my mind. Reading happens <br/>
because its an essential part of getting through life. It just happens, <br/>
just as life does. <br/>
<br/>
Anything after that is a false sense of what the future holds. We do not <br/>
know what technology will invent. What planet we will might be <br/>
colonizing. If we give it all up and go back to farming communities. We <br/>
just don&#39;t know which directions or choices for options we will have in <br/>
the future.<br/>
<br/>
MY opinion of basic knowledge is being self-assured. Comfortable in one&#39;s <br/>
skin and adaptable to changes. Its an inner peace with the security that <br/>
facts are just a fingertip away. Its not for wanting/pining that which <br/>
you do not have, yet aspirations for a more comfortable lifestyle are not <br/>
invalid. Its the ability to be at home in any social setting because one <br/>
is at home with themselves. Its the inner peace that allows one to enjoy <br/>
the scope of emotions that life offers.. the happiness, the sadness, the <br/>
melancholy, the contentment, the anger, the love... life<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672172249">I think I would term what you described Kolleen, as &quot;an ease in life&quot; All<br/>
the stuff that children will learn as they grow will enable them to feel at<br/>
ease, have a sort of confidence.<br/>
The hard part that I have to face is the co-parents [of zack] that don&#39;t<br/>
understand any of what we see in children, what we hope to see grow and<br/>
bloom as our kids get older. I was trying to explain WHY I don&#39;t &quot;worry&quot;<br/>
about Zack like they do. The are religious school-at homer&#39;s that put Zack<br/>
in school as a bribe and to spite me. It&#39;s sad, especially since they would<br/>
never understand their own feelings about it. They are blinded.<br/>
I do worry about him, but for completely different reasons than they do. I<br/>
fear their way (the &quot;normal&quot; way) will harm him terribly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Elissa, this is very heartbreaking.. is Zack in school now? Or were you <br/>
able to get him out?<br/>
Do you guys have shared complete 50/50 custody? Are you trying to <br/>
deschool him on the days he&#39;s with you? Sorry to sound so nosey, its just <br/>
things like this really gets to me.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I don&#39;t know if this is a growing trend BUT I do know two <br/>
people personally that have lost custody for homeschooling (good ol&#39; boy <br/>
court club) and one who had to settle for Waldorf in order to keep <br/>
custody. This whole scenario upsets my core beleifs.<br/>
<br/>
One of my biggest contention with unschooling and parenting is that if <br/>
you don&#39;t have support, it can be like swimming upstream because the <br/>
sabatoging of one&#39;s efforts can only hurt the child(ren) involved.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hear you.  Same thing happened with my older son.  After a year and a <br/>
half of unschooling (at least as close as his dad would allow, I was forced <br/>
to put him back in school.  At 8 months pregnant, I didn&#39;t feel I could <br/>
handle a court battle, and Noah didn&#39;t want me to fight anymore.  Going <br/>
back to school was the worst thing that could have happened to him.  I hope <br/>
things work out better for Zack.<br/>

agree?  I hope it all works out for you.<br/>
