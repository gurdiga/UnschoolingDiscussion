&gt; &gt; Bryants lose court battle: Social Service now guardian of Waltham<br/>
children<br/>
&gt; &gt; in homeschooling case<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; By DeAnna Putnam<br/>
&gt; &gt; Friday, December 14, 2001<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; WALTHAM - The two children of George and Kim Bryant have been placed in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the custody of the Department of Social Services because their parents<br/>
refuse<br/>
&gt; &gt; to submit a home-schooling lesson plan to the Waltham School Department.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The children, Nyssa, 12, and George, 13, remain at home.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In the latest twist to a long-running dispute, Framingham Juvenile Court<br/>
&gt; &gt; Judge Kathryn White said that DSS will be the children&#39;s legal guardian<br/>
&gt; &gt; until they are 16. The Bryants can&#39;t take their children out of state.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In her decision, White noted that the children have not been abused and<br/>
&gt; &gt; their home life is good.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Bryants yesterday offered DSS area Director Margaret Monnie a lesson<br/>
&gt; &gt; plan to satisfy White&#39;s court order. But Monnie said she did not want<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; plan and that the couple should submit it to the Waltham School<br/>
&gt; Department.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Monnie told the Bryants that Waltham School officials will inform DSS if<br/>
&gt; &gt; the lesson plan is acceptable.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The School Committee, an elected board separate from the school<br/>
&gt; &gt; administration, has approved the couple&#39;s plan and said it would like<br/>
such<br/>
&gt; &gt; plans submitted every year.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Bryants yesterday went to the DSS office in Arlington to talk about<br/>
&gt; &gt; their case. An assistant area director said DSS had just been informed<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the judge&#39;s decision and had not yet assigned a caseworker.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The couple has battled with the School Committee and Waltham School<br/>
&gt; &gt; Department over home-schooling their children for five years.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The School Department this year filed a Care and Protection complaint<br/>
&gt; &gt; against the couple because they did not submit a lesson plan for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2000-2001 academic year.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Bryants say no law requires them to do so.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Waltham Assistant City Solicitor Howard Rock agrees that no law requires<br/>
&gt; &gt; the couple to submit a lesson plan, but he said the School Committee has<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; right to create legal requirements by its own authority.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To date, city attorneys have handled 16 cases related to the Bryants,<br/>
&gt; &gt; including cases the city has filed against the couple and counterclaims<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Bryants have filed against the city.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Bryants submitted a lesson plan three years ago when the city went<br/>
&gt; &gt; through similar measures to have custody of the children turned over to<br/>
&gt; DSS.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Monnie told the Bryants that DSS would insist on visiting the children<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt; home.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But White&#39;s order says &quot;home visits, however, may not be required for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; approval of a proposed home schooling plan. Home visits are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; presumptively essential to protect the state&#39;s interest in ensuring the<br/>
&gt; &gt; education of children.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Monnie told the Bryants it was obvious that they &quot;don&#39;t want to play the<br/>
&gt; &gt; game&quot; that the city of Waltham has set up for them regarding schooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; requirements.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; People who resist opposed norms sometimes are to be commended, Monnie<br/>
&gt; &gt; said, but for now, the state is requiring the couple to conform.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Although DSS had no part in bringing Care and Protection charges against<br/>
&gt; &gt; the couple, DSS has to comply with the court order, she said.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; George Bryant said he and his wife would drop off a lesson plan at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Waltham School Department by today.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, they are appealing White&#39;s decision, and pursuing other<br/>
&gt; &gt; complaints they have filed, because they feel their constitutional<br/>
rights<br/>
&gt; &gt; have been violated many times, George Bryant said. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008021768">Though I&#39;m from Mass I haven&#39;t been following this case on the state HSing<br/>
group&#39;s list because of the legalistic nitpicking. (It makes me realize why<br/>
people get fed up with unschooling nitpicking ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It seemed shockingly uncaring to me that MA homeschoolers weren&#39;t supporting<br/>
the Bryants but apparently their case is based around their contention that<br/>
the compulsory attendance law goes against state constitutionally guaranteed<br/>
parental rights so the law itself is unconstitutional. There&#39;s a hugely<br/>
steep learning curve involved in figuring out what in the world anyone is<br/>
talking about in order to try to decide if such a law can be (legally)<br/>
unconstitutional and if so whether it is and whether that really has<br/>
anything to do with the legalities of homeschooling in MA. Basically the<br/>
rallying cry is too muddled to get everyone to answer the call.<br/>
<br/>
(The Bryants stance is they don&#39;t have to submit an education plan to be<br/>
approved by the Superintendent since the compulsory attendance law is<br/>
unconstitutional. One of the problems that prevents people from rallying<br/>
around the case is that the education plan is not a much of a hoop to jump<br/>
through (I use Carol Narigon&#39;s which I can pass on if anyone&#39;s interested)<br/>
and the case law is very clear that the state can&#39;t dictate the manner of<br/>
education so unschooling is very easy in MA.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s been a good summary of the two Mass homeschooling points of view on<br/>
the case and why the Bryants aren&#39;t being backed universally by<br/>
homeschoolers in MA on the MHLA email list. (The second list has had many<br/>
ongoing discussions about it and others.)<br/>
<br/>
masshomelearningassoc at Yahoo Groups (supposedly the MHLA list for<br/>
nonpolitical homeschooling discussions but a good summary)<br/>
MAhomeschoolers at Yahoo Groups (the MHLA list for political talk)<br/>
<br/>
Whether the Bryants have helped the homeschooling atmosphere in Mass as they<br/>
claim, or hindered as MHLA claims, apparently no real changes can happen if<br/>
the foundation of the changes keeps coming back to the argument of whether<br/>
to work with what is there (compulsory attendance laws and others) or<br/>
whether that&#39;s ridiculous because the laws are unconstitutional. :-/<br/>
<br/>
The scary/sad part is the DSS involvement in what is by-the-legal-book<br/>
educational neglect and therefore child neglect, but which doesn&#39;t match<br/>
reality since the kids are clearly being well educated. (They probably know<br/>
a lot more about law than a lot of lawyers!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092869313">I thought their stance was that they didn&#39;t have to submit an <br/>
education plan because it wasn&#39;t required by law, and that the school <br/>
district was requiring what was above and beyond the law. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I agree that compulsory education laws are unconstitutional <br/>
and I support all attempts to have them declared as so.  I just didn&#39;t <br/>
realize that was the case in the Bryant situation.<br/>
