<div id="ygrps-yiv-647525341">Hi everyone!  We are an unschooling family with a single daughter age 11 1/2 that has always unschooled.<br/>
We feel that life is filled with things to learn at every moment and that it is the decisions we make in regard to this challenge that create our experience.  Sometimes we feel a bit in the minority as we have a single child and the world at large usually has more than one.  It is funny to write this because at the moment dd is at The Hulbert Homeschool Camp in Vermont this week.  Our interests include; organic gardening, eco-villages, holistic health, simple living, earth-based spirituality, puppetry, alternative building, contra-dancing, folk festivals/music, world music, drumming, ritual, sacred space, sustainable living, flower essences, herbs, Reiki,  magical gardening, sewing, ornithology, astrology....just what comes to mind at the moment.   My daughter and husband just returned from a trip to China with her martial arts school which was an opportunity of a lifetime.  My dh takes gong fu as well as my dd and I take Tai Chi/Qi Gong.  I am a massage therapist, RN.  My husband and I are Reiki Masters and my dd has taken the 2nd level of Reiki.  My dream at the moment is to create a learning center here at my home.  We live on 3 acres that borders a State Forest...we would like to facilitate holistic connection to the earth as well as holistic health practices.   So, that&#39;s a not so brief into. of our family and I look forward to connecting with others committed to unschooling in their families.<br/>
Peace<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750897880">lol - I know I&#39;ve got plenty of time.  Florida doesn&#39;t require<br/>
registration until the age of 6.  And the choice for him to learn now<br/>
isn&#39;t my choice, believe me.  We&#39;ve discussed homeschooling together (as<br/>
much as you can with a 4 year old), and he is all excited about it.  He<br/>
has been dying to go to school since he first heard it existed, and the<br/>
thought that he could do it every day at home has put a very bright<br/>
gleam in his eyes.<br/>
 <br/>
So, the first thing he said he wanted to do, when asked, was learn how<br/>
to read.  At 4.  lol...   I don&#39;t know what I was expecting him to say,<br/>
but learning to read was not it.  The worksheets and things I&#39;ll be<br/>
getting are only to help him learn how to read.  Well, to supplement us<br/>
reading together.  Beyond that I&#39;m not going to spend the extra money on<br/>
anything like worksheets and like items.  At least not right now.<br/>
 <br/>
And yes, four is young.  You are right, we have all the time in the<br/>
world, but when he is coming to me and asking to learn _____ (it may<br/>
change at any moment), I can&#39;t say no.<br/>
 <br/>
I just hope no one&#39;s getting the wrong idea here.  I&#39;m not pushing him;<br/>
he&#39;s dragging me!<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;  My husband and I are looking into<br/>
homeschooling.  Well, a combination of home- and un- schooling to be<br/>
more accurate.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone might have beat me to this, but you might as well get the full new <br/>
member treatment.<br/>
<br/>
The best unschoolers don&#39;t believe there CAN be partial unschooling. <br/>
(By &quot;best&quot; I mean those for whom unschooling has come to work well, not <br/>
dabblers.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He would probably benefit greatly from unschooling, but I<br/>
need slightly more structure, at least until I&#39;ve finished deprogramming<br/>
myself from the years of schooling I went through.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about what you need.  <br/>
Until it&#39;s about what your child needs, you won&#39;t be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t &quot;deprogram&quot; yourself by clinging to school stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Until you see learning where school stuff is not, you won&#39;t get unschooling <br/>
at a gut and soul level.<br/>
<br/>
Here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about deschooling parents (and not continuing to &quot;school&quot; kids while <br/>
you do it).<br/>
<br/>
If schooling needs to be undone, why lay more on him which will have to be <br/>
undone?  <br/>
<br/>
Just say no.  No more school-style stuff.  If it worked, why wouldn&#39;t you <br/>
have him in school?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, for now we&#39;re<br/>
doing a mix of the two - letting him choose what he wants to learn at<br/>
the moment, and me helping him learn with worksheets, field trips,<br/>
games, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Field trips have the potential to be non-harmful.  Depends how much <br/>
teacher-voice you use while you&#39;re there.  Do you go to a museum with him the <br/>
same way you would go to the museum with an adult friend?  Or do you take him <br/>
to a museum the way a teacher takes a child to a museum?<br/>
<br/>
Games aren&#39;t teaching, or don&#39;t need to be.  Games you should put in the <br/>
unschooling column.<br/>
<br/>
Worksheets...   If you put a workbook out and don&#39;t check back to see whether <br/>
he did it, the workbook won&#39;t jump up and bite him, and he might have fun <br/>
with it.  If you have a series of worksheets designed to teach him math or <br/>
phonics, you might find you are teaching him to avoid anything that looks <br/>
like math or phonics.  Or you might be teaching him that those are things he <br/>
has to be taught, that don&#39;t exist outside of worksheets.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;At least I know by now that anything can be a learning<br/>
experience, if you approach it the right way.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a learning experience even if you approach it &quot;the wrong way.&quot;<br/>
Everything is a learning experience.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We are just starting out on the home/un schooling path, although it<br/>
feels like we&#39;ve been doing this all along anyway. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point!  So don&#39;t change.  Kids have been learning since birth, because <br/>
humans are programmed to learn, so the best thing you can do is provide them <br/>
with opportunities and input and experience and not mess up their natural <br/>
learning!<br/>
<br/>
If you like structure, reorganize your spices, or make a birthday calendar <br/>
and buy cards for everyone for the coming year and start putting clippings or <br/>
little stickers inside the envelopes of various individuals.  Alphabetize <br/>
your shoes.  Do something that doesn&#39;t hinder your kids, to fulfill your need <br/>
for structure and organization.<br/>

<br/>
Okay.  That&#39;s different.<br/>
<br/>
But answering his questions when he asks about something isn&#39;t the same as <br/>
structured homeschooling.   You&#39;ll figure out how to anwer the questions <br/>
conversationally and not teacher-style.  Just be aware of the tone and intent <br/>
and expectation in you when he asks, and of how you feel about your duty and <br/>
responsibility to &quot;teach.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
When a little kid asks where babies come from, they don&#39;t want to know all <br/>
about the human reproductive system, marriage customs,  fertility problems, <br/>
sexual positions... they want a very short answer, like &quot;From inside their <br/>
moms.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;OH!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it might be an hour or five years before they come back and ask how it <br/>
got in there.  And even then, they don&#39;t want to know all about the human <br/>
reproductive system, marriage customs,  fertility problems, sexual <br/>
positions...<br/>
<br/>
So if a child wants to read, you can write two or three words down that he <br/>
knows and can recognize by the beginning letter (like names of family members <br/>
or pets or fictional characters they like) and let them &quot;read&quot; those a while <br/>
until they want more.<br/>

your family, chock full of pictures, AND, it takes TONS of organization <br/>
because of *all* the *stuff* available, and getting all/what pics together <br/>

When a little kid asks where babies come from,  <br/>
 <br/>
lol - We just went through this one, as a matter of fact...  Grady and I<br/>
are preparing to have another one (not in the oven yet, but close), and<br/>
we are including Orin from the beginning so that hopefully he will be<br/>
prepared for the changes that will come about from two kids in the house<br/>
(he&#39;s an only child right now).  He has already picked what room the<br/>
baby will have (he suggested his room, so we get to move his things into<br/>
the spare room and make it his).  <br/>
 <br/>
When he asked where baby&#39;s come from, my belly was the answer.  He did<br/>
go a step further and ask how it got into my belly, which was unexpected<br/>
to say the least.  So, for now, baby&#39;s come from &quot;Momma Nature&quot;, who<br/>
puts them into a mommy&#39;s belly where it can grow until it&#39;s ready to be<br/>
born.  lol - I think his curiosity was filled at that point and he went<br/>
back to playing his computer game...<br/>
 <br/>
So if a child wants to read, you can write two or three words down that<br/>
he <br/>
knows and can recognize by the beginning letter (like names of family<br/>
members <br/>
or pets or fictional characters they like) and let them &quot;read&quot; those a<br/>
while <br/>
until they want more. <br/>
 <br/>
Oh, he already knows his name.  And my name, daddy&#39;s name, and a few<br/>
other &quot;basic&quot; words (thank goodness for PBS..lol) But he wants to be<br/>
able to read his books by himself.  Well, more accurately he wants to be<br/>
able to read to us...lol<br/>

Ok, a case of tomAto/tomato.  I don&#39;t want to be a &quot;best unschooler&quot;, I<br/>
want to give my child the best education I can, which is *not* going to<br/>
happen in a structured school environment. I say this not only from my<br/>
own personal experience, but from what I&#39;ve seen in my son.  If others<br/>
see us a dabbling, well - others will see us however they choose to.<br/>

 <br/>
If anyone has gotten the impression that my child&#39;s need and wishes<br/>
won&#39;t be first and foremost, then consider yourself corrected. <br/>

Yes, I do need to feel organized.  If I ever want to take over his<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m confused. If you see unschooling as making sense and working, why<br/>
wouldn&#39;t you want to be the best at it?? It&#39;s to the benefit of your child,<br/>
not anyone else. And Sandra said to be the best meant doing it so that it<br/>
works well. Who wouldn&#39;t want that? It&#39;s like they say on this list, you<br/>
can&#39;t unschool everything but math. You either do it or you don&#39;t. If you<br/>
don&#39;t, then don&#39;t say you unschool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Who said we were going to change?  I might have been assumed, but then<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think if you have the feeling that we are telling you what is right for<br/>
you child, then you need to ask to clarify what&#39;s been said. People here<br/>
have years of experience. They are the best unschoolers and just relay what<br/>
works and what doesn&#39;t through their own experience. They give advice when<br/>
asked and impart great wisdom when situations come up that they see as not<br/>
being unschooling. That&#39;s what the list is for. Not to say good job to<br/>
someone who doesn&#39;t unschool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Okay, we will be leaving soon to go to a Spiral Scout meeting - if<br/>
anyone else has any pearls of wisdom for me fire them at will.  I<br/>
expected to draw some fire...lol&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now I get the impression that you enjoy not unschooling on a unschooling<br/>
list. You&#39;re dabbling among people who don&#39;t want to dabble. You wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
the first person to say you unschool and don&#39;t restrict and that your kids<br/>
really want to learn all this stuff only to find out that you are on the<br/>
same road, just going in a different direction.<br/>

Maybe.  I think its calling a persimmon a tomato.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t want to give your children an education if you want to create an <br/>
unstructured environment.  You want to help them learn.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Giving an education&quot; implies insertion.  <br/>
It suggests that you know in advance the block of knowledge you intend to <br/>
insert.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531684856">I have to say that I agree with Sunny a lot and can empathize with her feelings. It is difficult beginning this process of figuring out what is the best thing for our children and then coming here, being honest and being totally shot down at every turn. I guess I realize as I get older and have been a parent longer that people are going to disagree with me and that is just the way it is, that&#39;s ok, I just try to disagree with people in a respectful courteous way. I really don&#39;t think that Sunny is a bad parent for trying to be structured in some ways. I think she is an honest person. There are things that I would do from an unschooling perspective and then are things that I feel that I would need to do in a more structured way (I am going to get really attacked for saying that, I know go ahead). There are things that I learned in school that were extremely damaging and negative but my entire experience in school was not traumatic and terrible. I learned some very insightful things in school and had some wonderful teachers along the way. I just don&#39;t think it has to be so black and white, but hey, what do I know?

Someone might have beat me to this, but you might as well get the full<br/>
new member treatment. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s to be expected...lol <br/>
<br/>
The best unschoolers don&#39;t believe there CAN be partial unschooling. (By<br/>
&quot;best&quot; I mean those for whom unschooling has come to work well, not<br/>
dabblers.) <br/>
<br/>
Ok, a case of tomAto/tomato.  I don&#39;t want to be a &quot;best unschooler&quot;, I<br/>
want to give my child the best education I can, which is *not* going to<br/>
happen in a structured school environment. I say this not only from my<br/>
own personal experience, but from what I&#39;ve seen in my son.  If others<br/>
see us a dabbling, well - others will see us however they choose to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We are just starting out on the home/un schooling path, although it<br/>
feels like we&#39;ve been doing this all along anyway. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point!  So don&#39;t change.  Kids have been learning since birth,<br/>
because humans are programmed to learn, so the best thing you can do is<br/>
provide them with opportunities and input and experience and not mess up<br/>
their natural learning! <br/>
<br/>
Who said we were going to change?  I might have been assumed, but then<br/>
again the welcome I&#39;ve received so far as been full of &quot;well, that not<br/>
the right way to do it for your child&quot;, or at least that&#39;s the feeling<br/>
I&#39;ve been getting.  It doesn&#39;t affect me one way or the other; I&#39;ve<br/>
always been a poor communicator of my true intentions, so I expect other<br/>
to not understand what I&#39;m trying to say (and to usually see it in the<br/>
worst light possible)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has gotten the impression that my child&#39;s need and wishes<br/>
won&#39;t be first and foremost, then consider yourself corrected. <br/>
<br/>
If you like structure, reorganize your spices, or make a birthday<br/>
calendar and buy cards for everyone for the coming year and start<br/>
putting clippings or little stickers inside the envelopes of various<br/>
individuals.  Alphabetize your shoes.  Do something that doesn&#39;t hinder<br/>
your kids, to fulfill your need for structure and organization. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do need to feel organized.  If I ever want to take over his<br/>
learning experiences I can try one of these suggestions.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, we will be leaving soon to go to a Spiral Scout meeting - if<br/>
anyone else has any pearls of wisdom for me fire them at will.  I<br/>
expected to draw some fire...lol<br/>

&gt; Hello all!  My name is Sunny, and I was schooled as a child.  I promise,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m getting better...lol<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome, so were most of us here. It might take some time to shake all that<br/>
out of your head, but fortunately as unschoolers we get a lot of time to do<br/>
just that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husband and I are looking into<br/>
&gt; homeschooling.  Well, a combination of home- and un- schooling to be<br/>
&gt; more accurate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure there is such a thing as a combination. I&#39;m sure if you hang out<br/>
here for awhile you&#39;ll understand what I mean (esp. as there are plenty of<br/>
people here far more eloquent on this subject). Unschooling is about having<br/>
the faith that your child will choose the experiences they need to learn<br/>
from, and respecting those choices. You can&#39;t simultaneously do that and<br/>
also think that they need to be taught anything.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our little one, Orin, learns better when he moves at his<br/>
&gt; own pace.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think all of us would say the same thing!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He would probably benefit greatly from unschooling, but I<br/>
&gt; need slightly more structure, at least until I&#39;ve finished deprogramming<br/>
&gt; myself from the years of schooling I went through.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, the great news is that you have plenty of years to do that. I&#39;d<br/>
suggest hitting the library and checking out any and all books by John Holt,<br/>
Grace Llewellyn, & John Taylor Gatto for starters. They made gret reading<br/>
material when I was nursing my first babe. By the time he was old enough for<br/>
me to start meddling in his learning, I knew enough not to.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I bet you&#39;ll find that Orin will do just fine if you just<br/>
let him lead himself down whatever road he chooses. And this list can be a<br/>
great source of wisdom along the way.<br/>

 <br/>
I stated the truth in the beginning - we will be doing a cross between<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please consider not BUYING anything at all to help him learn to read. <br/>
After many years of intense interest in how children learn to read, I <br/>
am firmly convinced that early reading instruction increases the <br/>
probability of later reading problems. A child who is ready to read at <br/>
4 (or 5 or 6 or ....) will DRAW the help he/she needs out of you - it <br/>
doesn&#39;t take ANY special materials - just a lot of print materials in <br/>
his/her environment. You&#39;d be WAY better off to just get a copy of Jim <br/>
Trelease&#39;s New Read-Aloud Handbook and maybe Peggy Kaye&#39;s &quot;Games for <br/>
Reading,&quot; for ideas of word-based fun.<br/>
<br/>
When my little ones said they wanted to learn to read, I&#39;d ask them, <br/>
&quot;What words do you want to read?&quot;  They&#39;d tell me the words, &quot;dinosaur&quot; <br/>
and &quot;umbrella&quot; and other words. I&#39;d write them on index cards and <br/>
they&#39;d decorate them. We kept them in a special envelope in a special <br/>
place and they would pull them out and practice &quot;reading&quot; them whenever <br/>
they wanted. They&#39;d add to the words when a special word came up.<br/>
<br/>
I had one of my children who learned to read at 3 1/2 years old - so it <br/>
isn&#39;t like I didn&#39;t have an early reader, I&#39;m obviously not saying that <br/>
it isn&#39;t possible. But that was with NO workbook pages and NO <br/>
instruction - just answering questions and having fun with rhyming <br/>
games and a LOT of reading aloud and being surrounded by books and <br/>
completely and totally letting the child lead the way. HOW would a 4 yo <br/>
ever know to ASK for workbook pages - they shouldn&#39;t be in his <br/>
vocabulary.<br/>

workbook pages to teach him to read. If you didn&#39;t expect to get pretty <br/>
negative feedback about that, then you clearly didn&#39;t take the welcome <br/>
notice to the list seriously - you haven&#39;t been reading for a while <br/>
before posting, right? If you had, you&#39;d have known what to expect. So <br/>
- maybe you should read for a while. You have LOTS of time - there is <br/>
no hurry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems like most on the list that have spoken up so far disagree with<br/>
&gt; almost everything I&#39;ve tried to say.  Fine, disagree all you want to.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not looking for approval or disapproval, but do whatever makes you<br/>
&gt; feel better - neither will help me or my child so I&#39;m not giving it any<br/>
&gt; attention.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Too bad to not even listen and consider...I wish you would. You can <br/>
always reject anything here- nobody can enforce anything. It is all <br/>
just free offerings of ideas and experience and nobody stands to gain <br/>
anything whether you use the ideas and benefit from the experience or <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would help if you read posts out loud in the sweetest voice <br/>
you can imagine. People here are SUPER kind and gentle folks -  hearing <br/>
these posts in a harsh or critical tone of voice would change them from <br/>
what is intended.<br/>

Think think think think think before you do anything at all <br/>
&quot;school-like&quot; to your child. You are new at this and your child is SO <br/>
young. How about, in honor of the MANY years of combined experience of <br/>
some of us on this list, you postpone anything that seems remotely <br/>
&quot;school-like&quot; for 6 months and, in the meantime, you agree to read some <br/>
recommended books and to spend a lot of time carefully observing your <br/>
son with unschooling ideas in mind?<br/>

I know I&#39;ll get reamed for saying this, but I think the above is much better <br/>
advice than getting jumped all over, to a newbie. Why? Not because the <br/>
jumped-all-over things that were said aren&#39;t true, but because people don&#39;t <br/>
hear very well when they&#39;re pounced on, and have things shoved down their <br/>
throat. (Do our kids learn that way? Isn&#39;t that why we unschool? I&#39;ve heard <br/>
we should treat our kids like we would adults, but maybe, *if we want to be <br/>
heard*, we should treat adults like we do our kids.) I would venture to say <br/>
that the reason &#39;oldies&#39; post here is to educate others about unschooling. (I <br/>
believe I remember reading a post that this is not a support group.) I would <br/>
also venture to say that the above will be heard better than anything so far <br/>
that&#39;s been said to her. And isn&#39;t that why *oldies in-the-know* are here? To <br/>
be heard, and to help kids? It just seems to me that it would be done in a <br/>
way that all the wisdom hear is *heard*.    Lara.........</div>

 </span></blockquote>This *is* a challenging list! That&#39;s why the suggestion to read for a couple<br/>
of weeks is in the introduction. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think many people see a list as a place where the members come to kick<br/>
back and relax for some adult conversation. But this list isn&#39;t one of<br/>
those. It&#39;s a place where people can find help to get where they imply they<br/>
want to go by signing up -- unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Our society has filled us with all sorts of screwy notions about what<br/>
children need in terms of learning and parenting. This is a place where<br/>
people can find help in recognizing when they&#39;re doing things &quot;just because&quot;<br/>
and getting rid of that thinking so they can get to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately the list is for our children rather than for us.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than think of the list as a conversation between you and a bunch of<br/>
people, think of it as like a free magazine. When you ask a question, you<br/>
get a dozen articles by different authors on the same topic. And those<br/>
articles in response to your question go out to everyone, not just to you.<br/>
Not every author will have a style that speaks to you or have information<br/>
you can use. So you skip theirs. Why not? It&#39;s free! The only investment<br/>
you&#39;re making is your time so why waste your time on authors and articles<br/>
that don&#39;t help you? But the authors you skip may be saying things in<br/>
exactly the way that someone else needed to hear. Someone else may be<br/>
skipping the ones you found most helpful.<br/>
