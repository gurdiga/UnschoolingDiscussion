<div id="ygrps-yiv-213666382">hello everyone, i would like to say that i would love to learn more about unschooling, but i may not be a total complete unschooler..but i think i can learn something from the people here..i would like to learn more, as i have already learned much from this group..but sometimes i get the feeling that this group only wants people that are 100% unschoolers, not people that are learning and becoming unschoolers...when i first started homeschooling, i bought a curriculum.. one of those comprehensive jobs... now i dont use anything like that...but i am evolving in my beliefs and actions as a parent....sometimes i even dont like the word &quot;school&quot; and when people start asking me if school has started at my home yet, i want to get on my soap box..lol i dont like living in a society that is dictated by the government school..HOWEVER, i try to treat people with respect that dont think like me and i try to ever so gently educate them of my way of thinking..and slowly, many people i know have<br/>
 come around... <br/>
my point? i just think that so many of you have so much to offer me, but i am afraid to express myself, for fear that i wont be accepted... but u guys are really valuable.... sometimes my feelings are hurt, but i keep reading..cuz there is still so much meat here<br/>
now you&#39;re asking yourself, what is her point? lol  <br/>
to finally get to my point, im asking the people on the list to be very patient with those of us that are coming around.. be gentle.. we ARE getting it! please dont get angry with us, and dont judge us harshly if we are &quot;on the fence&quot; we gotta fall one way or the other soon enough... please keep expressing your opinions but please be understanding with those of us who havent read all of john gatto or john holt or homegrown kids or whatever...u all have made a difference in my life..and my approach to living in a family unit...thank you for all you have given into my life, marybeth<br/>

<br/>
Patience abounds here.<br/>
Some folks have been here for years answering the same questions again<br/>
and again.  <br/>
<br/>
The very best way for you to get what you need from this or any list is<br/>
to ask questions and use the answers you like.    Ignore the answers you<br/>
don&#39;t like.  No one will even know you&#39;re ignoring their advice unless<br/>
you make it a point to tell them it sucked.&lt;g&gt;    That advice you don&#39;t<br/>
care for and can&#39;t use might be the very thing someone else is looking<br/>
for.   You can just leave it dangling out there for the scavengers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The very best way to inspire people to be nice to you is to NOT come in<br/>
saying, - you guys aren&#39;t very nice sometimes.-  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Have you posted before?  <br/>
Welcome, and ask away. <br/>

I think your post was wonderful and open and appropriately honest. I think <br/>
when we know the place one another is coming from it is much easier to <br/>
understand where the roads can lead and to share our experiences on the roads we <br/>
travelled. I appreciate your wanting to learn more and saying so, I appreciate you <br/>
being clear about being on the fence and I hope you will gain nothing but great <br/>
things here.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck, <br/>

Hi, Marybeth --<br/>
<br/>
Being on the fence is fine with me.  It&#39;s perfectly understandable that <br/>
moving to unschooling is a major life change.  I think what people here <br/>
are trying to express, that is not always understood or accepted, is <br/>
that we don&#39;t think people on the fence should encourage other people on <br/>
or near the fence to *stay* on the fence.<br/>
<br/>
If this were a swimming list, the people in the water might coax the <br/>
people on the side of the pool &quot;come on in, the water&#39;s fine&quot; but it <br/>
would be rather strange if people on the side of the pool were coaxing <br/>
the swimmers to come out of the water.  :-)  That would be more <br/>
appropriate on a sunbathing list or a staying-dry list than on a <br/>
swimming list.<br/>
<br/>
On a swimming list one can assume that everyone wants to learn about <br/>
swimming.  On an unschooling list one assumes that everyone wants to <br/>
learn about unschooling.  If someone on the fence or on the side decides <br/>
this list is too wet and splashy and they&#39;d rather stay dry, that&#39;s <br/>
fine.  But hauling other people out of the pool and telling them to &quot;dry <br/>
up&quot; wouldn&#39;t be fine. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I figure some fence sitters may decide that they don&#39;t like this list. <br/>
That&#39;s honestly okay.  I don&#39;t think one list can meet the list needs of <br/>
everyone. People are too diverse for that. In the online community you <br/>
may have to &quot;kiss a lot of toads&quot; &lt;g&gt; before you find a list that you <br/>
can fall in love with.<br/>
<br/>
