<div id="ygrps-yiv-160625301">My DH was the one that started this whole thing by being uncomfortable about<br/>
breastfeeding. We have talked about positives/negatives of it, and he knows<br/>
all the feelings expressed here. I truly feel that he would be more confused<br/>
by this than if he were to just walk in to my blatant disregard of his<br/>
feelings, and was nursing. I cannot speak for the reasons that my DH would<br/>
rather I not nurse, only that we have discussed it (in length) and that we<br/>
have agreed on expressing milk for the baby. Is that not the next best<br/>
thing? Not one person has even complemented him on that decision. I just<br/>
wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he may<br/>
have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire process<br/>
has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant without a<br/>
medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has been a<br/>
joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>
feeding? I hope that since this is my DH we are speaking about, that this<br/>
would now go to the dead topic section, for it is a finished topic in our<br/>
home.<br/>
Thank you for all your opinions-<br/>
