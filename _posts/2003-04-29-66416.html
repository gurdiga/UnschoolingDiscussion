<br/>
&lt;&lt; Regular homeschool <br/>
curriculum conferences have a ready, built-in market. They&#39;ll ALL sell TONS <br/>
of merchandise---guaranteed. That&#39;s one of the main reasons for attendees to <br/>
GO!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even worse, and those of you to whom this structure and religious <br/>
homeschooling stuff is new, brace yourselves:<br/>
<br/>
There are many people who go to a conference and pay a special fee which ONLY <br/>
gives them access to the vendor room.  Sometimes it&#39;s as little as $10.  I <br/>
heard a couple of days ago of one charging something like $60 to get in to <br/>
see vendors.    <br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t even go to one single talk or presentation or workshop.  They&#39;re <br/>
not there to meet other homeschoolers.  Some of them fear to meet other <br/>
homeschoolers.  Their mission is clear, and their path is narrow and upright. <br/>
 They buy what they&#39;re told to buy, browse the extra stuff, spend their <br/>
year&#39;s worth of money, and go back home.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have a good estimate on what an upper-range amount would be for a <br/>
full curriculum and some recommended &quot;literature&quot; or &quot;historical fiction&quot; <br/>
would be in such cases?  <br/>

Me! Me!  I know!  How about upwards of $1,000 for Sonlight?  Hack, hack.  <br/>
They *tell* you how wonderful they are in allowing you to purchase their <br/>
book recommendations at used bookstores or through the library.  What they <br/>
don&#39;t point out well enough is that many of their books are self-published.  <br/>
Even books you may find elsewhere.  They use *specific* books, ie. copyright <br/>
dates, etc., so what they don&#39;t make fully clear is that their manuals are <br/>
geared by page numbers.  [Lesson 1: read lines 17-35 on page 26 in so and <br/>
so.]So if you bought the exact same book by the exact same author but if it <br/>
is in big print, by a different publisher or a different copyright date, the <br/>
manuals will have your head spinning.<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing is set up so that you have to work 90 million times harder <br/>
to save yourself some money.  And they aren&#39;t in the slightest bit ashamed <br/>
of that fact!  They are more than proud to admit it!  Shameful, if you ask <br/>
me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520003506">I learned about that one (sonlight) the hard way.. I spent about 98 percent<br/>
of the time organizing and re-organizing just to have it &quot;fit&quot; us until we<br/>
gave it up and just read the books..lol.  I recently went through my &quot;we<br/>
need structure&quot; episode and almost bought the Oak Meadow which would end up<br/>
costing us around 1200. Yikes!  The more I &quot;listen&quot; to this group, the more<br/>

others (relatives, community, etc.).  I love this list. :)<br/>

use a computer. <br/>
<br/>
I was looking for price ranges of school at home, but instead found an <br/>
interesting and entirely unqualified statement.   .7!  83.7.<br/>
<br/>
Since nobody knows how many people homeschool and the counting would be <br/>
vastly different from state to state even if we COULD count (the definition <br/>
changes)...  that count is based on something very limited.  But it was <br/>
presented as a carefully counted fact.  Not &quot;over 80%&quot; nor even &quot;83%,&quot; but <br/>

didn&#39;t they? <br/>
<br/>
peace, HeidiC who never has used a boughten curriculum<br/>
p.s. I&#39;m appalled at the cost of Sonlight. It&#39;s nearly as much as K12 <br/>
which price includes paints and clay and plasticene and art paper and <br/>
tissue and all the books...ugh. Getting a sick stomach</div>

the numbers you&#39;re can find to work with.<br/>
<br/>
I had a *really* tough time grasping the concept in engineering that you<br/>
can&#39;t have greater accuracy than your least accurate piece of data. It just<br/>
went against 12 years of indoctrination that the more decimal places you had<br/>
the better your answer was. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
Most of the expense of Sonlight is for the books. Real books. Good books.<br/>
Usborne. DK. Good literature. They do have a curriculum to guide people<br/>
through the books but it isn&#39;t a major portion of the expense. And they<br/>
encourage you to get the books from your library or other sources.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the 6-9 curriculum for Social Science:<br/>

*    6A20: The Second Mrs. Giaconda - $4.99<br/>
*    6A21: Anna and the King - $4.95<br/>
*    6A22: Number the Stars - $5.99<br/>
*    6B01: International Children&#39;s Bible Handbook - $12.99<br/>

<br/>
*I* want to read a lot of those books! ;-) In fact I have read some of them.<br/>
<br/>
They are fundamentalist Christians so the choices reflect that, but they<br/>
have a page explaining why they recommend fantasy and other things that many<br/>
fundamentalists shun.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about the Instructor&#39;s Guide but I like what I read at<br/>
the site and got their catalog for many years. I&#39;ve read their philosophy<br/>
and admire it even if it isn&#39;t my philosophy. I&#39;ve recommended them often<br/>
when Christian non-unschoolers are trying to decide between Abeka and Bob<br/>
Jones :-P<br/>

  &lt;&lt; Can you IMAGINE all you could do for ONE child with that much money??  <br/>
  **Season** tickets to museums, zoos, amusement parks, the theater, the <br/>
  opera, a PS2 WITH games, a shopping spree at a used book store, rec center <br/>
  classes...ohmagosh!  It is stupifying! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  tsk tsk tsk...<br/>
<br/>
  No.  Sonlight is carefully engineered.<br/>
<br/>
  Those wild places have false religion taught as truth (beware the &quot;dinosaur&quot; <br/>
  museum)<br/>
  primates with penises<br/>
  gambling booths<br/>
  glorification of humanist relationships, murder, extra-marital, pre-marital, <br/>
  post-marital sex (theatre & opera)<br/>
  PS2 just evil<br/>
  used bookstores with SECULAR books?<br/>
<br/>
  Sonlight has what money can&#39;t buy.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh, no, wait.<br/>
  You can buy it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307577901">What I&#39;ve heard about Sonlight is that it&#39;s really hard to implement <br/>
in a real life. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard one way or the other about the <br/>
content. That booklist DOES look juicy! but seems to me, the <br/>
frustrating things I&#39;ve heard about have to do with making it work.<br/>
<br/>
make sense? But I&#39;ve never bought a curriculum, besides a KONOS book. <br/>
so I&#39;m not a judge of what is good and what isn&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids each still own the spiral notebooks I bought them when we first moved <br/>
to this house.  I had told them that if they filled the whole book up with <br/>
writing, single sides, any writing, copying from comics or anything, and that <br/>
I would buy that kid a video game cartridge of his or her choice.<br/>
<br/>
Not one of them did it.  Holly&#39;s has lots of drawings.  Marty&#39;s has notes for <br/>
a video game.  Kirby&#39;s is lost (he looked for it when he took driver&#39;s ed, <br/>
said he had seen it when they cleaned his room the week before).  <br/>
<br/>
Notebooks last a long time here! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-151957391">Another good use for this curriculum would be origami practice, paper <br/>
airplanes, mulching the garden, sketching.<br/>
<br/>
as for consuming them...hamburger stretcher&#39; thinly cut strips, put <br/>
