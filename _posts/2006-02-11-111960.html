<div id="ygrps-yiv-142243064">My 12 yo daughter had the best day, and I&#39;d love to share it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an avid patchworker/quilter, and I&#39;ve never &#39;expected&#39; any of my <br/>
daughters to follow.  However, Beth repeatedly asked me this week <br/>
(and earlier) if she could look at my books and choose some <br/>
materials from my many suitcases of scraps.  So we talked about <br/>
colour schemes, material qualities, how certain materials are made <br/>
which affects their properties.  Just this part opened up a wealth <br/>
of discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Then she decided what pattern block she&#39;d like to assemble.  With <br/>
that came drawing up the templates.  There was equalateral <br/>
triangles, fitting all the pieces together, a discussion of angles, <br/>
seam allowances and playing with measurements in all their wonderful <br/>
applications.  <br/>
<br/>
And nothing was contrived.  I didn&#39;t set out to teach her anything, <br/>
I just answered the questions she had and was there to help her work <br/>
out any problems that came up.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the afternoon she had created a most beautiful <br/>
patchwork block, and is looking forward to creating some more.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of day encourages me so much.  I would love to also tell <br/>
soon about my 10 yo sons recently aquired love of model building.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is great!<br/>

Isn&#39;t it great to be sharing this love with your dd?  My dd chose to <br/>
dive in with me at about the same time I began persuing my interest <br/>
in quilting.  She was 10yo, I was 38yo.  Since then, she has created <br/>
very interesting patterns/pillows/quilts/creations.  Currently, she <br/>
is meandering through a quilt pattern dictionary we picked up from <br/>
the library.  She is interested in entering the quilt block contest <br/>
our local Wal-Marts are hosting.  Lots of mathy talk going on here in <br/>
trying to get the pattern she chose to the 12.5 inch requirement <br/>
needed for the contest!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;ve already chose my pattern and am half way done with it!  I <br/>
chose the Cathedral window.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting!  Please feel free to email me personally if you <br/>
would like to continue this conversation!</div>
