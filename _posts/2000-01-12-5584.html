NEways, there was a discussion a while back on unjobbing.  We&#39;re<br/>
planning to move to the States in March, and dh decided (on his own!)<br/>
that he wants to start his own business.  In high school, he worked for<br/>
his dad&#39;s company - they put in electric wiring in buildings (like<br/>
houses) and on streets (like street lights and tunnels, etc.).  DH would<br/>
like to do something similar, but knows nothing about starting out.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know anything either, but I told him that I knew of some people<br/>
who did know.  So, will somebody please write to me and explain how to<br/>
start out (do you need a permit or anything?), and how to get business -<br/>
how to let people know about what you can do - anybody who&#39;s been there,<br/>
done that, and has some advice?  This is a big leap for him because he&#39;s<br/>
worked in the Japanese military until now - graduated the military<br/>
academy, that kind of thing.  <br/>

Thanks in advance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614852456">HELLO Melanie! <br/>
<br/>
I will ask some friends around for you from another list. They are <br/>
homeschooling and homeworking. I think that you need to get a DBA (doing <br/>
business as) and a license. you may want to research the net for your new <br/>
state, and then write the county official. I did the same basic thing for <br/>
finding out about a home. Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

Great to hear from you.  Congrats on the birth of Rachael.  How did it go?<br/>
How is your son doing?  You?<br/>
Where might you be moving to in the states?<br/>
