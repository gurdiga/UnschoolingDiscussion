<div id="ygrps-yiv-350434249">We just recently introduced our kids to Monty Python. They had never heard<br/>
of or seen a MP movie before. We watched the Holy Grail. They thought it was<br/>
okay, my older son (almost 11) laughed and got more of the humor than my<br/>
younger son - Jonathan (9). DH (being a MP fan) was narrating and explaining<br/>
the various scenes that came up. And I think because he was cracking up at<br/>
certain parts, my kids knew that it was a funny part and they tried to find<br/>
the humor in it. They liked the killer white bunny (because we have a mean<br/>
white bunny). But at the end, when it abruptly ended with the untimely<br/>
arrests, Jonathan declared that in his opinion, Spongebob Squarepants was<br/>
much funnier and this was a stupid movie. BUT, I checked out The Life of<br/>
Brian (on DVD!) and we&#39;re watching that, next!<br/>
