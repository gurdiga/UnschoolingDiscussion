<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059084542">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
We are an unschooling family living in the UK.<br/>
<br/>
We have been toying with the idea of moving out to either Canada or  <br/>
the borders of Canada and the US.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone email me and talk about what it is like to homeschool out  <br/>
there? What are the authorities like towards you? How are your  <br/>
decisions to unschool met where you live by others - do you suffer  <br/>
prejudice as a result or are your children ridiculed by the other  <br/>
children who go to school?<br/>
<br/>
All advice on area, town etc most welcome.<br/>
<br/>
This is just an idea we have been discussing for the last year. So  <br/>
now we have reached the next stage, discussions with other people who  <br/>
actually live and unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for all replies.<br/>
<br/>
Helen J.</div>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re talking about nearly 20 states and provinces, each with different <br/>
laws.   It&#39;s too large a question.<br/>

<br/>
Hundreds of towns, unanswerable.    <br/>
<br/>
What kind of place appeals to you--western or Englandesque? (cowboy/hippie <br/>
side or New England/yankee?)--Atlantic, Pacific or inland?   Urban or rural?   <br/>
Forest or farmland?<br/>
