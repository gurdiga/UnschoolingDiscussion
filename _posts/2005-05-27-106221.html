TANGLED IN THE PORN WEB—Pornography sales now exceed $10  billion annually in <br/>
the U.S. and $56 billion over the world. Porn  use—specifically Internet porn—<br/>
is on the rise and is claiming a high price: lost  jobs, failed marriages, <br/>
and destroyed families. Pastors and other Christian  leaders are no less <br/>
vulnerable to this addiction (3/5 C. Today). In  August 1999, 11 percent of the calls <br/>
received on Focus on the Family&#39;s Pastoral  Care Line were about pastors and <br/>
online porn. In August 2000, online porn  worries prompted 20 percent of the <br/>
calls. Almost 10 percent of calls are from  women. Many female sex addicts get <br/>
hooked through X-rated chatrooms. Pornography  has become one of the most <br/>
profitable ventures on the Internet with obscene  profits soaring. <br/>

(From &quot;Calvary Contender,&quot; a stupid site about stupidity, but still,  worth <br/>
quoting on this, because IF pastors and Christian leaders are vulnerable  to <br/>
this &quot;addiction,&quot; there&#39;s something my teenagers have in their lives, some  <br/>
strength or wholeness, that those grown men with wives and children are wholly  <br/>
missing.)<br/>
