<div id="ygrps-yiv-958946282">Hi-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list and am in the process of leaving waldorf teaching to <br/>
live in an &#39;unschooling&#39; way with my almost 11-year old son.  I am gathering <br/>
other folks here on Kauai to create a democratic school / homeschool <br/>
resource center together, yet I&#39;m finding I&#39;m judging myself as hypocritical <br/>
for preaching &#39;just relax and trust the process&#39; while secretly harboring <br/>
fears that I&#39;m being neglectful in allowing my son to unfold at his pace <br/>
without more directive intervention.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear your success stories in allowing your children to unfold <br/>
and trusing that they will eventually enjoy or perhaps have an inkling of <br/>
interest in things like reading and figuring things out with numbers.<br/>
<br/>
My son is an intelligent, sweet boy who has grown up being read to nightly.  <br/>
He adores being read to, he just has not interest in reading.  He also is <br/>
not very skilled - reads very, very slowly without any degree of fluency.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fighting the urge within myself to &#39;go to the authorities&#39; and have him <br/>
&#39;tested&#39;, etc.  I&#39;m trying to remind myself that he is unique and he will <br/>
bloom in his own time, but I need some support!<br/>
<br/>
Will you please write to me?!<br/>
Thanks-<br/>
Sally Mabelle<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474568066">Hi Sally -<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;d love to hear your success stories<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**First of all, I want to recommend a new book, The Unprocessed Child, by<br/>
Valerie Fitzenreiter.  Her unschooled daughter is 23 now, and the book is<br/>
about unschooling and parenting.  I really enjoyed it.  It&#39;s not about<br/>
&#39;later&#39; readers, but it might help you with any lingering unschooling<br/>
doubts.<br/>
<br/>
It really is true that your son will blossom in his own time if you give him<br/>
the space to do so.  I&#39;m loving watching my kids unfold and grow.  Reading,<br/>
helping with housework, learning to do their part in relationships,<br/>
mathematical understanding - it all comes to them when they are ready, and<br/>
they accept it with joy and excitement.  Unschooling is a wonderful way to<br/>
live.<br/>
<br/>
Cherish his sweetness, enjoy those snuggled up reading times, and, yes, just<br/>
relax :0).  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548935682">The only help testing will do is to put pressure on you in the beginning. The <br/>
tests gauge areas most kids are not tested in so who knows what a typical <br/>
public school child would score on say reading comprehension? <br/>
If you test you will be able to say later that you Unschooled and he turned <br/>
out fine but is it worth the stress on you both.<br/>
<br/>
I myself did the worry last October. I took Dustin to Sylvan Learning Centers <br/>
and I came out with a 1st grade 9th month reading comprehension level when he <br/>
read out loud. THAT is what the focused on. It didn&#39;t matter to me because he <br/>
is at home so the need to read out loud over the next couple years didn&#39;t <br/>
matter one bit. In his reading to himself he was 3.1. His History/Social Studies <br/>
was grade 6! Some where he was getting it and the tests did not show it at <br/>
all. <br/>
<br/>
I can say now almost a year later he is reading everything he can. He is not <br/>
a book worm at all. He reads military history esp Marine Corps, Comic books, <br/>
surfing magazines, XBox games, local swap and sell it guides and good ol&#39; Ebay.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t text books or the 800 hours = 4-6000.00 (suggested we take out a <br/>
loan on our home) Sylvan said he needed but rather in my opinion TRUST, age, <br/>
video games, and his love for surfing! And he also told me he just colored in <br/>
stuff on the test cuz he was hungry and it was taking too long. <br/>
So 175.00 later I can test forever but why, its all about the all mighty <br/>
dollar and selling tutor time.<br/>
<br/>
Stay on the list all will be ok......: )<br/>
BTW welcome to the list<br/>

Tests don&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
The best they do is justify teacher&#39;s salaries, where applicable.  They like <br/>
to pretend kids wouldn&#39;t do better on tests just by gettig older, but that ANY <br/>
improvements are directly to the credit of a teacher or to materials <br/>
ordisciplineor better school morale.  All nonsense, but they have money to spend and <br/>
justify.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507168950">You are right Sanda.<br/>
 I had started to re-write that statement but in my situation that was a big <br/>
part of what had convinced &quot;me&quot; that I was done with testing and to him that <br/>
the numbers didn&#39;t matter.  At the time I didn&#39;t know it but was close. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t until &quot;he&quot; choose &quot;his&quot; path that I had begun to relax in my head. <br/>
I never would have believed that they will read when they are ready until I <br/>
saw it with my own eyes. <br/>
The testing showed us all that even out of school one must beware. Not to <br/>
mention the guilt trip they played if we didn&#39;t &quot;invest&quot; the 800 hrs &quot;in our sons <br/>
future&quot;. We did just at home and he did it not us. No pushing, no comments a <br/>
few capachinos at B & N and mom and son conversations. <br/>
<br/>
May not sound like much but sitting here thinking about our families turning <br/>
point my eyes still well up.. <br/>

<br/>
My 9 yos, Jesse, is loving the freedom of unschooling. He has had no problem<br/>
learning to read but has had no concept of numbers at all, even after three<br/>
years of workbooks (hmm, or maybe because of them?). It has been such a<br/>
relief for me to be able to just stop trying to *help* him to understand.<br/>
<br/>
We have been playing Monopoly lately (waiting until Mark is home and we&#39;ve<br/>
had dinner. It&#39;s such a great way to end the day.) and he is starting to get<br/>
it. He was adding up numbers himself the last time we played which is huge.<br/>
I&#39;m just glad that he never felt like a failure because he wasn&#39;t<br/>
understanding it when I was ready for him to.<br/>
<br/>
Children will learn what they need to when they need to if we let them be. I<br/>
have just been reminding myself of this over and over again and I am finding<br/>
that I don&#39;t need to do it so often anymore. I can see the reality of it<br/>
unfolding around me. It&#39;s magical.<br/>
<br/>
