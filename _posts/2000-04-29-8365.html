<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi All!</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks to a very knowledgeable mom who specializes 
in computers and network systems, I was provided with the following e-message 
that gives information about the kak virus, and instructions on how to remove it 
permanently from any computers that might have become infected.&nbsp; We 
cleaned&nbsp;our computer, so I&#39;m quite relieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you suspect, 
after reading the description contained in the following e-message, that your 
own system might have been infected, please follow the steps indicated&nbsp;in 
the last paragraph of Eric Chien&#39;s article (from Symantec, producer of the 
Norton AntiVirus program).&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Please note that some of the 
damage done by this virus occurs on the 1st of each month at&nbsp;5pm.&nbsp; 
May&nbsp;1st is quickly approaching!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I again apologize for inadvertently &quot;sharing&quot; this 
KakWorm virus with others.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know how, where, when, or why it came 
into my system, and even with my Norton&nbsp;AntiVirus program, it was detected 
in only a small part of my computer (namely, the signature part of my Outlook 
Express).&nbsp; To completely eradicate the virus from your computers,&nbsp;read 
the last portion of Eric Chien&#39;s article which is at the end of this posting, 
and follow the steps he suggests.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks for your prompt attention -- and for your 
forgiveness!!</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>...&nbsp;I&#39;ve been geeking for a living for 
many years, and in that<br>time I&#39;ve been responsible for keeping a great many 
computers<br>virus-free and stable in all kinds of environments, or cleaning 
them<br>after someone else let them get infected. Caveat: I do Windows 
and<br>some Unix. I have not done much of anything with Macs for so 
many<br>years that I wouldn&#39;t presume to give anyone any advice at all 
about<br>them.<br><br>Whether or not your system could be infected with the 
virus depends<br>on several factors. 1) Did you open the message? 2) Do you use 
an<br>email program that displays HTML? 3) If you do, does that 
program<br>execute code found in HTML without giving you any warnings or 
chances<br>to say you don&#39;t want to do so?<br><br>If you&#39;re using Netscape for 
email, as far as I know you&#39;re in<br>trouble. If you&#39;re using any current 
version of Eudora, you have a<br>setting somewhere that lets you choose whether 
you want Eudora to<br>permit code to run without your approval. If you use 
Outlook or<br>Outlook Express, I think you&#39;re almost certainly in 
trouble<br>(depending on your virus and security settings). If you&#39;re 
using<br>another email program, I don&#39;t know for sure, but I&#39;d be finding 
out<br>ASAP.<br><br>If you do use Outlook Express or Internet Explorer&#39;s 
newsgroup<br>reader, you might have already spread the virus to others. 
You<br>definitely need to check. I&#39;ve copied an article from Symantec&#39;s 
web<br>site below to give you more information about this particular 
virus.<br><br>If you already have a current virus protection program and 
updated<br>virus definitions for it, you&#39;re probably fine - this virus has 
been<br>around since December, and Symantec (maker of the Norton 
products)<br>released updates protecting their users from it back then. Most 
other<br>manufacturers probably did the same. I have my software set to 
check<br>all files for viruses as they&#39;re created on my hard drive, so I 
was<br>alerted as soon as the mail was downloaded - before I read it. 
Some<br>people don&#39;t use that level of security - it isn&#39;t the default in 
any<br>program I&#39;ve used recently - so if you&#39;re using your program&#39;s<br>default 
settings, you might not have been alerted until you started<br>to open the 
message. As long as you didn&#39;t open it, you should still<br>be safe.<br><br>-

causes all outgoing mail to be appended by the worm. In<br>addition, the
