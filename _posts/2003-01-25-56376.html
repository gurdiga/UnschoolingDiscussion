<div id="ygrps-yiv-563335877"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I HATE taking the dishes out of the dishwasher and putting them away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You hit the nail on the head, I have the same problem.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you think that if I cut down the number of dishes, and cups, that I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to unload them all the time?<br/>
Thinking I may just have too many and need to limit them.<br/>
<br/>
FYI - I was at one time constantly washing bath towels, drove my crazy.<br/>
My family considered a towel dirty if they just washed their hair. And would <br/>
take a new one the next time.<br/>
I finally gave each person a nice thick towel, and that was theirs. I hid the <br/>
rest! My hubby hated this idea at first, and now it worked perfectly.<br/>

That&#39;s funny. It&#39;s just the opposite here. I have tons of towels in both <br/>
bathrooms and I always have to go and check with the kids, and hubby too, <br/>
that they have put them in the laundry basket. They would let them hang <br/>
there forever using the same ones. Ewwwww!!<br/>
