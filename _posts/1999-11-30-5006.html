homeschoolers to the point where there were no more legal problems,<br/>
HSLDA would be putting themselves out of business.<br/>
<br/>
There was a good article in the July-August 1999  Home Education <br/>
Magazine called HSLDA&#39;S Study:  Embarrassing and Dangerou, by Larry <br/>
and Susan Kaseman.  It&#39;s just one example of the problems they have created.  It&#39;s <br/>
probably available for reading at the Home Ed Mag site (I&#39;ve lost my <br/>
bookmarks.)  The Hegeners have been refreshingly outspoken about the <br/>
problems with HSLDA.<br/>

Legal &quot;insurance&quot; is illegal in many states!  HSLDA, if you can get them to<br/>
respond directly,  will have to tell you they are NOT legal insurance.  If<br/>
they say they ARE,  in writing,  I know many who would love to get ahold of<br/>
that and run them out of town!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527419865">The problem is that quite frequently H$LDA&#39;s &quot;advise&quot; is contrary to the<br/>
public good and to homeschoolers in particular.  The problem is that H$LDA<br/>
is  lobbying organization that fronts as a help to homeschoolers.  The<br/>
problems are about a mile high.<br/>
<br/>
If they want to be a Christian lobbying organization, then I suggest that<br/>
is how they should portray themselves.  And, I have to say that after what<br/>
they did to Cheryl (well, what Farris was a party to), and their<br/>
friendships with folks like Gothard and Ezzo, well, need I say more?<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Robin, it is on their membership form. They specifically state that<br/>

&gt;I&#39;d like to know what you all think of Clonlara then?  I understand<br/>
&gt;they offer legal assistance to those enrolled in their program.  I see<br/>
&gt;this program is highly recommended in The Teenage Liberation Handbook,<br/>
&gt;so whats the difference if they offer legal assistance for their<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The difference is that Clonlara doesn&#39;t use scare tactics to get people to<br/>
join, doesn&#39;t involve itself in non-homeschooling political agendas with<br/>
members money and unknown to them, doesn&#39;t come into states without the<br/>
knowledge or request of the major state groups and start creating state laws<br/>
where none were needed or wanted, doesn&#39;t further create such state laws to<br/>
benefit themselves (i.e, you must belong to one of thse homeschool groups in<br/>
order to homeschool legally, and oh yes, to belong to one of those groups<br/>
you must first be a member of H$LDA).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the difference between a assistance and an ax.<br/>

Pride, Sue Welch and Michael Boutot certainly spoke to me.  :(<br/>
<br/>
Bill Gothard is another *side* to the homeschooling community that most<br/>
people are not aware of. He is the leader of a very rigid homeschooling<br/>
program.  You have to invest a bit of time to read enough to truly<br/>
understand what he is after, but to me it&#39;s time well spent.  I&#39;m not<br/>
finding my bookmarks for some reason. I&#39;ll need to go retrieve them from<br/>
wherever I put them..... they are probably with my car keys. &lt;weak grin&gt;<br/>

Fully understanding the motives of Bill Gothard, Mike Farris, Doug Wilson<br/>

     Why in the %#@@ would someone want to spank a 6 week old baby with<br/>

heard of Gothard, but I don&#39;t know much about him.  I take it they are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760057640">I had a hard time when I first heard about Ezzo in not thinking it was some<br/>
black humoured hoax parodying regressive childrearing practices and was<br/>
horrified to find out it was real.  There are groups of people &quot;in recovery&quot;<br/>
from Ezzo.  There is actually quite a lot of resistance to their twisted<br/>
approach from Christians and not just the secular types.  It is abusive to<br/>
be sure.<br/>
<br/>
However it is one of those evils with which I must live and refuse to give<br/>
in to the urge to legislate, ban, and otherwise require people not to be<br/>
stupid.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of people who do what I think are stupid things to their<br/>
children.  There are of course people who think I am doing stupid things<br/>
with my children.<br/>
<br/>
So as intensely as I dislike and as heartily revolted by Ezzo as I am ....<br/>
dare I say it ..... until there are verifiable bruises on the kids what can<br/>
I do?  The freedom to do stupid things is fundamental.<br/>

   One of the reasons this can be such a difficult topic is that there are<br/>
people out there that feel they have been helped by HSLDA.  Say a social<br/>
worker comes to the door, their literature would tell you to call them and<br/>
let them handle it. You would have gotten your money&#39;s worth then, right?  I<br/>
don&#39;t think so and here&#39;s why.   Our homeschooling freedoms can only be<br/>
protected when we, as individuals, feel we are competent and capable people.<br/>
By dealing with situations ourselves we do two things, we strengthen<br/>
ourselves and we teach our children to depend on themselves.  Now, yes,<br/>
sometimes the problems are too large and complex to handle on our own and we<br/>
then turn to folks who can help.  But the focus of that help should be<br/>
centered on what is good for you.  HSLDA states up front that you must agree<br/>
to whatever decision they make, or lose their services.  I know of no other<br/>
law firm that  stipulates that.  I once spent 18 months litigating a court<br/>
battle and never once did my lawyer say, if we don&#39;t do it this way, I&#39;m out<br/>
of here.<br/>
<br/>
It seems backwards to say the  fact HSLDA took care of a problem for someone<br/>
was really no help at all, but that&#39;s how I see this.  Their focus should be<br/>
on teaching and information, so that others may handle their own problems.<br/>
Unfortunately, if you send off for their financial statements for the last<br/>
few years, you will see they put -$0- in the column for court cases.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond this the situation really becomes complicated when you find out what<br/>
they do with that $5 million a year in income.  :(<br/>

so much for sharing the URL to the HEM site.  I read all the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; articles there on Cheryl&#39;s situation.  I had never heard about this<br/>
&gt; before.  It really bothers me that people do this sort of thing to<br/>
&gt; others in the name of their god.  Well, I can certainly understand now<br/>
&gt; why you all dis-like HSLDA so much.  I definately won&#39;t plan on<br/>
&gt; re-newing my membership next year.  What a shame!  I really thought they<br/>
&gt; were a good org. that helped people.  I can see that is not true now.<br/>

Yes, they are in ways tied with Reconstructionists, and Reconstructionists <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking of conspiracies ;-) I wouldn&#39;t be too sure about the feebleness of<br/>
the political part.<br/>
<br/>
I believe I remember reading somewhere that fundamentalist denominations<br/>
were the fastest growing in the US. This isn&#39;t a new growth but I think<br/>
especially after 9/11 (and the situations in the world that led up to it)<br/>
people are looking for philosophies that provide absolute answers,<br/>
guarantees and reassurances about the future -- something to calm their<br/>
fears. Fundamentalism speaks to that. (I think those fears, though not<br/>
entirely responsible, also contribute to the push for standardized testing<br/>
and back to basics.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>According to the fundamentalists. There&#39;s lots and lots of stuff on the<br/>
internet. Probably just typing in Christian &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; would yield<br/>
loads of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book series that&#39;s very popular among Christian fundamentalist<br/>
homeschoolers. (Maybe specifically those of the Calvinist persuasion but I&#39;m<br/>
not sure of the fine distinctions between the various fundamentalist camps.)<br/>
If you go to just about any fundamentalist Christian homeschooling book<br/>
provider, these will be available. (Sonlight.com seems to be the rare<br/>
exception.) There are two versions: one for adults (and teens?) and one for<br/>
middle schoolers. There are also workbooks available for the children&#39;s<br/>
version.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m becoming more aware of how valuable that time spent debating and<br/>
reading Christian fundamentalist homeschoolers in AOL&#39;s old homeschooling<br/>
forum was. It was a rare opportunity to gain insight into their way of<br/>
thinking. Anyone can obviously join a message board or list for Christian<br/>
fundamentalists to hear what they&#39;re saying, but this was right there in our<br/>
laps without us having to go look for it and they were willing to debate<br/>
(very heatedly often!) us non-fundamentalist types. ;-)<br/>

The Light and the Glory by Peter Marshall<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s a review at Amazon (written by a non-fundamentalist Christian):<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Peter Marshall and David Manuel have done their homework. There is no doubt<br/>
&gt; about it. They have proposed a thesis - that America was discovered, explored,<br/>
&gt; and founded as an explicitly Christian nation, and that God&#39;s hand can be<br/>
&gt; evident in it&#39;s early history - and have defended it well. They have gone back<br/>
&gt; to some interesting primary sources, which do, in fact, shed light on our<br/>
&gt; nation&#39;s early history. As such, the book is a valuable read.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THIS BEING SAID, for the author&#39;s thesis to stand, one must comprehend and<br/>
&gt; assume a totally Calvinistic understanding of Christian theology, AND assume<br/>
&gt; that our Founding Fathers were working under similar paradigms. Such an<br/>
&gt; historical point of view is difficult to defend. Some of our nation&#39;s Founders<br/>
&gt; did indeed come from such a theological viewpoint. Many, however, did not.<br/>
&gt; (And our two significant founding documents were penned by a Deist and an<br/>
&gt; Episcopalian!) Such a point of view is also difficult, not only to those who<br/>
&gt; do not profess the Christian faith, but for the enormous majority of those who<br/>
&gt; do! (Catholics, Orthodox, many Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists, some<br/>
&gt; Baptists, etc.) If a Calvinistic viewpoint is removed from the book, the<br/>
&gt; entire premise collapses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please don&#39;t get me wrong -- Marshall and Manuel have assembled a great deal<br/>
&gt; of research, and have presented it in an interesting and entertaining fashion.<br/>
&gt; The &quot;facts&quot; are there. It&#39;s just that I (speaking as both a committed<br/>
&gt; Christian and a historian) can&#39;t buy their &quot;interpretation&quot; of those facts.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From Sea to Shining Sea for Children tells Americas story during its first<br/>
&gt; fifty years. These were the days of Benjamin Franklin and Daniel Boone,<br/>
&gt; Francis Asbury and Charles Finney, Andrew Jackson and Sam Houston. During<br/>
&gt; these years Conestoga wagons and circuit riders became famous, Indian wars and<br/>
&gt; slavery were major concerns, and the Louisiana Purchase and the Oregon Trail<br/>
&gt; expanded Americas boundaries from sea to shining sea. But God was also at work<br/>
&gt; in the young nation, giving its settlers exciting opportunities to shape its<br/>
&gt; history and to be His people. This book, written primarily for young people in<br/>
&gt; the middle grades, includes study questions for each chapter and helps its<br/>
&gt; readers see Gods part in American history.<br/>
