<div id="ygrps-yiv-788373752">&quot;One more week till I can go and get my supplies and then  get started. I<br/>
really want to get past my fears of failure and of painting something that<br/>
others won&#39;t find acceptable. Make it all about me and the process.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &quot;The Artist&#39;s Way&quot;?<br/>
If you don&#39;t have it, beg, steal, borrow or buy it NOW. It&#39;s the &quot;must have&quot; book for those trying to reclaim that creative spark within.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  i too dream of being an artist, but fear no one will care or want<br/>
<br/>
my art.  and i fear that i will let other people opinions about my very<br/>
<br/>
personal art affect how i do art. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When you do something so passionately that you don&#39;t care if others care, or <br/>
want it I think what is likely to happen is that you will infuse the work and <br/>
the air around it with that thing that people do care about and want.<br/>
<br/>
The statement above sounds like you were thinking you want to make a living <br/>
as an artist.    That&#39;s not the same as BEING (in your being, in your soul, in <br/>
your actions, in your priorities) an artist.<br/>
<br/>
A mundane and unrelated parallel:<br/>
Kirby is 17, works at a gaming shop, and when August comes he will have <br/>
worked there for four solid years.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has a friend who has said he really wanted to work there, would like to <br/>
work there, has applied, but isn&#39;t hired.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby used to volunteer to help there, when he was 12 and 13.  He would pick <br/>
up chairs at the end of the day, offer to vacuum, help fold calendars for <br/>
mailing, run errands.   Kirby loved the shop and was helping because he wanted to <br/>
be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
His friend declared flatly in a large group of people (I was there) that they <br/>
were asking for volunteers for a tournament, but he wasn&#39;t going to work for <br/>
them for free.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has worked many of those tournaments.  They give him store credit and <br/>
he gets cards for games he plays.    Marty was offered a job, but turned it <br/>
down.  He didn&#39;t want to work where Kirby works.  (Makes sense.)  Meanwhile, the <br/>
other guy who claims to want to do that refuses to actually DO it unless he&#39;s <br/>
paid.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something about peace, contentment and commitment that&#39;s alluring, <br/>
and it can be apparent in art and music and food prep and bedmaking and, I <br/>
guess, game-store customer service.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850937171">hi all<br/>
<br/>
i get this groups email in digest form and rarely make it through reading it<br/>
all<br/>
<br/>
i did catch a little about this string of creativity<br/>
<br/>
i too would recommend the artist&#39;s way.  i actually have it from the library<br/>
now.  however, i have stopped reading it to read fearless living by rhonda<br/>
britten<br/>
<br/>
this book focuses on defining our fears and learning how to deal with them<br/>
to live more creatively, and with all our essence.<br/>
<br/>
in a way it is a self help book, but only as much as the artist&#39;s way is<br/>
too. kwim?<br/>
<br/>
i think fear often holds our creativity and possible our whole selves back -<br/>
i know it does for me.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i definitely need to go back through my emails and read more of this<br/>
string.  i too dream of being an artist, but fear no one will care or want<br/>
my art.  and i fear that i will let other people opinions about my very<br/>
personal art affect how i do art.<br/>
<br/>
hope some of this makes sense.<br/>
