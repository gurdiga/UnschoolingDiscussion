<div id="ygrps-yiv-720210714">Hey all - <br/>
<br/>
Just dropping you a note to let you know that the very last day of<br/>
early registration is 4/30!!! That is THIS FRIDAY! There will be no<br/>
extension this time around. Below is the outline of the price schedule<br/>
- and while it is certainly a good deal even after 4/30, it sure would<br/>
feel good to save even a few more bucks, wouldn&#39;t it? :) Plus, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**Any workshops that have attendance limits will be filled in order of<br/>
registration date**<br/>
<br/>
This is very important as we anticipate that some workshops will<br/>
definitely be filling up fast. We are gearing up to send the packets<br/>
out via snail mail to register for workshops, so get your<br/>
registrations in NOW!!!!<br/>
<br/>
