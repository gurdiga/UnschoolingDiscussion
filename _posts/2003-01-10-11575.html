&lt;&lt; I&#39;m also interested in the &quot;lumber&quot; made out of recycled trash bags.  Our <br/>
 city busstop benches here are made of it, and in Alamogordo there&#39;s a big <br/>
 wooden kids&#39; playground, but the boardwalks are made with that plastic wood. <br/>
 <br/>
 I don&#39;t know how long it will last in the sun in the heat in Alamogordo, but <br/>
 it has the feel of outlasting real wood at least ten times over. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s supposed to last 500 years I believe!!<br/>
Dh has built some stuff with it, people are starting to figure out that if <br/>
you&#39;re going to be in a house long term, you only have to build ONE deck (or <br/>
ramp or walkway or.....)<br/>
and you&#39;re done, that&#39;s it.<br/>
No staining every year or two, no replacing bad boards...very cool.<br/>
The thing I wonder about is what happens when someone rips a project <br/>
out...what do you do with wood that lasts 500 years? That&#39;s like landfill <br/>
nightmare stuff.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You reuse it.<br/>
One of the beauties (about Trex at least) is that if you put a screw into <br/>
it, you pound down the top afterwards and the hole &#39;disappears&#39; from <br/>
view.  When you pull a board up, the screw pops clean from the board <br/>
(instead of sticking into it) and you can pound that out too so it looks <br/>
like a brand new board, ready to use!  I&#39;ve already had to pull up some <br/>
Trex boards (I put them in the wrong spot) and just re-used them in a <br/>
different part of the deck after hammering down the raised bits from where <br/>
the screws were.  You can use &#39;em and reuse &#39;em until they&#39;ve got too many <br/>
holes that&#39;ve been pounded in.  I figure that by that time, there&#39;ll be a <br/>
way to melt them back down and make new trex boards out of them.  (To my <br/>
knowledge, Trex is a combination of recycled plastic and wood <br/>
fibers/sawdust (that would normally get burned as waste.))<br/>
<br/>
Another cool thing, put them in the warm sun and they&#39;ll BEND to go around <br/>
curves.  Cool!  (although maybe not the best for hot-hot-Arizona/NM...)<br/>
