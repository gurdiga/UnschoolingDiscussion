<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030466996">Hello folks.  I am sending this message in hopes of contacting <br/>
unschoolers in the Alabama/Mississippi area.. Specifically the <br/>
Birmingham Area.   Fellow unschoolers in the south (NC,SC,GA) are <br/>
currently planning a mini conference in early November.  The speaker <br/>
we have engaged is traveling from Louisiana and she would also like <br/>
to plan a speaking engagement about halfway on her trip to Charlotte, <br/>
NC (which would be approx in the Birmingham area)  I will be glad to <br/>
give more details about the speaker and the arrangements if you will <br/>
please email me privately if you are interested in finding out more <br/>
about this opportunity. <br/>
<br/>
Thank You</div>
