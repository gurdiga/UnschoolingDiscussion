<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259004180">I take it Sandra said this. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**One of the hardest things I had to get over when I was first<br/>
homeschooling was rejection.  If I thought a game or book or puzzle or<br/>
free concert was VERY cool and my kid (Kirby at first) dragged his feet<br/>
and looked the other way or just say &quot;I don&#39;t like this, mom,&quot; I took it<br/>
personally and felt rejected and incompetent.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I feel the exact same thing but I do feel something. I think<br/>
it&#39;s more along the lines that the kid isn&#39;t enjoying something I think they<br/>
&quot;should&quot; be enjoying. Maybe I do feel a rejection of some sorts for not<br/>
enjoying what *I* think is fun. It&#39;s just like with the owl pellets. I<br/>
thought they were so neat and the kids did too when I asked if they wanted<br/>
them. Joseph lasted 20 minutes and was totally over them. Of course when<br/>
it&#39;s something *he* finds interesting wild horses wouldn&#39;t pull him away. I<br/>
guess what&#39;s easier, at least for me, is having my kids enjoy like minded<br/>
activities. Joseph is totally into things I&#39;m not. I just really need to be<br/>
aware of his needs and follow all his ideas as far as supply goes. It&#39;s not<br/>
easy sometimes.<br/>
