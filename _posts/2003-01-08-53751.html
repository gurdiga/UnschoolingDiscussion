<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985223371">Hi<br/>
   as far as I know Minority Report is based on a short story by Philip K <br/>
Dick. Blade runner is based on a Philip K Dick novel called &#39;Do Androids <br/>
Dream of Electric Sheep?&#39;. Also Total Recall was another based on one of his <br/>
short stories.<br/>
