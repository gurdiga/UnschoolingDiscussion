<div id="ygrps-yiv-276812192">Just wanted to say thanks for all the suggestions and insight.  There was so much good thoughtful information for me to mull over that I couldn&#39;t respond to it all--my household is just too busy, and some nights, the baby nixes my computer time.  Anyway thank you!<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to report that things are going better.  I&#39;m making some internal changes that feel really good and the kids are responding to them I think.  I&#39;ve also put some good advice into practice, like not asking if they want other food too, just putting the platter out there.  I used to do this occasionally, but now I&#39;m doing it mindfully, knowing that it makes a difference in our interaction.  <br/>
<br/>
My 10 year old stepdaughter is with me again (she comes and goes) and she has her 13 yo best friend with her.  Last night my 4 yo asked for cookies and milk.  Of course the whole gang chimed in, &quot;Me too!&quot;  I gave everyone a plate of 3 chocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk.  Then I put the bag on the counter where even the little ones could reach and said to all, &quot;If you want more their on the counter.&quot;  Predictably, my 4 yo wanted more.  She asked.  I smiled at her and said, &quot;They&#39;re on the counter.  I&#39;ll bet other people will want more too.  They are yummy!&quot;  She took two more and stopped.  <br/>
<br/>
Later, 4 yo asked for pretzels.  I said, sure, I&#39;ll get some out for everyone.  I made a platter of pretzels, crackers, cheese, peeled and sliced pears and almonds.  All that was left were pretzels and a few crackers.  No stress.  Everyone happy.  The older girls put on some dance music at my suggestion and everyone had a great time until they were sleepy.<br/>
<br/>
Nice night.<br/>
