<div id="ygrps-yiv-221412721">Hello all,<br/>
I&#39;m on VERY limited web access while I&#39;m away, hence the reason I <br/>
posted my name in the title. I respect the fact that some people <br/>
might wish to not want to read my postings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading &#39;Punished by Rewards&#39; by Alfie Kohn and this <br/>
passage was so apropo to some of the discussion I thought I&#39;d share <br/>
it:<br/>
<br/>
From the subchapter &quot;Tighter Control: The Case of Special Education&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Consider the fate of students who are said to be &#39;learning <br/>
disabled,&#39; a category so elastic that virtually all of us could be <br/>
diagnosed that way in one situation or another.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think this sums up my feelings on disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Kolleen<br/>
btw: If I don&#39;t respond to anyone&#39;s responses, its simply my lack of <br/>
access at the moment.</div>
