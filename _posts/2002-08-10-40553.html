&gt; &lt;&lt; BTW, may we hear how Sandra would change the schools&#39;<br/>
&gt; method of funding?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra first admits this:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;...schools hate homeschooling because we cost them money&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then she gives her answer:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  If all the homeschooled kids in our little<br/>
&gt; area here and all the privately schooled kids were all in public school, that<br/>
&gt; would be some amount of money. &lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned interrupts briefly: HUH? What money? Whose? I guess she means that if<br/>
all those kids attended the public school, that school would get more money<br/>
from the tax collection agency, since funding, is based on bodies in the<br/>
building. Fine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they calculated that and gave it to the<br/>
&gt; school regardless of who was enrolled, just by local kid-population, then my<br/>
&gt; having my kids out would lower the teacher/student ratio, allow those kids<br/>
&gt; more attention and less crowdedness.  That wouldn&#39;t hurt my feelings one bit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned tries to translates:  Sandra wants school revenue to be based on how<br/>
many kids live in the district, not on how many kids attend the school.<br/>
Then, no matter how many kids withdrew, the school would continue to be<br/>
funded at the same rate by everyone in the district. By this method, the<br/>
fewer kids in the school, the higher the spending per kid. The school would<br/>
have an incentive to reduce its enrollment -- less work for the same pay --<br/>
and no incentive to achieve since its revenue would not depend on satisfying<br/>
its students and parents. Whooopeee... Total absence of accountability.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra says: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If you say &quot;nonsense&quot; or start a libertarian rant, it won&#39;t help or change my<br/>
&gt;&gt;mind.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned returns:<br/>
Nobody needs me to say that&#39;s nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
Now, did I say anything libertarian, such as &quot;I want choices&quot;? No. Sandra&#39;s<br/>
plan would reward the schools more and more, even while more and more<br/>
families decide they&#39;re lousy and take their kids out. Meanwhile, every<br/>
taxpayer in the district is forced to pay the same school taxes every year<br/>
even though fewer and fewer children attend.   Only a socialist government<br/>
could create such a monster. Only a socialist could imagine it.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s collectivism is showing. She seems to like spending other people&#39;s<br/>
money.   The school system does that to its employees.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s try it with shoes....In a free market (the real world), if a shoe<br/>
company makes shoes that fewer and fewer people buy, their revenue goes down<br/>
because the company is not satisfying the needs of shoe buyers.<br/>
<br/>
Now let&#39;s say that the state takes over the company and pays it to keep<br/>
making the same amount of shoes as before, when there were more customers.<br/>
Under this situation, it doesn&#39;t matter how lousy the shoes are, because the<br/>
company doesn&#39;t get its money by satisfying customers anymore, it gets it<br/>
for making shoes, whether anyone wants them or not. The company has no<br/>
incentive to improve its product or its efficiency -- it is dependent on the<br/>
government instead of on direct paying customers.<br/>
<br/>
And where does the money come from that pays for the (unsold) shoes? The<br/>
state takes it by force from all the taxpayers. This is the way the USSR<br/>
finally broke down until nothing was left but debt and piles of unwanted<br/>
shoes, so to speak. The population was broke and the shelves were empty.<br/>
Where did all the money go? The government employees and the politicians<br/>
(the bureaucratic empire) took everything.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the lesson?<br/>
<br/>
Nobody deserves to be paid for doing unneeded or bad work, and nobody<br/>
deserves to be taxed in order to pay for unproductive activity. Bad schools,<br/>
like bad businesses, should close, and not be subsidized by taxpayers.<br/>
<br/>
Parents -- not politicians or government employees -- should choose how<br/>
their own money should be spent for their own children&#39;s education.<br/>
Nobody has a right to anyone else&#39;s property.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You asked me to explain.  Did you ask JUST so you could be personal and <br/>
snarky?<br/>
Nobody  needs you to keep ragging on political boogey men, but you do.<br/>
And you saying something is nonsense doesn&#39;t make it so, although you DO deal <br/>
more in nonsense than most people so you might be the expert, except you <br/>
don&#39;t see your own rants as nonsense at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No. Sandra&#39;s<br/>
plan would reward the schools more and more, even while more and more<br/>
families decide they&#39;re lousy and take their kids out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Reward&quot; the schools?<br/>
Those people aren&#39;t making a lot of money who work there.  <br/>
<br/>
Undoing the schools would NOT benefit most of those who are there now.  New <br/>
schools would replace the old in a heartbeat, but for MUCH more money and <br/>
with much more bullshit involved.<br/>
<br/>
How are phone systems and rates after Bell was forced to split out to prevent <br/>
a monopoly?<br/>
<br/>
How do privately-funded schools fare?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Meanwhile, every<br/>
taxpayer in the district is forced to pay the same school taxes every year<br/>
even though fewer and fewer children attend.   Only a socialist government<br/>
could create such a monster. Only a socialist could imagine it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nothing in your life lives a day without becoming a <br/>
sensationalist political slogan.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
Sandra&#39;s collectivism is showing. She seems to like spending other people&#39;s<br/>
money.   The school system does that to its employees.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re going too far now.  I was asked what I thought and I made a &quot;maybe <br/>
this&quot; response.  It wasn&#39;t spending people&#39;s money.  I didn&#39;t learn it from <br/>
being a teacher.  This level of insult is not friendly, not productive, and I <br/>
doubt it will earn you any support for your already tenuous position in this <br/>
forum.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now let&#39;s say that the state takes over the company and pays it to keep<br/>
making the same amount of shoes as before, when there were more customers.<br/>
Under this situation, it doesn&#39;t matter how lousy the shoes are, because the<br/>
company doesn&#39;t get its money by satisfying customers anymore, it gets it<br/>
for making shoes, whether anyone wants them or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some parents neither know how to make shoes nor would they forego a fifth of <br/>
whiskey to buy a child a pair of shoes.  And in that case, if the child can <br/>
get government shoes that&#39;s better than barefooted in the broken glass.   I <br/>
think more families than not are doing more damage to their own children than <br/>
they are doing nurturing.  And kids need options.  And it&#39;s a damned shame <br/>
but a truth that school is more nurturing for some kids than their own <br/>
families are.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The government employees and the politicians<br/>
(the bureaucratic empire) took everything.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What&#39;s the lesson?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That your political faucet is stuck to &quot;on&quot; and there&#39;s no filter on it.<br/>
<br/>
School employees are not getting rich.  They&#39;re not shareholders in some <br/>
giant corporation siphoning millions in profits from World&#39;s Finest Chocolate <br/>
bars.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Parents -- not politicians or government employees -- should choose how<br/>
their own money should be spent for their own children&#39;s education.<br/>
Nobody has a right to anyone else&#39;s property.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ned, why don&#39;t you go to a country with no taxes then? b&#39;bye!!<br/>
<br/>
Which countries would those be now?  Tell us where you can go to have <br/>
absolute control of all your vast earnings and not have to give any money to <br/>
the government, and have the freedom to unschool.<br/>
