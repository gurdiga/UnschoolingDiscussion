<div id="ygrps-yiv-778281782">ok i have been debating with myself if i wonted to post this but <br/>
here i go anyways,,lol,,<br/>
  <br/>
  i am fairly new to the unschool world but doing my best with it due <br/>
the fact i love itand even better my kids love it,but today we have <br/>
had a situation come up that i would like to hear your opions on and <br/>
how you wpould as unschoolers deal with it,ok.<br/>
<br/>
 my oldest son is 14,we have two phones in our house,1 cordless and 1 <br/>
with a cord in my room,,well i could not find the cordless when i <br/>
wonted to use the phone and could not hear it beep when i paged it so <br/>
i went to my room to pick up the other phone to us it or if someone <br/>
maybe had the cordless to ask where the was with it and let me know <br/>
when they got off i needed it.ok,not is where it got ugly,as i picked <br/>
up the phone i heard a very lowd voice cussing and caring on,i mean <br/>
really nasty words,really nasty,i was may sons friends talking,just <br/>
as i realized this i was gonna speak but them my son started to <br/>
talk,rather began to cuss samew as this other boy was,within about  <br/>
10 seconds or so i realized they was talking about drugs and was <br/>
planning to go sell to another boy,,my son said to the other boy well <br/>
you can if you wont to but you know i do not do that sh--,well the <br/>
drugs was the other kids,i hung up the phone,robert came from down <br/>
the hall way we meet in the hall way,i was in total shock after <br/>
fearing this,he did not even know i had heard,i ask him to get off <br/>
the phone well he did and wonted to know what was up,i confronted him <br/>
he was honest and said yes the boy had a bag of weed and wonted to <br/>
traid it to him for his ear ring,he told him no and the boy said he <br/>
would sell it to another guy,,ok now this other boy he is only 13,,he <br/>
stays at my home alot (all the time)his mom is single and if you find <br/>
here not drunk look out the sky just might be falling in,,not joking <br/>
that bad,,he only eats at school or my house,,angain not joking,he <br/>
was the one told me that just a few days ago when he called here at <br/>
midnight on a friday and wonted me to come get him,,she the mom had <br/>
been gone for 2 days and he did not wont to stay alone,,so i did,,its <br/>
became second nature to do this,,well anywaysrobert told me where the <br/>
druggs was and i called the boys mom,she went crazy on him calling <br/>
him every name in the nasty book telling him she was gonna call 911 <br/>
and kick him out,,welli told her we would be right done there ,,only <br/>
1/4 mile from me,,she wonted the pot,,he would not tell here where it <br/>
was,,and robert said he would show her for me,,well my husband said <br/>
not no but hell no,,he would not let us go there,he said robert is to <br/>
stay here and we will think this over and deal with it tomoorow if <br/>
there is still a need to,let her deal with him and we deal with our <br/>
kid....this makes her mad that we would not come give it to her <br/>
rather show her where he had hinden it,,so she naturally was <br/>
drunk,starts saying my kid planeted it on them,,he has done all kinds <br/>
of crap at her house that she never told on him for and so <br/>
forth,,well i hung up on her sent my son to his room and i to mine <br/>
cause it was late at this point and i wonted time to think straigh <br/>
before i reacted to her,,i believe my son and told him so,,butt i am <br/>
very upset with his cussing,,so i feel if he has time to think it <br/>
over tonight and we talk it over tomorrow he will realize better what <br/>
he sound like cussing that way,,anyways sorry to ramble on,,can you <br/>
give my advise on how you would handle this,,,this is our first <br/>
experince with dealing with any issue about druggs so close to home,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-109828235">I wouldn&#39;t have made a big deal about the cussing<br/>
and I would not have called a drunk to tell on a kid.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have made a kid get off the phone (unless I had an emergency call <br/>
to make).  It sounds like your son was handling it fine, saying he didn&#39;t <br/>
want drugs.  That&#39;s good, isn&#39;t it?  Yet he was yelled at and made to involve <br/>
himself in getting someone else in what could become some very serious <br/>
trouble.<br/>
<br/>
If the other boy hangs out, you could have talked to him directly.  Why <br/>
involve his mom?  She will be no help whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m making a decision about what to do or say with teenagers (I have <br/>
two) I always try to think about NOT being my mom (who was a drunk too; still <br/>
is), and I try to do what will make my relationship with my son better and <br/>
stronger.   <br/>
<br/>
If your priority is to have a son who never says bad words, it might be a <br/>
little late. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Even kids who go to strict churches, though, often use really bad language <br/>
sometimes just to do it.  They&#39;ll do it less if the mom isn&#39;t freaking than <br/>
if she is.  OR they&#39;ll be sneaky.<br/>
<br/>
My kids act the same way around adults as around kids.  The undoubtedly use <br/>
rougher language than some people would like.  But they don&#39;t use even <br/>
rougher language behind the house.  <br/>
<br/>
If people will be punished for doing something they&#39;ll learn to be sneaky.<br/>
<br/>
There are reasons not to use nasty language and there are good reasons not to <br/>
use drugs, but just fear of punishment is insufficient.  They  need sensible, <br/>
real reasons, presented rationally.<br/>

(i did not make a big deal out of it,i was in shock just hearing it from him,i did not say i was ashamded or suches to him,i replied to him that he not us that language in our home as a respect issue and said ok moma,sorry ,i said do not say sorry to me son,i just ask you to respect  our home and others  you do not have to say sorry but thank you for being pilite about it with me.)<br/>

<br/>
 Yet he was yelled at and made to involve <br/>

<br/>
(no!!!! i never said i yelled at him because i did not and do not yell at my kids,,and again no he was not made to get involved in anything,its was him that said moma he is lieing to her,will you take me to her house right now and yet me get it and show it to her,,and that was due to the fact the boy told his mom it was robert to start with and robert wonted to defend hisself so i was gonna let him but dad stepped in the way and would not let me take him there,)<br/>
<br/>
If the other boy hangs out, you could have talked to him directly.  Why <br/>
involve his mom?  She will be no help whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
(well i did try to talk to him but he hung up on me,and yes i was not thinking clearly about calling his mom,i was just doing what i would hope someone would do for me if my son had been using and saling drug,let me know so i could maybe get him help to learn to say no for himself and learn more on the issue.,but again,i regretted that 5 minutes after i did it,,)<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m making a decision about what to do or If your priority is to have a son who never says bad words, it might be a <br/>
little late. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(no that is not at all my priority,mine is to have a happy son,and seems to be to me just that.)<br/>
<br/>
If people will be punished for doing something they&#39;ll learn to be sneaky.<br/>
<br/>
(that is so true,thats why i am using the skills i have learned myself in our unschooling to not freak out and think before i speak,that is why i did not punish him in any way tonight ovewr this,i went to my room to think and he went to his room,well he went to his room because he wonted to us the phone more so not sure what he did once the door closed,,lol,,i did say to him i would like to talk more about it tomoorow,the subject being the other boy.to see if robert and i can come up with away to help him out since he true has noboby there for him,robert agreed and we gonna give our thoughts to eacg other tomorrow sometime)<br/>
<br/>
There are reasons not to use nasty language and there are good reasons not to <br/>
use drugs, but just fear of punishment is insufficient.  They  need sensible, <br/>
real reasons, presented rationally.<br/>
<br/>
(this also is true,that why i did not know how to present this to the other boy so i needed time over night with roberts help to work on it,my son ,lol,,he does not fear punishment ,due the fact i do not punish them,i listen to them,give advise when its ask for and until tonight have not hand to step into anything other than that,so i just wondered how others would deal with it and hope i could use their ways maybe..)<br/>

thank you for your reply!!!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
  Eeek!  Well, since you asked, my take on this situation is that your son was handling it just fine without your intervention.  Ratting the boy out to his loser parent was probably the worst thing you could have done IMO because the boy thought of your home as his safe place now he probably feels that he&#39;s not safe with you either.<br/>
<br/>
  Do NOT encourage that your son show anyone where the pot is.  It&#39;s not his business and I see it as being made to &quot;prove&quot; (in his mind) that he&#39;s a &quot;good&quot; boy.  I hope that made sense.<br/>
<br/>
  As far as the cussing goes..... why do you care???  He wasn&#39;t saying anything to YOU and &quot;sh!t&quot; is hardly a word to get worked up over.  LOL  Besides, do you think that his friend would even hear him if your son talked like Mr. Rodgers or something?  ;)  He&#39;s talking in 13yo-boy-ese.  Don&#39;t sweat the language, and don&#39;t harp on it to him or you&#39;re likely to push him away from you over something pretty (IMO) a non-issue.<br/>

<br/>
I would also try to demystify cuss words, to devalue them.  Not long ago I <br/>
offered Will (9) a chance to go somewhere where no one could hear us, and <br/>
scream out all the cuss words we could think of as many times as we wanted.  <br/>
He didn&#39;t take me up on it, because he was kind of shocked at the suggestion. <br/>
 He began to see them in a new light.  We got to talk a lot about what words <br/>
that are appropriate in a given situation.  I told him he could get them all <br/>
out any time he wanted, just to let me know and I&#39;d clear a path for him.  It <br/>
seems like they hold a special fascination for kids around this age.  They <br/>
think about them and hear other people say them, and eventually they&#39;re using <br/>
them when adults aren&#39;t around.  It&#39;s like a dirty little secret.  I say <br/>
bring it out in the light of day, and let them taste the words and feel and <br/>
hear them in their own voice  Take all the sting out of them.<br/>
<br/>
The other day he said he was being spun on a swing by the neighbor kids (12 <br/>
and 11) and he was so excited and enthralled he said shhhhhhhhhhh.....it!  I <br/>
know it was about impressing the older boys, but I had to warn him about what <br/>
those older boys&#39; mother&#39;s reactions would be if they heard him saying that <br/>
in front of their 3 yo sister.  With 4 adults in our house, Will&#39;s heard them <br/>
all anyway.  I will not shame him if I hear one out of his mouth. <br/>

***yes now that i think of it you are right it probly was his way of proving to someone he is good,but i guess he felt he need to prove to the other lady(because she and her son was blaming it on him,i point blank told her i did not believe her for a minute,i believe my kid over others,she did not like that to begin with,)i say that because he new i believed him the whole time,and he had nothing to prove to me.<br/>

<br/>
******i agree sh-- it not a word to get worked up over,and that was the small word they was using..lol..the other words i think would have made a one eyed drunk sailor blush..lol..really the only thing though was a big disrespect was using god name in vain,and by the way my son did not,and the words used to describe a girl they know,(i do not mean to be offensive )she was describer as a bit-- with a sloppy pu---,and this is the other kids girlfriend,i was proud my son has more respect for girls than that kids does apparently,but it shocked my to hear the kid say things like that.and  no i did not give hima hard time ,i just ask him to have his friends respect our home with their words and he said sorry moma and he told me the boy does not do girls like he does,he said i respect them but he just uses them,,i laughed and said ok robert that  is good to know and i walked away..lol<br/>

<br/>
  Eeek!  Well, since you asked, my take on this situation is that your son was handling it just fine without your intervention.  Ratting the boy out to his loser parent was probably the worst thing you could have done IMO because the boy thought of your home as his safe place now he probably feels that he&#39;s not safe with you either.<br/>
<br/>
  Do NOT encourage that your son show anyone where the pot is.  It&#39;s not his business and I see it as being made to &quot;prove&quot; (in his mind) that he&#39;s a &quot;good&quot; boy.  I hope that made sense.<br/>
<br/>
  As far as the cussing goes..... why do you care???  He wasn&#39;t saying anything to YOU and &quot;sh!t&quot; is hardly a word to get worked up over.  LOL  Besides, do you think that his friend would even hear him if your son talked like Mr. Rodgers or something?  ;)  He&#39;s talking in 13yo-boy-ese.  Don&#39;t sweat the language, and don&#39;t harp on it to him or you&#39;re likely to push him away from you over something pretty (IMO) a non-issue.<br/>

<br/>
As a teen, I had a lot of &quot;questionable&quot; friends :-P ... kids who drank or got high or had sex (this was the 70&#39;s and I was a GOOD girl hehehe). I never did that stuff myself, and my mom always believed me. She was very honest about her opinions of my friends, but she would always finish by saying &quot; ... but I trust your judgment about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many of my friends were afraid of/disgusted with their parents. I never had those feelings. Even if we had a big, serious argument (which we did!), even if things *looked* bad, I knew my mother&#39;s faith in me could not be shaken.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great gift. <br/>

<br/>
The reason we have this policy is so that our kids will feel free to <br/>
communicate openly about everything in their lives. there isn&#39;t MUCH <br/>
swearing, anyway, but I use the &quot;s&quot; word and once in awhile, say <br/>
the &quot;f&quot; word. We don&#39;t call each other names. In fact, we frown upon <br/>
glaring daggers at each other, much preferring to talk than glare or <br/>
heave a sigh and mope or roll eyeballs. If something is bugging a kid <br/>
enough to make her glare at me, I&#39;d rather she SAID &quot;You interrupted <br/>
me&quot; or whatever, than just get a disgusted angry look on her face and <br/>
say nothing. <br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;free cussing at will&quot; L sounds like a potty-mouth fest but it <br/>
isn&#39;t. I just don&#39;t forbid them to use those words around me. I&#39;d <br/>
rather have them say it in my hearing, than save it only for their <br/>
friends, presenting me with a facade.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This sounds so similar to my own childhood ( teens).<br/>
<br/>
   My best friend got pregnant in high school.  I went with her to the Dr <br/>
when she found out she was pregnant   We came back to my house and went in my <br/>
bedroom.  My mom came and gently knocked on the door.  I let her in and she <br/>
asked what was wrong.  My friend ( and I , too) was crying.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
hesitate for a minute.. I said.. &quot;Dawn&#39;s going to have a baby&quot;  Moma teared <br/>
up too and she sat down on the bed and hugged Dawn, and said, &quot;oh, <br/>
sweetheart, it&#39;s going to be OK&quot;.  We all had a good cry, and Dawn asked Moma <br/>
if she would call in to her work to tell them she was sick.  Mom did it.  <br/>
That was it.  No lecture to me, no warnings of  &quot;dont hang arond her&quot;   The <br/>
extent of Mom&#39;s input about the situation was to ask me how Dawn was doing <br/>
and to talk to me about how I felt about it and how it affected Dawn.   Never <br/>
a passing of judgement or a waiver of trust in me.  How wonderful<br/>
<br/>
    Dawn had a good mother too, but she was still scared to tell her she was <br/>
pregnant.  She didnt tell her family til she was 4 months along, and by then, <br/>
her mom had figured it out herself.   They didn&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; or &quot;disown&quot; her or <br/>
anything like that.. They supported her and helped her didn&#39;t demand that she <br/>
marry her boyfriend.   But, her boyfriends parents said, ABORTION or <br/>
MARRIAGE!  Thier son was not going to have a bastard child.  So, they got <br/>
married and spent 10 years in a terrible marriage til they got divorced.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I rambled as usual.  sorry.. I can never keep it short<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-302739217">thank you .the trust and faith i give to my kids is the best gift a think a mother can give her kids..<br/>
<br/>
kbolden &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kbolden@...">kbolden@...</a>&gt; wrote:&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i point blank told her i did not believe her for a minute,i believe my kid over others&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Good for you!<br/>
<br/>
As a teen, I had a lot of &quot;questionable&quot; friends :-P ... kids who drank or got high or had sex (this was the 70&#39;s and I was a GOOD girl hehehe). I never did that stuff myself, and my mom always believed me. She was very honest about her opinions of my friends, but she would always finish by saying &quot; ... but I trust your judgment about it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many of my friends were afraid of/disgusted with their parents. I never had those feelings. Even if we had a big, serious argument (which we did!), even if things *looked* bad, I knew my mother&#39;s faith in me could not be shaken.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great gift. <br/>

at will i do not,,in my opion its a matter of what words your using <br/>
and if you can hurt other people by using them,therefore it comes <br/>
down to which words you us,,,<br/>
<br/>
The reason we have this policy is so that our kids will feel free to <br/>
communicate openly about everything in their lives. there isn&#39;t MUCH <br/>
swearing, anyway, but I use the &quot;s&quot; word and once in awhile, say <br/>
the &quot;f&quot; word. We don&#39;t call each other names. In fact, we frown upon <br/>
glaring daggers at each other, much preferring to talk than glare or <br/>
heave a sigh and mope or roll eyeballs. If something is bugging a kid <br/>
enough to make her glare at me, I&#39;d rather she SAID &quot;You interrupted <br/>
me&quot; or whatever, than just get a disgusted angry look on her face and <br/>
say nothing. <br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;free cussing at will&quot; L sounds like a potty-mouth fest but it <br/>
isn&#39;t. I just don&#39;t forbid them to use those words around me. I&#39;d <br/>
rather have them say it in my hearing, than save it only for their <br/>
friends, presenting me with a facade.<br/>

<br/>
   My best friend got pregnant in high school.  I went with her to the Dr <br/>
when she found out she was pregnant   We came back to my house and went in my <br/>
bedroom.  My mom came and gently knocked on the door.  I let her in and she <br/>
asked what was wrong.  My friend ( and I , too) was crying.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
hesitate for a minute.. I said.. &quot;Dawn&#39;s going to have a baby&quot;  Moma teared <br/>
up too and she sat down on the bed and hugged Dawn, and said, &quot;oh, <br/>
sweetheart, it&#39;s going to be OK&quot;.  We all had a good cry, and Dawn asked Moma <br/>
if she would call in to her work to tell them she was sick.  Mom did it.  <br/>
That was it.  No lecture to me, no warnings of  &quot;dont hang arond her&quot;   The <br/>
extent of Mom&#39;s input about the situation was to ask me how Dawn was doing <br/>
and to talk to me about how I felt about it and how it affected Dawn.   Never <br/>
a passing of judgement or a waiver of trust in me.  How wonderful<br/>
<br/>
    Dawn had a good mother too, but she was still scared to tell her she was <br/>
pregnant.  She didnt tell her family til she was 4 months along, and by then, <br/>
her mom had figured it out herself.   They didn&#39;t &quot;punish&quot; or &quot;disown&quot; her or <br/>
anything like that.. They supported her and helped her didn&#39;t demand that she <br/>
marry her boyfriend.   But, her boyfriends parents said, ABORTION or <br/>
MARRIAGE!  Thier son was not going to have a bastard child.  So, they got <br/>
married and spent 10 years in a terrible marriage til they got divorced.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I rambled as usual.  sorry.. I can never keep it short<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny story. A month or so ago Jason&#39;s best friend was over playing (they are both 6).<br/>
I heard him tell Jason about this &quot;bad&quot; word he had learned at school...shit. I was just<br/>
over in the kitchen and so I piped up and asked him if he knew what it meant. He said no<br/>
so I told him it meant poop. He seemed a little disappointed. ;o) Jason did not seem overly<br/>
interested either and I have yet to hear him use it.<br/>
