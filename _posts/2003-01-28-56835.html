&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Will this C+ from <br/>
a high school stand out as proof that homeschool hasn&#39;t <br/>
educated him enough when we apply to colleges? Am I <br/>
overcompensating in my head by saying he&#39;s actually smart <br/>
when really he isn&#39;t because the tests are proving it?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;THIS IS SCARY.<br/>
This is not an unschooling attitude, if you&#39;re thinking that tests <br/>
scores <br/>
prove or disprove &quot;smart.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I know that in my knower but I needed to get &quot;support.&quot; Isn&#39;t <br/>
that what this group is for?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to think that way. I&#39;m trying to dump it. I need to hear it <br/>
about, oh, 100 more times, perhaps. Isn&#39;t that the purpose of this <br/>
list? To repeat yourselves to newbies like us over and over <br/>
again? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Have your kids taken four years of math for college prep? <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I&#39;m surprised you would honestly ask unschoolers that. NO.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I didn&#39;t know. I guess I thought if some kids felt they <br/>
needed to get prepared for college in computers, they may be <br/>
doing math but by their own initiative. Grace Llewellyn&#39;s books <br/>
point that out and she recommends Saxon, of all things (which <br/>
my kids hate). But I figured some of you may have done it in <br/>
creative ways hence my question.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Did you take four years of math before you went to college? <br/>
New Mexico <br/>
requires two. I took ONE. I got a degree at 21.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I took two and a half years at which point my teacher told me to <br/>
quit so I wouldn&#39;t ruin my GPA (which was really high, but I was <br/>
miserable in math). I was aimed at theater arts, however, not <br/>
technology. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is there someone there who could dash cold water on you <br/>
maybe?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL Okay, I&#39;ll go take a cold shower.<br/>
<br/>
I just need to know that I can come here for suggestions and <br/>
reminders.<br/>
<br/>
I do appreciate the help everyone&#39;s offered.<br/>

No.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a &quot;support group,&quot; technically speaking.<br/>
<br/>
But even if it is, I don&#39;t consider supporting people in NOT unschooling to <br/>
be anything I personally want to do!<br/>
<br/>
I want to support you to turn away from the school and see your children in <br/>
the light of the lack of school. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
