<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043679455">Hello all! We&#39;re going to embark on a new stage of our homeschooling <br/>
journey! On Feb 1, 2001 our family is going to travel the 48 states <br/>
in a motor home! Our family includes myself, Aimee 28 yrs. old, my <br/>
husband Mark, 33 and our 2 daughters, Alexandria (age 7) and Tabitha <br/>
(1 1/2).<br/>
Our plan is to spend about a week in each state. The reason I&#39;m <br/>
writing is we&#39;d love to hear from homeschoolers in other states about <br/>
what are some &quot;don&#39;t miss&quot; activities in your area/state, also we&#39;d <br/>
love to hear about what&#39;s unique to your area. <br/>
Homeschoolers seem to often have great ideas that aren&#39;t listed in <br/>
&quot;guide books&quot;! <br/>
We&#39;re not looking for amusement parks, one thing we&#39;re doing for sure <br/>
are staying with Omish friends in Indiana so that we can really <br/>
experience their life. I&#39;m looking for any ideas along this line! <br/>
Thank you so much for your help in this matter! Please contact me at <br/>
