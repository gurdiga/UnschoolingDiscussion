 </span></blockquote>I would like to respond to your last question.<br/>
<br/>
First, I just want to say that I believe that unschooling is, by far, <br/>
the best way to let your children grow.  I am the mother of 7-year-old <br/>
unschooling twin boys.  I am also a former public high school geography <br/>
teacher.   I have seen and experienced first-hand, the damage that years <br/>
of schooling does to children, including myself.<br/>
<br/>
Public schools &quot;say&quot; they accommodate ADD children, but let me tell you <br/>
it is impossible for them to do so.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for <br/>
them to accommodate *anyone* when teachers such as I are assigned a <br/>
student load of between 150 - 190 students!  Even an elementary school <br/>
teacher with a ratio of 1:15 can not accommodate all his/her students, <br/>
ADD or no ADD.<br/>
<br/>
At my high school I was what was called an Inclusion Teacher.  This <br/>
means that 2 or 3 of the 6 geography classes I taught were Inclusion <br/>
classes.  Inclusion classes are those with between 5-15 special <br/>
education students (these include ADD students) learning side by side <br/>
with the so-called &quot;regular&quot; students.  There was usually a total of <br/>
30-35+ students in the class.  Inclusion classes also have an extra <br/>
teacher (special-ed certified) present in the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
I was very outspoken about my ideas on inclusion.  I was the only <br/>
teacher in the whole school who was for it. I found it very offensive to <br/>
see special ed kids separated from the regular-ed kids.  Inclusion <br/>
receives a lot of resistance from the teachers because it makes them <br/>
work so much harder.  Unfortunately, this work I am talking about <br/>
includes lots and lots of documentation that has to be made to prove <br/>
that you have made the modifications for the special ed students.<br/>
<br/>
These are some of the modifications I used to accommodate my special-ed <br/>
students:<br/>
<br/>
	1.  Allowed them to have more time to complete their homework or <br/>
classwork, if they needed it (this meant I had to make a note to myself <br/>
to remember to ask for this work at a future date - remember, I&#39;ve got <br/>
150+ students, I can&#39;t keep this in my head!)<br/>
<br/>
	2. Shorter and easier assignments (This must be noted in my grade-book)<br/>
<br/>
	3. Use an easier-to-read atlas. (This is noted in their IEP <br/>
(Individual Education Plan))<br/>
<br/>
	4. Allow them to have their own book to take home if the regular-ed <br/>
kids must use the class-room set.<br/>
<br/>
	5.  Easier and shorter versions of my quizzes/tests, etc.  (this <br/>
means I have to type up 2 versions of everything.  I was also an ESL <br/>
teacher, teaching 5 different levels of ESL(English as a  Second <br/>
Language) students, so I actually had 6 different versions of all my <br/>
quizzes, tests, Classroom/Homework assignments so I could accommodate <br/>
every one, supposedly!)<br/>
<br/>
	6. Special ed kids usually get preferential seating, usually at the <br/>
front of the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
	7.  More contact with the parents.  I made it a point to call 3 <br/>
parents every day of the week.  On weekdays, I did this from home in the <br/>
evening, after school.  I would go down my long list of students <br/>
(special ed students were always at the top, so they got more calls) and <br/>
telephone the parents of students that needed extra attention.  Both <br/>
negative and positive calls were made.<br/>
<br/>
	8.  All of my students were given my home telephone number and <br/>
email address, in case they ever had an questions or concerns and they <br/>
wanted to communicate with me in the evenings or on weekends.  I made an <br/>
extra effort with my special ed kids and their parents to assure them <br/>
that I was always available.  I would also work in my classroom until <br/>
5PM every afternoon.  My door would be open to anyone who needed any <br/>
extra help in any subject, not just geography.  I also made myself <br/>
available during my lunch time since I usually ate in my classroom.  I <br/>
would allow them to eat with me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I loved and cared for my students very much and, in a way, I miss being <br/>
a teacher.  But, let me tell you, I worked very, very hard and tried my <br/>
best to accommodate every one, especially my special-ed students, and I <br/>
know, with all certainty, that in NO WAY did I come close to <br/>
accommodating ANY of my students the way that I know a loving, caring <br/>
parent can!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long but I want to say one more thing.  If your son <br/>
decides to return to public school and he has been labeled as ADD, he <br/>
may be classified as a Special Ed student.  From my experience with many <br/>
other teachers (but, not all) here in Houston, Texas, the term &quot;Special <br/>
Ed.&quot; has a negative connotation.  It is unfortunate that with many (but <br/>
not all) teachers, when they see that star next to a student&#39;s name <br/>
signifying him/her as special-ed, their reaction is immediately <br/>
negative.  Thoughts of disruptive behiavior and extra work for the <br/>
teacher immediately come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
  Like in any other profession, there are some very caring and good <br/>
teachers and then there are some bad teachers.  Even though those who <br/>
try their very best to give everything they can to as many of their <br/>
students as possible, they can not give to those children what their <br/>
parents can give them for those 8+ hours of every day.  This is how I <br/>
feel about things and these have been some of my experiences.<br/>
