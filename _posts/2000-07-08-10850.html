I am so envious of you... that would be the soap to watch if I could get it <br/>
here.  Eastenders is only about a week behind because now we have the digital <br/>
satelite.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-268042309">It&#39;s funny, we don&#39;t watch Eastenders or Corrie, (dh is a big snob <br/>
about stuff like that) but we do watch ER, and Third Watch, <br/>
which are pretty soap-ish, really.  I like Casualty but he doesn&#39;t so <br/>
I don&#39;t often get to watch it.<br/>
