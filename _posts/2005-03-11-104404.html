<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477074033">Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m coming to the biggest list to ask for some input on this.  My dh <br/>
and I are considering moving from Florida to California.  I would <br/>
like to hear from anyone who lives in California and unschools, where <br/>
in California do you live and what do you feel your area offers to <br/>
your unschooling/surfing lifestyle. We both work in healthcare and <br/>
could get a travel assignment for  three months at a time but I would <br/>
like some idea for areas to try for with the agencies.<br/>
<br/>
TIA for any input<br/>
<br/>
Cheryl</div>
