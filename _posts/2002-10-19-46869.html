<div id="ygrps-yiv-98767411">Hey, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been sitting here going over old messages, looking for Karen <br/>
Tucker&#39;s e-mail address...and, frankly, I&#39;M TIRED OF IT!!<br/>
<br/>
If someone has it, could you please send it to me?  My boys made <br/>
friends with her son, Will, at the conference, and they miss him...so <br/>
we wanted to write to him.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU!<br/>
<br/>
~ Anne<br/>
