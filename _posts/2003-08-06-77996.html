&lt;&lt; Could there be contrived playing?  What I mean is if the mothers set <br/>
<br/>
up their kids to play and the kids don&#39;t even know each other, don&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
you think that&#39;s a bit contrived? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the families already know each other except for that kid in school and the <br/>
families got together, it would be way less contrived than kids meeting each <br/>
other in school.  At least there would be some common  ground.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were little when they were meeting other little unschoolers.  Lots of <br/>
them are all in the 14-20 age range now, but they didn&#39;t meet as teens <br/>
(except a few through the other teens, which is also contrived, or not, depending on <br/>
the situation).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s rough now, though, when someone just contacts me cold and says &quot;I have a <br/>
14 year old boy; you do too.&quot;  All I can ever say is &quot;Is he interested in <br/>
gaming?  Kirby works at Active Imagination, and I think Marty will be there <br/>
Wednesday.&quot;   I can&#39;t just invite a kid over that age, alone, and ask my kids to <br/>
hang out.  <br/>
<br/>
Better when there are families involved or a real connection somehow.<br/>

Since when do kids care what a house looks like?<br/>
Maybe you&#39;d feel better if you saw the total chaos I like in. The <br/>

&lt;&lt; My house is never clean enough to have kids I don&#39;t know over for a<br/>
playdate.  I would feel like I had to scrub and I am no Martha Stuart.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean this in a bad way, but it&#39;s your problem. You can get over it.<br/>
I take my kids every week to a house where we do crafts. The house is<br/>
nothing like mine at all. There is stuff everywhere. You have to move things<br/>
just to sit down on the couch or dining room chair. My first thought when I<br/>
went there was &quot;Oh My!!&quot; To myself of course. There are animals everywhere.<br/>
The house looks like a tornado when through it, literally. My kids<br/>
absolutely love going there. They can&#39;t wait for Wednesdays. It was<br/>
cancelled today and they were heartbroken. And you know what, even though I<br/>
would never have my house look that way, I love going over too. We all just<br/>
have the best time there and I really admire this woman to open her house up<br/>
to us all regardless of what it looks like. She did comment that she worries<br/>
about what others think, but doesn&#39;t care enough to stop because her kids<br/>
enjoy it so much. (having the others come over to play) I really try to use<br/>
this woman as an example to me and not be so darn anal about what my house<br/>
looks like when I have someone over. The kids really don&#39;t *see* it.<br/>
<br/>
We went for the first time to a good friends house a couple weeks ago. They<br/>
always come over here. There&#39;s more to do here and I don&#39;t mind at all. When<br/>
we went to their house, the kids had fun. My mom was later asking me about<br/>
it and I mentioned how small the house was and how many people were there in<br/>
reference to Alyssa being very shy until some people left and there was room<br/>
to breath. Sierra heard me and asked me with much shock if I thought the<br/>
house was really small. She didn&#39;t think so at all. It was funny because I<br/>
could put there house inside my living and dining room. Made no difference<br/>
to me, but I realized how kids just don&#39;t see things like some of us do.<br/>
<br/>
Invite the kids and people over, forget about worrying what they will think<br/>
and you will all have fun. And if by some chance they do have a problem with<br/>
it, they&#39;re probably not the kind of people you want to hang out with<br/>
anyway.<br/>

People are talking about the ideas of all kinds of kids at THEIR houses, not <br/>
about you at your house, I think.<br/>

Throw out an idea and let other ideas swirl.  <br/>

I don&#39;t think people are intending to jump you.  They are just arguing <br/>
with your concept that guest-kids are likely to care what the house <br/>
looks like.<br/>
<br/>
I figure guest kids will think something like &quot;Your mom doesn&#39;t make you <br/>
clean your room -- how cool!&quot;<br/>

We haven&#39;t been going that long. I belong to a smaller local hs support<br/>
group and we&#39;ve just started to go to some things they are having. One lady<br/>
in the group decided herself she would have craft day once a week at her<br/>
house. She has 3 kids and seems very crafty herself with ideas I just don&#39;t<br/>
think of. She has a large folding table in her playroom area with access to<br/>
all kinds of paints, paper, shells etc. So that&#39;s where the kids do stuff.<br/>
She comes up with the ideas and anyone else who has a great idea can offer<br/>
to bring things for the following week. I just bring the drinks and snacks<br/>
and supplies when I&#39;m told. &lt;BG&gt; The very first thing my kids did was make a<br/>
mini rain forest. It cost $4.00 per child for that one. They made them in<br/>
big soda bottles which we brought and she supplied all the dirt and other<br/>
stuff we put in the bottles. She bought little plants to put in there too.<br/>
Then we made wind chimes from seashells. She didn&#39;t charge anything for that<br/>
one. It was shells she had collected (we&#39;re in FL) and string and some round<br/>
wooden thingies she had. Then someone else brought in little crafts from the<br/>
Oriental Trading Co. which she bought 12 of for like 5 bucks. She didn&#39;t<br/>
charge us for those either. Little foam hands that the kids cut out (in the<br/>
shape of their own hand) decorated and attached a clothespin to. It had a<br/>
magnet on the back you can attach to the fridge and it was like a reminder<br/>
clip or a chore (gasp) list or something. Kids really liked those. We were<br/>
to do tie dye T shirts today but it was cancelled. I was supplying the<br/>
rubber bands and everyone was to bring their own shirt. She supplied the dye<br/>
and didn&#39;t charge us for that either. Of course we all help out with<br/>
bringing supplies when she needs them and food and stuff too. I made her a<br/>
homeschooling T shirt today and also came home with a kitten!!! Not a craft<br/>
but the real thing. He&#39;s curled up with Tara now.<br/>
