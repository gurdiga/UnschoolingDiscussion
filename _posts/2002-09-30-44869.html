 </span></blockquote>From what I know, heartworm is a worm (parasite) that grows in and around<br/>
the dogs heart. I think the only way a dog can get heartworm (or at least<br/>
the most common way) is by being bit by a mosquito that has previously bit a<br/>
dog that has heartworm. So the mosquito is a carrier and passes the<br/>
heartworm larvae by the mixing of the blood. Kind of the same way the West<br/>
Nile Virus is being spread. You can give your dog heartworm preventative<br/>
medicine which protects the dogs from the heartworm parasite and other<br/>
parasites/worms as well. My vet strongly recommended that we give our dog<br/>
heartworm pills even though we hardly have any mosquitos here in Phoenix<br/>
(AZ). Apparently, once the dog gets a heartworm, it is very  hard to treat<br/>
and can be deadly - so prevention is key.<br/>

When/If you enquire about heartworm to your vet, they can do (will probably<br/>
recommend) a blood test to determine if your dog already has heartworm. If<br/>
all is well, you can buy heartworm pills for about $30 for a six month<br/>
supply - at least that&#39;s what mine cost (I&#39;m using the brand Interceptor).<br/>
The cost is not too terribly bad.<br/>
Good luck ~<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well that really depends on the vet you find. My old vet which is a teaching <br/>
center as well became extremely expensive and you saw someone different <br/>
every time you went. We then tried two other vets that just didn&#39;t sit well <br/>
with me. I need someone to listen to me and what I know about my animals, <br/>
then I&#39;ll ask what I don&#39;t. We finally found a one vet practice just down <br/>
the road and if I knew of a typical country vet, this guy would be it. He <br/>
listens and when our bullmastiff puppy came down with mange, he was the only <br/>
one that let us treat it the way we wanted to without trying to force his <br/>
ways. His prices are extremely reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yuck. Is it worth doing an old dog who might die before infestation<br/>
gets too bad? Are the pills toxic?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what you are asking. If it&#39;s an old dog that actually has <br/>
heartworms, I would say not to treat. It takes a lot out of a dog and if <br/>
they aren&#39;t young and healthy, it&#39;s not the best for the animal. If it&#39;s an <br/>
old dog who hasn&#39;t been given a heartworm preventative, then a simple blood <br/>
test will tell you if they have it or not. If not, then the heartworm meds <br/>
are no big deal. But that last part is a matter of decision also. Our older <br/>
Lab only went out for walks as we didn&#39;t have  a fenced in yard at that <br/>
time. I sprayed him down with Adams before he left the house and didn&#39;t use <br/>
heartworm meds on him in his older age. Our two puppies now spend a lot of <br/>
time outside running around and we use preventative year round.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Like frontline? Didn&#39;t that stuff kill a bunch of cats and cause<br/>
seizures in dogs.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I guess similar to Frontline and just like with any med, there are <br/>
always contraindications that could lead to death. Again, just like with <br/>
people meds and vaccines, it&#39;s a judgement call.<br/>

I do treat for heartworm prevention but elect to do frequent bathing to <br/>
control fleas, etc.<br/>
And yes- my dog is little- she is a pipsqueak and easy to bathe.  (After <br/>
years and years of only owning big, black labs we rescued a Jack <br/>
Russell. There are other differences besides stature. Oh, my!)<br/>
<br/>
The Frontline, etc. enters the bloodstream, attaches to fat cells and <br/>
then coats every single hair ...can not be washed off.<br/>
another medical experiment on our kids, in my opinion... the furniture <br/>
is covered with the stuff, the floor, (if you have a crawling baby...) <br/>
and every time the kids pet the animal , they get a coating on their <br/>
hands- which are always in their mouths...<br/>
Most of the chemicals are endocrine receptors...<br/>
worth some looking into if you are considering using them and have kids, <br/>
me thinks.<br/>
<br/>
People have had pets for some time now (centuries)- WITHOUT- these <br/>
chemicals...<br/>
<br/>
Love, another opinion.<br/>

Well I&#39;m not really familiar with Frontline but I&#39;m not sure that it does <br/>
enter the bloodstream. From what I know it stays on the skin and in the hair <br/>
follicles. It&#39;s also been used as a pesticide for years.<br/>
<br/>
Revolution is a totally different kind of drug that does enter the blood <br/>
stream circulating through the body and back to the sebaceous glands of the <br/>
animal. Yes it does stay there but I personally don&#39;t see where it remains <br/>
in such strong amounts for me to worry about my house being coated with it. <br/>
My dogs would be dead otherwise. Again, it&#39;s a judgement call and I&#39;m <br/>
satisfied with my homework. (excuse the dirty word!)<br/>
