<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979950327">Maybe I&#39;m out of touch here, but why on earth would a man want to<br/>
prevent his children from being breast fed.  Shouldn&#39;t we be focusing on<br/>
whats in the best interest of the children and not thinking about what<br/>
might be an uncomfortable situation for us.  Both of our children were<br/>
breast fed for as long as my wife was able.  I can&#39;t imagine having it<br/>
any other way.  Of course I also realize the choice was never mine to<br/>
make, although my wife did discuss it with me and let me know why she<br/>
felt it was best for her and the children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With all due respect to men who support breast feeding......<br/>
I&#39;ve run into this situation with friends whose husbands have told them<br/>
they were NOT going to be ALLOWED to breasted.<br/>
Why?....because it would interfere with their sexual needs....they would<br/>
feel awkward about having relations with a lactating woman. It was said<br/>
that bluntly in *friendly* discussion.<br/>
These men can&#39;t deal with their wives being there for the child&#39;s<br/>
benefit over their needs.<br/>
It is unfortunate but there are men out there that really feel this way.<br/>
