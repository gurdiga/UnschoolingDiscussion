<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579647501">I&#39;ve been reading here for several weeks and haven&#39;t seen this situation <br/>
addressed, so here goes.  (Be gentle with me -- it&#39;s my first time :-)<br/>
<br/>
My ds is now almost 15 and liberated himself from the educational system a <br/>
year and a half ago, after being rather brutally oppressed by that system for <br/>
over 8 years.  By the time I snapped to the reality and to our options, and <br/>
by the time I convinced everyone (including him) to give hs&#39;ing a try, his <br/>
intellectual curiosity and joy for learning, which had always been such a key <br/>
part of him, had almost completely been extinguished.  Because of the clear <br/>
damage done to him and because I identified him as a kinesthetic learner and <br/>
a random-abstract thinker, we embraced unschooling from the very beginning.  <br/>
Overcoming my own programming, and relaxing through the deschooling process <br/>
has probably been our most difficult hurdle, really, but I&#39;m making progress, <br/>
and his has been nothing short of miraculous.  He&#39;s happy, loves unschooling <br/>
and free learning, is adjusting beautifully in many, many ways.  I&#39;ve got my <br/>
bright and eager, irrepressible son back, and for that I will be forever <br/>
grateful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve hit a bump, though, and need some input.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been busy with deschooling over the last year and a half, staying <br/>
connected to learning through many of the recommended means -- museum trips, <br/>
watching movies and reading books of all kinds, late nights watching meteor <br/>
showers, simply playing and living, etc.  He has taken the apprenticeship <br/>
concept deeply to heart and now works with a local university&#39;s coastal <br/>
studies program and with a small computer company, building systems, <br/>
initiating these activities on his own.  No problems there.<br/>
<br/>
He is just recently starting to enthusiastically reach out to opportunities <br/>
for more structured learning on his own.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s been happening, though, is that he will express an interest in <br/>
something, will make an attempt at pursuing that interest for himself, and <br/>
will be unable to follow through effectively.  I wasn&#39;t concerned about this <br/>
at first, figuring that it was part of the process.  Plus, he was <br/>
experimenting.  Not every area of interest was going to work into a genuine <br/>
pursuit, you know?<br/>
<br/>
The problem now is that it&#39;s happening so frequently, and he&#39;s beginning to <br/>
experience some frustration.  Most significantly, he&#39;s now starting to ask me <br/>
-- with some regularity -- to sign him up for classes in these areas of <br/>
interest.  While I am not opposed to classes, in and of themselves, I am <br/>
coming to believe that he hasn&#39;t yet developed the necessary faith in his <br/>
ability to learn on his own, and I don&#39;t know how to help him over this hump.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to play the guitar, for instance.  He knows kids who have taught <br/>
themselves.  I make sure he has time to hang out with them and that he has <br/>
the needed tools.  He has learned some basic chords and tips from his aunt.  <br/>
He began enthusiastically enough, but it didn&#39;t come easily and he tells me <br/>
that he needs a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
He wants to learn basic computer programming.  He begs me to take him to the <br/>
store to find self-guided books on the subject.  I also help him find online <br/>
tutorials.  He plays with these things for an hour or two, it doesn&#39;t come <br/>
easily, he tells me he wants to take a class.<br/>
<br/>
He spends a Sunday morning flipping hotcakes for a youth breakfast, has a <br/>
blast, and tells me he wants to lean more about cooking.  I&#39;m a pretty decent <br/>
cook myself and could use the help in the kitchen anyway.  I tell him, sure.  <br/>
What would you like to cook?  We could start with Chinese (his favorite -- as <br/>
a matter of fact we&#39;ve cooked a very successful authentic Chinese meal <br/>
together before), but no.  He wants to take a culinary arts class at the <br/>
local community college.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or is there a pattern here?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve given you enough information (despite the length of this <br/>
post) to make an accurate diagnosis, so you might want to ask me some <br/>
clarifying questions.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me, though, that he is beginning to recover his lively <br/>
appreciation of learning, but has no faith in his ability to move forward <br/>
under his own power.  He falls repeatedly back into the passive posture of <br/>
thinking that he needs someone else to teach it to him.<br/>
<br/>
My gut is telling me that he is having trouble overcoming his own ps <br/>
conditioning, but I don&#39;t quite know how to help him through this phase of <br/>
the transition.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you can afford to, I would let him sign up for those classes.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to commit to any two-year culinary institute just to take one class.  <br/>
And the others sound like things he just wants to see someone ELSE do, <br/>
honestly.<br/>
<br/>
Plus...  Maybe he wants to meet people.  <br/>
<br/>
And seeing someone else cook and THEN seeing you cook will be so much more <br/>
three-dimensional for him, both as to cooking and socially.<br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;re right and he think learning some things is easier with classes, <br/>
could be that&#39;s true for him, or it could be that going back and taking a few <br/>
classes will remind him of how much frustration comes with the instruction.<br/>
<br/>
Or not. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be wishy washy.  I&#39;m trying to remind you that avoiding ALL <br/>
lessons and instruction can be too much.  Some things do need a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I tried several times to teach myself calligraphy.  I needed a lesson.  I <br/>
needed one session with a teacher to teach me how to use the pens and ink, <br/>
what angle what was, what those little angle marks and stuff meant in the <br/>
calligraphy manuals, and I was off.<br/>
<br/>
One guitar lesson is all I ever had, but I really needed that one lesson.  <br/>
Someone needed (again) to teach me the lingo, to see how I was holding it and <br/>
coach me, to show me what to watch for when I watched other guitar player, <br/>
and how chord charts worked.<br/>
<br/>
Some people learn lots better from seeing and hearing and thinking than from <br/>
reading and trying.  And different things are learned different ways by the <br/>
same person.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s lack of faith.  I think it&#39;s growing up and good <br/>
indications of real interest (at least in getting out of the house where <br/>
other people are).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1963243358">I say, contact your local rec center and see if they offer classes that will <br/>
git his interests.  Personally, I see NO problem wanting to take a class, so <br/>
long as it is the child initiating the request.  Sometimes it IS <br/>
easier...and even more FUN...to take a class with other people with similar <br/>
interests.  Unschooling, for me, is not the rejection of being taught by <br/>
choice, it is the rejection of being taught by *force* or imposition.<br/>
<br/>
Rec centers are usually quite reasonably priced and the terms are often <br/>
short...8 weeks or so.  Just enough to get his feet wet and give him that <br/>
bit of confidence he seems to be seeking.  It&#39;s worth a shot!<br/>
