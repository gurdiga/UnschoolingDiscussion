<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330378170">This is soo interesting Laura...  I&#39;m sorry to hear the struggle for you.  I<br/>
always have the opposite going on.<br/>
After relatives (usually with children) leave I feel so happy my children are who<br/>
they are....<br/>
It is hard to answer the questions about why my son, who is 8 isn&#39;t reading much<br/>
yet.  I am always happy to see them go so I can look at my children from my own<br/>
eyes, and I know they are wonderful human beings...which is my goal!<br/>

&gt; Thanks Ann. My daughter&#39;s birthday is next weekend. My parents and my in-laws<br/>
&gt; will come. I love them all, but ... what is that feeling I&#39;m trying to<br/>
&gt; describe ... I feel pulled back into a &quot;good little girl&quot; role when they are<br/>
&gt; here. Seeking approval. &quot;Look, look at how great my kids are, gang! Aren&#39;t I<br/>
&gt; DOING A GREAT JOB?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yuck. They leave and I&#39;m disgusted with myself. Sooo ... this time I am<br/>
&gt; trying HARDER to remind myself to let my life speak for itself. What is that<br/>
&gt; quote I can&#39;t call to mind right now? Something about not being able to hear<br/>
&gt; your words because your personality is speaking too loudly? Is it Twain? Help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for the ramble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Laura<br/>
