battle for a chanve to get to read Harry Potter myself. Over the last <br/>
3 weeks he&#39;s read all 4 books through 3 times. I&#39;ve finally got to <br/>
book 4 but have to keep pausing when he reaches it again and <br/>
wants it. Grrrrrrrrr. Will I ever find out if Proffessor Snape is a <br/>
baddie or not!!!!<br/>
When Book 5 comes out I am buying several copies :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and don&#39;t tell me if Snape is secretly working for Voldemort. <br/>
I&#39;ve got 2 chaptets to go.<br/>

Moly asks someone when the next book will be out. Last winter she was told <br/>
*there is a law suit with another author who claims he/she (?) wrote books <br/>
called Larry Potter, and J K Rowling stole the idea, so it won&#39;t be out till <br/>
sometime in the spring* This spring, she was told *maybe July or August* LOL <br/>
Two weeks ago, she was told *Maybe in January or February sometime!* Poor <br/>
Moly :o( she waits on pins and needles! <br/>

Still, none of Mr Rickman&#39;s performance was as funny as the casting of a<br/>
Scotsman as the French speaking king of England. Still with Sir Sean&#39;s<br/>
well known talent for perfecting accents I&#39;m sure no-one noticed :-)<br/>

and I showed him how to dance rock n roll style. We had a big long <br/>
discussion about the effects of fame and why pop stars now a days <br/>
not only can&#39;t write their own songs but can&#39;t play instruments <br/>
either. He also wanted to know wht the hip wiggling was censored.<br/>

I collected back then...books, old photos, posters, albums of him singing. <br/>
Later on, there was video (ooohhhh!) and I got some of the movies, too. Tell <br/>

I think the new American Girls series of books, featuring &quot;Kit&quot;, is set<br/>
in the Thirties.  Do you think they would be too simplistic and cutesy<br/>
for Holly?<br/>
<br/>
And on the flip side, the movie about marathon dancing (They Shoot<br/>
Horses, Don&#39;t They?) is probably way too depressing.  Have you done<br/>
Paper Moon?<br/>

Did you know that there was a campaign in California to get everyone to<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;Did anybody else find the Harry Potter 2 movie very choppy?  I never saw it<br/>
in the theatre (we get one weekend in each of two nearby towns here in<br/>
Germany, and I missed them), so I just got it on DVD.  The special effects<br/>
are better in this one, I guess, but it seemed to jump from one scene to<br/>
another really fast.  Just wondered if it was me.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree, but I just figured that it was because there was so much to get in, and it&#39;s already a long movie, so they put in as much as they could to get the story across, for those that haven&#39;t read the books - I dont understand why someone wouldn&#39;t read them, but then thats just me-. I&#39;m guessing that the next movies will be even choppier, being as they are both much longer and full of much more.<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re changing directors.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the first one, but I thought the second one was very much done as a <br/>
boys&#39; movie and it wasn&#39;t written by and for boys.<br/>
<br/>
(Sorry if that seems prejudiced, but that&#39;s how it seems to me.)<br/>
<br/>
Instead of the relationships among the kids being stressed and that being the <br/>
thread that tied scenes together, the stars of this show seemed to be the <br/>
flying car, the whomping willow, the spiders...  They had larger roles in the <br/>
movie than they had in the book.  And Ginny Weasly had very little (and <br/>
deserved way more).<br/>
<br/>
Moaning Myrtle wasn&#39;t moaning so much as she was squealing and whining, too.  <br/>
That bothered me some.<br/>
<br/>
But the kids liked it, and that&#39;s good.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if they&#39;ve decided who will do Dumbledore now?<br/>

<br/>
Right.  They took out all of the everyday conversations, classes,<br/>
homework and not-super-dramatic events.<br/>
<br/>
My reaction to the movie, even after reading the book 4 times, was &quot;man,<br/>
this is a scary place to go to school!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I think ALL schools are scary, so that&#39;s saying something! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
