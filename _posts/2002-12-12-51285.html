<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347922069">I am apparently receiving digests out of order so I will respond as best I<br/>

&lt;&lt;How old is he?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Zach is 9.  He has always been a difficult child, has trouble accepting any<br/>
kind of limits, keeps himself strung so tight you could bounce quarters off<br/>
of him.  I had not really thought about the adoption thing being part of<br/>
this until I wrote it out.  Now I&#39;m almost sure it is.  The timing is right<br/>
and I recall a couple of supposedly humorous comments about dh and I not<br/>
being his parents.  Well, I guess I don&#39;t get unschooler of the year OR mom<br/>
of the year  :(<br/>
<br/>
If nothing else, the last couple of days have been a chance for us to<br/>
regroup and step away from our resentments for each other.  Zach just went<br/>
to bed with a big hug and told me he hopes tomorrow is just like today.  I<br/>
think he really did see the controls I put in place as me &quot;babying&quot; him.<br/>
With 3 younger siblings, my lap is rarely empty so perhaps this has been<br/>
some kind of twisted cuddling.  Now that I have a clearer picture as to what<br/>
is going on, I think I can make sure we have time for the right kind of<br/>
cuddling and hopefully move back away from imposed structure.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the sounding board.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463155799">I also agree.  I feel that unschooling is different for each person, just as we are all different.  I have learned a long time ago, take what you like and leave the rest.  This has been my moto in  my life.  I am new and my first post caught me off guard.  I will not respond to someone more than once if I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s for the positive and growth.  I am not the type of person who is afraid of conflict.  I feel it&#39;s important to express how one is feeling, this is how we grow, learn and respect one another.  <br/>
Everyone has thier own way to get to balance in  thier life.  I can not say that my way is right and your way is wrong.  We each have different needs and priorities.  I find balance comes from allow my children freedom to be who the are, security to feelo safe, love to know that thier are needed and peace knowing you have faith in tham and trust them this is how we, my family creates balance in our life.<br/>

What kinds of things are you talking about that unschoolers do <br/>
differently from each other?  Are you talking about different people <br/>
having different religions or some people being vegetarians, or are <br/>
you talking about actually unschooling differently?  I&#39;m just not <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel that unschooling is different for each person<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But the unschooling *philosophy* is not different. What unschooling looks<br/>
like in practice will be different in each family but there will be some<br/>
underlying similarities.<br/>
<br/>
A child who picks up math from liking math workbooks is going to look very<br/>
different from a child who picks up math by manipulating the numbers she<br/>
encounters in real life. But the underlying philosophy -- that we trust kids<br/>
to know what they need (assuming they&#39;re able to access what they need!) --<br/>
is there regardless of how the child likes to learn.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is doing something that doesn&#39;t sound like it meshes with the<br/>
unschooling philosophy it&#39;s helpful for those who are silently reading (it&#39;s<br/>
what I did when I started reading about homeschooling) if statements get<br/>
questioned and held up to examination. If I say my daughter learns math from<br/>
workbooks I&#39;d surely want someone to question that! That statement tells<br/>
people something about how someone who calls herself an unschooler has her<br/>
child learn math but it doesn&#39;t help anyone figure out what the philosophy<br/>
of unschooling is or how it works or how they can figure out how to apply it<br/>
to their lives. It&#39;s just an action with no meaning behind it.<br/>
<br/>
So, though unschooling will look different in each family, we need to keep<br/>
talking about *why* we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re doing in order to help people<br/>
understand what unschooling is. The why without the what would be pretty<br/>
esoteric. But the what without the why would devolve the list into something<br/>
more akin to eclectic or relaxed homeschooling. What we do helps people<br/>
understand the unschooling philosophy better -- but only if what we do is<br/>
based on the unschooling philosophy! So actions that don&#39;t sound like they<br/>
fit the unschooling philosophy get questioned.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll bite.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why is not having a bedtime a necessary condition (philosophically) for unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Also, how can we address the fact that advice that makes lots of sense<br/>
for older children may not fit much younger kids?  We have a range of<br/>
kid ages on the list, probably ranging from 0 to 25.  Many parents would<br/>
be very uncomfortable letting a three year old stay up after all the<br/>
older people in the house were asleep, yet general, age-neutral advice<br/>
can make it *sound* like that&#39;s what&#39;s being suggested.  Did anyone mean<br/>
to suggest that very young children can and should stay up alone?<br/>
<br/>
I try to be pretty doctrinaire in my unschooling.  I know that I&#39;ve<br/>
studied up enough to pass whatever unschooling written test is ever<br/>
invented. &lt;g&gt;  But I &quot;cheat&quot; in real life and we have a quieting down<br/>
and getting ready for bed time in my family that I nudge everybody<br/>
about.  I&#39;m also choosing to move this going-to-bedtime from 10 to 9pm<br/>
to help my husband be less exhausted.  My son didn&#39;t ask me to do this,<br/>
but he&#39;s finding it very doable now that it gets dark so early.<br/>
<br/>
When I say &quot;we have a bedtime&quot; I don&#39;t mean that I march my son to his<br/>
bed and leave him there against his protests.  But someone reading my<br/>
words, might jump to the conclusion that bedtime in my family means<br/>
whatever &quot;bedtime&quot; meant in their family of origin.  I understand how<br/>
that could be the first thing that comes to mind, but it isn&#39;t a very<br/>
accurate guess.<br/>
<br/>
I think when we discuss &quot;not having a bedtime&quot; (or whatever exact phrase<br/>
we used) it&#39;s natural for people reading to imagine a conventional home<br/>
scene, just with the bedtime events deleted.  It can be hard to know,<br/>
from reading a few short sentences, what events are added, or the tone<br/>
of these events.  This is just one example of the general case that it&#39;s<br/>
easy to roughly understand what unschooling ISN&#39;T, but it&#39;s hard to<br/>
understand what unschooling IS.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree Betsy, it is confusing. And, you are also right in making the point <br/>
about &quot;age appropiateness&quot; .. I keep thinking and thinking about the freedoms <br/>
of our children.  And our children having a say in what goes on in our <br/>
family.  A very recent incident keeps coming to my mind...<br/>
<br/>
  Our family had planned for over a month on going camping over the <br/>
Thanksgiving holiday.  The week before Thanksgiving, our oldest son, Landon, <br/>
found out that his drama club was going shopping for a needy family on the <br/>
day that we were leaving.  He REALLY enjoys this outing( theyve been doing it <br/>
for 3 years), and I think there was a certain girl involved that he REALLY <br/>
wanted to see.  Anyway, he asked if we could delay our departure until after <br/>
the shopping trip.  There was no way.   The trip was a 6 hour drive, and our <br/>
getting a campsite was contingent on first come first serve, and we couldn&#39;t <br/>
risk getting there late.   If he had went shopping, we couldn&#39;t have left til <br/>
after 2:00 at the earliest.. which was too late to insure getting a campsite <br/>
( plus we would have gotten there after dark, had to set up camp in the dark, <br/>
etc etc)  I told him he could stay at home or with his Grandparents.  The <br/>
choice was his to make.. Stay or go.  The problem was, he wanted to do both. <br/>
. He wanted to go shopping, but he didnt want to miss the whole camping trip. <br/>
 We had to take a majority vote.. Everyone else wanted to leave on  <br/>
Wednesday, so he got voted out... OH BOY was he mad.. no, mad is not the <br/>
word, he was livid.  It really broke my heart for him, because I do remember <br/>
being 16 and the high emotion of &quot;things&quot;  I know he felt like he was missing <br/>
the biggest event in the world.     He pushed and begged and cussed and <br/>
pleaded and tried every guilt inducing trick in the world.  ( same stunts I <br/>
pulled on my parents..lol)  But we had to stand firm..  He had to sacrifice <br/>
his needs and wants for the rest of the family.   Now, maybe some think my <br/>
son is selfish and does not follow principles.  I say, heck, he&#39;s 16 and that <br/>
how kids act.  On the whole, he is a VERY good kid, mature, responsible, and <br/>
considerate.  He was just frustrated over the conflict of scheduling and he <br/>
felt &quot;screwed over&quot; because he didnt get to go with his friends.  He went <br/>
camping with us and after a day of pouting and ignoring us( we left him alone <br/>
to sulk), he came around and he had a really good time.  Deep down he <br/>
understood why we couldnt delay our trip just for him, but he felt like he <br/>
had to make every effort to get his way. <br/>
<br/>
 The purpose of me telling this long story?  Well, its just a practical <br/>
example of how sometimes ( in MY family) we do have to set limits and enforce <br/>
restrictions.  I am curious, as to how &quot;total unschooling&quot; parents would have <br/>
handled the same situation.. And PLEASE dont say the situation would have <br/>
never come up.  If your children are &quot;above and beyond&quot; normal teen <br/>
behaviour, just humor me and speak hypothetically.<br/>

Hi, Teresa --<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing.  But, brace yourself, you&#39;ll probably get<br/>
suggestions now, and that&#39;s frustrating, as there is no way to go back<br/>
in time and change stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I think your example is a great discussion example, if we can keep it<br/>
from feeling &quot;personal&quot; for you.  I can see all sides of the story.  My<br/>
dh is totally paranoid about Thanksgiving traffic.  More than about any<br/>
other traffic throughout the year.  And he pressures me unmercifully to<br/>
get me up and out the door early, early, early.  (Sometimes I think he<br/>
overdoes it!)<br/>
<br/>
I can also remember, as a teen, my mother labling me &quot;manipulative&quot;<br/>
(that hurt!) for using all the methods that your son did to try to get<br/>
what I wanted.  I can&#39;t remember the details of my case, except that it<br/>
was a logistical problem involving my mom, my brother and I, with only<br/>
one car, wanting to go all kinds of far apart different places over the<br/>
course of the weekend.  I kept proposing scenarios and my mom kept<br/>
shooting them down.  She thinks I was trying to make her feel guilty<br/>
(apparently because she DID), but I wasn&#39;t trying to do that, I was just<br/>
trying to get what I wanted.  I had the feeling that her mind was made<br/>
up in advance, and that she wasn&#39;t trying to consider alternatives with<br/>
me.  And, *sometimes*, I&#39;m guilty of doing that with MY son, I&#39;ll<br/>
calculate a complicated logistical scenario in my mind and reduce it to<br/>
&quot;Nope, we don&#39;t have time today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All I can think of in your scenario is (1) gee, I wish the group going<br/>
shopping could have announced the date earlier and (2) maybe some<br/>
alternative transportation to get your son to the camping site a day<br/>
later was possible.  (But, I&#39;m guessing that you already considered<br/>
that.  I know there isn&#39;t great bus transportation to most wilderness<br/>
sites and most forms of transportation are completely full at<br/>
Thanksgiving time.)<br/>

<br/>
DOH!  I just sent something about there being no test, and now I find out <br/>
there might be one!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When I say &quot;we have a bedtime&quot; I don&#39;t mean that I march my son to his<br/>

whatever &quot;bedtime&quot; meant in their family of origin.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a huge difference between a family getting quiet and going to <br/>
sleep and parents declaring that the clock is IT and children will do what <br/>
parents say because it&#39;s good for them to learn to be obedient.   Motivation, <br/>
belief, respect--all kinds of real factors.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when I say &quot;You need to go to bed&quot; to one of my kids or <br/>
another.  Sometimes to company.  But it&#39;s always for some specific reason, <br/>
and it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;You have to go to bed when I say because I am liking <br/>
saying &#39;go to bed.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Real &quot;go to bed&quot; scenarios from the past six months.  I&#39;m thinking there <br/>
might have been eight or so:<br/>
<br/>
Marty and two visiting kids wake me up for the second time, 3:30 a.m. or so, <br/>
being TRULY loud and raucous in the library.  &quot;You guys need to go to bed if <br/>
you can&#39;t be quieter.&quot;  They went to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Holly being exhausted and whimpery and dropping to the floor to whimper, at <br/>
midnight.  &quot;Holly, you need to go to bed.  You&#39;re too sleepy to be nice, and <br/>
you&#39;re not thinking anymore.  Go to bed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby needing to get up early and putzing around aimlessly with less than <br/>
eight hours between him and the alarm.   &quot;Why don&#39;t you  just go to sleep and <br/>
figure this stuff out in the morning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve said the same to my husband if he seemed restless and out of it.  <br/>
It&#39;s not a controlling thing so much as a &quot;Given all factors, it seems you&#39;d <br/>
be better off asleep, because when you wake up all this will be better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Kirby, who usually  has social-life obligations daily, went with us to the <br/>
grandparents&#39; house.  He was so cooperative about it, I did him a really big <br/>
favor, and told the grandparents, when it was just me and them, that I <br/>
figured this might be our last trip as the whole family, that probably Kirby <br/>
would be busy other ways from there on out.   Keith&#39;s mom said the last time <br/>
they had taken Keith on a family trip he was fifteen and pretty resistent.  <br/>
Woohoo!!!! Kirby beat the record and he&#39;s off the hook now.  If he goes back <br/>
to visit with us, it will be a total bonus round.<br/>
<br/>
But we did remind him a couple of times not to commit to anything around <br/>
Thanksgiving, because of that trip.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish your son&#39;s friends could have planned the shopping trip around his <br/>
obligations.  I would suggest to him to let his friends know in advance, next <br/>
time there&#39;s an obligation coming up.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&lt;&lt;He pushed and begged and cussed and <br/>
pleaded and tried every guilt inducing trick in the world.  ( same stunts I <br/>

<br/>
This is another La Leche League trick I learned with babies.  If you think of <br/>
it from his point of view, he wasn&#39;t pulling stunts.  He was negotiating.  If <br/>
you define his actions in a bad light (even in your own head), then it cuts <br/>
him off from your compassion.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone who pulls stunts and cusses is less worthy of consideration than <br/>
someone who is legitimately trying to persuade his parents to make a <br/>
concession for something he really wants.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just words, it&#39;s the thoughts we have that go with those words.<br/>

night since there&#39;s no one around. There&#39;s nothing to do. He knows when he is <br/>

He KNOWS. Most children are believed to NOT KNOW, although they do. We just <br/>
have to <br/>
TRUST.<br/>
And THAT is what is so hard.<br/>

there. He had an option, he chose one of the options. He was very <br/>
disappointed. That&#39;s OK!<br/>
In my family we don&#39;t vote on thisgs, I think it just leads to feeling like <br/>
NO ONE is willing to give the unhappy party a break.<br/>
I would have spent alot of time trying to find ways for him to determine deep <br/>
down what was important and let him know that it was ok to do just the one.<br/>
Was there other options besided staying home or with the Gparents? Could he <br/>
have stayed at a few different friends houses? something really fun to make <br/>
up for missing the camping trip?<br/>

&lt;&lt; That&#39;s why many here say that when you keep telling a child they are X <br/>
(tired, hungry/nothungry, cold) they will take a very very long time to learn <br/>
that they are in faxt X and THEY are capable of doing something about it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Elissa&#39;s points are good, but I want to say that we&#39;re getting a <br/>
carts-before-horses situation building up about some points.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; Why is not having a bedtime a necessary condition (philosophically) for <br/>
 unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is.<br/>
<br/>
I think there have been lots of discussion which started from &quot;Yes, they will <br/>
laern things when it becomes just a fun part of life, or when they need to <br/>
know&quot; go on to &quot;He would watch TV all day if I let him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then we say, &quot;No, if you let him watch all he wants, he will quit at some <br/>
point.  If you don&#39;t let him, he can NEVER quit on his own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So people try that and say &quot;Oh, you were right.  He turns it off more now <br/>
than he did before, and some days it&#39;s not on at all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And some people extend that to &quot;If you let him eat as much candy as he wants, <br/>
he&#39;ll stop.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they do.<br/>
<br/>
And video games; same.<br/>
<br/>
And bedtime; same.<br/>
<br/>
We started off with toddlers we didn&#39;t know would be homeschoolers, and we <br/>
let them sleep late if they wanted, nap when they wanted to, or not at all, <br/>
we let them choose their foods from whatever we had, and let them pick things <br/>
out at the store.   I think it made it easier to unschool since even when <br/>
they were five our kids were already making choices based on real <br/>
considerations, and had learned to sleep when they were tired, eat when they <br/>
were hungry, and not eat when they were NOT hungry.<br/>
<br/>
So while it&#39;s not &quot;necessary,&quot; it can easily be seen as part of the same <br/>
continuum, and involving the same sort of trust and respect.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is such a big, Big, BIG concept. People come over to this list <br/>
and say the same thing they&#39;ve been saying for years, many times the <br/>
same thing their parents said to them. They are totally desensitized <br/>
to the strong power of negative words and thoughts. Someone asks or <br/>
responds to the negativity and they it makes them feel defensive.<br/>
&quot;Why aren&#39;t these thoughts or words OK?&quot;  It can be a painful<br/>
process, <br/>
especially in public, to have one&#39;s very thoughts held up and <br/>
examined.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if there is any less painful way to experience a shift<br/>
in paradigm. Treating children like real humans who deserve respect<br/>
is <br/>
alien to the United States culture and most of the world. We give a <br/>
lot of lip service to families and their values and living in a cute <br/>
little MacDonald&#39;s world but the reality, as any woman who has walked <br/>
out in public with her children is only too aware of, is very harsh. <br/>
<br/>
One small step is changing the negative tapes that play in our head <br/>
and the words we use to our children and to the people we talk to <br/>
about our children. Why not ask oneself, &quot;If I can&#39;t say it <br/>
respectfully without shaming or blaming my child, is it really the <br/>
best way to describe the situation?&quot; We get better at this as we <br/>
practice using words (and Sandra is so very good at this) that<br/>
clearly describe the situation while not blaming or shaming the<br/>
child. <br/>
It is a journey, it doesn&#39;t happen overnight and we might not be <br/>
perfect at it. But we TRY. And we know that it is working when we<br/>
hear <br/>
someone say something that a few weeks or years ago we might have<br/>
said <br/>
ourselves and we feel it like the harsh scrape of lava soap against <br/>
our inner skin.<br/>

 has a special gift of unlimited time and energy with her kids, it <br/>

No one here has advocated this.<br/>

Nothing will turn people against marshmallows like marshmallows!  I just <br/>
threw away half a bag of very stale (not yet wholly petrified) ones from the <br/>
basket near the fireplace where we kept marshmallows and forks.  Last year I <br/>
don&#39;t remember anyone roasting one at all, so this bag could have been over a <br/>

When Kirby was little he would wake up sometimes at midnight or 2:00 a.m. and <br/>
be TRULY and really awake.  There were many times that I put him in a high <br/>
chair with dry cheerios and a cup of juice or other toddler-food, and put on <br/>
a video (my sister had made us a couple of six-hour videos, with Disney <br/>
movies and Winnie the Pooh and stuff).  I told him to call me if he needed <br/>
me.  My bed was thirty feet from there.   I&#39;d get up at 6:00 or 7:00 and find <br/>
him asleep in the chair.  So I started putting blankets around him for <br/>
pillows.<br/>
<br/>
When he was older and I wasn&#39;t worried about him running around, I&#39;d just <br/>
make him a bed on the couch when he woke up from his own bed thinking it was <br/>
time to be awake.<br/>
<br/>
He still can thrive on very little sleep.  So can I.  Others in our family, <br/>
not so well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The kids made gingerbread houses the other day at scouts. When we<br/>
got home, they got really creative!  They were sticking toothpicks in<br/>
every kind of candy, cutting and mashing and making all kinds of people,<br/>
dogs, trees, satellite dishes, you name it.  Then they went on to make<br/>
these geometric figures, like connecting atoms. We left that out for<br/>
a couple of days, until the cats started eating the stuff on the floor. Didn&#39;t<br/>
want sick cats so we decided to eat/destroy the remainder.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Yes, I can understand that. But when someone says &quot;we hired someone to DO <br/>
the <br/>
unschooling&quot; it just doesn&#39;t sound right.<br/>
Perhaps, &quot;we hired a Nanny to help us with the kids&quot; makes more sense. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  Unless unschooling is done and over by the time the parents get <br/>
home and weekends and vacations aren&#39;t unschooling &quot;hours...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
BUT, on the other hand, it might not be so easy to hire a nanny or even a <br/>
babysitter who could come to understand unschooling well enough to really go <br/>
with it.  So you&#39;d have to hire someone capable of unschooling (in the sense <br/>
that unschooling involves relaxing and not &quot;teaching&quot;).<br/>

The toothpick and marshmallow structures burn BEAUTIFULLY in the fireplaces.  <br/>
The marshmallows puff up and the sticks between them, in the small bit left, <br/>
turn red like a lightbulb filament and then burn out, and the marshmallows <br/>
turn black and then the skin peels kinda like the surface of lava breaking <br/>
and flowing off.<br/>
