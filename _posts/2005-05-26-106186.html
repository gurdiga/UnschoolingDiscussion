child,  <br/>
that&#39;s a real and non-arbitrary reason. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-his 18th birthday is the limits of the total<br/>
support I can offer him <br/>
. .  .<br/>
although I will continue to be able to offer him . .<br/>

 <br/>
The choice of &quot;can&quot; and &quot;be able to&quot; means you don&#39;t<br/>
see it as a  <br/>
choice.<br/>
You chose your words, but you&#39;re not choosing your<br/>
actions?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s about aid for a dependent child. but, since I&#39;ve<br/>
received so much flack about this, (as well as about<br/>
homeschooling, all at the same high stress time) I was<br/>
trying to talk around it. when I closed my daycare I<br/>
chose to go back on welfare. I lost &quot;my&quot; welfare, and<br/>
am living partly on &quot;his&quot; and partly on my PT work, as<br/>
I chose not to try to &quot;work&quot; any longer with the<br/>
&quot;welfare to work&quot; social &quot;workers&quot; (lol)as I  could<br/>
not homeschool and work according to their rules and<br/>
constant harassment.  It was clear to me that he<br/>
really needed the TIME WITH ME, after his crisis with<br/>
and in public school, (as well as with circumstances<br/>
beyond my control during his infancy and toddlerhood)<br/>
and that nothing else would help him heal and grow.<br/>
and he needed the time alone with me, not with the<br/>
other daycare kids. and he needed me to not be anxious<br/>
about anything, so I decided to accept &quot;his&quot; welfare<br/>
grant until is 18. I&#39;m glad I made these choices, as<br/>
he is much happier and growing more curious and<br/>
confident every day. (he was suicidal, vandalizing,<br/>
acting out big time in public school 2 years ago.)<br/>
I also live in section 8 housing, which I plan to give<br/>
or loan to him if he wants it any time, so that he<br/>
also will be able to work part time and still survive<br/>
in our rather expensive area.<br/>
I plan to buy a van and hit the road for at least part<br/>
of every year as soon as he is really ready for me to<br/>
do so. I have no idea when that will be.<br/>
