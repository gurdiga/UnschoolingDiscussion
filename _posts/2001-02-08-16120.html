<div id="ygrps-yiv-555732858">There is a Harry Potter Uno-Style game out now.  It&#39;s called Harry Potter<br/>
Uno.  Haven&#39;t checked it out, bc we have Uno already and enjoy it.  Saw<br/>
it at Fred Meyers, in kid&#39;s games, for about $5.<br/>

make the game a bit more unique, but basically the play is still the same.<br/>

PS they also have family puzzles out with large and small pieces that are <br/>
Harry Potter themed too.<br/>

My daughter got one of these for Christmas, and it was really fun, except my <br/>
side was too **hard**.  :-(   I was still working way after she was done, <br/>
although she and her friend were kind enough to help me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593250917">two questions:<br/>
To appreciate the game do you have to know the<br/>
books/characters? (cuz we don&#39;t yet)<br/>
and<br/>
Does anyone have 5/6 yr olds that enjoy hearing the<br/>
Harry Potter books read?<br/>
(I make up such stories of my own for him all the<br/>
time, but the wording and what not is what I&#39;m<br/>
wondering about. comprehensive for him?)<br/>
