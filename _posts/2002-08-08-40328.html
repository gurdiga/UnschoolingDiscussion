<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639740977">&lt;&lt; have you ever wondered if hitler may have <br/>
asked for forgiveness,been forgiven and will be w/ all of you in heaven?i <br/>
have.by the way-hitler was austrian &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&#39;m&#39;kay<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to Heaven if you think there&#39;s any chance Hitler&#39;s there.<br/>
It&#39;s not his massive prejudices and the genocide that I see as his primary <br/>
sin.  It&#39;s the hypocrisy, if the biographers are telling the truth that his <br/>
own best buddies were all seriously &quot;flawed&quot; biologically.  And unless he <br/>
dyed his hair, he wouldn&#39;t be admitted into Aryan Nation or any of todays <br/>
&quot;ooh let&#39;s be like Hitler&quot; boys&#39; clubs.<br/>
<br/>
If Hitler can gain eternal paradise by saying &quot;oooh, sorry God&quot; at the last <br/>
minute, then my neighbor Helen Carter, the sweetest woman I have ever met, is <br/>
burning in hell for that same doctrine.  Because she was Catholic and thought <br/>
that all Protestants should just be Catholic too because it was the right way <br/>
to worship Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
Hell is a really stupid idea.  I wouldn&#39;t worship anyone who would come up <br/>
with an eternal fiery pit.  But we could talk about where the ideas about <br/>
hell were borrowed (to go with that Mardi Gras history), and how many <br/>
cultures believe that and have similar names for it.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t even wish an eternal fiery pit on Hitler.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dear LLL,<br/>
<br/>
You have to be out of your mind. Hopefully unschooling for you isn&#39;t <br/>
tantamount to no-learning.<br/>
<br/>
This list is currently expending a hell of a lot of energy taking a guy to <br/>
task who has real problems with modern government. (Ned, funny how <br/>
California&#39;s R4 filers today received a note telling them that they can no <br/>
longer claim private school status and must stop homeschooling, unless it is <br/>
through the state. Keep up the good work.) <br/>
<br/>
People are talking about having their feelings hurt and such, because they <br/>
hold gentler views about the state and its education than he does, and he <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to want to let it drop. Fine. Let&#39;s move on. But you come along <br/>
with a statement that only an ignoramus could make, and not one peep from <br/>
anyone at this list. <br/>
<br/>
Your figures are asinine. Regardless, one murder in the name of Jesus is one <br/>
too many. But the interesting thing is that Christianity has a paradigm with <br/>
which people as yourself can use to see if its adherents are measuring up. <br/>
Read the Sermon on the Mount (you might call it &quot;doing some research.&quot; <br/>
Interesting concept, eh?), and if ever you see a Christian not living up to <br/>
it, you can be sure that it is the Christian -- not Christianity -- that is <br/>
at fault.<br/>
<br/>
So lets get to some of those undeniable secular figures. In THE LAST CENTURY <br/>
ALONE, atheists have killed: 54 million in the Soviet Union; 35 million in <br/>
China; 1.5 million in Cambodia.<br/>
<br/>
Der Fuhrer openly hated Christianity (and there is evidence that he <br/>
surrounded himself with occultists). The number he&#39;s responsible for? I&#39;ll go <br/>
with the conservative but common figure of 6,000,000 (no offense to Mr. and <br/>
Mrs. Altman). <br/>
<br/>
Spare us, next time, the truly insulting and ignorant claims.<br/>

Based on the quotes of mine that you highlighted, maybe you&#39;re troubled by my <br/>
use of the words &quot;asinine&quot; and &quot;ignoramus.&quot; Last I checked, they were common <br/>
adjectives found in most dictionaries. I&#39;ve yet to find -- anywhere <br/>
reputable, but god knows where some folks get their information -- the claim <br/>
that Christians have murdered over 50,000,000 people throughout their 2,000 <br/>
year history.<br/>

camps and death camps. That&#39;s why I asked further of Debbie re: her<br/>

12 M people? Are you counting all the russians, french, and others he<br/>
killed? All the uprooted lives?<br/>

You&#39;re right, my mistake. While writing the above I was concentrating on not <br/>
offending the Altmans and thus had in mind *JEWISH* victims. Rummel puts the <br/>
*total* victims  in the camps at around 20,000,000 if I remember correctly. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328900193">Bonnie, I agree with you. I&#39;m not arguing any differently!<br/>
I just consider death from a War to be slightly (not much) different than<br/>
killing people simply because of their religion/sexuality/ethnicity/physical<br/>
disability.<br/>
The deaths from War happen in ANY war.<br/>
Systematic extermination of an entire &quot;race&quot; (of which I am well aware that<br/>
Judaism is not a race) IS in my opinion different and that was simply my<br/>
first thought when I typed.<br/>

  Dear LLL,<br/>
<br/>
  You have to be out of your mind. Hopefully unschooling for you isn&#39;t <br/>
  tantamount to no-learning.<br/>
<br/>
  This list is currently expending a hell of a lot of energy taking a guy to <br/>
  task who has real problems with modern government. (Ned, funny how <br/>
  California&#39;s R4 filers today received a note telling them that they can no <br/>
  longer claim private school status and must stop homeschooling, unless it is <br/>
  through the state. Keep up the good work.) <br/>
<br/>
  People are talking about having their feelings hurt and such, because they <br/>
  hold gentler views about the state and its education than he does, and he <br/>
  doesn&#39;t seem to want to let it drop. Fine. Let&#39;s move on. But you come along <br/>
  with a statement that only an ignoramus could make, and not one peep from <br/>
  anyone at this list. <br/>
<br/>
  Your figures are asinine. Regardless, one murder in the name of Jesus is one <br/>
  too many. But the interesting thing is that Christianity has a paradigm with <br/>
  which people as yourself can use to see if its adherents are measuring up. <br/>
  Read the Sermon on the Mount (you might call it &quot;doing some research.&quot; <br/>
  Interesting concept, eh?), and if ever you see a Christian not living up to <br/>
  it, you can be sure that it is the Christian -- not Christianity -- that is <br/>
  at fault.<br/>
<br/>
  So lets get to some of those undeniable secular figures. In THE LAST CENTURY <br/>
  ALONE, atheists have killed: 54 million in the Soviet Union; 35 million in <br/>
  China; 1.5 million in Cambodia.<br/>
<br/>
  Der Fuhrer openly hated Christianity (and there is evidence that he <br/>
  surrounded himself with occultists). The number he&#39;s responsible for? I&#39;ll go <br/>
  with the conservative but common figure of 6,000,000 (no offense to Mr. and <br/>
  Mrs. Altman). <br/>
<br/>
  Spare us, next time, the truly insulting and ignorant claims.<br/>
<br/>

  No. He might have used the word &quot;fools&quot; or &quot;whitewashed tombs.&quot; What&#39;s your <br/>
