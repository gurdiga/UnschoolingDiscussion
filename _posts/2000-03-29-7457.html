<div id="ygrps-yiv-652754989">Hi-<br/>
Thanks for this compliment.  It&#39;s funny how people see things differently.  I <br/>
often long for the day when I can lose myself in something.  I think that&#39;s <br/>
one of the biggest hardships of having a big family for me...I have to do <br/>
everything in little bits and pieces because there&#39;s ALWAYS something more <br/>
pressing that comes up.  <br/>
&lt;&lt; and it may be a gift of yours that is a blessing bc you <br/>
 are constantly tracking so many people. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Take care-<br/>
Carol from WI</div>
