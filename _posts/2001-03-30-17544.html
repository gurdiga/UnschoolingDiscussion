<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The basic beliefs of Catholicism, Legalistic Christianity, and Liberal <br/>
Christianity, are not the same.  Catholicism and Legalistic <br/>
Christianity believe that Jesus was divine, that he was physically <br/>
resurrected, that he was an atonement for our sins.  Liberal <br/>
Christianity does not believe Jesus was divine, not that he was <br/>
physically resurrected, and believes that, rather than Jesus being <br/>
an atonement, he came to show us a pattern of how to live, and <br/>
that living that life is what counts.  Liberal Christianity is also <br/>
basically unitarian, in that they believe everyone will go to heaven, <br/>
because we are all God&#39;s children and he loves us.  <br/>
<br/>
I USED to be one of the fundamentalist kind, but have recently, as <br/>
a result of a lot of study, become one of the liberal kind.  It just <br/>
makes so much more sense, and is a much less judgmental way <br/>
to live.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, everyone is entitled to be whichever they want.  It&#39;s just <br/>
that people get confused....fundamentalists don&#39;t believe either <br/>
Catholics or liberal Christians are actually Christians because of <br/>
the rigid doctrine of salvation they hold...and their basic beliefs <br/>
about God and Jesus.  <br/>
<br/>
However, Jesus never talked about or espoused most of the beliefs <br/>
of the fundamentalist church.....Paul came up with most of those.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769916466">I wasn&#39;t going to get into this, but...<br/>
<br/>
There are many different types of protestants which often hold very <br/>
different beliefs, while most Catholics have very similar beliefs and adher <br/>
to the teaching of one Catholic Church. Many protestants (but NOT all) feel <br/>
that catholics are not &quot;real&quot; Christians because of many of the teachings of <br/>
the Church. It might also be said that many Catholics do not believe that <br/>
protestants are Christians (maybe that&#39;s not right, maybe it&#39;s that they <br/>
don&#39;t think that they will go to heaven, I&#39;m not sure which terminology to <br/>
use) because they do not belong to the &quot;true&quot; religion. (As evidenced just <br/>
recently when a friend of mine married an Italian Catholic and could not be <br/>
married in his parent&#39;s church because she is not catholic.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess the reason that I stuck my nose in is that much like I sometimes <br/>
feel the need to defend un-schooling, I sometimes feel the need to defend <br/>
Christianity (in this case, protestant Christianity). It often gets a bad <br/>
rap, usually because the fringe groups or the fundamentalists have the <br/>
loudest voices. I am a protestant christian (if you hadn&#39;t already guessed <br/>

that Catholicism interprets the Bible, but the basic beliefs are all there <br/>
and they&#39;re what I feel makes someone a Christian.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for the long post, I just always feel the need to remind people <br/>
that not all Christians feel the way that the vocal ones do (I often think <br/>
those ones are in the minority). Please don&#39;t lump as all together!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283004663">There is a segment of Christian society that has determined that only some<br/>
religions get to be under the umbrella of &quot;Christian.&quot;  That was all<br/>
explained, I think on this list about a year or so ago (but it could have<br/>
been on HEM) by a fundy (he called himself a fundy, so don&#39;t anyone get<br/>
their bloomers in a bunch, besides which, he is a &quot;good&quot; fundy &lt;g&gt;) who was<br/>
a list member.  At any rate, Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox,<br/>
JWs, SDA, CS, Mormons and a whole list of others aren&#39;t considered<br/>
Christians and each of the various ones are left out for a variety of<br/>
reasons.  If I can find the old post, I&#39;ll copy and paste it.  It was really<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the &quot;born again&quot; Christians who feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up that way (born again, Southern Baptist, baptized at the age of nine <br/>
(maybe ten; I&#39;d have to check back) from my own request, after examination to <br/>
make sure I knew what I was talking about.  Holly&#39;s that same age now and she <br/>
asks about religion almost every single day), in a Catholic town in northern <br/>
New Mexico.  Most of my friends were Catholic.  So I really wondered, and <br/>
asked and read.<br/>
<br/>
Catholicism is considered by some protestants to be idol-worshiping and <br/>
putting a man (the Pope) in the place of God.   <br/>
<br/>
About this and anything else I write here, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s right or <br/>
smart--I&#39;m just saying that&#39;s what the claims involve.<br/>
<br/>
Because Catholics consider themselves to be Catholic from infant baptism <br/>
(before they know what they&#39;re doing) and a confirmation which is just <br/>
something your mom or your parochial school TELLS you to do, then you have n<br/>
ot yourself accepted Jesus as your personal savior.  You do not have a <br/>
one-on-one personal relationship with God.  You&#39;re using a priest for prayer <br/>
and confession (praying pre-written words--another BIG no-no--at someone <br/>
else&#39;s direction, rather than really communicating with God), and doing what <br/>
a priest says instead of asking God directly.<br/>
<br/>
And Catholics pray to &quot;idols&quot; (saints, and they show respect to the statues <br/>
of saints).<br/>
<br/>
Mormons, that&#39;s just plain old prejudice.  Mormons accept the Godhood of <br/>
Jesus, and they&#39;re baptized at their own request when they understand and <br/>
want it (not before the age of 8, my formerly-Mormon friend Wendy says).   <br/>
But there are Mormons who don&#39;t WANT to be associated m Catholicism.  <br/>
<br/>
Mormonism is 150 years old.  Babies, in the history of Christianity, and the <br/>
protestants in the U.S. were already DEEP into their prejudices before any <br/>
Utah activity, before any Illinois activity, before any wherever-Joseph-Smith <br/>
was (New York state? Pennsylvania?) activity.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  researching to try and understand what exactly is the difference<br/>
between the different Protestant religions.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation would be to go on google.com and search by different <br/>
denominations by name, finding sites that talk about their beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Some differences are based on what they believe about baptism.  Some on <br/>
&quot;church year&quot; (whether to base some of their worship calendar on traditional <br/>
seasons like lent and advent and such, or to disregard anything that&#39;s not in <br/>
the Bible, in the epistles of the early Christians).  Some care about their <br/>
old church (whichever protestant sect THEY sprang out of) having been too <br/>
lenient about sin. Some came independently away from Catholicism during the <br/>
Protestant Reformation days, but did so in a different country--so the <br/>
Lutherans and Episcopalians and Anglicans are not so much different (or <br/>
weren&#39;t at one time).  The Baptists and Methodists are similar in some of <br/>
ways.  Church of Christ is in that range.  Pentecostal Holiness and some of <br/>
the other more charismatic and &quot;holy roller&quot; churches are another step away <br/>
from &quot;high church.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are some interesting obscure little denominations.  The Church of the <br/>
New Jerusalem, off from Lutherans by Emmanuel Swedenborg is fascinating.  <br/>
<br/>
You might look on google (or somewhere) for &quot;comparative religion&quot; too, or <br/>
&quot;Protestant denominations.&quot;<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Jesus did not believe in organized religion, 
BTW.&nbsp; Many believe, including myself, that he was a vegetarian.&nbsp; If he 
can see what people do in the name of religion and of Jesus, he&#39;d be sick.&nbsp; 
The Bible has been edited and re-interpretted so many times by the churches in 
order to keep certain people, including women, oppressed.&nbsp; IMO, true 
Christians would take Jesus&#39; life as an example to live by and ignore the 
politics of religion.&nbsp; - Collette</font></div>

they match you (your stated beliefs) against a bunch of different <br/>

I would recommend some sites but none of the ones I know of are impartial.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-633729887">Oh, another good book to get is called &quot;Jesus of India.&quot;  It <br/>
historical fiction, but it is based upon a factual book called &quot;Jesus <br/>
Went To India&quot; which cites historical evidence that Jesus traveled <br/>
outside the Holy Land.  Both books are valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed the Jesus of India book because it brought to life for me <br/>
the human-ness of Jesus, and that his philosophy of life came not <br/>
only directly from God, but that he was taught the things of God <br/>
from many different spiritual people, some with differing faiths.  But <br/>
He took the best from the beliefs of each person or group he <br/>
learned from, and brought them back to share with us.  <br/>
<br/>
This is threatening to many people who are &quot;fundamentalist&quot; <br/>
Christians, who believe they are &quot;separate&quot; from the world and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t dream that any of the teachings of Jesus were associated <br/>
in any way with a non-Christian religion.  But when you read the <br/>
book, it ties it all together for you in a way that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the historical accuracy of the book is backed up by recent <br/>
discoveries in the Dead Sea Scrolls and in ancient manuscripts of <br/>
India.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Here&#39;s an interesting site with a religion quiz. After you take the quiz, <br/>
 they match you (your stated beliefs) against a bunch of different <br/>
 religions/branches and rank them for you. There are great links for more <br/>
 information about the various religions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977422999">well, for my two cents, If you are following Jesus and<br/>
his example and his teachings, then you are a<br/>
christian. I think the word &quot;christian&quot; is used to<br/>
engulf alot of different things, cuz some people<br/>
assume they are a christian cuz there is only<br/>
&quot;christian&quot; (those who worship god and are &quot;good&quot;<br/>
people) and &quot;non-christian&quot; (everyone else who either<br/>
has &quot;different&quot; beliefs or is undecided or worships<br/>
satan)...and they definitely know they don&#39;t want to<br/>
be included in the &quot;bad&quot; group, so they say &quot;yeah, I&#39;m<br/>
a christian.&quot;But going to church doesn&#39;t make you a<br/>
christian, no matter what KIND of church it is. That&#39;s<br/>
just my humble opinion and I think that we all have to<br/>
answer to God on and induvidual and very personal<br/>
basis when it comes down to it, so as long as you are<br/>
attempting to live your life in a way that will please<br/>
him and as long as you are really doing what you<br/>
BElIEVE ..and that applies to pagan, agnostic,<br/>
catholic, buddhist, taoist, etc, etc, etc...cuz that<br/>
is your BELIEF system, and as long as you really<br/>
believe it in your heart and not for a superficial<br/>
reason and you really know what you believe and try to<br/>
keep growing and learning and not judge others (cuz<br/>
that&#39;s not our place, as humans, in my opinion) than<br/>
it&#39;s on you. So what if someone else doesn&#39;t agree,<br/>
then that&#39;s on them. Between them and God. ...(or<br/>
whatever you would like to put there). That&#39;s all, I<br/>
must stop myself compulsive rambling. <br/>
<br/>
AND I would also like to say that this list has proven<br/>
so very open-minded and kind and civil with the<br/>
discussion of things like this, lately. I love it. I<br/>
just adore this list and all we can gain from it. <br/>
Thanks everyone for sharing, and doing so in a nice<br/>
loving way. <br/>

&gt; I was not a Christian<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; was praying that I would be saved so that I could<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I am a Catholic.  I always considered myself<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160541774"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;However, Jesus never talked about or espoused most of the beliefs<br/>
&gt;of the fundamentalist church.....Paul came up with most of those.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Judie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What?!! That&#39;s completely untrue. Which particular beliefs are you talking <br/>
about?<br/>
<br/>
As for Jesus&#39;s divinty here&#39;s some things He said:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The woman said, &#39;I know that Messiah&#39; (called Christ) &#39;is coming. When he <br/>
comes, he will explain everything to us.&#39; Then Jesus declared, &#39;I who speak <br/>
to you am he.&#39;&quot; John 4:25-26<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews <br/>
persecuted him. Jesus said to them, &#39;My father is always hard at work on <br/>
this day, and I, too, am working.&#39;&quot; For this reason the Jews tried all the <br/>
harder to kill him; for not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was <br/>
even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.&quot; John <br/>
5:16-18<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something Nathanael said:<br/>
&quot;Then Nathanael declared,&#39;Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of <br/>
Israel.&#39;&quot; John 1:49<br/>
<br/>
I found other verses that prove it(if you believe that the Bible is a <br/>
reliable source).<br/>

&lt;&lt; Then there are the 3Rs (Religious Radical Right) who are bound and <br/>
determined to change everyone and think everyone is going to h*ll if they <br/>
don&#39;t think the same.  These same folks believe the U.S. and then the rest of <br/>
the world should become a theocracy (government based on Biblical teachings <br/>
and rules).  They are heavy into lots of stuff from the Old Testament and <br/>
some believe that stoning should be reinstated as a form of punishment.  They <br/>
also believe that folks that do not belong to the &quot;right/correct&quot; religion <br/>
should have no say in how the government is run.<br/>
