&lt;&lt; Hi,<br/>
 I think the feminist message is that of choice. If a woman chooses to be a <br/>
wife and mother - fine - as long as it&#39;s her choice, a choice she makes not a <br/>
choice that is forced upon her.<br/>
 <br/>
 Many feminists are wives & mothers. <br/>

as it now is (or is becoming). Now, we have choice, and a lot of people are <br/>
realizing that was the point all along.  <br/>
<br/>
But for awhile, staying home and raising children was seen as betraying the <br/>
movement,  and the women who worked so hard to create a safe place for us in <br/>
the workplace.  <br/>
