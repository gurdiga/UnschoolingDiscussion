<br/>
Well, I&#39;d love a CA unschooling conference (and I don&#39;t think the HSC one is <br/>
nearly unschooly enough!).  I also know this is not the time in my life for me <br/>
to plan a conference, but what about a camp out?  Maybe mid-state, San Luis <br/>
Obispo area?  We could still do &quot;funshops&quot;  and camp and see each other.<br/>
<br/>
I might be able to plan that with a bit of help.<br/>

get on it west ones..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The HSC campouts are really unschooly - at the beach campouts we <br/>
usually do what they call &quot;Free University&quot; - which is &quot;funshops&quot; put <br/>
on by kids or adults and on absolutely ANYTHING. There have been <br/>
workshops on candlemaking, kite making, intentional communities, vegan <br/>
cooking, fruit cobbler making, grammar, sandcastle building, surfing, <br/>
tai chi and yoga, swing dance, and lots more. Plus they have Magic, the <br/>
Gathering tournaments, chess tournaments, spelling bees, potlucks every <br/>
night. And kayaking. At the desert campouts I don&#39;t recall doing so <br/>
many workshops, but there are guided hikes - always something cool <br/>
offered.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, these campouts fill up - campgrounds always have <br/>
limited space and the HSC campouts are extremely popular - and more <br/>
campouts would be very very welcome. There was a new one added this <br/>
year in San Clemente and it filled up, too. Some of us would camp every <br/>
other week with our unschooling friends, given the chance!!!<br/>

Would you mind giving some more information on how these are organized (within the group and with the campground) and advertised?  Do you stay in tents? RV&#39;s? cabins?  How are the potlucks done?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in No. Colo. and we have a sweet, little, new unschooling group going, and I would like to reach people farther away for fun filled campouts! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015422200">One or two people &quot;take charge. They make sure the site is reserved far <br/>
enough in advance. We try to get a group site because it is more fun to <br/>
all be together on a group site than all in individual sites, but we <br/>
have such an overflow that we have to do a lottery for who gets into <br/>
the group site and everybody else gets their own individual sites in <br/>
the same general area. The organizers order wood (we can&#39;t collect <br/>
wood, maybe you can). The organizers bring a big white board for people <br/>
to write what they plan to offer for workshops - so I might put, for <br/>
example, &quot;Pam Sorooshian - Candlemaking - 3 pm on Wednesday at the fire <br/>
pit.&quot; Every morning there is a circle - announcements, problems (the <br/>
teens who dyed their hair purple in the bathroom, see the organizers <br/>
for supplies to clean it up with &lt;G&gt;). The potluck isn&#39;t organized <br/>
except that they announce the starting time and somebody brings <br/>
clothespins to clip onto all the dishes that are vegetarian, so people <br/>
will know.<br/>
<br/>
People use tents - but a few have RV&#39;s - depends on the campground/site <br/>
regulations.<br/>
<br/>
Our group has everyone sign a release of liability form for all the <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
For the people in the group site - they pay X dollars per person for <br/>
the whole week - we generally don&#39;t have people paying by the day <br/>
because it gets too complicated to keep track. The money pays for the <br/>
site and for the wood and we ask for a little extra from those who are <br/>
going to kayak, because we pay the guy who brings the kayaks.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s about it. The organizers sometimes will make <br/>
arrangements for something special - but usually that is left to the <br/>
attendees - a docent-led hike or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - at the group site everybody kind of puts their cooking setup in a <br/>
big circle - tables end to end, with stoves, etc. It is friendly that <br/>
way - since when you&#39;re camping you can spend a fair amount of time <br/>
hovering around your cooking area.  And somebody sets up one big <br/>
dishwashing area and different people sign up to be in charge of that <br/>
for each meal - that means they get it ready before the meal, keep the <br/>
hot water coming while people are washing their dishes, and clean it <br/>
all up when people are done.<br/>
<br/>
You never know what is going to go on at a campout - all depends on who <br/>
shows up. Some have lots of teenagers and some have mostly little kids. <br/>
So at some campouts everybody stays up half the night singing around <br/>
the campfire or telling scary stories while at other campouts everybody <br/>
is off sleeping in their tents very early.<br/>
<br/>
There is often a talent show one night.<br/>
