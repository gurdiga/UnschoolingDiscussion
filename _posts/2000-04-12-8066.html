<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290816495">Hi all,<br/>
   I was just wondering, Did anyone else watch Oprah yesterday? If so were <br/>
you as disappointed as I was? I love Oprah, but I really didn&#39;t need to hear <br/>
some &quot;expert&quot; tell me that most parents aren&quot;t &quot;qualified&quot; to teach their <br/>
own children! Or to see a Homeschooling mom talk about giving her kids the <br/>
Iowa basics test to make them ready for the &quot;real world&quot;. Maybe I&#39;m not <br/>
being fair, I only saw the second half of the show, but to me it did not put <br/>
homeschooling in a very positive light. And unschooling wasn&#39;t even <br/>
mentioned. Do you mean to tell me they were not contacted by ANY <br/>
unschoolers? This is one of those things that started to make me doubt <br/>
myself, then it just made me angry!<br/>
    Thanks for letting me vent! Any way I&#39;d like to hear if anyone else had <br/>
any thoughts on the show.<br/>
                                  Trisha<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656917292">I have read a book about Oprah and school was where she shined and was able<br/>
to feel some sense of self worth.  Perhaps she just can&#39;t see any other way<br/>
except how it worked for her.  School wasn&#39;t a safe haven for everybody, but<br/>
a place where you were forced to go where you felt your worst, not best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303705977">That was a grocery store special, don&#39;t know the basis.  I don&#39;t believe too<br/>
much of what appears in Star and the National Enquirer.<br/>
<br/>
However, she did have one child who was a special needs kid due to abuse<br/>
before she got her.  Not sure the adoption was ever finalized on that child.<br/>
I think she may have been a foster child, not an adoptee.<br/>

&gt; &gt; ***Okay, so I don&#39;t actually watch Oprah...I remember reading <br/>
about this<br/>
&gt; (in<br/>
&gt; &gt; HEM? on-line?) that when she did a show on homeschooling she was <br/>
so stuck<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the &quot;what about friends?&quot; mindset that she couldn&#39;t open up her <br/>
eyes and<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; that these kids in front of her were happy.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Valerie in Tacoma<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; REALLY?  Oprah doesn&#39;t get homeschooling?  I haven&#39;t turned the <br/>
tv on<br/>
&gt; &gt; in three years. I wasn&#39;t aware of this... oh yeah.. building up my<br/>

&gt; &gt; you need to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get on Oprah. That woman just doesn&#39;t get homeschooling, much <br/>
less<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294345890">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking. We had a wonderful time. I was a bit sorry that my <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling comments didn&#39;t make it into the show but then <br/>
again I really didn&#39;t expect them to.<br/>
<br/>
First off, Tara and I had a great flight into Chicago. I was sitting right <br/>
next to an American Airline pilot and when he heard Tara being a bit <br/>
nervous, he guaranteed her he could fly the plane if need be. This was her <br/>
first time flying. He was real nice and put her mind at ease.<br/>
<br/>
We arrived in Chicago at around 2:40 their time. A greeter from the show was <br/>
already there to meet us. By the time we got outside, our limo was waiting. <br/>
Of course it was a major shock when we walked outside. Tara and I <br/>
instinctively screamed with the cold!<br/>
<br/>
As we were driving to the city, I saw little flecks flying by and asked if <br/>
it was snowing. Tara has never seen snow. Well it was rather wet and hail <br/>
like but still exciting for Tara. We get to the Omni Hotel, check in and get <br/>
our food vouchers and go to our room to get ready for our cold trek outside. <br/>
Well by the time we got outside to do some shopping and look around, it was <br/>
snowing. And I mean snowing! The heavens opened up with big fluffy <br/>
snowflakes just like a movie. Tara was so happy. It was like it snowed just <br/>
for her. The more we walked, the harder it snowed. Everything was decorated <br/>
for Christmas and there were horse drawn buggies along the streets and <br/>
lights and it was just gorgeous!!! We had such fun and we were covered in <br/>
snow. We were freezing but happy.<br/>
<br/>
Went back to the hotel and changed and went and had dinner there. Went back <br/>
to ur room and relaxed the rest of the evening. The limo was picking us up <br/>
at 7:30 the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
The drive to the studio was about 15-20 minutes. We shared the limo with <br/>
another couple that was going to be on the show. Very nice people and we had <br/>
fun. Everyone at the studio was real nice. Of course I had to leave my <br/>
camera at the door and also cell phone. Very strict there they were.<br/>
<br/>
Ray, the producer of our segment met us and showed Tara and I the studio <br/>
before anyone was in it. He was so nice to us. We chatted with the other <br/>
guests and had our hair and make up done. Believe me when I say they <br/>
certainly weren&#39;t Oprah�s makeup and hair people. I would have been better <br/>
off doing it myself. I swear they pulled two people in off the streets. <br/>
That�s why I look a little peeked in the studio and not on the film clip.<br/>
<br/>
Then we�re out in the studio and the guy that warms up the audience was <br/>
hysterical!! We enjoyed that part of the show. I was still fine and it never <br/>
really dawned on me what was going on until I actually saw Oprah walk out. <br/>
That�s the first time I actually realized what we were doing!!! But I wasn�t <br/>
nervous at all.<br/>
<br/>
We were both very happy with the way Ray put everything together from when <br/>
he was at the house. There were just a few things cut out from the original <br/>
show we did with Oprah. She had asked Tara a question that didn�t make it in <br/>
the final show and her two questions to me were incorporated into one <br/>
instead. Over all, we were very happy with the way things went and when we <br/>
actually saw the show on Tuesday, both of us were very pleased. I was like a <br/>
little kid yelling �There I am� and then �There I am again!!!� Ray sat me in <br/>
a good place, the back of my head got a lot of exposure!!!<br/>
<br/>
We went back to the hotel, changed and had lunch at the hotel and then went <br/>
on our shopping trek again. It was even colder on Monday afternoon than it <br/>
was Sunday night and Tara I didn�t make it far at all. We wanted to see the <br/>
Sears Tower and also the lake. Forget about it!!!! We were walking into <br/>
stores just to thaw out. It was very uncomfortable. We practically ran back <br/>
to the hotel and thawed out again for an hour until our limo came to pick us <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
At the airport we checked our bags and hung out as we had an hour to kill. <br/>
We loved the airport there and just browsed around some more and ate. On our <br/>
flight home, we flew with Venus and Serena Williams. Tara had no clue who <br/>
they were when she saw them. A very nice flight followed and it was all new <br/>
again for Tara as it was a night flight. The lights all look so nice. Joe <br/>
was there to meet us at the airport with all the kids. I was surprised as he <br/>
said he would just pick us up outside. The baby was just so happy to see us <br/>
as the other two were too.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now for the part no one probably really wants to hear. Ready?<br/>
<br/>
Miss Oprah is a bit of a snoot. And that�s putting it mildly and nicely. I <br/>
can�t honestly say we actually met her as she never came near us. No nice <br/>
words of thanks for coming on the show, no handshake, nothing. Absolutely <br/>
nothing aside from what you saw if you watched the show. When they break <br/>
away for a commercial, she sits up there on her little perch and talks to <br/>
only her people or herself. She makes herself laugh a lot and we heard the <br/>
same joke over three times while she was up there. When she does ask you <br/>
something on the show, she immediately looks away from you to the monitor <br/>
and solely concentrates on the teleprompter. It�s evident when you watch the <br/>
show but more so when you are there. She also made a remark about being so <br/>
rich she has people now. She had something in her eye and called her make up <br/>
guy from backstage, actually yelled for him clapping her hands and out he <br/>
came running to remove whatever it was that was bothering her. She talked <br/>
about how she use to have to remove things from her eyes herself before and <br/>
now she has �people� do it for her. It just didn�t sit right with Tara and <br/>
I. Everyone laughed of course but another remark about her staff made me <br/>
think she must be hell to work for unless you are high up in the scale. So <br/>
Miss Oprah is not big on our nice list anymore. When we left, we got a <br/>
public thank you from the stage on air but nothing else. No picture, no <br/>
handshake, no video tape of our show, just two Oprah coffee mugs.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily it was only a few hours out of our trip and we did really enjoy the <br/>
show and being there and the whole experience. We were just disappointed to <br/>
find Oprah not as friendly as we thought she would be.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;t my experience. And it was certainly that and a good one too. <br/>
Thanks for asking and I hope everyone has a Happy Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
Mary B<br/>

I thought both you and your daughter looked very well and did a great job!<br/>
Interesting about Oprah... guess it would be hard to get intimate with<br/>
everyone she meets on a day to day basis. What did someone say once? &quot;What<br/>
does it take to make a diva?&quot; &quot;$5,000 a week!&quot; ;)<br/>
<br/>
What amazes me about her is how clueless about children she can be. On the<br/>
After the Show on Oxygen, she was doing this anti-spanking thing. She &quot;gets&quot;<br/>
that, but then people were listing the alternatives they used that involved<br/>
shaming, blaming, and humiliation and she was nodding her head in agreement. I<br/>
guess for someone who grew up getting whipped with a switch for not carrying<br/>
the slops out to the outdoor privy fast enough, just not getting hit seems<br/>
like the ONLY step...<br/>

What is also interesting is that I was making comments in regard to the <br/>
whole spanking thing after the show. Miss Oprah just didn&#39;t acknowledge me <br/>
at all by even looking my way although she most definitely heard me. I guess <br/>
that&#39;s a whole other show. And believe me I did talk to one of the producers <br/>
about the whole children/unschooling topic too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572241315">Did you really expect different?  I lost interest in her years ago;<br/>
I remember watching a couple of shows where she dissed the<br/>
guests for various reasons; one was a ex-wife who claimed not <br/>
to feel something or other and she turned to the audience and <br/>
said, *We don&#39;t beleive you.* siding, without proof, with the new<br/>
wife.  In another case a mil gave her dil a gift of a coloring book<br/>
and crayons for Xmas: that was not the only thing she gave the <br/>
woman, it was just one of the things.  Oprah got very down on<br/>
her, started making fun of the gift, even after the mil explained <br/>
that it was a kind of traditional gift for all the women in the family, <br/>
that all the women found it a good destresser, and she did it not <br/>
to make fun of her new dil, but to welcome her into the family.  <br/>
<br/>
She wants to express her opinion and have her opinion validated.<br/>
Everyone else need not apply.<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
