 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Cameron and some friends dragged me to see the movie, Lake Placid. I had <br/>
no idea what it was about; I was just the taxi-driver. Betty White just <br/>
about FLOORED me---the Mouth on that woman. YIKES!  Talk about unprepared! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh I loved that movie and one reason was Betty White. She was too much in <br/>
that. A far cry from the Golden Girls. You know what other movie I found <br/>
really funny BECAUSE of the swearing? My Fellow Americans with James Garner <br/>
and Jack Lemon. The way they talked to each other cracked me up.<br/>
