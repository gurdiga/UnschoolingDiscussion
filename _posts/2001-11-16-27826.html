<div id="ygrps-yiv-460123656">Then according to her all of my friends (bar myself<br/>
and one other with onlys - and then they&#39;re in our<br/>
beds more often than not) are abusers! I don&#39;t know<br/>
anyone who has separate rooms for their kids - oh, I<br/>
just thought of one (she has a huge house though)! :)<br/>

&gt;make my kids <br/>
&gt;share <br/>
&gt;a room. In her words, &quot;If you can&#39;t afford a room<br/>
&gt;for each kid, then <br/>
&gt;you <br/>
&gt;can&#39;t afford the kids!&quot; Sheesh.<br/>
