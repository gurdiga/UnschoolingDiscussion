<div id="ygrps-yiv-279898434">Mothering magazine also has a good article in their July/August edition.  I<br/>
have only skimmed it so far but it looks good.<br/>
<br/>
I spent a lot of hours, over a period of years researching vaccines.  I<br/>
tried to consider any possible merits of each, one at a time, the last one<br/>
was tetanus.  I went to a web page for doctors which listed reports of<br/>
reactions to the shot, it was scary.  I combined this with the reports of<br/>
tetanus cases (rare) and decided against having it given.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good idea to just start looking for information on the internet, pro<br/>
and con, and look at each vaccine individually.  Believe it or not, some of<br/>
my best reasons for NOT having a vaccine have been from pro-shot sites like<br/>
the CDC.  Do the math, risk vs risk, and make the best choice you can.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could give you a list of sites but I just had to reformat my hard<br/>
drive and lost all my bookmarks, saving the file didn&#39;t work.  I&#39;ve lost my<br/>
best research information this way, more times than I care to recall.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532719453">First of all, unless there is something else going on, no one can force you<br/>
to immunize.  Certainly not your insurance company.<br/>
<br/>
Second, even if you go to the government sites to look at what their<br/>
recommendations are for immunizations, you&#39;ll see that what they give is a<br/>
suggested &quot;range&quot; of when the shots are most effective.  Like you should get<br/>
the first one of something between six and nine months and the second one 6<br/>
months later.  That kind of thing.  There are no hard and fast dates.  NONE!<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, that was the biggest deciding factor for me not to give some shots<br/>
to our second son.  We aren&#39;t doing the chicken pox one, we aren&#39;t doing<br/>
the, oh hell, what is it, the nasty resp. one, can&#39;t remember the name at 7<br/>
AM.  And I&#39;m not rushing in to get him some of the others.  He missed his<br/>
fifteen month check and I&#39;m sort of skipping the 18 month, but he&#39;s late for<br/>
his 2 year at this point.<br/>
<br/>
With son #1, he was in daycare and then school, so we would get these little<br/>
forms in his mail box.  ANd we just went with it.  But no one is in school<br/>
now so we just let it slide some if everyone is doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
For some of these immunizations, they don&#39;t even know yet how effective long<br/>
term they are going to be.  (Chicken pox being the prime example.)  Why<br/>
bother?<br/>
