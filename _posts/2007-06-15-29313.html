<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542781573">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
My 8 yo has wanted to dye her hair for the past few months.  We found this<br/>
henna herbal color that¹s kind of a purpleish red.  Well.  I needed to get<br/>
past the usual barriers of believing she is too young to know what she wants<br/>
and after getting over that one (because she really does know what she<br/>
wants... and she wants to try coloring her hair this specific color.  I<br/>
stooped to trying to get her to color her hair with straight henna but she<br/>
was very clear that she wanted the purplish color.  Yea, I think she know<br/>
what she wants) the more elusive one of what will they think  came hovering<br/>
in.  But then I got over that one too.... until I told my mother what we<br/>
were going to do and she practically turned white.  She said that if it was<br/>
OK with me then she would go ahead and do the coloring (she¹s the one who<br/>
knows about these things).  But I knew she hated the idea.  And so that got<br/>
me wondering and thinking of how, after all these years, I¹m still looking<br/>
for her approval.  I was never allowed to dye my hair, let alone think of<br/>
it.  Make-up was only for in the house where nobody could see me and she let<br/>
me know if my outfit wasn¹t fashionable enough.  I can hardly make a<br/>
decision on my own today because of all the schooling at school AND home.<br/>
<br/>
Well I won¹t do that to my girls.  As far as I¹m concerned, if Athena is old<br/>
enough to know she wants to color her hair, then she is old enough to do it.<br/>
I mean, really... what¹s all the fuss about?<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to vent a little and write down in words this breakthrough I¹ve<br/>
had... a breakthrough that¹s bringing me closer to letting go of old,<br/>
useless baggage.<br/>

<br/>
I know what you mean! My daughter likes to dye her hair as well - and her<br/>
favorite is the same deep purple shade you&#39;re talking about. Is it a thing<br/>
with 7/8 year olds?<br/>
<br/>
My mom frowns on it and my step-father *really* dislikes it and I&#39;ve had to<br/>
endured comments from them as well as perfect strangers, but have managed to<br/>
ignore them for the most part. I actually like helping DD dye her hair.<br/>
Maybe because I wasn&#39;t allowed to do (unless I did it anyways and then faced<br/>
the consequences) and it makes me happy to provide her with it. I love that<br/>
she feels free to express herself and isn&#39;t worried about being a<br/>
cookie-cutter. There is also a small part of me that feels good about not<br/>
caving into my parents&#39; wishes. I, too, find myself still seeking their<br/>
approval in certain ways, so I like when I can maintain my own perspective<br/>
on things. Subtle rebellion, lol.<br/>
<br/>
For about a year my son didn&#39;t want me to cut his hair so it grew very long.<br/>
Again, conventional minded people had snippy comments like, &quot;He looks like a<br/>
girl - do you want him to look like girl?&quot; and &quot;Looks like it&#39;s time for a<br/>
hair cut, don&#39;t you think?&quot; as if I was just being absent minded and it had<br/>
never dawned on me that his hair was growing past his shoulders. One family<br/>
member even brought religious doctrine into it even though we don&#39;t share<br/>
the same beliefs. But, like with the hair dye, I tried to let the comments<br/>
just roll off my back and instead I took joy in standing firm and gave<br/>
myself a little pat on the back for not letting them sway my decision to<br/>
support my child.<br/>
<br/>
Dying hair isn&#39;t that hard to do, especially if you&#39;d rather not involve<br/>
your mom. The directions are pretty straight forward - just be sure to use<br/>
old towels and wear the gloves. One tip is to apply cold cream or vaseline<br/>
around her hairline (but avoid getting it on her hair) and on her forehead,<br/>
neck, and ears before you put the dye on her hair. That will make it much<br/>
easier to wipe the dye off her skin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027916775">Hair is a renewable resource.<br/>
I heard a mom say that once, long before I had kids, and it really rings<br/>
true in my heart.<br/>
Please have someone do her hair who is not going to infuse the process with<br/>
angst and judgment -- it&#39;s imperative this be a happy, joyful, FUN time for<br/>
her!! Empower your daughter to tell ickiness-spreaders &quot;my hair, MY choice.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to do *this* to your hair if you don&#39;t like it.&quot; and you can<br/>
say &quot;Your concern is appreciated, your approval is unnecessary&quot;<br/>
Henna is SO easy to do: boil up some water and some black tea bags (no metal<br/>
anywhere in the process, it will react with the henna and change the<br/>
color!!), add enough liquid to make a nice smooth paste (if you over add,<br/>
let it stand extra long, it will thicken), let it set for a couple of hours<br/>
(in glass bowl) until the lumps are gone, smoosh it all over her head<br/>
(assuming you want all over color), cover with a plastic bag and get out<br/>
into the sun!!<br/>
Your neighborhood Sally&#39;s Hair Supply (I&#39;m SO glad we finally got one in our<br/>
home town, previously I would frequent them on our road trips!) has a GREAT<br/>
semi permanent selection, some that bleach & color in one step.<br/>
You&#39;ll find, if approached joyfully, this is a great bonding experience with<br/>
your daughter that could very well help you heal from your own past filled<br/>
with judgment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376582679">Thanks everyone for the input so far!  This has been so much fun!  I let my<br/>
mom do it knowing that once I did give the OK she would go along with it and<br/>
get over it.  It was a fun.  If I thought my mom would approach it with<br/>
angst I wouldn¹t have let her do it.  Well... Athena looks GREAT!!!  She<br/>
LOVES her hair and feels wonderful.  What more could I ask for?  I got all<br/>
sorts of spontaneous hugs and I love you¹s and some fabulous hair-flipping<br/>
in the mirror under the light (to catch the purple-y shine).  Tomorrow I¹m<br/>
going to do Penelope¹s hair (she¹s 8 too).  She wants a light red henna<br/>
color.  <br/>
<br/>
I got over my feelings of needing my mom¹s OK (on this one) and I noticed<br/>
that after it was all done, Athena¹s new hair really isn¹t a big deal at<br/>
all.  It seemed like my mother felt the same way.  She too was all smiles<br/>
and said what a wonderful color it is.  She is my ally in most cases about<br/>
unschooling.  This was just a barrier for her as well... more for her than<br/>
me... It is nice to have an ally here.  We live in the Greek boonies where<br/>
culture and tradition are very tight.  It¹s nice to have someone stick up<br/>
for me even though she doesn¹t fully understand what we¹re doing.<br/>
<br/>
....hee hee hee..... living with kids is so much fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415048703">&quot;I do have some limits on it (no bullets, guns, etc) and nothing TOO <br/>
extreme, but in general I try to let him show his own style.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You LET him?  Why do you have no guns or bullets, etc., limits?  <br/>
That&#39;s the same kind of rules they have in schools.<br/>
<br/>
Why put limits like that on him?  Why not let him decide for himself <br/>
what is way over the top and what isn&#39;t.  I know it&#39;s uncomfortable <br/>
to let go of that discomfort within yourself, but it&#39;s very worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of seeing his style of dress as something to fear, just look <br/>
at it like an experiment of sorts.  Some kids just like to mess with <br/>
shock value.  Why put so much into it at all, just look and <br/>
appreciate it for what it is.  It&#39;s a syle, help him go with it.  To <br/>
the extreme if he wants to.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun and you can learn a lot about your kids through encouraging <br/>
their syles.  Don&#39;t worry about what other people think, they can get <br/>
over it.  The inside is what counts.  Encouraging your child&#39;s <br/>
passion, even if it&#39;s all black and piercings, wearing gun logos, and <br/>
dyed hair, will let him feel heard and respected.  That&#39;s the kind of <br/>
stuff that makes the inside even better.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a whole other world when kids dress like that out of a <br/>
rebellious nature to irritate their parents or make a point &quot;against&quot; <br/>
something.  I find that with my unschooled kids, it just isn&#39;t the <br/>
same as that.  They do it for other reasons.  Without really <br/>
exploring with your child, you&#39;ll miss out on all of that.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295637023">-=-He has some definite issues with aggressive behavior (I&#39;m<br/>
not going into the details about all of it) and I am making a  <br/>
decision that<br/>
*I FEEL* is best for my child at this time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s fine, but this list isn&#39;t so much for discussing what one mom  <br/>
feels about one child as it is about the larger principles behind  <br/>
helping children learn freely and make choices.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  We can all only do what is best for our own families. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That sounds good, and I&#39;m sure most people would absolutely agree  <br/>
with you.<br/>
One thing I have chosen to do is to spend some of my time every day  <br/>
keeping this list maintained as an unschooling discussion area.  So  <br/>
it&#39;s not a &quot;whatever in the whole world anyone feels or wants to do&quot;  <br/>
list so much as it&#39;s a &quot;let&#39;s discuss how kids learn and what can  <br/>
hamper or help good relationships in unschooling families.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-  We agree on several types - but others not so<br/>
much.  He is really into some speed metal bands right now which I  <br/>
just don&#39;t<br/>
like.  Does it mean that we never listen to it?  Nope, it doesn&#39;t.   <br/>
We all<br/>
take turns in the car picking music.  Some days I tolerate speed  <br/>
metal, some<br/>
days he tolerates disco music.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Couldn&#39;t you listen to the kind you both like when you&#39;re together?   <br/>
That seems very workable, and you could listen to the less-shared  <br/>
types when you&#39;re off alone.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well this conversation was just read over my shoulder by my 13 yo <br/>
dd.  Boy did she have plenty to say on the subject.  First she wanted <br/>
to know exactly what was wrong with him that he couldn&#39;t handle a <br/>
picture of a gun.  I scrolled back to the part where you said you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t go into it.<br/>
<br/>
So, she was thinking about all the possibilities of a person not <br/>
being able to handle pictures of guns.  Then she still came to the <br/>
same conclusion.  That it didn&#39;t make sense to her at all that a <br/>
picture of a gun could somehow inspire one to become aggressive.  <br/>
Then she wondered how the mom would even know that if she never <br/>
allowed it.<br/>
<br/>
She added that parents should let their kids dress the way they want <br/>
to dress and then go from there.  If some clothing item makes someone <br/>
more aggressive, then you could work on that, if that even would <br/>
happen in the first place. (I&#39;m paraphrasing here cuz she was just <br/>
talking so fast with so many thoughts)<br/>
<br/>
Then her friend called and was really upset because her parents had <br/>
just bought her clothes that she didn&#39;t want or like and are <br/>
insisting that she wear them.  This is in response to wanting to wear <br/>
all black and chains and stuff.  They don&#39;t want their child dressing <br/>
like that, so they are trying to force her to wear other things <br/>
because they think it looks better.  <br/>
<br/>
So where does a parent draw the line?  Should they?  My children can <br/>
wear what they want, just like I can, just like their dad can.  I <br/>
don&#39;t tell my husband what he can and can&#39;t wear and only LET him <br/>
wear clothing that I think is appropriate.  That would be insanely <br/>
controlling.  The point of unschooling is treating kids with respect, <br/>
as an equal in their humanity.  Perhaps more innocent or less aware, <br/>
when they are younger, but equal just the same.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do that to my 13 yo dd who likes to wear all black.  She can <br/>
cut, mark, sew and otherwise do as she pleases with her clothing.  <br/>
She dresses appropriately for the weather and the occasion.  She <br/>
isn&#39;t sneaking out and changing at her friend&#39;s house to wear the <br/>
forbidden items, like some of her friends do.  She puts on her black <br/>
eyeliner at home or in the car, where some of her friends do it at <br/>
school and take it off before they get home so they don&#39;t get in <br/>
trouble.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday she let her friend cut her hair very short!  It looks <br/>
cool.  I offered to take her to the salon to get it done but she <br/>
didn&#39;t want to wait that long.  I offered to take her afterwards to <br/>
get it evened out, and she declined.  Her hair looks cool, she likes <br/>
it, she&#39;s happy, I&#39;m happy, her friend was excited to do it.  It was <br/>
fun all around.<br/>
<br/>
She loves the shock value image.  It&#39;s fun, yet people are surprised <br/>
at how cool and nice she is, if they don&#39;t know her and judge her by <br/>
her looks.  It&#39;s amazing how much people stereotype others.  We talk <br/>
about it.  We have had many conversations about stereotyping and <br/>
judging others by how they look.  We go people watching downtown and <br/>
point out all the cool &quot;looking&quot; people.  My dd used to say &quot;cool <br/>
person&quot; and point to where she was looking.  Then we&#39;d laugh about <br/>
how they look cool, but could actually be a big jerk in real life.<br/>
<br/>
I love how my daughter dresses.  I find nothing innappropriate about <br/>
it.  She listens to her music, sitting at the desk right next to me.  <br/>
I get to listen to her music too.  I&#39;ve heard countless bands and <br/>
countless lyrics and we&#39;ve discussed all of the qualities of the <br/>
music.  I try not to say wether or not I like any of it when I first <br/>
hear something new, because I want to appreciate it through her eyes <br/>
and be open minded about it.  She does likewise to things that I <br/>
bring to her.  It goes both ways.  If I said I didn&#39;t like something <br/>
and made a thing about not wanting to listen to it, she would likely <br/>
do the same to me.  <br/>
<br/>
When we are in the car, I always listen to her music ALWAYS.  I can <br/>
listen to my music when she&#39;s not with me.  For now, I love her being <br/>
with me and if that means listening to loud emo screamo music in the <br/>
car, then so be it.  When we go to the mall she&#39;s not ashamed of her <br/>
mother, she even sometimes holds my hand or links arms with me.<br/>
<br/>
That is the kind of relationship that comes from LETTING my daughter <br/>
be who she wants to be without my judgement getting in the way of her <br/>
decision making.  She trusts me and I trust her.  She asks for my <br/>
opinion because she finds it of value.  It&#39;s because I never <br/>
said &quot;no&quot; to all those little things like wearing certain clothing, <br/>
or saying wether or not she could look or be a certain way just <br/>
because I said so or thought so for her own good.</div>
