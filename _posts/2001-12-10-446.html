<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740335450">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But what about money? I&#39;ve been thinking of<br/>
starting an allowance for him, but not sure how to go<br/>
about it. I think it might help him to know/have <br/>
some control over when  we can and can&#39;t get stuff.<br/>
Instead of it just being sort of a luck of the draw to<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Brenda&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about working out a allowance<br/>
system with my dd. She&#39;s 7 and has a pretty good grasp<br/>
of the we can or can&#39;t afford it scene, but I would<br/>
like for her to be able to save up for the bigger<br/>
ticket items that I can&#39;t buy her spontaneously. Can<br/>
anyone tell me how they handle allowances (like how<br/>
often and how much)? I need some food for thought.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We give our nearly 11 year old son a relatively large allowance. He <br/>
gets $15 a week, but from the early days of his getting an allowance <br/>
we showed him how to budget it into different categories. The way it <br/>
works right now is he puts $6 a week into his spending bank, $5 a <br/>
week goes into savings, $2.50 a week goes into a piggy bank that&#39;s <br/>
set aside for gifts for others, and $1.50 goes to charity (his choice <br/>
of charities). He&#39;s happy with the system so far and frequently will <br/>
put his spending money into one of the other categories. Recently <br/>
he&#39;s been trying to make sure he&#39;ll have enough for everyone&#39;s <br/>
Christmas presents so he&#39;s shifted a good bit to that fund. Often <br/>
he&#39;s added to the charity bank. He has his own Quicken file on the <br/>
computer with four accounts showing how much he has and where he <br/>
spends his money. He seems to enjoy using Quicken. He sure keeps up <br/>
with it better than I do with our accounts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ours is one dollar per month for each year old a child is. So the 10 yo gets <br/>
$10 per month and the 14 yo gets $14 per month. HOWEVER - we made a drastic <br/>
increase in the amount when my oldest daughter started getting interested in <br/>
clothes and long-distance phone calls and buying lots of gifts for friends, <br/>
etc. When I noticed that we were butting heads, over and over, whenever we <br/>
were out - that I was having to CONSTANTLY decide, on the spur of the moment, <br/>
whether to buy something for her, or not, we upped her monthly allowance to <br/>
$50 a month and she is supposed to buy all her own clothes, accessories, <br/>
gifts, and pay phone bills. We don&#39;t stick to it very well - I buy her <br/>
clothes when I feel like it. But this way it is a sort of gift from us and <br/>
she never asks, she just assumes she is paying and is very grateful when I <br/>
step in and say, &quot;I&#39;ll pay for that for you.&quot; Now she is 17 and has a paying <br/>
job and we still give her that money and still buy stuff for her when we feel <br/>
like it. She wants to spend her earned money on going to all THREE sessions <br/>
of Not-Back-to-School Camp in the fall. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533171348">My daughter (16) wanted to earn spending money for when she went to England.  I had not been giving an allowance prior, but since it would be difficult to find a paying job for a few months to then take 3 months off, I offered her to do some work around the house in exchange for an allowance.  We agreed on a list of things she would do every week for a set amount of money ($15/week) which she did happily.  Then she would ask to do additional things for extra money.  Some of those were mowing the lawn, raking leaves, washing the RV, washing and waxing my car, washing windows inside and out, etc.  Each of those had a $ amount attached as one time jobs.  She also got work for a woman she met at the barn where she rides and did some similar things at her house, earning another $75.<br/>
 <br/>
My son (almost 13) is now asking what he can do to earn some money, too.  Since his sister is still in England there is plenty of things he can do.<br/>
 <br/>
We provide everything they need and want, for the most part, but they like to have money of their own to spend also.  Sometimes there are things I just can&#39;t wrap my mind around spending real money on (like add-ons for Maple story where you buy a new hat for $3 real dollars and it vanishes after 90 days or something!) so this way they can do that with their own money.<br/>
 <br/>
My daughter and I sometimes &#39;fight&#39; over who is going to buy her clothes, LOL.  I say I&#39;m your dad and I want to buy you some clothes!  And she says but I want to use my own money! And we have a good laugh about it.<br/>
