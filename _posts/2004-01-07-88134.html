<div id="ygrps-yiv-687483552">My husband and I recently found &quot;There&quot; (http://www.there.com). It&#39;s a virtual world...rather fun. Just thought I&#39;d mention it in case anyone might be interested in it. You can join for a free 15-day trial-period. There&#39;s not as much to it yet as the Star Wars worlds but it is fun!<br/>
