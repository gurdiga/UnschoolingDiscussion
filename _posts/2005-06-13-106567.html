<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481378666">Just remembered this one. On our trip to Montana, my normally very verbose <br/>
and stridently opinionated, anti-homeschooling mother was quiet about the <br/>
subject, ALMOST completely. Except for dinner the first night, when one of <br/>
my kids mentioned the summer program for school age kids, where they can go <br/>
down to the school yard and get a free lunch. And my mil said &quot;well, if you <br/>
went to school, you could have free school lunch every day!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOL ooooh, I&#39;m changing MY mind. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
blessings, Heidi</div>

<br/>
OH yeah.<br/>
Holly loves free lunch.  Starting tomorrow she can go again.  (Woohoo!!  I&#39;ll <br/>
see her in three hours!)<br/>
<br/>
Last summer a little girl her age who was determined to prove homeschooling <br/>
wrong and evil finally said &quot;How do you meet anyone if you don&#39;t go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
WHAT a bad move.  What a STUPID question.  Holly said, &quot;Well, I met you at <br/>
the park.&quot;  The little girl did not understand a word Holly was saying.  Looked <br/>
at her not just blankly, but blankly with the slow-mo stun-out.   Holly turned <br/>
to a mom sitting on the blanket with them (a mom who DID get it) and stuck <br/>
out her hand and said, &quot;Hi.  I&#39;m Holly,&quot; and shook the woman&#39;s hand.  Still the <br/>
schoolkid did NOT get the point.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s oldest brother is a master of doofy comments.  The kids enjoy sharing <br/>
notes after he leaves.  One, though, several years back was to Marty:<br/>
&quot;How do you like your teacher?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty:  I don&#39;t have a teacher.<br/>
Gerry:  Sure you do.<br/>
Marty just looked at him, didn&#39;t bother to respond.<br/>
Gerry:  Your mom&#39;s your teacher.&quot;<br/>
Marty:  No she isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Gerry was stuck.<br/>
They can stick him every time. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718325522">This is not a dumb response to homeschooling, but when I heard it I thought  <br/>
it was strange.<br/>
 <br/>
I told my mom we were going to homeschool and her respose was, &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>
practical.&quot; For my mom that was probably the greatest compliment.<br/>
 <br/>
At the time, of course, I thought many, many things about our plans, but it  <br/>
certainly didn&#39;t seem PRACTICAL!  But I appreciated my mom&#39;s support.   I <br/>
really miss her.<br/>
