Try to forget about workbooks or turning things into &quot;educational&quot; moments.<br/>
Forget about the evaluation and live your lives free of any school thoughts. <br/>
It sounds strange, but it&#39;s such a burden off of your life when you do it.<br/>
Step into true unschooling.<br/>
That means observing, getting curious about and exploring the world. NOT <br/>
attaching it to a workbook, or turning an obervation into a project.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not schooling. That means we let school go out of our lives <br/>
completely, unless the child were really wanting it.<br/>
Your children already know the best way to learn. They&#39;re doing it. Now just <br/>
enter their world and forget about requirements and such.<br/>
Take photos, save ticket stubs, artwork and passes. Write a list of books you <br/>
read together, a list of interesting supplies you have around.<br/>
That should all be enough to pass the evaluation for this year.<br/>
