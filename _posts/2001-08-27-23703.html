&lt;&lt; I can really relate to this.... I spent so much time at the headmaster&#39;s <br/>
 office for &quot;talking too much&quot;  I spent so much time in comprehensive school <br/>
 (high school to Americans) writing lines (&quot;I will not disrupt the class by <br/>
 talking so much)&quot;, so many hours sitting outside the classroom for &quot;talking <br/>
 too much&quot;, many report cards that said &quot;Dawn talks too much and dispruts <br/>
 other people: ( &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Made me remember all the sentence writing after school and the eraser <br/>
clapping for being a disruptive child. Also the principle coming onto the bus <br/>
to have a talk w/ me and putting myself and my best friend in front seats. I <br/>
did get thrown off the bus a few times eventually. I lived in detention too. <br/>
Mostly for being late,&quot;how are you ever going to hold a job when you grow <br/>
up?&quot; I&#39;d love to let them know that I was rarely if ever late for work in my <br/>
various occupations. Jerks!<br/>
