<div id="ygrps-yiv-909282">Anyone got any good links for adult deschooling?  I&#39;m chatting with <br/>
a friend who&#39;s feeling frustrated by her inability to learn (I know, <br/>
don&#39;t get me started...) the thing is, she doesn&#39;t learn well from <br/>
books and didn&#39;t like school when she was there, but is still stuck <br/>
in the mentality, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Sooner the better!!  TIA!<br/>
