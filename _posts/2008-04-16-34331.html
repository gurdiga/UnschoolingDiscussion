<div id="ygrps-yiv-811848294">I have so enjoyed going back and reading the posts here.  I am new <br/>
to the idea of homeschooling.  My daughter (Lexi) is almost 2 1/2 <br/>
and shortly after she was born I realized that I felt strongly about <br/>
homeschooling her ... but lacked the confidence that it was <br/>
something I could do.  Since that time I have been involved a great <br/>
deal with a wonderful API group with quite a few homeschoolers and <br/>
learned a lot. The group I previously belonged to (before moving to <br/>
Florida) was made up more of Waldorf homeschoolers.  So, much of my <br/>
limited knowledge of homeschooling has come from that theory.  I am <br/>
now in a group that seems more drawn to Unschooling and am taking <br/>
this opportunity to learn more.  I had read about Unschooling <br/>
briefly in the past and was very intrigued, thinking ... well, <br/>
that&#39;s how we&#39;ve lived our life so far with Lexi and it seems so <br/>
very natural!  Why does it feel so natural to live our life this way <br/>
and then so intimidating and pressured that I should change to <br/>
another approach when she turns 6 or 7 because all of a sudden I am <br/>
supposed to start teaching her something, reporting outcomes, <br/>
testing, evaluating, channelling, structuring ...???????  I guess <br/>
where I am struggling is ... I LOVE what I&#39;ve learned so far about <br/>
Unschooling!!! ... it is how Lexi has lived her life since she was <br/>
born ... nursing whenever she feels like it, playing when she wants <br/>
to, sleeping when she wants to ... even though daddy and I &quot;play <br/>
dead&quot; when she is doing cartwheels in the bed at 11PM so she will <br/>
finally get bored and hopefully go to sleep ;-) ... eating what she <br/>
wants when she wants (our house is filled with good food so I never <br/>
worry about what she will choose) ... etc.   The struggle is ... <br/>
what do I do when she &quot;needs&quot; to start learning to read, write, <br/>
learn mathematics, etc.?  I realize that my years of schooling (20+) <br/>
to get to the point of receiving my doctoral degree have led me to <br/>
be an OVERLY organized person, somewhat ANAL ... which I am doing a <br/>
great job of reversing ;-), a PERFECTIONIST ... which my daughter is <br/>
doing a great job assisting me in relaxing with ;-), SCHEDULE driven <br/>
person ... which has totally been thrown by the wayside since <br/>
becoming a full-time mommy ... boy, I&#39;m loving this ...  But, when <br/>
it comes to education, that is all I know.  How does the transition <br/>
come about when the child starts learning in a more academic <br/>
manner ... asks to start learning to read?  ... does she just pick <br/>

herself?  ... she already seems to be trying this out.  Does she <br/>

am not frustrating those of you who are more advanced and wise in <br/>
this area.  I guess I am just trying to get a feel for where to <br/>
start (actually where to NOT start if I am following her lead ;-)).  <br/>
I have do doubt that she is learning every day and I have no <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007648542">It just keeps going like it&#39;s been going!  Keep following her interests, living your lives!  You will be amazed at what she learns (and you).  It will not follow a &quot;school&quot; schedule so don&#39;t feel the need to.  I can recommend some wonderfully supportive books and sites that have opened my eyes and allowed me to realize we don&#39;t have to create special environments for children to learn--they can&#39;t HELP but learn.  In fact, schools (and schooling-at-home with designed curriuculms) tend to make learning seem like a chore and turn off that natural desire to learn.  You&#39;ll probably hear from others on this list, too.  BTW, I&#39;m a former Waldorf homeschooling mom, myself!  <br/>

<br/>
Your daughter is on the early end of two years old.  There should be  <br/>
no struggle whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
You have plenty of time to figure out that she will learn to read,  <br/>
write and learn math without &quot;needing&quot; to.   She will do it naturally  <br/>
and joyfully if you don&#39;t screw it up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
it comes to education, that is all I know. How does the transition<br/>
come about when the child starts learning in a more academic<br/>
manner ... asks to start learning to read? ... -=-<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t ask to start learning to read.  She&#39;ll learn to read.  If  <br/>
you don&#39;t screw it up.<br/>
<br/>
Could you please break your posts up into paragraphs?  It was one  <br/>
long, dense stream of consciousness.  Many readers skip by such  <br/>
blocks of text.<br/>

<br/>
The best thing you can do is to stop thinking in school terms.  Try  <br/>
to see the world and think about learning without such terms as  <br/>
&quot;preschool&quot; and &quot;school-age&quot; and &quot;level.&quot;  It probably seems  <br/>
unimportant, but it&#39;s part of turning away from school so you can see  <br/>
the world a whole new way.<br/>

Look for the fun moments instead of the potential future struggles.   <br/>
You&#39;re taking a whole different path.  The struggles will be far away.<br/>

<br/>
As for the environment, I&#39;m going to help you visualize it--close your eyes, then open them <br/>
and look around--there it is!  You will continue to be delighted by her interests and want to <br/>
obtain things/information/etc. to support them.  You&#39;ll see something that you think might <br/>
be interesting, so you&#39;ll get it or show it to her.  You will play games and count money for a <br/>
new toy.  You might visit your friends&#39; house where they got a new puppy or have a new litter <br/>
of kittens.  You&#39;ll be pursuing an interest that she asks about and you will have a great <br/>
conversation that starts there and ends who-knows-where.  You will go interesting places <br/>
and meet interesting people.  You will mention a current event.  She&#39;ll ask you about this or <br/>
that.  It all goes from there.  <br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she&#39;s in school, she&#39;ll need to stick to their schedule of when  <br/>
she reads and writes and does math. If she&#39;s never in school, then  <br/>
she can use those as she needs them for her own personally meaningful  <br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
As she&#39;s learning to speak, is she studying it? Does she sit down and  <br/>
do lessons? Or does she just use it? Try things out to see how well  <br/>
they work? Play with it?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s how we learn everything. At least until school interferes.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How does the transition<br/>
&gt; come about when the child starts learning in a more academic<br/>
&gt; manner ... asks to start learning to read?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t. There&#39;s absolutely no difference between how she&#39;s  <br/>
learning English and how she&#39;ll learn to read, write and manipulate  <br/>
numbers. She will come up with new strategies, she&#39;ll have more  <br/>
sophisticated needs, but the process of trying things out to see how  <br/>
they work and playing around with things will still be the foundation.<br/>
<br/>
No difference. That can&#39;t be emphasized enough!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ... does she just pick<br/>
&gt; up a wonderful book that I&#39;ve been reading to her and read it<br/>
&gt; herself? ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. Each child is different. They absorb signs (STOP,  <br/>
McDonalds ...), they hear stories, they play with words, they write  <br/>
(for some kids before they read), they ask questions, they watch as  <br/>
you read .... It&#39;s a huge conglomeration of experiences, none of  <br/>
which by itself is important, but the whole chaotic mess and -- even  <br/>
more important! -- the process of them making sense of the chaos, is  <br/>
what allows them to figure out how it works.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does she<br/>
&gt; place 2 stuffed animals next to 2 more stuffed animals and count out<br/>
&gt; that there are 4 of them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably she&#39;ll do some of that but, unlike school, the answer to a  <br/>
problem in isolation isn&#39;t the gaol. The purpose of real math is  <br/>
comparing things and finding patterns. The fact that 2+2=4 isn&#39;t that  <br/>
meaningful or interesting. That there are 4 cats and 3 dogs and 7  <br/>
dinosaurs is more interesting. (Or something similar to different kids.)<br/>
<br/>
Real math is for helping us see the world in a new way. My daughter  <br/>
enjoyed sorting her dinosaurs to see how many meat eaters there were  <br/>
compared to plant eaters, how many Cretaceous versus Jurassic. She&#39;d  <br/>
asked &quot;How long until ...&quot; and I&#39;d puzzle it out for her. She&#39;d use  <br/>
the various meters and scores on video games to help her progress.<br/>
<br/>
Real math is used to manipulate the world to get the information from  <br/>
it that we want.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am just wondering how I go about creating the best<br/>
&gt; environment to facilitate this beyond toddlerhood ... preschool ...<br/>
&gt; into more of a school-age level?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The world existed before school. The world is the natural place where  <br/>
we learn. School is an artificial subset of the parts that someone  <br/>
else thinks are important for a child to use to absorb what someone  <br/>
else wants them to.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t natural for us to absorb someone else&#39;s understanding of how  <br/>
the world works. What&#39;s natural is pulling our own order out of  <br/>
chaos, forming a theory, testing out the theory, refining the theory  <br/>
and sometimes throwing out the theory and starting from scratch again.<br/>
<br/>
If we didn&#39;t enjoy pulling order from chaos, we wouldn&#39;t enjoy doing  <br/>
various types of puzzles. We&#39;d just look at the answer.<br/>
<br/>
We *want* to figure things out ourselves. (As part of figuring things  <br/>
out, we might also ask questions, read someone else&#39;s ideas. We don&#39;t  <br/>
do it in a vacuum.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes.  My oldest daughter&#39;s best friend from a long time ago did<br/>
exactly that at the age of 4.  Her mom was really surprised and when she<br/>
ended up in school she was put in all the advanced classes because she<br/>
knew how to read.  Learning how to read is just one of many skills that<br/>
a kid learns in their lifetime.  It&#39;s an important one for sure, but not<br/>
the be all end all of skills.  My daughter didn&#39;t start reading until<br/>
about 11 or 12, and at 14 reads book after book, can&#39;t get enough of it.<br/>
Her friend that learned how to read at 4, rarely picks up a book for<br/>
pleasure and her skill set has leveled out to match all the other kids<br/>
in school.  She&#39;s smart for sure, but it has more to do with her<br/>
personality rather than anything she was taught.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my girls at various times have asked me to teach them how to<br/>
read.  We&#39;ve used various things over the years, but ultimately what was<br/>
best was video and computer games, combined with lots of books on<br/>
tape/cd, and me reading to them.  My youngest is 6 and doesn&#39;t read yet,<br/>
but can read some words.<br/>
<br/>
You will know when they can read, because they will be reading.  Picking<br/>
up books to look at when they are young is part of that process of<br/>
learning about those mysterious symbols.<br/>
<br/>
Does she<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; place 2 stuffed animals next to 2 more stuffed animals and count out<br/>
&gt; that there are 4 of them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again it depends on the child.  My oldest daughter learned math<br/>
computive skills with money.  Anything beyond money, she&#39;s not<br/>
interested in, it&#39;s not really her thing, her mind works in other<br/>
directions.  She can figure out those hand manipulative type puzzles at<br/>
science museums really well, even the spacial ones, she can visualize<br/>
something in her head and create things like clothing and acessories,<br/>
but if you ask her what 25 plus 37 is, she will have no idea or interest<br/>
in figuring that out, unless of course it is money.  My younger daughter<br/>
does multiplication in her head.  She&#39;s always got numbers floating<br/>
around in there.  She can count to ten in 3 languages and does simple<br/>
addition in those languages.  I don&#39;t know why she does it, she must<br/>
find it fun and fascinating.  She adds and subtracts and multiplies and<br/>
divides in her head, she has a unique concept of abstracts like<br/>
infinity.  I didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; her those things, and she didn&#39;t count<br/>
stuffed animals either.  It started with fingers and toes and other<br/>
people&#39;s fingers and toes.  She&#39;s just recently figured out how to count<br/>
to one hundred, while my older daughter figured that out much earlier<br/>
than 6, because of the money thing.<br/>
<br/>
I am just wondering how I go about creating the best<br/>
