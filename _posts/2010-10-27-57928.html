<div id="ygrps-yiv-263231403">My kids have been interested in Stop Motion Movies for awhile and I have tried to help them but we havnt had alot of luck with the software we bought or downloaded and overall have all been disappointed because either the software wasnt really very good or the whole task was a little to cumbersome for the kids.

The free software that you download from their site is perfect for our needs and they can use a webcam to take the pictures which are directly pasted into the software and it is very easy to make cool little movies within minutes of opening the book.  I showed it to my 7 year old tonight.. i played with it for a little while first to make sure it worked.  And he was so excited.  Anyway I just thought I would throw it out there if anyone is looking for something a little different with many many possibilities.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551585392">If you have a MAC/ Apple store close to you they do educator field trips, I took my homeschool group there last week we did stop motion, the kids get a t-shirt and certificate along with their finished projects. Just sign up on the Apple site they call you and set it up. Cheryl<br/>

Thank you for this! We, too, have been disappointed with different types of software - I almost bought the Klutz book the other day, but hesitated. It&#39;s good to hear a review:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253887052">Hi<br/>
Thanks for this. I went to the klutz website to look at it and found a page about their tricky videos book. There was a link from that page to videos they had made using the &quot;tricks&quot; in the book. my 2 children (age 7 and 4) spent about an hour watching them and lapping it up.<br/>
Then we looked at some of the animations from the animation book.<br/>
It inspired lots of fun and pondering how they might have achieved the effects.<br/>
We will definitely be buying both books and downloading the software.<br/>
For anyone in the UK, amazon seems to have a great price on the books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424334104">We&#39;ve made stop motion animation on the cheap by taking a series of photos (on our digital camera) of the figures&#39; movements and then, after downloading the images to the computer, we run them through iPhoto&#39;s slideshow on the option for the fastest paced image change. If you don&#39;t use a Mac, or iPhoto, I imagine any photo program you run will work, so long as it has a slideshow option.<br/>
<br/>
It is a bit choppy, but really not too bad.  My daughter is more than happy with the results (for now), and with a tripod, she can do a lot of it herself.<br/>
<br/>
The Klutz program looks really cool though!<br/>
