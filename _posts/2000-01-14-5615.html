a site about how things are made. Eg. What is an eraser made of??? <br/>

Hi,<br/>
I don&#39;t have a particular site in mind, but you can find lots of answers at <br/>
www.askjeeves.com.  <br/>
<br/>
On a similar topic, one of the things my boys enjoy most is to make a trip to <br/>
Goodwill or Salvation Army and spend a little money to get a box full of old <br/>
appliances.  We then have a blast taking them apart, rebuilding them, and <br/>
combining parts to make new kinds of inventions.  It&#39;s cheap fun!<br/>
