&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Why not speak up for the child? A statement perhaps: &quot;She doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to share right now.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	Having been raised in an authoritarian household, I would have a hard<br/>
time saying something so &quot;bold.&quot; I&#39;ve come up with a way to address it,<br/>
though. I address the *child,* saying something like, &quot;It seems important<br/>
to you to keep the vegetables right now. I have a hard time sharing my<br/>
favorite things, too, sometimes. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll share when you&#39;re<br/>
ready.&quot;<br/>
	Sometimes, this causes the parent to empathize and change behavior. Even<br/>
if it doesn&#39;t, the child has received *some* validation of her feelings,<br/>
and a clue that they are &quot;normal.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
some of my strongest memories from my childhood were isolated events like this,<br/>
where someone i had very little or no knowledge of spoke with me.  it really left a<br/>
deep impression.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. It&#39;s about validating the feelings of the child.<br/>
You know, even the last phrase leaves sharing hovering there in the<br/>
air for &quot;when she is ready&quot;, ruining a bit the joy of her play - of<br/>
play in the *moment*.  The joy - the moment - is robbed because soon, <br/>
it will be all over and &#39;everyone is waiting&#39;.  Hurry up and get the <br/>
fun in. The problem with sharing has been set up and sets the child <br/>
up, no matter how you slice it, as having some sort of problem for <br/>
wanting to do what it is she is choosing and wanting to do.  The <br/>
underlying tone is that the child is wrong for doing this.  She is not. <br/>
Contrary to popular belief, according to my obersvation of certain <br/>
children, this respect for individuality does not set up nasty, greedy<br/>
hoarding little creatures. It is wise to leave the sharing thing alone, <br/>
validating feelings and backing off. It all comes together because<br/>
of love and life and the joy of living.  <br/>
<br/>
Do we say that we, too (adults), have trouble sharing?  And do we?<br/>
Well, *why*?! And is it really the same &quot;set up&quot; for us as it is for <br/>
them (children)?  Not at all. <br/>
<br/>
In closing some ideas from this and other posts:<br/>
There is no &quot;perfect&quot; mother - I think even striving to be one, <br/>
takes away from each unique *moment* - it is simply not the <br/>
goal to strive for in the best interests of a child or a mother. <br/>
Looking into the child&#39;s eyes (a person&#39;s place) and putting <br/>
oneself in their point of view, puts so much into focus. It&#39;s not <br/>
about being the &quot;best&quot;, it&#39;s about living and growing - learning <br/>
and giving. It&#39;s about children and respect.<br/>
