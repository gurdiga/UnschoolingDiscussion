What would you like to be doing?  How would you like your days to be <br/>

P.S.  As an example, today was baking day.  Literally.  We have been shopping <br/>
and mixing and baking all day.  My son has a &quot;belt party&quot; at Tae Kwon Do <br/>
(when they promote to the next belt) and we are bringing cookies.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, my son was standing in the sandbox doing time/distance type word <br/>
problems -- If a plane leaves NY travelling 60 miles per hour, etc.  This was <br/>
his idea.  Believe me.  I was pre-coffee and had to go get the calculator <br/>
just to keep up (and it was a good excuse to grab a 2nd cup of coffee).<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s us. <br/>
<br/>
Daughter is learning to read.  We read a lot.  And do workbooks.  And write a <br/>
lot.  And draw and paint.<br/>
<br/>
And they both take music.  Son is bored; daughter is happy but I am not -- <br/>
her group class has turned into more of a play time than I want to see -- but <br/>
we&#39;ll see how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
How can any of this possibly help you?  I think you have to start with where <br/>
you and yours are and plan or not as you are inclined.  <br/>
<br/>
But there is no secret battle plan or anything.<br/>
<br/>
You can check on-line or with your school board or with &quot;What Your X Grader <br/>
Should Know&quot; type books.  Maybe those would be a sanity check.  They have <br/>
been for me.  <br/>
<br/>
But they are just a jumping off point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess my PS ended up a little too long.<br/>

I would just hate to bore everyone with our little goings on.  And it is such <br/>
a personal thing -- deciding exactly how to live your life.  But you&#39;re right <br/>
-- input is good -- even if all it is does is eliminate, at least that&#39;s <br/>
something.  <br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day</h4>
<time> 1 Feb 2000, at  4:51pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587592919">Nancy, I don&#39;t think your PS was too long at all, and it really does help to<br/>
get an idea from others of what they do, so you can clarify from that what<br/>
you like to do for yourself.  Kind of like, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not sure I want to do<br/>
THAT, but HERE is an idea I like, I&#39;ll add it to my list of things I like to<br/>
do&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It always helps to have a starting point, and modify it according to what<br/>
suits your own family.  I don&#39;t think anyone here who is just starting out<br/>
would blindly adopt someone else&#39;s way of doing things, but would consider<br/>
the many ideas presented and choose what might work best for them.<br/>
<br/>
Its also helpful for problem solving.  Some of us run into walls, and its<br/>
nice to hear a few different perspectives and ideas from others.  It helps<br/>
us see problems from different angles and come up with solutions of our own.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your PS, I for one appreciated it very much.<br/>

<br/>
Nanci, I bet if you do this they will naturally demonstrate learning on the<br/>
scale that those social workers will be looking for are they giving you any<br/>
guidelines for how long they will allow for the adjustment period before you<br/>
have to prove to them that they are learning? I bet you are going to offer<br/>
them such a rich environemtn that the adjustment pd may not be so long<br/>
either. My cousin adopted a little boy from an orphanage in Russia at the<br/>
age of 4 and he absorbed their environment so quickly like a fish to water.<br/>
I hope you will let us in on what those first days are like if you have the<br/>
time to share or record it. They will be your baby records of these<br/>
children. We used a videotape prior to picking him up and of course<br/>
throughout the entire process when they first met etc. You can see a lot of<br/>
change using a video recorder too.<br/>
I am so thrilled for you. When will they be arriving?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts only here --<br/>
<br/>
Surely these children from the system come to you with some sort of <br/>
documentation.  If they have been in school previously or have been tested at <br/>
all, there is something to give you a jumping off point.  It may not be <br/>
particularly accurate and you probably have to satisfy all sorts of regs, but <br/>
this could be a time to say X is reading at 2nd grade level according to XX <br/>
and we will continue to assist him in improving his reading.  Or whatever <br/>
subjects the system will still be interested in.  What do they check on?  How <br/>
detailed?  Etc.  <br/>
<br/>
No, this isn&#39;t ideal unschooling, but it might be a starting point -- using <br/>
their existing documentation to project future educational needs and goals -- <br/>
maybe you have to be more exact than one might want to be in a better <br/>
unschooling world, but you are dealing with regs most of us don&#39;t have to get <br/>
through.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to determine what the system wants them to accomplish in the <br/>
next X months?  You may be able to do that in less time than school would so <br/>
you will have time up front to deschool.<br/>
<br/>
Is there some sort of pyschological component to the oversight by the system? <br/>
 Is there a psychol in the picture who you could enlist to suggest these kids <br/>
may need a certain amount of time off considering all they are going thru?<br/>
<br/>
Does this oversight end after a while?  Or decrease?  Perhaps true <br/>
unschooling can&#39;t happen just yet -- not under their watchful eyes -- but <br/>
will have to develop over time.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712791562">Nanci, do you think that perhaps you can explain this to the children?  That while you know they need time to get over whatever has led them to being adopted, you all will be montiroed at least for a while, so if they can hang on for that time, they can relax after?  I know they&#39;ll probably be a bit young to accept that, and it might seem a bit false and forced, but if in the end it means that you can live without thinking about what &#39;authorities&#39; are thinking, it may help.  It&#39;s only a suggestion, and I may not make any sense at all!<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck whatever goes on, and yes I&#39;d LOVE to hear about what&#39;s going on, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything off-topic on an unschooling list!!<br/>
