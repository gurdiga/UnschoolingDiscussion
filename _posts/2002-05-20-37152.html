<br/>
<br/>
Clues (verbal and nonverbal) that in the midst of panic attacks, parental <br/>
guilt and worry (par for the course my Mom has been warning me for years <br/>
about being a parent), and blind faith, that unschooling is the right <br/>
decision:<br/>
<br/>
the roar of the schoolbus going by in the morning, without my Megan on it, <br/>
while we are still snuggling warm in our beds, thankful the hectic morning <br/>
rush is gone for good<br/>
<br/>
Megan saying she has an earache, and not having to worry about sending her to <br/>
school, thinking it is an excuse for not going to a place she despises, or <br/>
worrying about an unsympathetic teacher ignoring her. Not worrying about her <br/>
attendance, despite the fact that earaches are common and painful for her, <br/>
among other chronic illnesses she has had, with little compassion from her <br/>
teachers. Teachers that won&#39;t let her go to the bathroom because this<br/>
distracted and impulsive child lost her 8 bathroom &quot;tickets&quot; for the nine <br/>
weeks. It&#39;s no wonder she has suffered from chronic constipation and <br/>
encropretic soiling. Teachers that wouldn&#39;t let her go call home, until she <br/>
was crying and begging, and they didn&#39;t bother to even check that she had a <br/>
fever, that didn&#39;t appear until after I sheepishly sent her to school, <br/>
because I had to draw a line that she can&#39;t just miss school for not feeling <br/>
her best, I<br/>
needed a fever or puke as valid reasons. I can distinctly remember at her <br/>
previous school district (she went to one k-3rd, then we moved and I though a <br/>
new district would help for 4th HAHA), I was calling her in sick but stated <br/>
she may be coming in late, since I didn&#39;t know if it was genuine or a school <br/>
avoidance tactic. The (insert TOSABLE expletive here) principal suggested I <br/>
hang up and threaten her to call the police for incorrigible behavior,<br/>
because truancy is illegal. This same (insert again) principal who told me <br/>
the school would do nothing for my ADHD-type daughter in the way of providing <br/>
individual or custom environment to help her learning style. He suggested we <br/>
medicate her, because by law that was all he could do. <br/>
<br/>
Finding old schoolpapers stuffed in the back of her desk drawer, so glad this <br/>
busywork is no longer a source of stress and conflict for our family. <br/>
Memories of the battle that ensued, when she would constantly &quot;lose&quot; her <br/>
assignment, &quot;forget&quot; to write assignments down, or flat out tell me she had <br/>
no homework when she did. Refusing to study for a test, telling the teacher <br/>
she didn&#39;t need to, the teacher calling me about it, then Megan getting a <br/>
perfect<br/>
score on it. The teacher who also called Megan to the front of the room, to <br/>
publicly embarrass her, by having her crying, calling her mother from the <br/>
desk phone in front of the entire class to try to tell me she was missing her <br/>
assignment again. She couldn&#39;t choke up the words, as I demanded to talk to <br/>
that teacher now and blast her for attempting such a ridiculous stunt, when <br/>
she could have let me know there was problem before this, and scheduled a<br/>
conference. The resulting conference that I demanded with all her teachers, <br/>
where I was put on the stand to defend our family habits, reassuring: no, <br/>
Megan does not have a TV in her room, yes, we do discipline her with love and <br/>
consistency, yes, we are her natural parents with no divorce or stepfamily or <br/>
live-in lovers, and no, I don&#39;t think bribing her with candy bars would be an <br/>
effective means of getting her to conform and perform. Finally<br/>
redirecting these ladies to stop the faultfinding and come up with a <br/>
solution, that I did alone, with no input, and no subsequent consistent <br/>
follow-up, to make sure she had the right assignments written down, in <br/>
PEN...........shall I continue? No I will spare you anymore laborious details <br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
Yes, these horrible, sometimes painful, memories are affirmations that she is <br/>
where she belongs, home with a family that loves her, supports her, knows her <br/>
and cares for her better than someone more &quot;qualified&quot; to baby-sit her, a <br/>
mother that has a hard time escaping the guilt of letting such a harmful <br/>
charade continue so long, but has faith in God&#39;s timing that everything that <br/>
has happened was for reason, and thanking God that I have such a<br/>
&quot;difficult&quot;, &quot;challenging&quot;, or &quot;spirited&quot; child, for if not, I might still <br/>
believe that school was just fine, if not necessary for a &quot;proper&quot; education, <br/>
socialization was just a hard, necessary lesson to endure, and that it&#39;s <br/>
normal and healthy to surrender my precious child over to this institution. <br/>
<br/>
And finally, the sound of that same school bus, at almost 4pm, even though <br/>
the school is five minutes away, hard to believe that is has gotten so late, <br/>
we lost track of time in the backyard, chasing bugs, watching for <br/>
hummingbirds, fishing and catching dozens of bluegills in the pond, and the <br/>
absolute pity I feel for the unsuspecting parents and kids getting off the <br/>
bus, who don&#39;t have time to come play, they have homework and are way <br/>
overscheduled<br/>
each evening, wishing they could know the joy we have found.......<br/>

because so many of the things you shared about your<br/>
daughter&#39;s experience in school remind me of my son&#39;s<br/>
experiences before we brought him home to school.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, sometimes feel guilt about not taking him home<br/>
sooner, but I know that every day that he&#39;s home with<br/>
us and not at school is an important gift, and that we<br/>
are on the right path for us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for sharing so beautifully your<br/>
experiences! They really touched my heart.<br/>

P.S. I joined two new groups in the past week and I<br/>
can&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve even introduced myself. If I<br/>
haven&#39;t, please someone let me know and I&#39;ll do so.<br/>
Thanks :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45936892">I&#39;m going to try not to make this too long, but please forgive me if it is.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a long preamble to what I need help with:  We took our 7-year-old <br/>
son, Liam, our only kid by the way, out of school last February.  He was in <br/>
&quot;first grade&quot; at a Montessori school.  Since the time he was born, we had <br/>
always planned not to put him in school at all, but he always craved being <br/>
with other kids, and friend of mine had told me about this particular <br/>
school and that the director/teacher had a very open mind and that there <br/>
was a strong environmental theme to the school.  A couple of his good <br/>
friends were going there, too, so when he was 4 years old, I set him there <br/>
two afternoons a week just to see if he liked it or not.  He really did <br/>
like it.  There was a lot for him to do, and there was a strong drama and <br/>
arts component which he really liked.  He also liked being able to play <br/>
with the other kids, which is his absolute favorite thing.  I let the <br/>
teacher know that I absolutely did not want anyone pushing academic stuff <br/>
on him unless he initiated it or asked.<br/>
<br/>
The next year I asked him if he wanted to stay and go into kindergarten.  I <br/>
would involve going there five full days, but he would be able to continue <br/>
with the same teacher, and we saw each other frequently and became friends, <br/>
and she continued to respect my wishes about following his lead.  He seemed <br/>
to be liking it there, but he was starting to show signs (which I ignored <br/>
to my shame now) that he was not liking it so much.  He didn&#39;t want to go <br/>
to school but when he got there he really liked it and at the end of the <br/>
day he did not to leave so fast.  I thought this was due to inertia, and I <br/>
did nothing to change it.  Occasionally, he would really resist going to <br/>
school, and then I would try to find out what was bugging him and then he <br/>
and his teacher and I would have a sit-down and work it out.  His teacher <br/>
would always let him know that she loved him very much and wanted him to be <br/>
happy there.  She would do everything she could to make him feel more <br/>
comfortable there by changing whatever it was that was bothering him.  For <br/>
example, when he didn&#39;t understand something, he felt uncomfortable about <br/>
asking about, so she let him know that he could come to her anytime he was <br/>
puzzled about something and they could go somewhere private and she&#39;d <br/>
explain things to him.<br/>
<br/>
She was WONDERFUL, but she was not his only teacher, and when he was in the <br/>
&quot;first&quot; grade (in K-1-2 class) there was a lot of pressure on him to do the <br/>
academic work.  He really started hating it.  All he really wanted to do <br/>
was play with his friends and play with playdough.  Playing with his <br/>
friends during work time was frowned upon and he&#39;d get in trouble for <br/>
that.  And, he got the hairy eyeball when he spent too much time playing <br/>
with playdough.  His teacher decided that she would regard him as a <br/>
kindergartener and keep him in a &quot;kindergarten curriculum.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had my epiphany that all this was way wrong for him this past February <br/>
and abruptly took him out of school.  He was ecstatic!  I told him that we <br/>
would be &quot;unschooling,&quot; and that I would follow his lead.  He understood <br/>
that if he wanted to know something or do something he could ask me.  I <br/>
also told him that I would offer things to do, but that he didn&#39;t need to <br/>
feel obligated to do it if it wasn&#39;t interesting to him.  We bought a TV <br/>
set with a VCR (the first we had ever had; we don&#39;t have TV reception or <br/>
cable though), and he can watch whatever tapes he wants.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here&#39;s what&#39;s got me now.  One of the things I have noticed about <br/>
Liam is that he seems to have a very fragile self image.  He is either an <br/>
expert at something (anything) the first time he attempts it or he&#39;s a <br/>
total failure and stinks at it.  He has a real hard time playing a friendly <br/>
game of anything because if he doesn&#39;t win, it absolutely crushes him.  I <br/>
know that lots of kids go through that, but it daunts me nevertheless.  I <br/>
know he&#39;ll generally grow out of it, but what troubles me now is that he <br/>
seems to be avoiding things he wants to do because he feels he&#39;s no good at <br/>
them.   Here&#39;s an example.  This morning he wanted to write some words.  He <br/>
asked me how to write &quot;opera is closed&quot; and then &quot;opera is on fire.&quot;  I <br/>
wrote them out for him to copy.  He got very upset because he wrote the &quot;c&quot; <br/>
too close to the &quot;s&quot; in the first phrase.  After that, he got very angry <br/>
with himself, and there was nothing that I could say to him to encourage <br/>
him to try again.  He told me that he wanted to learn how to read and write <br/>
but that he just couldn&#39;t.  He told me that a 7-year-old ought to be able <br/>
to do these things, and he seemed to feel that he was defective (my word, <br/>
not his) because of his inability to do things &quot;everyone else&quot; can.  Even <br/>
though I told him that there are some expert readers in the world who did <br/>
not start reading until they were 10 and 15 years old, he was not comforted.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, I don&#39;t know what to do.  Now, he has indicated to me that he <br/>
wants to be able to do these things (though not so much because HE wants it <br/>
as much as he feels defective for not being able to).  I confess that I <br/>
really don&#39;t know how to help him.  I know he is still decompressing from <br/>
his brief school experience.  His passion is Power Rangers and Star Wars <br/>
and that kind of thing.  He likes watching them on TV, he likes having <br/>
anything about Star Wars or Power Rangers read to him.  He likes making up <br/>
Power Rangers dramas for himself or he and his friends and playing these <br/>
out, either alone or with his friends.  I have the closed caption option on <br/>
the TV turned on and the words that are being said are also visible on the <br/>
screen; I figure that he&#39;ll start recognizing some words that way.  I was <br/>
able to remind him that he read the word &quot;off&quot; the other day, and that <br/>
seemed to help his psyche a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a bit at sea with this.  I&#39;d love to hear about similar experiences, <br/>
and I&#39;d love to get some advice about how I can help him see that he is an <br/>
able person but that he can&#39;t expect to be an expert right out of the gate.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much!!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kirby was as you describe Liam.  I think it&#39;s perfectionism, and a desire to <br/>
have the thrill of accomplishment and praise.  Kirby was very easily <br/>
frustrated.  He wasn&#39;t much fun to play boardgames with, because when it <br/>
looked like he might not win, he wasn&#39;t in the mood to play anymore.<br/>
<br/>
But now that he&#39;s fifteen, he&#39;s very well liked, sensitive to other kids&#39; <br/>
feelings, and good-humored about his own shortcomings.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The thing is, I don&#39;t know what to do.  Now, he has indicated to me that he <br/>

<br/>
I would tell him that both in school and out, reading and writing are made up <br/>
of lots of little parts and steps.  Making circles and parallel lines,  <br/>
recognizing rhyming sounds, lots of things which do NOT need to be done in a <br/>
school-looking way at all.  Tell him that in school the reason they push <br/>
early reading is so the kids can read beginner books, but that since you can <br/>
read to him he can skip beginner books, and hear REAL books, written for real <br/>
people, and not &quot;itchy, itchy chicken pox&quot; kinds of nothingness stories.<br/>
<br/>
Your learning to be comfortable helping him is as much little-parts as his <br/>
learning to read or write will be, so work on each day and it will get easier!<br/>

I&#39;ve heard this before, that kids don&#39;t really like the cutesy story <br/>
books written for kids, that they just read them because they&#39;ve been <br/>
taught to read them.  I&#39;ve read that kind of thing from John Holt and <br/>
even from Charlotte Mason.  Yet I have a 8-almost 9 year old daughter <br/>
who reads as well as any adult but gets really excited about the <br/>
cutesy stories.  Arthur gets the chicken pox, Barbie makes a friend, <br/>
pretty little pony type books.  What&#39;s the explanation for that?  Did <br/>
I baby her too much, was I wrong to buy those kinds of books for her <br/>
when she was little, should I have only ever read her Tom Sawyer and <br/>
Little Women?  <br/>

<br/>
When Cacie was 4 or 5 she found some old school readers that were a<br/>
series of plays, very controlled-vocabulary (they were from a the early<br/>
seventies, I think, when the pendulum had swung away from phonics, which<br/>
suited her just fine) and cutesy. She loved them. We read these plays<br/>
over and over, inane tripe like, &quot;Are you in? I am in. I am not in.&quot;<br/>
Whatever... and then she got past them.<br/>
<br/>
I considered the American Girls books to be totally canned and redundant,<br/>
but Cacie read Every Single Book In Chronological Order (she still has a<br/>
thing about reading a series in order). <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all okay. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose I&#39;ve read some classics to her, I still try to read aloud to<br/>
her even though she can also read anything she wants on her own. I read<br/>
things to her that I think she&#39;ll really enjoy, and remember, because<br/>
that was so meaningful to me when I was a kid. We heard a reading of The<br/>
Most Dangerous Game on NPR one night, and I remembered reading it years<br/>
ago... it was very cool, and she liked the story. <br/>
<br/>
Often I&#39;ll read something to her, and it will stixck in her head and a<br/>
few years later she&#39;ll want to read it to herself... that happened with<br/>
The Little Prince, most of which we read on a BART train.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I really just don&#39;t worry about what Charlottee Mason or John<br/>
Holt or anyone else said will happen, I just think about what is<br/>
happening. <br/>

rush just a couple of months ago.  It is one of the best decisions I <br/>
ever made.  I did it before my 7yr old daughter got health problems.  <br/>
I was just hoping that it wasn&#39;t too late for my 9yr old son.  After <br/>
a month away from school he is already starting to become his old <br/>
self again.  He still slides back to those snotty habits he picked <br/>
up, but not as often and his stomach aches are gone.  He has also <br/>
starting being creative again.  He had stopped sketching altogether <br/>
after a couple kids in his class teased him about his drawings, how <br/>
they couldn&#39;t tell what he was supposed to be drawing and how he was <br/>
terrible at drawing.  These were 3rd graders!?  I can&#39;t imagine what <br/>
kinds of message they are getting from their parents (or maybe other <br/>
peers).  Now he can be confident in his drawing and hopefully blossom <br/>
as an artist.  He has big plans to make a comic book and he wants to <br/>
film a movie this summer, designing all the costumes, writing the <br/>
script, he wants to do it all.  <br/>
<br/>
Your message was from your heart, but I sure felt it in mine.  Thank <br/>
you for sharing it with us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396393210">are you sure you aren&#39;t me. my daughter went though almost the same thing, <br/>
only her teachers refused to speak to me about it, even after speaking to the <br/>
principal. this &quot;teacher&quot; if you will not only ridculed her but attacked me <br/>
in front of her and tried to get the other children to join in. finally i had <br/>
just felt sick after having to send her to school( she has bladder mucles <br/>
that are always tensed and sufferes from migrain headaches as well as causing <br/>
her to throwup.)and having her call home 1 hour later, and like you i thought <br/>
it was a ploy to come home, the principal suggested homeschooling to me if i <br/>
couldn&#39;t get this attendence problem under controll, or else she would not <br/>
pass her state writting test. so i took her out. needless to say she scored <br/>
the highest in the fourth grade, the test ended the day i took her out.<br/>
i thought i was  alone having a teacher attack my child and truly feel for <br/>
those that cannot hs their children. sorry to ramble you just brought back <br/>
memories.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-485896713">Hey Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank you very much for your sane answer.  It was very helpful to <br/>
Liam to hear about Kirby.  Liam really needs to know that he is not the <br/>
only one.  I wish more and more that there were other people living close <br/>
by who we could hook up with so that Liam could see how important following <br/>
his passion is to learning in a natural way.<br/>
<br/>
We want so much to do the right thing for Liam, and today was the first day <br/>
he let me know that he wanted to be doing something he didn&#39;t feel he was <br/>
up to.  He was angry and I could see he felt great despair.  It broke my heart.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your answer.  In fact, I get a tremendous amount from all <br/>
the answers you give.  You really help keep me focused on what we&#39;re trying <br/>
to do.<br/>

My almost five year old is jealous that his older sister gets <br/>
Highlight&#39;s top secret adventures in the mail and he doesn&#39;t.  I told <br/>
him that I would get them for him but that it would make more sense <br/>
to wait until he can read and do them himself.  He has asked to be <br/>
taught to learn how to read.  He&#39;s working so hard at it and it&#39;s so <br/>
sweet.  What&#39;s even cuter is that my almost three year old sits down <br/>
beside him and repeats everything his older brother says.  I won&#39;t be <br/>
surprised if they both start reading together.  And here I had myself <br/>
all prepared to let them wait until they were 12 years old to learn <br/>
how to read!  lol</div>

when she was three.....(she &quot;read&quot; it to everyone!)   At the time,  we knew<br/>
several people coping with chicken pox....and I was coping with not exposing<br/>
myself at 8.5 months pregnant and not wanting to have a newborn and sibs<br/>
with chicken pox.  The book added some humor to a crazy situation.<br/>
    I really thought if you had found the prose of itchy itchy chicken pox<br/>
in a poetry book,  it would be fun and funny for many kids - especially<br/>
since this may well be something within their life experience.  But my<br/>

&lt;&lt; My almost five year old is jealous that his older sister gets <br/>
Highlight&#39;s top secret adventures in the mail and he doesn&#39;t.  I told <br/>
him that I would get them for him but that it would make more sense <br/>
to wait until he can read and do them himself. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids did them when they couldn&#39;t read.  They could still do the matching <br/>
puzzles (many don&#39;t involve reading), and I would read to them.  I also <br/>
showed them the trick of scanning for information, and sometimes they could <br/>
do that themselves, because the questions would tell what page of the book <br/>
the answer was on.  (That&#39;s the skill used in portions of the SAT tests and <br/>
the Law School tests (LSAT or whatever they&#39;re called this season).<br/>

&lt;&lt; learning to read at the age of  12?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some do.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to read at the age they learn works better than pressing them to try <br/>
to do what they can&#39;t yet do.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who learned at 15, and he&#39;s up to speed now.  He was a preemie <br/>
who talked very late too.  He could have dwelt in Special Ed Hell for life, <br/>
or he could have been kept home, nurtured and loved, and been the 17 year old <br/>
he is today.   That&#39;s what happened.  He was over here last week.  <br/>
<br/>
His three siblings read late too, but not that late.  His mom&#39;s account of <br/>
all that is <br/>
here:<br/>

I don&#39;t know the explanation....BUT I know Itchy,  itchy chicken pox has<br/>
been a fun book at our house.  Our second dd...now 7,  memorized this book<br/>
when she was three.....(she &quot;read&quot; it to everyone!)  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
What they like, they like.  But what&#39;s pressed on them for the sake of <br/>
learning to read can be crippling to their love of reading or their desire to <br/>
learn more.<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of read-aloud and beginning reader things, but they&#39;re not the <br/>
life-changing books.  &quot;Move Along, Frog&quot; was a big hit with my boys, and it&#39;s <br/>
about something real.  I don&#39;t mean to disparage all beginning readers, <br/>
honestly!!!  Just to disparage the idea that learning to read at the age of <br/>
six is VITAL, or the idea that reading those books makes the difference <br/>
between future success and the lack thereof.<br/>

novels, light reading of whatever sort. What I refer to as &quot;bubble gum for the<br/>

ability. It&#39;s tiring.<br/>
