One of the interesting things about MS and Fibromyalgia is that we <br/>
lose track half way through anything. Add that to my sheer <br/>
laziness that I never proof read my emails and distares can happen **<br/>
<br/>
Let me cross this back to the scary food additives part of the thread. <br/>
A friend of mine was web-surfing recently and talked about finding info<br/>
online about people with MS having their symptoms made worse by<br/>
consuming Nutrasweet (Aspartame).<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone here done much research on artificial sweeteners?  It&#39;s a<br/>
topic of interest to me.<br/>

Well I haven&#39;t done research on it but I heard the same thing too. My niece <br/>
has MS and a friend in NY has FM. My niece is big into health foods since <br/>
she&#39;s been diagnosed. Of course she also takes daily shots so not sure if <br/>
the food really makes a difference. My friend with FM was searching for some <br/>
sugar substitute that&#39;s natural (can&#39;t think of the name) because of what <br/>
she read about the aspartame.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103926953">My midwife gave my a ton of printed-from-the-internet info on artificial sweeteners, I can look and see if it&#39;s still around here somewhere if you want. I never read through it all, but there were studies done on animals (blech) that showed a very-much increased number had heart and cancer problems with it. Several things linking the elimination of it to the lessening of symptoms of various medical conditions. And something on the effect of it on children, especially unborn children. <br/>

You don&#39;t need to hunt it up.  I just avoid Nutrasweet because it makes<br/>
me feel strangely hungry.  That&#39;s reason enough for me and I don&#39;t<br/>
absolutely have to have serious facts.  But I was curious about what<br/>
people have read/heard and whether they choose to consume it or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668113808">I have FM and went on some, what they called, nutracueticals, (sp?)  a couple of years ago,  I felt great,  have never slept so well if my life!  But I really couldn&#39;t afford them, they ended running me close to $400 a month.   The company they came from was called Mannatech.  I was even selling the stuff,  but didn&#39;t feel good about the price.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if the company is still around or not but they were great.<br/>
Now I avoid the whole soda thing and my yoga is doing wonders for my aches.  I&#39;m sure you are all sick of hearing about yoga from me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I received an alert about Aspartame causing MS symptoms. I found this <br/>
concerning, so I went to my poison source, my husband. He&#39;s is the director <br/>
of a poison control center (amazing the facts he knows about <br/>
poisonings/drugs; I&#39;d better stay on my toes) and works closely with a <br/>
toxicologist (gifted scientist who knows his field backwards and forwards). <br/>
Apparently he laughed, the Aspartame is unfounded spam. Sure some people have <br/>
reactions to the stuff but not to the point of fooling practitioners to <br/>
diagnose MS.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought you might like some info from someone who specializes in the <br/>
effects of substances on the body.<br/>
