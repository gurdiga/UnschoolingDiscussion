&lt;&lt; Hello, Julie!  We are Washingtonians -- and we are essentially unschoolers<br/>
 (though we never use the term -- my book explains what we do, and you can <br/>
call<br/>
 it whatever you want.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, David. I&#39;ve read your book but I don&#39;t recall any use of the term <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;. Of course, I can&#39;t verify that because like all my <br/>
homeschooling books it&#39;s out on loan. Why do you never use the term?<br/>
<br/>
We sometimes use it, although I think in some ways other unschoolers would <br/>
say we don&#39;t qualify. :) I don&#39;t have a better term for what we do. I don&#39;t <br/>
even think I can call it community based learning, because although we take <br/>
advantage of a lot more community resources since reading your book, they are <br/>
not the basis of our educational philosophy. Interest based? Child led? <br/>
Delight driven? No label seems to really define us well.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious.<br/>
<br/>
Still no plans to speak in So. Cal., eh?<br/>

<br/>
So maybe I&#39;m a well-planned eclectic????<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the label will matter. They all lead to more questions, which <br/>
is fine with me since how we learn is one of my favorite subjects.<br/>
