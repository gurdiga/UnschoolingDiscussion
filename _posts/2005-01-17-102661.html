<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859486339">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
My son and I have been playing World of Warcraft, an online D&D-style<br/>
role-playing game, since Christmas. We split the cost of the game and<br/>
are splitting the cost of the monthly online charges.<br/>
<br/>
Although I enjoy the game and play sporadically, Nick is *really* into<br/>
it. None of his IRL friends are into it and he finds the online forums<br/>
too impersonal. He&#39;d like to talk or email with someone, or several<br/>
someones :o), who also are into this game. I&#39;m not into it enough for<br/>
him :o) Are any of your kids playing this? And would like to talk with<br/>
Nick about it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Diana Tashjian</div>
