<div id="ygrps-yiv-330324575">***I think each election, to get into the polls the voter should take a <br/>
test of some sort to prove he has the slightest clue what&#39;s going on and <br/>
who&#39;s who.***<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago when I went to vote Dylan came with me.  He knew everyone<br/>
on the ballot.  He knew about every initiative and proposition.  We made<br/>
him an official looking voter&#39;s registration card and he got to fill out<br/>
a ballot.   (He voted for Ralph Nader by the way &lt;g&gt; he really is a<br/>
radical!)<br/>
<br/>
There was a group of men behind us in the line, grown up guys at least in<br/>
their thirties or forties, and they were looking at the ballot saying<br/>
&quot;Who are all these guys?&quot;  &quot;What&#39;s the Natural Law party?&quot;, etc. <br/>
There were seven political parties on the ballot in Montana that year. <br/>
It was a record, a big deal! <br/>
<br/>
Dylan was shocked.  He was eight years old and he was shocked that voting<br/>
adults didn&#39;t know anything about what they were voting for.  He stood<br/>
there, maybe ten minutes, explaining to these men about the parties,<br/>
candidates, etc...  Their votes counted and his didn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
So there ya go.  My son says kids should be able to vote.   He actually<br/>
called and wrote to our friends in an informal survey about eliminating<br/>
the voting age.   Most said  kids could be too easily tricked, too easily<br/>
pressured, etc.   The older people he knows, 70 years plus were all for<br/>
kids voting.  Mostly they remembered reading about all the reason men had<br/>
come up with in opposition to women voting.  Too easily tricked,  too<br/>
easily pressured, ...&lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan has had many interesting conversations with adults about children&#39;s<br/>
rights.  He and his uncle are trying to design automobiles children could<br/>
drive, for that day when they lower the driving age to ten. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Look out world.  Not only will parents be quaking at not being able to<br/>
spank their kids, but WHOA, what are you gonna do when little VOTERS are<br/>
DRIVING?   Makes satanic T-shirts and eyebrow piercing&#39;s seem kind of<br/>
mild.<br/>
