<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I mean the physical act of writing, period. I have noticed that spelling<br/>
and punctuation and stuff just sort of come, sooner or later - I think I<br/>
mentioned Cacie&#39;s discovery of the apostrophe a few weeks ago, it still<br/>
makes frequent appearances in both plural and possesive words - and she<br/>
can spell a lot of words that she&#39;s memorized, like &quot;happy&quot; and<br/>
&quot;birthday&quot; ;-) -although compared to your average schooled third grader<br/>
she would be behind, and she still asks me to spell a lot when she&#39;s<br/>
writing something that she wants someone else to be able to read.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, Cacie wrote more when she was 3 and 4 than when she was 6 and<br/>
7. I think back then there wasn&#39;t this big discrepancy between her<br/>
writing ability and her reading ability - she was satisfied with pretty<br/>
simple stuff. Now she&#39;s not, she wants to be able to write stories like<br/>
the ones she reads, and she just can&#39;t write like A. Conan Doyle. We<br/>
tried the dictating thing but she never really liked it..<br/>
<br/>
Now she&#39;s learning cursive, at her request - she asked me to do a letter<br/>
a day, capital and lower case, and write them on the white board and make<br/>
a space for her to write them underneath. It&#39;s been pretty cool - she&#39;s<br/>
been able to write her name in cursive for a year or so but hasn&#39;t wanted<br/>
to do anymore since her dad decided to &quot;help&quot; :-P The porblem is that<br/>
we&#39;re now on F, and I went to a wacky school and learned some form of<br/>
cursive that no one else has ever seen, and my Fs and Ts look weird... so<br/>
I have to find a website with standard cursive. I did convince her to<br/>
take the weekend off from it.<br/>

<br/>
I think that is probably true.  7 is very young (although it seemed half-way<br/>
to grown with my first child).  In reality, how much writing does a 7yo NEED<br/>
to do?  Perhaps the occasional thank you note or birthday card.  There are<br/>
lots of things involving writing that a 7yo might enjoy doing, like writing<br/>
stories, making lists, etc., but I don&#39;t think they are probably things the<br/>
child NEEDS to do.<br/>
<br/>
My 8yo hates to write.  Presses too hard, overworks his hand muscles, it is<br/>
a strain to even watch him.  The ease with which he writes did improve after<br/>
he took a pottery class.  Working the clay may have helped strengthen his<br/>
muscles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50754145">I have a book called &quot;Right Brained Kids Living in a Left-Brained World&quot;,<br/>
that states (talking about schooled kids), that their should never be a<br/>
concern about wirting until the child is 9.<br/>
<br/>
I know of at least 4 boys who&#39;s writing was terrible at 8, and magically<br/>
changed at 9.  The author also recommends these kids type instead of<br/>
write.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 7, and his writing (if comparing, which I choose not to) is not<br/>
good...but he can, and I figure that&#39;s all that matters.  The time he<br/>
writes the most (still rarely) is if I&#39;m on the phone...&quot;Mum- I came 2nd<br/>
in GT&quot; or &quot;Tell X I lost another tooth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When my family get at me about it (and they appear to left writing issues<br/>
for times tables now...sigh), I merely let them know how often I<br/>
write...addressing letters, filling out forms, writing lists- everything<br/>
else is typed.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to quiet them- they go on about &quot;in my day&quot;, but they can<br/>
recognise that day isn&#39;t today.<br/>

<br/>
My son will be 12 this May.  He just started reading about a year and <br/>
a half ago.  His first book to read.... Harry Potter!  That&#39;s an <br/>
amazing accomplishment for your first book ever!  He&#39;s gone on to <br/>
read a couple more Harry Potter books since then, but he&#39;s listened <br/>
to most of them on tape.  He loves to listen to books on tape and <br/>
play with Legos or army men at the same time.  <br/>
<br/>
He also reads the info on his PSII games that he needs and his pc <br/>
games.  He likes to read the caption under pics in the books he gets <br/>
from the library.  That way he knows if there&#39;s anything that he <br/>
might want to know more about.  <br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t write at all.  At his age, the &quot;experts&quot; might think he <br/>
has a problem.  If there is an expert on my son, it would be me.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a problem.  He sees no need for it yet and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
enjoy it.  He&#39;s too busy.  Once we were out of printer ink and ds <br/>
wanted some cheats for ps2 game.  I thought he might write out of <br/>
necessity.  I looked over at the computer and I saw his 7 yo sister <br/>
copying his cheats for him (she loves to write/copy). lol He is very <br/>
resourceful!  He knows his way around a keyboard.  And I&#39;m sure that <br/>
he will be able to write whenever he sees the need for it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t look at him and think, &quot;Oh, he has a writing problem.&quot;  He <br/>
just doesn&#39;t need it right now.  He might not ever see the need and <br/>
he might use the keyboard.  Who knows?  He&#39;s great just like he is.<br/>

child who writes at four, then, if eight or nine is the average,  <br/>
there should be one who doesn&#39;t write until 12.<br/>

It&#39;s like height and weight.  Doctors mess with kids for not being  <br/>

is a primatologist was talking about how nature and nurture don&#39;t seem<br/>
to explain everything, how the whole seems to be more than the sum of<br/>
it&#39;s parts.  Which brought us around to talking about how science<br/>
isn&#39;t usually about individual cases, it is more about population<br/>
norms. And even if the population is as specific as psychology<br/>
undergraduates at the University of Durham, it isn&#39;t possible to<br/>
explain every aspect of an individual psychology student at the<br/>
University of Durham based on the population as a whole. You can make<br/>
predictions based on certain information that has some probability of<br/>
being accurate, but you can&#39;t know without actually meeting the<br/>
person, without knowing the individual.   <br/>

This is one of those areas where it might be worth a bit of activist <br/>

I&#39;m not sure how it got to signing names.  I don&#39;t know when or where <br/>
an eight year old would ever need to sign his name.  I was wondering <br/>
if it was unusual to have an eight year old that doesn&#39;t write his <br/>
name, as in on a piece of art work or such.  At his TaeKwonDo class <br/>
they have a  sign in sheet.  The teacher always says this is for the <br/>

him because he wants to do it.  He senses the teachers tension, I <br/>

write his initials.  He has a hard time doing that also.  My friend <br/>
took him once to another location.  She is also an instructor.  She is <br/>
a relaxed homeschooler and a very dear friend.  He wrote his <br/>
initials.  She told him he couldn&#39;t, he had to write his name.  My <br/>

has an eight year old that doesn&#39;t write his name.  In school, they <br/>
write it all day, labeling their work.  I don&#39;t see where even in a <br/>

It sounds like fine-motor control is hard for him.  Does he like to<br/>
play with legos or playdoh?  Do jigsaw puzzles?  Doing those and other<br/>
things like that with him might help.  When I broke my wrist, they had<br/>
me do all those things, like squeezing sponges, washing dishes,<br/>

<br/>
My son Andrew had a very hard time with writing until he started<br/>
painting miniature figures of LOTR and Warhammer, at about age 11. <br/>
After about 6 months, handwriting/printing suddenly wasn&#39;t hard at all<br/>
for him.<br/>

It is just part of a broad ability range.  <br/>

another.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
But just because someone wants to do something doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s  <br/>
physically or mentally able to do it  at that point.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He senses the teachers tension, I think. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s karate teacher said &quot;He has to fill it in himself,&quot; when  <br/>
Kirby was ten and there was a long form.  I simply said &quot;He can&#39;t,&quot;  <br/>
and I continued to write.<br/>
<br/>
You can defuse the teacher&#39;s tension and reassure your child more  <br/>
easily and realistically than you can teach him to write quickly to  <br/>
make a teacher feel better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He told me I failed and told me I should put our children in<br/>
school.  This is why I posted it here.  I wanted to see if anyone else<br/>

<br/>
Yes, there are, but the point isn&#39;t that.  The point is creating a  <br/>
safe space for and around your child so that whatever he knows is  <br/>
valued and recognized and celebrated and whatever he doesn&#39;t know yet  <br/>
isn&#39;t a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Unless your husband understands unschooling a little better, maybe  <br/>
you can&#39;t unschool.  I&#39;m always surprised when mothers seem to be  <br/>
doing this on the sly, without their husband&#39;s cooperation and  <br/>
knowledge.  I don&#39;t see how it could work.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t see where even in a<br/>
school at home situation a homeschooler would need to label his work<br/>
or write his name.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
But you yourself have a real-world situation in which others expect  <br/>
him to write his name.  Either sign in for him and tell them to chill  <br/>
(what if he didn&#39;t have hands or was blind?  Wouldn&#39;t they let you  <br/>
sign on the little line THEN!?), or help him practice writing his  <br/>
name.  Maybe one letter a day, just writing it everywhere, finding it  <br/>
everywhere, playing with it, making it fun, a game.  The next day add  <br/>
another letter, so you&#39;re playing with and looking for that two- <br/>
letter combination, at the beginnings or in the middle of other  <br/>
words, on cardboard boxes, on cereal boxes, on billboards or stores&#39;  <br/>
names.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-7856862">Holly gets her braces off next month.  When she first started going  <br/>
to this orthodontist she was twelve, and that&#39;s about as young as  <br/>
they take people.  He doesn&#39;t believe in braces for very young children.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly first started going, she could hardly write her name.  I  <br/>
would sign her in.  They didn&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
But my point is going to be that sometimes now Marty takes her, or  <br/>
Marty takes himself (he&#39;s 17, and got braces last year at the same  <br/>
place because his weren&#39;t so apparently crooked, the dentist showed  <br/>
us future problems, from X-rays, and they&#39;re problems Keith-the-dad  <br/>
did have, even though his teeth look very straight).<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s sign-in still isn&#39;t pretty.  Others there who go to fancy  <br/>
private schools have beautiful signatures and their parents negotiate  <br/>
elaborately with cellphones about when their appointments can be to  <br/>
fit around all their scheduled obligations.  Holly plans around  <br/>
whether it&#39;s before or after lunch, and not so early she would have  <br/>
to set an alarm.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s sign-in isn&#39;t very pretty, but she takes really good care of  <br/>
her teeth, she asks good questions, makes interesting conversation  <br/>
and comes in as soon as she has a problem.   By contrast, you can  <br/>
guess, some of the others argue with their mothers in the waiting  <br/>
room, make excuses for less-than-stellar oral hygiene, or have great  <br/>
hygiene because the parents press them with rules and guilt and  <br/>
punishments to clean their braces by the book, by the calendar, by  <br/>
the clock.<br/>
<br/>
So a pretty sign-in isn&#39;t everything.  It&#39;s just one small part of a  <br/>
big life.<br/>

Hello Barb,<br/>
<br/>
Googling  &quot;dysgraphia&quot; may (or may not) provide further information <br/>
addressing your situation.  If this is relevant, and your spouse is <br/>
thinking &quot;school&quot;, be aware that some schools deal horrendously <br/>
with &quot;dysgraphia&quot;  to the detriment of children (for example, by <br/>
perhaps treating all illegible or simply slower answers as a failure <br/>
to provide the required work).<br/>
