<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247740920">Now that my oldest child is six, my husband is starting to have some <br/>
concerns and thinking she&#39;d be better off in school.<br/>
<br/>
He says he &quot;wants it to work&quot; and &quot;he likes the idea&quot; but his two <br/>
concerns are:<br/>
<br/>
1) With two younger children, someone, or all three of them, will get <br/>
neglected<br/>
<br/>
2) He really wants some sort of measurable goal, or plan. (which will <br/>
reassure him about #1)<br/>
<br/>
We met with some unschooler friends to talk about their unschooling <br/>
life, and he later said to me that just isn&#39;t enough structure for him. <br/>
He said something like, &quot;Just living your life and learning things as <br/>
they come up, that&#39;s great, and I want the kids to do that, but it just <br/>
isn&#39;t enough. There also needs to be some plan in your mind of where <br/>
you want to get, and some measurable goals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He also said something that I thought was interesting: &quot;Anytime I&#39;ve <br/>
tried to accomplish something, or see someone else try to accomplish <br/>
something, having no plan or goal just does NOT work well. It leads to <br/>
sloppiness, and to things you hoped would happen never getting done, or <br/>
going in circles with where you want to head, that kind of thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The reason I thought that was interesting was that, in general, I have <br/>
found that to be true for me as well. Usually when I approach <br/>
something, whether it&#39;s the laundry or a career change, I have some <br/>
sort of goal or plan - or even steps to follow - in mind.<br/>
<br/>
So ... I&#39;m wondering how much &quot;intentionality&quot; or &quot;planning&quot; is, or <br/>
should be, or could be, involved in unschooling. Surely it&#39;s not years <br/>
of just wandering aimlessly with no structure, goals, hopes, or plans <br/>
of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m wondering what I could present to him to satisfy this <br/>
concern of his. I really don&#39;t want my oldest to go to school, and I <br/>
think my husband doesn&#39;t either, if he could feel confident that <br/>
unschooling would go well.<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of goals and plans might be appropriate for a six year old? <br/>
Did anyone here (or their spouses) have similar concerns? What kind of <br/>
plans or goals, if any, would be reasonable while still maintaining an <br/>
unschooling approach?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Jenny</div>

worksheets, etc., Planning and Goals can also be a part of your  <br/>
unschooling life. It&#39;s just that the goals arise from the child, not  <br/>
the parent. My kids have had - and accomplished - many goals over the  <br/>
years, which involved lots of planning, but because they were  <br/>
internally motivated, they just didn&#39;t have that same &quot;work&quot; quality  <br/>
we&#39;re used to associating with school goals.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a natural part of human nature to plan, to reach for  <br/>
things. I also think that the amount one needs that is a continuum  <br/>
that changes with time as well. Six year olds usually don&#39;t have  <br/>
goals that span much time. Sixteen year olds have more. I would  <br/>
suggest that you and your husband research more stories about older  <br/>
unschooled kids so that you can see how it all works over the long haul.<br/>

Have you been wandering aimlessly thusfar with your children?  Have  <br/>
they learned nothing so far?  Do you ever have plans or a schedule or  <br/>
expectations?<br/>
<br/>
But if you expect for your children to meet all of *your* structure,  <br/>
goals, hopes and plans instead of you meeting some of theirs,  <br/>
unschooling might not be a good path for you.<br/>

Hi Jenny, in response to your dh, I agree with Paula that unschooling  <br/>
can and does involve goals but that they are generated and &quot;owned&quot; by  <br/>
the child.<br/>
<br/>
To help draw your dh out more on this matter it would be interesting  <br/>
to ask him how he or others go with implementing other peoples goals  <br/>
when he/ they have no say or stake in them?<br/>
<br/>
He might appreciate a business environment comparison� it would for  <br/>
example be very problematic for a company if its staff did not share  <br/>
values or an appreciation of the company goals and vision. They would  <br/>
often be going through the motions, doing the most limited work to  <br/>
meet the minimum requirement. It would likely lead to no passion, no  <br/>
drive, no initiative. No fun!<br/>
<br/>
This has been recognized by the likes of Stephen Covey who designs  <br/>
entire programs to try to acknowledge and integrate staff goals &  <br/>
vision into broader company goals & vision. Its also why some  <br/>
consultants are using the concepts from people like Alfie Kohn  <br/>
(Unconditional Parenting etc) in the business realm.<br/>
<br/>
I would not generally draw family / business comparisons as they are  <br/>
often different worlds... but perhaps in this instance it might help  <br/>
to legitimize & create understanding for some of these concepts in  <br/>
your dh&#39;s eyes???<br/>
<br/>
Basically I feel that unschooling presents an opportunity for a child  <br/>
to learn how to explore and (where appropriate) develop their own  <br/>
goals, rather than learning to examine what is put in front of them  <br/>
and accept goals set by other people. Meanwhile as a parent i think  <br/>
the best thing i can do on the goal front is to model and follow my  <br/>
own interests, concerns and passions in planning, creating and  <br/>
reaching my own goals.<br/>
<br/>
Finally i thought id plug this article which might be of some  <br/>
relevance to you and your journey with your dh... It is called:<br/>
<br/>
An Unauthorised Guide for Unschooling Mums dealing with (still  <br/>
developing) Unschooling Dads<br/>

I agree, but a six year old isn&#39;t likely to have goals other than  <br/>
getting to go to the swimming pool or having a special shelf for a  <br/>
collecton.  Parents should make a child&#39;s life rich and busy and  <br/>
happy.  Learning wlll flow into that and through that.<br/>

<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s another huge difference between just being with your  <br/>
child so  much that you already KNOW what she enjoys, and asking a  <br/>
six year old (or even a sixteen year old) to declare her interests  <br/>
and her goals.<br/>
<br/>
Live a rich life and pay attention.  That&#39;s not so hard. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

are stuck in school-think, assume that what *looks like* nothing in their<br/>
minds is really important (sacred even), to the kid who&#39;s doing the<br/>
*nothing*.<br/>
Unschooling (respectful living) includes putting away my judgment and<br/>
opening myself to the wonder of my child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380258419">Maybe for your husband, the plan could be that you document for him a <br/>
few things you see your kids learning each day.  (Sandra has <br/>
mentioned that this helped her husband when she had little ones.)  If <br/>
he needs more than that, you could also outline for him a way that <br/>
you plan to strew or offer (but not push or force) something that <br/>
connects to that bit of learning so as to broaden your kids&#39; world a <br/>
bit more.<br/>
<br/>
You could also remind him, that if he&#39;s worried about any of the <br/>
three being neglected at home, that at school there would be at least <br/>
15 and possibly more like 30.  And even though they&#39;re the same <br/>
chronological age, many teachers will tell you that their kids span <br/>
at least six &quot;grade levels&quot; in any single grade class, so what&#39;s <br/>
being done in the classroom will not necessarily be tailored to her <br/>
level and most certainly not to her interests.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if your husband really means what I&#39;m hearing:  that he <br/>
wants to plan where your child will wind up in some set amount of <br/>
time?  I can understand someone new to unschooling being concerned <br/>
that their kids grow up to be happy, self supporting, contributing <br/>
members of society.  But if that&#39;s the worry, I think he needs <br/>
reassurance by learning about grown unschoolers, not a plan for what <br/>
your kid will do when.  There&#39;s a quote, I think from John Holt, <br/>
that&#39;s often cited in this sort of discussion, that if you wait until <br/>
a kid is 15 or 16, all the 13 years of K-12 learning can be done in <br/>
18 months.  Maybe that will help him relax a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about this bit you said, Jen:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The reason I thought that was interesting was that, in general, I have<br/>
found that to be true for me as well. Usually when I approach<br/>
something, whether it&#39;s the laundry or a career change, I have some<br/>
sort of goal or plan - or even steps to follow - in mind.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  I think that&#39;s true for most of us, when we know what we want to <br/>
do.  I see my children do it all the time.  But it&#39;s often after a <br/>
period that looks very unplanned, unfocused and like they don&#39;t know <br/>
what they want to do.  And that&#39;s true for myself as well.  I have <br/>
periods where I flounder, but then I figure out what I want to do and <br/>
do it.  I actually think those floundering periods are valuable.  I <br/>
think of it as &quot;brain stewing:&quot;  sometimes ideas need time to simmer <br/>
awhile before they really come together.<br/>

<br/>
This is really interesting to me because this exactly how I have been<br/>
feeling lately. For some reason those times of floundering are just<br/>
maddening for me. I have days when all flows and all is well and then<br/>
other days I am &quot;cloudy&quot; and completely unfocused. When I notice my<br/>
children are also something inside of me goes haywire. Is this a result<br/>
of my own institutionalized rearing? When I feel this way I in turn have<br/>
an overwhelming sense of guilt that I am not doing enough for my kids.<br/>
How do you know when what you are doing is good for them or when we have<br/>
just gotten lazy? DH feels there needs to be more structure also so I<br/>
understand how the author of this post feels. With 4 children (11,9,6,5)<br/>
some days are just completely chaotic. I&#39;ve read things about not<br/>
requiring chores or not insisting on bedtimes and it all sounds great<br/>
but I need help with the housework and the kids have to go to bed so I<br/>
can too. I don&#39;t know why I feel so guilty about our choices. Am I<br/>
selfish to ask that we live consciously of one another. And children<br/>
have to learn to understand that adults are/ should be wiser and can be<br/>
respected and trusted. I do not want to rule with an iron hand but order<br/>
is important for the peace of everyone involved. We have always<br/>
unschooled but as of late I am thinking perhaps it would be better to<br/>
add a bit of what I think is best. Children do have amazing insight but<br/>
they do not know all. Should they be completely trusted with the<br/>
responsibility of their own educations? And what do we do if we are<br/>
pressured by law to prove they are learning what is required? I feel I<br/>
should have something to show. Would that really be detrimental to my<br/>
kids if I asked that they do a little work on most days? As long as they<br/>
can also pursue their own interests I don&#39;t think that is truly harmful.<br/>
Perhaps I am more eclectic in my thinking. I don&#39;t want to label myself<br/>
though. Constructive criticism, please! And to the original author of<br/>
this post~ thanks for the floor!<br/>

Could you maybe just try breathing slowly and deeply, just a couple  <br/>

I&#39;m thinking.<br/>

<br/>
This implies that someone here (or all of us here?) are recommending  <br/>
that children not live consciously of one another, but I think what  <br/>
the message is is that when parents are more considerate of their  <br/>
children&#39;s preferences and desires and curiosities, the children are  <br/>
more considerate and respectful of the parents, too.<br/>
<br/>
-=- And children have to learn to understand that adults are/ should  <br/>

<br/>
Well if ruling iron handedly would do that, wouldn&#39;t all adults be  <br/>
wise and respectable and trustworthy?<br/>
<br/>
-=-...And children have to learn to understand that adults are...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Children cannot help to learn about what they think adults are like.   <br/>
All children form opinions of adults, and eventually, as they get  <br/>
older, different opinions of different individual adults.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
think you want your children to &quot;have to learn&quot; something that&#39;s false.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do not want to rule with an iron hand but order<br/>

<br/>
If you don&#39;t think unschooling is best, then don&#39;t!<br/>
If you&#39;ve never really tried loosening up on bedtime and not  <br/>
requiring chores, though, I think your statement that you have  <br/>
&quot;always unschooled&quot; is suspect or limited.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you should do what you think is best.  Not &quot;add a bit,&quot; but  <br/>
TOTALLY go with what you think is best.  Why wouldn&#39;t you?<br/>
<br/>
If you think structure and rules are best, you will be hugely  <br/>
supported in that by millions of people.<br/>
If you think school is best, there&#39;s probably one free and in walking  <br/>
distance.  Most parents thing that is best.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Children do have amazing insight but<br/>
they do not know all. Should they be completely trusted with the<br/>
responsibility of their own educations?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You said you&#39;ve always unschooled, but these are the questions of  <br/>
someone who just heard of it recently and doesn&#39;t really understand it.<br/>
<br/>
No one has said kids know everything.<br/>
No one has said give them responsibility for their own &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
We&#39;re talking about LEARNING, and the responsibility for making sure  <br/>
unschooled kids are in an environment conducive to happy, peaceful  <br/>
natural learning is totally the responsibility of the unschooling  <br/>
parents.<br/>

kids if I asked that they do a little work on most days?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it would undermine and sabotage natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-As long as they<br/>
can also pursue their own interests I don&#39;t think that is truly  <br/>
harmful.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not harmful like rat poison is  harmful, but it won&#39;t lead to  <br/>
full-on, confident unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Perhaps I am more eclectic in my thinking. I don&#39;t want to label  <br/>
myself<br/>
though.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve already labelled yourself an unschooler, though!<br/>

If we say, &quot;Yes, trust them completely with the responsibility of  <br/>
their own education,&quot; then does that mean parents can neglect them?   <br/>
Do parents just stand back and wait for the child to &quot;take  <br/>
responsibility?&quot; That is most definitely not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If we say, &quot;No, don&#39;t trust them,&quot; that is wrong, too. A basic  <br/>
principle of unschooling is that children (young humans) are born  <br/>
ready to learn and if that basic urge to learn isn&#39;t squelched, as it  <br/>
so often is by teachers and parents, then they can be trusted to  <br/>
learn what they want/need to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047029120">Hi Sandra<br/>
<br/>
I have been catching up on email and have been enjoying a feast of your<br/>
thinking on various topics. I have just read this for example: <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; No one has said kids know everything. No one has said give them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>responsibility for their own &quot;education.&quot; We&#39;re talking about LEARNING, and<br/>
the responsibility for making sure <br/>
unschooled kids are in an environment conducive to happy, peaceful natural<br/>
learning is totally the responsibility of the unschooling parents.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
I just wanted to say &#39;Thank you&#39; for all your writing - again! I have been<br/>
hanging around for some time now (about 8 years), reading, thinking,<br/>
disagreeing, rethinking, applying, experimenting, observing, concluding,<br/>
solidifying principles and convictions. My kids in particular and my family<br/>
in general is the better for it. I have never been so challenged to grow as<br/>
I have been in the years since I discovered John Holt, and your emails are<br/>
like fertilizer on that growth. I can&#39;t tell you how often I sit here<br/>
smiling at something you expressed - it is so crystal clear. What a gift you<br/>
have with words.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my heart was full to overflowing, and I wanted to let you share in<br/>
that joy.<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
<br/>
Cathy<br/>
<br/>

My computer is separated from my printer or I would&#39;ve hit &quot;print&quot;  <br/>
and put it in the box I keep of things to read when I need a boost.<br/>
<br/>
I smiled when you likened me to fertilizer, but that&#39;s really okay.   <br/>
I have three compost piles, and I wrote about unschooling as  <br/>
composting too, somewhere...<br/>
