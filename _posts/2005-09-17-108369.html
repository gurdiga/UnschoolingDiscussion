<div id="ygrps-yiv-229344227">Holly and I are planning to go to a movie tomorrow and were reading listings. <br/>
  She and I disagreed about what an R rating really meant, so I found the <br/>
first google hit with explanations and...<br/>
<br/>
This was in the article, after some discussion of &quot;Who&#39;s Afraid of Virginia <br/>
Woolf&quot; and them deleting the word &quot;screw&quot; (before movie ratings existed, in the <br/>
60&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
-=- The second issue surfaced only a few months later.<br/>
<br/>
This time it was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and the Michelangelo Antonioni film <br/>
&quot;Blow-Up.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
I had never heard of &quot;Blow Up&quot; until this afternoon, and rented and watched <br/>
half of it before deciding it was probably too scary to watch with Keith and <br/>
Kirby out of town and Marty out of the house for a few hours.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a siphon pump, I think, sometimes.   When a lot of ideas and <br/>
thought and connections are flowing, there seem to be a steady stream of them.<br/>
