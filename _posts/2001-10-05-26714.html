old Prince Valiant Comic Books....I branched out to those Illustrated Classic <br/>

acquaintance with &quot;MacBeth&quot; in comic format &lt;g&gt;), and then slid completely <br/>

There wasa newer series of classic comics (I wish they would just reprint the <br/>
old ones!!) with a different artist for each one.  Famous comic book artists, <br/>
apparently, but I don&#39;t follow that genre.  I have a few of them.  I LOVE <br/>
that kind of exposure to classics.  But we needed them more in the 1960&#39;s <br/>
than kids with VCRs need them now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760783597">&lt;&lt;Dr. Phil......verbal abuse&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You really see Dr. Phil as abusive?!?!?!?!?  Wow.   I find him direct and to<br/>
the point, but I have never seen him doing anything I thought was abusive in<br/>
any way.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that people who agree to be dissected in front of millions after<br/>
only a very brief interview probably don&#39;t know what they are getting in<br/>
to.....but abusive?  Nah.  at least not in my book.......which is probably<br/>
different from your book  :)<br/>
<br/>
Actually, he works very much like most therapists I have worked<br/>
with.....reframing situations without the benefits of qualifiers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796972265">Yup, I find him to be verbally abusive sometimes and totally insensitive at<br/>
others and too frequently all about his 15 minutes.  I worked in a facility<br/>
with an acute psych wing.  Did the intake and ran some of the groups and<br/>
rarely saw much confrontational therapy and when I did, didn&#39;t see much in<br/>
the way of results.<br/>
<br/>
A good therapist would stop and back up if they saw a person squirm and try<br/>
to crawl into the chair they are sitting on, kinda like looking for an<br/>
escape hatch with that &quot;what did I get myself into&quot; look on their face.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, it works for some and sure some of those folks &quot;look&quot; like they are<br/>
o.k. with what he is doing.  But more of them look like good little Stepford<br/>
wives nodding their heads like those plastic things that folks use to put in<br/>
the back window of cars or on their dash.<br/>
<br/>
You see the same looks on half the faces of folks when she does the book<br/>
thing.  The kinda &quot;yes I&#39;m getting it look&quot; that really says I know I&#39;m<br/>
suppose to be getting it and this book is in so I&#39;ll nod my head and agree<br/>
so I can be &quot;in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;d like to see is a one year after show to see if anyone actually got<br/>
any benefit from their sessions with good ol&#39; Phil.<br/>
<br/>
An example of the verally abusive thing--I just find the whole harassment,<br/>
badgering, eye rolling, put down attitude to be verbal abuse.  On one show,<br/>
a woman tried about 4 or 5 times to explain what she meant and why she was<br/>
where she was at.  He interrupted her everytime and told her she was wrong<br/>
and making excuses.  It was one put down after another--&quot;don&#39;t you get it,&quot;<br/>
&quot;stop making excuses,&quot; &quot;get real,&quot; and then goes on to say &quot;do you know why<br/>
I&#39;m picking on you.&quot;  Poor woman looked dazed and confused and he just kept<br/>
on pounding.  Not terribly professional, more along the lines of shock<br/>
jocks, not a therapist.  And obviously he is the one that was having the<br/>
blonde moment and &quot;doesn&#39;t get it&quot; because there is a difference between<br/>
explaining and excuses.<br/>
<br/>
See, now you know how I really feel &lt;g&gt;<br/>
