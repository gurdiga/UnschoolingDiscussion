  &quot;I think what stresses me the most is when I see these families in their<br/>
  SUV&#39;s <br/>
  or not counting what is in their cart at the store. I know the grass looks <br/>
  greener on the other side and no I dont want to be them but it all does way <br/>
  heavy on my heart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Well, I have an SUV (so scary to admit here :0)), that we bought used, for<br/>
  cash.  I count what is in my cart before it goes in my cart.  Really, before<br/>
  I go into the store.  We have no debt, aside from our mortgage - no credit<br/>
  cards, no other loans.  We live below our means, on a budget. We don&#39;t<br/>
  consider shopping a pastime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  It was not always this way.  I&#39;ve been on the buybuybuy treadmill, I<br/>
  remember the nagging guilty feelings at the cash register, the night-time<br/>
  worrying, and the thrill of finding a &#39;bargain&#39; on some unnecessary item<br/>
  that I just had to have.  When we decided that something had to change, we<br/>
  just stopped shopping.  That simple.  We throw away catalogs without looking<br/>
  at them.  We came up with a yearly budget.  We agreed never to have another<br/>
  credit card.  We only go to a store when there is something we NEED.<br/>
  Thinking about what a need is made a huge difference for us.  We started<br/>
  putting any money we could find into savings - even if it was .02.  If the<br/>
  electric budget was $50, and the bill was $48.50, $1.50 went into savings.<br/>
  We couldn&#39;t believe how quickly those small amounts added up.  We do buy<br/>
  things that we want, but not on impulse, and not without making sure we can<br/>
  spare the money first.  Our whole perspective has changed.  <br/>
<br/>
  We are by no means wealthy, and Jon had been laid off for over a year, but<br/>
  we are in control of what money we do have.  I don&#39;t think it matters how<br/>
  much you make (I&#39;m not talking about truly impoverished families) - anyone<br/>
  can make a budget and stick to it if they decide to.  <br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;re all responsible for our own grass.  If it doesn&#39;t look green enough,<br/>
  we&#39;re the only ones who can change it.  The same way we can be at peace in<br/>
  our families because of the choices we make, we can be at peace with our<br/>
  money because of the choices we make.  ~Rue<br/>

&quot;Return to Sender&quot; and then drop it in a mailbox....let them get their own <br/>

Oh heavens yes!  And he is simply faaaaabulous!  He&#39;s not afraid of who he <br/>
