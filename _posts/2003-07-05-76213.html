&gt; I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really cool - when your daughter in law<br/>
&gt; wants time alone with you!  Block leave is coming up;  she wanted<br/>
&gt; to make sure there would be one afternoon that we could leave the<br/>
&gt; hubbies and kids and go out to spend some time together just the<br/>
&gt; two of us.<br/>

had an adult, married son.  She once told me that she had always tried to <br/>
raise him so that a future daughter-in-law would thank her for the job she did. <br/>
She was very pleased when she accomplished that.<br/>
<br/>
In conversations with Julian about his dreams for the future, we&#39;ve talked <br/>
about &quot;what he want to be when he grows up&quot; (a singer-songwriter), but also how <br/>
he pictures his family life. He thinks that it&#39;ll be very important to him to <br/>
have a loving, close family, and that he&#39;d want to unschool. We asked, &quot;What <br/>
if your partner&#39;s dream is to do work that would make him/her unable to be home <br/>
with the kids?&quot;  He said, &quot;Then I&#39;d make my work in a way so that I could be <br/>
home with them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like that he feels like everyone should have a chance to pursue their <br/>
dreams, AND that he sees that it&#39;s possible.<br/>
