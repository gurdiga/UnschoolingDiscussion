&gt; It sounded very much to me like she was accustomed to her children<br/>
&gt; &quot;obeying:&quot; her. Once she eased up, who knows how she actually unschooled,<br/>
&gt; the children lost some of the fear they had. I mean isn&#39;t that why children<br/>
&gt; really &quot;obey&quot; to begin with? They&#39;re scared of what will happen if they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t. I didn&#39;t see it as an unschooling issue.<br/>

Careful the things you say,<br/>
Children will listen.<br/>
Careful the things you do,<br/>
Children will see.<br/>
And learn.<br/>
<br/>
Children may not obey,<br/>
But children will listen.<br/>
Children will look to you<br/>
For which way to turn,<br/>
To learn what to be.<br/>
<br/>
Careful before you say,<br/>
&quot;Listen to me.&quot;<br/>
Children will listen.   <br/>
<br/>
This is just part of the lyrics. It was beautiful.<br/>
