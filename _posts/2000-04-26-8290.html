<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi All!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I received the following e-mail from a fellow 
homeschooling mom who lives in the San Diego area.&nbsp; The message is 
self-explanatory, and&nbsp;Debbie has given me permission to reprint it 
here.&nbsp; I&#39;d really like to help her and her uncle out, so I&#39;d like to spread 
the word as much as I can.&nbsp; Please feel free to let others know, as 
well.&nbsp; Please note the May 15th deadline.&nbsp; Here goes:</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I&#39;m busy with a project to help my favorite uncle 
who was recently diagnosed <br>with cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis C. He&#39;s 
a world renowned venomous <br>reptile specialist, and married to my husband&#39;s 
aunt. They&#39;re coming out in <br>June, in fact. I&#39;m organizing some fundraisers 
for them, since it&#39;s <br>outrageously expensive to even be placed on the organ 
transplant list - you <br>need to be on Medicaid (they denied them due to her 
making too much money - <br>unreal) or you need to have $250,000.00 in an 
account. And that cost is just <br>to get on the list.<br><br>Feeling helpless 
isn&#39;t my style, so I&#39;m compiling a cookbook. If you have <br>any lemon recipes 
you&#39;d be willing to share, I would appreciate it so much! <br>Or just post the 
request for recipes that is on my signature line to your <br>e-list. Perhaps 
they would be willing to chip in!<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Debbie Nelson<br>Share a 
lemon recipe by 5/15/00 to benefit<br>my uncle&#39;s liver transplant -<br>Get a 
free ad in the cookbook and online!<br>&lt;a <a rel="nofollow"
