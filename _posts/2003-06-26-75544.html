<div id="ygrps-yiv-437566127">How would I go about finding a site or book to look up the origin and<br/>
history of words? What they have become from what they were, how they got to<br/>
be used that way, etc ?<br/>
<br/>
  The reason I ask is I have seen the reference to bohemian used (other<br/>
places, maybe here) several times in the last month or so. I have a<br/>
dictionaries definition but how did it get to be known as 1. a person, as an<br/>
artist or writer, who lives and acts without regard for conventional rules<br/>
and practices *then* 2, Pertaining to or characteristic of a bohemian.<br/>
<br/>
  I am of Bohemian descent and this just keep popping out at me. LOL!<br/>

    Thanks for the help. I couldn&#39;t remember the word to use. That was quite<br/>
interesting. :-)<br/>

&quot;It is change, continuing change, inevitable change, that<br/>
is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible<br/>
decision can be made any longer without taking into<br/>
account not only the world as it is, but the world as it<br/>
will be.&quot;<br/>
