<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582351304">The AOL  welcome page today has <br/>
Put a Stop to Face-offs<br/>
Stop squabbles with Rules, Snacks or Duct Tape:<br/>
5 Tricks<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a photo of two kids five or so giving each other obviously cutely <br/>
staged angry looks.  Neither looks really threatening and neither is afraid.  <br/>
Their arms are folded and they&#39;re closer to smiling than to any large, negative <br/>
emotion.<br/>
<br/>
The advice given reminds me of how important parenting things are to making <br/>
unschooling viable in a family.  If a child doesn&#39;t feel glad to be home, <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel safe and doesn&#39;t feel loved, learning isn&#39;t going to happen.<br/>

<br/>
Each of the five suggestions is on another page, so that you end up (unless <br/>
you have a Mac and can stop a download with Apple/.) seeing LOTS of ads.  <br/>
That&#39;s the point, probably.  And you do end up getting an address for a duct tape <br/>
sales page.  If I can get some photographic camouflage duct tape that might be <br/>
a good deal.  Marty got a roll of it years ago and it was very cool==detailed <br/>
close-ups of pine needles and pine cones.  But I digress, and I think I wish <br/>
they had too.   I&#39;ll comment in another post on the suggestions themselves, <br/>
which are here:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Set some ground rules.<br/>
No hitting, no yelling, no tormenting, or they don&#39;t get to keep playing <br/>
together. <br/>
<br/>
2. Don&#39;t respond to tattling.<br/>
Once they figure out that you aren&#39;t listening, they&#39;ll stop doing it so <br/>
much. Or when they&#39;re mid-bicker, ignore them and do something odd -- like crawl <br/>
under the dining room table with a book. That&#39;ll stop the argument in its <br/>
tracks, and they might even come join you. (Works for tantrums too!) <br/>
<br/>
3. Feed them.<br/>
A handful of Goldfish goes a long way to help soften moods. One caveat: Each <br/>
kid has to get the exact same number of crackers. You don&#39;t want to feed a new <br/>
argument.  <br/>
<br/>
4. Divide and conquer.<br/>
Use bright-yellow-and-black caution tape ($7 from www.duct-tape.com) to <br/>
divide their play space, and tell them they can&#39;t cross to the other one&#39;s side of <br/>
the room. Make believe you&#39;re arriving at the scene of a crime and the giggles <br/>
should help them forget what they were fighting about. <br/>
<br/>
5. Let them work it out.<br/>
Ask them to do something that&#39;ll make them gang up on you. Picking up toys or <br/>
some other much-hated chore should do the trick.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could just stop listening in and worrying. You might be amazed to find <br/>
they work things out themselves.<br/>

I really have trouble with this one.  Personally, I am a natural born <br/>
snitch as my response to distressing events is to talk and talk until I <br/>
feel calmer.  As a kid I trusted adults more than other kids and, yes, I <br/>
did a lot of &quot;tattling&quot;.  I think my motive was to get help (most of the <br/>
time), not to get the other person in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
In a non-punishing home, what would be wrong with telling a parent?  <br/>
When there are no punishments, tattling can&#39;t be used for one-upmanship <br/>
or for revenge, so I don&#39;t see any harm.  (Except that the child is not <br/>
hurtling towards independence, but is staying dependent a bit longer.  <br/>
Big deal.)<br/>
<br/>
**If they want to tell me about a problem<br/>
they&#39;re having, or report something that scared them or that they didn&#39;t <br/>
know how to<br/>
handle, that&#39;s WONDERFUL. **<br/>
<br/>
Right.  There are many kids who are molested and are afraid to tell.  <br/>
(Multiple reasons for that.)  But  for a parent to create a climate of <br/>
&quot;I-don&#39;t-want-to-hear-about-it&quot; is a frankly terrible idea.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me TOO!!! Wow - that is really interesting - to relate THAT to problems <br/>
I have in my life as an adult/parent.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, I have gotten myself into BIG trouble with other adults <br/>
because I assume they want to know stuff - it is SO frustrating to me <br/>
to go to other parents and think I&#39;m letting them know about a problem <br/>
between the kids so that they can HELP with it, and they don&#39;t seem to <br/>
get that. All I want to hear is something like, &quot;Oh, thanks, yeah I&#39;ll <br/>
see what I can do to help.&quot; I&#39;d be totally satisfied just knowing that <br/>
they heard me and that they cared and that they&#39;d make whatever effort <br/>
they could to talk to their own kids or be more present or whatever <br/>
they think might help resolve the problem. And, you&#39;re right, Betsy, <br/>
even as a kid I had a tendency to trust adults (my parents WERE <br/>
trustworthy in this regard) and to think that it was a good idea to <br/>
bring problems out into the light and expect adults to help the kids <br/>
work them out. This is a great insight that will be VERY helpful for me <br/>
- I just realized that probably other adults are sometimes responding <br/>
as if I&#39;m tattling - trying to get their kid into trouble. That has not <br/>
ever been my motivation - and I&#39;ve never &quot;gotten it&quot; that people think <br/>
that. Why would I want to get their kid into trouble with them?<br/>
<br/>
If my child is doing something unkind or dishonest or hostile or <br/>
whatever - something that is causing another kid problems - I want to <br/>
know about it and I would not consider it &quot;tattling&quot; if another kid or <br/>
parent let me know. I&#39;d consider it good information - and that is true <br/>
EVEN if it is hard to hear about my kid not being nice or sensitive or <br/>
kind or honest or whatever.  I expect my kids to mess up sometimes - <br/>
don&#39;t we all? And I want to be able to help them be better - be kinder, <br/>
more honest, etc., so I&#39;d hope my adult friends would let me in on it <br/>
when they see a problem, not be stopped by left-over-from-childhood <br/>
resistance to being a &quot;tattle-tale.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that helps explain why parents do not help each other out as much <br/>
as they could - they&#39;ve been taught as children that &quot;tattling&quot; is bad. <br/>
And they respond to information as if it is tattling - probably all <br/>
kinds of emotional responses come up due to how they were treated as <br/>
children when they tried to get adults involved in kids&#39; problems.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh and I wanted to add that parents often don&#39;t want to get involved <br/>
and help out with kids&#39; social problems and the reason they give is <br/>
that the kids need to learn to be independent and they accuse the <br/>
parent who DOES want to help out of being controlling. That word, <br/>
&quot;controlling,&quot; seems to be the current way to accuse somebody of being <br/>
a bad parent.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t seem to see that there are alternatives that are in between <br/>
not doing anything (ignore the kids and they&#39;ll stop bothering us?) <br/>
versus taking control and telling the kids what to do (keeping the kids <br/>
dependent - parents being controlling). The idea that information could <br/>
be used to simply have some ongoing discussion and analysis of how <br/>
they&#39;re handling things, or for the parent to simply be more alert and <br/>
aware and help the kids see things from another perspective, for <br/>
example - seems to not be in the mix.<br/>
<br/>
And, gosh, that seems like such an obvious direct result to be expected <br/>
from people who have been either ignored or ridiculed or punished or <br/>
otherwise badly treated as a child when trying to bring problems to an <br/>
adult&#39;s attention for help.<br/>

-----------<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s because they&#39;re seeing it as a competition.  If they can prove a <br/>
failing in your kid, it&#39;s points against your &quot;score.&quot;   I&#39;ve seen it but not <br/>
too often up close and personal, except sometimes with my younger sister, <br/>
telling me one of my kids did something and then laughing an ancient laugh.  And <br/>
a few times I&#39;ve recognized it in echoes from childhood when I had done <br/>
something that she had gotten in trouble for before, or that we had criticized her <br/>
about, and then I had done it and she took joy.<br/>
<br/>
One family used to criticize Kirby, always in comparison to their two kids.  <br/>
I eventually just stopped hanging out with them at all, and Kirby did end up <br/>
(at least at the last few comparison points) happier and calmer and more <br/>
charming than their two, though they had gleefully predicted various disasters <br/>
because of my clearly bad parenting.  They were the &quot;sit down and shut up&quot; types <br/>
and they were some of the rare (in my experience) spankers without any religion. <br/>
 Maybe they had religious grandparents expecting it, though, or maybe they <br/>
were just spiteful.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Me too, because my hope is that my kids will get to adulthood with as many <br/>
good clues and tools as possible.  What happens among kids and with small <br/>
amounts of money and with toys and with small projects is REAL preparation for how <br/>
they can make decisions and gauge reactions when it involves things like <br/>
automobile purchases, sharing apartments, getting married, making expensive longterm <br/>
purchases, deciding on investments and business propositions.   All this is <br/>
the same but smaller.   Less risk.  No divorces or lawsuits or credit <br/>
ruinations at this point for them.<br/>
