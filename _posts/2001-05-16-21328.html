life, that most people believe and adhere to, which is not reality for <br/>
everyone.  If someone wants to believe and embrace that way, <br/>
that&#39;s fine.  But it&#39;s not reality for everyone.  I personally believe we <br/>
create our own reality, so what the studies say is irrelevant.  Yes, I <br/>
think the studies are not valid, because the whole scientific method <br/>
is not valid.  That&#39;s my opinion, nobody else has to agree.  If those <br/>
studies validate your reality, by all means, believe in them.  But <br/>
they don&#39;t validate my reality, so I believe them to be in error.  To <br/>

all definitions of words and terms, because they are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355838184">Geez, Louise, I&#39;m beginning to think I&#39;ve logged onto the list for group<br/>
therapy of folks that had crummy childhoods.  Maybe the folks hanging onto<br/>
things aren&#39;t<br/>
those that think there should be some boundaries but those hanging onto the<br/>
past.  IMHO, too many folks are spending way too much time &quot;smelling the bad<br/>
smells&quot; and seeing the half-EMPTY glass instead of remembering and keeping<br/>
close the positives and looking at the half-FULL glass.<br/>
<br/>
And, we seem to be back to all encompassing generalities which are sooooo<br/>
not true!  Perhaps what was good for &quot;your&quot; grandparents&quot; is not good for<br/>
you, but it<br/>
has now been proven that quite a few of the things some of our grandparents<br/>
did were far superior to what we are doing now and are good for us.<br/>
Processed foods being just one of many.<br/>
<br/>
That all encompassing statement implies that all &quot;grandparents&quot; of a certain<br/>
generation were authoritarian beasts who thought torturing children was the<br/>
only way to raise them.  Just ain&#39;t so!<br/>
<br/>
My grandfathers (b. 1866, 1894, 1903, 1905) and grandmothers (b. 1888, 1894,<br/>
1906) were probably a heck of a lot more liberated than quite a few of the<br/>
folks here on this list (certainly less ridgid and more able to see &quot;gray&quot;)<br/>
and way ahead of their times.  None of my mother&#39;s brothers and sisters were<br/>
ever spanked, they were pulled out of p.s. when they complained (guess I<br/>
came by that one naturally &lt;g&gt;) about the treatment, and they were all<br/>
allowed to follow their own interests regardless of gender.  My father was<br/>
an only child and, quite frankly,<br/>
spoiled rotten.  My stepdad had two brothers and he and they all grew up in<br/>
a &quot;relaxed&quot; house with few if any of the contraints that I continually hear<br/>
folks talking about during that era.  They also were allowed, even<br/>
encouraged, to be individuals which probably explains why one is a Steve<br/>
McQueen look alike and keeps up with Jack LaLane (skin diving, motorcycle<br/>
riding, sailing, weight-lifting still when he has passed the age of 70), was<br/>
a regional manager for a Fortune 500 company and a federal contractor who<br/>
has retired with all the toys, one is a pastor who uses his home as a<br/>
shelter to raise abused children and one is a coupe driving and Harley<br/>
riding biker who lives on a reservation.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have memories of horrible things that happened when I was a<br/>
child--when I was 3, some south end of a donkey deliberately swerved his car<br/>
to hit and kill my dog not a yard from my feet.  I went to a school in one<br/>
of the worst ghettos in the U.S.  I was discriminated against and racially<br/>
harassed.  I saw my aunt beat up by her abusive, alcoholic husband and<br/>
subsequently die--I was there when she was given the last rites (age 5).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t *hang onto* those memories.  They are still there but they don&#39;t<br/>
control how I live my life and I don&#39;t allow them to warp my world.  They<br/>
were lessons to be learned from.<br/>
<br/>
What influences my life is memories of a father who read to us each night.<br/>
A mother who stayed up late at night to make all the outfits I wore to dance<br/>
recitals and competitions after working all day.  Walking with my<br/>
grandfather and climbing up to the top of the Carson Manson to see<br/>
&quot;forever.&quot;  Grampa Harry always having rootbeer and ice cream in the fridge<br/>
when I came to visit because that was my favorite.  Grampa Charlie spending<br/>
hours and hours patiently teaching us how to fly fish (and believe me it<br/>
took patience to teach very small children to fly fish).  Gramma teaching us<br/>
how to make &quot;bread,&quot; telling us what a great job we did and only years later<br/>
realising that we didn&#39;t do anything but make a major mess in her kitchen.<br/>
Having teenage/early 20&#39;s uncles that took time out of their life to haul us<br/>
little kids all over the place, play music for us and generally not treat us<br/>
like the<br/>
pests we really were.  Gramma Dorothy who didn&#39;t think we should be deprived<br/>
of experiences just because some folks might think they were dangerous (have<br/>
you ever fed bananas to a panther?).<br/>
<br/>
No, in this instance, your statement should have been &quot;what was good for<br/>
*my* (your) grandparents is soooo not good for *us* (you and your family,<br/>
not the quantitative *us* as in folks in general)!<br/>

But my point was that a study cannot be proven or disproved for a long, long<br/>
time after many, many studies with the same perameters of that study.  And<br/>
how many families are the same of several generations ago?  Do you raise<br/>
your children exactly like your grandparents did?<br/>

Times have changed, so how can you rely on a study to tell you how to raise<br/>

<br/>
You are taking my statement out of context.  I never once implied that my or<br/>
any other grandparent tortured their children.  I am saying that there was a<br/>
general belief of that era that controlling children was the way to get them<br/>
to behave.  The authoritarian method of raising children was a lot more<br/>
prevalent back then than it is today.  That was where the term, &quot;Spare the<br/>
rod, spoil the child&quot; came from.  A lot of parents have learned from their<br/>
parents mistakes (hopefully).  It&#39;s wonderful that your grandparents were so<br/>
lenient, but the fact is that most were not.  Just go look at one of your<br/>
studies.  Oh, wait... your study probably doesn&#39;t say that!  Well, I bet I<br/>
could find one or two that does!<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t tell me what I SHOULD have said.  No, I said exactly what I wanted to<br/>
say, that in general, the generations of yore were more authoritarian than<br/>
they are today.  And I happen to think that type of parenting is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, if the world stayed the same and never changed, if we did exactly as<br/>
our parents or grandparents, or great-grandparents, etc.  did, where do you<br/>
think we would be today?  Eating bugs with a stick!  We are an intelligent<br/>
species that LEARNS from the last generation.  Our grandchildren will be<br/>
raising their children a lot different that we did.  It is called human<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244888041">I did not send the post with the list of studies.  Generalization is not a<br/>
good thing, particularly when it villianizes a whole generation.  It always<br/>
amazes me when homeschoolers and particularly unschoolers do this.<br/>
Particularly when to do so is no different than all the studies that several<br/>
posters seemed to abhor.<br/>
<br/>
The phrase about spoiling the child is quite a bit older than that, by<br/>
hundreds of years.  That generation did not invent it, nor the style of<br/>
parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, everyone has the right to say whatever they want.  However, they can&#39;t<br/>
expect folks to let it slide when their language useage implies or even<br/>
specifically states &quot;all&quot; when what they are stating is an opinion and not a<br/>
fact.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for the real biggy.  Humans, quite frankly, are really stupid and as a<br/>
whole don&#39;t learn from their past.  I mean, come on, pick up any history<br/>
book.  The whole thing runs in cycles.  Religion, greed, war, religion,<br/>
greed, war, over and over<br/>
and over again!  Humans may be able to communicate in ways that other<br/>
species can&#39;t, but, if (and it is a really big IF) they are intelligent,<br/>
they certainly don&#39;t use it!  IF they learned from thier past, they would<br/>
have learned to live in peace, they would have learned not to harm their own<br/>
environment.  Humans, in general, are greedy, self-serving beasts that<br/>
pontificate about how intelligent they are while continuing to do that which<br/>
will eventually harm them.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious, which of your ancestors ate bugs on sticks? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; Well I am glad that your life was such a wonderful one.<br/>
&gt; But my point was that a study cannot be proven or disproved for a long,<br/>
long<br/>
&gt; time after many, many studies with the same perameters of that study.  And<br/>
&gt; how many families are the same of several generations ago?  Do you raise<br/>
&gt; your children exactly like your grandparents did?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Times have changed, so how can you rely on a study to tell you how to<br/>
raise<br/>
&gt; your kids when the study perameters are constantly changing?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;That all encompassing statement implies that all &quot;grandparents&quot; of a<br/>
&gt; certain<br/>
&gt; generation were authoritarian beasts who thought torturing children was<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; only way to raise them.  Just ain&#39;t so!&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are taking my statement out of context.  I never once implied that my<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; any other grandparent tortured their children.  I am saying that there was<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; general belief of that era that controlling children was the way to get<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; to behave.  The authoritarian method of raising children was a lot more<br/>
&gt; prevalent back then than it is today.  That was where the term, &quot;Spare the<br/>
&gt; rod, spoil the child&quot; came from.  A lot of parents have learned from their<br/>
&gt; parents mistakes (hopefully).  It&#39;s wonderful that your grandparents were<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; lenient, but the fact is that most were not.  Just go look at one of your<br/>
&gt; studies.  Oh, wait... your study probably doesn&#39;t say that!  Well, I bet I<br/>
&gt; could find one or two that does!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;No, in this instance, your statement should have been &quot;what was good for<br/>
&gt; *my* (your) grandparents is soooo not good for *us* (you and your family,<br/>
&gt; not the quantitative *us* as in folks in general)!&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t tell me what I SHOULD have said.  No, I said exactly what I wanted<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; say, that in general, the generations of yore were more authoritarian than<br/>
&gt; they are today.  And I happen to think that type of parenting is wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gee, if the world stayed the same and never changed, if we did exactly as<br/>
&gt; our parents or grandparents, or great-grandparents, etc.  did, where do<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; think we would be today?  Eating bugs with a stick!  We are an intelligent<br/>
&gt; species that LEARNS from the last generation.  Our grandchildren will be<br/>
&gt; raising their children a lot different that we did.  It is called human<br/>
&gt; evolution.  We take what we can from our previous generation and leave<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; we don&#39;t want.<br/>
