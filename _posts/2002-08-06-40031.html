<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118200111"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know someone who uses Calvert Curriculum. She is the teacher in that family <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and is spending her summer trying to figure out what she&#39;s going to<br/>
teach her <br/>
son in the fall. She&#39;s sweet and joyful and loves her kids and interacts <br/>
really nicely with them and pays close attention to their interests and<br/>
does <br/>
her best to support them. They all are happy and content with how things<br/>
are <br/>
working. That doesn&#39;t make it unschooling. Why not? Well - because all<br/>
the <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot;  - including the planning, carrying out, and assessment -- is <br/>
incompatible with unschooling, that&#39;s why. If someone comes here and<br/>
wants to <br/>
know about unschooling and she says, &quot;Well, look at all the &#39;teaching<br/>
plans&#39; <br/>
and pick out which kind of teacher you prefer to be and buy the<br/>
curriculum <br/>
and teach it to your child,&quot; it would be really wrong of us not to step<br/>
up <br/>
and say, &quot;That isn&#39;t unschooling.&quot; If we want people to understand, they<br/>
need <br/>
to understand that traditional style &quot;teaching&quot; in the widest meaning of<br/>
the <br/>
word is not necessary then it would be more clear if we didn&#39;t confuse<br/>
the <br/>
issue so  much..&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree, it doesn&#39;t make it unschooling. There seems to be an angst<br/>
amongst some of the unschooling moms that is accepted as part of<br/>
unschooling - a noble suffering with the uncertainty, so to speak.<br/>
That&#39;s OK, if that&#39;s your bent, and it might be just what someone needs<br/>
and wants to experience - a boldness to throw away all guides and go on<br/>
your quest for living! I really am a believer that one size does not fit<br/>
all, and we don&#39;t all have to go the same route or need the same thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I, however, did it differently. I bought or at least looked at  samples<br/>
of every program and curriculum out there. I got books on what your<br/>
child should know when, and how do you teach this and that. To this day,<br/>
my house is stuffed with these books and even textbooks for reference in<br/>
case I want to refer to them. I read lots of them, have zillions I<br/>
haven&#39;t read too. Did I use them with my daughter? Nope. If she asked me<br/>
what they were, I told her it was too boring to do. Or sometimes we<br/>
started with one and it WAS too boring or she already knew or could<br/>
figure out what was in it herself. Sometimes a book was an adventure<br/>
that gave us an interesting starting point for a few minutes and then we<br/>
went off on our own research from there. She had a little fun with some<br/>
thing or other that I had around if she was interested, but mainly we<br/>
read and played and explored the world around, made our own books (not<br/>
because of any suggestion from some curriculum, somehow I could never<br/>
get around to it when i set out to do it that way), but just because it<br/>
evolved naturally out of what we were doing and I was interested and she<br/>
was too at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
What I used all those curriculums and how-to books for was to satisfy<br/>
myself that I KNEW what the system was doing supposedly at different<br/>
levels or grades even, that I knew all the steps clearly in  how to<br/>
multiply and divide fractions or whatever it was I was reading about.<br/>
What X curriculum covered, and what Z curriculum covered and how they<br/>
compared. And nary a one did I make my daughter do. She was too smart or<br/>
not interested or I was not interested ands too smart. <br/>
<br/>
BUT I KNEW and no one could tell me that I was missing anything or<br/>
should do anything. If someone asked me what she was supposed to be<br/>
learning in 4th grade science, I could sit back and say &quot;oh, we already<br/>
covered that last year when we played Where in Space is Carmen San Diego<br/>
- and by the way my daughter and her friend had such fun &quot;cheating&quot; on<br/>
it by looking up all about the moons of every planet in the book &quot;Moons<br/>
of the Solar System&quot; from the library.&quot; No one could shake me, and I<br/>
knew what a paltry thing the school system&#39;s expectations were, and how<br/>
much richer was everything we did. This didn&#39;t take the majority of my<br/>
time, I spent most of my time living and unschooling happily. <br/>
<br/>
But I did use those scope and sequences for myself and sorted out my own<br/>
past education actually. Saw what I had been almost taught in the<br/>
schools, or had heard of and never covered or understood. What I knew<br/>
far more of then they. It was highly profitable time spent for me, and I<br/>
think some of that rubbed off in a good way on my daughter.  Actually,<br/>
probably the attention I did put on it left my daughter with free time<br/>
to go unbothered by me and my concerns or butt-in-ski tendencies. So you<br/>
see: a viable use for curriculums, scope and sequences! To take the<br/>
parents&#39; time to read and figure out and keep them out of their<br/>
children&#39;s hair! Never thought of that one, did ya&#39;? ;)<br/>
<br/>
My life is richer, and now the fluff I hear or run across in this arena,<br/>
I can evaluate, ignore or toss off easily. (I didn&#39;t say I could throw<br/>
away a book...now that is a whole nother story. I am actually looking<br/>
for an abandoned library to renovate and move into; if anyone sees one<br/>
for sale, please let me know.)<br/>

I enjoyed going through the teaching credential program, in a weird warped <br/>
way &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
