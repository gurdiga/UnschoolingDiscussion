<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364973964">Sorry Bridget. . . I had to change the title because it is a pet peeve of <br/>
mine to call young people anything other than that. :)<br/>
<br/>
This week, we went to Baltimore to the Aquarium. Lelia is into animal <br/>
behaviour and interspecies communication. She was able to communicate with <br/>
the dolphins, the &quot;regular&quot; fish (her terminology), and a couple of parrots. <br/>
Quinton really liked the sharks. Lelia is writing some more songs and was <br/>
faced with an interesting dilema which we kind of worked our way through with <br/>
everyone giving opinions (that were asked for) about how they would handle it <br/>
and how we thought she should. There is a workshop with this pretty <br/>
incredible songwriter at her unschool resource center. We just found out the <br/>
date was the same date she is planned to go to the Bahama&#39;s with an old <br/>
friend. Anyway, it got worked out that she would go a couple of days later <br/>
and she gets to navigate the Miami airport on her own. And she gets to go to <br/>
the workshop. She had surgery on her arm one day so her week was kind of <br/>
messed up in that regard. But she learned all the lines to her play she is <br/>
in. And she is watching Moulin Rouge almost everyday. She has almost all the <br/>
lines of every part memorized as well as imitates the accents pretty well. <br/>
She is working on a list of things she would like to accomplish. She is also <br/>
going to volunteer at the zoo and try to do some communicating with the <br/>
animals there. And she works with her dog every day.<br/>
<br/>
Quinton discovered a swing in the yard in this really cool circle of trees <br/>
with some incredible rocks in it. When we moved in, we didnt go anywhere near <br/>
it because of the poison ivy. So we are planning on clearing that area out <br/>
and making a play area for him and fencing that in. He made several new <br/>
friends at the park, got lost at the store and went to the deli lady and <br/>
said, &quot;excuse me, I am lost, can you find my mommy&quot; . . . we thought that was <br/>
pretty cool (he is 2 1/2) that he knew to do that. He didnt get too scared <br/>
and got some cheese (bonus). <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow we are going to New York City on the train and seeing the Statue of <br/>
Liberty, Greenwich Village (Lelia&#39;s choice), and whatever else we fit in. We <br/>
are spending the night too. And that&#39;s the news from Chester Springs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889338835">LIA Mary,I think that&#39;s sweet to call them young people.  It just feels<br/>
awkward to me saying, &quot;My young people.&quot;  Maybe someone would think I was<br/>
talking about one of my split personalities.  (just kidding, sort of) <br/>
Actually, lately it has been giving me pause to call my kids &quot;My&quot; &quot;Kids&quot;,<br/>
since &quot;my&quot; sounds so possessive, and &quot;kids&quot; so goat-like.  (not kidding)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649226755">We&#39;ve been using &quot;kidlets&quot; for over 25 years and &quot;the kidlets&quot; coined the<br/>
phrase in our family themselves.  They had 4-H dairy goats and made a banner<br/>
for a visitors day when the schools brought children to see animals, it read<br/>
&quot;We are the kidlets, these are kids.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97462907">Lately, I&#39;ve been thinking of mine as &#39;my tribe&#39;.  Not in the sense of <br/>
I own them but in the sense of this is the tribe I belong to.<br/>
<br/>
Of course when all five of the big people (we usually leave Wyndham <br/>
with my mom) go out to a store, I think of us as an invading force!<br/>
