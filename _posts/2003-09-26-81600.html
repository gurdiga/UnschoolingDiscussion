<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211313800">Abbi, my dd (9),  loves anime, martial arts and anything along those lines.<br/>
<br/>
She would really like to learn Japanese, so I&#39;ve been looking into language programs.   Like the Power Glide and Rosetta Stone companies.<br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have experiences with language learning programs of these types?   <br/>
<br/>
I am going to search out and see if there is a person in town here who would like to tutor her a bit,  and we have a Japanese Language camp just an hour or so away so she could do that in the summer.  But she would also like something she can do at home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve tried to load a Japanese language pack, from the little window that comes up when I try and access Japanese web sites,  but have been unable to do this!   We have Windows XP and it keeps telling me I have to have a Service Pack CD or something??  I&#39;ve talked to a computer service place in town and they don&#39;t know what to tell me, we don&#39;t have this CD and can&#39;t find it (I&#39;ve googled and searched everything).  ARrrgghh!   I thought it would be fun for her to see the Japanese characters on the computer.   <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone run into this?<br/>
<br/>
I know there are a few people on here who have Japanese backgrounds.<br/>
Any suggestions on learning the language?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

least that&#39;s what I had to do when I needed Japanese<br/>
characters.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if she wants a Japanese pen pal I can ask if any<br/>
of my friends would be interested.<br/>

him what cool sites he&#39;s been to.  I know that he has printed out a little <br/>
sheet of paper with the alphabet on it, and taped it to his puter monitor.  I&#39;ll <br/>
find out where he got that.  The other thing is, on Microsoft Update&#39;s <br/>
website, you should be able to find what you&#39;re looking for as a download.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720291337">Now, LOL, this is ONE subject area I DO know about!  Took it in college; <br/>
albeit 10 years ago, I do remember my pronunciation key--VERY EASY when compared <br/>
to other languages.  It&#39;s putting the sentences together that gets tough <br/>
because they almost speak backwards (compared to us).  Let me look up some websites, <br/>
and I&#39;ll try to recommend what I find to be the best of them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-644855082">If your library interloan has Pimsleur Japanese I would recommend it.  I found Pimsleur recommended in a book about how to learn any language and the author recommended Pimsleur.  From trying to learning French over and over again over the years without much if any confidence in fluency I have to say this is the best program I&#39;ve yet to experience personally.<br/>

  Thanks Joyce,  I&#39;ll make a note of that.<br/>
<br/>
  I am going to do a library search.  Since my computer is pooping out on the language pack! :(<br/>
  I went through all the Windows updates and it still isn&#39;t working. Argghhh!<br/>
