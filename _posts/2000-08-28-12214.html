&lt;&lt; SET TIMES FOR BED vs. <br/>
 ANYTIME IS OKAY...same with rising time. 2)Use of the computer/internet: <br/>
 SHOULD THERE BE A LIMIT? 3)Last year, we homeschooled with a curriculum from <br/>
 Oak Meadow. We did the Saxon Math lessons everyday...after lots of coercing. <br/>
 They both learned alot inspite of resistance. Now we are unschooling (again) <br/>
 and I am having trouble just LETTING GO of math...I doubt that they are ever <br/>
 going to choose to do it on their own...the stuff they were learning, we <br/>
 will probably never come across naturally &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just what&#39;s happened to us is what I can talk about... I had these questions <br/>
as well when I first started and it&#39;s really more about me and my fears than <br/>
anything else.  My son Zak seems to be thriving and happy.  Sometimes he&#39;ll <br/>
be on a computer program for 4 hours and he just turned 5 yesterday.  And <br/>
then he&#39;s not interested for a few days or he may got through a week where he <br/>
wants to play on the computer.  Those computer programs he&#39;s playing with are <br/>
Math and Reading programs couched in Reader Rabbit, DK products, Madeline <br/>
etc... The other day he watched 5 videos in a row and I was panic stricken <br/>
that he&#39;d never get up from in front of the television.  He was watching <br/>
about elephants in africa, austrialia and the great barrier reef, madeline <br/>
and winnie the pooh, then back onto a gorilla tape.... So I have to ask <br/>
myself... Would I be this concerned and gripped if he were sitting at the <br/>
kitchen table with math school books for 5 hours... No of course not... I <br/>
think I had to deschool myself first and accept that this was going to be ok <br/>
no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
Bedtimes we try and stick to a rough time because hubby and I want time <br/>
together.  So he goes somewhere between 7:30pm (if he&#39;s really tired) and <br/>
9:30pm (if we are playing games with him.  My husband likes him up later <br/>
because he&#39;s a work all day and wants to spend time with him... So we <br/>
compromise and some nights it&#39;s early so we can have time and some times it&#39;s <br/>
later so they can have time... It&#39;s sort of evolved.<br/>
<br/>
Math can be found everywhere.  Zak looks at all the prices of things when we <br/>
go to the grocery store and I&#39;ve been talking about them being percentages or <br/>
fractions of other numbers.  He asked what I meant the other day so this will <br/>
be my opportunity to show him something.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m finding fascinating is that I&#39;m learning so much more about the <br/>
things that I didn&#39;t think I knew from before.  Also that I&#39;m very creative <br/>
in giving him information and that it&#39;s not that difficult to do.<br/>
