<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337890992"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How many of you out there have two homeschooling<br/>

<br/>
Our area has a *huge* Christian homeschooling group<br/>
that&#39;s been around forever. It&#39;s so big it&#39;s listed in<br/>
homeschooling book indexes. I don&#39;t belong to that<br/>
group; I belong to a small group of about 15 families<br/>
with maybe 7 families who participate on a very<br/>
regular basis. This group started out as a group of<br/>
moms who wanted to nurse, homebirth, avoid vaccines<br/>
(some of them) and homestead (some of them). When the<br/>
kids reached schoolage, it evolved into a<br/>
homeschooling group. Some of the members ended up<br/>
sending their kids to school and quitting the group,<br/>
and new members joined. I&#39;m one of the newest members;<br/>
I&#39;ve been with them about a year and a half. <br/>
<br/>
The Christian group has big events, events they rent<br/>
arenas for and so forth, and they&#39;re really friendly<br/>
about letting other homeschoolers participate in those<br/>
events. I know homeschoolers who belong to no group at<br/>
all. But other than my small group and the big<br/>
Christian group, I don&#39;t know of any other groups in<br/>
my area. I live in Marquette, on Lake Superior, which<br/>
is a college town of about 25,000, surrounded by vast<br/>
forests and pockets of tiny towns. Ours is the biggest<br/>
town for about 300 miles around, I think. :) So I<br/>
don&#39;t know if there are tiny groups in tiny towns, but<br/>
in our county, I think we&#39;re the only 2 groups. It<br/>
must be amazing to live in a big city and have a big<br/>
choice of groups to take part in. Anyone have that<br/>
situation?<br/>
<br/>
Whoever recommended Dream Snakes, thanks. We&#39;ll give<br/>
that a try. Juli<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Don&#39;t worry about us new people raising our<br/>
eyebrows at the porn comments. Another egroup I belong<br/>
to was talking for days and days about the most<br/>
unusual places they ever had sex (I refrained from<br/>
commenting). This was sparked by someone mentioning<br/>
seeing some poor giraffes at the zoo trying to have<br/>
sex with tons of people watching. :)<br/>

going to move and be in your boat soon.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know how we are going to achieve that without everybody going out<br/>
and prostelytizing their neighbors.  &lt;g&gt;  And that sounds a little<br/>
overzealous. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

But it would be nice!!!!<br/>
