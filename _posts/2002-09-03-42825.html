not as important as dealing with our various communication difficulties,<br/>

able to find the quickest material to answer his unschooling doubts -<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mica, this has got to be hard for you. In our situation, its not that Darin <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to understand, its that it is a hard concept for him to wrap his <br/>
mind around. And maybe, that is the same for your dh, but he doesn&#39;t know how <br/>
to express his feelings of confusion.? I would suggest a few things. One, get <br/>
some of the tapes from the recent hs conference in California. This will <br/>
enable him to hear other people besides you talking or reading to him about <br/>
unschooling, life, kids, loving family relationships... Two, offer to him <br/>
what I have just offered to Darin. <br/>
<br/>
I took Darin to and from work today because the kids and I needed the car. <br/>
While we were in the car together, we listened to one of the tapes I just <br/>
got. This evening he and I were doing the same thing on the way over to the <br/>
grocery store and he was making a few observations about some of the things <br/>
Sandra was saying in the talk we were listening to. And then he asked if she <br/>
was famous. &lt;g&gt; I said well, yes I suppose so, in homeschooling circles. I <br/>
took this as an opening to talk some and asked if he had something he wanted <br/>
to know. Nothing doing. &lt;g&gt; (*Sandra, Darin thinks you are some kinda famous <br/>
homeschooling expert! Go figgure!*) So I said if he had a question and wanted <br/>
to hear someone else&#39;s response or ideas besides mine he should post the <br/>
question here. He seemed really receptive to that. He said that yes, he might <br/>
have a few things he would like to hear others take on. So, I am hoping that <br/>
he will post here soon. I think it will really help. Maybe you could offer <br/>
that same thing for your dh. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What about finding those people who have made it successfully and show him <br/>
material about them. Do you have a HS group in your area you belong to. One <br/>
major thing that really impressed my husband, although he was in total <br/>
support even before, was when our local support group had 4 HSer&#39;s at one of <br/>
our meetings talking of their experiences. Two were unschooled and two <br/>
weren&#39;t but they were all between 16 and 19 and all in college. Two already <br/>
had their own business&#39; going. The way they handled themselves and how they <br/>
answered all the questions we threw at them was very convincing for someone <br/>
who would have been skeptical.<br/>

You may want to try the borntoexplore.org site or the grown unschoolers <br/>
website (don&#39;t know exact address). I&#39;ve used articles on the first one for <br/>
both my husband and in-laws (a current problem). It&#39;s working on the husband. <br/>
He also likes short and sweet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120473085">Thanks Ginny, I&#39;m tempted to obtain the grown without schooling video<br/>
(if that is the website you&#39;re talking about).  Borntoexplore.org<br/>
appears to be a great site - give much to rethink about ADD.  As that is<br/>
not an issue for us I think Greg would be reluctant to read it - &quot;after<br/>
all, our kids don&#39;t have ADD&quot; but if there is a particular article there<br/>
that your husband found particularly influential please let me know.<br/>
