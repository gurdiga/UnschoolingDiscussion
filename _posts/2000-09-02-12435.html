&lt;&lt; Once I felt the squishy carpet (10 feet down the hall) and<br/>
discovered the ocean of water streaming out of the bathroom down the hallway<br/>
and into the heating ducts, I was a screaming zombie!!!!  The water ruined<br/>
the subflooring, carpet and pad (throughout 3/4 of the house), ductwork and<br/>
swelled the doorjambs and drywall.  The damage was over 5 thousand dollars. &gt;&gt;<br/>

probably goes a long way toward making a lot of us feel thankful that (so <br/>
far) our spilled milk isnt all that bad...<br/>
