          I have been in this group for so long I forgot how I joined in the <br/>
first place <br/>
<br/>
I would like to share the group with an unschooling friend, how shall I tell <br/>
her to sign up??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your continued efforts in showcasing the unschooling community<br/>

That&#39;s the URL of the yahoogroups page for this list.  For me, to get  <br/>
to yahoogroups, I just put in the URL box of my browser  yahoogroups.com<br/>
<br/>
That was their old address, and it still forwards.<br/>
<br/>
One can go to that page and sign on.  (And read messages, and look at  <br/>
files, and lots of things.)<br/>

At the bottom of this, these addresses appear:<br/>

That middle one is something you could pass on to your friends.  But  <br/>
tell them we ask people to read a couple of weeks first.  Someone  <br/>
just left the list and wrote us a long complaint about having been  <br/>
asked not to post the day she joined, and not to have  sigline  <br/>
advertising a how-to-teach-reading-and-you-need-phonics webpage.  So  <br/>
she quit the day after she joined.  But an e-mail goes to all new  <br/>
members explaining WHY we want people to read a while.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s anyone here who&#39;s been on this list a ong time, before  <br/>
that e-mail went to new members, or who has just forgotten, please  <br/>
review this before you you invite lots of other people, because we  <br/>
don&#39;t want to make your friends grumpy.  (That info is at the top  <br/>
link above, &quot;Related link&quot;)<br/>
