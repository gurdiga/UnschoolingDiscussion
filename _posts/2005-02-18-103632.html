 </span></blockquote>Gee  maybe it can get my DS to relax on occasion then - because for <br/>
him, TV is cause for bouncing, talking, jumping, playing, acting out <br/>
the plots, etc. Any data about TV sending out &quot;harmful rays&quot; is <br/>
probably about 50 or 60 yrs old now - is a TV screen any more <br/>
harmful than a computer screen? No, they&#39;re the *same* thing. If it <br/>
does anything harmful, then WOW my DS should have been a genius <br/>
because after 6 1/2 yrs of unfettered access, he&#39;s fine and dandy <br/>
and quite creative, energetic and spent the better part of the last <br/>
two days counting by 2s to 100.<br/>
<br/>
Also, take most &quot;studies&quot; with a grain of salt because (a) they&#39;re <br/>
generally done on schooled, restricted kids (b) we&#39;re just barely <br/>
touching the surface on how the brain works.</div>

============<br/>
 <br/>
This SO so bugs me.  Parents to say &quot;too much radiation&quot; might not be  all <br/>
wrong but nobody sits as close to a TV as we&#39;re all sitting to near-same  <br/>
cathode ray tubes (not counting the all-fancy laptop screens and who knows what  <br/>
brain-numbing effect THEY must be having, when the picture disappears if you  <br/>
look from the edge).<br/>
 <br/>
And BRAIN SLOWING!?<br/>
 <br/>
My brain can whip those brains&#39; butts who believe the first &quot;study&quot; they  <br/>
think they kinda read on the INTERNET that will justify their treating their  <br/>
children like brain-fragile little proto-people.<br/>
 <br/>
[I&#39;m cranky because the theater changed its schedule overnight.   Theaters <br/>
should change schedules on Tuesday or Wednesday, not Thursday.  So  Kirby and <br/>
Holly agreed to go to see Meet the Fokkers with me and I was really  giddy about <br/>
finally getting to see it, and when we got there they said it&#39;s not  showing <br/>
until 9:30; they changed the schedule last night.  HOlly has to go  to the <br/>
orthodontist later and Kirby works at 4:30 and I have something going  tonight, <br/>
and Kirby works at noon tomorrow, so the fact that it&#39;s showing all  afternoon <br/>
half an hour away doesn&#39;t save me.  Whiney rant over.  NO,  wait--if I could go<br/>
 to the movies by myself I&#39;d have less to whine about.   I can go shopping <br/>
alone.  I went to the graveyard alone to collect old wax  out of luminarias in <br/>
the DARK, but I cannot go to a movie alone, so I&#39;m mad at  me.]<br/>

No, I think your friend is confusing TV with my mother in law.  <br/>
<br/>
I think what those studies found was that people relax in front of the TV<br/>
after a stressful day at school/wherever.  <br/>
Studies found that people can have &quot;changed&quot; brain activity while<br/>
watching TV they didn&#39;t find people had &quot;brain damage&quot; while watching.  <br/>
There&#39;s a difference.<br/>
<br/>
I bet if they measured anyone doing the thing they found most relaxing<br/>
and stress free they&#39;d find changes in brain activity.   Sitting in a hot<br/>
tub, getting a massage, lounging in a hammock...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m changing mine right now, listening to Joe Brown.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve actually got some of this information in my brain somewhere (gee, must<br/>
have been watching too much TV lately ;-)  With most of it I have yet to be<br/>
able to verify any studies associated with the conclusions, and often they<br/>
are just plane speculation. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my most meaningful source of information about the brain has been<br/>
from my brother, a neuropsychologist.  He pointed out to me that most of<br/>
the information used to make arguments against tv was based on a completely<br/>
outdated notion of how the human brain works (with the old reptilian brain,<br/>
and then newer brains added on over time.)  Anyway, this old notion just<br/>
doesn&#39;t stand up to what the current research today shows us about the<br/>
brain.  Our brains are completely adaptive, and if we have technology as a<br/>
part of our lives then our brains adapt to that and use it to gather new<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want details, I can try to drag them out of the cob webs.<br/>

Look at who sponsored the study, what they were looking for, what they found, the methodology, whether there was a control group, how long the study lasted, and every other little detail.<br/>
<br/>
The news media often picks out little pieces of a study and that usually gives people very innacurate information about the study&#39;s results.<br/>

I am reading Dr. Susan Love&#39;s Breast Book.  I liked the section on what we know about cancer, how we know it, and how many more questions we don&#39;t know the answers to.<br/>

<br/>
Well, of course this is exactly what I had to do! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My friend sent me an article, actually a paper written as part of a <br/>
senior project for the Waldorf Teacher Training Program (sigh) titled <br/>
Strangers in Our Homes by Susan R. Johnson, MD.  Ms. Johnson is an <br/>
Assistant Clinical Professor of Pediatrics, Division of Behavioral <br/>
and Developmental Pediatrics, UCSF/Stanford Health Care. Oh, yes, and <br/>
also a graduate from the Rudolph Steiner Teacher Training Program. <br/>
She presented the paper in 1999 to the Waldorf School of San <br/>
Francisco. <br/>
<br/>
So, completely biased to begin with, but I read it in its entirety <br/>
nonetheless.  I would have pasted it here but it is about 17 pages <br/>
long.  As a previous poster noted, most of her studies cited were <br/>
outdated using the Reptilian R-System for the core brain model.  <br/>
Also, two of her studies cited were from 1985.<br/>
<br/>
To the poster who has a neuropsychologist as a brother (?), if you <br/>
could offer us (me?) current research info, I would be so grateful!<br/>
<br/>
My friend maintained that her eye doctor says TV watching damages the <br/>
eyes, and herself limits her child to one movie per week.  She gave <br/>
no further specifics.<br/>

<br/>
I want to riff a little on the word &quot;stranger&quot;.  It used to just mean <br/>
&quot;outsider&quot;, but now, due to public service announcements and special <br/>
Oprah episodes, we all know it rhymes with &quot;danger&quot; and are likely to <br/>
think of &quot;danger&quot; when we hear the word.  I think the use of this word <br/>
in the title is intended to get people worked up.<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of my life, I&#39;ve met lots of wonderful people who used <br/>
to be strangers to me.  (And most of them aren&#39;t as strange as I am. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;)  I&#39;ve made friends on this list with unknown people that I met <br/>
through the dangerous &lt;g&gt; new medium of the internet.  I&#39;ve invited <br/>
whole homeschooling families over to my house sight-unseen.  (and <br/>
lived!)  I wouldn&#39;t recommend this for everyone, but I have a friend who <br/>
added a roommate to her household after meeting him playing role-playing <br/>
games on the internet.  (I&#39;ve met him many times, and he&#39;s very nice.)<br/>
<br/>
The idea that everyone out there is an axe-murder (or that every TV show <br/>
is about murder) has been wildly overblown.  Strangers are people, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not only that but when it comes to TV, i don&#39;t feel like its a <br/>
stranger at all. It might be kinda sad or pathetic to people who <br/>
don&#39;t watch alot of tv, but many of the characters on shows seem <br/>
like old friends. I was catching a program on SoapNet (soap opera <br/>
channel, yes they have one!)celebrating the 35th (i think)<br/>
Anniversary of the soap All My Children. They had actors on who&#39;d <br/>
been on the show all that time. As i washed dishes i thought about <br/>
how someone like &quot;Erica Kane&quot; has been part of the landscape of my <br/>
life my *entire* life...i dont remember a time before Erica Kane! So <br/>
how is she a stranger?? (My mom was really into soaps when i was <br/>
growing up and still watches them.)<br/>
<br/>
I think its kind of nice that my son could watch Sesame Street and i <br/>
can say &quot;I watched that when i was a kid.&quot; But maybe Waldorf thinks <br/>
the Big Bird is some evil kidnapper or something?;o)<br/>

When I was a kid, Miss Marron (was that her name?  on Romper Room?) said to put on our thinking caps.  And there was a cartoon of some sort with a thinking cap that looked like a funnel.<br/>
<br/>
And I WANTED to channel Micky Mouse.  Maybe an aluminum foil hat with Mickey Mouse ears on it would&#39;ve helped. No, wait!  I had real Mickey Mouse ears I used to wear.<br/>
<br/>
This hat-wearing thing was deeply engrained in the 50&#39;s, in the early days of TVs.  An antenna right on the head!  Ears (which are literally for taking in aural stimuli, TV antennaes were called &quot;rabbit ears&quot;).  The funnel had a point WITH A HOLE in it!!  And romper room had a little circle of mind control that went &quot;Do be a DO BEE, don&#39;t be a don&#39;t be,&quot; and I think there were antennae with that too!!  Little springy BEE THINGS!!!<br/>
<br/>
No wonder I think TV is good.<br/>
It filled me early on with fun and positive ideas and songs and images of happy children playing games and riding stick horses and singing.  <br/>
