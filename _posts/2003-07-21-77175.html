I hardly ever post, not out of fear, but because by the time I figure out <br/>
what I want to say, someone else says it much more eloquently, and because I <br/>
get a LOT more from just reading.  If I were always posting, I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
time to absorb much.  I haven&#39;t noticed that any of the helpful unschoolers <br/>
here judge anyone.  What I see is them trying to get people who don&#39;t &quot;get <br/>
it&quot;  to GET it, that is why people come here after all, I hope.  That&#39;s why <br/>
I&#39;m here, to help my family stay on track.  In the last seven months or so, <br/>
I have seen the most beautiful change in my kids, and myself, and it&#39;s <br/>
because of the things I&#39;ve learned here.  So I remain, unafraid, quietly <br/>
observing the discussions about unschooling. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
