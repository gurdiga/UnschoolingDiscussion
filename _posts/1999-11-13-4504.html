 </span></blockquote>For my toddlers, for whom small dice are dangerous, I buy Giant sized dice.<br/>
 They can also be bought at gaming stores and come in all the varieties of<br/>
larger sizes that you mentioned (10, 12, 20, etc) as well as in 6 and 4<br/>
sided.  We don&#39;t have a good gaming store in our new small town, so I asked<br/>
my brother and SIL to send us some giant sized dice for stocking stuffers,<br/>
as my kids have lost their dice from last year.<br/>
