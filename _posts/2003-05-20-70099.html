<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374658375">&lt;&lt; &gt;  Do &quot;they&quot; <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (meaning teenagers) just go ahead and do what &quot;they&quot; want <br/>
&gt; regardless of what &quot;you&quot; (as parents) think? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh!  I never answered the question. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They do what they want, but what they want is different than school-life <br/>
would have taught them to want.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Kirby left to spend the night with friends without asking!!<br/>
He probably thought I had already gone to bed. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not too concerned, though it  DOES feel wrong to the voices in my head.  <br/>
<br/>
He spends Thursday night with them, more often than not, but last night was <br/>
MONDAY.  <br/>
He missed hanging out with them last week, though, and this Thursday he will <br/>
be camping, so it&#39;s entirely understandable.<br/>
<br/>
Will and Michelle are 20 and 19, I think.  Not sure.  Over 18, not 22.  <br/>
They&#39;ve been a couple for two years, and Kirby  knew both before that, from <br/>
the anime club.  Michelle lives in the dorms, but the dorms closed last week. <br/>
 Her dad lives out of town 30 miles.  Will lives in an apartment, and &quot;going <br/>
to Will and Michelle&#39;s&quot; usually means they all got to Will&#39;s and watch anime <br/>
or play video games until they&#39;re really sleepy, then Michelle goes back to <br/>
the dorm and Kirby stays there.  Or Michelle stays too, and takes Kirby to <br/>
work the next morning.  (Will doesn&#39;t drive.)<br/>
<br/>
I think Kirby and Michelle would make a better couple than Will and Michelle <br/>
do.  I&#39;m not the only one.  It&#39;s kind of a standing joke (the kind that&#39;s not <br/>
a joke).  But I don&#39;t think for a minute that Kirby would &quot;put the moves on <br/>
Michelle&quot; at Will&#39;s house.  Because they&#39;re all friends and they&#39;re all <br/>
bright and none of them are desperate (well maybe Will, a little &lt;bwg&gt;) it&#39;s <br/>
not a sexually charged situation.<br/>
<br/>
I see it as similar to the way our kids have been treated regarding food <br/>
(what and when to eat) and TV (what and when and how much to watch) and <br/>
sleeping (sleeping is for recharging when you&#39;re tired).  They&#39;ve not been <br/>
told &quot;when you&#39;re fourteen you can wear makeup, when you&#39;re fifteen you can <br/>
date, when you&#39;re sixteen you can stay out after midnight&quot; as I was.  When I <br/>
was a teen, if I had turned fifteen and NOT dated, after waiting all those <br/>
years, I would have been a failure! A loser!  Kirby&#39;s sixteen and hasn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;dated&quot; and he&#39;s NOT a loser.  Holly has worn make-up when she wanted to, so <br/>
she doesn&#39;t see it as proof that she&#39;s &quot;old enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gradual respected growing up results in kids who do what they want to do in a <br/>
thoughtful, responsible, calm manner.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote recently about respect which I think applies:<br/>

<br/>
If they&#39;re respected, then they&#39;re respectful.  There&#39;s a link at the bottom <br/>
to the article on &quot;being spoiled&quot; which also directly relates.  My kids <br/>
aren&#39;t needy, and I think it&#39;s desperate neediness that causes most teen <br/>
problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-156962757">The opinions expressed in the responses to my question have <br/>
pretty much been what my initial thought was (although I realize I <br/>
didn&#39;t express myself very clearly in my original post).  That if you <br/>
respect your children and are open and honest with them about <br/>
serious (and other issues as well) issues, they will be able to <br/>
make informed decisions.  I realize that my child will not always <br/>
make the same decisions that I would have and that I have to <br/>
allow her that freedom.  I didn&#39;t mean to sound as though I wish <br/>
to control her and make all choices in life for her.  Only that I <br/>
hope to instill in her the values that our family has on certain <br/>
issues so that she has the tools that she needs to make her <br/>
own choices.  I guess I just started to second guess myself and <br/>
panicked when I thought of her becoming a teen who might <br/>
make bad decisions, as we all do from time to time.   <br/>
<br/>
My own mother has been deceased for 11 years but, I suppose I <br/>
should have been able to look back on how she raised me and <br/>
how I acted as a teen to answer my own question.  She was <br/>
open and honest and I always felt like I could talk to her about <br/>
anything.  Although she was not trying to be my best friend (her <br/>
job was to teach and guide me, not to befriend me), that&#39;s exactly <br/>
what happened.  As a result of her openness and honesty, I <br/>
always WANTED to get her opinion on things going on in my life.  <br/>
After her death, I made some REALLY bad choices.  Choices <br/>
which I KNOW I would not have made if she were living.  I just <br/>
hope that my daughter feels the same way about me that I felt for <br/>
my mother.  I suppose all I can do is what you all have said (and <br/>
what my own mother did) be honest, open, and willing to <br/>
discuss anything and keep my fingers crossed that she turns out <br/>
ok.   :-)<br/>

Respecting children and everyone for that matter, but in particular <br/>
young people, because they see so little of it BECAUSE of their age <br/>
is I think one of THE most important things we can do for them. I so <br/>
value articles like this that you write, and they are worth reading <br/>
over and over again.<br/>
