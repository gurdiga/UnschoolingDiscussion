<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>23 Jan 2003, at  9:51pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-827376787">I wonder how many kids in school are sleep deprived for 12 years?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how much of that contributes to their &quot;problems&quot; in school, &quot;problems&quot; at home, and the general rebellion of teenagers.<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking out loud here.<br/>
<br/>
I know what it is to be sleep deprived for too long.  When I worked till 3 am 2-3 nights/week  (not just weekends like now) I actually fell asleep while I walked around with my eyes open while I was at WORK.<br/>
<br/>
I had a dream and everything.  Scary huh?  Maybe some kids that are &quot;daydreaming&quot; are actually sleeping??<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, just food for thought<br/>

I wonder if that hyperactivity would disappear if those kids didn&#39;t have to get up early every day.<br/>

<br/>
Hallucinations/daydreams are one of the things that happen when people are <br/>
kept awake for several days for sleep/fatigue experimentation.<br/>
<br/>
It has led some researchers to say that  maybe that&#39;s the first purpose of <br/>
sleeping, is so the brain can run through its routines, file its new <br/>
information, process subconsciously whatever...<br/>

hours *after* school playing sports of acting in school plays. By <br/>
the time they get home, they must be ready to drop... but not until <br/>
they do homework for those seven classes a day.<br/>
<br/>
My dh, who is an adjunct professor for College Freshman <br/>
English, says that his students are literally brain dead. Last year <br/>
I subbed for him twice at his 8 a.m. class and some of these &quot;on <br/>
their own kids&quot; came in late with Mountain Dew and donuts. <br/>
Others with cheetos and coke.<br/>
<br/>
Breakfast! (for the exhausted crowd).<br/>

<br/>
I think thats a difference between what &quot;should&quot; be and what is reality.<br/>
<br/>
If something really cool was going on, I&#39;d probably complain taht it was too early, but go anyway.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, early mornings are really beautiful too and well suited for some things.<br/>

Last year we started at 8:00 with T&#39;ai Chi at 6:30 (only a few of us showed <br/>
up for THAT!). People complained LONG and LOUDLY. So this year we&#39;re starting <br/>
at 9:00. I have fewer speakers, so I have more time to fiddle with. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t sleep but one hour each night last year---not to mention none for <br/>
the two or three days before. Then Ren and her kids spent a few days, and I <br/>
felt I needed to get in EVERY minute I could with Ren before she left (I <br/>
hated to see them go.).<br/>
I sent the boys away the following weekend so I could sleep non-stop.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW it&#39;s something I can do. I DID it! For six days! &lt;G&gt; I just figure <br/>
everyone else can do it for TWO days! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059307770">Hi Kelli<br/>
<br/>
Once in awhile, I sleep in until 7:15 a.m. :D not kidding, I&#39;m an <br/>
early riser, mostly because I try to get a load of laundry in the <br/>
dryer before the rates go up, and also mostly, for my own sanity, <br/>
since no one else gets up until after 7:30 (hubby) to 10:00 (Katie, <br/>
if she got to bed late the night before). I have a couple of hours <br/>
EVERY DAY all by myself! which is a vital component of my mental <br/>
health, believe me. <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m usually crashing by 9:00 ish, but often up later than that. <br/>
<br/>
Which, speaking of bedtimes, or at least &quot;stay awake all night if you <br/>
want, in your own room&quot; isn&#39;t getting the kids tucked in nice? Giving <br/>
the parents some time alone together without kids in the middle of <br/>
it? Around here, everyone is sleepy by 9:30 ish, and those who aren&#39;t <br/>
do stay in their rooms until they are sleepy. More often than not, <br/>
I&#39;ve gone into Katie&#39;s room in the morning, to find her in a nest of <br/>
her own making, usually elaborately constructed out of a box, or a <br/>
table with a blanket thrown over it, and a radio on her pillow softly <br/>
buzzing away with static. Indicating that Katie WASN&#39;T sleepy, but <br/>
DID stay in her room. LOL<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi<br/>

I KNOW it&#39;s something I can do. I DID it! For six days!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
You slept for SIX DAYS!?<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;G&gt; I just figure everyone else can do it for TWO days! &gt;&gt;<br/>
I couldn&#39;t possibly sleep for ONE full day!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband comes from a long line of sleepers. He actually had an uncle once <br/>
who slept the whole weekend. The rest of the family was going away for the <br/>
weekend and when they left, he was asleep and when they came back he was <br/>
still asleep. When he woke up, he wondered why everyone hadn&#39;t gone away <br/>
like they said they were!!!<br/>
<br/>
My husband can be in a deep sleep 5 seconds after his head hits the pillow. <br/>
I know, I timed him!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Once in awhile, I sleep in until 7:15 a.m. :D not kidding, I&#39;m an <br/>
early riser &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Before I had kids I was an early riser.  6:00, 6:30, especially in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
But my kids all really like to stay up late, and they ask their best <br/>
questions and get their best ideas &quot;after bedtime&quot; of most people, and it&#39;s <br/>
been that way since they were little.  So I stay up with them, often, and <br/>
reap the results of their day of thinking and doing.  I love hearing what <br/>
they think about things.<br/>

things were going on? Like I said, I stayed up &#39;til 4:00am and got up at <br/>
5:30am. Too much going on! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can do both (but I like a nap when I can). And I give a two hour <br/>
&quot;lunch-recess&quot; (for my nap---but I don&#39;t think I slept much then either!).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s JUST for one weekend! How much sleep do you guys really NEED?????<br/>

    For me the night before leaving to go home would have to be a full<br/>
nights sleep. Granted not everyone drives 10 or more hours.I think some did.<br/>
Coming in was difficult staying up 1) I didn&#39;t know anyone 2) I&#39;d just<br/>
driven all day. If I had a friend to chat with I could have stayed up really<br/>
late Or to help motivate me to get up to join them for T&#39;ai Chi. I was<br/>
interested but not much of a morning person. Hope that helps a little.:-)<br/>

I would gladly trade it for the ability to read long than my children need me <br/>
to to get them to sleep.  I have ALWAYS fallen asleep reading to them, and <br/>
finally Marty would just laugh and tell me, &quot;That&#39;s okay, mom, put in a <br/>
tape.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I read to go to sleep when I was a teen, and so reading lying down makes me <br/>
sleepy.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to be able to stay awake long enough to read two or three <br/>
chapters of a book at night.  I would LOVE to be able to be awake enough to <br/>
drive six or eight hours.  I can&#39;t.  So we haven&#39;t been able to take <br/>
advantage of the possibility of our using our free schedule for me and the <br/>
kids to drive around the country, because I can only drive for two or three <br/>
hours before I&#39;m getting snoozy, and I don&#39;t want to risk their lives.<br/>
