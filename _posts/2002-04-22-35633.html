&gt; &gt; I bet if you owned a restaurant the wording would mean a heck of a <br/>
&gt; &gt; lot to you! :-)<br/>

&gt; Ooohhhh.... A new name for the girls Cafe - The Dead Cow Cafe!  <br/>
&gt; They&#39;ll love it!  Seriously.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Are you trying to discourage people from talking about thinking <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt; their words, and maybe eventually changing their thinking or are you <br/>
&gt; &gt; just commenting on how it doesn&#39;t apply to you?  Either way, why do <br/>
&gt; &gt; you have a problem with it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Joanna<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No I guess what I am trying to say is that *everyone* needs to <br/>
&gt; remember that not all words effect everyone the same way.  In fact we <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even all use them the same ways.  <br/>
