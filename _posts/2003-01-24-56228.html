 The Bible doesn&#39;t say that Judas bought himself a field with the <br/>
 silver. One account has Judas hanging himself, and another account <br/>
 has him falling and bursting asunder. If you think about it, a dead <br/>
 body, after a few days, falling from the limb it was hanging on, or <br/>
 the limb breaking...it would VERY EASILY burst asunder and its bowels <br/>
 gush out. Ugh. <br/>
 <br/>
 Have you ever read a biography of, say George Washington? Then read <br/>
 another Washington bio by a different author. would they be <br/>
 identical? no. No more than the four writers of the gospels used <br/>
 identical words...different authors, different words, different <br/>
 events highlighted.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is the fairytale I always hear Christians concoct when any contradiction <br/>
is pointed out in the Bible. Takes a stretch of imagination to try and make <br/>
all those glaring errors fit.<br/>
Here are the verses, you decide just how much imagination it takes to believe <br/>
that both of these are accurate. You are stating exactly the same things I&#39;ve <br/>
heard other Bible literalists say about this particular contradiction...so <br/>
apparently it&#39;s the cut and dry answer some Christian leader came up with and <br/>
gets parroted frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Mt.27:5 <br/>
&quot;And he [Judas] cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, <br/>
and went and hanged himself.&quot;<br/>
  Acts 1:18 <br/>
&quot; Now this man [Judas] purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and <br/>
falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed <br/>
out.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
