You sound like a wonderful mother, very proud of your daughter and <br/>
rightly so.  <br/>
I have enjoyed your posts.  You have helped me no end with this <br/>
journey into unschooling,which is still so new to me.<br/>

Thank you so much. This is the first post I saw tonight and I needed <br/>
to see it...been one of those long days where nothing seems to click. <br/>
If someone had told me fifteen years ago that I would be helping <br/>
others do what I was doing...I wouldn&#39;t have believed it. It&#39;s like <br/>
I&#39;m living a dream now...and all of you are so much a part of helping <br/>
me fulfill this dream. I will do ANYTHING I can to make this easier <br/>
on you. There are no questions too personal or too difficult. I will <br/>
at least attempt to answer them all. <br/>
<br/>
I miss my Laurie so much. We&#39;ve been apart for two and a half months -<br/>
 our first separation. She&#39;ll be here late on May 14th and I don&#39;t <br/>
plan on EVER letting her go again!!!! I think I&#39;ll get some velcro!<br/>
<br/>
Love, Valerie<br/>
<br/>
okay...I&#39;ve noticed no one signs their name with &#39;love&#39; but I can&#39;t <br/>
help it anymore. You guys are giving me so much.. <br/>

My 22yr old dd is in UK.  She has been gone 12months now.  Her and <br/>
her friend toured europe first, and then off to UK for a working <br/>
holiday. They were going to stay in London as they had friends <br/>
there.  My dd hated it, so went up to yorkshire to stay with her <br/>
grandfather.  Friend stayed in London.<br/>
My dd was born in New Zealand. This was the first time she had ever <br/>
met any of her relatives over there.  She fell in love with them al <br/>
and they with her.<br/>
She also fell in love with a young man and found herself a really <br/>
good job.  I get emails everyday from her.  She is so happy and <br/>
content.  I know that the chances of her coming back here to live are <br/>
very remote........ though she is coming for a holiday in January, <br/>
with the new boyfriend in tow.  I miss her.  Some days more than <br/>
others.<br/>

I would like some help but some of my circumstances are too personal for the list. May I e-mail you privately?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527549052">Geeeez Marianne... I&#39;m not sure I could deal with that... Laurie is <br/>
fine and independent... I&#39;m not... lol  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s have a good cry together... ((((((((Marianne))))))))))<br/>
<br/>
That is truly wonderful that she has found happiness. I don&#39;t mean to <br/>
belittle it at all. This is how we&#39;ve raised our kids...to be free.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Laurie....if you EVER consider going abroad....I&#39;ll duct tape you to <br/>
a chair!!!!<br/>
<br/>
