&lt;&lt; May I ask what a typical day of unschooling is for others?  Do you have <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;   certain lesson plans that you go with?  Also, do any of you enroll your <br/>
 &gt;   children in classes given by the school districts &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a good question and one that I asked over and over again of everyone <br/>
I know that unschools.  I now know what it means for my family... so heres an <br/>
example of a week that we&#39;ve had and it isn&#39;t typical because there isn&#39;t any <br/>
such thing in my family as it varies with whatever else is going on.  I&#39;m <br/>
going to break it down into morning and afternoon otherwise it would take up <br/>
about 10,00000 pages.<br/>
<br/>
Monday Morning - Max up at 5:30am, Zak up at 6:30am.  Breakfast.  Zak wants <br/>
to play Madeline Grade 1 Math on the computer (Zak&#39;s 4) to learn more about <br/>
numbers.  He plays on the computer for about 3 hours.  I&#39;m cleaning house <br/>
with Max following me around while doing it.  Stop into Zak&#39;s room and see if <br/>
he needs me periodically.  Couple of times he asks me about numbers and we <br/>
get his dinosaurs out on the floor of his room and put them in rows according <br/>
to the number he&#39;s counting.  While the dinosaurs are on the floor he asks <br/>
about where they came from and if they are still alive.  I pull out a book in <br/>
his closet about dinosaurs and we looks at those pictures for about 5 mins <br/>
before he wants to go back to Madeline.  Max is watching all this <br/>
interaction.  I put Max down for a nap and work on my business for 45 mins, <br/>
while Zak is still on the computer.  <br/>
<br/>
Afternoon:  Dylan comes over for a playdate (he lives next door and is the <br/>
typical daycare - through public school, son of a single mother child)... <br/>
They get along great.  They play in the garden baseball, decide they are <br/>
going to take their clothes off and run through the sprinkler (It&#39;s 109 <br/>
degrees here).  Max plays in the sand while Dylans&#39; mother and I catch up on <br/>
what&#39;s going on.  Zak tells Dylan about counting dinosaurs and they decide to <br/>
go look at them in his room.... After 40 mins they call out for help.  Zak <br/>
wants to know what is America?  Dylan has been talking about living in <br/>
Tucson, Arizona, USA and Zak wants to know what that means.  I get out his <br/>
globe and show him where I was born in England and Where we live now in the <br/>
US.  He seems quite happy about that and pulls out a map book he&#39;s got to <br/>
show Dylan all the other places we&#39;ve looked at one the map.<br/>
<br/>
Grocery Store.. .Zak helps me pick food out by prices.  Max holds packages <br/>
and tries to eat them.  I ask Zak to get me items that have a 5 and 6 in them <br/>
and count how many he has.  He does this happily.<br/>
<br/>
Steve comes home and takes over:  Lots of play and racing and chasing around <br/>
the house with both boys.  Steve baths them both... Zak and Steve watch a DK <br/>
video about the Jungle.  We went to the zoo the other day and Zak wanted to <br/>
see where Elephants came from.  Again we talk about where places are such as <br/>
Africa.<br/>
<br/>
This is just one day and varies greatly by whatever we are doing.  Of course <br/>
it may seem to lots of people that we don&#39;t do anything but we do lots.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t even add about the socialization he gets from going to the grocery <br/>
store where he talks to lots of people.  I ask him to ask for the cheese and <br/>
turkey breast and he weighs the fruit and veg and I have him put things in <br/>
bags for me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure this is different from other people as well, but as far as I&#39;m <br/>
concerned that&#39;s what unshcooling is all about.  If you read between the <br/>
lines you can see what Zak learned that one day.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>
