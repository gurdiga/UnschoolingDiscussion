<div id="ygrps-yiv-492809578">Hi Bridget and Lovemary,<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, it probably depends on the particular incident, but I <br/>
found that I usually add an explanation along with the apology.  When I <br/>
apologize to one of my children it is usually because I shouted at them <br/>
(which, I think, is probably just as bad as spanking).  I always like to <br/>
explain why something happened.  Usually, it&#39;s something like &quot;I lost my <br/>
temper&quot; or &quot;I didn&#39;t get enough sleep last night&quot;.  I give them a big <br/>
hug and I ask them to &quot;please forgive me, it was my fault&quot;.  They almost <br/>
always do within seconds and things go back to normal.  If I made them <br/>
angry, I think they should be allowed to be angry.  After all, it was my <br/>
mistake to shout at them.  I hurt them and they should be allowed to <br/>
express their feelings.  I have found they never stay angry with me for <br/>
more than a half hour.  It rarely happens.<br/>

&gt; Yes, and that the reason why the apology comes first.  But if all you do<br/>
&gt; is apologize and don&#39;t explain how the actions were connected then the<br/>
&gt; child learns  &quot;mommy is wrong but I&#39;m not.&quot;  But that assumes that the<br/>
&gt; parent is one who does not spank as a rule and who does truely mean what<br/>
&gt; she says when she says she is sorry.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I believe that when you apologize, it should just be an apology . .<br/>
&gt;&gt; .period,<br/>
&gt;&gt; not making an excuse for what happened. When you tell a child, well,<br/>
&gt;&gt; you<br/>
&gt;&gt; pushed too much so that is why I spanked you and I am sorry, they<br/>
&gt;&gt; won&#39;t hear<br/>
&gt;&gt; the sorry part. . . they will only hear that it was their fault. If<br/>
&gt;&gt; a person<br/>
&gt;&gt; is truly sorry for something they have done, in my opinion, no<br/>
&gt;&gt; explanations<br/>
&gt;&gt; of how the other person contributed to it should be there. . . that<br/>
&gt;&gt; is taking<br/>
&gt;&gt; the responsibility off of yourself and placing it on someone else.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Sure, mistakes happen like that. . .and I understand that, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; taking<br/>
&gt;&gt; responsibility is the parental thing to do. Making the child feel it<br/>
&gt;&gt; is their<br/>
&gt;&gt; part is abdicating that responsibility.<br/>

*italics off* our parents and our children... there is also something to <br/>
be said for the underlying icky feeling one gets when they actually hit <br/>
their child. No matter how one justifies it, they know it deep down <br/>
inside. And will generally only admit it to themselves.<br/>

<br/>
Which is an entirely different issue than violence begetting violence.<br/>
<br/>
_I_ see it as a quick fix, like a drug. In the short term it works, in <br/>
the long run it doesn&#39;t. Using fear works fast, and yields deeply <br/>
resentful consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I resort to tactics that aren&#39;t the *right* things.. such as <br/>
guilt, punishment/reward etc. And I have found that my words only come <br/>
back to me somehow. And how absurb the whole thing looks to me.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I&#39;ll ever survive myself *smile*<br/>

I blame ANYONE for using a switch on another person<br/>

probably &#39;survive&#39; but don&#39;t they deserve better than<br/>
that? Like survive AND thrive. To me there is a HUGE<br/>

supporting abusive discipline patterns. Of course none<br/>
of us our perfect. I however, I&#39;m pleased to say that<br/>
my daughter has NEVER been hit with anything or by<br/>
anyone, other than another child :-(. And speaking of<br/>
that, why is it that we tell our kids that it&#39;s wrong<br/>
to hit another person and yet there&#39;s a lot of people<br/>
out there doing just that!? Who can possibly think<br/>
it&#39;s in the kid&#39;s best interest to be disrespected and<br/>
belittled to such a degree!? I think it comes back to<br/>
setting an example to your kids by your actions. I<br/>
understand that sometimes people &#39;fly off the handle&#39;<br/>
and may do something that they later regret, but I<br/>
still think and feel that it&#39;s wrong. And I believe<br/>
that everytime a child is hit, a little more of their<br/>
self-esteem/respect is erroded. Just my opinion and 2<br/>
cents worth.<br/>

 . . . I think there is a huge difference between an open handed swat to<br/>
the butt and using a switch.  Not that I&#39;m a spanking advocate at all,<br/>
but the former can be a spontaneous thing for which one can apologize and<br/>

switch implies premeditated thought -out action. <br/>

&gt; pushed too much so that is why I spanked you and I am sorry, they <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t hear <br/>
&gt; the sorry part. . . they will only hear that it was their fault. If <br/>
&gt; a person <br/>
&gt; is truly sorry for something they have done, in my opinion, no <br/>
&gt; explanations <br/>
&gt; of how the other person contributed to it should be there. . . that <br/>
&gt; is taking <br/>
&gt; the responsibility off of yourself and placing it on someone else. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sure, mistakes happen like that. . .and I understand that, and <br/>
&gt; taking <br/>
&gt; responsibility is the parental thing to do. Making the child feel it <br/>
&gt; is their <br/>
&gt; part is abdicating that responsibility.<br/>

The anger, the loss of control already tells the child she did something<br/>
that has upset the parent. She doesn&#39;t need that message reinforced. But the<br/>
loss of control is *not* the child&#39;s fault.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901261948">Would there ever be a good enough excuse for a husband to hit a wife? <br/>
For an adult to hit an elderly parent?  For a boss to hit an employee?  A<br/>
doctor to hit a patient?  There is never an excuse for a big person to<br/>
hit a little person. <br/>
<br/>
What would be the consequences to a child who used a switch on a parent<br/>

It&#39;s abuse.  A swat, a switching.  Physical violence by a larger,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008552095">Yes, they do have the right to be angry and they need to learn to deal<br/>
with it in constructive ways.  But I think it is also important for them<br/>
to learn that parents are human too.  They can be pushed to the breaking<br/>
point and it is not entirely the parent&#39;s fault when that happens.  To<br/>
assume the entire responsibility for an incident that was provoked does a<br/>
disservice to the child.  I&#39;m not saying that blame should be placed on<br/>
the child.  I&#39;m saying that the child should hear that actions have<br/>
consequences and when you push someone they are often likely to push<br/>
back, parent or not.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my opinion, it probably depends on the particular incident, but I <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; found that I usually add an explanation along with the apology.  <br/>
&gt; When I <br/>
&gt; apologize to one of my children it is usually because I shouted at <br/>
&gt; them <br/>
&gt; (which, I think, is probably just as bad as spanking).  I always <br/>
&gt; like to <br/>
&gt; explain why something happened.  Usually, it&#39;s something like &quot;I <br/>
&gt; lost my <br/>
&gt; temper&quot; or &quot;I didn&#39;t get enough sleep last night&quot;.  I give them a <br/>
&gt; big <br/>
&gt; hug and I ask them to &quot;please forgive me, it was my fault&quot;.  They <br/>
&gt; almost <br/>
&gt; always do within seconds and things go back to normal.  If I made <br/>
&gt; them <br/>
&gt; angry, I think they should be allowed to be angry.  After all, it <br/>
&gt; was my <br/>
&gt; mistake to shout at them.  I hurt them and they should be allowed to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; express their feelings.  I have found they never stay angry with me <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080294882">Yet, some people would say that unschooling is abusive.  Or not <br/>
vaccinating.  Or not giving your kids a bed time.  You might support <br/>
making it illegal for them to spank their children, and they might <br/>
support making it illegal for you to unschool. (I&#39;ve been on lists <br/>
where it&#39;s been called &quot;educational neglect&quot;.)  And not vaccinating <br/>
could be called medical neglect.  We, as a country, need to stop <br/>
trying to usurp God-given parental authority and give parents the <br/>
freedom to raise their children according to their own convictions. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I blame ANYONE for using a switch on another person<br/>
&gt; (or animal for that matter)! Yes, the kids will<br/>
&gt; probably &#39;survive&#39; but don&#39;t they deserve better than<br/>
&gt; that? Like survive AND thrive. To me there is a HUGE<br/>
&gt; difference between &#39;cutting parents some slack&#39; and<br/>
&gt; supporting abusive discipline patterns. Of course none<br/>
&gt; of us our perfect. I however, I&#39;m pleased to say that<br/>
&gt; my daughter has NEVER been hit with anything or by<br/>
&gt; anyone, other than another child :-(. And speaking of<br/>
&gt; that, why is it that we tell our kids that it&#39;s wrong<br/>
&gt; to hit another person and yet there&#39;s a lot of people<br/>
&gt; out there doing just that!? Who can possibly think<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s in the kid&#39;s best interest to be disrespected and<br/>
&gt; belittled to such a degree!? I think it comes back to<br/>
&gt; setting an example to your kids by your actions. I<br/>
&gt; understand that sometimes people &#39;fly off the handle&#39;<br/>
&gt; and may do something that they later regret, but I<br/>
&gt; still think and feel that it&#39;s wrong. And I believe<br/>
&gt; that everytime a child is hit, a little more of their<br/>
&gt; self-esteem/respect is erroded. Just my opinion and 2<br/>
&gt; cents worth.<br/>

somewhere else. It&#39;s victimhood as I see it. . . well, I wouldnt have done it <br/>
had I not been provoked. . . it keeps a person a victim. I don&#39;t want to <br/>
teach my children (by example) that hitting someone else because they are <br/>
provoked is okay to do, as long as you say you are sorry but be sure to <br/>
remind the person that they provoked you. How much sense would this make if <br/>
it were two adults. . .a mom and a dad for instance. Dad hit mom (or vice <br/>

his buttons and therefore was wrong also when dad hit mom.  It just don&#39;t <br/>

etc. I love the John HOlt book that talks about all these rights for young <br/>

does work is one of personal responsibility along with the right to choose. I <br/>

It&#39;s not ok.  No one believes it&#39;s ok.  Yet it happens to children all<br/>
the time with no legal consequences for the offender.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s nice to have God to hide behind.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so, unless it&#39;s clearly phrased as a request for help, a<br/>
request that can be accepted or rejected freely. The way you say it<br/>
(&quot;what THEY need to do differently&quot;)sounds like they then share part of<br/>
the blame, and I don&#39;t like that. <br/>
<br/>
So, for example, in my hypothetical  example of my losing it  and yelling<br/>
while working at the computer, I might ask if she&#39;d be willing to write<br/>
me notes when she needs something if I&#39;m working, and slip them to me so<br/>
that I can read them when I&#39;m at a stopping point, which may take a<br/>
couple of minutes. She can then say, &quot;No, I don&#39;t really like writing<br/>
much and that would be too much of a pain&quot; or &quot;Okay, I could do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I yelled, but YOU need to leave me alone when<br/>
I&#39;m working and not keep asking me for things&quot; is not accepting<br/>
responsibility, and is blaming the victim.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s sometimes a fine line, and if kids are used to being blamed,<br/>
they will often see a request like the first example I gave as a command,<br/>
and will feel like they bear the responsibility for the yelling. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then you are back to putting the focus back on them when it should be on <br/>
yourself and how you plan to do things differently.  It still says that the <br/>
person that was hit has some blame, when in fact, they do not. Their behavior <br/>
of &quot;pushing you too far&quot; is not responsible for you hitting. It can be no <br/>
plainer than that. Same with yelling. . . something I am absolutely guilty <br/>
of. When I feel I have gotten pushed into it, this is an error in my <br/>
thinking. No one can push me to do anything. . . I chose to yell and put my <br/>
children in a position of fear of me. . . very very wrong of me to do. Very <br/>
much MY responsibility to figure out why my buttons get pushed and what this <br/>
says about me (resorting to anger and yelling).  . . something I grapple with <br/>
still. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Blame is absolutely in there. . .when you use the &quot;but&quot; and clarify it is <br/>
they that caused you to yell. That is blaming them. <br/>
<br/>
I do this too. . . I know exactly how frustrating it can be to be interrupted <br/>
and wanting to see it as their fault. . . but it really isn&#39;t. When I yell, <br/>
its ME and only me who yelled. As I said, its an issue I grapple with. . . I <br/>
know it isnt easy. The hardest part is the realization that this is something <br/>
I am doing that harms my children. Stopping what I am doing to pay attention <br/>
to what they need is not always what I want to do, but it is what I need to <br/>
do, and it is what I signed up for.<br/>
