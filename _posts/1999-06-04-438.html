<div id="ygrps-yiv-275053649"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Dear Women Leaders Online:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      As the date for the showing of &quot;It&#39;s Elementary&quot; on OPB is only<br/>
&gt; three<br/>
&gt; weeks away (June 22 at 10:00 pm), we ask that you e-mail and/or<br/>
&gt; photocopy  this notice and give it as wide a distribution as possible.<br/>
&gt; We particularly want to reach teachers, school administrators, school<br/>
&gt; counselors, parents,  middle and high school age students, school board<br/>
&gt; members, community members, and other stakeholders of public and<br/>
&gt; private<br/>
&gt; education.<br/>
&gt;         We can not afford to give this important event the publicity it<br/>
&gt; deserves. That&#39;s where you come in. If you will help us advertize this<br/>
&gt; event the old fashioned way-word of mouth-to the contacts, colleagues,<br/>
&gt; friends, family, co-workers, professional associates, neighbors, etc.,<br/>
&gt; that  you have, we can get the word out to untold numbers of Oregonians<br/>
&gt; that ought  to see this film.<br/>
&gt;         The central message of &quot;It&#39;s Elementary&quot; is that all people are<br/>
&gt; deserving of respect and basic human and civil rights.  It&#39;s goal is to<br/>
&gt; create schools that are safe and affirming for all students, staff,<br/>
&gt; parents,  and families, regardless of sexual orientation or gender<br/>
&gt; identity.<br/>
&gt;         Thank you in advance for notifying and encouraging the people<br/>
&gt; you  know to view the screening of &quot;It&#39;s Elementary&quot; on OPB, June 22,<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; 10:00 pm.<br/>

&gt; Date:   6/2/99 9:33:17 AM Pacific Daylight Time<br/>
&gt; From:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sejamin@...">sejamin@...</a> (Elizabeth Seja Min)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear Friends and Allies,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re very excited to let you know that IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY: TALKING ABOUT<br/>
&gt; GAY ISSUES IN SCHOOL will be broadcast on public television stations<br/>
&gt; across the country, starting in June. We would love your help getting<br/>
&gt; the word out about these broadcasts to your constituencies via email,<br/>
&gt; webposting, or inclusion in upcoming printed materials.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are doing everything we can to publicize the broadcasts among<br/>
&gt; teachers, parents, religious congregants, health workers, community<br/>
&gt; leaders and service providers -- in short, to any adult who works with<br/>
&gt; or cares about children and families. So please distribute the<br/>
&gt; information described below as widely as possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you do not see your local public television station listed below,<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; can call its program department and request that it be aired. Note: In<br/>
&gt; addition to the stations listed for June dates, there are many still<br/>
&gt; considering airing it in late summer and early fall.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We also have printed materials with ideas for follow-up discussions to<br/>
&gt; the broadcats (excerpted from the IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY VIEWING GUIDE). If<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; would  like to distribute these materials to your communities, please<br/>
&gt; contact us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for all you are doing to stop hatred and promote respect in<br/>
&gt; our schools and communities.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY, the groundbreaking documentary featuring frank<br/>
&gt; discussions of gay and lesbian issues in six elementary and junior high<br/>
&gt; schools across the country, will air for the first time on public<br/>
&gt; television stations this June.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With the recent hate killings of two gay men, Mathew Shepard in Wyoming<br/>
&gt; and Billy Jack Gaither in Alabama, there is growing awareness of the<br/>
&gt; need for  early education about discrimination and prejudice based on<br/>
&gt; sexual orientation. IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY shows what most adults can&#39;t even<br/>
&gt; imagine: that schools can address gay issues in age appropriate ways.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Schools cannot be neutral when dealing with human dignity and human<br/>
&gt; rights,&quot; notes National Education Association President Bob Chase, head<br/>
&gt; of the  country&#39;s largest public teacher association. &quot;I&#39;m not talking<br/>
&gt; about tolerance. I&#39;m talking about acceptance. IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY is a<br/>
&gt; great resource for parents, teachers and community leaders working to<br/>
&gt; teach respect and responsibility to America&#39;s children.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First released in 1996, the film has been shown nationally at nearly<br/>
&gt; 500<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; teacher-training programs and to educators and parents at hundreds of<br/>
&gt; schools, churches and synagogues. Last November, Chicago Public Schools<br/>
&gt; announced an initiative to use the film for staff development and<br/>
&gt; training in every school  in the district. IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY has won<br/>
&gt; dozens of awards, including the CINE Golden Eagle for Best Educational<br/>
&gt; Film.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The broadcasts of IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY are being presented by KQED/San<br/>
&gt; Francisco  via American Public Television. Broadcast dates and times<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; subject to change,  and many stations not listed here are still<br/>
&gt; considering airing IT&#39;S ELEMENTARY  later in the summer and early fall.<br/>
&gt; We encourage you to get in touch with your local PBS station and urge<br/>
&gt; them to air the film. To find out how to contact your station, go to<br/>
