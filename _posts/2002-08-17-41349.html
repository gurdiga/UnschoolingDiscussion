Mr. Cummings just might have created some of his own problems for himself,<br/>
if his all-lower case name is any indication. (not that there&#39;s anything<br/>
wrong with that)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another approach to holding our own ground though. We might believe<br/>
that we are unique, and to some extent it&#39;s true, but we can&#39;t help being<br/>
influenced and moulded by others.<br/>

Doesn&#39;t matter who you use.  There&#39;s a theory that we are made who we are by <br/>
all the experiences and inputs of our lives.  And so each person we meet <br/>
becomes something we want to be more like or less like, and that forms the us <br/>
of us.<br/>

<br/>
I had an education professor tell me that in the early 70&#39;s, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
(if from a single source) he and Timothy Leary read it, or it it&#39;s obvious to <br/>
people at some level of understanding how people learn.   Both had studied <br/>
pre-70&#39;s psychology, though, so probably a common source.<br/>

Ooooh, and he said it in the flesh, at the conference.  He went to see<br/>
Sandra speak, Sunday at 8am.  Then in his 9:30am discussion session he<br/>
said after hearing Sandra he was going to be a bit more like her!!!!!!!<br/>
