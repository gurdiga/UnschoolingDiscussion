&lt;&lt; Yep, We are. I feel that life is educational. As the old saying <br/>
goes...&quot;You <br/>
 learn something new everyday.&quot; Today I learned that I can&#39;t function well <br/>
 when the temperature gets above 90 degrees. Or is it the humidity that&#39;s <br/>
 making me crazy? Anyway, I feel like my mind and body both are traveling in <br/>
 slow motion.<br/>

          I live in a small town called Navarre. It&#39;s southwest(I think) of <br/>
Canton/Massillon<br/>
I&#39;m glad you have a pool. When it gets real bad for me(when my skin feels <br/>
STICKY),<br/>
I pour a glass of water on myself (this really cracks the kids up), but it <br/>
helps!<br/>
We had our assessments in April. I can&#39;t tell you how relaxed I am after <br/>
getting that out of the way! Who does your assessments?<br/>
