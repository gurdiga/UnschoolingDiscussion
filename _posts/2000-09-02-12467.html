<div id="ygrps-yiv-773998459">Open minded is always good, but keeping this topic clearly labeled in the <br/>
subject line is not an unreasonable request. I, too, prefer to delete these <br/>
corporal punishment posts.<br/>

&gt;I wish people would be more open minded about this topic. We should be able <br/>
&gt;to turn to our friends for advice. I guess well have to drop the subjects <br/>
&gt;of bumper stickers and baby teeth too, if we&#39;re only going to talk about <br/>
&gt;hsing.<br/>
