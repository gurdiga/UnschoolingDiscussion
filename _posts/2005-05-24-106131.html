<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359200573">I got e-mail from  Mothering Magazine.  I responded as well as I could and <br/>
forwarded it where  people might be more likely to help.  But I thought an <br/>
advance notice that  there will be a homeschooling article there in some coming <br/>
issue might be of  interest to some here. <br/>
Photos of homeschoolers  is a topic that makes me cringe.  I had to get <br/>
practically MEAN to get a  newspaper supplement editor to STOP insisting that her <br/>
photographer was going to  follow us around for a day like she wasn&#39;t even <br/>
there, to take pictures of my  kids homeschooling.  Not only was it like the worst <br/>
possible week (about  this time a couple of years ago, while we were packing <br/>
up half the house for a  medieval campout) but my kids were actually out DOING <br/>
and being and learning in  the community, in various highly photogenic ways, <br/>
none of which the editor  understood enough to realize were the <br/>
prize-photo-ops.  Sometimes it seems  photographers aren&#39;t satisfied until there are <br/>
textbooks open on the table or a  chemistry set a-bubblin&#39;. <br/>
The issue of the kids  actually BEING homeschoolers is dear to me, though.  <br/>
Life Learning will  have several photos of my kids in the summer issue.  The <br/>
covers of another  glossy color homeschooling magazine are just stock generic <br/>
kids and not really  homeschoolers.   But Mothering might do better with stock <br/>
photos than  photos of kids they ignore until they assume the homeschooling  <br/>
position. <br/>
I don&#39;t know who their  writer is for this.  Anyone know? <br/>
====================== <br/>
HI  Sandra, <br/>
We are preparing to  publish a new piece on homeschooling, and are looking to <br/>
shoot photos of young  homeschoolers here in Santa Fe. Iâ€™ve left a  few <br/>
messages with Ed Nagle as well as the appropriate person at  the La  Farge Library <br/>
(where I hear the community networks but we are on a tight  timeframe and <br/>
would greatly appreciate any contacts you can offer. Thanks!  PEACE, <br/>

<br/>
I happened to be looking at the submission guidelines the other day at MM,<br/>
and I noted that they will give priority consideration to articles that<br/>
include photographs. <br/>
