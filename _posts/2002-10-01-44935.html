&lt;&lt; Chile Verde, a kind of Mexican pork stew. I have a recipe, but don&#39;t like <br/>
it. <br/>
I ate it once long ago and it was wonderful! Maybe I will just have to <br/>
experiment and *tweek* the recipe I have. &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I need a recipe, I go to www.google.com,<br/>
put in the ingredients I remember or my best guess at a name, and find lots <br/>
of similar things.<br/>
<br/>
I do a green chile stew and pork would work, though I just use ground beef.  <br/>
<br/>
Green chile, cream-style corn (for thickening and sweetening and color and <br/>
taste), potatoes cut small (for thickening and taste), salt, meat, cook it a <br/>
long time on low.<br/>
<br/>
If you cook the potatoes first until they&#39;re done and add the other stuff and <br/>
cook it until it&#39;s mushy, it&#39;s really good.  You can put tomato sauce or <br/>
canned tomatoes, but we don&#39;t usually do that.  <br/>
<br/>
I use one &quot;unit&quot; of green chile per pound of beef.  Fresh chopped, two big <br/>
chiles per pound.  Or one can.  Or one of the little frozen-chile packets <br/>
from costco which are our current favorite source.   That might be too much <br/>
chile for those who prefer mild.<br/>
<br/>
And it might be a WHOLE different recipe than you&#39;re used to, but google will <br/>
find you some food!!<br/>
