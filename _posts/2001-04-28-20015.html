<div id="ygrps-yiv-298160727">Same here Nancy. My daughter and I were shunned from the local <br/>
homeschooler&#39;s meetings when she was young. I DARED admit that I was <br/>
not force-feeding math down her throat. They were appalled (while <br/>
their 3-year olds had pictures of aborted fetuses on their little <br/>
white t-shirts).  This was in southern Louisiana and I was alone in <br/>
what I was doing the entire 18 years. <br/>
<br/>
Unconventional RULES!<br/>
