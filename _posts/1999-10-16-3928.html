<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531297995">I have used songs and verse to learn lots of things in my life. I think<br/>
that it is an easy way for soem people to remember information and have fun<br/>
at the same time. Have any of you had any experience with this? I would<br/>
like to order some resources in various subjects...especially for late<br/>
elementary level and early HS. I just noticed in Sonlight catalogue<br/>
something called Lyrical Life Sciences...it looks good!<br/>
<br/>
Any comments or suggestions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21049396">We have one of the Lyrical Life Science books/tapes.  *I* thought it was<br/>
fun, but , the other kids thought I was nuts.  &lt;G&gt;  Biologyinfo set to old<br/>
tunes like Clementine and Going Round the Mountain.  We&#39;ve  used it in the<br/>
car.  :)<br/>
