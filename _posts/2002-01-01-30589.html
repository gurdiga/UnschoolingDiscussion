<br/>
I believe that all of us have a purpose in life and whether we are a garbage handler, a taxi driver, a carpenter, a doctor, a scientist, or the president, we all need to learn how to be the BEST that WE can and then help others that are not what we are.  I WOULD NOT want to take my car to a brain surgeon to have him fix my engine and I wouldn&#39;t want to go to the mechanic to have my brain operated on.   I believe that we should respect each job and each human being, whether we totally agree with it or not.<br/>
