<div id="ygrps-yiv-605880010">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My DH just showed me a website that he found last night that I thought<br/>
you might want to check out. I think it&#39;d be a lot of fun for kids<br/>
(and adults) who like to hunt for treasure. :)<br/>
<br/>
The website address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocaching.com">http://www.geocaching.com</a><br/>
<br/>
This is her DH typing now =)<br/>
It&#39;s a Global Positioning System (GPS) based scavenger hunt.<br/>
People hide &quot;caches&quot; of small items and log the GPS coordinates on the<br/>
website. Then Geocachers, as they are called, hunt them down. There is<br/>
usually a small paper log book for people to sign to show they were<br/>
there. For example there is a small cache hidden somewhere Krispy<br/>
Kreme in Fresno consisting of a collection of hat pins. People take a<br/>
pin and leave a pin. This looks like alot of fun and could be used as<br/>
an educational tool (geography, mapping etc.. but shhh don&#39;t tell the<br/>
kids that). The GPS units are available at almost any sporting goods<br/>
store for under $100. They are not necessary for the hunt but it looks<br/>
really hard to do without one. OK back to my wife...<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, my DH now looks for the &quot;educational tool&quot; in<br/>
everything that we do now. :) I caught myself wishing that our DD<br/>
was old enough to &quot;play.&quot; But....who says we can&#39;t do it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
Melissa</div>
