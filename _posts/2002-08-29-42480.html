<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302592860">But my kids had realistic, full-size, anatomically correct baby dolls<br/>
and<br/>
they didn&#39;t get confused.  They had realistic full-size toy food and<br/>
they<br/>
always knew the difference.<br/>

Sandra talking about real looking babies reminded me of a day when my<br/>
youngest was about 3.  She had just really been getting into playing<br/>
with baby dolls and I had given her one that had been mine when I was<br/>
little (she had made a trip to the doll hospital and was ready to be<br/>
played with again).  I was getting the kids in the car after grocery<br/>
shopping and was holding my daughter&#39;s doll upside down by a leg.  I<br/>
looked up at one point because I heard some one yelling.  I saw this<br/>
huge man coming at me yelling!  As soon as he got right up next to our<br/>
car, he said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s a doll!&quot;  He apologized and left red faced.<br/>
That wasn&#39;t the only time this doll has been mistaken for a real baby.<br/>
Thanks for the trip down memory lane.<br/>
