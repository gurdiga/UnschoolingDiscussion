&lt;&lt; My <br/>
 email box has been littered with hundreds of emails (most of no value) that <br/>
 have assualted my faith and have suggested that I abandon my responsibility <br/>
 to &quot;TRAIN UP MY CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO SO THAT WHEN HE IS OLD HE WILL <br/>
 NOT DEPART FROM IT&quot; (Bible verse)  I am suggesting that all  Christians  run <br/>
 from this loop as fast as you can and go spend the time you would have <br/>
wasted <br/>
 sifting thru this garbage can loop to perhaps find a useful philosophicial <br/>
 morsel and spend it eating at a buffet of wisdom in the company of the <br/>
 CREATOR of the universe.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

Just in case there was any question...which I doubt there was, THAT was a <br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
