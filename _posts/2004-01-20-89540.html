<div id="ygrps-yiv-395443176">When people subscribe to this list they are sent an email in which they <br/>
are asked to read for a couple of weeks, at least, before posting.<br/>
<br/>
If they DO that, they usually will get a feel for the list and be less <br/>
likely to post things they don&#39;t really want input about or to post <br/>
things that are going to disrupt the list.<br/>
<br/>
Some people complain about the 2 week reading period -- it is hard for <br/>
us to enforce because, first of all, we don&#39;t expect people new to a <br/>
list to just blatantly ignore the guidelines and, second, who has time <br/>
to keep checking if people have really waited their 2 weeks? PLUS - for <br/>
some people the two weeks isn&#39;t long enough to get a sense of the list <br/>
and other people go in and read archives for hours and have picked up <br/>
on what the list is really like in only a day or so.<br/>
<br/>
But, as a listowner, I ask that all those who signed onto this list <br/>
less than two weeks ago please back out for a while, especially when <br/>
controversial issues are discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Your questions will come up - you don&#39;t have to bring them up right <br/>
away. If you have a BURNING question that can&#39;t wait 2 weeks, go to <br/>
unschooling-dotcom message boards. Or write to me personally if you <br/>
need to - but hold off on posting to the list. We have many years of <br/>
experience and have learned that the list runs much more smoothly if <br/>
people will follow this request.<br/>
