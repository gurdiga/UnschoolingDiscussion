<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562377568">Hi.  We have a 5-year-old son and are looking for some cool parents <br/>
in Seattle that either have a playgroup going or want to start one.  <br/>
Please email us directly -- we&#39;ll probably only be on this list for a <br/>
short time, as we can&#39;t keep up with our email already.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
