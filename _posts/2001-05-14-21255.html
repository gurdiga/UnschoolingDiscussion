Especially notice where it says:<br/>
<br/>
d.  DoDEA will convene a full HSWG in September (tentative).<br/>
<br/>
(1)  The HSWG will consist of voting and non-voting members:<br/>
<br/>
(a)  The voting members will be comprised of representatives from<br/>
each component command, i.e. USAREUR; U.S. Air Force, Europe (USAFE);<br/>
Marine Forces, Europe (MARFOREUR); Navy, Europe (NAVEUR); Central<br/>
Command (CENTCOM); Marine Forces Pacific (MARFORPAC); U.S. Army,<br/>
Pacific (USARPAC); Eighth U.S. Army (EUSA); Commander in Chief,<br/>
Pacific (CINCPAC), and the Defense Domestic Education School System.<br/>
(DDESS).  Each of the component commands will be permitted to<br/>
designate two voting representatives, one command representative and<br/>
one home schooling parent.  (Only exception will be DDESS with two<br/>
home schooling parents.)<br/>
<br/>
SO WHO ARE THE HOME SCHOOLING REPS GONNA BE?????  I sure hope it&#39;ll<br/>
be people who consider themselves responsible for being *visible* and<br/>
*open* and *respectful of all homeschoolers* and *accountable to the<br/>
ENTIRE community*.  This secret stuff is getting really old.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, here&#39;s the rest of it.<br/>
<br/>
***************************<br/>
<br/>
E-mail Letter from Dr. Mike Perez (Education Director, USAREUR):<br/>
<br/>
1 .  Over one year ago, LTG Jordan, USAREUR Deputy Commanding General<br/>
(DCG), became aware of a situation in Heidelberg involving a young<br/>
man who had been home schooled throughout his high school years.<br/>
This young man was a military family member who was unable to achieve<br/>
high enough scores on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery<br/>
(ASVAB) to qualify for entrance on active Army service.  The DCG<br/>
began to ask a series of questions, such as:<br/>
<br/>
a.  Who is responsible for ensuring that home schooled children<br/>
within USAREUR communities receive a quality education?<br/>
<br/>
b.  What are the Commander&#39;s responsibilities concerning education of<br/>
all school age children in USAREUR?<br/>
<br/>
c.  How many school age children in USAREUR communities are being<br/>
home schooled?<br/>
<br/>
d.  What set of laws, rules, regulations apply for home schoolers in<br/>
USAREUR?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2 .  The Education Division within the Office of the ADCSPIM is<br/>
responsible, among other things, for the DoDDS Liaison and Policy<br/>
Function at Headquarters, USAREUR. Research into this issue revealed<br/>
the following: Home schooling, like all education, is a States&#39;<br/>
rights issue in the U.S. Therefore, almost all regulatory authority<br/>
concerning public education is found in the individual States&#39; laws.<br/>
Likewise, each State passes laws concerning the conduct of home<br/>
schooling within that State.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3 .  The crux of the home schooling issue is the balance of two sets<br/>
of rights:<br/>
<br/>
a.  The rights of parents to home school their school age children.<br/>
<br/>
b.  The rights of children to a quality education.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4 .  In Europe, the rights of parents to home school their school age<br/>
children are protected.  In fact, many parents within the European<br/>
U.S. community exercise this option.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5 .  In Europe, there are no U.S. laws that protect the rights of<br/>
children to a quality education.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6 .  Although there is a current Army regulation that briefly<br/>
addresses &quot;educational neglect,&quot; there is insufficient definition to<br/>
provide meaningful guidance to Commanders in the enforcement of any<br/>
policy related to such neglect.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
7 .  A review of existing State laws in the U.S. reveals a wide range<br/>
of possible laws concerning home schooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8 .  There is a series of councils in USAREUR that makes it possible<br/>
for parents, DoDDS teachers and administrators, and Commanders to<br/>
voice their concerns about education of school age children in this<br/>
Command.  This series includes:<br/>
<br/>
a.  School Advisory Council (SAC) at the individual school level.<br/>
<br/>
b.  Installation Advisory Council (IAC) at the installation (ASG)<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
c.  Component Commander&#39;s Advisory Council, chaired by the DCG twice<br/>
annually.<br/>
<br/>
d.  The European Schools Council, chaired by the J-1 staff at<br/>
Headquarters, European Command (EUCOM), and attended by the USAREUR<br/>
DCG (also twice annually).<br/>
<br/>
e.  The Dependent Education Council, chaired by DoDEA in Arlington,<br/>
Virginia and attended by the USAREUR DCG twice annually.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
9 .  In the past two years, at each CCAC, ASG Commanders have voiced<br/>
their concern about the lack of detailed policy on home schooling in<br/>
EUCOM and in USAREUR.  Based on these concerns, the USAREUR DCG<br/>
raised this issue at the past two DEC meetings in Arlington, VA.   As<br/>
a result, the Department of Defense Education Agency (DoDEA) has<br/>
formed a Home Schooling Working Group (HSWG).  The first meeting of<br/>
the HSWG was held on 12 Feb 01 at DoDEA HQ in Arlington, VA.  Present<br/>
were representatives from:<br/>
<br/>
a.  HQ, DoDEA.<br/>
b.  HQ, EUCOM, J-1.<br/>
c.  HQ, Department of the Army, Community and Family Support Center<br/>
(CFSC).<br/>
d.  HQ, U.S. Marine Corps.<br/>
e.  HQ, U.S. Air Force.<br/>
f.  HQ, USAREUR.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10 .  Based on current States laws, following issues were identified<br/>
to be included in the HSWG focus:<br/>
<br/>
a.  Attendance/Hours of Instruction per Subject.<br/>
b.  Record keeping.<br/>
c.  Curriculum requirements/core subjects.<br/>
d.  Teacher qualifications.<br/>
e.  Requirement to notify of intent to home school.<br/>
f.  Accountability.<br/>
g.  Access to sports and other school-sponsored activities and<br/>
facilities.<br/>
h.  Testing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
11 .  Based on this preliminary meeting, the following actions were<br/>
taken:<br/>
<br/>
a.  DoDEA has requested Department of Defense (DoD) General Counsel<br/>
(GC) to conduct research and report concerning the laws of host<br/>
nations where military personnel are stationed outside the<br/>
Continental U.S. (OCONUS).<br/>
<br/>
b.  DoDEA has requested DoD GC to conduct research and report<br/>
concerning current regulations within DoD which might impact on home<br/>
schooling OCONUS.<br/>
<br/>
c.  DoDEA has requested Component Commands, e.g. USAREUR, to conduct<br/>
Home Schooling focus groups and has provided a set of standardized<br/>
questions for those groups.<br/>
<br/>
d.  DoDEA will convene a full HSWG in September (tentative).<br/>
<br/>
(1)  The HSWG will consist of voting and non-voting members:<br/>
<br/>
(a)  The voting members will be comprised of representatives from<br/>
each component command, i.e. USAREUR; U.S. Air Force, Europe (USAFE);<br/>
Marine Forces, Europe (MARFOREUR); Navy, Europe (NAVEUR); Central<br/>
Command (CENTCOM); Marine Forces Pacific (MARFORPAC); U.S. Army,<br/>
Pacific (USARPAC); Eighth U.S. Army (EUSA); Commander in Chief,<br/>
Pacific (CINCPAC), and the Defense Domestic Education School System.<br/>
(DDESS).  Each of the component commands will be permitted to<br/>
designate two voting representatives, one command representative and<br/>
one home schooling parent.  (Only exception will be DDESS with two<br/>
home schooling parents.)<br/>
<br/>
(b)  The non-voting members will be:  DODEA; representatives from<br/>
each CINC (5)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
12 .  It is estimated that this meeting of the full HSWG will take 3-<br/>
4 days. This meeting will be conducted in the Washington, DC area.<br/>
The Home School Defense League of America and other external groups<br/>
will be invited to present.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
13 .  The HSWG will:<br/>
<br/>
a.  Consider the issues identified in paragraph 11 above.<br/>
<br/>
b.  Develop recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
c.  Report out to Director, DoDEA and other DoD officials.<br/>
<br/>
