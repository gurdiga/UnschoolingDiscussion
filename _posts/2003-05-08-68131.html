Heehee...I&#39;m thinking we need a FAQ (or is there one? Whatever...) which has <br/>
these comments about Sandra in it. Then the next time someone comes on <br/>
complaining about the Evil Sandra and her Doddites, we can just say: Read the <br/>
FAQ!<br/>

Well not THAT, but I am collecting testimonials about this list and about the <br/>
unschooling.com forum just about for that purpose!  <br/>
It will go on this page eventually:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>
which is linked through<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/life">http://sandradodd.com/life</a><br/>
where I&#39;m plugging in best-of stories about typical days, and not spanking, <br/>
and (coming soon) letting kids eat or not eat, and... all that good stuff <br/>
that isn&#39;t directly unschooling itself.<br/>

I had worked up more on that second page the other day, but I junked it <br/>
because it was THE ugliest webpage I had ever seen, ever.  TOTALLY pink and <br/>
purple and an embarrassment to color itself, so it&#39;s back to basically the <br/>
flattened earth and some orange construction cones.<br/>
