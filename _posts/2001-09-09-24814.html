<div id="ygrps-yiv-960835615">Before I read any of the day&#39;s (okay the overnight&#39;s) posts, I want to <br/>
pinpoint something we&#39;ve been making big gestures about, but that is really <br/>
smaller and much more profound than the big &quot;whats&quot; and &quot;hows.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling needs positive regard.  It needs sweetness and light.  It needs <br/>
more &quot;yes!&quot; than &quot;NO!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It needs a lot more of &quot;This is so cool&quot; than &quot;This is stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of the worst traits, for me and for my kids, of the schooled kids who <br/>
come over, is the studied negativity and rejection of things--activities, <br/>
toys, games, music--because they&#39;re not &quot;cool.&quot;   Some people move in a cloud <br/>
of disdain, it seems, and not much is going to make them perk up and smile.  <br/>
They don&#39;t want to try new things and they&#39;ve rejected so many things as <br/>
&quot;stupid&quot; that they have precious few options left in the world that they can <br/>
get to without going back on something they&#39;ve declared in the past.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a few homeschooled kids that way.  I&#39;ll tell you what the family <br/>
symptoms are, and I admit it&#39;s a small sample and there could be other <br/>
factors:  They had a mom or a dad who were (in every case I&#39;ve seen) young <br/>
and who still had a big cloud of that negativity themselves.  They hadn&#39;t <br/>
opened up to the infinite possibilities of the universe in any way <br/>
whatsoever.  They were self-conscious about what their friends would think if <br/>
their kids were reading this or that, or wanted their house to look cool with <br/>
all primary-color toys, and so that purple and orange action figure was <br/>
&quot;stupid&quot; (because it didn&#39;t match or because they didn&#39;t want to watch X-men <br/>
or whatever, with their kids, because it was &quot;Stupid&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
To paraphrase Hamlet, there is nothing stupid but thinking makes it so.<br/>
<br/>
If you tell a child something he likes is stupid, you have just started <br/>
digging a chasm between you.  Either he will believe you and have less faith <br/>
in himself, or he will not believe you and have less faith in you.  If it is <br/>
repeated ten or twenty times, he might just stop listening to you.  If it is <br/>
repeated a hundred times, he won&#39;t be able to hear you anymore, or if there <br/>
are physical restraints added, he might purposely look for things you REALLY <br/>
think are stupid, out of spite.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t simply condemn your children and their interests (however minor <br/>
they seems to you) as stupid, there is solid ground between you and you can <br/>
actually communicate your fears and your own prejudices, IF you do it <br/>
respectfully and in full sentences as you would with another adult, <br/>
communications stay open.  And the parent is in a position to learn WHY the <br/>
child really likes that art with the scary-looking dwarf warriors.<br/>
<br/>
When I find myself reacting too flippantly or with an &quot;eeyew!&quot; to something <br/>
new the kids are interested in, I try to get back to them in a day or a few <br/>
with a calm, intelligent question showing that I was paying attention to them <br/>
and requesting more exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has two CDs by a group called Gorrilaz.  It&#39;s foreign and irritating to <br/>
me, and he uses headphones, but sometimes I purposely try to listen calmly <br/>
because it would be better for me to get used to it than for me to reject it. <br/>
 My parents could have totally rejected having any rock&#39;n&#39;roll in the house.  <br/>
They could have told me the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Eric Clapton <br/>
were all stupid, but it would only have served to make me think my parents <br/>
were stupid and narrow minded.   I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t do that.  So I&#39;ve asked <br/>
Marty questions to draw him out to say what he likes about them, but real <br/>
questions like how many are in the group, and when is another CD coming out, <br/>
and do they have videos.  <br/>
<br/>
So I went on too long into real life examples, but the main suggestion is to <br/>
see whether you can improve the &quot;cool&quot; to &quot;dumb&quot; ratio at your house.<br/>
