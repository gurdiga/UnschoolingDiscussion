&lt;&lt;I guess. But what I so often see are very very sorrowful parents who <br/>
feel just horrible when things do go wrong, even if they do think they <br/>
did follow the experts advice and are bewildered by it not &quot;working&quot; <br/>
for them. I&#39;m not sure they are thinking, &quot;It couldn&#39;t be helped,&quot; so <br/>
much as trying to resolve problems the only way they know how - more <br/>
reliance on experts.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see parents who wish they hadn&#39;t followed the experts&#39; advice or let others <br/>
make all the decisions about their children but feel it is too late and <br/>
everything is lost.  I know a lot of parents who feel this way about how public <br/>
school has treated their children.  I see lots of parents who just give up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t see very many relaxed parents.&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Some parents don&#39;t relax *because* they feel that it&#39;s so important to follow <br/>
the experts--and with so many experts out there, all with their own ideas, <br/>
this can be very difficult.  Some parents change their parenting style every <br/>
week in response to the latest fad with lots of fear that if they don&#39;t do this <br/>
they will be ruining their child. <br/>
<br/>
I feel that the worst result of reliance on experts is when a parent decides <br/>
that the reason it hasn&#39;t worked must be that their child is just bad.  <br/>
