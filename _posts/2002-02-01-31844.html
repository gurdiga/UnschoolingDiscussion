I think you are wonderful and your suggestions to resolve the mess here....I<br/>
applaud your efforts and find you to alway be clear and thoughtful in your<br/>
contributions.  I do think the general guidelines are fine the way they are,<br/>
though I hope list members will take your advice and let&#39;s move past this.<br/>
    The only messages here lately have been on this (business of the<br/>
list)....and I hope it enables us to move on.....but I&#39;m aching for some<br/>
really mind opening discussion....and would like to move on to that.<br/>
    I know there are other lists having them......my favorites are SO<br/>
cacophonous and have an abundance of prolific writers.....and I am not able<br/>
to keep up enough at this point to contribute there.  I was hoping this list<br/>
I could keep up with and contribute to regularly.<br/>
  I&#39;m gonna throw some things out and see what happens.<br/>

&gt; moderating and policing people is not something Helen is interested in for<br/>
&gt; this list, nor do I suspect anyone is. These guidelines will not please<br/>
&gt; everyone, but will hopefully encourage people to think a bit before<br/>
