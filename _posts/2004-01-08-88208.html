<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379398138">I was just at the webpage for the Conference next August refreshing my memory of the cost so that I can plan for it...and as I reread through everything, I picked up on the fact that there will be a Talent Show. Is this just for the children or is it anyone who&#39;d like to perform? <br/>
 <br/>
I just had a good conversation with Sarah. Right away when I told her about it she got excited and started yammering about dancing or something, but she&#39;s NOT a dancer. I said that I didn&#39;t think dancing would be a good idea, and she started to get upset. I said &quot;Now hold on. I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t be in the talent show. I know you just want to show everyone how special you are. But when do you really dance? Would that really be the best way to show your special-ness? What might be a really really good way to show that?&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
We thought for a couple minutes about just what she likes to do and I remembered how much she enjoys memorizing her Bible verses for AWANAs. She has a great memory, and enjoys being on stage as well. She has been in a production of &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; and a couple of small skits through our church. So I suggested that she memorize and recite a poem or something. She&#39;s very excited about the opportunity, and so am I. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s exciting to watch her beginning to blossom with this aspect of herself..the acting/reciting part. She&#39;s always had a great imagination and ability to fully immerse herself in &quot;playing pretend.&quot; I didn&#39;t become interested in theater until high school, my thing was always just music. But I do enjoy it. <br/>

It&#39;s not a competition.<br/>
It&#39;s not a stock show.<br/>
Let her dance if she wants to!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a sharing of interests and &quot;ta-daa!&quot; opportunity to show something the <br/>
person thinks is cool.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t just for kids last year.  I wish there had been more adults in it, <br/>
but there were a few.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871290220">I realize that it&#39;s not a competition, just for the fun of it. But she doesn&#39;t dance. She&#39;d be up on stage with music just moving around..it&#39;d be embarassing. Ok..maybe not for her, but it would for me. And while maybe not for her...I doubt she&#39;d come off the stage and nobody have laughed at her. People can be cruel and no offense but I don&#39;t know a darn person who would be there. You can tell me that nobody there would do that...but how do I really know that?<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t remind her of the way she was teased at a dance she went to, where I just let her go and do her own thing like she had just talk about doing. She was hurt, and I hurt for her. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll think about it some more though.But I&#39;d rather she slow down and really look at all of the possibilities of what she can do, and do well, rather than doing something simply for the sake of doing something which is where I think this idea came from. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488336001">I have to say that the one thing I loved about the Live and Learn Conference,, well not the only thing, but the way everyone just respects their children and everyone elses too.  It was a lovely talent show.  If I could go which I&#39;m not sure I can (and we are disappointed) I would get up and do something for the talent show this year, maybe dance ( I can&#39;t) or sing Yikes!  Seriously, Let her dance, it would be such a blessing!  I remember the juggling act... so wonderful.  Stepheny<br/>

I can&#39;t tell you that nobody there would do that.<br/>
<br/>
You can only REALLY know what you&#39;ve experienced and thought about and tried <br/>
to understand, and if you&#39;ve experienced people telling other people not to <br/>
dance, that&#39;s a kind of negativity you need to avoid.  And if you&#39;re the one <br/>
bringing that into the situation, try to stop doing it.   <br/>
<br/>
One of the worst obstacles to unschooling working is that cynicism and <br/>
negativity that discourages people from trying things, or makes fun of them when <br/>
they do try.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not common among unschooling families.   The conference is not likely to <br/>
have much, if any, of that attitude.<br/>
