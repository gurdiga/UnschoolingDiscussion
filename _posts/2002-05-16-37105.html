&lt;&lt; once he spotted that TV picture, it was<br/>
like there was nothing else in the room.  No matter what else happened for<br/>
the next five minutes, he would not take his eyes off that screen. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the way it will be whenever he&#39;s learning something new and <br/>
fascinating.  I hope you don&#39;t take away everything he ever gets excited <br/>
about because he&#39;s not paying attention to you for that time.<br/>
<br/>
Someday he won&#39;t hear you talk to him because he&#39;ll be engrossed in a game or <br/>
a book.  I hope you don&#39;t say &quot;I know all I need to know&quot; and take that thing <br/>
away from him for the rest of his life.  (Oh. You only have the rest of his <br/>
childhood.  He&#39;ll make his own decisions for most of his life.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have since noticed this in other children when at friends&#39; houses -- the<br/>
kids barely even acknowledge that you&#39;re there, they can&#39;t take their eyes<br/>
off the screen, and basically seem hypnotized.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably they were watching something really interesting.  If it&#39;s recorded, <br/>
they can pause it without missing dialog, or rewind it.  It would be a shame <br/>
if books couldn&#39;t be closed and picked up later, but they can, and always <br/>
have had that &quot;pause&quot; feature. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

This is why I want to get one of the new systems that lets you pause even<br/>
live broadcasts.  Very cool!<br/>
