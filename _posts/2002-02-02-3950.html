 </span></blockquote>Dylan says the coolest thing is the piano.  He really loved my moms so<br/>
when he was four we found a nice old one, not too expensive, and brought<br/>
it home.  We lived in such a little house we had to put the sofa in the<br/>
back of the truck to fit the piano in the living room.  Dylan loved it. <br/>
He&#39;s taken lessons on and off, when we found nice teachers and could<br/>
afford it.  He plays everyday still and he&#39;s nine now.  <br/>
<br/>
He still really loves a lap harp we found at a second hand store. <br/>
He loves his kicking bag and tumbling mat.  The tumbling mat doubles as a<br/>
sky watching mat.  <br/>
He loves the Playstation.<br/>
Lego&#39;s.<br/>
When vector control was selling off their old equipment and getting new,<br/>
his uncle bought him a very nice, used microscope.  This is really<br/>
wonderful.  He uses it at least once a day, to look at rocks especially. <br/>
It sits permanently on the dining room table with egg cartons of rocks<br/>
and minerals and petrified wood.  <br/>
He loves maps. <br/>
Paints and drawing stuff.<br/>
Books.<br/>
Yatzeeh, Set, Cribbage and Mancalla.<br/>
Puzzles and math puzzle books and maze books.<br/>
Stuffed animals.<br/>
The quilt my mom made when he was born.<br/>
Boxes.  He likes to put stuff in boxes.  When he&#39;s older I know he&#39;ll<br/>
want a truck so he can *haul* stuff around.  <br/>
He collects six pack rings, used dryer sheets  and screwdriver bits.  I<br/>
can&#39;t even begin to tell you why.  <br/>
He has some bugs he keeps in my butter dish who died of natural causes.<br/>
(as far as we could tell )  <br/>
Godzilla movies and Godzilla toys.  <br/>
Anything morbid.  He has a replica skull.  Some sticky internal organs. <br/>
Some severed body parts.  Some squishy eyeballs.  <br/>
<br/>
This is just some of his favorite cool stuff.<br/>

There is a company that makes Jello molds in the shape of internal organs.<br/>
These went over great at various nursing school lunches!<br/>
I don&#39;t have a website but I bet if you serched google for Jello/Gelatin<br/>
Brain Molds youd get hits!<br/>
<br/>
Elissa, who will soon be singing<br/>
Yippee - Kai - Yay!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe your girls aren&#39;t into gross but we look at dog hair, bird feathers<br/>
( those aren&#39;t gross )  saliva, fingernails, milk or cheese or such<br/>
that&#39;s been setting out a while,  leaves ( leaves are cool, you can soak<br/>
them in water and remove their pigment then look at the structure<br/>
underneath )  dead houseflies.  Insects are very interesting but for the<br/>
sake of all bug everywhere don&#39;t kill them just to look at them, find<br/>
volunteers.  Dirt is cool.  Dirt from different places will have<br/>
different stuff in it.  Leave a bucket of water outside and see what<br/>
grows in it.  Mosquito larvae are very squirmy.  If you live by a pond or<br/>
stream that&#39;s even better. <br/>
Fabric can be really interesting and different kinds of paper and even<br/>
pictures from magazines.  <br/>
If they like make up that might be cool.  I&#39;ve never looked, but I hear<br/>
lipstick has fish scales in it ( is that true?)  so you could go on a<br/>
fish scale hunt.  ( can you se them?)  THAT&#39;S gross! <br/>
Carolina Biological supply has a cool forensics kit, it&#39;s classroom size,<br/>
but when I asked them to they sold us a scaled down version.  Edmund<br/>
Scientific has really nice prepared slides.  Well, the textile slides<br/>
are, anyway.  <br/>
Moldy bread is cool.  We find neat stuff when I clean out the &#39;fridge.  <br/>
Yeast is fun.  ( bread yeast that is )<br/>
Fruit. <br/>
Maybe raw meat?  I never looked at that either.  eeew.<br/>
We had a friend send us snake skins and BIG bugs from Arkansas.<br/>
