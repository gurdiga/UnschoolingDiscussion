<div id="ygrps-yiv-903694026">welcome cathy. so awesome for your daughter exploring with confidence! your kids sound like very rational thinkers!<br/>
<br/>
ok my question....WHY do people think christians aren&#39;t able to unschool? i came upon &quot;unschooling&quot; naturally.....meaning i did not &quot;know&quot; there was an actual term for it nor books written about it,or a whole movement shall i say. i still have not read any holt books,nor any other &quot;unschooling&quot; books either, actually just a few snips here and there on the net. i just realized shortly after i started homeschooling (7 years ago) what wasn&#39;t working for my son (only one at the time) and realized if i backed off he will naturally learn when he&#39;s ready. i then heard the term once as i was at a park day with other hs moms and someone asked me about what curriculum do we use. ehhh none. oh so your an unschooler eh? a wha? haha so i googled it and read a few bits LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
so yeah anyhow i&#39;m curious! i am a christian and know a few others locally that are as well but i&#39;ve never heard we &quot;can&#39;t&quot; nor too much criticism from other c&#39;s. so i curiously wonder why it would be said?  enlighten me please.<br/>

<br/>
  Hello Everyone<br/>
<br/>
  I am new to the list so I will introduce myself before butting in!!<br/>
<br/>
  I live in the UK, have 5 children ages 17,14,12,10 and 5. We were always<br/>
  relaxed/delight-directed homeschoolers, but after reading John Holt&#39;s &#39;How<br/>
  Children Learn&#39; and &#39;How Children Fail&#39; in 2000, (and lurking for a while on<br/>
  Sandra&#39;s radical unschooling list where everyone was frolicking in the deep<br/>
  end of the ocean, so it gave me confidence to think &#39;hey, let&#39;s test the<br/>
  water here on the shallow end.), we took the plunge into unschooling and we<br/>
  have never looked back. Of course, it is a constant and challenging learning<br/>
  experience for me here in highly structured, hyper-testing orientated,<br/>
  conservative England, and I mess up a lot of the time, but the kids are<br/>
  great - so patient when they remind me that it is supposed to be their<br/>
  choice.. Back off mom, we know what we need.<br/>
<br/>
  My oldest daughter is now in South Africa, where she is the youngest<br/>
  aspirant dancer of her ballet company, and where people are constantly<br/>
  amazed that a 17 year old is so sure of what she wants and is so<br/>
  self-disciplined and self-directed, and is able to live so far from her<br/>
  family without falling apart.<br/>
<br/>
  Second daughter is constantly mistaken for an 18 year old - again because<br/>
  she is so confident and sure of herself, and of her goals and objectives. <br/>
<br/>
  They alone are sufficient evidence for me that unschooling really really<br/>
  really works! I tell people everywhere, and I love seeing them spend time<br/>
  with us and gradually become more relaxed and laid back in their home<br/>
  education, even if they continue to follow their precious curriculum guides!<br/>
<br/>
  We are Christians, and at times we get a lot of criticism, as many<br/>
  Christians feel that you cannot be both a Christian and an unschooler.<br/>
  Interestingly, many unschoolers also think so. I was so convinced by John<br/>
  Holt&#39;s writings that I determined to confront this perception - for myself<br/>
  and for my family. And ultimately for other people who would like to know.<br/>
  It is a wonderful journey.<br/>
<br/>
  With regard to the TV issue, you may be amused to hear that in our family it<br/>
  was daughter 2 who most strongly voted for us not to have one in our home<br/>
  right now. We keep horses, and we do all the care ourselves. She is the<br/>
  owner of three of the horses, so she has soooo much work to do every day. We<br/>
  live on a small farm and there are always tasks to accomplish. Her concern<br/>
  was that, even if we only watched 1 hour of TV per day, it would add up to 7<br/>
  hours/week - which is almost a full day&#39;s work!!!! What a dreadful waste of<br/>
  time when we don&#39;t ever have enough time in the week to get everything done<br/>
  that we want to do as it is. (she has visions of losing all her slave<br/>
  labour!!!!) Everyone, except poor hubby - who wanted Sky TV so that he could<br/>
  watch the sport - was won over by her argument and agreed! Thus a decision<br/>
  has been made and the TV issue is to be reviewed again in a few months time.<br/>
<br/>
  One question that does come up regularly is to do with being part of and<br/>
  relevant to our society - TV is a useful way of keeping some sort of track<br/>
  of what is considered important at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
  A concern that I have is that I don&#39;t really want my 5 year old hearing<br/>
  about all the gory bits of what paedophile/sex murderer/whoever got up to.<br/>
  The BBC delights in hashing and rehashing these kinds of news items. Most<br/>
  recently an English 3 year old was stolen from the bedroom in which she was<br/>
  sleeping - taken out of her bed by some swine who climbed in through the<br/>
  window. She hasn&#39;t been found yet. I feel sick myself at the thought, and I<br/>
  don&#39;t think Kate needs to know about that right now. I would like her to<br/>
  experience her world as a wonderful safe place, at least for these few short<br/>
  sweet years of early childhood. <br/>
<br/>
  Dear son, who is very aware of what money can buy, said that a SKY TV<br/>
  subscription would not be the best use of our funds. He felt that we were<br/>
  better off continuing to have the money available to buy whatever we are<br/>
  interested in at the time (currently it is beading, so we are always buying<br/>
  beads). <br/>
<br/>
  We all enjoy watching TV a bit when we are on holiday, but on the whole we<br/>
  are not majorly impressed by most of the programming - about 80% of it we<br/>
  can skip. I think I can honestly say that none of us feels like we are<br/>
  missing out. <br/>
<br/>
  What we did instead was buy a digital projector so that we could set up big<br/>
  screen media in the lounge, and we have a subscription to hire DVD&#39;s and we<br/>
  also buy quite a lot of DVD&#39;s. If anyone wants to watch something, it goes<br/>
  on the list and we get it. We also like hooking the computer onto the<br/>
  digital projector and messing around on the internet together. Finally, the<br/>
  kids also go through intense stages where they love playing racing games on<br/>
  the playstation (again on the big screen), although I really DO think that<br/>
  this is one huge waste of time - and what is more, it makes me seasick to<br/>
  watch!!!~! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235207006">Hi Emmy<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Over the years I have been told (in various ways and in various forms) that:<br/>
<br/>
*	Unschooling is humanism and John Holt was a humanist, and we should<br/>
therefore have nothing to do with him or his philosophies<br/>
*	In order to unschool you have to compromise on Christian principles<br/>
*	Unschoolers do not follow the Biblical mandate to train up their<br/>
children in God&#39;s ways<br/>
*	Christians must teach their children to submit to authority by<br/>
making them obey<br/>
*	It is wrong to allow people to do what they want - not good for<br/>
their character<br/>
*	Unschooling does not equip people for life in the real world where<br/>
we have to submit to others<br/>
*	Unschooling is selfish <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have also been told that:<br/>
<br/>
*	Christianity is too rigid and structured a religion to allow for<br/>
unschooling<br/>
*	Unschooling means freedom, and thus Christians would not be able to<br/>
follow it as they are bound by their Scriptures<br/>
*	A Christian&#39;s understanding of being accountable to God will prevent<br/>
them unschooling fully<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Most people who had an issue - and these are the ones who used to get under<br/>
my skin and make me cross - just had an issue. Didn&#39;t want to talk about it;<br/>
didn&#39;t want to discuss it, just KNEW I was wrong. Now I ignore those kinds<br/>
of people and stick to fruitful conversations with people, no matter how<br/>
structured, who respect me enough to really want to know why I don&#39;t agree<br/>
with the above statements, or in what way I don&#39;t agree with them. I don&#39;t<br/>
care if they end up not agreeing with me in the end if at least they will<br/>
consider my ideas!!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have realized that so many people are just so scared. They are afraid of<br/>
messing up in some way. It takes so much courage to trust God, your kids,<br/>
yourself. Far easier on the surface to stick to accepted protocol.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have discovered that all the above ideas are JUST NOT TRUE!!! And that<br/>
when Jesus Christ said that He came to give life, and life more abundantly,<br/>
He meant what He said. Paul said that it was for freedom that Christ had set<br/>
us free, and that we should not again allow ourselves to be bound by a yoke<br/>
of slavery. He was talking about slavish application of Judaic law. I see<br/>
parallels here too. Following rules and regulations makes people feel safe,<br/>
as they then can fool themselves that they are no longer responsible for<br/>
their actions. Ho hum..<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In our family we unanimously agree to live as Christians, to copy the<br/>
example set for us by Jesus, and to follow the teachings of the Bible. This<br/>
is like a huge, overriding rainbow, under which we revel and delight in the<br/>
beauty of our lives. The picture that means the most to me is of a huge,<br/>
rich, delightful pasture, surrounded by a secure boundary fence. But the<br/>
pasture is HUGE and the boundary fence is not restrictive at all. In fact,<br/>
there is more freedom than we ever realized, and one goes deeper and deeper<br/>
into it. Using this picture has enabled me to speak about unschooling in<br/>
conservative Christian contexts and be heard.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t experience conflict between the two philosophies, and so if some<br/>
think that that means we compromise, I suppose that is just tough. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have been so excited and so grateful for the discoveries I have made, and<br/>
John Holt is my hero! I have read all his books and my copies are underlined<br/>
and scribbled in and I still don&#39;t feel I understand enough to leave them on<br/>
the shelf. And yet it has become normal to live this way, so much so that it<br/>
feels strange to think back on the days when I was asking &#39;Can a Christian<br/>
be an unschooler?&#39; and &#39;Can an unschooler be a Christian?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A tough question that I sometimes ask (I tend to put myself through the mill<br/>
on stuff) is how would I react if one of my kids didn&#39;t want to be a<br/>
Christian anymore. I have to admit that that would be very tough for me, and<br/>
that it is important to me that my kids love Jesus and have their own<br/>
relationship with Him. I also know though that I would have to find the<br/>
grace somewhere to let them be - because I couldn&#39;t do otherwise and still<br/>
be true to myself. This does not mean that I would not have the right to<br/>
debate the subject furiously with them if they were willing to do so though.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am about to leave for one of Kelly Marks &#39;Intelligent Horsemanship&#39; demos,<br/>
and I am starting to run late, so I had better go. I hope I have expressed<br/>
my thoughts clearly and also that I have not stood on anyone&#39;s toes!!!!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056489319">-=-* Christians must teach their children to submit to authority by<br/>
making them obey-=-<br/>
<br/>
Many Christian parents justify their over-controlling limitations on  <br/>
kids, and their punishments, by saying God commanded them to do that,  <br/>
and they&#39;re just being good Christians, just saving their children&#39;s  <br/>
souls.<br/>
<br/>
Because they&#39;ve told their children this (and blamed God), it&#39;s a  <br/>
SERIOUS danger to peace in their lives if another Christian family is  <br/>
having fun and freedom.  Their kids might question the state of their  <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s parallel to the threat to families that require lots of homework  <br/>
and good grades and limit TV and video games and any sort of fun,  <br/>
because school  is IT, and they &quot;have to&quot; support the school, and  <br/>
they&#39;re just saving their children&#39;s GPAs to ensure their financial  <br/>
future.  (Only that &quot;god&quot; is money/success.)<br/>

ed&#39; when he still socialised regularly with some of the children he <br/>
went to school with.<br/>
<br/>
When my son and I started out on our adventure, we had a three hour a <br/>
day lesson plan that he&#39;d negotiated with his parents as a <br/>
requirement for being taken out of school. That lasted about a week <br/>
and a half; then my son said &quot;I don&#39;t want to do this&quot; and I said &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t want to do it either&quot; and that was that. Ever since, our home <br/>
ed has been totally improvisational.<br/>
<br/>
One day a few months later, one of my son&#39;s ex-schoolmates came over <br/>
to play after school. At one point, I overheard him telling my son <br/>
that he&#39;d had a really good day at school because he&#39;d finished his <br/>
work early and his teacher had allowed him to have an extra ten <br/>
minutes of free play time. &quot;Crikey&quot;, I thought, &quot;I&#39;d better not <br/>
mention that Pat and I have spent most of the day playing videogames <br/>
and watching cartoons&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, indeed. If more schoolchildren knew the truth about what home <br/>
education can be, their parents might have to re-examine their <br/>
beliefs about a lot of things.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Christian anymore.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it is very wise for you to be open to thinking about these things<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
In our family of 6, it is darned difficult to find unanimous agreement for<br/>
many concepts outside of principles of treating each other well, treating<br/>
each other&#39;s things well (or asking before touching another&#39;s things), and<br/>
respectful behavior in general. Outside of that, our kids have branched out<br/>
into their own ideas about life, god, Jesus, Buddha, etc. I&#39;m rather happy<br/>
with the lack of UNanimousness, lol.<br/>
<br/>
When looking at religious unschooling, I wonder about the effect of daily<br/>
sharing of adult strong convictions and beliefs in a family. I find my own<br/>
sharing of my beliefs with my kids comes into play in our discussions only<br/>
occasionally. I spend much of my time listening to my kids&#39; thoughts and<br/>
processes, supporting their explorations, working to understand their<br/>
ideas...I try not to give my own ideas too much, mostly when it is clear<br/>
that they are asking for it. Listening to their insights and supporting<br/>
their explorations has been key for us in freedom and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the idea that religion can feel like the core of one&#39;s life,<br/>
and that it could be quite difficult not to share the wonders of it with<br/>
one&#39;s children daily. But I do wonder the effect on their true freedom. I&#39;m<br/>
not trying to be antagonistic, but this is sort of the crux of the religious<br/>
unschooling question in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if I may ask, I am curious how each one of your family members<br/>
came to unanimously agree to live as Christians. How old are your kids? When<br/>
they are younger, parents really do get to make decisions without much<br/>
question or disagreement. Maybe that is where your family is? Or maybe they<br/>
have been exposed to the many possibilities with openness, and they have<br/>
chosen Christianity for their lives?<br/>
<br/>
The religious unschooling is a little like the strong convictions about<br/>
TV/computers/video games being harmful and damaging in unschooling in my<br/>
mind, and maybe I am offbase with that thinking. Having doctrine in my home<br/>
about anything, be it following commandments created thousands of years ago<br/>
or espousing the evils of video games would impinge on my kids true freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is very good in unschooling to question what I would do if one or<br/>
more of my kids chose a path that I strongly disagreed with. First question:<br/>
WHY do I disagree? That is my issue to resolve. My disagreement will surely<br/>
get in the way of our relationship. Short of choosing a path of murder or<br/>
mayhem, there shouldn&#39;t be all that much that I couldn&#39;t support in my<br/>
children&#39;s choices.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the questions that come to me when I think of incorporating one<br/>
religion in an unschooling family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421282024">This is my response to the question about whether you can be a<br/>
Christian and also be an unschooler. If you would allow me to share my<br/>
experience & thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
We are a Christian family of 6 who do not attend a church, but my DH<br/>
and I are Christians- in the sense that we do believe God created the<br/>
world and provided redemption through Jesus (I know that sounds<br/>
horribly religious, but basically we believe the bible to be God&#39;s<br/>
Word and His will).<br/>
 <br/>
Now we spent the better part of our marriage, now in it&#39;s 13th year,<br/>
attending church, serving there, talking about and teaching our<br/>
children about God and making our decisions based on what we thought<br/>
was correct according to the bible or traditional thought. We no<br/>
longer attend church and have ceased stressing the bible so urgently<br/>
in our home. <br/>
<br/>
We do talk a lot about a responsibility to love one another and do<br/>
what is right- for the betterment of us as individuals and a family &<br/>
in order to help others achieve better. We speak a lot of social<br/>
injustices, politics, the FDA, the war, corruption, morality without<br/>
judgment and honesty. The interesting thing is that since we have<br/>
discontinued the &quot;training&quot; our children they really do not talk much<br/>
about biblical things as they used to. Prior to that I think the kids<br/>
would talk more about things related to church and the bible because<br/>
it was what we were stressing. Duh... kids will mimic and aim to<br/>
please those in which they fear an opinion! I really don&#39;t want the<br/>
kids to mimic me- i do want to be the best I can be, but I always tell<br/>
them I want them to be and do better. <br/>
<br/>
When the discussion of things that may pertain to religion or the such<br/>
come up I allow them to voice their opinion without forcing mine. God<br/>
is a part of our lives as is everything. To many religious people that<br/>
might seem as if  we have done our kids a disservice and that they<br/>
will not grow up Godly because of our so called neglectfulnesses to<br/>
the Word. We now see how we were not fully using our own brains on<br/>
many issues and thanks to our own enlightenment (in which I personally<br/>
thank God- cause I am a bit of a thickhead!) we are allowing our kids<br/>
to learn without outside pressure. <br/>
<br/>
We  have begun the unschooling process in ourselves. We have begun<br/>
questioning things and in so doing allowing our kids to think & learn<br/>
freely, even on this topic. My relationship with God is my<br/>
relationship and I now realize it to be rude and frankly unnecessary<br/>
to force that down anyone&#39;s throats. I see that verse about &quot;training<br/>
up your children&quot; quite differently. I feel what that truly means is<br/>
to support and allow your kids to go in the way they know (within<br/>
their hearts) and they will succeed- which is supportive of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
 I am not worried or concerned about my children following God or<br/>
Christianity per say because I know it is a choice everyone must make<br/>
on their own. Without manipulation, perhaps they will truly experience<br/>
God&#39;s love for them and mankind. Our decision to step away from church<br/>
and indoctrination was also a decision to decide to find out for<br/>
ourselves what God really is to me. What I have found is that He is<br/>
not confined to our limited ideas of Him and He is wonderfully vast<br/>
and loving and kind. I will not use fear of any kind to cause my kids<br/>
to conform and I will fight everyone and everything that tries to do so. <br/>
<br/>
So it is possible to be a Christian and unschool. Never anywhere have<br/>
I found support for coercion, manipulation (may I say slavery!) in the<br/>
Bible. Why would anyone willingly choose to be led and controlled? I<br/>
decided to stand up for myself and trust my own heart and my primary<br/>
motivation is to entrust my kids to do the same. So far it&#39;s working. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799976052">thank you all for sharing! i find that interesting, and yes now i can see where those who view God only as taking away freedom (ie the law and such) would not get it. i live in such freedom that i often &quot;forget&quot; others are bound by their (most often self inflicted )limits and fear. i agree with sandra that truly comes down to the way man(kind) sees to enforce &quot;Gods way&quot;. (and whats even worse if we don&#39;t conform to that standard then we don&#39;t fit the &quot;right way&quot;!!)  <br/>
<br/>
MAN i know God as the first & ultimate unschooler! he gives us the freedom to explore His world, His creations,our relationship with him and nutures us right along in FREEDOM! INCLUDING the _choice_ to chose to believe in & follow Him or NOT.  i think of this in relation to what bob said <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, indeed. If more schoolchildren knew the truth about what home <br/>
education can be, their parents might have to re-examine their <br/>
beliefs about a lot of things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
the truth is if one is truly intimate with God then one will know his character and principles is NOT about limits or control. yes there are guidelines yet they are simply for protection to accompany us on our learning journey,which He longs to be a part of! JUST like that role we play as an (unschooling) parent!  we nurture our relationship with our children and their journey of learning, because we love them, and because we love them we spend TIME with them and desire the fullest life for them by seeking their interests! it is our job as parents to protect them i mean _hello_ we don&#39;t want our kids to play in a busy highway because obviously its dangerous territory!  anyhow He&#39;s ALL about freedom and i think its been the best kept secret! LOL  He paid the price to SET us FREE, to encourage our dreams,to elevate and give the desires of OUR hearts. its NOT a one way street!! once your liberated by seeing what God&#39;s freedom brings,wow the whole world opens up!  it really so simple yet sooo many complicate it. yes if indeed the truth be known.<br/>
<br/>
i appreciate your honesty cathy about your fear. my sons are only 12 & 8. they truly made their own choice for their relationship with God each in their _own_ time. when they shared it with me, it was a beautiful moment knowing it was THEIR choice, and their relationship with God. they will have a different experience than i, because we are after all unique individuals. if they chose not to have a relationship with God later in their years that would be very hard yes, but i would have to respect their choice. <br/>
<br/>
which reminds me we were recently discussing this very subject. i can&#39;t remember exactly what triggered the conversation but during it i made a comment to my son that not everybody worships/believes in jesus and we have to respect that. he (my youngest) who is so very sensative and intimate with God (by which he most often teaches & humbles ME! LOL) was very passionately upset and asked &quot;WHY _wouldn&#39;t_ people believe in jesus, thats just stupid!! don&#39;t they know how awesome He is!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
i see many parents constantly make the mistake to &quot;shove&quot; their beliefs onto their kids, only to see them rebel and then wonder why?  sometimes the child comes back to these beliefs but its usually after they&#39;ve had the freedom to explore the &quot;world&quot; yet unfortunately it caused much hurt to their (parent/child) relationship in the process. i encourage parents if you give them that freedom in the first place, you will avoid the hurt and be respected more. it all comes down to their choice, & their free will. what will be, will be....truly what do we control?? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129014569">Hi Jacki<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your excellent questions. Lots to consider there.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One thought that comes immediately to mind is this one: which principle (or<br/>
maybe &#39;philosophy&#39; is the better word) is going to take precedence? If<br/>
Unschooling is first, then I will &#39;compromise&#39; on religious belief to be<br/>
true to it. Alternatively, if my religion is first, then I will &#39;compromise&#39;<br/>
on Unschooling to be true to it. The reason I put the word &#39;compromise&#39; in<br/>
inverted commas is that I think that there is a way of looking at two<br/>
different philosophies and yet finding commonality in them. For example, for<br/>
me, freedom and respect for the personhood of a person, are very important<br/>
values. I find expression of and support for freedom and respect in both<br/>
Unschooling and Christianity. Hence the idea that it is possible to live as<br/>
a Christian Unschooling family. Yeeha! Thrashing out the reality is another<br/>
matter. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If it comes down to brass tacks and I felt pushed into a stalemate where I<br/>
had to choose between the two, Christianity comes first. This is because<br/>
there is a sense of allegiance to Jesus as a living Lord, to Whom I have<br/>
freely given my life, so in that way my choices are now limited. In much the<br/>
same way as my choices were limited after my marriage to my husband in a way<br/>
that they weren&#39;t when I was single.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So yes, my children are growing up in an overtly Christian home. But no, I<br/>
don&#39;t think they are feeling coerced (actually I asked 2 of them and they<br/>
looked at me as if I was crazy). The funny thing is that my oldest daughter<br/>
said that she sometimes feels coerced by my strong feelings about education!<br/>
She doesn&#39;t feel like I give her freedom to choose a different path on that<br/>
one, and she says that in retrospect maybe she would have preferred to have<br/>
been schooled. Now that is a real curved ball!!!! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Many families as an ideal prefer to leave the options open for their<br/>
children on all things. But can any of us honestly say that we do not<br/>
influence our children in the context of our family culture? We have an<br/>
identity as a family after all. I don&#39;t think this is wrong. But where I do<br/>
think there is potential to go wrong is when we don&#39;t leave the option for a<br/>
particular member of the family to be different - on any issue, be it<br/>
something as important as religion or environmental responsibility or<br/>
something as seemingly unimportant as foods to eat, clothes to wear and<br/>
choice of music. And we must recognize the subtle ways as well as the overt<br/>
ways of getting people to do what we want, rather than respecting their<br/>
freedom to choose.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Christianity makes sense to me. So does Unschooling. The challenge lies in<br/>
how to implement the concepts. All around me are people, in many cases<br/>
implementing one or another of the concepts dear to me. But maybe I don&#39;t<br/>
agree with their implementation. Or maybe I try to implement something, but<br/>
in a very short while I can see that it does not work. It is back to the<br/>
drawing board. Honest, rueful, apologetic assessment of where it went wrong.<br/>
The principle however remains. I am challenged to return again to the<br/>
principle - study and consider and investigate ways that work.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
<br/>
