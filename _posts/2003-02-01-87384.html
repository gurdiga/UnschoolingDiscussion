<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319121920">Well, some of my new year&#39;s resolutions are directly from this board.<br/>
<br/>
Today, we switched the kids&#39; beds today: gave the loft bed to Sam and put <br/>
the double bed back in the girls&#39; room, since they were sleeping together <br/>
on the top anyway. The girls had wanted the loft bed, but it ended up not <br/>
really suiting their needs like we all thought it would. They like to sleep <br/>
together, so they might as well have more room in which to do it! The <br/>
co-sleeping thread gave me that idea.<br/>
<br/>
The other day (dh drove up to NJ for a funeral while we stayed home sick), <br/>
I cleared out Sam&#39;s closet, yanked down the hanging rod and painted the <br/>
whole thing. I painted a rescue hero border around the bottom and moved one <br/>
of the HUGE Rescue Hero Command Centers that the kids got for xmas up <br/>
there, giving him a whole new play space in his 9x9 room. Dh raised the <br/>
hanging stuff so it&#39;s out of the way, and now there&#39;s no wasted space up at <br/>
the top of the closet. Sam has a whole new room!<br/>
<br/>
I also officially moved all the art stuff (that had been trickling its way <br/>
up anyway) upstairs to a cleared-out kitchen cabinet. The kids were so <br/>
excited! We bought a really great kitchen table from IKEA about 18 mos. <br/>
ago, and that&#39;s where do most of our projects anyway. Now, we don&#39;t have to <br/>
drag stuff back and forth. I&#39;d already moved all our board games up about a <br/>
month ago, and that&#39;s been super too. I think re-organizing works in much <br/>
the same way as rotating--makes everything new again.<br/>
<br/>
This move cleared out a bunch of space to put up shelving and begin <br/>
shifting the kids&#39; clothes storage to the laundry room. Thank you, Lyle! <br/>
The kids are excited about having drawer space for more important things <br/>
like barbies and doll stuff, and I&#39;m excited about making laundry easier <br/>
and creating some more room in the family room! Right now, I&#39;m trying to <br/>
decide what kind of shelving would work best. I&#39;m thinking about that <br/>
typical white wire shelving, but I&#39;m concerned that clothes will just spill <br/>
off the shelves as the kids dig for the pants that they want to wear, know <br/>
what I mean? Lyle--what do you use to contain your clothes? Drawers have <br/>
sides, so things can be all a jumble without spilling out, but shelves <br/>
don&#39;t have this.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling very productive and ready to take on a whole new year! Thanks for <br/>
all the great ideas and for challenging me to think more critically!  Happy <br/>
new year everyone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357281873">I&#39;m a long time  homeschooler but a fairly recent unschooler partly due to a <br/>
spur-of-the-moment trip to the Live and Learn Conference this past year.  I&#39;ve <br/>
spent the past few months reading from this list and the Unschooling.com <br/>
message boards while I practiced  letting go.  Our lives, which include my <br/>
husband, 14 year old daughter and 10 year old son,<br/>
have become much more joyful and I truly could write all day about the <br/>
moments that have left me in awe. It has been both personal enriching as well as a <br/>
positive change in our family.<br/>
<br/>
At our New Years celebration last night,  which was a collection of <br/>
neighborhood children from ages 9-17, my daughter had everyone write their New Year&#39;s <br/>
resolutions and then she put them in a can and all the kids had a ceremonial <br/>
burning of the lists in the middle of our cul-de-sac. We always have had a <br/>
&quot;burning of the Christmas lists&quot; for Santa which helps to make the wishes or in <br/>
this case &quot;resolutions&quot; come true.   One of my resolutions that I put in the can <br/>
was to &quot;unschool passionately&quot;.  Until now I have consciously worked on <br/>
stepping back and not being so controlling.  It has been quite an adjustment for me. <br/>
 One amusing moment of my &quot;metamorphosis&quot; was during the holidays when my <br/>
ex-husand was visiting.  He and Logan (our son) were playing Legos in Logan&#39;s   <br/>
bedroom.  This is a bedroom that used to be immaculate on a daily basis because <br/>
of my &quot;job list&quot;.  That list and all my other &quot;to do&quot; lists are long gone and <br/>
the result is a boy&#39;s room filled with wonderful lego creations, partial <br/>
electronic creations, and no visible floor space.  I peeked in to say hello and <br/>
said...&quot;I am so happy with this room!&quot;<br/>
I meant it and my ex-husband just looked at me like I had completely lost my <br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
I would love some feedback of &quot;Favorite Strewing&quot; ideas.<br/>
I have many ideas for younger children but with a 10 and 14 year old this <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem as easy.  The magnet bucket that Sandra talked about is a great one <br/>
and our magnet box has been a continuous popular item for many years as well <br/>
as rotating jigsaw puzzles.  We often play board games but I would love more <br/>
ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  And Happy New Year,<br/>

<br/>
Just before I read this post, I had gone in to sit in Marty&#39;s room a while <br/>
and watch him play a video game on the new TV he got for Christmas.  I wish it <br/>
had been bigger.  I guess it&#39;s 21&quot; or 19&quot; but the one he had before was <br/>
slightly bigger (and all messed up).<br/>
<br/>
On top of the &quot;entertainment center&quot; is a Lego western town, quite dusty.  <br/>
Some inside a fort, some outside, and a big box-looking thing.  I said &quot;Is this <br/>
where you keep your other lego?&quot;  He said &quot;That&#39;s my bank.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I lifted the top off, because it&#39;s like a box with a lid.   There was change <br/>
in there.  He said &quot;Take some out and put it in the front there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I walked around it and saw it was a western-town bank.  For that western <br/>
town, it&#39;s a sensible high brick building with a reinforced front, a door <br/>
with windows on either side, a facade front, and in the top of the facade, if you <br/>
put money anywhere along that top, it goes into a slot and into a chute into <br/>
the &quot;vault.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He  never made it and got excited and showed it off to us.  He just made it <br/>
for himself, dusty months ago, and I discovered it by poking around.<br/>
<br/>
So I called Keith to come and see it and gave him a handful of change from my <br/>
own &quot;change cup&quot;  to try it out as Holly and I looked on admiringly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was fun.<br/>
<br/>

I have many ideas for younger children but with a 10 and 14 year old this <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem as easy.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
In our main bathroom I have a book-end (I taped it to the counter) and I <br/>
switch things through.  Right now there&#39;s an Eddie Izzard book (sent from England <br/>
because we couldn&#39;t get it here), Scholastic&#39;s Voyages of Discovery book about <br/>
Architecture (I LOVE that series), a timeline on the history of New Mexico (I <br/>
found it online looking for a detail, and hit &quot;print,&quot; stapled the pages and <br/>
put it in the bathroom), a book on Egyptian artifacts Marty and I picked up at <br/>
the state museum in South Carolina in August, and a few other things.  The <br/>
Green Mile was in there, but a friend borrowed it.   Things get switched out not <br/>
all as a batch, but I&#39;ll put a thing elsewhere or a kid will take it to his <br/>
room (the illustrated &quot;Hobbit&quot; isn&#39;t there anymore, I think I saw it in the <br/>
library--the REAL library, upstairs) or someone borrows it or I just put it away <br/>
and something else gets in there.<br/>
<br/>
I put the new Smithsonian on the kitchen table.  I&#39;ve put away a pile of <br/>
National Geographics that had started to be just pushed aside.  A photo album of <br/>
pictures of the house I grew up in, and me in that house or outside in the yard <br/>
has been Holly&#39;s favorite lately.  She has asked me about every photo, and <br/>
she got me to put my elementary class photos in there yesterday, each in a sheet <br/>
protector, and she went through all the people she knows who went to school <br/>
with me (four people, some in different years, some in more than one), and she <br/>
has talked about my hairdos in my own photos and how much my 6th year photo <br/>
looks like her.<br/>
<br/>
I might put that out upstairs on a table because the boys might be interested <br/>
in it too.  And then it will end up with other photo albums.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is clearing his throat meaningfully behind me.  He wants a turn online.<br/>
<br/>
Holly just said &quot;Dad and I are going to watch Logan&#39;s Run, you want to watch <br/>
it with us, Marty?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s it about?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The future, from the 80&#39;s&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How far in the future?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know.  Dad said we have to watch it and find out.  You don&#39;t have to <br/>
watch it all, you could just watch part of it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m listening in hopes he&#39;ll bite, and I can keep the computer, but no, he <br/>
has declined and is milling about the door there, discussing DVD settings with <br/>
Holly, and how to get it to &quot;widescreen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so I am bounced.  Maybe this will inspire me to go and switch out some <br/>
&quot;stuff&quot; upstairs.  Good idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-166412471">Probably our favorite strewing is more of ideas than physical things, at<br/>
least with my older kids (13 and 10).  I have gazillions of interests, many<br/>
short-lived but always intense.  I send off for lots of catalogs, brochures,<br/>
etc. and they tend to be left out on the bar for several days.  The kids<br/>
look through them at will and we talk about them.<br/>
<br/>
We are also in several homeschool groups, 4-H, gymnastics, get the<br/>
newspaper, etc..  I read all the newsletters from the groups and toss out<br/>
what is going on in various groups and see if the kids are interested.  I<br/>
try not to pre-sift the ideas too much because you just never know who might<br/>
like to go.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like that!  It sort of sums up all of mine in one<br/>
sentence.<br/>
<br/>
My New Years Resolutions include:<br/>
<br/>
Thinking Outside the Box more<br/>
<br/>
Refusing to be Intimidated or Constrained by<br/>
Legalistic Boundaries<br/>
<br/>
Spending More Time just ENJOYING being with my<br/>
Children and Husband<br/>
<br/>
Not worrying about deadlines and time schedules as<br/>
much<br/>
<br/>
Refusing to think badly of myself, or allowing others<br/>
to project their judgemental attitudes onto me, for<br/>
enjoying the things I enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would love some feedback of &quot;Favorite Strewing&quot;<br/>
&gt; ideas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our best strewing method is to rearrange the furniture<br/>
every few months.  Somehow just changing the big<br/>
pieces around makes the whole room more interesting<br/>
and fun to be in.  Suddenly the books are in a new<br/>
place, the games are in another part of the house, and<br/>
there are new views from favorite cozy chairs.<br/>
<br/>
We have subscriptions to many magazines, some of which<br/>
I will let lapse, others renew, as I have seen<br/>
interests in some and not others.  Sports Illustrated<br/>
Kids will not be renewed.  I don&#39;t think any of us has<br/>
read even one issue.  We keep them on the table in the<br/>
living room, and I change out the last issue for the<br/>
current ones.<br/>
<br/>
Some are magazines that I like, like Smithsonian and<br/>
National Geographic and NG Traveler and Home Education<br/>
and Mothering.  Some are for Sarah, the artist like<br/>
American Artist, and National Geographic Kids is for<br/>
Aaron (but Andrew looks at them too), and PC Week for<br/>
dh Theo.<br/>
<br/>
We have a telescope pointed out the front window at<br/>
the stars.<br/>
<br/>
We have a fully stocked &quot;art center&quot; in the basement<br/>
where the built-in wet bar is.  Makes cleaning up<br/>
brushes and paints easier.<br/>
<br/>
Three computers and tons of games.  An electric guitar<br/>
with instructional dvds.  A set of electric drums with<br/>
instructional dvds.  A piano (did the lessons for a<br/>
while, now they just tinker on it).  Many rhythm<br/>
instruments.  Mom&#39;s flute and an extra student flute.<br/>
<br/>
A bird feeder.  There is an identification chart on<br/>
the wall by the window of all the birds that make<br/>
their homes in Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
There are tools and scrap wood in the garage, and a<br/>
tool bench/work table.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are books, and games, and microscopes<br/>
and kits and cookbooks and kitchen utensils and cable<br/>
tv and internet access.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

My closet is all shelves.  I put my few hanging things in with Keith&#39;s, and <br/>
my stuff is folded on the shelves, or in baskets on the shelves.  I LOVE that, <br/>
much better than my past hanging closet-plus-drawers.<br/>
