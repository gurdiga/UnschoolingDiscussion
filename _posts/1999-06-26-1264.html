<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114895192">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Well what we did and are continuing to do for our small group was to make a<br/>
flyer and put it in the book stores, library, welcome center, anywhere<br/>
home-schoolers frequent.  We put that we are and inclusive group and<br/>
welcome people from all different backgrounds and teaching styles.  I also<br/>
put our group on all the web pages I could find for our state.  I have<br/>
gotten about 10 responses from the web.  We are growing slowly but the<br/>
people in our group are wonderful.  Also, we decided on a monthly mom&#39;s<br/>
night out, that way we had a meeting time for new people to come and meet<br/>
us.  We do a weekly play day too but there&#39;s not much time to talk there.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway HTH.<br/>
<br/>
