<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744507898">I&#39;ve been lurking for a few weeks (well, ok, since May, LOL) and I am <br/>
enjoying all of the discussions.<br/>
<br/>
I have three children. Katherine is 16, recently took her HS <br/>
equivalency test and is starting community college full-time next week. <br/>
She is studying Japanese, has bought herself 2 GameCubes (one for the <br/>
family, one for her room), has a part time pet sitting gig going, and <br/>
people mistake us for twins (ego-boost to this almost 40 yr old mom, I <br/>
can tell ya!)! Christopher is 13, ADHD, profoundly gifted and 13 (LOL). <br/>
He loves demolition and is taking trombone lessons. Aaron is 5, he <br/>
loves his Whirly Wheels, games, snuggling with Mom, Futurama and <br/>
SpongeBob. All three love Nintendo and the computer (and I could tell <br/>
100 stories of things they&#39;ve learned from them!). We&#39;re also active in <br/>
the SCA. We&#39;re homeschooled for about 5 years, sort of a flexible <br/>
eclectic bordering on unschooling, all along, we just didn&#39;t know <br/>
unschooling had a name (we just thought we were weird, as we started <br/>
HS&#39;ing in Colorado, where everyone we met that HS&#39;d did it for <br/>
religious reasons or was into extreme AP)!<br/>
<br/>
The food thread has really caught my attention. My brother and his wife <br/>
do the control thing with their kids, and not just with food, tho the <br/>
food is the most obvious aspect. They will tell their children when <br/>
they are hungry, fill their plates for them (close to adult-sized <br/>
portions), refuse to let them get up until the plate is empty (the <br/>
children have cried, vomited from forced eating, etc., and are scolded <br/>
for it), and then if they DO finish their meal, are allowed 3 chips or <br/>
a small piece of cornbread as a dessert. My brother and Mom actually <br/>
got into an argument once over corn chips (*siiiiigh*). Two of the four <br/>
children have medical digestive issues (big shock there ;). They would <br/>
do the sugar-hoarding bit, but they are never let out of my SIL&#39;s sight <br/>
unless they are at a home with similar eating philosophies (they aren&#39;t <br/>
allowed to be in my house without one of their parents, I am way too <br/>
radical for them). They have extreme ideas on a lot of things, not just <br/>
food, and we don&#39;t get long well (my children can&#39;t stand their <br/>
cousins, sad, but what can we do). Fortunately, they live in a <br/>
different state and we have recently managed to have other plans when <br/>
they visit ... ;).<br/>
<br/>
Now my question. I don&#39;t have the playdate problem, but I do run into <br/>
issues with other children. I am the children&#39;s officer for our local <br/>
SCA branch (Barony of Gyldenholt, in the Kingdom of Caid, for those who <br/>
know the SCA). Most (probably all) of the children are in public school <br/>
or daycare. I run my activities much like unschooling - the stuff is <br/>
there, sometimes with game rules, or a sample craft, but except for <br/>
safety reasons, I don&#39;t care what the kids do. If they use the chessmen <br/>
as people on a block tower, good for them! The craft stuff is there to <br/>
be used, but not in any particular manner, tho sometimes we&#39;ll have a <br/>
class in weaving or something (which is, of course, not compulsory). My <br/>
only rules (principles?) are we don&#39;t hurt other people, and we don&#39;t <br/>
destroy things that belongs to someone else (without their consent ;). <br/>
One problem I have is that some children take advantage of this and <br/>
hoard - materials, prizes, whatever. We&#39;ll have a game where all <br/>
participants get a token and they&#39;ll pretend they lost it to get <br/>
another. On one hand, I don&#39;t mind this (if they really need a second <br/>
plastic ring, it&#39;s just not that huge of a deal), but on the other, I <br/>
don&#39;t have unlimited supplies to just give away. Plus the other (public <br/>
schooled) children protest, they ALL want a second one, etc. Any <br/>
thoughts here? My other problem is that they have the public school <br/>
mentality, as far as creativity, being given directions, etc. As an <br/>
example, one time we made rag dolls from fabric scraps and yarn. Now, <br/>
my way to teach this sort of thing is to sit on the ground, and have a <br/>
sample, and help the kids when they ask, or maybe just pick up the <br/>
supplies and make one myself, and wait for the kids to come see it and <br/>
ask about it. Sometimes I just put the stuff out and if they find the <br/>
sample and want to copy it, ok. I will demonstrate how to make it, or <br/>
help tie a knot or whatever, depending on the child, what they want, <br/>
etc. The younger kids (6 and under) are SO fun, they are so creative <br/>
and have no set idea of how things must be. The older kids, tho ... <br/>
will compare supplies, he got a better color, her yarn is longer, etc. <br/>
Wait until told exactly what to do (you may start now ... ). Have to be <br/>
shown how to draw a face. Will only draw it EXACTLY the way I show them <br/>
(or like the sample). Make rude comments to a 3 yr old who happily <br/>
draws 14 eyes and 2 noses and no mouth (to which, I usually go <br/>
overboard praising the unusual and creative doll ... any other ways to <br/>
handle this?). Someone had a pi√±ata once - not my idea - and the older <br/>
kids bashed it before the small kids had a chance (the knights all <br/>
laughed, which just encouraged the kids more ... ), and then they were <br/>
like wild dogs scrounging for the candy (my boys, OTOH, watched from a <br/>
distance, walked up and took the 3-4 pieces they really wanted, then <br/>
left, LOL - and I ended up tossing out even that, I think they ate one <br/>
piece each). Any ideas on either how to get these kids to loosen up a <br/>
bit, or for me to stop worrying about it? :) It&#39;s starting to be a <br/>
problem since it is mostly the same few children that exhibit this <br/>
behavior, and I see them a lot. It&#39;s not like a playdate where I can <br/>
refuse to allow them in my house. I don&#39;t feel like quitting the job is <br/>
the answer, since there are SOME people who LOVE what I do, I mostly <br/>
enjoy it, and my replacement could be more school-y and then my own <br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t want to participate. And don&#39;t get me started on 7 yr <br/>
olds who already rhino-hide, grr, we&#39;re working on that too (Sandra? <br/>
Help! :).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any insights on this.<br/>
