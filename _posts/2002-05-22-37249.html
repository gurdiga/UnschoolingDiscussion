BORED NO MORE<br/>
by SandraDodd, 1998<br/>
<br/>
Another homeschooling mom once wrote, “It&#39;s a valuable lesson to learn to <br/>
deal with boredom, just like all other emotions.” <br/>
<br/>
Until I read that, I hadn’t ever thought of boredom as an emotion. I liked <br/>
the idea. When a child comes to me seeking advice on how to deal with any <br/>
emotional state, I&#39;m flattered and glad for the opportunity. <br/>
<br/>
Traditionally in this culture boredom is seen as a state of sin. “I’m bored” <br/>
is met by unthinking parents with, “Then mop the kitchen,” or “You have a <br/>
thousand dollars’ worth of toys, you can’t be bored,” or “Boredom’s good <br/>
for you.” I believe the VERY common habit of belittling children who use the <br/>
word “bored” should be rethought (or “thought,” since it seems many parents <br/>
have never considered it carefully but just repeat what their parents said to <br/>
them). <br/>
<br/>
If a child came and said she was heartbroken would you tell her she was a <br/>
brat and should clean the garage? If a child came and said he was angry <br/>
enough to hit would you say, “Then sit down and read a book whether you want <br/>
to or not”? Wouldn’t you try to help them? It&#39;s nonsensical to me that some <br/>
parents shame their children for saying they are at a loss about what to do <br/>
next. <br/>
<br/>
The most to be accomplished from punishing or sending bored kids away is that <br/>
the kids will learn not to go to that parent for advice and ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the real message behind &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; is &quot;I&#39;m little and feeling <br/>
agitated and vaguely unhappy and I don&#39;t know what I can do to get over this <br/>
uncomfortable feeling. What would you do if you were my age, in this house, <br/>
on a day like this?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think that deserves a helpful, respectful response. <br/>
<br/>
It is rare that my children say, “I’m bored,” but when they do I walk with <br/>
them where they are, or to some other part of the house, thinking quickly <br/>
about what I might have that they have never seen, or haven’t seen for a <br/>
while. I think of art supplies or games or toys or musical instruments they <br/>
haven’t thought of for a long time. I scan my mind and the house for things <br/>
which would provide some visual, auditory, olfactory, or mental stimulation, <br/>
preferably two or three of those. Tactile stimulation is good too--perhaps <br/>
the offer of a shower or bath with new/different toys, or different soap or <br/>
something. Sometimes “watering the yard” (playing with the hose) will do. <br/>
When a baby cries for no clear reason, parents will often joyfully see <br/>
whether the baby means “I’m uncomfortable.” They’ll try a change of <br/>
clothes, physical contact, a change of temperature, more air, less air, hot <br/>
food, cold food, a stroll outside, a car ride, SOMETHING different. Older <br/>
kids have the same needs, and the expression of that need might come through <br/>
as whining, irritability, or a claim of boredom. <br/>
Maybe it’s not physical need, but intellectual need. Boredom is a desire for <br/>
input which unschooling parents should welcome. It’s a child saying “How can <br/>
I add excitement to my life?” This can be a big opportunity to introduce a <br/>
new subject, activity, or thought-collection. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it’s an emotional need, and the parent’s undivided attention for a <br/>
little while will solve the problem. A walk, some joking, a hug, inquiries <br/>
about progress on the child’s projects or plans or friends might serve many <br/>
purposes at once. If after a walk and a talk the child is not quite <br/>
refreshed, you still had that time together, which made “I’m bored” a useful <br/>
invitation to bonding. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes “bored” means tired, low on energy, needing a break from conscious <br/>
thought and responsibility. Arranging a nap, or putting on a soothing video <br/>
(even for older kids--a romance instead of an action flick, or light drama <br/>
instead of comedy), leaving a pillow on the couch and herding the rest of the <br/>
family in other directions might result in an unplanned but needed nap. <br/>
<br/>
I’m grown. I still get bored occasionally. Thinking about why I’m bored and <br/>
forgiving myself for being bored have helped me assist my children in <br/>
learning some coping skills they can use in their own lives. I have also used <br/>
my occasional boredom as a trigger to seek out the kids. If there’s a lull in <br/>
my life now I should fill it with those children who will be gone too soon. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome opportunities to learn about when and why your child asks for your <br/>
advice and stimulation. The threshhold of needing the parent will change over <br/>
time, and parents can really use knowing where it is and seeing the benefit <br/>
in it. One complaint of parents of school kids is that communications are <br/>
lacking or are misunderstood. Homeschoolers have the fulltime luxury of the <br/>
chance to do better. Unschoolers have the added advantage of “counting” <br/>
every interaction as a learning experience. Self awareness, interpersonal <br/>
skills, creativity and compassion all come into play when a child and a <br/>
parent can build an uplifting memory from “I’m bored.”</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706451855">Wow!  I never thought of it that way!  I&#39;ve always told my kids, &quot;Bored people are boring people.&quot;  But I think you&#39;re right.  It might just be a way of reaching out.  Thanks!  Cris<br/>
