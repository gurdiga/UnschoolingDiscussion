<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039249689">I don&#39;t know if you know about this feature, but at Onelist they have shared<br/>
files.  On my own list I run for parents who are raising angry children, we<br/>
all post our bios there.  It&#39;s easy to do.  You can write out your bio on<br/>
your notepad because that is a program everyone can open, go to the shared<br/>
files area of the list, and follow directions to upload it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just an idea but it&#39;s done on my list plus two more that I&#39;m on and it<br/>
works.  Another thing you can put on the list is pictures of you and your<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
My own problem with this is that even if the list is closed and restricted,<br/>
which it is not, people can still lie to get on the list and will have<br/>
access to the bios.  I don&#39;t want anyone knowing where I live and who my<br/>
children are.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing to do if you choose this forum, I believe, is to post your<br/>
bio but leave out last names and towns.  Just first names and the state<br/>
should keep you safe enough.<br/>

 I agree,  my name and number and addy are posted all over the net, but it&#39;s <br/>
not something to do lightly.  I&#39;d prefer to keep my last name and hometown <br/>
private.  I&#39;m going over to www.onelist.com and check out some of the <br/>
capablities there.  <br/>
<br/>
 Any help will be appreciated.  :)<br/>
