<div id="ygrps-yiv-358380368">I am curious to know if anyone on the list has experience being a host<br/>
family for an exchange student.. we were contacted tonight and it was a<br/>
surprise..but we are considering it..what a benefit to our two daughters to<br/>
get to know someone from another culture!  Any advice or comments would be<br/>
appreciated..not sure what they would think of our very unstructured,<br/>
unschooling, laid back way of life! Also I&#39;m not sure about how to handle<br/>
being involved with the public school system..or if I even want to be in<br/>
this way.<br/>
