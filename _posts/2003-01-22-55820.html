&lt;A big part of what bothers me about churches is the clergy/laity <br/>
&lt;distinction. The whole idea of sermons and no input from the <br/>
&lt;congregation REALLY bothers me. I don&#39;t think that church was meant <br/>
&lt;to be a performance that we watch but a community that we participate <br/>
&lt;in. <br/>

This is why I am Unitarian! The services are very open. We are not<br/>
&quot;Preached to&quot; we ask questions and interact with our pastor and for that<br/>
matter not all &quot;sermons&quot; are delivered by the pastor , anyone can present<br/>
if they have something to share/teach/discuss. I am also a practicing pagan<br/>
and I&#39;m not comfortable calling myself a  Christian. I actually believe<br/>
their is beauty and truth in ALL spiritual practices/religions and I like<br/>
to feel free to receive from them all, as I think most on this list do. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to promote any religion over another. I agree that the best<br/>
policy is to read/learn/think for yourself, but if some of you are looking<br/>
for a &quot;church&quot; like this, you should really check out your local Unitarian<br/>
Fellowship. I&#39;m actually kind of enjoying this thread, I like to hear from<br/>
&quot;Christians&quot; who are dissatisfied with the way their religion is perceived/<br/>
organized/etc. It&#39;s really nice to be reminded that not all Christians are<br/>
fundamentalists who are out to take away our religious freedom!<br/>

&quot;A library of wisdom, is more precious than all wealth, and all things that<br/>
are desirable cannot be compared to it. Whoever therefore claims to be<br/>
zealous of truth, of happiness, of wisdom or knowledge, aye even of the<br/>
faith, must needs become a lover of books&quot;. - Richard de Bury</div>
