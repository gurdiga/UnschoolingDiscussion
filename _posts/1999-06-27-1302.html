<div id="ygrps-yiv-678365954">Since becoming an unschooling advocate, I have become so enlightened! I<br/>
just shake my head at newspaper articles like the one in today&#39;s<br/>
(Charleston, SC) paper:<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
                ~ EDUCATION WINS OUT IN LEGISLATIVE SESSION ~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Toddlers to teachers will be affected by $418 million in new education<br/>
spending and a $1 billion school bond bill passed during the 1999<br/>
legislative session under Gov. Jim Hodges&#39; leadership.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;We had an extraordinary year in public education,&#39; Hodges said.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He listed initiatives including a 2000 vote on a state lottery with<br/>
proceeds going to education, the $1 billion bond bill for school<br/>
construction, increased teacher salaries...a program to help districts<br/>
start and operate alternative schools for discipline, and $20 million<br/>
for First Steps, an early childhood education program.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hodges predicts that parents will feel better about their children&#39;s<br/>
schools by this time next year, and test scores will start going up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of money. A lot of MY tax money. <br/>
<br/>
They just don&#39;t get it, do they?<br/>

From Sandra: &lt;There is a lot of money involved in schools, aside from<br/>
just teachers wanting to keep their salaries.  There&#39;s federal grant<br/>
money, textbook publishing, materials manufacture and sale, school bus<br/>
manufacture, sales and driver training and drivers&#39; salaries; there&#39;s<br/>
the whole school cafeteria industry; school library industry;<br/>
substance-abuse education industry, and so on.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From John: &lt;Not to mention the big contracts for the construction and<br/>
maintenance of schools.&gt;</div>
