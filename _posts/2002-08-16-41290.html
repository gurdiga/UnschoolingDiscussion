 The amendments to our Constitution include #1 - the so-called establishment<br/>
clause -- that made state-funded or state-promoted religion unlawful. Before<br/>
that time, churches had close ties to local governments -- towns elected the<br/>
leaders of the large congregations to run the towns (in New England<br/>
especially) Not that there was anything wrong with that, but one main effect<br/>
was that it made religion and government into one (cozy) thing, with<br/>
financial ties very common.<br/>
<br/>
That separation of church and state has led to recent arguments against<br/>
vouchers, but those arguments have been declared invalid by the supreme<br/>
court in the case of Cleveland, because there is no direct tie between the<br/>
money spent by the state and the religious schools where it might end up --<br/>
that is a parent&#39;s choice after the money is in the parents&#39; hands. Like<br/>
food stamps -- no tellin&#39; where they&#39;ll be spent or on what, or whether the<br/>
money they represent will support the unsavory habits of store keepers who<br/>
accept them.<br/>
<br/>
The founding fathers wanted to break the bonds (binds) between church and<br/>
state, thus they did NOT want a theocracy. They wanted UNtheocracy.<br/>
<br/>
But  HSLDA does seek theocracy. That&#39;s what Patrick Henry College is about,<br/>
training young evangelical fundamental christians to be politicians who will<br/>
change laws in order to turn the country into a theocracy based on their own<br/>
personal ideas of  &quot;Theo.&quot;<br/>

That was ME wondering. Someone said that Recons, or HSLDA, want to *return* <br/>
the US to &quot;the theocracy that the Founders intended it to be.&quot; I responded <br/>
with the above, as if to say &quot;when and where and how did the Founders ever <br/>
intend such a thing?&quot; knowing full well that they feared nothing more, and <br/>
were well aware that Americans in their individual states could handle <br/>
religion on their own. <br/>
<br/>
In my readings of Recon and HSLDA material, I don&#39;t doubt that the intention <br/>
to create a theocracy may be their motivation, but I don&#39;t think I have ever <br/>
read anything by them wherein they admitted to believing the Founders <br/>
intended a theocracy. The Recons aren&#39;t illiterate. Crazy? Yes, but not <br/>
ignorant. I also believe they can be highly and intentionally deceptive. For <br/>
example:<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday Gary North had a wonderful piece at LewRockwell.com, on the <br/>
late and estimable Robert Nisbet. Everything in the piece was very good <br/>
(until the end when North diverges into his Medieval rant about &quot;covenants&quot;), <br/>
and his take on Nisbet&#39;s view about the Founders was right on the money, <br/>
i.e., the Founders would be beside themselves at the state of America (pun <br/>
intended), especially the bloated war machine, and the &quot;loose individual&quot; <br/>
(title of one of Nisbet&#39;s chapters in The Present Age).<br/>
<br/>
Now, why would Gary North write a praise piece about Nisbet, when all that <br/>
North stands for flies in the face of what Nisbet stood for. It is deceptive <br/>
to say the least. Robert Nisbet would consider Gary North a sociopath if he <br/>
read some of North&#39;s writings, which indeed look to the day when America will <br/>
be ruled by the Old Testament.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The phrase I&#39;m seeing is wanting the US to &quot;return to it&#39;s Biblical<br/>
foundations&quot;. Either the homeschoolers telling us their beliefs interpretted<br/>
the phrase as meaning the Founding Fathers wanted a theocracy or didn&#39;t make<br/>
the distinction clear leading me (and I&#39;m thinking others according to the<br/>
discussion) to interpretted it that way.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone&#39;s interested, here&#39;s they type of thinking that is shared by many<br/>
in the Christian homeschooling movement. (As opposed to Christians who<br/>
homeschool.)<br/>

CONSTITUTIONAL & BIBLICAL FOUNDATIONS<br/>
By Albion Knight Jr.<br/>
US Taxpayers (Constitution) Party&#39;s 1992 Vice Presidential Nominee<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The objective of the U.S. Taxpayers Party is to restore our nation to its<br/>
Constitutional and Biblical foundations. The public generally understands<br/>
what is meant by &quot;constitutional&quot; foundations, They understand less what we<br/>
mean by a return to &quot;Biblical&quot; foundations. Some accuse us of wanting to<br/>
impose a &quot;theocracy&quot; upon as our government. Others accused us of wanting to<br/>
&quot;impose our morality&quot; upon American&#39;s private lives. Neither accusation is<br/>
true. A &quot;theocracy&quot; is not our goal. Our goal is to return to the political<br/>
government defined in the Constitution by our Founding Fathers. We do not<br/>
seek to legislate God&#39;s Law into our governmental processes. We do seek to<br/>
have God-fearing men and women serving at all levels of our government.<br/>
Their influence for promoting the general welfare cannot help but to give<br/>
strength and encouragement to all American people. What are the Biblical<br/>
foundations upon which America was based? Although there are many, some<br/>
important ones are:<br/>
<br/>
First, God is sovereign over the nation not man. This means that there is a<br/>
Law higher than the Law of the State. Thus, the State is not and cannot be<br/>
the last appeal of our aggrieved citizens.<br/>
<br/>
Second, we Americans are individuals created equal by God, as noted in the<br/>
Declaration of Independence. Thus, the individual is more important in God&#39;s<br/>
eyes than the State. In tyrannical societies, there is no power higher than<br/>
the State.<br/>
<br/>
Third, we recognize the truth of the Biblical assertion of the innate<br/>
sinfulness of man. This means that all persons have within themselves the<br/>
tendency to think of their own well-being before that of others. Thus, no<br/>
one person can be completely trusted with power. Therefore, we need the<br/>
checks and balances defined in our Constitution.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, God is the God of History. He forms nations. He judges nations. We<br/>
know from our history, and as stated by our Founding Fathers, that the<br/>
United States could not have been formed without the providence of God. We<br/>
cannot continue as a free, independent sovereign nation without the<br/>
providence of God.<br/>
<br/>
Fifth, God gave mankind a Law which is unchangeable absolute truth.<br/>
Relativism being taught in our public schools depends only upon man&#39;s<br/>
decisions, not God&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, God is the present and ultimate judge over the deeds of nations. No<br/>
nation can hide from or avoid this judgment of God. This means that there is<br/>
a price to be paid for every action of injustice, immorality, dishonesty,<br/>
and corruption taken by leaders, governments, societies and individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Upon these foundations, America will stand. If they are destroyed, so will<br/>
our nation.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I see that everywhere. What I have also seen, is the suggestion that the <br/>
Founders didn&#39;t go far enough. That is, they didn&#39;t establish a Biblical <br/>
Commonwealth, but should have.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to say, but this view of politics and Christianity flies in the <br/>
face of all Reformation thinking -- Luther and Calvin -- and even Augustinian <br/>
thinking, the roots of which HSLDA and others claim to be their own.<br/>
