<div><font size="2">Dear fellow homeschoolers,&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I was faced with 
my son, Zain&#39;s very blunt words, and since I base his learning on what he 
naturally&nbsp;inspires towards&nbsp;learning about, it kinda hit me hard. I 
want him to be happy in his learning environment.&nbsp; He sais,&quot; Am I ever 
gonna go to a regular school?, and play with the toys?&quot; (when he was around 3 we 
went and viewed some schools, to get an idea of what was available besides 
public school, and I think he may be referrring to one of the schools we went to 
see)_I said this is a regular school, and you have plenty of toys(my son is 
4)&nbsp; He spouts off&quot; This ain&#39;t NO school, This is a home!!!!&quot;&nbsp; This was 
very frustrating to me, as I feel he is expressing the need for more stimulating 
activites.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really know how to go about planning more activites. 
Has anyone else had something like this occur. My question also being, having 
Never been taught in an institutional environment, I wonder why he would ASSUME 
he would enjoy this environment more than homeschool.&nbsp; ANd why would he 
categorize homeschool , Not as school, where does this , sounding-programmed 
attitide come from?&nbsp; It really makes my confidence in homeschooling, 
suffer.&nbsp; I wish I had a homeschooling group, so that he could see other 
children who are also learning like this, as all his friends, and aquaintences 
are in public or private schools.&nbsp; SO this is probably where he gets 
it.&nbsp; Any advice here?&nbsp; I want to start a playgroup , does anyone have 
any suggestions about getting one up off it&#39;s feet?&nbsp;There are many reasons 
I chose to homeschool him, and they are all very important to me, but when he 
makes a statement such as this I wonder if I am giving him what he needs. 
Thanks.&nbsp; Michelle</font></div></span></blockquote></html>
