<div id="ygrps-yiv-980668291">Laura,<br/>
    I can understand how you feel about missing your son.  My daughter and<br/>
step-daughter are with their great-grandparents for three weeks.  They flew<br/>
out the 11th and will return on 8-2.  I miss them something awful.  I love<br/>
their company.  They are such a big part of my day.  And my daughter, Amanda<br/>
 has only been away from me for  a week when she went to stay with my<br/>
parents for a visit.  We are facing a bit of a trial with this visit. <br/>
Amanda is on a strict gfcf diet for her Autism.  Well, they are not buying<br/>
her gfcf food, so she is doing her best to stick to it on her own.  When we<br/>
discussed this with my wife&#39;s grandmother, the reply was that she didn&#39;t<br/>
look like she was having any problems.  They aren&#39;t around her enough to see<br/>
the benefits of the diet.  Oh well, I just encourage Amanda to do her best<br/>
to stick to fruits and veggies.  We&#39;ll detox her when she gets home.  On the<br/>
upswing, both girls are enjoying their visit.  We just got a letter today<br/>
from them and they have been swimming, playing ping pong and pool.  They are<br/>
staying active :-) My heart goes out to you...I am missing my girls alot too<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>

Summer is bringing situations that we don&#39;t face throughout the year. This <br/>
week away from my son has caused me to stop and think about our family and life <br/>
in general. There are so many situations in our lives that we could change to <br/>
make life softer/less stressful. There are so many thing I take for granted. <br/>
<br/>

Who is thrilled that her son is coming home tomorrow. Yippee<br/>
<br/>
My heart goes out to you...I am missing my girls alot too<br/>
