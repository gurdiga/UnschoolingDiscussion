<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275027090">&#39;There is a great<br/>
difference in abuse and in a parent discliplining their child with a <br/>
spanking,<br/>
though.<br/>
Myranda&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is there really?<br/>
It&#39;s a mild form of violence, true, but that doesn&#39;t make it peaceful <br/>
or nonviolent nonetheless.<br/>
Hitting is hitting. Call it what it is. The adult can&#39;t do it to <br/>
another adult or they&#39;d have the cops called on them for sure.<br/>
It&#39;s ILLEGAL for an adult to hit another adult. But ok for parents to <br/>
hit? That&#39;s all spanking is.<br/>
NO, I don&#39;t think children should be removed from their parents over <br/>
spanking. I was spanked and felt loved and safe and all that, but it <br/>
was still wrong. Fortunately for me, my parents had HUGE regrets over <br/>
ever spanking me and apologized profusely and sent me books on <br/>
positive parenting ad nauseum.<br/>
My Dad will  never forgive himself fully I don&#39;t think.<br/>
I don&#39;t think my Mom ever did either.<br/>
Just because it&#39;s a mild form of abuse, doesn&#39;t make it right.<br/>
Just because you are desensitized to other parents hitting their <br/>
children, doesn&#39;t make it ok either.<br/>
I get physically ill, sick to my stomache when I see children being <br/>
hit.<br/>

I&#39;ve never considered it abuse, and neither do most laws and families. Many doctors promote it. So I think legally, it is not abuse. Personally, I&#39;ll have to think on it more.

Myranda&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t know people that only use light swats on the <br/>
bottom and never swat a bit hard.<br/>
How hard is a &quot;light swat&quot;? Does it hurt?<br/>
If not, is it necessary?<br/>
I don&#39;t think a &quot;light swat&quot; would do anything to promote family <br/>
peace, nor would it be a sufficient detterant in a home where <br/>
punishment is used.<br/>
So if it is unecessary, why do it? If it hurts, then it&#39;s back to the <br/>
hitting issue again.<br/>
And hitting people to solve problems is WRONG. Especially when a <br/>
bigger, stronger person is using it on a smaller, more defenseless <br/>
person.<br/>
I see spanking as not only a non-creative way to accomplish what you <br/>
want, but hugely lacking in self control.<br/>
Is that the example a parent wants for their child? <br/>
I stand by my view that any form of spanking is abusive. Not to the <br/>
point that a child should be removed of course, but certainly to the <br/>
point that the person should learn some better skills and quit doing <br/>
damage to the parent/child relationship.<br/>
Because any form of physical punishment, any form of punishment <br/>
actually, damages the trust and the peace of the relationship.<br/>
The best thing as you ponder this, is to ask yourself if it would be <br/>
a good way for a husband to treat a wife. If it isn&#39;t, then it&#39;s <br/>
probably not a good idea for a parent to do to the child.<br/>

I completely disagree that any &quot;light swats on the bottom&quot; are not <br/>
abuse.  It is violence.  It is a big person being violent towards a little <br/>
person.  It is a big person communicating - unwittingly - that it is okay <br/>
to hit.  What is the point of a &quot;light swat on the bottom&quot; other than to <br/>
dominate and humiliate.  Do you really want your kids to learn that it is <br/>
okay to dominate and humiliate other people, especially if they are smaller <br/>
and less powerful than you!?  If you are angry enough to hit, then you, as <br/>
a mature adult, should be able to communicate your anger in meaningful and <br/>
nonviolent ways.  If you cannot, walking away is the best model for a <br/>
kid.  &quot;I&#39;m so angry, I cannot talk to you right now&quot; is much more honest <br/>
than a &quot;swat on the bottom&quot; and it&#39;s much better for a kid to know that <br/>
when they are that angry, they can walk away.  If you&#39;re telling your kid <br/>
it&#39;s not okay to hit, but hitting them, how confusing is that?<br/>
<br/>
Someone recently asked about anger management for a 5-year-old.  I believe <br/>
that anyone who feels hitting children (no matter how &quot;lightly&quot;) is an <br/>
appropriate way to deal with their angry feelings, further explore anger <br/>
management for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Hitting is not okay.  It is abuse.  It is mean.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m done.  Back to work.<br/>

I really did not want in on this one but Ren dragged me in.&lt;bg&gt; Since I&#39;ve <br/>
shared other short comings here with my oldest, I might as well add more <br/>
fuel. Well Ren, now you know someone who did use to use light swats on the <br/>
butt. Again I have to say, when I knew better, I did better. I grew up being <br/>
swatted here and there. A vivid memory is getting slapped across the face <br/>
from my mom when I repeated her saying &quot;up your ass!&quot; I never thought it <br/>
really damaged me (it did) and also had a husband at the time that believed <br/>
in spanking as being no big deal. He had wooden spoons broken on his butt <br/>
well into adolescents. He always thought fearing your parents was a good <br/>
thing. I could never justify hitting Tara to physically hurt her no matter <br/>
how difficult she was. And she was a tough kid to have as a first child. I <br/>
never was around kids and had no experience what so ever with them. But, <br/>
when Tara wouldn&#39;t listen like I thought she should, I would pop her on the <br/>
diaper. I can guarantee you it didn&#39;t physically hurt her. It got her <br/>
attention but at the same time, I&#39;m not saying it didn&#39;t harm her. Just not <br/>
to physically hurt. I just thought that was the right thing to do and it <br/>
never got any harder than that, even when she was out of diapers. It let her <br/>
know I was there and I was bigger and she needed to listen to me. Again, I&#39;m <br/>
not saying this is a good thing. Just that I did it, and I never hit hard, <br/>
or repeatedly spanked as in turning over ones knee and hitting more than <br/>
once. Never popped her anywhere but her diaper or butt. Again, not proud, <br/>
just glad I learned and sorry I didn&#39;t sooner.<br/>

far I have come to understand, from you, that it is okay to hit children, if <br/>
its just a swat, but not by using a belt (or other device, spoon, switch...) <br/>
And that you shouldn&#39;t interfere with another parent who is using this method <br/>
of discipline on their child because you might not know the circumstances, <br/>
and you can&#39;t really gauge how hard someone is hitting another. But that you <br/>
don&#39;t, well only sometimes, swat children. And you would or wouldn&#39;t (?) call <br/>
authorities if you saw abuse taking place, because the *government says its <br/>
okay*. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t hit my husband, or the lady who rang up my groceries. I would go <br/>
to jail. But I don&#39;t hit them because I would go to jail, I don&#39;t hit them <br/>
because I have more respect for them. The same goes for my kids. How can it <br/>
be okay just because the government says it is so? (the government says lots <br/>
of things are or aren&#39;t okay to do, but that doesn&#39;t make it so.) <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that on one hand you will say *no don&#39;t do ____* but someone <br/>
else will rebut with something and you will say *well, no, it is okay to do <br/>
____* and then three posts later you will contradict yourself again. This is <br/>
a general observation, and not limited to just this particular thread. I <br/>
guess I am asking that you clarify your position a little better, and listen <br/>
to what others are really saying. <br/>

  ~Nancy<br/>
<br/>
  ** Gladly. Here is my position, plain and simple, and without all the OT questions I keep getting thrown. Parents have the right to raise their kids any way they deem fit, excepting abuse. I disagree strongly with a stranger, who does not know circumstances and will likely never see the person/family again, telling people how they should be raising their kids or telling them they are doing whatever-it-is wrong or they should be doing so-and-so instead. It does nothing but anger and/or upset the mother, the child assumes permission has been granted to act whatever way or do whatever the stranger mentions, and all it does is cause problems and chaos and sore feelings. People should offer help or advice instead of forcing it. Then the person, if the offer is accepted, can talk about it away from the child, away from the situation, and with a lot more of an open mind. <br/>
<br/>
  In the case of child abuse, the law should be called in to protect the child. <br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s all I was saying, and have NO idea where all the questions came in about drunks, sexual abuse, and husbands beating their wives. ?????? <br/>
<br/>
  Listen to what everyone else is saying? I&#39;ve definitely tried, but this has gone in twenty different directions! I don&#39;t expect or want to be agreed with on this, just throwing my opinion out there!   <br/>

permission) can be charged.  So why is it ok to lightly swat a child on the<br/>
bottom?  Or is it ok for adults to swat other adults?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay now, are we still just talking about a reprimand here and discipline? <br/>
Because now I&#39;m thinking that everyone here in this house smacks each other <br/>
on the butt in fooling around. Not a hit (I think hits as harder) but a <br/>
light smack. My husband and I do it to each other and we also do it with the <br/>
kids and they to us just fooling around. And what about football players?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you just have to know someone to be able to &quot;have&quot; the permission and <br/>
not have it be in anger?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Myranda, you said you don&#39;t want agreement, but I agree with you <br/>
anyway.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
In an imperfect world, in an imperfect society, with imperfect <br/>
people, the best way to raise children is to let the parents that <br/>
conceived them, birthed them (hmm, well, I was there for all three <br/>
while my wife did rest), and love them, do the raising.  <br/>
<br/>
I do have two additional points, which you might have already said.<br/>
 1. The word abuse seems to have many and broad definitions, so <br/>
perhaps another word needs to be used (like traumatized or <br/>
brutalized) for what parents definitely do not have the right to do <br/>
to their kids or to anyone.<br/>
 2. In light of a number of experiences cited on this list, up to an <br/>
including death, there needs to be a mechanism to step in where the <br/>
line in point 1 is crossed.  Brutal parents will not automatically <br/>
stop what they are doing to their children.  So someone else needs <br/>
to.  <br/>
<br/>
With you, I agree that the ideal solution is a close family or <br/>
community of friends.  They know the situation best and when to step <br/>
in.  In this case, the &quot;it takes a village&quot; should come into play.  <br/>
Not Big Brother the state, but a local community (as someone pointed <br/>
out, like in tribal Africa).<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve never considered it abuse, and neither do most laws and families. <br/>
Many doctors promote it. So I think legally, it is not abuse. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s Sweden that made it illegal 20 years or more ago.  Other <br/>
countries have followed.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe it would help (although I know it has been tried in this <br/>
thread) to narrow down the definition of spanking.  In my opinion, it <br/>
would be one or more swats on the rear end (and only there, because <br/>
it is padded) that may hurt momentarily but do not bruise (or leave <br/>
any marks that don&#39;t disappear quickly).  It may not even hurt at <br/>
all, but provide a warning.  I personally think it should take place <br/>
only between the ages of understanding and accountability (say 2 up <br/>
to 8), because under 2 they don&#39;t understand well enough to avoid a <br/>
spanking and over 7 there are other age-appropriate ways to learn <br/>
things.  I would finally add that it would be a last resort, if the <br/>
age 2-7 child refused to heed other means of communication and if the <br/>
child was headed down the wrong path (making those actions into wrong <br/>
habits).<br/>
<br/>
My understanding of &quot;spanking&quot;, as used in this thread, is parent to <br/>
child, not adult to someone else&#39;s child or adult to adult.  I think <br/>
we would all agree (maybe not?) that adult to adult spanking is not <br/>
desired.  <br/>
<br/>
If we want to discuss the propriety of an adult spanking someone <br/>
else&#39;s chld, I think that is a different (certainly valid) thread.  I <br/>
realize that it has been posted here that parents do not own their <br/>
children.  However you view that, there is still a relationship <br/>
between parent and child that does not exist between any other adult <br/>
and the child (or state and child).  I doubt if anyone here (or <br/>
anywhere) would give blanket permission for any adult to spank any <br/>
child not his/her own.<br/>
<br/>
So, as I see it, we are left on this thread with the defensibility of <br/>
a parent spanking her/his child.  That unique relationship, I <br/>
believe, makes this activity different from the other examples of <br/>
adult to adult and non-parent to child.<br/>
<br/>
Every single child is different.  While some don&#39;t budge for (or seem <br/>
to mind) a spanking, and other are heartbroken, there are some <br/>
children in between for which at times it could be just the <br/>
communication method needed.  <br/>
<br/>
My wife and I rarely spank anymore (haven&#39;t in a long time anyway), <br/>
but when we did (when our children were younger), we cuddled them <br/>
afterwards and the kids were always more loving and well-behaved <br/>
afterwards.  Not saying this was the only way, but am saying it <br/>
worked.  And knowing it was a possibility allowed us to use it <br/>
sparingly.<br/>

know the family dynamics, but do call if a child is being seriously hurt? A <br/>
spanking is a spanking, pain is pain. I know there are degrees to pain, but <br/>

&gt; I thought it was OK to hit kids. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you have said it. Here in this post and in others. You have said that if <br/>
you don&#39;t know the situation, or how much a child is hurting then ignore it. <br/>
And since you have stated you can&#39;t know how hard, or how much it hurts then <br/>
how can you say to call police if a child is hurting? Ignoring or not <br/>

&gt;   ~Nancy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   ** Gladly. Here is my position, plain and simple, and without all the OT <br/>
&gt; questions I keep getting thrown. Parents have the right to raise their kids <br/>
&gt; any way they deem fit, excepting abuse. I disagree strongly with a <br/>
&gt; stranger, who does not know circumstances and will likely never see the <br/>
&gt; person/family again, telling people how they should be raising their kids <br/>
&gt; or telling them they are doing whatever-it-is wrong or they should be doing <br/>
&gt; so-and-so instead. It does nothing but anger and/or upset the mother, the <br/>
&gt; child assumes permission has been granted to act whatever way or do <br/>
&gt; whatever the stranger mentions, and all it does is cause problems and chaos <br/>
&gt; and sore feelings. People should offer help or advice instead of forcing <br/>
&gt; it. Then the person, if the offer is accepted, can talk about it away from <br/>
&gt; the child, away from the situation, and with a lot more of an open mind. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   In the case of child abuse, the law should be called in to protect the <br/>
&gt; child. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But according to your very words, you can&#39;t know if it is abuse or not. So <br/>
why do anything at all? (this is a rhetorical question.) <br/>

spankers...  You don&#39;t believe in spanking but you&#39;re speaking on behalf<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not illegal  for parents to spank and we all know that.<br/>
Wife beating used to be legal, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to defend that.<br/>
 There is no difference Myranda.<br/>
Today if you spanked or &quot;lightly swated&quot; any other person in your life<br/>
you could face legal consequences.<br/>
<br/>
So you can say it&#39;s legal.   But there is no logical way to conclude it&#39;s<br/>
right, or good.<br/>

I would hope, if someone was hitting me or my son, there would be one<br/>
decent person willing to say STOP.<br/>
I would hope my son will one day be that decent person should he witness<br/>
an assault. <br/>
I hope I never look him in the eye and say I didn&#39;t help because it was<br/>
&quot;none of my business.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Today my little boy pushed the shopping cart back inside the store for me<br/>
and came out pushing a cart for an older lady.  He helped her put the<br/>
groceries in her car and he took her cart away.  She wasn&#39;t in any<br/>
danger, she wasn&#39;t being threatened or hurt and he knew it was right to<br/>
offer help.<br/>
<br/>
How could I ever say to him, look it&#39;s fine to help people when they<br/>
don&#39;t really, desperately need help but if you should ever see some kid<br/>
being hit, well, then you need to mind your own business?<br/>
<br/>
Man, I&#39;ve made so many changes in my life and I&#39;ve put aside so many<br/>
things I thought I knew for sure, and I live every single day with the<br/>
hope my child will have a better world and have the courage to make a<br/>
better world, it just is unbelievable to me that you would work so hard<br/>
here to defend a thing that will never make any life better.<br/>

    ** Wonder if a &quot;back-to-family&quot; campaign could be started? :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s called &quot;Christian homeschooling,&quot; and there are hundreds of sites online <br/>
  which will not only say spanking is okay, they will tell you  failure to <br/>
  spank is  a sin.<br/>
<br/>
  They&#39;ll tell you what to wear and who to vote for, too.<br/>
<br/>
  Do you want links?  <br/>
<br/>
  Or just go to www.google.com and put in spanking Christian obedience <br/>
  homeschooling and have a real good time!!<br/>
<br/>

  ** What??? I know I&#39;m tired, and I&#39;m guessing you are too, but I&#39;m really really lost this time!!!!!! I was talking about families staying together and supporting and helping each other. That doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Christians or homeschooling or spanking or obedience! <br/>

the web sites and buy the Sonlight and A Beka and BJU curriculums and be <br/>
justified.<br/>

  Myranda, you can&#39;t really be spending all these posts defending<br/>
  spankers...  You don&#39;t believe in spanking but you&#39;re speaking on behalf<br/>
  of &quot;generic&quot; spankers everywhere?  My stomach is churning.<br/>
  ** I&#39;m defending the right of parents to raise their kids how they see fit, whether it&#39;s light spankings, or unschooling, or boarding school, or attachment parenting, or Dr Spock. It&#39;s a choice, and we live in a country that&#39;s about free choice. I&#39;m not going to say &quot;that&#39;s the wrong choice for everyone&quot; because that&#39;s just not true, no one can make that decision for everyone. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s not illegal  for parents to spank and we all know that.<br/>
  Wife beating used to be legal, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to defend that.<br/>
  There is no difference Myranda.<br/>
  Today if you spanked or &quot;lightly swated&quot; any other person in your life<br/>
  you could face legal consequences.<br/>
<br/>
  So you can say it&#39;s legal.   But there is no logical way to conclude it&#39;s<br/>
  right, or good.<br/>
<br/>
  ** I never said I believed it was good, just that I believe it is a choice.<br/>
<br/>
  I would hope, if someone was hitting me or my son, there would be one<br/>
  decent person willing to say STOP.<br/>
  I would hope my son will one day be that decent person should he witness<br/>
  an assault. <br/>
  I hope I never look him in the eye and say I didn&#39;t help because it was<br/>
  &quot;none of my business.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Today my little boy pushed the shopping cart back inside the store for me<br/>
  and came out pushing a cart for an older lady.  He helped her put the<br/>
  groceries in her car and he took her cart away.  She wasn&#39;t in any<br/>
  danger, she wasn&#39;t being threatened or hurt and he knew it was right to<br/>
  offer help.<br/>
<br/>
  How could I ever say to him, look it&#39;s fine to help people when they<br/>
  don&#39;t really, desperately need help but if you should ever see some kid<br/>
  being hit, well, then you need to mind your own business?<br/>
<br/>
  ** You said the difference. Your son offered help. I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t say to her &quot;you shouldn&#39;t be doing this, I&#39;ll do it&quot; and take off without so much as a by-your-leave. Yes, offer, don&#39;t force! <br/>
<br/>
  Man, I&#39;ve made so many changes in my life and I&#39;ve put aside so many<br/>
  things I thought I knew for sure, and I live every single day with the<br/>
  hope my child will have a better world and have the courage to make a<br/>
  better world, it just is unbelievable to me that you would work so hard<br/>
  here to defend a thing that will never make any life better.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Never popped her anywhere but her diaper or butt. Again, not proud, <br/>
 just glad I learned and sorry I didn&#39;t sooner. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here Mary.<br/>
I still fight the urges that I was raised with...and I had relatively gentle <br/>
parents compared with many of the stories I&#39;m reading here.<br/>
I don&#39;t even recall being spanked much at all, especially after about 6 y.o.<br/>
And yet, I perpetuated it on my oldest.<br/>
My point was that we don&#39;t really know what physically hurts another person, <br/>
a &quot;light swat&quot; may not be so light to the reciever of the swat.<br/>
And the main point I made, was that it&#39;s useless in a punishment oriented <br/>
home if it does not hurt.<br/>
So you&#39;ve either got a physical assault, or an ineffective method of dealing <br/>
with problems.<br/>
Dumb either way.<br/>
The worst thing about any kind of swat is that it&#39;s done in anger (don&#39;t even <br/>
get me started on how sick people are that do it in &quot;cold blood&quot;) and trying <br/>
to deal with any problem when angry is a very bad idea.<br/>
I LOVE Sandra Dodd and Richard Prytowsky&#39;s &quot;gentle parenting&quot; talk from the <br/>
hsc conference in Cali....I listened to it in the car on the way home from SC.<br/>
I want to go beyond fighting my wrong ( yes, WRONG) urges to lash out at <br/>
people, I want to quit being angry too easily, I want to go WAY beyond just <br/>
not spanking and get to not angry.<br/>
A Peaceful home is not only ideal in my mind, but absolutely necessary.<br/>

when a child or wife or dog was being hit then we would all be defending the <br/>
