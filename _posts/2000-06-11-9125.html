<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016755555">haha, I&#39;ll have to remember that statement *IN THE BOX*!!!<br/>
<br/>
well, here&#39;z an update on my h-s&#39;ing friend who decided to challenge the<br/>
library&#39;s policy on WHAT constituted TEACHING MATERIALS after my horrible<br/>
experience earlier this week ... well, @ least I&#39;m NOT crazy b/c the same<br/>
thing happened to her only this time, the head lib was FLAILING (my friend&#39;s<br/>
words) her arms around and raising her voice in a very condescending manner<br/>
saying, &quot;WHAT IS IT W/ YOU H-S P~E~O~P~L~E YOU ARE *ALWAYS* TRYING TO GET<br/>
TAKE ADVANTAGE AND GET AROUND THE SYSTEM!!!&quot;  welllllllllllll, we&#39;ve decided<br/>
to take the matter up w/ the higher~ups b/c this lady obviously has it in<br/>
for h-s&#39;rs ... even though, the other day she PROMISED to address this<br/>
matter in their staff meeting Monday morning (HA) ... either that or she was<br/>
pulling a Dr. Jeckle/Mrs. Hyde routine on my h-s friend b/c she was very<br/>
cooperative w/ me ... we&#39;re also decided it&#39;s time to get our local h-s<br/>
support group leadership involved, so, I&#39;ll keep ya&#39;ll posted (yes, I have a<br/>
heavy southern drawl) ...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m In ! I took my kids to the library a few weeks back and gave my<br/>
daughter<br/>
&gt; my teachers card to check out her mandi books on ( 5th grade chapter<br/>
books )<br/>
&gt; the librarian told her she would have to check them out on her personal<br/>
card<br/>
&gt; because the teacher card was only for teaching items???? I said uh hello<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; homeschool, as far as we are concerned everything they read is  a teaching<br/>
&gt; item! duh some people are just so how shall we say   IN THE BOX! I am so<br/>
&gt; glad to be out of it!!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Redwall and Kipling aren&#39;t appropriate?  What is that person smoking?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lynda, who hopes you find the head librarian and serve the other one&#39;s<br/>
head<br/>
&gt; &gt;to them on a platter!<br/>
