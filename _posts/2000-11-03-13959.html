<br/>
Have you checked out the book &quot;Don&#39;t Know Much About History : Everything<br/>
You Need to Know About American History but Never Learned&quot; by Kenneth C.<br/>
Davis?? I just got it from a used book store and haven&#39;t read it yet, but I<br/>
read his book on the Civil War (from the same series) and it was really<br/>
fascinating. It might be too dry for 11 and 15 year olds, but maybe not. He<br/>
fills it with good anecdotes and answers commonly held myths (for instance,<br/>
in the Civil War book, he had a subchapter heading &quot;Was Jefferson Davis<br/>
really captured wearing a dress?&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
For Native American studies, when I was a teenager I really loved reading a<br/>
book (novel) called &quot;Hanta Yo&quot; by Ruth Beebe Hill. It&#39;s very long and quite<br/>
deep (for a novel), set in the Lakotah nation. It has been translated fully<br/>
into Lakotah and back out to English, which makes it read differently than a<br/>
novel written purely in English. Depending on how interested your teenager<br/>
is, he might like it. Warning, it does address some fairly serious issues<br/>
that you might have to talk about - sex, war, torture, etc. or might not<br/>
want a child reading (depending on your viewpoints I guess). It covers many<br/>
of the rituals, songs, etc. of the tribal life in a way that non-fiction<br/>
books really can&#39;t, giving at least a small feel for a way of life so very<br/>
different from modern culture.<br/>
