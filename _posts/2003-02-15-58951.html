<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399052599">If anyone really cares to know exactly how I post and what I have said on <br/>
this list, just take a look through the archives.  One could find everything <br/>
I&#39;ve posted on this group by entering my email address in the search archives <br/>
option. Yeah, its A LOT of stuff, and I certainly wouldn&#39;t expect anyone to <br/>
try to read it.  But, even glancing though it is enough to see that I am NOT <br/>
what I have been portrayed as.  I don&#39;t consider myself a negative force on <br/>
this group. Yes, my conflict with Sandra and her followers is definitely <br/>
negative, but I don&#39;t feel it any of it was instigated by me.  Reacted to by <br/>
me, sometimes OVER reacted to, yes... Defensive, yes.  But a persecution <br/>
syndrome?  Please, don&#39;t offer psychoanalysis of me based on my interaction <br/>
with a few folks via email. And if you are going to judge me by the posts I <br/>
make on this list. let it be an all inclusive list of what I&#39;ve said, not <br/>
exclusive of the conflicts I&#39;ve had with a few folks.  <br/>

I think a little more self reflection would be helpful if you&#39;re saying <br/>
nothing was instigated by you.<br/>
And I take HUGE offense to your repeated use of the term &quot;her followers&quot;. I <br/>
am not a follower of anyone. But strangely enough, people that can post <br/>
clear, useful information I find extremely helpful.<br/>
You seem to respect Joyces voice, but she&#39;s trying to coach you over and over <br/>
and over and you are seeming to IGNORE the advice. None of it&#39;s your fault. <br/>
OK, but a really freaky post after someone suggest that PERHAPS genetics or <br/>
modeling is to blame for a childs difficulties is not instigating anything. <br/>
Yikes.<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
