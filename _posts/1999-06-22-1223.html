<div id="ygrps-yiv-738853674">Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I noticed Sandra Dodd on this list -- HI!! :-))<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don&#39;t already know me,  My name is Monica Molinar.<br/>
I am married, about to celebrate my 14th anniversary, and have 3 sons:<br/>
Zac (11), Luke (9), and Tristan (almost 3).  We live in North Pole,<br/>
Alaska, where, at the time of this writing, it is an absolutely<br/>
beautiful day!<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone on this list with a strong knowledge of bugs and<br/>
insects?  I need to know where to learn about ladybugs (in particular,<br/>
ladybug reproduction), and where to find out more information about a<br/>
tiny, bright yellow spider we discovered that was the exact same color<br/>
as the buttercup flowersat the edge of my lawn.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Monica</div>

Hi, Monica -<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was the summer solstice.  Did the sun set in your part of Alaska at <br/>
all?  Here in N. Ca. it was fully dark at 9:15.<br/>

Sorry, don&#39;t have any about lady bugs, but now that you mention it it does<br/>
sound interesting.<br/>
I found lots of the critters hanging around in our yard on these pages,<br/>
among others, even though their focus is not this country.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I will also take this opportunity to introduce myself, I&#39;m also new<br/>
to this list.  My name is Jenn and I have 1 6yob, and we have just<br/>
started... well, not schooling.  He had a very traumatic Kindergarten year<br/>
at ps and we are both trying to deschool I think.  If anyone has any gems of<br/>
wisdom to share to help me relax and get over my school notions I would<br/>
welcome it.  I have done a lot of reading, which included the HEM and<br/>
unschool sites, and I know that unschooling is what I want for Josh.  The<br/>
only problem we are having is me, since I was brought up in a classic &quot;bring<br/>
home an A - there is only one right way to do things home&quot;.  Josh on the<br/>
other hand is doing just fine with his &quot;schooling&quot;  =)<br/>
<br/>

Blessings,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This will be sort of long so hang in there, I found a bit about lady bugs,<br/>
but it says nothing about reproduction just about eggs<br/>
here it goes<br/>
Ladybug:<br/>
a sign of good luck &quot;Lady-bird, will Sunday be a nice day?&quot; If the ladybug<br/>
(as lady-bird beetles are usually called) flies away before you can ask the<br/>
question three times. the weather will be fair for the weekend. The English<br/>
call the ladybug the &quot;beetle of Our Lady,&quot; the Germans call it the &quot;child of<br/>
Our Lord.&quot; the Italians &quot; Modanna&#39;s chick&quot; This pretty little insect has<br/>
always been considered a sign of good fortune. One reason is probably that<br/>
its appearance comes in the first days of spring. In addition. it feeds on<br/>
plant lice, aphids, and many other insects harmful to plants. It is even<br/>
raised for this purpose in some places.<br/>
<br/>
There are hundreds of species of ladybugs. They differ in size and in the<br/>
color and number of spots on their wing cases. There can be anywhere from<br/>
two to 24 spots. In the summer the ladybug flies all day from tree to tree,<br/>
from flower to flower. It eats unbelievable numbers of insects. In winter,<br/>
groups of 50-100 hibernate under a piece of bark or in some similar shelter.<br/>
The females lay three to 50 eggs on the backs of leaves, When attacked, the<br/>
ladybug has an unusual way of defending itself. It spits a nasty-smelling<br/>
liquid at its enemy, which usually retreats in disgust.<br/>
PHYLUM: Arthropoda<br/>
CLASS: Insecta<br/>
ORDER Coleoptera<br/>
FAMILY: Coccinellidae<br/>
CHARACTERISTICS: round or oval body<br/>
LENGTH: TO 0.4 INCH<br/>
BRIGHTLY COLORED- BLACK, YELLOW, RED<br/>
EGGS: OPEN IN 1 WEEK,<br/>
LARVAL STAGE: 3 WEEKS<br/>
 I hope this will help at least a little this information comes from the<br/>
illustrated wildlife treasury I picked up at a garage sale for $2.00!!!<br/>
packed full of info on all kinds of bugs and animals from a-z!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037621090">Hi, Monica, and welcome! I am unschooling our 16yod.<br/>
<br/>
We lived on Adak for three years back in the late &#39;80&#39;s. Our kids were<br/>
4, 7, and 10 at the time. It was a great experience living on an island,<br/>
not to mention our trips to the mainland. We visited North Pole (is the<br/>
Christmas Shop still there? I could *kick* myself for not buying some of<br/>
those chocolate sets) and Denali, and spent a good bit of time in<br/>
Anchorage as well. We love Alaska!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854353564">Hey Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list and have been trying to keep up merely by reading <br/>
all the posts - finally have time to post myself.  We&#39;re relatively <br/>
new to homeschooling as well.  Pulled our daughter out in Fall of <br/>
2000, and then our son in Fall of 2001 (Sabra 10, Gino 9, Domenic <br/>
3).  <br/>
<br/>
I love everything I&#39;ve read about unschooling, and am trying to <br/>
implement this philosophy in our home.  I have truly enjoyed, and am <br/>
learning so much from reading the postings on this list.  It&#39;s great <br/>
to hear from people who are completely confident in their decision to <br/>
unschool - and have successfully made it their lifestyle - exactly <br/>
the type of inspiration I was looking for!<br/>
<br/>
I have so many questions.  I think I&#39;ll send them under different <br/>
subject headings though.  (new to email lists and yahoogroups as <br/>
well!)<br/>

I&#39;ve been lurking for a week now and want to come out of the closet.

So you&#39;ll see a few postings to follow with subjects from the past week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we are homeschoolers (definate unschoolers) here in NY (an hour north of Manhattan).  I like to say we&#39;ve unschooled from the beginning.  Just a way of life with our two girls (5 & 10).  Didn&#39;t know there was a label for what we were doing until meeting fellow LLL moms my first year out as a new mom.  Then discovering a &quot;continuum concept&quot; and &quot;unschoolers&quot; group in the area (well an hours drive for each - but well worth it).<br/>
<br/>
I am trully enjoying the threads and look forward to being a part of the community.<br/>
