<div id="ygrps-yiv-770842480">Today when we were in Kroger,Shawn asked me what the ATM machines were. I told him they were ATM machines that grownups use to get money out of the bank. He asked if kids could too and I told him that most kids don&#39;t have money in the bank, because they have to work to get money and then save it and then they can put it in the bank, so no. He then said &quot;I want my own money.&quot; I said we&#39;d need to talk to daddy to see what special jobs we could find for him to make money.<br/>
<br/>
When we left he said he wanted to borrow a movie from Blockbuster. I asked him where his money is and he said he didn&#39;t have any. So I offered a deal. I&#39;d rent the movie for him and when we get home he would vaccum the bathroom and the kitchen to pay for the movie. He agreed. He rented Walking with Dinasours...which he has seen before. When we got home he vaccumed the bathroom, but balked a bit at the kitchen. He was tired and it seemed really big, so I helped him some. <br/>
<br/>
All this simply to ask others what you do to encourage work ethic and to help them learn the value of money. Also, should I be surprised at his desire at this age? He&#39;s only 3.5.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969818331">Hi, all,<br/>
<br/>
After I wrote the last post, I remembered that a friend had written<br/>
yesterday asking for a Euro coin.  She wanted it for her daughter for<br/>
Christmas.  I always got a coin from Santa in my stocking, and I know that<br/>
coins are important in other holiday traditions, too.<br/>
<br/>
If anybody wants to surprise a child with totally different money for the<br/>
holidays, I&#39;d be happy to help.  Euros come in 1 and 2 euro denominatios,<br/>
about $1 or $2, and those two in particular are cool, since one is gold<br/>
ringed in silver and one is silver ringed in gold.  There is small coinage,<br/>
too, but it&#39;s not so cool.<br/>
<br/>
Send me an email off list about what you want, or just mail me a dollar (or<br/>
2, depending what you want!).  I&#39;ll pay the postage back, it won&#39;t be much.<br/>

That&#39;s my US military address.  It only needs regular 1st class U.S.<br/>
postage.  Mail is supposed to take a week each way, but can take up to 4<br/>
(ugh), so plan that into your timing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, does anybody here have Indonesian connections?  That&#39;s the coins mine<br/>
wants Santa to bring in his stocking.  Yikes!<br/>
