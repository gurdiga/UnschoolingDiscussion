<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931296426">&lt;&lt;Julie:  Are there any websites you could direct me to concerning your<br/>
beliefs?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, I&#39;m the only one who believes like I do.  Surely there<br/>
must be more, but I&#39;m unaware of them.  I worship Lutheran and attend an<br/>
organized church because my children like it.  I tend to keep my mouth shut<br/>
a lot  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097300140"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;We finally got the Jan/Feb issue out the door to the printer, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s another terrific one. It&#39;s a good feeling to have all these many<br/>
parts and pieces - articles, columns, photos, ads, letters, etc. come<br/>
together into a nice, cohesive whole. Still just amazes me how we<br/>
keep managing to pull it off after almost 20 years at this - and we<br/>
still get just as big a kick out of wrapping up an issue as we did<br/>
back in 1984! &lt;g&gt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Congrats!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Nice to see this list didn&#39;t implode. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No,  actually it appears quite a few &#39;new&#39; voices are speaking up.....like a<br/>
plant with new growth.  Hope it doesn&#39;t get choked out by the sense of<br/>
righteousness and argumentativeness that can still be seen at times (I&#39;m<br/>
trying to ignore it myself.....not always easy especially when coping with<br/>
an aggravating headcold which was not in my &#39;plan&#39; for the holidays!!)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Had an interesting encounter yesterday while getting my brakes fixed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>down at the local tire shop. &lt;snip&gt;... I was beginning to wonder if I&#39;d<br/>
unconsciously frowned at the word &#39;school&#39; or something to invoke<br/>
such a defensive reaction.<br/>
<br/>
 this lady&#39;s intensity has been<br/>
making me wonder whether or not it&#39;s a good thing that homeschooling<br/>
is perceived as so... I dunno... wholesome? Unimpeachable? (Where&#39;s<br/>
that damn thesaurus when I need it? &lt;g&gt;)&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Had a similar experience at our family doc&#39;s office a few weeks ago when I<br/>
took the baby for a well check.  Our family physicain is a true gem.  His is<br/>
a homeschooling family,  and we always chat about how things are going with<br/>
that.  It&#39;s great to not have to put on that generic &quot;homeschooling is<br/>
great&quot; face and say things are terrific ....which is what I do for most<br/>
people I think would not really understand.<br/>
    Our doc said his sister was in to get her teenaged son checked and he<br/>
wanted to introduce us.  His sister and I have a mutual friend......anyway,<br/>
I was talking with her and eventually asked if she homeschooled.  She got a<br/>
funny look on her face and gave the ol&#39; &quot;Well, I could never do that.  It<br/>
wouldn&#39;t work for my family.  I don&#39;t know how you do it...I want you to<br/>
know I really admire you for what you&#39;re doing!&quot;  This said with a look<br/>
which I read to say.....&quot;you must be crazy to take on such a monumantal<br/>
undertaking....and you must be *something else* to be able to have your kids<br/>
around 24-7.&quot;<br/>
    I was taken aback somewhat...I got a strange feeling in my gut ...and in<br/>
my head thought,  &quot;Look lady,  I&#39;m  a mother, as you are,  and I love my<br/>
children.  And not sending them to school does NOT put me in the category of<br/>
untouchable saint with supreme patience.  We just chose a different<br/>
lifestyle...in fact,  I don&#39;t know how *you* manage with four children in<br/>
three different schools.&quot; [Her children are older than mine - one<br/>
elementary, one in middle school and two in high school.)  Of course,  all I<br/>
could muster was &quot;uh, ..well, thanks.&quot;<br/>
    This whole scene keeps coming back to me for similar reasons to what you<br/>
mentioned, Helen.  I remember thinking later that the whole thing was so<br/>
strange.....wondering why she seemed to put me and this lifestyle on some<br/>
sort of pedestal.  I have decided I need to be prepared for these types of<br/>
encounters. maybe we (listmembers) can come up with responses which may be<br/>
ready.<br/>
    I&#39;m aware of my own guarded statements with aquaintences vested in the<br/>
school process....I notice I usually say how &#39;great&#39; everything is with<br/>
&#39;homeschooling&#39; (goodness knows what they&#39;d think of unschooling!!)  With<br/>
friends,  I can always talk about some of the trade-offs of this lifestyle<br/>
vs. a &#39;school&#39; one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;On the one hand I think it&#39;s great that homeschooling has such a warm<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fuzzy rep, but on the other hand I worry about this attitude<br/>
backfiring, people going overboard to justify their decision NOT to<br/>
homeschool, and weighing in even more heavily on the school - even<br/>
alternative school - side of the issue.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is tough....I have one friend who used to proclaim,  &quot;I could never do<br/>
that!&quot;  She has seen at least four friends move into or engage in a<br/>
homeschooling lifestyle.  And it&#39;s challenged her to see a) that she *could*<br/>
do it;  and b) that her friends who have done it are happy with this<br/>
lifestyle.<br/>
    I know for myself,  I do love this lifestyle....and couldn&#39;t imagine the<br/>
stress of coping with my children in a school system...all the<br/>
parent-teacher politics,   the competition between children....and between<br/>
parents,  the car-pooling,  the schedule,  the &#39;after-school&#39; activities.<br/>
Yet I know I present the ever-rosy &quot;Homeschooling is GREAT!&quot; to those I feel<br/>
sort of defensive around (teacher-types -or the I-could-never-do-that<br/>
types),  even when going throug a rough spot.<br/>
<br/>
    I can say that as I gain more experience and insight,  I gain confidence<br/>
in my conviction that this lifestyle is more peaceful for our family - and<br/>
would possibly be for many others.  And that &quot;I could never do that&quot; comes<br/>
from a total lack of understanding - the &quot;school&quot; mentality is deeply<br/>
ingrained!! (myself included...at least for me it&#39;s past tense now).<br/>
<br/>
    I remember once a t a seminar...the presenting couple had nine children<br/>
and homeschooled.  I was sitting with some friends I knew since<br/>
college...and they seemed thoroughly amazed at this.... and I said,  &quot;Think<br/>
about it....with nine children,  homeschooling HAS to be simpler than<br/>
juggling infants, preschoolers, elementary,  middle and high schoolers -<br/>
just in terms of packing lunches, dressing everyone,  and getting them where<br/>
they are supposed to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My ramblings......interested to hear other&#39;s perpectives.  Have a great day!<br/>
