<div id="ygrps-yiv-808662391"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Karin, my boys fight and often get physical, too.  In fact, that usually<br/>
 &gt;is what &quot;raises my hackles&quot;.  I think you have the answer when you say<br/>
 &gt;you deal with it day by day and minute by minute.  There really are no<br/>
 &gt;pat answers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One that I heard after the older ones were grown was to sit the two<br/>
fighting kids facing each other and just out of reach.  They have to stay<br/>
there until they both agree on a resolution.  I don&#39;t know how it would<br/>
work in practise though.<br/>
