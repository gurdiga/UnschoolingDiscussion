<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482032453">Hello All, <br/>
<br/>
My name is Rachel and am a single parent who works from home. I have <br/>
an 11 year old son- David. We reside in West Virginia, USA. I pulled <br/>
my son out of PS in Dec 04. I started the traditional homeschooling <br/>
(ie- using county books) in Jan- with failure. I know, now, part of <br/>
it is not taking the time to &#39;deschool&#39;. But the more I looked around <br/>
at ways people homeschool, I think unschooling might just be up our <br/>
alley. My son was diagnosed adhd in Kindergarten, repeated 1st grade <br/>
(due to maturity and at suggestion of his teacher who also was friend <br/>
of family). He&#39;s been medicated since K. I am still medicating but <br/>
slowly lowering medication. <br/>
<br/>
D has always had anger management issues- especially at come off meds <br/>
time. He tends to be destructive and verbally irrate (to put it <br/>
mildy). A few months ago I came upon an idea to help both of us calm <br/>
down in these situations. I said why don&#39;t we try calling a word and <br/>
when that word is called we both have to stop what we are doing and <br/>
have a time out. D agreed and we proceeded to look for our word. We <br/>
hit the childrens&#39; encylopedia. Just turning pages closing our eyes <br/>
and pointing. We finally found &quot;OUR&quot; word- ZENO - to be precise-<br/>
 &quot;Zeno of Citium (c.340- c.265 BC)- Greek philosppher. He founded the <br/>
Stoic school of philosophy, so named because he taught in the Stoa <br/>
Poikile (Painted Colonade) market place, Athens. Zeno saw the world <br/>
as one organic whole and declared that man&#39;s duty was to live in <br/>
peace and harmony with the rest of nature.&quot; Over the past few months <br/>
we have refined our ZENO method. <br/>
<br/>
1. Call ZENO<br/>
2. Turn on Cd with soothing music<br/>
3. Get our paper, pens, pencils, and art stuff on table<br/>
4. Whoever called it tells the reason they called it<br/>
5. Set timer for 5-10 minutes<br/>
6. Individually write or draw or express our feelings in some manner <br/>
and tell in some way what &quot;I&quot; could have done differently (we try to <br/>
avoid telling what someone else did or could have done)<br/>
7. Timer goes off<br/>
8. Each discusses our feelings<br/>
9. Each tell what we could have done differently<br/>
10. That&#39;s it- the anger is gone and we each feel a whole lot better!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes our days are busy with things that have to be done away <br/>
from home and we can&#39;t always do this method. But I can sure tell you <br/>
that it hurts when we can&#39;t and there are bad feelings in the air. I <br/>
just thought we need to come up with a quick-y zeno method. I&#39;ll talk <br/>
to D when he wakes up. <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to share that method of calming anger.  I am also going <br/>
to post this at unschooling message board so please forgive me if you <br/>
recieve it twice. <br/>
<br/>
Be Well,<br/>
Rachel<br/>
Please Don&#39;t Take Your Organs to Heaven,<br/>
Heaven Knows We Need Them Here!</div>

she began the practice of &#39;hat time&#39;.  She said that<br/>
once a week or more often, she and her son would put<br/>
on hats, then sit at a table and remove the hats.  The<br/>
hats were &#39;mother hat&#39; and &#39;son hat&#39; and when they<br/>
were removed, they could talk about anything, any way,<br/>
without the constraints of usual roles.  Your ZENO<br/>
reminded me of that, Rachel.  Thanks!<br/>
