I&#39;m beginning to crave salad...<br/>
<br/>
No, it wasn&#39;t you who said &quot;justify&quot;.  My mistake and, really, I don&#39;t want<br/>
anyone justifying themselves to me for any reason.  I would like to know why<br/>
someone (not necessarily you, Elizabeth) would WANT to call themselves an<br/>
unschooler if they are not actually unschooling with their child(ren).  What<br/>
is the appeal?<br/>
Why not just say we follow up on the kids&#39; interests, but have a<br/>
parent-driven curriculum, or some such thing?<br/>
<br/>
As to your question, no, for us it is not about providing an educational<br/>
environment.  It is about living together, enjoying each other&#39;s company,<br/>
and experiencing the world around us.  It&#39;s a philosophy that we live by.<br/>
Does that mean we&#39;ve given our souls?  Maybe we&#39;ve just found a place where<br/>
our souls are comfortable :).<br/>

philosophy, and uses that philosophy when it works for us. It&#39;s not about<br/>
giving your soul to unschooling. It&#39;s about providing an educational<br/>
environment for you kids. Isn&#39;t it?<br/>
