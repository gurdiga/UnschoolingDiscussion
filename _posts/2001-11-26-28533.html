<div id="ygrps-yiv-902072493">** Its nothing you&#39;re doing, you&#39;re just being a moppet. Do you think <br/>
                      we can work this out and I get some mamma time?**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if some of this is just about personalities or family <br/>
style.  My kids would cringe at &quot;you&#39;re just being a moppet.&quot;  Even as <br/>
little kids they always expected me to take them as seriously (not <br/>
talking NCP, just normal usage) as I would an adult.  I know other <br/>
families that relate differently with good results, and I have no idea <br/>
whether that&#39;s personality, environment, or some combination.<br/>
<br/>
This may have something to do with ages too... Lisa was probably much <br/>
more patient with 1000 interruptions when her kids were really little.  <br/>
She&#39;always been very patient when my 5 year old interrupts her over and <br/>
over.  <br/>
<br/>
Talking things through doesn&#39;t always have to be about blaming, whether <br/>
we talk about it immediately or later, along with or apart from <br/>
apologies.<br/>
