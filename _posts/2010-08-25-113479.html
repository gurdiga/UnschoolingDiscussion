<div id="ygrps-yiv-392161012">I read this post with interest.  I should first introduce myself.  My name is Theresa and I have a daughter who is 9 years old.  Usually she is very <br/>
much the introvert but lately she has been showing more confidence.  <br/>
<br/>
The thing that interested me in the going back to school post Sandra made was the comment about friendships.  For a long time I have been pining for homeschooling or unschooling friendships.  I find with a lot of friendships my daughter and I have there is a lot of disagreemant regarding bedtimes, sugar, learning to read, respect etc.  The list goes on.  <br/>
<br/>
But lately I&#39;ve been feeling staying with just unschooled friends is very limiting.  I feel like we are living in a segregated world that we are keeping ourselves trapped in. The only thing is I do get tired of trying to explain why we don&#39;t have the same bedtimes or philosophy regarding candy and movies. What do you do?</div>

<br/>
Come up with some brief responses.  &quot;We like to let her decide.&quot;  Or  <br/>
&quot;we think she can sleep any eight hours she wants, since she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
need to get up for school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or you could have cards with URLs of sites that describe unschooling  <br/>
and make the offer to discuss it more if they&#39;re really interested.    <br/>
(Meaning after they read the links.)<br/>
<br/>
You can say &quot;Right now, we&#39;re doing it this way,&quot; and not try to  <br/>
defend an intent to do it forever and ever.<br/>
I used to say &quot;If this stops working, we&#39;ll do something else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I have now NOT &quot;done something else&quot; for 19 years.  &lt;bwg&gt;   All  <br/>
three of my kids grew past school age without having gone to school,  <br/>
and without using a curriculum.   I&#39;m a little giddy sometimes.  It&#39;s  <br/>
awesome.<br/>

I just don&#39;t talk about that stuff around people who don&#39;t really understand it. <br/>
 I don&#39;t flaunt what we do either.  Honestly, I&#39;ve met more unschoolers who get <br/>
all worked up over sugar than the regular Joe homeschooling mom does.  I can&#39;t <br/>
explain that, it&#39;s just been my experience.  Most of the homeschooling moms that <br/>
I&#39;ve met have loved baked goods and cookies and all that stuff.  Movies and TV <br/>
and bedtimes are a different story.  I grew up with strict bedtimes and TV <br/>
limitations so, even though I don&#39;t do that to my kids, it&#39;s something I <br/>
understand.<br/>

OH!  That&#39;s awesome.   The image of &quot;all worked up.&quot;<br/>
Regardless of whether they&#39;re unschoolers or not, ANY mom who can get  <br/>
&quot;all worked up&quot; so easily and swears to high heaven that her child IS  <br/>
affected by sugar, horribly so, dangerously so, is probably fishing  <br/>
for justification for being &quot;all worked up.&quot;  And if she gets over her  <br/>
supersitious fear of sugar, she&#39;ll move on to something else, because  <br/>
she&#39;s used to being all worked up.<br/>
<br/>
And whether it&#39;s nature or nurture, she might more likely have  <br/>
children who become &quot;all worked up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to be jittery when the people around you are jittery.   <br/>
It&#39;s easier to be calm when the people around you are calm.  Ditto  <br/>
&quot;afraid,&quot; &quot;happy,&quot; &quot;giggly...&quot;<br/>
