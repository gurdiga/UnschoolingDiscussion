Dear friends:<br/>
<br/>
Please forgive the form letter, but I want to get this out to you as quickly<br/>
as possible, and on my 50th birthday! Let me take this opportunity to thank<br/>
you all for contributing to my project to help families in southeast India<br/>
build their own cyclone-proof housing under the auspices of Land for the<br/>
Tillers Freedom (LAFTI), which was founded by my mother and father<br/>
Krishnamal and S. Jagannathan.<br/>
<br/>
I called them on the third day of Pongal (South Indian Thanksgiving) to<br/>
announce that we had raised all the necessary funds for the brickmaking<br/>
machine.  My brother, a psychiatrist working with children of war victims in<br/>
Cambodia but home for the holidays said that they were ready and planned to<br/>
build 8,000 houses in three years.  My mother, standing in the background,<br/>
yelled into the telephone �Two years!�  This will really be a dream come<br/>
true for 11,000 families who, even twenty years ago, could not have even<br/>
dreamed of eating three square meals a day, no less owning their own land,<br/>
starting cottage industries, or having real roofs over their heads.<br/>
<br/>
More good news: with funds raised from sales of my book (�And the Skylark<br/>
Sings with Me� � visit my website at www.skylarksings.com for more<br/>
information � credit card orders now accepted), I was able to purchase two<br/>
used portable computers for LAFTI�s  offices.  This will enable the foster<br/>
kids to communicate with their supporting families (who are mostly in<br/>
Italy), for LAFTI to communicate with funders and supporters more<br/>
effectively, and my father to stay in touch with ecological organizations<br/>
and developments around the world.  A friend from my Quaker meeting was kind<br/>
enough to transport the computers, which should have arrived today.<br/>
<br/>
But now for the biggest news of all: on Wednesday, I received an e-mail from<br/>
Sweden, informing me that Krishnamal and S. Jagannathan had been nominated<br/>
for the Year 2000 International Right Livelihood Award.  The Right<br/>
Livelihood Award is best known as the �Alternative Nobel Peace Prize�, and<br/>
is given to individuals and groups �offering practical and exemplary answers<br/>
to the crucial problems facing the world today.� It is awarded at ceremony<br/>
before the Swedish Parliament the day before the Nobel Prize presentations.<br/>
A list of previous winners since 1980 reads like a who�s who of the best of<br/>
ecology, community development, human rights, peace, and justice programs<br/>
worldwide.  (To read more about the Award, visit www.rightlivelihood.se)<br/>
<br/>
The e-mail I received from the Director, Kerstin Bennett, specifically<br/>
solicited letters of support.  So I invite those who know of the efforts of<br/>
my parents and LAFTI to please write to the Awards Administrative Office.<br/>
They said they prefer to receive letters by mail.  Send to: International<br/>
Jurors, Right Livelihood Award, c/o Kerstin Bennett, Administrative<br/>
Director, Administrative Office, PO Box 15072, S-104 65 Stockholm, Sweden.<br/>
If you can�t write a letter, an e-mail will do: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:info@...">info@...</a><br/>
Enclosed you will find a sample letter which I hope you can improve on.  And<br/>
if you can�t see your way to writing your own letter, I hope you will<br/>
consider signing and sending this one along.  (P.S. -- just ask, and I&#39;ll<br/>
forward the letter to you in WORD.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all of you for making this best 50th birthday celebration<br/>
I�ve ever had! (I can�t wait for the next one!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

(P.S. Tax-deductible donations to the Gandhian Foundation are still being<br/>
accepted and will be used for purchase more tools needed in the<br/>
housebuilding program.  Thanks!<br/>

International Jurors<br/>
Right Livelihood Award<br/>
c/o Kerstin Bennett � Administrative Director<br/>
PO Box 15072<br/>
S-104 65 Stockholm<br/>
Sweden<br/>
<br/>
Dear Distinguished Jurors:<br/>
<br/>
I am writing to you to support the nomination of S. and Krishnamal<br/>
Jagannathan and the Land for the Tillers Freedom (LAFTI) organization to<br/>
receive the Year 2000 Right Livelihood Award.<br/>
<br/>
The work of the Jagannathans on behalf of the poorest of the poor people of<br/>
South India now spans some six decades.  Through their tireless efforts,<br/>
thousands of families � many of whom were landless for up to forty<br/>
generations � now are able to own and till their own land, provide for their<br/>
families, and build strong, vibrant communities. And they can do so not as a<br/>
result of government largesse or large scale international assistance, but<br/>
through their own labor.  The Jagannathans have returned to the people<br/>
themselves a sense of their own power and the responsibility that comes with<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
The Jagannathans are a living example of what it means to do more with<br/>
less.  They have, with the support of their communities but without any<br/>
institutional or organizational backing, confronted major ecological<br/>
devastation caused by multinational corporations and assisted by<br/>
governmental indifference, and in the face of overwhelming odds, have<br/>
prevailed.  In doing so, they have educated their communities on the<br/>
importance of being forever vigilant, and the power of committed communities<br/>
willing to stand together and, harnessing the power of nonviolent action,<br/>
confronting obstacles in the path of sustainability.<br/>
<br/>
As you know, LAFTI was literally formed out of ashes � the deliberate<br/>
burning to death of 43 women and children who were rounded up and locked in<br/>
a house which was then set afire in the village of Killevanmani in 1968. To<br/>
this day, Krishnamal Jagannathan says she carries the light of those 43<br/>
women and children in her heart, and sees this light growing stronger in the<br/>
faces of the thousands of children who now know a freedom they never would<br/>
have imagined even a generation ago.  In honoring the Jagannathans, who are<br/>
now in the 90s and 70s respectively and still going strong, the Right<br/>
Livelihood Award would be honoring the memory of these women and children,<br/>
and help the flame of human rights, justice, and community and ecological<br/>
sustainability blaze ever so much more brightly, both for their descendants<br/>
and for generations to come<br/>
<br/>
I do hope you will give this nomination the most careful and favorable<br/>
deliberation.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely yours,</div>
