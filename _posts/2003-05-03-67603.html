<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024788845">My 10yo doesn&#39;t do much &quot;sustained silent reading&quot;, which has been one of my <br/>
nagging worries since she stopped going to school halfway through fourth <br/>
grade. I think back to the big books that I had to read at her age, and think <br/>
what she chooses is junkfood in words. A product of my own schooling. Lately <br/>
she has been reading what interests her, like Lizzie McGuire paperbacks. <br/>
Short and easy. And doesn&#39;t always finish them. I know I shouldn&#39;t worry <br/>
about it. <br/>
<br/>
She stayed up half the night the other night reading her Disney Adventures <br/>
magazine. I can&#39;t ever remember reading half the night something that I found <br/>
interesting, only staying up to late to finish some boring book that I was <br/>
assigned and procrastinated with. <br/>
<br/>
She just read three Captain Underpants books in a day and a half. I had no <br/>
idea how funny the books were, until she read aloud to me her favorite parts. <br/>
I was actually impressed with the vocabulary and adult humor in them. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not worried so much anymore. :0)<br/>

If so, we&#39;ve got it covered. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son is now 11 but I wanted to offer what we did.<br/>
Dustin hated reading until last year. I think what got the love for reading <br/>
going was the Harry Potter books and especially Captain Underpants series. He <br/>
took them and I think he wanted to impress me with how many he read that he <br/>
did three in one night. The next night was the same and so on. He stops and <br/>
goes in spurts. Now he is reading a documentary on the Navy Seals and before <br/>
he read Halo.  I dont think if the school saw him now if they would believe <br/>
me but its true. <br/>
My main silent wishes for him this year was reading and for our family to be <br/>
closer. So far I am thrilled with how it has all come together.<br/>
With my son we found out that when he read out loud he didn&#39;t remember much. <br/>
His silent reading was much better in comprehension. Your son may be the <br/>
opposite. <br/>
Maybe he will never take interest in reading to himself but I also think that <br/>
if they have something that interests them it will happen.<br/>
When I stopped worrying about the book thing is when he took off with it. He <br/>
read magazines, comic books, gamer guides and others.<br/>
<br/>
Give him time it will happen.<br/>
