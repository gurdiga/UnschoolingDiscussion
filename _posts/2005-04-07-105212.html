<div id="ygrps-yiv-885698586">Curious question:  My daughter and I are new to unschooling and every <br/>
day I understand more and more how it works and she has shown me that <br/>
she will find things she is passionate about and will go non-stop <br/>
reseaching about it and loves every minute of it.  I think this will be <br/>
the best thing ever for her and I&#39;m very excited to see what she comes <br/>
up with next!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had this nagging thought in the back of my head that&#39;s been <br/>
bothering me though:  When she grows up and has &quot;grown up&quot; <br/>
responsibilities, will it be hard for her to do things that she isn&#39;t <br/>
passionate about - things that a lot of adults really don&#39;t want to do <br/>
like paying bills on time or cleaning the house or taking out the trash <br/>
etc....I&#39;d love to say well, cooking doesn&#39;t interest me so I&#39;m not <br/>
going to do it - my passion is scrapbooking so I&#39;ll do that instead - <br/>
but of course I can&#39;t, I have to feed my family - does this make any <br/>
sense???</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23791010">My 20 year old unschooled daughter grew up disorganized and impetuous <br/>
and I worried a lot that she&#39;d never be &quot;responsible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She now keeps a detailed calendar, budgets her money carefully, takes a <br/>
full-time course load at her university, meets a LOT of different <br/>
obligations for various organizations and social activities and she&#39;s <br/>
held several jobs and has been considered an outstanding employee.<br/>
<br/>
She tries to do all these things - the regular life kinds of things - <br/>
as efficiently as possible to leave the MOST possible time for those <br/>
things about which she is passionate. She had to make some mistakes - <br/>
she didn&#39;t keep good track of her checking account at first, for <br/>
example. And she had to find a good calendaring method that worked well <br/>
for her. But - she learned. Now she exercises on a regular basis, eats <br/>
healthy foods, gets all her assignments for college courses in on time <br/>
and doesn&#39;t usually have to stay up at night to do them, works at a <br/>
good job related to her future career plans, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So - this wasn&#39;t intended to be bragging - this is to tell you that it <br/>
IS possible and that it is, in fact, wanting the maximum possible <br/>
opportunities to follow her own passions that motivates her to BE <br/>
responsible and organized. AND - tonight she cleaned the kitchen. <br/>
Cheerfully. WOW! And she went to bed early because, she said, &quot;I have a <br/>
really long day tomorrow and want to make sure I&#39;m rested.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045984690">I see my daughter doing stuff she&#39;s not passionate about now. There are a<br/>
lot of different motivations. She wants to help me, wants to play on the<br/>
messy dining room table, wants animals to be safe (her motivation for<br/>
climbing into ditches yesterday and grabbing garbage). It&#39;s not that<br/>
everything she does needs to have an intense interest behind it, but it does<br/>
need a purpose that appeals to and makes sense to her.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where I have the problem with, &quot;some things just need to be done,<br/>
like it or not,&quot; line. It doesn&#39;t offer any reasonable explanation why they<br/>
should be done. You&#39;re just expected to give in to the idea of drudgery and<br/>
do it. But if Catherine has no problem doing things she might not otherwise<br/>
like because it&#39;s usually made clear that there&#39;s a specific interest behind<br/>
it. She doen&#39;t like picking up her Polly Pocket stuff but she does it<br/>
everytime. Not because she &#39;has&#39; to but because she knows her 3 yr old<br/>
brother also loves Polly Pocket and will run away with tiny boots that may<br/>
never be seen again. Kids don&#39;t need to be passionate to do things, they<br/>
mostly just need honest reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is, so what if your child is a slob through childhood.<br/>
You&#39;re raising a life learner right? A flexible person who can learn and<br/>
adapt to different situations and demands with little trouble hopefully.<br/>
They&#39;ll learn.<br/>

also loves his toys - to drag out into the yard and chew on! <br/>
Although bits of them are indeed often seen again - when I&#39;m <br/>
cleaning the dog poo out of the yard (yup little brightly colored <br/>
bits of plastic in the poo).<br/>
<br/>
I do love that last line: they mostly just need honest reasons. <br/>
Because it&#39;s all really a matter of choice - even the stuff grown <br/>
ups &quot;have to do&quot; is really a choice - you can &#39;choose&#39; to not pay <br/>
bills or taxes or wash clothing or dishes but there are real <br/>
consequences to those choices. The downsides are often worse than <br/>
just doing it and getting it behind you so you have time for other <br/>
things. DS sees me pay bills on a regular basis. He knows I&#39;d rather <br/>
be playing or watching a movie with him or something but he also <br/>
knows that those bills are what keeps the lights on and food on the <br/>
table and cable on the TV and all, so I tell him I have to go bill <br/>
pay and then I&#39;ll play - and he otherwise occupies himself so I can <br/>
get done as quickly as possible.</div>

<br/>
Not really--- &#39;cause you CHOOSE to do the cooking (or order pizza or go <br/>
out or whatever). Do you really think that all those years of forced <br/>
schooling and chores as a child make you cook and pay bills on time? <br/>
REALLY?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you *really* choose to cook because the family&#39;s hungry? Pay <br/>
bills because you don&#39;t want to lose your house or car or electricity? <br/>
Pull weeds because you like an organized garden?<br/>
<br/>
Do you scrapbook 24/7? As much as you love it, could you---REALLY? I <br/>
love working in my garden, checking my bees, playing with my dogs, <br/>
watching movies with my children, grocery shopping, scrapbooking, and <br/>
.... COOKING! &lt;G&gt; As much as I love to do those things, I also take out <br/>
the trash, wash the dishes, sweep and mop and vacuum (well, THOSE as <br/>
little as humanly possible!), and clean toilets. They&#39;re done because I <br/>
like it have it at least minimally clean around here! I CHOOSE to clean <br/>
because I *like* it clean (-ish! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Do your *own* cleaning and cooking and bill-paying joyfully. THAT&#39;S <br/>
what will show your daughter how it&#39;s done!<br/>

I haven&#39;t ever done it or looked into the cost very much, but I have heard that it isn&#39;t very expensive.  Different people have different ideas of what *expensive* is when it comes to the cost of feeding the family, though.  <br/>

~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I think you answered your own question.  You do the things you have to  do, <br/>
even though you don&#39;t want to, because you know doing them will be better  than <br/>
not doing them.<br/>
 <br/>
At the last minute (night before), I asked my mother to drive me to  Little <br/>
Rock, about 3 hours away from here.  I knew Will, who&#39;s 11, would  resist the <br/>
idea of getting up too early, at least at first, so I told her I  would be by <br/>
at 9:00, using the shorthand explanation that that is when Will  would be able <br/>
to be up and ready.  I hadn&#39;t had a chance to talk to him  about it, yet, and <br/>
I knew he likes having information well in advance of change  of plans, and <br/>
this was rather last minute and he may have had plans for his  day.  She didn&#39;t <br/>
like 9:00, because she&#39;s an early riser and can&#39;t really  drive at night so an <br/>
early start (7:00) would be better for her.  After I  told her 9:00, she made <br/>
a semi-sarcastic comment like, &quot;Let me know when the  Little Prince would <br/>
like to get up and I&#39;ll be ready.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
That kind of ticked me off, but I steeled myself so we wouldn&#39;t argue  all <br/>
the way to Little Rock. She cleverly worked the phrase &quot;Little Prince&quot; into  the <br/>
conversation a couple of more times.  I ignored it.<br/>
 <br/>
After that, I phoned my husband (who was watching Will at baseball  practice) <br/>
and told him the situation, and asked him to explain to Will on  the way home <br/>
why we needed to go THAT day and not any other.  When they  came in the house <br/>
later I asked Will if he knew about what was happening in the  morning.  He <br/>
was aware, and didn&#39;t complain.  He knew we&#39;d have  to get up even earlier than <br/>
7:00 to get to my mother&#39;s by then.  I told him  I would get his clean <br/>
clothes out of the dryer and he could wear his clothes to  bed if he wanted, and I <br/>
would just bundle him up in the morning in a blanket and  walk him sleepily to <br/>
the car.  He thought that was a good idea, and decided  to get in the shower <br/>
right then so he would be clean for the next day.<br/>
 <br/>
Later, as I was going up to bed, I found Will in his room setting his alarm  <br/>
clock for 6:05.  He saw me and said, &quot;I&#39;m settimg my clock so you won&#39;t  have <br/>
to wake me up in the morning.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Okay. &lt;g&gt;  His alarm did go off at 6:05 and when I heard it I  helped him get <br/>
dressed and bundled him in a blanket and walked him sleepily to  the car.  <br/>
I&#39;d already started the car and turned on the heated seat so he  would be warm <br/>
and comfy and get another 1/2 hour of sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
He was willing to get on board with the plan, because he knew I was being  <br/>
considerate of what he needed.  He knew his sister-in-law was in the  hospital <br/>
and couldn&#39;t sell the van she needed to sell. He knew I was the best  one to <br/>
handle it.  He knew that the next 2 weeks were booked solid for us  and Thursday <br/>
was the ONLY day we could do this.  He knew WHY what we were  doing had to be <br/>
done that day, with little notice, and he knew all that because  I was <br/>
considerate of him.  And in turn, he was considerate of me AND my  mother.  She <br/>
never even got to know it, because she&#39;d prefer to think that  he was coddled and <br/>
catered to, like a little prince.  My mistake was not  explaining to her that <br/>
I was *simply* taking his needs into consideration, and  thus her sarcastic <br/>
comment.  It&#39;s not the way of the world to take ALL the  needs of children into <br/>
consideration.  But, what goes around, comes  around.  Will has proven that to <br/>
me once again.  <br/>

I&#39;m glad it all worked out well.  Given that your mother was doing you  a <br/>
favor by driving you the three hours, I would have felt somewhat obligated to  be <br/>
considerate of her schedule as well.<br/>
 <br/>
I think that&#39;s the problem we sometimes run into with other adults who do  <br/>
not understand we give our children the same consideration as we do other  <br/>
adults, sometimes more, by seemingly disregarding others schedules and  <br/>
considerations in exchange for a &quot;mere child&quot; who can be willing to bend to  others <br/>
considerations as well.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oooh! Great entrpreneurial opportunity here! I&#39;ll have to check it<br/>
out! I AM a great cook & Dh teases me that I should start a similar <br/>
business.:)<br/>
<br/>
All that aside, this question (& responses) has brought up 2 trains<br/>
of thought: 1- Will Unschooling prepare my DD for a livelihood? & 2-<br/>
Will she ever see the need to create order out of chaos?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so she turned 5 yesterday & we&#39;re not expecting her to be self-<br/>
sufficient for sometime yet, but these concerns are always coming to <br/>
mind!<br/>
<br/>
Track 1- Observing my dd as she pretends (to be a chef, doctor,<br/>
garbage man, ballerina, Derek Jeter), I see that she follows <br/>
processes that are clearly obvious to her, asks her patients/clients <br/>
about their wants & needs, seeks solutions to obstacles. All skills <br/>
that she will use to set & achieve goals that will allow her to <br/>
follow her dreams.<br/>
<br/>
This line is of major concern to my dh. Who also got to see her <br/>
completely focused last night. After our birthday dinner at DD&#39;s <br/>
favorite Japanese Hibachi, Mom got to go to bed early. Dad watched DD <br/>
prepare a birthday gift for Mom, complete with a newly drawn card & <br/>
dinner(bowl of cereal & a glass of water), which she carried all the <br/>
way upstairs to my bed! <br/>
<br/>
Track 2- Finding Method in Mayhem. DD sees little need to pick up <br/>
anything that she plays with! I explain that things are often easier <br/>
to find if you put similar items together. Her solution is to dump <br/>
each container until she finds what she needs, or is distracted by <br/>
something she&#39;s come across! I focus on safety issues (not leaving <br/>
things on steps or in exits). I also remind her that our Jack Russell <br/>
Terrier can chew thru anything in a matter of seconds. &quot;It&#39;s okay, <br/>
she can have that&quot;, is her response. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re expecting a large group of family & friends to help us <br/>
celebrate DD&#39;s birthday in 2 days, so trying to tidy the house is <br/>
ever present in mind. It also means that DH will tackle major house <br/>
repairs, prior to guests arriving. This year, Spring only got here a <br/>
few days ago, so outside maintenance and things that require open <br/>
windows have had to be postposned. I have reconciled myself to the <br/>
fact that my home will never be &quot;neat enough&quot;. I just have trust that <br/>
all who have been invited to the party accept me for who I am and <br/>
make that my mantra for the next few days! I could clean non-stop, or <br/>
make a birthday cake with my daughter, while stopping to play pirates <br/>
from time to time!<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy all these special moments with her and all those posts help <br/>
me realize that free-learning allows her to develop naturally into a <br/>
whole human being that sees the order and beauty in this world.<br/>

Live, laugh learn!<br/>

You could hire a personal chef to come to your house to prepare your <br/>
family&#39;s<br/>
meals for the week.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.personalchefsearch.com/">http://www.personalchefsearch.com/</a><br/>

I haven&#39;t ever done it or looked into the cost very much, but I have <br/>
heard that<br/>
it isn&#39;t very expensive.  Different people have different ideas of what<br/>
*expensive* is when it comes to the cost of feeding the family, though. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-==-<br/>
<br/>
I worked for a family with a private chef.<br/>
<br/>
I was their personal dog groomer: they had a top-of-the-line groom room <br/>
built for me to work in. They had four standard poodles. Their <br/>
daughter, who also lived on the grounds in her own home, had two <br/>
miniature poodles, two toy poodles, and one shih tzu. They also had <br/>
another standard poodle that lived in Arizona and visited often. I <br/>
groomed them all once a week. It was a FULL day of grooming---sometimes <br/>
8:00 to 8:00.<br/>
<br/>
The best part was LUNCH! Alicia was, well IS, a wonderful chef.  She <br/>
worked Monday through Friday and cooked lunch for the staff and supper <br/>
for the family. Lunch was always delicious. I often worked late enough <br/>
to watch her preparing supper---WOW! To eat like that every night! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
I took home many recipes and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Crazy place though! Along with me and Alicia, the chef, there were two <br/>
personal secretaries, a housekeeper, a laundress (really! someone who <br/>
*just* did laundry!!!), a gardener and his wife, who was a florist <br/>
(fresh flowers inside all the time!). There was a foreman, who did all <br/>
the outside stuff---like maintain the cars (gas, oil, wash, etc.) and <br/>
just fix things, and numerous part-time folks---like the hairdresser, <br/>
the massage therapist, the dog trainer, etc. At one Christmas party, <br/>
the boss announced that they had eighteen employees!<br/>
<br/>
The house was HUGE! 12,000 square feet, until they built the 7,000 sqft <br/>
addition---now 19,000 sqft! The addition had imported Italian tile in <br/>
the entrance. They imported Italians to lay the tile! &lt;G&gt; Didn&#39;t speak <br/>
a word of English, but they were adorable. The new master bedroom had <br/>
fiber optics lights in the ceiling so that it looked like the night <br/>
sky. There was also a new spa with a table for her massages and a <br/>
barber chair and sink for her hairdresser---not to mention the lap <br/>
pool---the kind with a current so that you stay in one place? &lt;g&gt; What <br/>
a hoot! The new addition had a separate full kitchen. There was also a <br/>
summer kitchen off the garage.  They had a boat house with a full <br/>
apartment above (with its own kitchen!) and my groom room below. Tennis <br/>
courts, and an eight hole golf course. It&#39;s surrounded by the lake on a <br/>
point with an outdoor pool (in addition to the indoor lap pool). I <br/>
looked for a photo. I guess the website is no longer up.<br/>
<br/>
They weren&#39;t a very nice family. But the money was good----until it ran <br/>
out. Now they&#39;re living in the boat house to avoid paying the <br/>
electricity bills on the big house. No more staff, although I&#39;m sure <br/>
there&#39;s at least a weekly maid. I guess they eat out every meal? House <br/>
in on the market. They were trying to sell it for $7 million at one <br/>
time. They backed out of an auction just a little while ago when the <br/>
price went no higher than $3 million. Will possibly be foreclosed.<br/>
<br/>
It was good while it lasted &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773265130">I do know a homeschooling mom who cooked for other people for a long <br/>
time. She makes only organic vegetarian foods - is a great cook. She <br/>
goes to their house (took her kids along when they were little), cooks <br/>
enough for that day and packs up enough in the refrigerator for another <br/>
2 days&#39; worth of meals. She was underpaid by a long shot, in my opinion <br/>
- something like $55 (plus groceries reimbursement) - but it really <br/>
only took her about 3 hours. I think she could have gotten a lot more <br/>
money for it - but she enjoyed it - she also took food home from it for <br/>
her own family, by the way. That was part of the deal - I can&#39;t <br/>
remember how much food for her own family she got.<br/>

I&#39;m glad  it all worked out well.  Given that your mother was doing you  a  <br/>
favor by driving you the three hours, I would have felt somewhat obligated  <br/>
to  be <br/>
considerate of her schedule as  well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
My mother is retired and complains that I don&#39;t need her enough.<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t feel like she was doing ME a favor, so much as her grandson who is  <br/>
in Iraq and whose wife is in the hospital trying to get their baby to  <br/>
viability.  She felt that way, too, and wouldn&#39;t let me buy gas OR  lunch.<br/>
 <br/>
I was being considerate of her schedule.  I totally changed the time  in <br/>
deference to her, and Will is the one who adjusted.  He did it with  aplomb and <br/>
initiative and grace and dignity and didn&#39;t complain about his  grandmother&#39;s <br/>
cataracts for which he had to get up early. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136343233">The baby is at 24 weeks today!  That is very good news.  We&#39;re  all <br/>
optimistic that he will get to the 27-28 week range.  Of course, the  longer the <br/>
better, but it is virtually guaranteed that he will be born early,  because his <br/>
amniotic fluid is not regenerating like it should...He&#39;s just going  to run out of <br/>
room and either her water will break again, or he will be in  danger of limb <br/>
deformities, etc., from being cramped.  If it gets to that  point (danger of <br/>
limb deformities) they will most likely induce or have a  c-section.<br/>
 <br/>
Mandy is not bored, yet, and has been taking her phone off the hook because  <br/>
everyone&#39;s calling every day.  She&#39;s still in the hospital, and will be  until <br/>
the birth.  Any advice for mothers on bedrest (who already has  internet on <br/>
her laptop, DVD&#39;s, cable and lots of books) would be much  appreciated.  Thanks <br/>
for all good thoughts pointed in our direction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750942375">Thanks everyone for responding to my question!<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian had a great point of view that my daughter (as well as <br/>
any of us) are &quot;motivated&quot; to  do things we may not always want to or <br/>
enjoy so we can get on with doing things we are passionate about.<br/>
<br/>
Dawn (in NS) - I loved this quote &quot;You&#39;re raising a life learner  - a <br/>
flexible person who can learn and adapt to different situations and <br/>
demands with little trouble&quot; - she&#39;s right!<br/>
<br/>
Kelly - You really hit the &quot;nail on the head&quot; for me when you <br/>
said &quot;Do you really think that all those years of forced schooling <br/>
and chores as a child made you cook and pay bills on time as an <br/>
adult???&quot;  NO WAY!<br/>
<br/>
I loved Sheila&#39;s idea of hiring a personal chef - will definitely <br/>
have to look into that!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Karen - Your story was wonderful - I&#39;ve noticed the same type of <br/>
consideration out of my daugther too - now that she has the &quot;time&quot; <br/>
from not being in school all day with hours of homework......<br/>
