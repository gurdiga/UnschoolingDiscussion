<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935282322">Today in the chat someone asked about games for a Game Cube because  <br/>
they&#39;ve bought one in secret for Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t remember the name of the game I was thinking of until the  <br/>
chat was over and I stepped outside.   I think it&#39;s a gamecube game,  <br/>
and my kids had a lot of fun with it.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Marty for advice and clarification:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the 64 there was Smash Brothers.<br/>
For the Wii, there&#39;s Smash Brothers Brawl.<br/>
<br/>
Marty says they&#39;ve never made more than one for a system, so you could  <br/>
just say Smash Brothers for Game Cube.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mario Kart Double Dash (can be four players or any number less)<br/>
<br/>
Lost Kingdoms is a one-player game (or two player).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Harvest Moon game for Gamecube.<br/>
<br/>
Zelda games are good, and you can get Ocarina of Time, or Windwaker,  <br/>
or Majora&#39;s Mask if you like Zelda games.<br/>
Ocarina of Time is considered one of the best games ever made.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I recommend getting as many controllers as you have children, plus one  <br/>
or two so parents or guests can play, or so there will be an extra if  <br/>
one breaks.  That&#39;s if you&#39;re going to get Smash Brothers or Mario Kart.<br/>
<br/>
the Game Cube plays Donkey Konga, which is a music game with bongos as  <br/>
controllers.  That&#39;s pretty awesome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762560809">I think I mistakenly told Shannon it was Super Mario Bros. but now  <br/>
that you name them, I know you&#39;re right. Sorry for the misinformation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770554544">Shrek 2 is really good for the gamecube. It is one of the best co-op games I&#39;ve played. Other than Halo, maybe. If you can get a hold of Chibi-Robo that one is really fun. Doshin the Giant is fun too. <br/>
<br/>
I liked the gamecube a lot. Maybe because I was needed more when that was the game system than I&#39;m needed now with the X-box. I still like to play games, but I really have a fond spot for the gamecube. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I feel this way too about the Gamecube. We played so many games as a family and we didn&#39;t find too many games we didn&#39;t like. We&#39;ve recently traded in our Wii for an xbox 360 to add to my son&#39;s other game system collection.  We pulled our Gamecube out of storage and are building up our game collection again.  :)<br/>
<br/>
We like the Mario Party games so we can play together. Another one not mentioned yet that we&#39;ve loved is Animal Crossing.<br/>

Gamecube sometimes. I think the most-played games are the Lego Star Wars<br/>
games but Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart and Zelda Occarina of Time still get a<br/>
fair bit of use.<br/>

I read all the replies with great interest, then, last night, was brave enough to go on Ebay looking....I won Smash Bothers Melee...and bid on Donkey Konga with two sets of bongos, and another with one...also a lot of 8 games.<br/>
<br/>
I will be getting more controllers..hadn&#39;t known breakage was an issue, and we have two kids and two controllers, at present.  Jim and I were talking, and have decided this will be the focus of our gift-giving this year, and we&#39;ll have games fro every member of the family, so we can enjoy playing together in whatever combination we wish...I am excited now!  Me, the mom who *hated* video games!<br/>
<br/>
So glad I found unschooling, and then this list! =)  I&#39;m a bit out of my comfort zone, but it feels wonderful and daring!<br/>
<br/>
Peace and gratitude,<br/>
