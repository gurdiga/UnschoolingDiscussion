&lt;&lt;  Maybe<br/>
I just don&#39;t have a clear picture of things, (I am sure I don&#39;t LOL) but I<br/>
do not understand how a child will ever be able to get a job and work for a<br/>
boss, with rules, and deadlines to meet, and the like, if the complete<br/>
attitude at home is kinda like &quot;do what ya want as long as your safety isn&#39;t<br/>
compromised&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The complete attitude at our house is that if there&#39;s no good reason to say <br/>
&quot;no,&quot; we try to say &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has never been to school.  He doesn&#39;t have a set bedtime.  (We had <br/>
5:00 a.m. for a while, and let that go; since then he&#39;s been up after 5:00 <br/>
twice, and to bed before midnight many more times.)<br/>
<br/>
When he was fourteen he was offered a job at the gaming shop where he works.  <br/>
That was a year and a half ago.  This week he&#39;s working four days.  He has a <br/>
cash register code and is sometimes the main cashier.  He&#39;s fifteen.  He was <br/>
five minutes late to work once (overslept and hadn&#39;t told me he had to go).  <br/>
He has never called in sick.<br/>
<br/>
When he was younger if there was an early-morning cartoon he wanted to watch, <br/>
he would set his own alarm, get up quietly and watch it, and maybe record it <br/>
for his brother (he did that with Ninja Turtles for a while when he was <br/>
eight, and his brother doesn&#39;t wake up as easily).<br/>
<br/>
From my experience with this child, it seems the question would be more this: <br/>
 If a parent forces a child to get up and do things, why would the child keep <br/>
doing it after the threat of force was removed?  If by the age of fifteen <br/>
Kirby had been made to get up before daylight most of 180 days a year so he <br/>
could get on a schoolbus (as I was made to do), would he not want to avoid <br/>
getting up early whenever possible?<br/>
<br/>
In the summer he has to be at work at 8:30 on Saturdays.  He&#39;s been in an <br/>
anime club that meets late Friday night (after the anime shop closes) for <br/>
over a year too.  He accomplishes both.  I *could* tell him it wasn&#39;t <br/>
possible and make him quit one or the other, but it IS possible, and I would <br/>
be lying.  He&#39;s proven it&#39;s possible.<br/>

&lt;&lt; How do you handle it if the child is grumpy in the morning because <br/>
she didn&#39;t get enough sleep, or if she has a hard time getting up to <br/>
go somewhere she wants to go because she&#39;s not used to getting up <br/>
that early?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s somewhere they don&#39;t really have to be, or can go later, I ask if <br/>
they&#39;d rather sleep some more.  (This happened today, with Kirby and Marty.  <br/>
I woke them up an hour before they wanted to be somewhere, and since I REALLY <br/>
had to leave then to take Holly and another family to a homeschooling <br/>
meeting, I said &quot;If you&#39;d rather sleep a while that&#39;s fine, if you&#39;re willing <br/>
to walk up there.&quot; (that was to Kirby, who said no, he wanted to get up).  <br/>
Marty was even groggier so I said &quot;You don&#39;t have to be there for another <br/>
couple of hours.  Do you want to rollerblade up there later?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s somewhere everyone has to go (like a family trip) I say &quot;You can <br/>
sleep in the car if you want--grab a pillow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re expected or have to meet someone or are going to have a friend <br/>
arriving soon I say &quot;I&#39;ll come back in five (or ten) minutes.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s the worst, though (speaking of &quot;she&quot;) and sometimes will whimper or <br/>
cry if I wake her up and remind her she wanted to do something.  But I just <br/>
go away a bit, and come back, and she will have woken up better and will let <br/>
me know what she wants to do.  Sometimes it&#39;s sleep some more.  Sometimes <br/>
it&#39;s get in the shower so the water will wake her up.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re just really as peaceable about it as we can be, and I always try to <br/>
give them an hour (unless they plan in advance, with a shower the  night <br/>
before and their stuff by the door, to get up with minimal &quot;clearance&quot;).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi!  I hope you won&#39;t my piping up on this question.  I&#39;m really new to <br/>
this list, and although the volume of mail has been tremendous, I have been <br/>
enjoying reading what I can when I can.  I noticed this particular little <br/>
thread, and loved what Sandra had to say about this.  I hope you won&#39;t mind <br/>
my two cents here.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me that if my kid were grumpy about not getting enough rest <br/>
because he didn&#39;t get enough sleep, I&#39;d be *quietly* sympathetic.  If he <br/>
was late going to a thing he really wanted to go to and/or missed it <br/>
because he didn&#39;t plan for it, and was terribly disappointed, I&#39;d be <br/>
*quietly* sympathetic.  If he asked me for help in getting up the next <br/>
time, I would help him in whatever way *he asked*.  I wouldn&#39;t blame <br/>
myself; I wouldn&#39;t blame him.  I&#39;d treat him the way *I* would like to be <br/>
treated in this circumstance (or any other circumstances).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that there is any other *thing* I could do that would be <br/>
helpful to him, or to me.  I suppose I could offer up advice about what he <br/>
*should have* done, but unsolicited advice is usually not appreciated and <br/>
benefits no one (I think it only builds up the advisor at the expense of <br/>
the advisee).<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like Kirby has figured out exactly what he needs to do to <br/>
be able to get done what he wants to get done (I hope that made sense <br/>
{g}).  Being able to figure out these things - all things - for ourselves, <br/>
I think, is our birthright, no matter what our age.  When we need help <br/>
figuring them out, we can ask for help, which, ultimately, is part of being <br/>
able to figure out for ourselves what to do:  We figure out whom to ask or <br/>
where to look for the information we need.  (If I play my cards right, I <br/>
hope I&#39;ll be one of the people my son knows he can look to for help when he <br/>
needs it.  He&#39;ll only do that if he can trust me to offer nonjudgmental <br/>
help that he can accept or refuse without my getting offended or weird.  In <br/>
other words, if he knows he won&#39;t have to hear &quot;I told you so&quot; and &quot;Of <br/>
course you&#39;re late; you should have...&quot; and other know--it-all stuff <br/>
parents are so good at shoveling up.)<br/>
<br/>
When people have to learn to do something, they just do it.  If there are a <br/>
few bumps along the way (grumpy from lack of sleep, for example), they&#39;ll <br/>
be able to figure out what went wrong and how to deal with it the next <br/>
time.  We moms and dads can hang back and be supportive!<br/>
<br/>
I sure hope you don&#39;t mind my chiming in!  I just couldn&#39;t resist.  That <br/>
*was* a little more than two cents, no? {G}<br/>

treated in this circumstance (or any other circumstances). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I try to think of it.  I&#39;ve stayed up way too late, even in the <br/>
past few years, sometimes.  And that feeling of headachy stupidity is God&#39;s <br/>
Own Natural Consequences.  <br/>
<br/>
And because Kirby&#39;s young, sometimes he CAN just bounce up and go after three <br/>
hours sleep.  I could, when I was a teenager and in my 20&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; When we need help <br/>
figuring them out, we can ask for help,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes he does that too.  If he&#39;s having a big weekend he&#39;ll say he needs <br/>
to sleep at some point, or he&#39;ll ask me sometimes to remind him to go to bed <br/>
early on Thursday, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
This Sunday he has an all-day white crane seminar (a karate thing), and has <br/>
to be at the YMCA at 8:30 a.m.   Tomorrow I&#39;ll remind him that he might want <br/>
to skip the Saturday night D&D game.  Then if he decides he really wants to <br/>
do D&D, it won&#39;t be my fault.  (That is important to me too. &lt;g&gt;)  And if he <br/>
goes to D&D I won&#39;t shame him at all.  And if he does choose to stay home, I <br/>
won&#39;t say &quot;Good, Kirby; I&#39;m proud of you.&quot;  I want him to have and make that <br/>
decision without my nagging or praising or anything.  I&#39;ll help by reminding <br/>
him, and then let him make the judgment call.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519298019">I&#39;ve dealt with this for a quite a while with Rachel who is my night <br/>
owl.  This morning we toured a chicken factory farm (pretty cool <br/>
set-up, but not sure I like the ethical questions it raises.)  Anyway, <br/>
Jenni went to wake Rachel up and came back and said Rachel didn&#39;t want <br/>
to get up.  I went and asked Rachel if she didn&#39;t want to get up or <br/>
just wasn&#39;t interested in the tour.  She said both, I shut the door <br/>
and left.  If she had said she was interested but too tired, I would <br/>
have delayed leaving for a 15 minutes and given her a chance to wake <br/>
up because she is a very slow riser - then asked again.<br/>
Rachel is 17 so if your children are younger you are dealing with <br/>
other things too, like not being able to just leave them.  But we have <br/>
had discussions about her cranky moods for ten years.  I don&#39;t ask her <br/>
to be happy, just don&#39;t bring the rest of us down too.  I also try to <br/>
respect her need for sleep up to the point that it is a symptom of <br/>
depression (17 hours a day or so), then we talk to the doctor.  <br/>
Now, the one thing that we had to make very clear to Rachel was that <br/>
if she didn&#39;t get up, and said she didn&#39;t want to go somewhere, she <br/>
wasn&#39;t allowed to crab later that she didn&#39;t get to go.<br/>

Kirby was our resident grump from about nine to 15, and in the past several <br/>
months he&#39;s Mr. Chipper.  Very easy to get along with.  Very helpful.  <br/>
Puberty was rough on him.  He&#39;s getting grown.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve said that to him many times--either be nice or be quiet, the rest of <br/>
the kids really want to do this thing.  And he was able to cheer up pretty <br/>
easily if he remembered he wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
I realize the problem could make a comeback, but for now we&#39;re enjoying the <br/>
sweet, enthusiastic Kirby of years ago.<br/>
