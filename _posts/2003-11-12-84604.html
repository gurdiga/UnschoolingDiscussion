<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173642697">Okay, WHERE HAVE I BEEN?  Never heard of cod wars either.  But this piqued my <br/>
interest because we eat cod and take cod liver oil.  If it&#39;s on the <br/>
endangered species list, I don&#39;t feel comfortable doing that.  I&#39;m off to google, to <br/>
research.  Thanks again-see how enlightened I am becoming?  :-)<br/>
