people without spending some serious time there considering their position,<br/>

dangerous or stupid, and more often than that I&#39;ve stayed and regretted it. <br/>

All mailing lists are changeable, and few are idiot-proof.<br/>
<br/>
I quit another list after staying on only a few days just last week.  It&#39;s <br/>
okay to stick your toe in water and pull it back out.  Life&#39;s short and some <br/>
posts are long.  (Often mine.  Sheesh!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-584132705">Sandra...I was so bummed when you quit that other list!!! I bitched <br/>
about it...The other poster said she was going to quit...She told <br/>
everyone &quot;toodles&quot;...But guess who&#39;s posting again, perky as ever?  <br/>
UGH.  Don&#39;t know how long I can make it on that one, either...but I <br/>
keep hangin in there for any new insight.   <br/>

Well between people whose kids were in school and defending ADHD and talking <br/>
about politics, I wasn&#39;t having fun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on three other lists.  That&#39;s way PLENTY for unschooling, isnt&#39; it?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488822878">It&#39;s getting hard to keep up with the lists that I am on. The <br/>
messages pile up and my computer is slow as a snail...it takes <br/>
forever to read everyones post.  That&#39;s why I end up staying up till <br/>
3 or 4 am.  Regardless, I get a lot of info from everyone on the <br/>
lists.  As long as it isn&#39;t interfering with my kids time with me, <br/>
(which sometimes, i think it might be ) I guess there is no harm in <br/>
it.  Sometimes, though, I find myself sitting here...&quot;just a quick <br/>
check&quot;, I think...and then the baby comes and wants me.  Sometimes I <br/>
push the envelope just trying to get through all of the <br/>
messages...checking them while she&#39;s eating, coloring, watching <br/>
Elmo...  I&#39;m seriously thinking about cutting myself back, <br/>
listwise...but it&#39;s hard to choose!!!  It isn&#39;t hard to choose <br/>
between my children and my computer though.  As long as that is true, <br/>
I think I&#39;ll be fine ;)<br/>
