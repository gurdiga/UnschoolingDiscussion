Well I should say I&#39;m not oversensitive about it, just tends to be a VERY realistic subject with me and watching what I have I tend to be able to imagine a lot.  I saw Silence of the Lambs too. I think I have more of a problem with the anticipation killer movies like Halloween where, through my eyes anyway, there isn&#39;t much of a plot. <br/>
I watch forensic shows and read and watch anything that is new on about serial killers. Just something I really want {or maybe it&#39;s need} to understand {as much as possible} but of course when you put yourself in the place of the victim it&#39;s a bit unsettling. <br/>
In the area of movies I tend to prefer comedies. :-b<br/>
