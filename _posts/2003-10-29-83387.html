Do you think that math games and &quot;invented spelling&quot; and other &quot;non-conventional learning methods&quot; work well in an institutional environment?  I see how they are marvelous for the one-on-one (or family-on-family) numbers in a household, but when you move it to school, don&#39;t you wind up with the same old same old?  Won&#39;t the kids who are ready to play the more advanced games come out on top and the kids who start from a lower understanding level will just be the constant losers in the games?  <br/>
<br/>
I used to think that invented spelling was a bunch of garbage.  What do you mean, let kids write stuff however they want???  Let them think they&#39;re doing everything a-ok??  That&#39;s nuts!  But things change when you look into your son&#39;s shining, expectant eyes when he&#39;s written something the way it sounds to him, but it is spelled completely wrong.  Even though you don&#39;t tell him, he figures out that he got the words wrong and he shuts down and doesn&#39;t write anything for a few months.  This gets you thinking that maybe those crazy people were onto something.  I can see a child coming along in his spelling in the home environment, but I can see so many kids in school just floating on, never realizing that their spelling is so atrocious and that they can&#39;t really communicate in writing.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it the individuality of unschooling that produces results and not just the kinder, gentler methods?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your insights!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the teacher, depends on the kids.<br/>
When I taught I used more games than not.  I never used the textbooks they <br/>
had for us--the boxes sat sealed in the corner.<br/>
<br/>
The same old same old problem with schools is kids are there against their <br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Won&#39;t the kids who are ready to play the more advanced games come out on <br/>
top and the kids who start from a lower understanding level will just be the <br/>
constant losers in the games?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not in my experience.<br/>
Your objection is to competition, not games.  There are ways to play that <br/>
don&#39;t involve sorting people into winners and losers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; but I can see so many kids in school just floating on, never realizing <br/>
that their spelling is so atrocious and that they can&#39;t really communicate in <br/>
writing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kids in school have the same opportunity as kids at home to see examples of <br/>
correctly spelled writing, and to come on times when someone has misunderstood <br/>
what they&#39;ve written.<br/>
<br/>
Any atrocious speller you know in your life probably went to school where <br/>
they were taught phonics and spelling rules.  My husband could hardly spell when <br/>
I met him (he was 21) but he COULD communicate in writing very well.  He just <br/>
needed an editor.  Over the years his spelling improved, slowly but surely, <br/>
because the pressure of grades and school and red pencil marks was gone and he <br/>
came to care.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t it the individuality of unschooling that produces results and not <br/>
just the kinder, gentler methods?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems there&#39;s another question underneath your question.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the unkind, ungentle methods would &quot;produce results&quot; if used <br/>
individually?<br/>
That&#39;s what teachers think--they say if class sizes were smaller their <br/>
results would be better.  That&#39;s what curriculum buyers think.  They can do school <br/>
with one child in one grade and it will just flow along merrily.<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;just&quot; is problematical.  &quot;Isn&#39;t it the individuality of unschooling <br/>
that produces results and not just the kinder, gentler methods?&quot;  &quot;JUST&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone is claiming any one thing is &quot;just&quot; excusively the only <br/>
factor.   If I had to pick a factor, love might be the most important one.   <br/>
But if I had to pick its cousin, that would be freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Children in most schools have no freedom of movement or attendance.  They <br/>
can&#39;t even go to the toilet in freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Some homeschoolers have no freedom either.  Kids do what they&#39;re told when <br/>
they&#39;re told.  They sit where and how they&#39;re told and they don&#39;t stop until <br/>
they&#39;re given permission.   Individuality only makes that worse: it makes it <br/>
personal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same old same old what? Same old, to me, means teacher standing in <br/>
front of class and giving a lecture on how to multiply fractions by <br/>
first multiplying the numerators and then the denominators. Teacher <br/>
lectures, demonstrates, and hands out exercises to do in class and then <br/>
homework to do outside of class and then a test.  Most classrooms and <br/>
most homeschools do some variation of that, when it comes to math.<br/>
<br/>
Taking a different approach in which kids learn math through <br/>
discussion, games, and real-life experiences is very different - <br/>
whether in a classroom environment or a homeschooling family <br/>
environment. Not going to be the same old same old, not at all.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really want to spend too much time talking about classrooms <br/>
here - that&#39;s not unschooling and could lead us off into many many <br/>
posts on classroom learning situations. But, this idea, that the people <br/>
who are more advanced would always win and less advanced always lose <br/>
--- why would you think that is more true in a classroom than among <br/>
homeschoolers?  It isn&#39;t. Games are usually made more fun by adding an <br/>
element of luck, playing in teams, making questions of varying degrees <br/>
of difficulty, including all KINDS of games so that some people are <br/>
better at some types than others, finding ways of imposing handicaps on <br/>
highly skilled players, and so on. AND - there are many many <br/>
cooperative games and many games that can easily be turned into <br/>
cooperative games.  We play the game SET, for example, as a cooperative <br/>
game a lot of the time, by just all of us trying to find sets, not <br/>
competing against each other to be the fastest to find them. We started <br/>
this because my middle daughter was so TERRIBLE at this game and the <br/>
youngest was so good at it. Now when one person is not finding any <br/>
sets, we give them hints and when that person finally gets one we all <br/>
cheer. OR - we made the rule that the youngest kid (the one good at it) <br/>
had to find sets that were of a certain type while the rest of us could <br/>
find any kind of set. Everybody wants the game to be fun - fooling with <br/>
the rules to make the game more fun is also a way of examining how the <br/>
game works and why it plays out the way it does and that is very <br/>
interesting and useful to think about. But - I digress.... &lt;G&gt; No <br/>
reason that the kids playing games in a school setting can&#39;t do the <br/>
same kind of thing, though, and a teacher could easily model that and <br/>
encourage and support it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t have to correct spelling, much less GRADE on it, in school, <br/>
to help kids learn to spell better. Kids working on real projects that <br/>
they care about will ask for help with spelling. Teachers can suggest <br/>
that kids write without worrying about spelling (for kids that DO <br/>
worry, tell them to underline the words they aren&#39;t sure about and just <br/>
come back to them later) and then talk about editing for publication <br/>
and how they can proofread before they put all their poems into books <br/>
or before the website they created is published on the internet, etc. <br/>
At that point kids can go through and help each other with spelling - <br/>
the kids will know which other kids spell really well.  Charts of words <br/>
that are commonly misspelled can be put up on the wall, computers will <br/>
spelling checkers can be available, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kindler gentler certainly makes for increased real learning ESPECIALLY <br/>
when it is math concepts you&#39;re talking about. Rigid <br/>
lecture/practice/test/grade methods can be highly individualized and <br/>
can still be completely void of discussion and not involve any &quot;playing <br/>
around&quot; with ideas. This can result in the kind of &quot;good students&quot; I <br/>
see in my college classes - those who can do all the computations but <br/>
are clueless about when to do them, what they are good for, what they <br/>
mean, how to finesse tricky situations by changing the methods a bit, <br/>
how to interpret results beyond a calculated numerical answer, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t individuality so much as wanting to spell better which can happen<br/>
with any method. If a child has a reason to spell better -- like wanting<br/>
someone else to be able to read what they write or just the need to do it<br/>
the right way then they&#39;ll be motivated to figure out standard spelling.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of unschooling is that kids get to write what they want for<br/>
their own purposes, and most real writing -- though not all -- has a built<br/>
in need for standard spelling.<br/>
<br/>
If a teacher can provide opportunities for those same feelings, then kids<br/>
will be motivated to spell better. The problem in school, though, is that<br/>
unless a school is very enlightened, the goal isn&#39;t to provide opportunities<br/>
for kids to write when they need to write, but to get kids to write. So that<br/>
artificial need to &quot;write for the sake of writing&quot; can be a big millstone<br/>
for kids and teachers. There isn&#39;t any motivation to improve the spelling in<br/>
an assigment that someone doesn&#39;t want to write and doesn&#39;t see a purpose in<br/>
writing.<br/>

Oooh Pam! I&#39;ve been thinking about you and your suggestions about <br/>
changing game rules to see how the dynamics of the game change. I <br/>
found an alternate set of &quot;adult&quot; (yuck ;-p) rules in the directions <br/>
of our Sorry game. It involved getting a hand of 5 cards rather than <br/>
drawing a card to move on each turn. This enabled, no forced, you to <br/>
strategize in a completely different way. It *did* change so much <br/>
about the game and its outcome. We LOVED it.<br/>
