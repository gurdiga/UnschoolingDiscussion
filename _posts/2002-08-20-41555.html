&lt;&lt; If your put signs on your house that incite the teachers, you are certain <br/>
to<br/>
get some very nasty phone calls from those teachers and their friends and<br/>
relatives.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I would not put it past the teacher&#39;s union that they would send some very<br/>
bad people to your house and do things to it that you can&#39;t imagine.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re suggesting teachers will come and toilet paper her trees and bushes?<br/>
Flaming dogshit?<br/>
<br/>
WHAT, Ned, are you suggesting?<br/>
<br/>
Teamster hit men?<br/>
<br/>
Guerilla window-washers?<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the windows should be painted with quotes.  Put up flowers or <br/>
birds or designs and let it go.  If you want a message to go out to those <br/>
parents who pick their kids up, maybe bumper stickers on the back of cars <br/>
parked there that say &quot;www.unschooling.com&quot; or a local contact and just no <br/>
more would be sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
No sense disturbing the peace of your home to spite school.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe a school-free zone sign in the front yard would be cute. &lt;g&gt;   The <br/>
little red schoolhouse motif with an international &quot;none of this&quot; symbol over <br/>
it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026608808">Rolling on the floor, laughing like an idiot.... earlier this year, in Alberta, the teachers went on strike for weeks for having to do things that weren&#39;t their &quot;job&quot;.  Some examples were lunch room supervision, doing up jackets for physically incapacitated children so they could go out to recess, handling book club orders, etc.  Some were reasonable, others not so much.  Anyway, they struck for quite a while, until they got significant pay raises. This prompted a rash of jokes like, &quot;How many teachers does it take to change a lightbulb?  Well, *that&#39;s* not in their job description!!&quot;.  Anyway, I don&#39;t think you need to fear guerilla window washers (et al) as that is not in their contract!<br/>
