<div id="ygrps-yiv-84910649">Hi, I read this today from another list that I&#39;m on.  A mom asked <br/>
for advice on how to handle her DD who is getting into a lot of <br/>
trouble in the first grade for talking and wanting to socialize.  I, <br/>
of course, suggested that she pull the child out of school (the mom <br/>
actually said that she had thought about homeschooling).  Only one <br/>
other person on the list suggested the same thing.  The following is <br/>
a response from a first grade teacher who is on the list.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I first would encourage her to understand that she has<br/>
to get her work done. It is her JOB right now. Also talk to her<br/>
about how talking to her friends keeps her and her friends from<br/>
getting the job done. Many times, I have found that boredom is NOT<br/>
the case in a situation like this.....the child just does not want to<br/>
do the work because they would rather waste time and talk. Many kids<br/>
today are so used to having instant gratification. They don&#39;t want to<br/>
spend time to get anything done. I am not saying that this is the<br/>
case with your daughter, but this is a common problem with this age.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OMG, I was starting to get really upset at this point in reading the <br/>
post.  I&#39;m sure all of you can understand why.  :)  The I read the <br/>
next paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Homeschooling would give your daughter the attention that she needs.<br/>
I am hoping to get our bills down to a point that I only have to <br/>
work part time or even better, stay at home because I don&#39;t want my <br/>
little ones going to public school. The teachers are great, but the <br/>
system has many problems, the teachers are losing control of the <br/>
classroom because of programs and paperwork being forced upon us. In <br/>
the past 8 years of teaching, it has changed so much. I am looking <br/>
for another position within the district that is technology based or <br/>
I will be looking again at charter schools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmm....if a teacher (who teaches in your district) is telling you to <br/>
home school, don&#39;t you think that you should?<br/>

I understand what you&#39;re saying.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
But if a school teacher&#39;s telling me *anything*, I&#39;d have to think twice <br/>
about it! &lt;BWEG&gt;<br/>
