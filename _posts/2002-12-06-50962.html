Trevor has been really into that show on the History channel called &quot;Mail <br/>
call&quot; about the military and history of wars.<br/>
He can rattle off all sorts of facts about weaponry. How many rounds per <br/>
minute a Gatlin gun can shoot and so on, he recognizes several different <br/>
styles of guns now, it&#39;s amazing.<br/>
That timeline is going to be fun for him to look at I bet.<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
