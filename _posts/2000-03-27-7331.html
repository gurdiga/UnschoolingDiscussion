&lt;&lt; I was wondering if anyone here knew of any other diseases that <br/>
 an abnormal ANA test might indicate. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Heather,<br/>
Wow, I&#39;m sorry you are going through this.  <br/>
A positive ANA is not a definitive sign of any one thing, but is a really <br/>
good place for the doc to start looking.  Lupus, among other things, can be <br/>
indicated with a high ANA.  How high was yours?  Did your doctor tell you <br/>
with what pattern the ANA came back?  Different patterns can suggest <br/>
different diseases.  Any of the autoimmune diseases are a possibility - <br/>
rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, Raynaud&#39;s, scleroderma, and others. <br/>
 Keep careful track of what kind of symptoms you have.  I assume since you <br/>
were thinking of fibromyalgia that pain and fatigue are key symptoms for you. <br/>
 Once you begin observing your body closely you may notice others.  Of course <br/>
it&#39;s not helpful to dwell on our symptoms forever, but at this point it is <br/>
important to notice as many as possible, with as much detail as possible.  <br/>
This will be helpful information for your doctor.   <br/>
Here is a great site that will give you tons of information:<br/>
www.lupus.org  <br/>
Try clicking on the button for &quot;Causes, Symptoms, Testing, and Treatment&quot;.  <br/>
Lots of good information there.  <br/>
If you want to discuss this further off-list I would be happy to.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
in your position and it was actually a huge relief to me when I was diagnosed <br/>
with lupus because I could finally put a name on it.  My ANA ranges anywhere <br/>
from 0:10 to 0:6800.  Autoimmune disorders are tricky - especially lupus, <br/>
because it can mimic virtually any other disease.  Good luck and I hope you <br/>
feel better.  <br/>
