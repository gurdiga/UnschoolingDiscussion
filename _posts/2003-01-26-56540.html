obedience trainer&quot; ! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My boys and my dogs hear my &quot;NO!&quot; and all stop in their tracks and SIT. <br/>
<br/>
So would YOU!<br/>

My mother uses the &quot;no, no, no!&quot; ---POODLE VOICE,  singing. Why would ANYone <br/>
know what she means???<br/>

critical newborn her voice would get real quiet.  She would come up and say <br/>
&quot;Pam, I need you to look at something&quot; and I knew she meant business and it <br/>
was serious.  I think it was the change in her voice and not the pitch or <br/>
volume that made me take notice.<br/>
