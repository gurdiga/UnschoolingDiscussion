<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652690065">Hi, Becky! Boy, it has been a long time!<br/>
<br/>
Do you still get  up to Minneapolis on occasion? Our homeschool theater group&#39;s next play is November 8, 9, 10, 15, 16 and 17. It&#39;s a mystery/farce and and the actors are all 13 and older. It&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve tried this and it was really hard to disappoint the younger kids, but this time it was necesary. We&#39;re doing Pollyanna in the spring and lots of kids can participate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just had our first rehearsal, a read-through of the script. I think it&#39;s going to be great, with lots of cool classic mystery stuff: set in an old English mansion, the eclectic family called together by the patriarch for an announcement and served by a maid and butler, a thunderstorm, people disappearing, secret wall panels, etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked this before but never got a response, so I&#39;ll try again: does anyone know of other homeschool theater groups? I&#39;d love to communicate and compare notes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a group in Calgary that does musicals once or twice a year.  Want <br/>
me to ask the person who organizes them if she&#39;d like to <br/>
communicate?  There&#39;s also a group in Vancouver that&#39;s done some Shakespeare.<br/>

different theater groups, neither of which was just homeschoolers,<br/>
although we&#39;d love to be part of one. She was Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz<br/>
this sping with 7-17 year olds (she&#39;s 8) and of the three kids that<br/>
couldn&#39;t seem to get it together, two were teen girls and one was a 7<br/>
year-old boy. The script was 63 pages. She&#39;s been exposed to a wide<br/>
variety of theater - Cabaret was her fave this season - and I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine a mystery/farce that would be beyond that.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously ageism is one of my hot buttons...<br/>
