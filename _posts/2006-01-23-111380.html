<div id="ygrps-yiv-342183244">I have two problems I&#39;m trying to solve for my son (19mo).  They are<br/>
babyproofing and jealousy.<br/>
<br/>
Babyproofing... we (dh, ds, and I) currently live with my parents who<br/>
are tolerant of the unschooling philosophy.  Their attitude is more or<br/>
less, &quot;It&#39;s your kid, but it&#39;s not the way we&#39;d do it.&quot;  (Which is<br/>
obvious when compared to the extremely &quot;sheltered&quot; upbringing I had.) <br/>
But we spend a good deal of time in our two rooms and most of it in<br/>
the one room we designated as office/living room (the other room is<br/>
our bedroom).  We&#39;ve got the bedroom mostly babyproofed so ds is able<br/>
to put himself to bed on a foam fold-out sofa we got for him.  The<br/>
bedroom is basically babyproofed, meaning that there&#39;s not much he can<br/>
get to that we want to keep him away from (except for the headboard of<br/>
our bed, where we currently have some fragile valuables, and the<br/>
attached bathroom) but the office/living room is another matter<br/>
entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Jealousy.. I work from home (in all about 36 to 40 hours a week). <br/>
This work is on my computer, which also happens to be my favorite way<br/>
to relax.  I do my best to not &quot;play&quot; on my computer when ds is awake,<br/>
but even so ds is obviously, patently jealous of my computer and the<br/>
time I spend at it.  My husband attends college classes in the<br/>
morning, so I try to get ds out to the gym to swim each day (which he<br/>
loves) so he&#39;ll take a good long nap and I can work without issues<br/>
until dh gets home from school.  Ds normally wakes up about the time<br/>
dh gets home (around noon).  That&#39;s when the problems start.  Dh tends<br/>
to be a homebody, bordering on hermit.  He doesn&#39;t like to leave our<br/>
area unless he has to.  But when he&#39;s in our area while I&#39;m working,<br/>
ds will often do things like pull my work papers off my desk, try to<br/>
turn my chair around to face the other way, etc.  I haven&#39;t been able<br/>
to find enough time in the day to spend all of ds&#39;s waking time<br/>
focused on him, get enough sleep myself, and still get enough work<br/>
done to keep the family afloat financially.<br/>
<br/>
This ties back into the babyproofing issue as well.  I also have been<br/>
unable to find a way to keep my important work stuff out of ds&#39;s reach<br/>
so that he&#39;s not tempted.  We have such a limited space that just<br/>
about everything we have that&#39;s not in storage is fairly easily<br/>
available to ds.  We&#39;ve done the best we can and actually managed to<br/>
use the space better than I had hoped (two computers, two regular<br/>
sized recliners, a child sized recliner for ds, a stack of two<br/>
mini-fridges, a TV, a filing cabinet, and a dresser for ds, plus<br/>
assorted storage locations in a 10x15 room).<br/>
<br/>
Also, dh is only moderately tolerant of the unschooling philosophy. <br/>
His attitude is basically, &quot;I&#39;m okay with some of it, but my kids will<br/>
do chores and you&#39;re not allowed to help them with them.&quot;  (Though I<br/>
expect/hope that will change before ds is old enough for us to<br/>
consider giving him any chores, he has eased up slightly since I first<br/>
broached the topic.)  Therefore it&#39;s not as easy to get dh to help<br/>
keep ds out of everything (by redirection), because he tends to resort<br/>
to a loud, angry &quot;no&quot; and a smack on the bottom when ds gets into<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m looking for any ideas I can use to make life better for ds<br/>
and move us a step closer to our goal of radical unschooling.  Also,<br/>
if anyone knows of a good tips and strategies website for general<br/>
babyproofing that may just give me some new ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152022190">How much of your work papers do you need access to at any one time? <br/>
That makes a difference somewhat - if you have to have lots of <br/>
papers accessible (cross references and suchlike), I&#39;d suggest if at <br/>
all possible, hole punch and three ring binder. That way, they are <br/>
less inviting and if they get grabbed, they are together and less <br/>
likely to get lost or mutilated. If you only need a small pile at a <br/>
time, I might get some sort of file box (closeable type thing, even <br/>
a really big tupperware container or ziplock bag would do) and put <br/>
stuff that isn&#39;t immediately needed in there - if DS gets at it, the <br/>
stuff inside is still safe and orderly for the most part. Who cares <br/>
if having a stack of ziplock bags full of papers looks a bit odd, if <br/>
it works.<br/>
<br/>
As to the jealousy here&#39;s one tidbit that seems to work with DS (I <br/>
work from home on occasion, DS is older but it might still work): <br/>
when I work from home, I take 10-15 minutes from each hour and that <br/>
is my &#39;break time&#39; - I get up and stretch, stop at the bathroom if <br/>
need be, get a glass of water, and most importantly, I give DS a <br/>
chunk of that time to tell me what he&#39;s been doing, get him things <br/>
he&#39;s wanting and so on. By giving him Me in small bits throughout my <br/>
working time (and yes I know that adds length to the day to get the <br/>
same amount of work in) he is much more accepting of the time I am <br/>
working. You might also get an old keyboard by itself (I&#39;m sure if <br/>
you don&#39;t have one, you can ask around and find one or get a cheap <br/>
one from a computer refurbishing place) and when you start to work, <br/>
put that out for DS so he is &#39;working&#39; like mommy. Other &#39;when <br/>
mommy&#39;s working only&#39; toys and things might help as well - a special <br/>
basket of papers and blocks and whatnots that he likes that comes <br/>
out when mom&#39;s working.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe DH needs specific ideas of what you are looking for when you <br/>
want his help. Instead of &quot;Please keep DS out of my papers&quot; <br/>
something like &quot;DS likes playing with these blocks. Can you help him <br/>
build some towers to knock down?&quot; Find things that he is comfortable <br/>
doing (so he&#39;s not necessarily having to go out of his comfort <br/>
area). Or perhaps get a small TV/DVD player that he and DS can go <br/>
watch in the bedroom while you are working. They have wall mounting <br/>
gear so it can go up safely out of reach and not require a flat <br/>
surface to sit on.<br/>

a explore CD geared toward 6 - 36 month old children. When she just won&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157675582">Elliot..I recognized your name. I lurk on the TCS list. Howdy! To me, what makes college different (usually, but not always) is that a person chooses to be there, and chooses what they want to study and when. The only way that is similar to K12 are the situations where children are going right out of high school because it&#39;s expected of them, and it&#39;s not truly their choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121564516">I don&#39;t have much time, but the first thing that came to mind is <br/>
that even if kids go to elementary or high school with the freedom <br/>
to stop going when they want, they still are pretty much under the <br/>
control of the teachers/administration when they are at school.  <br/>
They can&#39;t come and go as they wish.  They have to eat lunch when it <br/>
is served, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In college, there is much more personal freedom.  Also, there are <br/>
more class choices, and a person could only take one class if that&#39;s <br/>
what he wanted.<br/>

Maybe more later.<br/>

the next set of hoops you jump through before getting a job, it&#39;s not  <br/>
much different.<br/>
<br/>
For unschooled kids who are going because they want it, it&#39;s an  <br/>
entirely different thing.<br/>
<br/>
But even I as a schooled kid found college a lot different than high  <br/>
school. You could pick what college suited you. You could pick --  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881738819"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Is college bad just like school, or is there<br/>
&gt; &gt; something that makes it different and better?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=====================<br/>
<br/>
If a fifteen year old wants to take a semester off and pick up in the  <br/>
fall, that is not a doable option.<br/>
If a parent TELLs a kid to go to school, no option, school is like a  <br/>
prison, with no exit doors on the other side, just the trudge back  <br/>
home every day.  About the only options are running away or killing  <br/>
oneself, or finding another family to live with (which happens  <br/>
sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
I did go to college with some kids whose parents treated it JUST that  <br/>
way--same jail as high school, but maybe in a different state.  The  <br/>
parents micromanaged their lives, told them what classes they could  <br/>
take, changed their privilege level based on report cards, etc.     <br/>
The only thing that made college different and better for them is  <br/>
that they went home to a dorm instead of their parents&#39; house.<br/>
<br/>
When parents make kid WANT to live somewhere else as quickly as  <br/>
possible, that can make college attractive.  But that&#39;s a hop out of  <br/>
a frying pan hoping to run away from the fire.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When my son took a couple of college classes at 18, he was doing it  <br/>
as a toe in the water, to see what it was like.  There was no  <br/>
pressure on him to go full time and start working on a degree he  <br/>
would finish in four years.  He will probably go back and take more  <br/>
classes at some point, but it will be because he wants to for some  <br/>
reason—to be with friends, or to work on a certificate in cooking  <br/>
(that&#39;s what he seems the most interested in at the moment), or I  <br/>
don&#39;t know what.    We will help him if he needs help, but we won&#39;t  <br/>
demand and threaten and punish.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about college and OUR family.<br/>
<br/>
As to college its objective self compared to high school, the  <br/>
flexibility and options and generally more mature treatment of the  <br/>
students are all advantages.  The freedom to leave is an advantage.   <br/>
The cost is problematical for some.  But it&#39;s different mostly in  <br/>
that it isn&#39;t compulsory.<br/>
<br/>
What people choose to do is worlds better than what someone else  <br/>
&quot;makes&quot; them do.<br/>

out of context.  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re an unschooling parent, or a  <br/>
teen, or someone who&#39;s just curious.<br/>
<br/>
If you think college is as bad as high school, then for you it is.<br/>
There is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so (said Hamlet  <br/>
one day, and then every day thereafter for hundreds of years).<br/>
<br/>
My experience with college wasn&#39;t like high school at all.<br/>
My son&#39;s small experience with college thusfar was fun and  <br/>
interesting for him.  Had it not been fun and interesting, he could  <br/>
have just dropped out and done something else.  He did drop out of an  <br/>
English 101 class (the teacher of which seemed really oppressive and  <br/>
nuts, in my opinion, and I used to teach composition myself).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s wrong to generalize about all colleges, too.  Some don&#39;t have  <br/>
all those things you&#39;ve listed, or have them in quite a different  <br/>
form from state-sponsored school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>====================<br/>
<br/>
I just noticed the &quot;The rest is mostly just boring&quot; line.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The rest&quot; of college for me was fantastic.  I learned all KINDS of  <br/>
things, free, for fun, outside of classes.  Pottery, folkmusic (I  <br/>
knew lots and learned tons more, and how to collect it myself in the  <br/>
real world), playing recorder (which I learned informally well enough  <br/>
to then be part of a formal ensemble and do serious Baroque music for  <br/>
a while), lots about religion and cults (I tried never to miss a free  <br/>
talk, sales pitch or intro session on any weird church), I met people  <br/>
from all over the world and we exchanged stories and I took lots of  <br/>
them to visit my hometown in northern New Mexico)...<br/>
<br/>
If the rest of college was boring for you, I don&#39;t now what to say  <br/>
except that it didn&#39;t have to be boring.<br/>

 College still has all the bad educational ideas.  And they expect<br/>
 even more from students.  Higher standards, they call it.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re not stuck there. There is no truant officer to come and pick you<br/>
up and force you to go to class if you decide to stop going like there is in<br/>
regular school.<br/>
<br/>
I squeaked by in high school. I was bored out of my mind and completely<br/>
uniterested in 90% of my required classes. I went to a private college prep<br/>
school and there was never any question of whether we *would* go to college.<br/>
The only question was *where* we were going to college and what our major<br/>
would be. My guidance counselor determined that the best course of study for<br/>
me would be teaching so that&#39;s what I entered college to do. I completed<br/>
three years, went out to student teach, and realized that I did  not want<br/>
become a teacher. I left college for two years and worked, got married, had<br/>
a baby.<br/>
<br/>
And then I went back. For myself. Studying the subject I had originally<br/>
wanted to study, but was discouraged from studying because my science and<br/>
math grades &quot;weren&#39;t good enough&quot;. There were still classes I didn&#39;t enjoy,<br/>
but I chose to stay with those classes and complete them because I wanted to<br/>
be a dietitian and the trade off was worth it to me. If it hadn&#39;t been worth<br/>
it I&#39;d have left and done something else or found another way to work in the<br/>
field.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the choice that makes college different than high school, IMO.<br/>

degree from Goddard College, which have assign grades, homework,  <br/>
textbooks, or set curricula. Students work with faculty advisors who  <br/>
help them shape their plan for their degree and their semester,  <br/>
within broad degree areas. For on-campus students (I did a low- <br/>
residency degree), faculty offer seminars in areas they&#39;re interested  <br/>
in, or work out seminar topics with students. Attendance is voluntary.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah but the textbooks, workbooks, homework, curriculum, tests are, <br/>
ostensibly (unless as has been said you&#39;re forced to go), something <br/>
that you choose to do as a means to an end. If you want to get into <br/>
med school, you&#39;ll need to get through some pretty grueling pre-med <br/>
coursework (all that dissecting and body parts bleh).<br/>
<br/>
My DH is a classic case study: he was bored and frustrated and <br/>
generally just wanted out of high school. He got by with Cs mostly, <br/>
just enough so he didn&#39;t have to stay any longer than necessary. <br/>
Most of his teachers considered him &#39;not college material&#39;. And at <br/>
the time he agreed, seeing it as just more sitting in classrooms.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward ten years, in which time he has gone from mailroom at <br/>
one company to doing software support for another (with a couple <br/>
other stops in between) - pretty high tech nice job for a high <br/>
school diploma, could&#39;ve continued if he wanted to. He decided that <br/>
he -wanted- to go to college to pursue something that interested <br/>
him, and college was where the resources he wanted happened to be. <br/>
He had a great time academically with much harder coursework than <br/>
high school, ended up with a 3.99 GPA (that&#39;s one B in 4 years of <br/>
fulltime classes) - so much for not being college material - and the <br/>
added maturity of being nearer 30 than 20 (not to mention he already <br/>
had me!) made the social issues moot for the most part. It was his <br/>
*choice* to be there; his *choice* to do the work; his *choice* to <br/>
take that boring economics 101 class because it was part of the <br/>
package for the other things he wanted to do. Kind of like chopping <br/>
onions because your favorite dish needs onions - the chopping part <br/>
is not the most fun but you do it because the end result has value <br/>
to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675940698">All three of my unschooled kids have chosen to take college courses -  <br/>
they take what they&#39;re interested in at the community college - this  <br/>
has included: voice class, choral group, ceramics, computer  <br/>
programming, French, acting, costume design, ballet, tap,  <br/>
printmaking, speech and debate, creative writing, photography, piano,  <br/>
guitar, statistics, history, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest has chosen to go to a university and get a degree that she  <br/>
really wants and loves working toward - her dream is to own and  <br/>
operate a camp in a beautiful outdoors place which offers fine arts  <br/>
opportunities for kids and adults. The degree she is working on is in  <br/>
recreation and leisure studies and it has included a lot of first- <br/>
hand experience in community agencies, along with classroom learning.  <br/>
It requires 2,000 hours of volunteer work plus a 1,000 hour  <br/>
internship. It has also included outdoor adventures such as staying  <br/>
on an island for a week and this spring will include a river rafting  <br/>
trip in another state. Very exciting. Very fun. NOTHING like high  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
When she decided to transfer to a university, she looked at the  <br/>
requirements for admission and at which ones she&#39;d already met by  <br/>
just taking whatever happened to appeal to her. She had to take  <br/>
several math classes and a science class. So she did that. Otherwise,  <br/>
she&#39;d managed to cover all the general education requirements just by  <br/>
taking what looked fun. She started at 13 years old and was nearly 20  <br/>
when she transferred, so she&#39;d had 7 years of &quot;dabbling&quot; in college  <br/>
before she decided to start working toward a degree.<br/>
<br/>
Community colleges are inexpensive and high quality here in  <br/>
California. In fact, at the one my kids attend, kids who are under 18  <br/>
and not a high school graduate attend as &quot;special admit&quot; students and  <br/>
don&#39;t even have to pay tuition.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing compulsory about signing up - and there are many  <br/>
classes that are not the conventional lecture, homework, test style.<br/>
<br/>
My kids see the local colleges as ways to tap into incredible  <br/>
physical resources - science labs, art studios, singing groups,  <br/>
theaters, photography equipment, and so on, AND incredible human  <br/>
resources - people with expertise to share.<br/>
<br/>
Roya came out of her first English class just wiggling with  <br/>
excitement -- &quot;I can&#39;t believe how cool this is - someone who is PAID  <br/>
to read what I write and comment on it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They do get good grades and like getting good grades but they never  <br/>
worked FOR the grade. I&#39;ve heard them tell other students - &quot;If you  <br/>
concentrate on learning and ask questions and make connections,  <br/>
you&#39;ll get a good grade, but if you just focus on cramming for the  <br/>
tests, you might still get a good grade, but you won&#39;t learn as much.&quot;<br/>

college! I&#39;ve been to college. My husband teachers at two colleges.  <br/>
My daughter is taking 2 college classes at 14.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big big psychological difference when you&#39;ve chosen to be  <br/>
somewhere and know you can choose to leave at anytime. What&#39;s wrong  <br/>
with teachers and textbooks and grades, etc. is in believing that  <br/>
they&#39;re necessary not only for learning but for how well you&#39;ll  <br/>
succeed in life. Unschooled kids know that&#39;s not true. Most schooled  <br/>
kids I bet figure it out too when they get to college. I did.<br/>
<br/>
While I certainly took my share of dull required courses, I knew I  <br/>
was there voluntarily and they were just hoops I had to jump through  <br/>
in order to take the courses that were more fun and to get a degree.<br/>
<br/>
The worth of schooled children outside of school is too often judged  <br/>
by their school performance. If a schooled child isn&#39;t doing well in  <br/>
history or math or science, too often they&#39;re seen as &quot;less than&quot;  <br/>
because their one and only &quot;job&quot; (which they can&#39;t even quit!) is to  <br/>
do well in school.<br/>
<br/>
College kids can always choose something else or change their major.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353443516">I can only talk about the UK experience. University attendance is <br/>
entirely voluntary. It is up to you if you attend lectures or do the <br/>
work. It is not the University lecturer&#39;s job to chase up work not <br/>
done. If you don&#39;t like a lecture you can walk out. University <br/>
lecturers cannot give punishments. People usually attend University <br/>
from age 18 onwards. There are also many mature students aged 21 and <br/>
over with no upper limit on age. <br/>
<br/>
On average you spend between 3 and 4 years at University to gain a <br/>
degree. Universities also have facilities for further study for master <br/>
degrees and then doctorates. Places are hard to get and funding even <br/>
harder.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot just walk out of school, the police actually have powers to <br/>
bring you to school if they find you out of school in school hours. It <br/>
is a teacher&#39;s job to chase up work undone. You cannot choose what to <br/>
study. You can be punished in school in some way, like being given a <br/>
detention. You cannot walk out of a class without risking punishment. <br/>
School is usually attended up to age 16.<br/>
<br/>
College in the UK is sort of a half way house between school and <br/>
University. People usually attend college somewhere between aged 16 <br/>
and 18/19, but you will also encounter mature students there too. <br/>
College lecturers can and do chase up work not done, but cannot give <br/>
out punishments. Attendance at college is voluntary and you can choose <br/>
what to study. <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of college lecturers who behave towards the students <br/>
in the same manner as school teachers do. Treating the students with a <br/>
lack of respect for their autonomy.<br/>
<br/>
Some schools have a further section where you can study from age 16 <br/>
until age 18. This is pretty much like college in attitude and <br/>
responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I would say the difference is not the student&#39;s attitude, but rather <br/>
the teacher&#39;s/lecturer&#39;s and society&#39;s attitude towards the students <br/>
that is the main difference.<br/>

&gt; I can only talk about the UK experience. University attendance is <br/>
&gt; entirely voluntary. It is up to you if you attend lectures or do the <br/>
&gt; work. It is not the University lecturer&#39;s job to chase up work not <br/>
&gt; done. If you don&#39;t like a lecture you can walk out. University <br/>
&gt; lecturers cannot give punishments. People usually attend University <br/>
&gt; from age 18 onwards. There are also many mature students aged 21 and <br/>
&gt; over with no upper limit on age. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this has changed in the UK.  There is far less choice over<br/>
things than I experienced in the U.S. certainly. David (dh) has been a<br/>
lecturer in the U.S. and in the UK.  In the U.S. he could expect that<br/>
the students would be able to follow up certain interests easily<br/>
outside of his course (for example if they were interested in some of<br/>
the statistics he presented it would be easy for them to enroll in a<br/>
statistics class for the next semester or a biology class or another<br/>
evolutionary anthropology class). Within the UK university system you<br/>
sign up for a subject at the outset (which has a set curriculum in a<br/>
set order, so you have to take psych 101 in your first year and psych<br/>
201 in your second year with the third year being the only year (in<br/>
Psych at Durham) that you can take optional psychology classes) and if<br/>
you change your mind you have to start from scratch again.  It is<br/>
extremely difficult to take courses outside of your field. So, while<br/>
you are free to attend university because of the structure of the<br/>
education system you aren&#39;t free to choose what you study--and you<br/>
have to have decided want you want to take from a very early age in<br/>
order to study for the right A levels. Also, David has to take<br/>
attendance.  So, the students are risking their grades by not<br/>
attending, or their ability to sue the University for a better grade. <br/>
<br/>
David or the secretaries are required to chase up work that is not<br/>
done, and to contact students who have poor attendance. Something that<br/>
the University requires.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, at the University of Durham at least, there are very, very few<br/>
mature students.  It seems the Open University and ex-polytechnics are<br/>
picking up the mature students more than established universities are.<br/>
<br/>
In the US you can take classes at University as the desire strikes. <br/>
You don&#39;t have to be enrolled in a degree program, you can just drop<br/>
in and drop back out again.  It doesn&#39;t hinder your finishing a degree<br/>
to extend the length of your time at university from 4 years to 10<br/>
years.     <br/>

 </span></blockquote>(N.B. In the UK college is the equivalent of high school.)  David gave<br/>
a lecture at a local college and after spent a lot of time talking to<br/>
the lecturer who had invited him to come and speak.  Apparently she<br/>
has no control over what she teaches and must teach in accordance with<br/>
the National Curriculum, which is completely about teaching to the<br/>
exam for psychology A-levels (University entrance exams are subject<br/>
based like GRE exams can be in the U.S.).  Not only that she is<br/>
forbidden to leave the college until all students have left the school<br/>
and must be there in the morning to greet the students.  College<br/>
lecturers are given no respect for their own autonomy--it becomes a<br/>
vicious cycle, I imagine.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Schuyler, it probably has. Although once you&#39;re in Uni it&#39;s <br/>
much easier to transfer to a different course at another Uni. My older <br/>
daughter&#39;s partner just did that.<br/>
<br/>
My OD&#39;s college experience stunk.<br/>
<br/>
I figure it&#39;s the wheels of the &#39;Edu Biz&#39; moving that&#39;s changing <br/>
everything.<br/>
