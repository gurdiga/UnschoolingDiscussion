<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791280688">Hi all,<br/>
     I was a regular poster a few months back (although I tend to read more <br/>
than post, unless I feel like I have something important to contribute).  <br/>
However, life got a little crazy, so I backed off some on all my lists.  I <br/>
just can&#39;t seem to stay away for long however :-)<br/>
     Anyway, my name is Tammy, and my family has been unschooling for six <br/>
years.<br/>
I have a 19 year old son (who is planning to go away to college in the fall), <br/>
a 15 year old son, a 12 year old son, and a 9 year old daughter.  <br/>
     We have really loved unschooling.  Things have changed alot this year <br/>
though, as my 19 year old son decided to take some classes at a technical <br/>
school before starting college next year, any my 15 year old son decided to <br/>
go to public school for his freshman year.  So this was the first year that <br/>
only my youngest two were home with me.  I kept begging my 15 year old to <br/>
come back home, but he likes all the social aspects of public school (mostly <br/>
the girls!).  So, I am trying to back off and not miss him so much, but it <br/>
can really be hard.   Next year will be worse, however, since my oldest will <br/>
be going to college a few hours drive from home  :-(<br/>
   It has been interesting to watch my oldest go from unschooling to college. <br/>
 I can&#39;t believe how motivated he can be to get himself up for school <br/>
everyday.  I used to worry some that he would never get himself up in the <br/>
morning.  We are radical unschoolers, so I didn&#39;t &quot;make&quot; my kids do any type <br/>
of schoolwork, or stick to a schedule for sleeping or rising either.  Brandon <br/>
(the 19 year old) used to stay up to about 2 or 3 am every night and sleep <br/>
until 1 or 2in the afternoon.  Usually, that didn&#39;t bother me, but my dh and <br/>
my parents were convinced that he would never be able to make himself get up <br/>
for his &quot;real life&quot; after school.  It is great to be able to say that they <br/>
are wrong about that!  I never have to make him or his 15 year old brother <br/>
get up for school or work.  They do it all on their own!   And I have to <br/>
admit that I sure didn&#39;t when I was their age!   After I finally graduated <br/>
school and moved out on my own, I was horrible about getting up and going to <br/>
work!  They have more discipline and motivation than I did, and my parents <br/>
were very, very strict with me!  Anyway, it is great to see unschooling <br/>
working!!!!!   <br/>
