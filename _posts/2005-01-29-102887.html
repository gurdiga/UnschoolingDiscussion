<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367715693">Hi.  This is my first post on this list.  I have been here about a month.<br/>
I am watching this discussion w interest, as I am about as far south as you can get (since South Florida isn&#39;t really &quot;The South&quot;).  <br/>
In response to this:<br/>
&quot;It seems that would mean they think it&#39;s acceptable to most people, <br/>
wouldn&#39;t <br/>
it?<br/>
Where and in what circumstances are children most openly spanked?&quot;<br/>
Disrespect of children and spanking IS acceptable to most people here.  In fact, many have a really hard time accepting the fact that I won&#39;t spank mine.  <br/>
Where are children openly spanked?  Um, in the grocery store, in elevators, the park, the library....everywhere.<br/>
As far as the reasons are concerned, one thing I haven&#39;t seen mentioned is religion.  Most folks around here are extremely fundamentalist, conservative....southern Baptist.  I have attended more than one of these churches, and the sermon consists of the preacher pointing at you and hollering how you are going to burn in hell.  I once went to pay my landlord and she got into my car, with my extremely aware, very young child in the back seat, and told me that he could die and be sent to roast in hell because I didn&#39;t take him to her church.  I kept begging her to cut out that imagery in front of my baby and get out of my car, but she refused, stating that I couldn&#39;t ignore it because it could happen.  They believe that God is judgemental, punitive, demands obedience....and so they translate it towards their children.  (PLEASE don&#39;t let me offend anyone&#39;s religion here....I am not stating here that these beliefs are wrong).<br/>
My sister holds these beliefs....she goes to a southern baptist church and she beats her kids (though she hates to hear me say it and says she doesn&#39;t beat them, but is lovingly correcting them as is her christian duty)...and she tells me that THE MOST IMPORTANT lesson her children need to learn is obedience.  My family cannot stand to hear me interact w my son, as I consider his viewpoint, and WILL take NO for an answer.  <br/>
Anyway.  On the ma-am and sir thing, I hate this and was determined to not teach my son anything about it.  I decided to help him learn to address my mom and dad as &quot;Yes, Ama,&quot; and &quot;Yes, Papa,&quot; thinking this would be just as respectful.  But, Alas,  they demand the sir and ma&#39;am.  It seems to me that it is less about him respecting them as doing what is necessary to be respected by them.  That is, if he doesn&#39;t address my mother with a ma&#39;am, then she will not respond to him.  I did try to help him by speaking to him w a yes and no sir, modeling it towards him before he is exposed to them.  SO he started addressing my mom as Yes sir.  I dropped that.  I just try to limit his exposure to them and when they are in contact, she prompts him to call her ma&#39;am.  I don&#39;t say anything.  It is her issue and not mine!<br/>
<br/>
I would love to live in another area where spanking is the exception and not the rule.<br/>
Until then, I am daily thankful for the online community which helps to validate my thoughts and opinions and lets me know I am not the only person in the world who realizes that children are fully people.  Though it does feel like I may be the only one in Mississippi who knows it! <br/>

There are  some things here that might help your sister, sometime when she&#39;s <br/>
receptive or needy of it:<br/>

<br/>
There are Christian reasons NOT to spank, linked there.   And there are <br/>
disgusting Christian-justified spanking writings that might shame her into looking <br/>
at what she&#39;s doing in a different light.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well I think it&#39;s the hazing thing.  If he wants respect, he can grow up and <br/>
have kids and demand it from them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That has to be hard.  I bet there are things in the spanking links that could <br/>
help you too, then.  Defenses or quotes, at least, that you can use when <br/>
others are openly critical.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, it sure is interesting to read about all of the<br/>
cultural differences from one side of the country to<br/>
another.  I have always lived in Washington, Idaho or<br/>
Montana, and I don&#39;t think the word &quot;sir&quot; has ever<br/>
left my mouth--and I *KNOW* Ma&#39;am hasn&#39;t!  I think<br/>
I&#39;ve only been called ma&#39;am twice that I can remember,<br/>
and it bothered me both times--I thought--What, am I<br/>
70?  Up here it&#39;s just not a good thing.  If I were<br/>
talking to a stranger, I would just say &quot;How are you<br/>
today?&quot;....and if they didn&#39;t hear me I would say<br/>
&quot;Excuse me&quot;....Where would the Ma&#39;am or Sir even come<br/>
in? lol, there was a man trying to get another man&#39;s<br/>
attention in the street in front of my house the other<br/>
day, and he yelled &quot;Hey!  Hey!  Hey, guy!&quot;  lol, now<br/>
THAT sounded awkward ;) <br/>
<br/>
About the spanking...I know that people in the West<br/>
*DO* spank, but I NEVER see it.  It&#39;s not an<br/>
in-the-store thing around here.<br/>

I&#39;ve used them in the SCA, but to knights and queens. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
(I&#39;ve used them occasionally other times, but usually with conscious thought and self-conscious review.)<br/>

<br/>
See, Kelly?  It&#39;s not just me being difficult.  There is an area of the country (maybe most of the country, but I&#39;m speaking for mountain SW) where it&#39;s just not done in normal everyday circumstances.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And maybe that&#39;s why it has been easy for me or Holly to say something when we&#39;ve seen it, or the threat of it, because it&#39;s rare and generally unaccepted.  They need to save it for church or home.<br/>

I kind of helped the kids out on this issue. They learned that yes <br/>
please or no thank you worked with everyone when they were little. <br/>
That way the sir and maam thing wasn&#39;t an issue too much, since they <br/>
were still &quot;Being polite&quot;. Lets face it, *I* can&#39;t always tell when <br/>
someone is male or female, let alone the kiddos. LOL<br/>
