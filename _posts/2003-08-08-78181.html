<div id="ygrps-yiv-524763542">My new niece looks very much like Alfred Hitchcock, but I feel fairly<br/>
confident it&#39;s temporary.  Her pop calls her the Peanut. <br/>
<br/>
When we found out I was pregnant we called Dylan &quot;the sprout&quot;.    After a<br/>
few months of referring to him as him / her, or he /she we just started<br/>
calling him &quot;Slash&quot;.   That turned into &quot;The Slasher.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Our midwife had a similarly sick sense of humor.   Neither of those names<br/>
stuck, fortunately.    <br/>
<br/>
When he was five his soccer coach started calling him Zimmy.  Some of his<br/>
friends began calling him Zimmy.  He liked his nickname  ( he&#39;s a Bob<br/>
Dylan fan) and was Zimmy or Zim or Zimmer exclusively for a few years.  <br/>
He&#39;s still Zimmy to some of his friends.   <br/>
<br/>
His cousin, Lilly  has always called him Dilly.   Her little sister heard<br/>
it as &quot;Jelly&quot;.   <br/>

A childless friend of mine who is interested in children but not keen to hold <br/>
them says all newborns look like Winston Churchill to him.<br/>
