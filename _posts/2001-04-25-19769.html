<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820532376">&lt;&lt;without warning the geese turned around and began to <br/>
chase her - she ran towards me, and the 2 of us fled with these geese <br/>
flapping their wings far too close for comfort!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A friend who had several geese always carried a cookie sheet with her<br/>
when she went out to the garden.  They can corner you and actually beat<br/>
you with their wings, even leave bruises.  She would use the cookie sheet<br/>
as a shield.  The one *I* challenged backed down but he was all alone,<br/>
perhaps they are braver in a group.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Oh and the rooster that flapped at my ankles pecking me - we had him<br/>
for dinner!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ROFL!  That&#39;s what he gets for picking a fight with someone from the top<br/>
of the food chain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843779206">Back in the dark ages we raised a goosling.  He was forever into something<br/>
and the ex was always yelling &quot;what is that D*MN goose doing now.&quot;  Poor<br/>
little guy thought that was his name and if you hollered D*mn Goose he&#39;d<br/>
come a running.  I thought he was great &lt;&lt;&lt;bewg&gt;&gt;&gt; he wouldn&#39;t let the mil<br/>
from h*ll out of her car %-}<br/>
<br/>
However, when we had to move we gave him to a guy in town who raised geese.<br/>
A couple of years later the whole crew made the headlines as they cornered<br/>
and then drown one of this guy&#39;s kids by forcing him into their pond and<br/>
then beating him with their wings.  They can get really nasty when they are<br/>
in flocks!<br/>

Scary!  Geese around children make me nervous, their beaks are right at<br/>
face level with little ones.<br/>
