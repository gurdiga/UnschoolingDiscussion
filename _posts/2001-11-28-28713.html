I think that&#39;s cool about your daughter wanting to be a rock star.<br/>
And you accepting it. (right?)<br/>
How does she see herself getting there?<br/>
How do you think you can help her achieve her goal?<br/>
That is so out of the ordinary. You are right, so different than your average *doctor* route.<br/>
How does one even decide what point A to point B is?<br/>
I think a great deal of luck is involved, along with talent and drive and not giving up.<br/>
My boys (8 & 10) also like rock and classic rock.<br/>
They are talking about learning guitar and drums.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in my teens, I started liking rock, much to my parent&#39;s dismay.<br/>
They like classical and other music I don&#39;t.<br/>
I was always aware of the *kind* of people who usually liked rock.<br/>
Troublemakers, stoners, losers, the bad crowd (at least in my school).<br/>
But although I really enjoyed that music (and still do), early on I made a <br/>
conscious choice not to get messed up with drugs or anything to bring me down.<br/>
It&#39;s not always - drugs and sex and rock&#39;n&#39;roll. It wasn&#39;t for me.<br/>
I just appreciated the music.<br/>
<br/>
I know you didn&#39;t need to know that - just sharing.<br/>

  Youngest wants to be a rock star (seriously!). She talks of nothing else and hasn&#39;t for years. <br/>
  I believe I understand what&#39;s expected especially of the doctor one, moreso than the rockstar one. <br/>

I think everybody needs a creative outlet and music is great! And now, with the new drums that are ... geesh.. I don&#39;t know.. electronic?.. they&#39;re small and I saw them in ToysRUS.. they&#39;re on a stand and are compact yet sound like real drums. Anyway, they don&#39;t take up much room now and with any luck at all, they&#39;ll have a volume control on them!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043701688">OMG, and I thought I was OAD.  Electronic drums are ancient, my dear &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Why Sheila E was playing them as part of Prince&#39;s band back before he became<br/>
a symbol.<br/>
<br/>
As to rock stars or bands or whatever.  What about a karyoki (how do you<br/>
spell that word?) machine or a guitar or a piano.  Bios will show that most<br/>
singers grew up singing or playing a musical instrument.<br/>
<br/>
There are also &quot;cattle calls&quot; for movies that have kids singing or for<br/>
commercials.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of the rock/pop folks, particular the kid groups will do back stage<br/>
passes for a limited number of local kids.  Talk to local booking agents.<br/>
<br/>
there are computer programs for writing music, also.  A good percentage of<br/>
singers are also song writers or started out writing music and then got<br/>
discovered from their demos when they used to sell the songs.  Did you know<br/>
that to sell songs they do their own demos and then try to get big names to<br/>
sing them?<br/>
<br/>
And, she is right, lots of &quot;stars&quot; started out as backup and the folks they<br/>
backed saw them as a tallent and helped them get a contract.<br/>
