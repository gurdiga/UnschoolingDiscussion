<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158834793"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Tea doesn&#39;t do it, though.  I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s something in the hot chocolate<br/>
&gt; mix that my gall bladder used to take care of and now that my gallbladder has<br/>
&gt; gone to rest before me, things are somewhat different.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The fat.  Your gall bladder stored up bile, which helps digest fatty foods,<br/>
and now you don&#39;t get that help.  I&#39;ve never been good with milk products,<br/>
but it&#39;s far worse since my gall bladder went away.  If you want hot cocoa<br/>
without the medicinal effect ;) try making it yourself with 1T cocoa powder,<br/>
3T sugar, and SKIM milk.  That&#39;s what my doctor suggested and it does work<br/>
for me.<br/>
