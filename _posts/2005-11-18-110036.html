It&#39;s been a heck of a week and a half or so for all-out either-or <br/>
black-and-white dualistic thinking.   If we were in person we could have an air-horn to <br/>
honk when someone says &quot;Either a person believes this or not.&quot;      &quot;Either <br/>
eating processed food kills you on the spot, or it never does.&quot;   &quot;Either parents <br/>

Is there an emoticon for screaming?<br/>
For an air horn blast?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm I don&#39;t know of one off hand but we could maybe invent one... <br/>
let&#39;s see an air horn would need to have some way to show that it is <br/>
a loud sound...but also need to be fairly simple so it doesn&#39;t take <br/>
a lot of work and it doesn&#39;t get messed up by different systems <br/>
displaying at different resolutions and wrapping and all (can you <br/>
tell I work in software testing?lol)<br/>
<br/>
__/)))<br/>
  &#92;)))<br/>
<br/>
How&#39;s that? <br/>
two underscores then forward slash then close parenthesis (enter)<br/>
two spaces then backward slash then more parenthesis<br/>
Curly brackets didn&#39;t work as well as parens. I suppose it could be <br/>
simplified into<br/>
<br/>
--))))<br/>
just to indicate loud sound coming out<br/>
<br/>
Screaming I think is something akin to angry &gt;:-O  could probably do <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;:-O )))) to indicate Loud Sound with angry to mean screaming<br/>
