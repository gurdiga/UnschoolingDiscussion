<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we do lots of crafts~ still 5, 5 and 8 years old.....ALMOST 6 yr old!!!! the <br/>
&gt; twins will be 6 on easter and carey the 5 yr old twin girl ! just pciked up <br/>
&gt; a cake mix and started reading (and using the pictures) to follow the <br/>
&gt; directions! SHE lags behind the boys academically so far, but she is very <br/>
&gt; creative , artististic, dancing aroudn the room every day~ AND makes up <br/>
&gt; beautiful stories which i type on WORD and then read back to her. someday i <br/>
&gt; know she will want to read them. sometimes, i just put cool stuff up or <br/>
&gt; throw 50 worksheets down on the floor(of course thats 15+ apiece!!!! ~) and <br/>
&gt; they will want to do them. they also love the games i make and we play <br/>
&gt; cards and dice while waiting for food at restaurants.......we also look <br/>
&gt; stuff up online .......but not that much yet. I DO ~ they play on line <br/>
&gt; more. I LOVE UNSCHOOLING&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just providing them opportuinites every day. <br/>
&gt; We have a friend dying of 3 forms of cancer...we spend time making him <br/>
&gt; stuff and visiting him. THat to me is invaluable. We are a spiritual family <br/>
&gt; who believes tog. in GOD and the universe and we talk about GOD every day. <br/>
&gt; We had to leave the church job i had (church organist and choir director) <br/>
&gt; becuase of the narrow minds and my 8 yr old was questioning the existence <br/>
&gt; of hell!!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!! God wouldn&#39;t do that ~ he <br/>
&gt; said......YIPPPPEEEE For thinking kids and discriminating kids. By spending <br/>
&gt; so much time with them, i find that we talk about everything and they ask <br/>
&gt; about everything and we repsect each others opinions.<br/>
