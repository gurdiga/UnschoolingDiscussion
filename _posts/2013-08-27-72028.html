<br/>
Cute, but I object. :-)<br/>
It&#39;s short enough in its &quot;long form&quot; without shortening more.<br/>
<br/>
I think for unschooling purposes it would be more interesting to share with your kids what the original slogan was about.  It&#39;s pretty serious, and making light of it might not be as good as looking at why making light of it might not be good.   It might be too serious a subject for some young children.  It&#39;s too serious for me.  <br/>
<br/>
The original posters were never used, which is the most interesting part, I think.  <br/>

<br/>
People have tried to describe unschooling briefly for a long time. :-)  Cutting it down to one or two words isn&#39;t likely to help. Learn?  Play?<br/>
It won&#39;t convey the purpose.<br/>

&quot;Keep calm&quot; suggests fear and the imminent danger of chaos or danger, to me.  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think there can be a single thing that is, or should be, a simple representation of unschooling.  Unschooling is broad and deep  and  operates over time.  I&#39;m pretty sure that people who don&#39;t have time to read and think and work at getting it can do it right and well.  <br/>

<br/>
My observation has been that most people give up unschooling or<br/>
homeschooling out of fear.  And that fear almost always comes from an<br/>
adult, even if it is a child saying that they want to go to school.  For<br/>
myself and my husband, there were a few years of worry that our son was<br/>
somehow being harmed because we weren&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; him to read (by force of<br/>
some sort?!).  We kept reading to him, for him, helping him locate books on<br/>
tape, lectures on tape, etc.  Reading is a family avocation and we just<br/>
waited and watched and kept our mouths shut around my son.  But there were<br/>
several conversations of &quot;it will be okay, he is happy and learning and we<br/>
all have a wonderful relationship... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This site and several others were helpful.  Better late than Early by the<br/>
Moores helped.  Taking a deep breath helped.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone should claim any such thing for a family.  <br/>
I could say our family is &quot;a gaming family,&quot; but Holly can take it or leave it, and I&#39;m limited to fairly short and simple games because I don&#39;t have the patience for a long game or the spatial reasoning for one with lots of factors that need to be compared as time goes by.  Yet there are lots of games Holly and I like.  <br/>
<br/>
Two parents can share a passion or a proclivity and have a child who has no interest in it.<br/>

<br/>
Take a breath to keep from reacting to your emotions. Take a breath to let the adrenaline taper off. Take a breath to put yourself in a better state to make a thoughtful choice rather than an emotional one.<br/>

<br/>
If I were going to make a poster of short words to hang, rather than the Carry On theme, I think I&#39;d go with one that said something like &quot;Laugh more, love more, live well.&quot;  Because laughing, loving, and living well together speaks more to the unschooling in our particular household than do keeping calm and carrying on.  <br/>
<br/>
To me, it&#39;s sort of the difference between getting up in the morning, ready to make the most of the day in front of us - vs getting up in the morning and attempting to survive the day.  I&#39;d rather thrive than survive, if that makes sense :-)<br/>

<br/>
It makes sense to me.   If the first thought is &quot;keep calm,&quot; it reminds me of WWII and the bombing of London.<br/>
<br/>
But to wake up remembering that my choices will immediately be &#39;getting warm&#39; or &#39;getting cold&#39; in relation to my goal of learning and joy starts with the assumption that there will be learning and joy, and I can facilitate them easily with a series of small choices (or thwart them if I&#39;m not mindful).<br/>

I wonder if any person ever &quot;kept calm&quot; (or &quot;calmed down&quot;) because another<br/>
person, or a poster, ordered them to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard many adults order many children to keep calm, mostly while<br/>
modeling agitation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110814020">The ideas that have most impacted me from the group, is to question my<br/>
reactions. Like if they are throwing rocks, what harm comes from them<br/>
throwing rocks? Am I just reacting? I tell myself to think first, question<br/>
from their perspective, and watch. To be thankful, and to think of life as<br/>
a series of moments.<br/>
<br/>
For me, if I were to make a reminder to look at it would be &quot;Think with a<br/>
tender heart.&quot; I&#39;ll even remove myself if I need to assess. I have a great<br/>
husband I can go to as well when I need to refresh my own thoughts. In fact<br/>
I like that word too, &quot;refresh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have also learned that I am responsible for how I feel, someone cannot<br/>
make me feel any particular way. This helps me not get upset when others<br/>
are, I can empathize, and I can be an ear, but I don&#39;t need to get wrapped<br/>
up emotionally in it. Likewise, I am allowed to feel however, without<br/>
expecting others to join in.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I said this a lot when things got hard.  My mother had just moved in and<br/>
&gt;&gt; was sick.  Things were scary for all of us, and there were not a lot of<br/>
&gt;&gt; choices in a lot of life at that point.  Not for some very big things.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; It helped me remember the choices that I did have.  The choice to be kind,<br/>
&gt;&gt; instead of angry.  The choice to take joy from my children learning, living<br/>
&gt;&gt; and growing.  The fact that I had the luxury of being able to stay home,<br/>
&gt;&gt; not earn money and take care of people that I loved.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; It is easy to feel martyred/angry/put upon/ etc; but stopping, breathing<br/>
&gt;&gt; and smiling to remind yourself that life is not bad, that a lot of stuff is<br/>
&gt;&gt; not bad is the first step to making better choices.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Take a deep breath and smile, because things get better...<br/>
&gt;&gt; ....because then you are pausing from the gut level emotional reaction of<br/>
&gt;&gt; whatever moment you are in and the smile helps me to look at things in a<br/>
&gt;&gt; positive light, to separate my emotions from the emotions of a loved one<br/>
&gt;&gt; who is having a moment of anger or frustration and who is being less than<br/>
&gt;&gt; kind.  It helped me to say &quot;l love you&quot; instead of yelling back.<br/>
