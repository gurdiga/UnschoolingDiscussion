<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927331757">Although I don&#39;t know that I can quite connect this to unschooling, I would just like to say that I am almost enjoying spam since the proliferation of spam-blocking programs. As I understand it, the blockers looks for certain words/phrases/formulations, so the spammers are trying to avoid that in the way they write the spam -- including the insertion of mispellings and random words. <br/>
<br/>
 All of which leads to this:<br/>
