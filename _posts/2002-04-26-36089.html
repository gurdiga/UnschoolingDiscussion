they have it here along with other architecture stuff for kids.<br/>
<br/>
A really fun building activity is to roll newspapers - you roll two or three <br/>
together starting from a corner - use a little masking tape to hold the roll. <br/>
So they are like poles. Roll LOTS of them.<br/>
<br/>
They kids can build HUGE structures with them. They are amazingly strong.<br/>
<br/>
They can use tape to hold them together and can tape flat newspapers in <br/>
between to make walls.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631293537">I wanted to add - if a kid is thinking maybe he&#39;d like to be an architect or <br/>
whatever - remember he doesn&#39;t have to WAIT to start learning about it and <br/>
becoming involved in it. <br/>
<br/>
One part of unschooling is that children&#39;s interests matter now - we help <br/>
them pursue them now - at their own ability level (which can sometimes be <br/>
very high if they really turn out to be truly interested).<br/>

Just don&#39;t ask me anything about how to keep a house clean or tidy. I&#39;m a <br/>
complete failure as a housekeeper. Total abysmal absolute failure. I&#39;ve <br/>
always been. I have a GREAT desire to live in a lovely, reasonably orderly, <br/>
peaceful and did I mention reasonably orderly home. I have no idea how to <br/>
achieve that without giving up other things that take up my time. Like what <br/>
I&#39;m doing right now &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can *so* relate to this!<br/>
A friend of mine recommended James Michener, when she found out I <br/>
hadn&#39;t read any fiction for a few years(except outloud to my kids), <br/>
and I picked out Chesapeake(I live in that area).  It&#39;s pretty thick <br/>
and I am hesitant to start because my now only semi trashed house <br/>
will become completely trashed if this book captures me.  <br/>
It happens when I take on a project or get particularly involved in <br/>
the message board or here, or the weather is too nice and we&#39;re off <br/>
to the beach day after day.....dirty clothes and dishes pile up, <br/>
floors become in desparate need of cleaning/vacuuming(no 10 second <br/>
rule here.  if it drops on the floor it&#39;s sure to be covered with dog <br/>
hair,crumbs, dirt....).<br/>
I get &quot;good&quot; for a day or 2(and usually grumpy)and the house looks <br/>
decent, but i really can&#39;t keep it up day in and day out.  I would go <br/>
insane!!<br/>

DO you find that people often compliment you on how organized you are <br/>
when you are away from home?  <br/>
My house is usually a disaster area.  There are just too many thing <br/>
going on at once to keep it Martha Stuart-ed up all the time.  But <br/>
I&#39;ve often had nurses, co-workers (when I worked), acquaintences <br/>
comment on how organized I am.  I alway get a kick out of that because <br/>
I feel like one of the least organized people I know!<br/>
