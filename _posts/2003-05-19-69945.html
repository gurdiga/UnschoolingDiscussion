&lt;&lt; He picked up that stuff from watching Arthur &lt;gag&gt;, schooled cousins, <br/>
and from other adults (in stores, the dentist, etc.) going &quot;What grade <br/>
are you in?&quot; and stuff like that.  So far he&#39;s viewing the age &quot;levels&quot; <br/>
as things like getting to the next &quot;level&quot;/challenge in a computer game <br/>
and that&#39;s ok.  He&#39;s mostly past the &quot;but I have to be X years old to do <br/>
____ &quot; bit. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Aha!!  Two ideas:<br/>
<br/>
Holly and another homeschooling family (with three kids her age +/-)<br/>
LOVE Arthur.  They love the soap opera of it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
They discuss how it has changed over the years, how some characters have <br/>
changed specifically.<br/>
<br/>
They see that and Dragontales as PBS propaganda to make kids like school, and <br/>
to help kids adjust to the fact that in school other kids won&#39;t always be <br/>
nice.  (Barney, too.) They&#39;re very analytical about that.  It&#39;s like studying <br/>
a foreign culture for them, almost, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
If your son is running a parallel of ages and stages, tell him he has the <br/>
codes to by pass going level by level as the schoolkids have to do.  Tell him <br/>
he the programmer&#39;s codes to come in at any point and to save!  He can go to <br/>
level one last if he wants, and doesn&#39;t have to go in order.<br/>
