<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106003477">&lt;SNIP&gt;Try using something to bind the matresses together &gt;(like the<br/>
infinately long and very strong celephane wrap that &gt;you get at moving<br/>
supply places, or even just some srong &gt;flat ribbon wrapped several times<br/>
around the matresses.  &gt;Then put a foam pad over the whole thing, eggcrate,<br/>
or &gt;whatever.  You can mail order a king size foam pad, if there &gt;is no<br/>
place available to get one near you.  See if that works.<br/>

it every year when we go on vacation with my in-laws.  It worked better when<br/>
we were in student housing because we used the metal king-sized frame to put<br/>
the twin sets on, that seemed to help hold them together and the egg crate<br/>
mattress provided some extra padding for me (the lucky one in the middle).<br/>
When on vacation we just push the two twin beds together and the extra<br/>
sideboards keep it from staying together well.<br/>
