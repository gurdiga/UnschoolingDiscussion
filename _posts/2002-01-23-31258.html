 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re moderated, Pat. Maybe you&#39;ve experienced lists where the owner <br/>
or somebody reads every single post before they ship them all out. <br/>
This list isn&#39;t set up like that, though. There are two moderators <br/>
and if things get a little ugly, I assume they intervene in an <br/>
appropriate way.  We&#39;ve been so good, though, we&#39;ve been making their <br/>
job easy. Just before you joined the list, the moderators were <br/>
appointed due to lots of flames and daggers being tossed about. <br/>
<br/>
This is a good place to toss ideas around and get other views you may <br/>
have not considered. Thanks for setting it up, Helen! I really enjoy <br/>
it here. I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t opt to shut it down~<br/>
