&gt; Thought I&#39;d add my two cents on the food allergies. <br/>
&gt; My3yo has eczema, red <br/>
&gt; cheeks and behavior changes caused by allergies to<br/>
&gt; milk and wheat!  Then my <br/>
&gt; 1yo projectile vomits (as in 8 times in one hour!)<br/>
&gt; from soy and eggs!!! Do <br/>
&gt; you realize how much stuff out there has these<br/>
&gt; products? UGH!!! So we have <br/>
&gt; become VERY organic lately! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Michelle, Please forgive me if I am misunderstanding<br/>
you but you do realize that Organic only means &quot;not<br/>
grow with pesticides&quot;. So unless your children are<br/>
allergic to the pesticides (which we know are bad for<br/>
us all) going Organic will not solve the allergy<br/>
problem. Have you thought about seeing a Homeopath or<br/>
a natural healer who deals with allergies? I believe I<br/>
mentioned on this list my DD who through Homeopathy is<br/>
asthma free! (it was food allergy related)<br/>
Something to think about<br/>
best of luck<br/>

 The one thing I have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; learned is that I can <br/>
&gt; trace 3 of the 4 allergies back to my diet when I<br/>
&gt; was pregnant with them!!! <br/>
&gt; I have also stumbled upon this concept in a few<br/>
&gt; books!  So, if any of you <br/>
&gt; are dealing with food allergies and considering<br/>
&gt; having more children, watch <br/>
&gt; your diet when you&#39;re pregnant.  The biggest thing I<br/>
&gt; learned was to not eat <br/>
&gt; the same foods all the time and not eating only<br/>
&gt; craved foods!  You ought to <br/>
&gt; see me watching for the right child to grab the soy<br/>
&gt; milk and the other to <br/>
&gt; grab the cow&#39;s milk in our house!  No vacations or<br/>
&gt; visits to other houses <br/>
&gt; for dinner for awhile! We&#39;re just getting the hang<br/>
&gt; of this.<br/>
