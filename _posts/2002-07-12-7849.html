<br/>
I am doing Two Gentlemen of Verona with a local group called Montford Park <br/>
Players &quot;North Carolina&#39;s oldest continuing Shakespeare company&quot;.  I have two <br/>
parts.<br/>
<br/>
I play Lucetta (a maid to one of the love interests) and my costume is a long <br/>
sleeved underdress made from a very tight-weave cotton/poly and an overdress <br/>
(some name that starts with a &quot;t&quot;) that is a lovely sage green but looks like <br/>
it used to be bedroom drapes. Also tights, slippers and a head covering in <br/>
&quot;snood&quot; fashion. <br/>
<br/>
I also play Thurio (as I call him, &quot; the sleazy suitor&quot;).  He is not written <br/>
as a flaming queen, but that&#39;s the way he&#39;s chosen to reveal himself this <br/>
time.  The costume is black, above-the-knee pants (with the same tights and <br/>
slippers from Lucetta), a purple doublet with double sleeves (cut-outs you <br/>
know), a purple cape, a lacy ruff and cuffs, black velvet hat with plume and <br/>
a belt with sword and purple velvet purse.<br/>
<br/>
The additional challenge is that during Act I (i.e. before intermission, not <br/>
according to the script) I must go from Lucetta to Thurio and back to <br/>
Lucetta.  Act II is only Thurio.  Tis interesting and very fun.  The cast is <br/>
tight and we had a blast on Wed. when we just danced around the stage to the <br/>
pre-show and intermission music (which is cheatin&#39; songs from the 50&#39;s-80&#39;s <br/>
country, pop, rock, easy listening).  Of course, that rehearsal ran 5 hours, <br/>
but at least it was fun in the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Will let you know how it goes.  Curtain is in 4 hours!<br/>
