<div id="ygrps-yiv-456132655">I did a google on unschooling and this girls picture popped up in the list with Smokey Lake under it so I thought I&#39;d take a look.  Yup she&#39;s from Smokey Lake, Alberta, Canada not too far from me.  Thought some may be interested in what one unschooling teen is up to.

It&#39;s amazingly original and wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
She has a page of advice to parents starting to homeschool, too.<br/>

Not all of her links are on every page, so if you go there, follow a couple <br/>
of trails if you have time.<br/>
