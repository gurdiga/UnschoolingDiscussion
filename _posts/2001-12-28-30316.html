Tonight, I baked a cake from scratch with youngest dd. We measured, <br/>
sifted, beat... you name it, we did it. We *even* cut out the wax <br/>
paper liners for the bottoms of the cake pans like Granny used to do!<br/>
Then it came time to ice the three-layer cake.<br/>
LOLOLOLOLOLOL.......................<br/>
There&#39;s blue tinted icing and rose tinted icing all OVER the counter. <br/>
We ran out of icing so only half the cake is decorated. My kitchen is <br/>
a disaster zone! I think I just made up for all my poor parenting <br/>
tonight... DD had a blast!<br/>
Taking cake orders... call early to get our most &#39;creative&#39; <br/>
creations!<br/>
