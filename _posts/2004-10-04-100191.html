<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138152913">Just tonight my daughter said &#39;why to they always end the movie with the<br/>
wedding?&quot;  We had just finished watching &quot;Ella Enchanted.&quot;  She wants to<br/>
see what life after a wedding looks like (Mom and Dad don&#39;t count ;-)<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve been thinking about it, and I can&#39;t think of a movie that shows<br/>
the wedding at the beginning of the movie (except for Shrek II, which<br/>
didn&#39;t fit the bill for her.)  Since there was such a great flurry of<br/>
Comfort Movie suggestions, I thought perhaps folks here might have some<br/>
ideas for me -- movies showing life after the wedding.  Oh, my daughter is<br/>
almost 6, doesn&#39;t like scary stuff, is OK with lovey dovey stuff, but not<br/>
too grown up.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, she really didn&#39;t like the Ella Enchanted movie (although the only<br/>
&quot;real&quot; problem for her was when Ella had the knife - won&#39;t spoil it, just<br/>
in case) because she thought the book was soooo much better!  We knew this<br/>
about the movie before we started, and during the movie she kept<br/>
complaining to the TV about how it wasn&#39;t really suppose to be this way.<br/>

<br/>
Shakespeare&#39;s comedies end with weddings (sometimes double to quadruple <br/>
weddings).<br/>
Lots of fairy tales end with weddings.<br/>
It&#39;s not just movies.<br/>
<br/>
Not a movie, but The Brady Bunch starts with a wedding. &lt;g&gt;  Maybe not <br/>
literally.<br/>
Most movies that deal with couples don&#39;t show the first of the marriage, but <br/>
the after-they-had-kids part.<br/>

Margaret Something Haddix wrote a Cinderella variation called _Just <br/>
Ella_, that starts when Prince Charming and Cinderella are betrothed, <br/>
and Cinderella comes to live at the palace -- and hates it.<br/>
<br/>
I read the book about a month ago and thought it was well-done.  I don&#39;t <br/>
recommend it for younger or sensitive kids because there is a scene <br/>
where Ella is in the dungeon and is threatened that the troll-like guard <br/>
might rape her if she doesn&#39;t cooperate.  (It doesn&#39;t happen.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh, shoot, your daughter is definitely too young for the Just Ella <br/>
book.  But don&#39;t some of the Disney cartoons have (cheaply made) <br/>
sequels?  Pocohontas has a sequel, and so does Cinderella, now.<br/>

and the Princess right after they get married.</div>

<br/>
There&#39;s that recent movie I think called &quot;Newlyweds&quot; about a disastrous<br/>
honeymoon??? But that is a comedy so probably not very realistic.<br/>
<br/>
Nick and Nora Charles get married towards the end of the first &quot;Thin Man&quot;,<br/>
but then every subsequent movie they are married, and very supportive of<br/>
each other. <br/>
<br/>
She might like &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; - the original also with Myrna Loy, (I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen the recent version) and the sequel. The original &quot;Father of the<br/>
Bride&quot; (Spencer Tracey, Elizabeth Taylor) ends with a wedding, but it also<br/>
has a sequel, &quot;Father&#39;s Little Dividend&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
How about a truly horrible vision of married life - &quot;Who&#39;s Afraid of<br/>
Virginia Woolfe&quot;? Or maybe &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. Just Kidding!!! I must<br/>
have Liz on the brain for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter has just encountered *the* perennial problem of adapting books<br/>
to the screen. Remember the threads about LOTR. I still shudder at the<br/>
events around Faramir (although I liked the actor in the role), and the<br/>
goofy kid quality that Merry and Pippin maintained through all the pics.<br/>

realistic or healthy.  They mostly supported each others drinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575145385">This isn&#39;t quite what you asked for, but if you liked the book Ella<br/>
Enchanted, you should get _Just Ella_.  It&#39;s not about after the wedding,<br/>
but after Cinderella falls for the prince and goes off to live in the castle<br/>
and get married.  She becomes very disillusioned with him, and the results<br/>
are pretty interesting.  We listened to it on tape and all of us really<br/>
enjoyed it.<br/>

Miner&#39;s Daughter.&quot;  Might be too mature...they get married and on the  wedding <br/>
night Loretta Lynn freaks out because she&#39;s just not &quot;ready.&quot;  She  has this <br/>
dreamy idea of what life will be like and they split up at one  point.  They end <br/>
up back together and the next scene she&#39;s in the kitchen  feeding and singing <br/>
to 4 kids...definately shows married life&#39;s ups and  downs...he really <br/>
supports her career, but cheats on her once...they stay  together though.<br/>

It&#39;s a GREAT movie...her relationship with her daddy was very  sweet...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386699791">Has she seen The Brave Little Toaster?  Perhaps it is too young for a <br/>
6 year old (??) But, there are three movies: The Brave Little <br/>
Toaster; The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue; and The Brave Little <br/>
Toaster Goes To Mars.  It&#39;s an animation with technological plug in <br/>
devices as the main characters.  Through out the three movies, &#39;the <br/>
master&#39; is seen as a baby, grows up, goes to college, has a <br/>
girlfriend, gets married, has his own baby.  My three year old loves <br/>
it, and I think it&#39;s pretty cute (especially the first one) even <br/>
though there are some things that I don&#39;t appreciate (like their baby <br/>
being bottle fed first thing coming home from the hospital rather <br/>
than breastfeeding and the baby sleeping in a crib for example). I <br/>
believe the second movie does end in a wedding, but the third movie <br/>
could be seen as &#39;what happens after the wedding&#39;.  All in your <br/>
traditional sense, of course.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638580938">Hi,<br/>
If you&#39;re interested in the &quot;Cinderella&quot; style movies, a cool movie <br/>
with a twist on the typical is &quot;Ever After&quot; with Drew Barrymore.  <br/>
It&#39;s pretty to watch and all, and she does become a princess in the <br/>
end, but it has a more &quot;realistic&quot; approach to telling the story, no <br/>
magic involved.  Nice for a change (nothing against magic)!  It&#39;s <br/>
a &quot;girl power&quot; film, ala Drew B&#39;s style.  My girls think Drew rocks <br/>
so it&#39;s a favorite round here.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what happens after marriage, &quot;The Story of Us&quot; with Bruce <br/>
Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer comes to mind.  Maybe not the greatest <br/>
movie, maybe not for your young daughter (?), but it&#39;s kind of a <br/>
realistic representation of what happens after marriage FOR SOME OF <br/>
US anyway :).  A kind of cute comedy that I think starts with a <br/>
wedding then goes onto the after wedding aspect is &quot;She&#39;s Having a <br/>
Baby&quot;.  And I like &quot;Hope Floats&quot;, but it&#39;s more of an after-marriage <br/>
(divorce) movie.<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend I saw &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; with Jim <br/>
Carey.  That has nothing to do with princesses or marriages, but I <br/>
loved it and wanted to recommend it!<br/>
