&gt; In the movie, I suppose maybe to make the races easier to distinguish, the<br/>
&gt; two humans (Boromir and Aragon) looked quite a bit too much like one another<br/>
&gt; for my tastes.<br/>
<br/>

managed to plow through the novels in the first place.  But visually, they<br/>
were as alike to me as a pair of Bobbsey twins.<br/>

&gt; Sometimes in casting a movie people aren&#39;t careful to get really different<br/>
&gt; looking people and it&#39;s hard for me to get the characters straight at first.<br/>
&gt; That happened with Sum of all Fears.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always panic a little, inside when I set out to watch a movie and there<br/>
are a lots of guys in suits.  I just know for sure I&#39;m going to mix them up<br/>
in my head.  It&#39;s better if I am familiar with the actors and know them from<br/>
other places, but then that is a hump to get over too.  (&quot;He&#39;s Harrison<br/>
Ford, no he&#39;s this other guy now, no, but he&#39;s still Harrison Ford...&quot; in my<br/>
head, until I can get into the movie.)<br/>

My best guess was it was their way to show humans looking like other humans <br/>
(since the elves and hobbits also looked surprisingly like humans &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I was way familiar with the story, and still the first time I saw it I would <br/>
have to think.  I finally started going by costume to tell Aragorn at a <br/>
glance from Boromir.<br/>

Now, I&#39;ve always liked Sean Bean as an actor ( Boromir) so it was easy for me to separate him form Aragorn! lol! Leonie W. <br/>
