<div id="ygrps-yiv-472456150">Hi, I&#39;ve just joined this list and read the introductions so far this<br/>
morning.  I guess the list is growing by leaps and bounds judging from the<br/>
number of intros today.  That&#39;s wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kim and I&#39;m from Pennsylvania.  I am 36 and have three<br/>
children...My son Chris is 14, my daughter Brandy is 11, and my daughter<br/>
Tabitha is 4.<br/>
<br/>
Although I&#39;ve homeschooled for five years I&#39;ve only been on the Internet for<br/>
less than one.  The way I homeschooled for the first four years was scary.<br/>
Mom against child.  Child against mom.  Fear and anger abounded as I tried<br/>
to make a meticulous log and fill it with the most impossible stuff.  ie:<br/>
Math pages 92-97, Social Studies, pages 65-72, answer questions on 72, and<br/>
on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Then this past February I was surfing around in Onelist and found a<br/>
Pennyslvania list for homeschoolers that didn&#39;t mention unschooling.  (I ran<br/>
from the &quot;unschooling&quot; lists as they seemed to me to be blatantly illegal<br/>
and horrifying).  It turned out that the Pa list was open to all from Pa but<br/>
the majority of the members were minimalist at the least and unschoolers if<br/>
the truth be told.  It opened my eyes and my heart to this method of<br/>
learning and I&#39;ve never turned back.<br/>
<br/>
My home is happy again, my daughter Brandy is enjoying her education and<br/>
learning alot.  She doesn&#39;t get beat up at school because she isn&#39;t there.<br/>
Noone teases her because at 11 she doesn&#39;t wear makeup or shave her legs (I<br/>
won&#39;t let her, poor kid) and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
We had such horrible experiences homeschooling that I sent the children back<br/>
to school last September and all of those things were happening to Brandy on<br/>
a daily basis so we brought her home again.  Chris was impossible at home so<br/>
we left him in school, we&#39;ll see for the fall where he will be this year.<br/>
<br/>
I think this way of life is the best thing for a child.  It&#39;s incredible<br/>
that so few people dare it.  I look at my four year old who was supposed to<br/>
be retarded (she was a micro preemie) and see someone who learns everyday in<br/>
everyway.  She was singled out in her preschool for testing because they<br/>
think she&#39;s years ahead.  So if that&#39;s how little one&#39;s learn, just by<br/>
doing, why did we take these big kids and stick them in an unnatural<br/>
learning environment and expect them to become world leaders?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the light and if I make it through evaluation time and the school<br/>
superintendent doesn&#39;t try to throw me in jail, I will continue to teach my<br/>
children in the unschooling way for the rest of their childhoods.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for having me!<br/>
<br/>

Wow Kim!  What a story!  I&#39;m so sorry that your initial years of <br/>
homeschooling were not so hot.  I read John Holt when my oldest child was <br/>
2ish and I&#39;ve never looked back.  I did not have a particularly stellar <br/>
school career, it wasn&#39;t awful, but I was vaguely miserable most of the time. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to hear why unschooling as a concept felt horrifying to you.  <br/>
Were you around any other homeschoolers who thought negatively about the <br/>
issue?  Part of my work is trying to showcase unschooling so that others <br/>
might consider it, so anything you have to say would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

&gt;children...My son Chris is 14, my daughter Brandy is 11, and my daughter<br/>
&gt;Tabitha is 4.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I just joined today also. My name is Lois, my two sons left school two<br/>
years ago and are now 14 and 11. We&#39;re from PA too!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Although I&#39;ve homeschooled for five years I&#39;ve only been on the Internet for<br/>
&gt;less than one.  The way I homeschooled for the first four years was scary.<br/>

&gt;Math pages 92-97, Social Studies, pages 65-72, answer questions on 72, and<br/>
&gt;on and on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I too tried this as I was worried about evaluations and turning in our logs<br/>
and portfolios. But that lasted about two months, my oldest and I went<br/>
rounds on this and my youngest wasn&#39;t comprehending much. I had read the<br/>
teenage liberation handbook and knew that would work with my oldest so we<br/>
started with him to see if unschooling really worked. From there it didn&#39;t<br/>
take long to change the way my youngest got to spend the day.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;My home is happy again, my daughter Brandy is enjoying her education and<br/>
&gt;learning alot.  She doesn&#39;t get beat up at school because she isn&#39;t there.<br/>
&gt;Noone teases her because at 11 she doesn&#39;t wear makeup or shave her legs (I<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t let her, poor kid) and on and on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We had such horrible experiences homeschooling that I sent the children back<br/>
&gt;to school last September and all of those things were happening to Brandy on<br/>
&gt;a daily basis so we brought her home again. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How horrible, but from our schools here, I know your district isn&#39;t the<br/>
exception.  Our district went k-4, 5-8, 9-12. My oldest had so much trouble<br/>
in the middle school that I knew I didn&#39;t want my youngest to ever walk<br/>
into the 5th grade here. <br/>
<br/>
My youngest was diagnosed ADD, but I&#39;ve learned that ADD (for us) isn&#39;t a<br/>
problem at all unless we want to consider school again. My youngest now has<br/>
gotten back his self esteem and doing wonderful things, with the help of a<br/>
neighbor he learned how to build computers and sold his first complete<br/>
computer to our evaluator last week!!!  We joke that we won&#39;t have to prove<br/>
to the evaluator that unschooling works here! <br/>
<br/>
 Chris was impossible at home so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;we left him in school, we&#39;ll see for the fall where he will be this year.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can relate to this also. We had such problems with our oldest that it<br/>
made home a horrible place for everyone. When he learned that I was<br/>
planning on hsing his brother he bugged to be allowed to come home. I<br/>
couldn&#39;t imagine having him home all the time, the tension just after<br/>
school was already too much. But within days of him leaving school he<br/>
became a totally different person. Now that isn&#39;t to say that when I pulled<br/>
teacher mode we got along much better, but he was smart enough to open my<br/>
eyes to the fact that he did intend to broaden his horizons. Once he felt<br/>
that his life was more in his control, he was back to a wonderful part of<br/>
the family. <br/>
Good luck, I&#39;m sure you will all find the right decision between you.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; why did we take these big kids and stick them in an unnatural<br/>
&gt;learning environment and expect them to become world leaders?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of my favorite quotes was from Einstein. He stated that after leaving<br/>
school it took him a couple of years to find a way to enjoy experimentation<br/>
again. Just think how different our world would have been if he didn&#39;t find<br/>
the spark inside himself again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve seen the light and if I make it through evaluation time and the school<br/>
&gt;superintendent doesn&#39;t try to throw me in jail, I will continue to teach my<br/>
&gt;children in the unschooling way for the rest of their childhoods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hopefully you won&#39;t find yourself in jail.lol.  I haven&#39;t had any problems<br/>
here. We found an evaluator who was wonderful, (yes the same one who bought<br/>
the computer). His wife teaches at home using all ABeka curriculum, but he<br/>
says that he looks forward to doing our evaluations because we do such<br/>
interesting things!  He has written wonderful add ons to our evaluation for<br/>
my son each year and approved my oldest&#39;s wish to jump a grade from 7th-9th<br/>
by demonstrating just how much he learned in one year unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
When looking for an evaluator, we asked others in the area, then narrowed<br/>
it down to a couple individuals. From there we simply made a phone call to<br/>
each asking them if they had openings and describing the educational<br/>
opinion that we held (being that unschooling/child led was the only way to<br/>
learn) We were open about our lack of textbooks/workbooks. The individual<br/>
we choose was open about the fact that he&#39;d never evaluated anyone using an<br/>
unschooling approach but if we&#39;d bring examples of things my son used he<br/>
would give us an honest evaluation. I wouldn&#39;t change evaluators for<br/>
anything at this point.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would like to hear why unschooling as a concept felt horrifying to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Lisa, I think there are others like me out there, others who have been<br/>
told by other people that homeschooling had to be done in a very regimented<br/>
way.  The friend who scared me to death was one who is very intelligent and<br/>
usually reliable.  Her son is in school but she said she knew of families<br/>
that were arrested for not homeschooling correctly.  She said that in her<br/>
district they force you to work the hours the school children are in school<br/>
and use a curriculum or the school&#39;s books.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard from many people, most who aren&#39;t homeschoolers, I must admit,<br/>
that their friends (always a friend, never a personal experience) were in<br/>
trouble for not having a detailed log of daily schooling activities and<br/>
work.  In fact, my landlady is a teacher and last year she turned me in to<br/>
children and youth.  Although Children and Youth said the accusation was<br/>
unfounded they were forced to make several visits, according to their rules.<br/>
They even looked into my children&#39;s health records by writing to their<br/>
doctors.  The landlady said that the woman before me was arrested for not<br/>
homeschooling &quot;according to the state&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of misinformation out there.  A lot of people don&#39;t have a<br/>
clue as to how easy and rewarding homeschooling really is.  They are<br/>
cowering, just as I was, and if they dare attempt it, as I did, they do it<br/>
in such a rigid way as to make life miserable for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I wish there was a forum to get to everyone, especially those who don&#39;t have<br/>
computers and those who don&#39;t know how to use the one&#39;s they have, and shout<br/>
to them that unschooling is LEGAL and a way of life. That if they don&#39;t feel<br/>
like multiplying fractions today they can go for a walk, or bake a cake, or<br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
The only ones who know about unschooling and minimalism are the one&#39;s who<br/>
know someone who&#39;s doing it.  Those that don&#39;t, who have been warned that<br/>
they will be arrested for not having a rigid curriculum, will see the word<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; and be filled with terror as I was.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this disjointed bunch of emotional words can help explain what I felt<br/>
in some way.  The main idea, I guess, is to make certain that new visitors<br/>
to your site, and those that see your list description, are told that<br/>
unschooling is an acceptable way of life and that state laws do not deny you<br/>
the right to do it.<br/>
<br/>
If I hadn&#39;t learned about unschooling I would still be more of a mean<br/>
teacher to my children than a mother.  We would still be up until all hours<br/>
of the night and on weekends trying to make up work we couldn&#39;t fit in<br/>
during the day.  It changed our lives and gave us back our happiness and our<br/>
love for each other.  Thank you to you and those like you who are working to<br/>
spread the word that there is a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Yours, Kim</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s great, just what I wanted. Most of the evaluators I found test your<br/>
child to make sure they are where they &quot;should&quot; be. He doesn&#39;t test, he<br/>
will ask about things he sees in the portfolio and finds interesting then<br/>
watches the child to see how interested he/she was in the activity. My son<br/>
shares his favorite book titles and stuff with this guy and they get into<br/>
quite a discussion on their views of history. This way the interview is fun<br/>
for both of them, but he can really see the wide span of interests and<br/>
knowledge my son has acquired on his own.  It seems to take longer than<br/>
most evaluations IMO, taking 1.5 to 2 hours long, but for $20 that&#39;s not<br/>
bad.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the things that he found interesting for my son&#39;s last years<br/>
evaluation was his role in a hsing play. My son had the lead, and since his<br/>
daughter was in the play he attended one of the shows. So in the evaluation<br/>
he wrote a raving review of my sons performance stating for the district<br/>
that he&#39;d seen him.  This year it was our two weeks living at the Winona<br/>
Farm meeting other unschoolers from Australia that were living there and<br/>
the things we learned through this that got the center attention on the<br/>
portfolio.  If you haven&#39;t heard of Winona Farm check out<br/>

&gt;told by other people that homeschooling had to be done in a very regimented<br/>
&gt;way. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me it was all the people who quickly reminded me that although I had my<br/>
bachelors degree in Business, I wasn&#39;t very good at the higher levels of<br/>
math. Geometry was good, Algebra I suffered in terribly in high school so I<br/>
avoided all the math I could in college. I was told that having my children<br/>
home would be okay when they were little, but how was I ever going to help<br/>
them with algebra or calculus. Luckily for us, I jumped in without thinking<br/>
about all the reasons I shouldn&#39;t hs.  What I learned was that if my child<br/>
wanted to learn something he would and I don&#39;t have to know everything<br/>
first. Our first year home, they actually taught me things I&#39;d never been<br/>
exposed to. Since that we now take it forgranted that we will be sharing<br/>
with each other and can learn so much more that way.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 The friend who scared me to death was one who is very intelligent and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;usually reliable.  Her son is in school but she said she knew of families<br/>

&gt;and use a curriculum or the school&#39;s books.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d heard this too. I figured I could pretend to do the same number of<br/>
hours since I&#39;d been in the school and saw first hand how much time was<br/>
wasted. Then my landlord who also homeschools gave me copies of the law.<br/>
I&#39;ve counted days and never hours as I believe the hours are first too<br/>
timeconsuming to figure out (esp. when we don&#39;t DO subjects) but also<br/>
because it makes more sense to just count the days.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve heard from many people, most who aren&#39;t homeschoolers, I must admit,<br/>
&gt;that their friends (always a friend, never a personal experience) were in<br/>
&gt;trouble for not having a detailed log of daily schooling activities and<br/>
&gt;work. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s amazing how many people are actually in trouble isn&#39;t it&lt;g&gt;? I came to<br/>
the conclusion that most people are threatened by the idea of hsing and<br/>
although most having good intentions will let the rumors fly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 In fact, my landlady is a teacher and last year she turned me in to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;children and youth. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How horrible.<br/>
<br/>
 Although Children and Youth said the accusation was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;unfounded they were forced to make several visits, according to their rules.<br/>
&gt;They even looked into my children&#39;s health records by writing to their<br/>
&gt;doctors.  The landlady said that the woman before me was arrested for not<br/>
&gt;homeschooling &quot;according to the state&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She rented to someone else who hsed?  I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s any of her<br/>
business.  How you hs is an issue between you, your children, the<br/>
evaluator, and the district. Others have no right to but in IMO.  Do you<br/>
still rent from this woman?  I&#39;d have a hard time being civil towards her,<br/>
I give you a lot of credit.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;There is a lot of misinformation out there.  A lot of people don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt;clue as to how easy and rewarding homeschooling really is.  They are<br/>
&gt;cowering, just as I was, and if they dare attempt it, as I did, they do it<br/>
&gt;in such a rigid way as to make life miserable for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not only that, but a neighbor and I were talking about hsing today at the<br/>
library. She&#39;s taking the steps to withdraw her son for next year. A woman<br/>
came over and said she was sorry,but she&#39;d been listening in to us. She<br/>
said it would seem like a good thing with the way the schools are, but she<br/>
couldn&#39;t handle to be home with her  kids all day.  I had a similar problem<br/>
with my oldest so I guess I could relate, but what she doesn&#39;t realize is<br/>
that without a lot of the pressures of school her children could be much<br/>
more relaxed at home and she might find that they could be a really close<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wish there was a forum to get to everyone, especially those who don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt;computers and those who don&#39;t know how to use the one&#39;s they have, and shout<br/>

&gt;like multiplying fractions today they can go for a walk, or bake a cake, or<br/>
&gt;whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wouldn&#39;t that be nice?  Another mom and I tried to start a hs support group<br/>
last year, but found ourselves being judged by the families who showed up.<br/>
They came to show us how to hs, and their way was school at home. To them<br/>
there was no other way.<br/>

8:50 - .....<br/>
<br/>
and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
So for a long time that is exactly what I did.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a popular misconception that homeschooling had to be just like school.<br/>
I know others who have operated under those misconceptions as well.<br/>
<br/>
For years I privately homeschooled in my own way and asked my children to<br/>
provide me with examples of pages from textbooks to prove we were doing it<br/>
their way.<br/>
<br/>
I was so glad to find out that my way was just as legal.  Now I&#39;m even more<br/>
relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe though, that if I was not sitting at the table with my children<br/>
working on a collage we were making about school violence and one about drug<br/>
abuse at the time Children and Youth showed up that I might have had a real<br/>
fight on my hands.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that public education about homeschooling is seriously needed.<br/>

in grades 3,5,8.  Each year we also have to turn in a portfolio with a log<br/>
covering 180 days. My district is very easy going, so it doesnt&#39; seem like<br/>
as much work as it sounds.<br/>

 &lt;&lt;Hi Lisa, I think there are others like me out there, others who have been<br/>
 told by other people that homeschooling had to be done in a very regimented<br/>
 way.  The friend who scared me to death was one who is very intelligent and<br/>
 usually reliable.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.. Why do people DO this???  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve heard from many people, most who aren&#39;t homeschoolers, I must admit,<br/>
 that their friends (always a friend, never a personal experience) were in<br/>
 trouble for not having a detailed log of daily schooling activities and<br/>
 work. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Said very gently..... why would you listen to people who weren&#39;t hsing???  I <br/>
do know of some homeschoolers who have great disdain for unschooling and <br/>
pretty much deride it when asked, but non-hsers haven&#39;t a clue.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; In fact, my landlady is a teacher and last year she turned me in to<br/>
 children and youth.  Although Children and Youth said the accusation was<br/>
 unfounded they were forced to make several visits, according to their rules.<br/>
 They even looked into my children&#39;s health records by writing to their<br/>
 doctors.  The landlady said that the woman before me was arrested for not<br/>
 homeschooling &quot;according to the state&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
ARGH.  I can&#39;t disucss things like this coherently and calmly.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;There is a lot of misinformation out there.  A lot of people don&#39;t have a<br/>
 clue as to how easy and rewarding homeschooling really is.  They are<br/>
 cowering, just as I was, and if they dare attempt it, as I did, they do it<br/>
 in such a rigid way as to make life miserable for everyone.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, anytime you see some misinformation out there you send it to me. &lt;VBG&gt;  <br/>
Where could we put information so they can get to it?  Is there somewhere <br/>
that we are just missing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, they are... we&#39;ll keep plugging away at getting the info out there. Any <br/>
idea where we could send flyers? or plant a magazine?<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;  It changed our lives and gave us back our happiness and our<br/>
 love for each other.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anytime you have the time to write about how the changes have affected your <br/>
family, I know of a place that might want to include your story. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774465255">Thank you Lisa, I wish I did have an idea of where to place information to<br/>
get to the people who aren&#39;t looking for it.  If I had known 5 years ago<br/>
what I know now I could have saved my family alot of hardship.  Thank God I<br/>
found the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
If you know of a place where I might be able to tell people how their lives<br/>
might be changed the way ours was with a change from rigidity to unschooling<br/>
then please lead the way.  I know several people who feel as I do, that the<br/>
word has to get out before more families spend more time unneccessarily<br/>
suffering in rules and regulations they don&#39;t have to follow.  It is so much<br/>
easier to go to bed at night when you know you haven&#39;t kept your children up<br/>
until midnight to complete work.  I did this time after time, living in<br/>
fear, I mean real fear, that someone will knock on my door in the morning<br/>
and demand to see our up to date work.  In fact, I&#39;d even set books out on<br/>
the table overnight with half done work to prove we&#39;d been working our<br/>
collective butts off!<br/>
<br/>
Yours, Kim</div>

easy, but others like PA are so much harder, and as others have said some <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727738185">&lt;&lt;I would like to hear why unschooling as a concept felt horrifying <br/>
to you. Were you around any other homeschoolers who thought <br/>
negatively about the issue? Part of my work is trying to showcase <br/>
unschooling so that others might consider it, so anything you have <br/>
to say would be greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Sll<br/>
I am new to the group, name is Laura in SC, and I am new to the <br/>
whole concept of Unschooling. I was reading some of the posts and <br/>
this one caught my attention. Personally, I LOVE the idea of <br/>
unschooling....it seems so natural, and, after off and on <br/>
homeschool/private school for my five oldest children (16, 14, 12, <br/>
11 & 9....we also have 4 & 3)...I am looking forward to what the <br/>
years ahead will reveal. My biggest concern, or dilema, if you will, <br/>
is that I find myself being &quot;secretive&quot; about it with <br/>
family/friends. Avoiding direct questions about what we are doing <br/>
for school or questions like after our Christmas break, the question <br/>
was &quot;so are you back to school yet?&quot;  My family has doubts that I <br/>
can handle homeschooling the children...they feel I&#39;ve failed in the <br/>
past. I don&#39;t think I have, infact, after basically &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
for two years and then putting the children back into a private <br/>
school, they all tested at or above &quot;grade&quot; level in all subjects <br/>
except for math. To make a long story longer...my biggest fear is <br/>
NOT trusting God for the responses and just say we are trying &quot;child-<br/>
led&quot; or interest-led learning over your tradition textbooks. Anyone <br/>
else out there that has or has had this same &quot;phobea&quot; that can <br/>
provide some insight for me?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798799058">When people ask, &quot;Are you back at school yet?&quot; I just say, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I say, &quot;We never left,&quot; but that depends on my audience. I know<br/>
some unschoolers get upset with any use of school-ish language, but I&#39;ll use<br/>
it with strangers and others because it is the language that strangers and<br/>
others understand. I don&#39;t feel like I need to explain unschooling to anyone<br/>
who asks a casual question.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t discuss how we school with people who are very locked into<br/>
curriculums and think we&#39;re being neglectful for using a more holistic<br/>
approach. I think vague, but confident answers work well for all but the<br/>
closest family members, who will insist on knowing more information. And,<br/>
oftentimes, closest family members are the least likely to be &quot;supportive&quot;<br/>
anyway -- some of them would be fussing no matter what you were doing, and I<br/>
think it shows more about them than about your life with your children.<br/>
Although I miss my family, I also appreciate living relatively far from them<br/>
because of these kinds of issues.<br/>
