<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951192840">I was going to put the morning glories page up, and I thought I should make a <br/>
page on tumbleweeds and one on goatheads too.  So I  took some seedling <br/>
photos, and was going to do that this morning. <br/>
<br/>
I was having SO much fun with the tumbleweed page that I worked on it for <br/>
hours.  It was like a big report, like a science project, I felt all botanical <br/>
and was surprised at how much I already knew.  It was a blast making that page, <br/>
and I&#39;ll have to keep it updated as my two plants get bigger.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up starting a page for Egyptian onions, and will add more to that <br/>
later, and when goatheads start up, in a month or two, I&#39;ll try to find one to <br/>
follow through its cycle too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983554200">Cool tumbleweed sites, Sandra.  I thought it was funny to see the Prairie Tumblweeds folks have a link on their site to translate to Japanese.  As we&#39;ve always joked (dh is Japanese-American) those Japanese folks will buy anything!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
