&gt; &gt; Here&#39;s two pieces that add to the puzzle of why some magic is<br/>
&gt; considered<br/>
&gt; &gt; acceptable and some isn&#39;t. I hadn&#39;t thought about it but in fairy<br/>
&gt; tales the<br/>
&gt; &gt; magic folk are always in a supportive role to the humans who<br/>
&gt; are the central<br/>
&gt; &gt; figures. Likewise Christians are encouraged to rely on the<br/>
&gt; power of God but<br/>
&gt; &gt; not wield the powers for themselves. But in HP the wizards and<br/>
&gt; witches are<br/>
&gt; &gt; enhanced by magic and consider themselves better than<br/>
&gt; humans/Christians (who<br/>
&gt; &gt; obviously won&#39;t use magic.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s an interesting twist. I wonder why the power wielded by<br/>
&gt; Gandalf is considered okay to use. LOTR seems to me more<br/>
&gt; like Star Wars: that there is power out there and it depends on<br/>
&gt; who is using it whether it&#39;s for good or evil. Frodo (not a human<br/>
&gt; but a hobbit) wouldn&#39;t use the corrupting power for his own gain,<br/>
&gt; but he relied heavily on Gandalf&#39;s magical abilities to protect and<br/>
&gt; direct him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Somehow this still feels like a not true parallel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, in HP, the interesting thing about the magic is that it has to<br/>
&gt; be learned. The nature of the magic is impacted by the character<br/>
&gt; of the user. To me, this was a picture of spiritual life. All of us<br/>
&gt; have the same stuff available for liviing, but we make choices<br/>
&gt; about how we&#39;ll live. Magic wasn&#39;t limited to only one good or bad<br/>
&gt; side, but was available to all who were from that realm.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d heard bits and pieces of Christ&#39;s time in the desert and the<br/>
&gt; temptation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He describes it here as Christ turning down the chance to use<br/>
&gt; magic to<br/>
&gt; &gt; convert people. (I can&#39;t quite get that out of the passage or<br/>
&gt; maybe I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; &gt; reading the right one, but anyway Christ does turn down the<br/>
&gt; chance to feed<br/>
&gt; &gt; himself with magic.) Frodo recognizes the corrupting power of<br/>
&gt; magic and is<br/>
&gt; &gt; on a quest to get rid of it. Harry obviously embraces magic to<br/>
&gt; do good,<br/>
&gt; &gt; something that apparently Christ recognized he shouldn&#39;t do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, but Christ does the &quot;deep magic&quot; (as Lewis would say) and<br/>
&gt; rises from the dead. He uses his powers for good by healing<br/>
&gt; people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The difference here is that in HP, Harry chooses over and over<br/>
&gt; again to offer himself, not to just use magic. He is using his<br/>
&gt; powers for ultimate, righteous good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In that way, I&#39;d say that Christ is similar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the food for thought.<br/>

&gt; It wasn&#39;t that pogs were evil...it was the waste of time and money<br/>
&gt; that was evil, you see. ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for the fairy tale thing...I remember when Dobson (a BIG leader in<br/>
&gt; evangelicaldom today) came out with some diatribe against<br/>
&gt; Disney, &quot;where are the moms?&quot; and cited many of Disney&#39;s cartoons,<br/>
&gt; where the mother is absent from the story. tsk. tsk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; HELLO? Western fairy tales are ABOUT the Bad Things That Happen when<br/>
&gt; Mom Isn&#39;t in the Picture. Duh. Snow White, in the original story,<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have a Mom. Cinderella&#39;s Mom was missing, too. Name a<br/>
&gt; traditional fairy tale, and most likely, Mom will be gone, to be<br/>
&gt; replaced by a Wicked Stepmother or No Mother At All. When Disney<br/>
&gt; portrayed a fairy tale on screen, he was just taking the stories that<br/>
&gt; enculturated generation upon generation of European Children, and<br/>
&gt; telling them to us in his style.  He didn&#39;t eliminate the mothers;<br/>
&gt; the stories had no mothers to BEGIN with! ugh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But there has also been a drive, in the past, to take out the &quot;bad<br/>
&gt; stuff&quot; in the stories. In Red Riding Hood, the original story had the<br/>
&gt; Grandma DEAD after the wolf was killed. There are some gruesome<br/>
&gt; details in the stories people have told their children over the ages,<br/>
&gt; but some &quot;expert&quot; (a certified educator, no doubt) got it in his or<br/>
&gt; her head, that these images were too much for little kids, and many<br/>
&gt; stories now eliminate the icky stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FAIRY TALES, FOLKS! As in, tales from the Land of Faery? As in Make<br/>
&gt; Believe?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *stepping down from soap box*<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; p.s. Sheila, I like what you have to say about the Church becoming<br/>
&gt; institutionalized. Veddy good.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Pogs were evil?  Really?  I managed to not hear about that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I agree with you about the fairy tales.  No one seems to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; problem with the Fairy God Mother, with her bibbity-bobbidy-boo<br/>
&gt; &gt; spells or the witch brewing up a concoction to put a spell on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sleeping Beauty.  But Harry Potter is evil.  There are even books<br/>
&gt; &gt; written about it, like Harry Potter and the Bible.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the connection to the church as an institution, is that<br/>
&gt; once<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christians traded their community based-lifestyles for<br/>
&gt; &gt; Constantine&#39;s &quot;Christian temples&quot;, modeled after the pagan ones<br/>
&gt; &gt; (complete with pagan-style choirs and three point messages), they<br/>
&gt; &gt; also gave up thinking for themselves to a large degree.  There is<br/>
&gt; &gt; this huge clergy-laity distinction, and all it takes is for a<br/>
&gt; couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; of &quot;pastors&quot; to preach from the pulpit and write a few books about<br/>
&gt; &gt; how evil something is, and most of the Christian world believes it<br/>
&gt; &gt; automatically.<br/>

&gt; &gt; hates schools.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been reading, reading and reading. Sandra, your site is great.<br/>
&gt; You and some of the others here are inspiring to a new one like me.<br/>
&gt; I have my monthly meeting with our &quot;ES&quot; on Thursday and OH am I<br/>
&gt; dreading it!  I am leaning to declaring my freedom on that day and<br/>
&gt; jump out of the California charter circus. Thanks to all. I am glad<br/>
&gt; to be a part of an encouraging and informative group. Sara<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, I have to throw my two cents in on this one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have come from a church that is firm in its need for everyone to be<br/>
&gt; indoctrinated, you should know that there are other sorts of churches in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; world.  There are churches where the sermon is designed to make you think,<br/>
&gt; to challenge you to see God in a different way.  There are churches that<br/>
&gt; worship in three completely different ways on Sundays, but still are held<br/>
&gt; together by a common foundation of faith.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t agree with everyone who worships at my church.  I have been a part<br/>
&gt; of 9 churches in my 10 years of marriage (military...we move a lot!).<br/>
While<br/>
&gt; my beliefs aren&#39;t a perfect match for perhaps any church, I&#39;ve had clergy<br/>
&gt; who encourage me to read, study, think, pray, and consider why I believe<br/>
&gt; what I do believe, so I can grow personally.  Much like I do as an<br/>
&gt; unschooler.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s what you miss when you don&#39;t go to church: community.  I regularly<br/>
&gt; hear from people on this list that they&#39;re so glad to find this group,<br/>
&gt; because they don&#39;t know any other unschoolers.  So I know that community<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; important to us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Community isn&#39;t necessary, plenty of folks believe and are comfortable<br/>
being<br/>
&gt; alone in their faith.  But community does provide you with much support.<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t give up on churches entirely because you haven&#39;t found one that<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t ask you to check your brain at the door.  They&#39;re out there.<br/>
&gt; Really.<br/>

&gt; 1/21/03 04:37:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I never liked the group<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking mentality of church, or any other corporate entity for that<br/>
&gt; &gt; matter. I get so tired of hearing &quot;we believe&quot; and &quot;we think&quot; that I<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to scream &quot;NO! WHAT DO *YOU* BELIEVE! WHAT DO *YOU* THINK!&quot; Anytime<br/>
&gt; &gt; an entire group of people *think* the same thing, there is no thinking<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt; all, imo. I have come to the belief that a vast majority of people like<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be indoctrinated. It releases them of all responsibility and reason.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If everyone at a church believed God could only be worshipped in one<br/>
way,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would doubt the motives of the church.  If everyone on a list thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; that there was only one way of unschooling, I would seriously have<br/>
doubts<br/>
&gt; &gt; about the integrity of the list. Even though we sometimes disagree, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; value the free-thinking-ness of this list. Unfortunately, I have yet to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a church<br/>
&gt; &gt; that offers the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Subject: kids and candy. update<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good morning, I met to post yesterday but Avery got really sick and<br/>
&gt; getting on the computer was not an option.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, so for the past 2 days food in are house has been done a little<br/>
&gt; different, I loved the idea of the monkey platters and we made up a<br/>
&gt; couple, with different goodies on both, Jaiden and Avery loved them,<br/>
&gt; and I have been asked if we can have them every day, they eat stuff I<br/>
&gt; had no idea that they would eat. It was very cool. So on sunday I<br/>
&gt; decided that no matter what my kids ate or drank I wasn&#39;t going to<br/>
&gt; expect that &quot;hyper behavior&quot; I wasn&#39;t going to put all the negitive<br/>
&gt; junk my parents had put on to to me, back on to them. And damn if<br/>
&gt; there was no difference in their behavoir, until a friend of ours and<br/>
&gt; his 3 girls showed up to play, total excitement, we hadn&#39;t seen them<br/>
&gt; since before x-mas so they were all very excited, so it was not the<br/>
&gt; candy, it was the situation, major shift in thinking for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do have to say that both of them have been making amazing food<br/>
&gt; choices the last few days, I never would have thought that Avery<br/>
&gt; would not eat the candy in favor of the cheeese, although Jaiden<br/>
&gt; showed him how to wrap m&ms up in cheese, &lt;shudder&gt; but they both<br/>
&gt; seem to like it, and thats what matters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, thank you all so much for your sharing your thoughts and time<br/>
&gt; with me. And thank you all for holding my hand as I struggle with<br/>
&gt; overcoming my past and thank you for jioning me on my journey to<br/>
&gt; become not just an unschooler, but a better parent.<br/>
&gt; Thank You.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi all:<br/>
&gt; I need some perspectives, please! My 13yod, after being unschooled her<br/>
whole<br/>
&gt; life, decided to try middle school last year.  She started in October,<br/>
&gt; stayed 5 days, said &quot;It&#39;s interfering with my life...&quot; and stopped. One<br/>
girl<br/>
&gt; that she met there has called sometimes.  Jayme and her got together to go<br/>
&gt; shopping yesterday. Now, Jme wants to try middle school again, in March,<br/>
&gt; after she goes down to visits friends in February, flying back and forth<br/>
&gt; unaccompanied! Help! There has been so much change this year-we moved 1000<br/>
&gt; miles in April, she&#39;s in dance, 4h, the yearbook committee, 2 youth in<br/>
&gt; philanthropy projects, and she baby-sits and works for an elderly<br/>
neighbor.<br/>
&gt; I think she has a cool life with out adding #@$%&*! school to it.<br/>
&gt; I also think my comfort level has to have something to do with the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well Robyn, I can&#39;t offer any help but I&#39;m curious what some others would<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; or has done as well. I use to think that I would never let my kids go to<br/>
&gt; school, but after being on the list, I&#39;ve changed my mind. Thinking that<br/>
if<br/>
&gt; they really wanted to bad enough and were aware of what it entailed, I<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; let them try. Now you have brought up another good point. How many times<br/>
&gt; should they keep trying? I know the back and forth would be a lot for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tara has a friend from grade school yet that really wants to attend the<br/>
&gt; private school Tara does. She does sometimes but when her parents run out<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; money, she attends the local high school. She goes to public school for a<br/>
&gt; couple of weeks and then back at the private school for a couple of weeks.<br/>
&gt; This has been going on for 2 years. I honestly don&#39;t know how she does it.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Consideration<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wqas just wondering about something that has been on my mind lately. I<br/>
&gt; would say our parenting hasn&#39;t changed much lately, except for possibly<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; words I use with the children. My husband Joe is still a bit more strict<br/>
&gt; than I would like but he&#39;s trying and listens to all my suggestions on<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; to do and not to do with the kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now for the question. Is there a general age when you have noticed that<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; children become more aware of others and start to not be so selfish?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;m thinking of it more or the kids are more into<br/>
&gt; themselves lately, but they seem so into themselves recently they don&#39;t<br/>
stop<br/>
&gt; to think about others. I hear their words when there is a conflict, that<br/>
&gt; they talk it out and think of how the other would feel. What I don&#39;t see<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; the action behind it on a daily basis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just as an example, this morning my 2 middle kids got up very early, (for<br/>
&gt; this house) it was obvious everyone else was asleep. They proceded to play<br/>
&gt; in the playroom at a noise level that would wake the dead. I mentioned it<br/>
&gt; once and not 3 minutes later, it was just as loud as before. That&#39;s the<br/>
kind<br/>
&gt; of stuff I am thinking that maybe they would see by now. I&#39;m not looking<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; a magical age, I know they are kids, but I just kind of worry now that<br/>
maybe<br/>
&gt; they won&#39;t get it.<br/>

&gt; This must be a symptom of the age.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My daughter went to 5th grade for a few days and came home.  Then she did<br/>
cyberschool.  Then she quit bec. she wanted to homeschool.  Now she wants to<br/>
go back to school.  I am making her wait until the beginning of next year<br/>
because the honest truth is she really does not know what she wants to do<br/>
(yet).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the meantime, I am talking with her about her friends&#39; idea of fun<br/>
being different than hers because they have so much less freedom to start<br/>
with.<br/>

&gt; Subject: fashion ideas again<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I came up with an idea that might work for both me and my daughter without<br/>
all the &quot;learning to sew&quot; stuff.  4H doesn&#39;t start again till next year I<br/>
don&#39;t think anyway.  And I have ZERO sewing ability LOL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are going to go the mall and really take a look at whats &quot;in style&quot;.<br/>
(And watch the style channel, etc to get ideas for the &quot;cutting edge&quot;<br/>
styles).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THEN...we can go to thrift stores and find similar looking clothes, with<br/>
similar material and modify them in simple ways to make them fit the current<br/>
trends or to set new trends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THEN maybe we can sell them at consignment shops.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What do y&#39;all think?<br/>

&gt; Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better<br/>

&gt;<br/>

it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: Can&#39;t seem to make up her mind...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I need some perspectives, please! My 13yod, after being unschooled her<br/>
&gt; whole<br/>
&gt; &gt; life, decided to try middle school last year.  She started in October,<br/>
&gt; &gt; stayed 5 days, said &quot;It&#39;s interfering with my life...&quot; and stopped. One<br/>
&gt; girl<br/>
&gt; &gt; that she met there has called sometimes.  Jayme and her got together to<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; &gt; shopping yesterday. Now, Jme wants to try middle school again, in March,<br/>
&gt; &gt; after she goes down to visits friends in February, flying back and forth<br/>
&gt; &gt; unaccompanied! Help! There has been so much change this year-we moved<br/>
1000<br/>
&gt; &gt; miles in April, she&#39;s in dance, 4h, the yearbook committee, 2 youth in<br/>
&gt; &gt; philanthropy projects, and she baby-sits and works for an elderly<br/>
&gt; neighbor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think she has a cool life with out adding #@$%&*! school to it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I also think my comfort level has to have something to do with the<br/>
&gt; equation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s hear what ya&#39;ll think...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lets see.  She stayed 5 days the last time.  My guess is that she&#39;ll stay<br/>
&gt; even fewer days this time.  Like she said.  It interfered with her life.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s probably just forgotten *how much* it interfered last time.  I&#39;d let<br/>
&gt; her do it and hope that she gets at least one of the kind of teacher my<br/>
&gt; granddaughter got when she tried school for a week.  That teacher was<br/>
&gt; perfect for our purposes (convincing her that school wasn&#39;t for her).<br/>

&gt; I grew up in an orchard.  (Well we had a house, but it was surrounded by<br/>
&gt; apple trees &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
&gt; When the apples are still &quot;too green,&quot; they&#39;re good if you salt them.)<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  I would hope that this list is one where people from many different<br/>
&gt; religous philosophies can come together because we are all parents and we<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; searching for loving pathways to walk with our children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is, but nearly every new Christian member who comes here tries to tell<br/>
us<br/>
&gt; that anything we know about conservative &quot;Christian Homeschoolers&quot; (their<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; term for their own subculture) is negated by their (the the new member&#39;s)<br/>
&gt; being a Christian and not being one of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s particularly irritating when the new homeschooler-who-is-Christian<br/>
&gt; honestly has NO IDEA that there is a huge Christian Homeschooling<br/>
movement,<br/>
&gt; has no idea that HSLDA is politically motivated and seems miffed that we<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; things they don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s on beyond irritating when someone says &quot;If you&#39;re not Christian, you<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t say anything about Christianity because you don&#39;t know what<br/>
you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; talking about.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So I don&#39;t mind if the list is heavily Christian,  but it&#39;s a waste of<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; to try to tell us that what we know isn&#39;t so (about the motivations and<br/>
&gt; practices of hundreds of thousands of conservative Christian<br/>
homeschoolers).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And if too many unschooling principles are countered by &quot;the Bible<br/>
says...&quot;<br/>
&gt; it will become a drag.<br/>
&gt; There are people here who can counter just about any Bible citation with a<br/>
&gt; counter-citation, but that&#39;s not why this list exists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And if people come here and make the automatic assumption that we&#39;re all<br/>
&gt; pro-life Republican conservatives just because we&#39;re homeschoolers, that<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; be disruptive too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s nothing in the list above that hasn&#39;t happened more than once on<br/>
&gt; unschooling lists or bulletin boards in the past ten years.  Some have<br/>
&gt; happened more than ten times that I personally know of.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; That&#39;s an interesting twist. I wonder why the power wielded by<br/>
&gt; Gandalf is considered okay to use. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gandalf is an immortal, like an angel, basically.<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t get that unless you read all the background material and<br/>
&gt; Simarillion (which I can&#39;t read, but friends tell me what they read &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Yes, but Christ does the &quot;deep magic&quot; (as Lewis would say) and<br/>
&gt; rises from the dead. He uses his powers for good by healing<br/>
&gt; people.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But people can say God-the-father raised him from the dead, and so still<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; was passive magic.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; How can anyone read through the HSLDA website and think that they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; anything BUT a politically motivated organization?  As soon as my dh and I<br/>
&gt; read a few pages, we knew that we didn&#39;t want any part of HSLDA because of<br/>
&gt; the obvious political adgenda and also because of the scare tactics they<br/>
use<br/>
&gt; to try to recruit new members.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;&quot;If you&#39;re not Christian, you shouldn&#39;t say anything about Christianity<br/>
&gt; because you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; talking about.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s just silly, but reminds me of the people who tell me I have no<br/>
&gt; business educating my children because I don&#39;t have a degree in elementary<br/>
&gt; education.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;So I don&#39;t mind if the list is heavily Christian,  but it&#39;s a waste of<br/>

&gt; I wouldn&#39;t even try.  These are the people who shun and condemn me for<br/>
&gt; Unschooling in the first place.<br/>

&gt; They believe it by NOT reading it.<br/>
