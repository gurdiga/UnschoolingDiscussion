<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319547672">From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;ve also referred to many babies, my own<br/>
&gt;included as &quot;grubs&quot; or &quot;the larva stage&quot; meaning they weren&#39;t yet doing<br/>
&gt;anything impressive or coordinated but someday they would.  I&#39;ve never said<br/>
&gt;&quot;that is a grub&quot; and walked away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, this reminds me of something my former boss said. His wife was Japanese<br/>
and he spent several years there. He said in Japan that most people refer to<br/>
newborns as looking like monkeys, and that when the baby passes out of that<br/>
stage it is considered a compliment to say something like &quot;Your baby doesn&#39;t<br/>
look like a monkey anymore&quot;. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not getting the translation just<br/>
right, but it was something like that.<br/>
