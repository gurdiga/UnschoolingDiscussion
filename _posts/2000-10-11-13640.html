<div id="ygrps-yiv-751801681">So I&#39;m assuming everyone&#39;s just so busy having lives that they <br/>
don&#39;t need the support or don&#39;t have the time for the list right now...  <br/>
LOL   <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d remind everyone that we still have a list andthat <br/>
we&#39;re here if we need us...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and by the way can I rant about the fact that it&#39;s very hard for <br/>
me to live where I do because I don&#39;t think there is anyone on the <br/>
estate who has more than two things in common with me, and one <br/>
of those is being a female human, the other being having children?  <br/>
Figured it out the other day, there is no-one who is challenging the <br/>
status-quo in dealing with their children respectfully as individuals, <br/>
no-one who would even think of extended nursing (if they started <br/>
breastfeeding in the first place) maybe one or two who would be <br/>
into growing their own organic veggies...  absolutely no <br/>
unschoolers!  What can I say, except Beam me up, Mr O&#39;Brien!<br/>

Hey Tracy, you must live with or near my family : )  Are you on any other AP <br/>
list to get support?  When one is quiet I usually get support from the other. <br/>
 Let me know if you need the addresses.  I will pass them on.....Hang in <br/>
there!  I am sure that your family is doing great and learning tons about <br/>
different lifestyle choices people make (not matter how unkind those choices <br/>
are too children.  Sorry, I just had to throw that in there and was totally <br/>
uncalled for).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981368126">Did anyone see that new series that came on after Titus and before the Geena<br/>
Davis thing?  All I could think of was letter writing time!  For those that<br/>
didn&#39;t, it was all about extended nursing with cracks about doing so the<br/>
boobs would stay big and mean thinking about sex when seeing it.  Yuck!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195362746">Hi Tracy;<br/>
<br/>
Just letting you know, as you are already aware, that YOU ARE NOT<br/>
ALONE!  We used to live in rural Alberta, in &quot;Canada&#39;s Wild West&quot;, and I<br/>
felt exactly as you do. I was one strange bird who had NOT-A-THING in<br/>
common with any one around me.  How terribly isolating and<br/>
DEPRESSING!!!  If it doesn&#39;t drive you positively mad it certainly<br/>
strengthens your resolve.  I&#39;m sooooo grateful I survived it and have<br/>
since found a few supporters.  They&#39;re my lifeline!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there, we&#39;re only separated by a few clicks of the keys...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-847964230">I have been out of town for the last week and was not able to keep up with <br/>
the boards.  We were in beautiful western Maryland for the Autumn Glory <br/>
Festival.  I have relatives there and go every chance I get.  The trees were <br/>
absolutely gorgeous.  <br/>
<br/>
I did happen to catch that new show that talked about extended nursing and <br/>
the boob thing.  I watched the whole thing is complete disbelief and just <br/>
wanted to scream at the mother, your baby is CRYING go pick him up and nurse <br/>
him!!.  I think the kid was barely a year old.  What was really sad is the <br/>
message it sent to a lot of woman who probably want to nurse longer but feel <br/>
that it isn&#39;t &quot;right&quot; according to society and so decide to stop.  Yes, you <br/>
are right - letter writing time!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834748330">They couldn&#39;t have used me for any show on negatives of extended nursing.<br/>
My first two weaned themselves by age 2 this latest is still nursing to take<br/>
naps or before going to bed at 2 3/4.  My daughter now 7 says he just does<br/>
it to have time with me without the other two getting my attention (pretty<br/>
smart of her & him).  Now if he&#39;s in his car seat he&#39;ll take a sippy cup but<br/>
never would take a bottle.  Yes I get some looks &quot;isn&#39;t he beyond that yet?&quot;<br/>
even from my mother-in-law.  But we&#39;ll keep it going till he&#39;s ready.</div>
