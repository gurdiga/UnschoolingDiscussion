  We joined for two reasons. One for the support provided for true unschooling. It is an almost unheard of concept and two for the money. They get money from the government and they give it back to us.The program toally allows us to unschool.No extra pressures, meetings with teachers etc..We have only just joined three weeeks ago as we were on the waiting list. I signed up with the interest in having some credibility to my unschooling. A program like this would relax other peoples worries some (family). However this was before I jpoined on this list. Since then I have truly become more sure of my life and not needing justification for it. The support has been trmendous. Child led learning is truly encouraged and understood. My first experience with that at a beurocratic level. Our support person calls and chats with Brianna with tremendous respect and regard.There are numerous spots on the site to talk with others and participate in other activities.Brianna has not been interested and that so far has been okay.<br/>

<br/>
Jaiden rarely has anything good to say, it&#39;s almost always a complaint about something. It seems like nothing is good enough for him. I try to be understanding, and let him complain and share what he is feeling. But after months of nothing but negitivity I&#39;m feeling very over whelmed. (i can give examples if needed). I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m handleing it wrong, if I need another approach. I just don&#39;t know. It&#39;s starting to really affect Jason(dh), as most of his complaints are about things we can&#39;t do anything about. If it&#39;s somthing we can fix/do something about we do, but it&#39;s gotten to where the things he&#39;s complaining about are things out of our control, things we can&#39;t change. Any ideas would be great. <br/>

  wrong.. <br/>
<br/>
  I wonder if trying to satisfy them becomes more of a problem. Maybe it takes away their power. I have an 11 year old son who has just been diagnosed with low thyroid. He has been real negative since about two. I have found that it is best to just let him have his feelings. I really don&#39;t have to fix anything unless he specifically asks for help and then I will work with him to find a solution. He still complains a lot and we have wondered about depression as it is big in extended family. At this time we are trying to find a good homeopathic remedy and working on helping him to turn some of his language more positive. Gently and kindly pointing it out has been helpful but I have had to be careful to be nonshaming and nonjudgemental so I usually wait until I am not so frustrated. Another thing to consider is to maybe see why it pushes buttons or disturbs you so much. For me it was because I judged myself as being a less than adequate parent. Since I have rethought that I am able to let him own it and I am able to objectively explore the situation and see if he needs some more emotional support somewhere in his life. And this is not always needed from me.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I am trying to validate all of his complaints, after about 6 hrs, of it I tend to get a bit snippy with him. <br/>
<br/>
Lately his complaints have been for a pool. He say a picture of himself in one when he was 2(he&#39;s almost 5 now) and is really mad and upset that we don&#39;t still have that pool - it wasn&#39;t our pool, it was a friend of my mom&#39;s pool and they are no longer friends.- I&#39;ve told him that I&#39;m really sorry that I can&#39;t take him to that pool, and I know that it sucks that we don&#39;t have a pool (we live in an apt complex) and I will try my hardest to find a pool that he can use as soon as it warms up enough to swim, and if he wants we&#39;ll talk to the landlord and see if we can put a little pool up in the courtyard. This will calm him down for a while, mabey an hour, then it starts back up only now he adds in that we don&#39;t have the sm. pool and why can&#39;t I make it warm up enough....on and on... by the end of the day he&#39;s still going on about the pool, all through playing at the park, or going on a bug hunt, or any other things we&#39;ve done. He&#39;ll start up the next day and keep going until he&#39;s found something new to complain about and it starts all over. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do, I may not be able to do anything, I&#39;m just frusterated by it all.<br/>

I think that this is a lot of it for both Jason and me. Jaidens complaining started about a year and a half ago. At that time we were planningg to move cross country, to MI, my dad and step mom were going to buy us a house and a car, they were going to pay for the best private schools, Jason was going to go into a high paying field, life was going to be grand. But...Jason didn&#39;t want to move, was willing to do it because it was what I wanted, he was injured on the job and couldn&#39;t do the physical aspect of the job in MI, we decided to homeschool, then unschool, We stayed in San Diego, in our apartment, and we have had to deal with no money - workmans comp. dosen&#39;t pay much.<br/>
<br/>
So all in all, I think his complaining for things that we can&#39;t do does make us both feel like failures. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t want to do things for him and with him, but right now we cant. <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on how to change our mindset?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391083526"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yes, I am trying to validate all of his complaints, after about 6 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hrs, of it I tend to get a bit snippy with him. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am a proud mommy of a hyperactive 4 year old who has a tendancy to <br/>
go on a verbal whiney rampage at least daily regarding something I <br/>
usually cannot change to his satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned to give myself a mental vacation during these times. I <br/>
have learned to block out the unimportant complaining. Then when a <br/>
legitimate complaint comes forth like &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; I am all ears <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
It takes practice, but if you could live thru the discomfort of <br/>
bearing this child into the world, you can train yourself to have <br/>
selective hearing.  Men have this inherantly. The last time I told my <br/>
husband to pick up his socks, he used this selective hearing and the <br/>
socks remained there. If I were to tell him someone was choking on a <br/>
lego, then he&#39;d be there so quick! Thus the glories of selective <br/>
hearing.  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t work all the time.  The husband still can&#39;t use his to <br/>
block out the loudness of the kids at play when he&#39;s trying to <br/>
concentrate on something.  I usually choose not to take that time to <br/>
do anything and let the kids have their fun.  But still...<br/>
<br/>
The whining is not playtime noise.  It is meant to get mom&#39;s <br/>
attention.  It is like a siren.  A bell.  A signal that something is <br/>
not right.  <br/>
<br/>
Babies cry, little kids whine, older kids complain and adults vent. <br/>
Ah, the glories of communication.  We are human and we are never <br/>
fully satisfied with things.  That&#39;s why we are capable of adaptation <br/>
and changing. <br/>
<br/>
Little kids don&#39;t have the aptitude yet to understand the world <br/>
around them fully; what they can change and what they cannot and how <br/>
to adapt to any of it. So they whine.<br/>
<br/>
Moms are a bit different.  We can understand the difference between <br/>
these things and we are pros at adaptation.  We also understand when <br/>
a child is just whiney or when it is a serious need requiring our <br/>
attentiveness.<br/>
<br/>
You CAN selectively tune out the whining. You can also note to your <br/>
child that you are going to ignore until the complaining stops and <br/>
explain that you cannot change what cannot be changed (kids believe <br/>
moms are superhuman sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
I would also look into diet, general stresses, television <br/>
programming, sleep disturbances, and playtime situations to see if <br/>
there isn&#39;t an underlying stress that is causing your child to be <br/>
overly sensitive. This goes back to the part where mommies can change <br/>
some things. :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  And remember that raising a child is like growing a <br/>
flower garden.  The more effort you put into it, the more beautiful <br/>
and wonderful it will be.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157423470">Brianna & I have little money. We operate very close to the bone. very, very close. Brianna has had to understand that money is earned and that how we spend our money depends on what we Need to have; I.e. rent, heat, electricity, phone, food, etc.<br/>
<br/>
part of what our kids ask us for  comes from living in a very consumerist society.<br/>
Your sons reality is that he lives in an apt. in San Diego and he does not have a pool.<br/>
All the complaining in the world isn&#39;t going to get him a pool.<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of not doing the unschooling thing, I have to say, I would try and change his mindset.<br/>
<br/>
As for your mindset - well,  how will you feel if/when he wants to go to Astronaut camp? Or when he says that Disney Land isn&#39;t good enough - he wants to go to Disney World.<br/>
Or when he wants a horse?<br/>
Or whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
You are not failing - unless you let him think that he should have whatever he wants when he wants it.<br/>
That does him no favor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217952770">My husband and I have found that accepting what we can&#39;t control really<br/>
brings a feeling of peace into our lives.  For us, the fact that my<br/>
fibromyalgia had me in bed for a couple of years made us think about<br/>
what would REALLY make life unbearable.  We always look for the positive<br/>
in whatever situation we are in.  For example, he got laid off last<br/>
April.  Everyone around us is surprised at how we&#39;ve reacted.  We&#39;re<br/>
enjoying the extra time we have together.  How many kids (or wives) get<br/>
to spend a year with dad?  We&#39;re not worried, we&#39;re happy.  Life&#39;s full<br/>
of ups and downs, and we don&#39;t see any reason not to try to enjoy the<br/>
downs as much as we can.  A sense of humor gets us through the toughest<br/>
times, and everything seems to work out in the end.  We focus on what we<br/>
CAN do rather than on what we can&#39;t, and we focus on each other and how<br/>
truly lucky we are to have a happy, peaceful family.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will help you to change your mindsets, but I can<br/>
tell you that it&#39;s worth doing.  I&#39;d imagine your attitude would rub off<br/>
on your son as well.  It&#39;s certainly rubbed off on our kids, whose<br/>
bedtime ritual includes us saying, &quot;Everything&#39;s gonna be...&quot; and them<br/>
responding, &quot;all right&quot;.  Dagny, who&#39;s ten, told me last week that her<br/>
favorite line from a song is, &quot;It&#39;s not having what you want, it&#39;s<br/>
wanting what you&#39;ve got.&quot;  (Sheryl Crow)  I wish I had figured that out<br/>
at ten :0).  ~Rue<br/>

So all in all, I think his complaining for things that we can&#39;t do does<br/>
make us both feel like failures. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t want to do<br/>
things for him and with him, but right now we cant. <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on how to change our mindset?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010344281">&lt;&lt; At the risk of not doing the unschooling thing, I have to say, I would try <br/>
and change his mindset. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see that it&#39;s at all unschooling to discuss philosophy and reality <br/>
with a child, including the reality of perpetual unhappiness.   <br/>
<br/>
Being unhappy, wallowing in unhappiness, expressing unhappiness, can be a <br/>
much more serious problem for a person than biting nails or overeating or <br/>
being late or not picking up laundry.<br/>
<br/>
The advice to tune out whining sounded very bad to me.  It sounded it like <br/>
ignoring a baby&#39;s crying.  Convincing kids not to whine, or to change the <br/>
tone or content of the communication is the best answer I can imagine.  <br/>
Ignoring them or thinking there is virtue in not advising them about their <br/>
mindset seem like bad ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when one of mine whines about the day, I ask if there&#39;s anything <br/>
they want me to do.  Sometimes there is.  Often there isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was angry yesterday about an incident last Sunday.  I talked him <br/>
through what they did do, what they could have done, what the other kids <br/>
might have been thinking.  I told him that had he gone to school, he would be <br/>
used to this by now, but he had the odd privilege of being fourteen before <br/>
any stranger-kids took his ball away and wouldn&#39;t return it.  He NEEDED to <br/>
talk about it.  I couldn&#39;t do anything about the other kids or their <br/>
behavior, but I could (and needed to) advise Marty on what would be good and <br/>
bad to do if it happened again.  And I could advise compassion.  <br/>
<br/>
Ignoring my own child, if he or she wants to communicate with me, is as bad <br/>
as taking someone&#39;s ball away and not giving it back.  It adds to <br/>
frustration.  It makes them feel unheard and alone.  <br/>

  I guess the one thing I can hear is all the guilt. I really believe that we all have different circumstances that we must live with and that we end up being stronger people by dropping the guilt and accepting it. Not that it is easy mind you. Maybe you can focus more on what you can do within your physical and monetary constraints. Maybe you have someone who can carry some of the load once in a while and provide him with &quot;special&quot; times.<br/>
  Realizing that it probably won&#39;t always be like this and that what you can&#39;t give him in material or other ways maybe you can make up with lots of quality one on one reading ,walking, watching movies, playing games. Just some ideas. Don.t know if it is helpful or not.<br/>

Perhaps it&#39;s the force of my personality or the experience of my friends and <br/>
relatives that if they get into it with me they will probably soon be out of <br/>
their depth.  <br/>
<br/>
I hear &quot;Aren&#39;t you worried that...&quot;<br/>
and they hear &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And later I hear &quot;You were right&quot; or (yesterday) &quot;You did too good a job!&quot;<br/>
(That was about me complaining that while I do NOT want to go to a big SCA <br/>
campout on Memorial Day, that my kids really want to.  &quot;What happened to kids <br/>
not wanting to be part of their parents&#39; hobbies!?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m an exception.  Even my mother in law who strikes fear <br/>
into the hearts of co-workers (before she retired) and bridge partners <br/>
(still) and fellow church members (still) is reduced to chuckles and <br/>
single-shot snarky comments I ignore and that the kids laugh about on the way <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
I think an arsenal of comments which require the other person to show THEIR <br/>
proofs or reasons helps.  People expect to get away with vague defenses of <br/>
the traditional ways, of the status quo.  I stick them uncomfortably and they <br/>
at least hush, and at most, go do some research that proves me right even <br/>
after I&#39;m not standing there to bask in it.<br/>

  My experience has been that when people spend time in a relationship with my kids they see the quality of who they are. My mom never used tosee my kids much and was my biggest doubter also she was quiet about it. As the kids have gotten older and I feel they now have the skills to handle some of her less respectful ways they see her more and with this is a grandma who is going wow,  your kids have so many great qualities. It helps that she is doing an after school daycare with my brother so she really gets to see the stark difference in respect and inner motivation. There is so much more than academic skills that makes us whole people.<br/>

OOOH!!! I HATE THAT!<br/>
<br/>
And all the things I learned on my own, from National Geographic kids&#39; stuff, <br/>
or the Rocky and Bullwinkle quiz game I ordered from a cereal box (with punch <br/>
cards, and if you stuck the magic pen in the right hole a light bulb lit up) <br/>
and watching PBS and reading at the library, my teachers took credit for all <br/>
that, as though they were great teachers because I could read and spout <br/>
obscure facts and all...<br/>

But let a kid be totally not suited for school, falling through all their <br/>
cracks, and teachers will say &quot;poor kid, crummy homelife.&quot;<br/>

Well if they say your kids won&#39;t socialize, you could ask how many <br/>
homeschoolers they know personally.   The answer is either none or some.  If <br/>
some, ask if any of those are isolated from other families, from public <br/>
places, clubs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just ask them questions in a level voice until it&#39;s apparent to them that <br/>
they don&#39;t really have the back-up information to hold their position.<br/>
<br/>
If their argument comes to &quot;Well I went to school and I learned it&quot; or <br/>
something like that you can just look at them for an uncomfortably long <br/>
number of seconds like you&#39;re waiting for them to make a point, or to hear <br/>
what a dumb thing they&#39;ve said.  <br/>
<br/>
Once they say uncle, you&#39;re free until the next encounter.<br/>
