<div id="ygrps-yiv-952938525">My husband and I are homeschooling our 8 1/2 year old, and, based on <br/>
our child&#39;s many-year obsession with the alphabet, we have been <br/>
working on creating some educational resources. We will eventually <br/>
produce CD-ROMs, but now we are just starting to put up a web site. <br/>
It is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.letterlane.com">http://www.letterlane.com</a> We would really like some input <br/>
from parents about a couple of things. <br/>
First, we are looking for good quality, noncommercial links for each <br/>
letter of the alphabet. Secondly, we want this to be truly <br/>
multicultural and inclusive, so we are open to suggestions for names <br/>
for the characters from E through Z that would reflect the diversity <br/>
within the United States. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396652853">Probably because I wrote the web address at the end of a sentence and <br/>
the period threw things off.  Let me try this again:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.letterlane.com">http://www.letterlane.com</a><br/>
<br/>
That should work.<br/>
