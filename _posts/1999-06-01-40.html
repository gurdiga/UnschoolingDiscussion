wonderful essay wherein she explains how she manages without her times<br/>
tables. It&#39;s called &quot;Happily Unscathed&quot; and can be found at<br/>

Speaking of times tables (or no times tables), has anybody here had any<br/>
experience with Trachenberg math?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1179056603">Sorry for this bother, but can someone direct us to the web site with <br/>
the menomic times tables?  I showed my 10 year old daughter the 8x8=64 <br/>
that was on this site and she got such a kick out of it she wants <br/>
more.  I&#39;ve paged back through the postings, but can&#39;t seem to find <br/>
the one I need.  There&#39;s lots of activity here!                       <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://citycreek.com/">http://citycreek.com/</a><br/>
But that site just sells books.  <br/>
<br/>
The message with the 8 * 8 = 64 thing was 37194 but I don&#39;t have time <br/>
to step through all the messages to make sure that the one post was <br/>
talking about the other right now.<br/>

Hope that helps.<br/>

&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://citycreek.com/">http://citycreek.com/</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The site describes a sytem using stories and visual mnemonics for<br/>
&gt; memorization of &quot;math facts&quot;, comparing results to &quot;traditional repetition<br/>
&gt; and timed tests.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A long time ago I remember someone writing in a discussion on math that she&#39;d<br/>
&gt; always thought of numbers as little characters with personalities, running<br/>
&gt; around doing mysterious things. This system above seems almost custom<br/>
&gt; designed to completely remove &quot;math facts&quot; from any meaningful mathematical<br/>
&gt; context. I can&#39;t help thinking that it even reinforces the idea that math is<br/>
&gt; hard, boring, and makes no sense. Replacing drilling with silly stories<br/>
&gt; starring the numerals as characters (not numbers as an idea) doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
&gt; me to be any improvement if you care about real learning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Somebody tell me to calm down...<br/>
