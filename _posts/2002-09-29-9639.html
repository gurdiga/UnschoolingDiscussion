&gt; &gt; There are kids like I was whose spiritual journeys<br/>
&gt; were NOT at home nearly <br/>
&gt; &gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt; much as they were at church.  Maybe UUs don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; many kids without their <br/>
&gt; &gt; parents, but I knew other kids whose parents were<br/>
&gt; pretty worthless to them <br/>
&gt; &gt; religiously speaking.  So if you count on the<br/>
&gt; family beng the experience <br/>
&gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; every kid, some will lose out.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; (Probably they will find other families or adults<br/>
&gt; to use for that learning <br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose, though.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my experience, we don&#39;t get too many kids without<br/>
&gt; their parents on <br/>
&gt; Saturday morning (Youth Group is different). <br/>
&gt; However, even among UU&#39;s, kids <br/>
&gt; often diverge spiritually from their parents as they<br/>
&gt; grow. UU&#39;s tend to be <br/>
&gt; more okay about that, I think.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In writing this, I wanted to be clear to other<br/>
&gt; Religious Educators that <br/>
&gt; however good their programs might be, we were NOT<br/>
&gt; the primary religious <br/>
&gt; educators of the kids. From an early age, kids ask<br/>
&gt; their parents (or someone <br/>
&gt; else -- I suppose many kids learn about spirituality<br/>
&gt; &quot;on the streets&quot;) <br/>
&gt; questions like &quot;What happens when you die? Is there<br/>
&gt; a God, &quot; etc. (There&#39;s a <br/>
&gt; cool UU Adult RE curriculum called &quot;Parents as<br/>
&gt; Resident Theologians.&quot;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I see what we do in Sunday school as providing<br/>
&gt; community, and giving <br/>
&gt; resources and ideas for exploration...it&#39;s up to the<br/>
&gt; kids to figure out what <br/>
&gt; their next steps are, and we&#39;re always there to<br/>
&gt; help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, they won&#39;t fire me, because the congregation I<br/>
&gt; serve is REALLY into this <br/>
&gt; stuff. When I first started with this church, I told<br/>
&gt; the board that if it <br/>
&gt; came down to it, I&#39;d advocate for what the kids<br/>
&gt; want. They LOVED it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joyce asked me if we unschool RE at my church, and<br/>
&gt; truthfully, we don&#39;t. With <br/>
&gt; volunteer teachers and expectations from both the<br/>
&gt; parents and the kids, I <br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t figured out how to pull that off. However,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried really hard to <br/>
&gt; at least respect what the kids want. I asked last<br/>
&gt; Spring what they wanted to <br/>
&gt; learn this year, and lots said--Science. So my<br/>
&gt; partner and I are writing a <br/>
&gt; curriculum (with lots of choices in it) about<br/>
&gt; Science and Religion.<br/>

&gt; There is hacktivist group called YESMEN that has<br/>
&gt; successfully created <br/>
&gt; a WTO.ORG website that many people around the world<br/>
&gt; believe is the <br/>
&gt; true World Trade Organization&#39;s official site. When<br/>
&gt; I saw this <br/>
&gt; webpage at ANTIWAR.COM, I thought it was another<br/>
&gt; hoax by the YesMen <br/>
&gt; but, lo and behold, it is not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The following is an actual GI JOE play set being<br/>
&gt; sold by JC PENNEY&#39;S, <br/>
&gt; ETOYS (I thought they were dead!) and KBTOYS. It<br/>
&gt; looks like TOYS &#39;R <br/>
&gt; US/AMAZON is not selling it (I checked and there is<br/>
&gt; something with <br/>
&gt; similar wording but no image to identify it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just one word --UNBELIEVABLE!<br/>

&gt; &gt; There are kids like I was whose spiritual journeys<br/>
&gt; were NOT at home nearly <br/>
&gt; &gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt; much as they were at church.  Maybe UUs don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; many kids without their <br/>
&gt; &gt; parents, but I knew other kids whose parents were<br/>
&gt; pretty worthless to them <br/>
&gt; &gt; religiously speaking.  So if you count on the<br/>
&gt; family beng the experience <br/>
&gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; every kid, some will lose out.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; (Probably they will find other families or adults<br/>
&gt; to use for that learning <br/>
&gt; &gt; purpose, though.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my experience, we don&#39;t get too many kids without<br/>
&gt; their parents on <br/>
&gt; Saturday morning (Youth Group is different). <br/>
&gt; However, even among UU&#39;s, kids <br/>
&gt; often diverge spiritually from their parents as they<br/>
&gt; grow. UU&#39;s tend to be <br/>
&gt; more okay about that, I think.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In writing this, I wanted to be clear to other<br/>
&gt; Religious Educators that <br/>
&gt; however good their programs might be, we were NOT<br/>
&gt; the primary religious <br/>
&gt; educators of the kids. From an early age, kids ask<br/>
&gt; their parents (or someone <br/>
&gt; else -- I suppose many kids learn about spirituality<br/>
&gt; &quot;on the streets&quot;) <br/>
&gt; questions like &quot;What happens when you die? Is there<br/>
&gt; a God, &quot; etc. (There&#39;s a <br/>
&gt; cool UU Adult RE curriculum called &quot;Parents as<br/>
&gt; Resident Theologians.&quot;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I see what we do in Sunday school as providing<br/>
&gt; community, and giving <br/>
&gt; resources and ideas for exploration...it&#39;s up to the<br/>
&gt; kids to figure out what <br/>
&gt; their next steps are, and we&#39;re always there to<br/>
&gt; help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, they won&#39;t fire me, because the congregation I<br/>
&gt; serve is REALLY into this <br/>
&gt; stuff. When I first started with this church, I told<br/>
&gt; the board that if it <br/>
&gt; came down to it, I&#39;d advocate for what the kids<br/>
&gt; want. They LOVED it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joyce asked me if we unschool RE at my church, and<br/>
&gt; truthfully, we don&#39;t. With <br/>
&gt; volunteer teachers and expectations from both the<br/>
&gt; parents and the kids, I <br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t figured out how to pull that off. However,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried really hard to <br/>

&gt; Subject: Fwd: [unschoolingfamilies] Gift Idea???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is hacktivist group called YESMEN that has<br/>
&gt; successfully created <br/>
&gt; a WTO.ORG website that many people around the world<br/>
&gt; believe is the <br/>
&gt; true World Trade Organization&#39;s official site. When<br/>
&gt; I saw this <br/>
&gt; webpage at ANTIWAR.COM, I thought it was another<br/>
&gt; hoax by the YesMen <br/>
&gt; but, lo and behold, it is not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The following is an actual GI JOE play set being<br/>
&gt; sold by JC PENNEY&#39;S, <br/>
&gt; ETOYS (I thought they were dead!) and KBTOYS. It<br/>
&gt; looks like TOYS &#39;R <br/>
&gt; US/AMAZON is not selling it (I checked and there is<br/>
&gt; something with <br/>
&gt; similar wording but no image to identify it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just one word --UNBELIEVABLE!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756450147">&lt;&lt;  My 16 year old son started<br/>
studying China which led to the marital arts which led<br/>
to the study of Buddha.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Buddha was NOT a good father or husband.<br/>
<br/>
OH.  Wait.  Probably &quot;martial&quot; arts, not &quot;marital arts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(Just playing; some typos are fun.)<br/>
