Each stage is such a treasure, and it is often hard to appreciate the treasure when it comes, like all gems, surrouded by all that dirt..and all the work to get it free.   <br/>
<br/>
My 8 spent most of the day away...left last night to a friends and spent the night.  MADE IT THROUGH.  No phone calls, no homesickness.  I woke up and realized she is in the next stage of attachment, and I feel a bit sad and proud at the same time.  <br/>
<br/>
It is so odd watching them grow, and take their place among the world, and wondering if I did it right, what I did wrong, and how I may never really know...<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

  I was just thinking these kinds of thoughts! It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s been that long when I was the mom of young kids looking up to  families that had teens and thinking &#39;wow, they&#39;re so together and have such great kids&#39;, sheesh, I blink a couple of times and now families with young kids are looking at me that way!!!  I can have a complete conversation with dh, I can read chapters at a time in a book without being interrupted, nobody needs help getting dressed or making lunch,  I hardly ever get woken at night (though the girls had a friend stay over last night I had woke up to giggles a few times).  They really don&#39;t stay little long do they?!  But what fun they are as big kids!!<br/>

    &lt;&lt; I see Sierra doing things that Joseph did a <br/>
    while ago and doesn&#39;t do anymore. Just being more considerate from I guess a <br/>
    kind of maturity, for lack of a better word. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Hey, that IS the word!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I know those of you with toddlers are hoping for them to GET BIG, but I have <br/>
    big kids, and I would love to have one of them be three for a day or two, or <br/>
    an hour, or a minute.<br/>
<br/>
    And now I cried.    They&#39;re all not even in the house right now.  Kirby&#39;s at <br/>
    work, Marty&#39;s helping an adult friend of mine unload a truck (for money and <br/>
    lunch!) and Holly&#39;s off riding bikes with another homeschooler.  <br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;m going to go read a magazine and feel sorry for myself and wish I had some <br/>
    little kids to come wake me up from a nap.<br/>
