<div id="ygrps-yiv-178310909">I run a business that requires my full attention for 1 week every 6 months<br/>
(plus of course other time that I work around things with help from hubby<br/>
and friends). But for the 1 main week of my sale I have my Mother-in-law<br/>
come to town and watch my 7yo son exclusively. She does a great job except<br/>
she feels Damon needs more structure and has taken it upon herself to<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; him things she thinks he is supposed to know (according to her<br/>
friend who teaches 2nd grade). She printed math worksheets from a web site<br/>
and &quot;instructed&quot; him on grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and<br/>
telling time. She wants to grade him and rank him (he scored 80% on a math<br/>
sheet). She has him sitting and practicing writing. She made a &quot;school bag&quot;<br/>
to put things in and gives me daily reports of what she made him do and it<br/>
just breaks my heart! I don&#39;t want this!!! But I don&#39;t really have other<br/>
options for someone to watch him. She&#39;s a good grandma, I know she loves us<br/>
all and wants what&#39;s best for my son but we don&#39;t agree on what that<br/>
entails.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I gave her passes and asked her to take him to the Children&#39;s Museum, ice<br/>
skating lessons, an indoor play place, the library and a park, but that<br/>
wasn&#39;t enough of an agenda for her. He likes to stay home on alternating<br/>
days (if we&#39;re out and about one day, we lay low at home the next day) but<br/>
she prefers to stay busy busy busy every single day. In the past she has<br/>
worn him out physically and mentally. I could tell when I got home each<br/>
night that he was burned out (she&#39;d be punishing him for his &quot;bad behavior&quot;<br/>
after pushing him all day) and I would snuggle with him and read to him (he<br/>
still sleeps in our family bed) to calm him down. She talks all the time and<br/>
he (like us) has learned to tune her out. I believe my husband, my son, and<br/>
I are all introverts who enjoy quiet time at home which helps us recharge<br/>
while grandma is an extrovert who draws her energy from being around other<br/>
people. We get drained while she gets recharged! We&#39;ve taken vacations with<br/>
her where we need to rest at the end just from being around her so long!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is there a tactful way to talk to her I believe we are all learning all the<br/>
time and I don&#39;t appreciate her giving him worksheets? (I&#39;m livid inside but<br/>
don&#39;t let it show. I want to burn the worksheets and not allow her to watch<br/>
him alone anymore, but I know my anger is on the surface. I&#39;m exhausted, we<br/>
just finished our big sale and she leaves tomorrow.) Or perhaps I should<br/>
mellow out and let it be? She means well. It&#39;s only one week every 6 months.<br/>
How much damage can a handful of worksheets and &quot;instruction time&quot; do? She<br/>
mentioned a web site that has lessons you can click and watch and how some<br/>
schools are using it to teach so there&#39;s another teacher in the classroom<br/>
and I just zoned out. (It might even be cool, not sure why I am so resistant<br/>
of any suggestions from her!)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My head is spinning because I cannot seem to see the other options I know<br/>
must be out there! Last spring grandma hurt her shoulder and could not watch<br/>
him, so I had a friend watch him who runs a day care in her house and has a<br/>
son the same age. We&#39;ve used her before but last year he was 6 and the other<br/>
kids his age were in school so he was there with all the &quot;babies&quot; and didn&#39;t<br/>
have a good time until his friend came home from school and they played wii<br/>
until we picked him up. That&#39;s the other thing, I had to pick him up because<br/>
her service ended at 6pm but we were still working until 9 or 10pm so my<br/>
husband or I had to leave and go get him. Once she kept him later and took<br/>
him to karate class, but I don&#39;t like to intrude on her family time so I<br/>
didn&#39;t ask for that a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m usually ok talking with my MIL about our version of homeschooling, but I<br/>
am so worn out right now my brain is not sharp. I&#39;m so close to being<br/>
argumentative, luckily I know enough to just back off and keep quiet. Today<br/>
I tried to talk to her about how well Damon reads and she wanted to know at<br/>
what grade level he&#39;s reading. I said that didn&#39;t matter to me, I tried to<br/>
explain what I&#39;ve observed about how he can sound out new words so fast<br/>
(because he has a huge vocabulary to draw upon, since he knows a lot of<br/>
words he can guess based on the context what word it might be and is usually<br/>
right and just reads on). She wasn&#39;t listening. Apparently knowing his grade<br/>
level matters more to her than understanding him and how he reads! She<br/>
couldn&#39;t just be excited for him that he is reading so well, she wanted to<br/>
rank him but I don&#39;t get why. So she can say he&#39;s at 5th grade for reading<br/>
but only 1st grade for math? Would she have him stop reading to work on math<br/>
until he tests at 2nd grade level for that? He gets multiplication but she&#39;s<br/>
upset that he doesn&#39;t get subtraction. He understands fractions but that&#39;s<br/>
not supposed to happen until 4th grade! She really thinks I&#39;m messing him<br/>
up!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know I invited this when I asked her to watch him for a week, but am<br/>
regretting it now. I need outside ideas! Please be gentle as I am mentally<br/>
drained and not thinking clearly at the moment. J I appreciate your thoughts<br/>
or sharing experiences and how you dealt with something similar.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have an agenda to fix her. And, just as agendas with kids and spouses, they don&#39;t work. Pressure to move in a particular direction often causes people to push back and resist.<br/>
<br/>
How well is her agenda to get you to understand how important schoolish ways are working?<br/>
<br/>
You can share what you do with her but let go of expectations of it changing her at all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If she were just sharing the website because she thought it was cool, if you knew she had no desire to change you, you&#39;d be less likely to zone out. You might even be open to looking at the site to understand more about her even if the site didn&#39;t do anything for you.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling works :-) And that&#39;s why teaching can get kids to tune out and turn off.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve written a lot about *your* reaction to her. What about your son? He&#39;s the one spending all day with her. Does he want her to come? Or would he prefer someone else?<br/>
<br/>
If the daycare friend hadn&#39;t been available when your mother-in-law couldn&#39;t come, what would you have done?<br/>
<br/>
She is who she is. You&#39;re asking her to do you a big favor. If you don&#39;t like the way she volunteers her time, ask someone else. Or pay her or someone else to follow your directions. That&#39;s why employees are paid so they&#39;ll do the job the company wants not whatever they want.<br/>
