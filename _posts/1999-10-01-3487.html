Oh, please do not despair. It is probably just your hormones going wild. <br/>
I found that actually older children require more attention than newborns or infants.<br/>
Babies to not actually have to take all your time and attention. What really worked <br/>
for me was attachment parenting. Well, it is actually funny because it is being with a<br/>
baby all the time and yet it frees you up at the same time. Attachment parenting means<br/>
that you breastfeed your baby till it the child is ready to wean himself off, you sleep<br/>
with the baby and you wear it. I had a sling and the baby was always with me. I could<br/>
take long hikes, do housework, read books. It freed me up enormously to do a lot of<br/>
things I would not be able to do should I have used a crib or a stroller. It also cuts <br/>
down on baby crying. You are right there to respond quickly to baby&#39;s needs and the<br/>
body closeness baby feels actually calms him down.<br/>
Co-sleeping can actually save your sanity. The only time I had a sleepless night was <br/>
when my child had a cold. Again, if your baby wakes up you are there to respond right <br/>
away before it really wakes himself and you up. You are right there to cuddle and nurse <br/>
and I remember quite often nursing practically in my sleep. I didn&#39;t even have to get out<br/>
of bed but the next morning I was fresh and ready to do whatever. You will sure have <br/>
more energy for your older son.<br/>
All this seems to be great for moms and kids. Actually a lot of non-technical cultures <br/>
practice this way of raising children. It seems like a very natural way of doing so.<br/>
There are books on it, but the one l like best is the Baby Book by Dr. Sears and his wife.<br/>
 <br/>
Your son could feel abandoned if you sent him to school when a new baby arrives. Still,<br/>
if you feel you really cannot manage and you do not have enough support that might be<br/>
the best way for you. And do not feel guilty whatever decision you make. Not all ideals <br/>
work for everybody. If taking care of two children proves to be too much for you it makes<br/>
no sense to make a martyr out of yourself. Find any help you can.<br/>
I wish I were there to give you a big hug and help you when the new baby arrives.<br/>
Your mom is wrong though, it does not have to get worse.<br/>
<br/>
All the best to you<br/>
<br/>
Sandy<br/>

This is a great recommendation.  I really believe in attachment parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I want to point out that slings seem to work better for pear-shaped women <br/>
than for apple-shaped woman.  (An apple-shaped woman has hips that are not <br/>
very big and a waist that is not very small.  It&#39;s harder to carry a larger <br/>
baby on your hip if you are built like this.)  Other types of carriers may <br/>
work better for a woman who isn&#39;t pear -shaped.<br/>

<br/>
(1) Stop cleaning the house -- as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
(2) Remember that babies sleep a lot.  This means one-on-one time for Mook.<br/>
<br/>
(3)  Go take a nap.<br/>
<br/>
(4)  2 is very different from the 7 you grew up with.<br/>
<br/>
(5)  Big brothers can help with little ones.  This makes them feel included <br/>

I was thinking about the time my second son arrived.<br/>
It was very stressful.  I wish I had looked at it more realistically.  I<br/>
wish I had been prepared for the jealousy.<br/>
Of course there will not be the same about of time as before for your son,<br/>
but in a family with more than one child, all the children must learn to<br/>
share the attention, and to entertain themselves.  I think this is a good<br/>
thing, but it is a hard thing for them to learn.<br/>
I was very stressed, but I was also trying much to hard.<br/>
Remember that an infant can just &quot;be there&quot; when you are doing things with<br/>
your son.  They don&#39;t really need stimulation all the time.<br/>
Your son can help with many things with the baby too.<br/>
Relax with your son now, snuggling and taking naps together.  Don&#39;t worry ,<br/>
it won&#39;t help.  You&#39;ll just have to take it one day at a time.  Don&#39;t be too<br/>
hard on yourself.  It is a hard time, take it easy!<br/>

<br/>
You say that you can&#39;t do anything for Mook.  You are doing the most<br/>
important thing you can for him by staying home with him.  I think the<br/>
stay-at-home mom/parent has been extremely under-rated.  They have the most<br/>
important jobs on earth.  And they are doing the highest good for their<br/>
kids.  I understand and am not putting down anyone that works.  Please don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong.  I was a single mother for a number of years and I had to work<br/>
to support me and my son, but I praise God that I was finally able to stay<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 kids - 7, 5, 2, and 2mos. so I understand also about 2 yo and<br/>
baby.  My daughter had to learn that the world no longer revolved around her<br/>
as it had when she was a baby.  As children grow up they need to understand<br/>
that they are part of a family not the center of it.  That way, when they<br/>
grow up, they are well adjusted to a world that does not revolve around them<br/>
and it is easier to cope with basic life (things not going their way all the<br/>
time).  I just went through a class at our church called Growing Kids God&#39;s<br/>
Way.  It was awesome!  My hubby and I have seen such a positive change in<br/>
our kids because of basic principles we are now living by.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t let mom get you down.  He might be a handful at first b/c of baby<br/>
but he&#39;ll adjust.  I had my 2yo potty trained before baby was born and she<br/>
started &#39;relapsing&#39; after.  But we just took it one day at a time and she&#39;s<br/>
doing fine now.  Every once in a while she tries to put baby&#39;s diaper on but<br/>
then we remind her she isn&#39;t a baby anymore, but a big girl who can do much<br/>
more things than baby.  And she smiles and goes off to play (something baby<br/>
can&#39;t do).<br/>
<br/>
Keep your chin up!  It&#39;ll be fine, and so will Mook!<br/>

My first son was almost 3 when my second son was born. He was a great<br/>
helper. He would get me things when I was nursing and he would sit with me<br/>
and he would talk to the baby. I have a great picture of him &#39;reading&#39; his<br/>
favorite book to the baby. It was so sweet, he could remember most of the<br/>
words and he did the whole dramatic inflection that mommy uses when she<br/>
reads. There has never been much of a problem with jealousy between them.<br/>
Where our problem is, is with our next child who was born when my second son<br/>
was only 14 months old. At the very same time we also got my then 2 yr old<br/>
step daughter full time (more than 4 days a week) so we went from a family<br/>
of 2 to a family of 4 over night. Now my second son (4) and my daughter (3)<br/>
are constantly at odds. They were just too close. My step daughter seems to<br/>
get along great however. But now we also have a 2 yr old who isn&#39;t ours but<br/>
is with us 5 days a week and she and the 3 yr old are best buddies one<br/>
minute and totally jealous the next.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point is if you involve Mook in the goings on of the baby and you<br/>
also make sure he has his own time with you and dh and also with baby you<br/>
should do fine.  Be sure to involve him now. My oldest would rub my tummy<br/>
and listen and feel for baby kicking. When I was nursing baby once he even<br/>
pulled up his shirt and pretended to nurse his teddy bear. (sooo cute) He<br/>
really felt involved and didn&#39;t see baby as a threat to his relationship<br/>
with us. Emphasize family and don&#39;t sweat the small stuff (like the dishes)<br/>
I would carry baby in a carrier or sling and managed to do quite a bit<br/>
around the house and with my oldest. It can be done. Just don&#39;t stress out,<br/>
that is the worse thing you can do. Blessings to you. When are you due?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-188978104">Okay, weve had all the discussions about kids and dentists, brushing teeth<br/>
etc.  Jonathan, prone to being inflexible and explosive, usually balks at<br/>
brushing his teeth.  Not just I dont want to but NO!!, screaming even.<br/>
There are rare times when I can just hand him the toothbrush and he brushes<br/>
them as if its no issue at all.<br/>
<br/>
Ive opted for the road of non-coercion in this area and calmly explained<br/>
that clean teeth have a better chance of staying healthy.  However, he<br/>
seldom agrees to the brushing thing.<br/>
<br/>
Last night he complained of some pain in his cheek, Im guessing a cavity<br/>
and I can see a spot there.  Ive found a good pediatric dentist near us but<br/>
I can almost guarantee the reaction to this idea.  He has been exceptionally<br/>
rigid and fearful of things since we moved.  He never wants to go anywhere,<br/>
not even toy store or play place.  He only goes places because I have to go<br/>
and he wont leave my side, I cant leave the house without him.<br/>
<br/>
I would really appreciate input, especially how to stand tough with the<br/>
dentist in explaining how things are with Jonathan.  Do I incur major trauma<br/>
for him to have the tooth treated?  Do I let it go until the pain motivates<br/>
him?  Im sure my own fears of the dentist, my mom says I screamed bloody<br/>
murder the first time I saw one, and was punished for my hysteria, of<br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
I know, Im working on a calm façade and I wont lie to Jonathan, Im just<br/>
looking for some stay tough advice from those who understand that his<br/>
emotional health is more important than anything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066172671">I got a recommendation from several people who like this dentist, they even<br/>
have a web site.  The parents are encouraged to be there during the<br/>
procedure and the doctors spend time with the child before doing anything,<br/>
even giving them a tour of the office.  They have live animals and video<br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to ask about nitrous oxide, it might be exactly what Jonathan<br/>
needs.  I&#39;ve decided that even if the pain isn&#39;t from his tooth that we will<br/>
be going in for an exam, a positive experience there will help when real<br/>
work needs to be done.  I&#39;m hoping they also use plastic fillings.<br/>

find a ped. dentist who *listens* to the child and the parent, that would<br/>
be best.<br/>

hates to brush, wound up with an abcessed tooth, which I only <br/>
discovered because he complained of pain in his cheek.  So, if you <br/>
haven&#39;t looked, take a look to make sure.  If you see a sore on the <br/>
gum, it does need to be treated with antibiotics before any dental <br/>
work needs to be done.<br/>

The nice thing is that dentistry has changed DRASTICALLY since the <br/>
time WE were kids, thanks to the specialty of pediatric dentistry.  <br/>
I&#39;m not a big fan of doctor specialists (like pediatricians, since we <br/>
don&#39;t tow the well-child-visits line), but I think pedi dentists are <br/>
WONDERFUL and we&#39;ve had very positive experiences with ours.  I think <br/>
they understand that if a child has a really negative experience with <br/>
a dentist, it means they&#39;ll avoid dental maintenance for a long time <br/>
and pay BIG TIME when they&#39;re adults (how many of us are out there?).<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s first dental experience was when he was about 4.  We went to <br/>
see a &quot;family&quot; dentist and the guy chewed me out for letting my son&#39;s <br/>
teeth get so rotten.  He showed me disgusting pictures of people <br/>
(adults, mind you) who never got dental treatment until it was too <br/>
late.  He essentially told me I was a bad parent for &quot;letting [my] <br/>
son drink pop and eat sweets.&quot;  Nice, right in front of my scared <br/>
4yo.  Butthead!  Then we saw the pedi who was soooo laid back, like <br/>
he had seen this problem thousands of times and explained that some <br/>
people are just born with bad teeth and that he&#39;d take care of things <br/>
with the least trauma possible.  Whew!  I wasn&#39;t a bad parent.  Son <br/>
was treated for abcess and wound up needing a root canal, which he <br/>
got through with flying colors.<br/>
<br/>
Does he take care of his teeth now?  No.  Oh well.  At least the <br/>
dentist won&#39;t chew me out.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since I&#39;ve known people who had the exact opposite experience, I think the <br/>
important thing is to find out the dentist&#39;s philosophy about treating kids <br/>
before subject a child to their care. Some regular dentists are wonderful <br/>
with children, and some ped dentists are horrible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765165063">Just an update, Jonathan woke up with no pain and there doesn&#39;t seem to be<br/>
any swelling.  Maybe he just slept on a bump in the blanket.<br/>
<br/>
I called the ped dentist and grilled them, they are VERY pro child and said<br/>
that if he&#39;s too nervous they don&#39;t push anything.  The receptionist said<br/>
that the kids have free run of the office, good key words for me to hear.<br/>
They even use plastic fillings which was a must for me and another mom who<br/>
uses them says they don&#39;t even flinch when you refuse fluoride.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve decided to keep the first appointment and make it a pleasant trip, just<br/>
a tour and exam if he will let them.<br/>

&gt; to feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d skip the label.  <br/>
<br/>
Was it your daughter&#39;s idea to be at grandma&#39;s, or was she just along for the <br/>
ride?  Was she happily playing something at home when suddenly it was &quot;time <br/>
to go&quot;?  Was she ready for a nap?  A snack?<br/>
<br/>
Because she&#39;s like this only at certain times or places, it sounds like it <br/>
may be situation-specific.<br/>
<br/>
My son is definitely not shy, but he will retreat if someone gets in his <br/>
face.  He&#39;s more comfortable if he&#39;s the one who does the approaching.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the advice to hold her close.  Ask that grandma &quot;Just give her a <br/>
couple of minutes, please.&quot;<br/>
