<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270664335">-=- If I let the kids use the pc or <br/>
<br/>
tv as much as they wanted then there would be an endless fight over who&#39;s <br/>
turn it was and fights get really old, really fast.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Here, whoever&#39;s playing or on e-mail or whatever can stay on as long as they <br/>
need to, until they&#39;re done.  If another has said &quot;I&#39;m next,&quot; then it&#39;s their <br/>
turn next, whether it&#39;s a half an hour or three hours or five minutes.  If <br/>
someone has emergency need to check e-mail or they need to record a show or <br/>
something, they ask for cuts and GET cuts, because it&#39;s rare to ask.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-this happens all the time. If I am totally involved in <br/>
<br/>
something and the kids, animals, chores, meals or whatever needs my attention <br/>
<br/>
I stop and take care of it. Isn&#39;t that something that too needs to be <br/>
learned?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure, but YOU learned and decided what was important, it wasn&#39;t being <br/>
arbitrarily decided outside you.<br/>
<br/>
Playing before dogs are fed wouldn&#39;t happen--there are priorities.  But if <br/>
the clock is a priority over the children&#39;s interests, maybe children&#39;s inte<br/>
rests aren&#39;t being considered sufficiently.   And games have pausing places.  <br/>
If moms say &quot;When you can pause, please go bring wood in&quot; it&#39;s infinitely <br/>
better than &quot;Turn that off right now and get me some wood.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah---I had already used wood gathering before I read the rest of the message <br/>
(because it snowed here and I had boys bring wood in last night, even <br/>
company-visitor boys).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or do you disagree and think I <br/>
<br/>
should still allow my kids to do what they wish whenever they wish? &gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say whenever, I said however long.  I was questioning arbitrary time <br/>
limits.  Books aren&#39;t intrinsically better than moving pictures and <br/>
interactive media.  If that&#39;s true, why not just read homeschooling books <br/>
instead of e-mail lists and bulletin boards?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think it is important that every <br/>
<br/>
family decide what is best for their family. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think anyone making a decision can benefit from more input and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How many levels does a typical Nintendo game have?  I worry that &quot;finished&quot; <br/>
can take a huge amount of time to achieve.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I mean &quot;finished&quot; for then.  When you&#39;re reading a book, don&#39;t you sometimes <br/>
pick a satisfying stopping place instead of stopping right in the middle of a <br/>
paragraph?  Like that.  And in the case of a game, stopping where the game <br/>
can be saved/backed up.<br/>
<br/>
The end of a game, like the last page of a really good novel, can be a <br/>
letdown, because something really provocative has ended.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My 6 year old is asking for Nintendo, which he enjoys playing when he<br/>
<br/>
visits his cousins.  What would be a cheap way to gratify his wishes?  Can<br/>
<br/>
I get an old model and buy mostly used games?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES.   I&#39;d recommend Super Nintendo, because you can still get used ones (and <br/>
maybe even still new ones).  Original NES is no longer supported by anyone. <br/>
And you can get used games for $10 or sometimes less.    <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamestop.com/jump/">http://www.gamestop.com/jump/</a> if there aren&#39;t places near you that sell used <br/>
games and systems.  [Amalia&#39;s right--if they&#39;ve played N64 Super will seem <br/>
small to them, but on the other hand, my kids play with all of them.  There <br/>
was a long, hard game of an old Ninja Turtle four-player game this morning, <br/>
because we have company and they were looking for something older kids could <br/>
do with younger kids (with the house full, people still asleep here and <br/>
there, and snow outside).  TMNT it was.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Last Christmas we got a reconditioned SuperNinendo (including a warranty!) <br/>
for a sibling group for  about $40 at Funcoland. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Funcoland is out of business (sold to Gamestop within the last month).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I can&#39;t fuss too much-------I still have a turntable and a shelf full of <br/>
vinyl LPs!        &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh.... me too. &lt;g&gt;  And we have a whole drawerful of original Nintendo games, <br/>
most bought used.  Marty and I bought Kirby a game for Christmas that he <br/>
didn&#39;t already have, for the regular, and he sat and played it for hours in <br/>
the first few days after Christmas even though he had also gotten the new <br/>
Zelda game for 64.   Just because somone has a shelf full of hardbound, <br/>
color-illustrated books doesn&#39;t mean a cheap paperback isn&#39;t going to have a <br/>
great story!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942181606">&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; I think it is important that every <br/>

 <br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi, I wrote the top line. And when I said it I did not say that I or my <br/>
husband do not listen to our kid&#39;s input or ideas. If we did not listen then <br/>
I would not have 5 puppies in my house right now. ( I use raising dogs as <br/>
examples because it is my kid&#39;s new project/job. They wanted to try raising <br/>
and training dogs for hopeful profit and their Dad and I agreed to let them.) <br/>
What I meant was that we are all in different situations. As our lives differ <br/>
so does the way we decide how we wish to live them.  Sandra mentioned that <br/>
letting her children play video games/tv as long as they wish works in her <br/>
family. And her children often choose not to play the games at all. If this <br/>
concept works in her family who am I to say they should change. If it is <br/>
working then more power to them. All I can really do is look at my family and <br/>
see what works. My children have made choices. Of course they can change <br/>
their minds and often do but when they have made commitments they have to <br/>
stick with them. There is not enough time around here for anyone to be on the <br/>
psx or computer very long. My kids are the ones with the dog business. When <br/>
they started this they agreed that dogs need to be exercised daily at least <br/>
once. Pens need to be cleaned, pups trained, feeding 3 times a day, houses <br/>
built, more pens added. The list goes on. By giving the kids a set amount of <br/>
time they can play the video games then it is fair. (The girls said that if <br/>
the boys could play all they wanted they would never get on again.lol) Then <br/>
if there is more free time I do not care how the kids spend it. And if they <br/>
all want to use the pc then we quickly figure how much freetime they have and <br/>
then divide it up to make it fair. I want to stress that I do not yell at <br/>
them to get off the &quot;whatever&quot; right now. But we did discuss this. I am not <br/>
the one that said &quot;hey why don&#39;t you get 10 dogs and tie yourselves down&quot;. I <br/>
am the one that agreed to let them try what they wanted to do. And if I have <br/>
to remind them that it is chores before play around here then I do, because <br/>
animals cannot wait until there is a good time to pause in a game. This is my <br/>
family, and this is working. We are not working fools. The puppies are fun, <br/>
and the grown dogs are loving, and we are working together and learning as we <br/>
go. <br/>
     What works in my family may very well flop in yours. Isn&#39;t that one very <br/>
big problem in public schools treating all the kids the same though they are <br/>
so different. I am not sure what I am trying to say is getting across. I <br/>
suppose it is that giving out ideas and thoughts is great and we can all pick <br/>
and choose what we can use. But for me to say that your family should be <br/>
jogging 3 times a day( or whatever, fill in the blank) would be wrong. I <br/>
might tell you how much my family jogs but that does not mean it is what you <br/>
or your family should do. <br/>
