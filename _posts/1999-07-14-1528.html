<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559124163">Your Dad must have never gone to the Adak National Forest. There were<br/>
thousands of trees there, many over a hundred years old. I have a picture of<br/>
me standing in front of the sign for the forest. Unfortunately, the sign was<br/>
taller than any of the trees and the sign wasn&#39;t much over 5 feet tall! The<br/>
high volcanic ash content of the soil didn&#39;t provide a fertile environment<br/>
for growing trees.<br/>
<br/>
When we left in 1969, I remember flying into Seattle and taking a cab from<br/>
the airport. Two of my brothers kept getting excited at seeing these 50 and<br/>
60 foot trees. The cab driver turned to my mom and said &quot;What&#39;s wrong with<br/>
these kids, haven&#39;t they ever seen a tree before?&quot; When she said &quot;no&quot;, he<br/>
didn&#39;t ask anymore questions. For many years after that, I felt obligated to<br/>
climb as many trees as I could.<br/>
<br/>
Adak was called &quot;Birthplace of the Winds.&quot; I can remember riding sleds while<br/>
using a snow disk (about a 3 foot diameter disk designed for you to sit in<br/>
and slide down slopes) as a sail and having contests to see how far you<br/>
could lean back against the wind without falling over.<br/>

&gt;My dad was stationed there in 1951. He said the big joke was to<br/>
&gt;tell new guys<br/>
&gt;going there that in Adak there was a girl behind every tree. Too<br/>
&gt;bad there were<br/>
&gt;no trees! </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-423988164">Ah, Billy, you&#39;ve stirred up some great memories for me about Adak!<br/>
<br/>
We were there in the mid-80&#39;s with our three children; at the time one<br/>
was was in preschool and the other two were in elementary school. It was<br/>
a great place to live! Families were very close, little tv watching<br/>
(that 5-hour time difference really ruins prime time television<br/>
viewing!), and lots of social/neighborly functions. <br/>
<br/>
We always enjoyed the PhilAm Society functions, hosted by the Filipino<br/>
community. Great food (remember lumpia?), and we learned so many neat<br/>
things about their culture.<br/>
<br/>
My son and husband remember salmon fishing in the stream near Finger<br/>
Bay. The salmon were so thick the water was black. My son&#39;s first<br/>
&quot;catch&quot; was actually a salmon which had jumped out of the stream,<br/>
landing on his foot! We&#39;ll never let him live THAT fish story down! He<br/>
also remembers as a little boy being afraid of the swooping eagles when<br/>
he went fishing with his dad. Remember the numerous bald eagle<br/>
population? My son used to call immature eagles, &quot;minature&quot; eagles,<br/>
confusing his words! <br/>
<br/>
We saw some great sites while living there. Otters, Emperor Geese, sea<br/>
lions, halibut the size of small automobiles! Once, a couple of Beluga<br/>
whales beached themselves over at Kuluk Bay. We saw puffins and<br/>
ptarmigan and caribou. When dining at a Denali Park restaurant on an<br/>
off-island trip, we ate booburgers, not hamburgers.<br/>
<br/>
The kids fondly remember having to wear earplugs while flying on C-130&#39;s<br/>
or C-147&#39;s, and the flight crew allowing them in the cockpit to view the<br/>
great expanse of blue sky out those cabin windows.<br/>
<br/>
I guess our most exciting memory of Adak was the 7.7 earthquake we<br/>
experienced about five weeks after we moved there! My husband happened<br/>
to be in Anchorage then doing some Army Reserve stuff. He was in the<br/>
post exchange when they announced over the loudspeaker that Adak had<br/>
just experienced the quake. Talk about frantic! The telephone lines were<br/>
down for some time and he as really worried. Everything was ok, though;<br/>
just slight damage to some dishes and such. Everyone &quot;evactuated&quot; to<br/>
Bering Hill and waited for the tsunami which never arrived! It was scary<br/>
at the time, though, I must admit. T-shirts were printed up afterwards<br/>
boasting, &quot;I survived a 7.7!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing that always left me humbled was the beautiful, tiny, delicate<br/>
violets, anenomes, and other wildflowers which would shoot up out of<br/>
that nasty old tundra every spring. It seemed impossible to me that<br/>
something so delicate could blanket what had only weeks earlier been<br/>
frozen over with snow and ice.<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky enough once to fly out to Attu on a trip to Anchorage;<br/>
usually, the planes would only go as far west as Shemya to pick up<br/>
passengers, and then head to Anchorage. To this day, I love to remind my<br/>
husband that I&#39;VE been to Attu, and he hasn&#39;t! Once in a blue moon,<br/>
&quot;Attu&quot; will be a Jeopardy! answer, and I always have to say something<br/>
like, &quot;Do you remember that...oh, I&#39;m sorry Jimmy, you&#39;ve never been<br/>
there.&quot; LOL<br/>
<br/>
We made some great friends while living there (we were civilians), some<br/>
of whom we still keep in touch. Island living forces strong bonds.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the memories, Billy!<br/>

I&#39;ve never been to Attu (and after that glorious description, I feel like I <br/>

you?  Are you with a support group?  I&#39;m in Mt. Pleasant.... three girls -- <br/>

Actually, if her dad was military it might have been Shemya (sp) that he was <br/>
on.  There is a or, was, a small military base there and that was the saying <br/>
used, there were no trees. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the late 1970&#39;s early 80&#39;s a congressman visited Shemya, Alaska, where the <br/>
Military Intelligence base was.  He stepped off the plane and there was a <br/>
marching band.  Lots of fanfare....  He commented to the Sargeant that was <br/>
assigned to escort him along with a few officers that he&#39;d never had such a <br/>
welcoming.  The Sgt. said Oh, sir I&#39;m sorry, the band isn&#39;t for you.  On this <br/>
plane was the first female to be assigned to the island.<br/>
<br/>
Military men do have their priorities.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope, Dad was on Adak -- I&#39;ve heard the stories a million times. There was a Navy<br/>
installation there in the 50&#39;s -- he was there during the first halff of the<br/>
Korean War, and said he much prefered freezing his butt off than having it shot<br/>
off in Korea. Dad was a real hero in Adak -- he was a steamfitter, in charge of<br/>
keeping the heat on for everyone! I don&#39;t think there are still Navy facilities<br/>
in Adak, as I heard they were closing down.<br/>

what part are you headed back to? I live in the Matanuska Valley, in<br/>
Wasilla, or rather, just outside of Wasilla. You wouldn&#39;t believe the summer<br/>
here, we&#39;ve actually been hot, longing for cool, rainy days:))<br/>
