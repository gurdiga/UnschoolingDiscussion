<div id="ygrps-yiv-733219555">We have reason to believe that Jacob&#39;s behavior (at 2 1/2 yrs) falls somewhere on the range of the Autism Spectrum.  I&#39;m in the information-gathering stage of researching all this, and  have a couple questions that I&#39;m sure some of you dyed-in-the-wool unschoolers will have answers for.<br/>
<br/>
First, I am trying to decide whether or not to pursue an assessment and diagnosis for Jacob.  Seems to me the only reason to do this at this point would be to get him into an Early Intervention program.  Now, I&#39;m having trouble finding out exactly what is involved in &quot;Early Intervention&quot; -- most of the information I have just says it&#39;s &quot;very important&quot; (whatever that means) to a child&#39;s future to get diagnosed and started on &quot;Intervention&quot; as early as possible, but nothing seems to go into any detail about what it entails. I was wondering if anybody knows.  Seems to me &quot;Early Intervention&quot; is probably not a very unschooling thing to do??  <br/>
<br/>
My other concern (and this might not be something anyone here can answer) is that, if I DO pursue a diagnosis, am I legally bound in some way to then enroll him in Early Intervention?  Or any other form of &quot;treatment&quot;?   I have enough references on the topic of autism to keep me reading for the next 18 years of his life &lt;G&gt;, but haven&#39;t come across this sort of information yet.  I just want to know what I&#39;m getting us into should I decide to go down that path<br/>
<br/>
I am also looking for information on unschooling children with developmental disorders.  Seems to me this would be a natural thing to do with a &quot;unique&quot; child like this, but need some reassurance that I&#39;m making the proper decision in this matter.  I was/am firmly commited to unschooling our kids until this came up, and just want to make sure I don&#39;t need to think about altering those plans.<br/>
<br/>
I am extremely leary about affixing a &quot;label&quot; to Jacob that he will be stuck with the rest of his life -- he is an amazing and unique individual, and the thought of lumping him under some sort of diagnosis/classification is disturbing to me.  But of course I want to do the &quot;right&quot; thing by him, regardless of how uncomfortable it makes ME.  I&#39;m just trying to figure out what that &quot;right&quot; thing is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to anyone willing to share their thoughts or information!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even more important than what&#39;s involved is what its intent is.<br/>
<br/>
The intent is to prepare kids for the environment of school.<br/>
<br/>
What they do in Early Intervention may sound like reasonable skills for<br/>
anyone to have, like responding when spoken to for instance. But the intent<br/>
is to make the kids less of a problem in a classroom. I&#39;m sure the people<br/>
running the programs are absolutely convinced the intent is to help the<br/>
children. But since they&#39;re certain that school is the only way for people<br/>
to succeed, being trained to learn in a school setting *is* (from that<br/>
mindset) helping the children. So, ultimately the purpose is to help the<br/>
teachers so the kids aren&#39;t disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
As much as institutions are certain they know what children need, they<br/>
really only know what children who are or will be in school need. To society<br/>
the two are one in the same since basically every child who breathes will go<br/>
to school. But since in reality the two are not the same, everything that<br/>
institutions say is necessary for kids needs to be questioned.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am also looking for information on unschooling children with developmental<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a very good folder on the Unschooling.com message boards about<br/>
unschooling and special needs. Go to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Intervention&quot; -- most of the &gt;information I have just says it&#39;s &quot;very<br/>
important&quot; (whatever that means) to a child&#39;s future to get &gt;diagnosed and<br/>
started on &quot;Intervention&quot; as early as possible, but nothing seems to go into<br/>
any detail &gt;about what it entails. I was wondering if anybody knows.  Seems<br/>
to me &quot;Early Intervention&quot; is &gt;probably not a very unschooling thing to do??<br/>
<br/>
I have two very good friends who have been through this and intervention has<br/>
made AMAZING differences.<br/>
<br/>
The thing to remember is that learning things that will help your child<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they have to be done in sterile medical or schooly settings.<br/>
Therapy at this age is very play oriented, but it&#39;s play with a direction.<br/>
And what it does for kids on the autism spectrum is re-configure the brain<br/>
wiring (ok, that&#39;s this AMAZINGLY SHORTHAND version) so that the stuff<br/>
non-autistic kids just &#39;get&quot; can come in.<br/>
<br/>
You are helping their brains to GET unschooling.  Same as if you gave them<br/>
insulin so their bodies GOT the right sugar levels.<br/>
<br/>
As for labels, I&#39;ve always felt that have as much power as we give them.  If<br/>
you were putting him in a school setting, they&#39;d have more power because all<br/>
the other people who deal with him would get to add their &quot;power&quot; to it.  If<br/>
that makes sense.  But if you get some diagnosis, have a therapist or two<br/>
and then you and your family--whose power is doing the work?<br/>
<br/>
Hope that paragraph makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &quot;locked into Intervention?&quot;  That I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m going to ask<br/>
one of my friends about what she thinks it would have been like for her, if<br/>
you don&#39;t mind?<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Therapy at this age is very play oriented, but it&#39;s play with a direction.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s directing the play that I have a problem with.  But I guess I need to decide if that sort of direction is NEEDED or not, rather than whether I&#39;d rather avoid it (which I would).  I am naturally suspicious of anything that causes manipulation, no matter how &quot;gentle&quot; or goal oriented.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I could convince myself this was true, I would definitely go for the Intervention.  So, more reading, reading, reading!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;As for labels, I&#39;ve always felt that have as much power as we give them.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if it were just DH and our sons, this wouldn&#39;t be a concern. But there are grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins who all have a tremendous role in our kids&#39; lives.  Some of whom are going to hold that label over his head.  By the same token, those are the same folks whose behavior with him is geared towards an &quot;average&quot; kid and is hence innappropriate for him -- getting a &quot;doctors&quot; diagnosis might go a long way towards helping them understand and interact with him more appropriately.  (Of course, they blame his eccentricities on us &quot;sheltering&quot; him -- sigh!)  I can see significant plusses and minuses to it.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m not entirely sure there&#39;s not something to be gained from it as well, or how much flexibility I might have in WHICH areas are covered.  But since any  manipulation of what comes &quot;naturally&quot; to a child goes against the grain of what I believe about learning, my tendency would be to stay away from it.  I just need to make sure my &quot;gut&quot; is telling me the right thing in this situation.  It&#39;s so reassuring to know that there are others that feel the same way about this stuff!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965221348">Just a quick word of advice here (my apologies if this has already <br/>
been covered):<br/>
<br/>
If you do decide for whatever reason to have your child <br/>
professionally evaluated, get him tested PRIVATELY. DON&#39;T go through <br/>
any program offered by the local school district or Intermediate <br/>
Unit, because in many states (such as here in PA) having your child <br/>
labeled as &quot;special needs&quot; will indeed place additional restrictions <br/>
on your homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

without mentioning the diagnosis.  That way they know that you&#39;re &quot;on it&quot;<br/>
They know there&#39;s a doctor following him.  They&#39;re more likely to do things<br/>

But you don&#39;t give them a label for him.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing you might want to do is read Sonrise, and check into the<br/>
institute that those parents formed.  Your son may not be as severely<br/>
autistic as their boy was, but some of what they did with their might be<br/>
just the kind intervention your son needs.  For those who haven&#39;t read the<br/>
book, the parents basically &quot;went into&quot; their son&#39;s world, in a sense<br/>
validating his way of being, rather than trying to drag him into their<br/>
world.  Must have worked, as the boy apparently went on to do well in<br/>
school, etc.  (Not my favourite measure of doing well, but it was the<br/>
measure that was important to them.)<br/>

convince them he can&#39;t read due to some innate disability that doesn&#39;t exist, <br/>
then they get extra money for keeping him illiterate!  BTW, do you know any <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047839163">Hey, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Shelley, Kelly forwarded your message to me, and I want to apologize <br/>
ahead of time for not taking the time to read the wonderful responses <br/>
you&#39;ve already received, and I&#39;m probably going to be repeating some <br/>
of their thoughts...but I just wanted to give you my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m having trouble finding out exactly what is involved in &quot;Early <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Intervention&quot; -- most of the information I have just says it&#39;s &quot;very <br/>
important&quot; (whatever that means) to a child&#39;s future to get diagnosed <br/>
and started on &quot;Intervention&quot; as early as possible, but nothing seems <br/>
to go into any detail about what it entails.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Most *experts* might say that preschool and school (and in some <br/>
cases, even daycare) are VERY IMPORTANT to a child&#39;s future.  As <br/>
unschoolers, we&#39;re learning how to listen to our own hearts, and see <br/>
what is right for our children and for our families, and tuning out <br/>
those background noises in our minds that are from all of the <br/>
*experts.* <br/>
<br/>
Shelley ~ my only concern with getting a diagnosis is not how other <br/>
people will feel about your Jacob, but how he will feel about <br/>
himself.  <br/>
<br/>
My own child was always unique and non-traditional, but because he <br/>
was always celebrated and honored for being exactly Who He Is, he had <br/>
no labels attached to his heart.  He&#39;s always been comfortable with <br/>
being unique, and never had any thought that there may be something <br/>
wrong with him that needed to be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
But I guess the answer lies within how far on the spectrum your son <br/>
is.  <br/>
<br/>
What are his *traits* that are of concern to you, Shelley?  Sometimes <br/>
if you just learn about ways you can help your child yourself, then <br/>
that is sufficient.  I found a lot of good information in the <br/>
book &quot;The Out of Sync Child&quot; and &quot;The Highly Sensitive Child.&quot;  It&#39;s <br/>
because of the latter book that I no longer feel my child is on the <br/>
autistic spectrum.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I am also looking for information on unschooling children with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>developmental disorders.  Seems to me this would be a natural thing <br/>
to do with a &quot;unique&quot; child like this, but need some reassurance that <br/>
I&#39;m making the proper decision in this matter.  I was/am firmly <br/>
commited to unschooling our kids until this came up, and just want to <br/>
make sure I don&#39;t need to think about altering those plans.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Once again, Shelley, my Jake has always been unschooled (he&#39;s almost <br/>
13), and it is the best label-free life for any unique child.  They <br/>
are free to be Who They Are, without anyone telling them they have to <br/>
be like all the other kids.  They can follow their hearts and their <br/>
passions without control or intervention or direction from others <br/>
telling them not to listen to their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
I have an article that Sandra kindly has on her website (it&#39;s <br/>
entitled &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/special/anne">http://sandradodd.com/special/anne</a><br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll be talking about this at the South Carolina conference?  Are <br/>
you coming??  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; I am extremely leary about affixing a &quot;label&quot; to Jacob that he <br/>
 </span></blockquote>will be stuck with the rest of his life -- he is an amazing and <br/>
unique individual, and the thought of lumping him under some sort of <br/>
diagnosis/classification is disturbing to me.  But of course I want <br/>
to do the &quot;right&quot; thing by him, regardless of how uncomfortable it <br/>
makes ME.  I&#39;m just trying to figure out what that &quot;right&quot; thing <br/>
is.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re listening to your heart, Shelley.  Thank you.  Thank you for <br/>
seeing your child as the amazing and unique person that he is.  He <br/>
needs you to do that for him for his entire life, because there will <br/>
be enough people out there giving him the message that he&#39;s less than <br/>
Whole.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t believe in adding to that message with a diagnosis <br/>
(again, unless he is absolutely in need of some intervention, but, <br/>
again, that may be obtained just by reading about Sensory Integration <br/>
Dysfunction, as all children on the autism spectrum has Sensory <br/>
Integration Dysfunction...and you could even get an occupational <br/>
therapist for his sensory integration dysfunction challenges if <br/>
absolutely necessary...).<br/>
<br/>
Your heart is telling you to continue to Honor your child for Who He <br/>
Is.  I think it&#39;s the right step for today.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to talk more about what specific concerns you have <br/>
about Jacob&#39;s traits, I&#39;d be happy to respond more.  I&#39;ll put this <br/>
list on individual e-mails and only read the ones with the subject <br/>
title &quot;autism spectrum disorders.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41581929">Anne, thank you so much for your response!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always known that Jacob was a unique child, since he was born even, he just seemed to respond to the world differently than other kids.  This has become more evident as he&#39;s gotten older (he&#39;s only 2 1/2 now).  Tho I knew there were differences, I hadn&#39;t considered that there as anything &quot;wrong&quot; with him until a friend suggested I read a Screeening for Austistic Symptoms in Toddlers (she suspected he may fall on the spectrum somewhere).  I thought, no, that can&#39;t be, but read through the screening anyway, and found I was answering &quot;yes&quot; to far more questions than I was answering &quot;no&quot; to.  So I read and read and read, and discussed with my husband, and we&#39;ve come to the conclussion that he does in deed seem to fit into this &quot;category&quot; of individuals.  The most telling thing to us was visiting some Autism/Asperger&#39;s discussion boards and suddenly, after never knowing a single other child like Jacob, we were reading about a lot of kids JUST LIKE HIM.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s sort of a laundry list of his &quot;suspect&quot; behaviors:  (We of course think these are an expression of his unique way of viewing the world and expressing himself! :-)  <br/>
<br/>
--he is non-conversational: although he chats all the time, what he is doing is reciting lines from book and video (which he does all day long, mostly to himself, but to trusted others as well).<br/>
--he is obsessed with certain topics, especially letters and numbers -- he knew the entire alphabet at about 18 mos, could count to 100 by his 2nd birthday.  He is currently teaching himself to read.<br/>
--he has &quot;rules&quot; about play that must be followed or else a tantrum ensues<br/>
--he has a very self-restricted diet, and refuses to try new foods<br/>
--he will not allow anyone but immediate family a a few trusted others to touch him<br/>
--he shies away from contact with other children<br/>
--he avoids eye contact with anyone he doesn&#39;t know (and even a lot of people he does know)<br/>
--he prefers to play by himself<br/>
--he uses our hands as &quot;tools&quot; to pick up things he wants<br/>
--he has an amazing photographic memory -- he seems to remember everything he is exposed to instantly and can recite lines from TV shows he&#39;s only seen once, and can recite a book after it&#39;s been read to him just one time<br/>
--he does not use pronouns in his speech<br/>
--he is unable to answer questions unless they are yes or no questions, and echoes back the question as well as the yes or no answer<br/>
--he has an AMAZING attention span -- will repeat the same puzzle/book/task over and over and over again for hours sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I found a lot of good information in the <br/>
&gt;book &quot;The Out of Sync Child&quot; and &quot;The Highly Sensitive Child.&quot;  It&#39;s <br/>

&gt;autistic spectrum.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read &quot;the Highly Sensitive Child&quot; a couple months ago, and agree that some of it sounded pretty similar.  But it wasn&#39;t until I started reading up on Apserger&#39;s Syndrome that I felt &quot;AHA!  That&#39;s him!&quot;  I think he IS Highly Sensitive also, but I guess that would sort of go hand-in-hand anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Once again, Shelley, my Jake has always been unschooled (he&#39;s almost <br/>
&gt;13), and it is the best label-free life for any unique child.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Anne, that is exactly the kind of experience I am looking to read about!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have an article that Sandra kindly has on her website (it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;entitled &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;):<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>:-)  Sandra directed me to your excellent article -- it helped my DH and I both to see that following our heart and avoiding that label is going to be the best thing for us, so THANK YOU!  My DH is also finally convinced that unschooling is the way to go with our kids (he wasn&#39;t completely on-board with that decision when I first broached the topic with him a couple years ago) -- now that he sees how the public school (or any &quot;school&quot; system) would be a disaster for Jacob, he can see this is the best course to take.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And I&#39;ll be talking about this at the South Carolina conference?  Are <br/>
&gt;you coming??  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh I wish!  We have a small farm, and can&#39;t be away from it for a length of time like that.  Will be going to MA next year, tho, as we live nearby.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;That&#39;s why I don&#39;t believe in adding to that message with a diagnosis <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for reassuring us about the decision we made this weekend -- which is to not seek out a diagnosis (at least not right now).  We are going to start a gluten free/casein free diet with him (and us!), and let him continue to learn and develop at HIS pace.  I don&#39;t feel that his development has stalled, it just seems to be a little slower than most kids -- I&#39;ve never seen any huge change in his personality or behavior.  He&#39;s the same child I gave birth too -- just a little different than the average Joe, that&#39;s all.  I think his brain is so full of other things that the developmental stuff just needs time for it to make room for it.  I see him hitting his milestones, just not on the same time table as every other kid.  Yesterday he used his first pro-noun, and spoke his first complicated sentence, and the first thing that I would consider to be &quot;conversational&quot;.  (We were joking around, he was calling me Daddy to be silly, I was calling him Linus, his cat&#39;s name.  He was laughing and laughing and then said &quot;No Linus.  My name is Jacob.&quot;)  That confirmed to us that he&#39;ll get where he needs to be, he&#39;s just going to do it on &quot;Jacob time&quot;.  And I don&#39;t feel that I have the right to interfere -- I trust that his brain knows what it&#39;s doing, and I don&#39;t want to stand in the way of it figuring things out in the manner that is best for him.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks so much for responding, Anne.  DH and I appreciate your expertise and experience!<br/>

<br/>
He sounds so wonderful, Shelley.  I wish I could meet him.<br/>
 <br/>
I agree that he sounds on the spectrum, along the Asperger lines.  <br/>
 <br/>
Have you read Tony Attwood&#39;s paper, Discovery of Aspie Criteria.  It&#39;s a<br/>
beautiful paper:   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tonyattwood.com/paper4.htm">http://www.tonyattwood.com/paper4.htm</a> <br/>
<br/>
I once wrote to Tony Attwood and told him that I thought he was doing a<br/>
disservice by not recommending homeschooling for Asperger&#39;s children, except<br/>
as a last resort.  He basically told me that he does strongly believe in<br/>
homeschooling the Asperger&#39;s child, but he has to connect with the majority<br/>
of the population, and he believes that it&#39;s not a feasible option for most<br/>
people.  Sad.  I know for a fact it would save their lives.  Especially in<br/>
the confusing teen years. <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who introduced me to her child, and I knew immediately that<br/>
he was an Aspie.  He took my hand and led me to an engine exhibit (we were<br/>
in the library), and told me all about the engines that were on display.  My<br/>
friend was amazed.  She said he has never done that to anyone before, never<br/>
opened up and been so comfortable with a stranger.  I think this child could<br/>
feel my energy and he understood that I thought he was amazing BECAUSE of<br/>
his unique gifts, not in spite of them.  He knew and felt that I honored him<br/>
 and he felt at home with that, even though he&#39;d never met me before.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
***I think his brain is so full of other things that the developmental stuff<br/>
just needs time for it to make room for it.***<br/>
<br/>
I love your perception of your child.  He is blessed to have you.  This is<br/>
how I always saw my child.  I trusted that his body would catch up with his<br/>
brain some day!<br/>
<br/>
***I trust that his brain knows what it&#39;s doing, and I don&#39;t want to stand<br/>
in the way of it figuring things out in the manner that is best for him.***<br/>
<br/>
I love this, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I also want to suggest that you stay mindful of the fact that you can help<br/>
in little ways throughout the course of his day.  You&#39;re doing the most<br/>
wonderful thing by allowing him to Shine and Bless the Universe with his<br/>
gifts, gifts that only he can bring to the earth.  But just also stay<br/>
mindful of the things that he needs to feel Safe and Secure, and honoring<br/>
those things about him will help him to continue to Shine.  Those places in<br/>
his life in which he feels safe, go into those places with him.  Explore how<br/>
he sees things in his mind, and in his heart.  Share his world with him, and<br/>
this will help him to feel safe and secure to come out of his world and take<br/>
part in the bigger world.<br/>
<br/>
His perception of the world originates through your eyes.  Help him to<br/>
understand the world outside of himself.  Help it to be a safe, loving place<br/>
  Know that it is hugely beneficial for you to put forth the effort to<br/>
explain things to your child that you assume other people would understand<br/>
about the world and life.  Talk about everything, even though he may not<br/>
respond to it.  Discuss everything.  <br/>
<br/>
Shelley, does Jacob, himself, feel frustrated with any of his challenges?  <br/>
<br/>
Continue to let him Shine in your eyes and your heart, and all will be well.<br/>
 One day at a time.  For today, all is well exactly as it is.<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Have you read Tony Attwood&#39;s paper, Discovery of Aspie Criteria<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is SO cool!  Jacob&#39;s in a Kindermusik class, and we are so lucky that the instructor really &quot;gets&quot; him, and loves him for all of his wonderful quirks without trying to suggest that he&#39;s anything but absolutely fabulous.  Music is definitely one of the MANY areas where he shines! :-)  (LOVE that term -- SHINE -- so appropriate!)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;respond to it.  Discuss everything.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, that&#39;s just what we do.  I ask his opinion about everything, even when I know there will be no opinion coming.  (But if I word it as a yes or no question, like &quot;shall we go to the market?&quot;, I can almost always get a response, and it&#39;s fortuantely usually a yes.)  I also listen carefully if he&#39;s strongly opposed to anything -- for instance, we stopped at a small demonstration farm because he very much enjoys animals.  There was a rooster crowing, so he didn&#39;t want to enter the barnyard (he is bothered by loud noises).  So we didn&#39;t go in -- we walked along the fence and pointed out the horses and cows and llamas instead.  From that distance he could quite enjoy the animals -- if I had forced the issue and made him go inside, maybe he would have had fun, but I didn&#39;t think it was worth risking his trust.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Shelley, does Jacob, himself, feel frustrated with any of his challenges?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes he does, particularly when his mind is so far ahead of his physical capabilities that he can&#39;t complete tasks he wants to.  For instance, he went thru a phase when he was around a year old where he wanted to stack blocks 5 to 8 blocks high.  His physical coordination wasn&#39;t such that he could do that without kocking them down before he reached the height he wanted to, and we had many tears and frustration.  DH wanted to put the blocks away to prevent him from getting so frustrated, but I decided that helping him be successful would be a better approach, so I showed him how to build the blocks against a wall -- that way they only could fall over in a couple directions instead of all around, and he was successful at least part of the time.  Within a few months, his dexterity caught up to his stacking desires and he was able to stack blocks wherever he wanted.  He worked on block stacking for hours on end every day to get to that point, it was amazing to watch!<br/>
<br/>
I love the way he takes on challenges like that -- if he decides he wants to do something he practices until it&#39;s perfect.  A lot of frustration is often involved in the process, but his determination is absolutely awe inspiring.  We spent a couple of hours at the playground the other day learning to climb a ladder.  He saw another kid about his size do it, and decided he had to &quot;own&quot; that activity as well.  At first I had to hold him while he practiced moving his legs up the rungs (something we&#39;ve been doing for a long time).  Then he started holding on with his hands and &quot;climbing&quot; with them too (with me still holding on).  He finally got coordinated enough to really climb the ladder on his own, but we had a whole bunch of steps in weaning him off of needing my help -- first I had to hold him the whole way, then just a hand on his butt, then just a hand for the last couple rungs, then just standing nearby.  By the end of those 2 hours, parents who had come to the playground after he mastered his new climbing skill commented on how good he was at that for his age!  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I&#39;m rambling, but get me going on my favorite topic....&lt;G&gt;. Thanks for letting me share how special Jacob is with you!  I just know, watching him master challenges in his own way, that he&#39;s going to be just fine no matter what challenges lay in his future.  I&#39;ll help him when he needs and wants it!<br/>

It&#39;s such a contradiction, isn&#39;t it?  Their perfect expectations of <br/>
themselves, and their actual physical ability.  I have learned so <br/>
much about the human spirit from my child.  It is difficult to watch <br/>
them be so frustrated, but I also want to reassure you that it does <br/>
get easier as they get older and they do catch up ~ and they learn so <br/>
much from their frustrating and challenging times.<br/>
<br/>
For so many years, my Jake wanted to draw Pokemon characters.  He&#39;d <br/>
pick up colored pencils and get so frustrated that what was coming <br/>
out of his hands wasn&#39;t matching what was in his head.  I remembered <br/>
reading about working with clay, so we bought some sculpey in the <br/>
colors of the characters he wanted to make.  He was AMAZING with the <br/>
sculpey.  He re-created Pokemon characters perfectly, and found great <br/>
satisfaction with the process, too.<br/>
<br/>
After a couple of years, he tried drawing again, and because of time <br/>
and I believe because of his clay *therapy*, he was able to draw what <br/>
was in his mind.  He is a good artist now, and he draws his own comic <br/>
strips, along with still drawing those Pokemon!   <br/>

Jacob is blessed to have you, and to be on this unschooling journey <br/>
with you.  Thank you for finding the best way to let him Shine, and <br/>
to allow his Light to bless the entire universe.<br/>
