<div id="ygrps-yiv-404918571">Now, I do not believe my house has ghosts, but the strangest  thing did happen<br/>
earlier this week. In the middle of the night, my husband had to get up to use<br/>
the washroom. While he was in there, I really believed that one of my girls (who<br/>
had earlier climbed into bed with us) had gotten down from the bed and was<br/>
heading his way. when my husband returned I had asked him which girl had gotten<br/>
up and went into the bathroom? He was amazed at my question and replied, no one.<br/>
The strange part of this was he had then told me that while he was proceeding to<br/>
go into the washroom, he believed he saw a small shadow of what looked to be a<br/>
child run past him. It gave both of us shivers.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206190054">Don&#39;t you also think that some folks are simply more receptive and<br/>
&quot;see/feel&quot; them more?  And that in some instances when ones preconditioned<br/>
armor is down (like that story), that one &quot;sees&quot; what was there all along<br/>
but what one didn&#39;t recognize??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely.  Some people can go their whole lives without seeing <br/>
what is around them.  Being receptive or at least having your guard <br/>
down increases your chances of seeing something.<br/>
