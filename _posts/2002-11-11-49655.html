<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729735580">I&#39;ve been lurking on this site for a month now, and I know I can <br/>
trust the opinion of you guys.<br/>
I have a 5yo daughter who I had always planned on unschooling at some <br/>
point, I wanted to leave it up to her.  She was in preschool 7 1/2 <br/>
hours a week last year, just to give us a break from eachother.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t realize they were getting her all excited about going to <br/>
kindergarten this year, so of course she wanted to go.<br/>
<br/>
I found a pretty cool school, they don&#39;t grade, they have time for <br/>
independent projects, etc, and I got pretty excited about it myself.  <br/>
The first day of kindy, my sensitive little girl came out bawling <br/>
about how she much she hated it(there are a few little brats that <br/>
like to hit, spit, etc.).  By that time I was so blinded by how great <br/>
I thought the school was going to be, I convinced her to stay.  She <br/>
cried everyday for 3 weeks about something that had happened during <br/>
the day, but she seemed to want to go back (I should mention here <br/>
that my daughter has a sensory integration disorder, so crying daily <br/>
is normal for her).  <br/>
<br/>
Now at 10 weeks of school, after me spending nearly one day a week <br/>
volunteering in the classroom, I see that I really don&#39;t want her <br/>
staying there.  I feel horrible for ignoring her instincts those <br/>
first couple weeks, but now she loves it, and whenever I mention <br/>
homeschooling, she freaks out and says she wants to stay at school.  <br/>
She really loves her friends and teacher and recess, and so do I, but <br/>
the room is stressful and chaotic, there are just too many 5yos in <br/>
one place.  She&#39;s gotten used to the stress, but it can&#39;t be good for <br/>
her.  The poor little thing has had dark circles under her eyes since <br/>
the first day of school.<br/>
<br/>
My question is do I listen to her and leave her in school?  How do I <br/>
get her in touch with those initial bad feelings she had about school <br/>
after I made her supress them?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to have her make friends with other homeschoolers, so she <br/>
would want to just stay home and play with them, but I&#39;m finding most <br/>
homeschoolers around here don&#39;t want to play everyday like we do.  <br/>
They like to be isolated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked other homeschooler parents what to do and of course they <br/>
look at me like I&#39;m crazy and say, &quot;you&#39;re the parent, pull her <br/>
out!&quot;  I know my daughter has to make that choice, doesn&#39;t she? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, I do like the school, they play and make bread, there&#39;s no <br/>
acedemic pressure.   The other parents and even her teacher <br/>
understand my desire to unschool, but still it is more &quot;schooly&quot; than <br/>
I expected, and ultimately not what I want for my daughter.<br/>

<br/>
I think it will do more damage than you want to do for you to thwart her.<br/>
<br/>
From her point of view, when she was unhappy, you told her she was really <br/>
happy.  If now that she feels happy you tell her she should really be <br/>
UNhappy, that&#39;s not the path toward her trusting that you care about her <br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
IF school really is as bad as you think, then at some point she will want to <br/>
come home.  <br/>
<br/>
IF you let her stay in school because she wants to, and she knows she can <br/>
come home when she wants to, then she&#39;ll start developing the kind of trust <br/>
in you you will need to get through teen years.<br/>
<br/>
If you MAKE her come home and she&#39;s resentful, you&#39;ll have started storing up <br/>
the kinds of antagonism  you don&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
Choice is important.  I always feel sorry for kids who are being homeschooled <br/>
against their will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735988885">Hi  Amy,<br/>
I also have a 5dd,  she also went to preschool for 2 years and other types of &#39;school&#39;.  She was pretty convinced that she wanted to go to kindergarten,  hearing how excited everyone else was and all.   <br/>
 <br/>
But,  basically when she found out that we could do painting and crafts and she could see her friends still and have more time to do other things-- she chose home.<br/>
 <br/>
Have you talked with her just saying,  we can do this or that here?   We actually have more time to see your friends staying home.  Because you don&#39;t have to be rushing around in the out of school hours.  You can just have fun,  (and then she&#39;ll realize that all her life can be fun!)<br/>
 <br/>
My daughter is just now realizing that she doesn&#39;t want to go to Sunday school either,  because she said to me yesterday,  &quot;you know what Mom,  I can do my crafts here and the friends I see there we see at our house too&quot;.  So she figured that out all on her own.  <br/>
 <br/>
I understand your hesitantcy because we feel as parents we have to know exactly how to steer our children all the time,   what&#39;s great about unschooling is that they do the steering ,    I have a feeling if you just let her decide what she wants to do with no steering from you,  she&#39;ll chose you/home.   Especially if she is able to do all the fun things with you at home,   now if I were to go on vendetas of cleaning or &#39;working&#39; around the house all the time, my kids would chose school because then I wouldn&#39;t be &#39;there&#39; for them.      We just have to chose to live life with them and I believe that that is all they want!<br/>
 <br/>
Good Luck and Take Care,<br/>

&gt; Why can&#39;t you just plan MUCH cooler things every day than she would <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; school? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I work part time at home, so I can&#39;t always spend all day doing what <br/>
she wants.  I do involve her in housework, and she watches me work <br/>
(making batiks, sewing, artwork), and we do always get out once a day <br/>
for something she wants to do, but it must not be enough because she <br/>
still wants to go to school.  <br/>
<br/>
My plan was to find another homeschooling family we like and have the <br/>
kids switch afternoons at eachother&#39;s house, but I can&#39;t find <br/>
homeschoolers who like to play that much, and school friends are too <br/>
busy with their packed schedules to come over much.  Her friends at <br/>
school now live 30 mins away, so we wouldn&#39;t see them often.  If she <br/>
wasn&#39;t an only child, I don&#39;t think she would need friends so badly, <br/>
but she is and she does.<br/>
<br/>
That brings up another concern.  I feel like I&#39;ve always made it too <br/>
big a deal that we make lots of friends.  Now I&#39;m starting to wonder <br/>
if I put too much an emphasis on it.  She seems to want to impress <br/>
other kids and make them like her.  Now I&#39;m starting to encourage her <br/>
to do what she wants, instead of always trying to please her friends, <br/>
or her parents.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the suggestions and reminders that I need to trust <br/>
what she wants.  I expect that next year when she&#39;s at school the <br/>
full day and there&#39;s a little more pressure to do things she might <br/>
not want to do, she&#39;ll want to stay home.  If she doesn&#39;t, I guess I <br/>
can live with that too. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying hard to back off.  She&#39;s giving me signs that she&#39;s ready <br/>
for a little independence, so maybe that&#39;s what this school thing&#39;s <br/>
all about. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268218848">Exactly,   you, the parent, have to make a conscious effort to make those social events happen; driving them, making phone calls.  All of it depends on if that&#39;s what the child wants.  Maybe they don&#39;t want that much social interaction,  and that&#39;s OK too.<br/>
