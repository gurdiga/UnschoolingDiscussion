<div><font size="2">It has been good to listen to this discussion, as we tend to 
be late-ies ourselves.&nbsp; Can be a little isolating, however living this way, 
especially when one lives next-door to the modern ideal of 
two-parents-two-jobs-two-kids-two-cars-two-full-time-nursery-and-school, Mr 
&amp; Mrs Smug &lt;g&gt;&nbsp; But I have a problem that I nurse dd2 to sleep 
and most of the time dd1 comes to bed, too, clicking, humming, slurping drinks, 
coughing...&nbsp; If she had her own bed I wouldn&#39;t mind, like last night she 
was doing her own thing until she was dog-tired at 10pm, so then she went to 
bed.&nbsp; But she wakes fairly early, so she gets really tired.&nbsp; If she 
gets to bed around 8pm she&#39;s ok, but after that she doesn&#39;t want to go.&nbsp; 
Ah, well, it will all work out in the end :-)</font></div>
