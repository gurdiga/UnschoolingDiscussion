explaining to me how she thought that the creation story in the bible<br/>
could include scientific explanations of evolution if you considered that<br/>
each *day* wasn&#39;t literally the 24 hours we call a day...that it somehow<br/>
encompassed large chunks of time where things on earth naturally evolved<br/>

I&#39;m not so certain. I have read some interesting<br/>
science about some research and typing of DNA back to<br/>
a &quot;Mitochondrial Eve.&quot; I&#39;ll have to look for the book<br/>
again, if you&#39;re interested. It&#39;s an interesting<br/>
theory, and to me entirely possible that current<br/>
generations of mankind truly be descendent from one<br/>
man and one woman. And if you recall, I did say that<br/>
don&#39;t agree with all of evolution. Again, both are<br/>
theories. I could very well be wrong with my beliefs<br/>
and opinions. I&#39;ll know one way or another someday, so<br/>
I don&#39;t worry too much about it right now LOL! <br/>

==========<br/>
<br/>
Because to Bible literalists, who worship the book first and the characters <br/>
later, if one thing isn&#39;t literally true, then something (or all) else might <br/>
not be literally true either.  If the world wasn&#39;t created in six days, Jesus <br/>
might not be coming back any day now.<br/>
<br/>
Those literalists who aren&#39;t concerned about literal 24 hour days quote this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the <br/>
Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.&quot;  (2 Peter 3:8)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I did say that don&#39;t agree with all of evolution. Again, both are<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
One is a theory.  One is either a story in a book, or the literal word of <br/>
God. Not a theory, either way.<br/>
<br/>
One  has some evidence.  One is either a story in a book or the literal word <br/>
of God with no other evidence.<br/>
<br/>
Statements like &quot;they&#39;re both equally valid&quot; or &quot;science is just another <br/>
religion&quot; are both statement made by people who want to create a false equality <br/>
between direct observation and faith.  They&#39;re not comparable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I think there&#39;s a big misunderstanding of the meaning of theory too. People think it&#39;s akin to a hunch or maybe a hypothesis. But a scientific theory like evolution is made on a mountain of evolution. The theory came after observing the evidence availible, it&#39;s not something someone dreamed up and then science had to dig for proof for it. Part of the argument against counts on people who don&#39;t understand how theories work. Nevermind that we can see evolution around us all the time. Would there really be superbugs immune to new anti biotics or insects who developed pesticide resistence without evolution?<br/>
<br/>
  The debate on evolution seems to count on people having a poor understanding of science.<br/>
<br/>
  National geographic has a good basic article on evolution this month.<br/>
