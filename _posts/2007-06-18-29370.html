<div id="ygrps-yiv-775299667">The internet is amazing! I put in etymology of zucchini and found this:<br/>
<br/>
History and etymology<br/>
Zucchini, like all summer squash, has its ancestry in the Americas. But <br/>
while most summer squash--including the closely related cocozelle and <br/>
marrow--were introduced to Europe during the time of European colonization <br/>
of the Americas, zucchini is European in origin, the result of spontaneously <br/>
occurring mutations (also called sports). In all probability, this occurred <br/>
in the very late 19th century, probably near Milan (early varieties usually <br/>
included the names of cities in the area in the name). Courgette comes from <br/>
the French name of the fruit, with the same spelling. It is a diminutive of <br/>
courge, meaning squash. While &quot;zucca&quot; is the Italian word for squash, and <br/>
the feminine diminutive plural &quot;zucchine&quot; is preferred in most areas of <br/>
Italy, the male diminutive plural &quot;zucchini&quot; is used in other areas of <br/>
Italy, Australia, and the United States. The first records of zucchini in <br/>
the United States date to the early 1920s. It was almost certainly brought <br/>
over by Italian immigrants, and probably got its start in California.<br/>

It might be fun for him if you bring up a few stories just for fun, too.<br/>
<br/>
I was mid-teens before I realized that &quot;trailer&quot; meant something that  <br/>
trails behind.  Sometimes the meaning of a word is right there but we  <br/>
hear the word so  much we don&#39;t think of it.  Outhouse.  Carport.<br/>
<br/>
With google you can put in any word and then the word &quot;etymology&quot; and  <br/>
get some history of the word, or go to etymonline.com and mess around  <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Often a dictionary will have the word history in a kind of code at  <br/>
the end of the word, if you&#39;re near dictionaries but not the  <br/>
internet.  You&#39;ll mostly need to figure out that dictionary&#39;s  <br/>
abbreviations for older languages, like some will say L for Latin but  <br/>
there might be LL (late Latin) and VL (vulgar latin, meaning everyday  <br/>
rather than nasty; everyday as opposed to church-Latin), and some  <br/>
have AS for Anglo Saxon (some older dictionaries) instead of the more  <br/>
recently common OE (Old English).   Gmc means Germanic, probably  <br/>
(meaning not from German, but from the same parent language as German).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028013218">Thank you.  He loves stories.  He understands meanings, just not why a car is called car, for example.  It is very cool to see how he embraces a word he doesn&#39;t know.  I&#39;m just happy with knowing the definition, but he wants to know everything he can about it.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never looked it up, but my first guess would be it&#39;s short for  <br/>
&quot;carriage.&quot;<br/>
Or related to &quot;cart&quot; (which might also be related to carriage/carry).<br/>
<br/>
If the guess is wrong, it&#39;s still fun to try to figure it out.<br/>
