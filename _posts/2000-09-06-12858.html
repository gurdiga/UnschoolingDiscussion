<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853866634">If you and I don&#39;t agree that&#39;s really ok with <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;me.  I don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s approval of my belief system.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bravo Dawn!  (Applause!! Cheering  Whistling)  It&#39;s nice to see someone unapologetic about their beliefs, while still maintaining maturity and a non-confrontational attitude.  I hope that I come off as well as that in how I declare myself, as I feel the same what as you about my beliefs.<br/>
