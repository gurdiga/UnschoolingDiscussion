<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204109100">I had Granny and Grandpa Marvin and the others were Granny Toots (I don&#39;t<br/>
have a clue) and Grandaddy.<br/>
<br/>
The worst I ever heard was my cousins&#39; name for their great<br/>
grandmother.....Big Mama.   Eeeeek!<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to being Granny.  I think because I have such wonderful<br/>
memories of being at my Granny&#39;s as a kid.  She is still my hero and at 86<br/>
still has a garden and cares for several acres.  She is a self-taught artist<br/>
who supports herself by giving painting lessons.  She has encouraged me<br/>
throughout my parenting career.<br/>
<br/>
For Christmas, I got her a Bonsai Potato, kind of like a Pet Rock (zen<br/>
without the wait, you know).  Everybody stared like I gave her orange house<br/>
paint.  But Granny and I laughed and giggled over the manual that came with<br/>
it all day.  I love her to death.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my granddaughter was born, her parents let all the grandparents (more<br/>
than 4 because of steps) choose what they wanted to be called.  My maternal<br/>
grandmother had been called Granna, because my oldest cousin hadn&#39;t been<br/>
able to say grandma.  I decided to go with that.  When Skye was first<br/>
learning to talk, she called me Bumma.  I wasn&#39;t exactly crazy about that,<br/>
but she grew out of it.  &lt;g&gt;  The second one is talking now, and the closest<br/>
he can come is Yah-yah.  I like that.  And my sister just told me that it&#39;s<br/>
actually Greek for grandma.<br/>
<br/>
My husband (the step-grandpa) chose Poppy, which is what he called his dad.<br/>
His parents are Grandma Rain (Irene) and Grandpa Silly (He *is* silly, at<br/>
least around the kids.)  My ex chose to be called Grandpappy, but Skye<br/>
couldn&#39;t say that and shortened it to Happy.  Happy he still is, which is<br/>
quite ironic.  A less happy man I&#39;ve yet to know.  &lt;g&gt;  Her other bio<br/>
grandma is just Trish, and my ex mil (her great grandma) was Grandma Down<br/>
the Road for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
My German dad had already died by the time I had kids, but my mother (who<br/>
wasn&#39;t German) agreed to be called Oma to keep the German tradition going.<br/>
(Although it actually wasn&#39;t a tradition in my family.  My grandparents were<br/>
called Mutti and Vati, which are the German words for Mommy and Daddy, by<br/>
almost everyone who knew them well.  So did we, though I never knew why.)<br/>

<br/>
My stepmother wanted to be called gramma D (her name is Deborah), bu my<br/>
oldest shortened it to Debba D.  Then when my youngest came along it<br/>
became just Deborah.  I thought for years that they were calling her<br/>
that because it is her name, that&#39;s what other people call her, and<br/>
while it was THEY thought that everyone had a Deborah!  They understand,<br/>
just a few weeks ago actually, that that is her name - not something we<br/>
call her because she is grandma.  So occasionally now they call her<br/>
Debba D.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was always just plain ole gramma.  Then when my niece starting<br/>
talking she changed it to By-ya.  My sister and my mom were at a family<br/>
reunion, in a room crowded with relatives and Emily who was 1 1/2 at the<br/>
time, was yelling By-ya.  No one knew what she wanted until she walked<br/>
up to my mom and grabbed her, making it very clear that her new name was<br/>
By-ya.  Now when I&#39;m trying to explain to my kids who I was talking to<br/>
on the phone I just say By-ya and they know.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s mother is Grandma Jean - no nicknames for her!<br/>

My dd, her first grandchild, called my dh&#39;s mom &quot;Gram Gram,&quot; which my<br/>
children have since dropped but which persists among the cousins.  The usual<br/>
slurring of &quot;Grandma&quot; into &quot;Gramma&quot; is now my children&#39;s preference, but<br/>
they write &quot;Grandma.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My neice called my dad &quot;Poppa,&quot; and my other neice called him &quot;Poppo.&quot;<br/>
Neither girl knew a dad of her own, so I think their moms encouraged this.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; I just this morning got an email from my older daughter&#39;s first<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; My maternal<br/>
grandmother had been called Granna, because my oldest cousin hadn&#39;t been<br/>
able to say grandma. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My Mamaw complained her WHOLE LIFE (well, much of MY whole life) that she had <br/>
wanted to be called &quot;grandmommy&quot; but I couldn&#39;t say it and so she ended up <br/>
with all the grandkids calling her &quot;mamaw&quot; which she hated.   I&#39;ve only <br/>
started feeling the least bit guilty now that there&#39;s a possibility that <br/>
someone might call me something I don&#39;t much like. &lt;g&gt;   At the time, I <br/>
thought names were just part of people like their noses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077499507"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Does anybody have any sweet grandparent names?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 97 yo grandmother is called Maw (rhymes with paw) by everyone she knows.  <br/>
Her mother was Mamaw.  I never knew my grandfather on that side.<br/>
<br/>
My other grandmother was Gramma, until we became teens, and then we shortened <br/>
it to Gram, as Chicago teens are prone to do.  My grandfather was called <br/>
Grandpa or Gramps.  He was a character so we could get away with a lot.<br/>
<br/>
My sons called my mother Gram from the start.  I want to be called Gramma <br/>
first, and they can shorten it later if they like.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
My dad is called Poppy by my sons, but the other g&#39;children call him Grandpa. <br/>
 His wife is Memaw (long e) which is a country thing that has bad <br/>
connotations for me, but it&#39;s what she wanted.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh&#39;s parents are Grammaw and Grandpa Tucker to my kids.  Simply Grammaw and <br/>
Grandpa to their other g&#39;children.  <br/>
<br/>
Grammaw (as in &quot;...got run over by a reindeer&quot;) is just the southern version <br/>
of Gramma (said fast and clipped).  But I refuse to be called Grammaw, Nana, <br/>
Nanny, Mimi, Granny or any other of the cutesy southern variations.  OTOH, I <br/>
couldn&#39;t stand for my kids to call me Mommy, which I relate to Chicago, but <br/>
was quite happy with Mama, which I relate to the South.<br/>

dh&#39;s generally bland father and said &quot;now you&#39;re GREAT Grandpa.  The kids can <br/>
just call you G.G.&quot;  He lit up like a Christmas tree like I was paying him a <br/>
great compliment and now all the little kids call him G.G. and he just beams <br/>
about it!<br/>
