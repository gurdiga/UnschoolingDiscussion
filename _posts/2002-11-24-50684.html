 </span></blockquote>I cannot blame you for that.  Yikes, double yikes.  Tomorrow or next week can <br/>
be the day.  When you can put more weight on the leg.  When you are feeling <br/>
more confident.<br/>
<br/>
Also, are you trying to use the railing or crutches?  I&#39;m tall and found that <br/>
using railing was messing with my confidence on stairs.  Once I allowed <br/>
myself (and my physical therapist, who was an itty bitty thing, allowed me) <br/>
to use both crutches, I felt much better.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight the spirit moved me and I climbed the stairs while the kids were in <br/>
the tub.  Mark was playing his civil war game in the office and I just popped <br/>
up kind of quietly, strange for this old house.  Spooked everyone out.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I sat in the rocking chair and couldn&#39;t get out.  Didn&#39;t think of that.  <br/>
But it was very much worth it to read stories to my cherubs in the usual <br/>
place.  Going up was a workout, going down was a big scare.  But I made it <br/>
and felt so smug about it that once everyone went to sleep and I had been <br/>
down the little five steps to the bathroom, I fell coming up those rinky dink <br/>
stairs that I have been doing daily for three weeks!  Knocked the cast, lost <br/>
a crutch, made a lot of noise that no one heard.  What an idiot.  I was fine.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite idiot on crutches story - sharing too much tonight - comes from <br/>
last week.  The nanny, my visiting friend and the three kids under four went <br/>
to the zoo.  It was cold and rainy - the zoo has a great indoor play zoo <br/>
where the kids can dress like animals, pretend to be vets, jump with the <br/>
lemurs, etc.  One of my cats was staring out the back door window as I was <br/>
about to sponge bathe.  I wanted to know what he was looking at, so I looked <br/>
too.  I noticed the cover of the sandbox was off in one spot, so out I went <br/>
to fix that.   Did my balancing move - standing on the right leg, raising the <br/>
casted left leg up in the air for a smooth slow dip down to the floor with my <br/>
right arm.  I think it&#39;s a modified arabesque in ballet, a tilted flamingo <br/>
pose in yoga.  Left hand was holding both crutches for support until one <br/>
fell.  So there I am, in the rain, one crutch down, covering a sandbox that <br/>
is almost completely empty and wondering how the hell I&#39;m going to get back <br/>
inside.  Did I mention I was in my nightgown?  And tennis shoe, thankfully.  <br/>
Anyway, I managed to get the crutch and hop back inside - just repeat the <br/>
visual of me getting the crutch, left leg in the air, right arm on the floor. <br/>
 And smile.<br/>
<br/>
So, a little fear goes a long way and isn&#39;t such a bad thing.  My affirmation <br/>
after that stunt was &quot;I will accept my limitations.&quot;  That affirmation lasted <br/>
one day.  Maybe tomorrow I&#39;ll try to finish painting the kitchen???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716200218">Too funny  Elizabeth,   its great you can be humorous about this all,  I think I would be in a psych ward about now!!<br/>
 <br/>
I hope your meaning to be humorous about it and its not me being warped or something?     Like we&#39;ve said before it is so hard to read emotion on the computer!<br/>
 <br/>
I think the vision of you, outside in your nightgown is great!<br/>
 <br/>
Please don&#39;t stop sharing,  oh and your zoo sounds awesome, for fun!<br/>
 <br/>
Take it easy and I know that&#39;s easy for me to say, I can walk.<br/>

Crutches.  going up won&#39;t be scary, because I would fall forward.  Going down <br/>
WILL be scary, because I would fall forward.  So maybe up with crutches and <br/>
down like a toddler.  But not today.</div>

I think you could mount a paintroller into the end of the crutch if you have <br/>
aluminum tubing crutches and you take off the rubber tip.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes!  I DO think it&#39;s funny.  I was laughing out there in the rain in my <br/>
nightgown, talking to myself because I knew there was no way my 72 year old <br/>
neighbor would hear me through her stucco walls.  And then I just figured I&#39;d <br/>
go slowly and if I fell it wouldn&#39;t be so far to fall or so hard.  Plus, I <br/>
knew I could get up again after the fall that broke my ankle.  So, before <br/>
doing my arabesque again, I had a giggling fit over the image of me dragging <br/>
myself in on my ass in my nightgown and then bumping back up the stairs to <br/>
get good fitting to stand up again.  That was my plan B and it was funnier <br/>
than my plan A.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer my moments of finding humor in my predicaments over my moments of <br/>
being angry and pitiful.  <br/>
<br/>
And the Brookfield Zoo here is marvelous.  The kids came home with their <br/>
faces painted, told me stories of making habitats for the snakes and how they <br/>
squirted the plants with water.  We got more often in the winter because of <br/>
the play zoo...<br/>

I could also maybe attach a rake to one end and get some of my leaves taken <br/>
care of...<br/>
