<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706528993">&lt;&lt;the mind is a part of the whole and influences the whole&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I couldn&#39;t agree more.  I just meant that sometimes the initial<br/>
mitigating factor is psychological and sometimes it is physical, but yes,<br/>
the two very definitely play together.<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago, I tore my anterior cruciate ligament in my knee and<br/>
required surgery because it kept making me fall.  The doctor told me I would<br/>
walk out of the hospital.  When I woke up after the surgery, I panicked when<br/>
I was unable to move my leg at all.  I was reassured by the nurse that this<br/>
was normal and it took 2 weeks to learn how to move my leg by using my thigh<br/>
muscles differently.  I felt myself to be in tremendous pain and thoroughly<br/>
enjoyed all narcotics given to me.<br/>
<br/>
About 2 years after that, I tore the ligament again.  This time it required<br/>
surgery on both knees (on the left to repair the damage and on the right to<br/>
scavenge spare parts).  I knew what to expect.  I was able to move both legs<br/>
within hours of the surgery and took absolutely zero pain medication.<br/>
<br/>
In both cases, the root cause was physical but the mental made all the<br/>
difference in my perception of the event how I handled it.<br/>
