&lt;&lt; I know some will disagree, but I couldn&#39;t live with myself unless I spoke<br/>
up: This was the Worst Movie Ever. It was so boring that Craig and I fast<br/>
forwarded, trying to find anything slightly titillating. &gt;&gt;  (&gt; 1999: Eyes <br/>
Wide Shut)<br/>
<br/>
I SO agree.  I was stunned that they had released it.  That they had even <br/>
finished editing it, it was so lame.<br/>
<br/>
The real question was which Tom Cruise movies Holly might like.  She wouldn&#39;t <br/>
like that one. &lt;g&gt;  Nor Mission Impossible.  <br/>
<br/>
Since Keith loves bombs and westerns and Holly loves musicals and fantasies, <br/>
what they watch together are things like Paint Your Wagon. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  Oh my gosh...me too!<br/>
  That was the WORST movie I&#39;ve ever seen period.  I kept watching it wondering when it was going to &quot;pick up&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
  I was also surprised at the &quot;soft porn&quot; part of it (part?  geez thats all there was :o)).  I mean, if they&#39;re gonna do porn stuff, they might as well just call it what it is and get the right producers for it.  It might have turned out better. (Gag)<br/>
