<div id="ygrps-yiv-347217241">Hi,<br/>
  I work at Toys R Us and was straightening the baby toy aisle the other <br/>
night.  There were several boxes of this musical light-up gizmo and one box <br/>
that was slightly different.  Same toy, older packaging.  I read the virtues <br/>
of this toy, and the old box listed FUN!  On the new boxes there was no such <br/>
word.  It was replaced by EDUCATIONAL!<br/>
