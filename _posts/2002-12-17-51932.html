<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259702653">I think the reason newbies sometimes get offended is that they&#39;ll cheerily <br/>
try to introduce themselves by recounting some ordinary part of their day or <br/>
ask some question and then be caught completely off-guard by what the <br/>
veterans see as antithetical to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, a mom will proudly say that her kid has total choice of  TV in <br/>
the one hour of TV he&#39;s allowed a day.  She asks if others have found it&#39;s <br/>
better to allow this TV in the morning, or before bedtime. Then she&#39;s <br/>
shocked when someone asks why she limits TV at all.  And someone else <br/>
suggests she dispense with bedtime! She wasn&#39;t expecting questions along <br/>
those lines. No one has ever confronted her with the notion that it&#39;s <br/>
counterproductive to limit TV.  She gets defensive and feels like she&#39;s <br/>
being attacked. She might end up unsubbing. Meanwhile, though, a lot of <br/>
newbie lurkers out there are having their eyes opened: &quot;You mean, you DON&#39;T <br/>
have to limit TV?&quot; &quot;Is there a better way to make sure I get enough sleep <br/>
and the kids aren&#39;t harangued into going to bed every night?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In one of my earliest posts to a similar list many moons ago, I boasted that <br/>
my schooled kids and I were looking forward to &quot;unschooling&quot; over summer <br/>
vacation. I listed the exciting projects and plans I had plotted out.  I&#39;m <br/>
sure you can all imagine the responses (&quot;How do YOU know they want to fly <br/>
kites and then follow up with a visit to the space museum?&quot; &quot;What if they <br/>
don&#39;t want to go?&quot; &quot;If it&#39;s a vacation it&#39;s not unschooling,&quot; etc.). I was <br/>
quite taken aback. But it did open my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Another early question I had: &quot;if you let them do what they want all day, <br/>
how do you keep them from spending hours just noodling around on the <br/>
computer?&quot; People very patiently opened my eyes to the fact that this might <br/>
not be such a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, my mind has been stretched. I see learning in so many parts of my <br/>
kids&#39; day that I once would have regarded as &quot;wasted time.&quot;  I have <br/>
discovered the opportunity for learning that exists every moment (waiting in <br/>
the dentist&#39;s office this morning, I was asked to explain a comic strip <br/>
featuring Trent Lott and the Ku Klux Klan to my 10yo). I have learned to <br/>
look at video games with a new understanding of the problem-solving skills, <br/>
the reading and the concentration.  I have learned not to freak out over <br/>
curse words and jokes that pop up in movies most people would think were too <br/>
old for my 5 and 10yo ds. (Exhibit One: &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movies, which the <br/>
whole family loves, though a lot of things have to be explained and other <br/>
things go swooshing, thankfully, over the kids&#39; heads. THe other night I had <br/>
to explain the word &quot;shit&quot; to my 5 yo.) I try to say yes to requests and I <br/>
try to be as gracious as possible about it. I do NOT feel guilty about <br/>
pursuing my own interests!<br/>
<br/>
These are all things I have learned here. It took a lot of time. I am still <br/>
learning. The big debates are most illuminating of all, and I thank Joyce, <br/>
Sandra, Helen, Mary, et al. for having the patience to explain a new way of <br/>
looking at things over and over again. I don&#39;t agree with everything. (After <br/>
two kids, a bad back, one bad co-sleeper and one good solo sleeper, I am NOT <br/>
into the family bed!) But I am open to hearing about everything. I do love <br/>
this list. I hope people choose to stick around, but if they don&#39;t, I&#39;ve <br/>
thankful to them anyway because I&#39;ve learned during their time here.<br/>
