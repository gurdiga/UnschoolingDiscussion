And you were - very nicely done.  Writers like her, when I&#39;m in the right<br/>
mind set, give me a chuckle.  While trying to make a point of how terrible<br/>
they think something is they end up making themselves look bad and so in the<br/>
process, imo, make the other side look like something worth finding out more<br/>
about.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186505929">I was on an attachment parenting yahoo group with the author when our kids were little...our kids are only six months apart in age.  I was always fascinated by what Ben & Shira were doing because it usually meant Megan would be doing it soon!  I think she dropped off the list (either no mail or just faded away) when the kids were around four.  I think she went the &quot;Well Trained Mind&quot; route of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;d make an amazing unschooling family if they changed their perspective. <br/>

She isn&#39;t the first person I&#39;ve come across who has met one or more unschooling families that have turned them off unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842660994">The funny thing is, there are &quot;out of control&quot; (or bratty or whatever <br/>
you want to call it) kids whose parents use curriculum on them, too. <br/>
Nobody blames the curriculum for wild or difficult behavior. I think <br/>
what really happens is that there are kids who are intense or explosive <br/>
or more prone to impulsive behaviors, etc., out there in all groups. But <br/>
when we (unschoolers) have kids like that, we aren&#39;t seen as &quot;doing <br/>
something about it,&quot; because we don&#39;t shame and punish - especially <br/>
because we don&#39;t shame and punish right then and there in front of <br/>
everybody, like other parents do. I&#39;ve had parents tell me, &quot;If you just <br/>
let that go, it will only get worse.&quot; They assume that I&#39;m just letting <br/>
things go because they don&#39;t see my way of responding - which is <br/>
certainly not going to be to loudly shame my child or punishing her.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand,I also think there are a lot of people who come to <br/>
unschooling and don&#39;t want to shame and punish, but don&#39;t know what else <br/>
to do and their kids are not necessarily getting the kind of counseling <br/>
and guidance and parental supervision and intervention that they need.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, erring on the side of not punishing and shaming seems to <br/>
work out better, in the long run, but there are some unschooled kids <br/>
whose behavior gets in the way of them achieving current happiness or <br/>
who impose enough difficulties on other people so that others don&#39;t want <br/>
to be around them. Sometimes parents are ignoring problems in the name <br/>
of not punishing or shaming and that&#39;s not the idea response, either.<br/>

A parent who doesn&#39;t have the natural instinct or talent or skill to  <br/>
advise persuasively might have been ineffectual with punishments too,  <br/>
I think.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a hard thing for me, thinking that Howard Gardner is really on to  <br/>
something about interpersonal intelligence, and then thinking  <br/>
unschooling takes a lot of interpersonal intelligence and then  <br/>
realizing some kids don&#39;t have it because their parents don&#39;t have it  <br/>
and....   unschooling isn&#39;t going to work as well for them as for some  <br/>
others.  BUT... if the parents are that way, and the kids are that  <br/>
way, school might easily be even more baffling for them than  <br/>
unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I remember after one of the Live and Learn conferences there in  <br/>
the middle of them, a mom complaining on a list afterwards that it was  <br/>
JUST LIKE SCHOOL, because some of the girls were friends from the year  <br/>
before and her daughter felt there were cliques she wasn&#39;t part of.<br/>
<br/>
I think what&#39;s just like school is expecting the kids to be nice to  <br/>
all the other kids who are unschooled and at a conference, as though  <br/>
they&#39;re in the same school and &quot;have to&quot; be nice.   Mostly the kids  <br/>
ARE nice, but if mothers come to me and say &quot;Make your kids be  <br/>
friendly with everyone equally, that&#39;s more like the conditions of an  <br/>
institution.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is perfect, but some things are better than they would be if  <br/>
we weren&#39;t at least headed in the direction of peace and light and  <br/>
learning and all that good stuff.<br/>

<br/>
I agree that there out of control children who are schooled in all possible<br/>
ways.  Likely, there are more in public school than anywhere else because<br/>
it&#39;s the easiest path to follow and those parents who don&#39;t who aren&#39;t as<br/>
involved usually end up there by default.  There are fewer Christian<br/>
homeschooled kids like that because often the parent is very controlling and<br/>
punishes it out of them.  But sometimes it&#39;s a personality difference in the<br/>
mom that causes this and it has nothing to do with how the child is<br/>
schooled.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend, also a homeschooler (not unschooler), who has a real<br/>
difficulty with focusing on more than one thing at a time.  If she is<br/>
chatting with me, she can&#39;t seem to hear her kids.  Reminds me more of a<br/>
man&#39;s personality.  In my experience, men have a harder time multi-tasking.<br/>
<br/>
But no matter the cause, I can&#39;t stand being around parents who don&#39;t DO<br/>
anything about it.  I&#39;m not talking about shaming or blaming though.  It<br/>
makes me crazy to go to play groups/home school groups or to even visit in<br/>
someone&#39;s home when they are more concerned with their own socialization (or<br/>
just oblivious to their child&#39;s needs) than helping their child navigate<br/>
through his/her own social world.  <br/>
<br/>
This same friend seems unable to hear anything else except what is right in<br/>
front of her. (I learned to interrupt her and point out that her child<br/>
wanted or needed her) She doesn&#39;t hear her child ask politely the first six<br/>
times but she hears him when he finally pitches a fit and makes sure he&#39;s<br/>
the biggest loudest thing around so she&#39;ll see him.  And then he gets in<br/>
trouble.  L<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it play out differently in another family too.  This family was<br/>
not the punitive type of family that the first was but the mom never<br/>
realized how much her child disrupted the group because she seemed to only<br/>
be focusing on her own socialization and oblivious to the chaos that<br/>
followed in her son&#39;s wake.  It really seemed like she just didn&#39;t see it.<br/>
If someone pointed it out, she&#39;d take notice and help her child but no one<br/>
wants to continually point out where someone else is failing.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s even more important to be present with those children who are<br/>
prone to be intense or explosive.   <br/>
<br/>
One other thing that comes to play in this is I think, the fact that<br/>
homeschoolers tend to spend large blocks of time with each other and get to<br/>
see the details of each other&#39;s lives more than families whose kids go to<br/>
school. And unschooled families probably spend even more time in each<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The absolute most difficult kids in all the homeschool events and park <br/>
days and other activities I&#39;ve been involved with, over the years, have <br/>
been schooled-at-home heavy-handed Christian homeschooled kids who were <br/>
all sweetness and light in front of their parents and who were sneaky <br/>
and mean away from them. There was one family - the other kids called <br/>
them &quot;the violent _____ kids.&quot; Their reaction to anything not going <br/>
their way was to lash out and hurt the other kids - this was a large <br/>
family and most of the kids, but not all, were like this. The mother <br/>
would wash their mouths out with soap, spank them, make them sit next to <br/>
her for X minutes before they could go play again, etc. I remember how <br/>
she once went on and on about somebody else&#39;s kid using some &quot;bad <br/>
language&quot; and yet her kids were THE most cussing kids that my kids had <br/>
ever known.<br/>
<br/>
So - maybe there are fewer, but i&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true and even if it <br/>
is, they add &quot;sneaky&quot; (dishonest, untrustworthy) to their list of <br/>
problem behaviors which at least the so-called &quot;out of control&quot; <br/>
unschoolers don&#39;t have.<br/>

I agree and have experienced the same thing.  I didn&#39;t actually mean that<br/>
the &quot;punishing it out of them&quot; worked, but in front of their parents in a<br/>
group setting they tended to act nicely and not run around out of control.<br/>
One of the families of which I spoke has a 20 year old daughter who now has<br/>
three babies.none planed.  When she was finally old enough o break loose,<br/>
she did it in a big way without have had the ability to practice being<br/>
responsible with small decisions first.  I&#39;m rushing, which is why I don&#39;t<br/>
post as often as I&#39;d like.  I hope it&#39;s clear what I meant.  They act<br/>
politely in front on their parents and they are pleasant to be around in a<br/>
group with the parents looking on.  It says nothing about what they do<br/>
behind their backs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996413559">This is my first post on this list -though I have been reading <br/>
Unschooling Discussion for a few years, and unschoolingbasics, among others.<br/>
<br/>
We have experienced difficulty ourselves with a couple of the <br/>
unschooling families in our area in the past- some hitting and very loud <br/>
and long rages from an older child, which seemed unusual. They were not <br/>
radically unschooling, at least at that point.  Some unschooled kids are <br/>
given freedom perhaps to learn to read, etc in their own time, but are <br/>
not always treated respectfully in my observation - &quot;discipline&quot; seeming <br/>
fairly traditional.   My kids used to fight often before I started to <br/>
read radical unschooling lists and apply those principles, though I said <br/>
I was unschooling for years before that. It took a long time for my kids <br/>
to behave differently at home after I began to shift my parenting.<br/>
<br/>
At times I hear comments about the young people at our learning center <br/>
from some of the parents who parent traditionally and have kids with <br/>
quiet temperaments about some of the teen unschoolers- there are a <br/>
handful of them. To me they seem considerate and interested and excited <br/>
about life- but some of the parents object to their tendency to be very <br/>
physical and outspoken and silly. Yes, they could use some reminders <br/>
about what might be appropriate in the space or at that time, but there <br/>
is a tone of judgment in these comments and a lack of understanding of <br/>
their playfulness, too. I wonder sometimes if these parents just don&#39;t <br/>
know how to communicate with young people who are accustomed to having <br/>
their opinions and needs considered, and who would most likely respond <br/>
to a well-worded request. I have relationships with these kids and an <br/>
instance of behavior doesn&#39;t determine my whole picture of them, as it <br/>
might to a casual observer.  They will always consider my requests quite <br/>
respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
Also- I wonder - is it really important to all unschooling families at <br/>
all times to appear to be well behaved? It is important to me that my <br/>
kids have the kinds of experiences they want to have with people, and I <br/>
will offer them information that will help them make those choices. But <br/>
sometimes other things are more important than what people think. For <br/>
instance - my son loves to jump over and on objects such as benches, <br/>
walls, etc in public spaces. I will sometimes mention that perhaps a <br/>
certain wall or object may be owned by someone who may not appreciate it <br/>
being used in that way - but mostly he chooses to jump anyway as at that <br/>
moment what that hypothetical person MIGHT think is less important than <br/>
the fun of jumping-  he can jump quite high, being over 6 feet tall. No <br/>
one has expressed any concerns, and if they did, I am pretty sure he <br/>
would stop immediately. This may not appear to be well-behaved to some.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - the article was mean-spirited and not at all true for the <br/>
majority of unschooling families that I know - but those are the <br/>
thoughts I had about the subject.<br/>

Clarifying what I said.  It did work in the short term.  Kids behaved well<br/>
in a group in front of their parents.  <br/>

Those kids were easy to be around in a group.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The times I went to Christian home school events with a friend of mine (one<br/>
was a six or eight week class so I saw the kids weekly for a couple of<br/>
sessions) the kids there were all very well behaved in front of their<br/>
parents.  All of them.  The ones I knew well WERE sneaky and mean behind<br/>
their parent&#39;s backs.  Their relationships with their siblings were not<br/>
sweet, to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
At the more liberal gatherings I&#39;ve gone to (none all unschoolers but some<br/>
unschoolers ) there were a couple children who were quite disruptive to the<br/>
group.  (one I know called themselves unschoolers) The moms were busy<br/>
socializing and were either oblivious to the disruption. condoned it, or<br/>
didn&#39;t know how to handle it so they opted to do nothing.  On the whole<br/>
though, the mixed group seemed to have more relaxed parents who had more<br/>
relaxed children.  <br/>
<br/>
In both groups I felt that most of the parent&#39;s put their own socialization<br/>
ahead of their children&#39;s needs.  Maybe I just see needs where other people<br/>
see normalcy.  I don&#39;t feel that its normal to let children fight when an<br/>
easy solution is right at hand if you just help them navigate socially<br/>
instead of ignoring it till someone is really unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s been my experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095391742">One of the gymnastics places here locally has classes/groups for Parkour - Zac took for a while last spring and is considering it again.  Might be something your son is interested in doing.  Might be a great way to redirect him from jumping on other&#39;s property.  I know our son who just turned 15 last week is already over 6 feet and weighs (?) to match it.  I don&#39;t know how much he weighs but he is solid - I know this from when he sits on my lap - ;)  I would redirect him from jumping on other&#39;s benches if he was so inclined - it gets the benches dirty where others want to sit plus the impact would not be good for the bench.  The other day his dad was hanging something and Zac immediately stepped up on a chair to help his dad and popped the cross braces out of the chair legs - that was with a gentle step up - a forceful jump would have probably shattered the chair.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536146820">I can remember feeling frustrated watching other mom&#39;s socialize when Simon or Linnaea clearly weren&#39;t ready for me to be away from them for those lengths of time. It took a little while for me to really enjoy the company of all the children in a play group. And I would have most of the children in the group playing with us, following the leader, jumping in the sand, running around and playing the 3 Billy Goats Gruff on the structures. It took a while to realize that I enjoyed that so much that the loss of the conversational time with other moms didn&#39;t tip the scale. It was part of realizing that what I was doing, staying home and being the full time mom, wasn&#39;t a sacrifice it was a gift. I think lots of moms get stuck in the martyred place and can&#39;t quite let go of the idea that they are doing this for others and gaining nothing for themselves. It sucks for the mom and it sucks for the kids. <br/>
<br/>
Simon and I cuddled on the couch today, and while I gentled tickled his back and looked at the moles and the birth mark there I thought about how fleeting all of this is. I got him now, but it is only now. I love getting this gift. I really love knowing that it is a gift. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve looked at families like that and wondered, and I have an idea.   <br/>
It&#39;s not yet a theory, and it&#39;s far from being a conviction, but it&#39;s  <br/>
a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
There are genetic and social factors.<br/>
If parents are short-tempered, cynical, sarcastic and for one reason  <br/>
or another wish other people would stop having bad opinions about  <br/>
those things, they might find it sooothing or exhilarating to arrange  <br/>
for a child to live in such a way that they believe being short- <br/>
temnpered, cynical and sarcastic are not going to be criticized, and  <br/>
aren&#39;t going to cause any problems.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the same character traits that left them clueless about  <br/>
how to act left them just as clueless about the cause and  <br/>
appropriateness of other people&#39;s reactions.  So they decide that the  <br/>
other people were wrong to have been negative and they pass their  <br/>
theory/conviction on to their children in word and action.<br/>
<br/>
So having dcided they&#39;re fine and others are rude and unreasonable,  <br/>
and having stated that as fact to their children, then it become  <br/>
difficult (as the scientific-community-changes discussed earlier) for  <br/>
them to see other possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, they get the idea that unschoolers accept people&#39;s  <br/>
differences, and therefor their children&#39;s differences will be  <br/>
accepted, embraced, celebrated!  Rewarded.  Praised and appreciated.   <br/>
They go first.   Then the rest of us are expected to follow.  If we  <br/>
don&#39;t, it proves we&#39;re rude and unreasonable.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a cycle.<br/>

wedding, or so I thought! The young boys were being young boys, bored in a<br/>
meaningless place, with grownups shushing them at every turn.  The groom, my<br/>
cousin, asked if I&#39;d consider medicating him (which was the parental answer<br/>
to the 4 year old&#39;s completely age-appropriate behaviors). I said, SURE! If<br/>
(1) I felt his behaviors were chemically mal-induced, (2) his dad hadn&#39;t<br/>
just died, and (3) *I* wasn&#39;t his mama.  Shame and medications didn&#39;t make<br/>
it any easier for the other guy to leave legos and walk down the aisle; I<br/>
*knew* they&#39;d not work for me and H.<br/>
So my calm demeanor and sweet whisperings were nothing to the observers and<br/>
*EVERYTHING* to the participants :D I remember we used a lot of Rescue<br/>
Remedy that day. Then again, we use a lot of RR at any big family gathering<br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand,I also think there are a lot of people who come to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschooling and don&#39;t want to shame and punish, but don&#39;t know what else<br/>
&gt; to do and their kids are not necessarily getting the kind of counseling<br/>
&gt; and guidance and parental supervision and intervention that they need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my opinion, erring on the side of not punishing and shaming seems to<br/>
&gt; work out better, in the long run, but there are some unschooled kids<br/>
&gt; whose behavior gets in the way of them achieving current happiness or<br/>
&gt; who impose enough difficulties on other people so that others don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to be around them. Sometimes parents are ignoring problems in the name<br/>
&gt; of not punishing or shaming and that&#39;s not the idea response, either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was me. I was flailing, as a human being, when unschooling came into my<br/>
life (and here&#39;s where I touch on every single subject line we&#39;ve had in the<br/>
past two weeks!!). My husband, whom I&#39;d chosen carefully as<br/>
husband=balance-for-diana and daddy potential, had just died. I knew my<br/>
emotional fragility was not an excuse to resort to knee-jerk parenting. My<br/>
acute mourning kept me from having the energy to even do that; so there was<br/>
a big ol&#39; chunk of time (6 months?) where we lived in a state of benign<br/>
neglect. Honestly. Luckily, I&#39;d convinced my best friends to keep their kids<br/>
home from preschool and the 5 of them and three of us spent lots and lots of<br/>
time together, in various combinations.<br/>
<br/>
Then I was challenged. I was awakened! I&#39;d discovered unschoolingdotcom and<br/>
I kept going back and going back and going back... I felt like there was a<br/>
gold nugget of understanding inside me, and the list (and this list by<br/>
evolution) grabbed hold of it and shook (shakes!) my bull$hit off of it.<br/>
Every bit of advice I&#39;d considered from my<br/>
mainstream-fringe-pretty-gentle-parenting friends was chucked out the<br/>
window. (i.e. I didn&#39;t *especially NEED* my kids to have bedtimes, because I<br/>
was a single mother and deserved time to myself - a true conversation I<br/>
found myself having over and over with concerned friends)<br/>
<br/>
I remembered that part of this delicious pain I was feeling in missing Mitch<br/>
was bourne of connection; without that connection there is nothing to miss.<br/>
I remembered the risk of loss is worth the relationship. Thank ye every<br/>
god!! There was a delicious pain, too, in waking up to what this connection<br/>
means -- and what it doesn&#39;t. It means I hereby give up my life&#39;s turn at<br/>
being the boss o&#39; the young ones; the job I&#39;ve longed for since I was a<br/>
young one being bossed at.<br/>
<br/>
There was no guide book, no Rules for how to be<br/>
diana-the-single-mama-who-wants-to-be-there-for-her-kids-in-the-memorable-way-her-dh-was;<br/>
instead I discovered a world of principles. Principles that work for the<br/>
crazy-flying-by-the-seat-of-her-pants-mama in the same way they work for the<br/>
family with life 180* from us! These principles helped me make the baby<br/>
steps necessary for me to see immediate benefit in my relationship (abililty<br/>
to relate) with my children.<br/>
<br/>
These baby steps, cast light on the benefit of traveling (on a super<br/>
shoestring) to Boston, from South Dakota, to an unschooling conference. I<br/>
knew Sandra would be there with Marty & I knew Robyn would be there with<br/>
Jayn -- women whose stories I related to (thank you both for being REAL<br/>
people and telling REAL stories &lt;3&lt;3) I&#39;d heard the energy with which<br/>
families returned home, inspired by the challenge and support of an<br/>
unschooling gathering.  I made my first and only curriculum purchase: 7$<br/>
cassette recording of Sandra&#39;s Parenting<br/>
Peacefully&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a>&gt;(then Peaceful<br/>
Parenting). Best lunch I ever skipped to afford it ;) I<br/>
listened all the way home (29 hours!) and most of it now lives in my head ;)<br/>
<br/>
I can only tell you another anology: When I first tried to read LotR, I<br/>
didn&#39;t get it, I couldn&#39;t *see* it... Then along came Peter Jackson, who<br/>
gave me faces and voices and buildings and objects; it&#39;s all so easy to<br/>
understand, once I&#39;ve seen it.  This conference gave me unschooling in that<br/>
way.  I just found my scrapbook with a photo of hayden + marty = BIG smiles<br/>
(almost 5 years later, there&#39;s still a very special bond there).  Live &<br/>
Learn handed me a visual and energetic understanding of the real workings of<br/>
the principles in a multitude of real families.  Across the globe!<br/>
I&#39;ve been coached on how-to coach my intense boy from the coolest of all<br/>
unschooled kids. Their words I carry in my heart, they&#39;re especially loud<br/>
when things are tough for the me: &quot;You are the Alpha AND the Omega&quot; and &quot;Let<br/>
him live to be 11&quot; -- from young men whose perspectives on the world matter<br/>
much to me. I&#39;ve gone many literal (and figurative) miles to gather the<br/>
support necessary to live a free life, not only for my children, also in my<br/>
own head; free from thoughts of ickiness and martyrdom mostly ;) I am duly<br/>
blessed, now, to live in a community where it is not only easy to be nice to<br/>
your kids, in general, there is a wonderful group of whole life unschoolers<br/>
and we gather whenever we can! (this afternoon even!!)<br/>
<br/>
As a real human being who&#39;s had some real crazy off-roading-thru-life<br/>
experiences, we (my family) would not even be close to this place of<br/>
wonderful without the loving examples of unschooling we continue to draw<br/>
into our crazy-off-roading Life :D<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s the Truth ::::ppppffffbbbbtttt:::::<br/>
~diana :) who is apparently feeling her inner Lily Tomlin today ;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s part of what Sandra is saying about parents and kids and <br/>
their interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences. Some people might <br/>
find it too difficult to know how to support kids in behaving better. <br/>
They might not be good at catching on to what&#39;s about to happen, might <br/>
miss the build up to something, might especially not get other people&#39;s <br/>
kids. So they give up punitive parenting - stop punishing and spanking <br/>
and shaming and threatening, but they may not be good at persuading, <br/>
advising and supporting. Some people need other people&#39;s needs spelled <br/>
out for them - they don&#39;t just pick up on them naturally or easily.<br/>
<br/>
  I remember, for example, one mom who absolutely insisted that kids <br/>
MUST immediately &quot;talk it out&quot; when there was a conflict. And she and <br/>
her kids had their (very nice) way of resolving conflicts - her kids <br/>
were used to it and would willingly fall into it. But my middle <br/>
daughter, Roxana, was a very very intense kid, with extremely strong <br/>
feelings. It was too hard for her to try to participate in their <br/>
particular problem-solving approach - it took too much concentration at <br/>
a time when she was concentrating on not blowing up. She needed to be <br/>
left alone - often for just a couple of minutes - to get herself under <br/>
control, to think through her own emotions.  The kids all liked each <br/>
other a lot - they&#39;re still friends 12 years later! But there was a <br/>
while that I had to be always there, not because of the kids, but <br/>
because the other kids were quick to call on their mom, and she wasn&#39;t <br/>
at all good at &quot;reading&quot; what Roxana needed. She escalated whatever <br/>
problems they were having by refusing to give Roxana even a few minutes. <br/>
They all were very very insistent that walking away, to be alone for a <br/>
few minutes, was NOT okay at all.<br/>
<br/>
When this mom pushed her, Roxana would blow up and then storm away and <br/>
be unwilling to even continue playing. So - that mom thought Roxana was <br/>
pretty awful, for a while, anyway. She thought Roxana was unwilling to <br/>
compromise, to negotiate, to problem solve, etc. I had to show her, <br/>
multiple times, how Roxana was actually quite willing and quite adept at <br/>
all that, if she was given a little space and time to compose herself.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, once this other mom got it about what Roxana needed, SHE <br/>
became very clear about it to her own kids and even to other parents. In <br/>
later years, I heard her tell other people, a few times, &quot;Some kids need <br/>
some space and time before they&#39;re ready to problem solve.&quot; She just <br/>
hadn&#39;t experienced that need in herself or her own kids and didn&#39;t pick <br/>
up on it on her own.<br/>
