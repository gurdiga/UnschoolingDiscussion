<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340366667">About the sharks, I just learned this the other day---TOO cool!<br/>
<br/>
This shark is sluggish and usually unaggressive, but like all sharks it has <br/>
the potential to be dangerous, especially considering its size. A researcher <br/>
hand-checking a pregnant female Sand Tiger was even bitten by one of the <br/>
unborn baby sharks inside! Many types of sharks are actually in-utero <br/>
cannibals, born live and surprisingly big after feeding on their unfortunate <br/>
siblings inside their mother&#39;s womb<br/>
