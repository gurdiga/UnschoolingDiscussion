<div id="ygrps-yiv-653760069"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Unless you&#39;re inviting Aunt Jane to the movie too,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and in that case it wouldn&#39;t matter if the living room was<br/>
straightened. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday morning we spent going to the doctor and checking out the local<br/>
indoor swimming pool, and the afternoon we spent at friends&#39; house.  We were<br/>
going to a concert in the evening, and my mother was coming over to go with<br/>
us.  It would have been nice to have the living room and kitchen<br/>
straightened up, but the first freeze was last night so I was trying to get<br/>
all the plants in and cut the last of the nasturtiums before they died.  Ds<br/>
(15 yo) made the pie crust for dinner (he likes doing that), and dd (11 yo)<br/>
got the meat pie filling together (she&#39;s recently gotten interested in<br/>
cooking and measuring things out).  My mother got here early, while we were<br/>
in the middle of all this, and by the time I got back inside, she had half<br/>
the dishes cleaned up &lt;grin&gt;.  The living room is still a wreck, but it<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to hamper our conversation (what little there was before we went<br/>
out to the concert).  And we&#39;ve got lots of lovely vases of flowers &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
