&lt;&lt;I felt the need to discuss with my kids, the other day, the reality <br/>
of their lives.  I explained that they have lots of time and freedom <br/>
and if there was anything they wanted to do, like playing and <br/>
instrument, or basically anything that would take time and/or money <br/>
to learn, that this was a pretty good time in thier life to do it.  <br/>
Other people willing to help them and freedom from grown up <br/>
responsabilities and all that.  I think conversations are good.  I <br/>
let them know I don&#39;t care what or if they decide to take up <br/>
anything.  I just wanted them aware of the reality of the situation.<br/>
I don&#39;t want them to grow up and not realize all the possibilities. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Thanks Joanna!<br/>
What a wonderful common-sense suggestion that I hadn&#39;t even thought of.<br/>
But of course, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, always learning. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
