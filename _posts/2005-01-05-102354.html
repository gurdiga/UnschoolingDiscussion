Subject: [ClickSchooling] Wednesday: Language Arts Through Radio Shows<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi!  It&#39;s Wednesday, January 5, 2004 and time for Language Arts at<br/>
&gt; ClickSchooling!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to thank list member, Michael G., who recommended two websites<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; offer FREE old-time radio shows in mp3 format that you can download and<br/>
&gt; listen to with your family. Develop listening skills, great vocabulary,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; get a glimpse of entertainment prior to the advent of television. The<br/>
&gt; historical significance of some of these programs (many with controversial<br/>
&gt; themes) can launch lots of discussion around the house. Of course, you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; also find pure entertainment in the form of dramatic interpretations of<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; of the world&#39;s greatest literature. Here are the radio websites, with<br/>
&gt; descriptions taken directly from the sites...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Recommended Websites:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; RadioLovers.com<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.radiolovers.com">http://www.radiolovers.com</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; RadioLovers.com offers hundreds of vintage radio shows for you to listen<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; online in mp3 format, all for free. Before the days of video games,<br/>
shopping<br/>
&gt; malls, MTV, and the Internet, families used to sit in their living room<br/>
each<br/>
&gt; night to listen to radio shows such as Abbott and Costello, Superman,<br/>
&gt; Groucho Marx, The Avenger, Gunsmoke, Sherlock Homes and many others. When<br/>
TV<br/>
&gt; become popular in the 1950s, most of these shows went off the air, but<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; now live on at Web sites such as this one and on weekly nostalgia radio<br/>
&gt; broadcasts worldwide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mercury Theatre On The Air<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unknown.nu/mercury/">http://www.unknown.nu/mercury/</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The finest radio drama of the 1930s was The Mercury Theatre on the Air, a<br/>
&gt; show featuring the acclaimed New York drama company founded by Orson<br/>
Welles<br/>
&gt; and John Houseman. In its brief run, it featured an impressive array of<br/>
&gt; talents, including Agnes Moorehead, Bernard Herrmann, and George<br/>
Coulouris.<br/>
&gt; The show is famous for its notorious &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast, but<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; other shows in the series are relatively unknown. This site has many of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; surviving shows, and will eventually have all of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The show first broadcast on CBS and CBC in July 1938. It ran without a<br/>
&gt; sponsor until December of that year, when it was picked up by Campbell&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Soup and renamed &quot;The Campbell Playhouse.&quot; All of the surviving Mercury<br/>
&gt; Theatre shows are available from this page in RealAudio format (some are<br/>
&gt; also in MP3 format). There are several Campbell Playhouse episodes<br/>
available<br/>
&gt; here as well, in both RealAudio and MP3 formats. The rest are being added<br/>
&gt; gradually.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Note: If you would rather not install Real Player on your computer, you<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; install Real Alternative, allowing you to play RealMedia files without<br/>
&gt; having to install RealPlayer/RealOne Player. Visit<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Real_Alternative.htm">http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Real_Alternative.htm</a> for the free<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, and now many families sit together in the living room to watch TV or play video or computer games.  Some families even go to the mall together to shop or see movies on the big screen!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My mom tells of listening to radio shows as a child (she was born in &#39;32).  She says the kids would get mad if one kid sat between the radio and another kid.  &quot;Mom, I can&#39;t see the radio because Pat&#39;s in my way!&quot;<br/>
