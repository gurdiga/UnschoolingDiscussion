<div id="ygrps-yiv-732803270">I need some good reading material for my husband so that he may <br/>
better understand what and why we are doing (deschooling right <br/>
now).  He does much better when left to read and find out for <br/>
himself...hmm.<br/>
Any suggestions<br/>

As I was reading this, I would have ahaa moments that I would share with my husband.  He seemed to really relate to him,  and the author is a teacher.  So that&#39;s a great perspective. Very realistic, in terms of the masses.  I was able to check it out at my library.   I don&#39;t know if it really is on deschooling but it really was great for my husband.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021194954">Thanks, I will look it up.  Things are doing a lot better and we are<br/>
evening out here.  I started to noticed where my kids were really at in<br/>
their development something I could not do when Nate was in school.  And<br/>
now I have dropped the overbearing of academics and the days are lots<br/>
soother.  I also got the book, &quot;Math Wizardry for Kids&quot; and we are both<br/>
enthusiastic about it.  Lisa<br/>
