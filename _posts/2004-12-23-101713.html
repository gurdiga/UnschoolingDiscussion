<div id="ygrps-yiv-404329851">I used to be a sahm.  I worked from home designing products for the scrapbook industry and freelance writing.  I certainly didn&#39;t get rich, but it brought a little money to help.  Last summer, our family moved from CA to TN.  The move wiped us out financially, so I took a job at a local fast food restaurant.  I am miserable -- without sounding too childish, my boss is cruel...even borderline abusive.  If I work with her in a given shift (which I usually do), I usually leave work feeling worthless.<br/>
<br/>
We unschool our three children (ages 14, 12, and 4) -- we love it.  My husband works nights so he is home during the day -- but a asleep until about 1-2pm.  I am usually at work from 9-5 -- give or take.  But everything is crammed into my days or hours away from work.  <br/>
<br/>
While I have been unhappy at work (I miss my children terribly) for quite some time,  have just started to realize so much more.  I read recently about making our lives rich...not rich with money but days that are fun and full of opportunity.  My children don&#39;t have that anymore.  I don&#39;t spend much time with my husband.  We don&#39;t take part in field trips or other outings much because I work.  I often cry on my way to work because I am so sad leaving them. <br/>
<br/>
So, I have made the decision to work much less.  I have already went down to 20 hours per week at work, but things have been so slow there, that I have worked even less than 20 hours.  I am around my kids so much more (LOVING IT!), BUT I want more and am trying to find a way to quit altogether.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem is financially -- I don&#39;t know how we would make it without my money (I don&#39;t make a lot -- only $5.25 per hour, but it still helps) -- the only good thing is that I am again working at home designing (something I put on the back burner when we moved to TN) but while my designs are selling, I am only paid quarterly and things are slow to get going again.  I know that in time I can replace my &quot;work outside the home&quot; income, but it may take a few months.  And I can&#39;t stay working at the restaurant until I replace the income because I don&#39;t have enough time to work at home designing if I am working (did that make sense?).<br/>
<br/>
I am not looking for solutions really....I guess I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has been in my shoes and what you did.  Sometimes I think I am an awful mom because I go to work and then I think I am an awful mom because I am on the verge of leaving my job, making things very hard on us financially.  I just don&#39;t know what to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37635452">My DIL is going through this as a new mom -- she&#39;s been a floral <br/>
designer for the past ten years, but got laid off right before the <br/>
baby was born.  She&#39;s been freelancing and taking the baby with her, <br/>
but it&#39;s been difficult, and it&#39;s definitely not paying the bills.  <br/>
Her cousin recruited her to the Pampered Chef last summer, and she <br/>
tried that route until the party crowd fizzled out.  We took it up <br/>
partly to support her efforts and partly as a <br/>
homeschool/philanthropy project.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a SAHM since my husband gave me the gift of instant <br/>
motherhood on our wedding day (he had fulltime custody of his <br/>
preschooler.)  We tried switching roles a few years later when our <br/>
daughter was nearly a year old (I thought they automatically weaned <br/>
on their first birthday...) but I was miserable being away from the <br/>
kids.  DH got a chance to bond with them for a year, but he knew I <br/>
wanted to be with the kids and he was restless to get back to work --<br/>
 so we switched back.  <br/>
<br/>
Financially, we&#39;ve only had a couple of rough spots in the past <br/>
twenty years of family life (while I was working at a much lower-<br/>
paying job than his, and another time when we were having some major <br/>
communication problems and outgo outpaced income.)  Both times, we <br/>
made the decision to ask our extended family for support (monetarily <br/>
and/or otherwise) until we could get back on our feet again and <br/>
figure out how to make it on one income.  It was tough to do as a <br/>
matter of pride, but the alternative (leaving the nursing babies to <br/>
return to work) was unthinkable.<br/>
<br/>
Now that our grand-daughter has arrived, our DIL has decided that <br/>
the field of floral design is simply not secure enough to provide <br/>
for the future and plans to start nursing school in January.  She&#39;s <br/>
still nursing the baby (9 months,) believes in attachment parenting, <br/>
is impressed with homeschooling, but still feels a strong need for <br/>
independence, both financially and otherwise.  It&#39;s a tradeoff for <br/>
her, missing this time with her daughter in order to make sure <br/>
things are good for the family later down the road.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m personally heartsick to see her make the same mistake that I <br/>
made by returning to work/school before the baby has even weaned -- <br/>
and I was working forty hour weeks with no overtime.  Nursing school <br/>
is a whole &#39;nother story!  I&#39;ve tried to encourage her to relax and <br/>
rely on family, both immediate and extended, and enjoy her role as <br/>
mom for now -- parenting in itself being something that doesn&#39;t get <br/>
near enough recognition for its importance to society, let along our <br/>
own offspring -- but the idea of being out of control amongst so <br/>
many unknowns seems too great.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve learned from our financial ups & downs that once we make up <br/>
our mind to do what we love and the money will follow -- it always <br/>
does, without fail.  Proof positive that Mrs. Eddy (discoverer of <br/>
Christian Science) was right when she wrote, &quot;Divine Love always has <br/>
met, and always will meet, every human need.&quot; -- Science & Health <br/>
with Key to the Scriptures <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some great articles along this line of thinking at Healing <br/>
Unlimited:<br/>

 <br/>
Hey, it can&#39;t hurt to think positive, and I think you are on the <br/>
right track back to fulltime SAHM.  Unschooling&#39;s all about freedom <br/>
and creativity, not only for our kids, but for ourselves -- and you <br/>
know what they say -- if Mama ain&#39;t happy, ain&#39;t nobody happy!  I&#39;m <br/>
positive that you can work it out.  In the meantime, it sounds like <br/>
you could use a little self-empathy and your supervisor could stand <br/>
for an introduction to Nonviolent (self-destructive and other <br/>
hurtful words included) Communication <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnvc.org">http://www.cnvc.org</a> <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, my DIL will find a way to make things work without <br/>
leaving her daughter to be raised by relatives and babysitters while <br/>
she&#39;s putting in overtime with a demanding career.  Unfortunately, <br/>
it looks like they&#39;ll be learning the hard way like the rest of <br/>
us... perhaps our experiences are enough to convince you that there <br/>
are no &quot;awful&quot; moms, just those of us trying to meet our needs in <br/>
the best way we know how.  <br/>

P.S.  The Pampered Chef offers its consultants some excellent <br/>
materials to help with relocating the business, plus a reprieve upon <br/>
request during the transition period.  If you haven&#39;t already taken <br/>
advantage of these resources with your Scrapbook/Home Design <br/>
company -- perhaps this will give you another boost in the right <br/>
direction.  All the best-PA, aka Ma to all my buddies here at home<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-438033131">I wait tables at Cracker Barrel (hate it, chain restaurants have just <br/>
some of the stupidest rules and I have a hard time keeping my mouth <br/>
shut) but the money is good. I work wed. 5-9, Sat 8-2, Sun 8-2. Any <br/>
given week I will make anywhere from $150-$200. I only get paid $2.85 an <br/>
hour but with tips I average about $15 an hour. At a nicer (not &quot;family&quot; <br/>
type but with alcohol and more expensive food) you could make even more. <br/>
I&#39;m not even one of the &quot;cute&quot; gals (skinny, sweet, young things) they <br/>
make even more then me.....<br/>
If you are already working fast food you are used to being on your feet <br/>
and manual labor so.....<br/>
It takes a month or two to get good and you may make on average $10 an <br/>
hour that&#39;s still more then fast food or WalMart.<br/>
I hate my job but I could not go anywhere and make what I do with out <br/>
more &quot;skills&quot; or a degree so I stay and play their silly, silly games.<br/>

<br/>
  Brandi, I think Julie&#39;s advice is great.  Some other options you might want to try are eBay, Half.com, and mystery shopping.  Try looking on Volition.com--use their message boards.  My husband has been doing mystery shopping for a few months and usually makes close to $400.  He&#39;s a programmer and has a good job, but has fun doing the mystery shopping.  I don&#39;t know where in TN you live, we live outside a Dallas, but it&#39;s worth a shot.  You can also get free food sometimes, like pizzas, or you can get your meal and one other adult meal reimbursed as some restaurants.  You can get reimbursed haircuts for the kids.  It&#39;s fun for the kids, too.  My daughter is very into spies and she gets a kick out this stuff.  Sometimes the reports are long, so you&#39;ll have to weigh that into the deal, but I bet you&#39;d like it.<br/>
<br/>
  For eBay and Half.com.... I lived off of these two sites as a single mom for more than a year.  The turn-around is fast and sometimes you can make a lot of money depending on what you&#39;re selling.  You might want to investigate that, if you haven&#39;t already.  I&#39;m pretty sure you could sell your scrapbooking supplies through eBay too, if you haven&#39;t already.<br/>
<br/>
  Don&#39;t give up hope, but really...fast food is the pit of the service industry.  There&#39;s so much more enjoyable work you could do that would benefit your children and yourself.<br/>
<br/>
  Warmest regards,<br/>
  Nichole, in TX<br/>
