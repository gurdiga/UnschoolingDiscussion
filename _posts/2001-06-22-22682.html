    We unschool b/c this is what I had in mind when I was in highschool. I <br/>
knew then that it was a crock and I still do.Sorry I feel very strongly about <br/>
this.<br/>

    My dd and I just do our thing everyday. There is no sit down and learn <br/>
time. Many times we learn while driving,walking,and whenever. It just seems <br/>
to happen. It is very spontaneous and we love it. It is 99% child led here. <br/>
She asks the questions I answer or look it up. I am finding out how much I do <br/>
not know. :o)<br/>
<br/>
   My dd learn to write one day from asking me to write letters on a box I <br/>
was addressing so she could copy them. It worked. The box luckily was going <br/>
to a relative,it was covered in letters. This was just an example to show you <br/>
it will happen.<br/>

We unschool because we want to choose the lives we lead, instead of having<br/>
them decided for us. We want our children to have the opportunity to do the<br/>
same. To badly paraphrase Thoreau, there are no philosophers anymore, only<br/>
philosophy teachers. I think that&#39;s true, and I&#39;d rather be and raise a<br/>
philosopher.<br/>
Do your children currently go to pre-school? If not, and they&#39;re spending<br/>
their days with you, you are already doing what we do here. If it feels<br/>
right now, there&#39;s no reason to believe it won&#39;t feel right when they turn<br/>
the magic kindergarten age :). Good luck! ~Rue<br/>

Unschoolers,<br/>
My wife, Kim Jansen, and I recently moved to the woods were I work<br/>
as a Challenge Course Manager. We live on site at an Environmental<br/>
Education Center that serves about 20,000 people a year. We choose<br/>
the green land for our three boys; Tristan (4 years old), Chase and<br/>
Devon (2 year old twins). For the last two months we&#39;ve been<br/>
discussing the idea of home schooling and this is our first inquiries<br/>
to people who are doing the do. Our question is this: Why did you<br/>
choose to unschool?<br/>
We&#39;ve read information about benefits and other reasons to go this<br/>
route but we&#39;re eager to hear from people involved right this moment.<br/>
If you have any other advice or suggested reading please feel free to<br/>

&lt;&lt; We&#39;re choosing a different way to live but aside from ideas <br/>

these ideas. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ideas and words are all you get.<br/>
<br/>
If you saw statistics that wouldn&#39;t necessarily apply to your family. How <br/>
many people live in the situation you do? The skills and interests you and <br/>
your wife have will interact with your children&#39;s temperaments and interests <br/>
in ways unique on the planet. <br/>
<br/>
We know lots about the problems of school. Of unschooling, you will get <br/>
ideas and words.<br/>
<br/>
There are few endeavors which so many people have shared so freely. I think <br/>
the best resource (perhaps stating the obvious again, but it&#39;s not obvious to <br/>
everyone here) is to read the library and archives at www.unschooling.com, at <br/>
HEM&#39;s site, at NHEN&#39;s site. There is a wealth of current information added <br/>
to daily.<br/>
<br/>
Read John Holt if you haven&#39;t already. Teach Your Own is my recommendation <br/>
if you&#39;re only going to read one. Learning all the Time and Never Too Late <br/>
inspired me too.<br/>

Subject: Re: Ebay<br/>
<br/>
Dear Ann,<br/>
If you have ANY questions about it: condition, manufacturer&#39;s warranty, etc. etc.,<br/>
ask BEFORE you place a bid. If they don&#39;t answer you back, or don&#39;t give an answer<br/>
that satisfies you, don&#39;t bid. Wait. Another item just like it will come along. <br/>
If it turns out not to be what was advertised on the eBay site, try to resolve any<br/>
problems with the seller. If nothing gets settled to your satisfaction, turn them<br/>
in to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abuse@...">abuse@...</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, most people selling on eBay are wonderful people to deal with.<br/>
I have bought several items (too many items!) and have only had one bad turn. <br/>
But, ask questions first, bid second.<br/>

Subject: RE: Ebay<br/>
<br/>
We bought our digital camera on ebay (and my wedding dress and veil and<br/>
tiara and all our kids&#39; tuxes and my wedding stationary and and and...).<br/>
<br/>
My rule of thumb is to *only* buy from vendors who have sold a *ton* and who<br/>
have been selling for several months. Also, many times I will write someone<br/>
privately and make the sale that way. They often have more than one of the<br/>
same product and will sometimes sell for cheaper because I save them the<br/>
hassle of putting the item up for bid (and the cost, albeit minimal).<br/>
<br/>
So if you know exactly what product you are looking for, check out the<br/>
person&#39;s selling history, other items up for bid, rating, etc. This tells me<br/>
a lot about what kind of seller the person is. And also keep in mind a good<br/>
ebayer will be as leery of you (first time buyer) as you are of them. They<br/>
have a lot to lose too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never had a bad ebay experience. I did buy something once that wasn&#39;t<br/>
exactly what I expected (a toy - the picture made it look *much* larger than<br/>
it was but clearly stated the size) but I am still extremely happy with it<br/>
and that was *my* error.<br/>
<br/>
When we bought our digital camera, we also negotiated (behind the scenes,<br/>
after we won the auction) for extras at a lower price. A bag, an extra<br/>
battery, etc.<br/>

When we read about unschooling it was a &quot;Duh&quot; moment, finally I<br/>
understood why all of the &quot;education&quot; methods didn&#39;t fit. Learning can&#39;t<br/>
be cut up into bits that fit into a curriculum or schedule, it&#39;s like<br/>
breathing and it&#39;s unavoidable. I don&#39;t think there is anything more<br/>
important that I can give my children than the understanding that they<br/>
have complete control of their learning. Every time we tell children<br/>
they must learn this or that and assign a &quot;time&quot; to that learning we tell<br/>
them they are not capable of learning on their own or even knowing what<br/>
they need to learn.<br/>

Hi Vincent and Kim,<br/>
I always hesitate a bit before answering this question....here is why....<br/>
I did not choose to nor do I, homeschool for educational reasons. Ha! That<br/>
usually gets me some strange looks...<br/>
I remember precisely when I decided I would homeschool. My oldest son (now8)<br/>
was 2 at the time. He was running down the hill to the barn laughing and<br/>
laughing. It suddenly hit me that he would be going to school in 3 short<br/>
years possibly earlier! My heart just collapsed and I couldn&#39;t even think of<br/>
the possibility of him going away for the whole day. I would miss him<br/>
terribly, he would miss me, and there is always something interesting to do<br/>
on a farm. He would miss so much life! That did it, I started researching<br/>
right then. I read and read and read ect.... I read John Holt, old Growing<br/>
Without Schooling Magazines, Old Home Education Magazines, and every book I<br/>
saw mentioned in the back of other books. I specifically drawn to John Holt<br/>
and Grace Llewellyn. I learned from everything I read though. It made me<br/>
see how diverse homeschooling can be.<br/>
I also researched the laws for my state during this time.<br/>
I also looked into support groups, and made contact with a local one. It was<br/>
interesting to talk to everyone but my sons (we had added one during this<br/>
time) were much too young to do much. I then renewed contact later when all<br/>
three of my kids were older.<br/>
I still read and read.... I still talk and talk.... It helps to share.<br/>
I hope this helps you...and enjoy your family. That is what we do mostly.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was wondering what your favorite source for encouragement is<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, part of my encouragement just comes from watching my kids and <br/>
how they learn. They each learn in their own individual way and just <br/>
look at the things they have mastered in their relatively short <br/>
lives! Acquiring human language has to be the single most difficult <br/>
task we ever accomplish in our lives, and we do it before we&#39;re 2 or <br/>
3 years old with no formal instruction whatsoever and each of us does <br/>
it in our own way, some kids speaking just nouns for a year and then <br/>
adding verbs, some kids not talking for years and then coming out <br/>
with whole sentences. When I see this, I know that if we just apply <br/>
the same encouraging, yet hands-off principle to all other learning, <br/>
our kids will do just fine at whatever they put their ambition to.<br/>
<br/>
And for external motivation, you can&#39;t beat a good John Holt book, he <br/>
wrote a dozen or so and they&#39;re all great.<br/>

<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and subscribed because I am<br/>
interested in the opinions of other unschooling moms<br/>
and how your children have learned writing skills. We<br/>
unschool in the sense of trusting that our children<br/>
will know when they are ready to take on tasks and<br/>
following their lead for what they want to learn and<br/>
how they want to learn it. My daughter is nine this<br/>
month and took off on reading about 6 months ago. She<br/>
spends a fair amount of time reading both fiction and<br/>
non-fiction, but also still loves to spend time with<br/>
her various critters and engage in make-believe play<br/>
with her sibling and other children. She loves to<br/>
draw, but she HATESs to write. If she wants to leave<br/>
herself a note, for example, to bring her tortoise in<br/>
for the night instead of writing out the words she<br/>
will draw a picture of the tortoise grazing and post<br/>
that where it reminds her. I have been fine with this<br/>
approach and have trusted that when she is at a point<br/>
in her life where she wants to truly express her<br/>
feelings she will feel compelled to write. I have<br/>
kind of expected this will happen in adolescence. <br/>
Recently an event happened that is causing me to<br/>
question my judgement. Has anyone else out there left<br/>
it up to divine providence that their children will<br/>
indeed want to, and then proceed to, learn to write<br/>
when they are ready? Has anyone any regrets about<br/>
not being more proactive with their child in teaching<br/>
writing? Thanks in advance for any input.<br/>
<br/>

choose to unschool? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I started off believing in the idea of public education and became <br/>
disallusioned with it after some negative experiences. When I first started <br/>
homeschooling, I was not an unschooler and had never even heard about it. <br/>
But I disliked the other kind of homeschooling because it was always coercive <br/>
learning and the thing is, what do you do if you tell the kids to do a math <br/>
paper or write something and an hour later they&#39;re still sitting there <br/>
thinking about other things? Some of my kids were this way. So then you get <br/>
into the &quot;discipline&quot; issues, meaning threats or blackmails, and it just all <br/>
felt wrong to me.<br/>
When I found out about unschooling, it really appealed to me and we <br/>
gradually moved more and more in that direction. At first I was afraid they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t learn anything (a common concern) but I found that they learn more <br/>
their way than they ever did before. They read a lot and each have their own <br/>
unique interests.<br/>
I have five boys, ages 4, 9, 13, 13, and 17. My 9 year old has some <br/>
learning difficulties and at times I have worried that he might need more <br/>
structured learning but he seems to be making some huge jumps lately. My 17 <br/>
year old just passed the California High School Proficiency test so he has <br/>
the legal equivalent of a diploma now. The kids value their freedom and <br/>
don&#39;t like me to schedule too many activities for them because they like <br/>
having a lot of time. <br/>
I have no regrets whatsoever and only wish that I had known to unschool a <br/>
long time ago. It would have saved my oldest son from some lousy experiences <br/>
with his kindergarten and second grade teachers. He was always a daydreamer <br/>
and has become a very thoughtful and creative person but that wasn&#39;t valued <br/>
in school.<br/>
Your situation sounds incredibly interesting and I hope that you will <br/>
post more about what you do there. Best wishes with all that you decide to <br/>
do...<br/>

I am definetly not an expert in this area - but here is my 2 cents.<br/>
My oldest wrote at an early age - part of that was from attending ps for 2<br/>
years. However her penmanship is horrible. My 2nd child - my son, I waited<br/>
till he was about 7 to attempt writing. We did the &quot;Teach Your Child to<br/>
Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; - it worked for him. His penmanship is nice and<br/>
neat. We also used the &quot;A Reason for Writing&quot; lessons. <br/>
My 3rd child is a lefty - I tried &quot;Teach Your Child&quot; method with her, we<br/>
both would end up frustrated. I decided to allow her to do as she wanted -<br/>
no lines, no forced writing. She is not writing fluently, well she can&#39;t<br/>
even write her name - but she is interested in learning because it is what<br/>
she wants to do, not what I am forcing her to do. I will write something on<br/>
a piece of paper and she will copy it on another piece.<br/>
You might try asking your daughter if she would like to put some of her<br/>
&quot;make-believe&quot; stories in a book, and let her illustrate it also. Kate<br/>
