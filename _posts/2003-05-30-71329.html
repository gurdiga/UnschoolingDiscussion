<div id="ygrps-yiv-536055852">I ws reading along about the son who didn&#39;t want to d the <br/>
suggestions his mother gave him.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I noticed were the binary choices &quot;Do you want to go to <br/>
the library?&quot; No. &quot;Do you want to go to the zoo?&quot; No.<br/>
<br/>
A couple things that work for us is to give options: &quot;What sounds <br/>
better--the zoo, bird watching on a hike or something else?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also made a list of fun stuff to do for the summer (fifty ideas) <br/>
that I posted to our refrigerator so that the kids don&#39;t forget some <br/>
of the fun stuff they like to do and they don&#39;t ahve to take <br/>
suggestions from me (which sometimes feel like Mom&#39;s choice, <br/>
then, instead of their own).<br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;re really stuck, it might be fun to grainstorm a list <br/>
together of all the fun stuff he&#39;d like to do (get his ideas at night!) <br/>
and then type them up, print them out, cut them into strips and <br/>
put them in a jar. Then he can draw one out and be surprised by <br/>
which one will be done that day! Some kids just say &quot;no&quot; when <br/>
given the yes/no option because it helps them feel in control.<br/>
