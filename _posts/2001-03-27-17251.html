<div id="ygrps-yiv-166219327">Has anyone researched mammograms?  I am not in a high risk group for<br/>
breast cancer, but my doc wants me to get a baseline mammogram.  I&#39;m 42. <br/>
Are mammograms really a great diagnostic tool, or one of those things<br/>
that we will learn the hazards of years from now?  I would appreciate if<br/>
anyone could point me towards articles, etc.<br/>
