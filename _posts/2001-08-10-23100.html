&lt;&lt; Your information on shingles is not correct.  In fact, it would appear to <br/>

 the reverse.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

    I always thought people who got shingles were those who did not have the <br/>
chicken pox.  My stepbrother had shingles in his late teens and I was told he <br/>
had never had chickenpox.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655868839">You can get a mild case of chickenpox that doesn&#39;t show more than a really<br/>
mild rash.  Sometimes mistaken for a heat rash.  Also, some folks get no<br/>
rash at all.  Not the norm, but it happens.<br/>
