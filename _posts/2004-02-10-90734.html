<div id="ygrps-yiv-613785648">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I have been religiously reading the posts now for at least a month (or <br/>
two?).  I was a &quot;TV is evil&quot; person about a month (or two) ago.  I was also <br/>
the one who said that I would start &quot;letting my kids watch all the TV they <br/>
want and eat all the crappy foods they want - ha ha.&quot;  Before I found your <br/>
post, I was at a point with unschooling/parenting where I KNEW it had to get <br/>
better, and I KNEW that I just wasn&#39;t doing something right, but I had not <br/>
clue what that was.  Well it has all been clicking for me everyday since <br/>
then as I loosen up more and more - and my children are the happiest they <br/>
have ever been in their short lives (they are 3 and 4).  I just wanted to <br/>
tell you guys &quot;thank you&quot; for doing this post, and that it has changed all <br/>
of our lives dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to my question.  I haven&#39;t read anything about this since I have been <br/>
here, unless I somehow completely missed something.  I will try to keep it <br/>
short.<br/>
<br/>
My husband just got back from Missouri.  He noticed how much more &quot;quiet&quot; <br/>
his nieces and nephews were.  They weren&#39;t constantly asking questions, <br/>
debating with him and their parents, etc.  I have always encouraged my kids <br/>
to stand up for themselves, work on their skills with talking (debating) <br/>
with other people.  I believe that my husband thinks that they are too <br/>
&quot;bold&quot; and &quot;spoiled&quot; for their age.  Yes, our children are quite headstrong <br/>
and talk a lot, but they are not &quot;bratty.&quot;  But I think to him they are <br/>
because they aren&#39;t quietly amusing themselves.  Are you with me still?  :)<br/>
<br/>
I then made mention later during another conversation that I did not agree <br/>
with sending your child to put their nose in a corner for discipline <br/>
measures.  This kind of riled him up because doing that isn&#39;t &quot;that bad!&quot;  <br/>
He then went into the whole speech of &quot;Parents have been <br/>
discipling/spanking/putting the nose in the corner with their kids for 100&#39;s <br/>
of years!  And now they say how &#39;bad&#39; it is!!&quot;  I am sure you have heard <br/>
that argument before.<br/>
<br/>
I understand where my husband is coming from (I don&#39;t agree with him <br/>
though).  He was raised that way, so what is wrong with it now (his line of <br/>
thinking)?  I think he feels like our kids run all over us.  I also think <br/>
that after being with his relative&#39;s kids who are so &quot;well behaved&quot; and <br/>
&quot;quiet,&quot; that he is worried that we have &quot;no control&quot; over our kids.<br/>
<br/>
One example.  In the car we were driving.  My son had a constant barrage of <br/>
questions about everything.  To me they were legitimate 4-year-old <br/>
questions.  To my husband (who was tired) they were annoying and he didn&#39;t <br/>
understand why my son just couldn&#39;t be quiet so us adults could talk.<br/>
<br/>
Another example.  My two kids get in a fight.  I take the time to ask each <br/>
one what happened (just started separating them to do that - good advice), <br/>
and then discuss better ways to handle it, another way to say something, <br/>
etc.  My husband sometimes makes the effort to deal with it, but other times <br/>
he just gets mad at them or will send the one (who appears) to be the <br/>
aggressor into time out.<br/>
<br/>
So the problem is, I never really know how to get through to my husband that <br/>
my son isn&#39;t annoying.  He is being four.  This is where he is supposed to <br/>
be.  I never know how to answer that &quot;the discipline has been going on for <br/>
100&#39;s of years&quot; statement.  And something tells me that some of you may have <br/>
some good answers, or at least lead me to some website that has more <br/>
information.  In addition, my husband often makes note that I am very <br/>
&quot;defensive&quot; when it comes to discussing our children, and am not &quot;open <br/>
minded&quot; to &quot;different&quot; was of disciplining them.  I don&#39;t think I am being <br/>
defensive, I just don&#39;t agree with him.<br/>
<br/>
Any help is appreciated.  And has anybody else had very different ideas <br/>
regarding discipline with their spouses, and how did you handle it?<br/>
<br/>
(I think I failed on keeping it short.)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
Erika  :)<br/>

Sounds like he&#39;s defending hundreds of years of not-different and you&#39;re the <br/>
one being open minded.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually work toward where you want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, your kids are young enough to forget most of the corner-standing <br/>
nonsense if you make somewhat light of it now and keep it from being too <br/>
frequent.  Your husband will grow out of it, I bet.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Good&quot; kids who are very quiet sometimes turn into very quiet adults, who <br/>
aren&#39;t considered good, they&#39;re considered fish-like, pancakes, not easily hired <br/>
or promoted, don&#39;t easily defend their own territory/family/children, don&#39;t <br/>
express themselves, don&#39;t give speeches, don&#39;t BE much except quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I bet he doesn&#39;t envision dull-eyed non-communicative adults when he thinks <br/>
of his own children grown.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  A lot of your DH&#39;s problems seem to crop up when he&#39;s tired. When one or the other of me and DH is tired (did that make any grammatical sense, ugh, I&#39;m tired right now) we do a tag team thing. If he&#39;s cranky I put a hand on his arm and tell him to go have a rest or read or something and I handle it. Likewise, he&#39;ll send me to my room if I&#39;m being a tyrannical crank.<br/>
      Read a lot. Get a ton of positive disciplining books from the library and research. If nothing else it helps you hold to your convictions...And, maybe your kids do need a little more help and you could get some useful strategies. One thing though...I find trying to hold a private chat in a shared family space like a car is not going to work, ever. A great time for family chats though.<br/>
      But help your husband too. You said a couple of times that he was tired. Maybe part of his frustration is that? Be kind and generous...It comes back to you eventually. I started spreading my unschooling attitude to my DH and it&#39;s made a big difference.<br/>
      But...Those nieces and nephews who are quiet now will test their boundaries at some time. Likely when they&#39;re teenagers or older and the consequences get more dire. You&#39;re letting your kids spread their wings and excercise choice now when sex, drugs and other serious risks aren&#39;t a factor. By the time adolescence comes they&#39;ll hopefully be in a much stronger position to buck any peer pressure and make their own decisions. Maybe let your husband know that this might be a long term goal of yours?<br/>

My husband forgets to include children in conversations.   He&#39;s gotten angry <br/>
with me twice in the past few months because I pointed out that he was talking <br/>
to me about something work-related (he&#39;s an engineer and it will be a story <br/>
about management or projects or military contracts) that the kids present (once <br/>
Holly, once Holly and her friend) could NOT follow and cared nothing about.  <br/>
I told him we should change the subject and he took it as ME being bored or <br/>
not caring about his work, instead of me wanting to include the other people.<br/>
<br/>
After the second time I talked to him later and explained my reasoning and I <br/>
doubt it will happen anymore.  He didn&#39;t mean to be rude, he just isn&#39;t as <br/>
used to including the kids as I am.<br/>

Any help is appreciated.  And has anybody else had very different ideas <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you are not in agreement on the Principles that you are<br/>
living by.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I found that giving James (dh) whole books or lectures didn�t help him to<br/>
get it, but made him  feel defensive and overwhelmed. Instead I forward some<br/>
pithy e-mails and the occasional online article.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The second suggestion I have is by all means bring him to the conference so<br/>
that he can see the other kids, and get a glimpse into the wonderful future<br/>
in store for him with the older ones. It took the conference for it to<br/>
crystallize for me that unschooled younger children do not look/behave like<br/>
traditionally parented younger children. There is a greater tolerance (even<br/>
encouragement) for wildness and spiritedness and fearlessness in the littler<br/>
ones, who miraculously become older children with genuine self control and<br/>
charm. The focus here is on finding ways to facilitate the spirited play,<br/>
without it being too exhausting and infuriating for everyone around. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jayn (4) does things that upset my dh way more than they do me, like hitting<br/>
him sometimes, telling us to �shoo�, and saying �Hummph� turning up her<br/>
nose. He can�t stand the hitting and what he calls meanness and ingratitude.<br/>
I think it is mostly her melting down temporarily. He starts ranting about<br/>
how we �have tried your way and it isn�t working� and that we need to find<br/>
something else to �do� -  �we respect her but she doesn�t respect us�. Some<br/>
of his suggestions are punishments � like take a toy away. I find if I try<br/>
to argue with him it just accelerates and turns into an argument about me<br/>
not supporting him, or my character defects, and other<br/>
unrelated-to-the-situation stuff. It is hard not to argue because I am so<br/>
definitely opposed to all of his �suggestions�. However I have come to<br/>
realize that he is *not* actually making genuine or serious suggestions,<br/>
more like venting his frustration. If I let him go on, he starts hearing<br/>
himself and how dopey his ideas are. I don�t believe he ever seriously<br/>
intends to implement any of it since he just winds down and ends up being<br/>
just as sweet to Jayn as always. So I try to limit my comments to how she is<br/>
just 4, and reassure him that this is normal stuff. It is hard for me not to<br/>
jump to the defense of all things unschooling, but in this situation, with a<br/>
dh who does get it and sometimes just needs to remind himself, keeping still<br/>
is best.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes even my wonderful dh calls what we are doing, �doing nothing�<br/>
about behavior issues. It can look like nothing compared to the active<br/>
controlling and punishing of traditional parenting. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think she should be hitting, or saying &quot;shoo&quot; or &quot;Harumph.&quot;  if she <br/>
has those from a book, maybe talk to her about how books are written so people <br/>
can think of how the characters in the book felt when someone was mean to <br/>
them.  But it&#39;s not a way to treat real people with feelings.   And remind her her <br/>
dad is nice to her, maybe, and that she should be as nice to him as she can <br/>
be, and say &quot;Excuse me&quot; instead of &quot;shoo&quot; or say &quot;I don&#39;t want to do that right <br/>
now&quot; instead of hitting.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem like an unschooling or choice-making situation to me, and <br/>
there&#39;s a danger that your husband will lose patience with meanness and not want <br/>
to proceed with unschooling if you call this unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928508115">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not recommending punishments, I&#39;m recommending helping her be mindful and aware.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that helping kids to be mindful and aware of their behaviour and how it makes others feel is a longer-term project.  :)  Punishments usually work pretty quickly to change the behaviour right now, but they don&#39;t help much in the long-term; if you&#39;re not there to punish, they will likely see it as an opportunity to behave however they wish with no regard for others&#39; feelings - because that was never discussed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And remind her her dad is nice to her, maybe, and that she should be as nice to him as she can be, and say &quot;Excuse me&quot; instead of &quot;shoo&quot; or say &quot;I don&#39;t want to do that right now&quot; instead of hitting.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It helps to be aware of their frustration level.  If it&#39;s some words or action they use daily that is hurting others&#39; feelings, and you can give them another set of words that is more &quot;acceptable&quot; and explain why, I don&#39;t think it will take too long for them to figure it out with a few reminders.  <br/>
<br/>
If however, the behaviour is the result of frustration, I think it takes more time and experience for them to learn the skills to monitor their words and actions and to consider how their words and actions will make others feel *before* reacting.  And to remember that even if you think it&#39;s nothing worth getting frustrated over, if they are, they are.  You have to start there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She might just grow out of it, but it&#39;s not fair to him to have to wait through the experiment in discomfort.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I would try to help him not feel frustrated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve kind of work it from both ends.  I explain to my husband, in private, how his words and/or actions could have contributed to the incident or to the escalation of the incident.  Trying to show him what the situation probably looked like through their eyes, and why they reacted as they did (and age and experience is a factor here).  And we might discuss how he could get his point across next time without causing so much friction or frustration for him or them.  <br/>
<br/>
And I also speak with the kids, individually, about how their words and/or actions were probably seen and felt through his eyes.  And what they might say or do in a similar situation in the future so they can get their point across without inadvertently hurting the feelings of others.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and once in a while letting dh know that I am talking with them regularly about these issues ... since you don&#39;t normally see behaviour changes overnight!  So he doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m just blowing off his reaction and feelings.  It also helps him to see that our oldest (he&#39;s almost 12) is really starting to come into his own in this area.  No more big tantrums with seemingly minor provocation, the self-confidence to express himself and his frustration to his dad (and me!) without getting angry, the ability to say first when he&#39;s getting angry or frustrated and to warn that he&#39;ll leave the room if the discussion continues in the same vein etc.  He&#39;s even taken to telling his younger brother and sister that they are lucky he&#39;s skilled at anger management when they are frustrating him.  :)  He used to lash out first, talk later.<br/>
<br/>
It certainly takes more time than sending them into timeout or taking away &quot;privileges&quot;, but I know they learn a whole lot more about themselves and others.  And it helps my dh to see and treat them like human beings, not &quot;just kids&quot;.<br/>

***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a clear distinction between parenting and unschooling.  For me both are about respectful relationships with my children, for that matter reflective of relationships with all people in general.<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;correcting&quot; a childs hurumpf or shoey...I will sometimes let my kids know that I don&#39;t want to be spoken to in a certain way and ask them to reframe their comment in a way that I can understand.  The same way I might respectfully ask my dh not to shout at me as I can&#39;t hear what he is saying.  &quot;You speak so loud, I can&#39;t hear what you are saying.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s about respectful communication.  For instance, &quot;I really want to understand what you mean, could you please say it again.  Perhaps using different words.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are other times, that i just need to accept that in the moment the other person is frustrated and not expressing themself in a way that I would prefer - but we&#39;re human beings, make mistakes and when i am trully centered i can give them room to poor communicators without it affecting my perception of them (or myself) on the whole.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel this is all so important to the whole realm of unschooling.  We do alot of problem solving in our family, giving everyone a chance to express their feelings and giving everyone a chance to respond with their ideas on making things work better for everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
btw - i hardly use the word unschooling to my husband.  i do however express my need to include everyone in conversations that affect us all and focus on coming to solutions that work for everyone involved.  when we stick to it - it always, always works...sometimes it just takes time, and sometimes not everyone is ready or willing to work on the solution in that moment.  but we get better and better at making sure everyone trully feels comfortable with the solutions and noone feels coerced or manipulated.  AND - the kids inevitably come up with the best solutions - those that i or my husband would never think of myself - as we are so over conditioned.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-270875913">&lt;&lt;I would talk to her, even if it didn&#39;t upset me, and <br/>
tell her that was not only hurting her dad&#39;s feelings, but could hurt her<br/>
own <br/>
happy freedoms���<br/>
I would think of it as just discourtesy, and I would keep at her about being<br/>
<br/>
kind to people, and either doing nice things or not doing anything����<br/>
<br/>
I would try to help him not feel frustrated���.<br/>
<br/>
And remind her her dad is nice to her, maybe, and that she should be as nice<br/>
to him as she can be, and say &quot;Excuse me&quot; instead of &quot;shoo&quot; or say &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
want to do that right <br/>
now&quot; instead of hitting.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
These are all the things that I am doing, along with offering her<br/>
alternative verbal strategies. These are exactly the kind of things that can<br/>
look like �doing nothing� to someone who parents traditionally, who has not<br/>
made the shift, or does not have the desire to go towards unschooling and<br/>
respectful parenting. Sometimes it is a melt down from frustration or<br/>
tiredness situation, which I believe she will grow out of � or at least grow<br/>
out of having that kind of reaction to her frustrations.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;there&#39;s a danger that your husband will lose patience with meanness and<br/>
not want <br/>
to proceed with unschooling if you call this unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The point I was trying to make was that dh has a need to talk out his hurt<br/>
feelings and if I short circuit his process by arguing with him, he just<br/>
gets frustrated with me as well. If allowed to talk it through he returns to<br/>
calm appreciation of all of the above type of procedures, and kind of sighs<br/>
about it. Jayn is 4, my dh and I are 42. I think an adult is supposed to be<br/>
able to rise above some of the stuff a 4 year old will do just because they<br/>
are tired, frustrated, hungry or being asked to wait a moment for real life<br/>
reasons. Jayn lashes out much less than she used to, and mostly just with<br/>
Daddy � so I can�t help feeling sometimes his neediness for her affection is<br/>
part of the cause of some of her rejecting of him behavior. Left to initiate<br/>
it herself she will run and hug us constantly. I don�t allow her to hit me,<br/>
by holding her hands and telling her she may not hit me. But I don�t either<br/>
harp on about her hitting for a long time after, or just ignore her either.<br/>
I try to find out why she is angry. So much of the time it is in reaction to<br/>
my mood, or activities.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think she should be hitting, or saying &quot;shoo&quot; or &quot;Harumph.&quot;  if<br/>
she <br/>
has those from a book, maybe talk to her about how books are written so<br/>
people <br/>
can think of how the characters in the book felt when someone was mean to <br/>
them.  But it&#39;s not a way to treat real people with feelings.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
She gets the nose turning up �Hummph� from several different tv sources!<br/>
Ruby�s friend Louise does it in an episode of �Max and Ruby� to show her<br/>
disdain of Max�s Halloween costume. Kiki does it in �Kiki�s delivery<br/>
service� because she is shy of a boy, who pursues friendship anyway. <br/>

When Ben used to lose it (yes, he DID!), I would immediately tell him that HE <br/>
was 36 and Duncan was TWO! Or HE was 30 and Cameron was FOUR! He was the <br/>
adult.He *should* have more control. Was he so perfect at FIVE? or nine? or twelve?<br/>
<br/>
Frequent problem, but he&#39;s over it now! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
All ditto, Keith and Kirby, when Kirby was the only.<br/>
<br/>
I felt really stuck between, but in a weird way Keith was the needier of the <br/>
two.  I was still at a balance point, deciding how to be with Kirby sometimes, <br/>
and I would tell Kirby things were going to go better for all of us if Keith <br/>
was happy.  Then I&#39;d be telling Keith on the other side later that Kirby <br/>
wasn&#39;t responsible for Keith&#39;s happiness and if Keith couldn&#39;t remember his <br/>
childhood maybe that was a big clue that he was blocking things out and it was likely <br/>
his parents way was NOT a good way.<br/>
<br/>
And so forth.  For years.  But gradually Keith has really come around.<br/>
<br/>
I would really hate to be the cause of any divorce.  Not at Robyn&#39;s house, <br/>
because they&#39;re not unstable, but there&#39;ve been times in the past when advice <br/>
turned toward moms siding totally with kids, and it scares me.  Sometimes if a <br/>
mom&#39;s unwilling to compromise at all, she could lose her opportunity to <br/>
unschool for having to work fulltime if her husband leaves or worse, could lose <br/>
custody of the kids or have to share, and lost legal right to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe my reaction had in part to do with wondering what lurkers will grab <br/>
and run home with before really understanding all ramifications.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if it seemed too strong, since it was your post that triggered it, <br/>
Robyn.<br/>
<br/>
Keith was, and I&#39;ve seen other dads be, jealous.  He was (still is sometimes) <br/>
jealous because our kids do things he never got to do.  But though I used <br/>
them early on as healing exercises (saying yes when I know my mom would have said <br/>
no, and revelling in their happy faces), Keith has only more lately been <br/>
doing that, and I see it sometimes.  When Kirby asked if he could drive the van <br/>
Keith just bought (used) the day before--a big Chevy conversion van--to take his <br/>
friends to the movies, Keith thought about two seconds before saying &quot;Sure.&quot;  <br/>
 The Dodge Caravan would have held them all too, but Keith knew it would be <br/>
more fun for Kirby to take the plush big new thing, just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve said no.   But I would have said no because I would have thought <br/>
Keith would&#39;ve been happier with no.  It was pretty wonderful for all involved <br/>
for him to say yes.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing some of the early interactions of Keith and Kirby, 12 and 13 years <br/>
ago, I would never have expected any such thing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228197306">It certainly takes more time than sending them into timeout or taking away &quot;privileges&quot;, but I know they learn a whole lot more about themselves and others.  And it helps my dh to see and treat them like human beings, not &quot;just kids&quot;.<br/>

  I appreciated this post.  My oldest (7) has a difficult time controlling himself, especially when he becomes frustrated.  His actions frustrate me and I don&#39;t always respond to him as well as I would like.  I keep reminding myself that if I have a hard time being patient and tolerant with him how can I justify becoming upset with him when he, at 7, has the same trouble with his younger siblings.  It all needs to begin with me.  I wish I could say that I consistently provide him with a great example of how to interact with people.  I owe it to him as his mom to strive harder to be that great example.<br/>
