<div id="ygrps-yiv-94735633">Hello All:  My daughter has a desire to try high school.   I&#39;ve been treating this desire like <br/>
other ones and approaching it a day at a time, enjoying our time together looking at different <br/>
schools, etc. (Instead of getting all scared, and putting up road blocks as I&#39;ve done in the <br/>
past.)  For a couple schools she had to take a test, a pre-college board type test.  I felt she <br/>
probably needed a test taking tutor to do well, but there wasn&#39;t really time.  I figured at least <br/>
she&#39;d experience taking a standardized state test.  Her scores came back very low.  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure what to do -- part of me doesn&#39;t even want to tell her the scores, and I don&#39;t really want <br/>
to tell the schools either.   It&#39;s caused a bit of a rif between my spouse and myself, too.  <br/>
These really low scores to me just reflect dd&#39;s inexperience at test taking.  To my spouse, <br/>
who&#39;s an academic and has gone along with unschooling rather reluctantly, these scores  <br/>
scare her.    <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, my daughter seems so happy of late.  We&#39;re enjoying each other so much, she&#39;s <br/>
relaxed, doing so much that she enjoys . . . I&#39;m working to put this test and these apps into <br/>
some kind of perspective.  (And hope it&#39;s not going to back fire for her, self esteem wise, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been to Sandra&#39;s site about test taking, also,  I&#39;d appreciate any thoughts/experience <br/>
around this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Ann</div>

Was it the PSAT?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter, really, but there are test preparation books for  <br/>
the GED and that might be something to get.  You could tell her those  <br/>
are the kinds of things they&#39;ll be doing in high school, and if she  <br/>
looks through them and you help her with the vocabulary, that will go  <br/>
a long way toward helping her be ready for high school.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s possible that if she goes to school and doesn&#39;t like it,  <br/>
having seen that GED stuff (owning it at home, if you buy them) will  <br/>
give her the confidence that the core material is not all that secret  <br/>
or mysterious.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For some things, it really matters what the test is. Some schools  <br/>
have very specific curriculum-based entrance tests. In that case, her  <br/>
scores reflect her inexperience with the subject matter they happened  <br/>
to pick for that test. If it&#39;s a more general test, like the PSAT,  <br/>
there are study guides that will tell you what kinds of things will  <br/>
be on the test. I would ask her if she wants to know her scores, and  <br/>
then act accordingly. Practicing for those tests is generally very  <br/>
helpful. In our case, my daughter  - who took the PSAT and the SAT -  <br/>
mostly studied for the math part because the word stuff comes  <br/>
naturally to her. She still scored very high on the verbal part and  <br/>
medium low on the math.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to remember how little these scores mean in  <br/>
and of themselves and to view them as unpleasant obstacles to getting  <br/>
where you want to go. If that&#39;s where you want to go.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, it was.  We got her a big study book and she went through it for about 10 days prior to <br/>
taking the test.    We had fun with the guide, actually.  When I asked her how the test was, <br/>
she said that she wasn&#39;t sure if she did very well, but that there was a really cute guy next to <br/>
her that loaned her a pencil. . . .<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the suggestions, Ann</div>
