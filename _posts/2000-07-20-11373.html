 </span></blockquote>Thanks for reminding me of my dear grandfather who chewed tobacco and of<br/>
getting bee stung while picking scuppernongs.  Grandpa would take a wad of<br/>
chewed tobacco out of his mouth & paste it right over the bee sting.  It<br/>
does indeed work!<br/>

&gt;Picking what?!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was about 15 before I knew scuppernong was what my grandparents called<br/>
&quot;scuppanines&quot;.  They are similar to musadines which are wild grapes.<br/>
Scuppernongs are brown when ripe and have very thick skins (muscadines are<br/>
dark purple and also have the thick skins).  You simply squeeze them into<br/>
your mouth and swallow them whole.....some folks never get the hang of it,<br/>
like my husband.  If you try to chew them, even without the skins, there are<br/>
too many seeds.  So you just squeeze directly into your mouth, pointing the<br/>
spot which pulled from the vine into your mouth, swallow the &quot;guts&quot; and<br/>
discard the skin.<br/>
<br/>
We made jelly & jam, Grandma made wine, but I love them best standing under<br/>
the vine with the bees buzzing round!   Sometimes I can ocassionally find<br/>
them in a grocery store but they are usually green.  These days I visit a<br/>
grower near my grandparents home in NC, they are ripe in the fall, late<br/>
August thru September.<br/>
