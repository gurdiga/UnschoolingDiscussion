The pictures sound beautiful!  That is what I am looking for.  I will ask at <br/>
the next LLL meeting.  Great idea!<br/>
<br/>
Lorrie, Amy and all:  Way to go, Amy!  La Leche league is mother to mother <br/>
breastfeeding support, through group meetings and telephone support.  I have <br/>
been involved in LLL for 3 yrs, 2 kids, 4 moved, & the decision to stay at <br/>
home. Almost all of my best friends I have met throught LLL.  I have been a <br/>
leader for 1 1/2 yrs and learned about attachment parenting through there.  <br/>
Although, not everyone there (involved in LLL) AP&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any more questions, I would be happy to answer them.  They do <br/>
have a great site, though.  I don&#39;t read anything unless LLL has approved it <br/>
for their libraries.  It saves me tons of time, weeding out books that don&#39;t <br/>
mesh with my personal philosphy, plus I get the books from the group and I <br/>
get to keep them for a month.  If the library is slow, sometime two months. <br/>
hee hee hee<br/>
<br/>
You can find a local group by checking out their site or calling <br/>
1-800-laleche. BTW, their address and other great websites is in my signature.<br/>
<br/>
Amy, thanks for the website on UU.  I went to a church for the first time <br/>
today, but did not realize that is what you were talking about until I was <br/>
right in the middle of it.  So you all went to church with me this <br/>
morning.....hee hee hee.....  I liked it. Very different.  I am going to <br/>
check out the site, but I would love to hear your thoughts.  I am very open <br/>
minded when I hear other express their thoughts or feelings on something, so <br/>
feel free. <br/>
<br/>
Well, better run, I just got my little ones down for a nap and it is 3:30 <br/>
YIKES!  I guess short naps for them or we will be up all hours of the night.  <br/>
I want to work on a scrapbook page while I don&#39;t have little hands in the <br/>
middle of it.<br/>
<br/>
Chat with you guys later,<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059576459">Sorry to hop right in when I don&#39;t have a clue what this entire<br/>
discussion has been about, but I just got so excited to hear somebody talk<br/>
about LLL and AP! I&#39;m Amy, a 23-year-old SAHM in South Dakota. My dd,<br/>
Accalia, will be a year on Wednesday. Obviously we haven&#39;t begun any<br/>
academic studies LOL, but I&#39;ve become so interested in unschooling that I<br/>
had to jump in and find out more, more, more.<br/>
   I&#39;ve been going to LLL meetings since Accalia was a few months old and<br/>
have met so many good friends there. I&#39;m also contemplating becoming a<br/>
leader, but I&#39;m also wanting to start an AP support group in my area.<br/>
   Anyway, sorry if this is way OT, but I was just so happy to hear from<br/>
other &quot;likeminded&quot; parents.<br/>
   BTW, I love Mothering Magazine!<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no! This will make the second list I&#39;m on with like-minded people named Amy :). Such a common name, I guess. We aren&#39;t vegetarians (but are trying to eat healthier), but we do family bed, I stay at home, am planning to let Accalia decide when she wants to stop nursing, use cloth diapers, and are currently deciding to hold off on any more immunizations until we&#39;re more fully informed about the risks. I like to think that by us going against the &quot;norm&quot; with some of these parenting issues we&#39;re already teaching Accalia to be more open about the possibilities around her. Hopefully this will lead to a great unschooling experience once she&#39;s older.<br>

I think you&#39;ll find a lot of like minded People on this list. I think a lot<br>
