schooling. I don&#39;t see unschooling as &quot;Outside the norm of what is the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802687667"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Life is good ~Mary wrote:<br/>
&gt;I keep seeing this term &quot;unparenting&quot;. It sounds awful to me, am I missing <br/>
&gt;something? I choose to UN-school because I disagree with school and <br/>
&gt;schoolish approaches to learning. But UN-parenting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By the same token that the word &#39;school&#39; doesn&#39;t bring up all kinds of <br/>
ugly scenarios in my head.. the need to use the term &#39;unschool&#39; describes <br/>
another spectrum on the opposite side of the standard. As it stands with <br/>
the term &#39;parenting&#39; and &#39;unparenting&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Go to any bookstore and the mainstream parenting books will use terms <br/>
like &#39;your child manipulates you by crying&#39;, &#39;show them who the parent <br/>
is&#39;, &#39;they need to conform to your schedule&#39; and my all time gag-fave <br/>
about &#39;let them cry until they learn that night time they need to go to <br/>
sleep by themselves&#39;. They talk about encouragement in the form of praise <br/>
and extrinsic rewards, clapping for what seems to be like a trained seal, <br/>
and punishments.<br/>
<br/>
So I use the term to try to go outside the mainstream norm of what is the <br/>
common thought of parenting, in the way ppl go outside the norm of what <br/>
is the common thought of schooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I read Joyce&#39;s post and <br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t see anything in it that sounded like she was not being a full-on, <br/>
&gt;completely involved and ever present parent. Maybe I just use a different <br/>
&gt;term for what this is meant to describe. When I think of Joyce, and her <br/>
&gt;lovely descriptions of how she is with her daughter, I think of &quot;mindful <br/>
&gt;parenting&quot;.  Same thing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Terms, I suppose. Such as unschooling is child-led learning. Whereas a <br/>
mindful parent might consider something like a &#39;time-out&#39; or watch their <br/>
children perform. I see it as a way to explain that the current mindset <br/>
isn&#39;t what we&#39;re doing.<br/>

I have yet to actually here anyone here say they &#39;unparent&#39;, actually I have never heard that until here. What I do (and possibly others) is *trust* my children. I would agree with the above statement made, that kind of life would SUCK! How boring would that life be??<br/>

I think I would tend to agree, of course like I said I don&#39;t think anyone here would even use the term &#39;unparenting&#39;.  <br/>

Not of themselves.  The few times I&#39;ve heard it used it was invariably used <br/>
as a put-down to unschoolers.  I was surprised to see it in use on this list <br/>
in any fashion.  <br/>
<br/>
It takes more work, awareness and knowledge of your child to know what they <br/>
can successfully and confidently handle and to give them freedom and support <br/>
in that range than it does to just look at someone else&#39;s list of when to let <br/>
them do what and say &quot;no&quot; a lot.  Saying &quot;no&quot; makes some parents feel <br/>
responsible, like they&#39;re really parenting.  And it&#39;s easy to say &quot;No, go to <br/>
your room&quot; instead of &quot;Yes, okay, I&#39;ll get off my butt and help you do that <br/>
thing you want to do&quot; or &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll give you a ride there,&quot; or &quot;Sure, here <br/>
are the tools, and I&#39;ll show you how to use them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes unschooling critics will say with that snide voice, &quot;You let him do <br/>
anything he wants to do.&quot;   No, I HELP him do what he wants to do.  I <br/>
encourage him to do what he wants to do.   And lo and behold, the things he <br/>
wants to do are not stupid reactionary things.  Those things are done by kids <br/>
whose parents say a lot of &quot;NO.&quot;<br/>

possible corner of it, and have always seen it as a putdown.  It seems a <br/>
putdown in the paragraph above, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard anyone say &quot;I unschool educationally.&quot;  That implies there&#39;s <br/>
some sort of non-education unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the &quot;unschooling philosophy&quot; that some people take into various <br/>
other areas of parenting.  It&#39;s the mindful respect for children.  It&#39;s faith <br/>
and trust in young humans.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251266028">I think what the people in here meant by un-parenting<br/>
was to parent in a non authoritarian way.  To let<br/>
children develop self-discipline. I think the word<br/>
un-parenting gives off a misconception of what they<br/>
are trying to label.  I know there is no correct way<br/>
and that each child is different. I personally think<br/>
of neglected chidlren when I hear Un-parenting. I am<br/>
NOT saying that anyone is neglecting their children.  <br/>
