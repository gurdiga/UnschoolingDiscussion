Robyn Coburn wrote a story, kind of a parable, and I&#39;ve deposited it where it <br/>
will last forever and ever (well, for a while anyway), and added LOTS of <br/>
links to things to encourage new unschoolers or those who are frustrated with <br/>
their early unschooling experiences.    It&#39;s an easy address to remember, &quot;park&quot; <br/>
(especially once you&#39;ve read the story), so maybe keep it in mind when someone <br/>
you know seems misled about what unschooling is or should be, and pass it on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-795790754">Awesome -- One of the things that drew Nike to the place she&#39;ll be <br/>
rooming is its proximity to her art school and Toronto&#39;s High Park <br/>
(both walking, biking, rollerblading distance.)  Interestingly <br/>
enough, one of the people on Roommates.com warned her of the expense <br/>
of living in the city and tried to convince her of the advantages of <br/>
commuting on the GO train... Nike opted for the beautiful downtown <br/>
park, but they allow bikes in, too :o)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s to our ongoing celebration of independence!<br/>
