&lt;&lt; Kind of like responding <br/>
 without knowing who you are respondind to?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is going to happen all the time.<br/>
I don&#39;t know how many lists you are on with 1,000 people, or if you&#39;ve been <br/>
here long enough to see how many new people come along ALL the time.<br/>
It is impossible to keep track of everybody. To remember names, info. on <br/>
family etc.... you can only respond to comments and ideas initially.<br/>
As people post more and you get to know them, it&#39;s easier to respond directly <br/>
to them.<br/>
I&#39;ve been here a couple of years (left once and came back) and I can tell you <br/>
from experience that it would be completely impossible to keep track of <br/>
everyone.<br/>
You are insinuating that there is something wrong with us for not being able <br/>
to remember names and such.<br/>
How many years have you dispensed unschooling advice at a very large list?<br/>
If you&#39;d try to get the flow here and quite being so angry at everyone for <br/>
the way the list operates, I think you&#39;d enjoy it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have owned one for over 2 years. Its not a homeschooling or parenting list. <br/>
 The membership of  that group has been up to over 2500.   I know how lists <br/>
work and I always read each post carefully and note whom it it from before I <br/>
make a response<br/>

And how much time are you on the computer every day? I know for my life there <br/>
is no way possible to make sure I know who I&#39;m responding to every single <br/>
time.<br/>
So you can keep track not only of 2,500 names, but who they are and details <br/>
about their stories. Wow, I&#39;m impressed.<br/>
