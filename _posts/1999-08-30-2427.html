&gt;by money and acheivement.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would love to hear more about this Sandra, it fascinates me.  What is a<br/>
&quot;permaculture&quot; activist, and what are the details of you &quot;working together<br/>
to build a sustainable community?&quot;  I agree with you about people finding<br/>
it hard to live up to their ideals when everyone is so focused on money,<br/>
and on status in it&#39;s various forms.  I am proud to say that I am<br/>
definately not status oriented, and that our purchases are geared towards<br/>
our hapiness and not what other people think of us.  However, not being<br/>
concerned about &quot;appearances&quot; or about social climbing can be lonely in a<br/>
very conservative area like ours :-(...<br/>
<br/>
I think my distaste and often utter digust with that part of our culture<br/>
began for me with my mother and her status conscience (more like paranoid<br/>
or obsessive) behavior and her materialism.  She told me she used to have<br/>
Highschool friends (in the early 1950&#39;s) drop her off down the block from<br/>
her brand new house and she would walk up to someone else&#39;s door as if it<br/>
were hers until they were out of sight because her house did not have<br/>
landscaping in yet (Gasp! Shocking!)  She also never had any kind of a real<br/>
relationship with me and substituted gifts for her time and attention or<br/>
affection.<br/>
<br/>
I think another big step for me away from equating gifts with affection and<br/>
worrying about status of opinions was my wedding.  We had a change of plans<br/>
when we first started planning our wedding and ended up having a very<br/>
private ceremony on San Juan Island in Puget Sound with only our parents<br/>
invited as witnesses and a lovely weekend on the Island in a B&B honeymoon<br/>
cottage.  We got cards from some (not all!) of my siblings, and a gift or<br/>
two in the mail after the fact, but we never even got a gift from my<br/>
parents and we footed the bill for everything from the little cake to the<br/>
bouquet/corsages.  In retrospect it is one of my happiest memories and I<br/>
would not have wanted it any other way, but it was difficult at the time to<br/>
let go of the fantasy of a big wedding, with a great big reception and all<br/>
our relatives in attendance.  I have a huge family and grew up<br/>
attending/participating in lots of those type of weddings.  Now I am so<br/>
glad that we did it the way we did, instead of what was expected. <br/>

&gt;apprenticeship instead of only by books and tests, to raise a family or make<br/>
&gt;a million.  I guess that instead of saying we should be working for<br/>
&gt;universal higher education, what I really meant to say was the goal is the<br/>
&gt;*option* for *everyone* to have a higher education if they so choose.  <br/>

she is and always has been very materialistic, where I am not, I would love<br/>
to live in the country and have lots of animals and a garden ect..., I<br/>
cannot right now, I do live in a small town, that is very laid back and I<br/>
love it, she on the other hand lives in a much larger city, (lansing) it is<br/>
much faster paced, everyone works almost every family is a two income family<br/>
where she is, and the bigger the house and cars and the fancier the clothes<br/>
the better you are, she is one who is willing to spend $3.00 per person for<br/>
a candy bar at the movies, where I am one to buy the 3/99cents and put them<br/>
in my purse!   she was in awe of the ways that I cut corners to save money<br/>
mostly I do it because  it just doesn&#39;t make sense to me to spend extra if<br/>
you don&#39;t have to!<br/>
but she readily admitted that she could never do it! she would rather bounce<br/>
checks trying to look rich than to be proud buying from sales and wait for<br/>
something good to come along, I proudly wear my frugal crown and I am sure I<br/>
do not rank as queen as of yet, but I am working on it!<br/>

someone to drywall but all of the rest including plumbing and heating and<br/>
electrical we are doing, we have added a very large garage to put our 1998<br/>

a family room , a bathroom with laundry and two bedrooms upstairs<br/>
almost doubling our homes size!<br/>
great learning for the kids, I am not sure, but I think my 8 yo could<br/>
probably weld copper pipes!<br/>

and most of them have 3000+ sq. ft new houses for two adults and one or two<br/>

for two drivers.  Whereas our house is 20 years old and tiny by comparrison<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s so nice to read so many messages like this!  We live in a tiny little <br/>
place (800 sq ft) that still needs work done to it (which we also do <br/>
ourselves).  We live in the NE part of town which, in Portland, is the area <br/>
that many people won&#39;t consider moving to.  (Parts of it, I&#39;d agree with <br/>
them, but parts are fine.)  Most of my friends live in SW, which is the posh <br/>
area of Portland.  All of my married friends live in nicer places and drive <br/>
nicer cars than we do.  But we decided that time together and experiences <br/>
(i.e., classes and traveling) are more important than things.  Still, it&#39;s <br/>
intimidating at times to feel so &quot;out-classed.&quot;<br/>
