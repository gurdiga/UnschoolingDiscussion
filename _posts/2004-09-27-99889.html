&lt;&lt; A kid knowing that he has that freedom to go and do what he wants AND has  <br/>
the option to change his mind is much more empowered than one who is forced <br/>
to  <br/>
get up every day, just to practice getting up every day.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seems that way to me too.<br/>
But I don&#39;t think they&#39;re addicted to empowerment.<br/>
<br/>
And part of that empowerment probably came from times when the kids took <br/>
paths or exercised obsessions that worried the parents, but the parents trusted <br/>
the kids.<br/>
<br/>
It would be hard for me to change courses now and NOT trust that Holly and <br/>
Marty and Kirby were thoughtful and responsible.   It would be going directly <br/>
against something I  know is true if I were to pretend they were NOT <br/>
trustworthy.   But I came to it gradually over years of sometimes worrying and wondering, <br/>
but of trying to make the more trusting choices every time.<br/>
<br/>
Marty started a job last week, and hadn&#39;t collected his allowance for two <br/>
weeks, so last night he had $75 in his pocket, and was restless and wanted to go <br/>
do something.  He can drive now, too.  His nearest-living friend had already <br/>
gone to sleep (8:30 at night) but Marty was just antsy to go somewhere.  I <br/>
asked if he wanted to go to Walmart and pick up some paint for me (for Thinking <br/>
Sticks).   At first he didn&#39;t.  Then he did.   So at 9:00 he left saying he <br/>
might want to buy a video game.<br/>
<br/>
Came back soon with my paint, and no video game.<br/>
Borrowed the Hollywood Video card and went to rent one (out the back gate, <br/>
across the vacant lot, 9:45 p.m.)<br/>
<br/>
Came back without a rental game because they didn&#39;t have one he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Marty took my van and didn&#39;t run around irresponsibly.<br/>
Marty had $75 and it didn&#39;t burn a hole in his pocket.<br/>
<br/>
I could spend $75 at Walmart without even trying, and on stuff I hadn&#39;t even <br/>
heard of before I went.   But Marty, having had trust and freedom and plenty <br/>
(emotionally speaking at least) his whole life is not living as I did, and as I <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
The other day I was at the dentist for almost two hours, four fillings, shots <br/>
in 3/4 of my mouth, very relieved to have it over.  And so I rewarded myself <br/>
by spending money.  I went to a healthfood store I&#39;d never been in and bought <br/>
frivolous stuff.  Some gifts for Holly&#39;s birthday.   Cashew Butter.   Caraway <br/>
seeds, because they were cheap, even though I already have some. A bathbrush <br/>
because Holly&#39;s broke.  I spend money sometimes as self-comfort.   None of my <br/>
kids do that.  (At least I&#39;ve learned to go and spend on other people, or to <br/>
buy food, and I don&#39;t do expensive clothes or shoes or whatever all, so I still <br/>
have the needy behavior, I just channel it as well as I can.)<br/>
<br/>
I was supposed to wake Marty and Holly up by 11:30.  I stood up to go do it, <br/>
and met Marty.  I started up to wake Holly up, and met her on the stairs.   <br/>
They had me as backup, but each set an alarm.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re going to watch Buffy (borrowed DVDs of the first season) with a <br/>
friend in a town 20 miles away.  Marty&#39;s driving.  They&#39;re stopping by a community <br/>
center on the way to try to buy a membership so they can use the gym (exercise <br/>
equipment) and gameroom (pool, pingpong, foosball).  Their idea.   I loaned <br/>
him a charge card in case they need to gas the van.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that people who started attachment parenting and really trusting <br/>
kids later in the kids&#39; lives will get those results, but there are people <br/>
reading whose kids are still little who are still in the decision making phase.<br/>
<br/>
I think trusting them will pay off in unimaginable ways.<br/>
