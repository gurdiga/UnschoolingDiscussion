&gt;She loves them!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Comics are the best!! I&#39;ve often thought of writing an article called <br/>
&quot;Garfield Taught My Son To Read&quot;. Truly. Between going through all our old <br/>
baby/kid books and reading his favorite comics, Conor became a reader. (That <br/>
and a desperate desire to read Harry Potter on his own.)<br/>
<br/>
As far as easy-ish yet interesting books, have you tried the Magic Treehouse <br/>
series? Casey loves those. She also likes Nate the Great and anything with a <br/>
bit of a mystery in it. Conor liked The Zach Files.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

relatively cheap through Half.com (http://www.half.com)<br/>
