  &gt;Your comments remind me of Alfie Kohn.  A colleague of mine saw he do a <br/>
  &gt;keynote at a conference.  His message was sort of like this:<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;&quot;We want learning to be about trial and error, not reward and <br/>
  &gt;punishment.  R&P leads to dependence.  T&E leads to wisdom/freedom.<br/>
<br/>
  Funny. I keep meaning to read his books.  &lt;g&gt;  I tried one of them and <br/>
  didn&#39;t get into it. I&#39;ve meant to try again. But I guess I passed the test, <br/>
  and now I don&#39;t need to.  %^)<br/>

of what they do makes things worse.<br/>
