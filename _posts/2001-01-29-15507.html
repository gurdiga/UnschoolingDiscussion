<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101127931">Hi Ann,<br/>
I am currently living in VA, just over the NC border but am a native of<br/>
Charlotte.  I grew up there & lived just north of there in Mooresville for<br/>
10 yrs before moving to VA.  We are trying to get back, my husband is<br/>
job-hunting now.<br/>
<br/>
Although I have not actually homeschooled in NC I know that the laws are<br/>
easy.  You must keep attendance records and test each year, but you keep<br/>
those in a file rather than turn them in.  Also, you only need a high school<br/>
diploma and you only file once.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also sent out &quot;feelers&quot; for unschoolers since we hope to be moving<br/>
SOON.  There is a group in Gastonia which is about 20 minutes from<br/>
Charlotte.  There is a group in Winston Salem & one in Greensboro.  There<br/>
may be more, maybe in the Raleigh area.<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte is a great place, still has a small town feeling although it&#39;s<br/>
growing daily!  There is so much we miss now that we are in a very rural<br/>
area.  Luckily my family still live there so we get back often.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you need more info....you can write off-list if you like & I<br/>
will help all I can.  Good luck with your move.<br/>
Cindy</div>
