Welcome to the list. I dont post often, and I have of late been <br/>
lurking as i am not very happy with the recent discussions. However <br/>
dont let these present discussions put you off. The people here can <br/>
be very helpful - and we do have some good discussions too.<br/>
Are you unschooling and how many children do you have?  Do tell us a <br/>
little about yourself.<br/>
