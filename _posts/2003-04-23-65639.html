<div id="ygrps-yiv-56955851">I&#39;m so sorry to have posted that over and over!  Eeep!<br/>
<br/>
(So was I my own digest?  VERY very sorry, if so.)<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s about to leave to go to the gaming shop.  Kirby is at work (there).  <br/>
Holly is  at the park nearby playing with friends on the still-new playground <br/>
equipment.  I&#39;m all alone in a minute.  Woohoo!!!    I think I&#39;ll go rent a <br/>
chick-flick DVD and fold laundry.  (Big day for me. LOL!  but at 4:30 it&#39;s <br/>
drive Holly to fiddle, then Holly to another class, then go play music at <br/>
Jeff&#39;s house...  it&#39;s a small window.)<br/>
