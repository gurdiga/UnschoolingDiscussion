<div id="ygrps-yiv-978585049">I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll remember my despair of last week when Lars said he wanted<br/>
assignments and structure, etc.  Well, I gave him a few assignments - stuff<br/>
like read a chapter and write about it.  He decided to read Harry Potter,<br/>
and he wrote a little bit the first couple of days.  Since then, he doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to be able to tear himself away from the book.  I&#39;m *so* disappointed<br/>
that he won&#39;t do those writing assignments . . . not.<br/>

THAT IS GREAT! I am so happy for him- and you!<br/>
This whole reading thread has had me thinking about 11yo Katy.  I have<br/>
been her biggest hindrance about reading due to my own fears, doubts,<br/>
efforts to force feed it to her when she was younger....then my journey<br/>
to letting go of my &quot;schooly&quot; attitudes about it,  my wondering how I<br/>
have failed to lead her and inspire her to be a &quot;reader&quot;....giving her<br/>
that block that she had to be able to read it &quot;all&quot; or not be labeled a<br/>
reader.  Just the other day,  at a storytelling session, when asked who<br/>
liked reading, I noticed she was the ONLY one in the group (of 35) that<br/>
said she did NOT like reading...and the blame the teacher lies with me!<br/>
<br/>
So besides talking to her about my mistakes and letting her know that<br/>
she is a reader,  is there anything else I should do besides wait?<br/>
Maybe...that is just what I need to do - only respond to her inquiries.<br/>
And know that one day, like Lars,  she&#39;ll skate down the other side of<br/>
the hill into a great book.<br/>
