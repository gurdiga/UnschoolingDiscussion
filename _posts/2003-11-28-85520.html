My children have grown up hearing the story about the year when I was 10yo that I peeed in my mom&#39;s closet and found all my presents.  It was my worst Xmas ever - not a single surprise.  Like Mary, my mom didn&#39;t know until years later.  But my kids decided they didn&#39;t want to risk it, so they&#39;ve never really peeked (they do shake packages that are under the tree, tho!).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can at least share the stories of how some people are really disappointed when there are no surprises, then ask again if they want you to hold back at least an item or two.  If it&#39;s still &#39;no&#39; then they will have whatever natural consequence occurs for them (either disappointment in no surprises or maybe joy that they got to play with things sooner).  Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
Okay I read this many times trying to figure out: <br/>
<br/>
1) why a 10 year old was peeing in the closet? <br/>
and<br/>
2) how peeing in a closet could possibly cause a person to somehow <br/>
discover their hidden presents?<br/>
and<br/>
3) how the mom could NOT have noticed that a kid peed in her closet?<br/>
<br/>
AFTER I finished pondering, I reread and figured it must have been <br/>
peeked. DOH! ROFLMAO<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
