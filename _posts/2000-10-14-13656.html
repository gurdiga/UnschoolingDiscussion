&lt;&lt; I wonder how many people out there are homeschooling an only child.  I<br/>
 have a six year old boy that we unschool.  The older he gets the more<br/>
 self directed he gets.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

I do not have experience unschooling one child, although i do have one child, <br/>
who is 3 and we are commited to HS. We have been trying for another child for <br/>
about a year too.  I just turned 35 and feel we should have had success by <br/>
now (but who knows).  I guess I can&#39;t offer advice, as I have a younger child <br/>
than you, but i will say i have read anecdotals about HS families which <br/>
include vignettes about one child HS families, just because they do exist out <br/>
 there in the pool of homeschoolers.  Congratulations on helping your child <br/>
to be the self-directed learner he is.  <br/>
