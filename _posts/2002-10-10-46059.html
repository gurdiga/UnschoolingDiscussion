  Matilda is a great favorite around here!  James and the Giant Peach wasn&#39;t entirely accurate, either.  The BFG had the kids giggling though.  Debi<br/>
<br/>
    &gt; wants to search for movies based on Dahl books, beyond Willie<br/>
    &gt; Wonka.  <br/>
<br/>
    We thought Matilda was quite good and The Witches was quite bad, they<br/>
    changed the whole story.<br/>
