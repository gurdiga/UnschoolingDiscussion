<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857641925">To the question......&quot;How do they learn?&quot;<br/>
   I cannot pretend to know.  My oldest left school, at nine years <br/>
old, at barely a second grade reading level last year.  For the <br/>
entire summer and &quot;school&quot; year we have &quot;lived&quot;.   <br/>
       IN THE BEGINNING...... My questions regarding unschooling and <br/>
deschooling popped up here a few times and everyone helped me to <br/>
relax...reminding me that TIME was all that was needed. Thanks to you <br/>
all for those words of patience. Time is what I gave him. I never <br/>
told him to read a book.  HE NEVER PICKED A BOOK UP. He spent the day <br/>
in a grumpy bored state when we were home. He refused to take any <br/>
classes, watched TV ALOT and played playstation!! He would not play <br/>
with toys. He had never really played with toys. We continued to <br/>
live....going to lots of park days and field trips with our active <br/>
homeschool group, which he really enjoyed.  I also took his younger <br/>
brother to some classes that he had picked out...a science class and <br/>
a very relaxed music class (singing and craft based)   Sometime <br/>
passed and then Zachery (my oldest) asked to go to the music <br/>
class...which he now loves! Recently, Zach requested to attend a clay <br/>
class.  He also enjoyed it immensely and has gone a few times now.  <br/>
He has become a different person....I cannot explain it.  He will now <br/>
play with toys for hours.  DragonballZ figures and legos are his <br/>
current favorites. During the day the TV is rarely on (until <br/>
DragonballZ at 5:30!!).   He is HAPPY and content.  Today he picked <br/>
up &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and read it to me (two pages) He said it looked like <br/>
a cool book.  In those two pages he read words like respectable and <br/>
considered with no trouble at all. Then he put the book down and went <br/>
on his way!   <br/>
           HOW DO THEY LEARN????  They do...in their own time. It <br/>
took my son 6 months to find happiness and contentment....imagine <br/>
what can happen in a lifetime! <br/>
