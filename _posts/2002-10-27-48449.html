<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540863284">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else missing like half the messages by getting this list in digest<br/>
form?  Also words with arrows or brackets around them don&#39;t come through in<br/>
digest form.  For instances I couldn&#39;t see the *grin* on your post Sandra<br/>
after you said your were a Leo, if I had it would have read differently to me.<br/>
 Anyway I realized this after I got the last two digests and didn&#39;t recognize<br/>
half of the conversations.  Guess I&#39;ll have to start going to the webpage.<br/>

I just get e-mails.  That way I don&#39;t get the advertising pages at the <br/>
website, and I can delete threads I know I don&#39;t want to read.<br/>
