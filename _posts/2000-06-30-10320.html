<div id="ygrps-yiv-370441851">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you know I went to my first homeschooling meeting with <br/>
about 7 women the other night at a bookstore in Tucson.  They meet once a <br/>
month to have coffee and talk about stuff and it was wonderful... I didn&#39;t <br/>
get home till nearly 1am... The Sonoran Desert Homeschoolers (which is who <br/>
they are) encompasses from strict homeschooling to complete unschooling.  It <br/>
was wonderful to hear how each different person did this thing and how it <br/>
worked for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Strange also, that once I&#39;ve said I&#39;m doing this I&#39;ve had so many friends say <br/>
&quot;Oh so and so homeschools, I&#39;ll have to give you her number&quot;.  Also my <br/>
mother&#39;s helper that comes on Thursday afternoon&#39;s and is 14 told me her <br/>
mother is going to homeschool her as her grades are really bad (Alison, my <br/>
mother&#39;s helper, told me she hates school wants to be an actress and can&#39;t <br/>
see the point of learning things that are boring and not necessary)... I gave <br/>
her mother info about the Homeschooling organization here in Tucson.... It&#39;s <br/>
amazing how it just seems to mushroom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107978551">WOW, good for you Dawn, I&#39;m glad you found your niche&#39; in your new h-s<br/>
support group .... isn&#39;t it funny how people seem to come out of the<br/>
woodwork once you&#39;ve connected w/ the h-s community ...  I always tell<br/>
people when we started h-s&#39;ing we were the ONLY h-s fm we&#39;d ever met and now<br/>
we literally know 100s of h-s fms ...<br/>
<br/>
next Fri, our *new* h-s group is having a planning meeting and I&#39;m a little<br/>
apprehensive, too ... maybe we&#39;ll *gel* the way your group did &lt;SMILES&gt; ...<br/>
but goodness, I *HOPE* we don&#39;t work until 1am???  lol ...<br/>
<br/>
