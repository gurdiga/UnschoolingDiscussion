<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028088698">A good friend of mine from the NW recently put up her website.<br/>
One of the articles there is SO awesome and has a lot to do with respect for <br/>
children...anyway I wanted to share it with all of you.<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s a very special lady and someone I love dearly. An inspirational writer <br/>
and peaceful individual.<br/>
In the first paragraph of her website, it gives you a place to click for <br/>
reading recent magazine articles. If you go there, it&#39;s an opinion piece on <br/>
why you shouldn&#39;t read your children&#39;s journals. <br/>
Really cool. Read it!!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
