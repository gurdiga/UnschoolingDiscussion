<div id="ygrps-yiv-25073569">&quot;Nah, why would anyone intentionally leave a piece that they paid <br/>
for. <br/>
 Lots of that wood is sold by the linear foot, so the person who <br/>
bought <br/>
it and had it cut didn&#39;t pay for the leftovers.  If you buy one <br/>
that&#39;s <br/>
&quot;by the piece&quot; you should take the whole thing home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re buying lumber, but running our own <br/>
construction business has taught me a little bit about this. Lumber <br/>
is not sold by the linear foot, can you imagine what a mess that&#39;d be <br/>
for companies like Home Depot and Lowes?<br/>
They sell it by the piece and it comes in several different lengths, <br/>
for example,<br/>
4x4 posts come in 8,10,12,14 or 16 foot lenghts here.<br/>
2x4, 2x6, 2x8 etc...also come in 10, 12, 14 etc...foot lengths.<br/>
Anyone selling lumber by the linear foot would be an idiot.<br/>
There are some materials that sell by the linear foot, typical lumber <br/>
is not one of them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was just there (Home Depot)  yesterday, buying some trim for a <br/>
project, I cut 3 feet. My experience is that the cutting table located <br/>
in the store is smack-dab in front of the material that is sold by the <br/>
linear foot.   Of course, 2x4&#39;s, etc., are sold by the piece, but if <br/>
you&#39;re doing something with 2x4&#39;s you oughta wait until you get home <br/>
before you cut it, don&#39;t you think?  Measure twice, cut once?  <br/>
<br/>
The only situation I could think of where I would leave part of a 2x4 <br/>
behind (cutting at the store) is if I needed a piece of scrap to help me <br/>
attach something or fix something temporarily and I wasn&#39;t going to be <br/>
going home or something.  In those circumstances (and things like that <br/>
have happened to us!), I probably would buy the scrap anyway, if there <br/>
were a suitable one available, and wouldn&#39;t mind that I paid twice for <br/>
something someone already paid for.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is....if you do have your wood pre-cut at the store, <br/>
take it all with you if you paid for the whole piece!  lol.<br/>

<br/>
I should have qualified this statement better, I was specifically <br/>
referring to the big chains like Home Depot, not the little guys.<br/>
And I said typical lumber, not all lumber...sorry for not being more <br/>
clear.<br/>
That&#39;s why you get people needing 11 feet of something and buying a <br/>
12 foot piece and leaving the leftover, as the first poster suggested.<br/>
Happens all the time.<br/>
Check out your local fence/deck/construction type companies, they all <br/>
have a huge debris pile full of good stuff!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of you live where there is still an 84 Lumber...they used <br/>
to sell &quot;typical&quot; lumber by the linear foot.<br/>
Dh had to go get a huge 4x12x20 and cut it to the customers <br/>
specifications.<br/>
Even many lumber yards don&#39;t sell it this way anymore, but if you <br/>
need a special size, they are much better than Lowes or Home Depot.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of waste going on in our country....lumber is no <br/>
exception. Take advantage of those that don&#39;t want a bunch of scraps <br/>
sitting around and relieve them of their wood!! :)<br/>
Or marry a contractor and let him bring scraps home to you (which is <br/>
what happened in my case, lol)<br/>
