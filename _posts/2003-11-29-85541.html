It makes perfect sense to me. I think Joe and I have both gone through this<br/>
with Joseph. He&#39;s just not the &quot;typical&quot; boy we rather expected in a very<br/>
loose kind of way. He doesn&#39;t like to get dirty and he doesn&#39;t especially<br/>
like sports. He loves his sports camp one day a week for a few hours, but<br/>
that&#39;s as far as it goes. He&#39;s a perfectionist and that means sometimes he<br/>
won&#39;t even try something if he thinks he won&#39;t be perfect the first time.<br/>
He&#39;s not silly like some kids can be. He&#39;s a lot more serious minded. You<br/>
can&#39;t kid with him or joke with him like the other kids. (I&#39;m meaning ours)<br/>
He doesn&#39;t like surprises. He&#39;s always questioning everything all the time.<br/>
He comes up with tough questions. He&#39;s not at all easy going like the girls<br/>
are. It&#39;s hard sometimes to know what he needs.<br/>
 <br/>
But he&#39;s also very bright and engaging in conversation. He has us look at<br/>
things in ways we never have before. He&#39;s honest to a fault. He&#39;s also kind<br/>
and sensitive. He&#39;s very aware of things around him. Especially little<br/>
things. He has a memory to rival none and that comes in handy a lot.<br/>
Especially since Joe and I have lost ours lately! He hs an incredible<br/>
imagination and is so good at making up new games and coming up with<br/>
wonderful ideas. He plays so well with other kids and is especially kind and<br/>
sweet with his baby sister. He knows how to speak his mind without hurting<br/>
feelings. He&#39;s very comfortable being alone and playing or reading. He&#39;s<br/>
helpful to me when I ask and many times even when I don&#39;t. He loves the<br/>
family and he loves this house. He has a wonderul smile. And when you do<br/>
hear that laugh of his, as infrequent as it comes, it will make you laugh<br/>
out loud with joy. He&#39;s a great friend and a really cool kid to be around.<br/>
He is so much more than we could have hoped for. He&#39;s a wonderful son.<br/>
