&gt; Doesn&#39;t everyone feel a bit &quot;out of it&quot; when you come into something new?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can&#39;t expect to feel included in something when you&#39;ve just begun.  But<br/>
&gt; that doesn&#39;t mean the group is a clique.<br/>

But that&#39;s not what I wanted to say. Or wait, yes it is.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so when I first got &quot;into&quot; showing rabbits, I started going to shows<br/>
and what I did first was watch (I didn&#39;t enter any rabbits in the<br/>
competition, I just watched). I saw how judging works. I read some books and<br/>
internet sites on rabbit shows. I politely asked everyone around me all the<br/>
questions I had. I filed away information, taking what was useful and<br/>
sensible to me and leaving the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I bought some rabbits. Turns out, these rabbits didn&#39;t win everything in<br/>
site. I could have stomped off in a huff. Instead, I paid attention to the<br/>
judges&#39; comments on the rabbits and also on the ones who were winning. Then<br/>
I started writing (clerking) for the judges, and ramrodding (helping the<br/>
judges&#39; table run more smoothly). Doing this, in no time I knew all my<br/>
fellow exhibitors and they knew me as a person who would jump in and spend a<br/>
fairly gruelling four hours or so on her feet cheerfully keeping their show<br/>
running smoothly. They found me to be a fine person, a person who just like<br/>
them was willing to work for her fun.<br/>
<br/>
I bought some more rabbits, and this time they were better rabbits because<br/>
a) I&#39;d learned enough to go to the people with the really good stuff and b)<br/>
The people with the really good stuff WANTED to help me. They wanted me to<br/>
like showing rabbits because I turned out to be the kind of person it&#39;s fun<br/>
to show with and against.<br/>
<br/>
I could have bought some rabbits, complained they didn&#39;t win, bad-mouthed<br/>
the breeders I bought them from, sat on my large behind at shows with an &quot;I<br/>
paid my entry fee I don&#39;t have to work&quot; entitlement, and generally made<br/>
myself useless and unpleasant to everyone. I don&#39;t think other breeders<br/>
would be lining up to help me put together a nice barn of rabbits today if I<br/>
had that attitude.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the reason you now are part of the rabbit &quot;inner group&quot; is because<br/>
your primary interest was showing rabbits not fitting in. Since you didn&#39;t<br/>
care about fitting in, it didn&#39;t matter to you whether you felt &quot;in&quot; or<br/>
&quot;out&quot;. Since what you cared about was the information, you sought out ways<br/>
to get the information that also, as a side effect, brought you in contact<br/>
with people and made you a vital part of the group and you automatically fit<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true here and probably true of every group. The people who come here<br/>
seeking just information don&#39;t care if they&#39;re part of some &quot;inner circle&quot;<br/>
or fit in or not. They do what they need to do to get what they want. Those<br/>
who enjoy the purpose of the list, the deconstruction of ideas, writing<br/>
about and explaining unschooling, automatically become part of the &quot;inner<br/>
circle&quot; because that&#39;s all the &quot;inner circle&quot; is. It&#39;s just the people who<br/>
enjoy participating in the purpose of the list. Friendship comes as a side<br/>
effect of having found a place to share a common interest and passion.<br/>
