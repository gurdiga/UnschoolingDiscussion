&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve had to defend our decision not to start Katie <br/>
until she was eight, many times. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet you started her nine months before she was born!!<br/>
<br/>
You &#39;started her&#39; at eight!?<br/>
<br/>
(I know, the paragraph continued... &lt;g&gt;....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It matters not one whit to me that <br/>
she&#39;s &quot;behind grade level.&quot; She wasn&#39;t ready for formal <br/>
learning...but now this unschooling thing is telling me formal <br/>
learning isn&#39;t the way kids learn best, anyway. sheesh. see how ya <br/>
are? ;)&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First we try to get you to see how YOU are and then you won&#39;t be so grumpy <br/>
seeing how we are. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Ah! and herein lies the rub! *If* Robby pursues only what interests <br/>
him, he will be going from video to computer game, and back again to <br/>
the TV. Maybe I&#39;m not getting it, but surely an hour doing division <br/>
at the kitchen table is stretching his brain better than shooting <br/>
down asteroids on the computer for an hour? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AHA!!<br/>
NO!  An hour shooting down asteroids will lead to doing division if you leave <br/>
him alone for long enough.  And that will be way past when he&#39;s eight.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;*If* Robby pursues only what interests him, he will be going from video to <br/>
computer game, and back again to the TV. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two things:<br/>
<br/>
#1:   Maybe so.<br/>
#2:   You&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If  he only pursues what interests him, first take out the &quot;only.&quot;<br/>
If he pursues what interests him from now to the day he dies, he will learn <br/>
everything he needs to know.  And he will go from being a happy boy to being <br/>
a happy man, a happy father, a happy employee...<br/>
<br/>
And IF you let him to what interests him, it WILL be more than &quot;just&quot; video <br/>
to computer to TV.<br/>
<br/>
If you will let him do what he likes to do freely and without snorting or <br/>
clucking that there are better things (about which you might be entirely <br/>
wrong anyway), and IF after six months of that he is doing NOTHING but &quot;just&quot; <br/>
video, computer and TV, I will send you $20 and a fancy apology.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Okay. Does that description sound like unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was asked of the following description.  I hope you didn&#39;t make that <br/>
girl stop doing what she was interested in to &quot;do math,&quot; I don&#39;t care how <br/>
much sun was shining.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now that I&#39;ve said that, I&#39;m thinking about my 15 year old daughter. <br/>
She is a voracious and very good reader. Better at reading than I am, <br/>
and I&#39;m a GOOD reader. Because I am a Tolkien fan, I introduced The <br/>
Hobbit to her when she was seven. She ate it up. At age 10, she read <br/>
Lord of the Rings. She read it again. She immersed herself in Middle <br/>
Earth, checking out books of artwork by various artists, writing <br/>
about the strengths and weaknesses in the different characters of the <br/>
book, and of course, spent lots of time online chatting with other <br/>
Tolkien people, and looking forward mightily to the release of the <br/>
movie. I let her &quot;pursue her interest&quot;...and she followed it into <br/>
Medieval Europe, and British History. She knows who William the <br/>
Conqueror was, who was King in Britain when he landed. She knows what <br/>
the people were called who lived in England before the Saxons came. <br/>
She knows all about Arthur and Gueneviere and Camelot. She has read <br/>
all of Shakespeare&#39;s comedies, and is right now reading through <br/>
Canterbury Tales...again. She walks around speaking in different <br/>
English accents: Scottish, Irish, Australian, Cockney, Liverpool. A <br/>
true Anglophile, and it started at age 7, with The Hobbit.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  That&#39;s how unschooling works.<br/>
And math can work that way too unless parents prevent it from doing so.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My younger ones aren&#39;t proving to <br/>
be so verbally oriented. They do love their &quot;screen time&quot; though! <br/>
Movies, computer games, movies again. Seems mindless to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So they know more about those things than you do!<br/>
If you hang out with them and see what they&#39;re actually doing and thinking <br/>
and sharing, you will not think &quot;mindless&quot; anymore.<br/>
<br/>
When they see you reading this, does it look to them like you&#39;re just staring <br/>
mindlessly at a computer?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This has turned out way long. Sorry. I&#39;m more thinking aloud than <br/>
anything.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another excellent unschooling tactic!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t unschooling about NOT &quot;providing <br/>
an education&quot; but simply allowing kids their head, letting them go <br/>
where they will? Where does guidance and provision come into play?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since you and your husband met have you guided and provided for one another <br/>
in any way?  Or did you just make your vows and each allow the other to go <br/>
where you will, separately, alone?  If you have a friend with a similar <br/>
interest or hobby, do you share information or help?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What I meant by illiteracy is an overall inability to do basic skills <br/>
needed to have a life.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
We know. &lt;g&gt;  Often the answers here are given in a plain and literal way for <br/>
the purpose of showing you what you said in the stark plain vanilla way it&#39;s <br/>
hard to see when you&#39;re the one doing the agitated thinking.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;Robby&#39;s not telling time, for instance. I really want him to know analog <br/>
time...and he gets the general idea of it, but has to rely on digital clocks <br/>
to know what time it is. I hate <br/>
that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How old is Robby?<br/>
<br/>
One of the sweetest things among my kids was that the boys could only read <br/>
digital even up to the time when their younger sister could tell time, but <br/>
she could only read analog.  So when they were somewhere and  needed to know <br/>
the time, she might be the one to read it to the boys, or they might read it <br/>
to her, if it was digital.   That taught them a LOT about learning and <br/>
knowledge and the futility of depending on age for knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for various reasons, they can all tell time on all KINDS of clocks.  <br/>
They understand military time without effort.  I didn&#39;t teach them.  Had I <br/>
not just told you there was a time when they were &quot;behind&quot; (not behind <br/>
themselves, behind the imaginary &quot;them&quot;) and limited, and if you met them and <br/>
asked them the time,  you would never EVER know they weren&#39;t born telling <br/>
time (unless you thought about it and realized that everyone learns it in the <br/>
instant that they learn it, and no sooner and no later).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Katie isn&#39;t there yet, though we have been doing phonics <br/>
this year, and she&#39;s 8 and a half. I&#39;m confident it will come in <br/>
time, but it really is like holding my breath,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Phonics has been done to death. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Phonics was &quot;done&quot; before any of us were born.<br/>
Phonics, like mathematical notation, is an analysis of some everyday <br/>
information, written out in secret-style notation.<br/>
English has sounds, but Katie knows English.  She just needs to figure out <br/>
how to read that clock, and whether she reads analog first or digital, she <br/>
WILL learn to read English just like reading a clock.<br/>
<br/>
Do you want her to do it merrily and with no trauma whatsoever?<br/>
Any book he misses reading while she&#39;s nine, she can read when she&#39;s ten or <br/>
twelve, but she probably won&#39;t want to by then, or others will have read it <br/>
to her, or she&#39;ll be beyond the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;ike the one article <br/>
where a son didn&#39;t read until age 14! ack! ...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was Liam, right?  Wasn&#39;t he 16?  He&#39;s 18 now.  He was over here last <br/>
week and he&#39;ll be here Tuesday.  You wouldn&#39;t know he was a later reader if <br/>
you met him.<br/>
<br/>
His mom, Carol, got her first critical response to that article last week.  <br/>
(I won&#39;t send her your &quot;ack!&quot;)  The teacher who wrote to her said her <br/>
children must have missed some classic literature, and she named Clifford <br/>
books.  Are Clifford books classic literature now?  Are there messages in <br/>
there that a warm and loving homelife could totally leave out!?  Or are they <br/>
just better than other books at a similar &quot;reading level&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The goal for my teachers in fourth and fifth grades was to have students <br/>
who knew their times <br/>
tables. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But few of them and many adults have know idea what the &quot;table&quot; means in <br/>
&quot;times table,&quot; or what it all really MEANS.  It&#39;s something people <br/>
regurgitate without thought or real learning.<br/>
