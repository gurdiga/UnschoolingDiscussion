<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; These animal rights conversations have been very intersesting to me <br/>
&gt; and have made me realize a few things.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While some unschoolers might claim to allow their children to make <br/>
&gt; their own moral decisions and take their own paths in life, there are <br/>
&gt; probably very few who actually do.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whether she&#39;s a fundamentalist Christian who draws the line at reading <br/>
&gt; Harry Potter or a liberal pagan who who draws the line at animal <br/>
&gt; experimentation, most unschoolers do draw a line.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is probably very important to both moms that they pass on their <br/>
&gt; world views to their children, whether it is a Christian mom being <br/>
&gt; concerned that her child accept Christ as Savior and follow the Bible, <br/>
&gt; a atheist being concerned that her child  be accepting of all beliefs <br/>
&gt; and lifestyles, or a pagan who is concerned that her child consider <br/>
&gt; animals as important as humans.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ultimately, we have no control, whether we want it or not, over what moral <br/>
decisions our children make. They take what they have learned from us and <br/>
what they have discovered for themselves, and come to their own conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe anyone ever said that Unschooling families do not try to <br/>
communicate their values to their children. They do it by how they talk to <br/>
and treat their children and others, by the other people they hang out with, <br/>
and by the manner in which they tread on the earth. They do it by the limits <br/>
they set for their children (And I guarantee that every parent here sets <br/>
limits for their children. What they try not to do is to set arbitrary or <br/>
unreasonable limits.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741545379">Goodness! What a busy list!  Just finished catching up and there was <br/>
just one thing that caught my eye that has not been addressed by anyone <br/>
else (though after reading 99 e-mails, I might have missed something),<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;... I feel strongly that<br/>
&gt;I do not want toys in *my* home whose sole purpose is to enact wounding<br/>
&gt;and killing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t like it when my oldest was little but I soon realised that he <br/>
would only do it next door anyway, and besides it wasn&#39;t possible for me <br/>
to decide what he enjoyed playing.  I could enforce rules against him <br/>
playing what he wanted (by keeping him home, totally controlling his <br/>
environment), but I couldn&#39;t make him enjoy the things I felt were better.<br/>
<br/>
 But what I really wanted to ask was, does every member of your family <br/>
have their own separate home?  I doubt it.  I worry when one member of a <br/>
family claims the home as their own.  Our home is OUR home.  Our home <br/>
belongs to me. And to my dh.  And to my 14yo.  And to my 17yo.  And to <br/>
my 20yo.  And to my 23yo who physically lives two days drive away, for <br/>
him to return to whenever he wants..  And my daughter-in-law knows that <br/>
this is her home too, for her to return to whenever she wants.  And it <br/>
will always be a second home for my grandchildren.<br/>
<br/>
If one person is doing something that disturbs others in the family, we <br/>
discuss it, work it out, but I do not believe that our home is MINE and <br/>
that I therefore have the right to determine other people&#39;s learning / <br/>
playing / eating / singing / laughing / thinking etc etc.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I do not want toys in *my* home whose sole purpose is to enact wounding<br/>

<br/>
What might they want in their home?<br/>
Do they have to grow up and move out to have any say?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I try hard not to judge the decisions of others, though I<br/>
am only human and not always successful.  I hope this, too, this<br/>
unwillingness to be judgemental of other people, is a value I&#39;ll pass to<br/>
them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they want toy guns, won&#39;t you judge their decisions?<br/>
<br/>
That won&#39;t help them not judge others.  It will tell them something other <br/>
than you hope, I think.<br/>
<br/>
-=- And I said, &quot;You know honey, if you want to try it<br/>
it&#39;s okay with me.  I think you&#39;re old enough to choose whether to eat<br/>
animals or not,&quot; and she decided to be a meat eater. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called &quot;meat&quot; when it&#39;s on the plate, not &quot;animals.&quot;<br/>
That was a manipulative way to say it was okay with you if she wasn&#39;t <br/>
vegetarian, don&#39;t you think?   Kinda like calling venison stew &quot;Bambi stew&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-But what was<br/>
interesting was the discussion that came later - one value I&#39;ve tried to<br/>
share is the idea that all life is equal; we live in an intricate web<br/>
and no one life is more important than another.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you get mice in your kitchen will you decide their right to live there is <br/>
as great as yours?<br/>
<br/>
If not, what will you do?<br/>
<br/>
If so, why would mice have more rights in your house than your own children?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s rhetorical, and you don&#39;t have to tell us, but if no one life is more <br/>
important than another, are your children not special?  Special enough to play <br/>
with rubber knives?<br/>
<br/>
-=-When we discussed it<br/>
later, the choice of eating meat, I told her that if she wanted to try<br/>
other kinds of animals she&#39;d have to talk with her daddy or her<br/>
grandparents, because, I reminded her, I choose not to buy or cook them.<br/>
She looked out her windows and started a line of thought - &quot;I&#39;d like to<br/>
eat squirrels, and fish, and seagulls.  But I couldn&#39;t eat a cat,<br/>
because cats are people&#39;s pets. -=-<br/>
<br/>
See?  You had her thinking of eating seagulls?  <br/>
Why?  For the purpose of maybe discouraging her from eating meat by calling <br/>
it &quot;animals&quot;?   English has lots of words for reasons.  You knew that and you <br/>
chose to use that word?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Incidentally (was it Sandra?) had mentioned we have to kill to eat.  Not<br/>
true. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it was me, but I&#39;m used to being blamed with anything people <br/>
don&#39;t like to read.   <br/>
<br/>
-=- There are people who only eat food that does not require the<br/>
killing of a plant - for example, eating animal products that do not<br/>
require killing of animals, eating vegetables and fruits that do not<br/>
require death of a mother plant (eat a strawberry but not a potato;<br/>
broccoli but not a head of lettuce, etc.).  Not the lifestyle I lead,<br/>
but one that is possible.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I know, but it&#39;s contrived and unnatural.<br/>

<br/>
Even though meat may be what she needs to be healthy? Do you know her blood <br/>
type? Certain blood types require meat, while others are natural vegetarians. <br/>
It is natural for our bodies to crave what they need. Both of my daughters are <br/>
A blood types, and have never really liked meats. I am an O blood type, which <br/>
requires red meat to be healthy, and I naturally crave it. <br/>
I would never try to make them feel bad or manipulate them into eating what <br/>
isn&#39;t healthy for them. <br/>

I was going along, getting some very interesting ideas out of all <br/>
the discussions here, but this I have to disagree with. It reminded <br/>
me of someone who was on another list who had this same arguement. <br/>
She went on to say that she was horrified, when she was younger, at <br/>
the idea of the chickens they were eating being real chickens. Her <br/>
mother told her that they weren&#39;t the real chickens, they <br/>
were &quot;eating chickens&quot; and they were not the same thing. She said <br/>
that this is how she got over the idea of eating animals. THis I <br/>
find to be manipulative. In the above quote she was not calling <br/>
it &quot;bambi stew&quot; she was calling it animals, which is what they are. <br/>
I am not against eating animals, but changing the word to meat <br/>
doesn&#39;t change what it is.<br/>

If there&#39;s a hamburger on a plate, that is food.  It is meat.  It is not an <br/>
animal.<br/>
<br/>
People who eat chicken don&#39;t eat the beak and the feet and the feathers and <br/>
the guts.<br/>
They eat the meat.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not a change of word to call it meat.  That word is hundreds of years <br/>
old.  Maybe thousands.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me to be a change of words for the purposes of emotional <br/>
maniupulation, to call meat &quot;animals.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re in New Mexico, you risk hunta virusby being around the droppings of <br/>
infected deer mice, and bubonic plague from rodents and their fleas.  We&#39;re <br/>
smack in areas where infected mice have been found.  It&#39;s not just a bucolic <br/>
jaunt into &quot;the country&quot; to leave them where an owl can find them.  And they&#39;re <br/>
not always easy to catch alive and transport/outbreak.htm<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a drainage (once an arroyo, now a concrete-lined ditch) that was one <br/>
block from our old house and two from where we are now which is a conduit for <br/>
mice coming into Albuquerque from the mountains (&quot;the country&quot;?).   <br/>
