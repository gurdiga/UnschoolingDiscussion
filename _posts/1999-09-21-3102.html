<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048446464">When my husband and I first discussed homeschooling, I thought we had<br/>
agreed that he had to  be involved at least some nights by spending time<br/>
with our son, either reading or playing a game...whatever. I had hoped that<br/>
he might be willing to do the bedtime shift, thereby allowing me &quot;my time&quot;<br/>
earlier, so that we could spend quiet time together before midnight every<br/>
night. BUT that has not happened. Somewhere during the summer our routine<br/>
reverted to an older one: I take care of the homeschooling (daytime) and<br/>
bedtime while my husband does his thing and relaxes or fiddles on the<br/>
computer until our son is in bed (10 PM). I guess we need to revisit our<br/>
earlier HS discussions.<br/>

&gt;just during baseball season!  He will get used to it, he will find other cool <br/>
&gt;little people to snuggle with &lt;g&gt;.  And he will be loved and remembered as a <br/>
&gt;good Pop to his boys.  And he will be able to play a lot more now too and <br/>
&gt;have more fun.  I do think hubbies have to learn their are other ways to <br/>
&gt;relax and interacting with your family isn&#39;t work!  I don&#39;t get to play, I <br/>
&gt;have to work :o(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I may have gone to the opposite extreme here on being harsh with the hubby.  <br/>
&gt;But I know a lot of us homeschooling moms don&#39;t get the help and support we <br/>
&gt;need from our spouses to do this.   Asking Dad to take over bedtime routine, <br/>
&gt;even if we aren&#39;t working another job, isn&#39;t asking too much in my book.  We <br/>
&gt;do have to work on our partnership that we committed our lives to.  But that <br/>
&gt;partnership does have to work for her as well as him.<br/>
