<div id="ygrps-yiv-837420564">Just thought I&#39;d add that our three kids (7, 5, 2) share a room for several reasons -- <br/>
1) so we can have an office/computer room safe (in theory) from little fingers and tiny toy parts, <br/>
2) so that they can have a play/toy/TV (it&#39;s only hooked up for videos, which the select after checking with us first, but they do watch TV -- but that&#39;s another conversation, isn&#39;t it?)/project/party room that is open to the combined living/dining room area and open kitchen -- action central-- <br/>
3) so that they aren&#39;t separated from each other and forced to divvy up toys and other possessions. <br/>
<br/>
This last is the primary reason, of course. My friend thought that we were absolutely nuts to put the kids together that way -- she worried about their nakedness when they change clothes, etc. I tried to explain that if it&#39;s a bedroom and the others are activity-oriented rooms, then there is always a place they can go to chill out, rest, nap, read, or whatever. It&#39;s the quietest room in the house and has lush Florida vegetation right outside the window. We&#39;ve put a bunk bed and a toddler bed in there to maximize floor space. Just last night when I came home late from teaching a class, I went in to kiss them. I couldn&#39;t find the younger two in their beds -- they had climbed up and were snuggled on either side of their big sister. It was beautiful.<br/>
