&lt;&lt;   the only meat he will eat is chicken ( which <br/>
 is hard to &quot;whip up&quot; as a snack..) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be though.<br/>
You could buy the chicken breast strips, cook them in some olive oil and soy <br/>
sauce (just a touch, or whatever seasoning he&#39;d like) and store them in the <br/>
fridge in a zilock baggy.<br/>
Or just keep some chicken nugget type thing in the freezer, pop in as many as <br/>
you want to cook. Quick and easy.<br/>
Other protein type snacks include individual size yogurts, nuts, tofu (makes <br/>
a wonderful smoothie if you blend a little with frozen OJ , frozen fruit and <br/>
soy milk and you have a perfect protein treat) or cube tofu and fry it in <br/>
olive oil with some Spike seasoning, oatmeal, oat cookies, boiled eggs, <br/>
celery with peanut butter, boxes of soy milk ( they make individual size), <br/>
mini sandwiches, Quesadillas (make some ahead of time, cut into quarters and <br/>
keep in fridge), .....<br/>
You get the idea. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354775412">Perdue makes little frozen chicken nuggets in shapes that my kids <br/>
love in a pinch. I always keep them on hand and they can be cooked in <br/>
the over in 11 minutes. Someone else, I forget who also makes regular <br/>
cut up chicken, frozen in a resealable bag. It comes seasoned. I <br/>
always keep that on hand to throw into some pasta salad on last <br/>
minute notice. It deforsts really fast and is pretty good to have <br/>
quick.<br/>
