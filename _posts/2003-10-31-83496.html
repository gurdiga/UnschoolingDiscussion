<div id="ygrps-yiv-947259037">KIDS SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH TV, <br/>
COMPUTERS & VIDEO GAMES <br/>
AS PLAYING OUTSIDE<br/>
<br/>
Even the very youngest children in America are growing up immersed in<br/>
media, spending hours a day watching TV and videos, using computers <br/>
and playing video games, according to a new study released today by the <br/>
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.  <br/>
<br/>
Children six and under spend an average of two hours a day using screen <br/>
media, about the same amount of time they spend playing outside, and well over the <br/>
amount they spend reading or being read to. <br/>
<br/>
Key findings include: One in four children under two have a TV in their <br/>
bedroom; Children in &quot;heavy&quot; TV households are less likely to read; Parents believe <br/>
in educational value of TV and computers. &quot;It&#39;s not just teenagers who are <br/>
wired up and tuned in, its babies in diapers as well,&quot; said Vicky Rideout, the <br/>
lead author of the study.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;So much new media is being targeted at infants and toddlers, it&#39;s critical <br/>
that <br/>
we learn more about the impact it&#39;s having on child development.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I thought maybe the study was misleading because some children in the <br/>
age group studied sleep in their parents&#39; bedroom.  And, of course, lots <br/>
of kids share bedrooms with siblings, who might be older.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of middle sized kids (in the US) end up with the old TVs in their <br/>
bedrooms, but I *do* have a hard time imagining someone who would buy a <br/>
bedroom TV for their toddler.  My 9 year old has our 20 year old set in <br/>
his bedroom to use as a Nintendo screen.  It isn&#39;t hooked up to receive <br/>
any channels.  I don&#39;t know how this would be reported on a survey.<br/>
<br/>
Are TVs cheaper in the US?  In the UK do you pay special taxes on the TV <br/>
set?<br/>

<br/>
In our case, our two youngest 2.5 and 11 months have a TV in their <br/>
bedroom.  But, then they share that bedroom with us as we family bed! <br/>
LOL!<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve yet to see any of *my* children sit for more than 5 minutes <br/>
at a time when they are under 4 to watch ANY kind of TV programming, <br/>
including their favorite videos.<br/>
<br/>
What-EVERRRR...<br/>

<br/>
OH!  The woman I saw on TV cited that but in a better-than-average move she <br/>
said that&#39;s not necessarily causation. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ABSOLUTELY in my experience as a kid those my age who were not readers THEN <br/>
and therefor watched more TV.  I used to turn the TV off to go read.  Friends <br/>
of mine who weren&#39;t good at reading or who had had all the reading they could <br/>
stand in school still wanted input, but many of them preferred visual or <br/>
auditory input.  <br/>
<br/>
People who believe what Howard Gardner has written about multiple <br/>
intelligences will remember that not everyone prefers verbal input (written or aural).  <br/>
Not everyone thinks primarily in words.  <br/>
<br/>
To say kids who watch TV don&#39;t read could just as easily and more sensibly be <br/>
switched to kids who don&#39;t like to read do like to watch TV.   A person who&#39;s <br/>
reading a book is less likely to be watching TV.  That does NOT mean that a <br/>
person who turns off a tv is going to pick up a book any more than she&#39;s likely <br/>
to ride a bike or take a shower or paint a picture.<br/>

<br/>
We have one we bought used twelve years ago from an co-worker of Keith&#39;s who <br/>
was leaving the state.  It&#39;s been repaired twice in the past year.  We will <br/>
need to buy a new one.<br/>
<br/>
When Keith was living  in MN, he bought a small one with VCR built in.  <br/>
That&#39;s in our bedroom.   Holly has one we inherited from an elderly neighbor. She <br/>
had it in the nursing home.  Marty&#39;s was given to us by someone who cleared out <br/>
a rental storage.  Kirby&#39;s...   We bought it but I don&#39;t remember when.  It&#39;s <br/>
pretty small.  <br/>
<br/>
But nowadays big color TVs with front hookups for video games and such are <br/>
$130, $200.<br/>
<br/>
In the UK houses are smaller and a lot of the bedrooms I saw didn&#39;t have much <br/>
room for a TV.  I saw kids have small computers, but I only saw a few <br/>
kid-rooms.<br/>

can hardly GIVE them away!  We even had them plugged in and turned on to<br/>
show they work, but no one would buy them.  Go figure.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if anyone is taking a survey on this list, but my<br/>
contribution is this:<br/>
<br/>
We have a TV with X-box in the living room, my old TV from my single<br/>
days, with a DVD player in the shared bedroom for all to use, both<br/>
connected to Dish Network, and Jayn has a small combo TV/DVD in the<br/>
bedroom on her crib (never used as sleeping place)unconnected to dish.<br/>
We purchased the latter in the insane hope that she might just put her<br/>
own DVD&#39;s on by herself more often. Needless to say, she is just like<br/>
the rest of the family in preferring a bigger screen most of the time.<br/>
She uses it sometimes. Her favorite stuff is recorded in the Dish<br/>
receiver in the living room, so that is what she watches when it is TV.<br/>
For DVD&#39;s it usually depends on where Dad is, and if he wants to watch<br/>
the news etc. Lately Jayn has been asking me to read her stories more<br/>
often than ever. She is also pulling books from her shelves that have<br/>
not interested her before - latest enthusiasm - Beatrix Potter.<br/>
