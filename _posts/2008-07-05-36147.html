<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379193834">I am new to unschooling and I have questions about some tricky stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Like, how do I trust my kids to eat a healthy diet when I don&#39;t myself!<br/>
<br/>
When I joined this family, the oldest had hypoglycemic symptoms. I have <br/>
tried to show him that eating less refined flour and sugar in his diet <br/>
frees him from this metabolic condition, and he has proved this to <br/>
himself, but it&#39;s hard not to want what all his friends, family (and <br/>
everyone on TV) is eating. Since we&#39;ve been homschooling his activity <br/>
level has dropped and he is becoming pudgy--like everyone in his family <br/>
(including me)!<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned about diabetes.<br/>
<br/>
Recently we switched to a &quot;meat and vegetables&quot; diet. We switched to <br/>
juice instead of drinks with added sugar. When we bought some sugar <br/>
drinks the oldest said he no longer liked them because we&#39;ve been <br/>
drinking juice and they no longer tasted good to him. I believe this <br/>
would happen with most of the less healthy foods if he ever experienced <br/>
a diet full of less processed meat, vegetables and fruits that had real <br/>
flavor (good, fresh, flavorful, fruits and vegetables and meats).<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s never had this experience at home OR when he was eating two meals a <br/>
day at public school. He&#39;s used to a high-carb, low protein and low <br/>
vegetable diet. We tend to eat like typical Americans: grab &quot;convenient&quot; <br/>
packaged meals, chips, soda, etc. where most of the flavor was made in a <br/>
food lab. Lots of pasta and potatoes and breads. And so does everyone <br/>
else in the kids&#39; extended family.<br/>
<br/>
How can I trust the kids when I don&#39;t trust myself?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts would be welcome,<br/>

<br/>
Did anyone say &quot;trust your kids to eat a healthy diet&quot;?  I want to  <br/>
see where the first step is on this path you&#39;ve envisioned before I  <br/>
walk it.<br/>
<br/>
Without choices, no one can make a choice.  Have you thought about  <br/>
why you make the food choices you make?  Do you think your kids will  <br/>
have those same factors in their life?  Can you figure out how to  <br/>
make sure they DO have whatever reactionary thoughts or neediness you  <br/>
have that influences your food choices?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s me:  I love chocolate and I can point to MANY things in my  <br/>
life that gave me the feeling that when I was grown I would eat  <br/>
chocolate if I wanted to.  I can go a long time without any, but  <br/>
sometimes I binge.  Not one of my children has ever, once binged on  <br/>
chocolate.  Something&#39;s different.<br/>
<br/>
-=--=-Like, how do I trust my kids to eat a healthy diet when I don&#39;t  <br/>
myself!-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
When you ask a question, consider an alternative.  Not &quot;the  <br/>
alternative,&quot; because there&#39;s more than one, but for instance if you  <br/>
say &quot;but what if we homeschool and my child is still unhappy?&quot;  I&#39;d  <br/>
want to say &quot;If you leave him in school will she be happy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have no guarantees, but we can help you see alternatives from  <br/>
which choices can be made.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
-=-Like, how do I trust my kids to eat a healthy diet when I don&#39;t  <br/>
myself!-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you choose not to trust them (not to give them choices), how will  <br/>
they eat a healthy diet when you don&#39;t yourself?<br/>

Hypoglycemia needs protein.  Instead of showing him what he should  <br/>
avoid, it would be happier, more positive and more honest to show him  <br/>
what he does need to eat--what will help.  Make a list, or always  <br/>
bring a couple of things when you shop.  String cheese, nuts, peanut  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460243622">I&#39;ve noticed that if my children are hungry and I haven&#39;t prepared <br/>
something for them to eat, they eat whatever is handy in the <br/>
kitchen.  If I buy a lot of bread and marshmallows and chips, and not <br/>
much in the way of veggies, then they won&#39;t be eating much in the way <br/>
of veggies.  I know that sounds simple, but I sometimes have to <br/>
remind myself!  When I grocery shop, I probably buy about 80% produce <br/>
and 20% other stuff.  And I try to buy veggies that are grabbers: <br/>
cucumbers, red or orange bell peppers, carrots, fruit, nuts.  My 17yo <br/>
just told me I need carrots actually.  He also lets me know if I need <br/>
to buy sandwich meat since I don&#39;t tend to eat it myself!LOL  They&#39;re <br/>
so happy and gracious if I ask if they&#39;d like me to make something <br/>
for them: a sandwich or tortilla wrap, which I put lots of extras in <br/>
like romaine and cucumber, baby spinach, etc.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think you need to &quot;launch&quot; a new eating program up front, but <br/>
try incorporating better choices in general.  Make good nutritious <br/>
meals, and I bet they&#39;ll eat it up!  caviat: my son has sensory <br/>
stuff, so he only wears clothes with certain feels and he eats <br/>
according to texture a lot.  So just any nutritious meal ain&#39;t gonna <br/>
do it!LOL  But I know what he does and doesn&#39;t like, so I make things <br/>
for him without onions or mushrooms.  He likes cooked broccoli but <br/>
not raw.  He often doesn&#39;t eat the main dish that we&#39;re having, but <br/>
he&#39;ll eat the rice, or the broccoli, or the green beans (if they&#39;re <br/>
cooked to the right texture)...<br/>
If figuring out what to buy and make overwhelms you, you might <br/>
consider finding a place for food support.  Look for recipe groups <br/>
online, or start googling!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Robin,<br/>
When I read this sentence all I could hear was Shaggy&#39;s voice ... <br/>
<br/>
But seriously, I do think that kids&#39; diets will reflect our diets to <br/>
some extent.  I do notice that my kids&#39; tend to eat a more diverse <br/>
diet when I am tending to eat a more diverse diet.  <br/>
<br/>
However, they also have their own likes that have nothing to do with <br/>
mine nor my DH&#39;s diet.  I never eat marshmellows for breakfast and I <br/>
can&#39;t stand boiled eggs -- my 3 year old regularly has marshmellows <br/>
and sliced boiled egg slices for breakfast (I shudder as I write that <br/>
down).  I don&#39;t really like popsicles, my kids love them.  I love <br/>
scrambled eggs with loads of stuff mixed in, none of my kids can <br/>
stand their eggs that way (cheese maybe, dd will do ham sometimes, <br/>
maybe).  <br/>
<br/>
I think that an important part of unschooling for me, so far, has <br/>
been has been learning to give myself the freedom to trust _myself_ <br/>
around issues like food, tv, and computer.  While I easily saw the <br/>
advantage of letting go and really trusting my children, that process <br/>
really served as a magnifying glass on my own personal/self trust <br/>
issues.  It was and is such a great opportunity for me to continue my <br/>
own growth and developement as a human being.  And, just as you can <br/>
imagine how empowering it is for the kids in our lives to make free <br/>
choices, imagine how empowering it will be for you to give up your <br/>
judgements and critical views of your own diet?  <br/>
<br/>
For me, a great weight lifted off my shoulders when I (sincerely and <br/>
honestly) stopped critically judging eveything that I ate:  Oh, I ate <br/>
healthy today, or I shouldn&#39;t have had that second bowl of icecream, <br/>
or I wish I ate more green vegies they are so healthy.  I am not sure <br/>
if I eat more or less *healthy* than I did before, but I feel great <br/>
and I feel healthy and I really just enjoy my food.  I haven&#39;t done <br/>
this *for* my kids, but in writing this down I can really see how <br/>
shifting my interactions with and internal conversations about food <br/>
is super positive for them.  (I found Byron Katie&#39;s The Work <br/>
thework.com incredibly helpful in jumpstarting and solidifying this <br/>
process.) <br/>

side of this discussion...Talk about food hang-ups!<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, we do teach our kids what to eat (parents have complete <br/>
control over what a 2-year-old has access to or not). OTOH, I can see <br/>
that too limited an offering of choices, especially with older kids, <br/>
limits their ability to figure out how to make choices that work for <br/>
them. This makes sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just a newbie and trying to figure out where the best balance is. I <br/>
don&#39;t think anyone hands whiskey to a 2-year-old! But the kids hate it <br/>
when I take all the &quot;fun&quot; foods out of the house, too.<br/>

around me is. (There&#39;s spouse issues in here, too!) But I don&#39;t like the <br/>

I can see I&#39;ve got a lot more thinking to do on this...<br/>

<br/>
I could also ask for their help in avoiding the foods I tend to binge <br/>
on--it&#39;s hard for me to not eat them when other&#39;s are eating them around <br/>
me. Maybe we could talk about the different foods we like and tend to <br/>
have in the house and make choices (like pasta and doughnuts get me, but <br/>
hot cheetos don&#39;t. Maybe the kids would be willing to not eat doughnuts <br/>

and had special dispensation to eat them whenever he needed (tho&#39; <br/>
sometimes he had to do it in the nurse&#39;s office, I think). He knows that <br/>
when he eats more protein his body works better, but eating candy all <br/>
day also works for hypoglycemics. If you just eat sugar every couple <br/>
hours (or more) you never &quot;crash&quot;, but it makes the hypoglycemia more <br/>
brittle (you have to eat sugar more and more often or you crash). <br/>
Eventually, diabetes is a real possibility. Kids as young as 7 are <br/>
getting &quot;adult onset&quot; diabetes these days (Type II).<br/>
<br/>
I think some of my &quot;issues&quot; are also step-parent stuff. I wasn&#39;t there <br/>
when he was a toddler and had no input to the diet he got used to (or <br/>
the girls either for that matter--the youngest was about to turn 3 when <br/>
I joined the family). My significant other would tend to snack all <br/>
day--always with a soda open--only eating a meal at dinner, if anyone <br/>
feels like cooking one except for negotiations between us. This seems <br/>
horribly unhealthy to me and I don&#39;t like how I feel when I eat that <br/>
way. The kids, of course, want to live off soda and chips, mainly, with <br/>
maybe some pastry and candy thrown in for good measure &lt;grin&gt;. They are <br/>
used to eating this way and their mom eats this way (she rarely eats <br/>
protein) and I&#39;m just a big meany for trying to give them a more healthy <br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>
When we substituted fruit juice for sugary drinks the boy (13) actually <br/>
didn&#39;t like the drinks he&#39;d liked before. He said they tasted funny now <br/>
that he was used to the juice. I know from personal experience that the <br/>
same thing happens when I just eat fresh veggies and meats (avoiding <br/>
processed and convenient foods that are mostly flavored by stuff they <br/>
make in labs). But it doesn&#39;t work (at least for me) if I&#39;m also eating <br/>
processed foods at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like the kids haven&#39;t had the option to find this out for <br/>
themselves because the foods they have not been exposed to healthier <br/>
options. And when I try to give them that option I&#39;m just an odd-ball!<br/>

side of this discussion...Talk about food hang-ups!-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a tool for you.  We just made a list lately of ways to screw  <br/>
up unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/screwitup">http://sandradodd.com/screwitup</a><br/>

<br/>
We could have made a list of ways to screw up a marriage, but we  <br/>
don&#39;t need to.  That list will work for many purposes.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe look at that link and imagine it a list of ways to give kids  <br/>
food issues.  Then you&#39;ll have a list in your head of what not to do!<br/>
<br/>
-=-On the one hand, we do teach our kids what to eat -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you?  I advise against that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-(parents have complete control over what a 2-year-old has access  <br/>
to or not)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you really?  TRULY?  I seriously advise against over-controlling  <br/>
what a two year old eats too, or can&#39;t eat.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, mid-70&#39;s, I was babysitting my all-natural niece, and we  <br/>
lost her.  She was in the garden, between thick rows, with an open  <br/>
sack of sugar, shovelling it in with both hands.  She was five or so.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is allowed to eat a sugar packet at a restaurant, or to  <br/>
play with (and maybe taste or eat) sugar cubes, or allowed to have  <br/>
more sugar on oatmeal or cereal if she wants it, instead of being  <br/>
told &quot;no&quot; or &quot;you have enough&quot; or &quot;sugar is bad,&quot; then I bet she will  <br/>
never, EVER squat in the field over a four lb. bag of sugar hoping to  <br/>
load up before she&#39;s caught.<br/>
<br/>
-=-OTOH, I can see that too limited an offering of choices,  <br/>
especially with older kids, limits their ability to figure out how to  <br/>
make choices that work for them. This makes sense to me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;ve made choices since they were two, since they were babies,  <br/>
there is no &quot;especially with older kids&quot; time coming.<br/>
<br/>
If babies can nurse or not when they want to, if they can reach for  <br/>
food or turn their head to refuse it, that&#39;s the start of their  <br/>
choicemaking and of parents&#39; trust.    It&#39;s no good to control or  <br/>
force or forbid and then at some point decide they&#39;re old enough to  <br/>
decide.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t think anyone hands whiskey to a 2-year-old! -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you see only two choices (full control or giving them shots of  <br/>
whiskey), your world is too small.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-489764885">-=-I could also ask for their help in avoiding the foods I tend to binge<br/>
on--it&#39;s hard for me to not eat them when other&#39;s are eating them around<br/>
me. ... Maybe the kids would be willing to not eat doughnuts<br/>
in front of me -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make the kids codependent on you.  That&#39;s no good at ALL.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make it their responsibility to keep you on your chosen diet.   <br/>
They&#39;re kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-but they&#39;d choose chips over fruit if we had the chips in the  <br/>
house.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unless you keep chips and fruit both, they&#39;re unable to choose at all.<br/>
<br/>
If chips and donuts are forbidden, they will want them, dream of  <br/>
them, seek them out, eat LOTS when you&#39;re not there.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t set foods up with values that way.  Learn to choose in the  <br/>
moment.  It will be way easier for your kids if they start not, than  <br/>
if they wait until they&#39;re as old as you are.<br/>
<br/>
-=-eating candy all day also works for hypoglycemics.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Works&quot; meaning what!?  Sorry--that doesn&#39;t even make sense.  If he&#39;s  <br/>
losing the ability to focus, or getting a headache, candy won&#39;t help  <br/>
a bit, but protein will.  When I was young I had audio distortions  <br/>
from no protein (I was being a poor college student vegetarian in a  <br/>
shared house of stoners), and boiled eggs and nuts were like miracle  <br/>
food.  Cheese was like spinach for Popeye.  When Kirby was little, he  <br/>
was having scary feelings and we figured out it was similar audio  <br/>
distortions.  Not hallucinations, not hearing things that weren&#39;t  <br/>
there, but hearing things in &quot;wrong&quot; ways (and sometimes seeing  <br/>
things in distotred ways, like from a high angle, which some people  <br/>
like to think of as an indication of out-of-body experience, but  <br/>
protein will fix that too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Try more protein snacks.  It will probably help anyone, and will keep  <br/>
people from getting hungry enough to feel they &quot;need&quot; a bunch of  <br/>
chips, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-520250974">So one of the items on the &quot;how to screw up&quot; list is something like <br/>
&quot;place restrictions on the TV they watch&quot;. I need some help finding <br/>
balance with this one, too.<br/>
<br/>
TV was basically my father&#39;s &quot;drug of choice&quot; (when my mom cut off his <br/>
money (that he was earning) so he could no longer drink heavily--how&#39;s <br/>
THAT for co-dependent! And he let her). It&#39;s also my kid&#39;s mother&#39;s <br/>
&quot;drug of choice&quot; (it&#39;s pretty much all she does, she&#39;s on disability and <br/>
sits at home watching TV more or less 24/7). So my concern is that <br/>
damage has been done, perhaps, and how do I help find a healthier <br/>
balance for the kids so they have the option to choose it if they want to?<br/>
<br/>
For example, when I met the family the 4-year-old&#39;s favorite movie was <br/>
the &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. The 2-year-old liked it a lot, too. <br/>
Now, I personally love that movie and think it&#39;s healing for those of us <br/>
with constrained and self-hating sexuality (and who in our culture isn&#39;t <br/>
in some ways?). BUT this was in a context where none of the kids were <br/>
being talked to about sexuality or bodies--they were seeing it on <br/>
TV/videos but it was completely taboo to discuss it or help them in any <br/>
way figure out about it. The idea was that kids aren&#39;t sexual at all and <br/>
have no feelings like that so it&#39;s harmless to show them adult sexuality.<br/>
<br/>
Then they were sent to school and to play with kids whose parents were <br/>
religious and they imitated what they saw in the movies and everyone <br/>
freaked out! The youngest is nearly shunned in the small town where we <br/>
lived for years (and their Granny still lives so we visit often), I <br/>
think in part because parents think she&#39;s going to be (what they <br/>
consider for religious reasons) physically inappropriate with their <br/>
kids. The kids in one family even started calling her the devil and <br/>
running away whenever they saw her. So, ok, were moving to a new <br/>
community (at least that&#39;s the plan!) where we will hopefully find more <br/>
appropriate playmates for all the kids, but I&#39;d like some help figuring <br/>
out how best to help the kids grow into healthy adult sexuality and lives.<br/>
<br/>
Providing X-rated movies for the pre-pubescent is one extreme that I <br/>
assume everyone would agree isn&#39;t a good idea (although it is becoming a <br/>
genuine question for the 13-year-old boy, or at least the idea of <br/>
Playboy is on the table). Never letting them see any hint of love or <br/>
sexuality would be the other extreme, I guess. How do I find a happy <br/>
medium where I am not stifling their ability to choose but I&#39;m not doing <br/>
injury to their developing selves either? (and I&#39;m not even talking <br/>
about the horror movies they were forced to watch as toddlers!)<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere on the continuum are hip-hop and rap videos that emphasize <br/>
what would have been considered soft-porn when I was a kid. It feels <br/>
good to watch them! But do they help either the boy or the girls develop <br/>
self-esteem based on anything but external appearance and whether they <br/>
are &quot;hot&quot; or not? I&#39;m not saying not ever letting them participate in <br/>
popular media-driven culture, but how do I find balance and provide <br/>
genuine alternatives when what they have been exposed to feels so good?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to understand the continuum (the gray in between) and <br/>
find the right balance for the complex situation we&#39;re in (partly <br/>
because of my unhealed food issues, but also because of other factors).<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t saying we should over control what a 2-year-old eats but I also <br/>
don&#39;t think anyone would agree that 2-year-olds need to experience the <br/>
choice of whiskey or they wont be able to handle it later.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen my friend&#39;s 2 and 3 year old being given the choice of soda, <br/>
candy and whatever he wants, and he never eats meals with the family and <br/>
actually steals candy on the rare occasions he is told &quot;no&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;back to the beginning of post&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s what started this question for me. Reading the posts <br/>
about what&#39;s on the list mostly made sense to me, but they also included <br/>
items that implied to me that NO restrictions or limitations should be <br/>
placed on either food or TV. Those were the only two on the list that <br/>
stuck for me. I think because I have a family history of what seems to <br/>
me like addictive behavior around both.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve started a new topic to talk about TV so as not to get to complex here.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I place WAY too many restrictions and I am learning some <br/>
good suggestions for how I can relax more and trust more. I&#39;d say I&#39;m <br/>
looking for help in the De-Schooling phase, I guess. And I see my <br/>
comfort level with freedom as a good chunk of what I&#39;m working on, I <br/>
hear that and want to do my best.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m in a situation where the kids I am now raising have been in less <br/>
restricted environments and I feel in a way that they have never had a <br/>
healthier option available as a choice. So part of de-schooling in our <br/>
situation, I&#39;m thinking (perhaps wrongly, I admit), is figuring out how <br/>
to let them truly experience healthier options so they then actually <br/>
have something to choose between.<br/>

partly from other family influences (not to mention that their mother is <br/>
bulimic). How do I help both them and me heal (WITHOUT making them <br/>
co-dependent!)<br/>
<br/>
For example, the youngest was not quite 3 when I met the family. The <br/>
mother rarely spoke to her except with extreme hostility in her voice <br/>
(she was severely depressed at the time) but when the little girl cried <br/>
she was given sugar (soda or candy or the like). This mollified her and <br/>
years later (at 5 and 6) when upset the girl would say &quot;I just need <br/>
candy and I&#39;ll feel better&quot;. BTW when a toddler she would have a &quot;sugar <br/>
reaction&quot; resulting in lots of energy which caused more hostile <br/>
reactions...and the cycle continued (one night the mother gave the 3 <br/>
year-old an entire can of soda then tried to make her go to <br/>
bed--threatening to beat her with a belt if she didn&#39;t &quot;lie down and got <br/>
to sleep&quot;--my SO and I intervened, taking her into our room where she <br/>
bounced on the bed with her eyes literly bugged out for a full 45 minutes!)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d agree. But on the other hand, what about &quot;if your good, I&#39;ll give <br/>
you a candy bar&quot; or even presenting sugary foods as desirable treats? <br/>
I&#39;m not sure I made up my own mind about candy--it was a &quot;prize&quot; and so <br/>
I experienced it as such. If we actually freely tasted a lot of American <br/>
candy it&#39;s so sweet it almost hurts. I was given value judgments <br/>
(positive ones) about sweets before I had the opportunity to form my own <br/>
opinions. And, yeah, I&#39;m really mad at my mother for that (kidding!)<br/>

 &gt; -=-OTOH, I can see that too limited an offering of choices,<br/>
 &gt; especially with older kids, limits their ability to figure out how to<br/>
 &gt; make choices that work for them. This makes sense to me.-=-<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; If they&#39;ve made choices since they were two, since they were babies,<br/>
 &gt; there is no &quot;especially with older kids&quot; time coming.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree wholeheartedly! Next time around I am doing things sooo differently!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>
 &gt; If babies can nurse or not when they want to, if they can reach for<br/>
 &gt; food or turn their head to refuse it, that&#39;s the start of their<br/>
 &gt; choicemaking and of parents&#39; trust.    It&#39;s no good to control or<br/>
 &gt; force or forbid and then at some point decide they&#39;re old enough to<br/>
 &gt; decide.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sure wish kids came with a practice round. I have learned so much <br/>
about myself and how not to do what I always planned not to do by <br/>
looking back over what I did do. Is there a &quot;do over&quot; button?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I feel like I&#39;m just figuring out how to be really good with 4 and <br/>
5 year olds and my youngest is turning 9 in two weeks! Yikes! I totally <br/>
hear you when you talk about how urgent &quot;getting&quot; this stuff is. I <br/>
blinked and my pre-schoolers are pubescent!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for giving me a place where I can talk about my doubts and <br/>
struggles to be better for my kids.<br/>

What do you think you are doing (right?) that you think has resulted in <br/>
your kids making healthier food choices?<br/>
<br/>
Neighbor kids had no food restrictions and constantly ate snack foods <br/>
and candy. The 11 year old is slightly pudgy and frequently mentions how <br/>
often she throws up (like, &quot;I wont drink apple juice because I once <br/>
drank so much I threw up&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the question is how do I present healthy choices and make them <br/>
appealing so they have a fighting chance? I especially have trouble with <br/>
vegetables and protein foods.<br/>

Hi Robin,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to pull out a few of the things that you have written <br/>
and let you look at them *out of context*.  You seem to be coming <br/>
from a place of a lot of judgement and fear.  You have a very <br/>
specific idea of what healthy food is and judge all foods based on <br/>
this opinion.  You seem to have a very specific concept of what a <br/>
healthy body looks like, and based on this, judge your step-son&#39;s and <br/>
everyone else in families&#39; food choices and activity levels.   <br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of contradictory information and research about what <br/>
defines *healthy* foods and *healthy* bodies.  What is healthy for <br/>
one person may not be healthy for another.  Just because the media <br/>
has created a certain image of what a healthy body looks like, <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it is the truth.  Sometimes &quot;pudgy&quot; can be way better <br/>
from a health perspective than thin.  Adolescents often gain weight <br/>
and sleep a lot, but it has nothing to do with their diet per se, but <br/>
a whole lot to do with hormones and growth.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, it feels like that you assume that since you have certain &quot;hang-<br/>
ups&quot; about food your step kids must also have the same issues.  From <br/>
what you have written it feels like you believe that you have to <br/>
either totally control yourself or you totally lose control of <br/>
yourself.  Since you are looking for and expecting this same <br/>
phenomena in your kids you find evidence to support it and ignore <br/>
evidence to the contrary.  For example, you say that your kids will <br/>
choose chips over fruit, like this is a bad thing, but do they really <br/>
do this every single time?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if they have been living with food controls, even if they are <br/>
unspoken covert emotional controls (like, &quot;Oh, I can&#39;t eat donuts, <br/>
they are so unhealthy -- but you all can just enjoy them away from <br/>
me.&quot;), they are really going to have to go through a period of <br/>
deschooling food.  When you first release controls and embrace trust, <br/>
you can pretty much trust that kids are going to test you and <br/>
themselves fully, for months, and you just have to keep smiling and <br/>
nodding and loving them.<br/>
<br/>
Meredith, who writes on the AlwaysUnschooling list has written a lot <br/>
about her process of radical unschooling her stepson (whose mother <br/>
has very different parenting ideas) and his process of deschooling.  <br/>
You might find some great bits of wisdom reading through her blog.  I <br/>
would link the blog, but I can&#39;t find it ... maybe someone else can <br/>
find the adress of her blog, I thought I had it bookmarked and then I <br/>
thought I could find it over at AU, but I am striking out and I&#39;ve <br/>
got to start packing for our camping trip.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think that an important part of unschooling for me, so far, has <br/>

&gt; advantage of letting go and really trusting my children, that process <br/>
&gt; really served as a magnifying glass on my own personal/self trust <br/>
&gt; issues.  It was and is such a great opportunity for me to continue my <br/>
&gt; own growth and developement as a human being.  And, just as you can <br/>
&gt; imagine how empowering it is for the kids in our lives to make free <br/>
&gt; choices, imagine how empowering it will be for you to give up your <br/>
&gt; judgements and critical views of your own diet?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what is really exciting me right now--support for freeing myself <br/>
so that I can allow my kids to find freedom. I did not realize how <br/>
empowering and supportive of spiritual growth Unschooling would be. This <br/>
completely ties in with the Awakening I have been pursuing for myself <br/>
spiritually. I had been wondering how to share that with the kids, and <br/>
duh!, be open, authentic and present. I don&#39;t have to &quot;teach&quot; what I am <br/>
finding and learning. I just have to BE it. (piece of cake, right?)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; For me, a great weight lifted off my shoulders when I (sincerely and <br/>
&gt; honestly) stopped critically judging eveything that I ate:  Oh, I ate <br/>
&gt; healthy today, or I shouldn&#39;t have had that second bowl of icecream, <br/>
&gt; or I wish I ate more green vegies they are so healthy.  I am not sure <br/>
&gt; if I eat more or less *healthy* than I did before, but I feel great <br/>
&gt; and I feel healthy and I really just enjoy my food.  I haven&#39;t done <br/>
&gt; this *for* my kids, but in writing this down I can really see how <br/>
&gt; shifting my interactions with and internal conversations about food <br/>
&gt; is super positive for them.  (I found Byron Katie&#39;s The Work <br/>
&gt; thework.com incredibly helpful in jumpstarting and solidifying this <br/>
&gt; process.) <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Cathy <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This makes sense to me. If I stop being all ucky around food (up tight <br/>
and negative all the time) and just enjoy, then they are more likely to <br/>
be interested in even trying what I&#39;m eating!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check the site out. Thanks!<br/>

This thought crossed my  mind too when I read what Robin wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who feels sure they know what their children will do, and who  <br/>
takes steps to prevent it in advance, should read this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>
<br/>
Read LOTS of it.  Slowly.<br/>
<br/>
None of those writers have actually *tried* the thing they&#39;re writing  <br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
At my house there are chips and fruit all the time.  I bought new  <br/>
chips this morning because there&#39;s still some homemade guacamole, but  <br/>
the last chips went stale.  (We&#39;re not used to humidity here and it&#39;s  <br/>
been humid.)  The chips went stale even though there was good  <br/>
guacamole.  The kids don&#39;t gorge.  I offered Holly and her boyfriend  <br/>
homemade cheesecake last night.  They refused it politely.  They&#39;ve  <br/>
had some; it&#39;s good.  They&#39;re just not in the habit of rewarding  <br/>
themselves with food, and because food is readily available, there is  <br/>
no desperation to eat it.<br/>
<br/>
What they had eaten earlier was tuna salad rolled up in lettuce  <br/>
leaves.  One drank chocolate milk and the other drank tea (leftover  <br/>
from hot tea, cold in the fridge).  There were sodas.<br/>
<br/>
You could say &quot;yes but they&#39;re older&quot; but Holly is on her seventeenth  <br/>
year of being able to taste what she wants to taste and put it down  <br/>
or spit it out if she doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
At a fourth of July party, she ate corn on the cob.  I think that&#39;s  <br/>
all she had, but she really had fun with it and finished it all and  <br/>
put the cob in recycling.  There were sodas and chips and cake, but I  <br/>
didn&#39;t see  her getting those, though she could&#39;ve.<br/>

<br/>
We buy soda for the kids when they ask for it -- I wish they sold the <br/>
kind they like in those little half-size cans because I throw away a <br/>
lot of half empty cans of soda.  We will also have soda around for <br/>
months, because everyone had what they wanted and then lost <br/>
interest.  Mostly my kids prefer water.  They like milk, but go <br/>
through phases.  It&#39;s summer so we had been making pink lemonade <br/>
(from concentrate), but I just dumped half a pitcher that got moldy <br/>
sitting in the fridge, so I guess we are out of the phase.  I have a <br/>
couple of cases of Caprisuns they wanted at the grocery store, I <br/>
haven&#39;t seen them drink much of them, but they have had a couple of <br/>
friends come over who have had several of them.  My kids love chai <br/>
right now (Oregon brand) and will go through phases of drinking <br/>
several glasses of that each day.  But mostly, at the end of each <br/>
day, when I look at what they drank throughout the day, most of what <br/>
they drink is just plain old water.<br/>

Try not to speak for others.  This is a VERY big list.  Let&#39;s talk  <br/>
about the ideas themselves, from the point of view of what leads to  <br/>
learning and peace, not about what most people do.  Most people send  <br/>
their kids to school, punish them, ground them, deprive and limit  <br/>
them.   The list isn&#39;t about what most people do.<br/>

Drop discussion of extremes like whiskey.  It&#39;s a waste of energy and  <br/>

I don&#39;t think you want balance.  I think you want justification for  <br/>
controls. If you insist on villifying TV, as a drug (with or without  <br/>

control, and you will broadcast fear and control.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re using words like &quot;balance&quot; and &quot;option&quot; and &quot;choose,&quot; but you  <br/>

So why are you blaming the playmates?  Children need advice on how to  <br/>
behave with other children, but you&#39;re talking to us about school,  <br/>
and religious groups, and that&#39;s not what unschooling is about.<br/>

Questions like this should be considered to be for anyone in the  <br/>
discussion!<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes Izze sodas and Kern (?) fruit sodas.  So does Keith.  And  <br/>
they like grapefruit sodas (I forget the name).  Marty drinks Dr  <br/>
Pepper and root beer, but Marty and Holly and their friends go  <br/>
through a lot of bottled water, even though we keep a drawer of sodas  <br/>
in the fridge all the time (and more in the garage).<br/>
<br/>
In the fridge we keep a pitcher of sweet tea (ends from pots of tea,  <br/>
or sometimes made directly for iced tea purposes in the summer), and  <br/>
a Britta filter pitcher of cold water (in the summer).  We always   <br/>
have milk.  Sometimes I make milk shakes.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I like lassi, a yogurt drink with milk, lemon, salt and  <br/>
cumin.  I make it.  It&#39;s good on crazy-hot days.  The kids don&#39;t like  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Until kids have had all they want of something, they won&#39;t start  <br/>
turning it down.  When kids have had choices their whole lives, it&#39;s  <br/>
easy for them to know what &quot;all they want&quot; is--for my kids, that  <br/>
happened before they can remember.  They&#39;re not needy.  It&#39;s a huge  <br/>
difference.  It goes against &quot;common knowledge,&quot; but if common  <br/>
knowledge were worth a damn, wouldn&#39;t this culture be a paradise of  <br/>
mental health and joy, with empty prisons and long-lasting marriages?<br/>

My kids like water. Period. A juice once in a great while. My oldest sometimes like milk with ovaltine or a chocolate milk shake.<br/>
But they really want to drink water.<br/>
I have one of those water coolers with a big water jug like you see in offices and they just drink out of the little faucet.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
I know my kids do this, at least to some degree. But when we have <br/>

your kids making healthier food choices?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I don&#39;t limit. I make food available all the time and offer food every 2- 3 hours.<br/>
I make &quot;Goodies Plates&quot; or some call &quot;Monkey Platter&quot;<br/>
I offer those every 3-4 hour.<br/>
I put in them( for example)<br/>
fruit in pieces<br/>

grape tomatoes,<br/>
cereal<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407996754"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; On the one hand, we do teach our kids what to eat (parents have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>complete<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; control over what a 2-year-old has access to or not). OTOH, I can see<br/>
&gt; that too limited an offering of choices, especially with older kids,<br/>
&gt; limits their ability to figure out how to make choices that work for<br/>
&gt; them. This makes sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Parents don&#39;t have to have complete control over what a toddler eats. <br/>
Parents ultimately do have that control because they are bigger and have<br/>
the money, but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way within a household or a<br/>
grocery store outing.  Plenty of 2 yr olds know exactly what they want<br/>
to eat and don&#39;t hesitate to say so and the parents have the power to<br/>
empower their 2 yr old.<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly how unschooling unfolds when you start at the beginning.<br/>
If you are starting with older kids, the same principles apply.  Older<br/>
kids often know exactly what they want to eat and parents have the power<br/>
to empower them too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But the kids hate it<br/>
&gt; when I take all the &quot;fun&quot; foods out of the house, too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you consider fun foods?  All food can be fun.  Almost anything<br/>
can be prepared and presented in such a way as to be fun and pleasurable<br/>
to eat.  By seperating a certain type of food as fun and others as not,<br/>
you are perpetuating the cycle that you are wishing to avoid in regards<br/>
to food that you consider healthy and not so healthy.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve found is that there are healthier alternatives to almost<br/>
everything.  My discovery was prompted by my allergies to food, but it&#39;s<br/>
been a good one for my whole family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;d like us to eat more healthily together. I&#39;m a carb addict and its<br/>
&gt; hard for me to not eat doughnuts, pasta, ice cream, etc. when everyone<br/>
&gt; around me is. (There&#39;s spouse issues in here, too!) But I don&#39;t like<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; effect it has on my body!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just for the record, ice cream isn&#39;t a carb.  Doughnuts, pasta, and ice<br/>
cream aren&#39;t necessarily &quot;bad&quot; for you foods either.  It&#39;s more about<br/>
listening to your body and eating with balance and moderating your own<br/>
personal intake of food.  If you don&#39;t like the way food effects your<br/>
body, eat differently, or excercise, so that your body metabolizes<br/>
differently (If you are refering to the effects of gaining weight, and<br/>
not the effects of other things, like digestive.).<br/>
<br/>
How a person metabolizes food seems to be genetic.  A person can spend<br/>
loads of energy and thought on how to eat and not gain weight, and still<br/>
gain weight simply because that is how they are genetically.  Some<br/>
people can eat and eat and eat and not gain any weight.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (14) started gaining weight at around 11 and continued until<br/>
recently when she decided that she wanted to do something about it. <br/>
I&#39;ve never ever told her she needed to do anything different with her<br/>
body.  I made note of the changes that she was experiencing physically,<br/>
but I&#39;ve always been more focused on her internal changes, how she<br/>
feels.  I figured if she was round and happy, then I was happy, if she<br/>
was thin and happy then I was happy.<br/>
<br/>
Large bodies, don&#39;t necessarily mean unhappiness.  I see way too many<br/>
rounder women focus their entire lives on trying not to be round, so<br/>
much so, that the focus ceases to be about living and living happily,<br/>
but instead is about trying to be something they are not.  My daughter<br/>
has 2 sets of genetics within her, my family is thin, all of the women<br/>
in my husband&#39;s family are large.  She is built like my inlaws.  There<br/>
is absolutely nothing I can do about that.  She will have enormous<br/>
breasts and thin legs with a propensity to roundness in the belly.  She<br/>
can choose to live happily with that or she can spend the rest of her<br/>
life unhappily fighting it like her relatives.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille can make any food choices that she wants.  She chooses to eat<br/>
healthy.  She sees her relatives, their weight issues and diabetes<br/>
issues.  She made a choice not to go down that road.  She spent months<br/>
on end hardly eating anything.  She was testing her own limits, her own<br/>
body, getting back to a clean slate to work with within herself.  The<br/>
parents of her best friend accused her of being anorexic (which I&#39;m sure<br/>
they used it some argument with their daughter against her).  I will<br/>
admit that at first in concerned me.  I decided to let it go, because<br/>
for one, I trust her absolutely, and for two,  loads of people fast for<br/>
long periods of time and live to tell about it.<br/>
<br/>
There is something innately spiritual about our connection with food and<br/>
how it keeps us alive.  I feel that my daughter has experienced this<br/>
deeply and because of this, is very careful and decisive about  her food<br/>
choices and what she puts into her body.<br/>
<br/>
I could have done a lot to damage that process.  The worst thing I<br/>
could&#39;ve done is to force her to eat, force her to eat things she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to in the name of &quot;good for you&quot;.  I could have shamed her into<br/>
thinking that what she was doing was wrong or dangerous.  I silenced<br/>
those voices.  Afterall those with food disorders have all been known to<br/>
center around control or the lack there of.  How awesome and empowering<br/>
for a teenager to be able to have absolute control over something so<br/>
intimate as how to eat to live.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, I have met many many people that have had eating<br/>
disorders, that still have issues with eating disorders.  It leaves a<br/>
lasting scar over their lives.  Eating should be pleasant and enjoyable,<br/>
afterall we have to eat in order to live.  Once tainted with a disorder,<br/>
it ceases to be pleasant and can never ever be whole, truly whole. <br/>
People can do a lot to get over eating disorders and eventually have a<br/>
healthier attitude about food, but those issues will always be there<br/>
deep inside, like a scar is forever on your skin to remind you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want that for my kids ever!  Period!  My answer to avoid that is<br/>
to allow my kids to know what they want and give it to them.  If a<br/>
certain food will make them feel good, then I will give it to them.  If<br/>
at some point they decide that certain food doesn&#39;t make them feel good,<br/>
I trust they will eliminate it from their choices.</div>

&gt; Out of curiosity, what do your kids drink?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When we go grocery shopping, different kids will go with me, depending  <br/>
on what else is going on. Or, sometimes, I go alone.<br/>
<br/>
I always ask, &quot;Anybody have anything they want at the store?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They almost always have something - yesterday Rosie asked me to check  <br/>
whether there were any good-looking avocados at decent prices. Roxana  <br/>
wanted wheat bread (we had only sourdough bread in the house). They  <br/>
often want me to get frozen foods like frozen macaroni and cheese. I  <br/>
don&#39;t think any of them have ever asked for a soda. Whenever we shop  <br/>
at Target, though, we almost always buy a soda at the checkout - there  <br/>
is something about that store that leaves us extremely thirsty by the  <br/>
time we&#39;re ready to leave - and they have really cold soda at the  <br/>
check stands.<br/>
<br/>
My kids drink lots of water - usually cold from the fridge. We drink  <br/>
water with meals - always have. We have some of those packets that you  <br/>
add to water to flavor them - every once in a while one of us will  <br/>
have one of those, but they mostly sit here for months and months.   <br/>
The kids drink soda sometimes, or lemonade, when we&#39;re eating out. I  <br/>
usually have coffee and my dh usually has tea.<br/>

and non-restrictive.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re NOT talking about negligence. So, when they start sounding the  <br/>
same to you, it means you&#39;re missing something important. I&#39;m  <br/>
suggesting that you look for that missing link - see if you can find,  <br/>
in our posts, what makes what we&#39;re doing different than negligence.<br/>
