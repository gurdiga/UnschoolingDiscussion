concept of &#39;socialization&#39; one more time, I&#39;ll scream.<br/>
Am I an intolerant bitch?  Probably :P  But I just have no patience with <br/>
people not even WILLING to entertain the idea that our culture and its <br/>
institutions are essentially flawed and maybe that is at the root of crime, <br/>
depression and general oppression :(<br/>

We live in a society that is rapidly becoming a nation of sociopaths. The <br/>
root cause of this is not the loss of family values. Neither is it the <br/>
consequence of parents who are in themselves sociopaths or emotionally <br/>
disturbed individuals. The cause, instead, is the conventional, but <br/>
abnormal, ways in which we rear our children. From the moment of birth, <br/>
children are deprived of that which humans evolved to have Â– the prolonged <br/>
nurturing natural to our species.</div>

&lt;&lt; I got into a very<br/>
 heated discussion with two school at home moms yesterday. They were<br/>
 practically rolling there eyes when I said that we unschool. I could almost<br/>
 hear them thinking &quot;so you do nothing all day and your kids don&#39;t learn<br/>
 anything&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Hi Amy:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with you on this one... It&#39;s so frustrating to know that the majority of <br/>
people in &quot;westernized cultures&quot;  can&#39;t live out of their box or comfort <br/>
zone...It&#39;s the conditioning people have to blindly go like sheep to the <br/>
slaughter and not to consider other alternatives... I&#39;m finding there is <br/>
absolute no point in talking to those people because (a) I usually have <br/>
nothing in common with them, because of their mentality (b) it only <br/>
frustrates me that people don&#39;t understand and don&#39;t really want to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to change the world and have it widely accepted... The only way I <br/>
can do that is to live it and when people see by example what&#39;s happening to <br/>
my children, maybe they&#39;ll want to look a little closer and see how they got <br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>
I know and understand the feeling of frustration though...  Keep up your <br/>
belief&#39;s...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443131945">the old empathetic thing of identifying a concern of theirs, naming <br/>
their feelings, could be a way into such people&#39;s minds...  showing <br/>
you&#39;re thinking about how they feel about it can help them think <br/>
about how you see things.  Then you can tell them what you think <br/>
without it seeming like an attack on their way of life.  M2pW :-) <br/>
