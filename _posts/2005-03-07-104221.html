&lt;&lt; When there was a winter festival at a nearby farm, I tried to get all <br/>
<br/>
my kids to go.  They all said no, anso we didn&#39;<br/>
Zt go.  I could&#39;ve <br/>
<br/>
gone by myself, but when I seriously considered it, I realized that I <br/>
<br/>
didn&#39;t really want to go for myself.  I wanted to go for them.  I <br/>
<br/>
thought it would have neat stuff to &quot;expose&quot; them to.  After the <br/>
<br/>
festival was over there was a story and pictures in the paper about <br/>
<br/>
it, and I felt a pang of &quot;Darn, I wish we could&#39;ve gone&quot;, and again <br/>
<br/>
realized that I wouldn&#39;t have felt that if I didn&#39;t have kids.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you wouldn&#39;t be homeschooling if you didn&#39;t have kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;do nothing&quot; CAN be too strong, and kids who are spared having to <br/>
go to school 180 days can do SOME things out of the house in the name of <br/>
actively living and learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I  really think it was a bit of schooly &quot;expose them to a lot of <br/>
<br/>
educational things&quot; kind of feeling that still pops up every once in <br/>
<br/>
awhile. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it SHOULD pop up once in a while, maybe without the &quot;educational&quot; <br/>
emphasis, but learning happens from exposure, and if people neglect to expose, <br/>
that&#39;s pretty heavy on the &quot;neglect&quot; end of the balance.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wasn&#39;t so much attracted to taking them to the festival <br/>
<br/>
because of anything there that I thought would particularly interest <br/>
<br/>
any one of them.  It was just that it was a &quot;good experience&quot; that I <br/>
<br/>
wanted to &quot;expose&quot; them to.  It would make me feel like a good, well-<br/>
<br/>
rounded unschooler.  And it would make me feel &quot;normal&quot;, like I go <br/>
<br/>
lots of cool places with my kids like everyone else.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
It would have been doing something together, too, that would make memories <br/>
and probably be a springboard to other connections, activities and discussions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s easier to explain unschooling to friends/relatives when you can <br/>
<br/>
tell them about theatre productions and festivals and museums that <br/>
<br/>
you went to, because all that sounds very &quot;educational&quot; and <br/>
<br/>
impressive.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It also is being involved in your community, and that&#39;s not a school thing, <br/>
that&#39;s a good-human thing.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- In my state, it also makes good fodder for the <br/>
<br/>
portfolio.  But when your homebody kids stay home and read and cook <br/>
<br/>
and play video games and watch tv and play, and it seems that every <br/>
<br/>
time you tell them about what your kids are doing it&#39;s the same <br/>
<br/>
thing, you feel a pressure to be &quot;exposing them&quot; to more so that you <br/>
<br/>
sound more impressive. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If I couldn&#39;t inspire my kids to get up and out through my own personal <br/>
magnetism and salesmanship, I would go to Plan B which would be to say &quot;It&#39;s good <br/>
to do something that relatives and the government will see as educational <br/>
activity, and going to a festival looks good on the portfolio, and I can assure you <br/>
it&#39;s better than ANY day at school, so put your shoes on and get a jacket and <br/>
let&#39;s go have fun!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know that it&#39;s not the same old thing every <br/>
<br/>
day and that they learn and do interesting stuff all the time but to <br/>
<br/>
other people who don&#39;t get unshcooling, it sounds like the same old <br/>
<br/>
thing sometimes I think.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
If it IS the same old thing, sliding down into a hole of immobility and the <br/>
family gets in the habit of NOT going out and NOT finding interesting things in <br/>
the community, that&#39;s not optimal unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Couples even without kids get that way sometimes, to the point that they&#39;re <br/>
not going to parties anymore, not inviting people over anymore, and soon it&#39;s <br/>
just the same thing all the time and they&#39;ve become immobilized and stuck.  <br/>
<br/>
Stuck isn&#39;t a learning place.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s own home is a hive of activity and people are coming in and out <br/>
all the time, the hours outside aren&#39;t as important, but if the child is still <br/>
and the mom is feeling uncomfortable, those are signs to MOVE.<br/>
<br/>
In the past week, Kirby has played  a new Star Wars video game for over 55 <br/>
hours.  He also went to work three times, class four times, karate for three <br/>
hours, visited a friend LATE after work Saturday, and ran a long D&D session last <br/>
night at our house.  That was as full a week as I&#39;ve ever seen him have when <br/>
he wasn&#39;t out of town or at a gaming convention.  He hardly slept.  He&#39;ll be <br/>
up again and off to class within an hour.  He eats at the desk or at work, and <br/>
that&#39;s a very, very busy week.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Marty took three friends to Explora, a hands-on museum for kids, <br/>
mostly science and math, but not all.   The three friends hadn&#39;t been before.  <br/>
Marty got them in on our family membership, though he was prepared to pay their <br/>
way out of his own money if the desk had said no about the &quot;family.&quot;   Those <br/>
other three, none homeschoolers) are Leif, who has a college degree and is <br/>
probably 25 years old, Ed who&#39;s 21 and a part-time college student, though he has <br/>
 a GOOD job with a security clearance, and Ryan, who&#39;s barely 21 and my <br/>
favorite of all their friends.  Marty is 16.    They followed Marty&#39;s <br/>
recommendation that it&#39;s a really great place to go, got there about 2:00 in the afternoon <br/>
and stayed until it closed.   Last night they were all in Kirby&#39;s D&D game, <br/>
and today Marty and Holly are watching another disc of Buffy with their <br/>
Buffy-watching-partner-homeschooler friend, Julie.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids get used to going and doing, when they get older you won&#39;t have <br/>
to be their organizer or their driver. <br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t get a young child up and going, you will probably not get a teen <br/>
up and going.  SELL the world as a happy place, and to do that you need to <br/>
SEE the world as a happy place full of things worth getting some shoes and a <br/>
coat on and taking pains (not just when it&#39;s easy) to GET OUT THERE.  Make it fun <br/>
when you do go.  Play music in the car, stop and feed ducks, have a nice <br/>
lunch packed if you can&#39;t afford to go out, stop at a good place to eat it.   <br/>
Treat your child as an honored guest you just can&#39;t WAIT to show something cool.   <br/>
<br/>
Letting kids decide to &quot;do nothing&quot; (though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;nothing&quot;) <br/>
isn&#39;t good unschooling.  Providing more choices for them, and more input and more <br/>
opportunity is the duty of anyone who wants to say &quot;I&#39;m unschooling.&quot;  It <br/>
truly does need to be a &quot;doing,&quot; an action, a life lived purposefully and richly, <br/>
not just a hiding-out from school.  It SHOULD be so rich that anyone who <br/>
hears stories is impressed and understands it.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765062966">I guess I&#39;m very lucky that I don&#39;t have kids that complain when we take<br/>
them somewhere that they haven&#39;t decided on themselves. Not sure if it&#39;s how<br/>
they are or how we have all managed to be together.<br/>
<br/>
But it happens around here. And most of the time the kids love being out and<br/>
seeing the new stuff we have planned for us all. Sometimes we all decide it<br/>
wasn&#39;t that great, but that we had a good time just being out and deciding<br/>
for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
One thing we have learned is that Joseph (10) doesn&#39;t like surprises when it<br/>
comes to going somewhere. Sierra (9) does like surprises so we act<br/>
accordingly and Joseph is good about not saying anything. Alyssa (4) just<br/>
really likes to go out unless it&#39;s cold and she has to wear clothes. We have<br/>
managed to get by that on a few occasions.<br/>
<br/>
There is a big Renaissance Festival around here that we have never been too.<br/>
They use to have it at a park just down the street from us and we have never<br/>
gone there either. Mostly because I thought it was really expensive for us<br/>
all to get in. Now it&#39;s held about 40 minutes away and Joe (dh) was able to<br/>
get us in for free.<br/>
<br/>
So off we went with the 3 younger kids. Tara (18) had to work. I tried to<br/>
explain to the kids the best I could as to what it was about. I didn&#39;t make<br/>
it half as interesting as it really was once we got there. It was wonderful<br/>
and we all had a really good time. Definitely planning on going back next<br/>
year. In fact Joe and I went again yesterday just the two of us. I loved the<br/>
atmosphere and had such a good time with all the people in character there.<br/>
The shows were so funny I haven&#39;t laughed that hard in quite awhile. The<br/>
first time we went, Joseph even volunteered to go up on stage with the<br/>
magician. Something he has never done. He had such a good time.<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes things end up that way going to new places. Having a wonderful<br/>
time and deciding to do it again. Sometimes, like the Monster Truck Jam, we<br/>
all decide it was a fun experience, but we won&#39;t be going back anytime soon!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say we have ever gone anywhere where we&#39;ve had an awful time. We<br/>
make the most out of being together and just doing something new.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397748618">I don&#39;t know if this will help, Betsy, but I have hard time going out<br/>
of the house frequently, always being on the go, especially to<br/>
crowd-filled events or places. It&#39;s also not natural for me to want to<br/>
always have people over to my house or to want to go over all the time<br/>
to other peoples&#39; houses. I&#39;m a bona fide introvert. My husband is<br/>
exactly the opposite. I think it&#39;s good for me because although it<br/>
leads to conflicts of interest that we have to work out, it causes me<br/>
to stretch a little. Plus I have someone who can take my son places<br/>
that I&#39;d rather not go :o) I think it&#39;s good for my son because he<br/>
gets to choose from the best of both worlds and he seems to lean more<br/>
towards the extrovert side.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like your whole family might lean towards the<br/>
introvert side. What I hear from other people sounds more like<br/>
extroversion. How do introverts unschool? Does it look or sound<br/>
different from the way extroverts unschool? It seems to me it might...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a thought...<br/>

that&#39;s been bugging me. My dh still would like an hour of so of what he <br/>
recognizes as learning each day. Is it unschooling to say &quot;listen lets <br/>
do some math and history and this will make Dad more comfortable about <br/>
all the rest of the time gaming, playing, watching tv, hanging out, and <br/>
letting you pretty much make all your own decisions&quot;? The man has come <br/>
pretty far in the learning curve when it comes to an &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
lifestyle but he has a way to go.<br/>
How do you balance it all out and still call it unschooling?<br/>
Hmmm, I must be having a bad day and I&#39;m getting tired of this internal <br/>
struggle I&#39;m having over what and what is not unschooling.<br/>

Why does your kid need to know that you&#39;re logging some math or history  time?<br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t &quot;do history&quot; in a answering questions way, but what if you say  <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s look at the atlas for a whiel and find some cool stuff to tell dad about  <br/>
later,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;d feel better if we had a game to tell dad about every day, so  <br/>
let&#39;s play master mind&quot; (or whatever).  <br/>
 <br/>
And then YOU tell your husband about Master Mind being deductive reasoning  <br/>
if he&#39;s not already a Master Mind player from pre-fatherhood years.<br/>
 <br/>
Or you could tell your husband that if he wants a schoolish hour a day,  that <br/>
can be his contribution.  (He probably wouldn&#39;t last a week, so it&#39;s a  safe <br/>
suggestion to make.)<br/>

People call all kinds of things unschooling.  I don&#39;t think you meant  to ask <br/>

learning, not in the part-time-school mode and calling it  unschooling.<br/>

back and forth between wanting to be out and about with people and <br/>
close to home just us. I know that I&#39;ve grown more able to handle <br/>
people stuff as I&#39;ve gotten older - I just account for it by a chunk <br/>
of downtime before or after it. So that&#39;s mostly what we do as a <br/>
family - if we&#39;ve got a really people-filled few days, we&#39;ll then <br/>
try to clear out the schedule some and hunker down for movies, board <br/>
games, whatever and just be home together for a bit. Generally, <br/>
Friday-Monday tends to be out and about so Tuesday-Thursday tends to <br/>
be closer to home - Thursday night is in-between - DH and I have our <br/>
weekly date and DS plays with Grandma and toddler cousin Tyler at <br/>
Grandma&#39;s house. We also keep an eye on how many different places we <br/>
go to in a given day - more than 2 or 3 is too much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293944937">Stop worrying about whether or not what you do is CALLED unschooling. <br/>
That&#39;s not the real question you need to be asking yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I really mean that. I don&#39;t care if what we do is called unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I care to talk about unschooling - what it means, what it is based on, <br/>
what unschooling parents do, and so on --- but if somebody else looks <br/>
at my kids and says, &quot;That&#39;s not unschooling,&quot; so what? If I listed my <br/>
100 goals of life - other people calling what we do &quot;unschooling&quot; would <br/>
not be on my list.<br/>
<br/>
If you have to do an hour of something that works for your husband in <br/>
order to have freedom the rest of the time - then so be it. If it buys <br/>
you a relaxed happy household - it might be worth it. On the other <br/>
hand, if you can educate him to understanding what unschooling is all <br/>
about - then so much the better. And, if you put your mind to it, I bet <br/>
you can come up with things to do that satisfy him and aren&#39;t as <br/>
schooly as, say, doing workbooks or reading textbooks/writing essays, <br/>
etc. It doesn&#39;t have to be all or nothing - you can use what YOU know <br/>
about learning in all kinds of ways to come up with enough to satisfy <br/>
him and still not really be &quot;doing school&quot; at home.<br/>
<br/>
But, if you&#39;re asking if &quot;doing school&quot; an hour a day is still <br/>
unschooling. Well, no. The answer is easy and clear. But so what? Is <br/>
being called an unschooler what is important? No. It is how your family <br/>
lives its life that is important and only you really know what will be <br/>
the best choice. Harmony in your family can be worth a lot. On the <br/>
other hand, maybe your husband can be re-educated. Many of us had <br/>
recalcitrant spouses who either came around or gave in &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
In order to avoid any judgment by others about whether or not we were <br/>
&quot;unschoolers&quot; - I called us &quot;unschoolish&quot; for years, as in, &quot;We&#39;re <br/>
pretty unschoolish.&quot; Hedged my bets &lt;G&gt;. Now I don&#39;t care anymore what <br/>
other people call us.<br/>

But I am lazy...yes LAZY and some days its easier to just give up and <br/>
not have any more of those long, drawn out conversations with dh. Its <br/>
easier to do &quot;schoolish&quot; shit for an hour and mark it done in my brain <br/>
and go on to do what we want. More then that, its easier to mark that <br/>
stuff down and quiet that voice that says we not even very good <br/>
unschoolers because we just maybe the kind who really don&#39;t have tons of <br/>
cool conversations, or go to the museums, or on trips, or spend money on <br/>
stuff in the hopes that ds will not look at it and say &quot;that looks <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the &quot;do nothing&quot; can be too strong too.  But I haven&#39;t seen <br/>
people who &quot;do nothing&quot; too strongly unless they&#39;re depressed or if <br/>
they&#39;re so programmed by school that they don&#39;t know how to do <br/>
something unless they&#39;re told to do it.  That&#39;s why I asked Betsy if <br/>
her son was happy and content.  If he&#39;s happy and enjoying his life, <br/>
then is the do nothing too strong?  <br/>
<br/>
Is being an extrovert better than being an introvert? (I don&#39;t think <br/>
so).  What if the introvert is at the extreme end of introvertedness <br/>
and rarely wants to go anywhere?  Not because they don&#39;t have <br/>
somewhere willing to take them but just because that&#39;s how their <br/>
personality is wired?  <br/>
<br/>
At what point does our coaxing turn into trying to get them to be <br/>
someone who they aren&#39;t?  If we trust them to know when they&#39;re ready <br/>
to read--all the time, why not trust them to know when they&#39;re ready <br/>
to leave the house--all the time?  If we wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;Oh, please <br/>
just 15 minutes of spelling&quot;, why would we say, &quot;Oh, please just 15 <br/>
minutes at a festival?&quot;  <br/>

expose.  The festival I wanted to take my kids to had ice sculptures <br/>
and I thought that would have been cool for them to see.  But it&#39;s <br/>
not like they&#39;ve never seen ice sculptures before.  As a matter of <br/>
fact we were just recently looking at a magazine that had some really <br/>
cool ice sculptures in it, and they ooohed and aaahed over them. AND <br/>
I offered to take them to the festival and told them there would be <br/>
some neat ice sculptures there.  I asked them more than once.  I even <br/>
said, &quot;Okay, how about if we just go get something to eat and then <br/>
come back home&quot;.  Nope, there really was no interest.  They stayed <br/>
home and enjoyed themselves a lot more than they would have if they <br/>
had gone to the festival.  <br/>

anything?  <br/>
<br/>
If I told my kids to put their shoes on and get a jacket and let&#39;s go <br/>
have fun at something they clearly didn&#39;t want to go to, they very <br/>
well might refuse to get in the car.  My 11 year old might go, but <br/>
she&#39;d be upset with me and she&#39;d be miserable and it would affect our <br/>
relationship negatively.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But it&#39;s possible to not be the same old thing and still not be doing <br/>
many things in the community.  My kids are rarely if ever bored.  <br/>
There is always all kinds of creative stuff going on around the <br/>
house, and they&#39;re very often laughing and very excited about <br/>
something cool they&#39;re doing.  It&#39;s just that more often than not, <br/>
most of the cool, creative, intersting stuff they do is at home, not <br/>
out in the community.  <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe people are defining &quot;not going out much&quot; differently.  For <br/>
some people, going out once every other day is still staying home a <br/>
lot.  For other people, going out once every 2 weeks is going out a <br/>
lot.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that if a child isn&#39;t going out because he&#39;s not allowed to <br/>
or doesn&#39;t have the chance to, that&#39;s bad.  If a child isn&#39;t going <br/>
out because he&#39;s afraid of the world and no one has ever gently tried <br/>
to give him opportunities to do stuff outside of the house, that&#39;s <br/>
bad.  But if that&#39;s just his personality, then it&#39;s good when it&#39;s <br/>
honored and no one&#39;s trying to change it.  <br/>

her instincts and senses that something is wrong, yes.  But if a mom <br/>
is listening to insecurities and friends and relatives who worry too <br/>
much, then the mom might need to center herself and listen to her gut <br/>
instincts then.  <br/>

thriving of course.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806963374">My husband is a little bit like that himself, but he came from very poor circumstances.  Education was not a priority in his family, and he has suffered greatly because of the lack of effort and caring on the part of his family.  I think that he is afraid of being the same way with our family, but our children prove every day that their education is not being neglected, and I have often overheard him defending our position to busybodies even after he tells me that we are not doing enough.  I keep a box of every paper that they bring from church, scouting, artwork that they do on their own, and any coloring or workbook pages that the children complete.  This way he can have his paperwork, and the kids still have their time to explore.<br/>

That&#39;s not the real question you need to be asking yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I really mean that. I don&#39;t care if what we do is called unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I care to talk about unschooling - what it means, what it is based on, <br/>
what unschooling parents do, and so on --- but if somebody else looks <br/>
at my kids and says, &quot;That&#39;s not unschooling,&quot; so what? If I listed my <br/>
100 goals of life - other people calling what we do &quot;unschooling&quot; would <br/>
not be on my list.<br/>
<br/>
If you have to do an hour of something that works for your husband in <br/>
order to have freedom the rest of the time - then so be it. If it buys <br/>
you a relaxed happy household - it might be worth it. On the other <br/>
hand, if you can educate him to understanding what unschooling is all <br/>
about - then so much the better. And, if you put your mind to it, I bet <br/>
you can come up with things to do that satisfy him and aren&#39;t as <br/>
schooly as, say, doing workbooks or reading textbooks/writing essays, <br/>
etc. It doesn&#39;t have to be all or nothing - you can use what YOU know <br/>
about learning in all kinds of ways to come up with enough to satisfy <br/>
him and still not really be &quot;doing school&quot; at home.<br/>
<br/>
But, if you&#39;re asking if &quot;doing school&quot; an hour a day is still <br/>
unschooling. Well, no. The answer is easy and clear. But so what? Is <br/>
being called an unschooler what is important? No. It is how your family <br/>
lives its life that is important and only you really know what will be <br/>
the best choice. Harmony in your family can be worth a lot. On the <br/>
other hand, maybe your husband can be re-educated. Many of us had <br/>
recalcitrant spouses who either came around or gave in &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
In order to avoid any judgment by others about whether or not we were <br/>
&quot;unschoolers&quot; - I called us &quot;unschoolish&quot; for years, as in, &quot;We&#39;re <br/>
pretty unschoolish.&quot; Hedged my bets &lt;G&gt;. Now I don&#39;t care anymore what <br/>
other people call us.<br/>

young, I didn&#39;t know where we&#39;d end up - I couldn&#39;t guarantee (even to <br/>
myself) that we&#39;d never end up using a curriculum, for example. I <br/>
didn&#39;t EXPECT to do that, but I had to be honest with myself and admit <br/>
that when my oldest started school, I never EXPECTED to end up <br/>
homeschooling, either. So - I couldn&#39;t completely rule out the <br/>
possibility that there might be a time when we wouldn&#39;t entirely <br/>
unschool. And I didn&#39;t want to have laid some sort of strong claim to <br/>
be an &quot;unschooler&quot; and then either feel like a fraud or feel I had to <br/>
explain a change of mind, if one happened, later. So - I hedged.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I honestly do not think this question is about being extroverted versus <br/>
introverted. I know a couple of extremely introverted unschoolers - <br/>
their lives aren&#39;t as filled with other people, especially groups, but <br/>
they&#39;re filled with all kinds of interesting activities and experiences <br/>
- they just tend to be filled with fewer &quot;interpersonal&quot; activities and <br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Sheila - you&#39;re focusing on the &quot;going out&quot; aspects of this - but that <br/>
isn&#39;t the critical point. Both you and Betsy have sounded like  you <br/>
WANT your kids to want to go out more or something. So - we can give <br/>
you suggestions of how to make that more likely - but the point of <br/>
having a rich and stimulating lifestyle isn&#39;t dependent on being &quot;on <br/>
the go&quot; all the time - but it IS dependent on the parents bringing all <br/>
KINDS of information and ideas and facts and questions and experiences <br/>
and wonderings and interesting aspects of the world TO their kids in <br/>
all kinds of ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991143725">From the time we started to homeschool (unschool) until the last year or<br/>
two, I made sure I offered my children a variety of places to go, people to<br/>
see and meet, and things to do.  We went to the theater several times a<br/>
year, we joined a homeschooling group, we went to park days, we went to<br/>
different field trips with homeschool groups, we went bowling, and skating,<br/>
and sliding, and skiing, we joined an art class, went to the animal rescue<br/>
zoo, the museum, I offered a variety of classes (that were always turned<br/>
down), like dance, karate, baseball, etc.  We only went to things when they<br/>
would agree to go. That was working well for us at the time because my kids<br/>
didn&#39;t seem to have a passion for anything yet.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I knew other kids who had passions long before my kids.  Some were into<br/>
karate, some dance, and they really loved it.  My kids liked going to these<br/>
different things, but they hadn&#39;t found anything that really made them<br/>
drool.  :-)  That was until we went with a homeschool group on a riding<br/>
stable tour.  :-)  I asked them if they&#39;d be interested in riding lessons<br/>
(of course that was the most expensive thing I&#39;d ever offered.) and my<br/>
youngest said she was interested.  I didn&#39;t call right off.  Over the next<br/>
couple of weeks she kept reminding me to call.  (I was a little hesitant to<br/>
call, that&#39;s just me, not knowing if you had to be able to afford to go<br/>
weekly, or whatever)  Her reminders let me know she was serious about it.  I<br/>
finally called and set up the first lesson.  (The instructor assured me it<br/>
was fine to come every other week)  The following week my older dd decided<br/>
she wanted to try it too.  (She likes to know exactly what to expect when<br/>
she goes somewhere, hence allowing her sister to try it first.)  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Those first lessons were the beginning of a serious obsession with horses.<br/>
Now, my kids are interested in leaving the house every day, but only to go<br/>
to the barn up the road where we board our horse.  (I would never have<br/>
dreamed after that trip to the barn with the homeschool group that we&#39;d have<br/>
our own horse in two years!)  They will go to the grocery store out of<br/>
necessity.  (when we run out of carrots for the horse) and they do love the<br/>
tack store or anything horse related (we went on a sleigh ride recently).<br/>
But pretty much, since last fall, those are the only places we&#39;ve been.<br/>
(Well, except to friends and relative&#39;s houses for visits) We are all three<br/>
really happy with this for right now.  Their exposure to things other than<br/>
horses has been curbed tremendously.  Their interest in going other places<br/>
has come to an end.  But I am not worried that they are no longer exposed to<br/>
a wide variety of things because they have found their passion for right<br/>
now.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When we aren&#39;t at the barn, we have a houseful of great things to do and<br/>
they are happy to be at home when they are at home.  We all love board games<br/>
and my kids still love pretend play.  (about horses of course)  We read<br/>
about horses, both fiction and non-fiction.  We watch horse training shows<br/>
and events on TV.  They are happy and fulfilled and we&#39;ll continue on this<br/>
path until they are no longer happy and fulfilled.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If I were trying to get them out of the house to go to different events (so<br/>
they&#39;d look well rounded for their portfolio review) I am sure I&#39;d be met<br/>
with some serious resistance.  This year has not been a year that was filled<br/>
with a variety of social or educational trips.  From the outside I am sure<br/>
we all look like a bunch of hermits who don&#39;t go anywhere, but I don&#39;t care.<br/>
We are all happy and content with the way things are.  We aren&#39;t overly<br/>
social by nature anyway and we&#39;ve all discovered we have a passion for<br/>
horses.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that I am being neglectful as an unschooler this year because<br/>
I haven&#39;t offered to take them to a wide variety of places.  I know what<br/>
their answer would be.  They&#39;d rather go to the barn and ride, and groom,<br/>
and clean stalls.  I think they are lucky to be able to follow their passion<br/>
for right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183130280">Hey ya&#39;ll, haven&#39;t been on list for ages...did ya MISS<br/>
ME? lol <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Its easier to do &quot;schoolish&quot; shit for an hour and<br/>
mark it done in my brain <br/>
and go on to do what we want. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand that when it comes to dishes, for<br/>
example, or taking out the garbage, lol, but for<br/>
learning?  Learning is more complex than that, and the<br/>
simple fact is, he won&#39;t learn much, if anything, if<br/>
you do schoolish stuff for an hour, there&#39;s no<br/>
context, no richness, no real, lasting connections<br/>
made in his brain.  <br/>
<br/>
Ask your dh, is that what he wants? <br/>
<br/>
Does he *really* want learning to be flat and lifeless<br/>
and a chore?  <br/>
<br/>
And really, it&#39;s not easier.  I know it SEEMS easier,<br/>
but it&#39;s really not in the long run, it&#39;s ten times<br/>
harder to wake up a kid to real learning after he&#39;s<br/>
been bored stiff by schooly crap. :-) <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;More then that, its easier to mark that <br/>
stuff down and quiet that voice that says we not even<br/>
very good unschoolers because we just maybe the kind<br/>
who really don&#39;t have tons of cool conversations, or<br/>
go to the museums, or on trips, or spend money on <br/>
stuff in the hopes that ds will not look at it and say<br/>
&quot;that looks stupid, or boring or sucky&quot;.....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to think we weren&#39;t that kind of unschooler,<br/>
too.  We are homebodies, we don&#39;t have a lot of money<br/>
for activities or fieldtrips. But we do what we like,<br/>
and we learn despite all that. Really. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Open up your mind.  Try to let go of your preconceived<br/>
notions of what learning is and is not.  Pay attention<br/>
to the processes that your son is going thru RIGHT<br/>
NOW, TODAY.  Write about it tonite, see what ya see. <br/>
<br/>
And try not to minimize what he did do as just<br/>
*whatever*.  See your son as a multi faceted person<br/>
who is spending his time learning about himself, at<br/>
the very least, whatever he happens to be doing.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It also could be this time of year when I always go<br/>
a bit crazy, plus I <br/>
just got bifocals and they are making me quite annoyed<br/>
about everything.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 I can&#39;t imagine training my eyes to look thru the<br/>
different lenses, just thinking about it&#39;s giving me a<br/>
headache! lol Give yourself a break right now, then,<br/>
don&#39;t make decisions when you&#39;re annoyed.  I find if I<br/>
do that I have to go and undo them all, anyway, and<br/>
that&#39;s too much work! lol <br/>

If he&#39;s totally happy and enjoying his life but it&#39;s small and limited and  <br/>
could be bigger and better and she&#39;s feeling she&#39;s not doing enough, then she  <br/>

 <br/>
-=-Is being an extrovert better than being an introvert? (I don&#39;t think  <br/>
so).-=-<br/>
 <br/>
If introversion leads to isolation and entropy, and if what we&#39;re doing  does <br/>
have SOME expectation of helping a child gather the information he needs to  <br/>
have some equivalent to the education voters have decided (however indirectly) <br/>
 that people in their state should have by the time they&#39;re 18, then yes,  <br/>
introversion can be very bad.<br/>
 <br/>
If someone can&#39;t unschool, then they should get a curriculum or put their  <br/>
kids in school.  The laws of most place require that the kids have an  education <br/>
equivalent to the state&#39;s curriculum.  It IS possible to get that  knowledge <br/>
all aswirl around a child so that he picks it up.  That is what  unschooling <br/>
depends on.  A family that can&#39;t or won&#39;t stir up enough  exposure to all the <br/>
subject areas schools are claiming to cover (whether they&#39;re  doing it or not <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter here), then they&#39;re not really unschooling,  they&#39;re just hiding <br/>
out until the compulsory attendance days are over.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-What if the introvert is at the extreme end of introvertedness <br/>
and  rarely wants to go anywhere?  Not because they don&#39;t have <br/>
somewhere  willing to take them but just because that&#39;s how their <br/>
personality is  wired?  <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
School&#39;s not great for introverts, though some are good at being invisible  <br/>
and bypassing most of the social interactions.  But if a family chooses an  <br/>
alternate method, they shouldn&#39;t then also reject the alternate method, which  <br/>
seems to me to require exposure to the world one way or another.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-At what point does our coaxing turn into trying to get them to be  <br/>
someone who they aren&#39;t?  If we trust them to know when they&#39;re ready  <br/>
to read--all the time, why not trust them to know when they&#39;re ready <br/>
to  leave the house--all the time?  If we wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;Oh, please <br/>
just 15  minutes of spelling&quot;, why would we say, &quot;Oh, please just 15 <br/>
minutes at a  festival?&quot;  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I know from La Leche League that some kids are willing to walk away from  <br/>
their moms as soon as they can walk and some want mom&#39;s lap for four  years.  <br/>
That&#39;s fine.  I don&#39;t advocate moms putting their kids out and  away from them <br/>
before the kid&#39;s ready at all.  I don&#39;t recommend helping  the child get along <br/>
without mom.   But this isn&#39;t that.  It&#39;s the  child still being WITH mom, and <br/>
the mom being with the child, maybe just across  the street instead of kid in <br/>
bedroom, mom in kitchen.<br/>
 <br/>
I think the examples given are NOT child not wanting to go out, they might  <br/>
be child not wanting to go out with mom, so the analogy might not hold.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-The festival I wanted to take my kids to had ice sculptures <br/>
and I  thought that would have been cool for them to see.  But it&#39;s <br/>
not like  they&#39;ve never seen ice sculptures before-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m thrilled that we got to see the parade and ice sculputures in St. Paul  <br/>
one year.  New Mexico has an occasional swan at the Marriott&#39;s buffet, but  <br/>
that&#39;s about it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Is doing something so that someone else approves a good reason to do  <br/>
anything?  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes, yes, unless one wants to live as a hermit.  Even then, the  <br/>
landowner or government might have to approve them staying in that cave or  shack, <br/>
so they need to  consider others to some extent.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-If I told my kids to put their shoes on and get a jacket and let&#39;s go  <br/>
have fun at something they clearly didn&#39;t want to go to, they very <br/>
well  might refuse to get in the car.  My 11 year old might go, but <br/>
she&#39;d be  upset with me and she&#39;d be miserable and it would affect our <br/>
relationship  negatively.   -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Then maybe the relationship is already affected negatively and the lack of  <br/>
willingness to go out is a symptom of that.  If it&#39;s not so at your house,  it <br/>
might be at others&#39;, and we should be discussing the ideas and how they  <br/>
affect or fit in with unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I think that if a child isn&#39;t going out because he&#39;s not allowed to  <br/>
or doesn&#39;t have the chance to, that&#39;s bad.  If a child isn&#39;t going  <br/>
out because he&#39;s afraid of the world and no one has ever gently tried <br/>
to  give him opportunities to do stuff outside of the house, that&#39;s <br/>
bad.   But if that&#39;s just his personality, then it&#39;s good when it&#39;s <br/>
honored and no  one&#39;s trying to change it.  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, unless his personality is going to keep unschooling from working well  <br/>
enough to be an honest, legitimate alternative to school.  And one of the  <br/>
questions asked  seemed to lean toward what if the parents and  children are all <br/>
introverts and are happy being home and not talking about  it?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-What if the home is a hive of activity but people only come in and  <br/>
out once in a while, and the child is still happy and thriving?   <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Then that example doesn&#39;t apply at all to the questions of what if children  <br/>
have few interests and mom has even fewer.<br/>

out until the compulsory attendance days are over.**<br/>
<br/>
(In California, I don&#39;t have to prove that I covered the curriculum, and I certainly don&#39;t have to do the silly part of covering specific topics in specific years.)<br/>
<br/>
I really thought that unschooling meant letting go of the curriculum as checklist.  I thought unschooling depended on the idea that the things that are important to know in life come up in life, and that if trigonometry doesn&#39;t come up, then it might not (gasp!) be necessary.  And that if it is necessary, later in life, it can be learned then.<br/>
<br/>
In all the discussions we&#39;ve had about not demonizing television, I never thought that moms who were worried about television were &quot;allowed&quot; (within the framework of the unschooling philosophy), to say &quot;turn off the TV, we&#39;re going to the festival, whether you want to or not&quot;.  (Assuming the child has been more graciously offered the opportunity and has declined it.)<br/>
<br/>
I made my child go to an art museum in January, because our group of friends was going.  I really thought I was committing an unschooling sin, when I did so, and really thought I would be a target for criticism if I mentioned it on this list.  He didn&#39;t show much interest in the exhibits, but at least he had his equally bored friends for company (a couple of the kids were interested), and we weren&#39;t in the museum for much more than an hour.  He liked playing in the sculpture garden and exploring the museum gift shop afterwards.<br/>

others who responded to Betsy were focusing on the going out aspects <br/>
of it. I thought Betsy was concerned about her son and that she was <br/>
getting a lot of &quot;go out&quot; advice.  I was just saying that &quot;go out&quot; <br/>
might not be what he wants or needs&quot; and maybe she could focus on <br/>
the &quot;bring in&quot;.  <br/>

Of course, none of us really knows for sure because we don&#39;t know <br/>
Betsy&#39;s son.  I think when it comes right down to it Betsy listening <br/>
to her instincts but making sure what she&#39;s listening to instincts <br/>
and not society-induced fears and worries.  <br/>

<br/>
Did you think there was a decent chance that he&#39;d have fun?<br/>
<br/>
Has he had fun on previous outings with those friends? And did he say he was<br/>
glad you made him go when (if) he had fun or would he still have rather<br/>
stayed home?<br/>
<br/>
Did the museum feel like something you &quot;should&quot; do? (For social reasons or<br/>
because he should be out in the world more or because he needs exposure to<br/>
more than his narrow range of interests?)<br/>
<br/>
As Sheila (I think) pointed out, we only get the benefit of the doubt on so<br/>
many &quot;You&#39;re going to have to trust me on this one. I really do think you&#39;ll<br/>
like it&quot;s. The more often we guess wrong, the less they trust us. And once<br/>
we lose their trust we need to be 100% on the mark with our guesses for<br/>
quite a long while in order to regain it!<br/>
<br/>
I think I too often approach things with a &quot;We should do this because we&#39;ll<br/>
have fun&quot; type of attitude. And that&#39;s no way to sell something! (Maybe it<br/>
is an engineer thing! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My husband on the other hand is sharing his interests with Kathryn. They&#39;re<br/>
doing things that he loves and his love is infecting her. (But it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
work if she didn&#39;t have an innate interest.)<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m learning to approach things in a more inviting her to come with me<br/>
because &quot;I know I&#39;m going to have fun with this&quot; attitude, rather than this<br/>
is something you should enjoy because I like it attitude, if that makes<br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to be out in the world in order to introduce him to stuff.<br/>
Though, at least with Kathryn it&#39;s difficult to strew things around the<br/>
house. It&#39;s rare that she&#39;ll pick something up that&#39;s laying around because<br/>
her attention isn&#39;t focused on her environment. It&#39;s focused on me and what<br/>
we can do next.<br/>
<br/>
But bringing other kids in can make what seemed like a piece of clutter<br/>
sitting about into something interesting :-) You haven&#39;t mentioned much<br/>
about having kids over. Is that something he doesn&#39;t like?<br/>

<br/>
Yep, but I think that it depends on what she&#39;s really feeling and why.<br/>
Is she feeling what she&#39;s feeling because she&#39;s depressed?  Or is the <br/>
child depressed?  Or has she just been talking to a mainstream-push-<br/>
your-child-to-be-a-superchild mom who planted fear and worry in her <br/>
head?  Has she recently compared her child to a more outgoing child <br/>
and started worrying?  Or is it honest to goodness maternal instinct <br/>
telling her that the child is in a stuck place and needs to be pushed <br/>
out of it? <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s the latter then I agree with everything you&#39;re saying.  I&#39;m <br/>
just not convinced that it always (or usually!) is the latter.  I <br/>
think that a LOT of women in our society don&#39;t know how to really <br/>
listen to their own instincts because they&#39;ve been taught all their <br/>
lives that they should do what is &quot;right&quot; according to mainstream <br/>
society instead of what they sense in their hearts to be true.  So <br/>
they ignore that instinct until they don&#39;t even know how to use it <br/>
anymore.  They &quot;feel&quot; their breastfed infant isn&#39;t getting enough so <br/>
they push formula and cereal onto him.  They &quot;feel&quot; their introvert <br/>
isn&#39;t getting enough socially so they push that onto him. <br/>
<br/>
So I think it&#39;s up to every woman to decide for herself what exactly <br/>
she&#39;s feeling and why.  If it&#39;s instinct, then definitely trust it <br/>
and do what it&#39;s telling you.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If introversion leads to isolation and entropy,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Entropy isn&#39;t good.  Isolation can be good, if it&#39;s what a person <br/>
needs. Or it can be bad if it&#39;s not what a person needs.  Some people <br/>
might create beautiful works of art or develop profound scientific <br/>
theories while in isolation and really thrive and become more in tune <br/>
with who they are.  Others might just go crazy or rot away in <br/>
isolation.  Some might need isolation for just a period of time.  An <br/>
hour or a day or a week or a month or a year.  Who really knows what <br/>
they need, other than the person himself, and maybe a mother who is <br/>
truly listening to her maternal instinct?  I&#39;m not saying that <br/>
unschooling is about isolating our kids, but that if we&#39;re trusting <br/>
our kids to know what they need, and they seem to be needing more <br/>
isolation, then I say give them isolation.  <br/>
<br/>
It all comes down to really getting to know our kids though, and <br/>
really learning to listen to our instincts (and knowing the <br/>
difference between instincts and fears) and trusting them.  We can&#39;t <br/>
really know if our kids are stuck, depressed and in a state of <br/>
entropy or if they&#39;re simply thriving in their isolation if we don&#39;t <br/>
know the kids well.  <br/>
<br/>
 and if what we&#39;re doing  does <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have SOME expectation of helping a child gather the information he <br/>
 </span></blockquote>needs to  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have some equivalent to the education voters have decided (however <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; introversion can be very bad.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The people in their state don&#39;t know each child individually, so how <br/>
could they possibly know what each child needs to know by the time <br/>
they&#39;re 18?  Even the child might not know what he needs to know by <br/>
the time he&#39;s 18, but if he&#39;s trusted to be a whole person and to <br/>
listen to himself and know what he needs, then he will have <br/>
everything that he needs by the time he&#39;s 18.  Even if that&#39;s <br/>
different than what &quot;the people in their state&quot; say he needs to <br/>
know.  <br/>
<br/>
There are people in a lot of states that say a child should know how <br/>
to read by the time he&#39;s 6 or 7 or at the latest 8.  Yet lots of <br/>
unschooled kids learn to read later than that.  Lots of would-be-<br/>
unschoolers lose their nerve to unschool when their 8 or 9 year old <br/>
still isn&#39;t reading and they listen to the fear in their heads that <br/>
tells them that their child needs something more and they make them <br/>
sit down for reading lessons.  Isn&#39;t that fear of a child not knowing <br/>
how to read similar to a  fear that a child is not going out enough?  <br/>
Just on a different level or to a different degree?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes, unless his personality is going to keep unschooling from <br/>
 </span></blockquote>working well  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; enough to be an honest, legitimate alternative to school. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can anyone ever have a personality that keeps unschooling from <br/>
working well?  One of the things that I really like about unschooling <br/>
is that it allows people to be whoever they are, and it allows that <br/>
to shine.  I&#39;ve seen how not allowing people to be who they are can <br/>
really lead to some difficult emotional issues, so I really like that <br/>
with unschooling we can just trust that no matter what the <br/>
personality, the child is accepted as he is and allowed to be that.  <br/>
<br/>
If we say that some kids should be pushed out of their personalities <br/>
because they aren&#39;t good personalities for unschooling, then it&#39;s not <br/>
true that we can trust children (and people in general) to learn what <br/>
they need to learn.  Then it would only be true that we can trust <br/>
SOME people to learn what they need to learn and the whole theory of <br/>
unschooling has just been shot down because we can no longer be sure <br/>
that we can trust our kids.  <br/>
<br/>
 And one of the  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; questions asked  seemed to lean toward what if the parents and  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>children are all <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; introverts and are happy being home and not talking about  it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess my answer would depend on knowing WHY they&#39;re not talking <br/>
about it.  Because if they&#39;re not talking about it because they&#39;re <br/>
afraid or insecure or hiding some kind of emotional pain, then <br/>
they&#39;re not really happy.  But if they are really happy and whole, <br/>
then a family of introverts who are really happy and whole being home <br/>
seems like a perfectly okay thing to me.  <br/>

So I  think it&#39;s up to every woman to decide for herself what exactly <br/>
she&#39;s  feeling and why.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
 <br/>
To &quot;decide&quot;?  <br/>
Or to keep trying to learn to know?<br/>
<br/>
The first, lots of people have decided they think they know what  they&#39;re <br/>
feeling and why, only to express much sorrow later over having deluded  <br/>
themselves or lived in justification or in doing what their mothers wanted them  to do.<br/>
 <br/>
There are people who come to these lists who are really terrified of  defying <br/>
their mothers, even though THEY are mothers with children.  Have  they <br/>
decided for themselves what exactly they&#39;re feeling and why?   Sometimes they don&#39;t <br/>
even see what they&#39;re writing.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=- I&#39;m not saying that <br/>
unschooling is about isolating our kids, but  that if we&#39;re trusting <br/>
our kids to know what they need, and they seem to be  needing more <br/>
isolation, then I say give them isolation.  <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Isolation comes from outside.  Isolation is something that is done to  <br/>
someone by someone else.  Isolation is done to fundamentalist homeschoolers  whose <br/>
parents sometimes don&#39;t even want them going to church, but they &quot;home  church&quot; <br/>
too.  That&#39;s what you&#39;ll pull up when you combine  homeschooling+isolation.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-There are people in a lot of states that say a child should know how  <br/>
to read by the time he&#39;s 6 or 7 or at the latest 8.  Yet lots of  <br/>
unschooled kids learn to read later than that. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
MOST Of the kids in school learn to read much later than that, if they were  <br/>
to define reading the way I do.  But in school, those who can&#39;t read were  <br/>
just uncooperative or learning disabled or had parents who were insufficiently  <br/>
involved.  It&#39;s never the school&#39;s fault.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- Lots of would-be-<br/>
unschoolers lose their nerve to unschool when  their 8 or 9 year old <br/>
still isn&#39;t reading and they listen to the fear in  their heads that <br/>
tells them that their child needs something more and they  make them <br/>
sit down for reading lessons. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Yes,and people here and in other unschooling places are able to help them  <br/>
through those fears.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Isn&#39;t that fear of a child not knowing <br/>
how to read similar to  a  fear that a child is not going out enough?  <br/>
Just on a different  level or to a different degree?  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
No.<br/>
When a child learns to read, you both know it, because he&#39;s reading.<br/>
 <br/>
If a family decides when a child is 15 that it might&#39;ve been WAY  better for <br/>
unschooling if they had done a lot more sooner, it will be too  late.  If the <br/>
relationship between the parents and children withers because  the parents <br/>
weren&#39;t engaging enough and so the child doesn&#39;t have an easy  conversant <br/>
relationship, and they&#39;re out of the habit of being together and  learning together, <br/>
their unschooling won&#39;t be the best it could be.<br/>
 <br/>
If people are wanting this list to put a stamp of approval on bare-minimal  <br/>
unschooling, it&#39;s not going to come from me. I have zero interest in making  <br/>
people feel better about doing less, personally.<br/>
 <br/>
In any case in which the parents aren&#39;t worried and the children are happy,  <br/>
none of this conversation matters at all.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Can anyone ever have a personality that keeps unschooling from  <br/>
working well? -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Bigtime.<br/>
 <br/>
Parents who are negative and whiney and ashamed of curiosity and have  no <br/>
interest in learning are going to be crap at unschooling.   People  who are mean <br/>
and violent and think children are to be seen and not heard, who  were abused <br/>
as children and haven&#39;t even begun to deal with that emotionally  shouldn&#39;t <br/>
unschool.  Their kids will probably be safer and better off in  school.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I&#39;ve seen how not allowing people to be who they are can <br/>
really  lead to some difficult emotional issues, so I really like that <br/>
with  unschooling we can just trust that no matter what the <br/>
personality, the child  is accepted as he is and allowed to be that.  <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
That sounds good, and in ideal circumstances it&#39;s great.<br/>
 <br/>
Some families don&#39;t have ideal circumstances, and unschooling won&#39;t work  for <br/>
them.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-If we say that some kids should be pushed out of their personalities  <br/>
because they aren&#39;t good personalities for unschooling, then it&#39;s not  <br/>
true that we can trust children (and people in general) to learn what  <br/>
they need to learn.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I think all children can learn through unschooling, I don&#39;t think all  <br/>
parents are suited to being unschooling parents.<br/>
 <br/>
It is possible that a child will already be so brainwashed by the age of  ten <br/>
or twelve that he can&#39;t undo school.  If he would rather be in school  and is <br/>
thoroughly convinced that school is the only place he can learn, then I  <br/>
think the parents should let him stay in school.  I think having a child  <br/>
homeschooled against his will is as bad as a kid being in school against his  will, <br/>
who wants out.<br/>
 <br/>
And if a child wants out of school and the parents say, &quot;Yes, sure, we will  <br/>
commit to this,&quot; then I think the child should be willing to DO things in lieu <br/>
 of school and the parents, too, should be very active in that child&#39;s life, <br/>
and  not just go home and shut the door and live a drab, negative life.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Then it would only be true that we can trust <br/>
SOME people to learn  what they need to learn and the whole theory of <br/>
unschooling has just been  shot down because we can no longer be sure <br/>
that we can trust our  kids. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
You have never read any long-years-experienced unschooler say that the  <br/>
schools should be abolished and everyone should unschool. The thousands of hours  <br/>
of writing that&#39;s been put in here, unschooling.com and various other places <br/>
has  stressed that it takes a LOT of change and awareness on the part of the <br/>
parents  to do this.  And it takes deschooling on the part of the child and of <br/>
the  parents.  It&#39;s not easy.  It&#39;s not something just anyone can do.   And <br/>
half-assed isn&#39;t good enough.  <br/>

deep inside of herself and find exactly what she&#39;s feeling and why.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; someone by someone else. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay.  I wasn&#39;t considering isolation as necessarily something done <br/>
to someone by someone else.  I was thinking more along the lines of <br/>
seclusion. Not someone secluding someone else against his will, but <br/>
someone desiring to be alone a lot.  If someone craves seclusion, <br/>
then I think we should honor his desire to be alone.  <br/>
<br/>
And yet I agree that sometimes it looks like seclusion is what <br/>
someone wants but it&#39;s just that we haven&#39;t done enough to get <br/>
through and develop a good relationship with him or provide him just <br/>
the right thing that he  needs.  <br/>
<br/>
Deciding which exactly is needed is difficult sometimes and I don&#39;t <br/>
think we should take it lightly.  <br/>
<br/>
Isolation is done to fundamentalist homeschoolers  whose <br/>

<br/>
I certainly didn&#39;t mean that!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>late.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had friends who don&#39;t agree with unschooling say a similar <br/>
thing to me about school subjects.  They say stuff like, &quot;What if <br/>
when they&#39;re adults they wish you would have taught them math and <br/>
reading more formally and at an earlier age? What if you realize too <br/>
late that you were wrong about not sending them to school?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Are you saying that we can trust a child to learn to read when he&#39;s <br/>
ready but we can&#39;t always trust a child to know how social he should <br/>
be? <br/>
<br/>
If the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>learning together, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their unschooling won&#39;t be the best it could be.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems like I&#39;m arguing a lot but the thing is I agree with you.  I <br/>
just find myself saying yes, &quot;but&quot; after a lot of things.  I agree <br/>
BUT I think we have to allow for some uncommon, even difficult <br/>
personalities to be who they are even when who they are doesn&#39;t <br/>
produce lives that look like what other unschoolers are doing. <br/>
<br/>
Having a good relationship with our kids is very, very important and <br/>
we should do as much as we can to cultivate it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad my kids and I do have an easy conversant <br/>
relationship, and I can&#39;t imagine being happy with anything less.  I <br/>
have read about people who are people of few words though, who only <br/>
speak when they must.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a normal personality <br/>
trait or something else.  If it is a normal personality trait then <br/>
I&#39;d say that it&#39;s okay for the person to be a person of few words.  <br/>
It can&#39;t be wrong to be who you are.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that if someone is a person has a personality that&#39;s <br/>
very non-conversant that he&#39;s not going to do very well in school <br/>
either.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If people are wanting this list to put a stamp of approval on bare-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>in making  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people feel better about doing less, personally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m certainly not advocating bare-minimal unschooling.  I&#39;m simply <br/>
saying that we should give the child what he wants even when what he <br/>
wants is a lot of solitude.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In any case in which the parents aren&#39;t worried and the children <br/>
 </span></blockquote>are happy,  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; none of this conversation matters at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is another &quot;yes but&quot; thing for me.  I&#39;d say yes, BUT maybe the <br/>
parents are worried for the wrong reason.  Or maybe the kid is happy <br/>
but because the parents don&#39;t understand his personality and can&#39;t <br/>
imagine how anyone could be happy living life the way the child has <br/>
chosen to live it, the parents could perceive a child as being <br/>
unhappy when he really isn&#39;t.  <br/>
  <br/>
I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s how it&#39;s usually going to be.  What&#39;s usually <br/>
going to be is what you&#39;re saying.  That a parent just hasn&#39;t worked <br/>
hard enough to develop a good relationship and hasn&#39;t done enough of <br/>
the right thing to expose them to enough things, and just needs to <br/>
work harder.  My &quot;but&quot; is that there could be exceptions and that <br/>
because there could be exceptions, a parent needs to look at his <br/>
family&#39;s unique personalities and situations and figure out if it&#39;s a <br/>
case of the parent not doing enough or a case of the kid not needing <br/>
more or maybe a unique combination of both.  <br/>

<br/>
But most of that isn&#39;t personality.  Most of that is attitude that <br/>
they&#39;ve developed from some situation that isn&#39;t representative of <br/>

<br/>
Right, but a child who&#39;s been forced to be in school might have some <br/>
healing to do and might need to do what looks like brooding and being <br/>
negative for awhile.  Maybe not most kids and maybe not usually, but <br/>
people heal and deal with things in different ways.  <br/>

altogether.   I&#39;m just saying that if we&#39;re going to trust our kids, <br/>
it could be that sometimes our kids might be desiring what looks to <br/>
us like &quot;not enough&quot;.  Some people might worry about not enough <br/>
reading, others might worry about not enough social activity, others <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-258953958">I agree that if we are to give our children the freedom, time, and<br/>
space to know what they need and then trust that this is what they<br/>
need, then if being as what is deemed by sociey as &quot;introverted&quot; is<br/>
what suits them and is who they wish to be, then we should allow our<br/>
children to be who they wish to be, not attempting to &quot;change&quot; them.<br/>
As we cannot change others, we can only change ourselves and our<br/>
reactions to others.<br/>
<br/>
Because honestly, I think that my children prefer to be with others in<br/>
smaller groups and at times just on their own. And personally, I do<br/>
not see anything &quot;wrong&quot; with this, although I know as a societal<br/>
whole it is considered to be &quot;bad&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
They learn well and interact with smaller groups of people, and I do<br/>
not think in the name of broadening their worldly scope so to speak<br/>
that I would ever consider forcing them into being &quot;out there&quot; more or<br/>
&quot;doing&quot; more or &quot;being&quot; more active than they wish to be. I might<br/>
suggest or other these types of broader means in an attempt to show<br/>
them another view of life or something that they may wish to learn<br/>
possibly, but never force them for the sake of trying to &quot;change&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
Introverted or extoverted, I think these are labels that we give toour<br/>
children to attempt to classify them as somehow &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. Good<br/>
supposedly being extroverted by societal standards and introverted as<br/>
somehow that something is &quot;wrong&quot; with our children if they are.<br/>
<br/>
Why can society not let our children just be who they are? Children,<br/>
people in society carving out their own way in life!:)<br/>

&gt; she&#39;s  feeling and why.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ----------------------<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; To &quot;decide&quot;?  <br/>
&gt; Or to keep trying to learn to know?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The first, lots of people have decided they think they know what <br/>
they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; feeling and why, only to express much sorrow later over having deluded  <br/>
&gt; themselves or lived in justification or in doing what their mothers<br/>
wanted them  to do.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; There are people who come to these lists who are really terrified of<br/>
 defying <br/>
&gt; their mothers, even though THEY are mothers with children.  Have  they <br/>
&gt; decided for themselves what exactly they&#39;re feeling and why?  <br/>
Sometimes they don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; even see what they&#39;re writing.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=- I&#39;m not saying that <br/>
&gt; unschooling is about isolating our kids, but  that if we&#39;re trusting <br/>
&gt; our kids to know what they need, and they seem to be  needing more <br/>
&gt; isolation, then I say give them isolation.  <br/>
&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Isolation comes from outside.  Isolation is something that is done to  <br/>
&gt; someone by someone else.  Isolation is done to fundamentalist<br/>
homeschoolers  whose <br/>
&gt; parents sometimes don&#39;t even want them going to church, but they<br/>
&quot;home  church&quot; <br/>
&gt; too.  That&#39;s what you&#39;ll pull up when you combine <br/>
homeschooling+isolation.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=-There are people in a lot of states that say a child should know<br/>
how  <br/>
&gt; to read by the time he&#39;s 6 or 7 or at the latest 8.  Yet lots of  <br/>
&gt; unschooled kids learn to read later than that. -=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; MOST Of the kids in school learn to read much later than that, if<br/>
they were  <br/>
&gt; to define reading the way I do.  But in school, those who can&#39;t read<br/>
were  <br/>
&gt; just uncooperative or learning disabled or had parents who were<br/>
insufficiently  <br/>
&gt; involved.  It&#39;s never the school&#39;s fault.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=- Lots of would-be-<br/>
&gt; unschoolers lose their nerve to unschool when  their 8 or 9 year old <br/>
&gt; still isn&#39;t reading and they listen to the fear in  their heads that <br/>
&gt; tells them that their child needs something more and they  make them <br/>
&gt; sit down for reading lessons. -=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Yes,and people here and in other unschooling places are able to help<br/>
them  <br/>
&gt; through those fears.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=-Isn&#39;t that fear of a child not knowing <br/>
&gt; how to read similar to  a  fear that a child is not going out enough?  <br/>
&gt; Just on a different  level or to a different degree?  -=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; No.<br/>
&gt; When a child learns to read, you both know it, because he&#39;s reading.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; If a family decides when a child is 15 that it might&#39;ve been WAY <br/>
better for <br/>
&gt; unschooling if they had done a lot more sooner, it will be too <br/>
late.  If the <br/>
&gt; relationship between the parents and children withers because  the<br/>
parents <br/>
&gt; weren&#39;t engaging enough and so the child doesn&#39;t have an easy <br/>
conversant <br/>
&gt; relationship, and they&#39;re out of the habit of being together and <br/>
learning together, <br/>
&gt; their unschooling won&#39;t be the best it could be.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; If people are wanting this list to put a stamp of approval on<br/>
bare-minimal  <br/>
&gt; unschooling, it&#39;s not going to come from me. I have zero interest in<br/>
making  <br/>
&gt; people feel better about doing less, personally.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; In any case in which the parents aren&#39;t worried and the children are<br/>
happy,  <br/>
&gt; none of this conversation matters at all.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=-Can anyone ever have a personality that keeps unschooling from  <br/>
&gt; working well? -=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Bigtime.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Parents who are negative and whiney and ashamed of curiosity and<br/>
have  no <br/>
&gt; interest in learning are going to be crap at unschooling.   People <br/>
who are mean <br/>
&gt; and violent and think children are to be seen and not heard, who <br/>
were abused <br/>
&gt; as children and haven&#39;t even begun to deal with that emotionally <br/>
shouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; unschool.  Their kids will probably be safer and better off in  school.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=- I&#39;ve seen how not allowing people to be who they are can <br/>
&gt; really  lead to some difficult emotional issues, so I really like that <br/>
&gt; with  unschooling we can just trust that no matter what the <br/>
&gt; personality, the child  is accepted as he is and allowed to be that.  <br/>
&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; That sounds good, and in ideal circumstances it&#39;s great.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Some families don&#39;t have ideal circumstances, and unschooling won&#39;t<br/>
work  for <br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=-If we say that some kids should be pushed out of their<br/>
personalities  <br/>
&gt; because they aren&#39;t good personalities for unschooling, then it&#39;s not  <br/>
&gt; true that we can trust children (and people in general) to learn what  <br/>
&gt; they need to learn.-=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I think all children can learn through unschooling, I don&#39;t think all  <br/>
&gt; parents are suited to being unschooling parents.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It is possible that a child will already be so brainwashed by the<br/>
age of  ten <br/>
&gt; or twelve that he can&#39;t undo school.  If he would rather be in<br/>
school  and is <br/>
&gt; thoroughly convinced that school is the only place he can learn,<br/>
then I  <br/>
&gt; think the parents should let him stay in school.  I think having a<br/>
child  <br/>
&gt; homeschooled against his will is as bad as a kid being in school<br/>
against his  will, <br/>
&gt; who wants out.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; And if a child wants out of school and the parents say, &quot;Yes, sure,<br/>
we will  <br/>
&gt; commit to this,&quot; then I think the child should be willing to DO<br/>
things in lieu <br/>
&gt;  of school and the parents, too, should be very active in that<br/>
child&#39;s life, <br/>
&gt; and  not just go home and shut the door and live a drab, negative life.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; -=-Then it would only be true that we can trust <br/>
&gt; SOME people to learn  what they need to learn and the whole theory of <br/>
&gt; unschooling has just been  shot down because we can no longer be sure <br/>
&gt; that we can trust our  kids. -=-<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; You have never read any long-years-experienced unschooler say that the  <br/>
&gt; schools should be abolished and everyone should unschool. The<br/>
thousands of hours  <br/>
&gt; of writing that&#39;s been put in here, unschooling.com and various<br/>
other places <br/>
&gt; has  stressed that it takes a LOT of change and awareness on the<br/>
part of the <br/>
&gt; parents  to do this.  And it takes deschooling on the part of the<br/>
child and of <br/>
&gt; the  parents.  It&#39;s not easy.  It&#39;s not something just anyone can<br/>
do.   And <br/>
&gt; half-assed isn&#39;t good enough.  <br/>

I would agree with you. But I think I would also add though that some<br/>
people may not have the financial resources or the research skills as<br/>
parents to help facillitate an exposure to learning outside of the home.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that this is where we as the people who have the resources,<br/>
support, and guidance, that it is our job to step up to the plate and<br/>
help them, as we on this list and on many others have and are doing<br/>
just that!:)<br/>

<br/>
-=-I have had friends who don&#39;t  agree with unschooling say a similar <br/>
thing to me about school  subjects.  They say stuff like, &quot;What if <br/>
when they&#39;re adults they  wish you would have taught them math and <br/>
reading more formally and at an  earlier age? What if you realize too <br/>
late that you were wrong about not  sending them to school?&quot;  -=-<br/>
---------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
There are classes and books for learning to do math which are ONLY aimed  <br/>
toward adults.  Kirby&#39;s taking math 099, and having started without any  <br/>
knowledge of formal mathematical notation he&#39;s getting an A after six weeks or  so.  <br/>
 <br/>
Kirby&#39;s 18.  Whatever I wish I had done with the ten year old Kirby or  the <br/>
12 year old Kirby, it&#39;s too late.  Those days are gone.   <br/>
 <br/>
Math and reading are skills kids can gain.  <br/>
Freedom and a childhood relationship with a mother and the ability to learn  <br/>
naturally as a child are NOT things that can be gained as adults.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
-=-Are you saying that we can trust a child to learn to read when  he&#39;s <br/>
ready but we can&#39;t always trust a child to know how social he should  <br/>
be? -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about &quot;being social.&quot;  I&#39;m talking about exposure to  the <br/>
world.  A person can go to a museum or a movie without chatting with  others.  A <br/>
mom can enrich the home environment without throwing  parties.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-It seems like I&#39;m arguing a lot but the thing is I agree with you.   I <br/>
just find myself saying yes, &quot;but&quot; after a lot of things. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
It seems your defending people settling for bare-minimum effort and  <br/>
activity.  It sounds like you&#39;re justifying people doing a half-assed job  of <br/>
unschooling.  I don&#39;t guess you mean to do that, but it seems like  it.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I have read about people who are people of few words though, who only  <br/>
speak when they must.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a normal personality  <br/>
trait or something else.  If it is a normal personality trait then  <br/>
I&#39;d say that it&#39;s okay for the person to be a person of few words.   <br/>
It can&#39;t be wrong to be who you are.  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
If there are enough factors that a family isn&#39;t unschooling well, then they  <br/>
should put their kids in school.<br/>
 <br/>
Nobody here is authorized to let anyone off the hook about compulsory  <br/>
education laws.  All of us put together can&#39;t save ONE FAMILY from the  place where <br/>
they live if they are found to just be cruising in some lazy,  avoidant <br/>
fashion.  I&#39;m really unlikely to get in trouble, as my kids are  doing well and <br/>
would impress any government officials who might question  them about their lives, <br/>
if we had somone complain about us.<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t try to defend a family that had said, &quot;Well, I made  <br/>
some offers, but my kids weren&#39;t interested, so I just let them stay home in  <br/>
their rooms because that&#39;s how they are.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling is one possible way to homeschool.  Homeschooling is one  <br/>
possible way for people to fulfill state requirements.  If people can&#39;t do  it, they <br/>
can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t.  If they DO want to do it, it&#39;s an active and  difficult <br/>
way of life that can&#39;t be sloughed off until maybe a few years from  now.  It <br/>
has to be done and done right and well, or it&#39;s just  neglect.   <br/>
 <br/>
When people come here and say &quot;Unschooling is just neglect,&quot; I&#39;d like to  say <br/>
&quot;No, neglect isn&#39;t unschooling.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It seems there are people in this conversation suggesting that neglect is  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d like for those few people to stop doing that on this list.  If you  want <br/>
to start another list for &quot;unschooling is whatever the hell you want it to  be <br/>
and introverted kids shouldn&#39;t ever be stimulated beyond their comfort at the <br/>
 moment,&quot; it&#39;s really easy to start a yahoolist.<br/>

But most  of that isn&#39;t personality.  Most of that is attitude that <br/>
they&#39;ve  developed from some situation that isn&#39;t representative of <br/>
who they really  are deep down inside.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Then either they can&#39;t unschool, or they need to start NOW, right now, not  <br/>
tomorrow, recovering from their bad attutide and &quot;situation.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
If a family doesn&#39;t have the ease of communication to make unschooling  work, <br/>
they shouldn&#39;t unschool.<br/>
 <br/>
If a parent&#39;s going to say, &quot;This is just how I am, I have a RIGHT to be  <br/>
angry and negative because of the ozone level and the war&quot; then that person  <br/>
should put the kids in school and stay home worrying about things she can&#39;t  <br/>
change.  At least maybe the kids will find friends at school or teachers  who WILL <br/>
see them and be positive with them.  <br/>
 <br/>
There are depressed and unfocussed parents who don&#39;t have the ability to  <br/>
create a busy, happy, child-nurturing environment.  But that&#39;s  okay!   They just <br/>
need to have other people teach their kids and not  take on a project they <br/>
can&#39;t handle.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Right, but a child who&#39;s been forced to be in school might have some  <br/>
healing to do and might need to do what looks like brooding and being  <br/>
negative for awhile.  Maybe not most kids and maybe not usually, but  <br/>
people heal and deal with things in different ways.  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
They don&#39;t have ten years to heal.  They have now.  RIght now,  get on it, or <br/>
don&#39;t try.<br/>
 <br/>
Just for a wild, made-up example, say a family used to eat out a lot, twice  <br/>
a day or more, and if the kids had money and used to be able to get food out <br/>
of  vending machines, but the family decides no, we&#39;re going to only eat at <br/>
home  now.  It will be fun!  It will be healthier.<br/>
 <br/>
How long before they need to go grocery shopping?<br/>
How long before they really need to start preparing some food?<br/>
How long can they just not have any dishes to use, or a knife to cut cheese  <br/>
and vegetables with?  <br/>
Can the mom say &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know how to cook, but my kids are NEVER  going <br/>
to eat at restaurants again&quot;?  <br/>
Should the dad say, &quot;We&#39;re saving a LOT of money not eating out.  I&#39;m  going <br/>
to really think about how I want to do this food-at-home thing before we  <br/>
invest any money in it.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
They can&#39;t wait. They have to feed those kids right away, and often.<br/>
They had alternatives, but they made a choice.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling parents have alternatives.  If they&#39;re going to unschool,  they <br/>
need to DO it, not just be passive hopeful observers.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I&#39;m just saying that if we&#39;re going to trust our kids, <br/>
it could be  that sometimes our kids might be desiring what looks to <br/>
us like &quot;not  enough&quot;.  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Given a rich environment and happy surroundings, I have confidence that any  <br/>
child can and will learn.  Given a dull environment and depressed or  <br/>
uninvolved parents, no ability to get out and about, no new input, I have  confidence <br/>
that a child could slow down and stop learning much at all.  <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Trust our kids&quot; doesn&#39;t work in a vacuum.  That idea of trusting kids  to <br/>
learn is entirely wrapped in the assumption of a happy, involving, rich  <br/>
environment.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-The topic of abolishing schools is a completely different topic  <br/>
altogether.  =-<br/>
 <br/>
No it isn&#39;t.  If unschooling doesn&#39;t even work for those family who  <br/>
consciously choose it, it would be insane to suggest that MORE people try  it.  And it <br/>
is chosen because there are alternatives.  There are  public, private, <br/>
correspondence, and at-home school options.  If someone is  unschooling out of <br/>
laziness, it&#39;s not going to work.  It will only work  when the main unschooling <br/>
parent has the intent and ability to make life bigger  and better than it would <br/>
have been without the plan to unschool, and bigger and  better than it would be <br/>
with a curriculum, and bigger and better than school  would have been.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Some people might worry about not enough <br/>
reading, others might worry  about not enough social activity, others <br/>
might worry about not enough  conversation. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m worried about moms who seem worried about not enough lively activity,  <br/>
not enough learning.<br/>

Julie, you and Josh are always in a power struggle over everything.   I&#39;m not <br/>
telling you something you don&#39;t already know.  Stop caring about  what he <br/>
thinks about things so much.  Buy it, don&#39;t show it to him, put it  on the shelf, <br/>
enjoy it yourself and don&#39;t worry about what he thinks.  It&#39;s  irrelavent. <br/>
 <br/>
I happen to know that Josh is capable of cool conversations.  I had  one with <br/>
him about his Benjamin Franklin action figure.  And classical  music!  I&#39;ve <br/>
seen him do improv on a stage with a big group of kids and  I&#39;ve seen him <br/>
participate in boffery with complicated rules.  Maybe the  reason he doesn&#39;t have <br/>
cool conversations with you is because you expect more  than he wants to give.  <br/>
The power struggle interferes.  When you push,  he pushes back.  You&#39;re too <br/>
much alike.  <br/>
 <br/>
Try not talking to him for a day.  Be quiet and observe.  Don&#39;t  criticize.  <br/>
Don&#39;t roll your eyes.  Don&#39;t give it the old Al Gore  sigh.  Don&#39;t complain.  <br/>
Don&#39;t condemn.*  Create a vacuum.   Not a punitive one, but one of open <br/>
acceptance of everything he wants or does,  quietly, happily and without anxiety <br/>
about how or what he&#39;s doing.  As  if you&#39;re content with the world just the way <br/>
it is.  And if you&#39;re not  content, fake it until you make it.  <br/>
 <br/>
Unplug from that power struggle, dear.  <br/>
 <br/>
*Dale Carnegie, in How to Win Friends and Influence People:  Never  <br/>
criticize, condemn or complain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415353471">I can&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t try to defend a family that had said, &quot;Well, I made  <br/>
some offers, but my kids weren&#39;t interested, so I just let them stay home in  <br/>
their rooms because that&#39;s how they are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this. First I will introduce myself cos this is the 3rd time I have posted without saying who I am. I am Ruth, I unschool 7 kids between the ages of 6 year old twins up to a 15 old son in the UK. I joined this list to hear how others see unschooling. I have had a lot of flack for it and even had my mother complain about me to the education authority over it and had a social worker round as a result. The social worker was happy but relations with my mother ended over this and other things she had done. I know people like this whose kids sit around the house all day bored in the name of unschooling.   They go nowhere and don&#39;t do very much in the home either. they complain to my kids about their lives. I find it hard to understand parents who think that doing absolutely nothing at all to create a stimulating atmosphere is unschooling.  I think unschooling is harder than structured homeschooling cos it is harder to make opportunities to get a child&#39;s creativity going everyday than say sitting them down and say now we are doing maths for an hour.  Some people don&#39;t see that.  Unschooling was the hardest thing I have ever done  cos I have had to let go of all my preconceived notions of how children learn and how I was taught and trust them to know what they need to know. Not what others think they should know. <br/>
