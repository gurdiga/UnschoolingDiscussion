That&#39;s what we used to do when the kids all shared a room.  &quot;Everybody pick <br/>
up 20 things!&quot; and with the four of us, that was a lot of picking up!  They&#39;d <br/>
lose track and start over. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Well that sounds great and I&#39;m sure you will see more and more of those<br/>
kinds of things happening around the house. Patience is a great thing to<br/>
keep in mind. Plus, for those who are trying to change a few things at once,<br/>
there is bound to be a &quot;what&#39;s going on&quot; kind of attitude showing. I also<br/>
find that when I want to change something I just let it happen or not<br/>
instead of having a whole discussion about it before the fact. We may talk<br/>
about the changes later but I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it by saying,<br/>
&quot;okay now, this is what we are going to be doing around here.&quot; The one thing<br/>
that comes to mind is me easing up on how the house looks. I didn&#39;t announce<br/>
to everyone I would try to let things go, I just stopped asking for so much.<br/>
Now things get done without me even asking.<br/>

That&#39;s so hard to describe, but there&#39;s a tension to it.  If you&#39;re holding a <br/>
rope and someone&#39;s pulling the other end, you can&#39;t just let go all at once <br/>
or they fall on their ass and they strangely do NOT seem grateful that you&#39;ve <br/>
let go of the rope you were holding them with.    <br/>
<br/>
&quot;You must have slack.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps slack is a better first step than cutting all the ropes, untying <br/>
everything, and then getting grumpy that things are drifting away or falling on <br/>
their butts.<br/>

like to clean up.   I really just feel like playing all day and <br/>
leaving all the messes behind&quot;, do you just say, &quot;Ok&quot; and try not to <br/>
resent it?  <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m working on is trying not to ask for anything at all <br/>
housework-wise, even cleaning up after themselves until I&#39;ve modeled <br/>
doing housework sweetly and joyfully for some time. Because they <br/>
say &quot;No, I&#39;d rather not&quot; more often than not.  Or they&#39;ll so &quot;Ok&quot; but <br/>
with a whine and a resentful sigh.  After I&#39;ve modeled a good <br/>
attitude for some time I&#39;ll SLOWLY start suggesting them doing <br/>
something with me now and then.  Does that sound reasonable?  <br/>
<br/>
De-schooling was MUCH easier than de-choring in our family.  Probably <br/>
because there was a lot less de-schooling to do than there was de-<br/>
choring.  I suspect it has a lot to do with my attitude toward <br/>
housework. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740020938">Now, I am new to this whole unschooling thing so what we do here is<br/>
probably so nutty. When Nicolas turned about 5 I started to give him a<br/>
little responsibility for his things. Then just recently I started an<br/>
allowance. He needs to help out in order to earn his money. I don&#39;t ask<br/>
him for much, an occasional throw out the trash or clean up your area. I<br/>
try to keep it nice and sweet and more of a request than a demand.<br/>
Sometimes I get the old &quot;OKAY OKAY&quot; and I just tell him it was a small<br/>
favor he could do to really help me out and he doesn&#39;t mind. He doesn&#39;t<br/>
get money weekly at all, just when I feel he has really earned it! I<br/>
know that might be harsh, but really he doesn&#39;t need it, its more of an<br/>
incentive. He keeps it all and has NEVER used it! I admit that I am<br/>
still a nag after I have cleaned and I see a mess after all my hard<br/>
work. I am trying to get better at this. I also have a thing about where<br/>
the toys and items are placed. I HAVE to have all the legos with the<br/>
legos - anal. So, he is used to that. Most of the time they end up where<br/>
they belong and that makes me happy!! I just tell him that if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
it that way, they will always be where he can find them. On those<br/>
occasions where he is looking madly for something, I try to point out<br/>
that when he finds it, he should put it in ITS spot so he will find it<br/>
easier next time. <br/>
<br/>
I NEVER ask them to help me clean though. I have my own way and I know I<br/>
will just end up redoing it if they clean for me. They tidy up and I do<br/>
the cleaning. I usually don&#39;t mind too much, its just the darn tile<br/>
floors that kill me here. They get so darn dirty. I also use all<br/>
essential oils and vinegar and baking soda and borax to clean. It smells<br/>
so lovely after I mop the floors! <br/>

I read that when it came back on list and didn&#39;t come out sounding at all<br/>
like I meant for it to!! In my own little head it all went beautifully!!<br/>
Sometimes I go to my own little world. But it&#39;s okay, they know me there!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We never had many rules and restrictions at all even when we did have some.<br/>
So for me to ease up more on what the kids *needed* to clean up, it wasn&#39;t<br/>
much of a stretch. So years ago, going from mandatory clean up every night<br/>
to just letting the night go by without it, wasn&#39;t a big deal. Of course<br/>
that was really the only thing we changed, cleaning up so much all the time.<br/>
We never restricted food or tv and such and never did school so it all went<br/>
smoothly here. Making big changes all at once I don&#39;t think is a good way to<br/>
go about it. And sometimes, depending on the situation, just letting things<br/>
happen or not is better instead of announcing it first. Again, depending on<br/>
the situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140788527">Ivory asked:<br/>
~~I don&#39;t know if I have any answers, but I also would like more info on <br/>
&quot;dechoring&quot; from people who have been there.~~<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more of a shift in the parent&#39;s attitude than the kids at first.  If a person appears grumpy about cleaning, the kids will pick up on that and immediately assume that cleaning is a real bummer.  If you hear yourself complaining about something needing cleaned, everyone else hears the complaining too.  If YOU obviously don&#39;t want to do it, there&#39;s a good chance that your kids won&#39;t be overly excited about it either.  Complaining leaves a bad vibe in the air--not a good selling point.  <br/>
<br/>
If a parent makes something sound like a really big deal, it becomes even bigger in a child&#39;s mind.  If it&#39;s a big, negative deal, it may become even more negative for a kid.  A positive attitude sets a much more pleasant stage for others to walk out on.  Set the example you would like others to follow.  <br/>
<br/>
There is definitely a transition period after a proclamation like &quot;NO MORE CHORES&quot; is given.  For a kid it may be like being set free from prison, and for awhile they may want to push their newfound freedom to the limit.  But slowly, cleaning and picking up will be no big deal, as long as the parents are not making it a big deal.  My kids do a lot more picking up now than they did a couple of years ago, and there are more and more days when I get home and the dishes have been ran, the counters are wiped down, and the house is almost....clean.  Not everyday, but there are days when I don&#39;t want to do it either.  And some days I don&#39;t.  The kids have that same right.  <br/>
<br/>
Plan on doing most of the cleaning for awhile.  Better yet, plan on doing ALL of the cleaning for awhile, and whenever someone else pitches in, you may appreciate it more.  Try not to look at it as &quot;I have to do it all!&quot;, because you don&#39;t have to do it all.  There&#39;s always a choice.  If you don&#39;t feel like cleaning today, then don&#39;t.  Will the house get messier?  Yup.  Is it a big deal?  Shouldn&#39;t be.  During de-choring your house is going to be messier.  It&#39;s a fact.  But little by little things will change, and you will notice things getting done that you didn&#39;t have to do and didn&#39;t have to demand done.  It won&#39;t happen overnight.  It probably won&#39;t happen in three months.  It may not happen in the first year if a parent walks in day after day, exasperated with the fact that a room isn&#39;t clean and tidy.  When you say to your kids, &quot;hey, why didn&#39;t you clean that up?&quot;, the first thing that may go through their minds is, &quot;well why didn&#39;t you?&quot;  It works both ways.  <br/>
<br/>
Cleaning doesn&#39;t have to be a big deal.  Don&#39;t make it a big deal and your kids may be more inclined to follow in your footsteps.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When Nicolas turned about 5 I started to give him a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think when parents talk about &quot;giving responsibility&quot; they generally mean<br/>
they expect the child to take care of something to the parent&#39;s standards<br/>
while allowing the child to suffer the &quot;natural&quot; consequences of their<br/>
choices.  The parent may set lower standards for a child but the standards<br/>
are still the parent&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
True responsibility means you are able to weigh the consequences of the<br/>
options open to you and choose what works best for you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then just recently I started an<br/>
&gt; allowance. He needs to help out in order to earn his money.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are pitfalls of tying allowance to performance.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like good training for the business world. But unlike a real job<br/>
where someone has choices about what type of work to do and the atmosphere<br/>
they like to work in, the work available at home is limited to what the<br/>
parent is willing to pay for. That&#39;s fine and resembles the working world if<br/>
the child wants to earn extra money. But as a sole source of income it<br/>
doesn&#39;t resemble real life at all.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the nice and sweet asking is good!<br/>
<br/>
I think when no isn&#39;t an acceptable answer, we shouldn&#39;t disguise it as a<br/>
request. Not even a little bit. If we&#39;re requesting, it should be the type<br/>
of request we&#39;d make of an adult. We should recognize that we&#39;re imposing on<br/>
someone to help us out and asking them to do us a favor. And we should be<br/>
aware that we owe them something in return, such as a sincere thank you and<br/>
appreciation at the very least.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; know that might be harsh, but really he doesn&#39;t need it, its more of an<br/>

sure is right is still okay.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I admit that I am<br/>
&gt; still a nag after I have cleaned and I see a mess after all my hard<br/>
&gt; work. I am trying to get better at this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s good to be honest about our feelings! But, yes, it&#39;s better to<br/>
examine our feelings in a larger context. We shouldn&#39;t impose a decrease in<br/>
someone else&#39;s joy in order to increase our joy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I also have a thing about where<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty anal too about organizing. (Not so anal about getting around *to*<br/>
organizing though ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But the way I see it is that if we&#39;re asking someone to do us a favor, part<br/>
of what we owe them is appreciation for how ever they get the job done.<br/>
People who want to help don&#39;t mind some direction in how it gets done. But<br/>
when there are exacting requirements from the asker and disappointment at<br/>
the job done then it doesn&#39;t encourage someone to volunteer to help out that<br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps us approach it with the right attitude that will encourage<br/>
help if we look at our kids help as doing us a favor, not conscripted labor.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some cleaning guide recommended that when you have a choice between hard<br/>
getting/easy putting away and easy getting/hard putting away that it helps<br/>
to choose the first. We&#39;re usually more motivated to expend energy to find<br/>
something than we are to expend energy to put it away.<br/>
<br/>
Organzing does, of course, help make finding easier! But I did see that<br/>
before puberty that my daughter would find organizing overwhelming. She<br/>
truly couldn&#39;t look at stuff and see a plan of attack, even though I&#39;d tried<br/>
various suggestions. Now it&#39;s *much* easier for her. Not because I trained<br/>
her but just because she&#39;s older and her brain works differently.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve noticed that when I&#39;m searching for something I don&#39;t appreciate<br/>
someone telling me that I should have put them where they belonged! I might<br/>
appreciate someone helping me put it away later, though.<br/>

evaluated, I&#39;d be pretty furious.<br/>
<br/>
My two oldest and I read about the sustainable earth one day--someone sent <br/>
a link. We grabbed our cuisinaire rods and used them to represent visually <br/>
the comparisons that were being made. Then I pulled up excel, and we <br/>
figured out the daily expenditure for our household and compared it to the <br/>
world average this website was giving through the cuisinaire rods. Very <br/>
sobering.<br/>
<br/>
Then, my kids asked for money, so we figured out with a pie chart what <br/>
percentage of our household income goes where. I showed them that whatever <br/>
gets leftover is what we get to spend. We made up envelopes with pictures <br/>
on the front representing each budget category--mortgage, car, groceries, <br/>
classes, savings, utilities, etc. Now, they get $40 every month as income; <br/>
they then divvy the appropriate percentage out to each &quot;bill,&quot; and whatever <br/>
is left over is their&#39;s to spend, save, whatever. Their income is tied only <br/>
to the household income and expenditures, just like mine and dh&#39;s. This has <br/>
been helpful for me as well as the kids. It helps us all keep our budget in <br/>
mind and our spending on track. The kids understand in concrete ways where <br/>
the money comes from, where it goes, and why.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good point.  When a parent sends a child to go clean their room, however &#39;clean&#39; the room ends up being should be up to the child.  It&#39;s THEIR room, and THEIR stuff, and they should be able to organize it to their own liking.  <br/>
<br/>
~~I HAVE to have all the legos with the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why? <br/>
<br/>
~~Organzing does, of course, help make finding easier!~~<br/>
<br/>
That depends on who does the organizing.  It may help the organizer to find things more easily, but someone else may have organized it a different way, and may not see any rhyme or reason to the &#39;organization&#39;.  If one person says,&quot;That&#39;s where it goes&quot;, another might ask, &quot;Why?&quot;, and the response to the why? should be a careful one.  Just because I like to keep the scissors in the junk drawer in the kitchen doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s where they should go.  Someone else may use them in an entirely different part of the house more often than I use them, so maybe their placement of the scissors makes more sense than mine.  At least to them it does.  You can force a person to put things away in a certain place, but you cannot force a person to be &#39;organized&#39;.  Some people are, some aren&#39;t, and it&#39;s usually the organized people that are doing the bitching.  Sometimes the organized people can even make the rest of us feel guilty about our un-organization, and make us feel inept and defic<br/>
 ient if we are unable to &#39;pull ourselves up&#39; to their level.  If organized people want to go around organizing things, fine, but just leave the rest of us alone.  :)<br/>
<br/>
~~And I&#39;ve noticed that when I&#39;m searching for something I don&#39;t appreciate<br/>
someone telling me that I should have put them where they belonged!~~<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...that sounds like a payback to me, lol.  I doubt anyone appreciates having their own &#39;lectures&#39; handed back to them.  But it is a great way to find out how the lecture really &#39;feels&#39; to others.  (I speak from experience, I used to be King of the Cleaning Lectures.)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone should be able to decide what is &#39;clean enough&#39; for themselves.  If someone doesn&#39;t like the way I did something, then they can re-do it to their heart&#39;s content!  If it wasn&#39;t good enough, then fix it yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Kids have way too much going on to worry about soemthing as mundane as cleaning.  A person is only a kid for a short time, let them enjoy it, because they will have the rest of their lives to feel the &#39;burden&#39; of things like cleaning, just like we all do now.  <br/>

<br/>
Why can&#39;t he have a &#39;mess&#39; in his room or in designated areas in the <br/>
house? I just feel that if this were asked of me all the time I would <br/>
go nuts. I write and develop websites and have little piles of papers <br/>
around my desk with wireframes or outlines. If I were asked to move my <br/>
stuff all the time to make someone happy, it would drive me berserk. I <br/>
sometimes leave the stuff out on the table to &#39;put it down&#39; not because <br/>
I am done with the task but because I need to be away from it to think. <br/>
I&#39;ve seen my kids play the same way (the oldest is 6.5 and the youngest <br/>
3.5). What looks like disinterest is a rest moment. These days, they&#39;ve <br/>
taken to lining up their &#39;action figures&#39; (&quot;mommy, they are not dolls, <br/>
their action figures&quot;) in &quot;scenes&quot;. Sometimes the AFs are looking at <br/>
the TV or they are looking out the window, towards the Empire State <br/>
building. I&#39;d be toast if I confused that with a &#39;mess&#39;. So at the end <br/>
of the day nowadays, we either pile on to a side of the living room so <br/>
that they put it away in the morning or I ask them to put in heir room. <br/>
I&#39;ve stopped asking they keep their room mess free. They&#39;re learning by <br/>
&#39;losing&#39; their toys in the apartment that it&#39;s better to put their <br/>
stuff in a place where they can find it. And before I clean, I ask to <br/>
move the toys. Never know if Bulbasur or Batman are doing something the <br/>
kids only know about.<br/>

I had to laugh..I JUST went through this with my daughter Sarah.

<br/>
<br/>
I suggested to Sarah that she put hers in her underwear drawer (we&#39;d previously discussed how we&#39;re not going to have a sock basket anymore) and she said &quot;Why?&quot; I said &quot;Most people put their socks in the same drawer as their underwear.&quot; Then I realized that was not quite true. I said &quot;No, most people might not. It&#39;s more like I suggest it because that&#39;s where my mother insisted I keep MY socks when I was a kid. I have a separate drawer now for my socks. So, as long as they&#39;re in your dresser, just put them where you want them.&quot; She went off, and as far as I know that&#39;s where she put them...somewhere in her dresser. She might not have, but I&#39;ll try to not worry about it. <br/>

try to keep it nice and sweet and more of a request than a demand.<br/>

favor he could do to really help me out and he doesn&#39;t mind. He doesn&#39;t<br/>
get money weekly at all, just when I feel he has really earned it!**<br/>
<br/>
Um - I&#39;ve been trying to think of a nice gentle way to say this but I haven&#39;t <br/>
been able to manage it. Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a horrible idea. How can the child hope to get a clear idea <br/>
of what performance will earn him money and what won&#39;t under these <br/>
circumstances? If you&#39;re going to pay a child for chores, it&#39;s only fair to let them know, <br/>
concretely, what they need to do to earn the money. &quot;Just when I feel he has <br/>
really earned it&quot; doesn&#39;t give the child a clear connection between his &quot;work&quot; <br/>
and his income - it gives him the knowledge that mom will give him money when <br/>
she feels like it, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m   not against paying children for working around the house. I&#39;ve always <br/>
paid my kids for hard stuff. Lawn mowing, leaf raking, snow shoveling, <br/>
scrubbing floors... They always know the minimum they&#39;ll earn before they start. I AM <br/>
against work being a child&#39;s only access to the family income, but that&#39;s <br/>
another topic. <br/>
<br/>
I really, REALLY wouldn&#39;t want to model for my children that income could be <br/>
legitimately tied to the unpredictable whim of an employer in the &quot;REAL&quot; <br/>
world. <br/>

Cuisenaire Rods<br/>
<br/>
Cuisenaire rods are a collection of rectangular rods in 10 lengths and 10 <br/>
colors, each color corresponding to a different length. Learners can explore <br/>
whole numbers, fractions, measurement, ratio, area, perimeter, symmetry, <br/>
congruence, three-dimensional geometry, patterns, and functions. They allow a concrete <br/>
way of looking a math, and are available in both wood and plastic. We <br/>
recommend the supplemental set because, though 155 sounds like a big number, it really <br/>
isn’t. Having that amount is most useful.<br/>
#0999 Introductory Set of 74 Plastic Rods<br/>
  $  9.65 <br/>
#0980 Introductory Set of 74 Wood Rods<br/>
  $11.25 <br/>
<br/>
=======<br/>
<br/>
We have a set of wooden ones (ten of each size) that a friend who had trained <br/>
to teach early elementary (and lasted a few years &lt;g&gt;) have us because from <br/>
her training she could not IMAGINE that our children could possibly learn math <br/>
without  those.  And when she gave them to us she gave us a set of 26  <br/>
laminated sheets with which they could make the letters of the alphabet by putting <br/>
the right-sized rod over a space that matched it.   LAME!  That didn&#39;t  seem to <br/>
help with math OR writing.   The letter R has nothing to do with straight <br/>
sticks, but there it was, drawn in precisely measured and <br/>
seemingly-randomly-colored sticks.<br/>
<br/>
That complaint registered, I like the wooden ones.   I like them for the same <br/>
reason I like any stained hardwood game markers or &quot;manipulatives.&quot;   <br/>
Aesthetic value.  They feel good, they look good, they sound cool when you drop them <br/>
on the table.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722511132">&lt;&lt; Why are they cuisinaire?<br/>
Were they meant once for cooking? &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
***Isn&#39;t cooking stuff &quot;cuisinart&quot;?***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading backwards here so maybe this was answered.  I think they were<br/>
named for their inventor, George Cuisinaire.  But dogs do like to eat<br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re a centimeter wide and tall and from one to ten(?) centimeters in<br/>
length.  They&#39;re different colors, very pretty.  We build walls out of<br/>
them and launch little pink pigs from the catapult to knock the walls<br/>
down. <br/>
I&#39;ve never put one in the Cuisinart though. <br/>

&quot;Most people put their socks in the same drawer as their underwear.&quot; Then I realized that was not quite true. I said &quot;No, most people might not. It&#39;s more like I suggest it because that&#39;s where my mother insisted I keep MY socks when I was a kid. I have a separate drawer now for my socks. So, as long as they&#39;re in your dresser, just put them where you want them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t even go that far.  Our laundry area is in our basement, so we built a bunch of shelves/bins and hanging rods right next to the washer and dryer, so now we fold/hang the clothes right there and they are PUT AWAY!  That&#39;s as far as they go.  I know it sounds a little weird, but we completely avoid the &#39;put away your clothes&#39; issues.  Everyone always knows where their clothes are, there is never a question of what goes where...it&#39;s all just right there!  When someone changes clothes, the dirty clothes simply get tossed to the bottom of the basement steps, and whomever goes down to the basement just puts/kicks them into the laundry room.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s simple, effecient, and it works for us.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s in our dressers and closets?  Everything EXCEPT clothes!  lol.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If one person says,&quot;That&#39;s where it goes&quot;, another might ask, &quot;Why?&quot;, and <br/>
&gt;the response to the why? should be a careful one.  Just because I like to <br/>
&gt;keep the scissors in the junk drawer in the kitchen doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s <br/>
&gt;where they should go.  Someone else may use them in an entirely different <br/>
&gt;part of the house more often than I use them, so maybe their placement of <br/>
&gt;the scissors makes more sense than mine.  At least to them it does.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why I always look at mess/ clutter as an opportunity to rethink and <br/>
reorganize. I enjoy organizing--gives me a profound sense of <br/>
accomplishment! Even if Pam S. did tell me I was a different species! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I look at clutter or mess as an opportunity, it allows me to think <br/>
about how our system is working for the whole family, whether our needs <br/>
have changed, which they do constantly with three small children. I want <br/>
our home to work for  everyone in the family; I want everyone to love being <br/>
home. Reorganizing keeps me that much more in touch with how things are <br/>
working for everyone, and my binges are almost always preceded by a <br/>
discussion with the kids or dh how things might work better or at least why <br/>
they&#39;re not working. We call it &quot;futzing,&quot; as in &quot;Mama&#39;s futzing again.&quot; &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I think of giving my children &quot;responsibility,&quot; it&#39;s more like <br/>
&quot;control.&quot; I am a big fan of lots of clear plastic bins and lots of low <br/>
shelves, of which I never have enough. This lets the kids see what they <br/>
want and get at it; also makes things easier to put away.<br/>
I have everything within their reach and perspective, which allows them to <br/>
take control over the things they want. All the toys they play with on a <br/>
regular basis are within their reach, as is the tv, vcr tapes, their <br/>
computer and games, their snacks and food.  The only limitation is low <br/>
shelving space! &lt;LOL&gt; I try to put really obvious stuff high up, so they <br/>
can clearly see it and ask for it when they want it. Not so much <br/>
&quot;responsibility&quot; as control over their world, which I think is tremendously <br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning has always worked best as a group effort in our house. When we all <br/>
do it happily, the kids almost always pitch in happily. When we try to get <br/>
them to do it themselves, it often turns into a battle. Dh has been slow to <br/>
get this, as he still gets caught up in the traditional &quot;responsibility&quot; <br/>
mode (we&#39;re working on this, and he&#39;s trying hard, but sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
knee-jerk). When I want things picked up, it&#39;s usually because I want to <br/>
run a vacuum. I just tell them that I&#39;d like to vacuum and could they <br/>
please help me pick things up off the floor. This is usually plenty of <br/>
motivation--small things have gone the way of the vacuum in the past. The <br/>
family room we do probably every other day, but the bedrooms only about <br/>
once a week. This seems to work for them.<br/>
<br/>
Helping is voluntary and still fun for them, and I hope it always stays <br/>
this way. Sam (3.5) helped his dad bring wood around for the wood stove <br/>
yesterday. Emily (6) picked up a couple of hand fulls of kindling because <br/>
she wanted to be helpful, and yesterday, she helped her brother make his <br/>
bed. Julia (5) loves to be helpful and take care of other people--she&#39;s the <br/>
first one to run and get ice or a special blanket if someone gets hurt or <br/>
sad. I have really nice kids, and I like them. It always amazes me the <br/>
number of people who can&#39;t say that.<br/>

Hmmmm..... May have to mull that one over a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
In our small house, our laundry room is a really big room. We have all our <br/>
arts/ crafts, overflow pantry and extra fridge in there so it can do <br/>
multiple duty. We&#39;ve turned the kids&#39; closets into play areas, and dresser <br/>
space is at a premium. I&#39;m liking your idea!<br/>
<br/>
How do you deal with the whole changing/ gender issue? I never quite know <br/>
at what age that&#39;s supposed to become an issue. Dh and I have very few <br/>
inhibitions, but lots of folks do. Our kids are still pretty young and <br/>
bathe together, so it won&#39;t be an issue here for a while!<br/>

money.  It all stays in the checking account.  The boys are aware of the bills <br/>
that need to be paid.  They help decide what vacations we want to take and how <br/>
much we need to set aside each month to get there.  They know what household <br/>
projects need to be done and what money we need to set aside for that etc. <br/>
They are aware of how much &quot;spending money&quot; is left over after everything is <br/>
paid.  When they want or need something we look to see if we have the money and if <br/>
we do they get it, sometimes they decide to wait and see if there is <br/>
something else they want more but it is their choice.<br/>
<br/>
Like I do things.  I don&#39;t work at a job that pays me money and I don&#39;t have <br/>
an allowance or money given to me specifically for me.  But if I want <br/>
something I look to see if we have the money and then I get it.  Same with Jackson <br/>
although his job does pay him money.  LOL.  It all goes into the checking <br/>
account.  When we go out I will ask the boys if there is anything they need while we <br/>
are out or anywhere they want to stop.  When we go grocery shopping they put <br/>
what they want and need in the cart.  It is a family effort, managing money.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just a couple of thoughts <br/>
