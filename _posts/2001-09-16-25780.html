<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114233343">I&#39;m struggling right now with fine-tuning my philosophy of <br/>
education.  It would be tremendously helpful if anyone is willing to <br/>
share why they believe unschooling is the best way to go.  Why not <br/>
the Charlotte Mason approach?  Or the Moore Formula?  Why do you <br/>
believe what you believe?  <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
