&gt;What I do find uncomfrotable, and have just realized, is the underlying<br/>
&gt;tone of things being right and wrong. Of terms being picked apart and<br/>
&gt;corrected. Of having to choose words too carefully. Reminders of what<br/>
&gt;subjects should be and what should not be. Of when to move on or not. <br/>
&gt;I haven&#39;t seen anyone curse or call someone names. I haven&#39;t seen anyone<br/>
&gt;ramble on about their health or the weather. I haven&#39;t seen anyone post<br/>
&gt;for days about something that has been long forgotten.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, but it is not limited to this list.  It is mainly the problem with<br/>
this form of communication, I believe.  You MUST choose your words<br/>
carefully in order to effectively communicate with a group of strangers in<br/>
this medium, as there is no body language, foreknowledge of the speakers&#39;<br/>
beliefs or personalities, facial expressions or voice tone (all the things<br/>
mentioned before) to put their words in context.  In effective novels,<br/>
conversation is always accompanied by inner thought or body language of the<br/>
characters, something we do not have the benefit of here.  I have found the<br/>
same problem on other lists where the topic is important and emotionally<br/>
charged, such as this one.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Maybe we should make like novels and include our thoughts and body<br/>
language, etc...&#39;  she thought with a wry smirk.  &#39;Maybe then we could all<br/>
get along and focus more on Unschooling and less on finger pointing, or<br/>
whatever.  Actually, with all the creative minds around here,&#39; she mused,<br/>
her eyes gleaming with a delighted  smile of anticipation &#39;this could lead<br/>
to some really fun ways to avoid future confusion.&#39;  She rubbed her hands<br/>
together expectantly.<br/>

&gt;Nanci K. in Idaho, I don&#39;t know If I could do it  I thought to myself, but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it surely would be amusing and fun to read! also wondering to myself, if<br/>
anyone on the list expecially those with more experience, has anyone come up<br/>
with a great letter or something along those lines explaining what<br/>
unschooling is to family members who are overly concerned that we are not<br/>
insuring that our children are learning what they should know? My father<br/>
asked me the other week  how Morgan (12yo) was doing, and expressed his<br/>
concerns, he said &quot;I understand the interest lead learning (big surprise to<br/>
me!) but what if she is not interested in the right stuff??&quot; I stated that<br/>
many people have gone this way an been very successful and are doing fine!<br/>
he said that he had moved several times as a child, and missed out on the<br/>
basics of english, and to this day could not tell me what they were,  what I<br/>
said in return was &quot; well dad, I went thru the public school system, and was<br/>
forced to learn all of that and still to this day coudn&#39;t tell you the<br/>
difference between a noun a pronoun an adverb ect..&quot; I can somewhat , but<br/>
that would have blured my point! they don&#39;t know we are planning to unschool<br/>
the other two in the fall, (well started the day they were released from<br/>
thos walls!) and I dread the thought of telling them, they are just sure she<br/>
won&#39;t be able to hold a job either , because she won&#39;t be discaplined into a<br/>
structured environment! how did all of you who have been doing this for<br/>
years explain this and do they ever get it? I understand they are just<br/>
concerned, and this is all new to everyone, but I would like to help them to<br/>
understand better without forcing it down their throats or being nasty about<br/>
it, and the funny thing is, my dad didn&#39;t go to collage, and had a job in<br/>
electronics at Up John, he tore apart microscopes and Maspectromiters which<br/>
at that point there were few people who knew how to do that and he was one<br/>
of them! he did take corispondence courses  in electronics while managing<br/>
mcdonalds and caring for us!<br/>
confused and wanting them to understand and feel compfortable with this<br/>
whole thing so that they don&#39;t end up quizing my kids!<br/>

Ask him what &quot;the right stuff&quot; would be.<br/>
Most people assume there is one body of material which all schools teach, and <br/>
that&#39;s not so.  As to literature and details of science and such, it varies <br/>
greatly.  The right stuff might be more likely seen as what gives her <br/>
substantial opportunities to think, be analytical, to connect history to <br/>
science and music to math and all that.  Maybe a conversation about the best <br/>
stuff he ever learned (and how and where) would be enlightening for your dad.<br/>

details of unschooling, just the notion of not sending your child to school) <br/>
and why I was planning on it when I had kids.  Her reply was, &quot;I think kids <br/>

something about socialization or quality of education or jobs or college), <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Similar comments.  &quot;How will they learn to sit at a desk all day?&quot; comes to <br/>
mind (spoken by my mother in law, who worries they won&#39;t be able to get a <br/>
job.)<br/>
<br/>
I reply, usually to those types of comments, that I don&#39;t want my children to <br/>
&quot;learn to be bored&quot;.  I want my children to learn how to get rid of boredom <br/>
so that they are always engaged in something that is helping them grow into <br/>
productive adults.  People who love their jobs, rarely get bored with them.  <br/>
If my children can figure out what they LOVE to do, and make a living at it - <br/>
then there is no need to be bored in school or out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112374025">Yes, my sister also thinks somewhat the same.  She feels that her children<br/>
will not be prepared for &quot;the real world&quot; if they have not suffered thru the<br/>
same things everyone else does.  She thinks they will not be able to handle<br/>
life without exposing them to all things, including violent TV and video<br/>
games (my 8 yr old nephew has been playing for about a yr the video game<br/>
those kids from Columbine shootings were playing, can&#39;t remember the name).<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t go out of her way to expose them, but she doesn&#39;t monitor much<br/>
at all.  She also tends to tell her children, in their times of crisis, to<br/>
get over it, that&#39;s life...or get used to it, that&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to give my children an attitude that they can work to change things<br/>
they don&#39;t like....a sense of creativity in approaching problems or things<br/>
that don&#39;t work, toward fixing them.  I prefer to keep violence away from my<br/>
family, including nightly news programs (my kids are still young, 6 & 2).  I<br/>
prefer exposing my kids to many different cultures and let them learn about<br/>
life by living it, not suffering thru it.<br/>

<br/>
this sounds like a person who is very unhappy with their present career/job. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have never, ever heard that comment before.  Maybe a good comeback would be <br/>
that you disagree because you want your kids to know they don&#39;t have to live <br/>
boring lifes, jump through hoops to satisfy someone else.  You want htem to <br/>
be happy in no matter what they do and thats the goal?<br/>
