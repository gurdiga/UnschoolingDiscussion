<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030893729">We have been unschooling for just three months.  Since we, both my <br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s only 10 and you&#39;ve only been deschooling for 3 months. The rule of<br/>
thumb is one month per year they&#39;ve been in school. But it depends on the<br/>
child&#39;s personality and their experience in school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pefectly natural to worry but relax! :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably because you&#39;re trying to get him interested :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you were involved in a really good book that you couldn&#39;t put down and<br/>
your husband kept popping in every 15 minutes suggesting you do something<br/>
different like watch TV or sew or do some painting, how would it feel?<br/>
<br/>
When you came up for air from your book, wouldn&#39;t you love to have someone<br/>
to talk to about it?<br/>
<br/>
How about playing the games with him? :-) Talk to him about them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to tell a story related to this. Dh and I both got shoved through the cattle shoot of &quot; high school then you must go to college and keep up with the Jonses&quot;  Dh and I both dropped out of college the first year. Dh plays video games constantly!!!! He has for years. With the exception of Final fantasy I just dont care for them and dont really understand his passion for them. <br/>
Anyway one day during a 7 month lay off we had 2 years ago I got really frustrated with dh&#39;s seemingly constant game playing and said something like if you like games so much why dont you make a career out of it. <br/>
 <br/>
So here it is 2 years later and he just got a promotion that gave him a 50% raise...we are nowhere near rich but its kinda nice to no longer qualify for food stamps . He is also in school <br/>
for programming and has ideas for designs of new video games. <br/>
 <br/>
I cant help but wonder though.........this game intrest has been going on since he was young. I cant help but wonder if he had been allowed to pursue his intrests at a much younger age instead of being shoved into courses because &quot; it was good for him&quot; Maybe he would have already gotten on the road he is on now. <br/>

Unschooling for just three months should be deschooling time:<br/>

True.  You can&#39;t get him interested in anything.  Don&#39;t  try.<br/>
Get yourself interested in some things and maybe he&#39;ll join in, but have  <br/>
your own interests.  Rent movies just for you.  Buy a book or magazine  just for <br/>
you.  Maybe share the best part, the part you think he might be  interested <br/>
in.  He might get interested, or not.  <br/>

<br/>
Spend some time feeling your feelings.  Unschooling is unlike  school in <br/>
lolst of ways, and one way that people forget about is that school  will no longer <br/>
tell you when&#39;s a good time to get up or sleep, to do homework or  not, to <br/>
study Japan or do a science project or not.  Different reasons will  come into <br/>
play.  <br/>
 <br/>
You said it doesn&#39;t bother you, but your whole post seems to say it DOES  <br/>
bother you.<br/>
Feel your feelings as honestly as you can.  What bothers you bothers  you for <br/>
some personal reason.  Think about why that is.  Spend  extra time now that <br/>
you&#39;re moving toward a whole new way of being on reviewing  your own childhood <br/>
memories and experiences and emotions.  The better you  really know your own <br/>
self, the more relaxed you can be with little internal  fears come up.  Don&#39;t <br/>
let them surprise you.  Know them now, and try  to dissolve them.<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s a short essay called &quot;Tiny Monsters,&quot; and finding your own tiny  <br/>
monsters might help you get to peaceful unschooling more quickly:<br/>

Order a copy of Video Game Revolution.  It&#39;s a DVD of a special that  was on <br/>
PBS about video games.  It will change your life.  <br/>

Sure, but then you peddle faster, not slower.  Stop peddling and the  bike <br/>
can fall over.  Hesitation doesn&#39;t get you farther faster, confidence  does.  <br/>
And your confidence in unschooling will come from seeing it work, so  don&#39;t <br/>
sabotage your progress.   Deschooling for a ten year old  shouldn&#39;t be looked at <br/>
before five or six months have passed, and five or six  months of real <br/>
expectation that unschooling can work. If you take a break and  &quot;teach,&quot; start your <br/>
deschooling period again.  <br/>
 <br/>
When the kids got X-Box Live and started playing Halo2 online in December,  <br/>
they played every day, and others came over every day and played.  <br/>
 <br/>
Two months later, Marty was trying to talk some of them into playing Halo2,  <br/>
saying it had been a while since they played, but they wanted to play a  <br/>
role-playing game with books and paper instead.  I&#39;m not saying one&#39;s  better.  I&#39;m <br/>
saying both happen if you don&#39;t limit or shame or glorify one  over the other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629445561">My husband&#39;s career was made out of tinkering with computers, playing <br/>
games, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He always was interested in programming computers, playing games, etc; <br/>
and was lucky enough to have access to some relatively early <br/>
home-machines as a kid (we&#39;re in our early 30s).<br/>
<br/>
He fell in love with the internet in the early 1990s, playing online <br/>
games (MUSHes, MOOs), talking on IRC, making goofy personal webpages <br/>
when the World Wide Web first appeared.  Meanwhile, he was (barely) <br/>
making a living stuffing envelopes in the shipping department of a <br/>
virtual instrumentation firm.  He got up the guts one day to go talk to <br/>
the (newly-forming) &quot;web development team&quot; there, who finally agreed to <br/>
take him on in some low-level capacity (with lots of snarky comments on <br/>
the side about his lack of training, lack of a college degree, long <br/>
hair, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
He now makes a quite comfortable living as the director of a software <br/>
development team.    There have been a couple of times where we <br/>
regretted his lack of a college degree, but not because he lacks any <br/>
needed skills, only because it would get him sorted out of competition <br/>
before anyone had even seen his work, now that the technology industry <br/>
has changed.<br/>
<br/>
I got off-message there, but my point is this: his interest in <br/>
programming, his massive amounts of time spent &#39;playing games&#39; is <br/>
precisely what has allowed him to function in &#39;reality&#39;.  He still <br/>
plays a lot of games.<br/>

<br/>
So true. Its actually funny at times. Brianna asked me the other night as I was working on my &quot;homework&quot; (graduate school) if I could show her what I was doing. It was on bond pricing. Lots of math. My first instinct was to say - well its a bit hard - but luckily I didn&#39;t ;-) and explained the very basic idea and she smiled, looked a little bored, asked a few questions about why I liked the class, what I am learning etc. Told me that she liked to do her &quot;math&quot; as cooking. We talked a bit about that, and how measuring and fractions were important when cooking, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Now if I ever set out to &quot;show&quot; fractions and measuring as part of a curriculum - she may never have the interest enough to make these connections. <br/>
<br/>
It really sometimes is that basic things of life that spark great conversations. <br/>
<br/>
Sewing is another great example. I set out to learn how to sew...bought a sewing machine, got a simple pattern for a skirt and got started. As I was all spread out on the floor trying to figure it all out, I was having a bit of trouble understanding the pattern(yes, why is it that one can be an ace at bond pricing - and be clueless when it comes to patterns ;-) In any case it seems Brianna has a knack for figuring these out...&quot;Look mom, you only don&#39;t have to fold it when it has a nap...&quot; She referred to an old sewing book borrowed from my mother - looked up the definition of nap - said &quot;Oh like velvet. Well, you don&#39;t have that so you fold yours and put the pattern pieces on like this picture&quot;. Needless to say she was right, and has since made herself a pillowcase and a bookbag. (My skirt is still unfinished....but I&#39;ll get there!) <br/>
