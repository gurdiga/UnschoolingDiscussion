<div id="ygrps-yiv-659331689">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in a season of lots of little hugs and lots and lots of helping <br/>
and cleaning (10 yo, 5 yo, 4 yo, 2 1/2 yo and 1 yo!)and so don&#39;t have <br/>
very much time to participate on list.  Just resubbed and want to <br/>
thank members here...I so appreciate this community...wow, I come <br/>
here to laugh more often than not, as well as gain sage advice.<br/>
<br/>
Am wondering if there are plans for a valentine card swap amongst the <br/>
children of your families this year?  Hope everyone has a wonderful <br/>
week,<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
