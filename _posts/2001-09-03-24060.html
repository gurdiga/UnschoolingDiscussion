<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047239537">.  Do I trust that my child DOES know his own life- can discover who he is-<br/>
does not need to be forced into something someone else wants, and IS good<br/>
and beautiful-without me?  I DO!  I CAN!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I loved this<br/>
we have 3 children 6,8,10<br/>
and they have 4 wheel ATVs<br/>
this weekend we went on a long four our trip<br/>
I took turns riding behind each of our children and totally giving them the<br/>
control to<br/>
drive... head off a cliff, go slow and cautious, race to catch up with dad,<br/>
stop and look at the mountains,<br/>
they were amazing I know they learned only from watching and trial and error<br/>
each has their own style<br/>
and if they learn 90% of their information they&#39;re all the better for it<br/>
thanks to you Bronwen<br/>
