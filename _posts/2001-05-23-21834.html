Tell your friend that I enjoyed her writing style, but believe that she took<br/>
the Dinsmore stuff a little too far and seriously.  I rate myself as one of<br/>
those &quot;fundamentalists&quot; but don&#39;t see it as quite the curse some folks<br/>
think.  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Like much literature out there, there is both good and bad to it.  No piece<br/>
of literature (aside from the Bible, which will bring a bring growl from<br/>
some of the crowd here) is ever held up as a &quot;perfect example&quot; by<br/>
Christians.  Even the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia,&quot; another series enjoyed by many<br/>
Christians, has its drawbacks and gray areas.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact I was looking at a catalog I received in the mail today<br/>
that had a new study guide for the Dinsmore series (there&#39;s 28 volumes in<br/>
the series available in paperback or hardback). As with all the other study<br/>
guides that I&#39;ve seen and/or used, I&#39;m sure there are questions that require<br/>
the child to compare/contrast today&#39;s understandings with the idealized<br/>
presentation of the mid 1800&#39;s.  In fact, if the lessons on the Dinsmore<br/>
series are anything at all like most &quot;Christian&quot; curriculum, there will be<br/>
lots of questions about right vs. wrong, personal accountability for<br/>
behaviors, was what was viewed as &quot;right&quot; then really right?, lots of open<br/>
ended questions requiring the child to think about their own understanding<br/>
and opinions, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the affection that your friend refers to is prevelant in some families<br/>
and not in others.  Its not necessarily a bad thing.  I still kiss my dad<br/>
(gasp ... on the lips) and give him hugs and pets ... I love him.  I also<br/>
kissed my grandfathers, uncles, and male cousins.  Nothing incestuous is<br/>
meant by it ... just call us a bunch of touchy-feely, southern hillbillies.<br/>
I kiss my female relatives too.  Some families are just more inclined<br/>
towards physical affection ... the healthy kind ... than others.  And<br/>
referring to Elsie sitting on her dad&#39;s lap ... I still cuddle with my dad<br/>
on occassion ... but we both have put on a lot more weight than when I was a<br/>
teenager and its not quite as easy to do with our diminshed laps LOL!  My<br/>
dad had his first heart attack when he was 48 years old (high stress job and<br/>
was a smoker) and still isn&#39;t in the greatest of shape 11 years later ... I<br/>
never want to look back and think about a possible lack of affection between<br/>
us because we held back just because someone had an icky imagination.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just my two cents from the other side of the fence &lt;grin&gt;.  Debate<br/>
can be a healthy thing, I just regret when labels get used that aren&#39;t<br/>
strictly true and might turn someone away from exploring a possible<br/>
interest.  But hey ... none of us are alike and she&#39;s entitled to her<br/>
opinion, just sorry that she sees so much negativity and was probably hurt<br/>
by a &quot;fundamentalist&quot; at some point to cause such a viewpoint.  Everyone,<br/>
regardless of their religious affiliation, can step on people&#39;s toes ...<br/>
wish they would hold the person accountable and not the religion, group, or<br/>
movement.<br/>
