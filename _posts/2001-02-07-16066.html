<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263418379">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
My six year old son is having a blast drawing his own comics.  Sometimes<br/>
he asks me to write words for it but mostly he just makes the sequencial<br/>
pictures and tells me the story.  He was complaining about wanting to<br/>
make a book and  not being able to write. I said I&#39;d write the words for<br/>
him.  I also mentioned the book, &quot;A boy, a dog and a frog&quot;, which is<br/>
only pictures.  His latest theme is environmental.  He told a story of a<br/>
guy who chops down a tree and then feels bad about it and starts<br/>
replanting trees.  I think he got the theme from a book by Lynne<br/>
Cherry.  If you are looking for books with environmental themes, check<br/>
hers out.  She has both fiction and non-fiction.  Some of the titles are<br/>
&quot;The Kapok Tree&quot;,  &quot;The Dragon and the Unicorn&quot;  They are picture books<br/>
with about a paragraph of text every other page and are beautifully<br/>
illustrated.  They are also well racially integrated.<br/>
<br/>
The only &quot;problem&quot; I have with him being so excited about doing the<br/>
comics is I can&#39;t get him to &quot;stop&quot; to pick up his toys.<br/>
We have a &quot;rule&quot;, that is you don&#39;t put it away you don&#39;t have it for a<br/>
while, we had to do that with some stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to have a son who hasn&#39;t lost his passion for learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123481795">my ds (6 in may) loves drawing comics too. His &quot;2nd<br/>
daddy&quot; (my boyfriend) is a cartoonist/artist person<br/>
(plug:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rocktoons.com">http://rocktoons.com</a>  <br/>
and (my fave)- (www.pbgalaxy.keenspace.com) <br/>
and works on his comics here on the computer while ds<br/>
likes to sit on his desk (which is right next to this<br/>
one) and draw his own. Ty (boyfriend) has the<br/>
templates all printed up already with the four squares<br/>
for each frame all in a row, so Tori (ds) can just<br/>
draw in each one and he actually hasn&#39;t ever wanted me<br/>
to do the words. hm. I hadn&#39;t thought of that before.<br/>
He just tells me what they&#39;re doing and then moves on.<br/>
He loves superheroes and my sis bought him a book on<br/>
how to draw superheroes (x-men, spiderman, superman,<br/>
etc) in comicbook fashion. It&#39;s a bit advanced for him<br/>
but he loves it and it has pages to trace some of the<br/>
heroes. It&#39;s helping him to think in terms other than<br/>
stick figures, though I really do LOVE his stick<br/>
figures. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97200418">oh yes and I was also going to say that<br/>
www.keenspace.com has alot of online comics that your<br/>
ds might like to look at if you&#39;re interested. Alot of<br/>
them are very much NOT for children though, so I would<br/>
check it out by yourself before letting your ds look<br/>
at the ones that you deem okay for him. There is quite<br/>
a variety. <br/>
<br/>
oh, and I think I posted the pbgalaxy link wrong. <br/>
hope not.<br/>
it&#39;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rocktoons.com/pbgalaxy">http://rocktoons.com/pbgalaxy</a><br/>
or www.pbgalaxy.keenspace.com<br/>
(choose the rocktoons one) &lt;g&gt;<br/>

up comics)<br/>
