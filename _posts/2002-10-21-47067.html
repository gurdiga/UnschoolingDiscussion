&gt; Spot.  He was some kind of Spaniel I think, black and white but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have a picture and I can&#39;t remember what he was.  My son has been asking<br/>
&gt; since I told him about those old Dick and Jane books.   He would need to<br/>
&gt; know the breed of their dog. <br/>
&gt; Come Kelly.  Come and see.  Come, come.  Come and see.  Come and see<br/>
&gt; Spot. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Forty-two. I read a little Dick and Jane. Some Spot. But in first, second, <br/>
and third grades, we were reading all about Tag (and their cat, Puff). <br/>
<br/>
See Tag. See Tag run. Run, Tag, run. Run, run, run!<br/>
<br/>
Who were the children in that? I remember the animals just fine! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Spot was a cocker spaniel. He doesn&#39;t look much like what we see in the show <br/>
ring right now---he&#39;s lacking coat. But back then in the early &#39;60&#39;s, the <br/>
cocker&#39;s furnishing were lighter, and he looks just like the &quot;old-style&quot; <br/>
cockers.<br/>
<br/>
Spot&#39;s a parti-colored cocker spaniel.<br/>
<br/>
Tag was a black cocker.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be of assistance! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
