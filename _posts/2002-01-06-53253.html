<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203178995">Well I&#39;m four days behind on mail and haven&#39;t a clue as to what has been<br/>
discussed. I&#39;ve been writting on another unschool list explaining<br/>
unschooling to people that have been there for years. They are mostly<br/>
eclectic homeschoolers. I love that list but... I&#39;ll cut to the chase. It&#39;s<br/>
exhausting!    Thank you so much Sandra, Ren, Joyce, Deb, Robin, Helen, Pam,<br/>
Karin, Tia, Marji, Kelly, and so many others for your time and writings<br/>
about unschooling through life!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
May you all have a very happy new year!<br/>
<br/>
Write on :-)<br/>

I don&#39;t know about others here, but I have been brought up to doubt myself. <br/>
Neither of my parents have ever helped me to find ways to feel more <br/>
comfortable with my decisions, they usually tell me that I don&#39;t make good <br/>
decisions (Meaning I don&#39;t make the ones THEY would make) My mother has come <br/>
along way since I came home to be with my kids and live this wonderful <br/>
trusting lifestyle. She is far less critical and degrading. My Father can <br/>
never change, our relationship is over.<br/>
Sad.<br/>

Hi -<br/>
<br/>
Not letting someone degrade you is a GOOD decision, in my not so humble<br/>
opinion. <br/>
<br/>
In general the whole old-fashioned, spirit-breaking form of child<br/>
raising DOES seem designed to take away the child&#39;s ability to think for<br/>
himself.  The doubts you feel could be an expression of that. <br/>

<br/>
Just in case there&#39;s anyone here who never knew this:<br/>
<br/>
Child-rearing and education books in the first half of the 20th century <br/>
talked explicitly, right in black and white, about breaking a child&#39;s will.<br/>
<br/>
They used that phrase:  You must break his will.<br/>

    I totally beleive that that is the way I was raised. I doubt myself less<br/>
and less as time goes on and I can see the proof in the pudding, &lt;BWWG&gt; My<br/>
Mom died before the kids where born. I let my Dad beleive that we were<br/>
fundimental christian homeschoolers. That was who they knew that hsed. I was<br/>
very thankful he and his retired second grade teacher lived in FL and I am<br/>
in Ohio. LOL! He&#39;s gone now but still in my heart I have some of those tapes<br/>
playing. eg; Shut the door! You don&#39;t live in a barn!/ Turn off those<br/>
lights! Money doesn&#39;t grow on trees! LOL!<br/>
