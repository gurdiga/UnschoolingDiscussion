<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340299817">So who has seen the movie yet? How many times (if at all) have you or <br/>
your kids read the books? Is everyone getting the official sheets/<br/>
toothpaste/action figures/toys/breakfast cereal for the holidays? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that so many kids ( and adults) all over the world who thought <br/>
they hated reading have found something they love. I enjoyed the books <br/>
and the movie. I also like tons of other books about adventure, and <br/>
sometimes magic. I like the Chronicles of Narnia, the Half Magic <br/>
series, the Borrowers series, The Castle in the Attic, so many more. <br/>
I&#39;m glad my 6y loves to read also. She is just getting into some of <br/>
these old favorites. <br/>
<br/>
I put off Potter though, not forbidden, just not suggested yet either. <br/>
She bought a copy now because I took her to the movie. I guess I <br/>
thought parts of it were not great for some young kids. I think most <br/>
kids are fine with the evil and violence, but my 4 & 6y kids are still <br/>
very real based. I mean that they worry that it&#39;s real somehow. I took <br/>
them because the movie looked like it would convey some of the magic in <br/>
the story. Maybe the basics of the story have been told by others many <br/>
times before, but the details are what bring it to life.<br/>
<br/>
What does this have to do with unschooling? Well I guess it&#39;s about <br/>
reading for fun, writing your own adventure stories, doing the math to <br/>
save up for a toy, discussing the psychology of how ads make people <br/>
really want things and make toys look better than in real life, and <br/>
even discussions about different religions and good and evil. Just life <br/>
stuff. Like all unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852192465">We&#39;ve read the books out loud.  The whole family got into the act!  <br/>
My dh can do great voices but he ad libs too.  At one point I told <br/>
him to stick to the book because I thought he was doing a <br/>
particularly ridiculous adlibbed pronunciation and then the girls <br/>
told me it was actually in the book that way! They read ahead, bad <br/>
girls!  But then they were kind and kept it to themselves so good <br/>
girls!<br/>
<br/>
We do not get into the merchandising thing.  Other than a big box of <br/>
buttons I bought to resell and the card games, I haven&#39;t bought any <br/>
of it. My girls figured out the ad thing when they were still in <br/>
school.  Wyndham is starting to catch on.<br/>
<br/>
As for other books:  We were talking about Lord of the Rings and the <br/>
Hobbit last night.  Rachel has read the Hobbit Jenni hasn&#39;t yet.  The <br/>
girls are big Dungeons and Dragons players.  When Jenni got the <br/>
Hobbitout last night Rachel said, &quot;It&#39;s just a big dungeon.&quot;  I <br/>
said, &quot;No, it&#39;s the ORIGINAL dungeon!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, has anyone tried reading Tolkein out loud?  Does it flow well <br/>
enoughto do it that way?  Is it particularly difficult?  I was <br/>
thinking about making it a family thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I&#39;ve probably read it out loud three times, once for each kid.  It <br/>
flows well and is fun to read.  I didn&#39;t find it hard.  But then, the only <br/>
book I ever gave up on reading aloud was Ivanhoe.  We counted over 100 <br/>
words in one sentence.  It&#39;s a hard go out loud.<br/>

family read.<br/>
They are wonderful aloud, but they go much too quickly!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802993606">But Kathy, you brought up my favorite addiction &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve read all the Harry Potters, only hubby and son #2 (he&#39;s busy getting<br/>
his MBA and looking at doing his last year at a university in Scotland)<br/>
haven&#39;t read them.  We, the still at home bunch, haven&#39;t gone to see the<br/>
movie.  We like to wait until the movies are out on video, pop up a bucket<br/>
of homemade popcorn (half the fun is in popping it yourself), haul out the<br/>
bean bags, plop in front of the big screen and do movie marathonds.  The two<br/>
eldest have gone with their families and loved it.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t buying too much HP stuff.  Kidlet #5 bought the journals and that<br/>
sort of thing because he liked the over with the owl and he likes to write.<br/>
<br/>
Youngest kidlet (9) read them but thought they were &quot;sorta boring.&quot;  She<br/>
just finished reading &quot;The Man Who Was Poe&quot; and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate<br/>
Factory.&quot;  She&#39;s now going through all the Goosebumps.  She loved the Box<br/>
Car Children and that bunch of historical diary books.  She does want a<br/>
robe, so we are going to make one.  She&#39;s learning to do embroidery and<br/>
wants to put a dragon on one side and Merlin on the other.<br/>
<br/>
We all love the Borrowers.  It is our favorite read aloud book.  That and<br/>
Little Women.  And we still reread Charlotte&#39;s Web.<br/>
<br/>
The older kidlets all read the Chronicles of Narnia.  Youngest hasn&#39;t yet.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to do the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings, etc. next as our read aloud<br/>
(we do round robins with everyone reading a chapter).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019993670">I haven&#39;t seen the movie. Yet. It&#39;s going to be dh and my first date without<br/>
children since moving here 2-1/2 years ago. (We even took ds to the hospital<br/>
when his sister was born.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read all the books once or twice, and dh has read the first one.<br/>
Actually, for a while there, I was addicted to them. OOps!  We haven&#39;t shared<br/>
any with the kids (4 and almost 2) yet.<br/>
<br/>
No product tie-ins here (although I did buy ds a Thomas the Tank Engine train<br/>
set for his birthday, and he has a few Pooh t-shirts).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777474115">We saw Harry Potter today -- me, 8yo ds, 4yo ds. I thought it was very good, <br/>
though it pales in comparison to the experience of discovering the story for <br/>
the first time in the book. We have read the whole series aloud twice, and <br/>
8yo is reading the first book -- slowly, slowly -- on his own.<br/>
<br/>
He craves more fantasy. At the moment we are in the 3rd book of the <br/>
Chronicles of Narnia series. I also loved the Edward Eager books, but I <br/>
thought I might give him one of them as a Christmas present for him to <br/>
discover on his own.<br/>
<br/>
I think he would love some science fiction that we could read aloud <br/>
together. Does anyone have any good ideas? It&#39;s been a long time since I <br/>
read any.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357256429">We have read all the books at my dd&#39;s request. She was<br/>
given #1 for Xmas last year and after reading it,<br/>
couldn&#39;t wait to read the rest. I was the one who<br/>
wasn&#39;t sure about the content (scariness level). Parts<br/>
of it scared her but she still wanted me to read it. I<br/>
figure she&#39;s been working something about her fears<br/>
out. At first when we heard about the movie, she<br/>
didn&#39;t want to go and see it (she wanted to wait for<br/>
it on video) because she thought the end part might be<br/>
too scary in visual format. She has now decided that<br/>
she can&#39;t wait for it on video and wants to see it in<br/>
the cinema, so were off to see it at the beginning of<br/>
December with friends.  She pretends to be Harry on a<br/>
daily basis (HP has provided a wealth of ideas for<br/>
imaginary play for her). The stuff that she&#39;s seen<br/>
that she wants is a Hogwarts Castle (Polly Pocket<br/>
size) and HP Band-Aids (don&#39;t ask me why, but<br/>
band-aids have always been an obsession with her!).<br/>
She&#39;s not shown any interest in any of the other stuff<br/>
though. Oh, but my mom got her HP sheets and she&#39;s<br/>
thrilled!<br/>
<br/>
Meghan<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So who has seen the movie yet? How many times (if at<br/>
all) have you or <br/>
your kids read the books? Is everyone getting the<br/>
official sheets/<br/>
toothpaste/action figures/toys/breakfast cereal for<br/>
the holidays? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Quinton who is 2 is like that. . . if he sees the bandaids he wants several <br/>
on his body, so thats what happens. He just LOVES them. Once Lelia (12) got a <br/>
cut and we were out somewhere, and had only one bandaid. Wow, was he upset!! <br/>
Soon as we got home, bandaids everywhere. LOL<br/>
