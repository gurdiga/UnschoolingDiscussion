<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056763382">When I was a kid, we all had specific chores we had to do - I had<br/>
laundry and kitchen (including dishes, etc) - and specific times by<br/>

activities because I had to go home a get my chores done.  That just led<br/>

If our chores weren&#39;t done, we couldn&#39;t go out with friends or eat<br/>
dinner, etc.  Pretty strict, and not at all helpful.  With my family, I<br/>
know that ds is only two, and can&#39;t exactly wash dishes, but I know of a<br/>
family who goes by the following rules, and we plan to do the same:  If<br/>

if___________(somebody the kid really admires and wants to impress) came<br/>
over right now?  Choose your favorite chore that needs to be done,<br/>
because if the house is trashed and I see you straightening and<br/>
vacuuming, then I&#39;ll wash the dishes, but if I see you watching tv, I&#39;ll<br/>
choose your chore for you.  With three older kids (hs, jhs, and 6<br/>
grade), this system works well for their family, and I hope it will work<br/>
out for ours.  The kids come home from school, see what needs to be<br/>
done, and then do it.  And mom works right along side her kids -<br/>
something my mother never did, but I wish she had.  She did all her work<br/>
while we were at school, and we never knew what she did.  She was always<br/>
watching tv when we got home from school, so we just thought she was<br/>
lazy.  &#39;Course, had we been at home, we would have known just how hard<br/>
she did work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811418083">Melanie, I had exactly the opposite experience, I wasn&#39;t expected to do<br/>
anything!  Unfortunately, that meant that when I left home I had no idea how<br/>
long things took, what needed doing, what I enjoyed doing...  except that I<br/>
have a mental block about washing-up, since my mum constantly told me (and<br/>
others while I was there) that I needn&#39;t do washing-up now, since I&#39;d have<br/>
enough to do when I got my own place.  So, I&#39;m reading your friends scheme<br/>
with interest.  It definitely looks like a good idea, although of course I&#39;d<br/>
rephrase it a little!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-281109646">hi melanie in japan, ( i have a sister living in tokyo!)<br/>
<br/>
thnx for the idea!  i am intrigued, i have presented getting things done in <br/>
that way a time or two and they just really dont feel worried enough that any <br/>
one would be unimpressed yet (which is good, i dont want them to feel judged <br/>
by that kind of thing--)  <br/>
<br/>
but i like the part about looking busy or getting assigned a chore... my kids <br/>
are great at staying busy so that mom forgets that they havent tended to <br/>
their responsibilities!  typical and to be expected, i did the same thing in <br/>
school when i didnt want to be called on!<br/>
<br/>
i did learn early on that we all need to work together, i mean-- at the same <br/>
time, that way everybody feels treated evenly and can be encouraged along... <br/>
(eg. we all get up and are doing the morning bedmaking/dressing/picking up <br/>
together)<br/>
<br/>
but there is no school to come home from to &lt;The kids come home from school, <br/>
see what needs to be<br/>
done, and then do it.&gt;!!  <br/>
<br/>
oh well,  i am certainly glad that i dont have kids gone away to school all <br/>
day bc then i would have more guilt that i should truly houseclean!!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087526572">Sorta makes sense, but if asked &quot;Hey who wants to do all these dishes?&quot; I <br/>
would get few takers :) My guys are a little older, (12,10 &7 yo), they do <br/>
like to help out here and there. Because it makes them feel good inside and <br/>
gets all the non-fun stuff out of the way so we can finish our paper mache&#39; <br/>
rain forest or our Egyptian wall or our various other projects. We are <br/>
pretty much in a constant state of disorganization due to our projects, so <br/>
we do the basics and nothing else :) We have an allowance thing, but more <br/>
like a family fun-fund that we donate to :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-861528863">We don&#39;t have actual &quot;chores&quot; in our household assigned to anyone (except all<br/>
the ones I have). I tell my dd&#39;s that there are some things that need to be done<br/>
in order to accomplish other things that day. I really want to go to the park<br/>
one day but the toys also need to be picked up prior to going, so usually my<br/>
dd&#39;s are pretty compliant as to helping me pick up all the toys so we can go. I<br/>
also advise them that we have to be at a certain time so if I&#39;m the only one<br/>
picking up the toys, we will have less time, because I plan to take my time<br/>
picking them up. There are also times, I may have to resort to bribery to get<br/>
some other stuff done. This is done simply though with nickels (and nothing is<br/>
more than 2 for any chore). But when I did start using the $ for trade, my dd&#39;s<br/>
started understanding the currency more - hey, they were learning! I have also<br/>
resorted to turning off the tv when needed. I think it really depends on the<br/>
ages of your kids too. Mine are 3 & 6.<br/>
<br/>
A funny story was the other day on the way out someplace, my oldest, did not<br/>
like the clothes I picked out for her to wear. I reminded her again that 1. she<br/>
did not want to get up earlier to pick out something herself to wear and 2.<br/>
because the &quot;family&quot; decided that we needed to go out to a bar-b-q the night<br/>
before and stay out late that I did not do any laundry and since no one wanted<br/>
to help me do the laundry, some of us did not have their favorite clothes to<br/>
wear (I did mine though)! When we got home later that day, she helped me<br/>
re-start some laundry!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026605759">Since Julian is home (for several years now) and is older (Twelve tomorrow!) <br/>
we generally expect that the three of us are partners, as members of the <br/>
family, in keeping the house liveable. We all try not to have anyone in <br/>
charge regularly of a task they hate. Of course, sometimes it&#39;s inevitable, <br/>
but there is sympathy from others when it&#39;s inescapable.<br/>
<br/>
Julian does all of the family laundry. He does not fold, but he treks up and <br/>
down from the basement, and is quite pleasant about it. He&#39;s generally very <br/>
cooperative about other tasks as needed, and we&#39;re all much happier now that <br/>
we have a wonderful cleaner come in every two weeks. Makes the house really <br/>
clean regularly, AND we have to straighten up for her to clean, so it doen&#39;t <br/>
get too scary.<br/>
<br/>
So we don&#39;t really have &quot;chores,&quot; exactly...just stuff we have to do (all of <br/>
us) to be able to live happily and to avoid squalor.<br/>

you jumped on me for our job list when it is nearly identical to<br/>

have chosen not to call cleaning the toilet and opportunity to do<br/>
something together.  But, if it helps y&#39;all to get stuff done to call it<br/>

HAS to be done or else there are consequences, or even as something that<br/>
gets rewarded if done (allowance) and I was just saying that we don&#39;t use<br/>
that method of housekeeping here.  So, yes, we do chores, but, no, we don&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197553307">Hey, what defines &quot;chore&quot;? Is a chore something set by an outside<br/>
authority (such as a parent) as a must do, or is a chore a task that<br/>
needs doing? It seems that how one defines chore would make a big<br/>
difference on whether or not the kids have &#39;em.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. And that you can&#39;t see the difference is really the heart of the<br/>
hundreds of posts to and from you over the past few days.<br/>
<br/>
Your post implies that you, as adult, decide that these things need to be<br/>
done, and the kids are assigned to help, or are jollied into helping, or<br/>
whatever. <br/>
<br/>
We do stuff because it needs to be done and we&#39;re there. Cacie is pretty<br/>
much the exclusive carpet sweeper-er and swiffer-er, and does it far more<br/>
often than I would. I generally do the laundry because I like it, and we<br/>
usually both fold and put away while we talk. Sometimes Cacie will be<br/>
doing something and not fold, and that&#39;s okay. Sometimes I&#39;ll put away<br/>
her clothes. Sometimes she&#39;ll put away mine. Sometimes I get uptight and<br/>
growl about the messiness and she either clears out until I get a grip or<br/>
decides to clean up some stuff... sometimes she kicks me out of a room<br/>
with orders not to re-enter until she says it&#39;s okay, and cleans the<br/>
whole thing. Sometimes I can&#39;t sleep and clean instead.<br/>
<br/>
To be honestly, the house is generally a bit of a tip, but I&#39;m working on<br/>
being okay with that. For a while I bartered with someone to clean, that<br/>
was cool. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921590418">&lt;&lt;  So, yes, we do chores, but, no, we don&#39;t<br/>
require chores. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a chore if you don&#39;t want to do it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same with &quot;work,&quot; I think.<br/>
A person can have a job and really enjoy it and WANT to be there, and so it&#39;s <br/>
not the same as &quot;just work&quot; where you get paid to toil (in the dirt or at a <br/>
desk) by the hour.<br/>
<br/>
When we clean the house, it&#39;s not a  chore any more than when we play around <br/>
with math it&#39;s &quot;math work.&quot;  It&#39;s playing.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I stacked a WHOLE bunch of wood, and it needed to be done, but it <br/>
was like a game, too, and a puzzle.  It wasn&#39;t a chore.  The bringing in of <br/>
wood has to do with the need for wood, and who has shoes on and who&#39;s not <br/>
doing something more important.<br/>
<br/>
If we  make it one person&#39;s job, that would be a chore, and if there was no <br/>
wood by the fireplace, a person would have failed.  There&#39;s no failure the <br/>
way we do it now, just success.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You may not consider this to be helpful advice, but the way that we have<br/>
recently dealt with chores is not to make a big issue out of them.<br/>
<br/>
A little background - I have 2 boys 9 & 11.<br/>
We&#39;ve went through many &quot;systems&quot; designed to incorporate chores into our<br/>
daily lives as if second nature, like brushing your teeth, right? But, no<br/>
matter what chart or list or system I devised, it worked for a few days or a<br/>
week, and then completely fell apart. It was always back to me nagging the<br/>
boys to do their assigned or randomly picked work, which is just plain<br/>
frustrating as you probably know. I really hate the atmosphere that nagging<br/>
creates in a household. I don&#39;t nag at my husband, I hate to be nagged at,<br/>
and I know my kids hate it too.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I wanted my kids to do chores was because like you, I felt it<br/>
was their responsbility to help out as a member of our family. Those<br/>
old-fashioned values and all that. Believe it or not, I also felt like I was<br/>
doing them a favor by helping them learn how to &quot;clean&quot;, so they could<br/>
function on their own as an adult and not live in filth. I had my boys doing<br/>
almost EVERYTHING. Dishes, dusting, general picking up, cleaning toilets<br/>
(FULL cleaning!), wiping bathroom sinks/counters, vacuuming, washing<br/>
windows, sweeping, etc. However, even with all my good intentions, my plans<br/>
always backfired on me. Chores always brought on feelings of resentment<br/>
between me and my kids, very similar feelings, btw, of our homeschooling<br/>
attempts and the frustrations that arose from that.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what my 10yo son actually said to me while it was his turn to do<br/>
dishes one night? He said &quot;I can&#39;t wait until I get married so I can make my<br/>
wife do the dishes and I won&#39;t ever have to do them again!&quot; I was shocked<br/>
and appalled that he would say that! I felt something was going drastically<br/>
wrong with my plan and teaching my boys responsibility regarding chores.<br/>
<br/>
This all changed shortly after we started unschooling. I soon learned about<br/>
the unschooling lifestyle that extended beyond not doing schoolwork. I<br/>
decided to just drop chores, just like I dropped schoolwork. How did the<br/>
work get done, you might ask? Well, *I* did most of it. I just started doing<br/>
the work when I noticed it needed to be done. I let go of my expectations of<br/>
a clean house *all the time*. Many times, when I would get in a cleaning<br/>
mood and put on some music to clean to, my boys would also just start<br/>
cleaning with me, without me asking them! I&#39;ll be honest, this didn&#39;t happen<br/>
right away, but I was patient and I gave it time, just like I did<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This is still the way our house is now. There are no assigned chores or<br/>
jobs. I&#39;ll admit I do most of the work, but I *AM* the mother here. And it<br/>
is not like I feel overwhelmed with cleaning, at this point. Of course, my<br/>
DH does help me whenever possible as time permits. He does his share, too.<br/>
But I&#39;m home much more than he his. My boys are still doing spontaneous<br/>
cleaning. They keep their rooms relatively clean most of the time. But, as<br/>
the mood hits them, they do other work, too. Last week my son actually<br/>
cleaned his entire bathroom, even the toilet, without me asking!! I also ask<br/>
them to help me with specific cleaning if there is a need, and they usually<br/>
oblige with no complaints. We are unschooling chores - it&#39;s working for us.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing, we never call them chores.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-389277630">Hi Lisa-<br/>
<br/>
I have struggled with many of the same issues over the years, too.  And <br/>
lately,  with really trying to be less authoritative than we have before, my <br/>
dh and I have really pondered this.<br/>
<br/>
This is what we&#39;re doing for now and it seems to be working okay.  We got <br/>
together with the kids and talked about being caretakers of our home, <br/>
posessions, etc.  in a family meeting.  We brainstormed about ways to take <br/>
care of the needs of the household and of each other without being bossy.  <br/>
<br/>
We threw a few ideas around and then came up with this one, which is what <br/>
we&#39;re doing.  We bought a white board for our hallway and we list things that <br/>
need to be done on it.  Anybody can write something on the list.  Then, a <br/>
couple of times a day, we all work together and choose something on the list <br/>
and do it.  Sometimes we don&#39;t use the list...it&#39;s just obvious what needs to <br/>
be done.  Also, many times, one of my older kids will just say...Mom, I <br/>
decided to go ahead and sew buttons on my pants and I erased it from the list.<br/>
<br/>
Some families can probably just do this cooperatively, without a list.  But, <br/>
having a  large family like we do, we thought we&#39;d try this first.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do rewards or punishments or anything to go with the list.  And the <br/>
list never really gets done.  But we erase it at the end of the day, because <br/>
we all decided we like a clean slate.<br/>
<br/>
Just one idea...I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get a bunch of good ones here.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to you!<br/>

something is not quite right but not as easy to figure out how to change it.<br/>
Listening to your varied responses has sure opened my eyes to some ways we<br/>
can alter our ADULT thinking and make our home a more peaceful place and our<br/>
children an active part of the decision making process. I had not viewed the<br/>
situation as one that should allow for a choice but I didn&#39;t grasp that I<br/>
had a choice as well. I don&#39;t know if this makes any sense to you all but it<br/>
SURE does to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544683902">Our breakthrough came when Lanora and I had a heart to heart about our<br/>
goals and how to reach them.  She doesn&#39;t care how messy the house is but<br/>
I am tense unless it is picked up and somewhat organized.  We were able<br/>
to get a better understanding of the conflict without anger and<br/>
resentment.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I was able to get across was that if she leaves a mess<br/>
it&#39;s the same as saying, &quot;Someone ELSE can do this.&quot;  This helped her to<br/>
see how actions, like cleaning up after yourself, can communicate caring<br/>
and cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
Both children know that if they want me to take them somewhere or play a<br/>
game with them I&#39;m much more available if I have help around the house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-948754691">I recently started a free online course called &quot;How To Provide A High<br/>
Quality Homeschooling Education On A Budget.&quot;<br/>
The first 5 lessons focus on organizing, balancing everything and learning<br/>
how to make chores fun for children so they will be more apt to participate.<br/>
There&#39;s lots of links to free printables and chore charts to help plan out<br/>
the tasks as well as info on age appropriate chores and rewards...if that&#39;s<br/>
the road you want to take.  For us, the reward is simply feeling good about<br/>
contributing to the family but I can understand paying for chores completed<br/>
too.  It all depends on each family&#39;s approach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269540343">&lt;&lt;but what if no one wants to feed the animals?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, before we ever get animals, we talk at length about what is required<br/>
to properly care for them, how much time it takes, etc..  We also talk about<br/>
who exactly is expected to do what, and about how an animal is like having a<br/>
baby, it is entirely dependent on you for its life.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest kids are 11 and 9 and have been fully responsible for their<br/>
animals for the last 3 years.  They currently have 3 goats, 6 rabbits, and 5<br/>
dogs between them.  We occasionally have the days where Zach and Adriane<br/>
balk about something, like who should get the can opener, and the animals&#39;<br/>
feeding is delayed.  I simply make an analogy of dh and myself acting that<br/>
way when it came time to feed the baby and ask what kind of parents do they<br/>
think we would be.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I also have goats, rabbits and dogs so the kids usually come<br/>
along to do their feedings while I&#39;m doing mine.  And I do think modeling<br/>
plays a big part.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do have to say that if we had an animal at our home that no one<br/>
was willing to be responsible for, I would think I owed it to the animal to<br/>
find it a different home.  Not as some punishment to the child, but just as<br/>
a karma-tao-spirit in the sky thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955981048">Yes, Jennifer and Lee~ That is how I pretty much do &quot;chores&quot; to.  My kids<br/>
will get pretty messy in their rooms and then one morning I go in and there<br/>
is an organization party going on. Or I will hand them a few of their<br/>
clothes that have just come out of the dryer and say could you hang these<br/>
up? And opportunities to cook with me are always welcomed!  My 5 year old<br/>
son wants to be a chef now.  He&#39;ll say to his dad what a great dinner he<br/>
made even if it was only the chopping onion part! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I know some parents that make a big deal out of the fact that their kids are<br/>
such and such an age now and by god they are going to see what it&#39;s like to<br/>
maintain a house.  Chore lists, stickers, groundings, tears, etc.  I<br/>
personally would never be organized enough to maintiain a chore list!<br/>
Plus I hope my kids learn to find joy in maintaining a home.  Not something<br/>
to groan over.  Although I am not the best, I enjoy cleaning out a drawer or<br/>
organizing a closet.  I like the smell of fresh towels out of the dryer...<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;My thoughts for the day, on a misty rainy spring day on Kauai from a<br/>

&gt; who has just been reminded how fortunate she really is!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>pleasure<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or the pleasure of being helpful.  Yesterday, Haleigh came in and asked me<br/>
&gt; if I would help HER clean up the kitchen and living room!  The floor was<br/>
&gt; sticky (not uncommon here) and she wanted to sit at the kitchen table and<br/>
&gt; draw and the living room was hiding behind a mountain of toys and pillows<br/>
&gt; and blankets from movie night the night before.  Of course, I was happy to<br/>
&gt; help.  While we were picking up, she told me she noticed how much better<br/>

&gt; doesn&#39;t take long and it keeps the house manageable during the day without<br/>

&gt; would carry a toy back to their room and get side-tracked so I was<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171475571">We did a cool thing, chorewise, the other day. I make chore lists <br/>
haphazardly, with lots of energy and focus on getting the work done, <br/>
and they usually last for a couple of weeks, and we let it go. Off <br/>
and on like that, and I don&#39;t know anyone who makes a chore list, who <br/>
follows it to the T every single day. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the other day, the house was icky. Needed a general pickup, <br/>
with windows wiped, and vacuuming. So, I wrote out a dozen chores on <br/>
little slips of paper. There are four of us, the three kids and I. <br/>
The idea was, to draw a chore, and then set the timer for ten <br/>
minutes. Each person working as fast as they could to get that chore <br/>
done, and stopping when the timer went off. <br/>
<br/>
In half an hour, we got 12 mini-chores done and the place looked <br/>
pretty good. The kitchen was completely tidied and sink shiny, the <br/>
bathrooms had received a once over, front room tables were <br/>
decluttered, and the floor vacuumed &quot;wherever people walk.&quot; IOW, not <br/>
a really thorough CLEAN cleaning job, but everything picked up. The <br/>
place looked nice when we were done. It&#39;s back to cluttered today! :) <br/>
and likely to stay that way...<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, it was a game. We had fun, working together, racing to see <br/>
who could get the most done. We might just make that a weekly event <br/>
around here!.........for a few weeks LOL<br/>
