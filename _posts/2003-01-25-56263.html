<div id="ygrps-yiv-498817532">NC is definetly in the Bible Belt.  I remember.. probably one of very few <br/>
social studies lessons that I &quot;retained&quot; from elementary school... being told <br/>
( proudly) that we lived in the Bible Belt.  It may have been in 2nd grade.. <br/>
We were shown a map of the Bible Belt region..  I looked for that map online, <br/>
but cant find it.  I did find several interesting articles ( as others have <br/>
mentioned)  This one is particularly &quot;enlightening&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freeinquirynetwork.com/BibleBelt.html&quot;">http://www.freeinquirynetwork.com/BibleBelt.html&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freeinquirynetwork.com/BibleBelt.html&lt;/A">http://www.freeinquirynetwork.com/BibleBelt.html&lt;/A</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At the risk of &quot;commenting on every little thing&quot;  ( which I have <br/>
successfully avoided for several days).  I will add that living in the Bible <br/>
Belt is not as restrictive/pressurized/suffocating.. as some seem to convey.  <br/>
 Yeah, there are some fundamentalists around here.  And yeah, some <br/>
conservative Christians.. Lots of churchs.. all kinds of demoninations, <br/>
beliefs, approaches, etc.  But I dont feel like I am made to feel like I <br/>
should conform or adapt to anyones beliefs to be &quot;accepted&quot;.  Maybe it does <br/>
go back to what someone else commented ( cant remember who).. that it takes a <br/>
certain type of personality to &quot;fall victim&quot; to that type of brainwashing.   <br/>
If someone tries to convince me that something is the right thing to do just <br/>
because THEY (or &quot;God&quot;, or some author, or leader, etc) thinks it is.. I am <br/>
not gonna buy it at face value.  I trust my own instincts and I have faith in <br/>
myself and my children enough to know when something feels wrong.    I feel <br/>
for those that do end up relying on others to tell them how to raise thier <br/>
children.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462436591">Maybe a test of whether or not you&#39;re in the Bible belt is this:<br/>
When strangers meet you, what do they say to be friendly?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Where do you live?&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;What do you do?&quot;<br/>
or <br/>
&quot;What church do you go to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody in Albuquerque asks that last question of strangers.<br/>
They might, after a bit, ask IF you go to church, or &quot;Where do you go to <br/>
church&quot; if religion comes up, but in the absence of religious discussion, <br/>
they&#39;re way more likely to ask where you grew up or what your kids like to <br/>
do.  Or if you ski.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got the church question when we moved to Virginia. And people offering to take us to their church as we were &#39;new&#39; and people asking if we&#39;d met Jesus yet. Coming from a country where I didn&#39;t know<br/>
anyone who actually went to church unless they were over 60 it was astounding and somewhat worrying. It still worries me. The only good thing is cycling on a sunday mornng is a dream cos all the SUV&#39;s<br/>
are parked in churches :-)<br/>

I&#39;m guessing they asked if you KNOW Jesus, not if you&#39;d &quot;met&quot; him.<br/>
But that&#39;s close enough for a heathen foreigner, Shyrley. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Well asking what church people go to is not only sizing them up as potential <br/>
friends, but it is &quot;witnessing,&quot; THE requirement of evangelical churches.<br/>

re-enactments. We&#39;re been too a few and they still talk about them damm yankees and grumble about how Virginia was at the forefront of the war and didn&#39;t get enough support from the states further<br/>
south.<br/>
I usually back away...<br/>
