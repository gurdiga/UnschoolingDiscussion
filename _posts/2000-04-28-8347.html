&lt;&lt;&gt; Mook (3yob) has an eye infection.  The doctor says if we don&#39;t put<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; eye<br/>
&gt; drops in Mook&#39;s eyes, he&#39;ll go blind.  Mook hates eye drops, and with<br/>
&gt; all the squirming, screaming, and tears, I don&#39;t think anything gets<br/>
&gt; in his eyes anyway.  His infection is getting worse.  DH forces the<br/>
&gt; eye drops (why he was screaming, etc).  I tried to be more gentle,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; Mook just runs away and says he&#39;s not ready yet.  He needs these<br/>
&gt; drops<br/>
&gt; in four times a day.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ready to make the decision<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; become blind (he says he&#39;d rather be blind than have eye drops).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do I do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could tell the doctor that you don&#39;t think much of the medicine is <br/>
reaching the eye,  or staying in the eye due to crying, and that might <br/>
motivate the doctor to discuss other treatment options with you.<br/>
<br/>
Would Mook be curious to try a game where you wrap a scarf or blindfold over <br/>
his eyes so he understands more accurately what it would be like to be blind? <br/>
 I would assume that he might not really comprehend the idea.<br/>
<br/>
I remember this age.  We visited Hawaii and I told my resistant son, &quot;you <br/>
have to wear sunscreen, or you&#39;ll burn up in the sun.&quot;  He answered me, &quot;I <br/>
want to burn up in the sun!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have sometimes used bribery to gain cooperation in difficult situations.  <br/>
But a child has to be old enough to have the self-control to deal with the <br/>
situation.  The drops may be too scary or uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
