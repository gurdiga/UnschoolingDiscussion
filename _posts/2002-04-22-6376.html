stories--it&#39;s not criticism of writers or families at all!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  We changed instructors at times and added or subtracted from their <br/>
commitment levels as well, but they would not be able to play now for their <br/>
own enjoyment or for performance if I hadn&#39;t pushed a little. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Was it something they really wanted?<br/>
<br/>
There are degrees of everything.  If they just vaguely said they were tired <br/>
of it, I&#39;d press my kids a LITTLE, to remind them of the good days (moments, <br/>
whatever) of whatever they were wanting to drop out of.  But if there were <br/>
tears and SERIOUS requests to quit, I wouldn&#39;t force them.<br/>
<br/>
Music has traditionally been a part of public school.  I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s on <br/>
the wane, but it is.  In the early 20th century,  music reading and sight <br/>
singing were common classroom activities in the early grades.  <br/>
<br/>
But looking back at those who learned music just because they were young and <br/>
others thought they should learn it, how many never touched the instrument <br/>
again after they were out of school?  <br/>
<br/>
And of those who learned an instrument on their own, out of personal <br/>
enthusiasm, are professional musicians, or regularly-playing amateurs?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Assuming that your kids will suddenly discover and teach themselves all <br/>
they need to know at 16 to be successful in college is risky IMO. Big dreams <br/>
require some planning. Being highly skilled demands discipline. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;all they need to know&quot;?  There were things I didn&#39;t know when I went <br/>
to college, but I graduated in four straight years without a break.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
know, for example, what &quot;three credit hours&quot; meant.  Not a clue.  I had no <br/>
idea what &quot;anthropology&quot; was.  I had never heard of some of the things there. <br/>
 I had never seen a Shakespeare play, I had only seen the 1968 Romeo and <br/>
Juliet which had come out a few years before.  When I took a Shakespeare <br/>
class, I was LOST, totally.<br/>
<br/>
I got good grades in high school, took extra classes, graduated early, but I <br/>
didn&#39;t know all I needed to know.<br/>
<br/>
There are a hundred things or more my children know now that I didn&#39;t know <br/>
when I went to college at 17.  And none of them are 16 yet. <br/>
<br/>
There are some things my kids don&#39;t know that I did know when I was their age.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Success in college or having any job requires the ability to schedule your <br/>
time and being able to show up to do work even when you don&#39;t feel like it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How do people learn to schedule time and show up and work?<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s by having their moms wake them up every day just for <br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it comes from dads saying &quot;You have to get up at 7:00 on <br/>
Saturday and help me in the garden because someday you&#39;ll have a job and...&quot;  <br/>
 They didn&#39;t apply for that job!<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby wanted to watch and record all the Pokemon TV shows when he was <br/>
ten or so, he set his own alarm, got the tapes in, and marked them.  He still <br/>
has all those tapes at 15.  I didn&#39;t tell him to do that.  <br/>
<br/>
When he was offered a job at 14, he already knew well how to use an alarm <br/>
clock.  I still help him out, but way more often than not when I come to make <br/>
sure he&#39;s awake, he&#39;s already up and getting in the shower.<br/>
<br/>
If a person wants to take a class, he or she will set an alarm and get there. <br/>
 The more they want to take it, the more likely they&#39;ll arrange their lives <br/>
around it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The computer gamer of today may want to be the engineer of tomorrow. He <br/>
will need to know long division. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he can divide in his head, learning the format of a long division problem <br/>
school-style won&#39;t take but a few moments to get.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some of our kids will be the veterinarians of tomorrow. They will love <br/>
making sick animals well--they will need lots of science courses. The&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They will need to know lots of science.  That doesn&#39;t have to come from <br/>
courses.  If they&#39;re already confident and conversant about real-world <br/>
scientific knowledge, success in a college course doesn&#39;t have the <br/>
pre-requisite of prior success in a lower-level course.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some of our kids, I&#39;m convinced,  won&#39;t need college or any advanced <br/>
planning and can make a great life living in the moment always. Some will <br/>
want law school or to be ballerinas.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The best preparation for law school is the ability to read critically, and to <br/>
see different aspects.  One of my boys&#39; best skills which would transfer <br/>
directly to law is their amazing ability to read and understand the rules of <br/>
complex games.  The booklets for some of their CCGs (collectible card games, <br/>
like Legend of Five Rings, Seventh Sea, etc) run 60 pages and are as <br/>
complicated as any contract!  And we have friends who have gone through law <br/>
school while visiting here monthly or more, and the kids have always heard <br/>
stories from them.<br/>
<br/>
In college, some kids take political science as a preparation for law, but <br/>
English majors and history majors probably come better prepared in general <br/>
for what Law requires.  And the preparation to understand English and history <br/>
is right up unschoolers&#39; boulevards!  (Unschoolers so rarely experience <br/>
alleys in their lives...)<br/>

<br/>
Speaking from personal experience, my biggest obstacles in learning have<br/>
been the blocks created by being forced to attempt them in ps.  Lanora<br/>
(11) encounters college reading material and has no fear, it&#39;s a lark for<br/>
her.  She&#39;s free of the baggage created by having stuff she wasn&#39;t ready<br/>
for stuffed down her throat and it all flows into the stream she&#39;s<br/>
already in.  Consequently she is able to grasp scientific and<br/>
mathematical ideas that still make my muscles tense.<br/>
