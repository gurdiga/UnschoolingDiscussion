<br/>
&lt;&lt; Then we wonder why teenagerhood is so hard?  I think<br/>
it&#39;s because kids feel betrayed and ignored, and<br/>
overreact with this false, early, independence.  Well,<br/>
looking back, that was my experience, anyway.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of my three kids, Kirby is the most betrayed/ignored, because I had two more <br/>
kids.   I look back and can think of lots of incidents I wish I could change.<br/>
<br/>
He gets TONS of attention.  He&#39;s usually the sparkliest guy in  a group, and <br/>
he hangs out with several groups of kids.    .0But between the two of us <br/>
there&#39;s a growing disconnect, a shortness of patience and regard.  It&#39;s more subtle <br/>
than most people would see.  It&#39;s at a feeling level, and a facial-expression <br/>
level, mostly.  I was talking to Marty about it yesterday and said Kirby was <br/>
acting like most people&#39;s kids start acting when they&#39;re twelve (in way of <br/>
backhandedly admitting I&#39;m pretty lucky that it took this long for him to feel <br/>
crowded), and I wish I remembered exactly what Marty said, but it was something <br/>
like &quot;Maybe we just takes us longer to grow into our big-shoes.&quot;  (emphasis on <br/>
the Big, if big was the word he used.  Some  shoes)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s instinctive on both our parts.  If he felt safer at home than <br/>
out, he wouldn&#39;t go.  We&#39;re not in a hurry for him to go.  He&#39;s not in a hurry <br/>
to go, either.  But I feel the thoughts and feelings as I felt strong new <br/>
feelings and urges and &quot;knowings&quot; when I had babies.<br/>
<br/>
I better save some of these phrases for an article I&#39;m working on. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think part of it is some misplaced need to toughen<br/>
them up, make them grow up faster, push them out of<br/>
the nest, I don&#39;t know.   Is it possible it&#39;s<br/>
instinct, from the days when kids this age are soon to<br/>
be parents, and have families and homes of their own?-=-<br/>
<br/>
On TV commercials and print ads, they often show older kids playing with a <br/>
game or toy than the actual target audience.  Part of the sell in such cases is <br/>
the identification with the older kids.  <br/>
<br/>
You know how snakes swallow?  How people swallow?  How that motion starts and <br/>
then just perpetuates itself until the wad is through?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t go to kindergarten, but I&#39;ve had relatives go (and my brother, when <br/>
he was in my care at that age) and the background song was &quot;When you get to <br/>
real school...&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
I remember from first grade, the explanations of the big pencils and fat <br/>
crayons.    They were so when we got to second grade and couldn&#39;t us those <br/>
anymore, we would be ready.  The dotted lines in our practice paper wouldn&#39;t be there <br/>
anymore when we got to second grade.<br/>
<br/>
In sixth grade they started in on us about Jr. High, and how much different <br/>
it would be, and we needed to look at that, and want it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that&#39;s a threat, and sometimes it&#39;s a happy goal.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But when you get to *high* school...&quot;<br/>
&quot;In college, they won&#39;t baby you the way we do in high school...&quot;<br/>
&quot;This level of writing wouldn&#39;t cut it in grad school, but it&#39;s okay for a <br/>
Jr. English paper...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So people aren&#39;t living in the moment or appreciating being where they are <br/>
(except on South Park, where they decided to stay in 2nd grade, right? or <br/>
third?&lt;g&gt;).  They&#39;re looking at the older kids and wondering what all they have to <br/>
do to be them.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen very little of that with unschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
There is an instinct, I&#39;m sure, on the part of child and parent, but I think <br/>
there&#39;s a cultural swallowing that happens.  It has the movement and pressure <br/>
and the kids are gone.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine my 18 yo son being as attached to me as my 10 yo son is  <br/>
right now.  I can&#39;t imagine him still wanting full body hugs and lying in  bed <br/>
with me before sleep.  I can&#39;t imagine my 21 yo son being as in tune  with my <br/>
facial expressions and intimate words as he once was.  He has  transferred all of <br/>
that to his lovely wife.  <br/>
 <br/>
At some point our sons (I don&#39;t know about daughters) have to pull away to  <br/>
allow themselves intimacy with another woman.  I truly don&#39;t believe they  can <br/>
be intimate with their mothers and their significant others to the same  <br/>
degree.  That&#39;s why there are jokes about it.  It happens in  increments.  It <br/>
seemed to be most noticeable for us when they both had  their first kiss.  Kissing <br/>
mom was way different for them after that.  <br/>
 <br/>
However, my son has been married for over a year now, and conversation and  <br/>
intimacy of a sort has come back around, naturally.  I think you&#39;re right  <br/>
about it being instinctive, and I think it happens to some degree to all kids,  <br/>
unschooled or not.  Probably differently for unschooled kids, but it still  <br/>
happens.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76584524">That&#39;s what&#39;s going on with dh and son, but not son<br/>
and me, or at least, not as much.  Shortness of<br/>
patience, yes.  Like all of a sudden, &quot;You should know<br/>
better&quot; applies.  Flashback to own childhood,&quot; How<br/>
should I know better if you never explained it to me<br/>
or showed me?&quot;  That&#39;s the betrayal part.  Even when I<br/>
was old enough to actually formulate and ask that<br/>
question, I got no answer! That frustration lasted<br/>
from 10-11 and culminated at 19 when I finally left<br/>
home to figure it out by myself, the hard way.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll notice it more as he gets older, between<br/>
us, like you seemed to with Kirby, but am conscious of<br/>
it now, actively fighting it, inside.  That&#39;s what is<br/>
making it feel like it might be instinct, but I&#39;m sure<br/>
you&#39;re right that the society part of it is the<br/>
stronger influence.  <br/>
<br/>
My son has many many younger cousins.  It drives him<br/>
crazy that they want to spend so much time following<br/>
him around.  He literally hides, and they find him<br/>
anyway! lol He&#39;s getting better at gently saying, not<br/>
right now, or, trying to give them a little so they<br/>
let go.  <br/>
<br/>
Crazy that they feel that pressure so young,  eek. Now<br/>
I&#39;m glad that I model an adult playing with them with<br/>
a childlike quality no one else will deign to do with<br/>
them.  <br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s stronger, I just think it accelerates it.  Younger kids <br/>
long to be older. <br/>

<br/>
When my kids are avoiding younger kids I try to remind them of how they felt <br/>
when they were younger and wanted to play with older kids.  They all remember, <br/>
and they try to be more patient with the adoration of younger kids.  I think <br/>
that&#39;s a natural thing too, wanting to be with the big kids.<br/>
<br/>
But schools use it as a constant &quot;you better be good, better not cry&quot; kind of <br/>
threat/promise.  Its one thing when a child has  a real desire, and another <br/>
when the desire is pounded into him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823855009">Sandra, it has taken me years - over a decade really - to move from what <br/>
is now called eclectic homeschooling, to unschooling.  So my #1ds had <br/>
the hardest time from me. His period of<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;growing disconnect, a shortness of patience and regard. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>between the two of us started earlier, lasted the longest (so far!) and <br/>
was the most obvious, in your face.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s more subtle <br/>
&gt;than most people would see.  It&#39;s at a feeling level, and a facial-expression <br/>
&gt;level, mostly.  I was talking to Marty about it yesterday and said Kirby was <br/>
&gt;acting like most people&#39;s kids start acting when they&#39;re twelve (in way of <br/>
&gt;backhandedly admitting I&#39;m pretty lucky that it took this long for him to feel <br/>
&gt;crowded), and I wish I remembered exactly what Marty said, but it was something <br/>
&gt;like &quot;Maybe we just takes us longer to grow into our big-shoes.&quot;  (emphasis on <br/>
&gt;the Big, if big was the word he used.  Some  shoes)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My next son is nearly 21, and it was much much later, very subtle, still <br/>
on going in a very subtle way.<br/>
<br/>
The 17yo has just started, about 6 months ago and is a bit more antsy <br/>
with it, but it&#39;s liveable with almost all of the time.<br/>
<br/>
I think that there are many variables:  how your relationship is to <br/>
start with, the kid&#39;s personality, your own personality, etc etc.  But <br/>
if our kids are to become truely independent, they have to put distance <br/>
between themselves and us.  If your relationship is good, respectful, <br/>
fearless, as yours seems to be, and you have unschooled in the full <br/>
sense of the word - the way you use it - then it will be a subtle <br/>
distancing. It is still sad for us mothers, but seems necessary.  But <br/>
then after a while, the relationship stablizes again, settling down into <br/>
a slightly different place.  If you have screwed up the way I did with <br/>
my eldest, then it is a much more violent and distressing thing - but <br/>
still not without hope.  He is married, and has two children now, only 2 <br/>
1/2 and 8 months, but both getting married and having kids has changed <br/>
his perspective a lot - he&#39;s more sympathetic to the feelings he now <br/>
understands that I had, and of course, I have traveled a long way in my <br/>
head, and behaviour, since those bad days.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think it&#39;s instinctive on both our parts. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I really believe it is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If he felt safer at home than <br/>
&gt;out, he wouldn&#39;t go.  We&#39;re not in a hurry for him to go.  He&#39;s not in a hurry <br/>
&gt;to go, either.  But I feel the thoughts and feelings as I felt strong new <br/>
&gt;feelings and urges and &quot;knowings&quot; when I had babies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s like the baby led weaning we talked about at La Leche League.  It <br/>
never ceases to amaze me how LLL ideas remain so pertinent to my life <br/>
even now my kids are 23, 21, 17, & 14.  Just as our children gradually <br/>
weaned from the breast, and then from needing our physical presence all <br/>
the time - as long as they knew they had us to return to whenever they <br/>
wanted, so our young adults are lucky if they have a home, parents, that <br/>
they can feel comfortable in using as a safe base that will always be <br/>
there for them, enabling them to venture forth into the world futher and <br/>
further.  Those who are pushed away, made to &#39;stand on their own two <br/>
feet&#39;, be real men, blah blah, will be less able to actually be <br/>
independent in their Being.  They will rebel violently or become passive <br/>
blobs.  They will be needy adults - like me - rather than really <br/>
independent.  They may be loud, brash, rebellous, agressive even, but <br/>
that is not real independence.  I feel sad for me, sad for my eldest son <br/>
- but we are all doing better now.  But I also really do think it is <br/>
partly a personality thing too.<br/>
<br/>
The LLL image is the one I like to use - though it is hard to think like <br/>
that sometimes when you are looking up at your 6&#39;3&quot; son who is being <br/>
antsy!  But it really is just another weaning process.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is rambling - I&#39;ve had a wonderful but very busy week, am <br/>
very tired, and the brain is just not functioning as well as I would <br/>
like.  I hope I&#39;ve made some sense here.<br/>

blog by a teeneage girl who was at the time (2002) a freshman in highshcool.  I read <br/>
through this childs blog and was both saddened (I can relate to my teenage years) <br/>
and thankful!  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who are &quot;lurkers&quot; in this group, (like me), who are unsure of <br/>
themselves and need a &quot;shot in the arm&quot; once in a while, you might find reading this <br/>
childs blog (and the links to her friends blogs) an inspiration in a sad kind of way.  My <br/>
heart bled for her as I read through her writings and I was taken so swiftley back to <br/>
those days when that was me!   On June 17 she talks about the pressure to act more <br/>
mature than she feels.  You can see how knowing that she has no control over <br/>
anything she does or &quot;is&quot; feeds all sorts of negative thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bleachedblack.blogspot.com/">http://www.bleachedblack.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
The only other blog I read was that of her newly &quot;x-boyfriend&quot;, Pedro.  These two <br/>
children show both insightfulness and neediness that has fallen upon deaf ears.  It&#39;s <br/>
so sad.<br/>
<br/>
After I read these, I was once again reassured that public school is not something that <br/>
my children need ever feel they &quot;missed out on&quot;!  And that the parenting approaches <br/>
endorsed here and on Unschooling.com are the ONLY way for me and my family!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744278053">If your relationship is good, respectful, <br/>

then after a while, the relationship stablizes again, settling down into <br/>
a slightly different place. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this lately...the growing up, and distancing.  First let me say that I was not always unschooling my son.  I haven&#39;t been following this thread, but we didn&#39;t start seriously unschooling until about 2 years ago, and it wasn&#39;t until the past 18 months or so that I really let go.  My son has taken the brunt of a lot of my mistakes, some of which were quite harsh.  So, let me just put out there that &quot;there is hope&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
As i let go, our relationship righted itself, and came back into balance, and its been a beautiful thing that I will FOREVER cherish, especially now that he is growing up and moving toward living his own life.  I can&#39;t tell you how glad I am that I backed off...and how sorry I feel for my friends who think they still must fight with their kids to get things done.<br/>
<br/>
My son (almost 16 years old) is the one who has moved away from me the most.  Not in a violent way, just in a natural way.  I hadn&#39;t expected it so soon!  I really really miss him.  I suppose empty nest is just starting to settle in.  He doesn&#39;t need me in the same tangible way he used to.  It hurts a little bit.  We mostly now just enjoy each other&#39;s company.<br/>
<br/>
The only real difference between him now at 16 and when he is 20 is that he doesn&#39;t have a job, and isn&#39;t driving.  Other than those two practical matters, he is all but living his own life under our roof...with us there all the time for &quot;back up&quot; and support. I would feel completely comfortable leaving him at home alone for the weekend.  We did almost that this past weekend and it was fine.  He even cleaned up a bit around the house, took care of the animals, and WASHED THE DISHES!!!! WOW!<br/>
<br/>
I just cannot believe it.  Its like this man sprouted out of nowhere, and kidnapped my son!! LOL.  I cannot believe how fast it all happened!  He&#39;s a great guy.  Still has a few quirks that are annoying, but then we all do I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just wanted to share that relationships can be re-balanced, and that its so important to do it, because its really all you&#39;ll have left when they are grown.<br/>
