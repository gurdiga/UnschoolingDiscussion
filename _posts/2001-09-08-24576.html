<div id="ygrps-yiv-207327711">I bet others have answered this, but I can&#39;t resist these really cool <br/>
questions:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; well is it ok for the kid who&#39;s unschooled to<br/>
just be mediochre, happy but not necessarily super<br/>
talented... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Talent is inborn.  It can be encouraged and nurtured, but it can&#39;t be <br/>
created.  It can be squished and destroyed, but unschooling won&#39;t do that.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t come upon anything that lights them all up inside until <br/>
they&#39;re older, maybe grown.  It&#39;s okay.  If they&#39;re happy and receptive and <br/>
confident, all their opportunities will come at a good time!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;and what if  a child never really gravitates to a<br/>
specific area, doesn&#39;t seem interested&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Interested&quot; can be momentary.  It doesn&#39;t have to be obsession with one <br/>
area.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;what if she learns<br/>
to read so late that all the years of not reading, well, are<br/>
those wasted years of learning because she couldn&#39;t read?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wasted years of learning?<br/>
<br/>
I have late readers.  Not reading didn&#39;t keep them from learning all KINDS of <br/>
things that were &quot;beyond their grade level&quot;--whereas kids in school who learn <br/>
to read are thereafter presented with history and science at their reading <br/>
level.  Babified, small-words, short sentences, easy questions to answer.  My <br/>
kids have never experienced any of that &quot;The Queen gave Columbus a boat.  She <br/>
gave him sailors,&quot; kind of history.  They pick it up as adults do, from <br/>
museums, historical sites, movies, paintings, discussions about why &quot;New <br/>
Mexico,&quot; why so many Swedes in Minnesota, where did our ancestors come from, <br/>
etc.<br/>
