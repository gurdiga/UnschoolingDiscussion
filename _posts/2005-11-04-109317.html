not &quot;my bed.&quot;    And now he hardly snores ever, at all.   There was something <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d kick DH - but not out of bed. His snoring was part and parcel of <br/>
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) - the snoring was the *good* part. The <br/>
bad part was when he stopped - because that meant he wasn&#39;t <br/>
breathing either. So, I&#39;d kick him, he&#39;d snort, gasp, and start <br/>
snoring (and breathing) again. By the time I *finally* convinced him <br/>
to get it checked out (and his doctor mentioned it), the sleep lab <br/>
recorded his breathing stopping 100+ times *per hour* overnight. <br/>
Yoiks! Now he has a Constant Positive Air Pressure machine (CPAP) <br/>
that is like an air compressor with a face mask. It forces air in <br/>
when he inhales to keep his throat muscles from getting all loose <br/>
and collapsing while he&#39;s asleep. It&#39;s not O2, just plain old air. <br/>
He is finally, after many many years, getting REM and NREM sleep <br/>
(the really deep levels) that he wasn&#39;t getting before (stopping <br/>
breathing causes waking, even if you don&#39;t notice you are waking).<br/>
<br/>
So, for those of you with loudly snoring parents, spouses, kids (yes <br/>
OSA is possible in kids - often related to swollen <br/>
tonsils/adenoids), get it checked out. It could be something simple <br/>
like seasonal allergies or a head cold causing congestion and <br/>
snoring. Or it could be something more.<br/>

leave without bothering him him because it is not his fault.  However, <br/>
one time I got so irritated that I rolled over and plugged his <br/>
nose...LOL  He woke up and I snatched my hand away real quick and <br/>
faked like I was sleeping.  When morning came around, I realized I <br/>
wasn&#39;t as slick as I thought, he was laughing his ass off at my <br/>
attempt to stifle him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507784526">Heh.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we strive to be awful, hateful and uncaring parents but somehow  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t work out that way ;)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a king-size bed and our sleeping went AWOL trying to  <br/>
fit 4 people in a Queen size --my kids have always been big for their  <br/>
age. So we thought, what is good for the goose is good for the  <br/>
gander. The little guy never slept in a crib because my kids share a  <br/>
bed since forever. Best decision we ever made was not to get them  <br/>
separate beds.<br/>
<br/>
I do love sleeping with them --it&#39;s my oldest &#39;boy&#39; who doesn&#39;t enjoy  <br/>
it. Whenever he goes on a business trip the kids sleep with me. On  <br/>
weekends the kids get to sleep out in the sofa bed and I sometimes  <br/>
join in. And if they have a nightmare or are sick, we do end up  <br/>
sleeping togehter.<br/>
<br/>
All in all though, being able to sleep without a foot up my butt or  <br/>
the obnoxious snoring of 3 guys in my bed is, well ... glorious. When  <br/>
Mark&#39;s snoring gets out of control though, I just end up in the sofa;  <br/>
which i have come to love and adore --the sofa, not the snoring :)<br/>
<br/>
In NYC it seems, by my not so scientific survey, that sibling &#39;co- <br/>
sleeping&#39; is indeed common --as well as rampant sofa sleeping. I  <br/>
don&#39;t know why this is not promoted more. It makes so much sense.<br/>
