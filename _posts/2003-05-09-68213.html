 </span></blockquote>I said 89.. :-)  ( I even rechecked..lol)  Anna&#39;s was born in 89, and she is <br/>
13, BUT, her birthday is in October.. She will be 14 this year.   Anyway, now <br/>
I really know how old Abigail is.   <br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, check the site..  I don&#39;t nose around on there too much.  Landon has <br/>
144 poems on there (yeah, I just checked)   Here is my WWUD? or rather, what <br/>
is your opinion.   OK , so Landon has been putting his poems up on this site <br/>
for a few years.  Once, I asked him what his &quot;screen name&quot; is on the site so <br/>
I could read some of his poems..He said NO!.  NO! I do not want you to read <br/>
my stuff.   OK OK, so I didnt.. But I REALLY REALLY wanted to.  And I was <br/>
thinking, heck, how will he ever know??  They are published for the public at <br/>
large... Why can&#39;t I read them too??  Then, another time, he forgot to sign <br/>
out of the site, and I saw his screen name and I couldn&#39;t resist, I read a <br/>
couple of his poems.  ( Very intense, btw)  I felt sooo guilty, like I had <br/>
sneaked in his journal or poked in his room or something.   I didn&#39;t read <br/>
anymore.   Today, in telling Heidi about the Starlite Cafe, and in recalling <br/>
Landon&#39;s poetic abilities, I got the urge again to read his poems.  So, <br/>
SHOULD I??   <br/>

date of 94, and so said 89<br/>
<br/>
btw, reading your kid&#39;s poetry...like you said, it&#39;s a public site. <br/>
But now that you&#39;ve read it...heh heh heh...you can&#39;t comment on it <br/>
to him, or he&#39;ll KNOW. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744641943">There is a  regular feature in the Oprah magazine where a famous <br/>
person is asked about their favorite books. This month, Michael Moore <br/>
mentions How Children Learn. What I found interesting about his <br/>
comments was he recommends Holt&#39;s books for teachers to read. I guess <br/>
he never got to the part where Holt became a homeschool advocate. <br/>
Anyway, I was glad to see Holt&#39;s books mentioned, especially because <br/>
for the most part, Oprah and everything to do with her is very much <br/>
in favor of the god almightly educational system. There is much I <br/>
love about her show and what she promotes, but education and raising <br/>
children, etc. are not one of them. But it is great to see John <br/>
Holt&#39;s name in such a mainstream publication. . . I guess!<br/>

Oh heck yes!  Because IF anyone goes looking, they will find just a couple of <br/>
pro-school-REFORM books, and more natural learning and homeschooling books!  <br/>
Tadaa!!   He let a little light in and TRIED to aim and focus it, but those <br/>
books aren&#39;t always so easy to find. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting us know of that mention.  VERY cool!<br/>

trust you.<br/>
<br/>
And he will feel less comfortable posting his poetry there since he knows<br/>
you might look again -- you broke a promise once so what&#39;s to say you won&#39;t<br/>
break it again? -- so perhaps he won&#39;t post any more. Or he&#39;ll post only<br/>
poems that don&#39;t reveal anything about himself for fear you&#39;ll read them.<br/>
<br/>
And both of those will probably have an effect on his ability to release<br/>
what he needs to release.<br/>

( Ok, except that one time, by &#39;accident&quot;, which he doesnt know about, and I <br/>
only read 2) But, I have to admit, I really want to read them.   It would be <br/>
so much easier if he had them tucked away somewhere in his own private place. <br/>
But, I have to think of that little corner of the web as his own private <br/>
place..<br/>

You&#39;ve said that, though.<br/>
You don&#39;t need our permission, and even if a bunch of people here said, <br/>
&quot;Sure!  Read them!&quot; it would STILL be your very own personal decision.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of my kids&#39; friends post on a site called Dead Journals.  I&#39;ve read some <br/>
of that.  It&#39;s WEIRD that kids do that.  It&#39;s kind of an international slam <br/>
book, in a way (not quite, but slam books came to mind, and those are <br/>
horrible things).  The idea of kids posting journals where others can read <br/>
them is pretty bizarre, and it doesn&#39;t have the same reality a locked box <br/>
under the bed has.   So I&#39;m not so sure the same privacy rules apply.<br/>
<br/>
The internet is all new territory, and most of the ancient (fifteen year old) <br/>
&quot;netiquette&quot; was written by computer dweebs famous for lack of interpersonal <br/>
intelligence (a.k.a. &quot;social skills&quot;) and they often don&#39;t even begin to <br/>
match up with common sense or etiquette in general.<br/>

&quot;&quot;It&#39;s taken for granted in adult society that we cannot all be &#39;generalists&#39; <br/>
skilled in every area of learning and mastery. Nevertheless, we apply <br/>
tremendous pressure to our children to be good at everything. They are <br/>
expected to shine in math, reading, writing, speaking, spelling, <br/>
memorization, comprehension, problem solving...and none of us adults can do <br/>
all this,&quot; observes Dr. Levine. Learning begins in school, but it doesn&#39;t end <br/>
there. Frustrating a child&#39;s desire to learn will have lifelong <br/>
repercussions. This frustration can be avoided if we understand that not <br/>
every child can do equally well in every type of learning. We must begin to <br/>
pay more attention to individual learning styles, to individual minds, urges <br/>
Dr. Levine, so that we can maximize children&#39;s learning potential. In A Mind <br/>
at a Time, he shows us how. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course, unschoolers know this stuff already, *grin* but it&#39;s reaching <br/>
parents and teachers, and that&#39;s a good thing for kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Dr. Mel Levine wrote two books, A Mind at a Time and The Myth of Laziness.  <br/>
They both look like good reads.<br/>

journals would be weird, especially if one used thier real names and the <br/>
names of all the parties involved.<br/>
