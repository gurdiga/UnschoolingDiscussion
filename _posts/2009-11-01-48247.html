<div id="ygrps-yiv-864832397">After having a nice email talk with Sandra about this i wanted to post and see if they are others here who have kids that don&#39;t wipe either.<br/>
My son is 8yo. He is afraid of getting his hands messy. I have provided wipes and told him he can wash afterwards. I told Sandra that once after telling him to try wiping i walked away but he yelled:mommy! mommy! you do it! of course i came back and did it for him. I have put the tissue bunch or wipe in his hand and like quided him through but he won&#39;t go for even that.<br/>
 Anyone have kids that aren&#39;t ready either? Any words that you use to encourage your child?<br/>
I&#39;m okay with him not being ready but honestly want to know if and how i can help him.</div>

<br/>
Jayn went through a process of needing me to wipe, to wiping herself part of <br/>
the time, to wiping and calling me to check if she was clean, to taking care <br/>
of herself entirely. I&#39;m thinking that the last time she was asking me to <br/>
check her every time was about two years ago, so around 8. It has really <br/>
only been about a year and a bit since she has moved to almost total <br/>
bathroom independence.<br/>
<br/>
There was never a time where I was putting the tissue in her hand and <br/>
guiding her. Never occurred to me to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Nor did I ever say anything to her to encourage her readiness to wipe <br/>
herself. That seemed to come naturally over time.<br/>
<br/>
Now if she would only flush every time....<br/>

himself.  Somewhere between late 8 years old and sometime when he was  <br/>
10 he started wiping himself.<br/>
<br/>
One time a friend was visiting and witnessed me going in to the  <br/>
bathroom to wipe him, when he called mah-aaaaaaahm.   And she said  <br/>
she was so glad to see that, because she was still wiping her 5 year  <br/>
olds butt, and thought she should be done with that, but realized she  <br/>
most likely had a few more years to go.<br/>

  &quot;It&#39;s not that I feel that school is a good idea gone wrong,&quot; he says, &quot;but a wrong idea from the word go. It&#39;s a nutty notion that we can have a place where nothing but learning happens, cut off from the rest of life.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123571983">I was still wiping my son when he was eight, it stopped when he was about<br/>
10.  He began to do it himself because he would usually go right before a<br/>
shower and would wash himself.  He didn&#39;t want to use his hands to clean<br/>
THAT spot so I suggested he use wipes which he could toss into the toilet.<br/>
From that it was easy, one day he just started doing it himself all the<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I know his need for privacy and modesty grew and eventually outweighed his<br/>
concerns about doing it himself.  My son is almost 12 now and he likes me to<br/>
wash his hair but nothing more, it&#39;s a natural progression.  He makes sure I<br/>
can&#39;t see anything and in time that will motivate him to wash his own hair<br/>
too.  Just 2 days ago his sister and I were talking about how we thought so<br/>
many things like this would never end but they do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380419001">Could he put on a rubber cleaning glove first?  That way his hand is sure to<br/>
stay clean.  And if anything DOES get on the glove (probably won&#39;t...) they<br/>
are easy to wipe off and re-use.<br/>

of course,  a bidet! great idea! a bit costly  for an 8 yr old but a home improvement<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can get a rubber shower attachment which fits onto the bath or basin<br/>
taps; that&#39;s much cheaper than a bidet, if you have taps within reach. Or in<br/>
some places you can get a hand-held spray which fixes to the pipes, but you<br/>
can&#39;t necessarily adjust the temperature on those. I doubt many<br/>
eight-year-olds would be keen on cleaning themselves in cold water.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765423331">I believe that they eventually get to the point where they will do it themselves.  My middle son, about 7 years old, wanted to bathe himself completely.  My 8 year old still wants us to bathe him, but he covers his privates with his hands.<br/>
<br/>
My 8 and 10 year olds still sleep in our room.  My oldest (19) grew out of this about the age of 9.  It is too much for them to sleep in our bed... we all don&#39;t fit and then none of us get any sleep.  Especially with the littlest flinging arms and feet around.  So, they have their matteress on the floor at the foot of our bed.  Thankfully we have a spare bedroom for my husband and I to take care of grown up needs.  Hee-hee.<br/>
<br/>
My point being... eventually he will get to the point where he will take care of himself because he wants to or is just at the age where he might become a little more private about his body.  It&#39;s actually a sad day when they do....  I miss seeing those cute little baby buns!!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025236501">So good to have this come up!  My son too didn&#39;t start wiping until sometime after 11 (the premoistened wipes helped a lot) and for quite a while he would ask for a &quot;check&quot; to make sure everything was clean.  He always has hated to get his hands dirty or sticky (although he&#39;s quite happy to jump into a mud puddle and get filthy all over) and from time to time this has worried me.  But gradually he just took everything over (hairwash checking was the last thing to go, at 14) when he felt he could do things to his own high standards.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back I think it was having more friends around, who could pop into the bathroom and get out quickly to go back to play, that was a BIG incentive for him.<br/>
