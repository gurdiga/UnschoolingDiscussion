otherwise) don&#39;t necessarily end up doing many of the things that they<br/>
thought they would do at one time. My sister&#39;s heart was set on being a<br/>
veterinarian, then she graduated with a degree in piano performance. Now she<br/>
heads up an accounting department at a university. I was going to be an<br/>
airline pilot, but didn&#39;t want to go the military route and didn&#39;t have the<br/>
money to do otherwise. Then I decided on photographer, so I got an art<br/>
degree, then I wanted to do computer graphics, so I added computer science.<br/>
I ended up working at Microsoft as a software tester , now I&#39;m a mom and<br/>
have just about finished writing my first novel. I&#39;m sure most of us have<br/>
similar stories. It&#39;s not a catastrophe of life if we don&#39;t end up doing at<br/>
35 what we had envisioned at 15.<br/>
I think the best lesson is the one you&#39;ve mentioned above, to enjoy the days<br/>
we have *right now* and to savor the meandering path that life leads us on.<br/>
Who knows our future, or our children&#39;s? Plan for it, yes, but don&#39;t beat<br/>
yourself up about it and for heaven&#39;s sake, don&#39;t spend your kids&#39; childhood<br/>
nagging them about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001459853">You know what I love most about life?  Even if you DO do what you thought you wanted (I did), you can change your mind ANY time.<br/>
<br/>
I could just decide that I don&#39;t want to be a nurse anymore and do something totally different!<br/>
<br/>
Thats the neat thing about unschooling.  Its all about embracing change.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup! I wanted to be an engineer when I started college (daddy&#39;s little girl!). Switched<br/>
to information systems 2nd semester of my jr year (did not even know what this was <br/>
until I got to college). I worked 8 years as an info tech consultant and loved it<br/>
until I had kids. Quit to be home when Jason was 2. And now I am a hsing mom which <br/>
by far is the best job yet. If I ever go back to work it will NOT be as a consultant.<br/>
I would love to open my own rubber stamping store. Who knows?<br/>
