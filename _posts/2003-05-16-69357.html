<div id="ygrps-yiv-942802523">Good Morning Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
As you know, there have been much said regarding American Indians, racism.....well, you know how this has been.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me say this;  <br/>
<br/>
I have said &quot;I will not speak of this again&quot; <br/>
and I did.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize.<br/>
I would very much like to stay on this list.<br/>
Let us put this behind us.<br/>
<br/>
We all are here, on this list, because we want what&#39;s best for our children. We believe that unschooling is what&#39;s best.<br/>
<br/>
However, there will be differences of opinion; there will be mis-understandings; there will be words said that are misconstrued; mis-applied, mis-directed.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it is time to put this to bed.<br/>
<br/>
While racism is, sadly, still with us.<br/>
The point of this list is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the input. I will read and re-read this.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely apologize for any hurt feelings my words & my anger may have caused.<br/>
<br/>
Janis <br/>
