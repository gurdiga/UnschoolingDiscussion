 </span></blockquote>When they&#39;re going to give you a certificate you really need.<br/>
(first aid, CPR, ?)<br/>
<br/>
Group music (not quite &quot;classroom instruction,&quot; but choir/orchestra)<br/>
<br/>
Karate (not quite classroom but groups help)<br/>
<br/>
Marty liked the &quot;classes&quot; (presentations) at the junior police academy.<br/>
<br/>
Visiting artist doing a presentation (calligraphy, glass bead making, <br/>
seminar/workshop style &quot;class&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of those would work better with one-on-one, but sometimes there&#39;s no <br/>
opportunity other than special presentations.<br/>
<br/>
The talks at the unschooling conference were closer to &quot;classrooom <br/>
instruction&quot; than not, though I tried to make mine more like inspirational comedy.  It <br/>
would be more &#39;unschoolingish&#39;&#39; for people to hang around my family&#39;s regular <br/>
haunts and get to know us, but not everybody can.<br/>

When you WANT classroom instruction? <br/>
<br/>
I think that, if there is a desire, there is a benefit. If there&#39;s NO desire, <br/>
it&#39;s worthless.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t, right off, think of a circumstance when it would be MORE beneficial <br/>
to be in a classroom lecture. I think that things learned in a classroom can <br/>
ALL be learned better one-on-one or under a &quot;mentorship/apprenticeship&quot; or by <br/>
being in a situation with a more knowledgeable person. There are things that <br/>
are normally taught in classrooms (other than school stuff), like maybe karate <br/>
or something. But that can CERTAINLY be learned one-on-one! Sometimes there&#39;s <br/>
not another option---like driver&#39;s ed (first hand experience in that this week! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;), but it&#39;s still not as good as the REAL thing!<br/>

Roxana (15) just got home from her first &quot;costume design/history&quot; class at the local community college. She&#39;s THRILLED with it. The teacher came highly recommended as able to make historical times come alive. She told stories and showed slides and took them into a room filled with costumes and talked about them.<br/>
<br/>
I learned a lot!!! (Because Roxana didn&#39;t stop talking all the way home!!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775495907">This highlights one of the things about &quot;classroom instruction&quot; that can<br/>
be a positive - the use of facilities. For example the potter&#39;s wheels<br/>
and kiln at a ceramics workshop. Of course this is not the group based<br/>
instruction part of &quot;classroom&quot;. I feel that having access to the<br/>
&quot;hardware&quot; of technical facilities might part of why so many<br/>
homeschoolers enroll at community colleges, even when the &quot;software&quot; of<br/>
lectures/information are available in other forms. I guess we are back<br/>
at apprentice/mentor relationships again.<br/>

Sometimes a person doesn&#39;t have another &quot;in&quot; <br/>
or isn&#39;t sure she would be interested<br/>
without a toe-in-the-water.<br/>
<br/>
If a person can quit, the experience of formal-classroom is different too.<br/>
