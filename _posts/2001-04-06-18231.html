<div id="ygrps-yiv-928627733">So my daughters and I, almost 12 and almost 9, were at a baby shower <br/>
of a former co-worker of mine. We were sitting at a table with several <br/>
other former co-workers, as well. One of them asked my oldest daughter <br/>
how home schooling was going. So ... my oldest daughter says ...<br/>
  <br/>
&quot;Great. We just spent two days cleaning our rooms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh my! You can just imagine the looks I got!!!! But I just smiled.<br/>

<div><font size="4">We have seven children in this house and if I do not have a 
pick up time at least once a day, it is total chaos and nothing gets done. When 
the house is somewhat organized, I find they think of more creative things to 
do. Probably because the materials needed are easier to find. I think it really 
affects your mind to be in chaos.&nbsp;I try to have a place for every thing. Do 
they always put things back? No way but sometimes they do and it has been 
getting better over time. We have one day a week I expect everything to be 
cleaned and vaccuumed.&nbsp;Some of the children are realizing if they keep 
clean during the week, clean up day is not so bad. Some haven&#39;t figured it out 
yet.&nbsp;I think a lot of it is habits we can get into. There is no way my 
house could be clean all the time!</font></div>

 </span></blockquote>This is what I&#39;ve aimed for in the past, but I haven&#39;t been able to vac <br/>
since getting pg, though I&#39;m improving I don&#39;t think I could do the <br/>
whole house.  Also, I&#39;m still undecided whether to insist their room <br/>
gets done or not.  I don&#39;t have the energy to help them with tidying <br/>
either atm, or argue with them about it, or do it anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping to help them find ways to keep it clear, if they want it <br/>
clear, or reduce the stuff if they want to reduce the stuff, and if they <br/>
want it all over the floor then they&#39;re going to have to get used to <br/>
the idea that it might break or go in the vac, I guess.  But not <br/>
today...<br/>

<div><font size="4">I can identify. Pregnancy was the worst time for me to keep 
the house clean. I would get so big I couldn&#39;t even fit in most maternity 
clothes by the eighth month. Last baby was ten pounds! I don&#39;t do the pick up by 
myself. Everybody helps including the two year old. When i started doing it i 
got grumbling and complaining&nbsp;through the entire time, but when they 
finally realized this was the way it was, they get to it. sometimes they still 
complain, but I have learned to just let in in one ear and out the other. they 
still do the work. </font></div>
