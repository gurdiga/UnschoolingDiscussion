Which devices do you mean by this specifically?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We have four children aged 9, 7, 5 and just 3. We have one pc, two ipods and my phone (!) And one tv. No games console yet (finances). We were planning to buy ipads but now it&#39;s two laptops, one each for our eldest. We have been unschooling for a year now and mostly this has been enough (pc, tv were extremely limited before so anything was lapped up voraciously). It&#39;s only just recently our eldest daughter had asked for her own laptop because she wants to do &nbsp;something when someone else is on the computer. &nbsp;Lately, especially with minecraft, I have suggested one hour at a time so that everyone gets a turn... When the number of people far outweighs the number of devices I feel some sort of turn taking can be helpful. &nbsp;Our girls know there are plans to help meet their desire to do minecraft or search online or watch YouTube videos or whatever when we can afford it. They feel heard and validated (as in we don&#39;t say, no this is all there is or is ever going to be) and that helps.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style="font-size:9px;color:#575757;">Sent from my Samsung GALAXY Note3 on the Telstra 4G network</div></div></div><br><br><div>-------- Original message --------</div><div>From: &quot;Nicole Taylor ntmom3@...

<br/>
It&#39;s going to take a while for your kids to believe there will not be limits (maybe even years for the older ones).<br/>
<br/>
Build up their trust by demonstrating a big effort to make it work for them.  Think creatively about ways to acquire more options for them.  Let them know if you need time to save up, and then follow through and actually buy a couple things as soon as you can.  Get their advice about what would be best and most interesting for them.  Look for used gaming consoles, and search for cheap deals on tablets together.  <br/>
<br/>
If money is very limited, help your older kids brainstorm ways they can make money.  My kids do dog-walking for people who are gone all day.  This has led to pet-sitting jobs that pay pretty well!<br/>
<br/>
For right now while you don&#39;t have enough to go around, ask them to help you figure out what is a satisfying chunk of time for length of turns.  Partner with them instead of laying down a rule about turn-taking.   Help the ones who are waiting their turn to find other fun things to do.  Suggest interesting movies that many can watch together, serve fun snacks and be excited with them!<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183019719">I just bought a tablet (from 2011) with a pretty big screen and super <br/>
long battery for only 50 euro. My two year old can turn it on and start <br/>
movies all by himself - what a joy for him! Since we have it he is <br/>
rarely watching one full show - he is too happy changing movies all the <br/>
time :-) (and he mainly loves the opening music..).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My boys (2 and 6) like to watch different things in the same room and <br/>
both without headphones. So they have free access to the shows the other <br/>
one is watching and with more options now they watch more often and <br/>
especially more happily together.</div>

<div><font size="4">just getting more devices isn’t always straightforward! And 
not just because of your bank balance!</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">With the laptops we are going to buy, our eldest is extremely 
particular about exactly what she wants... a refurbished 13 inch Macbook Air 
from the Apple shop (not just any old place that sells reburbished stuff) (and 
we know what they cost... it will take the best part of 3-6 months to save for 
one at least – one of those is a lot of money for us). She does not want a cheap 
$400 laptop, nor even a refurbished from any other store than Apple.... she 
knows what she wants and we respect that. It just means saving and waiting.. so 
that means sharing for a lot longer than she would like to.. but that’s the 
choice and there it is.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Now, I could go on and on until the cows come home about all 
the logical practical arguments for buying second hand and how they work just 
the same, etc etc...&nbsp; Nope, she wants an Apple that you can make all pretty 
(as seen on Seven Super Girls who live in a lot flashier places than us). Once 
she’s made up her mind I can’t change it.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">So, yes, you could go out and access technology cheaply, and 
for most kids that’s cool. But not all kids. Some kids do lots of research and 
decide just what they want and some have expensive tastes (it seems). With 
access to research on our PC our daughter has access to all that’s available. We 
have also experienced cheap no-name type tablets and they’re very poor. The apps 
fell off, and eventually just broke within a year. I would spend the money and 
buy brand name technology now – but that’s obviously open for 
debate.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Just throwing that in as that is the process we are currently 
in. We have intentions to buy more so that’s all good with everyone... it’s the 
particulars of the “more” that is more involved than at first 
thought.</font></div>

<div><span>&quot;how do I let the games and screens be a choice, when there isn&#39;t

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The best thing you can do is try and get more :) If it was a shortage of 
books in relation to how much they were interested would you find a way to 
access more? Or science experiments? Try freegle, and eBay, and charity 
shops/thrift stores. You can pick up older model consoles for very little on 
eBay, and non-flatscreen TVs are given away almost daily on our local freegle, 
it&#39;s worth looking.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would also help to stop using the term screen time, and refer directly 
to what they&#39;re doing, as this could help you see the actual interest and the 
importance of it to them. Thinking of it all as screen time is a big step away 
from seeing the individual things directly :) <a rel="nofollow"

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Don&#39;t assume the two year old won&#39;t be interested, she might be! I know 
mine loves various games on her tablet and some on my phone, and really enjoys 
netflix and youtube too :)</div>

<div><font size="4">With the laptops we are going to buy, our eldest is extremely 
particular about exactly what she wants... a refurbished 13 inch Macbook Air 
from the Apple shop (not just any old place that sells reburbished stuff) (and 
we know what they cost... it will take the best part of 3-6 months to save for 
one at least – one of those is a lot of money for us). She does not want a cheap 
$400 laptop, nor even a refurbished from any other store than Apple.... she 
knows what she wants and we respect that. It just means saving and waiting.. so 
that means sharing for a lot longer than she would like to.. but that’s the 
choice and there it is.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Now, I could go on and on until the cows come home about all 
the logical practical arguments for buying second hand and how they work just 
the same, etc etc...&nbsp; Nope, she wants an Apple that you can make all pretty 
(as seen on Seven Super Girls who live in a lot flashier places than us). Once 
she’s made up her mind I can’t change it.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">So, yes, you could go out and access technology cheaply, and 
for most kids that’s cool. But not all kids. Some kids do lots of research and 
decide just what they want and some have expensive tastes (it seems). With 
access to research on our PC our daughter has access to all that’s available. We 
have also experienced cheap no-name type tablets and they’re very poor. The apps 
fell off, and eventually just broke within a year. I would spend the money and 
buy brand name technology now – but that’s obviously open for 
debate.</font></div>

<div><font size="4">Just throwing that in as that is the process we are currently 
in. We have intentions to buy more so that’s all good with everyone... it’s the 
particulars of the “more” that is more involved than at first

enough for everyone?&quot;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The best thing you can do is try and get more :) If it was a shortage of 
books in relation to how much they were interested would you find a way to 
access more? Or science experiments? Try freegle, and eBay, and charity 
shops/thrift stores. You can pick up older model consoles for very little on 
eBay, and non-flatscreen TVs are given away almost daily on our local freegle, 
it&#39;s worth looking.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would also help to stop using the term screen time, and refer directly 
to what they&#39;re doing, as this could help you see the actual interest and the 
importance of it to them. Thinking of it all as screen time is a big step away 
from seeing the individual things directly :) <a rel="nofollow" shape="rect" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/screentime/">http://sandradodd.com/screentime/</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Don&#39;t assume the two year old won&#39;t be interested, she might be! I know 
mine loves various games on her tablet and some on my phone, and really enjoys 
netflix and youtube too :)</div>

<div dir='ltr'>So sad about Monty Oum, Alex.<div><br></div><div>And yes - we got Kai a $350 laptop last year, and it&#39;s been amazing. It was cheap because it was a discontinued model, it had a dedicated graphics card, and up to now has played all the Steam games, Minecraft, etc with heavy graphics that he&#39;s wanted. If you look around, and know what specs you want (processor, graphics &nbsp;card, etc) you can get amazing deals.<br><br>Kai has also saved for things - Christmas and birthday money, sold old toys (with my help), saved his monthly allowance up...<br><br>For a household with lots of kids who are currently feeling limited, second-hand Xbox 360&#39;s, PS 3&#39;s, old-style Wii&#39;s are easy to come by and relatively cheap (I understand &#39;cheap&#39; is different for all families though). Local Facebook buy, sell, swap groups are great for those - a lot of people sell bundles with a console and a pile of games too for pretty cheap. People are giving away the old-style boxy-TV&#39;s on facebook and on freecycle all the time.<br><br>As others have said - if kids were at school, or you were doing school-at-home, you might be buying loads of expensive uniforms, expensive text-books, curriculums, online subscriptions.....In our home gaming is a priority - we don&#39;t have a lot of money, and sometimes we need to wait to buy stuff, but we make the time and effort to research, to shop around, to save, and to figure out how we can get what we want :)<br><br>Jo<br><br><br><br><div><hr id="ygrps-yiv-1005876919stopSpelling">To: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br>From: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br>Date: Thu, 5 Feb 2015 04:30:47 +0000<br>Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Gaming and Screen Time<br><br>

<div><font size="4">With the laptops we are going to buy, our eldest is extremely 
particular about exactly what she wants... a refurbished 13 inch Macbook Air 
from the Apple shop (not just any old place that sells reburbished stuff) (and 
we know what they cost... it will take the best part of 3-6 months to save for 
one at least – one of those is a lot of money for us). She does not want a cheap 
$400 laptop, nor even a refurbished from any other store than Apple.... she 
knows what she wants and we respect that. It just means saving and waiting.. so 
that means sharing for a lot longer than she would like to.. but that’s the 
choice and there it is.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Now, I could go on and on until the cows come home about all 
the logical practical arguments for buying second hand and how they work just 
the same, etc etc...&nbsp; Nope, she wants an Apple that you can make all pretty 
(as seen on Seven Super Girls who live in a lot flashier places than us). Once 
she’s made up her mind I can’t change it.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">So, yes, you could go out and access technology cheaply, and 
for most kids that’s cool. But not all kids. Some kids do lots of research and 
decide just what they want and some have expensive tastes (it seems). With 
access to research on our PC our daughter has access to all that’s available. We 
have also experienced cheap no-name type tablets and they’re very poor. The apps 
fell off, and eventually just broke within a year. I would spend the money and 
buy brand name technology now – but that’s obviously open for 
debate.</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Just throwing that in as that is the process we are currently 
in. We have intentions to buy more so that’s all good with everyone... it’s the 
particulars of the “more” that is more involved than at first 
thought.</font></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The best thing you can do is try and get more :) If it was a shortage of 
books in relation to how much they were interested would you find a way to 
access more? Or science experiments? Try freegle, and eBay, and charity 
shops/thrift stores. You can pick up older model consoles for very little on 
eBay, and non-flatscreen TVs are given away almost daily on our local freegle, 
it&#39;s worth looking.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would also help to stop using the term screen time, and refer directly 
to what they&#39;re doing, as this could help you see the actual interest and the 
importance of it to them. Thinking of it all as screen time is a big step away 
from seeing the individual things directly :) <a rel="nofollow" shape="rect" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/screentime/">http://sandradodd.com/screentime/</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Don&#39;t assume the two year old won&#39;t be interested, she might be! I know 
mine loves various games on her tablet and some on my phone, and really enjoys 
netflix and youtube too :)</div>
