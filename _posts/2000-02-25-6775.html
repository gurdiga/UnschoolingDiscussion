<div id="ygrps-yiv-249007397">North Carolina has gotten ridiculously obsessed with standardized<br/>
testing over the last two years.  We&#39;ve begun rewarding both schools and<br/>
teachers whose kids test above average on these tests.  So, as you can<br/>
imagine, everything that kids learn here from K to 3rd is geared to help<br/>
them take the test.  So . . . a friend of mine recently told me that her<br/>
son, who is in kindergarten, had been given an IQ test and behavior test<br/>
at school without her consent .  Then, they called my friend in and told<br/>
her they believed her son might benefit from Ritalin.  When she asked<br/>
what his exact problems in class were, the teacher explained that he<br/>
wasn&#39;t sitting still during group time and wasn&#39;t filling out his<br/>
worksheets completely.  My friend asked whether this was really a<br/>
problem in KINDERGARTEN, and the teacher said yes, that if he didn&#39;t get<br/>
a grip on his &quot;ADD&quot; that he might not do well on his 3rd grade<br/>
standardized test.  Things like that really make me want to scream!<br/>
