&gt; There are some salvia&#39;s that bloom blue that have interesting fragrance. .<br/>
&gt; .There is an Anise Salvia. . .I think the botantical name is Salvia<br/>
gurantica<br/>
&gt; (not sure of spelling but its very close to that). My personal favortie<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; be Indigo Spires but for the life of me I cannot remember the botanical<br/>
name<br/>
&gt; on that one. I know I will think of more later. . . very much in a rush<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; morning. . oops, afternoon!!<br/>

That me me grin, lol. We hear parents quoting what their kids are saying<br/>
often and it doesnt *sound* like the language my kid uses ordinarily. Makes<br/>
me wonder. But then, when you posted this. Well, THAT sounds familiar!<br/>
