into Chinese culture and named her Mei-Lei (sp?). <br/>
<br/>
Of course, now they are in Texas, so I&#39;m guessing many people don&#39;t <br/>
think &quot;May Lee&quot; sounds unusual!!<br/>

<br/>
My guess would be her name was four or five syllables, pretty much <br/>
unpronounceable, and she shortened it for American use.   Having spent a lot of time <br/>
with a &quot;Nimi&quot; and years before that with a Dev, knowing that I never did learn to <br/>
say &quot;Nirmala&quot; or &quot;Devender&quot; the way they did.  The r&#39;s are pronounced in a <br/>
way that even Spanish speakers can&#39;t approach, and what doesn&#39;t show in <br/>
&quot;Devender&quot; is that the last syllable goes &quot;dre.&quot;  The spellings in English only kind <br/>
of come close to what the names are like &quot;live.&quot;  The vowels are unlike ours <br/>
too.  Dipthongs we don&#39;t have.<br/>
