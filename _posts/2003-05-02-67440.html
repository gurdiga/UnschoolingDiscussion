 </span></blockquote>Ah, but we are a conformist society of loners.  We are supposed to be<br/>
independant, self motivated and self directed at all times.  We are supposed<br/>
to be self directed towards the same basic capitalist goals, but......<br/>
<br/>
When we are actual individuals--self directed towards something outside the<br/>
&quot;norm&quot; then we get nailed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think we&#39;re both. :-) I think we want to be individualists but we have to<br/>
pass through 12+ years of conformism in order to get old enough to be<br/>
allowed to. By then it&#39;s too late for most people to be themselves easily.<br/>
:-/<br/>
<br/>
Even educators, I don&#39;t think, want kids to lose their individuality. They<br/>
want kids to conform in order to do what they have to to learn. Just as<br/>
people conform to wait in lines and such. And then educators want the kids<br/>
to be free to be themselves. As long as they don&#39;t step outside the<br/>
proprieties of school rules.<br/>
<br/>
Unforunately, of course, they can&#39;t see the huge effect the society of<br/>
school and homework and everything has on kids. It&#39;s all normal life to most<br/>
educators. It&#39;s a joke when teachers talk about homeschoolers keeping their<br/>
kids away from real life. They really do beleive that school is real life.<br/>
And that kids can be themselves there.<br/>
