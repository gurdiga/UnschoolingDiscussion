<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll take that bet . . . because I can do it in reverse.  Like I said -<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been unschooling for 6 years.  I had in that time two major<br/>
&gt; illnesses.  My son has had two opportunities to watch as much as he wants<br/>
&gt; for more than a year each time.  And the result is that he watches more<br/>
&gt; and more and more and more, just like a heroin addict does more heroin.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What were his other options at the time? Who was around to do interesting<br/>
things with him, go interesting places, offer interesting thoughts and ideas<br/>
and projects? What were the people around him doing at the time to pursue<br/>
their OWN interests, so that he could see that, want to get involved, and<br/>
draw inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
Television is better than staring at a wall.<br/>
<br/>
If your son truly has an addictive personality, the issue isn&#39;t television,<br/>
it&#39;s addiction and hopefully he&#39;s getting some counseling and other help on<br/>
that (I don&#39;t know if he was the one you mentioned already as being on<br/>
medication).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653194247">Hi<br/>
<br/>
My son watches more movies (satelite got zapped by<br/>
lightening...fortunately in my opinion....I would<br/>
probably have sabotaged it myself eventually) when he<br/>
is lonesome or is avoiding dealing (immediately)with<br/>
something he is uncomfortable with. Mama with a major <br/>
illness or two would fit both of those (sometimes)<br/>
prerequisites.....doesn&#39;t seem addictive to me, just<br/>
what is available without getting into too much<br/>
trouble. Sort of a tide-me-over. <br/>
<br/>
Sure hope you are feeling better!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, we didn&#39;t get PBS on this TV set-up anyway.  I<br/>
do miss that from &quot;before&quot; satelite and moving to this<br/>
area where we only recieve one channel.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well let&#39;s see, at the time of the second one he had his two older<br/>
sisters who could roam the neighborhood and parks, and sledding hill when<br/>
it snowed and take him too if he would go.  He had a houseful of craft<br/>
supplies, books, games and building toys.  He had two computers and a<br/>
slew of games he loves now.  And what he did was watch TV all day,<br/>
everyday.    <br/>

is.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah yes, but had that been the case, the TV watching would have stopped<br/>
when I got healthy (well relatively speaking.)<br/>
But the TV watching just kept intensifying until I stepped in and said<br/>
that when I say it&#39;s time to stop, it&#39;s time to stop.  It isn&#39;t some set<br/>
in stone time either.  A lot depends on what else is going on but<br/>
generally he can watch TV in the morning, annd in the afternoon when his<br/>
favorites are on and I make him turn it off when I know he is just<br/>
watching to have it on.  It took a while to learn the difference but I<br/>
think I have his habits pegged pretty well now.<br/>

package which includes PBS<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m on a satellite system and I pay a little extra each month<br/>
