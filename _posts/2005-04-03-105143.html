I knew a  woman who was born into a family of six kids.  The first three had  <br/>
been born in England post WWII, during heavy food rationing.  The  second <br/>
three were born in the US in the 1950s and were six inches taller  than the <br/>
older siblings.<br/>

Ah!<br/>
Then maybe the plagues and wars and such things in Europe could make  a <br/>
difference, too--not only in food availability but in general &quot;failure to  thrive&quot; <br/>
ways.  People probably don&#39;t enjoy the best possible digestive  health when <br/>
they&#39;re sick, grieving and terrified.   <br/>

the middle ages reduced the growing season by as much as a month in <br/>
some areas. Food production was dramatically decreased in the more <br/>
northern areas, including England.<br/>

Here&#39;s an interesting article on studies of skeletal heights from <br/>
different eras in European history: <br/>
