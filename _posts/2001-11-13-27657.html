<br/>
Although I&#39;m sorry that some people&#39;s mailers repeat the post to which <br/>
they&#39;re replying, and some people are using formatting so the whole message <br/>
gets repeated twice on some mailers, it&#39;s also a problem when the subject <br/>
line is &quot;Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number whatever&quot; because those who <br/>
are reading by topics don&#39;t know which one&#39;s being addressed.  <br/>
<br/>
The list can&#39;t be perfect for everybody, and maybe can&#39;t be perfect for <br/>
anybody, but if digests seem best for you, please put something in the <br/>
subject line for the rest of us!  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
