<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guten morgen!  Yes, we had a great experience living in Germany.  I was there <br/>
for about 6 mos, as it was the end of dh&#39;s tour there.  We lived in a tiny <br/>
town called <br/>
Planig.  We lived on the &quot;economy&quot;, to experience the culture instead of <br/>
living on base.  We had German landlords, and it was wonderful getting to <br/>
know them.  The army base was nearby in a city known as Bad Kreuznach.  This <br/>
is about an hour south west of Frankfurt.  It was fun to shop alongside the <br/>
locals... all the markets and outdoor cafes were exhilarating!  It did rain <br/>
quite a bit, so it was common to dress in layers, and take along your <br/>
umbrella,and shopping basket each time you went out.  I don&#39;t drink beer <br/>
either, but the bier gartens were still a great time!  It was a hoot to see <br/>
men and women dancing the &quot;chicken dance&quot;  (they called it the duck dance), <br/>
and some thought nothing of dancing on top of the tables!  :)  They opened a <br/>
Kentucky Fried Chicken  while we were there...  and served french fries with <br/>
little , tiny forks to eat with-- no finger eating!  :)  They also served <br/>
soft drinks warm, unless you request it to be cold-- my dh thought that was <br/>
so gross!  Funny thing, too, is that it is perfectly ok to bring your lap dog <br/>
with you shopping and into restaurants.  Many of these dogs would ride in <br/>
large purse-like bags.  It was a great experience, overall, and one that I am <br/>
glad to have had!  I especially enjoyed the architecture of the half-timber <br/>
homes, and when we built our home, we fashioned it after those in Germany, <br/>
including the window boxes, which I love!  Well, sorry to have gone on and <br/>
on; writing about it brought back such good memories!  :)  Guten tag!  ~Karen</div>
