&lt;&lt; I was so glad to read my email to see that I&#39;m not alone. After watching <br/>
ER <br/>
 last night, was sooooo annoyed. There are two sides to the story, but they <br/>
 certainly didn&#39;t show it. They made the mother look stupid, and the doctors <br/>
 were completely rude and insensitive. My kids are partially vaccinated, and <br/>
I <br/>
 still couldn&#39;t get over the stupid show. It was nothing but a commerical for <br/>
 vaccinations. Ugh. I emailed NBC to share my thoughts. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do vaccinate my kids, particularly since we travel overseas a lot, but that <br/>
show pissed me off. Even more infuriating were the commercials pushing the <br/>
latest vaccine. I have seen the same one run during many other programs. I <br/>
will not let my kids have any more new vaccines, or medications, or <br/>
treatments, unless they are already on the brink of death.<br/>
<br/>
When my youngest was an infant, I trusted my doctor instead of doing the <br/>
research myself. I let my daughter have a new vaccine to prevent something <br/>
for which she was never at risk. A few months later, I read a Wall Street <br/>
Journal article describing how the vaccine had been pulled because several <br/>
children in China had died a most gruesome death after receiving it, and <br/>
children elsewhere had suffered intestinal blockages and the accompanying <br/>
complications. I blamed my lack of investigation on the depression I was <br/>
suffering at the time. Would have been a lot more difficult to do if my child <br/>
had been the one to die.<br/>
