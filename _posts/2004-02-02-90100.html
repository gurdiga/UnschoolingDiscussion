sixthgrade; he watched TV all day and all night. He ate, slept, and talked on the <br/>
&#39;phone, too. But mostly he just watched TV. <br/>
<br/>
One day I overheard him talking with a schooled friend (who was/is *totally* <br/>
brainwashed into believing school is the *only* way to success). Noah said <br/>
that, if he were being homeschooled like Cameron----where he could do anything he <br/>
wanted all day, he would just watch TV ALL DAY!  <br/>
<br/>
Cameron laughed and said, &quot;TV all day gets old, dude! It&#39;s the same stuff <br/>
over and over!&quot;<br/>
