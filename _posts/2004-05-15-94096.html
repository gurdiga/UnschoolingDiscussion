<br/>
ONE OF MY FAVORITES!<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I were babysitting a baby, and I didn&#39;t realize last week was the <br/>
last week (for a while) or I would have smelled her head LOTS more and taken <br/>
photos.  When we have her again she&#39;ll be months bigger.<br/>
<br/>
But smelling the heads of young chidren is a magical kind of mom-drug, and <br/>
after people aren&#39;t nursing anymore, so they&#39;re not getting the hormonal <br/>
benefits of being nursing mothers, I think smelling kids&#39; heads is a good fix.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand the biochemistry involved at all, but I highly recommend <br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425805468">My youngest dd is 9, and I still love smelling her hair when she gives me <br/>
hugs. She still smells like a baby to me, especially after a hug from my musky <br/>
teen son. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180301520">my dh always swears by the ole head smelling fix. He claims when all of our children were born, he smelled the tops of their heads and he knew them. It&#39;s a totally spiritual thing for us, our three year old still has that magic smell sometimes. Kelli<br/>

My son is already 3 and since he sleeps with us I smell his head every night. &lt;BWG&gt;  I love it.  People are all the time telling us we shouldn&#39;t have let him in our bed, but I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.  He is going to be grown soon enough.<br/>

The character speaking is a man, and the daughter is a young woman.  In the<br/>
story, the daughter believes another man is her father and that this man,<br/>
her birth father, is only a friend of her parents.  This is their first<br/>
meeting in person.  The author is a woman, though.<br/>
