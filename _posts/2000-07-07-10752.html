 </span></blockquote>Hi Amy, I noticed you are going to try giving up white flour products.  When <br/>
I gave them up, I was stunned how many things had  white flour in them.  I <br/>
have had to find whole wheat pastas and crackers.  Also, corn is a common <br/>
allergen, too.  I hated to give up the corn chips, but they had to go.  Are <br/>
you noticing any changes in your asthmatic symptoms?  If not, try to be <br/>
patient as your system is adapting to the changes in the diet.  It is not <br/>
unusual to feel worse before  better; but, I hope you are feeling better. <br/>

<br/>
not much yet. hpoefully i will soon. i went for my one week follow up with<br/>
my doc. yesterday  and was given my long term regimen. azmacort morn. and<br/>
night and albuterol for my rescue inhaler. i was also given my green, yellow<br/>
and red zones. i haven&#39;t hit green yet, but she said 4-5 weeks with the<br/>
azmacort should do it. i also haven&#39;t been in red yet (good thing). this is<br/>
based on peak flow readings i&#39;d done this past week. she said eventually, i<br/>
should feel so good, that i&#39;ll have to call her if i&#39;m in yellow. can&#39;t<br/>
imagine how nice it will be to presumably feel that good daily. i know the<br/>
diff. going fom low yellow to high yellow.<br/>
