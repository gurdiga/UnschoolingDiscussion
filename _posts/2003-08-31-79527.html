<div id="ygrps-yiv-82412754">**However, what about these adults who have never learned? If reading is <br/>
picked up freely, without lessons, why would some get to adulthood unable to read? <br/>
Pressure? Wrong teaching methods (the phonics lady&#39;s answer, btw.)? This <br/>
woman was hesitant to use labels...she wasn&#39;twilling to accept &quot;dyslexia&quot; as a <br/>
common problem, believing that phonics instruction would eliminate 99% of <br/>
&quot;dyslexia&quot; problems.**<br/>
<br/>
**It&#39;s because they&#39;re stuck in school! School is one of the most <br/>
intellectually sterile environments there is. There is no one-on-one, no real life <br/>
reading opportunities and no stimulation. Even phonics can fail in the classroom.**<br/>
 <br/>
Even in the very best schools, with real life reading opportunities, <br/>
one-on-one reading together time, exciting environments, children fail to learn to <br/>
read and get placed on the endless remediation treadmill.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest reason there are adult nonreaders and limited ability readers is <br/>
the school timetable. Kids who don&#39;t learn to read &quot;on schedule&quot; quickly <br/>
become convinced that they are stupid or defective, and from that point on only the <br/>
most determined and strong will ever learn to read well. The rest adopt a <br/>
variety of protective strategies - they learn to fake it, they learn to not let <br/>
people know they care, they learn to act as if reading and everything to do <br/>
with reading is stupid and not worth their time. But once identified as problem <br/>
readers, they rarely learn to read well.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are supported and nurtured in a belief that reading will come in <br/>
it&#39;s own good time don&#39;t have to fight against the fear and phobias induced by <br/>
not reading &quot;on time&quot; that schools supply so well to their students.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah finally read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone this week. She <br/>
started it on Thursday last week, in our hotel room in Columbia, she finished it <br/>
yesterday. She&#39;s started that book many times over the years, putting it down in <br/>
frustration each time. (They really are hard books for a not fluent reader, <br/>
who has to try to figure out for each unfamiliar word if they&#39;re not getting it <br/>
because it&#39;s a made up word, or if it&#39;s a word they might know after all.) <br/>
Each time I put it up on top of the shelf and reassured her that Harry would be <br/>
there when she was ready, no hurry. I&#39;ve written before of her struggles with <br/>
reading, how much she wanted to read for so many years and how she was utterly <br/>
unable to get past a very few very familiar words in spite of much effort. <br/>
She is now well and truly &quot;a reader&quot; - able to read everything she wants to <br/>
read, in all situations. <br/>
<br/>
She is 11 1/2 years old. Were she in school she would be going into sixth <br/>
grade, and I am certain she would not be a reader. She is a very sensitive girl - <br/>
the school processes that would have attempted to help her with her problems <br/>
hearing and separating sounds would have utterly convinced her she was stupid <br/>
forevermore, and I would have been unable to do enough to undo that damage in <br/>
her hours outside of school. She&#39;s a smart girl, though. She&#39;d have learned to <br/>
fake it.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky for her we were unschoolers before she was born. Lucky for all of us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is where some backbone on my part would have come in pretty <br/>
handy. I could have just said...actually, I did give it a bit of an <br/>
attempt...&quot;I&#39;m simply not panicking about it. Katie knows her <br/>
phonics, and can sound out her letters and writes (very) well...GOOD <br/>
handwriting...but she was a late speaker, so I&#39;m simply not going to <br/>
panic about it, thanks anyway...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
but I&#39;m a wimp. I put in a feeble attempt at pointing out some of <br/>
these things. In a world where HeidiC has the courage of her <br/>
convictions, I would have pointed out the research *I* have done on <br/>
it, that tells me kids who read late are just as proficient readers <br/>
in adulthood, as those who start early. I would have questioned the <br/>
system that produces adult illiteracy (and gotten a lot of agreement <br/>
from Phonics Lady, but hers was &quot;Because they don&#39;t use phonics in <br/>
school&quot;...never any question that making sure they are reading well <br/>
by the end of third grade might be part of the problem...<br/>
<br/>
well anyway. I figured that was the reason why there are some who <br/>
make it to adulthood unable to read: they&#39;re put into the box, and <br/>
when they don&#39;t fit, they are made to feel inadequate, start <br/>
stressing over it, setting themselves up for those defense mechanisms <br/>
you mention. I&#39;m so glad I&#39;ve protected Katie from so much of that, <br/>
but pretty frustrated at these well-meaning friends and relations who <br/>
want to put their panic on Katie...ticks me off, actually...<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the input. Back to watching as reading starts clicking for <br/>
my girl! :)<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, HeidiC</div>
