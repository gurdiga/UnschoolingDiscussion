<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752278139">HI all -<br/>
We built our house a few years back.  We have a lot of not so good  drywall <br/>
seams (just where it wasn&#39;t sanded down enough) places where stuff  didnt&#39; <br/>
match up perfectly, ripples, etc.  We also have a lot of trim that  never got put <br/>
up.<br/>
 <br/>
We went to Disneyworld over the holidays, and I got so inspired by stuff  <br/>
like the &quot;tree of life&quot; in the animal kingdom, and just all the sculpture and  <br/>
art incorporated into all the buildings...even little things like dining huts  <br/>
had the coolest designs.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyhow, a couple of the kids and I were thinking how cool it would be to  <br/>
fill in a lot of our gaps and mistakes around the house with stuff like sculpted  <br/>
trees, snakes, waves, plants,...anything really.  But we&#39;re not sure what  <br/>
type of stuff we&#39;d use to do that.  What could we get in a huge amount that  <br/>
could be molded, sculpted, squished into cracks and corners, and stick to the  <br/>
walls?  Any ideas?  I know all that stuff at Disneyworld wasn&#39;t carved  out of <br/>
wood.  Does anyone know a type of clay or something like it would  work?  Has <br/>
anyone done stuff like this at their home?  We&#39;ve done  murals before, but not <br/>
3 dimensional. <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks -<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
You could use sheetrock mud.  You probably still have some of it  sitting <br/>
around.  But I&#39;d buy the dry stuff so I could mix it a little  stiffer than it <br/>
comes in the bucket.  <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s probably what I would use.  If you don&#39;t like a particular  piece, you <br/>
can still scrape it off before you paint it.  If you&#39;re doing it  on the <br/>
wall, don&#39;t make anything too thick, because it may start to droop.  <br/>
 <br/>
And wear gloves, because that stuff is not good for your skin.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d probably also use a variety of things...sculpy, clay, paper mache  (white <br/>
glue and newspaper--what could be cheaper?).  I&#39;d probably make some  things <br/>
on the table and glue them up later, too.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sounds like fun!  Wish I had a space to do that in.<br/>

What a great idea! I am wondering if you couldn&#39;t just<br/>
use dry wall mud to form and sculpt with. Then paint<br/>
and seal over it.<br/>
We also have a house that we built still awaiting trim<br/>
and windows being boxed out etc. , well and some doors<br/>
and some floors. <br/>
Good luck<br/>

Just regular styrofoam, like in an ice chest you buy at the gas station,  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do though. You&#39;d need that high-density stuff, which can get spendy,  <br/>
I&#39;ll bet.<br/>

The stuff that comes with stereo components or TV&#39;s, etc, is pretty thick  <br/>
and heavy.  We just got rid of a bunch of it!  Ugh.  <br/>
 <br/>
I know that dumpster diving is one of the best places to get styrofoam...we  <br/>
sell on ebay, and NEVER buy packaging supplies, we just dive for it.  I&#39;ll  <br/>
have to keep a look out for it. <br/>
 <br/>
Styrofoam is such a good idea, I hadn&#39;t thought of that.  Concrete or  <br/>
something solid would be so heavy.  Our house is built on blocks, up off  the <br/>
ground.  Something too heavy might mess with the stability.<br/>
 <br/>
Are there any architects on this list?  :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry I missed the original post - speaking as a Production Designer/Set<br/>
Decorator most of the uses of Styrofoam is for indoor sets. Usually the<br/>
stuff is sprayed in a semi-liquid form over the superstructure made of<br/>
lumber or steel framing for special purposes (or large chunks of the<br/>
Styrofoam for major depth). It generally sticks by itself by virtue of being<br/>
sprayed on. The surfaces are then fine sculpted if necessary, usually using<br/>
a heated wire device for a smooth surface, before a sealer coat and then the<br/>
scenic art begins. <br/>
<br/>
Another interior decorating technique used a *lot* in cinema and related<br/>
industries is vacuum forming of molded shapes in plastic - including what<br/>
you would take to be plaster or wood architectural details - again followed<br/>
by scenic artistry. Anyone can contract a prop manufacturer or one of the<br/>
Studio set construction departments to make them quantities of architectural<br/>
fixtures in vacuum form, provided they are willing to pay, of course. More<br/>
companies are offering dense plastic/soft foam items like molding or<br/>
paneling for purchase, that is nonetheless flexible.<br/>
<br/>
The exterior stuff at Disney is more likely to be a concrete concoction,<br/>
similar to what is used by prop/scenic manufacturing companies. They use<br/>
enormous moulds with tinted concrete for these large creations. Designing<br/>
the molds is a whole job in itself, part of the Set Design position - which<br/>
in movie credits refers to a draftsperson who creates working drawings,<br/>
plans and elevations of elements to be constructed, including an awareness<br/>
of the engineering needed.<br/>
<br/>
There is a material, formerly called Sculpt-on-coat but it seems to have<br/>
changed its name, that is a gel like plastic molding material that air dries<br/>
hard enough to drill or saw. There is also a liquid that you dip fabric into<br/>
that upon drying becomes rock hard, sometimes enough to support a person<br/>
depending on the shape.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, one of the main uses of hot glue in the industry, is for the<br/>
manufacture of cobwebs. There is a machine that heats the sticks and then<br/>
shoots out (with hot air) the liquefied hot glue to create great swathes of<br/>
hanging web, on to which dust (usually fuller&#39;s earth) will then be blown if<br/>
the desired effect is of old webs. The glue gives them that stretchy yet<br/>
sticky effect when people go pushing through them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125222387">I have used foam for set designing, and I also had a<br/>
taxidermist friend that used it for animal bodies<br/>
(EW!) and also for sets for the animals to be mounted<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193275814">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
In a previous house we built (So AZ) we had earthen plaster walls on<br/>
the bale walls and wanted something to blend with that texture on the<br/>
drywall walls.  i<br/>
used dry wall mud (not real mud as I don&#39;t think it will adhere to a<br/>
surface which has latex on it)and added sand and actually thinned it a<br/>
bit and brushed it on the walls-then painted.  You can use whatever<br/>
size sand gives the texture you want.  I also did some sculpture on<br/>
the earthen plaster walls but would think you could do this with<br/>
drywall mud  as the previous poster said-just play until you get the<br/>
consistency you want. I you&#39;re &quot;building out&quot; for a raised effect you<br/>
will most likely need to add something to act as a binder, i used<br/>
finely chopped straw with the mud and that may work with dry wall mud.<br/>
i&#39;m including a few links with examples for inspiration-great fun for<br/>
the kids. But it<br/>
will be verrrry messy.<br/>
