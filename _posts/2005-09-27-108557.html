<div id="ygrps-yiv-392737305">Does anyone remember who recommended I use the background art from this page<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/HippieShirt">http://sandradodd.com/HippieShirt</a><br/>
as book cover art?<br/>
<br/>
Because I did. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And I wanted to thank that person.<br/>
<br/>
The book&#39;s not yet for public consumption.   I&#39;m still waiting for a copy to <br/>
see if my corrections were sufficient to save me from shame (and if my <br/>
attempts to fix a few formatting glitches were successful).   The cover, though, is <br/>
here:<br/>

<br/>
and links to how to order might eventually be as well.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, buy Rue&#39;s book!<br/>
