&lt;&lt; The whole &quot;sounding like Dr. Laura&quot; thing... &gt;&gt;<br/>
Ok,  sorry to be a dunce, but I don&#39;t know who this is!  Here it is, Sat. <br/>
night, and  I have been gone all day, and have just gone through the posts <br/>
regarding feminism/daycare.  I have been on this list since late March.  This <br/>
is not the first time a heated discussion has taken place....one of the last <br/>
&quot;biggies&quot; was about nursing vs bottle feeding.  It went on for what seemed <br/>
like about 2 weeks.It was filled with emotion, and passion, facts, and <br/>
opinions, much like this topic is.  It is my hope that everyone can agree to <br/>
disagree, and move on.  Pris, I really enjoy your posts.  It would be sad to <br/>
lose you due to a topic that will run its course in a matter of time.  I hope <br/>
that you, and everyone else, will stay on.    There are so many points I <br/>
agree and disagree with from the posts, but, ultimately, I think what matters <br/>
most is doing what is right for each of our families to the best of our <br/>
abilities.~ Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548153461">Dr. Laura is the biggest hypocrit to ever get a talk show!  She is also the<br/>
rudest person, well maybe Stern is ruder but not by much.  She also spouts<br/>

her show that the young man in Texas was responsible for his own death<br/>

Hi --- If you do a search under Dr Laura you will get her web site and some <br/>
people who think she&#39;s not so peachy.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a radio talk-show, shock-jock type who seems, to me, to be making a <br/>
very good living ticking off a great segment of the parents in America -- <br/>
along with anyone who is gay or is in any way different from her.<br/>
<br/>
Just a barrel of laughs!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255752456">Well, to be exact, I&#39;ve never called my kids worthless little mf&#39;ers.  That<br/>
is just one incident, there are many, many more that have been documented<br/>
but I didn&#39;t think I needed to write a book, I just included one of her<br/>
nastier moments that happened to get caught on tape.  And, if I had my<br/>
children at work, I certainly wouldn&#39;t berate them in front of all my<br/>
employees, either.<br/>
<br/>
While screaming about divorced folks, she neglects to mention hubby&#39;s<br/>
divorce.  She also never mentions her stepchildren.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also a religous bigot.  Oh, and did I mention an expert on all<br/>
religions that she has never heard of.<br/>
<br/>
The list goes on and on.  She actually makes Rush and Falwell look good!<br/>

<br/>
Now I know who she is (LOL)....  I have listened to her and never heard her <br/>
mention his divorce, her step children... She would probably have a reason <br/>
such as &quot;this show is about other people not me&quot;  But then the only reason <br/>
she has a show is because of her personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
The religious bit gets me too... I&#39;m very spiritual but not religious.  What <br/>
I&#39;ve heard her say that annoys me is that if you chose to not circumsize your <br/>
boys, then you are fighting the Jews.  There is no medical proof that there <br/>
is any reason to do so.  It&#39;s a custom and a cultural thing in the USA.   <br/>
Most of Europe doesn&#39;t mutilate their boys and we don&#39;t have a higher degree <br/>
of any kind of cancer or any other higher cases of other diseases.  When I <br/>
was having Zak I was in England living on an American Airforce Base and I <br/>
checked with both countries research and many many organizations.  Even the <br/>
doctors who were present at the birth of my friend&#39;s baby said to me in the <br/>
delivery room &quot;well there&#39;s really no need to do it, but men like it done <br/>
because it makes men and their sons look the same&quot;.  When I asked my husband <br/>
how often he looks at another man&#39;s penis and if that&#39;s normal practice he <br/>
laughed and said most men avoid looking at each other in the bathrooms and <br/>
certainly don&#39;t stare at each others body parts... Anyway I digress....  The <br/>
point is... I heard her say that anyone who didn&#39;t circumsize their boys was <br/>
just looking for a way to oppress the Jews.... I never realized until I came <br/>
to America that religion was such a big deal in this country so I guess <br/>
that&#39;s the sort of comment I could expect from her.  I think it&#39;s great that <br/>
there are tons of religions and that people have something to believe in, if <br/>
it works for them...  But supressing the Jews..... I think she ought to get <br/>
her medical facts right first before coming up with that one.<br/>
