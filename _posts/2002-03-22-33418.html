<div id="ygrps-yiv-34583075">When my first daughter was 14 I gave her the option of<br/>
beginning on GED materials and programs and quit the<br/>
little bit of pushing I had done previously to keep<br/>
her somewhat caught up on the subjects she didn&#39;t like<br/>
(mainly math).  She thought it was a good idea because<br/>
she wanted to try college and also wanted to be able<br/>
to show on paper that she had learned something.  We<br/>
still did other things together, and she decided when<br/>
and how much to study.  I taped the PBS GED programs<br/>
for her.  At sixteen she started her first job.  At<br/>
seventeen she was allowed to take GED pre-tests at the<br/>
local high school.  After seeing her scores, the<br/>
teacher advised her to just take the test instead of<br/>
spending any time in class.  At eighteen she passed<br/>
her GED, took the ACT, then placement tests at the<br/>
community college, then attended college classes for<br/>
two years while still working part- to full-time.  Not<br/>
transferring to the university was her choice.  She&#39;s<br/>
worked full-time steadily since college and now is 23,<br/>
with a great variety of interests and activities in<br/>
her life.<br/>
<br/>
With a specific goal in mind, the related volunteer<br/>
work, and relationships with people in her chosen<br/>
field, your daughter will probably want to do what&#39;s<br/>
needed.  My younger girl even asks for new workbooks,<br/>
etc, for her least favorite subjects so she&#39;ll know<br/>
she&#39;s maintaining a useful body of knowledge and<br/>
skill.  I don&#39;t think it matters so much what<br/>
resources you use, if you&#39;re both comfortable.  I<br/>
personally feel regimentation is unhealthy, and that<br/>
it&#39;s different from being disciplined or<br/>
self-disciplined.  I know it&#39;s very easy for my<br/>
daughters and for myself to learn something at the<br/>
time it&#39;s interesting or related to something<br/>
interesting and when the time-frame doesn&#39;t matter. <br/>
There&#39;s a great deal more to novels and movies, for<br/>
example, than just a story line, and they&#39;ve led us in<br/>
a lot of fascinating directions academically.<br/>
