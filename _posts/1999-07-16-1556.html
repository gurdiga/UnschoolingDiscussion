practice of unschooling.<br/>

Life Scripting<br/>
<br/>
	If the sameness of habits, opinions, and goals is any indication, more<br/>
than a few people in our society have absolved themselves of the<br/>
responsibility to script their own lives.  Instead they opt for the<br/>
convenience of  pre-packaged scripts derived through popular opinion.  <br/>
	Of course, popular opinion can sometimes be logical, and prudent. <br/>
However, those who unquestioningly accept too much of it risk losing their<br/>
individuality.  In the long run, such people risk losing their capacity to<br/>
be creative, entertain themselves, or engage in rigorous independent<br/>
thinking--all essential aspects of a rich and meaningful life.<br/>
	While many may agree that nurturing individuality is essential to<br/>
happiness, too few adults have the time or inclination to do that.  Perhaps<br/>
this is because of heavy pressure to conform not only on the job, but also<br/>
during much of their leisure time.  Or perhaps as children they didn&#39;t get<br/>
enough time to daydream, to imagine, or to play.  Maybe they grew up<br/>
depending on others to entertain them and never fully learned to create<br/>
their own fun.  Whatever the reason, far too many adults exchange their<br/>
prerogative  to act independently for the convenience of following popular<br/>
scripts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Popular scripts and their antidotes<br/>
<br/>
College is for nearly everyone<br/>
<br/>
	Our nation&#39;s university system is the largest, and most respected in the<br/>
world.  As it has grown, so has its overhead.  Its continued financial<br/>
survival and growth depends on widespread acceptance of the &quot;fact&quot; that a<br/>
college degree is a necessary goal for virtually  everyone.  If too many<br/>
people were to turn their backs on the idea of college, the higher<br/>
education industry would be doomed.  Hence, popular opinion, spawned by<br/>
monied interests predictably supports the status quo.<br/>
	There are other options, however.  More young people could learn trades. <br/>
They could take jobs and work their way up using common sense,<br/>
determination, and self-education.  They could start their own businesses. <br/>
These aren&#39;t just consolation prizes for those who can&#39;t afford a<br/>
university education.  Rather, for the right person, they are superior<br/>
options to merely following the crowd to college.  <br/>
	Recently I had a chat with a man who is a world-renowned voice trainer and<br/>
former professional opera singer, and also happens to be one of my carpet<br/>
cleaning customers.  He originally broke into the opera world not through<br/>
earning a degree, but by  winning a song contest.  As he honed his craft,<br/>
word spread about his talent.  This was the beginning of his lifetime<br/>
career.<br/>
	He pointed out how many parents shell out tens of thousands of dollars to<br/>
send their children to big-name universities and music schools to learn to<br/>
sing in the opera.  According to him, university graduates may have a<br/>
textbook knowledge of the mechanics, but frequently lack the feel, the<br/>
fire, and the ear which opera singers need.  He finds that recent<br/>
graduates, if they are to have any shot at success, often need to &quot;start<br/>
all over again&quot; with a good voice teacher.  When I hear things like this, I<br/>
have to wonder who really benefits from all of the money parents spend on<br/>
&quot;prestigious&quot; degrees.<br/>
	Encouraging young people to think independently and listen to their hearts<br/>
more than popular opinion can go a long way in counteracting the<br/>
everyone-goes-to-college mind-set.  There are many ways to do this.  Mini<br/>
apprenticeships, wide exposure to different careers through frequent field<br/>
trips, museum visits, travels, reading, and even dinner table discussions<br/>
can open young minds to possibilities far beyond just the college option.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Become a homeowner as soon as humanly possible<br/>
<br/>
	This is supposedly one of the first goals for which a young working adult<br/>
should strive.  Sometimes though it makes more sense to put off<br/>
homeownership for a few years or even a decade or more.  Many people view<br/>
their first home purchase as a success, a step up in the world.  In terms<br/>
of individual growth, however, it could be a failure if it&#39;s achieved at<br/>
the expense of suppressed creativity or missed mind-broadening<br/>
opportunities.	<br/>
	During my four year stint as a young Air Force officer in England I was<br/>
repeatedly pressured by peers to buy a home.  There I was, just one hour&#39;s<br/>
drive away from London, one of the most culturally fascinating cities in<br/>
the world, and here are these people telling me I should take on the duties<br/>
and worries of  homeownership.  For crying out loud, I wasn&#39;t about to<br/>
exchange the comparative freedom to take weekly day trips to places like<br/>
St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral, Covent Garden, or Trafalgar Square for weekends<br/>
filled up with cleaning, lawn-mowing, and honey-do-lists!<br/>
	A simple way to counter the pressure for premature homeownership is to<br/>
discover your bliss and shamelessly immerse yourself in it.  Travel, sample<br/>
and dabble with various careers, create, compose, or just sit and observe. <br/>
If you have extra money, spend it on things near to your heart.   Become a<br/>
homeowner when the time is right; when it won&#39;t detract from more<br/>
meaningful things.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Income is the most important factor in the choice of careers <br/>
<br/>
	A few years ago a dentist whose office carpet I cleaned, admitted that the<br/>
chance to make a lot of money was the main reason he chose dentistry.  With<br/>
hindsight, perhaps he wished other values would have played a larger role<br/>
in that decision.  I detected a twinge of regret in his confession.<br/>
	Too many people make the same mistake.  They choose careers by what&#39;s hot<br/>
at the time or what can bring them a lot of money.  In the long run, many<br/>
regret having had such uninspired motives.  True, they might earn a lot of<br/>
money and status.  However, as they mature, more than a few of  them<br/>
discover that their &quot;hot career&quot; brings them little in the way of inner<br/>
satisfaction or sense of providing a necessary and appreciated service. <br/>
Though it enriches them in material things, it impoverishes their souls.   <br/>
<br/>
	Recently I got a letter from a former tenured professor who at the age of<br/>
50 turned her back on an excellent salary, and a secure career highlighted<br/>
by a coveted teaching  award.  She now does freelance consulting.  Living<br/>
on significantly less income, she drives a 22 year old car, and makes other<br/>
financial sacrifices as necessary.  Her new lifestyle however, allows her<br/>
time she never had before to do meaningful things like giving service to<br/>
HIV positive children, and assisting in animal rescue.  By diminishing the<br/>
importance of income in her life, she has actually increased her<br/>
non-financial wealth (peace of mind, sharper focus, etc.) many times over.<br/>
	Money is important, and so are opportunities for advancement.  Far more<br/>
critical than those, however, is to find work in which you believe; work<br/>
which feeds your soul; work which truly challenges all of your faculties. <br/>
That&#39;s the sort of work which will not only meet your physical needs, but<br/>
help to make your life meaningful.  Down the road, that last bit may prove<br/>
to be the more significant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shop &#39;til you drop <br/>
<br/>
	Shopping seems to be the number one leisure activity in our culture.  For<br/>
many people it&#39;s not just about getting the things they need, rather, it<br/>
occupies in inordinate amount of their free time, not to mention their<br/>
thoughts.  <br/>
	I&#39;m not saying that shopping is necessarily bad.  The point is that it&#39;s<br/>
just one way of spending leisure time out of a universe of other<br/>
activities.  How boring to get stuck on just one option.  Why not try a<br/>
different hobby, or if you&#39;re a diehard shopper, approach it from an<br/>
unconventional angle?<br/>
	Sometimes taking the frugal route (thrift stores, garage sales, etc.) can<br/>
make shopping into a challengingly creative and educational pastime.   <br/>
Consider my younger sister, the &quot;garage-sailor&quot; extraordinaire.  Over the<br/>
past decade she has gone to garage sales nearly every Saturday.  That has<br/>
enabled my sister and her husband to fill their home with quality<br/>
furniture, give their children many toys, and pack their closets with<br/>
clothes.  And all of this cost them a mere fraction (frequently 10% or<br/>
less) of what they would have paid in stores.  If that isn&#39;t enough, from<br/>
those experiences she has acquired a sharp eye for quality, a keen sense<br/>
for value, and an amazing store of knowledge about antiques.  Regularly<br/>
finding deals like $4 for a bundle of hardly used name-brand children&#39;s<br/>
clothes, or $50 for an antique oak drop-leaf table worth $900, enables her<br/>
to afford all of the things they need, and many of the things they want. <br/>
That sort of shopping differs sharply from the mainstream script and is<br/>
something which could provide entertainment for life!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: Be your own scriptwriter<br/>
	<br/>
	Just because you live in the suburbs and have a six-year-old son doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean you&#39;re required to enroll him in a soccer league.  Just because you&#39;re<br/>
climbing the corporate ladder doesn&#39;t mean golf has to be your sport, or<br/>
you have to make your wife a football widow.  Permit yourself the freedom<br/>
to break the rules.  Follow your heart wherever it leads.  Some of the<br/>
things you enjoy may be mainstream, and some not.  The crucial point is to<br/>
do what you love; what feels right. <br/>
<br/>
	Be your own scriptwriter.  In the long run, you&#39;ll be happier being<br/>
yourself than being a conformist because you think it&#39;s required to<br/>
maintain or enhance your status.  And your reward may very well be a life<br/>
overflowing with intellectual stimulation, interesting experiences, and<br/>
creative ideas.<br/>

I surely don&#39;t mind your essays and enjoyed the last one immensely (I am<br/>
replying before reading this one) I am just wondering if you mind anyone<br/>
posting your essays on other lists?<br/>

Kids need to know that they don&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to get  married at all.  I know<br/>
many people I thought that should have stayed  single, or maybe been married<br/>
but not had kids.<br/>
