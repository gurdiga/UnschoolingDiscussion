Copyright subsists in &quot;any original work of authorship fixed in a<br/>
tangible medium of expression&quot; - to wit e-mails, if your machine<br/>
captures them (and it does).  17 U.S.C. ยง 102(b).  The copyright<br/>
vests upon creation in the author, except in the case of a &quot;work<br/>
made for hire&quot;.   17 U.S.C. ยง201(a), (d).  For instance, Yahoo!&#39;s<br/>
acknowledge your ownership of your posts; the terms of service<br/>
include a license to Yahoo! from the author of any message posted<br/>
in the groups, to allow distribution, display and other exclusive<br/>
rights belonging to the copyright owner.<br/>

<br/>
 In preparing a thesis, the issue in all likelihood would not be<br/>
whether there is a copyright in the e-mail belonging to the<br/>
author, but rather whether the academic use would fall under fair<br/>
use.  17 U.S.C. 107  In advising clients on copyright and fair<br/>
use issues, I have always been very careful to say that anyone<br/>
who gives an absolute answer on fair use, short of reading the<br/>
Supreme Court&#39;s decision on the same case simply does not<br/>
understand fair use.  There are four factors balanced to<br/>
determine fair use:  (1) the purpose and character of the use;<br/>
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and<br/>
substantiality of copying; and (4)  the market effect. 17 U.S.C.<br/>
107.<br/>
<br/>
Were I writing a paper about internet communications and<br/>
community, I would not hesitate over copyright issues in using<br/>
messages from this list.   I might well be inclined to seek<br/>
specific permission if I were writing on unschooling, where my<br/>
paper might ultimately become a competing work.  Similarly I<br/>
would evaluate the torts of rights of privacy and publicity<br/>
differently depending on the actual subject of the paper.  And<br/>
finally, I would act based on how risk averse I was.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-770546038">The Yahoo! capture may well be enough; moreover it is almost<br/>
impossible to avoid having your hard drive capture what you type,<br/>
as any number of criminal defendants have discovered.  Given that<br/>
the person writing the thesis has no way of knowing what if any<br/>
fixing of the work has been done, he has no practical way except<br/>
asking to determine whether there is a copyright.  The<br/>
intellectual dishonesty of plagiarism wasn&#39;t part of my calculus,<br/>
given that each institution has differing codes of conduct.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, whether the defense of fair use to the allegation of<br/>
copyright infringement is available requires significant<br/>
balancing.  If he wants legal advice on how to proceed, he will<br/>
need to consult a lawyer of his own; nothing in my e-mail is<br/>
legal advice.<br/>
