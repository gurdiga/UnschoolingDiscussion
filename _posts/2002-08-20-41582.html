DUST IF YOU MUST<br/>
<br/>
   Dust if you must, but wouldn&#39;t it be better<br/>
  To paint a picture or write a letter,<br/>
  Bake a cake or plant a seed.<br/>
  Ponder the difference between want and need.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Dust if you must, but there&#39;s not much time,<br/>
  With rivers to swim and mountains to climb!<br/>
  Music to hear and books to read,<br/>
  Friends to cherish and life to lead.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Dust if you must, but the world&#39;s out there<br/>
  With the sun in your eyes, the wind in your hair,<br/>
  A flutter of snow, a shower of rain. <br/>
  This day will not come around again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Dust if you must, but bear in mind,<br/>
  Old age will come and it&#39;s not kind.<br/>
  And when you go and go you must,<br/>
  You, yourself, will make more dust.</div>
