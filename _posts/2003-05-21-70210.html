&gt; for disobedience. &quot;If you want my attention - then you have it!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I peed right there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I couldn&#39;t help it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I was struggling to hold it in while she banged her stupid gavel and <br/>
&gt; screamed at me to be still.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Were you lucky enough to get her shoes????  ;)  This sort of thing <br/>
&gt; happened to my sister in 3rd grade.  What is UP with the power trip when <br/>
&gt; a child needs to go to the bathroom?!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I was in 4th grade my teacher told me that I couldn&#39;t go so I got <br/>
&gt; up and ran out of the classroom and barely made it.  When I got back to <br/>
&gt; my class the teacher had obviously announced that I was going to get the <br/>
&gt; paddle because I disobeyed him.  I saw it in his hand and ran right back <br/>
&gt; out of that room all the way to the principal&#39;s office and told him that <br/>
&gt; I wanted to call my mom to pick me up because my teacher wanted to <br/>
&gt; paddle me for using the bathroom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lucky for me the principal just loved me and chewed the teacher out in <br/>
&gt; front of me.  hee hee!  I did call my mom who came and got me and my dad <br/>
&gt; left work when he got wind of it and told this guy he&#39;d &quot;kick his a$$&quot; <br/>
&gt; if he so much as thought of touching me.  HA HA HA  That was so awesome! <br/>
&gt; If only everyone could feel that their parents were on their side.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was in junior high, one of our Gym requirements was that we had to <br/>
climb the rope to the top of the very tall gym. We were graded on how high we <br/>
got, and to get an A you had to touch the ceiling. I was terrified of the <br/>
heights, and didn&#39;t have the upper body strength to do it anyway. <br/>
<br/>
I was really upset that I was going to fail...GYM!!!!!  I told my parents, <br/>
and the next day my father, who rarely got involved in the school stuff, called <br/>
the gym teacher and told her that I would NOT be climbing the rope if I didn&#39;t <br/>
feel comfortable doing it, and that I would NOT be punished for it.<br/>
