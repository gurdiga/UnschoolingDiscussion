 </span></blockquote>Depends on what your goal is.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to live life, subjects aren&#39;t necessary. Do you see adults<br/>
dividing life into subjects? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you want to unschool, subjects aren&#39;t necessary. Everything is<br/>
intertwined so there&#39;s no division.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is learning, you just learn what interests you.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is college, people&#39;s answers can be more focused if you ask how<br/>
unschoolers get into college.<br/>
<br/>
So the real question is &quot;Required for what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Basically your question really only makes sense in school. In life there are<br/>
no requirements. We make of it what we will so you can learn what you need.<br/>
But school isn&#39;t about learning. They wish it were! But it&#39;s about doing<br/>
what&#39;s necessary to pass a required course, to jump through that hoop.<br/>
Basically all kids want to know is high high and how far to jump so they can<br/>
move onto the next hoop and leave the last one behind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465382802">Re:  formal school subjects and whether it&#39;s necessary to cover it <br/>
all. I thought this was not just about schoolish stuff like administration and <br/>
required credits and prerequisites, but more of a philosophical question. &quot;Do <br/>
unschoolers need or require what schools offer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       Probably I am wrong about the questioner&#39;s original intent, but here&#39;s <br/>
my unschooling response anyway! :-)<br/>
<br/>
       Asking what subjects school teaches and whether those subjects are <br/>
necessary is like asking what the Bible teaches and whether it&#39;s all needed. (Or <br/>
fill in other sacred texts.) Do humans need and require what they purport to <br/>
teach? <br/>
<br/>
       We don&#39;t go to school or church, but I can&#39;t say no.<br/>
<br/>
       I see truth and beauty in learning wherever it is found, in the Bible <br/>
or school, or outside of either one. <br/>
<br/>
       There are strange lessons in both the Bible and school, teachings we <br/>
can take on faith or reject, or make of them whatever we will. <br/>
<br/>
       Great good and great wrong has been done in the name of both the Bible <br/>
and school. Neither can be legally imposed on unschoolers where I live. So <br/>
it&#39;s reasonable to say I don&#39;t need or require the Bible. I don&#39;t need or <br/>
require school credits.<br/>
<br/>
       But none of this is quite the same as saying what&#39;s found in the Bible <br/>
(or in school) isn&#39;t needed or required.  <br/>
<br/>
       In the Disciplined Mind, Howard Gardner famously proposed a public <br/>
school K-12 curriculum based on deep themes of &quot;truth, beauty and goodness.&quot;  I <br/>
would argue it closely tracks the content of the Bible in how it tries to meet <br/>
human needs and requirements. <br/>
<br/>
       Schools teach PE and colleges often require PE credit and sports <br/>
participation. There are ways to into college without a sport or PE credit, and <br/>
plenty of other ways to enjoy physical activity and develop healthy habits of <br/>
mind and body. So we don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to take the school course (the course may even <br/>
make us hate PE! &lt;g&gt; ), but nevertheless, don&#39;t we &quot;need&quot; what it purports to <br/>
offer us? <br/>
<br/>
       Researchers are demonstrating that cardiovascular training causes <br/>
significant, physical changes in cognitive function. Schools required sports a <br/>
hundred years ago in private prep schools, without benefit of the cognitive <br/>
science, and that tradition continues today. I hated PE in school btw. <br/>
<br/>
       But oxygen is good for the brain, it seems. Regardless of how we get <br/>
it, we DO need it, and benefit more the more we get. No one can force it on us, <br/>
but the need for it transcends any delivery system debate.<br/>
<br/>
       We don&#39;t have to get our truth, beauty and goodness from a sacred text <br/>
or from one of Gardner&#39;s schools. Unschoolers can get them a thousand ways. <br/>
But that&#39;s not to say we don&#39;t need or require them. :)  JJ<br/>
