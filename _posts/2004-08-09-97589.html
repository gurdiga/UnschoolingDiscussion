Please  talk it up!  It seems like all the list I&#39;m on with large <br/>
groups of  Christian homeschoolers have post after post about their <br/>
conferences and  the moderators don&#39;t seem to mind.  They talk at <br/>
length about the  speakers, last year&#39;s conference, where to meet each <br/>
other and there are  lots of tips (don&#39;t bring the kids, don&#39;t buy <br/>
anything the first day but  spend like crazy on the last).  <br/>
 <br/>
At this one, DODODO bring the kids!<br/>
 <br/>
Bring raffle donations the first day.<br/>
 <br/>
And buy raffle tickets all weekend! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>

has  stopped. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Really? I thought L&L got a good bit of air-time---although there could  <br/>
ALWAYS be more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Oh, please do! Makes me feel all warm inside! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Unschoolers often say that they don&#39;t &quot;need&quot;  conferences but it&#39;s not <br/>
 </span></blockquote>about need- it&#39;s about fun and learning and  getting together and <br/>
laughing and late night discussions.  We can all  *use* those things <br/>
even if we don&#39;t need any actual unschooling  support.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Well, I&#39;d agree that unschoolers DON&#39;T need regular HOMEschooling  <br/>
conferences/conventions. They don&#39;t give me anything I&#39;m looking for. The Live  and <br/>
Learn UNschooling Conference is something all together different! You get  more of <br/>
a feeling of &quot;tribe&quot;----hundreds of like-minded souls. Incredible!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>day, talking to people who understand you and  watching your kids play <br/>
with other children raised in freedom?  It&#39;s  like that only 100 times <br/>
better!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
And 100 times better than THAT!<br/>
 <br/>
Y&#39;all COME!<br/>
