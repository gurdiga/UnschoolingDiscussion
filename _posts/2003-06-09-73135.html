neighborhood garage sale. It says the author is &quot;Shambhala&quot;.. But then it has a bio of <br/>
Ed Brown in the back...maybe it&#39;s his Buddhist name? Interesting.<br/>
Awesome bread book. Mine has &quot;A composite of Kitchen Necessities&quot; in the <br/>
beginning:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bringing food alive with your loving presence.  To have compassion, to have <br/>
respect for fresh foods, for broken bowls, for dirty napkins and little bugs.  <br/>
To take care of leftovers, not saying, oh that&#39;s all right, we have plenty, <br/>
we can throw that away....because everything is saying love me, have <br/>
compassion, hold me gently.  Please hug me now and then (we&#39;re really one, not two) but <br/>
don&#39;t get attached (we&#39;re really two, not one).  The bowls and knoves, the <br/>
table, the teapot, teh leftoers, the modling vegetables, the juicy fruit, <br/>
everything is asking this of you:<br/>
make full use, take loving care of me......<br/>
<br/>
It goes on, it&#39;s very lovely. Very mindful way of being.<br/>
