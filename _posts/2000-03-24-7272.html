Buzz, this is the first year we have chickens to hatch and care for the
babies.&nbsp; We have been raising chicks for a few years.&nbsp; Finally
this year we had a broody hen to do the work.&nbsp; The babies are a week
old.
<br>We did hatch some peacocks from eggs though.
<br>I can send you lots of web sites, but you&#39;ll have to wait until later
today.&nbsp; I&#39;m so behind in my email!
<br>Chickens are a blast.&nbsp; We really love ours, but it was much easier
for the mommy to do it!&nbsp; :)
<br>&nbsp;We just used a cardboard box for a brooder.&nbsp; Works just
fine.&nbsp; Used pine shavings in the bottom of it, and hung a heat lamp
from the shelf above it.&nbsp; Looked funny, took up most of the laundry
room, but it worked great.
<br>I&#39;ll send web sites soon.&nbsp; Ask any questions you have...we&#39;ll
try to help.
