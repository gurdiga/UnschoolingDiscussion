<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929119741">Four years ago, (or so) we were a very mainstream family.  I don&#39;t remember <br/>
when it started, but I heard about homeschooling and fell in love with the <br/>
idea.  I began reading and by the end of the year, I decided to pull my <br/>
daughter out of school and bring her home.  During those days of reading, I <br/>
became aquainted with gentle parenting, decided to have unassisted births, <br/>
use cloth diapers and threw out the bottles for extended breastfeeding.  The <br/>
process has been quite gradual, for me, but for my family (and my husband <br/>
sometimes, lol) I&#39;ve turned into this radical hippie overnight.  I should <br/>
also add that during this process of reading and learning, I slowly drifted <br/>
from the belief system in which I was raised (Episcopalian) and began <br/>
exploring other faiths to the point that I now am left with basically no <br/>
religious beliefs whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
My children attended church off and on while they were very young, but 10 <br/>
years ago, I lost my daughter to stillbirth and I suppose that&#39;s when my <br/>
religious beliefs came under intense fire from within.  For some reason, now <br/>
when my children visit my grandparents house, my grandmother INSISTS on them <br/>
saying a prayer at mealtime.  They actually are not allowed to eat unless <br/>
they participate (heads bowed, hands folded).  I have explained to my <br/>
grandmother that they don&#39;t need to pray if they don&#39;t want to because we <br/>
don&#39;t pray at home, but I hesitate to go further because she has gotten <br/>
quite good at losing it on me, in front of my children, which I like to <br/>
avoid at all costs.  Today, in the car, my older son was irritating my <br/>
younger son and she actually turned around and slapped his hand!  Our van is <br/>
broken down and she was taking us to the grocery store, so I, once again, <br/>
hesitated to say anything...not to mention I was completely shocked!  I have <br/>
never seen her raise a hand to a child in my life!  Anyone for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago, she was over and read a couple of unschooling articles I had <br/>
lying around and went off on me about how behind my children will become if <br/>
I follow this nonsense, how they NEED to be in school, how terrible it is <br/>
that my almost 7 year old is just learning to read (she easily forgets this <br/>
same child has been  multiplying and dividing since the age of four.)<br/>
<br/>
When my last two children were born, she raised hell, WHILE I was in LABOR!, <br/>
that I was going to kill my children by not having at least a midwife here <br/>
with us.<br/>
<br/>
This is getting to the point where I feel like throwing in the towel and not <br/>
even speaking to her.  I&#39;ve asked her to read books, websites, anything, but <br/>
she refuses.  She sees what happy, bright children I have and does not <br/>
hesitate to comment on how wonderful they are, but bring up anything related <br/>
to my choices in parenting and watch out!  Suddenly, those wonderful, <br/>
bright, happy children are in dire straits.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you dealt with this in one form or another?  How can I tactfully <br/>
deal with her in front of my children?  Hell, away from my children?  If she <br/>
drops in unannounced during &quot;school days&quot; and sees them doing their own <br/>
thing, she goes haywire.  My husband works out of town a LOT and until we <br/>
get our van in working order, she is my only source of help for getting <br/>
anywhere, not to mention just getting a break now and then.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long, but after tonight&#39;s prayer and hand slapping episode, <br/>
my blood is past boiling and I&#39;m at my wits end.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I would do is to completely stay away from this toxic woman. I&#39;d eat<br/>
popcorn every day for a week, rather than have a person drive my family to<br/>
the grocery store who was going to hit my child! Lock your door and don&#39;t<br/>
let her &quot;drop in unannounced&quot;. How to deal with her &quot;tactfully&quot; in front of<br/>
your children? I&#39;d personally say &quot;it is not okay for anyone to hit my<br/>
children&quot;. I think it&#39;s more important for my kids to know that I will not<br/>
let someone abuse them than for some adult woman to not have hurt feelings.<br/>
I&#39;m very unclear why you would invite a woman like that to your birthing,<br/>
especially a second time after she acted like that the first time. I&#39;m<br/>
unclear why you continue to have her be a part of your daily existence. I&#39;m<br/>
unclear why if she insists that the kids pray, you don&#39;t just say &quot;My<br/>
children don&#39;t need to pray if they don&#39;t want to.&quot; and if she &quot;loses it on<br/>
you&quot; as you&#39;ve said the she does, go out of her house and don&#39;t go back!<br/>
Life is too short to choose to be in the presence of people like that. Life<br/>
is *way* too short to insist that children be in her presence.<br/>
I would do whatever it takes to get your van fixed and not be dependant on<br/>
this woman. If that is not possible, do all your shopping when your husband<br/>
is there and stay at home or find alternate transportation when he&#39;s not. It<br/>
is within your power to choose to be around her abuse, verbal and otherwise,<br/>
or not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you sure there is no one else to help with groceries, friends, other <br/>
homeschool moms or doing them when the DH is home so you can use the family <br/>
car etc.  I would definitely speak with her and if she often causes a scene <br/>
you could do it when the children aren&#39;t there.  First I would tell her, that <br/>
no matter what she thinks, hitting is not allowed, end of that statement.  I <br/>
would be afraid of the statement I would be making to my children if I <br/>
allowed someone to touch them that way and did not step in.  <br/>
<br/>
I think about that a lot when Jackson&#39;s dad comes to visit.  He seems like a <br/>
mean man.  His spirit is not child centered or even child interested.  They <br/>
are to sit and be quiet.  He hasn&#39;t yet reached out to hit any of them but <br/>
Jackson and I have spoken about what to do if he does and Jackson knows he <br/>
will talk to his dad about it before his next visit.<br/>
<br/>
I think someone here mentioned a neighbor that spanked her child.  And that <br/>
really got me thinking about doing something before hand to prevent it.  Any <br/>
way.  I know that wasn&#39;t much for advice or help but keep trying to find a <br/>
way to not be so dependent on her and you might find it easier to confront <br/>
her.  Tough situation all around.<br/>

would call back repeatedly.  When I took the phone off the hook, she <br/>
showed up at the house.  During the second birth, my mother took <br/>
over and she left.  Peacefully once she saw the baby was ok.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m working on this.  It&#39;s hard to turn away, albeit easier when <br/>
things like this happen.  She&#39;s one of those people that once the <br/>
bad moments are over, she acts like everything is just wonderful.  <br/>
The terrible part is I am apt to just let things go to save the <br/>
peace, not to mention my children get really upset when I tell them <br/>
we can&#39;t see her.  This has been an ongoing struggle.  I&#39;ve gone <br/>
months without speaking to her but it seems like once things mellow <br/>
out, I&#39;m back again.  It helps to have an outside opinion, because, <br/>
of course, the rest of my family wants me to keep the peace as <br/>
well.  It&#39;s hard to see things clearly when staying osolated from <br/>
just my grandmother means isolating myself from my entire family.  <br/>
That&#39;s not an excuse to continue, just a statement really.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
once we are mobile again, it will make things much easier.<br/>

I wasn&#39;t actually there yesterday when this happened.  A few of the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I called my husband last night, after writing this and told him we <br/>
need to do something about the van, asap.  He has always been on my <br/>
side, thankfully, and wants me to separate myself from her.  He told <br/>
me the van will go in the shop, as soon as he gets home, for <br/>
diagnostics so he can fix it!!  He&#39;s had it on the back burner <br/>
because I&#39;ve been able to rely on her for help.  When I told him <br/>
about yesterday, he was furious.  I wish it hadn&#39;t taken this for it <br/>
to happen, but at least I can now see a light at the end of the <br/>
tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your insight.  I know it sounds rediculous that I would <br/>
put up with all this at my children&#39;s and my own expense.  I do try <br/>
to get all my shopping done when he&#39;s home, but this last time, he <br/>
was gone for over 6 weeks, and now he&#39;s been gone over 2 and will be <br/>
home next weekend.  Those long hauls are hard to get through since <br/>
we are not within walking distance of a store, which is why I was <br/>
getting her help.  BUT, I called my friend and she offered to go to <br/>
the store for me when needed, so at least for the next week, I can <br/>
rely on her for help.  It sucks that sometimes bad things need to <br/>
happen to get help from others, but at least I have the option now. <br/>
This is longer than I had anticipated, but I wanted to answer all of <br/>
your questions.  Hope this makes things clearer.  <br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>

&gt; my blood is past boiling and I&#39;m at my wits end.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I feel for you.  I&#39;ve been in a similar situation with my ILs.  It<br/>
practically came to blows about 5 years ago and we didn&#39;t even speak for<br/>
about 3 years.  We&#39;ll still never be close, but we do send a digital<br/>
photo of the kids to them every so often (every couple of months).  No<br/>
need for me to get into my situation, just to say that I learned that<br/>
maybe people could walk all over me prior to having children, but once<br/>
my first baby was born I wasn&#39;t going to let ANYONE do anything in front<br/>
of her that was horrible and I was not going to let anyone make me do<br/>
things that I didn&#39;t want my daughter to see me do.  Then was the time<br/>
for me to prove who I was and stand up for the things that I believed<br/>
in.  If not then, then when would it ever matter?  I didn&#39;t want to be a<br/>
hypocrite in my beliefs.  <br/>
<br/>
As hard as that was to endure, I have gained the strength to know that I<br/>
can and would stand up to anyone when it comes to matters that I believe<br/>
strongly in.  I could walk away from any relationship if it were a toxic<br/>
one to me.  I will fight hard to make my relationships with my children<br/>
never be toxic, but that requires an honesty and closeness that is like<br/>
very few relationships that I will ever have.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple questions:<br/>
Does your husband always go out of town to the same location?  If yes,<br/>
could you move there?  There is nothing like having two parents in a<br/>
household where both are around a lot.  It is much easier and happier<br/>
for everyone!  <br/>
<br/>
Does your town offer any grocery delivery services?  I live in a rather<br/>
large city, so we have several stores that will deliver groceries for<br/>
free if over a certain dollar amount ($250) or for a reasonable charge<br/>
for less.  There are also several personal shoppers that I&#39;ve seen<br/>
advertised and their rates aren&#39;t ridiculous once you figure just how<br/>
long it takes to shop with children and the cost of driving, etc.  There<br/>
are also a couple of online grocery stores that I&#39;ve seen before (not<br/>
offered here yet) that might cover your area.  I can&#39;t think of their<br/>
names off hand.<br/>
<br/>
It is nice that you have friends that would get stuff for you.  I don&#39;t<br/>
like to be too dependent on anyone else without repaying them somehow,<br/>
or else resentments can easily start.  I&#39;ve seen people claim over and<br/>
over that they don&#39;t mind doing things, then come years later to list<br/>
out everything that they&#39;ve done for the other one...  I&#39;d say that<br/>
Grandma probably fits in that category!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  Family relationships are the absolute hardest to deal<br/>
with!!!  I feel for you, whatever your decisions are, you will be living<br/>
with the ramifications for a long time.  Just stand up for your children<br/>
and your beliefs and you will know that you are doing the right thing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sadly, no.  I wish he did!  I think life would be sooo much better <br/>
if we *could* move away.  Our youngest is almost 7 months old and <br/>
he&#39;s been home about 2 months of that total.  It is soo hard being <br/>
home alone, especially with no vehicle.  Thankfully, he is now <br/>
committed to getting our van working again, so once we are out and <br/>
about on our own, life will be much better, easier, joyful, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does your town offer any grocery delivery services?  <br/>

services, but many of them went under.  It&#39;s certainly worth <br/>
checking out.  Surely someone still offers this...we live in the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Boy, I tried to edit this a bit but I must say how very much I <br/>
agree.  Actually, this friend is my best girlfriend.  We&#39;ve been <br/>
friends for almost 15 years and we always trade off on favors, so I <br/>
have no fear that I will wear her out! ;)  Since I haven&#39;t been <br/>
mobile in quite some time, I offer to keep her kids so she can clean <br/>
her house or get out with her hubby.  It works out pretty well.  <br/>
And, oh, I&#39;m SURE this is how Grandma feels.  My parents were <br/>
abusive and she took me in at ten.  She absolutely feels this way <br/>
when I disagree with her about anything!  Not so much that it is <br/>
said, but I can feel the, &#39;well, I&#39;ve done soooo much for you, the <br/>
least you could do is take my advice&#39;, kind of thing.  I hadn&#39;t <br/>
thought of it in this way.  Another eye-opener, indeed!  I suppose I <br/>
also have a little guilt as a result.<br/>

and whine about yesterday and she agreed with my grandmother!  So, <br/>
it&#39;s nice to have someone on my side!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think this whole situation is doing much more harm than good to you and<br/>
more importantly your children. I have had to make decisions rather recently<br/>
as to certain family members being around me and our children. When I&#39;m<br/>
around somone, I want to be able to feel safe and welcomed. I wasnt to be<br/>
able to take something away from that meeting of that person. Something<br/>
enjoyable. If I&#39;m not, then that person is not worth the time of  me or my<br/>
family. If it&#39;s strained and stressful, then it&#39;s just not something I want<br/>
to deal with. This has resulted in no communication with major family<br/>
members on both my side and also Joe&#39;s. It mostly had to do with the way we<br/>
parent our children. I try at first to explain, to question and even to ask<br/>
for understanding or at least quiet compliance when in my house. When I get<br/>
none of that, they&#39;re history.<br/>
<br/>
I would think that you surely can find something else as far as<br/>
transportation and  support. You certainly aren&#39;t getting it now.<br/>

firm boundaries. It&#39;s not okay for her to be intimidating you like this. It <br/>
may not be possible to avoid ruffling her feathers or hurting her feelings <br/>
as you set these boundaries for what is and is not okay behavior with you <br/>
and your kids. But your kids are your priority. They are the one that need <br/>
protecting.<br/>
