I struggled, but my mind was poisoned from years of institutional settings and bad associations with math.  I finally learned some algebra (although math is still not my favorite) in college.  They do teach it there, for those who need it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552809806">Hi guys!<br/>
<br/>
 I think one of the main reasons I took my daughter out of school after 2nd <br/>
grade is that I saw my inquisitive, motivated, life-loving child start <br/>
avoiding reading, writing and anything which could be construed as learning.  <br/>
 My daughter kept asking why she had to learn that stuff.  She&#39;s very strong <br/>
willed and persistent.  Every single homework assignment it seemed she would <br/>
ask, &quot;Why do I have to do this?&quot;  Respnding,&quot;Because you have to&quot; got really <br/>
old after a while.  Part of me wished she would just go with the program and <br/>
stop thinking for herself!!!! (uuuggh) But that&#39;s just not her (thank God)<br/>
<br/>
This was our first year unschooling and I can&#39;t seem to bring myself to use <br/>
any of the &#39;worksheet&#39; books I purchased when we first started.  It just <br/>
doesn&#39;t fit for me to use something which has no context, or meaning behind <br/>
it.  I know that if she finds a need to go to college she will find the means <br/>
to learn what she needs to know.  She is extremely resourseful.  And yes, it <br/>
does take some trust.  But I know that for right now it is working for us.  <br/>
(We do &#39;games&#39; and some computer programs, and &#39;life&#39; problems, but so far <br/>
haven&#39;t done any &#39;sit down&#39; math, she&#39;s 9)<br/>
 I also know I was completely incompetent in high school, and that when I <br/>
went to college 10 years later, my gpa was a 4.0.  Mostly it was because I <br/>
wanted to be there.  I still didn&#39;t believe memorizing was &#39;learning&#39;, but it <br/>
was mine, with no one telling me I had to go.  I think my daughter has some <br/>
of that rebelliousness in her.  Like any quality, it seems at times it can be <br/>
a great blessing, and at others a disadvantage. <br/>
<br/>
I have to add this, an excerpt from &quot;The Schools Our Children Deserve&quot; by <br/>
Alphie Kohn <br/>
<br/>
&quot;...studies can be cited to prove that the Old School [standardized testing, <br/>
repetetive drills, etc] is successful.  But here&#39;s the catch: success can be <br/>
claimed only by those who don&#39;t care about the three other goals: (a) long-ter<br/>
m retention of these facts or skills, (b) a real understanding of ideas, <br/>
along with critical thinking, creativity, the capacity to apply skills to <br/>
different kinds of tasks, and other more sophisticated intellectual outcomes, <br/>
or (c) students&#39; interest in what they&#39;re doing, and the likelihood that <br/>
they&#39;ll come away with a continuing motivation to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Looove this book :-)<br/>

Blessings all,,,,,Jennifer</div>
