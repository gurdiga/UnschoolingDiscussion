<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257980807">You can 360-664-3574 and ask for the &quot;Pink Book&quot;.  This contains WA state<br/>
laws regulating &quot;home-based instruction&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have found it easy so far.  As far as being qualified, only one parent<br/>
needs to be.  The only thing you are required to turn in to the state is<br/>
an annual declaration of intent.  This is just a piece of paper saying<br/>
that you are homeschooling.  The testing/assessment requirement is for<br/>
the parent&#39;s use.  You do not have to share the results.<br/>
