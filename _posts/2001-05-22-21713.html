interesting.  The same was seen in Texas and Arizona.<br/>

N.M. Hispanics reject categories<br/>
MAY 22, 2001<br/>
<br/>
Foregoing a number of national origin classifications, majority of Hispanics<br/>
in New Mexico consider themselves &quot;other Hispanic&quot; when asked the question<br/>
on the Census 2000.<br/>
<br/>
The phenomenon was most evident in northern New Mexico, the location of the<br/>
state&#39;s first capitol and where Spanish explorers first settled. It is also<br/>
home to a number of Pueblos, where intermarriage is common.<br/>
<br/>
A number of Hispanics in this area consider themselves of Spanish descent,<br/>
tracing their ancestry to the first families who settled in the area. Others<br/>
say they are mixed<br/>
Hispanic and Indian.<br/>
<br/>
Many also differentiate themselves from recent Mexican immigrants.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Espanola, where I grew up, has a heck of a time doing fair stats. There are <br/>
federal funds for schools for each enrolled Indian (1/4 or more) and for <br/>
children whose parents work on federal land (and much of the state is federal <br/>
land one way or another).  <br/>
<br/>
Once when I was teaching we were to count and send stats to the office, in <br/>
homerooms.  We counted halves in my class, with much happy discussion.  I <br/>
don&#39;t remember the exact numbers except I remember we had 1.5 Indians.  It <br/>
was three kids who were half--two Hispanic and one Anglo, I think.  (AND, <br/>
btw, in northern New Mexico, there are no &quot;white&quot; people.  It is HORRIBLY <br/>
outside the pale to say &quot;white,&quot; because the hispanics in Northern New Mexico <br/>
are unquestionably white.  And &quot;Anglo&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;of England,&quot; it means <br/>
English speaking, non-hispanic, non-Indian.  When I was a kid, black kids <br/>
were Anglo, when there were any.)<br/>
<br/>
We had some number of hispanics (at the time I think the overall population <br/>
breakdown in the area was 15% Indian, 15% Anglo and 70% Hispanic).  1 of them <br/>
was those leftover halves of the two Indian kids.<br/>
<br/>
I was aware of being obstructionist, and I knew the office knew.  The kids <br/>
were HIGHLY amused, and the discussion invovled their frustration at always <br/>
having to pick one or the other.  I told them what it was really for, and <br/>
what they needed the stats for.<br/>
<br/>
So of course, the assistant principal wandered up the hall with our stats <br/>
sheet and wearily said, &quot;Okay, this isn&#39;t right.&quot;  After a spirited defense <br/>
of our count, we did the recount.  Half Indian was Indian.  A quarter was <br/>
Indian (we had no quarters in that group).  Half Anglo didn&#39;t matter <br/>
(Anglo/Hispanic mix went to Hispanic).  The only counted Anglos were those <br/>
who had neither a Hispanic nor an Indian parent.<br/>
<br/>
That was twenty years ago.<br/>
<br/>
All of my cousins, neices and nephews younger than 30 are half something.  <br/>
Most of my Indian friends married Anglos.  Statistically, that just all UPS <br/>
the count of who&#39;s what--as though Anglos are disappearing in the area.  <br/>
They&#39;re not, they&#39;re just intermarrying.<br/>
<br/>
My brother in law is a Trujillo, from a land-owning bunch of guys, and he&#39;s <br/>
one of two children so they&#39;ll have some land--not lots, but it has been in <br/>
the family for a long time.  They live about five miles past San Juan Pueblo. <br/>
 The kids went to San Juan Elementary when they weren&#39;t homeschooling.  (I <br/>
started second grade there myself, but transferred to Espanola Elementary.)   <br/>
That area is the site of San Gabriel, the first Hispanic settlement (as <br/>
opposed to explorer&#39;s camps--they were farming and building houses) in what <br/>
is now the U.S., 1598.  The names on the list of explorers who were with <br/>
Onate are almost all still in evidence in northern New Mexico.  Some common <br/>
Mexican names aren&#39;t heard there at all--they&#39;re very foreign.  And the <br/>
people from Mexico look different, and speak a different dialect of Spanish.  <br/>
The history of Spanish in northern New Mexico, and religion (the story of the <br/>
Penitentes) is fascinating, but the population is low so it&#39;s just a <br/>
curiosity for people outside the area.  This whole state has about 1.6 <br/>
million people and some air bases of temps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300809605">I am rebellious with ethnic definitions also. My children are anglo-hispanic-indian. Which one do you pick? Why do I have to, so someone can get more money I will never benefit from?<br/>
