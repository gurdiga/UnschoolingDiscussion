<div id="ygrps-yiv-251018066">After reading back my original posts I would have to agree that I have HIT my children. I dont think that it was a violent or abusive thing that I did but again hitting is hitting.  It is a very infrequent thing to happen in our family but it is definitely hitting.<br/>
As much as I enjoy getting all of these emails I must go. I am signing off for the night. Have a wonderful evening all! See you tomorrow!<br/>

about how they could say it different to avoid future hurts.<br/>
It is slow going, but I just heard Trevor yell &quot;Sierra come pick up your crap <br/>

 Unschooling  <br/>
 Morning <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 At your house it will be morning again within 24 hours, but it could be <br/>
morning in your heart any second. <br/>
<br/>
 Somewhere in the world it is morning every moment. Somewhere, light is <br/>
dawning. Some people, and I&#39;m one of them, believe that any portal to the <br/>
universe leads to the whole universe, and if that&#39;s true we should be able to <br/>
get to everything in the whole wide world (and beyond) without much effort <br/>
from something as small as, say, the definition of a word. How about <br/>
&quot;morning&quot; and its particulars, daybreak, dawn and sunrise? <br/>
<br/>
 Every day the sun comes up (unless you&#39;re in the Arctic or Antarctic, in <br/>
which cases your sun-mileage may vary). Every day is a new opportunity. <br/>
People say that all the time: &quot;It&#39;s the dawning of a new day.&quot; If you just <br/>
let those thoughts and truths go by, you&#39;re missing something important that <br/>
happens 365 days a year (sometimes with a bonus round). Don&#39;t miss important <br/>
things like opportunities for renewal and change. At your house it will be <br/>
morning again within 24 hours, but it could be morning in your heart any <br/>
second. <br/>
<br/>
 &quot;The morning of the world,&quot; someone might say, meaning just as the world was <br/>
new and bright. From this we and our children can talk about and learn about <br/>
poetry and figurative speech. &quot;The morning of his life...&quot; when likening a <br/>
lifetime to a day, with its own first light, eventual afternoon, and <br/>
twilight. These are common references. &quot;In Queen Victoria&#39;s day...&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 At our wedding my friends and relatives all sang &quot;Morning Has Broken,&quot; and <br/>
it was the morning of our lives together. Later that day we had three <br/>
children. Well, later meaning over the next six and a half years. Sometimes <br/>
time passes slowly, and sometimes it speeds by, and there is a lesson in <br/>
focus, and in flow, and in biochemistry. <br/>
 Some people collect bugs, or rocks, or videotapes. It&#39;s cheaper and easier <br/>
to collect words. If you have a name which is a noun, like &quot;Lynn&quot; or &quot;Holly&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Gill&quot; you&#39;ve probably developed an ear for hearing it and an eye for <br/>
seeing it in various contexts and have probably looked it up in dictionaries <br/>
and name books to see how old it is. This can be done with morning and joy <br/>
and tree and wind. I should have put quotation marks on those, &quot;morning&quot; and <br/>
&quot;joy&quot; and so forth, to show that I mean the word morning, not the <br/>
thing-in-the-sky morning.   Now we&#39;re talking about punctuation, the <br/>
mechanics of writing, and the branch of philosophy called ontology, about <br/>
what &quot;being&quot; is-is the word &quot;morning&quot; part of morning itself? Is morning <br/>
inside my head? Where does a &quot;real&quot; morning end and just talking and thinking <br/>
about morning start? Can you pretend morning? <br/>
<br/>
 You can spend $20 on a Mensa-approved plastic puzzle, or a book of mind- <br/>
bending questions, or you can just look out the window, name things, and <br/>
think. You can play with a dictionary, ask each other odd questions, and look <br/>
up the answers. It&#39;s the thinking that counts, the idea-getting, the <br/>
biochemical ping when the light of a new concept dawns in your mind. <br/>
<br/>
 When people begin homeschooling, that&#39;s a big bright morning, but you can <br/>
have as many mornings as you need. If you want to change the way you&#39;re being <br/>
or thinking, just do it. Don&#39;t wait for another year, another month, another <br/>
day. Good morning! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088044940">I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else wonders this?<br/>
How is giving the hearts any different from paying a child to do something?  Sandra, I&#39;m not trying to be a bitch or anything but I was reading the unschooling boards and read about the boy who wouldn&#39;t shower.  You suggested to pay him a dollar.  I don&#39;t understand the difference between the two?<br/>
Maybe its situational or different circumstances?  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m probably missing something, but can you expound on that?  I&#39;m guessing the Kohn book might explain this?<br/>
I really am trying to understand this new way of thinking about things.<br/>

difference with the kid, and ask him to learn the stuff on his own for money <br/>
instead of paying a teacher by the hour to try again to get him to understand <br/>

the mom, then she should just quit complaining about the smell.<br/>
<br/>
People will spend $80 an hour on marriage counselling who won&#39;t just go out <br/>
to dinner and a movie.  It&#39;s dumb sometimes, how people are about money.<br/>
<br/>
Money is as real as food or a clean towel or a place to sit.  Do we deprive <br/>
our kids of clean clothes?  Clean bedding?  That costs money to buy and to <br/>
wash.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people treat money like a separate and magical substance.  I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Of course people should WANT to take a shower, or just take one on the <br/>
slightest suggestion of being due one.  But if a kid is depressed or <br/>
resistent and needs impetus, and he&#39;s fourteen years old, use cash!  Once he <br/>
gets used to the comfort he won&#39;t say &quot;Where&#39;s my dollar?  I&#39;m 19 and I took <br/>
a shower.&quot;  He won&#39;t ask his future wife to pay him to shower, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666402118">Very true! But a husband (hopefully) has a longer-term and less selective memory than a 7yr old. My boys told me their biggest problem was that they forgot they weren&#39;t supposed to hit. A nice cheerful reminder of what is expected worked wonders and kept everyone happy. They thanked me many times for reminding them, so that they did not forget and end up in trouble or hurt. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921601011">I chose foam hearts because a heart stands for love, they can actually be held and kept as a reminder (vs. using sticker charts, etc) and because a thank you is not enough for my son to be willing to do something. For my son to be willing to do something that goes against what he wants to do, he has to have something that makes it worth his while. Not hitting because it hurts the other person doesn&#39;t work, because hurting someone else IS his goal. He knows he&#39;s being mean, he knows that person won&#39;t want to play with him anymore, but he does not care - he wants what he wants, no matter what. I realize that most kids are not like this, just thought our method might work for others.<br/>

Oh my God I&#39;m am totally agreeing with Ren! &lt;BG&gt; I too had a problem with my <br/>
Joseph and Sierra fighting. They are 13 months apart and sometimes went at <br/>
it like pro&#39;s. I did what Sandra suggested and it&#39;s been maybe 2 weeks?? but <br/>
there is a definite difference in our house between the two of them. Some of <br/>
it does come from age too as I see Sierra doing things that Joseph did a <br/>
while ago and doesn&#39;t do anymore. Just being more considerate from I guess a <br/>
kind of maturity, for lack of a better word. I&#39;m sure it all goes around <br/>
with what we&#39;ve been doing and how they&#39;ve been addressed.<br/>
<br/>
And I have never been one to like the whole reward thing and Alfie just <br/>
reinforced what I had always thought anyway. Good book even if you believe <br/>
it already. Kind of gave me the whys instead of the just I don&#39;ts.<br/>

big kids, and I would love to have one of them be three for a day or two, or <br/>
an hour, or a minute.<br/>
<br/>
And now I cried.    They&#39;re all not even in the house right now.  Kirby&#39;s at <br/>
work, Marty&#39;s helping an adult friend of mine unload a truck (for money and <br/>
lunch!) and Holly&#39;s off riding bikes with another homeschooler.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to go read a magazine and feel sorry for myself and wish I had some <br/>
little kids to come wake me up from a nap.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857442025">I must be missing some e-mails, I never got the originals for a lot of these. I have read this book, it sounds like wonderful ideas, but none of them worked for my 7yo. <br/>
<br/>
These kinds of things are based on the assumption that children basically WANT to do what is right and WANT to make parents, siblings, and others happy. My son does not. He WANTS to cause turmoil, problems, and WANTS to hurt others. He gets worse as he gets older with this, not better. That is what ODD does. Not fun to live with. <br/>

<br/>
  Oh my God I&#39;m am totally agreeing with Ren! &lt;BG&gt; I too had a problem with my <br/>
  Joseph and Sierra fighting. They are 13 months apart and sometimes went at <br/>
  it like pro&#39;s. I did what Sandra suggested and it&#39;s been maybe 2 weeks?? but <br/>
  there is a definite difference in our house between the two of them. Some of <br/>
  it does come from age too as I see Sierra doing things that Joseph did a <br/>
  while ago and doesn&#39;t do anymore. Just being more considerate from I guess a <br/>
  kind of maturity, for lack of a better word. I&#39;m sure it all goes around <br/>
  with what we&#39;ve been doing and how they&#39;ve been addressed.<br/>
<br/>
  And I have never been one to like the whole reward thing and Alfie just <br/>
  reinforced what I had always thought anyway. Good book even if you believe <br/>
  it already. Kind of gave me the whys instead of the just I don&#39;ts.<br/>

I was just thinking these kinds of thoughts! It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s been that long when I was the mom of young kids looking up to  families that had teens and thinking &#39;wow, they&#39;re so together and have such great kids&#39;, sheesh, I blink a couple of times and now families with young kids are looking at me that way!!!  I can have a complete conversation with dh, I can read chapters at a time in a book without being interrupted, nobody needs help getting dressed or making lunch,  I hardly ever get woken at night (though the girls had a friend stay over last night I had woke up to giggles a few times).  They really don&#39;t stay little long do they?!  But what fun they are as big kids!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539523968">Ah, I finally got this post! These things are coming in weird order. You&#39;re right, for most kids, I suppose. As I said in previous posts, though, my son has to have this. Before we started this, I had to literally watch him every second he was in the room with his brother, or little brother was always getting bumps, bruises, cuts, and worse. Much less work this way, and his self-control has improved in other areas since we started this. <br/>
Myranda<br/>
  From: Kelli Traaseth <br/>
  This sounds like an awful lot of work for the Mom, and not enough self <br/>
  control from the children.<br/>
  Parental involvement from moment to moment is necessary with children that <br/>
  are having a problem with this, but that doesn&#39;t mean constant monitoring of <br/>
  behavior. They&#39;ll never learn the control from within from the above <br/>
  mentioned methods.<br/>
  And I do not like rewarding kids with stars, hearts or other false methods of <br/>
  control.<br/>
  Read &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn.<br/>
<br/>
  I really, really like Sandra&#39;s suggestions on this.<br/>
  I have really worked with my two middle children on how to handle things with <br/>
  words.<br/>
  When one of them starts a fight, I step in and start dialoguing with them <br/>
  about how they could say it different to avoid future hurts.<br/>
  It is slow going, but I just heard Trevor yell &quot;Sierra come pick up your crap <br/>
  of my floor&quot; in a not very nice voice. She said &quot;you are trying to start a <br/>
  fight&quot; and he answered &quot;please come pick up the stuff you left in here&quot;. Wow!<br/>
  They are listening to each other&#39;s signals. They are being analytical (even <br/>
  at five) and while I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ll never have another fight, I do see <br/>
  skills blossoming without flase rewards or constant monitoring.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I know those of you with toddlers are hoping for them to GET BIG, but I <br/>
have big kids, and I would love to have one of them be three for a day or <br/>
two, or an hour, or a minute.<br/>
<br/>
And now I cried. They&#39;re all not even in the house right now.  Kirby&#39;s at <br/>
work, Marty&#39;s helping an adult friend of mine unload a truck (for money and <br/>
lunch!) and Holly&#39;s off riding bikes with another homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to go read a magazine and feel sorry for myself and wish I had <br/>
some<br/>
little kids to come wake me up from a nap.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Man Sandra, are you psychic or what??? Scary if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was thinking and not sleeping like I should have been but it <br/>
was like every other night I have. I was going to post sometime today and <br/>
ask if those of you who have older kids ever miss the days when they were <br/>
little. Does it bother you that the kids are growing up and not needing like <br/>
they do when they are young? Do you ever think about it all or is it just a <br/>
natural progression with just the good memories and no sad feelings?<br/>
<br/>
I really would love to have another baby. My husband is the practical one <br/>
this time around (will wonders never cease?) and reminds me that we have <br/>
already out grown the house of 2 years. Plus I&#39;m getting up there in age and <br/>
I had a hard time and almost lost Alyssa. Things that don&#39;t bother me but <br/>
really bother my husband. He&#39;s the one that almost didn&#39;t make it through!!!<br/>
<br/>
My &#39;baby&#39; will be 2 in a couple of weeks and it&#39;s on my mind that although <br/>
she&#39;s &#39;only&#39; two, she&#39;s already two!!!! I can&#39;t imagine not having a little <br/>
one around.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and our oldest have a little joke between the two of them. <br/>
Whenever I talk about the kids growing up, they both say that soon they&#39;ll <br/>
be all off to college. Then they say they better stop cause mom will start <br/>
crying soon!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I guess you answered my question but it wasn&#39;t what I wanted to hear.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; often way more <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was me.  I&#39;m quoting myself to clarify.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah!  Knowing why the kid is hitting is important too, but you can&#39;t always <br/>
know (and they don&#39;t always know).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that explaining/discussing with kids why hitting is to be <br/>
avoided is more important than telling them not to hit.  Because the &quot;why&quot; <br/>
includes more things than hitting.  And it can be generalized, by them, to <br/>
other situations which are verbal or physical or involve food, or...  If it&#39;s <br/>
about consideration, and peace and safety...<br/>
<br/>
Helping them learn that they can figure out what the &quot;rules&quot; are without <br/>
having so many rules helps us as adults remember it too, I think.  Learning <br/>
to use good judgment and basing decisions on principles instead of just <br/>
checking some memorized list of prohibitions makes life richer and more <br/>
thoughtful for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m experessing myself very well, but I&#39;m really sleepy, so I <br/>
should let Marty have the computer back, kiss Holly good night and crawl into <br/>
a warm dark place.  Sounds great!<br/>

example, can&#39;t live without at least 4 Extra Strength Tylenol and one<br/>
shot of Imitrex (migraine shot) a day (and this is just what she admits<br/>
to).  She has no idea whatsoever what is causing her pain, she just<br/>
masks it.  Over and over and over again.  When I lived with her, I<br/>
learned to mask all my aches and pains with Tylenol, too.  Now that I am<br/>
an adult, I have learned to figure out what is causing the pain, fix it,<br/>
and miraculously the pain goes away and I don&#39;t need _any_ sort of pain<br/>
killing drug to ease my woes.  :)  We&#39;ve been raised in a &quot;one pill<br/>
cures all&quot; society.  There are even commercials touting this and most<br/>
doctors agree to it.  Mask the symptoms of what ails you and you can<br/>
continue your day as if nothing was ever wrong with your body.  Ugh. <br/>
It&#39;s the same thinking of spank the kid if he hits, but don&#39;t bother to<br/>
ask them why they hit.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*We* parents may not be able to sure about the reasons a child does <br/>
something, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s entirely the point.  I can remember my <br/>
folks angrily asking me for the reasons behind my misbehavior when I was <br/>
little, and all I could come up with was, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  And, I didn&#39;t <br/>
know.  But, maybe I did or could have known.  Maybe without the pressure of <br/>
having to justify my actions under duress and the threat of getting the <br/>
&quot;belt,&quot; I could have learned more about myself in the process.  But, would <br/>
it have been good enough to appease my angry mom and dad?  Probably <br/>
not.  So why even bother?<br/>
<br/>
I think when we help our kids brainstorm to find their reasons, we are <br/>
helping them understand and trust themselves (and us) better, not for our <br/>
sake but for theirs!  I *still* don&#39;t understand why I do what I do <br/>
sometimes.  And that&#39;s because (I think) I was taught that my reasons <br/>
didn&#39;t matter.  I think my son (almost 8 y.o.) may have a better grip on <br/>
his reasons because he has not had to justify himself to me.  (Pardon the <br/>
muddled rambling here.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m making any sense at all!)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my son was very small someone mentioned to me (or perhaps I read it) <br/>
that the kindness we show our children when they are small is an investment <br/>
we make in the care of our grandchildren.  So, while your husband and <br/>
extended family may not get it at all, your children are getting an <br/>
excellent education in parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I think it also may help to remember that we cannot control anyone else; <br/>
the only person we have any control over at all is ourselves.  The valuable <br/>
gift you are giving to your children is your demonstration of compassion <br/>
towards others.  I would bet that they are not missing it, either.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know if this makes any sense at all; I&#39;m sitting here in my <br/>
pajamas working the &quot;graveyard shift.&quot;  I hope this helps a little, though.<br/>

don&#39;t know). I observe things and will make comments like, you seem really upset<br/>
or Kyle is really bugging you (being fully open to him saying no you are wrong).<br/>
<br/>
I use my guess at the why more for keeping my calm. It is much easier for me to<br/>
deal with a kid who is tired, who is ticked at his brother, who needs more<br/>
attention then to deal with a kid who is &quot;disrespectful&quot; (my dh&#39;s big hot button),<br/>
&quot;mean&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. Just because I  understand (or think that I understand) the why<br/>
does not mean that I let the behavior continue...it does give me more info to<br/>
use in handling the problem though.<br/>
