<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021186203">A friend of mine was contacted by the Paramount (L.A. County)<br/>
California school district regarding her R-4.  The lady told her she <br/>
received a copy of it through the state.  She then informed her that <br/>
the only legal way for her to homeschool is:  1. To be a credentialed <br/>
teacher  2. Hire a tutor  3. Be enrolled in a private school paying <br/>
tuition and homeschool through the private school or  4. If R-4 is <br/>
filed my friend would then have to charge tuition and educate other <br/>
children too. 5.  Or enroll in Paramont&#39;s school district I.S.P.  <br/>
<br/>
I know this it totally bogus.  She also told her she was sending her <br/>
a copy of a court case that supports her interpretation of the R-4.  <br/>
Unfortunatly, she didn&#39;t get the case name or # and we are waiting <br/>
for that to come in the mail.  Until then, please left me know all <br/>
info. we can give to this misinformed person.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Laura</div>
