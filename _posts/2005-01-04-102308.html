<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282752904">Majesty (a castle sim), Zoombinis, Scooby-Doo, Spyfox, Spiderman, Magic <br/>
Schoolbus, Carmen SanDiego and Cluefinders are all *huge* hits here that <br/>
are non-violent. We also have a couple of Lego games that are fun, but <br/>
*very* glitchy, as are the Sim Kids games that we have, so they don&#39;t <br/>
get played with as much.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhat violent, but not blood and gore, are Age of Empires and Age of <br/>
Mythology, which my kids really love to play with dh. They are somewhat <br/>
advanced, but I&#39;m thinking the 9 yo in particular would be able to catch <br/>
on pretty easily--probably the 7 yo too, if he&#39;s pretty techno-savvy.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that&#39;s helpful. We get lots of ours in bundles at Sam&#39;s Club. <br/>
They&#39;re often the last generation, but my kids don&#39;t care about cutting <br/>
edge at this point at 4, 6 and 7.<br/>

<br/>
----------<br/>
 <br/>
Marty played Age of Empires a whole lot.  <br/>
 <br/>
Zoombinis, always good.<br/>
 <br/>
There are &quot;preschool&quot; games that are still fun for older kids.  My  kids are <br/>
still &quot;pre-school&quot; (except Kirby starts some classes on Monday,  spoiling his <br/>
never-been-to-school streak, not counting driver&#39;s ed for eight  days once).   <br/>
There are arts games and puzzle games and one Holly  liked tons called &quot;Third <br/>
Grade Adventure.&quot;  Some puzzles are kind of like  Zoombinis.<br/>
 <br/>
Some of the games my kids played a lot are defunct now, I think.   Playroom, <br/>
Treehouse and Backyard.   They&#39;d be playing them still,  maybe, if we had them <br/>
for more modern computers.<br/>
 <br/>
Holly still throws PuttPutt in there sometimes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024737896">Wanted to add...check out Ebay for games.  We&#39;ve bought our versions  of <br/>
KidPix, Zoombini&#39;s, Scooby Doo, and ClueFinders for a 10th of what we paid in  <br/>
stores...sometimes less than 2.00 a game.  Often they&#39;re not the latest  version, <br/>
but at least you can check them out and see which are really enjoyed,  then <br/>
invest in the newer versions.  <br/>

Logical Journey of the Zoombinis   - the original is best, the third island <br/>
one hardly got any play time around here. The original however had every adult <br/>

They wouldn&#39;t let me put away Putt Putt or any of the other Humongous titles <br/>
either. Spy Fox was a lot of fun.<br/>

My best advice though is to borrow software whenever you can to try it out. <br/>
Many libraries carry software programs these days - we used them a lot as a <br/>
sort of &quot;try before you buy&quot; deal. :)<br/>

Oh yes!  Holly too.<br/>
 <br/>
When Kirby was little he designed a Ninja Turtle sword rubber stamp on  that, <br/>
and it was deleted.  We&#39;ve always been a little sorry to have lost  that.  It <br/>
was his first elaborate pixel art.<br/>
 <br/>
The things they learned playing with KidPix  have transferred really  well to <br/>
other draw programs and Adobe Photo and such.    They  just know what the <br/>
range of options is and how the mouse and menus work in  general, and I think <br/>
it&#39;s because KidPix was so fun and easy.<br/>

----------------<br/>
 <br/>
Oh!<br/>
We had lost one of the original three Thinking Things, and Holly got me to  <br/>
buy a replacement last summer.  I think I got it used from someone who had  <br/>
listed it with Amazon.  She&#39;s 13 and still likes those.<br/>
 <br/>
Any of these games, like toys, are good different ways at different  ages.  <br/>
If a game itself seems too easy for Holly, she still likes to look  at the art, <br/>
and figure out how they might&#39;ve made it better.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty mentioned Wishbone&#39;s Odyssey game just last night for some reason,  <br/>
something he played quit a bit when he was eight or so.<br/>
 <br/>
We have Schoolhouse Rock, Grammar Rock, which has the videos and also some  <br/>
games.<br/>
 <br/>
The most beautiful game I ever saw, for art, was a Peter Rabbit game.   It <br/>
can be set to British or American English.  I hadn&#39;t thought of that for  years. <br/>
 Now that Holly&#39;s way into the differences in English, maybe I  should hunt <br/>
that down and remind her about that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782315447">Hey, Lisa   :)<br/>
<br/>
**Do the Zoombinis games run effectively on Mac OS/X and up?  They look<br/>
like a whole lot of fun, but I fear they&#39;d crash on our machines.**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ve ever run them on X, we&#39;ve got them installed <br/>
on a Mac running OS9. Want to try them? :)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve unfortunately had to retire a few much beloved older games that weren&#39;t <br/>
updated and couldn&#39;t make the leap over several operating systems. The most <br/>
notable was Dino Park Tycoon which just won&#39;t run correctly on anything we&#39;ve <br/>
got in operating condition. It opens but is missing vital screen elements. <br/>
Quite frustrating!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, another game that got a lot of play was Treasure Mathstorm. I thought it <br/>
was lame but they really got a kick out of it for awhile. Just goes to show <br/>
you never know... <br/>

and place (tens, hundreds), but visually presented.<br/>
