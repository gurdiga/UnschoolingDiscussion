<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854023353">No, they don&#39;t.  They belong to God.<br/>

But this is a valid argument only between people who believe in G-d. And for<br/>
those people, not one of them knows for sure what G-d thinks on the subject.<br/>
Personally, I would rather debate this issue based on how human beings<br/>
relate to one another, rather than on  continuously coming back to &quot;Because<br/>
G-d wills it or Because it&#39;s what the bible says.&quot; Maybe it&#39;s because I<br/>
don&#39;t know how to debate those lines. Maybe because I don&#39;t like to assume<br/>
that every one on our planet believes in the Christian bible. Maybe because<br/>
I see a deeper issue than spanking which is how to show respect for other<br/>
living creatures.<br/>
