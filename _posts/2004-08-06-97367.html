<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086360096">&lt;&lt;&lt;There is a difference with this particular issue, which is that it is not<br/>
legal in the US for minors to drink alcohol.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Replying here to myself :)<br/>
<br/>
After reading another post about Texas, I decided I was making ill informed<br/>
statements (Sorry all, I should know better) and set out to do some<br/>
research. I googled &quot;Minimum legal drinking age&quot; and discovered a wealth of<br/>
information, history, opinion, bias, statistics skewed in all directions and<br/>
a general huge labrynthian controversy, as is probably typical of any public<br/>
policy issue. <br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of it focuses on drinking and driving, and the many<br/>
websites seem to focus on preventing collegiate underage drinking. Medical<br/>
websites focus on medical statistics, public policy sites focus on attempts<br/>
at the big picture federally and internationally, youth sites focus on<br/>
rights and responsibilities and the issue of federal blackmail, parenting<br/>
sites focus on prevention and communication, law enforcement sites focus on<br/>
driving, a few educational radicals have other ideas, and then there are<br/>
sites about addiction/alcoholism in general.<br/>
<br/>
I love the internet!<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly in terms of parents allowing minors to use alcohol in the<br/>
home, so far I have only found (buried in a pdf) the law in California<br/>
(parental supervision in the home when only family is present, or as part of<br/>
religious ceremonies and administered by a parent/guardian), and a general<br/>
statement that &quot;the penalties, if any, vary between States&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
However, a big point is an increasing focus on laws entitled Social Host<br/>
Laws, attempting to stop adults allowing minors other than their own<br/>
children to consume alcohol or drugs in their homes, either in the adults&#39;<br/>
presence or in absentia. No more wild teen parties y&#39;all - hey I&#39;ve seen<br/>
that movie lots of times - the nadir of school culture? Another pop culture<br/>
phenomenon that probably doesn&#39;t apply to Unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
So again back to my original badly stated point. It is useful to have a<br/>
reasonable idea of the law to help you make decisions about your lifestyle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510848402">I did not know it was legal for parents to let their own children consume<br/>
alcohol, but I could see it for religious ceremonies.<br/>
<br/>
I just never even considered that possibility.<br/>

Kristen, off to do more research for PA</div>

Furnishing to Minors:<br/>
<br/>
Adults who sell, furnish, or purchase with the intent to sell or furnish <br/>
alcohol to anyone under 21 (even their own children), or provide them a <br/>
place to consume alcohol will receive a mandatory fine of $1,000 and up to <br/>
$2,500 for each subsequent offense.</div>
