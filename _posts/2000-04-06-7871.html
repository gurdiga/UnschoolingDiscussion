<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137722237">Dear Kim,<br/>
 I don&#39;t remember that moment with reading, but I do remember it with other<br/>
childhood moments. the one that sticks out in my mind is riding a bike. My<br/>
point is that these epiphanies all seem very natural to me.<br/>

&gt; It seems that everyone I talk to can remember a light bulb moment in the<br/>
&gt; process of learning to read - that AHA where you went from painstakingly<br/>
&gt; sounding out words to actually GETTING it.  It&#39;s as if the code is finally<br/>
&gt; broken and you&#39;re seeing the words on the page for what they really are.<br/>
&gt; Mine came while I was reading a Family Circus comic strip.  Thelma (Mom)<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; standing in the bathtub holding a part for the plumber, who is working on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; faucet.  Dolly comes in and says, &quot;That was [so and so] on the phone.  I<br/>
told<br/>
&gt; her you couldn&#39;t talk right now because you are in the bathtub with the<br/>
&gt; plumber.&quot;  I sounded it out, then again, and suddenly I could just READ<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; whole thing without sounding it out at all!   I just looked at all the<br/>
words<br/>
&gt; on the page at once, and they stood on their own, as if they had come to<br/>
&gt; life.  I was 4 at the time, I think.  We were on vacation in Kansas City,<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; a hotel with a pool on the roof, and my sister threw up in the hallway on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; way back to our room after dinner that night.  She&#39;d had fish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can anyone else share their reading epiphany?  I&#39;m still waiting for that<br/>
&gt; moment in my younger son.  Last night I bought him a look-and-find book<br/>
(like<br/>
&gt; Where&#39;s Waldo) without picture clues.  It only has written clues.  He<br/>
&gt; LOOOOOOVES look-and-finds, so I think he just might do it.  I didn&#39;t make<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; production of it, just handed him the book and said &quot;Here, I thought you<br/>
&gt; might like this&quot;.  He opened it up and when he saw that the clues were<br/>
&gt; written his forehead kinda wrinkled up and he took a quick, secret glance<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; me to see what I was going to do.  I pretended I didn&#39;t notice and kept<br/>
&gt; unloading my shopping bags.  He didn&#39;t say a word.  He left the book on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; table, but when I got up this morning I found it peeking out from under<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; pillow.  Hmmmm.<br/>

<div><font size="2">I don&#39;t remember this, it sometimes seems to me as if I was 
born reading!&nbsp; This has led to a heavy reliance and belief in books, which 
has only really been shaken into objectivity by adulthood.&nbsp; Also, I used 
reading as an escape mechanism from the bullying etc I received at school.&nbsp; 
So while it might seem like a good idea if children read alot, there is still 
&#39;too much,&#39; as with tv or chocolate (HERESY!!!) or anything.&nbsp; I know I&#39;ve 
had &#39;lightbulb-moments,&#39; but right now I can&#39;t remember any.&nbsp; I love 
watching when the kids have them though :-)</font></div>
