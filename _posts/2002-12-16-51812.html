<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325927830">Anyone trying to afford a game system and struggling with it, please check <br/>
out your local pawn shops. You can call around to see what they have before <br/>
you go, also check the classifieds in the newspaper.<br/>
We got our entire N64 system, controllers and three games for $50.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are getting the gamecube for Christmas, I can&#39;t wait to see their <br/>
faces!!!<br/>
