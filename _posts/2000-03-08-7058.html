<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927905434">by no means mean to imply that there is one way of doing things that is<br/>
the right way for everyone... I am only trying to find a way that woks<br/>
best for our family... sincerely, <br/>

<br/>
I totally agree that there is not just one way of doing things.  After<br/>
my son was diagnosed ADHD, I read several books(The Explosive Child, How<br/>
to Talk so Kids Will Listen, To Train Up A Child,How To Raise a Happy<br/>
Unspoiled Child, etc.), I attended parenting classes, listened to the<br/>
advice of therapists, etc. What I have ended up doing is trying some of<br/>
the suggestions, eliminating those that don&#39;t work for us , and moving<br/>
on to something else.  For instance, the sticker chart or poker chip<br/>
reward system DOES NOT work for us. It may work for some, but Matthew<br/>
just doesn&#39;t care about rewards.  Positive reinforcement works wonders<br/>
tho.  Guess you just have to treat child rearing like a 12 step program,<br/>
take what you like and leave the rest. Just my 2 cents.  <br/>
