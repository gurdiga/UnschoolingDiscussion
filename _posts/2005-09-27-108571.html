<div id="ygrps-yiv-715445513">Sometimes one makes typos.   I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll all remember that if I ever <br/>
let this book out that I&#39;ve worked on.      But I just got one of those <br/>
good-looking PayPal notices where they&#39;re really fishing for your information.    I <br/>
was thinking they&#39;d done a good job of impersonating PayPal (thought I was still <br/>
going to send it on to the spam police), until I came to this part:<br/>

<br/>
Dear PayPal client,<br/>
<br/>
      While performing it&#39;s regular scheduled monthly billing address check <br/>
our system found incompatible information which seams to be no longer the same <br/>
with your current credit card information that we have on file.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
its, not &quot;it&#39;s&quot;<br/>
and should be <br/>
seems, not &quot;seams&quot; (which only exist in sewing and shipbuilding and such <br/>
endeavors)<br/>
<br/>
Am I bad to have thought that &quot;real&quot; official information should have been <br/>
written by someone hired to write, and proofread before it went out?   <br/>
Spelling&#39;s not everything, but if any of you aspire to criminality, remember that <br/>
prejudice is natural and you&#39;ll catch more flies with well-spelled scams.<br/>
<br/>
And this, later in the same paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Choosing to ignore this message will result in to a temporary suspension <br/>
of your account within 24 hours, until you will choose to solve this unpleasant <br/>
situation.-=-<br/>
<br/>
WHAT!?   <br/>
Now I would have to address prejudice against foreigners, and that&#39;s just not <br/>
nice.   <br/>
<br/>
So let me amend my earlier advice.   Scam artists might want to get native <br/>
English speakers to proofread.<br/>
<br/>
But at least there was an apology:<br/>
<br/>
-=- We apologies for any inconvinience this may caused you-=-<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my bringing this to the <br/>
unschooling discussion list.<br/>
