<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042771560">**********It&#39;s Elvis&#39;s birthday.  He&#39;s dead, so he doesn&#39;t care, but <br/>
it would have been his birthday.**************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Elvis isn&#39;t dead.  He just went home.&quot;<br/>

 I couldn&#39;t resist : )<br/>

And our Xmas list was really heavy on the movies/video stuff...<br/>
 (Firefly, Sherlock Holmes, Hogans Heros 2nd season, Madagascar, <br/>
Oceans 11/12, Much Ado about Nothing and The &lt;original&gt; Grinch)<br/>
with no appologies!   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146855055">My husband grew up with a mom who LOVED Elvis...he really likes Elvis  too.  <br/>
He has a BUNCH of his movies and believe it or not, the kids don&#39;t  mind them <br/>
too much...<br/>
 <br/>
My favorite is GI Blues...LOL...It has a lot of &quot;travel info&quot; on Germany  <br/>
(kinda like the Hawaii movie) as that&#39;s where it&#39;s set.  <br/>

  Basically..a guy auctioned up his Elvis memorabilia collection to try to win back his girlfriend. <br/>
   <br/>
  I think that&#39;s sad..giving up a part of his self to please someone else. But when we (in general as a society) are raised to please everyone else...please our parents, please our school...there&#39;s no room for the self. It&#39;s hard to regain self once you&#39;ve given it away, and I&#39;m trying to be so much more aware of how I&#39;ve done that and to regain myself, that this just hit me. <br/>

That&#39;s really, really sad.<br/>
 <br/>
And the chances that something like that ---giving up a huge part of <br/>
yourself---something you love---would make someone love you more? It&#39;s just insane.<br/>
 <br/>
He won&#39;t win her back. She&#39;s not really someone he should be trying to win back. Something else would have <br/>
ticked her off before too long anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
He would probably have been happier with Elvis!<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s sad.  She gave him an ultimatum and he made a  choice, <br/>
fully knowing what the consequences would be.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s  wrong to <br/>
choose a person over a thing.  I guess it could be wrong to ASK  someone to give up <br/>
something they love in order to keep the relationship...but  not always.<br/>
 <br/>
I watch this show on A&E called Intervention.  It&#39;s basically a  reality show <br/>
about people who are addicted to something or other and the  intervention <br/>
their loved ones stage to get this person help.  There was a  guy on there who <br/>
was 21 years old and playing video games all day every day and  ignoring his <br/>
family and not pulling his own weight, etc.  He wouldn&#39;t agree  to treatment <br/>
during the intervention until his girlfriend said, &quot;I won&#39;t be able  to take your <br/>
phone calls or answer your emails or talk to you anymore if you  don&#39;t get <br/>
treatment.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
When she said that, he decided it was time to make a change, and he went to  <br/>
treatment.  He chose her over video games.  She gambled and won.  <br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t know the Elvis collector&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s side of the story.  I  have <br/>
a feeling there is more to it than what was in the article.<br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s alcohol or drugs, it&#39;s not a bad thing to ask them to give it  <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a collection of Beatles albums or a bunch of old Barbies,  <br/>
it&#39;s not so good a thing to ask.<br/>
<br/>
If a person is desperate for human affection and gives away umpty- <br/>
thousand dollars worth of Barbies (or sells them) so that the guy  <br/>
will &quot;love&quot; her, what will he demand next year?<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s sitting here sorting through her Barbie food and dishes.   <br/>
Very sweet stuff.  Any guy who would say &quot;I&#39;ll marry you if you get  <br/>
rid of your Barbies and My Little Ponies and your CDs of 60&#39;s music&quot;  <br/>
would be a selfish bastard.  Of course if Holly decided she wanted to  <br/>
become a nun and for that she herself voluntarily for spiritual  <br/>
reasons gave up that stuff, that would be Holly&#39;s choice.  And it  <br/>
would be Holly&#39;s choice if she sold the stuff to marry a guy too, but  <br/>
Holly&#39;s not a desperate person.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d give up having cats to be with someone who had allergies.<br/>

I already said that a person who really loved me might not be showing it if  <br/>
they ask me to give up something I truly love.<br/>
 <br/>
But some people&#39;s collections go too far and they&#39;re too obsessed with it  <br/>
and it interferes in relationships and I don&#39;t see a thing wrong with asking  <br/>
them to stop or get rid of or do something that doesn&#39;t involve the collection  <br/>
for once.  Some people have reached their limit with what they can tolerate  <br/>
of their beloved&#39;s collecting.  Collections and obsessions and intense  <br/>
interests can be as disruptive to relationships as chemical  addicitions.<br/>
 <br/>

I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s what was happening.  I think there&#39;s more  to the <br/>
Elvis memoribilia thing.  Definitely not what was happening with the  guy on <br/>
the show.<br/>
 <br/>
People over things.  <br/>
