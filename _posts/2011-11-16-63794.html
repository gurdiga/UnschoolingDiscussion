<div id="ygrps-yiv-318794183">Hi.  My name is Amy.  Currently, I homeschool a 10 yr old girl and an 11 yr old boy.  This is our 2nd year of homeschooling.  Prior to that, they were both in a private Catholic school.<br/>
<br/>
My son had been diagnosed in 1st grade for various learning disabilites.  As the years passed, it became increasingly difficult for him to keep up with the rest of the class.  This meant hours of homework every night.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter tended to lose focus easily on schoolwork which also meant lots of homework for her.<br/>
<br/>
I know by state standards they would not be where they should be.  Of course, when they were in school that was also the case.  In math, I have my daughter working a 2nd grade level and my son at a 3rd grade level.  All of us are happy with our math program and would probably not choose to unschool in that area.  <br/>
<br/>
I LOVE the idea of unschooling, but does it always work with every child.  My son is not extremely self motivated.  He loves learning, but he wants me to tell him what to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I just have the wrong idea of what unschooling is.  I am not the most motivated person myself.  I feel like if I don&#39;t have a teachers manual telling me what to do, I might miss something.  Or worse yet, we may just sit in the house and do literally nothing.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone out there who has been in my shoes?  Whatever advice you can offer about making a transition from homeschooling to unschooling would be helpful.  Right now, I feel like I have just enough knowledge of unschooling to be dangerous.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Sure, lots of people have gone through what you are describing!  So many, that Sandra has a page just for deschooling!  It&#39;s a process that is crucial for unschooling to flourish!  Here&#39;s a quote from that page:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Stop thinking schoolishly. Stop acting teacherishly. Stop talking about learning as though it’s separate from life.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
If math continues to be separate and apart from the rest of learning and life, unschooling won&#39;t be as awesome as it could be!  There is a documentary that I love called &quot;Between The Folds&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.greenfusefilms.com/">http://www.greenfusefilms.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
What I love about it, is that it clearly demonstrates the inclusiveness of everything together, how science, art, and math are all overlapping and interconnected.  The film is about origami, something seemingly insignificant, yet it&#39;s powerful.  Math doesn&#39;t exist all by itself in a workbook.  It exists and lives in the world.  It IS art, it IS science, it IS beautiful.  Workbook math is such a dull form of math, that it&#39;s no wonder kids come away hating it and curriculum manufacturers come up with tricks to make it more palatable, like adding copious amounts of sugar to papaya seeds to see if you can choke it down.  (papaya seeds should not be eaten, just btw!)<br/>
<br/>
If you need any more convincing, read this:  (it&#39;s long but brilliant)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
If you can apply that to EVERY thing in life, you will be one step closer to getting unschooling!  The world is FULL of wonder and interesting things to explore, but first the parent needs to see that again.  Kids are pretty brilliant about finding it quickly as long as the parents don&#39;t get in the way!<br/>
<br/>
Really take the time to explore the things you normally gloss over.  Check out the very bright red leaf, look at it under a magnifying glass.  Play with candle wax.  Cut out newspaper letters and make ransom style notes, something we&#39;ve been doing over here at my house.  Check out the fonts and ads while you do it, it&#39;s interesting and fun.  Clip out an interesting coupon or two and go and use them at some place you&#39;ve never been.<br/>
<br/>
And THAT is what learning is about; Being interested and interesting, playing with the world around you.  Play a game of hangman, or slap jack, or noodle around with whatever is right in front of you, even if that happens to be noodles that you are cooking for dinner!<br/>

First, stop reciting those things.  Let them fade into obscurity.<br/>

<br/>
If you like the idea of grade levels, and you like the idea of math programs, unschooling not really blossom for you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I LOVE the idea of unschooling, but does it always work with every child. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t work with every parent.  I think a parent who really wants to do it can create a cool situation for any child.<br/>
