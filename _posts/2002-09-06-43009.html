<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986289174">Ok - I&#39;ve been lurking for quite a few months and figure it&#39;s time to do an intro -<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Susan - mom to one ds - 8yo next week!  and identical triplet daughters who just turned 5yo last week.  I pulled my son from a private school last February and the youngest of my trio from ps special ed in May.  Without all the gory details - our&#39;s is a story full of frustration and the crushing of a child&#39;s fragile spirit and a mother&#39;s search for answers when her heart was full of doubt....  <br/>
<br/>
It has taken alot of time to de-school my son and to re-ignite his interest in exploring life and all it has to offer.  He still struggles at times - feeling &quot;too dumb to know anything&quot; (his words) - but those occasions are getting to be a rarity, thankfully.  He has survived mom&#39;s &quot;experimenting&quot; with h/s methodologies - from school-at-home and rigid structure to no structure (and everything in-between).  Though today at my dental appt - it was clear he has developed a new confidence in interacting w/ adults - he fired off questions for the dentist faster than he could answer them - everything from business management (go figure) to various tools and their functions.  As we were leaving the dentist asked him if he wants to be a dentist when he grows up - he told him &quot;Not a chance - I just want to know how your business works!&quot;  Sounds like a budding entrepreneur is in the house.<br/>
  <br/>
My girls having gone through 2.5 yrs of early intervention due to global developmental delays from being preemies and 1 daughter (the &quot;baby&quot; of the trio) has some medical issues including epilepsy - in which medications dulled her mental abilities to near zombie-hood before we connected and switched to full medical treatment & management through our neurological team in MO. (we live in CA).  So, the girls had very &quot;schoolish ideas&quot; of what homeschooling was to be....  I think they are finally over the hump with expecting me to whip out the white board and the worksheets everyday.  It was almost a &quot;visionary-type moment&quot; last week - All the neighborhood kids were preparing to head back to school and they wanted to know when homeschool would start!  Yikes!  I sat down with them at bedtime and explained that kids that go to school only get &quot;x&quot; number of hours in school of &quot;learning time&quot; and that the teacher dictates what and how and how much time they get to learn something - they do not get to play computer games all day (as Timon&#39;s Mazes is their latest passion on the pc) in fact, they might not even get to play on a computer at all! and even if they are really interested in something - the teacher will decide when they are &quot;done&quot; learning about it.  I explained that at home - they can play, veg-out, tv, video, pc, experiment or tinker, etc.  to &quot;learn&quot; from the moment they wake to the moment they fall asleep - and they can focus (or not) on anything they choose....no time limits - no switching &quot;subjects at X:30&quot; etc.  They have all decided free structure homeschool is ok now - and that they actually have more learning time than the &quot;school kids&quot;.  That was a hurdle I never expected to have to jump with them....but now that we&#39;re over it they are much free-er in their play and not consumed with &quot;doing school stuff&quot;.  Amazing the impact societal expectations has on even the youngest child if we allow it!<br/>
<br/>
I struggle with my dh asking - &quot;What are you doing in school with the kids?&quot;  etc and have enjoyed the threads on this topic - perhaps I&#39;ll try the quotes idea....  I also struggle with the &quot;no&quot; thing - though I think I&#39;m getting better.  We still have battles here btwn the kids - I can&#39;t remember which thread I read someone say that doesn&#39;t happen to them?  how do you accomplish that?  My kids love to play and explore together but, they still squabble - call names and even hit each other when tempers flare.  I try to stay out of it and encourage them to work out their differences &quot;verbally&quot; - especially since I don&#39;t always know who the instigator was.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to create a more learning friendly environment - taking things off the high shelves and making stuff as accessible as one can with a puppy in the house.   We have several dolls and plastic animals ho have joined our &quot;medic squad&quot;  with varying injuries and missing parts!  LOL!  Fortunately, gauze and bandages are great fun and the toys are much more patient than the pets are with receiving treatment!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230046297">Wow Susan,<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like your hands are full and your heart as well. I do imagine though <br/>
that all will be fine in your house. Just something in your tone! Welcome to <br/>
unschooling and watching your children enjoy life every day.<br/>

Triplets!  Triplets would be hard for losing the advantage of &quot;rank&quot; and <br/>
experience that you get with varying ages.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  We still have battles here btwn the kids - I can&#39;t remember which thread <br/>
I read someone say that doesn&#39;t happen to them?  how do you accomplish that?  <br/>
. . . .  I try to stay out of it and encourage them to work out their <br/>
differences &quot;verbally&quot; - especially since I don&#39;t always know who the <br/>
instigator was.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I never leave them to work out their own differences.  Never.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s one of the cruelist things a parent or a teacher can do.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one reason we don&#39;t have squabbles, is that squables aren&#39;t okay to <br/>
have.  They can get away from the person and get adult help.   And any adult <br/>
who says &quot;that&#39;s not my problem, you work it out&quot; is aiding and abetting <br/>
bullying, and leaving young children at the mercy of OTHER young children, <br/>
one of the prime complaints of homeschoolers about schools.<br/>
<br/>
I had a cousin live with me who was two years younger and she was MEAN.  <br/>
Vicious.  And she hit, and lied, and was destructive of property.  We <br/>
placated her until she was grown and then we stayed totally away from her.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids need help figuring out HOW to negotiate problems and situations.  They  <br/>
need modelling.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I don&#39;t want my kids saying &quot;That&#39;s not my problem&quot; to me or to <br/>
siblings or friends, I don&#39;t say it to them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I realize your girls are 5 now, but sometimes it helps to know where to <br/>
go to find other folks in similar situations.  So I&#39;ll tell you about my <br/>
friend&#39;s website.  www.thepreemieplace.org  It just celebrated its one <br/>
year anniversary, and they are getting ready to partner with Abbot Labs <br/>
to place computers and resource rooms for parents in every <br/>
NICU-called-something-else in the UK.  That program will be followed on <br/>
in the US in the next year or so.  <br/>
<br/>
And all started by a couple of moms who had preemies and needed the help <br/>
of other moms.<br/>
<br/>
With that, I&#39;m signing off the list, as our house was sold today and I <br/>
only have 24 days to move!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you read Siblings Without Rivalry? Their How To Talk So Kids Will<br/>
Listen book helped me to see things from a child&#39;s point of view so I could<br/>
see how a child&#39;s &quot;irrational&quot; point of view and actions actually made sense<br/>
from their point of view and why my &quot;sensible&quot; point of view made very<br/>
little sense to a child. It will probably help you see the dynamics involved<br/>
more clearly and how the role you&#39;re playing has a different effect than<br/>
sense would suggest it should.<br/>
<br/>
It has lots of practical ideas to try out too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sandra - first I never said - &quot;It&#39;s not my problem&quot;.   I do not use the &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not my problem&quot; response - quite the contrary - I say we must &quot;use our words<br/>
&gt; to work it out&quot;  i.e., not react physically to one another - or be assaultive<br/>
&gt; verbally.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s helpful when reading replies to recognize that people can&#39;t know what<br/>
we mean or what we do, and can only go by what words we use. Replies often<br/>
tend to go beyond specifics of someone&#39;s particular situation to a bigger<br/>
picture discussion of that type of problem. Sometimes from that some people<br/>
can say &quot;Oh, I hadn&#39;t seen it like that before!&quot; Or they can say &quot;Nope,<br/>
doesn&#39;t apply to us.&quot; (But it might apply to someone else who is reading<br/>
along in a similar situation.) Or &quot;Let me explain that a little better.&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can not solve every personal difference they have in life - instead I choose<br/>
&gt; to equip them with the skills (and guidance until the skills are developed) to<br/>
&gt; handle those challenges without losing it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I suspect you *think* you&#39;re offering them the skills for the times they<br/>
squabble -- and undoubtedly *are* doing what seems to make sense -- but it&#39;s<br/>
not getting translated into something that they find meets the needs they<br/>
have in that situation. So they keep falling back on something (squabbling)<br/>
that offers some sort of satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I know you&#39;re saying &quot;Yes, I know it&#39;s not working. I&#39;m asking what<br/>
I should do!&quot; But often when we&#39;re certain we are doing it the right way but<br/>
it isn&#39;t working, it&#39;s because we aren&#39;t seeing things from the child&#39;s<br/>
point of view, only from our own. Which is why I often recommend the How to<br/>
Talk book.<br/>
<br/>
(And I can&#39;t offer anything from personal experience since I only have one<br/>
child!)<br/>
