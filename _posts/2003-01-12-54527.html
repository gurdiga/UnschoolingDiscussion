&lt;&lt; &gt; This is an odd case of &quot;start where you&#39;re not.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you start where you are, you&#39;ll be blocked.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I have realized that. I have to work on my own unschooling, before I can<br/>
effectively encourage my children to live this way. It may just come<br/>
naturally to them. It isn&#39;t to me. As Ren said in an earlier post, we<br/>
have been brainwashed. I am moving on, and look at things differently,<br/>
and &quot;start where you&#39;re not&quot; is a very good suggestion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve used it.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess it will be the title of an essay, coming soon to a homeschooling <br/>
magazine near you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made suggestions in another context (SCA) before to people saying &quot;Just <br/>
jump over here,&quot; and they say &quot;I want to take baby steps,&quot; and I say &quot;No, you <br/>
can see it, just jump there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to see someone not clinging to the right or need to take baby steps. <br/>
 GOOD for your kids!<br/>

I like the idea of a leap of faith, as shown in the movie Joe vs. the<br/>
Volcano.  Sometimes you just have to throw yourself into it.<br/>
<br/>
However, I don&#39;t think being thrown or pushed into the volcano actually<br/>
works as a leap of faith.  It&#39;s gotta mess with the magic, IMHO.<br/>
