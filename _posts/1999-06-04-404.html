<div id="ygrps-yiv-535096330">Gee, I use math all the time in my &quot;real&quot; life..  I think of math<br/>
as a unity, not in individual chunks like &quot;algebra&quot; or<br/>
&quot;geometry&quot;, so I can&#39;t say if it&#39;s specifically algebra, but I<br/>
use patterns in my knitting and crocheting,  look at how things<br/>
change in relationship to each other (like trying to adapt my<br/>
bread recipes for Florida&#39;s summer heat and humidity.  If I<br/>
increase the yeast, what happens to rising time, ultimate size of<br/>
loaves, etc.?)  I&#39;m loving the fact that my second child is<br/>
finally looking at algebra (ask me if you want some great non<br/>
textbook approaches to it) and inviting me along in the journey.<br/>
Number one child did it alone and I missed out!  I hope you&#39;re<br/>
not limiting your chance for delight because your schooling made<br/>
you hate math.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035964881">I have to agree with Carol here that math, including algebra, is inherent in<br/>
life and full of delight. I find it sad and somewhat disturbing to hear<br/>
unschoolers blithely declaring how useless algebra is. I&#39;m convinced that<br/>
any subject can be fascinating if approached at the right time and in the<br/>
right way--higher math included--and I hope to model that excitement and<br/>
delight in learning for my kids. To me, that&#39;s the key to home<br/>
education--modeling learning as enjoyable and wonder-filled--and I think it<br/>
applies to math as well as to reading or writing or ancient history or<br/>
botany or Morse code or Super Mario Brothers...<br/>
