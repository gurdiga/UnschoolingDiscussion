&gt; &gt; &gt; I like the idea of an endless candy bowl, but our budget right <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; VERY tight, and food is a big cut-back for us. Maybe I could do <br/>
&gt; it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if I grabbed a ton of post-Halloween candy. hmmm, as much and more<br/>

there for next to nuthin&#39;.  And couldn&#39;t believe the selection.  <br/>
