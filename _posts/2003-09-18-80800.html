<div id="ygrps-yiv-752476657">Just a reminder that my daughter Meera&#39;s benefit piano recital for the<br/>
Israeli-Palestinian Families of the Bereaved Forum for Peace<br/>
(www.theparentscircle.com) is this Saturday (September 20th) at 7:30<br/>
p.m., at United Churches, 11th and Capital Way, in Olympia.  Suggested<br/>
donation is $10, but no one will be turned away due to lack of funds.<br/>
Kids are especially invited (and, if they are budding musicians, they<br/>
should get a particular kick out of it.)<br/>
<br/>
The representatives of the families themselves -- both Palestinian and<br/>
Israeli -- will be making a presentation at the same location on<br/>
October 4th, at 7:30. Again, all are invited.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
