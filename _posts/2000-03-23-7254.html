<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552707461">Hello, I am new to unschooling--actually to homeschooling period!  My<br/>
son is 8 & 1/2 and has been home since about Feb 1.  He was in public<br/>
school (3rd grade) in Arkansas.  I am so interested in doing this for<br/>
him.  He is a gifted child and extremely bright.  However, he hates<br/>
school!  I need some advice and feedback, I think.  My husband is<br/>
very, very supportive of all of this, but is having trouble with the<br/>
&quot;unstructuredness&quot; of it all.  Both my son and I are similar in that<br/>
we are very unstructured, spontaneous learners, where my husband is<br/>
completely the opposite..very methodical, very routine-oriented.  I<br/>
am trying NOT to push my son.  He is resisting ANY schooling right<br/>
now.  All he seems to want to do is play video games and watch TV! <br/>
He hates to write, for one thing.  Which is one thing he detested<br/>
about school.  I haven&#39;t seemed to find the &quot;spark&quot; for him yet. <br/>
He&#39;s interested in EVERYTHING, it seems.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I am rambling here!  Is there anything wrong with letting my<br/>
son stay up late and sleep late?  My husband seems to think he should<br/>
have a set bedtime and get up early to start his day.  Guess what? <br/>
That doesn&#39;t seem to work with Benjamin (my son).  Which is one of<br/>
the reasons I chose to take him out of public schools!  They seemed<br/>
much more interested in recording attendance than they did<br/>
challenging and stimulating my child!  <br/>
<br/>
I will close for now...not sure if any of this makes sense.  Please<br/>
respond with ANY feedback!  I haven&#39;t found a support group here in<br/>
Northwest Arkansas yet.  We have Christian beliefs, but are not<br/>
&quot;religious&quot;.  HELP!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Pretend it&#39;s summer vacation, or Saturday every day.  A curious child is<br/>
going to learn, he can&#39;t help himself.  Play outside, read together, make<br/>
dinner (or cookies!), search the internet (google!) for your favorite<br/>
subject and have fun clicking away.  Go to the zoo, the park, the beach, a<br/>
museum, the library or wherever thrills you.<br/>
<br/>
I used to sit down at the end of the day and try to think about what was<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; in everything we did.  Legos = problem solving, cooking =<br/>
math, riding a bike with friends = social & exercise, did we read books,<br/>
etc.  If it makes you feel better, it might be a useful exercise now and<br/>
then.  Eventually, I got to the the point where I rarely think that way.<br/>
<br/>
Jump in feet first and have fun!<br/>

I really second this advice! We have moved into unschooling from relaxed homeschooling and the BEST advice we received in making this change was to act as if we were on holiday - read together, watch movies together, play games, go to the park and the library, visit the museum, just live every day life, really - all holiday things for us and now part of every day unschooling life...BTW, we are having the greatest fun with card games atm - just taught myself and the 6 yo Knock Down Whist and he and the next three sons up have been playing this with me at odd moments throughout the day - even at the park yesterday! :-)..Leonie<br/>

have a blast!! Once I learn to relax :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053167914">Go ahead and let him continue summer while you take the next six months <br/>
or so to research this. Of course, if something really interesting comes <br/>
up, you can drop the research for a little while to go somewhere or do <br/>
something, so it may take you &#39;til June. But &#39;til then, just let him <br/>
continue summer.<br/>

Pretend you&#39;re on a really great vacation. Find out all the interesting <br/>
things to see, do and visit in your local area and then see, do and visit <br/>
them. Go see some movies. Read some great new books together. Play around, <br/>
answer his questions, ask some of your own. Hike, swim, bike, skate, lounge, <br/>
giggle, enjoy. Oh and forget to worry about that curriculum because you&#39;re <br/>
having such a great vacation. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
