<div><font color="#000080" size="2">There is an email going around email circles 
that &quot;warns&quot; about Harry Potter.&nbsp; I am enclosing it for your information -

<div><font color="#000080" size="2">THE EMAIL THAT IS CIRCULATING:</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">This information is written by a Pastor... 
<br><br>FYI Harry Potter Books? <br><br><br>This is the most evil thing I have 
laid my eyes ... and no one seems to understand its threat. The Harry Potter 
books are THE NUMBER ONE selling children&#39;s books in the nation today. Just look 
at any Barnes &amp; Noble or Waldenbook storefront. Go to Amazon.com and read 
the reviews. Hear the touting by educators and even Christian teachers about how 
&quot;It&#39;s great to see the youth so eagerly embracing the reading experience!&quot; 
<br><br><br>Harry Potter is the creation of a former UK English teacher who 
promotes witchcraft and Satanism. Harry is a 13 year old &#39;wizard.&#39; Her creation 
openly blasphemes Jesus and God and promotes sorcery, seeking revenge upon 
anyone who upsets them by giving you examples (even the sources with authors and 
titles!) of spells, rituals, and demonic powers. It is the doorway for children 
to enter the Dark Side of evil. <br><br><br>I think the problem is that parents 
have not reviewed the material. The name seems harmless enough... Harry Potter. 
But that is where it all ends. <br><br><br>Let me give you a few quotes from 
some of the influenced readers themselves:<br><br>&quot;The Harry Potter books are 
cool, &#39;cause they teach you all about magic and how you can use it to&nbsp; 
control people and get revenge on your enemies,&quot; said Hartland, WI, 10-year-old 
Craig Nowell, a recent&nbsp;convert to the New Satanic Order Of The Black 
Circle. &quot;I want to learn the Cruciatus Curse, to make my&nbsp;muggle science 
teacher suffer for giving me a D.&quot; [A &#39;muggle&#39; is an&nbsp;unbeliever of magic.] 
<br><br><br>Or how about the REALLY young and innocent impressionable mind of a 
6 year old when asked about her&nbsp;favorite character: <br><br><br>&quot;Hermione 
is my favorite, because she&#39;s smart and has a kitty,&quot; said 6-year-old Jessica 
Lehman of Easley, SC. &quot;Jesus died because He was weak and stupid.&quot; 
<br><br><br>And here is dear Ashley, a 9 year old, the typical average age 
reader of Harry Potter:&nbsp; &quot;I used to believe in what they taught us at 
Sunday School,&quot; said Ashley, conjuring up an ancient spell to&nbsp; summon 
Cerebus, the three-headed hound of hell. &quot;But the Harry Potter books showed me 
that magic is&nbsp; real, something I can learn and use right now, and that the 
Bible is nothing but boring lies.&quot; <br><br><br>DOES THIS GET YOUR ATTENTION!! 
If not, how about a quote from a High Priest of Satanism: <br><br><br>&quot;Harry is 
an absolute godsend to our cause,&quot; said High Priest Egan of the First Church Of 
Satan in&nbsp;Salem, MA. &quot;An organization like ours thrives on new blood - no 
pun intended - and we&#39;ve had more&nbsp;applicants than we can handle lately. 
And, of course, practically all of them are virgins, which is&nbsp;gravy.&quot; 
[Since 1995, open applicants to Satan worship has increased from around 100,000 
to now...&nbsp; 14 MILLION children and young adults!] <br><br><br>It makes me 
physically ill, people! But, I think I can offer you an explanation of why this 
is happening. Children have been&nbsp; bombarded with action, adventure, thrills 
and scares to the point Hollywood can produce nothing new to give them the next 
&#39;high.&#39; Parents have neglected to see what their children are reading and doing, 
and simply seem satisfied that &#39;Little Johnny is interested in reading.&#39; AND... 
educators and the NEA are PUSHING this crap with NO WARNING as to the effects or 
the contents. <br><br><br>Still not convinced? I will leave you with something 
to let you make up your own mind. First the URL to read some background of what 
I have given you: <a rel="nofollow"

( Harry Potter Books Spark Rise In Satanism Among Children ) Click on this site 
to see children from Winter Park. <br><br>And finally, a quote from the author 
herself, J. K. Rowling, describing the objections of Christian reviewers to her 
writings: &quot;I think it&#39;s absolute rubbish to protest children&#39;s books on the 
grounds that they are&nbsp; luring children to Satan,&quot; Rowling told a London 
Times reporter in a July 17 interview. &quot;People should be&nbsp;praising them for 
that! These books guide children to an understanding that<br>the weak, idiotic 
Son Of&nbsp;God is a living hoax who will be humiliated when the rain of fire 
comes,... while we, his faithful&nbsp;servants, laugh and cavort in victory.&quot; 
<br><br><br>My hope is that you will see fit to become involved in getting the 
word out about this garbage. <br><br>Please FWD to every pastor, teacher, and 
parent you know. This author has now published FOUR BOOKS in&nbsp;less than 2 
years of this &#39;encyclopedia of Satanism&#39; and is surely going to write more. 
<br><br><br></font></div></font>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2"><br>THIS IS MY RESPONSE:</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">I must admit, I was quite dismayed to have 
received the recent email regarding Harry Potter. It was, at the least, loaded 
with nothing but opinions (mostly those of children), and at the most a most 
despicable lie.&nbsp; I am a Christian, educated (college degree), protective 
mother, and an avowed Harry Potter fan.&nbsp; As such, I would like to fill you 
in on some facts.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">1) Most disturbing about the email was the 
&quot;quote&quot; by JK Rowling.&nbsp; The email only contained part of the complete 
(disgusting) quote posted at the website link&nbsp;included.&nbsp; This quote is 
100% fabricated and a lie - there was no interview with JK Rowling in the month 
of July in the London Times newspaper. She did not say these things, they are 
total lies to make people believe something that is not true.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">2) The only response I have read that JK has 
made in regards to the lack of Christianity in her books is &quot;then don&#39;t read 
them.&quot; If you truly believe you want to read only books that talk about and 
honor Jesus, then these books are not for you. But never once in any of the 
books is Jesus or God mentioned in either a negative or a positive light.&nbsp; 
It is simply not an issue.&nbsp; Conversely, however, there is no worship of 
Satan either. These are a bunch of kids going to school. In the wizarding world, 
there is a very bad demon, and they do try and keep him &quot;out of power,&quot; but that 
is the extent of any true &quot;power&quot; issues.&nbsp; In fact, the following review 
can be found on Amazon.com:</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica"
 size="-1"><b><i><a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/46980">From Beliefnet</a> 
</i></b><br></font>There are some Christians who view these two activities as a 
contradiction--who think that Hogwarts is worse than hogwash, and that the 
magical scenarios of J.K. Rowling&#39;s imagination are inherently un-Christian. I 
would counter that, instead, these books have the potential to be profoundly 
Christian if readers can see past the medium (magic) to the novels&#39; deeper 
messages about self-sacrifice, the triumph of good over evil, and the glorious 
possibility of human redemption. (Beliefnet, July 2000) </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">3) To quote a group of children about their 
impressions of Harry Potter would be to question the mindless millions that 
watch Nickelodeon channel without the guidance of their parents, or listen to 
various rock groups&nbsp;whose lyrics are not acceptable as opposed to the ones 
that are - they are going to get out of it what they want to, based on their 
moral upbringing and their parental guidance!&nbsp; This is a case of parents 
who neglect to give their children a good moral upbringing, to learn right from 
wrong, and to&nbsp;be well-adjusted human beings. I hardly think the parents of 
the child who said that &quot;Jesus died because He was weak and stupid&quot; are strong 
Christians, nor have they raised their child to follow in Jesus&#39; footsteps. When 
Nickelodeon channel is watched WITH your children, or music listened to and 
discussed WITH your children, you can interpret it together, guide them, and 
learn from it.&nbsp; If you allow them to be mindlessly led by it, you are 
leaving it up to their own interpretation, which generally they are too immature 
to properly make.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">4) The quote from the High Priest Egan of the 
Satanic church - do you really believe he would say &quot;practically all of them are 
virgins, which is gravy?&quot;&nbsp; Do you really think he would say that? And 
besides, what does this have to do with Harry Potter? This is more a sign of our 
times - after all, prayer isn&#39;t allowed in schools any more, remember? The TV 
shows about vampires and evil characters, the scary movies, the&nbsp;rock groups 
that promote &quot;evil&quot; - none of those have anything to do with the increase in 
involvement in Satanic cults, right?</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">5) MANY, MANY educators, Christian and 
non-Christian, are praising the Harry Potter books because they are so 
well-written, interesting and fun that they have encouraged millions of children 
to read!&nbsp; These children, many of whom never had an interest in reading 
before, are not only reading the Potter books, but anything they can get their 
hands on.&nbsp; The reading level of these books is at least that of a high 
school level - even my husband had difficulty with the vocabulary and grammar. 
Think about it - a craze in America led strictly by a book!&nbsp; Not a TV show, 
or a movie, or even driven by commercialism - just simply a book!&nbsp; It&#39;s 
unheard of in our recent cultural history!&nbsp; Yes, unfortunately the 
commercialism will follow, but for now, they have nothing but a 
book.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">6) The &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;wizardry&quot; in these books is 
very simple, and mostly quite harmless.&nbsp; They are not incantations recited 
in a foreign language, they are one word commands for things like illuminating 
their wand, etc.&nbsp; The higher magic comes in only during the fight of good 
vs. evil, which is very black and white here. There are the bad guys and the 
good guys, and it&#39;s pretty obvious which are which.&nbsp; There is no devil 
worship. The email indicates that the books lists spells and cites sources with 
authors and book titles.&nbsp; Hello people - this is fiction! There are no such 
books - these are fictional books that JK Rowling has made up as part of a 
story!&nbsp;&nbsp; And do keep this in mind - it is just a book, a work of 
fiction!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">7) Censorship - this country was founded on 
people looking for freedom! The freedom to make their own decisions about their 
lives, not have the government tell them what to believe, how to worship, and 
what to read!&nbsp; Censorship is tantamount to communism, and ESPECIALLY as 
homeschoolers, should be one of our biggest fears in life! This is why we 
homeschool - because we don&#39;t want to go along with the masses, we question the 
norm, and make our own decisions!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">8) Harry Potter himself is an EXCELLENT role 
model for children!&nbsp; He is totally un-self-centered, generous, thinks 
nothing of putting himself in danger for the sake of his friends, is a good 
student, and other than being a procrastinator (as shown mildly in book #4), has 
no other major faults! I have no problem with my children emulating Harry! 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">What concerns me most here is the fact that the 
people who initiated this email are ignorant of the Harry Potter books - they 
obviously have not read them, have not quoted reliable sources, and have made up 
actual lies.&nbsp; And these lies are being spread to people like you&nbsp;and 
other parents who have not read the books.&nbsp; I know of no intelligent person 
who has read the books (whether they personally liked them or not) that think 
they are EVIL.&nbsp; Before we go and help the authors of these ignorant emails 
by spreading their word, we need to research and investigate the topic in 
further detail. Otherwise, other parents might be influenced to a degree that 
they not allow their children to read these books. If the parents themselves 
have personally read the books and come to the decision that they prefer their 
children not read the books, then I truly and utterly respect their decision - 
they are the parents and it is their decision.&nbsp; However, if the parents 
have not read the books, they will be led by&nbsp;the &quot;recommendations&quot; of these 
crackpots, and then I think it&#39;s a shame and a loss for all 
concerned.</font></div>

<br/>
There is an email going around email circles that &quot;warns&quot; about Harry<br/>
Potter.  I am enclosing it for your information - first is the email I<br/>
received, and following that is my educated response.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THE EMAIL THAT IS CIRCULATING:<br/>
This information is written by a Pastor... <br/>
<br/>
FYI Harry Potter Books? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the most evil thing I have laid my eyes ... and no one seems to<br/>
understand its threat. The Harry Potter books are THE NUMBER ONE selling<br/>
children&#39;s books in the nation today. Just look at any Barnes & Noble or<br/>
Waldenbook storefront. Go to Amazon.com and read the reviews. Hear the<br/>
touting by educators and even Christian teachers about how &quot;It&#39;s great to<br/>
see the youth so eagerly embracing the reading experience!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter is the creation of a former UK English teacher who promotes<br/>
witchcraft and Satanism. Harry is a 13 year old &#39;wizard.&#39; Her creation<br/>
openly blasphemes Jesus and God and promotes sorcery, seeking revenge upon<br/>
anyone who upsets them by giving you examples (even the sources with<br/>
authors and titles!) of spells, rituals, and demonic powers. It is the<br/>
doorway for children to enter the Dark Side of evil. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is that parents have not reviewed the material. The<br/>
name seems harmless enough... Harry Potter. But that is where it all ends. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me give you a few quotes from some of the influenced readers<br/>
themselves:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Harry Potter books are cool, &#39;cause they teach you all about magic and<br/>
how you can use it to  control people and get revenge on your enemies,&quot;<br/>
said Hartland, WI, 10-year-old Craig Nowell, a recent convert to the New<br/>
Satanic Order Of The Black Circle. &quot;I want to learn the Cruciatus Curse, to<br/>
make my muggle science teacher suffer for giving me a D.&quot; [A &#39;muggle&#39; is an<br/>
unbeliever of magic.] <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or how about the REALLY young and innocent impressionable mind of a 6 year<br/>
old when asked about her favorite character: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hermione is my favorite, because she&#39;s smart and has a kitty,&quot; said<br/>
6-year-old Jessica Lehman of Easley, SC. &quot;Jesus died because He was weak<br/>
and stupid.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here is dear Ashley, a 9 year old, the typical average age reader of<br/>
Harry Potter:  &quot;I used to believe in what they taught us at Sunday School,&quot;<br/>
said Ashley, conjuring up an ancient spell to  summon Cerebus, the<br/>
three-headed hound of hell. &quot;But the Harry Potter books showed me that<br/>
magic is  real, something I can learn and use right now, and that the Bible<br/>
is nothing but boring lies.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DOES THIS GET YOUR ATTENTION!! If not, how about a quote from a High Priest<br/>
of Satanism: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Harry is an absolute godsend to our cause,&quot; said High Priest Egan of the<br/>
First Church Of Satan in Salem, MA. &quot;An organization like ours thrives on<br/>
new blood - no pun intended - and we&#39;ve had more applicants than we can<br/>
handle lately. And, of course, practically all of them are virgins, which<br/>
is gravy.&quot; [Since 1995, open applicants to Satan worship has increased from<br/>
around 100,000 to now...  14 MILLION children and young adults!] <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It makes me physically ill, people! But, I think I can offer you an<br/>
explanation of why this is happening. Children have been  bombarded with<br/>
action, adventure, thrills and scares to the point Hollywood can produce<br/>
nothing new to give them the next &#39;high.&#39; Parents have neglected to see<br/>
what their children are reading and doing, and simply seem satisfied that<br/>
&#39;Little Johnny is interested in reading.&#39; AND... educators and the NEA are<br/>
PUSHING this crap with NO WARNING as to the effects or the contents. <br/>

And finally, a quote from the author herself, J. K. Rowling, describing the<br/>
objections of Christian reviewers to her writings: &quot;I think it&#39;s absolute<br/>
rubbish to protest children&#39;s books on the grounds that they are  luring<br/>
children to Satan,&quot; Rowling told a London Times reporter in a July 17<br/>
interview. &quot;People should be praising them for that! These books guide<br/>
children to an understanding that<br/>
the weak, idiotic Son Of God is a living hoax who will be humiliated when<br/>
the rain of fire comes,... while we, his faithful servants, laugh and<br/>
cavort in victory.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My hope is that you will see fit to become involved in getting the word out<br/>
about this garbage. <br/>
<br/>
Please FWD to every pastor, teacher, and parent you know. This author has<br/>
now published FOUR BOOKS in less than 2 years of this &#39;encyclopedia of<br/>
Satanism&#39; and is surely going to write more. <br/>

<br/>
THIS IS MY RESPONSE:<br/>
 <br/>
I must admit, I was quite dismayed to have received the recent email<br/>
regarding Harry Potter. It was, at the least, loaded with nothing but<br/>
opinions (mostly those of children), and at the most a most despicable lie.<br/>
 I am a Christian, educated (college degree), protective mother, and an<br/>
avowed Harry Potter fan.  As such, I would like to fill you in on some<br/>
facts.<br/>
<br/>
1) Most disturbing about the email was the &quot;quote&quot; by JK Rowling.  The<br/>
email only contained part of the complete (disgusting) quote posted at the<br/>
website link included.  This quote is 100% fabricated and a lie - there was<br/>
no interview with JK Rowling in the month of July in the London Times<br/>
newspaper. She did not say these things, they are total lies to make people<br/>
believe something that is not true.  <br/>
 <br/>
2) The only response I have read that JK has made in regards to the lack of<br/>
Christianity in her books is &quot;then don&#39;t read them.&quot; If you truly believe<br/>
you want to read only books that talk about and honor Jesus, then these<br/>
books are not for you. But never once in any of the books is Jesus or God<br/>
mentioned in either a negative or a positive light.  It is simply not an<br/>
issue.  Conversely, however, there is no worship of Satan either. These are<br/>
a bunch of kids going to school. In the wizarding world, there is a very<br/>
bad demon, and they do try and keep him &quot;out of power,&quot; but that is the<br/>
extent of any true &quot;power&quot; issues.  In fact, the following review can be<br/>
found on Amazon.com:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From Beliefnet <br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are some Christians who view these two activities as a<br/>
contradiction--who think that Hogwarts is worse than hogwash, and that the<br/>
magical scenarios of J.K. Rowling&#39;s imagination are inherently<br/>
un-Christian. I would counter that, instead, these books have the potential<br/>
to be profoundly Christian if readers can see past the medium (magic) to<br/>
the novels&#39; deeper messages about self-sacrifice, the triumph of good over<br/>
evil, and the glorious possibility of human redemption. (Beliefnet, July<br/>
2000) <br/>
<br/>
3) To quote a group of children about their impressions of Harry Potter<br/>
would be to question the mindless millions that watch Nickelodeon channel<br/>
without the guidance of their parents, or listen to various rock groups<br/>
whose lyrics are not acceptable as opposed to the ones that are - they are<br/>
going to get out of it what they want to, based on their moral upbringing<br/>
and their parental guidance!  This is a case of parents who neglect to give<br/>
their children a good moral upbringing, to learn right from wrong, and to<br/>
be well-adjusted human beings. I hardly think the parents of the child who<br/>
said that &quot;Jesus died because He was weak and stupid&quot; are strong<br/>
Christians, nor have they raised their child to follow in Jesus&#39; footsteps.<br/>
When Nickelodeon channel is watched WITH your children, or music listened<br/>
to and discussed WITH your children, you can interpret it together, guide<br/>
them, and learn from it.  If you allow them to be mindlessly led by it, you<br/>
are leaving it up to their own interpretation, which generally they are too<br/>
immature to properly make.<br/>
<br/>
4) The quote from the High Priest Egan of the Satanic church - do you<br/>
really believe he would say &quot;practically all of them are virgins, which is<br/>
gravy?&quot;  Do you really think he would say that? And besides, what does this<br/>
have to do with Harry Potter? This is more a sign of our times - after all,<br/>
prayer isn&#39;t allowed in schools any more, remember? The TV shows about<br/>
vampires and evil characters, the scary movies, the rock groups that<br/>
promote &quot;evil&quot; - none of those have anything to do with the increase in<br/>
involvement in Satanic cults, right?<br/>
<br/>
5) MANY, MANY educators, Christian and non-Christian, are praising the<br/>
Harry Potter books because they are so well-written, interesting and fun<br/>
that they have encouraged millions of children to read!  These children,<br/>
many of whom never had an interest in reading before, are not only reading<br/>
the Potter books, but anything they can get their hands on.  The reading<br/>
level of these books is at least that of a high school level - even my<br/>
husband had difficulty with the vocabulary and grammar. Think about it - a<br/>
craze in America led strictly by a book!  Not a TV show, or a movie, or<br/>
even driven by commercialism - just simply a book!  It&#39;s unheard of in our<br/>
recent cultural history!  Yes, unfortunately the commercialism will follow,<br/>
but for now, they have nothing but a book.<br/>
<br/>
6) The &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;wizardry&quot; in these books is very simple, and mostly<br/>
quite harmless.  They are not incantations recited in a foreign language,<br/>
they are one word commands for things like illuminating their wand, etc. <br/>
The higher magic comes in only during the fight of good vs. evil, which is<br/>
very black and white here. There are the bad guys and the good guys, and<br/>
it&#39;s pretty obvious which are which.  There is no devil worship. The email<br/>
indicates that the books lists spells and cites sources with authors and<br/>
book titles.  Hello people - this is fiction! There are no such books -<br/>
these are fictional books that JK Rowling has made up as part of a story!  <br/>
And do keep this in mind - it is just a book, a work of fiction!<br/>
<br/>
7) Censorship - this country was founded on people looking for freedom! The<br/>
freedom to make their own decisions about their lives, not have the<br/>
government tell them what to believe, how to worship, and what to read! <br/>
Censorship is tantamount to communism, and ESPECIALLY as homeschoolers,<br/>
should be one of our biggest fears in life! This is why we homeschool -<br/>
because we don&#39;t want to go along with the masses, we question the norm,<br/>
and make our own decisions!<br/>
<br/>
8) Harry Potter himself is an EXCELLENT role model for children!  He is<br/>
totally un-self-centered, generous, thinks nothing of putting himself in<br/>
danger for the sake of his friends, is a good student, and other than being<br/>
a procrastinator (as shown mildly in book #4), has no other major faults! I<br/>
have no problem with my children emulating Harry! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What concerns me most here is the fact that the people who initiated this<br/>
email are ignorant of the Harry Potter books - they obviously have not read<br/>
them, have not quoted reliable sources, and have made up actual lies.  And<br/>
these lies are being spread to people like you and other parents who have<br/>
not read the books.  I know of no intelligent person who has read the books<br/>
(whether they personally liked them or not) that think they are EVIL. <br/>
Before we go and help the authors of these ignorant emails by spreading<br/>
their word, we need to research and investigate the topic in further<br/>
detail. Otherwise, other parents might be influenced to a degree that they<br/>
not allow their children to read these books. If the parents themselves<br/>
have personally read the books and come to the decision that they prefer<br/>
their children not read the books, then I truly and utterly respect their<br/>
decision - they are the parents and it is their decision.  However, if the<br/>
parents have not read the books, they will be led by the &quot;recommendations&quot;<br/>
of these crackpots, and then I think it&#39;s a shame and a loss for all<br/>
concerned.<br/>

This would be funny if it wasn&#39;t so sad and scary. Hard to believe people<br/>
are so unattached and paranoid!<br/>
BTW did you notice that the reference material cited was from the Onion? As<br/>
you may know that is a enews satire site, usually pretty funny too! I think<br/>
this &quot;pastor&quot; mistook it for a real news report! We definitely should<br/>
forward a copy to them.<br/>
<br/>
I think Harry Potter series is wonderful; some of the best crafted writing<br/>
for child or adult that I have seen in years. Personally I&#39;m already<br/>
anticipating number 5.<br/>

In England, no doubt that&#39;s hugely true. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But here the Plain-Old-Times is more likely to default to the New York Times, <br/>
and so that&#39;s why it would be specified that way in American writing.  (I&#39;m <br/>
not trying to be obnoxious or argumentative, I just can&#39;t help it <br/>
sometimes...)<br/>
