&lt;&lt; My favorite comment so far was, &quot;I knew a homeschooled kid once (read that <br/>
as <br/>
ONE kid) and he was odd. Your kids seem fine, but they&#39;re young yet.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kind of a backhanded curse, isn&#39;t it?  &quot;Just wait...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well!!!<br/>
We just got a letter from Keith/dh&#39;s parents.  It was a response to a  &quot;what <br/>
the kids have been doing&quot; kind of letter, Kirby driver&#39;s ed, Marty applying <br/>
for Jr. Police academy, Holly being in St. Patrick&#39;s day parade with her <br/>
fiddle group.   So eleven years after we started homeschooling, we have <br/>
received the first positive review:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I admire the way you have been able to cross hurdles encountered because <br/>
your children have had no &#39;Formal Education&#39; according to society&#39;s concept.  <br/>
You have done well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Huh!<br/>
AND, although this full-page, typed letter has lots of corrected mistakes <br/>
(typewriter correction) that paragraph has two liquid paper corrections so it <br/>
would be PERFECT.<br/>
<br/>
(And her writing is always that stilted.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty nice, after all these years, to have her say something positive.<br/>
