<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783667054">To me, <br/>
mothering is being the best that I can be in every<br/>
given moment. <br/>
<br/>
Dear Mary ......you express yourself so beautifully. <br/>
That is what I mean by &quot;teaching&quot;, too. Mothering and<br/>
teaching and setting an example have to be synonymous.<br/>
Thanks...Sharon<br/>
ps......but I hope some of my more unpleasant<br/>
characteristics get deleted from my child&#39;s learning<br/>
acquisitions!! I&#39;m certainly not the best example of<br/>
very much at all!! I do try hard, and try to point<br/>
myself in the right general direction!! I pray it&#39;s<br/>
enough.<br/>
<br/>
