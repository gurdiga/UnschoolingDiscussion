VIRGINIA BEACH, VA -- May 25, 2001 -- In one of its top stories <br/>
today, CBN News reported that Home Education Magazine&#39;s domain name <br/>
has been purchased by an overseas company trafficking pornography. <br/>
CBN News issued the alert that home-ed-press.com no longer belongs to <br/>
Home Education Magazine on its news magazine program, The 700 Club, <br/>
seen by 1,000,000 viewers daily.  The domain name was purchased by <br/>
Home Education Magazine in 1996, but Mark and Helen Hegener, the <br/>
magazine&#39;s publishers, were recently informed that the registration <br/>
had lapsed and an overseas company had purchased the name, which it <br/>
now uses to link to a pornographic site.  Home Education Magazine, a <br/>
winner of the Parents&#39; Choice 2000 Recommended Award, has supported <br/>
homeschooling families with its publication and resources for 18 <br/>
years.  Sites that originally linked to Home Education Magazine <br/>
through home-ed-press.com should now use <br/>

records from the school here!  <br/>
I withdrew my children in January and still have<br/>

the files have been pulled <br/>
and are sitting on one of the secretaries&#39; desk. <br/>
They have been there quite <br/>
some time.  Whenever I call or go into the school<br/>

certain circumstance view and copy files of<br/>
students who ride my bus.   <br/>
Should I just go in on Tuesday grab the files and<br/>
copy them myself???  This <br/>
may cause a stir, but if you guys think this is<br/>
best, then so be it!!!!  I am <br/>
tired of waiting for these records.  Is there<br/>
another step I should take <br/>
before doing it myself???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277220923">Send a certified letter.  State that you have repeatedly asked for copies<br/>
(list dates if you have them) of the records.  If they cannot find a way to<br/>
get you a copy of the records within 5 working days, then you would like to<br/>
be put on the agenda of the next school board meeting.  Send this to the<br/>
principal of the school with a cc to the district superintendant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909966147">I would call the principal (and talk to only the principal) and tell him that<br/>
you will be there on such-and-such day and at such-and-such time and that you<br/>
expect that He, personally will be there to hand you the copies. And then say<br/>
that if he cannot do this, you will contact the state board or take legal<br/>
actions. Maybe that will work.</div>
