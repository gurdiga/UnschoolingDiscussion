<div id="ygrps-yiv-585343351">I have to disagree with the statement below.  No, not every child or <br/>
adult has a choice in how they behave.  We can not ignore medical <br/>
conditions.  I&#39;m sorry I keep bringing this up, but, with my family, <br/>
this is very applicable.<br/>
<br/>
And, let&#39;s not forget severe PMS.<br/>
<br/>
Medical problems aside, I&#39;m not sure I would want my child to act one <br/>
way when he feels another way.  If s/he is angry about something, for <br/>
example, I think the healthiest approach for the parent to take is to <br/>
allow that child his anger.  If his angry behavior bothers someone, they <br/>
can always just go away.  The child&#39;s emotions should be respected.  Me, <br/>
personally, I&#39;m not into repression.  I was repressed for many years as <br/>
a child and I don&#39;t want to do the same thing to my children.  It&#39;s very <br/>
harmful, especially to the more sensitive children.  Children have <br/>
feelings too and they should be allowed to express them honestly and <br/>
openly.  Young children also don&#39;t have as much control over their <br/>
behavior as adults do.  If they&#39;re upset about something, they can&#39;t <br/>
always express themselves verbally, so it will come out another way.  We <br/>
need to respect that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048403669">I am trying to be a good sensative parent, but my kids still act <br/>
&quot;horrible&quot; in a store once in a while. Usually it&#39;s because they&#39;re <br/>
tired, hungry, bored (errands like grocery, or other even brief <br/>
specific shopping, can be boring for a kid who wants to be elsewhere), <br/>
and that the outbursts are embarassing.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s my fault for not taking care of their needs better. <br/>
Sometimes I don&#39;t plan ahead for food, or recreation, and have to &quot;just <br/>
get these few errands done.&quot; I am trying to get better at integrating <br/>
play and food breaks into busy days.<br/>
<br/>
I do know for sure though that with my young kids any punishment for <br/>
those outbursts belongs to me not them. I am in charge of how long we <br/>
stay, and when they get food. If I am not planning ahead for their <br/>
needs, they don&#39;t have much choice.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea about &quot;other parents don&#39;t want their kids to play with <br/>
them because of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; their behavior, etc.&quot;  is that some parents won&#39;t play with us because we don&#39;t go to church and are not christian. Other times, the other kids are just so cruel about any differences they hurt my kids&#39; feelings, and my kids lash out. My 4y is working on not hitting or screaming when he&#39;s angry, but sometimes the other kids are just so mean or rude I am amazed. I try to supervise his playtimes, because many parents on the block just let their 3y and up run around outside and play without anyone watching them. One even told me they are old enough to know how to behave they don&#39;t need her watching them. Her 4y son started hitting my 4y son, and my son hit back, so the kid ran in to tell mommy and she told us it would be better if we played elsewhere. No kidding. My 6y daughter likes to play cars (&quot;boy&quot; stuff) and dress up (&quot;girl&quot; stuff), but many of the girls exclude her (cliques), and so do the boys(&quot;no girls allowed&quot;). Maybe it&#39;s because they are all in school, or maybe she doesn&#39;t like being bossed around or teased. It&#39;s not always bad, but I had higher hopes for the neighborhood. She has friends in her Judo/Jujitsu classes and in her gymnastics. <br/>

hopefully that environment is nurturing, loving and free from any type of <br/>
oppression or abuse (subtle or otherwise).<br/>
<br/>
This is still an adult centered world.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t *think* there is a magic age at which they then become an adult.. <br/>
but at some point, they are.. and then they are in control of their <br/>
environment and their actions and its effects upon others.<br/>
<br/>
I dont&#39; know about other countries outside North America in regards to <br/>
child-raising, yet I do find that we here tend to push our children to <br/>
grow up *much* faster than nature meant.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most of us aren&#39;t living so close to the bone that postponing a trip to<br/>
the grocery store is going to be the deciding factor in whether we live<br/>
or die.  Most parents select a time that is convenient for *them* to go. <br/>
 Most adults don&#39;t have someone whirl into the room and say drop<br/>
everything you&#39;re doing because it&#39;s not as important as what I want to<br/>
do. And come with me, even if you don&#39;t want to, to the most boring place<br/>
on earth.  And never mind that your hungry, we&#39;ll take care of that<br/>
later.  <br/>
<br/>
If a good friend was visiting would we yank her away from a favorite TV<br/>
show to get to the store?  I think we&#39;d wait, out of courtesy &#39;till she<br/>
was ready too.  Same if she wanted to eat first.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Responsible isn&#39;t really the word I&#39;d use, less experienced in dealing<br/>
with external and internal pressures would be more accurate.  Parents<br/>
have had many years of experience in life to help them make judgements<br/>
about their reactions in any situation.  Kids are still figuring it out. <br/>
 Parents usually call all the shots too, about when to stop for food, <br/>
how many more stores to go to,  what kind of behavior is acceptable in<br/>
the car, in the store.  Having no control over an already disagreeable<br/>
situation wouldn&#39;t be any fun.   I still say expecting adults to act like<br/>
adults isn&#39;t out of line.   I think parents bug kids infinitely more than<br/>
kids bother parents.  And without thirty years of experience dealing with<br/>
pushy, bossy, always in control, individuals, I think kids can&#39;t be<br/>
blamed for acting like kids.  <br/>

<br/>
First of all I&#39;d like to say, why don&#39;t you make<br/>
shopping fun? My dd likes to go shopping. She helps me<br/>
pick out the food, put it in the cart, unload the cart<br/>
and then does the ATM card machine or helps me count<br/>
the cash. She&#39;s 7. When she was smaller, I made<br/>
picture cards of the things we bought every week. When<br/>
we got into an aisle, I would give her the picture<br/>
cards of the foods on that aisle and she would pick<br/>
them out. Anything can become a game and a learning<br/>
experience if you choose to take the time to make it<br/>
so.<br/>
 <br/>

the blame for a child&#39;s outburst lie on the child<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t understand this comparison. A parent is an<br/>
adult (ie. fully mature - we like to hope). A child<br/>
has minimal life experience and limited maturity (I&#39;m<br/>
assuming we&#39;re talking about fairly young children<br/>
here - they&#39;re the ones I see having tantrums in<br/>
public). Children&#39;s outbursts can be caused by a<br/>
myriad of things (hunger, tiredness, illness, anxiety,<br/>
etc.). It&#39;s up to the parent to be aware of their<br/>
child&#39;s needs and to take care of those needs before<br/>
going into a public place (ie store) if they want to<br/>
avoid a tantrum. That&#39;s how I understood  Kathy&#39;s<br/>
post.  And who said that there needs to be consistancy<br/>
between a child&#39;s actions and an adults? There aren&#39;t<br/>
any societies (that I know of) that expect the same<br/>
behavior of children as of the adults.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;I am in charge of how long we <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stay, and when they get food. If I am not planning<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ahead for their <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; needs, they don&#39;t have much choice.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Sure they do.  Everyone, child or adult, has a<br/>
choice in how they behave.  <br/>
<br/>
Sheila&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again we get back to the maturity issue. I think most<br/>
of us will agree that small children do not always<br/>
have the mental or verbal skills to clearly<br/>
communicate (or even recognise) their needs.<br/>
Therefore, they are not *choosing* their behaviour.<br/>
They are *reacting* to their feelings at the time. If<br/>
a 2 year old is hungry and mom stops to run one last<br/>
errand, does he have a choice? Can he get himself home<br/>
or something to eat? No, he depends on mom for that<br/>
and if she&#39;s not attending to his need then he may<br/>
&#39;blow&#39;. That is what I interpreted Kathy&#39;s post to<br/>
mean.<br/>

Well, except for much of the United States these days :-).      Look around and<br/>

dressing themselves, tying their own shoes, having their own alarm clock and<br/>
being responsible for getting ready for their job (errr &quot;school&quot;) on time.<br/>
Sometimes it seems to me that &quot;our&quot; society in the U.S.  has it<br/>

have younger children take on &quot;adult&quot;  roles regarding &quot;self-control&quot;  almost<br/>
