<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550914170">&lt;&lt;There is ALWAYS something else they&#39;d be doing if you hadn&#39;t <br/>
made them do what you wanted them to do. Inertia would have come up some <br/>
other time, some other place. My kids probably know more interesting<br/>
things <br/>
to say about it than I do &lt;G&gt;. I never planned an &quot;inertia&quot; experiment<br/>
for <br/>
them, to make sure they knew about it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
About 3 days ago I was watching a demonstration of how inertia, mass and<br/>
force effect how an ice skater spins.  I wasn&#39;t even think about where<br/>
the kids were and how &quot;instructional&quot; this was, I was just watching<br/>
because this kind of thing fascinates me.  I always have something like<br/>
this on the TV, Discovery, PBS, History, etc.  I have it on because it&#39;s<br/>
truly what I prefer to watch, sometimes the kids join me and sometimes<br/>
they don&#39;t.  If they watch it&#39;s because they were drawn to it or my<br/>
enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
This time my daughter was watching from the kitchen table and eventually<br/>
moved over next to me.  When it was done she said, &quot;I have no idea what<br/>
they were saying.&quot;  I explained it a couple of different ways and with<br/>
that &quot;Hmmmmm&quot; look on her face wandered off.  About 20 minutes later she<br/>
came back and said, &quot;They could have explained it better if they had just<br/>
said........&quot; and she launched into an explanation which showed she<br/>
understood the concept.<br/>
<br/>
No plans, no experiment, just natural interest.  I didn&#39;t even think it<br/>
through to &quot;She just learned something about physics.&quot; until this thread<br/>
came up.  I don&#39;t have a problem with &quot;experiments&quot; if it&#39;s a natural<br/>
thing, something you would do whether it proved the kids are learning or<br/>
not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129885742">At the museum here they used to have a small, easily-spinning platform with a <br/>
pole to hold onto, and you could speed up and slow down, and spinning skaters <br/>
do, by changing your position.  There were diagrams, and then video of <br/>
skaters demonstrating what you could do with this contraption.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH!  It was part of a sports exhibit from a Canadian museum which was a <br/>
travelling exhibit.  It was SO fun we went three times.   Almost every <br/>
display had something to actually DO, and it did something back!    And, of <br/>
course, someone had designed an insipid little checklist for schoolgroups to <br/>
use that had the dumbest question ever.  In a hugely fascinating display <br/>
about physics and anatomy and materials science in sports, this page said <br/>
&quot;Which display had a green ball?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The greenness of balls was not part of ANY of the presentations. <br/>
