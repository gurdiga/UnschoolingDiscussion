<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027574721">Thanks everyone for your help, again.  My caseworker just left, and <br/>
after a loooong night of research, I can only say that God blessed me <br/>
through you all.<br/>
<br/>
I followed the dept of education links to heir.org, which had alot of <br/>
Gatto information.  I then printed out the main page of heir.org, the <br/>
GA homeschooling laws (where I highlighted just exactly what is <br/>
required by law) a site that had links to more Gatto information, and <br/>
then a few articles I found.  I highlighted the important stuff and <br/>
sat down with my caseworker and went over it age by page.  She stayed <br/>
for over an hour listening, and when she left she was thoroughly <br/>
convinced that unschooling sounded like the best method.<br/>
<br/>
God blessed me in several ways, first with the Gatto link provided by <br/>
Myranda, then by showing me links straight from the Dept. of <br/>
education that supported those methods.  <br/>
<br/>
After explaining the methods we have already tried (including the <br/>
satin hands treatment Mariah learned a few new words from and <br/>
learning to add by eating cat from their cereal) and the planned <br/>
methods (Building the ant farm, visiting museums and zoos) she <br/>
finally let up on the homeschooling issue.  She said that yesterday <br/>
she didn&#39;t know what I was talking about, but now she understood it <br/>
better and agrees that it sounds like a good working plan.  She even <br/>
thanked me for taking te time to help her understand unschooling <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
All I can say right now, is thank you all once again, Thank you God, <br/>
I&#39;m almost in tears right now because I was so scared of what she <br/>
would say today, and now it&#39;s time to get some shut eye.  My husband <br/>
took the kids to a horse farm, and I need to get some sleep before <br/>
they get back.<br/>
<br/>
BTW they are LOVING unschooling so far and even by just a few days of <br/>
it, we are having the time of our lives.  I&#39;m still working on not <br/>
trying to turn EVERYTHING into a lesson, but I&#39;m getting there.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t explain it, but there have been no tears, no tantrums and the <br/>
girls have been so much more cheerful and happier the past few days.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone, I am so glad I found this group, and I hope to be <br/>
able to return the help myself one day.<br/>

Either you are amazingly persuasive, or this women is surprisingly<br/>
open-minded.  (maybe both!)  I&#39;m gonna hope that she gets promoted and<br/>
is in a position to spread the good word about unschooling to her DSS co-workers.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there is one teacher in a hundred who would work as hard<br/>
for a kid as a motivated mom like you would (and did, last night).<br/>
