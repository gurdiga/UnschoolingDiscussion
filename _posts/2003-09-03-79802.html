<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656029289">I have always wondered whether Lars &quot;gets&quot; unschooling.  Yesterday he<br/>
convinced me that he doesn&#39;t.  A couple of weeks ago, he said he wanted to<br/>
do more &quot;stuff&quot; (he means school work) this year.  I didn&#39;t pay much<br/>
attention, since he said the same last year but resisted any suggestions I<br/>
had.  And I had finally become comfortable with his learning not looking<br/>
schooly at all.<br/>

Yesterday was the first day of school here.  (Remember that all his friends<br/>
go to school, including his new girlfriend.)  He came into my office as I<br/>

go to homeschooling events.)  He wanted to know when we were getting<br/>
started.  I thought he was referring to the new program he&#39;s on this year,<br/>
the one we switched to because it would be so much easier to unschool on, so<br/>
I said I was waiting for the learning consultant to call.<br/>
<br/>
Last night he wondered if it would be all right to do his school work in the<br/>
evenings because he can concentrate better then.  Excuse me?  When did we<br/>
actually talk about doing schoolwork?  Well, after some conversation it<br/>
appears that what he wants is assignments to do.  From what I can get out of<br/>
him and guessing the rest, he seems to think he hasn&#39;t learned anything<br/>
important all these years.  He seems to think it&#39;s time to fill the gaps in<br/>
his knowledge so he can be like all his friends.  When he wanted to know<br/>
just *what* he&#39;s learned all these years, I was at a loss.  So maybe part of<br/>

schoolwork.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not cut out to do school at home, even if he wants to.  So I&#39;m thinking<br/>
that I&#39;ll show him the GED book we&#39;ve got here and say that he can work<br/>
through that with my help if he needs it.  At the same time, I&#39;ll offer to<br/>
read interesting books that I&#39;ve long wished I could share with him about<br/>
science and history, etc.  But considering how he&#39;s always resisted reading<br/>

<br/>
Wow, he doesn&#39;t even like funny, woodsy, Canadian, by-Farley-Mowat <br/>
nonfiction?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading the strangest novel, by a BC author, about a home schooled <br/>

Arrrggh!)  The author&#39;s name is Susan Juby and the book is titled <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s got a little girl dressed like a hobbit on the front and back <br/>
cover.  The parts that aren&#39;t about homeschooling are funny, but the <br/>
laughs at those &quot;foolish homeschoolers&quot; don&#39;t work for me.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the first sentence of the review!!!<br/>
**Ever since Alice arrived at first grade dressed as a hobbit and <br/>
endured a week of increasingly violent peer rejection, she has been home <br/>
schooled by her hippie mom and indifferent dad, leaving her with what <br/>
her therapist calls &quot;a shocking poverty of age-appropriate real-life <br/>
experience.&quot;**<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328218517">I&#39;m not sure what the answer is Tia but I am seeing similar things happen here for my 15 year old. I think it does come from comparing themselves and exploring who they are. Most schooled kids esteem and identity is tied up in what you do or know so this has to be hard for these guys. I mean I struggle with it as an adult so....<br/>
I think it comes down to what is important for them and maybe brainstorming some ideas of how to accomplish the goals they see for themselves. Also really identifying why this is an issue.My 15 yr old has been feeling the desire for more peer interaction and was considering trying highschool. She is however aware of her freedom and though I said I would support her in it I suggested we come up with things that she needed from more social contact to see if we could find other ways. After a couple of days of thinking and talking we came up with a list of finding a gaming group, joining art and acting class, starting or joining some kind of youth group, looking for a book club, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Really what she needed was to feel more out there socially and more &quot;normal&quot; for our culture. I know this is a bit different than what you are dealing with but maybe finding out what his motivation is and what his concern is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910749742">Tia, I have the same problem with Pete. He&#39;s 12 and he&#39;s got <br/>
the &quot;feeling stupids&quot; too. So I&#39;m going to give him some stuff to do. <br/>
Math is what&#39;s bothering him. He wants to be with his grade level. <br/>
HOW DISGUSTING....but I expected it. I think giving them the books <br/>
whether text or non fiction, GED, etc. will solve the problem. <br/>
They&#39;re feeling insecure and no matter what kind of evidence we give <br/>
them otherwise will change what they want to believe. I&#39;m not set up <br/>
for school either but will try to find a math text for 7th grade. If <br/>
he wants to pursue it....so be it. Sara</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; about x or y than he does. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m right there with you, sister. My middle child is dead set on <br/>
&quot;doing school.&quot; I think some o fit is due to temperament (he likes <br/>
goals to complete and while he is learning, he thinks that it <br/>
&quot;doesn&#39;t count&quot; if it&#39;s not following a plan).<br/>
<br/>
My older daughter (14) is worried about college requirements <br/>
and her friends quiz her constantly on how she&#39;s fulfilling them. <br/>
This puts outside pressure on me. She wants me to be involved, <br/>
to help her create goals that fit into categories for college <br/>
admissions and to hold her accountable.<br/>
<br/>
This means the dreaded study of algebra when her times tables <br/>
aren&#39;t solid and neither of us see any point to learning it. When <br/>
my husband and I have emphasized that learning something for <br/>
a requirement isn&#39;t the same as learning, she says that it doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter. She needs it.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I am giving my time to helping her follow a curricula. <br/>
She *needs* to give this route a try and I want to support her, not <br/>
be a roadblock. But it taxes me and I don&#39;t wholeheartedly <br/>
support the direction.<br/>
<br/>
The real issue is peer related. I think teens have such a strong <br/>
need to feel that they idenitfy with their peer group, that they are <br/>
on the right track (adulthood is a scary future for everyoneto <br/>
doubt that you are prepared to do anything is an awful feeling) <br/>
and that they are secure in their parents&#39; value system and <br/>
choices that influence their lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m thinking of asking him what specific things<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he feels he&#39;s missing, but I suspect all I&#39;ll get is, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My two who want to &quot;study&quot; say that they want me to know. They <br/>
want me to tell them what they&#39;ll need. It feels like too big a job to <br/>
figure it out themselves.<br/>
<br/>
For my 6th grader, we are still following his interests and <br/>
creating goals that he wants to achieve. So he&#39;s cooking through <br/>
a cookbook and writing up all the recipes, studying the <br/>
constellations and looking for them in his telescope etc.<br/>
<br/>
But for my 14 year old, we pulled out a typical college <br/>
admissions subject list and pulled from that. She says she <br/>
wants science so we looked at all the sciences. She likes <br/>
psychology so I suggested she do a temperament study of her <br/>
peer group. I helped her lay out the daily steps, I gave her <br/>
reading and due dates and I helped her imagine the end result. <br/>
Having a manageable goal that is tangible (but nothing like text <br/>
book work) made her feel that she too had important work to do <br/>
that was parallel to school without being school.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also being tutored in Latin (her idea) and is taking French <br/>
and honor&#39;s English at the local high school (to see what it&#39;s <br/>
like). She already hated the French class even though she loves <br/>
languages. It&#39;s been eye opening to her to see what school is <br/>
like. She&#39;s already valuing hom and our freedom a lot more. She <br/>
loves her English class though. She likes having class <br/>
discussions about her primary love: literature.<br/>
<br/>
What was missing this last spring in her opinion was guidance <br/>
from me. She feels loved when I take the time to plan with her <br/>
and take her concerns seriously. This is how we&#39;re doing it. <br/>
<br/>
  It<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling shouldn&#39;t mean unplanning. Maybe he just needs <br/>
some time to sort through how he wants his last two or three <br/>
years to look before college (if college in in his sights). If he has <br/>
a plan (and it includes cool stuff, not GED prep), he won&#39;t miss <br/>
that curricula stuff. But if his days look the same as they always <br/>
have and he has no way to quanitfy what he knows, I can <br/>
imagine he&#39;d be nervous.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents.<br/>

wants science so we looked at all the sciences. She likes <br/>
<br/>
psychology so I suggested she do a temperament study of her <br/>
<br/>
peer group. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tell her that until maybe the 1980&#39;s, lots of people didn&#39;t consider <br/>
psychology to be science at all.  Talk to her about the difference between what were <br/>
once called &quot;soft sciences&quot; (psychology and sociology and I don&#39;t know what <br/>
else) and &quot;hard sciences&quot; (meaning concrete, not difficult).  Astronomy came <br/>
under &quot;hard science&quot; even though nobody&#39;s brought any of those planets home, and <br/>
even before the lunar landing it was &quot;hard&quot; while any study of people was <br/>
&quot;soft.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That could tie psychology in with history and philosophy for her.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The real issue is peer related. I think teens have such a strong <br/>
<br/>
need to feel that they idenitfy with their peer group, that they are <br/>
<br/>
on the right track&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re lucky in having a fair number of other kids who have always or mostly <br/>
or sometimes been homeschooled, AND some unschoolers among that number.  We&#39;re <br/>
lucky that of the homeschooled in that group, unschoolers are doing the best <br/>
socially and jobwise.  It&#39;s through La Leche League that we met some, and <br/>
through running an unschooling get-together once a week that we have some more <br/>
still in our lives, and it&#39;s due to Marty&#39;s Ork Ball games that they&#39;re over here <br/>
pretty regularly these days.<br/>
<br/>
A family from Tucson was visiting the other day.  They came by to buy <br/>
Thinking Sticks!  (Well, they were in town anyway. &lt;bwg&gt;)   A carload of Ork Ball <br/>
players showed up and I introduced them, and it was not as fun for me as it would <br/>
have been a few months back.  Two of them have gone to school this year.  <br/>
Julie, who had never been to school at all is fifteen and a dancer, and applied <br/>
to get into the public school of performing arts which just opened three years <br/>
ago or so.  Logan who has been in and out of school is living rurally now with <br/>
his mom&#39;s fiancee and his children, quite a schooled family, and he&#39;s going <br/>
to high school because the bus gets him into Albuquerque every day and he&#39;s not <br/>
out where he&#39;s expected to watch younger kids.  Practical considerations and <br/>
the need for an audience on his part, and a lack of confidence or interest in <br/>
homeschooling on his mom&#39;s.   But until a few weeks ago, I could have said <br/>
&quot;homeschooled, homeschooled... &quot; all the way around the room.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if Kirby didn&#39;t have a batch of homeschooled friends he&#39;d be wanting to <br/>
&quot;keep up&quot; with his schooled friends too, instead of seeing how far ahead of <br/>
them he is in so many ways that the few &quot;behinds&quot; seem small.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973536061">First, the maker of America&#39;s second-most popular college entrance<br/>
exam releases this year&#39;s test scores and declares incoming freshmen <br/>
largely unprepared for math and science classes. A week later, <br/>
results from the nation&#39;s No. 1 test show math scores at a 35-year <br/>
high.<br/>
<br/>
Something doesn&#39;t add up. <br/>
<br/>
Researchers for the ACT analyzed this year&#39;s results and concluded <br/>
that just 26 percent of test-takers were ready to handle college <br/>
coursework in science and 40 percent in math.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the SAT math scores were the best since at least 1967: <br/>
519 on a scale with a top score of 800. Since the 1999 exam, math <br/>
scores are up eight points.<br/>
<br/>
Some educators say the number of students enrolled in remedial math <br/>
and science courses at four-year schools support the ACT&#39;s <br/>
conclusions. <br/>

You probably have thought of this already...but do you have access to a <br/>
volunteer website like volunteermatch.com?  How about a volunteer job that <br/>
puts him to work in his field of interest while his friends are in <br/>
school?  My almost 15 yr old son has been doing this for over a year, and I <br/>
can say that it has been a tremendous help in giving him a sense of self <br/>
worth as well as letting his friends see what cool options homeschooling <br/>
afforded.  (Although the whole concept of working for &quot;free&quot; was a real <br/>
tough one for them to understand!)  He teaches Seniors how to use computers <br/>
and the internet for the city of Seattle.  He&#39;s been at it for over a year, <br/>
and was their first and youngest intergenerational volunteer and they are <br/>
now very interested in recruiting more kids like him.  It&#39;s in his area of <br/>
interest.  My 11 yr has just begun volunteering at an animal <br/>
shelter.  She&#39;s interested in a career with animals.  (Not as a <br/>
vet--doesn&#39;t want to &quot;kill animals, mom&quot;)  Both positions were found on <br/>
this website.  My son&#39;s was sort of backdoor, from a different position and <br/>
then calling and talking to the director and asking what else they had.<br/>

interest him. Look at it from the point of view of an employer who sees<br/>
hundreds of generic applications. Whether you put in a made up school name<br/>
or homeschooled, either may raise your son to the not obviously rejectable<br/>
pile (like an application full of mispellings) but neither will supply what<br/>
an employer needs in an employee. (Unless the employer happens to be a<br/>
homeschooler or had good luck with another homeschool hire.)<br/>
<br/>
What employers are looking for is someone who has shown interest in the<br/>
field their being hired for. (Unless he&#39;s going after stock boy or something<br/>
that doesn&#39;t need skills and has a high turn over.) Doing something related<br/>
to the job in another or job, or even better in their spare time indicates<br/>
someone has a liking for what the job entails and is likely to do well and<br/>
stick with the job long enough to give a return on the cost of training<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
So if he spends a year persuing what interests him: volunteering,<br/>
apprenticing, part time jobs, independent projects, college courses for fun,<br/>
he&#39;ll be more marketable since he&#39;ll be able to show an employer what his<br/>
passions are. He might be giving up a year of full time pay but he&#39;d be<br/>
essentially getting a year&#39;s worth of &quot;training&quot; for free. If he were to pay<br/>
a school for that training, he&#39;d not only be not earning money but he&#39;d be<br/>
also paying someone else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784504299">That&#39;s the way it was in New Mexico when I was a teen (and might still be). <br/>
ACT was required in school. SAT was only taken by people who wanted to apply <br/>
to schools requiring that, and many of the universities in state were happy <br/>
with just the ACT scores. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just thought you all might be interested in some other comparisons of the ACT versus SAT:<br/>
<br/>
Most colleges will accept either - and they are different - so it might be useful for people applying to college to take both and then only submit the one on which they do best.<br/>
<br/>
The ACT English is probably better for those especially good in grammar, but the SAT for those with great vocabularies, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Here are other comparisons:<br/>
<br/>
ACT is preferred by more schools, schools in the middle of the country, and more often by public schools than private schools.<br/>
<br/>
SAT is preferred by schools on both coasts and more often by private schools.<br/>
<br/>
The questions on the ACT appear in the &quot;order of difficulty&quot; - not so on the SAT.<br/>
<br/>
SAT covers only up through algebra and basic geometry, all formulas are provided. ACT also covers a tiny bit of trig, no formulas provided.<br/>
<br/>
SAT penalizes wrong answers. ACT does not penalize for wrong answers.<br/>
<br/>
SAT is &quot;stand-alone&quot; - no attempt to base on school curriculum. ACT is more based on school curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
SAT questions are trickier - there are many more distracters. ACT more straightforward, few distracters.<br/>
<br/>
SAT has two sections that count plus there is always an experimental section that doesn&#39;t count (but test takers don&#39;t know which section that is). Math section is in 2 30-minute and 1 15-minute segment, English is the same - 2 30-minute and 1 15-minute test segment. The experimental is another 30-minute segment of either math or English.<br/>
<br/>
ACT has four sections that count plus an experimental section that doesn&#39;t count (students can tell which is experimental - it is clearly an added on section). Sections are reading 35 minutes, math 60 minutes, Engish 45 minutes, science 35 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
SAT scores are from 200 to 800 on each of the two sections - total possible 1600, median score about 1,000.<br/>
<br/>
ACT scores are 1 to 36 for each of the four subjects, averaged together for composite score. Median is around 21.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My own guess is that those who have a lot of general knowledge and good English skills are likely to score relatively better on the ACT, because they&#39;ll be able to make good educated guesses, and those that they miss won&#39;t hurt them.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t worry about the extra math on the ACT, not doing trig won&#39;t make much difference, there are only 4 trig questions on the test and the other questions are likely to be more straightforward than the trickier ones on the SAT.<br/>

money since he was about 13.  But it might be worth looking to find<br/>
something that matches his interests.  There&#39;s a volunteer bureau in<br/>
Victoria, but it mostly lists opportunities in Victoria, an hour and a half<br/>
away by bus.  Might be worth it to him if we can find him something to do<br/>
with either film or mountain biking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732127790">I took the ACT but not the SAT because I was going to a mid-west <br/>
school.  On the math section I literally guessed (as in I didn&#39;t even <br/>
try to figure them out) at every question and scored a 32 out of 36.  <br/>
I think that was the beginning of my questioning educational status <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139039594">Tia, I&#39;ve been thinking about this thread for days now and thinking <br/>
of when this is going to happen to Pete. I mentioned he was twelve. <br/>
Reflecting back, no book or school is going to solve growing up. I <br/>
have another son who is 17 now but is in public school. For the past <br/>
two years he has been looking ahead restlessly and just now this <br/>
summer has made a life decision. He is now much more peaceful. I <br/>
talked to him last night about some major stuff and he said &quot;I feel <br/>
better this year and better about myself than I ever have&quot;. It&#39;s <br/>
because he decided what to do and we&#39;ve supported him and talked <br/>
everything out. I think Lars is looking for his path. Of course, you <br/>
already know that. I&#39;ll be thinking of him and hoping he can attain <br/>
the peace I see in my 17yo now. Sara</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936335558">One thing you might consider, too, is what type of work he&#39;s looking <br/>
for. Well-known companies and retailers receive a lot of applications. <br/>
Smaller employers, and companies your family has a relationship with may <br/>
be better sources of jobs.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s concentrating on &quot;teen job&quot; types of things (retail, fast food) <br/>
he may want to broaden out to a wider market. I was surprised how many <br/>
entry-level jobs hospitals provide--patient transporter, all sorts of <br/>
clerk and cleaning jobs, as well as the more obvious stuff. What does he <br/>
like to do?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959497730"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; HA - he likes video games and music.  And to be honest, he really<br/>
&gt; dislikes work.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This could well be why he isn&#39;t getting hired.  That attitude shows on a<br/>
person, even if they don&#39;t say a word.<br/>
<br/>
So I think he is in for a rude awakening when he gets<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a job, I&#39;m afraid he may even have to lose a job due to lack of<br/>
&gt; really working hard and being committed, before he believes what I<br/>
&gt; say.  I have tried to impress upon him when he does work for me, but<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t finish and doesn&#39;t do a very good job, that a future employer<br/>
&gt; would not be pleased with this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you ever refused to pay him for a job poorly done?  If I offered to pay<br/>
my kid to do something, I&#39;d expect it to be done right.  At that point,<br/>
you&#39;re the boss rather than the parent.<br/>
<br/>
But.....now I&#39;m confused, you guys<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; said I shouldn&#39;t hold him to finishing anything because then he<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t start anything.   What if he has the idea that he can do<br/>
&gt; this on his job?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;ll get fired.  Maybe he&#39;ll learn from that.  Maybe he just needs to hear<br/>
it from someone besides his mother.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big difference between things he starts just because he thinks he<br/>
might like it, and things he&#39;s being paid to do.  An employer just isn&#39;t<br/>
going to keep an unproductive employee on the payroll unless she thinks he<br/>
has some real potential that makes it worth it to her.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious.  Whose idea is it for him to get a job?  If he really doesn&#39;t<br/>
want a job, why is he looking?  Are you feeling like it&#39;s time he looked<br/>
toward leaving the nest?  Or is he just wanting spending money?  If *he*<br/>
wants to leave the nest, I think he&#39;ll be willing to do what&#39;s necessary to<br/>
get a job and work towards moving out.  If it&#39;s Mom who wants him to have a<br/>
job, he isn&#39;t all that likely to get hired.<br/>
