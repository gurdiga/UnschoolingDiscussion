<div id="ygrps-yiv-992988604">Hi, my name is Tonya. I have posted only a couple of times,but I <br/>
follow you guys faithfully every day.<br/>
I am having problems coping with everything right now and could use <br/>
some advice.<br/>
My four boys(9, 6, 3, and 1) are driving me crazy!!!<br/>
I am practically a single mom. My husband works offshore for 2 weeks <br/>
and is home 2 weeks out of the month. I handle everything from house <br/>
cleaning to paying bills etc. None of my boys have attended school <br/>
except my oldest from 5 to 6 and then I took him out.<br/>
My problem is that I have been unschooling for well over a year now <br/>
and while I DO see them learning everyday.And am very proud of there <br/>
acomplishments, i do have a problem with them not wanting to do <br/>
anything but watch TV and fight with each other.<br/>
I do expect a little help.I am so busy doing housework,cooking giving <br/>
the little ones what they need,and such, that I don&#39;t feel I am <br/>
spending enough time WITH them.<br/>
My two older ones are always screaming and fighting.The don&#39;t do <br/>
there simple chores when I ask and I just don&#39;t know what to do <br/>
anymore.<br/>
I would like more time WITH them,not just taking care of the daily <br/>
chores. I have no one to help babysit or anything like that while my <br/>
husband is gone so I can get more done.<br/>
I can&#39;t even go to the bathroom without having somone beat on my door <br/>
or someone screaming for me. I would like to have ocational time to <br/>
be myself on top of all this too.<br/>
If anyone has any advice on what I need to change abut this, Please <br/>
help me out, I would greatly appreciate it.<br/>

My husband works a lot too...sometimes 14-16 hours a day...for months<br/>
on end.<br/>
<br/>
You need fresh air.  You need to shake it up and shake it out.<br/>
<br/>
So this is my suggestion.  Declare a holiday.  It should be at least a<br/>
week long.  It could be when your DH is home, so he can enjoy it too<br/>
before heading back out, or when he is away if a bit of mess unnerves him.<br/>
<br/>
Let the boys and Dad help you plan it all.  Meal menus, where to go,<br/>
what to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Each day go someplace interesting and different.  <br/>
<br/>
Some Ideas (to springboard your own from):  <br/>
<br/>
Go to the rec center and swim, then come home and have a barbeque<br/>
(even if it is 20 degrees outside...burgers and fries and homemade<br/>
milk shakes).  <br/>
<br/>
Go to the zoo and come home and make animal masks and sleep in the<br/>
tent set up in the livingroom.  <br/>
<br/>
Have a ghost story night and read Edgar Allen Poe by candlelight and<br/>
pass around grapes in a bowl for eyeballs and spaghetti for guts.  <br/>
<br/>
Go to the museum and see the art gallery, then come home and paint<br/>
your own masterpieces and hang them on the walls.  Or paint them<br/>
directly on the walls...I don&#39;t know how crazy free you feel about<br/>
that. LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Rent a whole series of movies, like all of the Star Wars movies or the<br/>
Lord of the Rings, or every episode of Star Trek Classic or all the<br/>
VeggieTales, and have a marathon complete with nachos and popcorn.<br/>
<br/>
Invite each person&#39;s best friend (including YOURS) over for a slumber<br/>
party.  Make homemade pizzas.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely No Housework except the bare minimum to survive...fix meals<br/>
and snacks, wash dishes (but use a lot of paper to throw away too),<br/>
wash only underwear, pick up the toys a bit when the baby is tripping<br/>
over them.  That&#39;s IT.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990045772">Thank you sooo much for the advice. It turns out it is exactly what we  <br/>
needed.  It&#39;s funny how sometimes someone elses out look on things can make  a big <br/>
difference!!!<br/>
  Thanks  again!!!!!!!!                                   Tonya<br/>
