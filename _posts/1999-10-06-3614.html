<div id="ygrps-yiv-592148510">I wanted to apologize if my last post seemed rude.  I didn&#39;t mean to be! <br/>
As someone said, e-mail is challenging bc we don&#39;t see each others faces<br/>
and hear our tones of voice.  I too, am just sharing my view and hoping<br/>
to learn more along my own parenting journey.<br/>
We never know when we state our views if others will say &quot;I agree&quot; or &quot;I<br/>
can&#39;t believe you think that way&quot;.  But we would never learn anything new<br/>
if people didn&#39;t speak up when they don&#39;t agree with us.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank you, Faith, for sharing why you feel as you do.  We make<br/>
the best decisions when we have carefully thought out reasons behind our<br/>
actions.<br/>

years,<br/>
and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing.<br/>
