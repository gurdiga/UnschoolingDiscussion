<br/>
it is the Austalian Vaccination Network and provides info on ingredients in<br/>
vaccinations - it is prochoice but very on the side of avoiding<br/>
vaccinations - very good info though.<br/>

and this is an article about how mercury is used as a preservative for<br/>
vaccines such as tetnus<br/>

<br/>
also for your interest<br/>
<br/>
There are three exemption possibilities in most U.S. states:<br/>
<br/>
  1.. Medical Exemption: All 50 states in the U.S. allow for a medical<br/>
exemption. A few states allow licensed naturopathic or chiropractic doctors<br/>
to issue medical exemptions in addition to medical doctors. However, few<br/>
pediatricians check for indications of increased risk before administering<br/>
vaccines, so it is advisable for parents to research this matter for<br/>
themselves. Epilepsy, severe allergies, and siblings&#39; previous adverse<br/>
reactions are but a few of the many conditions in child or family history<br/>
which may qualify for a medical exemption;<br/>
  2.. Religious Exemption: Nearly all states allow for a religious<br/>
exemption; this may not require membership in an established religious<br/>
organization (individual state laws vary); and<br/>
  3.. Philosophical Exemption: An increasing number of states allow<br/>
philosophical exemptions, in recognition of the controversy and/or violation<br/>
of freedom that mandated vaccination laws impose<br/>
If you need a religious reason even if your not religious well this article<br/>
might help (as in regards to abortion - you can always say you don&#39;t believe<br/>
in the use of aborted human fetuses for vaccines!!)<br/>
<br/>
These viruses have been cross-mutated in animals, contain animal DNA &<br/>
RNA, have more than just diptheria,tetanus, polio, hepatitis, measles,<br/>
mumps, rubella etc. etc...in fact, hepatitis A, chickenpox, and rubella<br/>
are made from aborted human fetal tissue.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your decision making <br/>

As far as the vaccines derived from human cell lines, this explains it as<br/>
well as I&#39;ve seen it anywhere: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cogforlife.org/vaxbrochsample.htm">http://www.cogforlife.org/vaxbrochsample.htm</a><br/>
