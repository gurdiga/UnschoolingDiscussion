Those who are free have a right to a public education; then why do <br/>

===================<br/>
<br/>
These are the justifications I have come across in the college of education <br/>
or other reading:<br/>
<br/>
For the good of society.  That&#39;s one line of reasoning.  A literate populace <br/>
makes, theoretically, a better democracy.<br/>
<br/>
For the good of children, who have in some times and places been kept home by <br/>
fathers who made them work, or by mothers who had no other means of support <br/>
and prevented children from going to school so they could help at home.<br/>
<br/>
For the good of girls, so that they&#39;re not relegated to having to marry or <br/>
become domestic servants (in the days that was a good argument; &quot;domestic <br/>
workers&quot; now) in order to survive.<br/>
<br/>
To enculturate immigrants, so that they understood the predominant culture <br/>
and the official language.<br/>
<br/>
To thwart those who would exploit children; to protect children from child <br/>
labor exploitation (which was a really horrible problem at one time, and lots of <br/>
younger people seem totally unaware of it ever having happened).<br/>
<br/>
To encourage citizenship, nobility of character and other virtues necessary <br/>
for a civilized society.<br/>
<br/>
To educate people in civics so that they can participate fully and know their <br/>
own in local, state and federal rights and duties.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Huh.<br/>
I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d come up with that many off the top of my head.<br/>

Dangit, I loaned my copy of De-schooling our Lives to someone and I<br/>
can&#39;t remember who it was, but wasn&#39;t there an essay in there about how<br/>
compulsory schooling started in Europe (Germany?) as a way to facilitate<br/>
the creation of a military?  Am I imagining things?  Forgive me, but<br/>
I&#39;ve been sick for a week and have a splitting headache so I might not<br/>
be thinking clearly, but some bells are ringing off in the distance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916647507">The Prussian government created a military school system. There&#39;s<br/>
more links here www.geocities.com/moonwindstarsky/lifestyle I think <br/>
it was created for control.<br/>
