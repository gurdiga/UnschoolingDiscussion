<div id="ygrps-yiv-898128843">&quot;He&#39;s still going to build it.  But<br/>
won&#39;t expect Connor to be out there if he doesn&#39;t want to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
Sounds like that exchange went really well. I have caused defensiveness in dh before...I have to be REALLY mindful before I approach him or it doesn&#39;t go over so well. <br/>
There isn&#39;t much that comes up anymore though, he&#39;s really quite laid back. The other day he was stomping around and being a bit pissy about the condition of our messy house (it looked the same as always, but it just got to him due to other stresses) and I asked him if I needed to stay home. He grumped &quot;no, I&#39;ll be FINE&quot; and so I reminded him that this was OUR area of the house and if the mess really bothered him he could go downstairs to his neat, clean corner of the world.<br/>
I asked him to please not bug the kids about the mess while I was at work. He didn&#39;t! :) Big improvement from previous times.<br/>
He even called to apologize for being grumpy.<br/>
Wow.<br/>
