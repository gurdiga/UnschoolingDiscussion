<h4>Sue Patterson  by way of Home Education</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519477498">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already sent this out to the NHEN Military Contacts<br/>
(if you&#39;re homeschooling in the military and would like to be a contact for<br/>
your installation, sign up here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/nhen/pov/military/form_military_contact.asp?id=207">http://www.nhen.org/nhen/pov/military/form_military_contact.asp?id=207</a> )<br/>
<br/>
Colonel Lynch from DoDEA wants to discuss homeschooling with someone active<br/>
with NHEN. He decided to fly to Texas, where he could meet with me (as NHEN<br/>
Military Coordinator) and Laura Derrick, (NHEN board member living in Texas<br/>
too).<br/>
<br/>
Some of the discussion will be about the recent legislation giving<br/>
homeschoolers&#39; access to auxiliary services in overseas school facilities.<br/>
My goal in this particular conversation is to be sure that the requirements<br/>
that are going to be implemented to do this, are only applied to the<br/>
homeschoolers choosing to use these services.<br/>
<br/>
I think Colonel Lynch is also interested in simply finding out more about<br/>
homeschooling in general. I think this is a very positive thing - and a<br/>
great opportunity to give him information and clear up any misconceptions he<br/>
may have about homeschooling. I&#39;ve asked the NHEN Military contacts to send<br/>
me any suggestions, comments, problems that they&#39;re encountering, and then<br/>
I&#39;ll share it with Col. Lynch.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a military homeschooling family, I&#39;d like to know if your<br/>
installation is doing anything to help homeschoolers. Likewise, if your<br/>
installation is making it difficult, I&#39;d like to know that too. I would<br/>
really like to give Colonel Lynch the chance to hear what&#39;s really happening<br/>
out there - good and bad.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! Email me by August 20th, at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Military@...">Military@...</a>  if you have<br/>
information to share. Feel free to share this on any other homeschooling<br/>
email lists.<br/>
