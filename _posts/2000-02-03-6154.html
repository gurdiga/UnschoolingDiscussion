<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521246477">I&#39;m wondering if anyone has a source for inexpensive craft supplies<br/>
either online or by catalog.  Going to a craft store is a 45 minute<br/>
drive, and being in one is a nightmare with 3 small kids.<br/>
Ideas?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673316465">Hi Ann:<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how cheap they are in comparison to any other online sources,<br/>
but we have purchased a few things from the following site:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.earlychildhood.com/">http://www.earlychildhood.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called &quot;Discount School Supply.&quot; I first got their catalog from a<br/>
friend, then saw the site online. It&#39;s mainly aimed at teachers, so a lot<br/>
of items come in bulk. I hope this helps. See what you think. <br/>

We order from Discount School Supply too.  We&#39;ve gotten some very, very good <br/>
deals through them.  The kids love to get the catalog in the mail and &quot;window <br/>
shop&quot; through it for weeks.  After they&#39;ve had time to evaluate, we usually <br/>
order a couple of things.  Their tempera paint is pretty good ( not superb, <br/>
but fine for run of the mill painting) and very inexpensive.<br/>
