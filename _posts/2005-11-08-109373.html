<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181702052">&quot;I guess I am really<br/>
looking for ideas about how he could meet other children who are<br/>
interested in creative writing, technology and online game creation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of those kids around, it just might take a while to<br/>
find them.<br/>
Hang out at the gaming stores, comic shops etc... there were lots of<br/>
good suggestions for that.<br/>
Heck, don&#39;t wait for those kind of people to show up, put up a flyer! <br/>
Find some adults that have those passions and are willing to hang out<br/>
and show him stuff.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best friendships Trevor had was with an adult friend of<br/>
ours that was a computer geek. They spent HOURS together talking<br/>
technology. Trevor learned a ton of stuff from Jay and was given all<br/>
sorts of old parts to learn with. He ended up building a really good<br/>
computer (which I am using right now) and feeling confident enough to<br/>
learn it all himself now.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t overstate the value of good mentors....people that have<br/>
aquired a high level of skill in something and are willing to simply<br/>
hang out and share their interests. <br/>
