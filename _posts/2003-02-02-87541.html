<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536795354">I was just noticing how my own paradigm shifts were taking place. I think, <br/>
for me, I am almost there on lots of things but reading this list has been <br/>
really helpful in making that final break, you know?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been letting go of a lot of my tv controls, here. My kids are little <br/>
(6, 5 and 3.5), and we didn&#39;t have cable (no reception) for a long time, so <br/>
it was easy to regulate what they watched based on the kinds of videos we <br/>
bought and rented. Now that we have cable and my oldest is 6, I had been <br/>
relaxing quite a bit, and I know that this list has helped me do that even <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been really into Kim Possible for months now--since September <br/>
I guess when Disney released it. My oldest, Emily, is also really into <br/>
Batman and the Justice League, which isn&#39;t on tv, but I&#39;ve been buying her <br/>
some coloring books (have to find a comic store) and borrowing tapes from <br/>
the library. I&#39;ve realized how important it is for her right now to believe <br/>
in heroes and bravery. I think that unschooling has allowed me to see the <br/>
value in what she&#39;s choosing rather than dismissing it.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago we started inviting them to watch Star Wars with us <br/>
sometimes at night. We&#39;ve allowed them to watch the less-scary scenes for a <br/>
long time now, but this time we just let them watch all of it. They really <br/>
like the first one when Annakin Skywalker is young--they can really <br/>
identify. Emily also really connected to the scene in the second one when <br/>
Yoda is teaching all the young paduans. She drew it the next day and <br/>
started talking about making a movie. That night we showed her some of the <br/>
extra stuff on some of the DVD&#39;s about storyboarding and how that&#39;s a <br/>
really important step in making a film. She thought it was really cool.<br/>
<br/>
Those are just some of the really positive moments that stick out in my <br/>
head recently that have come out of my own paradigm shift, for which I&#39;m <br/>
grateful.<br/>

<br/>
LOL!! Good for you all around. On the goodies and the fun stuff for you!! I<br/>
had this image of you twirling around in your living room as I read it!<br/>
<br/>
Today we had a day out with Joseph only. Joe and I took him out and did some<br/>
clothes shopping. He&#39;s getting into what he&#39;s wearing now and choosing the<br/>
longer shorts and bigger shirts. His birthday is on Sunday and we take a day<br/>
with each child to hang out. It&#39;s not the only time we do it, but it&#39;s<br/>
mandatory at birthdays. &lt;bg&gt; So he picked out clothes and a few *presents*<br/>
that he got today. And while we were out, Joe (dh) bought roller blades. 41<br/>
and never roller bladed in his life!!!! He&#39;s got more guts than I do that&#39;s<br/>
for sure!! At 6&#39;2&quot; he has farther to fall. So we took the kids out to the<br/>
school parking lot tonight and let them practice with their scooters and Joe<br/>
got to try his roller blades out. I was impressed for a big old guy!!!<br/>
<br/>
So you can learn to twirl and he can learn to skate. Anyone else trying<br/>
anything new? We can make a parade!!<br/>

Well, not learning any new tricks but certainly refreshing my memory of old ones! I have been twirling all over the house..sitting reading a book in the recliner with my arm dangling over the side twirling away...<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty cool about your DH picking up blading. I am making plans to pick up a set of skates for myself...I sure have been happier lately since letting go, and remembering how to be my true self instead of how I think I &quot;should&quot; be. <br/>

I had no problem happily buying them to surprise my daughter so close to Christmas. I&#39;ve given up Martha Stewart fantasies as my kids&#39; Lego table, wooden blocks and easel have become part of the kitchen, their wooden train set is wound around the coffee table in the living room and I&#39;m planning a storage center/seat and shelving in one area in the living room for their toys. I now feel good when my living room floor is cluttered with toys insteas of rageful. I used to think their bedroom was theirs but the house was mine. I now look at their bedroom as a santuary (as I see mine) and everyother room as theirs as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thats the truth.  I went through this whole ordeal with getting the <br/>
baby rooms just right for both my boys.  They rarely used the rooms <br/>
the first year except maybe to sleep.  Now they share a room for <br/>
sleeping and have the other for a nice playroom for all their toys.  <br/>
People always seem so concerned about kids sharing rooms.  It works <br/>
far batter for us and we will deal with changing things around once <br/>
they want that seperation.  It is extra security to share a room <br/>
with someone.    <br/>
<br/>
We have a spare bedroom now that we are setting up the Legos in.  We <br/>
have alot of the Harry Potter set and I hated to leave it where any <br/>
visitors could trash it and lose the pieces.  This way they can <br/>
leave it up or build it as they like and it is safe.  I am also <br/>
putting my art supplies in there to start working on my art again <br/>
(thank goodness!!!!!!!!!!).  That room is eventually been earmarked <br/>
for the next baby that rolls around (who knows when)!  I have to <br/>
admit being a bit torn.  The old baby sets I have would look awfully <br/>
cute in there but I think by the time we get around to baby 3, I <br/>
won&#39;t be willing to give up the space and most likely logic will set <br/>
in as I know we would hardly use it!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893522065">I&#39;m not replying to anything in specific, just the idea of decorating children&#39;s rooms..nurseries were brought up specifically though...ANYWAY...<br/>
<br/>
I was reading some teen novel I picked up at my friend&#39;s house and the character mentions that her walls are covered in her own artwork directly on the walls...graffiti-like. Started when she was 2 and got ahold of a crayon when she was supposed to be napping. Her parents kept it up on the wall, and allowed her to move on from there. <br/>
<br/>
It struck me...how cool is that?! I think there was a similar article not too long ago in HEM about parents who let their child paint on his walls, and it was about the same graffiti-ish look...it also caught my attention. Twice here lately...<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, while I REALLY don&#39;t mind children&#39;s art on the walls, or ON the walls themselves, Paul does. But I talked to him about it and he says he doesn&#39;t care as long as 1) it&#39;s washable marker/crayon and 2) I personally do the scrubbing before any inspection. He says it looks awful...but all I see is budding talent and personality (the culprit being my two year old free-spirit Megan). <br/>
<br/>
So guess what I&#39;ll be picking up on my next shopping trip? I&#39;ll have to take some pictures to save for her. I can easily picture Megan with some sunlit attic studio in her future...unless she&#39;s on stage (here lately she&#39;s taken to standing on the table saying &quot;Ta-DA&quot; with her arms outstretched, has been standing/dancing on the table ..sometimes naked..since she could walk at 10 months). <br/>

<br/>
We are so looking forward to Jayn having her own room for all or most of her<br/>
stuff to be in. She is full of ideas for decorating it and likes looking at<br/>
catalogues with pictures of children&#39;s rooms. James has the idea that she<br/>
will sleep in there, but I&#39;m not sure that it will work out that way. I am<br/>
looking forward to it as a storage solution - at the moment we have only one<br/>
bedroom (so her stuff is in there too) and use the dining area as an office<br/>
so the living room is multi-tasking as family room, dining room, sewing room<br/>
and Jayn&#39;s playroom. I turned the &quot;coat closet&quot; in the living room into<br/>
Jayn&#39;s tiny play room and since she sometimes likes to play privately there<br/>
(as well as have a storage area) I imagine that her own room will be used in<br/>
the same way. James has the idea that her toys won&#39;t migrate, but I doubt<br/>
that heartily. The other things we are looking forward to are a<br/>
sewing/crafts room that we will share, a radio shack for James&#39; electronic<br/>
gizmos, and a garden.<br/>

I was thinking about doing the same thing.  Too bad this isn&#39;t our forever house or I wouldn&#39;t complain when my Dd does it. <br/>
<br/>
There is a type of painting/wall treatment (popular in the waldorf community) called something like lazuer (sp?).  Where you paint the wall with a white non absorbent paint.  Then you use washable/watercolor paints to make a color effect, soft and relaxing that can be washed off and redone each season.  Thought that sounded pretty cool.  It might be an idea for your daughter as long as she doesn&#39;t use pens that would make indents in the paint surface.  Ikea also has those magnet boards that you can write on.  You can get sheets of plexi glass type stuff to write on to.  There is the chalkboard paint I think comes in more then one colour (they also make magnetic paint you can use under regular paint)<br/>
 You could also let her go wild in her closet where Daddy doesn&#39;t see it.  What do mean &quot;inspection&quot;? Does he do the white glove test and make sure your cleaning her room properly.  I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s just plain wrong.  Assuming I&#39;ve read your post right.  You can come live with me and my Dh.  He blusters a bit at my lack of housecleaning but would never presume to not &#39;allow&#39; me to do something.  He&#39;s not my Daddy he&#39;s my Mate, partner, other half, legal description husband doesn&#39;t give him authority over me.  If he has a problem he talks to me about it.  Sorry if I read you wrong I don&#39;t mean to attack I&#39;m just really really sensitive to the whole &quot;Husband in control of his wife&quot; issue.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not replying to anything in specific, just the idea of decorating<br/>
children&#39;s rooms..nurseries were brought up specifically though...ANYWAY...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was reading some teen novel I picked up at my friend&#39;s house and the<br/>
character mentions that Started when she was 2 and got ahold of a crayon<br/>
when she was supposed to be napping. Her parents kept it up on the wall, and<br/>
allowed her to move on from there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It struck me...how cool is that?! I think there was a similar article not<br/>
too long ago in HEM about parents who let their child paint on his walls,<br/>
and it was about the same graffiti-ish look...it also caught my attention.<br/>
Twice here lately...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, while I REALLY don&#39;t mind children&#39;s art on the walls, or<br/>
ON the walls themselves, Paul does. But I talked to him about it and he says<br/>
he doesn&#39;t care as long as 1) it&#39;s washable marker/crayon and 2) I<br/>
personally do the scrubbing before any inspection. He says it looks<br/>
awful...but all I see is budding talent and personality (the culprit being<br/>
my two year old free-spirit Megan).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So guess what I&#39;ll be picking up on my next shopping trip? I&#39;ll have to<br/>
take some pictures to save for her. I can easily picture Megan with some<br/>
sunlit attic studio in her future...unless she&#39;s on stage (here lately she&#39;s<br/>
taken to standing on the table saying &quot;Ta-DA&quot; with her arms outstretched,<br/>
has been standing/dancing on the table ..sometimes naked..since she could<br/>
walk at 10 months).<br/>

 <br/>
My husband is in the Coast Guard. We live in military housing, and have a yearly inspection. We&#39;re liable for any damages to the property, and while having been a house painter for a living, Paul doesn&#39;t want to have to repaint anything when we&#39;re looking to move. To me it&#39;s not a big deal if we have to repaint a couple walls, and I&#39;d gladly do the work myself....but in general, despite agreeing with me about homeschooling (he&#39;s not wild about unschooling per se, but figures I&#39;ve got it under control) he&#39;s very much my polar opposite in some ways. <br/>
 <br/>
I talked about painting that area (it&#39;s the hallway that is her preferred canvas) with chalkboard paint, or putting up a couple large markerboards to take down and move with us...or even getting rolls of butcher paper from a school-supply catalog I have and taping sheets of it along the wall...and the only thing he&#39;s agreed to is just using washable marker/crayon. <br/>
 <br/>
Also, like I said, he just sees &quot;mess&quot; and not the artistry or creativity of it. <br/>

expensive chalkboards from Pottery Barn or something hanging on my wall. I <br/>
keep my monthly calendar chalked up on it.<br/>
<br/>
In the kitchen, dh and I built a floor to ceiling chalkboard on the bottom <br/>
and top, with a corkboard for artwork in the middle. The kids get the <br/>
chalkboard on the bottom to play with while I use the top one for grocery <br/>
lists, phone numbers, etc.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;m just buying used or very cheap furniture for the next ten years. My mother always used to (well, still does) go on about what she lost when we were kids and how kids should be taught to respect furniture. She would buy nice furniture and moan a year later when it was marked or banged. She had four kids, two were diagnosed ADHD, what did she expect??? <br/>
  I had her attitude for a little while. I&#39;d look at our grey velour monster couch and wish for a nice one. I&#39;m over that now. A nice one would be peed on, marked on, jumped on, spilled on in no time and likely not be half as comfortable. :) <br/>

I also have a &quot;grey velour monster couch&quot; donated to me by a friend who was <br/>
moving.  I hate the way it looks, but it&#39;s so comfortable (that&#39;s where I <br/>
sleep).  Ex-MIL recently wanted to buy us a new sofa because she felt guilty that <br/>
we can&#39;t afford nice furniture like my exhusband and his wife have.  Luckily I <br/>
was able to persuade her to get us a nice new computer instead!  It&#39;s gotten <br/>
so much use, and I don&#39;t have to tell my children to be careful not to ruin the <br/>
sofa Nana got them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988134532">Another thing you can do is paint Magnetic Paint first then paint chalkboard <br/>
paint over it then you you have a magnetice chalkboard!  <br/>
<br/>
I have heard that you need at least three coats of  the magnetic paint to make <br/>
it work well.<br/>

Me too, me too, me too, and though it folds out into a bed, it&#39;s WAY more <br/>
comfortable just the way it is.  UGLY and stained, but perfect to sit on or sleep <br/>
on.<br/>
