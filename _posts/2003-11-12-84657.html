certain if anyone ever responded to this question.<br/>
<br/>
Moon, you&#39;ve only been with us since August, right?  And I take it <br/>
from this post that you are the young person in the family?  And both <br/>
your parents work?<br/>
<br/>
Tell us more about how you came to be unschooling and what your <br/>
situation is, would you?<br/>
<br/>
It certainly is possible to unschool while your parents work, but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re too happy with it.  Have I read you wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of reading, have you read The Teenage Liberation Handbook by <br/>
Grace Llewellyn?<br/>
<br/>
Also, how old are you?  We have lots of lists for unschooled <br/>
teenagers that you might like too.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Laura B.</div>
