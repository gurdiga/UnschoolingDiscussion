<br/>
There was no tax write-off.<br/>
<br/>
He was here to speak English and experience *our* culture, not for us to learn to speak German.<br/>
<br/>
He was in a school (so you&#39;d have to deal with a school&#39;s schedule).<br/>
<br/>
And *WE* were in charge of his living expenses---not just room & board, but living expenses as if he were *our* child for the year.<br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers, we don&#39;t &quot;study&quot; a country a year---we tend to learn about many different countries in bits and pieces throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe send your own child on one of the many exchange programs already in place? There are many!<br/>

another country. Most exchange groups are set up so the student goes <br/>
to school, so it might fill a need for international homeschoolers. <br/>
Otherwise, i think it would be better to go with an established <br/>
organization. There are situations that arise in which the &quot;fit&quot; <br/>
isnt right, and the student asks to be placed with another family, <br/>
so with an established group there are more options. And the point <br/>
of the student coming here would be to immerse him/herself in OUR <br/>
culture, not really vice versa (although you would learn alot about <br/>
another culture anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
If you want that same kind of immersion, why not try visiting areas <br/>
in your city that have a large percentage of whatever nationality <br/>
you are focusing on. Visit ethnic restaurants, go to festivals, rent <br/>
movies in that language, etc. <br/>
