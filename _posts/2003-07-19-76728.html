<br/>
IMO, when a child is constantly controlled by a parent, and then given <br/>
freedom that they have no idea to do with, drug addiction can be a danger.  They <br/>
choose to let the drug become their controller. <br/>
<br/>
Has nothing, specifically, to do with church or religion, altho that can be <br/>
one way to control children. Honor your mother and father can too often turn <br/>
into a power trip over kids.  &quot;You&#39;ll go to hell if you don&#39;t listen and do as I <br/>
say.&quot; I&#39;ve heard it said.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to hear that you had a rough past.<br/>
<br/>
There are many factors that may cause a person to develop addictive behaviors.  It is obviously far more complex than what religion one&#39;s parents may have had or not had.<br/>
<br/>
A parent can make all choices for their children because of a belief that children are not capable of making good choices.  Or a parent can believe that children are capable of making good choices and the parent can do their best to help their children be informed, to trust the child to make decisions and to be there as a safety net for their children, when necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I have done many things to help my children understand the danger of cars and how to safely cross streets since the day they could toddle on their own.  Now they are 7 & 10 and I still make it a point to help them remember traffic safety and to model it myself.  They have no reason to defiantly run into the street, and it wouldn&#39;t make sense to punish them if they did.  What message does that give a small child?  If you run into the street (danger) I, the person who loves you, will hit you (danger).  Do you want your child to do what you ask because they fear your response if they don&#39;t?  Do you want your child to later do what his teen friends ask him to do, because he has learned to do what others want for him, rather than what he wants for himself?  Or do you want him to grow up knowing that his parents trust him and will be his partner, rather than his controller?<br/>
<br/>
Some adults do not take their children to the doctor for regular check-ups.  That doesn&#39;t equal neglect if the parent is making an informed choice and doing what they can for their family to promote wellness.  Many parents do not force their children to get shots because the parent has made an informed choice that the child is better off without the shots.  A child raised without vaccines can certainly choose to get them when they are older, if they wish.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, what if your kids really, really don&#39;t want to go to the doctor?  What if <br/>
they hate the taste of the medication that they must take?  What if you&#39;re <br/>
out of food, and they don&#39;t want to go with you to the grocery store, and you <br/>
don&#39;t have anyone to come over and babysit?  What if they &quot;refuse&quot; to ever be <br/>
left with a sitter, even though you as the adult have a real need to take a <br/>
class, go to a meeting that doesn&#39;t allow children, or even get away for a little <br/>
while?  You have needs, too.  And kids don&#39;t always know what&#39;s best for them. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an unschooler because I believe kids learn best when they choose what <br/>
they want to learn, when they want to learn it.  But I don&#39;t believe kids are <br/>
automatically experts on everything they need to survive.  You do have the <br/>
responsibility to keep them safe until they are old enough to keep themself safe.  <br/>
<br/>
In my neighborhood, safety means more than just staying out of the <br/>
intersection.  You can get beaten up or worse just for &quot;dissin&quot; somebody.   So teaching <br/>
manners, social skills, and the like is very much a part of survival.  <br/>

YES.  When he is older he will be able to reason things out for himself.  It is <br/>
absurd to compare a three year old with a teenager in this respect since he has <br/>
a reasoning ability that the three year old does not.  <br/>
<br/>
But if it comes right down it, we all SOMETIMES do things out of fear.  Fear <br/>
is a biological function essential to our survival, not something to get <br/>
eliminate entirely.  Why do you file your taxes on time?  It can&#39;t possibly be that <br/>
you agree with everything the government is going to use the money for!  You <br/>
file your taxes because you don&#39;t want to go to prison.  My kids see me doing <br/>
our taxes, they know that there are things you just plain have to do, end of <br/>
discussion.  I go to the library at least once a week, the kids come along <br/>
whether they feel like or not.  They might spend their time playing video games on <br/>
the library computers, but they come.<br/>
<br/>
Each family has their own list of things that they &quot;just plain do&quot;.  Brush <br/>
your teeth, go to religious services, whatever.  Your list may not be the same <br/>
as mine but you certainly have one, whether you admit or not. It doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to be a big deal.  My kids know they have a lot more freedom than most kids <br/>
their age.  But nobody is absolutely free.  <br/>

same guy or gal who has given him shots in the past?  I know adults who hate <br/>
going to the doctor, and put it off to ridiculous lengths!  In any case, you <br/>
are arguing with the analogy, and unrealistically denying even the possibility <br/>
that a child might refuse to do something the parent considers essential for <br/>
his well-being.  It may be that YOUR kids were born with compliant <br/>
personalities, but not all kids are that way.  I do not agree that this is somehow the <br/>
parent&#39;s fault.  We all inherit our basic disposition and temperament.  Some kids <br/>
even have conditions, ADHD for example, that make them unusually careless or <br/>
impulsive, and they need more reminders and more supervision.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380913786">Message to pediatricians: advise parents to limit movie access to <br/>
reduce chances of teen smoking<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HANOVER, NH � Dartmouth researchers have taken their published data on <br/>
the connections between adolescent smoking and watching movies and are <br/>
now advising pediatricians to urge parents to monitor their teens&#39; <br/>
access to movies and abide by the ratings guidelines sponsored by the <br/>
Motion Picture Association of America and the National Association of <br/>
Theatre Owners.<br/>
<br/>
The researchers are from Dartmouth Medical School, Dartmouth College <br/>
and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical <br/>
Center, and their study appears in the July issue of Archives of <br/>
Pediatric Adolescent Medicine. The research was supported by the <br/>
National Cancer Institute.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We want pediatricians to talk with parents of adolescents about how <br/>
movies can influence their young teenagers,&quot; says James Sargent, a <br/>
pediatrician with the Norris Cotton Cancer Center and an associate <br/>
professor at Dartmouth Medical School.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parents need to know that if they can reduce their child&#39;s exposure to <br/>
smoking in movies, it may have a profound impact on reducing their <br/>
chances of starting to smoke and drink.&quot; Sargent&#39;s team studies <br/>
adolescent behavior and how it&#39;s linked to exposure to movies. They <br/>
have published numerous papers and articles, which this most current <br/>
study cites. According to this body of research, adolescents see <br/>
thousands of depictions of smoking by movie stars, and these images <br/>
influence their attitude and behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Sargent and his colleagues urge pediatricians to use the published <br/>
data (see &quot;Related Findings&quot; below) to offer specific advice to parents <br/>
on how to limit access to movies, such as reducing subscriptions to <br/>
movie channels, limiting videos to one per week, and restricting access <br/>
to R-rated movies. They conclude that, &quot;Such parenting measures could <br/>
reduce rates of adolescent smoking without directly addressing the <br/>
behavior.&quot;<br/>

** It may be that YOUR kids were born with compliant<br/>
&gt; personalities, but not all kids are that way.  **<br/>
<br/>
I do have a son who is that way,  not compliant in some peoples terms, but I<br/>
would make it work.   Its what brought us to unschooling.  I remember when<br/>
he was a toddler and he didn&#39;t want eye drops in his eyes.   We talked and<br/>
talked and talked.   He would eventually let us,  he hated, I hated it,  but<br/>
he allowed us to do it.  It was a medication that he *had* to take.  He also<br/>
has allergies and asthma.  So I&#39;ve dealth with meds alot.  If he didn&#39;t like<br/>
the taste I would figure out a way to hide it.   And if he really wasn&#39;t in<br/>
dire need,  that medication wasn&#39;t worth it.    There are ways of making our<br/>
children&#39;s lives more peaceful and that&#39;s why I am here.<br/>
<br/>
As far as an apendectomy,, please,,,if a child were going to die....  I<br/>
think these are extreme examples.   Of course we would do a life saving<br/>
procedure for a child.   But people are not talking about that.<br/>
<br/>
You are going to the extremes.<br/>
<br/>
**Some kids<br/>
&gt; even have conditions, ADHD for example, that make them unusually careless<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; impulsive, and they need more reminders and more supervision. **<br/>
<br/>
My son has sensory integration issues, Asperger related and would probably<br/>
be classified as ADHD if he were in school,  but we talk and figure it out.<br/>
Yes it was more difficult when he was younger, we had to be more patient.<br/>
There are solutions and alternatives.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a funny analogy and I must respond.  My children have a very healthy <br/>
fear of Western medicine ~ they saw firsthand the effects of *cancer <br/>
treatment* on their daddy (cancer didn&#39;t make him sick, but that chemo sure did!!)  At <br/>
4 & 2 they were perfect skeptics &lt;bg&gt; But this journey began looooong before <br/>
daddy&#39;s illness ~ I trusted *my* body to do it&#39;s job to grow and birthe these <br/>
babies, I trusted them to nurse whenever they needed, to sleep whenever they <br/>
needed, to heal whatever bug infiltrated their system.  I trusted my children to <br/>
be whole, complete and perfect at birth: their genitals are intact and I <br/>
waived the state/federal mandated *treatments* (e.g. eye goo, vit K, vaccinations) <br/>
for them.  <br/>
My best example of this faith in action: Hayden was about 3 and his penis got <br/>
slammed by the falling toilet seat.  He calmly came out of the bathroom and <br/>
asked for a Band-Aid, without even looking, I found one for him and asked where <br/>
he wanted it ~ imagine my shock when I saw the *purple grape* where his <br/>
perfect lil penis had been, just moments before.  I completely freaked out, and he <br/>
shut down, not giving me any information.  I put the Band-Aid on the *wound* <br/>
and let him be (so I could calm the %$#*&^* down and gain perspective).  After <br/>
calling my trusted Aunt Donna, I remembered how resilient our bodies are and I <br/>
knew worst case scenarios for my two choices ~ at the hospital: the horror on <br/>
the faces of strangers while looking at his penis, the circumstraint (aka the <br/>
Velcro crucifix), the medications to *calm the patient*, the forcible <br/>
retraction of his adhered foreskin and probable/likely circumcision, tetanus shot ~ <br/>
at home: penile dysfunction, urinary issues, infection ... a HUGE leap of <br/>
faith, I watched his function closely, he could still pee without pain, though the <br/>
sight was still shocking, I could accept his body healing itself.  And it did! <br/>
 I am so glad I didn&#39;t have to put my baby thru any unnecessary trauma in the <br/>
name of *the right thing to do* (seeing mommy meltdown was enough!).  We <br/>
discuss regularly what constitutes a necessary visit to the doctor and what we can <br/>
care for ourselves (with meds or without).  When a trauma occurs, like the <br/>
one above, I&#39;m honest and open about being able to heal ourselves and the <br/>
necessity of seeing a professional (NOT necessarily an MD).<br/>
So no, I don&#39;t see forcing our kids to do things arbitrarily an effective <br/>
parenting practice.  We do grocery shopping because it&#39;s necessary, but we do it <br/>
together because it&#39;s fun.  We go to fellowship almost every Sunday, not <br/>
because it&#39;s *required* but because it&#39;s fun (if majority wants to stay home, we <br/>
all stay home).  Not to say I don&#39;t fall back on the *familiar* ways of <br/>
parenting, I get crabby and tired too, but in the forefront of my mind is my child&#39;s <br/>
perspective and the lessons they are learning from my behaviors and my <br/>
parenting choices.  Unschooling LIFE is my current project.  The leftover shadows of <br/>
authoritarian parenting are diminishing and my children are flourishing (so am <br/>
I!!).  I trust that I have the right children and they have the right mom ~ <br/>
having them and this life has led us right where we need to be ~ and I like it <br/>
here &lt;bg&gt; <br/>

simply born with temperaments that are noncompliant contrary <br/>
ultrasensitive and so on really don&#39;t know what it is like. I know a <br/>
kid &lt;g&gt; who ran every single time her feet hit the ground - from the <br/>
time she was nine months old. She had to be held sometimes - when we <br/>
were getting on an airplane, for example, whether she liked it or not. <br/>
What is unrealistic is to think I&#39;d have ALWAYS have planned ahead for <br/>
all possible contingencies. She&#39;s 18 now and I&#39;m just saying goodbye to <br/>
her because she&#39;s going on a 4 month trip by herself - visiting <br/>
unschooling friends all over the country. She&#39;s STILL impulsive and <br/>
high-energy and, yes, noncompliant - a whole lot like her mom &lt;G&gt;. <br/>
Luckily she&#39;s also very intelligent and reasonable and people-smart and <br/>
loves life. I&#39;ll actually get to SEE her for a couple of days a month <br/>
from now at the Sacramento conference. YAY!!!!<br/>

There may be some sweet little girls out there who always go along with <br/>
whatever their mommy wants when it is &quot;explained&quot; to them, but I have two very <br/>
active boys. One of them was diagnosed as having &quot;oppositional defiant disorder&quot; <br/>
while my dh and I were separated, although he is acting much better now that <br/>
we&#39;re back together.  Nevertheless, there have been many times when I simply had <br/>
to force him to do things he didn&#39;t want to do!  He&#39;s too young to stay home <br/>
alone so if the parents go somewhere, he HAS to come along.  (I do not drive <br/>
due to a medical problem, so I have to take him when the bus is coming, not when <br/>
he might be in a better mood.  I live hundreds of miles from the nearest <br/>
relative and certainly can&#39;t afford baby sitters.)  Neither child enjoys doctor <br/>
and dentist visits, but they know that certain things are simply nonnegotiable <br/>
and that&#39;s one of them.  This is simply reality as an inner city mom without a <br/>
car experiences it.  It isn&#39;t the least bit hypothetical.<br/>

understand the reasoning behind the rules.  (This assumes, of course, that he <br/>
is old enough to understand.)  Kids learn a great deal from these discussions, <br/>
and they respect that a lot better than arbitrarily laying down the law.  <br/>
Still, ultimately they have to understand that YOU are the parent and have the <br/>
final say, precisely because emergencies can arise unpredictably.  <br/>
<br/>
They might perhaps arise more often in some circumstances than in others.  <br/>
For example, do the children in your neighborhood walk uninvited into your house <br/>
and refuse to leave when you or your children gently ask them to (because a <br/>
family member is sleeping, say)?  This happens all the time where I live!  I <br/>
have had to put my foot down, even threaten to call the cops, precisely because <br/>
these underprivileged, fatherless kids apparently had no parenting whatsoever, <br/>
and zero respect for adults.  There are even kids I have refused to allow my <br/>
kids to play with at all, because they repeatedly stole, broke things, and <br/>
refused to follow the most basic house rules or safety precautions as a guest in <br/>
my home.  (I am referring to preteens and young teenagers, not three year olds <br/>
who might have some excuse for their ignorance.)  That is the other side of t<br/>
he &quot;authoritarian parenting&quot; coin.  <br/>

though? You see, even a complete democracy requires that not everybody gets their <br/>
way all the time!  We run into this issue a lot at home because one child <br/>
will want to go to the pool and the other doesn&#39;t.  The 12 year old is perhaps <br/>
old enough to stay home by himself for an hour, but not quite old enough to <br/>
babysit.  The 6 year old protests that this isn&#39;t fair, because he&#39;s forced to go <br/>
swimming when he&#39;d rather play video games, so why shouldn&#39;t his brother have <br/>
to go when the shoe is on the other foot?    In practice, I take refuge in the <br/>
laws of my state, which requires P.E. for homeschoolers.  I just homeschool <br/>
year round, and insist on regular pool attendance &quot;because it&#39;s the law!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But in all seriousness, if you have more than one child you cannot allow one <br/>
of them to veto all family activities, can you?  And you cannot always have <br/>
consensus either.  So how do you handle these situations?  Anyone?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Um, I am.  I was talking about reality as I have lived it with my own<br/>
kids.  <br/>
There may be some sweet little girls out there who always go along with <br/>
whatever their mommy wants when it is &quot;explained&quot; to them, but I have<br/>
two very <br/>
active boys. One of them was diagnosed as having &quot;oppositional defiant<br/>
disorder&quot; <br/>
while my dh and I were separated, although he is acting much better now<br/>
that <br/>
we&#39;re back together.  Nevertheless, there have been many times when I<br/>
simply had <br/>
to force him to do things he didn&#39;t want to do!  He&#39;s too young to stay<br/>
home <br/>
alone so if the parents go somewhere, he HAS to come along.  (I do not<br/>
drive <br/>
due to a medical problem, so I have to take him when the bus is coming,<br/>
not when <br/>
he might be in a better mood.  I live hundreds of miles from the nearest<br/>
<br/>
relative and certainly can&#39;t afford baby sitters.)  Neither child enjoys<br/>
doctor <br/>
and dentist visits, but they know that certain things are simply<br/>
nonnegotiable <br/>
and that&#39;s one of them.  This is simply reality as an inner city mom<br/>
without a <br/>
car experiences it.  It isn&#39;t the least bit hypothetical.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Your job as a parent is to protect them. So control their environment -<br/>
&gt; &gt; hold their hands when you&#39;re near streets, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is obvious that you have never tried getting onto a bus at a busy<br/>
&gt; intersection with several bags of groceries and a hyperactive, defiant <br/>
&gt; child who was<br/>
&gt; quite capable of pulling away violently.  I once had an entire crowd <br/>
&gt; of people<br/>
&gt; CHEER when I finally gave him a swat!  There have been very few times <br/>
&gt; when<br/>
&gt; this was necessary, but that was one of them, I&#39;m afraid. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to me that parents should know their children well enough that <br/>
they don&#39;t put their children in a position such as the one you describe <br/>
above.  <br/>
<br/>
And I personally would not have cheered.  I do not believe that parents <br/>
have a right to subject their children to violence, aka spankings or <br/>
swats, regardless of the circumstances.  Ever.  In my opinion violence <br/>
against a child is never necessary.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027851859">I really think you missed my point here..... <br/>
 <br/>
It had nothing to do with church.  It had to do with being forced to do things, period.   <br/>
<br/>
Do you think you became an addict because your parents were atheists who didn&#39;t drag you to church?<br/>

  Do you really believe that being taken to church as a child, even against your will, is what turns you into a drug addict later on?  <br/>
  We can agree to disagree about spanking--I think it is acceptable for very young children when they do something dangerous like run into the street.  And obviously we all agree that kids shouldn&#39;t be forced to go to school if parents are in a position to keep them home.  But saying kids should never be forced to do ANYTHING they don&#39;t want to do is simply unrealistic.  If you took that philosophy seriously enough, you would end up having your children removed, <br/>
  since you would never even take them to the doctor&#39;s office.<br/>
<br/>
  I was raised by atheists who never forced me to do anything, since they didn&#39;t give a damn about me.  And I&#39;m a former alcoholic/addict.<br/>
