This is sad, and I read your whole post almost without remembering to breathe.<br/>
<br/>
Children are pretty good at putting ugly memories away if they get filled up <br/>
with better ones, so I don&#39;t think the perspective you have now will last <br/>
long.  School will become a tiny blip in the past instead of a dark mountain <br/>
shadowing your days.<br/>
<br/>
There is a woman I&#39;ve known since I was a teenager and she already had kids.  <br/>
I knew her for years before I realized one of her arms is almost entirely <br/>
non-functional.  She probably was given much grief in school about it, but <br/>
she cooks and sews (like a world-class artist, in both fields) and does all <br/>
kinds of things and I just hadn&#39;t even seen it.  Hers was a birth injury.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436296861">Thanks Sandra...it isn&#39;t the feeling I always have....just when I <br/>
get on a roll and dredge it up again.  I know that with time those <br/>
wounds will heal, but it angers me that they are there to begin <br/>
with.  And yes, I probably wrote the whole post without remembering <br/>
to breathe!!  &lt;pulling out my tai chi tape&gt; I am scheduled to go <br/>
into the school for his IEP review to see if any services can still <br/>
be given along with our homeschooling.  I am planning on continuing <br/>
speech and OT therapy, but it is really hard to go in the school.  <br/>
Especially since the principal thinks I&#39;m &quot;nuts.&quot;  Oh well - won&#39;t <br/>
be the last person to think that :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227482900">Exactly!  That is what I am working with right now.  She told my <br/>
husband that she doesn&#39;t want to learn to read...she gives up on <br/>

unschooling we don&#39;t do schoolish things!<br/>

<br/>
You could tell her &quot;You don&#39;t have to read.  You can live with me forever and <br/>
I will read to you anytime you need something read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gradually she&#39;ll learn to read in spite of all else, but that might be a warm <br/>
comfy blanket for her while she&#39;s recovering.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her I know teens who didn&#39;t read until they were teens.  Two are in the <br/>
other room right now.  (Their mom, Carol, wrote it up, and it&#39;s at <br/>
