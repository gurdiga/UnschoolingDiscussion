  &gt;   &lt;&lt;I&#39;m also thinking about making the drive up, and trying to convince<br/>
some<br/>
  &gt; of my local unschooling group to head up there too. I&#39;m trying to decide<br/>
  &gt; between going by myself or talking my family into coming. Dh would not<br/>
be<br/>
  &gt; into it, but I&#39;m wondering how many little children might be attending.<br/>
Mine<br/>
  &gt; are 6, 5 and 3.5, so I&#39;m just not sure that they would get much out of<br/>
it,<br/>
  &gt; you know?  It could be fun to just road trip with some of the other moms<br/>
  &gt; here. What would you all suggest?&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; When we went last year, Jayn was 3.5 and she still talks about the hotel<br/>
  &gt; where she met Heather (Shyrley&#39;s daughter). It is true that I missed a<br/>
  &gt; couple of sessions, and spent less time just talking in groups than I<br/>
would<br/>
  &gt; have without Jayn there. However it was great for her to play and meet<br/>
  &gt; others also. With my DH, James attending, we did as we always do, and<br/>
  &gt; switched out who was supervising Jayn. This worked very well. Road<br/>
tripping<br/>
  &gt; with Mom&#39;s would probably be fantastic. OTOH I really loved seeing the<br/>
  &gt; children, as well as the Moms. I say to you find any way of going in any<br/>
  &gt; combination - some people bring only some of their children, some bring<br/>
all,<br/>
  &gt; others none. My DH attended the father&#39;s meeting (in the Sports Bar) and<br/>
  &gt; apparently there were plenty of questioning dads who were given a lot to<br/>
  &gt; think about. I don&#39;t know exactly what, since there was a vow of secrecy<br/>
  &gt; taken.<br/>
