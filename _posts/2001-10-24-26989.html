 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m unlurking(?) for a minute to say hi!  I grew up in Jamestown.  <br/>
Actually Fluvanna. My family lived there from 1976-1981.  I still <br/>
have a soft spot for that part of the country.  Its really pretty <br/>
around there.<br/>
 How are the laws around there?  Do you have to jump through many <br/>
hoops?  Are there any support groups?  I have a friend who still <br/>
lives in Jamestown and would like to suggest homeschooling to her and <br/>
it would be nice to have the inside scoop.  Feel free to e-mail me <br/>
privately if you&#39;d rather.  Djuana</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to email Liza off-list about all this NYC stuff, but just in case<br/>
anyone was confused, no, it&#39;s not a homeschooling conference.  It&#39;s American<br/>
String Teachers Association, which is my professional organization.  3 days<br/>
of string players talking jargon.  Sounds great, to me, at least....<br/>
