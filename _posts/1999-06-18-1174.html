<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049675372">Well, it&#39;s fine if ds doesn&#39;t like bread crust, but we really are VERY <br/>
poor and are lucky to have enough to eat at all.  That&#39;s why he must <br/>
eat the crust.  We just can&#39;t afford to waste it.  (That&#39;s also why <br/>
we&#39;re looking for a job in the states...)  BTW, he loves ALL his <br/>
vegetables (even cabbage and broccoli!) except spinach and green <br/>
peppers and he will eat those if I chop them up really small and hide <br/>
them in other foods.  When he was younger, I&#39;d dry out the bread crusts <br/>
in the freezer and the next day I&#39;d pour milk on it like cereal.  He <br/>
used to love it.  Now he prefers it with the rest of the bread.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t like it, but he understands we don&#39;t waste food.<br/>
