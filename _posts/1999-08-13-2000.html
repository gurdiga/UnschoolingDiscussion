<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247492155"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My younger one, now age 9 and reading just fine, saw the teaching of<br/>
&gt;phonics as an insult!  She wanted to know what the words said (meant) so<br/>
&gt;she could make use of them to understand her world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My youngest, now 12, began to read at 4 by peering over my shoulder while I<br/>
read to them and asking &quot;what is that word&quot;. I think she was reading long<br/>
before she let on to us. She absorbed whole words and plugged them into her<br/>
memory bank. When it came time to show mom that she could read of course<br/>
there were words that she did not know and she was really resistant to<br/>
sounding them out. So I did it for her and then put the word back together<br/>
and then she went on. <br/>
<br/>
Eventually she was able to do this for herself, or she would just skip the<br/>
word and go on just using the context.<br/>
<br/>
At 4 1/2 when she wanted to take chapter books from the library I<br/>
discouraged her thinking that it was just extra weight to carry back and<br/>
forth. She did prove herself by reading practically every Hardy Boy book in<br/>
the place!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  interesting observation that she was reading long before she let <br/>
on.  Sterling (3yo in May) has just entered a phase where he <br/>
interrupts me constantly during his bedtime reading with &quot;what&#39;s that <br/>
say&quot; or &quot;where does it say earth - which one is earth&quot;.  so we&#39;ll <br/>
pick on that word for the night.  i also show him how it is sounded <br/>
out since he knows his letter sounds. then everytime i come to that <br/>
word later in the book, i&#39;ll point at it.  the first few times, he <br/>
reads it.  then he&#39;ll start in with &quot;i don&#39;t know, you do it&quot;.  about <br/>
the time i&#39;m going to say it and move on, he blurts it out.  and this <br/>
part i really like....  when i forget to stop and point and read <br/>
over it, he catches me and says &quot;HEY! I&#39;m suppose to do that <br/>
one!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
  so yes...  i do believe they can read a lot more than they often <br/>
let on - why they seem to want to conceal it, i don&#39;t know.<br/>

Yep, my seven year old does this, conceals it.  The little guy is <br/>
embarrassed.  I think he figures it&#39;s not good enough (odd perfectionist that <br/>
he is) and avoids openly reading until he&#39;s *sure* he&#39;s got it.  We&#39;ve never <br/>
done any formal reading lessons, although I&#39;ve had hints that he was reading, <br/>
&quot;Mom, you&#39;re turning and that sign says no left turn&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m turning right son <br/>
:) &quot;   Most of what he&#39;s learned has come from reading Nintendo game manuals <br/>
I&#39;m sure....  Which is great except for the Kong manuals which switches game <br/>
words by using K&#39;s everywhere.  Luckily, he picked up on it pretty quick <br/>
pointing out that the words Krash in the game names, and crash in the body <br/>
are two different spellings.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  you might have something there!  i hadn&#39;t thought about it cuz <br/>
Sterling is a very &quot;outward&quot; person and doesn&#39;t ever seem to hold <br/>
anything back.  so it surprised me to watch him do this.  but he is <br/>
also a little perfectionist and i bet when it comes to reading, that <br/>
side of him is taking over!  thanks!  <br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve never done any formal reading lessons,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  isn&#39;t it great?  i&#39;ll never forget the day he was looking over my <br/>
shoulder at the computer and started shouting &quot;HELP, HELP, it says <br/>
HELP right there!  how come?&quot;.   i had to make him show me what the <br/>
heck he was talking about...  the little teeny, tiny word that i take <br/>
for granted that is in just about every window on the computer at the <br/>
top drop down menues?  he had learned it in bigger, colorful, fancier <br/>
text the way they usually make it in kid&#39;s software and i couldn&#39;t <br/>
believe he spotted it when it was out of the environment that he was <br/>
used to and KNEW it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  it&#39;s so much fun when they start noticing things like that!  <br/>
yesterday Sterling asked me why &quot;be&quot; was missing an &quot;e&quot; and informed <br/>
me that we needed to write to the people who made the book and tell <br/>
them there was a mistake in that book.  i had all i could do to keep <br/>
from laughing while i explained the difference.  <br/>
