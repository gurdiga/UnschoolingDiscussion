<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741672056">Sometimes people&#39;s unschooled kids end up in a class, writing their  <br/>
first report at the ripe age of 16 instead of buidling up to it with a  <br/>
dozen years of assigned book reports or &quot;reports&quot; on the rivers of  <br/>
France or the primary exports of Brazil, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Someone sent me a link to a &quot;Writing and homework site for home school  <br/>
Moms&quot; but that&#39;s not what it&#39;s really about.  As another resource for  <br/>
exploring the internet, it&#39;s got good potential:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shmoop.com/">http://www.shmoop.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
My first thought was how and whether teachers at high schools and  <br/>
universities will try to make it &quot;illegal&quot; or against the rules to use  <br/>
the site.   The site creates footnotes for reports.  So I wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
surprised if some professors look for that format and count off  <br/>
because the student didn&#39;t create the citation stroke-by-stroke by hand.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the edge of the world as we know it.   As surely as the fear of  <br/>
falling off the edge of the world, what happens when &quot;writing a  <br/>
report&quot; turns to internet research with advanced tools?   Will schools  <br/>
block internet access to this, or flag it?  It says it&#39;s about &quot;making  <br/>
the grade,&quot; and not about learning.  Learning looks easy and  <br/>
inevitable, though!<br/>
<br/>
And on history, I&#39;m going to look and see whether they&#39;re doing the  <br/>
Jr. High curriculum versions (glorify U.S. decisions and simplify  <br/>
motives), the high school version (admit when the U.S. screwed up, but  <br/>
then justify it all so the unit can end neatly on a Friday) or the  <br/>
college version.  Oh wait--undergrad history, or graduate school  <br/>
history? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very cool thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
