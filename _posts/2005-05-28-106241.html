<div id="ygrps-yiv-87468511">I found a quote in Time magazine just now.  A woman in France (no  relation <br/>
to Holly&#39;s being in France, but as connections go, I just made another  one <br/>
&lt;g&gt;)... A WOMAN IN FRANCE who&#39;s directing a program of education about  obesity <br/>
for children France was quoted in Newsweek, and what she said inspired  me to <br/>
go and polish up my &quot;YES&quot; pages a bit.  The first page links to the  <br/>
Joyce-on-&quot;Yes&quot; page, and a few other writers are on there too.<br/>
 <br/>
If anyone has stories to contribute to my quilt if &quot;YES&quot; words, send &#39;em  on! <br/>
(Or just write them here and I&#39;ll life some good bits.)<br/>

The woman in France said &quot;The trick is never to tell the children  no.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I loved this page! Pam&#39;s comments about the fact that there are kids<br/>
who seem spoiled by parents who always say yes made me think. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you figure that the difference between this kind of yes (the<br/>
mindful parenting kind) and the yes that is offered by parents of<br/>
spoiled (hate that word) children is that the first one is offered<br/>
freely. It is a part of a view of children that parents are partners<br/>
in creating a fulfilling, safe, rewarding life with and for their kids. <br/>
<br/>
The other kind of yes is often capitulation to a demanding child - a<br/>
child who is not feeling heard or attended to, whose  behavior is<br/>
increasingly disruptive and so the parent says &quot;yes&quot; to stop the<br/>
disruptive behavior, not to add joy to the child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
That child is perceived as spoiled when in reality, the &quot;spoiled&quot;<br/>
child may actually be needy and attention deprived. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508798703">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If anyone has stories to contribute to my quilt if &quot;YES&quot; words, send &#39;em<br/>
on! (Or just write them here and I&#39;ll life some good bits.)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Something that comes up a lot on A/U list is the concept of safety, or the<br/>
idea of saying &quot;no&quot; when something is unsafe. I wrote this fairly recently. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;One of the processes that I have noticed in our life, and also in the<br/>
postings of others, is that the definition of &quot;safe&quot; has definitely moved<br/>
towards the liberal. I find I have to re-examine every time what is safe.<br/>
There are times when people visiting our home get agitated because Jayn is<br/>
climbing on furniture in way that makes them concerned. I have to reassure<br/>
them that she is very balanced and confident. (Jayn&#39;s maternal grandfather<br/>
was a tightrope walker in a circus - I think she is showing signs of<br/>
inheriting his abilities - skipping a generation) <br/>
<br/>
There are ways that I change my response to &quot;unsafe&quot; mental alarm bells,<br/>
rather than making the default position &quot;Jayn must stop or change her<br/>
activities&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
I reorder the environment, putting pillows, moving breakables etc.<br/>
<br/>
I re-examine the environment and action, rather than acting on a knee jerk<br/>
reaction. The example that comes to mind is &quot;running around the pool&quot;. Our<br/>
pool surround is very old concrete, so pitted that it just does not become<br/>
slippery. In addition experience reminds me that Jayn is cautious and has<br/>
never fallen while running in the wet. When we visit another pool, I do a<br/>
check to test the slipperiness of the area, and share my findings with Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
I ask myself what I would be depriving Jayn of by making an arbitrary (or<br/>
my-comfort-based) decision on her behalf. It becomes risk assessment. How<br/>
much would she realistically be hurt by falling onto her butt, versus the<br/>
emotional hurt and stress on our relationship by me not trusting her or<br/>
diminishing her self-confidence.<br/>
<br/>
I show Jayn the safe way of accomplishing the action - like holding a plug<br/>
by the plastic and not touching the metal prongs.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I seems to me it is about saying &quot;yes&quot; through my actions, as well as my<br/>
words.<br/>

 <br/>
I remember one day vividly when Kirby was one.  Probably  16  or 17 months <br/>
old, and walking well.   We were at an  SCA tournament near Colorado Springs, <br/>
and he was little enough to be  picking other people&#39;s stuff up without asking <br/>
(he wasn&#39;t big enough to ask or  know &quot;other people&#39;s stuff&quot;).   He walked up <br/>
holding a steel and  leather gauntlet.  I asked him where he got it, but asked <br/>
him nicely in the  same kind of interested way I would&#39;ve if it was a cool <br/>
rock or a flower rather  than stolen armor. &lt;g&gt;  He very happily led me to the <br/>
place.  I  apologized to the guy (who hadn&#39;t yet noticed it missing) and asked <br/>
if maybe he  had anything that wasn&#39;t his.  There was something there, a roll <br/>
of duct  tape or something.  So I thanked him and picked that up and went to <br/>
the  next interesting pile of stuff and asked if it was theirs.  It was.   Did <br/>
they have something that wasn&#39;t theirs?  They did.<br/>
 <br/>
So Kirby had cross-pollinated a whole row of stuff in wandering among  people <br/>
who knew who he was and knew and his dad and I were within  eyesight.<br/>
 <br/>
Nobody told him he was a bad boy.  Everyone got their stuff  back.  He got to <br/>
look at and touch some cool things, and that was  fine.<br/>
 <br/>
At one point that afternoon he fell down and cried.  He had tripped on  a <br/>
string that was set up six or eight eight inches off the ground betwen stakes  <br/>
(sagging between stakes)  to show people how close was too close to put  tents <br/>
and piles of armor.  The adults were walking over it easily and had  seen those <br/>
little barriers before.  Kirby tripped and fell.  After I  made sure he was <br/>
okay and dusted him off, I took him back over and showed him  the string and <br/>
helped him practice stepping over it, and pointed out how the  string went all <br/>
the way around those places, and where the other people were  walking where <br/>
there wasn&#39;t string.  &quot;That&#39;s all,&quot; I remember telling  him.  It was only a <br/>
string.  Not danger, not malice, not his failure  to walk.   A guy from Santa Fe I <br/>
knew, thirtiesh, nice guy, was  watching us and listening.  He came over and <br/>
said with tears in his eyes  that I was a really good mom and he wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
thought to explain to someone  that age what had happened.  Then he told me <br/>
something he had never told me  or any of us in that group as far as I know.  He <br/>
had a daughter, somewhere,  14 years old.  He had gotten his girlfriend <br/>
pregnant when they were sixteen  or so, and the girl didn&#39;t want him to stick <br/>
around and be the father.  So  he said he always watched parents and thought about <br/>
what he would do, how he  might have been, as a father.  He had spent years <br/>
being ashamed and  sad.  <br/>
 <br/>
Years passed.  He married and has children (I haven&#39;t met them,  they&#39;re in <br/>
another state).  I feel good about that, and he&#39;s probably a  better dad than <br/>
he would&#39;ve been if he hadn&#39;t hung around with us for a few  years.  <br/>
 <br/>
And because of his story about having a daughter he didn&#39;t know and had  <br/>
never parented, I was able to calmly and truthfully tell my boys that one reason  <br/>
they need to be extremely careful about unintended pregancy is that if they <br/>
get  a girl pregnant, it&#39;s not their call whether she has the baby or not, and <br/>
it&#39;s  not their call whether they get to be the daddies or not.  They WOULD be <br/>
a  father, and regardless of their desires or intentions, they might end up <br/>
being  absent or bad fathers, because the baby was the mother&#39;s baby to decide  <br/>
about.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s another risk assessment situation.  Yes, teenagers sometimes have  sex, <br/>
but do it safely.<br/>
Yes, there are places more dangerous to walk than others, so do it  safely.  <br/>
Yes, you have something that doesn&#39;t belong to you, yes it&#39;s okay  to pick <br/>
things up, and yes, let&#39;s go take it back.  <br/>

He had  spent years <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My bio father just died, on May 15.  I met him (again) the year I  turned 30. <br/>
 I had no idea about him.  I had often dreamed as child (in  a very abusive <br/>
home) that there was this man who was always on his way to &quot;save&quot;  me from this <br/>
torment.  I thought all little girls had those dreams.  <br/>
 <br/>
My father knew all about me, everything.  My mom and her new husband  (from <br/>
when I was 3) told my dad for years that I knew all about him and hated  him, <br/>
they also told him I was adopted because he hadn&#39;t tried hard enough to  find <br/>
me when they married and moved away.  He believed them.<br/>
 <br/>
He lived with guilt for many many years.  His life was very much  filled with <br/>
the thoughts of the promise he whispered into a little girls ears so  many <br/>
years ago.<br/>
 <br/>
I had no spoken with in over five years.  His choice.  We never  really <br/>
developed much of a relationship other than some kind of unspoken,  unwavering <br/>
emotional bond.  That was enough.  The guilt I saw in his  eyes was painful.  He <br/>
only had words for me about sorry and wishes and  could haves and should haves. <br/>
 Despite my repeated insistence that all of  that was in the past and the <br/>
blame was neither his or mine to have.<br/>
 <br/>
He got a diagnoses, he was dying.  Cancer, stage four.  Best case  scenario, <br/>
1-3 years, worst case scenario, 6 months, most likely somewhere in  between.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s in MI, I&#39;m in VA.  Don&#39;t come he said.  He said other words  that said <br/>
&quot;come please&quot;.  So I went, the very next flight.  I thought  we had at least <br/>
weeks, possibly months to mend what someone else stole from us  so for so many <br/>
years.  <br/>
 <br/>
For the first two days I was there, if he spoke to me, he looked out the  <br/>
window.  My DH, he could look easily in the eye for conversation, but not  me.  I <br/>
dreaded this whole, I&#39;m so unworthy and so full of guilt thing we&#39;d  been <br/>
dancing around for years.<br/>
 <br/>
He rapidly declined in health.  Day one to day five, I could barely  believe <br/>
he was sick at all, except for the surgical scar he carried and the  doctors <br/>
own words, and my own eyes looking at the pathology reports.<br/>
 <br/>
This time this man was going to say YES to me, he would say what was in his  <br/>
heart and I would not be easily swayed by diverted eyes or his guilt filled  <br/>
conversations.<br/>
 <br/>
I lovingly cared for him.  I talked to doctors and interpreted for  him.  I <br/>
made sure things were done on schedule (he hates and so do I to not  know in <br/>
advance tests are to be done and procedures scheduled) as on schedule as  things <br/>
can be in a hospital.  He resisted.  I continued, I wasn&#39;t  hateful or mean, <br/>
but I was firm in that this man would have no doubt that I  loved him, in <br/>
spite of how horrible he felt he had been as a father to me.<br/>
 <br/>
Day three we talked eye to eye. Finally, he just said he was so damn mad  <br/>
about all of this and had been his whole life.  He wanted to know why I  wasn&#39;t <br/>
mad and why I didn&#39;t hate him.  Why?  Why be mad, life is what  it is, we <br/>
change it or we don&#39;t.  Make it what we want it to be TODAY and  stop worrying and <br/>
feeling guilty about what we did or didn&#39;t do yesterday or  last week or last <br/>
year or ten years ago.<br/>
 <br/>
TODAY you can make your child&#39;s life better, but worrying about what it  will <br/>
be tomorrow or what it was last week won&#39;t help it at all.  Sometimes  it <br/>
helps to be stubborn and to know exactly where you want to go.  I wanted  my dad <br/>
to feel the love I have for him and to know beyond a doubt that he should  not <br/>
and could not carry that guilt with him, that it wasn&#39;t his to carry.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just like as parents we cannot be bogged down because we sent our child to  <br/>
school for one day or ten thousand days.  We need to be determined that  TODAY <br/>
counts, it&#39;s important and we CAN make it matter.  We have to drop  the guilt <br/>
and find the joy in just BEING with that child.  Life happens,  learning <br/>
happens, joy happens, children do grow up, parents do die, sometimes  much sooner <br/>
than anyone thinks.<br/>
 <br/>
My day was barely 61.  Within eight days he went from a guilt ridden  man <br/>
with no joy in his life to a man who died peacefully and knowing he was  loved <br/>
and forgiven by himself.<br/>
 <br/>
Let it go, forget about what happened yesterday or last year,  TODAY  can be <br/>
more joyful.<br/>
 <br/>
I had only a few days of pure joy with my dad, but you can bet I won&#39;t ever  <br/>
forget them and those days are worth more to me than a thousand days filled <br/>
with  guilt and not moving forward.<br/>

I don&#39;t know who wrote this because it wasn&#39;t signed, but Wow- what a <br/>
beautiful, powerful story.  I&#39;d love to shorten the last sentence into something for <br/>
a T-shirt, or bumper sticker.  &quot;Days matter, hours matter, children remember.&quot; <br/>
 I&#39;d put it next to my other favorite family saying, &quot;School schmool!!&quot;<br/>
