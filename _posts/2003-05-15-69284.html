<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945938695">**&gt; PS  I read a James Patterson mystery novel (title lost to me) in which<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there were hippie, Santa Cruz mountains, unschoolers who were incestous<br/>
&gt; thrill killers. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read that book too.. GOSH, I can&#39;t remember the name of it either.. ..<br/>
Was <br/>
it the one about the brothers and the tigers?  **<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the one.  Some of his other books have been good, for their<br/>
genre, but I thought this one was lousy, not just because of the killer unschoolers.<br/>

a way that never came together to make any sense.   <br/>
