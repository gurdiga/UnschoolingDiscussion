<div id="ygrps-yiv-229915049">Trevor says that X-box is slower at loading games than Game Cube and the <br/>
graphics on a lot of the games are darker, and therefore harder to see.<br/>
The controllers are large and awkward on X-Box too....<br/>
he thinks GAme Cube is better obviously. He also likes PS2 though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026176239">I think I may have been the one who asked about this months ago.   This is what we decided--<br/>
<br/>
We got the PS2,  also for various reasons:  lots of games, dvd player,  great graphics.     It has been used and enjoyed greatly.   I think the only thing that we miss in having it is the Nintendo games,  Mario and I want to play Zelda.   Have to have a Gamecube for that,  I think that&#39;s the one.<br/>
<br/>
In the last few weeks we&#39;ve been able to play with the Gamecube,  my son traded a pokemon game for the use of one for a month.  The graphics look pretty similar to PS2,  but again I think the difference was that there aren&#39;t as many games.<br/>
<br/>
I havn&#39;t gotten the Zelda game yet,  I might go rent it and try it, while we have this Gamecube.   Then I&#39;ll decide if we are going to get a Gamecube too.   Or if its worth it.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to mention too,  (which is what I&#39;ve been doing when looking at another game system) check out pawnshops with this stuff,   my son just got a new Final Fantasy 10 game, for $25.00.   In the store it would have been $50.00.    It was missing its instructions and it had a tiny scratch on it.   To remedy the missing instructions he&#39;s been researching the game on the internet,  the scratch hasn&#39;t been a problem(we have 10 days to return it if it is a problem).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll also ask my son more about this when he gets up!<br/>

  Ok, Alec (ds,10) got up,  here&#39;s what he says:<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;If you like Mario games and Zelda games, I&#39;d recommend the gamecube.  <br/>
<br/>
  The X-box is alot like PS2, but X-box has better graphics.   The X-box doesn&#39;t have as many games though.  They both do dvds and cds. &quot;<br/>
