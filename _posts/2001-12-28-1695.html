<div id="ygrps-yiv-442502373">Alright, now you&#39;ve got me going with poop memories.....<br/>
Like the time we were in downtown Portland and 3y.o. ds had to poo RIGHT NOW <br/>
and there wasn&#39;t a business open nearby or a bathroom in sight.<br/>
He ended up squatting over a paper sack right there on the sidewalk....such <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
Or the time my baby brother was pestering me with these teeny little plastic <br/>
balls by rolling them under my feet while I was doing dishes. I warned him <br/>
that I would eat it if he didn&#39;t stop, which he didn&#39;t of course. I faked <br/>
eating it and he came unglued, screaming and crying for it back. I said there <br/>
was only one way to get it back and if he would wait a sec, I really had to <br/>
go poop. I scooped up a smidgin of lentils (left from dinner) on my way back <br/>
to the bathroom and while in there, squashed them all over the little ball. <br/>
You should have seen the horror on his face when I tried to hand it to him!! <br/>
Not as good as the totall meltdown he had when I licked it off though.<br/>
He never touched that particular ball again.<br/>
Ok, now you know I do indeed have a sick side to my humor. Buy hey, I was <br/>
only 13 (and probably a lot funnier than I am now).<br/>
Poop can be funny....you&#39;re right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340641996">I told you 13 is awfull!!!   Ha, that WAS really<br/>
funny.  I do remember trying to conceal that I (as the<br/>
parent) actually thought the mean sruff  the kids<br/>
thought of wasn&#39;t actually funny.  Sometimes mean<br/>
really is hysterical. As long as you are not the<br/>
but(t)  of the joke.<br/>
