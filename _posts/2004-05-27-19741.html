<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196973168">&quot;Our society is not getting more and more immune to violence.  We actually<br/>
live in a world that is safer than it has ever been throughout history.  You<br/>
might want to check your facts on that one.  Think Crusades, think 1700&#39;s<br/>
America, think biblical times.  We are much safer than we would have been<br/>
then.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. <br/>
There are times and places in history, when people could NOT imagine living in a city without walls for protection. They would have been totally AMAZED at the level of peace and prosperity we enjoy today. think feudal England for example, and read Ken Follets &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; for a good lesson in history and violence of the time.<br/>

 &quot;There is no way to <br/>
peace.  Peace is the way.&quot; <br/>
