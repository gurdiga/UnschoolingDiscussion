<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749551483">Hi Sheree,<br/>
  Sorry to be so long in reply, however, I missed this post. We have a<br/>
store that works us to death! It is a lot of work but it is also a<br/>
blessing, allowing me to be with my kids 24/7. Some people don&#39;t like to<br/>
be with theirs this much, glad I&#39;m not one of them! Friends and<br/>
neighbors (i.e. customers) can see that the kids are not being &quot;ruined&quot;<br/>
by homeschool, most are just impressed!<br/>
