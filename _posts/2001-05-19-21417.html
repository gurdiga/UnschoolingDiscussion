turning around and damning it in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t help to blame observers for pointing out quotable and documentable <br/>
truths.  There are MANY fundamentalist Christian writings which condemn <br/>
anything except authoritarian discipline, and condemn any homeschooling which <br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;Christ centered&quot; and parent-directed.  No non-Christian could have or <br/>
would have made that up, and if things are mentioned which are true, why <br/>
revile the reporter?<br/>
<br/>
There are sites and magazines and books that advocate some pretty oppressive <br/>
childrearing tactics.  I know of not one of them which is not Christian <br/>
oriented.<br/>
