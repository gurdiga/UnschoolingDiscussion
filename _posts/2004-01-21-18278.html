  &gt; &gt;Casual sex, as in having sex one night with one man, the next with<br/>
  &gt; &gt;another, and then another? I&#39;m sorry, but I just find that wrong.I<br/>
  &gt; &gt;want my daughters to enjoy sex, not become sluts. And I don&#39;t think<br/>
  &gt; &gt;that people who are married should be having sex with someone other<br/>
  &gt; &gt;than their marraige partner.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;I am assuming here that I just did not explain what I meant by casual<br/>
  &gt; &gt;sex.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I had a fair bit of casual sex in my life. Am I a slut?<br/>
  &gt; I much prefer the commited relationship I&#39;m in now, but I&#39;m not sure I<br/>
  &gt; would have known that if someone had been able to prevent my having<br/>
casual<br/>
  &gt; sex to compare it to.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;I wear my panties and Bra. And they see people in bikinis at the<br/>
  &gt; &gt;beach, that is enough in my opinion. And (I am only assuming here) It<br/>
  &gt; &gt;would be rather difficult for a man to potty train a boy, if the boy<br/>
  &gt; &gt;didn&#39;t see him naked. And girls are shown to sit on toilets when they<br/>
  &gt; &gt;go. I used to shower/bathe with them when they were babies.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Our children decided for themselves when they were uncomfortable with<br/>
  &gt; nakedness. The age that happened ran from about 4 to 7, depending on the<br/>
  &gt; kid. When they&#39;re uncomfortable with being seen naked, it&#39;s usually the<br/>
  &gt; time they no longer want to see their parents naked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457963183">My oldest is 11, fully formed, and still naked...but<br/>
we&#39;ll see in the teen years.  My dad, bless his little<br/>
70 yo hiney, &quot;conservatively&quot; puts on his thong bikini<br/>
underpants when he&#39;s at my house....I think mine will<br/>
be naked forever :)<br/>
