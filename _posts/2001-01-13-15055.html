<div id="ygrps-yiv-765707778">&lt;&lt;  I can&#39;t emphasize enough how vital to unschooling I consider free<br/>
choice to be.  To me it is much more important than how it looks on the<br/>
outside or what kind of classes they take.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have questions about this.  It seems a major goal of the unschooling<br/>
household is for the parents to follow their own interests and allow the<br/>
children to follow theirs.  I do introduce my kids to various things<br/>
through books, field trips, etc.  But how can you tell when a child wants<br/>
to do something in more depth, such as take a class or get more training<br/>
in it.  Will they always tell you?<br/>
