the kids, specifically the little things.  When you go to the grocery store <br/>
do you just say yes to everything the kids ask for?  I imagine that the <br/>
majority of folks on this list are on some kind of budget and have to make <br/>

<br/>
How does unschooling tie in with a family budget?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I actually don&#39;t find this a problem. Grocery shopping with the kids <br/>
usually has me buying more than I went for, but it all gets eaten. There are <br/>
plenty of times when I ask them if they want something and they say no. I <br/>
really don&#39;t have a problem with them asking for things we can&#39;t afford. <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s because of all the years of us having no restrictions on them, <br/>
them having their own money to buy what they want with it. We talk about <br/>
money and what it takes to run a household. Not to the point where they need <br/>
to worry, but enough where they understand what it takes and where money <br/>
goes. Some kids just don&#39;t get that you have to pay to live in a house and <br/>
have lights and all!!! Maybe because of all this, they don&#39;t ask for things <br/>
not possible for us. And I do believe the way they were brought up makes a <br/>
difference too. As much as I have thought that what they asked for in the <br/>
past would not be as great as they thought, we would get it anyway. Then <br/>
they would find out for themselves about good choices. After one or two <br/>
disappointing choices, they would think more about it next time. And that <br/>
goes with my 17 year old too. She has had a car sitting in the driveway for <br/>
the past 4 months that she hasn&#39;t been able to drive. We are all working on <br/>
getting it worthy of being on the road. She hasn&#39;t said a word. We all just <br/>
keep saving for that day!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When there are controls on food and then you let go of the controls, the<br/>
kids will want lots of things. It&#39;s like being let loose in a candy store<br/>
with $1000 ;-) But once they realize they can have anything they want, they<br/>
don&#39;t want just for the sake of being able to have it. They just ask for<br/>
what they want.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to make sure they&#39;re well fed before you go grocery shopping. Which<br/>
is good advice for adults too! :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If the money is really really tight, what about a budget for them too? Let<br/>
them each have x amount to spend. And rather than make it arbitrary, if<br/>
they&#39;re interested perhaps some would like to help set up the household<br/>
budget so they can see where all the money goes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We used to do allowance, but we found that the boys (8 and 5) would spend <br/>
money on anything and not have the money for things they really wanted.  So <br/>
we changed. <br/>
<br/>
 What works for us now is that we sit down as a family and do the bills.  <br/>
Sometimes the boys are interested in this part and sometimes not and they get <br/>
to use the calculator.  We then talk about other bills that we need to set <br/>
money aside for and vacations that we already have in the mix.  We figure out <br/>
about how much money we will need and how much we can put into savings for <br/>
that (like the live and learn conference).  Then when all is said and done we <br/>
talk about things we want to do and buy.  Like a trip to the zoo or another <br/>
gaming piece that Dallen wants or a computer game Phillip wants, also house <br/>
things like building a deck etc. Figure out about how much money we have for <br/>
these things and if it will be doable to get the computer game this pay day <br/>
or wait until next.  Or set aside a little money for the deck but not start <br/>
it this month.  It has worked great for us and I think the boys understand <br/>
better about budget and they buy things they really want and have put some <br/>
thought into.<br/>

<br/>
Sigh, I wish I&#39;d known more of these ideas before the kids were born.  I<br/>
feel like I&#39;m starting all over again!  It reminds me of how I decided to<br/>
breastfed my first child &quot;for the nutrition&quot; and over time it led to a<br/>
lifestyle and relationship that is about so much more than food.  I realize<br/>
that up to this point, I&#39;ve been focusing on unschooling as a method of<br/>
education.  I&#39;ve never been an overly controlling parent, but I realize that<br/>
I have been more controlling than I really thought I was.  It&#39;s also<br/>
complicated by dh having only me telling him new ideas, while I have all of<br/>
you for ideas, examples, and support.  I find time to read the books, but he<br/>
doesn&#39;t.  He is changing too, but still believes that children do need<br/>
parents to tell them how much candy to eat, or things like that.<br/>
<br/>
My kids usually do shop with me, so they have long seen and heard and even<br/>
helped with the decision making that goes into choosing what to buy.  At the<br/>
store last weekend, they asked for all kinds of just those things that, up<br/>
until recently, have been limited in some way.  They also ate lots of that<br/>
stuff over the next couple of days.  Then I told them that I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
buying more Popsicles that week, so they needed to decide if they were going<br/>
to eat them all right away or make them last until the next shopping trip.<br/>
That was so dumb of me.  I would never say that about cheese or bread or<br/>
apples.  I sure do have a long way to go...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our kids each have their own money from the family budget, and if <br/>
they want something they can buy it with their own money. My son is <br/>
pretty good about saving up for things that he wants. If he wants <br/>
something bigger, we have a discussion about whether or not we can <br/>
chip in more money towards the bigger item (depending on how much we <br/>
have at the time). Since DH owns his own business, and the amount of <br/>
money we get in each month is variable (sometimes by a little, <br/>
sometimes by a lot - the weeks after 9/11 when general aviation shut <br/>
down, for instance, we had *no* income because we depend on <br/>
aviation). So the answer to any question about whether something can <br/>
be bought, or whether we can go on a trip, or whatever may be <br/>
different at different times. We&#39;ve tried to explain this to the kids <br/>
and also go over our household expenses so that they know what our <br/>
money goes toward.<br/>
<br/>
My son has also been really great about thinking up ways he can earn <br/>
his own money. Last year he grew plants from seeds and from cuttings <br/>
and propagation from our garden. Then a few times during the summer, <br/>
he went to a friend&#39;s garage sale and set up his own plant sale. He <br/>
made his own signs, and hawked his wares like a trooper, going out <br/>
into the groups of people and saying things like &quot;You look like you <br/>
could use a plant!&quot; or &quot;Did you know if you buy one of my perennials, <br/>
you&#39;ll have flowers every year!&quot; Who could resist? I think his total <br/>
for the summer was $48, not bad for a (then) 5 year old. This year he <br/>
has bigger plans. He wants to sell some of the compost worms, and he <br/>
wants to start more plants from seeds. I told him I&#39;d front him the <br/>
money for seeds and help him keep the books so he can see how much he <br/>
makes in profit, and how much his expenses were. Last year he kept <br/>
track of which plants sold more than others, and as he did subsequent <br/>
sales, he concentrated more on growing the better-selling plants. I <br/>
have to admit, I&#39;m pretty impressed with his natural business acumen!<br/>
<br/>
One book that a friend let me borrow was &quot;Rich Kid, Smart Kid&quot; by <br/>
Robert Kiyosaki. While it&#39;s not an unschooling book, there&#39;s some <br/>
good info in there in helping kids learn about money in real life <br/>
ways that will benefit them in the future. I like Rich Dad&#39;s approach <br/>
to many things (though it&#39;s definitely a &quot;take what works&quot; type of <br/>
book. The author spends a whole lot of time telling us what&#39;s wrong <br/>
with the way schools teach kids, and how therefore it&#39;s up to us to <br/>
help them outside of school. It always amazes me that even very smart <br/>
people don&#39;t see that the school component of that equation is simply <br/>
unnecessary! But I digress... he&#39;s very big on kids learning in real <br/>
life ways, and that helped me think about ways in which I could help <br/>
my kids pursue their own ventures.<br/>

Would he be interested in learning about seed saving (for non hybridized<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll let them pick something.  And if they request something else that would <br/>
be good for everybody, I&#39;ll consider it over one of my own ideas, because I <br/>
get bored and boring with food.<br/>
<br/>
Because we&#39;ve let them pick food since they were little, more often than not <br/>
they don&#39;t want anything.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I needed dill seed for some bread, and a bag of sugar.  Most of our <br/>
food comes from CostCo lately, but I hate giant bags of sugar, so we were <br/>
going to the nearest little grocery store.  Holly wanted to go to see if they <br/>
had Bagel Bites, some frozen little pizza-like-things.  They did, but they <br/>
didn&#39;t have the pepperoni and cheese kind she likes.  I asked if she wanted <br/>
anything else.  No.  Fruit or vegetables?  Corn on the cob?   No.<br/>
<br/>
So we left with sugar and dill seed.<br/>

<br/>
Because we&#39;ve let them pick whatever since they were little, more often <br/>
than not they are willing to accept it on those occasions when we truly <br/>
can&#39;t let them pick.<br/>
