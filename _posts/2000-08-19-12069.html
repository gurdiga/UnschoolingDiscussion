<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893573324"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Pagan is a blanket term, for many different religions, or spiritual paths.  .....There are many sites on the internet, but you will find soo many different takes on Pagan, there are so many Earth Centered ways of practicing your religion, so I would start just by asking your friend what it is he personally believes.  Michelle*<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I believe the original poster said that their friend was Wiccan, which is one particular belief and worship system (although details can vary about specifics of worship, like many Christian denominations.)  However, the basics of Wiccan worship are similar enough for the posters intended purposes of understanding what it is their friend believes.  Details, like whether they associate the Northern cardinal point with the color brown to represent it&#39;s earth element, or green, (one debated point) hardly matters.<br/>
<br/>
Wiccans are, in fact, the largest and fastest growing pagan group worldwide (if you do not count the majority of the world who practice Buddhist beliefs as being pagan by virtue of their non judeo-christian nature.)  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Many Buddhists would be considered Pagan as well. The belief that gods<br/>
are beings of another level of incarnation (gods realm), and the fact<br/>
that some Buddhists still embrace cultural gods and goddesses would put<br/>
them in the Pagan camp.<br/>
Some Buddhists are philosophic Buddhists. Buddhism in the strictest<br/>
sense is a philosophy of the way the universe is (works), and will<br/>
always be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s no conflict between Buddhism being the largest Pagan denomination and<br/>
Wicca being the fastest growing.  It&#39;s even likely; it&#39;s easier to grow fast<br/>
(percentagewise) when you&#39;re small.  (Although Buddhism probably adds more<br/>
people a year due to population growth, where it helps to be large.)<br/>
<br/>
However, a bit of math thought, the sort of which I hope y&#39;all are encouraging<br/>
in your children, suggests that Buddhism could not possibly be the majority<br/>
religion.  There are 6 billion people, so a majority religion would have to<br/>
have over 3 billion.  If we to begin with allocate a billion people to<br/>
Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism then we&#39;ve already used up 4<br/>
billion without touching African animism or Chinese Confucianism.<br/>
