<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838826070"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wow, raising blackberries. That seems so strange coming from where we <br/>
 </span></blockquote>live.<br/>
The entire field behind our house is full of them, as is every roadside,<br/>
abandoned garden shed, or anyplace that someone hasn&#39;t actively planted<br/>
something else or mowed them down. They may be nuisances (I have to cut them<br/>
out of my garden a thousand times a year) but ummmmm.... are they great!<br/>
As for the finest blackberries on earth, they grow in Jacksonville, OR.<br/>
which must have the perfect climate for them. Bigger than a big thumb and<br/>
juicy and sweet. Yumm! That&#39;s where I grew up, and I can&#39;t eat a blackberry<br/>
without thinking of home...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Oregon must be a wonderful place. I have heard that strawberries grow  wild <br/>
in the ditches. IAre the blackberries where you live thornless? If not then <br/>
they sure are mean to pick aren&#39;t they. I am jealous of places where such <br/>
great food grows wild. <br/>
<br/>
Oldest daughter, 17 is interested in raising berries, she has been sitting <br/>
with garden catalogs and books all week. She planted two plants a few yrs ago <br/>
and they produce a lot. She also is interested in being a personal trainer, <br/>
she just finished Covert Bailey&#39;s new book and was telling me all about it <br/>
and what we are doing wrong in our daily exercise. Seems like she is always <br/>
busy doing something. Just thought those of you with younger children might <br/>
be interested in what an &quot;old&quot; kid does with her time. My other three are <br/>
just as involved but in different areas. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling when children are young is fun and when they get older it is <br/>
still fun, just  in a different way. So many people use to tell me that we <br/>
would be living in ****  when our kids became teens. You know they could not <br/>
have been more wrong. <br/>

I&#39;ve been told by a couple of sources, one was a guide at the Interpretive <br/>
Center, that black berries and English Ivy were both brought here by <br/>
settlers.  They also stated that they are a danger to the native vegetation.  <br/>
Around here they have to cut the ivy at the base of the trees every year to <br/>
keep it from killing them.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I&#39;ve noticed that some of the blackberry bushes never produce <br/>
sweet berries.  They are sour no matter what time of year it is.  Then there <br/>
are bushes that DO produce sweet ones, perhaps there&#39;s a difference in soil <br/>
or sun exposure.  We&#39;ve begun to scope out the good bushes around here.  My <br/>
dd wants to make jam, I told her if she can pick enough of them we will.  <br/>
Those thorns can make picking a challenge.<br/>

Hi Kris...Glad you&#39;re back and doing well.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something to try with blackberries: get heavy duty latex gloves with<br/>
long cuffs. The kind for handling semi-caustic material (industrial<br/>
strength). Then snip the fingertips off. This protects the hands and wrists<br/>
from the thorns but allows you to feel for the berries with your fingers.<br/>

summer.</div>

GREAT idea!  My dd will love this one.  This will be a good chance to make <br/>
some naturally organic jam, best part about them growing wild.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549720066">There is an English variety but there are also varieties that are native.<br/>
Supposedly the one native to the Pacific Northwest and Northern California<br/>
is an endangered plant.  We have them here but you have to know what to look<br/>
for.  We have about five or six other varieties that have gone wild, so you<br/>
can make tons of jam without the cost of buying berries.<br/>

to do some science (she had been watching TLC or something).  After she<br/>
trashed the family room (ALL the books out and open all over the floor &lt;g&gt;),<br/>
she asked if gardening could be science even if you don&#39;t have to measure<br/>
anything.  Well we discussed doing charts and stuff if she wanted to do<br/>
&quot;scientific methods.&quot;  She bought the plants, carefully nutured them (she<br/>
now HATES snails and slugs &lt;g&gt;) and then picked them.  She got two large<br/>
ziplock bags of them and then made jam (she called that chemistry).  And it<br/>
is sooooo good!<br/>
