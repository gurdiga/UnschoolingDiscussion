 i guess the difference in my personal understanding of unschooling and the <br/>
one<br/>
 you&#39;ve put forth is that in my mind unschooling lies squarely in ones <br/>
attitude<br/>
 and is not dogmatic in any real way but flows and utilizes everything.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK.  I respect that that&#39;s how you want to think about it and it sounds <br/>
terrific to me.  <br/>
<br/>
The only thing I would add is that some days my &quot;attitude&quot; is better than <br/>
others -- sometimes I am a very relaxed hser, some days not so relaxed, some <br/>
days it all works together, some days not.  <br/>
<br/>
Cook or text books -- they are all books to me -- I agree.  But, no matter <br/>
how _I_ do it, if I want to call it unschooling (and sometimes I do not <br/>
because I think it just confuses some people when they really only want to <br/>
have a pretty surface-y conversation anyway -- like, how&#39;s the hsing going?  <br/>
great.  OK, see you.) on any given day, then I feel free to.  I don&#39;t feel I <br/>
have to eschew text or cook books or fit anyone else&#39;s definition in order to <br/>
&quot;qualify.&quot;  But that&#39;s me.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people question a lot of things that I don&#39;t.  Whether &quot;subjects&quot; should <br/>
be taught at all, whether &quot;classes&quot; should be taken, what approach those <br/>
classes should take, what books are informative and what are too textbook-y, <br/>
etc.  My day-to-day answer to these and other questions is to do what works.  <br/>
There is not a big philosophical overlay.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, some people say they have been damaged by their school <br/>
experience.  Personally, I don&#39;t feel that way.  But I can see how it can <br/>
happen.  But that&#39;s not where I am starting from and so I don&#39;t have some of <br/>
the negative reactions to school-y stuff that some people have.  They are <br/>
right for them and, I think, we are doing right for us.  <br/>
<br/>
Many, many, many shades of grey (or is it gray? :) ) and they are all OK with <br/>
me.  And I think if you want to call yourself an unschooler and you are any <br/>
of those shades, good for you, call yourself whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s something that is too individual to actually define for everyone.  <br/>
Maybe we can only define it for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
