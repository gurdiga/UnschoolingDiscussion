we did growing up. I do have a couple of questions, my oldest(Jaiden <br/>
4yrs) thinks that it is the funniest thing in the world to hurt his <br/>
younger brother (Avery 1yr). example: This morning I found him <br/>
sitting on Avery and shoving a plastic screwdriver into his mouth. <br/>
This is a comman accurance, and I&#39;m at a loss, my mother say&#39;s to <br/>
spank him and make him throw away whatever it is that he used to hurt <br/>
Avery with and then make him spend the day sitting on his bed, she <br/>
says that this is what she did to keep me from hurting my younger <br/>
brother and that after about 3 times it worked. This seems totally <br/>
harsh to me but talking to Jaiden dosen&#39;t seem to work, he tells me <br/>
that it&#39;s funny to make Avery scream and if I try talking to him more <br/>
about it, tell him that Avery does&#39;t think it&#39;s funny... Jaiden tells <br/>
me that I talk to much and he flops down and pretends to go to sleep <br/>
(snors and all)I just don&#39;t know what to do, I&#39;m sure that a lot of <br/>
it is his age and ajusting to a VERY hectic year, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
that it makes it okay for him to hurt his brother, am I wrong? The <br/>
other question I had was, how do you balance out their (the kids) <br/>
wants over your needs? example: It&#39;s 6:00am and I&#39;ve been up all <br/>
night with Avery (cutting in two molars) I&#39;ve finally managed to get <br/>
him and me asleep and in comes Jaiden demanding that I get up and <br/>
make him mac&cheese, the left overs in the fridge are toooooo cold. I <br/>
tell him that I can make it in a little bit after Avery and I get <br/>
some sleep. He then preceads to make as much noise as possable so <br/>
that Avery wakes up. So, I needed to sleep but wasn&#39;t able to and he <br/>
got the mac&cheese that he wanted. I keep thinking that there has to <br/>
be a better way to do this but I can&#39;t figure it out.<br/>
TIA Rebecca<br/>
<br/>
P.S. re-reading this kinda makes Jaiden sound bad, and he&#39;s not he&#39;s <br/>
a wonderful, energetic little boy that keeps me on my toes.  I just <br/>
am not sure how to deal with him.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283959235">Welcome Rebecca, it seems that you are in a tough situation.  Although I am a complete<br/>
Unschooler, I do not think it is ok to hurt another person for pleasure.  There has to be some<br/>
anger that Jaiden is holding in about the youngest.  Maybe he is jealous about the little one<br/>
coming along and taking away his time?  Do you spend alone time with Jaiden at all or are<br/>
you always with the little one?  Maybe he just needs some more alone time with you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, please remember that part of unschooling is unschooling ourselves too.  You have to<br/>
take care of your needs first or you won&#39;t be around to take care of theirs.  I would have<br/>
stayed in bed through all the noise and tantrum and then not made him mac and cheese<br/>
because he didn&#39;t respect your time enough to let you get some sleep.  Maybe next time<br/>
he will get the picture that you are a person with needs also.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe the way you&#39;re saying it is a problem.  Use whole different ways.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t let them be in the same room together alone EVER if one was actual <br/>
a danger to the other.  Keep one with you all the time.  They&#39;ll both get <br/>
older every minute, every day, and it&#39;s not a lifelong problem.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think <br/>
that it makes it okay for him to hurt his brother, am I wrong? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not okay for you as a mother to allow your child to be hurt by another <br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
But that includes the older kid, and you, too.  <br/>
<br/>
So hurting one to protect the other doesn&#39;t seem the right answer.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve finally managed to get <br/>
him and me asleep and in comes Jaiden demanding that I get up and <br/>
make him mac&cheese, the left overs in the fridge are toooooo cold. I <br/>
tell him that I can make it in a little bit after Avery and I get <br/>

<br/>
You needed a babysitter today!<br/>
<br/>
Is there an older neighbor kid who can come and play with Jaiden after shool <br/>
(or even better, a homeschooler)?   I used to pay $3 an hour for a 12 year <br/>
old homeschooled girl to come over sometimes when Marty was three and Kirby <br/>
was five.  Because I was there and her mom was four houses or so up the <br/>
street, it wasn&#39;t quit like full-on babysitting.  It gave me a chance to <br/>
nurse Holly, or take a nap, or take a shower...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740592743">I don&#39;t think your moms idea will help your older boy have more love for<br/>
his baby brother, or less frustration.   I think it&#39;s a bad idea.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think it would be a good idea to ignore Jaidens needs either, or<br/>
punish him, he&#39;ll only get more resentful.<br/>
  <br/>
It seems like he needs more time from you and more attention.  One sure<br/>
way to get you to come running is to make that baby scream.  He had you<br/>
all to himself for a long time and now he has to wait until the baby is<br/>
taken care of.  Four is very little.  You can&#39;t expect him to handle it<br/>
like a big person would.  Some big people don&#39;t handle new babies well.  <br/>
  <br/>
But you can&#39;t let him hurt his little brother either.   Don&#39;t leave them<br/>
alone together, and spend time with Jaiden.  Tell him how nice it is to<br/>
have a big boy.  Tell him that baby wont be a baby forever, that he&#39;ll<br/>
get bigger and won&#39;t need you so much.  Maybe if you talk about when he<br/>
was a baby, how you held him and rocked him and such.  Let him look at<br/>
pictures of his small self.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005949779">&lt;&lt; So my H and I never wanted<br/>
to spank the two girls we have (now 6 & 5), but we<br/>
discovered that if you don&#39;t punish, they will not<br/>
learn.  Talking doesn&#39;t work.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WHOA!<br/>
<br/>
This goes against my own experiences.  My three WERE six and five and all <br/>
ages before, but are now 16, 13, and 10, and if the talking you&#39;re doing <br/>
doesn&#39;t work you need to find some new talking, because punishments are NOT <br/>
the best ideas people have ever had.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t settle for an inferior way of raising your kids when you&#39;re surrounded <br/>
by people who have life experience in moving away from interactions that harm <br/>
your children AND their relationship with you AND fail to make you a better <br/>
person.<br/>
<br/>
What we do affects US, our own being, our own spiritual and psychological <br/>
selves.  <br/>
<br/>
If we can&#39;t be wiser than a six year old and figure out how to communicate <br/>
with them lovingly and compassionately, something is wrong which can easily <br/>
be amended.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Just be sure that<br/>
whatever you do for punishment/discipline, you&#39;re not<br/>
angry when you do it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that&#39;s what my mom said when she spanked kids.  This is for your own <br/>
good.<br/>
She would wait the amount of time it took for us to get the implement, and <br/>
she would tell us how many times she was going to hit us in advance, and then <br/>
say it was clinical and she had calmed down, so she wasn&#39;t angry any more.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY excuse I can think of to hit a child is anger.  And then the parent <br/>
better be pretty damned sorry for not having better self control than to hit <br/>
a child.<br/>
<br/>
Once you&#39;re not angry WHY would you hit a child?<br/>
<br/>
If you hit an adult, you go to jail.<br/>
Why is hitting a child okay?<br/>
<br/>
It is not.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was wrong, and lazy, and ill advised.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh wow. I have a 5 yo and would not say that he does not<br/>
understand the words or the concepts. He may not have the<br/>
control of his feelings to always make the right choices, <br/>
but he is getting there. *Because* we talk. Talking takes<br/>
longer, but I feel that on the whole it will be longer <br/>
lasting. How are they supposed to understand the words<br/>
and concepts if you don&#39;t talk to them about it. But I am<br/>
sure that you *do* talk about it, so why hit too? <br/>
<br/>
When Jason was 4, I read an article about the percentage of<br/>
parents who spank (it was well above 50%). I was honestly <br/>
surprised because I did not expect it to be so high. I made<br/>
some sort of exclamation which caused Jason to be curious<br/>
about what I was reading. I explained that I was surprised that<br/>
it seemed like a lot of parents used spanking. He asked what<br/>
spanking was and I explained that if he had done something really<br/>
wrong I would hit him on the bottom. I asked what he thought of<br/>
that...he said, well if you hit me then I would go hit Kyle <br/>
(his younger brother). Blew me away that he would make that <br/>
connection. Makes sense though.<br/>
<br/>
My mom hit me with a wooden spoon. Not often and yes I really<br/>
did do something wrong &quot;to deserve&quot; it. I had a wonderful<br/>
childhood and do not think that I was &quot;abused&quot;. I understand<br/>
why she did it. BUT I do not think that it was necessary. Am I <br/>
better because of it? I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids to behave because they are afraid of being hurt.<br/>
Or being punished. I want them to behave because they understand that<br/>
it is the right thing to do. And they can only learn why it is the <br/>
right thing to do if they make mistakes and we talk about it. Which is<br/>
why I come here to get new ideas of how to help learn.<br/>
