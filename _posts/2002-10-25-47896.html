<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909595868">Michelle,<br/>
I am a wealth of information about the IDEA program, I&#39;m from Alaska.<br/>
My sister just disenrolled from it and I think you will find it very <br/>
difficult to unschool and use their program.<br/>
Please email me offline and I&#39;ll put you in touch with her.<br/>
She went with a different program this year that was less invasive, but she <br/>
is going independant next year and with great conviction about it.<br/>
Get some more information before you sign on....it&#39;s not what you think.<br/>
Some things aren&#39;t worth the money.<br/>
