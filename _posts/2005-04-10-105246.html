<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224673558">My feelings will not be hurt if people don&#39;t read this.  It has an  <br/>
interesting part (applying for the next job) and after that is just  mom-angst/droning, <br/>
maybe.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Tonight is Kirby&#39;s last night working at Active Imagination.  He  started <br/>
there at the beginning of August 2000, when he had just turned 14.   He&#39;s 18 and <br/>
a half and some now.<br/>
<br/>
The last Saturday of March, he failed to  lock the back door.  (3/26)<br/>
 <br/>
It was discovered by the woman who opened at 11:30 a.m. on Sunday and she  <br/>
called Kirby.  He went in to help make sure nothing was missing, and it was  all <br/>
fine, except that he had violated security and it was his second  offense.  <br/>
<br/>
His bosses came in to talk about it, and told him they  weren&#39;t going to fire <br/>
him, that they would think about it &quot;until Monday&quot; and  maybe ask him to <br/>
resign.  He was not stressed about it in the least.   Very calm.  Slept like a <br/>
happy baby.<br/>
<br/>
He went in Monday  afternoon.  The owner doesn&#39;t do the talking, her husband <br/>
does.  He  asked Kirby if he wanted to continue to work there, or if he <br/>
thought he might  want to try something different.  Kirby said he&#39;d like to move on <br/>
and try  something new. [It was a serious offer, though; had he said &quot;I want <br/>
to  stay,&quot; they&#39;d&#39;ve kept him.] He was told they&#39;d give him six weeks to find  <br/>
another job, and the owner said &quot;and then he&#39;ll give us two weeks notice,  <br/>
right?&quot; and Kirby and her husband shrugged and vaguely agreed.  Kirby  turned in <br/>
his keys. He was told that after he&#39;d worked elsewhere for a  year, they would <br/>
be glad to hire him back.  The reason given was that he  would appreciate <br/>
what great bosses they were after he worked somewhere  else.  <br/>
 <br/>
Kirby was entirely calm and quite cheerful about it all. He  was more <br/>
relieved than disappointed, and told me the whole story in excited  detail.  I said <br/>
forget that two weeks thing--they knew he was on the  way out and didn&#39;t need <br/>
any notice.   So that was Monday afternoon. We  talked about factors and <br/>
possibilities and all for quite a while.  I  admitted to him that I was kinda <br/>
grieving because I had been so proud of him  having that job so long, and had <br/>
secretly been hoping he&#39;d have that job longer  than five or six years, and admitted <br/>
it was stupid for me to make it about  me.  We laughed about it, and he was <br/>
*so* together and matter of  fact about everything.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Tuesday early afternoon, Kirby went out to apply for jobs nearby.   His first <br/>
stop was at Game-Something (-Stop or -Proz or something, a video  game <br/>
store).  The manager plays Magic at Active Imagination sometimes  so knows Kirby and <br/>
the other employees and owners there.  Kirby said the  application was filled <br/>
in as they talked, and when it said education, he said he  was homeschooled <br/>
and was going to TVI.  The guy asked what classes he was  taking at TVI and <br/>
made note of it, and the back of the form asked Kirby to list  the game systems <br/>
he owned.  That list was long, and took a while, and the  guy was impressed.  <br/>
He told Kirby they had two part-time positions opening  in a couple of weeks, <br/>
and he should call back on Friday, the 8th.  We wrote  it on the calendar.<br/>
 <br/>
Bouyed by that happy interview and needing to go to karate, Kirby didn&#39;t  <br/>
apply for other jobs that day.  He told his sensei about the situation, and  was <br/>
offered the opportunity to man sales tables at regional karate tournaments  at <br/>
least four times a year (their dojo is a martial arts supply store, too, for  <br/>
many styles).  The first weekend offered was one when Kirby is  scheduled to <br/>
go to Las Vegas NV for a game tournament, but &quot;next time!&quot; was  assured.<br/>
<br/>
Later Tuesday night he talked to several of his friends about what  kinds of <br/>
jobs they thought he should apply for and they were recommending phone  tech <br/>
for cell phone companies or computer users.  There are several such  places in <br/>
and around Albuquerque.<br/>
 <br/>
Wednesday after his class he went and registered to take a GED  the two days <br/>
after he gets back from Las Vegas (the 20somethingth of April), so  he&#39;ll have <br/>
that if he needs it for any of the places he might want to try to  work.<br/>
 <br/>
Thursday afternoon he went in to work for a few hours, and the only  other <br/>
person there was the owner.  He said she kept looking at him oddly,  <br/>
suspiciously.  I called him on the phone about something that  afternoon,  and he told me <br/>
he was having the most uncomfortable shift  he&#39;d had for years, and he was <br/>
just going to phase out sooner than six  weeks.   The owner went home (as <br/>
scheduled) an hour before  Kirby left.  He was unable to close (no keys) and had <br/>
been told someone  else would come to close.  It was half an hour after he was <br/>
ready to leave  before anyone showed up to close.  Their loss; he charged for <br/>
the hour and  someone else was inconvenienced.<br/>
 <br/>
There was a staff meeting 9:00 a.m. Friday April 1,  and Kirby was  told to <br/>
be there, even though his shift on Friday was 5:00 to 1:00  a.m.    He had told <br/>
us already that he was going to ask them  not to schedule him anymore after <br/>
the two week schedule that was set.  They  said okay.  <br/>
 <br/>
He came back home very happy, saying his last day would be the 9th.<br/>
 <br/>
That weekend he started thinking maybe he should just wait and not get a  job <br/>
right away.  Keith supported it.  I expressed concern that if he  waited <br/>
until after Memorial Day (he wants to go to the Grand Outlandish  Tournament, a <br/>
big SCA campout near here at the end of May) that all the high  school seniors <br/>
would be out applying for the same kinds of jobs.  Keith  acknowledged my <br/>
point, but said it was fine if Kirby wanted to wait a  while.  Kirby reminded us <br/>
he&#39;s never had a vacation from working, and was  denied time off for the big <br/>
February event in Arizona.  <br/>
<br/>
Monday the 4th, he got a call from the video game store (the guy who&#39;d  said <br/>
to call him on the 8th) asking if he wanted the job.  Kirby said he&#39;d  been <br/>
thinking about it, and knew they didn&#39;t want someone short term, and felt  he <br/>
needed to get something with more hours than they were offering him.  <br/>
 <br/>
I was listening.  I was sad, because it seemed it would be a fun job,  it&#39;s <br/>
even closer than the other shop is to our house, and he was saying  no.  But <br/>
y&#39;know, it was a mature and honest thing to do.  And the guy  said he understood <br/>
but that if Kirby ever changed his mind, he would hire  him.  <br/>
 <br/>
So my emotions are agitation and embarrassment and the urge to tell his  boss <br/>
and her husband that they&#39;re NOT such great bosses as they think and that  <br/>
the Mr. Boss has been one of the LEAST respectful adults in  Kirby&#39;s life so <br/>
far.  My motherly instincts are stirred.  I&#39;m  afraid Kirby will want a job and <br/>
not have one later in the summer, rather than  having the luxury to turn one <br/>
down.<br/>
 <br/>
But... in the next few weeks he has a math final,  the trip to Las  Vegas, a <br/>
GED, and he&#39;s judging a set of karate belt tests on his own.   There will be a <br/>
second judge, but Kirby&#39;s never been the primary judge and  director of the <br/>
session before.  Also, those tests are always videotaped so  he&#39;s also in <br/>
charge of making sure the taping goes right (another senior student  will run the <br/>
camera).  And he&#39;s getting a tax refund which will cover the  trip to Las Vegas <br/>
(he&#39;s driving with another guy or two) and he&#39;ll have some to  tide him over <br/>
a while.<br/>
 <br/>
I just told Holly this is Kirby&#39;s last night.  She&#39;s been playing Halo  II a <br/>
LOT and has missed a lot of family business and news.  She said we  should go <br/>
and visit him at work, then.  I said nah, let him work.  She  said she really <br/>
wanted to, so I said she could call and see if he wanted a tuna  sandwich.  <br/>
She did.  He does.  She&#39;s very happy.  Gotta go,  then.<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry this was so long, but as soap operas go it&#39;s the exciting conclusion  <br/>
of a plotline here.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
(P.S.  While I was proofreading prior to hitting &quot;send,&quot; Holly went to  make <br/>
Kirby&#39;s sandwich.  I would&#39;ve done it, but she really wants to.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346189504">I drove Holly there and asked her if she wanted to go in alone.   Yes.  I <br/>
told her she didn&#39;t need to hurry out, and she stayed maybe 8 or 10  minutes.  I <br/>
sat outside and watched Kirby up behind the counter, in the  little raised <br/>
island, with the two computer-inventory cash registers, all the  cards, the store <br/>
full of gamers...  He was all lit up and I was sitting  watching it like I <br/>
was at a drive in.  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly chatted with people, and when she came out she said, &quot;I had to have  <br/>
some of the cake.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Cake?  They had a cake?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Yeah, this big [and measured out a full sheetcake size with her hands],  but <br/>
I couldn&#39;t tell what it said because there were only two piece left.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
We came home and I told Keith about the cake, and he said sweet things  about <br/>
how well our kids have worked out (mush about unschooling!  VERY  COOL!) and <br/>
then I went and asked Marty if there had been a cake there earlier  when he <br/>
was there for an afternoon tournament.  Yes, he said.  What  did it say?  Don&#39;t <br/>
think it said anything. Did they make a speech?   Yeah, Glen (boss&#39;s husband) <br/>
said it was Kirby&#39;s last day.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll ask Kirby tomorrow what Glen said.  On Sunday Kirby paints  miniatures <br/>
with another couple of friends he only sees on Sundays, and he&#39;ll  probably do <br/>
that tomorrow. At the shop where he will no longer work.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh yeah...<br/>
Forgot to say that Glen said they might want to hire him for special events  <br/>
sometimes.  (Magic Tournaments and such, usually run at hotels.)<br/>

Sounds like it was time for him to move on.  Greater opportunities might<br/>
just be waiting for him to knock on their door.  :-)<br/>
