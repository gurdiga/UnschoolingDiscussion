<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738122324">Wow, I have been lurking in the shadows of this unschooling <br/>
discussion forum for a number of months and now feel so moved to <br/>
chime in with my own 2 cents worth, and also ask a question or two, <br/>
that I hope won&#39;t become as &quot;hot&quot; a topic as Susan&#39;s recent one.<br/>
<br/>
First, talking about strewing...and I wonder if Susan has tried this <br/>
approach....I subscribe to Weekly Reader and just leave it setting <br/>
about (sometimes in the bathroom) as well as hanging the posters <br/>
that sometimes accompany it on the inside of our front door. This <br/>
makes the material accessible without &quot;pushing&quot; it on my kiddos. <br/>
They always notice when a new poster goes up, and spend a few <br/>
minutes each day (usually as they are leaving the house) to look <br/>
over the poster, read it (either aloud or to themselves) and <br/>
sometimes the material will spark a conversation. Last week the <br/>
poster was of a skeleton with the bones labeled and described. This <br/>
week is general health information to prevent catching colds and <br/>
flus. The posters are colorful and interesting (for both the <br/>
children and for me). I have a world map on the wall and a globe in <br/>
the middle of the dining room table. My girls enjoy finding <br/>
different locations they hear mentioned on TV and in books. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I actually thought I was going to be a &quot;relaxed <br/>
homeschooler&quot;, but have become an unschooler instead. Having raised <br/>
a number of children (I did foster care and adopted several) and <br/>
watching them struggle and flounder within the public and private <br/>
school sector, (my oldest is 32, the youngest is 7) I almost made <br/>
the same &quot;mistake&quot; with the youngest, but fortunately SHE stopped me <br/>
just in time. And now we are so enjoying one another&#39;s company and <br/>
learning from the world around us each and every day. She is very <br/>
creative and artistic; give her paper and crayons and a pair of <br/>
scissors and she makes the most detailed projects totally on her <br/>
own! (Her latest is a &quot;pop-up&quot; scene of animals, birds and their <br/>
nests in trees, flowers, and clouds.) I knew that traditional <br/>
schooling, either at home or away, was going to stifle this <br/>
wonderful creativity that she has going for herself; she is witty <br/>
and stubborn and a bit of a free spirit, all attributes that I <br/>
admire, but didn&#39;t think she would fit inside the &quot;box&quot; with 30 <br/>
others her age (nor did I want her to!). I grew up in a family who <br/>
put great pressure on educational success and who STILL are doing so <br/>
with the grandchildren! One of the best things I did was to move <br/>
3600 miles away; we have daily communication via email and IM, but I <br/>
can CHOOSE what I care to share and not share.....and believe me, I <br/>
have plenty of good stuff to share with them!<br/>
<br/>
Third, we reside in the state of Virginia. I am required to notify <br/>
my school district of my intention to provide &quot;alternative <br/>
education&quot; by August 15 of each school year. This is my first year <br/>
as an unschooler and I provided them with a letter of intent that <br/>
sort of followed the model that I had seen somewhere in the <br/>
unschooling website. Do unschoolers have to write a letter of intent <br/>
each year, the same as homeschoolers? Can they claim religious <br/>
exemption, thus eliminating the need for the letter?<br/>
<br/>
And last, I have to provide &quot;information on educational progress&quot; by <br/>
August 1; this can be in the form of either a standardized test, OR <br/>
grades from a correspondence school OR a portfolio with examples of <br/>
my child&#39;s work in English and Math. (testing or grades are also <br/>
required in only English and Math) What do unschoolers typically <br/>
present as their child&#39;s educational progress for this requirement?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance; best wishes to all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschoolers are homeschoolers.    <br/>
Unschooing is to homeschooling as the open classroom is to traditional <br/>
school.    You&#39;ll still need to describe it, if you&#39;re going to register with the <br/>
state.   (Not all states have such requirements.)<br/>
