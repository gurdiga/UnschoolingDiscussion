<div id="ygrps-yiv-97426089">***I haven&#39;t seen anyone suggest this but this is what I would do.<br/>
I would call the local office and ask *them* if someone had called you. <br/>
This <br/>
person did not identify himself, correct? if he isn&#39;t part of DFS, they <br/>
should <br/>
know that someone is claiming to be part of their office. If he is a <br/>
DFS <br/>
investigator, I would make a formal complaint that this person didn&#39;t <br/>
ID himself <br/>
AND scared your daughter. <br/>
Don&#39;t let them roll over on you. You have the right to know if there is <br/>
a <br/>
complaint about you, not who complained but if there is one.<br/>
*******<br/>
<br/>
This would be my suggestion also - because if it isn&#39;t DFS, then you REALLY could have a problem.  There are a lot of sick wackos out there.<br/>
