<div id="ygrps-yiv-24261164">I really need some ideas for creative ways of handling conflict <br/>
among family members, or else a different perspective on conflict <br/>
before I lose my mind!<br/>
Some examples:<br/>
<br/>
1. We have a small, 3 br house.  One child has his own room, and the <br/>
other two share.  As a result, only one child has the power to be <br/>
alone whenever he wants which causes hard feelings for my middle <br/>
child. <br/>
<br/>
2. One of my older children wants my attention (to play cards, or <br/>
whatever), and my 3yo wants to climb on the table, be on my lap, <br/>
hold my cards, and change the rules of the game.  Eventually someone <br/>
is crying or the older child storms off in a huff and slams his door.<br/>
<br/>
3. We are on an outing with other homeschoolers, and my oldest <br/>
child&#39;s friend didn&#39;t show up.  He begins complaining, loudly, in <br/>
the middle of my conversation with another mother, that he wants to <br/>
leave NOW.  I suggest he play GBA in the car for twenty minutes or <br/>
so since we&#39;d driven all the way there, I was in the middle of a <br/>
conversation, and his youngest brother was having fun playing.  This <br/>
isn&#39;t acceptable to him,  so we end up leaving with half of us <br/>
resentful that we left and half of us resentful that we wasted an <br/>
hour going in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
4. One child is singing in the common area of the house, and it&#39;s <br/>
bothering the other children.  When the singing child realizes this, <br/>
he sings even louder, apparently enjoying the commotion he&#39;s causing.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on.  Sometimes it seems that the intense family <br/>
togetherness that unschooling brings is one big exercise for me in <br/>
mediating conflict and hanging onto my sanity by a thread.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you with more than one child, how do you deal with the <br/>
rift between what I perceive to be the unschooling &quot;ideal&quot; <br/>
(everybody happily doing their thing, together or apart, and <br/>
supporting each other&#39;s journeys) and the day to day reality which <br/>
can be quite different?<br/>

My two oldest ages 9 3/4 and 7,{for now anyway}with the video games. one person is &quot;in charge&quot; one day and switch off day the next day. They seem to want to cooperate better because the oldest isn&#39;t always the one in charge. <br/>
<br/>
They want to play with each other but there is always conflict about WHAT they are going to play and who is in charge of controler #1. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Seems to help for me.<br/>

<br/>
alone whenever he wants which causes hard feelings for my middle <br/>
<br/>
child.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Treehouse, playhouse, little soft place behind the couch.  (things we had <br/>
when we were in a little house and all three kids shared)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;2. One of my older children wants my attention (to play cards, or <br/>
<br/>
whatever), and my 3yo wants to climb on the table, be on my lap, <br/>
<br/>
hold my cards, and change the rules of the game.  Eventually someone <br/>
<br/>
is crying or the older child storms off in a huff and slams his door.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We would rush to play a game when the youngest was asleep.  That&#39;s the only <br/>
time we did jigsaw puzzles and they had to be no more than 100 pieces.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t sew when any toddler was awake for fear of losing the pins at and into <br/>
the hands of a flinging baby.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I would hire a slightly older neighbor girl (11, 12) to play with <br/>
the baby and then we had time for older-kid stuff.<br/>
<br/>
#3, I came to hate group outings, so my advice is don&#39;t go.  Or just go with <br/>
one other family you can depend on.<br/>
<br/>
4. One child is singing in the common area of the house, and it&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
bothering the other children.  When the singing child realizes this, <br/>
<br/>
he sings even louder, apparently enjoying the commotion he&#39;s causing.<br/>
<br/>
We encourage singing.  I&#39;d tell the kids who didn&#39;t want to hear it to go out <br/>
and play with the dog.  &quot;She can&#39;t sing forever!&quot;   Or (not quite as <br/>
friendly) they could sing WITH the singing child, and not quite get the words <br/>
or tune right.  That has happened here.  Retaliatory sing-along.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For those of you with more than one child, how do you deal with the <br/>
<br/>
rift between what I perceive to be the unschooling &quot;ideal&quot; <br/>
<br/>
(everybody happily doing their thing, together or apart, and <br/>
<br/>
supporting each other&#39;s journeys) and the day to day reality which <br/>
<br/>
can be quite different?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Usually there&#39;s one kid who could be removed to best advantage.  <br/>
Distraction, &quot;special job&quot; of some sort, exporting them with dad or <br/>
neighbors, importing another kid to change the dynamics...<br/>
<br/>
But if there are TWO kids melting down, I&#39;d try to take them somewhere with <br/>
more room.  Playground, or children&#39;s museum or even just out for french <br/>
fries or ice cream.<br/>

<br/>
We used to have rotations on who could pick where to sit in the car.  What <br/>
messed it up was if one wasn&#39;t in on a particular trip and lost a turn.  If <br/>
two kids were there, the rotation proceded.  If only one was there it didn&#39;t <br/>
count, since he could pick.<br/>
<br/>
In case of conflicts outside of turn taking, we did scissors/paper/stone.   <br/>
Once in public Holly and Marty disagreed about who was going to ride on Keith <br/>
shoulders and without saying a word about it, they both did the <br/>
scissors/paper/stone thing, and whoever won went up there and the other was <br/>
fine.  We were in a restaurant, and a couple of tables of people who were <br/>
nearby commented on how cool and civilized that was, and that they&#39;d never <br/>
seen kids settle something that way.<br/>
<br/>
With video games, it was someone&#39;s turn.  If it was Kirby&#39;s turn and he was <br/>
letting Marty play with him, he could call the shots.  If it was Marty&#39;s <br/>
turn, he could choose the controller, choose the chair, choose to play alone <br/>
or with Kirby, but it was Marty&#39;s time.  When he chose to stop, Holly was up. <br/>
 Her turn might be short or long or passed.  Then it was Kirby&#39;s.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to sound resistant to advice... I do appreciate it.  <br/>
I&#39;m just incredibly burned out.  It scares me because I know several <br/>
local families who previously homeschooled but ended up putting the <br/>
kids in school because they simply couldn&#39;t stand the fighting. It <br/>
scares me because my husband already sees this as the only solution- <br/>
I have to remind him of our reasons for keeping them out of school <br/>
in the first place.<br/>
He means well... he&#39;s looking out for my mental health since I&#39;m the <br/>
one with the kids all day.<br/>
There has to be a better solution.<br/>

Then I would take each child aside alone, maybe for a walk in the yard and <br/>
tell them things HAVE to change if they want to stay home.  That home under <br/>
the present conditions is not going to continue.  And ask them what needs to <br/>
happen for them to act better.<br/>

Tears on my part and everything.  We&#39;ve had cycles like this before, <br/>
and unfortunately the kids now see &quot;things HAVE to change if you <br/>
want to stay home&quot; as a totally empty threat.  Hence my husband <br/>
thinking they NEED to go, at least for a semester, in order to see <br/>
how good they have it and to know we mean it.<br/>
I&#39;d rather things get better without having to resort to that.<br/>

that if I have another baby and if it&#39;s a girl, their sister will <br/>
have to share her room too.  They have the option of fixing attic <br/>
rooms into bedrooms, but they don&#39;t want to go up there.  When <br/>
they&#39;re older I bet they might.   I had the idea of hanging some kind <br/>
of fabric, like a curtain between the two beds, so they can have <br/>
their own &quot;space&quot; in their room.  I&#39;ve also seen single bedrooms be <br/>
seperated by big dressers and shelves back to back going down the <br/>
middle of the room. They didn&#39;t like those ideas.  But maybe one of <br/>
my ideas will work for you! lol <br/>

<br/>
That is tough too.  I hate when three different children want me to <br/>
do three different things at the same time.  It can be really hard to <br/>
come up with ways to make everyone happy.  My 5 and 9 year olds love <br/>
to play Uno, but they only want to play one on one with me.  So I <br/>
suggested we just take turns.  Some nights they accept it peacefully <br/>
but sometimes they fight over it.  Especially my 9 year old, because <br/>
she used to have me exclusively for Uno until her brother learned how <br/>
to play.  It&#39;s just not fun playing with one child while the other <br/>
child pouts and cries about having to wait his turn right beside <br/>
him.  Last night my daughter was having an especially hard time <br/>
accepting that she had to share me, and I solved the problem by <br/>
pulling out a book that I had bought and put aside for a special <br/>
time.  So she didn&#39;t mind sitting and reading the new book every time <br/>
I played a hand with her brother.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could get a second deck of cards, set the three year old on <br/>
the table beside you, and let him &quot;play&quot; while you play?  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 3. We are on an outing with other homeschoolers, and my oldest <br/>
&gt; child&#39;s friend didn&#39;t show up.  He begins complaining, loudly, in <br/>
&gt; the middle of my conversation with another mother, that he wants to <br/>
&gt; leave NOW.  I suggest he play GBA in the car for twenty minutes or <br/>
&gt; so since we&#39;d driven all the way there, I was in the middle of a <br/>
&gt; conversation, and his youngest brother was having fun playing.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; isn&#39;t acceptable to him,  so we end up leaving with half of us <br/>
&gt; resentful that we left and half of us resentful that we wasted an <br/>
&gt; hour going in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I can relate!  I have a son who just doesn&#39;t like to leave his <br/>
house.  I&#39;ve already gone places--playgrounds, skating rinks, <br/>
libraries, etc.--because the 9 and 3 year old want to go but the 5 <br/>
year old doesn&#39;t.  Nothing will make him happy when I drag him away <br/>
from the house and he spends the whole time pulling on me trying to <br/>
get me to go home.  It&#39;s exhausting when he&#39;s like that!  The best <br/>
solution of course is to try to go on excursions when my husband is <br/>
home so that he can just stay home with him, but when there&#39;s a <br/>
birthday party at noon and dh is still at work, the only way to take <br/>
2 of the kids who want to go is to drag him along to.  <br/>
<br/>
But if it were my oldest child having the problem you described (It&#39;s <br/>
so much easier coming up with a solution for someone else, isn&#39;t it? <br/>
lol) I would probably try apologizing to my friend that I couldn&#39;t <br/>
keep chatting because my child needs my help with a struggle he&#39;s <br/>
having.  If she&#39;s a good enough friend and if your younger child is <br/>
comfortable with you being away for a little while, maybe even ask <br/>
her to keep an eye on my youngest child, and take the older child for <br/>
a walk and listen to his troubles and give him some mommy support.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4. One child is singing in the common area of the house, and it&#39;s <br/>

 </span></blockquote>this, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he sings even louder, apparently enjoying the commotion he&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
I know the key is to figure out why they are getting a kick out of <br/>
annoying their siblings--maybe it&#39;s jealousy or boredom.  I know that <br/>
when I have days that each child doesn&#39;t get the one on one time with <br/>
me that he needs, that the behavior is worse.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing that I&#39;ve seen have some positive results on some <br/>
behavior issues with my kids is homeoapthy.  Just something that I&#39;ll <br/>
throw out there for your consideration.  <br/>
<br/>
But even with giving them enough of my time and with the homeopathy, <br/>
my kids still do things to bother each other on purpose and they seem <br/>
to get a kick out of seeing each other get upset.  I try to tell my <br/>
daughter (9) that if she wouldn&#39;t get all dramatic and let her <br/>
younger brothers see her being affected by them they would probably <br/>
stop doing it, because they do it to get a charge out of her.  They <br/>
think it&#39;s funny when big sister cries and throws a fit and yells and <br/>
screams all kinds of things at them in frustration.  I told her that <br/>
when they bother her to go to her room and scream in her pillow and <br/>
calm herself down, or even to quietly ask me to come with her to her <br/>
room and talk and cry with me so that they don&#39;t see that they have <br/>
the power to get her to put on a show for them.  She doesn&#39;t listen <br/>
to my advice all the time though. <br/>
<br/>

&gt; can be quite different?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Help.<br/>
&gt; Patti<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me, I still see the unschooling &quot;ideal&quot; in our day to day reality <br/>
but sometimes I feel overwhelmed and think that the only way things <br/>
can be truly peaceful all the time is if there were more than just <br/>
one adult in the house striving towards the idea.  When dh is home <br/>
things are easier, because while I take one child somewhere he can <br/>
stay home with the one who doesn&#39;t want to leave home, or he can play <br/>
a game with someone while I make supper, or comfort a child while I <br/>
talk to another.  The moments when all three kids want to do the same <br/>
thing, or one can keep himself occupied while I do something with <br/>
another are precious, but they certainly don&#39;t happen all the time!  <br/>
I often have three kids  pulling me in three different directions.  <br/>
I&#39;ve found that there is often a creative solution if you&#39;re willing <br/>
to really apply yourself but not always.  Or sometimes I&#39;m just too <br/>
tired to think clearly enough to come up with a creative solution.<br/>
<br/>
I am resolved that if my children have children, I want to be <br/>
available to them to help them unschool their children.  If my <br/>
daughter has three kids pulling her in three different directions, <br/>
grandma Sheila will be there to take one or two of them and do <br/>
something really special with them while their mom does what she <br/>
needs to do with the other one.  I really think that an active, <br/>
loving grandmother involved in the lives of families with young <br/>
children could GREATLY contribute to the peace of the family.   <br/>
<br/>
I also think that you get better coming up with creative solutions <br/>
with practice.  I&#39;ve made a lot of mistakes and had to put a lot of <br/>
thought into thinking of ways that I could have done things better. <br/>
Sometimes I can&#39;t figure out how I could have dealt with the <br/>
situation better and I post on here and ask for ideas.  I always get <br/>
awesome input here.   Then when a similar situation comes up again I <br/>
have a better idea of how to handle it.  There is nothing more <br/>
satisfying to me than to have an especially difficult situation with <br/>
my children come up and for me to be able to sit back afterwards and <br/>
say, &quot;Wow, I handled that really well!&quot;  And I think it&#39;s that desire <br/>
to be able to say that all the time that makes me a little bit moody <br/>
when things don&#39;t turn out as peacefully as I had hoped.  I have to <br/>
constantly keep reminding myself that in real life the roads won&#39;t <br/>
always be smooth.  <br/>
<br/>
One time when they were fighting over who I would tuck in first, with <br/>
one jumping on me, crying and trying to pull me off the bed because <br/>
he thought I should be tucking him in first, I bribed one of them.  I <br/>
just quietly whispered to him that if he lets me lay with his brother <br/>
until he falls asleep, I would go downstairs and make chocolate chip <br/>
cookies with him.  He agreed and we ended up having an extra special <br/>
night together.  I almost didn&#39;t do it, because I thought to myself <br/>
that I can&#39;t get into the habit of bribing.   Sooner or later it will <br/>
stop working because they&#39;ll catch on, or sometimes I&#39;ll be too tired <br/>
to stay up really late doing activities to make one child happy <br/>
because he didn&#39;t get tucked in first.  But that night I figured that <br/>
I just really wanted peace right at that moment and that I would <br/>
worry about tomorrow night when tomorrow came.  And yes, I have <br/>
nights that they all want tucked in first and I just have to choose <br/>
one.  I&#39;ve tried taking turns so it&#39;s fair and they don&#39;t like that.  <br/>
But when I take it one night at a time and really concentrate on the <br/>
present moment and ask myself just for THIS NIGHT how can I help <br/>
these guys go to bed happy, I often come up with happy solutions.  <br/>
Not always!  But often. <br/>

real possiblity that he might be the loser.  Or they will play and <br/>
throw a fit because they lost and we might as well have never played <br/>
at all.  They cry and pout and jump on me and their brother as I&#39;m <br/>
lying with him on his bed.  <br/>
<br/>
But not always.  When dh is off of work the next day and doesn&#39;t have <br/>
to go to bed really early, he can help occupy one child while I help <br/>
the other.  Lately my daughter has been going to bed earlier than the <br/>
boys are ready to go to bed, so at least her bed time is more <br/>
peaceful. Sometimes the three year old falls asleep downstairs and <br/>
all I have to do is carry him upstairs.  And of course some nights <br/>
they don&#39;t whine and demand to be first.  <br/>

<br/>
Sometimes we lay blankets out on the livingroom floor and we all <br/>
sleep down there, which eliminates the issue of who gets tucked in <br/>
first.  Of course then there&#39;s the fighting over which two get to lay <br/>
beside me!  lol, there&#39;s always something to fight over. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936386303">Perhaps I&#39;m being overly optimistic, that there&#39;s always a way to <br/>
work through what&#39;s causing them to act that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps I&#39;m overly sensitive to the idea of &quot;sending the problem <br/>
child away&quot;, even if it is only to school, because of my brother.  My <br/>
parents were very strict and my mom had severe emotional problems.  I <br/>
became the over-compliant, I&#39;ll-do-anything-to-please you-and-then-<br/>
maybe-you&#39;ll-love-me child and he became outrightly rebellious.  He <br/>
refused to go to school and church, refused to go to bed at night, <br/>
refused to eat meals with the family, refused to pick up after <br/>
himself, cursed at my parents and even fought back physically when my <br/>
dad tried to force him to do something.  My parents kept getting <br/>
stricter and taking away more privelages, until he got to the point <br/>
where he wasn&#39;t allowed to leave the house except for church and <br/>
school and had no more material posessions left.(and we lived where <br/>
you couldn&#39;t walk anywhere and he had no transportation)  His <br/>
attitude was that eventually they&#39;ll run out of things to take away <br/>
from him and then they won&#39;t be able to control him anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
My dad had police officers help drag him out of bed and force him to <br/>
school once.  And once, he was drug to a psychiatric ward of a <br/>
hospital because he was such a behavior problem.  He wasn&#39;t the one <br/>
who needed to be taken to a psychiatric hospital. <br/>
<br/>
When my kids have a behavior problem that seems impossible, the first <br/>
thing I do lately is tell myself that maybe my mindful parenting <br/>
isn&#39;t quite mindful enough.   Did I spend enough time that day with <br/>
that child, doing something that is important to him?  Is he jealous <br/>
of his sister and maybe I can help him work through that jealousy?   <br/>
And usually I&#39;m able to find what I can do differently that will make <br/>
the situation better.  When I&#39;m not able to make the situation <br/>
better, I just figure that I need more practice and experience at <br/>
being a peaceful parent.  Or maybe they&#39;re out of balance and need a <br/>
homeopathic remedy.  <br/>
<br/>
But never, ever, ever will any of my children be threatened with <br/>
being taken away from their home.  <br/>

If you take yourself out as arbiter or judge and let it be random, they can <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881290146">Well I&#39;m not in a small house but we can still run into similar situations here. Tara has her own room, Joseph does and Sierra and Alyssa share. If Sierra wants to be alone, I&#39;ll try and keep Alyssa occupied or even Joseph will play with her in the playroom. Then with Tara gone most of the time, I can always send someone in there too to watch tv or a movie that no one else wants to see. Then we have the living room. What about setting up a place in your bedroom when one needs alone time? Kids just need a small spot and the chance to shut the door.<br/>
<br/>
As far as more one on one time with older ones, what about having someone in to play with one or two of them while you attend to the others? Or a relative taking one out for awhile so you have some time.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra and Alyssa usually like to go with me when I go out. Target, Petsmart or even Publix. (grocery store) Joseph doesn&#39;t like to so I make a point of going somewhere he likes with just him. I try real hard to make times to go out with each child, just me and them. It makes the home time less stressed when they all want me. They each feel like they get their time. I&#39;ve made 3 separate trips to Target in one week buying each child new shoes. It was just for shoes and of course they spent some time in the toy aisle But it was just me and one child and that was very special for them.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here is doing something annoying to another, it depends on the circumstances as to who should stay or not. One cannot go into someone else&#39;s room and be annoying. If they are in the playroom and they alone are bothering everyone else, they are asked to take it in their own room. If they are in the living room or dining room or kitchen, then the annoyed ones get to go to the playroom or their own rooms. Then there&#39; s always outside. They are never asked to stop, just take it elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
As far as outtings go, I haven&#39;t run into this much as a problem. Once in awhile, one will want to leave. I&#39;ll ask them to just be patient for awhile as the others are having fun and it&#39;s not fair for them to have to leave. Usually I can get the frustrated one all happy again and they change their mind. Just happened today at the park. We were there from 12-5:00. Joseph got a bit annoyed at his sister around 3:00 and said he wanted to go. I took him aside, wiped him down from the dirt and sweat, got him something to drink and just talked about why he was upset and then about nothing to do with that. He changed his mind and happily stayed until I needed to go at 5:00. <br/>
<br/>
Excusing yourself from the conversation could have let him know how important his dilemma was to you. Taking some time to calm him down first, then talk might have made a difference. Children for the most part are easy to get involved with something else once they know you are really into what they are feeling. Sometimes just knowing you understand makes all the difference. <br/>

&lt;&lt;With video games, it was someone&#39;s turn.  If it was Kirby&#39;s turn and he<br/>
was<br/>
letting Marty play with him, he could call the shots.  If it was Marty&#39;s<br/>
turn, he could choose the controller, choose the chair, choose to play alone<br/>
or with Kirby, but it was Marty&#39;s time.  When he chose to stop, Holly was<br/>
up.<br/>
Her turn might be short or long or passed.  Then it was Kirby&#39;s.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Turns work here too. Usually with less exciting stuff, like who gets to feed<br/>
the tadpoles or fish that day! I never have them argue over computer or<br/>
video games. Go figure. So far the seating in the van is pretty easy too.<br/>
Joseph usually prefers to sit in the back which gives Sierra the choice of<br/>
sitting next to Alyssa or in back with Joseph. Once in awhile Alyssa will<br/>
ask Joseph to sit next to her and Sierra gladly gives up her seat. A lot of<br/>
things are just who asks first. Then if the other wants to do it too, they<br/>
get it first next time.<br/>
<br/>
The kids have tried the paper rock scissors thing and it doesn&#39;t work for<br/>
them. They aren&#39;t decisive enough yet. One usually puts theirs out first<br/>
which lets the other change their mind or they both try to second guess the<br/>
other. It leads to more problems. We use a coin toss on the few occasions<br/>
where we need a decision. Like if both kids want to use the same shower and<br/>
go at the same time. Next time around the unlucky one gets to choose.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Sandra<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you&#39;ve looked into the face of a newly turned 18 year old that is being <br/>
sent away from the only home he&#39;s ever known by an exhasperated, over tired <br/>
father you will KNOW that is NEVER the answer.<br/>
<br/>
There is NEVER a just reason to give up on a child, whether the child is 8 <br/>
months, 8 years or 18 years, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
We raised them in safe secure loving homes and they need to know that no <br/>
matter what THIS is their &quot;soft place to fall&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a LOT of work raising children, a LOT of work, it&#39;s sometimes even <br/>
lifelong work, my DH didn&#39;t get it, he says he does now, he BETTER get it <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the easy way out to just remove the child from the situation, that way <br/>
you are no longer responsible for the problem.  It&#39;s much harder to try to <br/>
get the child to let you kow what the REAL problem is and to help you find a <br/>
solution to make the home a more peaceful place.<br/>
<br/>
Every child is different, different things work for different children, they <br/>
respond quite differently to almost everthing, so a lot of parenting is trial <br/>
and error but the answer is somewhere in your heart.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard when one child finds pleasure in tormenting another one but really <br/>
don&#39;t we all have to learn to get along with people who do things that <br/>
irritate us?  So one child sings, loudly, maybe even badly, that child is <br/>
sharing the joy of their heart.  Maybe the child who is irritated wishes <br/>
he/she were that joyful and beomes sullen and irritated by the joy coming <br/>
from said child.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you know your own child best, but I&#39;m still learning what works <br/>
with each of my children and they are not babies to anyone but me anymore.<br/>
<br/>
An example is I&#39;ve always been loud, I sometimes (too often) had a short <br/>
temper when the children were all little, a loud voice would immediately stop <br/>
an unwanted behaviour in my older two children, my third seemed oblivious and <br/>
my fourth would immediately break into tears.  I had to consciously try to <br/>
hold back and change the way I responded to things.<br/>
<br/>
I only found out maybe a year or two ago that when my third child (who is <br/>
most like me and will blow a gasket in a second and rant for ever it seems) <br/>
did something very unpleasant the best way to speak to him to get him to <br/>
listen is in a very soft almost wisper almost baby talk, he listens without <br/>
yelling or defending or throwing a fit.  Something that I had consciously <br/>
tried to always use in childhood, I should have been more cognizant of during <br/>
his teen years.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many things that HAVE to be done before considering giving the <br/>
child the directive to leave the house.  Such a threat will fall on deaf ears <br/>
anyway.  Nothing changed with my child because he was threatened with leaving <br/>
the home, nor did it change when he was put outside the door without a key in <br/>
the middle of winter.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that my son even wanted to come back to a place that was so cruel to <br/>
him is a mystery to me but I&#39;m thankful for it nevertheless.<br/>
<br/>
TALKING is what made the difference, quiet reflective talking, well that and <br/>
the tears I think, tears have such a cleansing effect on the soul sometimes <br/>
and children don&#39;t like to see their parents cry.  They can tune out the <br/>
yelling and the ugly voices, but crying... they know they hurt you and they <br/>
don&#39;t want to do that at all.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you, I remember days when I was totally exhasperated by a <br/>
child&#39;s behaviour and couldn&#39;t even think of what to do next about it.<br/>
<br/>
I LONG for the days of being over tired and sticky hands and singing off key <br/>
to irritate one&#39;s siblings... too soon those voices will be dimmed and then <br/>
finally hushed by the adults they are destined to be and you too will long <br/>
for the days the swings were in full swing and the bickering sounds of your <br/>
precious babies was loud in the air.<br/>

&gt; another are precious, but they certainly don&#39;t happen all the time!  <br/>
&gt; I often have three kids  pulling me in three different directions.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found that there is often a creative solution if you&#39;re willing <br/>
&gt; to really apply yourself but not always.  Or sometimes I&#39;m just too <br/>
&gt; tired to think clearly enough to come up with a creative solution.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing that must be made very clear to siblings and reinforced at times of <br/>
particular struggles is that they are IT.  These two or four or six people <br/>
seated in front of you are the ONLY people that will be left in this world <br/>
one day that KNOW all of each others stories, their history, where they came <br/>
from and how they got where they are.<br/>
<br/>
My older children just the other day reminded me how I used to tell them all <br/>
the time, make your brothers/sisters your best friend, you are going to need <br/>
them throughout your life.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe they came to rely on each other too much but I get great joy out of <br/>
seeing my two that are grown and on their own invite the younger two over for <br/>
a sleep over and many times call the other sibling to sleep over as well.<br/>
<br/>
Recently we were all in Mrytle Beach for the youngest child&#39;s National Cheer <br/>
competition.  I didn&#39;t find it odd that I needed a three bedroom condo when <br/>
the daughter was at a different hotel with her squad.  I had so many comments <br/>
about how my grown children took four days off work to ALL be there to <br/>
support Cait when in reality we hardly got to see her except for her two <br/>
minutes thirty seconds, twice on stage.  Sometimes it takes strangers to <br/>
point out something we don&#39;t see, that siblings can grow up to love each <br/>
other and support each other and really LIKE each other.  <br/>
<br/>
Some days when they are bickering and being particularly nasty to each other, <br/>
it&#39;s hard to imagine I know.<br/>
<br/>
One person&#39;s advice about removing yourself from the situation WORKS.  When I <br/>
had four in PS it was ALWAYS a morning battle, one morning out of <br/>
exasperation, I went to my room and shut the door, when they banged on it and <br/>
continued fighting I didn&#39;t answer them or try to help solve the problems.  <br/>
Suddenly it got quiet and they conentrated on getting ready for school.<br/>
<br/>
After that, each child got their own alarm clock and each child got <br/>
themselves up for school ( sometimes I still had to wake a sleepy child THEN <br/>
retreat to my room) once THEY were responsible for getting along and it <br/>
wasn&#39;t MY problem that they didn&#39;t , they figured out a way to solve it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of the child who is irritated running to mom asking her to <br/>
&quot;fix&quot; the offending sibling, explain that it is up to that child to work with <br/>
said sibling to find a compromise they can reach.  I bet it isn&#39;t worth their <br/>
trying to figure out a solution most times and they will just ignore it and <br/>
said child will get no pleasure out of being ignored and mommy will have more <br/>
peace.  Maybe it&#39;s just YOUR time they are wanting, which is most likely true <br/>
and it&#39;s hard to figure out how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
My children all had special interests and when they no longer went to school <br/>
it made it so much easier to persue.  I took one child (the child who NEVER <br/>
wanted to leave the house) to FL alone once, we flew down, rented a car and <br/>
spent seven days at Nasa, no Disney, no crowds, just exploring what he was <br/>
interested in.  You could do that on a smaller scale right here at home by <br/>
hiring a sitter while the one child has a special day.  My younger child <br/>
loved to fish, I frequently packed lunches and we went to the lake but I <br/>
learned that he wanted HIS special time to be alone, just the two of us at <br/>
the lake, we did that too.  One child was amused by simple &quot;doing&quot; lunch and <br/>
shopping at the mall without another child whinning to go home.  Yet another <br/>
child was very hard to please and find an interest, even though she did many <br/>
things nothing seemed like enough for her and it was always hard.  Now it&#39;s <br/>
like she is an only child and there are days when she tells the other kids to <br/>
go home to their own houses, the house is too noisy for her, they mostly just <br/>
laugh at her and tell her to go to her room, but parenting goes on, probably <br/>
even from the grave.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I wish I had learned to do earlier was savor every single <br/>
minute of my childrens childhood, even the hard times, the times you feel you <br/>
just can&#39;t do it, because they are over so very soon, instead of feeling <br/>
frustrated, I wish I would have looked at things differently so much sooner.  <br/>
I so often wish I had come to homeschooling when they were babies instead of <br/>
later in their lives so I could have had that much more time with them.<br/>
<br/>
I have to thank you for the wonderful (and some not so wonderful) memories <br/>
this thread has helped me relive and to apologize for my lengthy rambling <br/>
responses.  I just wish I could find the words to help you understand that <br/>
THIS is childhood, the perfect household days happen, but not every day, so <br/>
try to find the joy in the little things and don&#39;t let this control your <br/>
days.  Even though it&#39;s so very hard I know.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; miserable.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the difference with me or their father &quot;threatening&quot; school <br/>
is that my kids are *not* terrified of it.  The possibility of one <br/>
of them trying it has actually come up in nonstressful <br/>
conversations, especially with my oldest.  We&#39;ve talked about how <br/>
he&#39;d get some space from his little brothers, make some new friends, <br/>
etc (they share their homeschooled friends and their neighbor <br/>
friends, so it&#39;s not even like they have personal space in the <br/>
friend department right now).  <br/>
<br/>
So the idea of school as a solution is only &quot;mean&quot; or &quot;terrifying&quot; <br/>
depending on the child and the context.  For some children it could <br/>
be, or has been, a workable solution to too much togetherness, <br/>
especially if there are other reasons for going as well.<br/>
Anyway, what they both usually say to the idea of school is that <br/>
they want the *other* one to go so *they* have the house to <br/>
themselves. :-/  <br/>
Ironically, when one of them does have the opportunity to be <br/>
somewhere else for a good chunk of time the others pester me about <br/>
when he will be coming home.  I think &quot;oh! They miss each other!&quot; <br/>
but then when they are reunited the teasing and problems start right <br/>
up again.  It&#39;s almost like they prefer being together in their <br/>
struggles to being apart.<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the helpful input eveyone.<br/>
Mabye today will be one of their getting-along-great days and I can <br/>
get a fresh perspective.<br/>

-=-When my kids have a behavior problem that seems impossible, the first <br/>
<br/>
thing I do lately is tell myself that maybe my mindful parenting <br/>
<br/>
isn&#39;t quite mindful enough.   Did I spend enough time that day with <br/>
<br/>
that child, doing something that is important to him?  Is he jealous <br/>
<br/>
of his sister and maybe I can help him work through that jealousy?   <br/>
<br/>
And usually I&#39;m able to find what I can do differently that will make <br/>
<br/>
the situation better.  When I&#39;m not able to make the situation <br/>
<br/>
better, I just figure that I need more practice and experience at <br/>
<br/>
being a peaceful parent.  Or maybe they&#39;re out of balance and need a <br/>
<br/>
homeopathic remedy.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
All true and right.<br/>
<br/>
And if we make all the most peaceful recommendations to someone who assures <br/>
us that none of that will work, and they really ARE sure none of that will <br/>
work, then what?<br/>
<br/>
-=-But never, ever, ever will any of my children be threatened with <br/>
<br/>
being taken away from their home.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
None are acting like your brother, though, and you&#39;re not being your mom or <br/>
dad.<br/>
<br/>
School was better for me than home.  I had a cousin who was violent (and was <br/>
sexually abusing my sister, but I didn&#39;t know until years later).  My parents <br/>
had brought this cousin and another to live with us as permanent foster <br/>
children.  There they were.  I would have been safer and happier leaving, had <br/>
we homeschooled, than being with that cousin all the time.  &quot;My home&quot; became <br/>
my cousin&#39;s home.<br/>
<br/>
Not all people can and will get along even in ideal circumstances, even if <br/>
they&#39;re siblings.  What if they aren&#39;t?  Not all parents can and will have <br/>
the patience to hang in there.  <br/>
<br/>
Rubyprincess has kids who loved each other.  She recommends leaving the <br/>
situation.<br/>
When my parents left the situation, my sister was sexually abused.  I was <br/>
physically pummelled once, and I just rolled up until the cousin quit.  Her <br/>
life had been awful, indeed, but now my life was becoming awful because of <br/>
her being in my home.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of possible factors.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree there are LOTS of possible factors but I thought basically we were <br/>
talking about our OWN children, not those who come into the home nearly grown <br/>
and with their own baggage.<br/>
<br/>
I would never just leave me children to fend off hatefulness, physical injury <br/>
or heaven forbid sexual abuse from someone that I BROUGHT into my home.<br/>
<br/>
We have to be MINDFUL of everyone that comes in contact with our children.<br/>
<br/>
All rules are off, all bets are cancelled when someone outside the home comes <br/>
into it and damages others.  Children that have grown and been nourished in <br/>
the same home as each other are different to each other.  THEY can say or do <br/>
things to their siblings but let an OUTSIDER even THINK about it and life <br/>
will not be good for said outsider.  They really love each other on some level<br/>
 but as kids sometimes they think it&#39;s THEIR job to keep mommy occupied and <br/>
feeling useful at solving lifes problems for them.<br/>
<br/>
In no way would I EVER advocate walking away and allowing a relationship such <br/>
as the one described above to continue with my children.  I hope I would <br/>
recognize the hardships said child had BEFORE coming to my home, try to give <br/>
them as much love and compassion as possible but be VERY clear about the <br/>
rules for living in my home with MY children.  If the child had a very rough <br/>
life and was being shown lots of love and compassion, hopefully the child <br/>
would be very grateful and loving back, I&#39;m sure that is not always the case.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and for the record, on any given day, my children have been known to shout <br/>
at each other, say they don&#39;t like each other, and even threaten bodily harm, <br/>
but in the end, they would defend each other to the death.<br/>

&lt;&lt; If anyone here is doing something annoying to another, it depends on the <br/>
circumstances as to who should stay or not. One cannot go into someone else&#39;s <br/>
room and be annoying. If they are in the playroom and they alone are <br/>
bothering everyone else, they are asked to take it in their own room. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have a comedy bit about this here.  To break the tension when someone&#39;s <br/>
being really annoying, I&#39;ve said &quot;Wait until you have your own place.  Then <br/>
invite Kirby over, and when he gets there, say this stuff to him.  Then I <br/>
can&#39;t tell you to stop it.  It will be your house!  But here, you need to <br/>
stop.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or &quot;If you want to hit him, wait until you&#39;re 18 so it&#39;s not my <br/>
responsibility.  When you&#39;re 18, invite him to your apartment and hit him all <br/>
you want to!  I&#39;m not sure he&#39;ll want to visit you then, if you keep acting <br/>
like this, though.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I just say &quot;FIRST, rent your own apartment...&quot; and that&#39;s enough.<br/>
<br/>
It gets them all smiling and commenting on that fantasy future time.   It <br/>
makes it silly, while still treating it as real and making the point that <br/>
it&#39;s not okay to do it where the house is shared.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It&#39;s hard when one child finds pleasure in tormenting another one but <br/>
really <br/>
don&#39;t we all have to learn to get along with people who do things that <br/>
irritate us?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the justification school gives when kids aren&#39;t given the right to get <br/>
away from other kids or teachers who are tormenting them (or irritating, but <br/>
after some amount of time irritation can be torment).<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely think trying different rearrangements of people and different <br/>
ways of taking turns and different ways of helping children understand is the <br/>
way to go.  It&#39;s the way we&#39;ve gone.  Getting a bigger house helped.  The <br/>
kids just getting older and more patient and more understanding helped.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think school is the hell hole some people here do.  And if a child <br/>
goes and hates it he can come home.  If he goes and hates it maybe he&#39;ll even <br/>
change his behavior for the privilege of coming home.  And in my mind, it&#39;s a <br/>
privilege that extremely abusive behavior could lose any of my kids.  But it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be my first (or second or third) response.  It would be an ultimate <br/>
response.  And if a child wanted, liked and did well in school and was there <br/>
of his own choice (a HUGE difference from other school memories many of us <br/>
have), and that provided peace and space for my other children, it might be <br/>
the most mindful solution for that group of kids.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, my kids haven&#39;t wanted school and are really pretty decent with one <br/>
another.  For over a year now, Kirby has allowed and invited Marty to hang <br/>
out with him in all kinds of social situations.  I never thought that would <br/>
happen.   When they were mismatched, because Kirby was dexterous and Marty <br/>
wasn&#39;t, or Kirby was pubescent and Marty wasn&#39;t, or whatever, Kirby would say <br/>
&quot;no, Marty&quot; so much I thought Marty&#39;s heart would break.  But once Marty was <br/>
well into puberty, for some reason(s) I don&#39;t really understand, Kirby <br/>
welcomed him into his group, and now there are not separate groups at all.  <br/>
If someone calls to do something with one of them and he&#39;s gone, they&#39;ll take <br/>
the other.  Or there will be flowing groups of kids here on Sundays, coming <br/>
and going in sub-groups, everyone just as accepting of Marty as of Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
Some of this is luck.  Some of it is the result of years of negotiation, <br/>
kindness, generosity, patience and understanding.  I&#39;m grateful for it, <br/>
whatever all it is.<br/>
