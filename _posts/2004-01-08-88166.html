<div id="ygrps-yiv-692750757">If anyone is in an encouraging mood, I could use some encouraging!! <br/>
 <br/>
Things have been bad since last night. My neighbor had a blind date. The guy said he&#39;d pay for a taxi there and back. She asked me if I could take her out there to save him the money. So I did. Which made us late for church (neighbor&#39;s daughter routinely comes with us). <br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;d asked how late she could call me for a ride home after the date. I asked her to call me by 2300, because normally the kids were settling in for the night by then. At 2130 she called. I said we&#39;d be on our way in half an hour, since the kids had JUST poured bowls of cereal to eat as they&#39;d not eaten much at the fellowship dinner before church. <br/>
 <br/>
We had just left to go get her at 2200 when she called and said don&#39;t worry about it, she&#39;d gotten a ride home. <br/>
 <br/>
I THOUGHT she was on her way. By midnight, the kids were finally asleep. At 0045 she FINALLY calls to say she&#39;s home, but since it&#39;s freezing cold out she&#39;ll come get her daughter in the morning. <br/>
 <br/>
I told her I&#39;d leave the back door unlocked so she could just come on in, we&#39;d still be sleeping at the time she&#39;d need to come get her daughter so she could get ready to catch the school bus. <br/>
 <br/>
Sometime just after 0700, I become aware that the phone is ringing. I don&#39;t get to it in time, so I just bring it into my room with me. At 0800 it rings again. My neighbor. Upset because I didn&#39;t bring her child home and the bus was due shortly. I said come on over and get her, everyone&#39;s still asleep. She said she&#39;d miss the bus, I said so let her stay home (she lets her child stay home for no reason at all most of the time anyway!) and she says &quot;My child isn&#39;t like your kids, she HAS to go to school and whenever she&#39;s late or anything they look at ME like there&#39;s something wrong with me for not getting her to school.&quot; I said, Fine. Bring her clothes over, watch my children (who are all SLEEPING) and I&#39;ll drive her to school. She says &quot;No, just wake her up and have her run home, she has to catch the bus.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not the one staying up til one am yet it&#39;s MY fault her child might miss the bus?! I drive her halfway across Cape Cod for this date and she can&#39;t watch my children for ten minutes so I can take HER daughter to school?! <br/>
 <br/>
ARGGG!!! So that&#39;s just this morning. I get up, get the house all picked up for the social worker&#39;s visit that was scheduled for noon. I&#39;m not dressed yet. She arrives at 1130. More pressure to put Logan in Head Start, and she&#39;ll look into part-time daycare for Megan so I can get a break and what about that parent-aide coming in? <br/>
 <br/>
She leaves, we have lunch, and I head to the bathroom with diahrrea. I come out to find Sarah sitting on the table with the baby, Megan at the bottom of the basement stairs crying, and Logan using the last of my dishsoap after pouring out half the bottle so he can &quot;wash the dishes&quot; for me from lunch. <br/>
 <br/>
I go into the living room and find that the box of math manipulatives has been dumped out and the pieces thrown around the room. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m about ready to throw in the dang towel! I&#39;m exhausted and I WANT A SHOWER! By the time I knew my neighbor wasn&#39;t going to be here I&#39;d already fallen asleep on the recliner while waiting for her. Megan was already awake this morning when I got up so no chance for a shower. <br/>
 <br/>
The only child who naps is Gracie, so no chance for a nap there...<br/>
 <br/>
GRR the neighbor just came in..gotta go...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why not?!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235194471">Olga,<br/>
 <br/>
The social worker comes by because last summer, while pregnant with Gracie, my son Logan took to sneaking out of the house (which was easy because there was a broken lock on one of the screen doors - one that we&#39;d requested to be repaired by military housing a month prior to this! We didn&#39;t have air conditioning until the beginning of August). He&#39;d snuck out once following my oldest child to a friend&#39;s house. She turned around and saw him as went around the corner, and she brought him home. My neighbor saw it. Logan knew that if Mommy was on the potty, he could sneak out and have a couple minutes before I&#39;d come get him because I&#39;d be &quot;stuck&quot; until I could finish my business. A couple times, he&#39;d also let Megan (2) out with him. <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t like taking them out during the heat of the day, we&#39;d go out in the morning or late afternoon. But typical boy, he wanted to live outside. He&#39;s only three, so he can&#39;t be outside &quot;unsupervised.&quot; (we weren&#39;t unschoolers then by the way).<br/>
 <br/>
My next door neighbor and I don&#39;t get along, and she called DSS. Because I&#39;d left the kids in the car once while I ran into the commissary (literally only in there for three minutes, timed myself on my watch) DSS considers me to have a &quot;history&quot; of &quot;neglect.&quot; There was also a call by the school system for &quot;educational and mental health neglect&quot; from when Sarah was in Kindergarten. Long story short, she was on medication for ADHD. We wanted her off of it, the school said neglect if we took her off without her psych&#39;s permission. They also insisted that she also had OCD, ODD, and Asperger&#39;s. They wanted her tested but we said no. These conditions only manifested while she was on the medications. She couldn&#39;t eat and couldn&#39;t sleep, and was becoming very aggressive. When we refused the testing and took her off the medications anyway, they called DSS. DSS backed them up. The school year ended during the assessment period, we immediately filed to homeschool the following year. But DSS<br/>
 insisted that we have the testing done, and continue her IEP with the school for her speech therapy unless/until we find another source.<br/>
 <br/>
SO that in a nutshell is why I have a social worker coming by once a month. Probably for the next 15 months until our next transfer, although possibly they&#39;ll close it out in another couple months. It will depend on this worker. SIGH....!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I encourage you to learn to say &quot;No,&quot; Elizabeth. You have your hands <br/>
full - nobody should be asking you to go out at night or get up early <br/>
in the morning. You can&#39;t really be there for your kids - not fully <br/>
&quot;be&quot; there for them - if you&#39;re tired and grumpy and need a shower and <br/>
all that. You&#39;re shortchanging your own kids to help an adult person <br/>
who doesn&#39;t even appreciate it (because people that would impose on <br/>
someone like you NEVER appreciate what you do for them). I&#39;m not sure <br/>
how old you are - I hate to admit how old I was before I learned to say <br/>
no and choose to help people only when I&#39;m doing it from a gracious <br/>
generous place in my heart and NEVER when I&#39;m feeling resentful. I <br/>
still do plenty of generous helpful things, I think anyway &lt;G&gt;. But I <br/>
simply never ever do them when I&#39;m resenting it. That leaves me doing <br/>
the things I feel good about doing - and those are the things that are <br/>
REALLY helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is helpful - I&#39;m serious about thinking about what you owe <br/>
your OWN children - not a grumpy resentful needs-a-shower mommy!!! This <br/>
is something all homeschooling parents have to think about - that their <br/>
own state of mind impacts their children a lot more than those parents <br/>
whose kids go off to school. Unschooling parents have to be even more <br/>
&quot;with it&quot; since we can&#39;t just hand our kids their worksheets and tell <br/>
them to get to work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-638299523">Pam, <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m 28...this is the first time in my life I&#39;ve ever run into someone like this person, and yes, it has left me totally drained and grumpy and resentful. Paul and I have been talking and tomorrow he is going to tell her that that latest either of us will take her anywhere is going to be 8 pm with at least half an hour&#39;s notice (quite often things have been last minute). He&#39;s been feeling the same about the whole situation. 2300 for her to come and pick up her child if she&#39;s gone out, and going out means her date provides her ride. No more of the 0100 (or later!!). We will watch her child because we want that child to be safe, but that&#39;s it. <br/>
 <br/>
SIGH....yes, I&#39;ve let this person interfere with how things should be with my kids. In that regard, I suppose you could say that I have been a failure as a mom. :-(   <br/>
 <br/>
 And no, we&#39;re not getting ANYTHING in return from her other than that she did allow us to dry clothes at her place, which we did our best to not do more than a couple loads a week at her place. When I&#39;ve REALLY needed help, she&#39;d say no, especially if it meant watching any of my children. She did that once for an hour and decided my kids were &quot;undisciplined brats.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
This lady is bringing out the worst in me, and I don&#39;t like it. I did tell her no earlier today, when she wanted to just run up to the corner store (about a mile and a half and a couple corners away really...so I&#39;m saying corner meaning the main corner of that end of town) for cigarettes. I sold her one of Paul&#39;s packs instead. It&#39;s easier than having to get all four children bundled up and into a van that doesn&#39;t heat up when idling! <br/>
 <br/>
Tomorrow I&#39;m planning on actually attending the parenting class at a local church that I&#39;d signed up for and hardly attended in Nov/Dec between the holidays, migraines, and &quot;helping&quot; this neighbor. It&#39;s earlier in the day than I&#39;d like, but there is child-care and the opportunity to sit and relax! By the time we&#39;d get home it&#39;d be nearly noon..then it&#39;d be time to meet up with some people from our local homeschooling group at the library. So I can manage to be gone most of the day. I hate having to avoid someone, but it looks like I might need to in order to help me to say &quot;No&quot; to her! <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, thanks Pam for that encouragement..I needed to hear that as well!<br/>

visits.  I am also very familiar with the power they have.  If I felt that I<br/>
was making a bad impression on one, I would lose any outside<br/>
responsibilities (read that selfish &quot;friends&quot; and anything else outside the<br/>

the towel<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If anyone is in an encouraging mood, I could use some encouraging!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Things have been bad since last night. My neighbor had a blind date. The<br/>
guy said he&#39;d pay for a taxi there and back. She asked me if I could take<br/>
her out there to save him the money. So I did. Which made us late for church<br/>
(neighbor&#39;s daughter routinely comes with us).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She&#39;d asked how late she could call me for a ride home after the date. I<br/>
asked her to call me by 2300, because normally the kids were settling in for<br/>
the night by then. At 2130 she called. I said we&#39;d be on our way in half an<br/>
hour, since the kids had JUST poured bowls of cereal to eat as they&#39;d not<br/>
eaten much at the fellowship dinner before church.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We had just left to go get her at 2200 when she called and said don&#39;t<br/>
worry about it, she&#39;d gotten a ride home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I THOUGHT she was on her way. By midnight, the kids were finally asleep.<br/>
At 0045 she FINALLY calls to say she&#39;s home, but since it&#39;s freezing cold<br/>
out she&#39;ll come get her daughter in the morning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I told her I&#39;d leave the back door unlocked so she could just come on in,<br/>
we&#39;d still be sleeping at the time she&#39;d need to come get her daughter so<br/>
she could get ready to catch the school bus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometime just after 0700, I become aware that the phone is ringing. I<br/>
don&#39;t get to it in time, so I just bring it into my room with me. At 0800 it<br/>
rings again. My neighbor. Upset because I didn&#39;t bring her child home and<br/>
the bus was due shortly. I said come on over and get her, everyone&#39;s still<br/>
asleep. She said she&#39;d miss the bus, I said so let her stay home (she lets<br/>
her child stay home for no reason at all most of the time anyway!) and she<br/>
says &quot;My child isn&#39;t like your kids, she HAS to go to school and whenever<br/>
she&#39;s late or anything they look at ME like there&#39;s something wrong with me<br/>
for not getting her to school.&quot; I said, Fine. Bring her clothes over, watch<br/>
my children (who are all SLEEPING) and I&#39;ll drive her to school. She says<br/>
&quot;No, just wake her up and have her run home, she has to catch the bus.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not the one staying up til one am yet it&#39;s MY fault her child might<br/>
miss the bus?! I drive her halfway across Cape Cod for this date and she<br/>
can&#39;t watch my children for ten minutes so I can take HER daughter to<br/>
school?!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ARGGG!!! So that&#39;s just this morning. I get up, get the house all picked<br/>
up for the social worker&#39;s visit that was scheduled for noon. I&#39;m not<br/>
dressed yet. She arrives at 1130. More pressure to put Logan in Head Start,<br/>
and she&#39;ll look into part-time daycare for Megan so I can get a break and<br/>
what about that parent-aide coming in?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She leaves, we have lunch, and I head to the bathroom with diahrrea. I<br/>
come out to find Sarah sitting on the table with the baby, Megan at the<br/>
bottom of the basement stairs crying, and Logan using the last of my<br/>
dishsoap after pouring out half the bottle so he can &quot;wash the dishes&quot; for<br/>
me from lunch.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I go into the living room and find that the box of math manipulatives has<br/>
been dumped out and the pieces thrown around the room.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m about ready to throw in the dang towel! I&#39;m exhausted and I WANT A<br/>
SHOWER! By the time I knew my neighbor wasn&#39;t going to be here I&#39;d already<br/>
fallen asleep on the recliner while waiting for her. Megan was already awake<br/>
this morning when I got up so no chance for a shower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only child who naps is Gracie, so no chance for a nap there...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why not?!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been following this thread and this quote just jumped at me. <br/>
You&#39;re message came after Pam&#39;s very to the point advice:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I encourage you to learn to say &quot;No,&quot; Elizabeth.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re statement above tells me you have very little experience setting <br/>
boundaries with others. Half an hour&#39;s notice is not at all acceptable <br/>
for people outside of your immediate family, really. Would you <br/>
interrupt your children&#39;s play and/or unschooling moment to drive <br/>
someone just because they dropped in with half an hour&#39;s notice? You&#39;re <br/>
children are very young. That&#39;s not enough time to get them ready to <br/>
come along. That&#39;s just an invitation to wreak havoc in your kids <br/>
world; needless to say yours.<br/>
<br/>
I think you need to re-prioritize and it&#39;s very simple: You have a <br/>
full-time job and it&#39;s called parenting. After the day is done, after <br/>
the plates have been put away and you&#39;ve had time for yourself, then, <br/>
that&#39;s the time for other people.<br/>
<br/>
How do you learn how to say no? By saying it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, I cannot drive you at this time&quot;. Pause and deep breath. Silence <br/>
and let it linger. You&#39;re going to feel awfully uncomfortable with it <br/>
not being used to saying it but, I promise, it gets easier.<br/>
<br/>
I had to learn how to say no to some of my family members. They mistook <br/>
my hospitality and love for them with stupidity. So I learned to say <br/>
no. &quot;Sorry, I really cannot pay for your vacation&quot;. People in my family <br/>
are unexpressed  actors, they really should have hit the boards. As it <br/>
is, they act out psyco-dramas as a way of getting attention. Well, they <br/>
used to because they know now it does not work here anymore. I do not <br/>
say I cannot help them. I am very speific and say what I am not willing <br/>
to do: &quot;No, sorry, I cannot give you $1000&quot;, &quot;No I am not going to drug <br/>
my child so we can go visit with your cat&quot;. I say NO but in a very <br/>
specific, to the point way. With no drama.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Jo Blige&#39;s song, &quot;No More Drama&quot; would come in handy just about <br/>
now :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647592813">MamaBeth,<br/>
<br/>
Just curious...is this neighbor that is driving you<br/>
crazy as her personal taxi service and calling your<br/>
children names the same neighbor that turned you into<br/>
DSS in the first place?  I am not sure I understand<br/>
why she is treating you as her personal servant and<br/>
whipping boy.  Maybe I missed that post somehow.<br/>
<br/>
You are NOT a failure as a mom.  Don&#39;t even talk that<br/>
way.  I know it is hard as a young mother home with<br/>
little children.  I was 23 when I had Sarah, and 25<br/>
when I had Andrew. My husband worked 12-14 hour days,<br/>
not including travel, and came home grumpy and tired<br/>
and didn&#39;t interact with us much.  I was soo lonely.<br/>
<br/>
Personal boundaries and personal space are desperately<br/>
needed for healthy relationships.  Too many times I<br/>
have gotten involved with emotionally needy people who<br/>
started overwhelming me and my family.  I waited too<br/>
long to tell them how I felt, out of a misguided<br/>
notion I needed to serve them somehow or out of<br/>
feeling sorry for them, and then when I did it was<br/>
done with exasperation and I burst out all my pent up<br/>
frustration instead of doing it calmly and in the<br/>
right way.<br/>
<br/>
Let your inner momma-bear take over.  Your children&#39;s<br/>
health and feelings of security are being threatened<br/>
on many fronts.  Some you feel you can&#39;t do anything<br/>
about, but that person is definitely something you CAN<br/>
do something about.<br/>
<br/>
You can solve these situations, Beth.  All of them. <br/>
My friend Shay says to do nothing out of fear, but to<br/>
do it with a sense of purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Did you read Anne O.&#39;s post (through Kelly) earlier? <br/>
The cycle of frustration will end when YOU decide it<br/>
will end.  <br/>
<br/>
Are you homeschooling legally in your state?  Then no<br/>
one can make you put your kids in school, nor head<br/>
start, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Do you need to be doing something positive with the<br/>
one with delayed development?  Then do that, with a<br/>
feeling that you are doing what is right, giving that<br/>
child what she needs most as a good mother should, and<br/>
celebrate that child, just the way she is made,<br/>
instead of grieving for any perceived defect.<br/>
<br/>
Like Aragorn says in ROTK to Gandalf...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What does your heart tell you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Go to a quiet place, a warm bathtub with a few candles<br/>
lit, and close your eyes.  Breathe...and listen to<br/>
your heart.  Then take up your sword, and do what your<br/>
heart tells you.<br/>
<br/>
Susan<br/>
wifetovegman<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I see in your heart the same fear that would take the<br/>
Heart of me.  The day may come, when the courage of<br/>
men fail, when we forsake our friends and break all<br/>
bonds of fellowship.  But it is NOT this day.  This<br/>
day, WE FIGHT!&quot; -- Aragorn, ROTK<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I want to add my support to the ideas in this post. I was surprised that the<br/>
solution to the overly demanding neighbor was a set of rules that would<br/>
enable her to continue imposing on Mamabeth and her family.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a suggestion for when you start saying no - you are not required<br/>
to give her a reason, even if she asks for one. After all, she is not one of<br/>
your children. Just repeat the no, or else she will start to break down<br/>
whatever reasons you give her, or waste a lot of time and create bad energy<br/>
in you by trying to do so. This does not mean you have to be rude. You can<br/>
still say, &quot;Gee, I&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s just not possible&quot; when she says &quot;Why<br/>
not?&quot;. That sounds better than the truth which seems to be &quot;because you are<br/>
a self-centered, ungrateful, wretchedly-demanding, uncongenial cow!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many of us have posted about how friendships have changed or faded away<br/>
because of the life-changing, soul-altering effects of unschooling. I have<br/>
myself. Sometimes it is sad, but possibly not really in this case. <br/>

Your neighbor sounds a lot like mine.  We wanted to be kind and <br/>
helpful, but the more &quot;inches&quot; we gave, the more &quot;miles&quot; she asked <br/>
for.  It was getting so we dreaded hearing the phone ring.  I called <br/>
the education dept. at the local hospital, and they gave me the name <br/>
of a local volunteer agency.  I called there to find out what <br/>
services were available, then typed up the info in large print, <br/>
including taxi phone numbers, etc. and brought it over to the <br/>
neighbor.  The next time she asked if I could take her to the store, <br/>
I said, &quot;No, I can&#39;t.  I have to take care of my family, and that <br/>
takes all of my time.  You can call any of the numbers on the sheet I <br/>
gave you to get other help.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I felt kind of blue about it.  But it is such a relief to have fewer <br/>
phone calls and fewer interruptions, and to not have to listen to her <br/>

Actually, she does have that..our town has a whole booklet they put out with local numbers of helpful organizations and whatnot. But the main part of &quot;helping&quot;  her is mostly giving her rides to places. I will take her to go pick up her child support from her ex, and to the grocery store and other &quot;must do&quot; meetings like to meet with the realtor for the house she&#39;s hoping to rent because her current landlord&#39;s decided to sell the house, but nothing else. <br/>
 <br/>
SIGH...it&#39;s definitely been a toxic relationship and other than these truly helpful things I&#39;m not doing any of it anymore; although I will still watch her child if she&#39;s going to be out because the child needs a safe place to be. But I have told her she MUST be home to pick up her child by 2300, especially if it&#39;s on a school night. <br/>
