I discovered you get a whole lot more results if you just type in the single<br/>
&quot;nun&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t get asked THAT many times. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
I&#39;d say &quot;You know...   that movie...&quot; and if they&#39;d guess I&#39;d act like yeah!  <br/>
 That one!    (But I&#39;d always fess up to being   a generic nun.)<br/>
<br/>
Someone came in and said &quot;Are you Whoopi Goldberg?&quot; and I said &quot;Yes I am.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One girl was dressed as Princess Lea in the gold bikini at Jabba&#39;s place, and <br/>
Holly pointed at her and at me and said &quot;Two Carrie Fishers!&quot; (they were <br/>
looking for pairs and sets, and Carrie Fisher played a nun in Jay and Silent Bob <br/>
Strike Back).<br/>
<br/>
I was agreeable to anyone&#39;s good theory. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There were lots of people; 40 maybe overall.   Everyone was in costume but <br/>
three adults (Keith got back from work really late and was our shopper/gofer for <br/>
outings, and hid out elsetime, and another couple came by after work for a <br/>
while).   The one person who had truly resisted wearing   a costume came as the <br/>
John Belushi character from Animal House, in toga and laurel.   GOOD costume, <br/>
and he wore it all night without self-consciousness.   One set of twins I <br/>
hadn&#39;t met before, tall and 18 or so, were Darth Maul (excellent make-up--looked <br/>
like he had shaved his head and glued on spikes, but it was a bald wig/spike <br/>
head put on really well) and Obi-Wan (the middle-aged Obi-Wan, not the young or <br/>
old one &lt;g&gt;).   Good way to be a set without looking at ALL alike.<br/>
<br/>
Some photos are linked from the Kirby page and there will be more later.<br/>

I got tired of messing with them, but there will be more.   There&#39;s only one <br/>
of me, and it&#39;s Very Bad.   Maybe...<br/>
