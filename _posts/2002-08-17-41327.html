<div id="ygrps-yiv-257482036">Well, I guess I better clarify myself.  And thanks for all of the <br/>
suggestions re: getting cheap paper.  We do have tons of typing paper <br/>
and leftover computer paper.  I come from a teaching family (I&#39;m the <br/>
first girl to not only graduate college w/out a teaching degree, but <br/>
than choose to homeschool) Try picturing how well that sits.<br/>
Anyways, we get lots of leftovers from their classrooms.  I think <br/>
they use the drop ins as a opportunity to see what we&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
What I meant by wasting was drawing an itty  bitty lady bug and <br/>
getting a new sheet.  I just prefer that they realize paper does cost <br/>
us in trees and use the other side also.  I don&#39;t care if they get <br/>
frustrated and crumple it up or throw it away.  But utilize the whole <br/>
space, unless of course they are making a book or magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that for some of you this might be nitpicking but in the <br/>
past year I have seen 5 forests timbered near us just for profit. Not <br/>
for ill trees.  These are areas where nothing new has been planted <br/>
and the land isn&#39;t for sale.  Just harvested.  It makes me sick.<br/>

It&#39;s always alot and if I come during a peticular season the papers are <br/>

I also have seen (heard, it&#39;s so loud!) timbering for profit. It raped the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just have to say something about this.  Like many here BC, I believe that <br/>
the logging companies need to do some things *very* differently than they <br/>
have been.  I don&#39;t believe that clear-cutting is the right way to harvest <br/>
lumber, for instance.  But I have to wonder about this idea that logging <br/>
shouldn&#39;t ever be done for profit.  Maybe that&#39;s not what you and Tina <br/>
meant, but unless your house is made of something other than wood, and you <br/>
use no paper at all . . .<br/>

Where we live we are required to recycle.  We have several bins that <br/>
we set out with the trash each week.  The bins are given to you by <br/>
the city and are color coded for different trucks to pick up.<br/>
My big beef is they won&#39;t recycle styrofoam.  <br/>

You know I don&#39;t honestly know.  I believe in the concept of <br/>
recycling so I haven&#39;t tried to not do it.  I imagine you would get <br/>
notices or maybe your city garbage bill would increase to take care <br/>
of the &quot;extras&quot;.  We are asked to wash out our jars, cans, plastic <br/>
containers before we put them in the bin.  This I defintely agree <br/>
with also because how gross it must be for those who deal with it to <br/>
have leftover junk in the jars.<br/>
<br/>
I think they know if you recycle or not b/c you have color coded bins <br/>
to place outside.  It wouldn&#39;t take that long to make notations about <br/>
who puts out bins and who doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
We also are supposed to put our grass clippings and tree branches <br/>
(yard waste) in brown bags. (special ones mind you).  These are taken <br/>
to a mulching company outside of town.  Leaves are swept to the <br/>
street and picked up by a vacuuming truck.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t noticed any one in our addition not adhering to these rules.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213227687">I was just curious.  I&#39;ve never heard of mandatory recycling.  I envy <br/>
you with curbside recycling.  We drive at least 20 minutes to the <br/>
nearest recycling drop off, and when that&#39;s full we have to drive 15 <br/>
minutes farther.  We usually just take the recycling along with us on <br/>
our homeopathy appointments, which is a 50 minute drive but the bins <br/>
are huge and never overflowing.  Actually there is curbside recycling <br/>
here but I think it&#39;s only clear glass and metal cans--so for us it&#39;s <br/>
not worth the bother of trying to remember to put it out when they <br/>
don&#39;t take it all anyway.  Easier to just load it up and take it <br/>
ourselves once or twice a month.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Where we live we are required to recycle.  We have several bins <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; we set out with the trash each week.  The bins are given to you <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; the city and are color coded for different trucks to pick up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My big beef is they won&#39;t recycle styrofoam.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Dear Tina, I was waiting but didn&#39;t see a post for what I <br/>
do <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get paper.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   go to the print shop and ask to have some of what they are <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; throwing away. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   It&#39;s always alot and if I come during a peticular season <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; papers are <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   colored accordingly.  The scraps they have are nice weird <br/>
&gt; sizes <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for little <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   hands and they are heavy weight.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   I also have seen (heard, it&#39;s so loud!) timbering for <br/>
profit. <br/>
&gt; &gt; It <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; raped the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   soil.  DeWes<br/>

&lt;&lt; What I meant by wasting was drawing an itty  bitty lady bug and <br/>
getting a new sheet. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then you pick up the itty bitty lady bug paper and cut it into strips for <br/>
grocery lists, or use it for your own scrap paper later.<br/>
<br/>
The thing with art is that maybe the big white space was all that made the <br/>
lady bug itty bitty.  Silence is part of music.  Requiring an artist to fill <br/>
up all the space is dictating how art should be.<br/>
<br/>
If a child has five ounces of sculpy and wants to make a one-ounce sculpture <br/>
is that wasting sculpy?<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a philosophical and artistic consideration that guilt about <br/>
forests is messing with in a bad way.<br/>
<br/>
Paper can be used as coasters on wood furniture, and things with drawings can <br/>
be saved and used for paintings later, or put under glue projects, or <br/>
otherwise reused.<br/>
<br/>
Trees are more renewable than a child&#39;s self-esteem and artistic joy are.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The space between. We try to use that concept when decorating or creating <br/>
spaces for things in our home. It&#39;s a very conscious part of art in Japan.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Casey made a craft in a class last week that would be perfect for those <br/>
little ladybugs. They used those clear glass &quot;stones&quot; that you get in the <br/>
floral dept. of craft stores. (Sometimes people put them in the botton of <br/>
vases to hold up artificial flowers.) Anyway, they glued little pictures on <br/>
paper and then used white glue to stick them under the clear stones. The <br/>
glue dries clear and the stones magnify the tiny little picture. They glued <br/>
magnets on and ta-da! we have new fridge magnets.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Trees are more renewable than a child&#39;s self-esteem and artistic joy <br/>
&gt;&gt;are.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not that anyone who thinks about not wasting paper is out to suck their <br/>
child&#39;s self-esteem or artistic joy. But it&#39;s good to rethink some strongly <br/>
held notions in a slightly altered unschooling light.<br/>
