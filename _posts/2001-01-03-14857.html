&lt;&lt; Anybody had this happen to them??  Ideas??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have.  Express the milk and wait.  If you don&#39;t need to save the milk, just <br/>
take a hot shower and spray it out on the wall and feel better.  Whether he&#39;s <br/>
weaning or not, it will make YOU feel better.<br/>
<br/>
My experience is that getting over being sick is different for each person <br/>
and incident, and letting him go with his own instinct about what&#39;s good to <br/>
eat and what isn&#39;t is the best thing.  Maybe he&#39;s got gunk in his throat and <br/>
needs non-dairy/acidic stuff like juice until he&#39;s better.<br/>
<br/>
The other suggestions remind me of something.   If you express and save and <br/>
refrigerate it, he might want to drink it.  Again, it might feel better on <br/>
his throat.<br/>
<br/>
Sick doesn&#39;t count as a nursing strike, in my opinion (and that term seems so <br/>
hostile and personal, anyway &lt;bwg&gt;).  Sick is just sick, and it needs to <br/>
pass.  But kids can go back to nursing after time passes, truly.  <br/>
