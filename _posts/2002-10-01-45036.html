Probably because instead of helping parents keep children from being <br/>
frustrated and lashing out, we call the children&#39;s response a disease, <br/>
medicate the, and tell the parents to carry on as usual.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993390061">Okay I went and found a web site on this. I&#39;m not trying to be a smart ass <br/>
here but I never heard of this thing before. And the site listed 9 <br/>
characteristics. Well my oldest, when she was 11 and 12, showed 8 of the 9. <br/>
Is this disorder real or just a kid who needs to find another way to handle <br/>
himself and parents who need to do that too.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, we did get my daughter counseling and she was briefly on Celexa and is <br/>
fine now and off meds and counseling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777364075">When I first starting working at the local mental health clinic many moons<br/>
ago, the prevalent thought was that kids with ODD were simply young<br/>
Antisocial Personality Disorder (think convict).  I had two kids that I<br/>
remember distinctly with that diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
One was 11.  His mom brought him to see me and he would clam up, refuse to<br/>
do anything that might be viewed as cooperation.  So they quit coming.  2<br/>
years later, he started just showing up at the clinic to see me, waiting<br/>
outside my office in case I might have a few minutes to talk.  Of course, he<br/>
was skipping school to do it but he was trying to make a connection with me.<br/>
<br/>
One was 8.  He was a brawler, a fire starter, a thief.  He never missed a<br/>
session, asked to come extra.  I had to take a leave for some surgery.  I<br/>
woke up in the hospital to find this young man in my hospital room<br/>
(relatively small town with only one hospital).  He had skipped school,<br/>
walked to the hospital and stolen flowers out of a cemetery to give to me.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you see as signs of ODD in a newborn or infant?<br/>
<br/>
I think there are definitely some babies who are more difficult to care<br/>
for. Some are less cuddly than others, some are more sensitive to stress.<br/>
Some are very erratic in their habits, or very active, or more intense in<br/>
their reactions, or slower to adjust to changes or to warm up to new<br/>
people and places. When my daughter was a baby, she had some of these<br/>
traits, and people did tend to pathologize her behaviors - calling her<br/>
&quot;spirited&quot; and &quot;high-need&quot; before she was even a year old. I did read<br/>
some books and find them helpful (&quot;The Explosive Child&quot; really made me<br/>
feel better when she was 5 or 6) but labeling her never helped. What did<br/>
help was to adjust to her difficulties, to stay on her side, to be honest<br/>
with her....<br/>
<br/>
I worked with adults and kids who had emotional and mental health<br/>
problems for quite a few years. Before being a teacher of kids with<br/>
emotional &quot;disorders&quot;, I worked at a drop in center for people with<br/>
serious mental illnesses, on the grounds of the state hospital. The only<br/>
thing I ever did that helped anyone was to talk with them, to have<br/>
compassion, and to be on their side. The school system especially was<br/>
about control - with regular kids they get sneaky, with my kids they<br/>
fight back as hard as they can, and they fight dirty. But once we got to<br/>
know each other, I could pretty much ask them to do anything in their<br/>
power and they would do it.<br/>
<br/>
One day I was working at the drop-in center, and we were having a<br/>
Valentine&#39;s day party and cookout. The other person who was supposed to<br/>
be working with me died in his sleep the night before - he was in his<br/>
forties and seemingly healthy, it was totally unexpected. I ended up<br/>
working by myself that day, me and 45 people who were either residents of<br/>
the state hospital or in the system and diagnosed with a serious mental<br/>
illness. One woman showed up high as a kite, and some of the things she<br/>
said made us think she&#39;d taken an overdose. She was terrified, too... so<br/>
I ended up putting her in my car and driving her to county crisis,<br/>
leaving a large schizophrenic homeless guy who rarely said two words in<br/>
charge of the grill. I was gone maybe an hour... and when I got back<br/>
there were burgers made, one of the women was making coffee, everyone was<br/>
having a good time. Everyone had been concerned about the woman and<br/>
wanted me to go, and they said they could handle things, and I believed<br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
In my class, I had a 5th grader whose family was known for drug dealing<br/>
and manufacturing, being in and out of jail, wild parties... he had been<br/>
in trouble for fighting and &quot;acting out&quot; since kindergarten. He was truly<br/>
my right-hand man, more help than my horrid aide. He noticed when the 3rd<br/>
graders were struggling and would ask if they could come work at his desk<br/>
with him. He noticed when my student with sickle cell was needing a<br/>
transfusion, when she was having trouble concentrating. All I did was<br/>
treat him with respect.<br/>
<br/>
There was one sub who loved my room. Most would come in and feel<br/>
intimidated, and try to have a &quot;firm hand&quot; and take control... which<br/>
usually backfired, although after I&#39;d had the kids for a while they at<br/>
least tried. But usually we got the same guy. No one thought he&#39;d make a<br/>
good sub for my kids, because he was skinny and old  and walked slowly<br/>
and no way could he restain a kid who decided to throw chairs or<br/>
something... but he talked to the kids like real people, told them<br/>
stories about fighting in WW II, read to them, showed them how to paint.<br/>
It was wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t all perfect - kids did lose it, so did the adults I worked<br/>
with. But we&#39;d get past it, we didn&#39;t dwell on it, and things got<br/>
better...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078903826">I had never heard of ODD until about 3/4 months ago when an online friend of mine had her son diagnosed with it. We&#39;d often compared stories, and our sons are almost the same age and it&#39;s scary how alike they act. We both practice attachment parenting, and believed that we would have secure, loving, happy children - only to have those hopes dashed to bits with our sons. Here is one list (the most accurate one I&#39;ve found) that I used to help figure out what was going on with my son:<br/>
<br/>
Infancy (0 to 18 months) <br/>
<br/>
  a.. Irregularities in sleeping and eating patterns <br/>
  b.. High activity level <br/>
  c.. Low tolerance of stimulation and physical affection <br/>
  d.. May be colicky, fussy and/or irritable <br/>
  e.. Difficult to calm or soothe <br/>
  f.. Difficult to hold due to restlessness and overactivity <br/>
  g.. Does not show a preference for being held or cuddled <br/>
Toddler (18 months to 3 years) <br/>
  a.. Short attention span <br/>
  b.. Impulsivity <br/>
  c.. Restlessness and overactivity <br/>
  d.. More difficult to manage than other children of the same age <br/>
  e.. Perceived by caretakers as rebellious or non-compliant <br/>
Preschool (3 to 6 years) <br/>
  a.. Low patience level <br/>
  b.. Displays aggression <br/>
  c.. Increasing difficulties with peer relationships <br/>
  d.. Gradually become more openly defiant towards adults <br/>
Elementary (6-11 years) <br/>
  a.. Behaviors may continue across home, school, and community settings. <br/>
  b.. Beginning academic problems. <br/>
  c.. Impulsivity and motor restlessness. <br/>
  d.. Variety of disruptive and aggressive behavioral difficulties. <br/>
My son displayed every one of these points at the appropriate age. As a baby over the age of 4mths, he would not let me hold him unless I was carrying him somewhere he wanted to go. He would scream until I put him down. He wanted nothing to do with hugs or kisses when hurt or upset, and the only way to calm him would be a car ride. He never got on any kind of an eating or napping schedule - it just went with his moods. From the time he was 2mths until he was potty trained, he would get mad if he had to have is diaper changed or clothes put on or off - he would scream, hold his breath, kick and hit. As a two year old, I could not leave him with anyone because he would hit, kick, and refuse to listen to them. I had to be sure and have enough activities to keep him busy at all times if I wanted him to be at all pleasant to be around. About the time he turned three, he would hit and kick whatever was near when he could not have what he wanted - he still does this, goes into his room and just whallops his bed, dresser, toys, whatever. He did not have the ability to wait patiently for anything, and still does not most days. He started being actively agressive towards his brother and DH when he was 4 - he would growl and ball his fists up, used any excuse to hit his brother and hurt the cats, anything, no matter how much he wanted and liked it, got broken/destroyed at some point or another. He lies for no reason (I didn&#39;t paint that yellow, I painted it red! I don&#39;t have any clean clothes in my closet. Nana told me I couldn&#39;t go to her house today.), he steals things - started with taking food off other&#39;s plates when they weren&#39;t looking and sneaking into my change jar in my bathroom, went to trying to take other children&#39;s toys and even clothes, and he has tried taking a few things from stores. Ugh, and so much more! <br/>
<br/>
The ODD info has given me a whole new world of ideas to try! A lot of them I was already doing, but a few new ones have really helped us.<br/>

<h4>Kimber</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129334046">&lt;&lt;&lt;I had never heard of ODD until about 3/4 months ago when an online friend of mine had her son diagnosed with it. We&#39;d often compared stories, and our sons are almost the same age and it&#39;s scary how alike they act. We both practice attachment parenting, and believed that we would have secure, loving, happy children - only to have those hopes dashed to bits with our sons. Here is one list (the most accurate one I&#39;ve found) that I used to help figure out what was going on with my son:<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Infancy (0 to 18 months) <br/>
  a.. Irregularities in sleeping and eating patterns <br/>
  b.. High activity level <br/>
  c.. Low tolerance of stimulation and physical affection <br/>
  d.. May be colicky, fussy and/or irritable <br/>
  e.. Difficult to calm or soothe <br/>
  f.. Difficult to hold due to restlessness and overactivity <br/>
  g.. Does not show a preference for being held or cuddled &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****My son did have these signs/symptoms at that age.........<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Toddler (18 months to 3 years) <br/>
  a.. Short attention span <br/>
  b.. Impulsivity <br/>
  c.. Restlessness and overactivity <br/>
  d.. More difficult to manage than other children of the same age <br/>
  e.. Perceived by caretakers as rebellious or non-compliant &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***My son had these as well.............<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Preschool (3 to 6 years) <br/>
  a.. Low patience level <br/>
  b.. Displays aggression <br/>
  c.. Increasing difficulties with peer relationships <br/>
  d.. Gradually become more openly defiant towards adults&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***My son had these &#39;symptoms&#39; during kindergarten and we were advised by his kindergarten teacher to have him tested.  We did and he was diagnosed with ADHD and ODD.  They strongly recommended medicating him but we pulled him out of school instead.  I just could not believe that my child was &#39;not right&#39;......he just seemed (to me) to behave like a 5 y/o little boy.  ??<br/>
Anyway, we kept him home for a year and he seemed to really mature and calm down some so he was able to handle the school situation.  In fact, he was wanting to go back to school.  I had to go back to work, so homeschooling wasn&#39;t an option at that time.  He did fine for the second half of 1st grade, all of 2nd grade, and some of 3rd.  By semester of 3rd grade, the problems really started again with the school system.  He seemed so depressed so we took him to counseling to see if that might help.  (My brother was murdered when my son was 3 1/2 and I think it had a large impact on him besides all of the family hx of depression/bipolar disorders).  She recommended medicating him for depression and we went to the psychiatrist for a scrip...... What a joke.  (Can you hear the bitterness in my typing??)  We spent about 5 minutes with him and he told us to try this medication and Alex would be like a different child in about a week.   That&#39;s it.  No warnings about what to watch for, nothing.  We had fought so hard against medication we he was 5 and now I thought that we had tried just about everything else so this wouldn&#39;t be too bad of an idea, would it??  Well, he did change almost overnight.  He seemed happier that he had ever been, slept about 5-6 hours a night, he quit eating so much (comfort eating--he is chubby so for us, less of an appetite was kind of a good thing), he played outside much more--very active, then the real problems started................. He ended up stealing a cd-rom from the school bookfair and threatened a child (he offered to kill her and chop her head off if she wouldn&#39;t leave him alone).  This was not my child!!  We promptly discontinued the meds. and he was back to &#39;normal&#39;.   What a scary time.  He was never in trouble at school before and I think this was just another blow to his already fragile self esteem.  <br/>
<br/>
My whole point in this long drama is that we tried to follow their rules about how to help my child instead of listening to my heart (as we know now is the best policy).  My son is now 9 1/2 and we have been totally unschooling for the past 4 months.  He is much more confident in his self, he is respectful toward others, he has overcome the anger problems he had when he was 5-6, he is very compassionate, and he now even enjoys the morning snuggle time.  He was one of those babies that hated to be held.  I have often wondered if it was because he developed pneumonia at birth and was in PICU for a week before he could be held.  I asked one of the counselors that and she denied that that could be a factor.  ???<br/>
<br/>
He has recently decided he wanted a mohawk so I got out my trusty clippers and gave him a new hairdo.   This child has blossomed away from the criticism of his school system friends.   No medication needed here.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Elementary (6-11 years) <br/>
  a.. Behaviors may continue across home, school, and community settings. <br/>
  b.. Beginning academic problems. <br/>
  c.. Impulsivity and motor restlessness. <br/>
  d.. Variety of disruptive and aggressive behavioral difficulties.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The counselor we took him to said that it was obvious that Alex did not have ADHD nor ODD that had been previously diagnosed.  I think that the criteria is too vague and subject to interpretation by the examiner for both of these &#39;disorders&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to share my son&#39;s story to hopefully help other to see that the &#39;experts&#39; aren&#39;t always right.  In fact, in my experience with many different doctors, psychiatrists, and counselors, they have only made things worse for our family.  I realize that not all of these professionals are as incompetent as the ones I have dealt with, so this is not a general statement, but a personal experience.  I have found that patience, compassion, love, and understanding have worked best for us.  <br/>

I had never heard of this either,  thought it was ADD,  and I feel like I&#39;m pretty well read on things too, but not that one!  I&#39;ll have to go read the web site,  I&#39;m wondering if it will help me draw conclusions about some med questions.  Like, would a couple of counseling sessions get me off meds? Kind-of like your daughter?<br/>

Is this disorder real or just a kid who needs to find another way to handle <br/>
himself and parents who need to do that too.<br/>

BTW, we did get my daughter counseling and she was briefly on Celexa and is <br/>
fine now and off meds and counseling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157199874">Ugh, I can&#39;t even imagine what my son would be like if he had to deal with school, and all the rules and punishments some families use. I&#39;m so glad I never went to any of the &quot;professionals&quot; or even looked into medication. I, too, thought he was just being a normal little boy until my second son came, and I started baby-sitting the neighbor&#39;s two sons. Several people have tried telling me he has ADHD too, but he does not have even one of those symptoms, thank goodness. <br/>

are used to decribe the more extreme ends of the bahavioural <br/>
spectrum.<br/>
My first child cried constantly from birth. She would sleep in 20 min <br/>
burts and then cry for 10 hours whatever I did. She didn&#39;t sleep the <br/>
night until she was 3 (I had 2 others by then) but would wake 5 or 6 <br/>
times a night. She had night terrors, would attack anything within <br/>
range, Destroyed her bedroom on several occasions. It was hard.<br/>
But, she walked unsupported at 6 months, was talking non-stop by <br/>
a year, taught herself to read at 3 and still only needs 5 hours <br/>
sleep a nigt.<br/>
A doctor would probably label her hyperactive and want to drug her. <br/>
She had trouble in school as she was so bored and impatient and <br/>
would answer questions before the rest of the class. The teacher <br/>
was constantly telling her to be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Sher&#39;s 10 now and is still filled with energy and is very emotional <br/>
but I wouldn&#39;t give her a label. She is herself and will be one of <br/>
those hyper people her entire life.<br/>
It&#39;s tough sometimes because she is always on the go and always <br/>
talking and wanting to know things but I wouldn&#39;t never change her :-<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you see as signs of ODD in a newborn or infant?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think there are definitely some babies who are more difficult to care<br/>
&gt; for. Some are less cuddly than others, some are more sensitive to stress.<br/>
&gt; Some are very erratic in their habits, or very active, or more intense in<br/>
&gt; their reactions, or slower to adjust to changes or to warm up to new<br/>
&gt; people and places. When my daughter was a baby, she had some of these<br/>
&gt; traits, and people did tend to pathologize her behaviors - calling her<br/>
&gt; &quot;spirited&quot; and &quot;high-need&quot; before she was even a year old. I did read<br/>
&gt; some books and find them helpful (&quot;The Explosive Child&quot; really made me<br/>
&gt; feel better when she was 5 or 6) but labeling her never helped. What did<br/>
&gt; help was to adjust to her difficulties, to stay on her side, to be honest<br/>
&gt; with her....<br/>

about her (Nancy&#39;s life not her Mom&#39;s life. &lt;g&gt;) But (me playing doctor here) <br/>
I have come to think Nancy might have had ODD. She was difficult from birth. <br/>
She had to have a total blood transfusion (its been a while since I read the <br/>
book so I can&#39;t remember exactly why...) soon after birth, she was a very <br/>
fussy, difficult baby. She didn&#39;t like to be held, when her siblings were <br/>
born she was more than the usual jealous towards them and very abusive at <br/>
such a young age. She had a definite Antisocial personality from the get go. <br/>
I don&#39;t subscribe to labels much, but I do believe she had ODD. And I believe <br/>
it manifested itself at a very young age, in her.<br/>
