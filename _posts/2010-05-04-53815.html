puzzle it out. One is &quot;How the Universe Works&quot; that had Stephen  <br/>
Hawking in it briefly. The first show was about the Big Bang.<br/>
<br/>
The other is Stephen Hawking&#39;s &quot;Into the Universe&quot;. It was only 3  <br/>
episodes long and repeats aren&#39;t scheduled for some reason. There are  <br/>
clips at Discovery:<br/>
<br/>
Hawking show<br/>
<br/>
which might be the whole thing in 3-4 minute segments. (They&#39;ll keep  <br/>
playing with a commercial in between.)<br/>
