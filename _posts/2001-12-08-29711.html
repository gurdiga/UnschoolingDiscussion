<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405393483">Hey, lovemary, this is a real peeve of mine! Is there anything more annoying <br/>
than those adults who stand there dangling whatever it is over the kid&#39;s <br/>
head until the kid remembers to say please?<br/>
<br/>
If I were there, I would cheerfully say, &quot;please, grandma!&quot; for them and <br/>
then walk over and get the item or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, this is how I &quot;teach&quot; manners. When a child demands something <br/>
without saying please, I get it while matter-of-factly repeating their <br/>
demand in a courteous way -- I repeat &quot;Get me some more milk!&quot; as a <br/>
pleasant-sounding, &quot;Mom, can I have some more milk, please?&quot; I never <br/>
withhold the milk till they get it right. What I am trying to do is simply <br/>
model what a polite request sounds like. Often they do ask politely, but not <br/>
always, and sometimes it irks me to be ordered around, even if it&#39;s <br/>
forgetfulness.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I also speak to them courteously. Of late, I have been pleasantly <br/>
surprised by their manners (mine are 9 and 4). Recently, my 9yo was reading <br/>
to me and his brother, and stopped to sneeze.  I said Gesundheit! and he <br/>
said &quot;Thank you!&quot; -- which I automatically say when someone says Gesundheit <br/>
or Bless You to me, but I&#39;d never heard him say it before. And I&#39;d never <br/>
told him to say it.<br/>
<br/>
I think nice manners get a person a long way in the world. And modeling is <br/>
the best way to teach them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Good question Mimi. . . I guess it could be or it could not be. . . it all<br/>
depends on your intention. I dont force those words either, but the<br/>
grandparents make a big deal out of it. . . like not giving them something<br/>
until they say please. Got any ideas on how to handle that one?<br/>

really smart and they&#39;ll sense that you&#39;re correcting them.  I honestly <br/>
think that just showing the good example is enough.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know what you mean.  I really have to bite my lip sometimes.  But you <br/>
know, at this point in time, at age 7, they are quite polite about 50% <br/>
of the time and I&#39;m very happy with that.  They&#39;re still so little and <br/>
they forget sometimes.  I notice it  gets better all the time as they <br/>
get older, so I know we&#39;re moving in the right direction in that <br/>
regard..  I&#39;m quite sure that by the time they are adults they will be <br/>
very well-mannered.<br/>

<br/>
My son models my manners. He shakes hands when he meets someone, kids <br/>
and adults, and he says please and thank you, because I do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that he doesn&#39;t show manners to people he already knows <br/>
that don&#39;t have manners themselves.<br/>
