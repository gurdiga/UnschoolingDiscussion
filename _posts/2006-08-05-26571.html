<div id="ygrps-yiv-127569567">We interrupt your unschooling talk for a brief public announcement:<br/>
<br/>
  Tomorrow is the deadline for hotel reservations at the special <br/>
conference rate of $89/night. The price jumps dramatically on Monday. <br/>
Please double-check to make sure you have made your reservations.<br/>
<br/>
  Registration deadline is this Thursday. It is also the cut-off for <br/>
preordering t-shirts and banquet meals. I cannot guarantee availability <br/>
of either if not ordered by Thursday, August 10th. Any registrations <br/>
made after the 10th will be at the &quot;at the door&quot; rate. Please get your <br/>
registrations in *this* week!<br/>
<br/>
  If you aren&#39;t yet on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:liveandlearnconference@yahoogroups.com">liveandlearnconference@yahoogroups.com</a> e-list, <br/>
this would be a good time to move over there to keep conference <br/>
conversation confined there.<br/>
<br/>
 The schedule should be up soon. I&#39;m almost finished with it!<br/>
<br/>
 Now back to your regularly scheduled unschooling chat....<br/>
