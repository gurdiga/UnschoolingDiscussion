<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104791983">I just want to say that I read _Patchwork of Days_ and I laughed out loud at that &quot;goat milking christians&quot; post because it truly is what most of that book focuses on. I laughed because that&#39;s the exact stereotype of a homeschooler!<br/>
<br/>
I did enjoy the book...mostly because I&#39;m insanely nosy about other peoples&#39; lives.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - not that there&#39;s anything wrong with being a goat-milking Christian...it&#39;s just that&#39;s what everyone assumes *I* am when I say I homeschool/unschool...and it couldn&#39;t be further from my reality! If you want payback, you can call me an irreligious alfalfa muncher!<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for the corroboration.<br/>
I really didn&#39;t want people to think I was being tacky out of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I did enjoy the book...mostly because I&#39;m insanely nosy about other <br/>
peoples&#39; lives.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The instructions that went with that were to choose a day in advance and then <br/>
document it, which I did with all honesty.  <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t &quot;the best&quot; day of the season, and it wasn&#39;t an amalgamation of good <br/>
parts.  I candidly picked and told a day, and there it is forever more.  <br/>
Sigh... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a follow-up volume now, called _Homeschool Open House_.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not my favorite kind of book, personally.  I recommend it to people who <br/>
don&#39;t believe there really are very structured families, and I recommend it <br/>
to those who want to read everything that had been published on <br/>
homeschooling, but it&#39;s not a great source for someone who knows unschooling <br/>
is the goal and wants to read two or three books to fortify their resolve.<br/>

When I read it, I definitely appreciated your honesty.  I don&#39;t want to accuse<br/>
anyone else of dishonesty, BUT it did strike me that the nearly all of the rest<br/>
of the days in the book were markedly above average.  It seems likely that not<br/>
all of those days were selected at random and left to run their course utterly<br/>
unselfconsiously.  They can&#39;t all live in Lake Wobegon, can they?<br/>
