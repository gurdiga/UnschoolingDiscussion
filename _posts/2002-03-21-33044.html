<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270715650">I am confused.  If you unschool, you take school out and is left with<br/>
learning.  But with Unparenting,if you take parent out ,what are you left<br/>
with?<br/>
May be my problem is that I find it difficult to understand how anyone would<br/>
want less parenting?  My generation was shoved into day-care, then<br/>
pre-school, then school... My father died mostly a stranger to us. And we<br/>
are stranger to my mother mostly too. We are fortunate that we can live very<br/>
differently. We live WITH our children. We are not some mythical person,<br/>
some days on pedestal others in the gutter. We know each others humanity.<br/>
Parenting is what comes after the chicken and the egg thing.  It&#39;s not a one<br/>
way relationship.  Rather looks like a very beautiful circle.<br/>
Sorry about the ranting. In some ways one could say that my childhood was<br/>
abused, robbed of a natural relationship with adults around me. But<br/>
reversing the flow of a linear thinking make no sense either. We need to<br/>
bridge the gap, close the circle.<br/>
Who knows may be in time our society could learn to close other circle, and<br/>
return to  some  more appreciative communities.<br/>

&gt; &gt;This is how we know it&#39;s spring!  Wyndham starts wearing his winter<br/>
&gt; &gt;coat.  When it&#39;s 10 degrees outside, he just wears a sweat jacket.<br/>
&gt; &gt;But come spring, there&#39;s that winter coat!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now that I think about it, maybe it just takes him a whole season to<br/>
&gt; &gt;adjust to changing which coat to wear!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a cute picture of Noah, taken one summer.  He was wearing his<br/>
winter<br/>
&gt; boots and coat..........and nothing else.<br/>

<br/>
My idea of unparenting, although I&#39;m not sure I would call it that (but unsure what I would call it) is not really taking the parent out. It&#39;s treating children with respect, just as you would any other adult. Would I come to your house and tell you that it was 12pm and it was time for lunch? No, not unless I wanted to be kicked out, LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I think &#39;unparenting&#39; IMO, is actually a very involved parent. They just don&#39;t exert control over people smaller than themselves or over anyone in general just because  they can.<br/>

hasn&#39;t been defined in the Oxford, Webster etc?<br/>
<br/>
Some people actually are pioneers and end up defining it by their actions <br/>
and their lives. Not by vehemently deciding who should fit where.<br/>
