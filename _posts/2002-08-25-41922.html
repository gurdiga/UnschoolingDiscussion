<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712256924">**Doesn&#39;t the military have it&#39;s own homeschooling regulations? Maybe with<br/>
variations from base to base? They don&#39;t adhere to the regulations in the<br/>
state the base is in, do they?**<br/>
<br/>
NO NO NO!!!!!!  Joyce! Why on earth would you think the military has any say <br/>
over the education and lives of the children of military members? And oh my <br/>
gosh, what a horrible thing THAT could be. <br/>
<br/>
Dependents are subject to the laws of the state they&#39;re living in, for <br/>
education or driving, or whatever. <br/>

(Funny. My very first personal contact with HEM over a decade ago was a <br/>
letter to the editor taking issue with an article from a military member <br/>
hoping to develop interest in pushing for a federal law to cover military <br/>
dependent homeschoolers no matter where they lived.)<br/>

(Sorry. I&#39;m usually pretty accurate about the stuff I absorb by osmosis.<br/>
Probably why I did well in school with minimal work ;-)<br/>

Base rules?<br/>
<br/>
Military dependents rarely (do they ever?) HAVE to live on base, but if you <br/>
choose to live voluntarily in a military fortress which has a commander, to <br/>
then say they should have no say over your children&#39;s lives does not follow <br/>
logically.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing to live in town, but another to live on base.<br/>
