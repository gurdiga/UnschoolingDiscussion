<div id="ygrps-yiv-785330041">I do not recieve posts via email, I check them at the group web <br/>
site.  There was a link on the home page with this information. Just <br/>
thought I would pass it along.<br/>

Dear Yahoo! Groups Members,<br/>
<br/>
Due to a recent outbreak of computer viruses being transmitted via <br/>
email messages, Yahoo! Groups is experiencing delays in delivering <br/>
group messages. To improve performance, and to help reduce the spread <br/>
of viruses, Yahoo! Groups has had to temporarily reject some <br/>
messages. <br/>
<br/>
Based on an advisory posted by a leading anti-virus company, Groups <br/>
will temporarily reject messages with the following subject lines: <br/>
<br/>
test <br/>
hi <br/>
hello <br/>
Mail Delivery System <br/>
Mail Transaction Failed <br/>
Server Report <br/>
Status <br/>
Error <br/>
If you have attempted to post a message to Yahoo! Groups and have <br/>
received a rejection notice with a link to this page, your computer <br/>
may have been infected. If you are confident that your computer is <br/>
not infected but your message was rejected, please try posting a new <br/>
message with a subject line which is different than those listed <br/>
above.<br/>
<br/>
We can assure you that this is only a temporary measure and hope to <br/>
restore message delivery to normal as soon as possible. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Yahoo! Groups Team</div>
