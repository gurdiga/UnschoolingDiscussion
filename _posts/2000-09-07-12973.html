in the car and drive a 1/2 hour every once in a while just to see some <br/>
expanse of green -- although with the drought we don&#39;t even have much of that <br/>
around here anymore.  I would dearly love to live a more rural area, but my <br/>
husband is a city boy and he&#39;s always needed to live in the city for his <br/>
work.  Then again, he just found out yesterday that his company is being sold <br/>
and that in a few months he&#39;ll be looking for a new job.  Maybe now&#39;s my <br/>
chance.<br/>

I was brought up in a small country village in UK.  I loved it.  I <br/>
always felt that my own kids missed out living in the suburbs.  If I <br/>
had my choice I would be back living on a farm at the drop of a hat - <br/>
or even a country cottage - hubby could commute to work each day.....<br/>
11yr old daughter hates the idea!!  She doesn&#39;t know what she is <br/>
missing.<br/>
