<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513148192">Hi All, <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a few weeks since the GMA show aired, and all the spin off it created has most likely cooled down a bit, I guess. But I came across a presentation by Tim Ferris (author of the awesome 4-hour workweek) on how to handle haters, and I thought it might be a nice read for those of you who often get the whole sh*tload of haters all over them.<br/>

Thanks for that, Susanne.  I&#39;ve considered all the elements of that at  <br/>
one time or another but it was really soothing to read that whole long  <br/>
list at a time when I&#39;m not feeling that &quot;JEEZ THE WORLD IS STUPID!&quot;  <br/>
feeling because people are burying homeschoolers, and unschoolers, and  <br/>
sometimes particularly me, in a flood of muddy crud.<br/>
