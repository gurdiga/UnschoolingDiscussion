<br/>
I have been going to a chiropractor for almost 3 years now.  It has saved me <br/>
from a hip replacement and a lot of pain.  I have hip dysplasia and <br/>
spondololotheosis (spelling?) of the back.  I started going to her 5 months <br/>
after my first son was born (shoulder dystocia, blue baby, not breathing, <br/>
oxygen strapped on me, nurse &quot;standing&quot; on my stomach, etc. I lived it too!) <br/>
because I was in so much pain.  I had been to a neurosurgeon who wanted to <br/>
do surgery on me or I could wait and have a hip replacement 10-15 years down <br/>
the road.  I stumbled upon my chiropractor and have been very pleased.  She <br/>
adjusts our sons and my husband also.  Anyway it took over a year before I <br/>
became completely pain free, but it was worth it!  My second delivery went <br/>
so smooth it was unbelievable!  I just wanted to let you know that we have <br/>
had success with chiropractic.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi All!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s not my intention to start a debate or create a controversy about the <br/>
&gt;merits (or not) of this press release and/or the new publications that are <br/>
&gt;mentioned below, but I did notice the portion that I&#39;ve highlighted in bold <br/>
&gt;and have underlined.  I know we have some aspiring teen and preteen writers <br/>
&gt;in our midst.  I, therefore, didn&#39;t want to pass up the chance to let them <br/>
&gt;know about this career opportunity.  Also, I think it would be great if the <br/>
&gt;magazine, and its web edition, had some input from at least one <br/>
&gt;homeschooler.  Please let us know if any of our homeschooled kids become <br/>
&gt;involved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;~Linda<br/>

&gt;   RODALE CHOOSES MH-18 AS TITLE OF<br/>
&gt;   NEW PUBLICATION FOR TEEN GUYS<br/>
&gt;   --------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;   Rodale Inc., a publisher of healthy living information, has<br/>
&gt;   announced that MH-18 was chosen as the official title of its<br/>
&gt;   new magazine and website aimed at teenage guys in grades<br/>
&gt;   8 to 12. MH-18 has also announced a talent search for high<br/>
&gt;   school and junior high school students to contribute story<br/>
&gt;   ideas and articles to its online and print publications. MH-18<br/>
&gt;   is seeking to recruit high-school-age field reporters to report<br/>
&gt;   and write about trends, issues and events that affect them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   MH-18, which is a spin-off of Men&#39;s Health magazine, is a new<br/>
&gt;   publication that will provide teen males with information on<br/>
&gt;   topics including fitness, sports, girls, gear and life. The new<br/>
&gt;   publication will premier on the Web later this spring and the<br/>
&gt;   magazine will launch with issues in September and December<br/>
&gt;   of 2000. The magazine is expected to roll out bi-monthly in 2001.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   ``MH-18 has a code-like quality that appeals to teens,&#39;&#39; says Jeff<br/>
&gt;   Csatari, Editor of MH-18. ``Eighteen is a magical age that<br/>
&gt;   everyone aspires to, whether you&#39;re 13 or 17.&#39;&#39;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Date: Monday, April 10, 2000 9:25 AM<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello, one and all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.  I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; husband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).  Although you want this subject to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; closed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>
&gt; &gt; watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>
&gt; &gt; their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>
&gt; &gt; melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; &gt; memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>
&gt; &gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; missed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>
&gt; &gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>
&gt; &gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>
&gt; &gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>
&gt; &gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;From a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; that nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>
&gt; &gt; could ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>
&gt; &gt; baby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the breast-feeding of our babies.  My father bottle-fed me, but he still<br/>
&gt; &gt; never learned to be sensitive or emotionally intimate with his children.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He simply FED me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In summary, I cannot express adequately just how wonderful an experience<br/>
&gt; &gt; it has been for ME to be part of our breast-feeding team.  Like Sonia, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand that there are those 1-2% of cases where breast-feeding is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not possible for medical reasons. But I strongly encourage it for all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the other fathers, if it&#39;s at all an option for them......<br/>

&gt;If this looks odd, it&#39;s cos it was 3 separate emails that I decided should<br/>
&gt;go together, but I don&#39;t want to spend time editing them now.  Hope no-one<br/>
&gt;minds :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bridget, I know what you mean.  I don&#39;t want to get offensive, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;mean that formula is &#39;just as good.&#39;  It&#39;s an inferior product, but babies<br/>
&gt;can still thrive on it, my own daughter, touch wood, has no physical<br/>
&gt;problems with it.  The point is that unless people take breastfeeding down<br/>
&gt;from it&#39;s pedestal and say &#39;This is the natural thing to do,&#39; some people<br/>
&gt;are going to hold it up as an unapproachable ideal, which I did to an<br/>
&gt;extent with the general lifestyle portrayed in the Art of Breastfeeding (GB<br/>
&gt;and NZ version from about 10 years ago.)  I was heartbroken when I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;continue breastfeeding Heather, partly because I&#39;d held it up so high.<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ve been sent the article I was talking about, I&#39;ll attach it.  If<br/>
&gt;the group doesn&#39;t accept attachments, I can send it privately to anyone who<br/>
&gt;wants it, or if the consensus of the list agrees, I can cut-and-paste it to<br/>
&gt;the list.  It explains what I mean much better than I can :-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Stephanie, you both deserve a big round of applause for being open to<br/>
&gt;discussion, with your past experiences, and your dh&#39;s reservations about<br/>
&gt;the benefits.  I know you wanted the discussion closed, but I would like to<br/>
&gt;add a few more thoughts.  You don&#39;t have to read them if you don&#39;t want :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am glad that you have reached a decision that works for you both.  And<br/>
&gt;while I understand the desire for the husband to bond with the child, I<br/>
&gt;think I have to point out that there are so many ways that we bond with our<br/>
&gt;babies, feeding is only one of them.  There are many breastfeeding fathers<br/>
&gt;who feel well-connected to their children, and their partners no doubt feel<br/>
&gt;indebted for their commitment to their families&#39; well-being.  Yes,<br/>
&gt;expressing milk is the next best thing to breastfeeding, with, according to<br/>
&gt;the WHO other mothers&#39; expressed milk next and formula fourth and last on<br/>
&gt;the priority list.  I would add other mother breastfeeding (in cases where<br/>
&gt;maternal breastfeeding is not possible, rather than not desired) &#39;wet<br/>
&gt;nursing,&#39; below maternal breastfeeding in this list, because there is much<br/>
&gt;more to breastfeeding than nutritional content.  This is what was so<br/>
&gt;upsetting for me. I knew that while some babies have allergic reactions to<br/>
&gt;formula, some babies suffer medical problems later in life due to<br/>
&gt;bottlefeeding, I have not suffered any visible effects (yet) from being<br/>
&gt;bottlefed.  I wanted my children to experience the whole experience of<br/>
&gt;breastfeeding, the skin contact, the physical developmental differences...<br/>
&gt;I wanted to experience breastfeeding, the hormonal rush, the skin contact.<br/>
&gt;It was particularly important for me since Heather had spent time in SCBU<br/>
&gt;that I become the only person who could provide this for my daughter.<br/>
&gt;Other people can do anything else for a baby, and in some societies, even<br/>
&gt;breastfeeding is widely shared.  But it is a very special thing for a<br/>
&gt;mother to share with her baby, and I am glad that I experienced it, and<br/>
&gt;still do, with my second child.  Now, if only I could persuade her to<br/>
&gt;stop.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for listening here, and I hope your dialogue continues, since I<br/>
&gt;think that parenting issues are never really closed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tracy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PS  I have to admire your commitment to expressing, I found it to be very<br/>
&gt;difficult and did not produce enough to feed my daughter fully after a few<br/>
&gt;weeks, even though I had provided for her completely while she was on the<br/>
&gt;SCBU.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-----------------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wendy, you&#39;re right, that&#39;s why I made the point that I don&#39;t speak for LLL<br/>
&gt;earlier :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But I&#39;d be interested to know what exactly you think gave LLL a bad name,<br/>
&gt;either on or off list.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t remember learning to read either but DO remember starting school<br/>
&gt;and getting in trouble for already reading and writing cursive.  Now that<br/>
&gt;was a moment because I couldn&#39;t understand why I got yelled at for doing<br/>
&gt;something my parents and extended family had been so tickled by.  Took me<br/>
&gt;until the 4th grade to figure out the teachers and that was a light bulb<br/>
&gt;moment!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, as to chocolate, it&#39;s Dove Truffles!<br/>

&gt;should be thankful! &lt;&lt;&lt;BEWG&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;----------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t remember this, it sometimes seems to me as if I was born reading!<br/>
&gt;This has led to a heavy reliance and belief in books, which has only really<br/>
&gt;been shaken into objectivity by adulthood.  Also, I used reading as an<br/>
&gt;escape mechanism from the bullying etc I received at school.  So while it<br/>
&gt;might seem like a good idea if children read alot, there is still &#39;too<br/>
&gt;much,&#39; as with tv or chocolate (HERESY!!!) or anything.  I know I&#39;ve had<br/>
&gt;&#39;lightbulb-moments,&#39; but right now I can&#39;t remember any.  I love watching<br/>
&gt;when the kids have them though :-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It seems that everyone I talk to can remember a light bulb moment in the<br/>
&gt;   process of learning to read - that AHA where you went from painstakingly<br/>
&gt;   sounding out words to actually GETTING it.  It&#39;s as if the code is<br/>
&gt;finally<br/>
&gt;   broken and you&#39;re seeing the words on the page for what they really are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Mine came while I was reading a Family Circus comic strip.  Thelma (Mom)<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;   standing in the bathtub holding a part for the plumber, who is working <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;   faucet.  Dolly comes in and says, &quot;That was [so and so] on the phone.  I<br/>
&gt;told<br/>
&gt;   her you couldn&#39;t talk right now because you are in the bathtub with the<br/>
&gt;   plumber.&quot;  I sounded it out, then again, and suddenly I could just READ<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;   whole thing without sounding it out at all!   I just looked at all the<br/>
&gt;words<br/>
&gt;   on the page at once, and they stood on their own, as if they had come to<br/>
&gt;   life.  I was 4 at the time, I think.  We were on vacation in Kansas <br/>
&gt;City,<br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;   a hotel with a pool on the roof, and my sister threw up in the hallway <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;   way back to our room after dinner that night.  She&#39;d had fish.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Date: Monday, April 10, 2000 2:25 AM<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello, one and all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.  I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; husband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).  Although you want this subject to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; closed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>
&gt; &gt; watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>
&gt; &gt; their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>
&gt; &gt; melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; &gt; memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>
&gt; &gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; missed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>
&gt; &gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>
&gt; &gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>

&gt; &gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>
&gt; &gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;From a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; that nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>
&gt; &gt; could ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>
&gt; &gt; baby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>

&gt;hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i agree with you about breast milk but unfortunately your position is <br/>
&gt;fascist in<br/>
&gt;nature and leaves no room for those who could not breastfeed even if they <br/>
&gt;may<br/>
&gt;have wanted to.  so yes there is no choice in many situation and when you <br/>
&gt;take<br/>
&gt;the stance breastfeed or you&#39;re relegating your child to a life of poor <br/>
&gt;health<br/>
&gt;is melodramatic and mean spirited because some people have no choice.  <br/>
&gt;breast<br/>
&gt;milk is w/o question superior but humans are amazing and have proven time <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;again to survive and even thrive on far worse things than formula or cows <br/>
&gt;milk.<br/>
&gt;so i think a good use of all the energy and passion you have regarding this<br/>
&gt;topic might be better used in advocating for milk banks rather than <br/>
&gt;berating<br/>
&gt;people.  i think information is best heard when it is give w/o all the <br/>
&gt;harsh<br/>
&gt;judgements-jmo<br/>

&gt; &gt; people think there is a &quot;choice&quot; and usually for the sake of unimportant<br/>

&gt;i also agree w/ lynda that sonia&#39;s comments need to be put in there proper <br/>

&gt;every situation is unique and making blanket statement serve no real <br/>

&gt;to<br/>

&gt;bad or guilty for choices they have made or are in the process of making or <br/>

&gt;     I think of homesteading living on a piece of fairly remote(ie. not <br/>
&gt;with next-door neighbours too close) property.  It also brings to mind <br/>
&gt;self-sufficiency and simplicity.  Does this corroborate with others&#39; <br/>
&gt;definitions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     LOL , as far as I know, stands for &quot;laughs out loud&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     What I would like to know is what DH and DD stand for?  I have seen <br/>
&gt;that they usually mean husband or parter and Children, but I am clueless as <br/>
&gt;to what they actually stand for,<br/>
&gt;     Thought this was a good opportunity to finally clear this up!<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: A father&#39;s view<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good Morning,<br/>
&gt;OK, I  have to get a word in here too....<br/>
&gt;My wife was able to nurse beautifully with both our boys and for that I am<br/>
&gt;thankful as well.  But I have seen my sister in law recently go through<br/>
&gt;breastfeeding problems (challenges!!) that really opened my eyes to how <br/>
&gt;much<br/>
&gt;of an unbelievable challenge it can be.  She had all kinds of support ( her<br/>
&gt;Midwife, My wife who is also a Midwife, and a lactation consultant) but she<br/>
&gt;still says labout was nothing in comparison to the emotional challenges of<br/>
&gt;the first couple of months of breastfeeding.  Since then I have noticed <br/>
&gt;many<br/>
&gt;other of my wife&#39;s clients with similar challenges.  It can be a enormous<br/>
&gt;challenge, and, for instance, if my sister in law had not been successful <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;surmounting all her challenges, I would NEVER hold it against her... even <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;it was medically possible.  I think that by saying there are only 1-2% of<br/>
&gt;women who cannot breastfeed that it invalidates the experiences of so many<br/>
&gt;women who have such extreme challenges, which may come from a variety of<br/>
&gt;sources...   The last thing a woman needs after deciding it is too<br/>
&gt;challenging for HER to breastfeed is a whole lot of guilt.  On the other<br/>
&gt;hand, I am completely in favor of promoting breastfeeding as the first<br/>
&gt;choice, and providing all the support and information that can be provided<br/>
&gt;to make the chances of success as high as possible.<br/>
&gt;Just another mans openion....<br/>
&gt;(I feel funny chiming in on this topic as a man... but I have been reading<br/>
&gt;the posts for a long time... and I feel I shouldn&#39;t hold back my thoughts<br/>
&gt;just on account of my gender)<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] A father&#39;s view<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hello, one and all,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.  I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; husband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).  Although you want this subject to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; closed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>
&gt; &gt; watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>
&gt; &gt; their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>
&gt; &gt; melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; &gt; memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>
&gt; &gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; missed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>
&gt; &gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>
&gt; &gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>
&gt; &gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>
&gt; &gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;From a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; that nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>
&gt; &gt; could ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>
&gt; &gt; baby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the breast-feeding of our babies.  My father bottle-fed me, but he still<br/>
&gt; &gt; never learned to be sensitive or emotionally intimate with his children.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He simply FED me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In summary, I cannot express adequately just how wonderful an experience<br/>
&gt; &gt; it has been for ME to be part of our breast-feeding team.  Like Sonia, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand that there are those 1-2% of cases where breast-feeding is<br/>
&gt; &gt; not possible for medical reasons. But I strongly encourage it for all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the other fathers, if it&#39;s at all an option for them......<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My DH was the one that started this whole thing by being uncomfortable<br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; breastfeeding. We have talked about positives/negatives of it, and he<br/>
&gt;knows<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all the feelings expressed here. I truly feel that he would be more<br/>
&gt;confused<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; by this than if he were to just walk in to my blatant disregard of his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; feelings, and was nursing. I cannot speak for the reasons that my DH<br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather I not nurse, only that we have discussed it (in length) and <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have agreed on expressing milk for the baby. Is that not the next best<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing? Not one person has even complemented him on that decision. I <br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted more information about LLL so I could help him with any ?? he <br/>
&gt;may<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have in the future. That didn&#39;t even happen. I know that this entire<br/>
&gt;process<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has been a joint venture, DH and I, since I could not get pregnant<br/>
&gt;without a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; medical staff (and DH). Since EVERYTHING regarding a pregnancy has <br/>
&gt;been<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; joint effort, why is it not right for him to join in the bonding and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeding? I hope that since this is my DH we are speaking about, that<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would now go to the dead topic section, for it is a finished topic in<br/>

&gt;     I think of homesteading living on a piece of fairly remote(ie. not <br/>
&gt;with next-door neighbours too close) property.  It also brings to mind <br/>
&gt;self-sufficiency and simplicity.  Does this corroborate with others&#39; <br/>
&gt;definitions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     LOL , as far as I know, stands for &quot;laughs out loud&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     What I would like to know is what DH and DD stand for?  I have seen <br/>
&gt;that they usually mean husband or parter and Children, but I am clueless as <br/>

&gt;Hi Brooke,<br/>
&gt;Thanks for your support.  You&#39;re right - my opinion of the medical <br/>
&gt;fraternity<br/>
&gt;is not high, a fact that puts me in a rather akward postion.  It was a <br/>
&gt;doctor<br/>
&gt;who hurt my daughter, and now I&#39;m having to put my trust in other doctors <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;help her.  I know all doctors aren&#39;t the same, but if I had my way I&#39;d <br/>
&gt;never<br/>
&gt;deal with another one.  My DH and I actually considered not going through<br/>
&gt;with Tess&#39;s surgery, mainly because of our doctor phobia.  Really, I&#39;m past<br/>
&gt;most of my anger now.  Most of the time I feel only blessed.  My life has<br/>
&gt;been changed for the better through our suffering.  Thanks again.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think so, but since our hospital doesn&#39;t have a transitional care ward, <br/>
&gt;it works as both, but not well since there isn&#39;t room for the mothers to <br/>
&gt;sleep there.  I don&#39;t know what criteria they use, but I do know that I <br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t asked because I was sleeping off a sleeping tablet, Heather&#39;s birth <br/>
&gt;was short in time but makes a fairly long story, for a natural birth :-)  <br/>
&gt;So they couldn&#39;t ask me to express either.  What interested me was that <br/>
&gt;they never asked the mothers expressing for their babies if any excess <br/>
&gt;could be used for other babies.  I know mothers donating milk have to be <br/>
&gt;tested for HIV and other diseases, but surely that doesn&#39;t take that long, <br/>
&gt;and it&#39;s more appropriate to give milk to babies of around the same <br/>
&gt;gestation and age, if you know what I mean.  A fact-finding mission to <br/>
&gt;China found the mothers expressing milk into enamelware bowls to give to <br/>
&gt;babies who needed it, they were specifically matched for gestational age <br/>
&gt;and age from birth, as close as possible.  Makes sense to me :-)  I must <br/>
&gt;find out where I read that snippet ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good job I&#39;ve worked all this out already :-)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;A study by the NCT, biggest childbrith and breastfeeding support org in <br/>
&gt;Britain, found that 95% of women could lactate, for many of those who <br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t it was due to breast surgery.  Some bf counsellors have estimated <br/>
&gt;97-98%.  But whatever it is, it&#39;s a low percentage of the population, who <br/>
&gt;have every right to be thankful for the hygiene standards and ongoing <br/>
&gt;reseach to improve formula which we have in Western, &#39;First-world&#39; society <br/>
&gt;(and in some cases, angry at the doctors who performed surgery without <br/>

&gt;Hi Sonia,<br/>
&gt;Thanks for the suggestion.  We haven&#39;t tried chiropractic care yet.  We do<br/>
&gt;have an acquaintance who&#39;s a chiropractor, and right after Tess was born we<br/>
&gt;asked him if he thought he could help her.  He told us that there was not<br/>
&gt;much he could do for her if the brachial nerves were torn, which they are -<br/>
&gt;or were - they&#39;ve since been repaired surgically.  He&#39;s also told us what <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;said about many babies being born out of alignment, probably due to the<br/>
&gt;strange delivery techniques doctors are known to use.  I don&#39;t know much<br/>
&gt;about the benefits of chiropractic - I may just have to look into it a <br/>
&gt;little<br/>
&gt;bit more.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing more about your experience with it.<br/>

&gt;Firstly, Stephanie I have followed this thread and know you want it<br/>
&gt;closed, but to me I feel your husband&#39;s attempt to control a natural<br/>
&gt;function of YOUR body is the tip of the iceberg in his controlling<br/>
&gt;behaviour, it is an abuse to both you and your child.   I would be<br/>
&gt;concerned about what this childish behaviour of his is a precursor<br/>
&gt;to, I seriously think he needs counselling.<br/>

&gt;Damian Ulan wrote: [very eloquently]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.  I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; husband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I used to wonder about DH.... back in Australia it is more<br/>
&gt;commonly used as an abbreviation for something else.<br/>
&gt;Welcome Damian, good to hear a man&#39;s perspective on this<br/>
&gt;subject.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Although you want this subject to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; closed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>
&gt; &gt; watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>
&gt; &gt; their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>
&gt; &gt; melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; &gt; memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>
&gt; &gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; missed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>
&gt; &gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>
&gt; &gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But Damian, some men see this obviously very intimate<br/>
&gt;relationship as excluding them, whereas you are drawn into the<br/>
&gt;intimacy and become a part of it.<br/>
&gt;There is no denying the sensuality of breast feeding, and I feel this<br/>
&gt;is what can be a problem for some men, and women too.<br/>
&gt;Our warped view of the body mainly stemming from religious beliefs<br/>
&gt;where the natural and beautiful functions of the body are made<br/>
&gt;sinful, has caused too many people to regard breast feeding as a<br/>
&gt;deviant behaviour.<br/>
&gt;When I breast fed my first child [I turned 18 two days before his<br/>
&gt;birth] I encountered a lot of negative vibes from society in general,<br/>
&gt;this was back in &#39;73.  If I was out anywhere with him I would rush<br/>
&gt;home to feed him, I was uncomfortable nursing in front of anyone<br/>
&gt;except for my husband, and this was a real pity.  With each baby I<br/>
&gt;noticed society&#39;s perception of breast feeding changing, it got to<br/>
&gt;the point when I had my last baby in &#39;96, that people are more<br/>
&gt;likely to frown on a woman giving a baby a bottle than seeing a<br/>
&gt;woman nursing.  To my way of thinking, no-one should frown at<br/>
&gt;either, because as we know for different reasons not all women can<br/>
&gt;breast feed their infants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>
&gt; &gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>
&gt; &gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As you point out, a man doesn&#39;t have to be able to feed a baby to<br/>
&gt;bond with him/her, there are so many things that a Father can do<br/>
&gt;with/for his child that don&#39;t require him to be a pseudo Mother.<br/>
&gt;Babies don&#39;t need two Mothers.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;All right! There is one now ... it&#39;s called UnschoolGrads (there was <br/>
&gt;already<br/>
&gt;a HomeSchoolGrads - but it&#39;s for Christians who were in a particular <br/>
&gt;program,<br/>
&gt;apparently).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-Thanks for the rapid reply.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Is anyone aware of any mailing lists or discussion groups for =<br/>
&gt; &gt;homeschool graduates?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  I am a former homeschooler (now adult), and would like to meet others.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Thanks!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
