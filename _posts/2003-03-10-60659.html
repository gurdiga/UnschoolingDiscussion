<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277830361">Hi!  I don&#39;t mean to make this sound like a dire emergency or anything like <br/>
that, but we have this knitting mushroom that we got years ago, and the <br/>
instructions to use it have vanished into the ether.  Anyway, we want to <br/>
make a tail using our knitting mushroom, and I can&#39;t find instructions to <br/>
use the thing on the web, and, well, I just can&#39;t seem to figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I remembered my community of over 1000 people, one of whom may know <br/>
how to use and knitting mushroom and would be willing to tell me.  Liam <br/>
really needs a tail, and this would be the most fun way to make one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  We&#39;re waiting anxiously by the computer, yarn in one hand, <br/>
knitting mushroom in the other.<br/>

Hi!  I don&#39;t mean to make this sound like a dire emergency or anything<br/>
like <br/>
that, but we have this knitting mushroom that we got years ago, and the <br/>

<br/>
make a tail using our knitting mushroom, and I can&#39;t find instructions<br/>
to <br/>
use the thing on the web, and, well, I just can&#39;t seem to figure it out.<br/>

know <br/>
