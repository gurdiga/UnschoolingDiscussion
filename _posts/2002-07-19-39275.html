fact, as of 2003 there will no longer be special notations on SAT&#39;s for <br/>
students who needed additional time to complete it on basis of disability. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430751541">After having been &quot;labeled&quot;  all of his life as a<br/>
person with a learning disability, which has severly<br/>
hurt his self esteem, the last thing my son wants to<br/>
do is to attend another school which will label him as<br/>
well.  Is there no school which sees this (ADD)<br/>
strictly as a learning difference and not a<br/>
disability.<br/>
<br/>
My son trys to read and hates it, he does not learn<br/>
that way, does much better by learning visually.  The<br/>
last time he was tested in 9th grade he tested 2 grade<br/>
levels higher, this was a complete change from three<br/>
years before when his testing was below average.  The<br/>
difference was he was given the test orally versus<br/>
written.  Because the test was given differently than<br/>
the rest of his class, must that always be considered<br/>
a disability.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This comment is not meant to negate your husband&#39;s experience, but rather to <br/>
add another point of view.<br/>
<br/>
My husband Jon also had no use for school. Ever. He dropped out of high <br/>
school and at various times has tried going to various other schooling <br/>
programs. So far, he has dropped out of community college, university, and <br/>
trade school. These attempts at schooling all happened early in his career <br/>
and life&#39;s journey when he thought that maybe the lack of a degree was <br/>
holding him back. It wasn&#39;t and it hasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
At age 43 Jon has been successfully supporting his family for over 20 years <br/>
now. He has follwed his interests, taken advantage of mentors and in-house <br/>
publications, and self-taught himself the things he needed to move ahead in <br/>
his field. His employers have always looked at him and his skills, rather <br/>
than at his degrees or lack thereof.<br/>
<br/>
I should point out that Jon is also currently plotting a way to drop out of <br/>
corporate life altogether. ;-) He has been reading and studying and talking <br/>
to knowledgable folks and visiting and trying out and sampling and whatever. <br/>
We soon hope to be able to open our own cafe.<br/>

<br/>
Well now that he&#39;s out of school he can learn any old way that suits him. <br/>
:o) It&#39;s time to give him time to figure out his own brain. Let him dabble <br/>
and try things and play around with stuff and experiment. Let him rest and <br/>
sleep and recharge his soul. Let him find himself again.<br/>

<br/>
If he&#39;s not in school right now, he doesn&#39;t have to worry about tests at <br/>
all. He&#39;s not behind or ahead of anybody. He knows what he knows and can <br/>
learn what he&#39;s interested in. If he needs it, he will learn.<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that kids who have had this much difficulty in school really <br/>
need time to heal and grow within themselves before they even begin to think <br/>
about college and more school.<br/>

Sorry I am coming late into the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
There is a book I am dying to get my hands on, &quot;The Rise of the <br/>
Creative Class&quot;. It just came out and I scanned it at B&N. It was <br/>
written by a public policy scholar and the gist of it is that people <br/>
in creative positions are disrupting the &#39;American work ethic&#39; <br/>
paradigm for good. He does not, to my knowledge, address the issue of <br/>
a college degree but what he does point out is that businesses have <br/>
been flocking to cities all across the US where the creative index is <br/>
high because creatives will not come to them.<br/>
<br/>
I point this out because, although it seems to be true that HR-hacks <br/>
tell people they need a degree to get ahead in life, it really <br/>
depends on the kind of job you are pursuing. I can only attest for <br/>
such industries as tech, web, pr & advertising --they really do not <br/>
care from which school you come from. What people in this industries <br/>
are looking for are experts in their fields with good portfolios and <br/>
good references. My husband and I are the classic case of people who <br/>
self-taught themselves how to work with computers (he&#39;s a software <br/>
programmer, I&#39;m web creative editor). He has a BFA in Painting, I <br/>
have an ABD in Latin American Languages and Literature. If people <br/>
were just looking at our degrees, we would never be considered for <br/>
any of the jobs we have had.<br/>
<br/>
Mary,<br/>
Life definitely is good outside of the corporate world. Different and <br/>
sometimes difficult but definitely good. We have corporate free-lance <br/>
jobs we just don&#39;t have corporate lifestyles. That in itself is worth <br/>
an extra 15 years of good health and a happy life.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133869068">UC Davis is very unique.  I personally am attending University of Houston. <br/>
 And as I said, I have found that the college atmosphere is a lot different <br/>
for Learning Differenced people, which is why I suggested meeting with the <br/>
department.  My experience is very positive.<br/>
<br/>
For colleges that are designed specifically for people who learn <br/>
differently,  you may want to check out Beacon College in Florida at <br/>
www.beacon.edu and Landmark College in Vermont at www.landmark.edu.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266392051">The problem is that he refuses to be accountable even to me, and in a <br/>
marriage that doesn&#39;t work.  He expected to just fork over $20,000 and let <br/>
him do what he wants with it without supplying a business plan or other <br/>
written plan of what he wants to do with the  money. If he were on his own, <br/>
he could take whatever risks he wanted. But with a wife and three kids, he <br/>
has to be responsible to a degree.  If he doesn&#39;t want to be responsible, <br/>
then he should leave.<br/>
