<div id="ygrps-yiv-643424729">Hello.  My name is Cay Gibson and I&#39;ve been lurking for the past <br/>
couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I have always been an eclectic hsing mom...using literature-based <br/>
planning with an assortment of workbooks, and a Charlotte Mason <br/>
flavor.  I have 5 dc ages &quot;soon-to-be&quot; 16 ds, 13 dd, 10 ds, &quot;soon-to-<br/>
be&quot; 6 dd, and 20 month dd.  I&#39;ve been married for 17 years to my <br/>
high school sweetheart, Mark.<br/>
<br/>
I came to this list this school year to get a feel for what <br/>
unschoolers *actually* do during the day.  Checking into the posts <br/>
each day, I still find myself clueless over the *daily doings* of <br/>
unschoolers.  I understand the concept and, due to personal reasons, <br/>
I&#39;m really anxious to adopt an unschooling way of thinking.  I feel <br/>
(again...due to personal reasons) that I need the unschooling <br/>
lifestyle this year.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a full two days.  Today I&#39;m tired and the dc are in the <br/>
living room playing.  I don&#39;t have a clue what they&#39;re playing but <br/>
they&#39;re quiet and that&#39;s what matters to me today.  Thunder has <br/>
punctuated the whole morning and today promises to be a day of rain <br/>
and winds.  We&#39;ve been gone for two days.  I&#39;m looking forward to <br/>
staying home today.  Yet (even after six years of hsing) I still <br/>
think of the structured/disciplined learning that is happneing in a <br/>
school room today and I worry that my dc are just *playing* in the <br/>
living room.  <br/>
<br/>
I admire hs families whose dc do self-study on their own during the <br/>
day.  My dc tend to wait for me to place something in front of <br/>
them...otherwise they&#39;re off *playing*.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be most helpful...if I could just get a *peek* <br/>
inside your *unschools* today.  What are your dc doing right this <br/>
moment as you read my message?  What are your plans to do with them <br/>
for when you get off the computer?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158391947">Hi, Cay.<br/>
<br/>
What your children are doing is unschooling -- they&#39;re doing what interests<br/>
them right now. It may not be &quot;academic,&quot; but &quot;just playing&quot; is just as<br/>
valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I have two sons, 11 and 6. The 11-year-old isn&#39;t here at the moment, because<br/>
he spent the night at a friend&#39;s house, but if he were here he&#39;d be playing<br/>
on the computer or reading or playing Legos with his brother. He&#39;s working<br/>
his way through a Latin book at the moment, so usually he&#39;ll find 10 or 15<br/>
minutes a day to do a couple of sentences in that, and he&#39;s just passed his<br/>
audition to move up into the advanced band, so he&#39;s going to have to find<br/>
time to practice -- but if it&#39;s important enough to him, he will.<br/>
<br/>
The younger one is upstairs playing on the computer, enjoying the fact that<br/>
his brother&#39;s absence gives him dominion over the sacred machine.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of them does &quot;self-study&quot; in the way I think you mean it (except for<br/>
the older one&#39;s Latin): deciding they just have to open a textbook and plow<br/>
through it. They learn from everywhere -- from the books they read all the<br/>
time, from the discussions we have with them, from the places we take them<br/>
and the TV shows they watch and the things they hear on the radio and the<br/>
people they talk to. And they know an astounding variety of things.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest difference between unschoolers and homeschoolers is that<br/>
unschoolers have (for the most part!) let go of the belief that there are<br/>
certain things that children have to learn at certain times. your<br/>
16-year-old may be thinking about college, and he will have to figure out<br/>
what he needs to cover to get there in a two years, but for the others, it<br/>
might be a good idea to let them decompress for a while, to begin to believe<br/>
that you won&#39;t tell them what they have to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t give you a better idea of what a day looks like around<br/>
here, but they&#39;re all different. It&#39;s scary to let go of expectations, but<br/>
it can be very rewarding.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The &quot;secret&quot; isn&#39;t in what unschooled kids do (or what other parents imagine<br/>
we somehow &quot;get&quot; them to do) but in the freedom they have to do what they<br/>
feel they need to do. Right now it looks like my daughter is doing something<br/>
academic all on her own. And that&#39;s sort of what many people picture an<br/>
ideal unschooling home will look like. But in reality her writing is no<br/>
different to her than playing video games or watching TV. It&#39;s something she<br/>
enjoys so that&#39;s what she does.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling days are like summer days when you were a kid. You were free to<br/>
do whatever you wanted. (I hope anyway!) Unschooling parents are probably<br/>
more involved than most &quot;regular&quot; parents, who just send their kids off to<br/>
find something to do. We&#39;re not glued to out kids ;-) so much as we are<br/>
aware of their needs and are there to help them get what they want.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good morning Cay.<br/>
Today we are going to &quot;just hang out&quot; and see where that leads. Riht now ds <br/>
almost 8yrs is watching Star Wars ep. 2, dd 2yrs is sleeping with her dad. The <br/>
horses are fed, so are dogs and chickens. I will think of something for <br/>
breakfast soon, supper is made, and my broken arm really hurts today, so I will take <br/>
it easy for the most part. <br/>
Ds will probably try to find a friend to play with, or go play computer. We <br/>
may read,go for a walk,play cards. Dd will putter around and sing and be nude, <br/>
for most of the day.I am caring for a friends 2 younger kids while older one <br/>
goes to riding lesson and then we may have tea. <br/>
We can&#39;t go anywhere cause I can&#39;t drive right now, but it is fun to stay <br/>
home. Dh goes to work at 2pm, we might make cookis or paint, or   we might watch <br/>
more tv, depends on the children&#39;s preference. I may clean ds room, as he is <br/>
having trouble moving in there, but I asked first, and he said yes.<br/>
then supper, maybe a walk(my legs aren&#39;t broken!) perhaps a board game when <br/>
dd goes to sleep, maybe read some more.<br/>
Sounds pretty up in the air, loose etc., but we really like it that way, <br/>
spontaneity works well for us, as does this fabulous unschooling way of life. We <br/>
can breath.<br/>
Nancy in BC<br/>
kids here aren&#39;t back to school yet, by the way. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This morning, Anna came in and woke me up around 9:45 am.  She wanted <br/>
to go to the preschool, where my sister works as the Director,to <br/>
volunteer.  She has been anxiously waiting all summer while public <br/>
school was out ( and preschool, that follows the ps schedule)to begin <br/>
volunteering when school started back.  Preschool started last week, <br/>
but it was very chaotic with new 2 yr olds beginning for the first <br/>
time, so she waited til this week when things calmed down a bit.  SO, <br/>
I took her to preschool and my sister was getting ready to take her <br/>
out to the playground to meet some of the kids when I left.  <br/>
<br/>
I got back home and Ethan and JP were up and playing N64.   I noticed <br/>
that Landon ( who goes to public high school, he is a Sr) was still <br/>
in bed.  I guess he is not going to school today.  I began checking <br/>
my email, reading, replying to some..  Ethan came in and asked me to <br/>
find some cheats for Lego Racers.  I did that and printed them off <br/>
for him.  I hear them in thier bedroom bumping around and talking, <br/>
but I do not know what they are doing. <br/>
<br/>
Every day just goes by and we do whatever comes up.  Some of the <br/>
highlights of this week have been:<br/>
<br/>
  On Monday we visted an former ( and most favorite) teacher of Anna <br/>
and Ethan.   She had a baby 6wks ago.  That was a wonderful visit.  <br/>
She was totally into the unschooling and very supportive.   Ethan and <br/>
JP played on her game cube while Anna, Jen, and I cooed over the baby <br/>
and just chatted.  We stopped at Wal-mart on the way home and JP got <br/>
some marked down dragon thingy and Ethan got a new pack of Yu-gi-oh <br/>
cards.  I saw another homeschooling mom at Wal-mart, her son takes <br/>
karate with JP.  I blew her away talking about how we DON&quot;T do <br/>
school. LOL.. they do FIAR. <br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday, I had to run errands to the bank and credit union.  Anna <br/>
went with me, Ethan and JP stayed home and played N64.  ( that was <br/>
for about an hour)  I took Anna to piano, JP went with me, Ethan <br/>
stayed home.  I came back from piano, dropped JP off..  I thought <br/>
they would want to go to the park day, but Ethan and JP wanted to <br/>
finish playing Lego Racers.   I took Anna to the orthodontist.  She <br/>
gets her braces off next week!.   When we got back from the ortho, we <br/>
watched Analyze That. OH, we had watched Swim Fan that morning before <br/>
I ran the errands.   Then, I took the rented DVDs back and Anna and I <br/>
went to the grocery store.  The boys stayed home. They cleaned thier <br/>
room last night. JP had dumped all of the legos and imaginext toys <br/>
out.   <br/>
<br/>
We are going to the laundrette today ( our washing machine is <br/>
broken)  Tomorrow we are going to a new park day at a new location.  <br/>
Then, we are leaving to go camping in Tennesse for Labor Day.   If we <br/>
don&#39;t leave tomorrow evening, we will leave early Friday morning..  <br/>
We are staying til Monday.  We will probably hike, bike, hang out, <br/>
ride horses, just general camping stuff.. I get to try out my new <br/>
dutch oven!!  YAYYYY.. My sister and her family and my first cousin <br/>
and her family are also camping with us.  It will be LOTS of fun.  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;During the day&quot; is a problem, if you want to get to unschooling.  Learning <br/>
happens ALL the time.  <br/>
<br/>
If your children tend to wait for you to place something in front of them, <br/>
that&#39;s what you taught them by using structure.   Place this in front of them:  <br/>
The whole world and the freedom to be in it.<br/>
<br/>
The self-study that needs to happen is all yours at this point.  When you <br/>
learn to see the value of play and to know where and how natural learning <br/>
happens, then unschooling can start to take off.<br/>

This morning two of my kids are in New Mexico (probably asleep) and Marty, <br/>
the mid-kid, is with me at Kelly&#39;s house in South Carolina.  He&#39;s eating a pop <br/>
tart and watching Scooby Doo at the Addam&#39;s Family (pretty cool episode).  <br/>
Kelly and Duncan are at the dentist.  Then we&#39;re going to pack our stuff into the <br/>
car and go to:<br/>
fire engine museum<br/>
along with their family to get Cameron a skateboard<br/>
an ice cream shop<br/>
the air port.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure Holly&#39;s asleep; it&#39;s 9:30 there, and she and I were up instant <br/>
messaging until 1:00 her time.  She&#39;s 11, and was thrilled to find me online.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been gone since last Thursday.  We had had one phone conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby works at 5:00 (I think) at a gaming shop, so he&#39;ll probably sleep until <br/>
noon.  He&#39;ll be at work when I get home, probably.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our day so far has been pretty boring.  Erica got up around 8:30.  She went<br/>
on the computer.  She was coordinating all her Yahoo IDs with their<br/>
passwords and writing them down in her notebook when I got up because she&#39;s<br/>
got so many that she&#39;s starting to forget which screen name goes with which<br/>
password.  Sean and I were still sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
Around 9:30 my grandson called and woke me up.  He&#39;s only 19 months but he<br/>
was pulling a chair toward the phone so my daughter said to him, &quot;who are<br/>
you calling&quot;.  He said &quot;grammy&quot;, so she called me and I talked to him.<br/>
After Erica finished what she was doing I asked her for a turn at the<br/>
computer.  This was about 10.  She made macaroni salad for lunch.  It came<br/>
out pretty good.  She could have cooked the macaroni a minute longer, but it<br/>
tasted good.  About 11 Sean got up and brought his laundry down to the<br/>
basement to wash it.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, they are both sitting on the couch watching music videos, eating<br/>
their macaroni and arguing.  Something about large numbers, I&#39;m not really<br/>
listening.  Erica just had me stop writing this to find a poll on BET.com<br/>
that she wanted to vote in.<br/>
<br/>
Later we have to go to WalMart to pick up Sean&#39;s glasses.  He lost one of<br/>
the lenses so I had to leave them while they ordered the correct lens.  They<br/>
were done on Saturday but I was at the conference.  Poor kid had to go a<br/>
week without them.  I got some of Jim Weiss&#39; tapes so we&#39;re going to listen<br/>
to one of them in the car on the way to WalMart.  My husband will probably<br/>
pick up my grandson on his way home from work to spend a couple of days with<br/>
us.  We keep him until he asks to go home, usually 3 days is all he can take<br/>
of us.<br/>
<br/>
You should have asked this last night when we were discussing quantum<br/>
physics and whether or not time travel could be possible.  At least then we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t look so boring!<br/>

boys  (7and just about 5) are still in bed.  Hubby will probably get up in<br/>
about 30 minutes to start getting ready for work.  The boys may get up any<br/>
time or they may sleep until 10:30 when they need to get up so we can take<br/>
Hubby to work.  After taking him to work, the boys and I will get ready for<br/>
library day with our homeschool group.  Some of the group may decide to go<br/>
for ice cream today.  Not sure if we will go to ice cream or not.  After<br/>
that we need to head to Babies R Us to find a baby shower gift.  Then it&#39;s<br/>
home to whatever the day brings us.<br/>
<br/>
The day will depend on what they boys want to do.  There are no plans.  We<br/>
may get some cool book at the library that has a project or experiment in<br/>
it, maybe they will just want to read their books without me...maybe with<br/>
me.  They may want to watch a movie or play video games or fantasy<br/>
play....there is no telling right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463622071">Hello Cay,<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have been lurking and reading. Have learned much and am sure will learn more. I have 3 dd ages 16, 14, and 11. Everyday is different for us for the most part. We plan some activities around things we are interested in. Especially if something special is going on in the area. We usually find out about events in the local paper or a local parents magazine. I am always on the look out for anything that we may want to do, either at home or away from home. And not everyone needs to participate. I am fortunate that the girls are interested in a number of the same things, but if not they are capable (ready) to stay home if they do not want to come along. <br/>
<br/>
That said, right now all 3 girls are watching  The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Our entire family LOVES this series and have anxiously awaited the release on dvd. I picked it up yesterday but since it is a long movie and the OC was on last night they waited until today to watch it. I will be making popcorn soon. Earlier this a.m. my 16 you spent time on the computer(2hrs). She has a wide variety of interests and surfs the net for just about everything. She  loves fantasy and I found a free e-course about the Lord of the Rings for her to participate in. My 14 year old volunteers at a local horse ranch and also takes lessons there. So that is her passion and I try to encourage that as much as possible. In September she will partcipate in a pony show to raise money for The Minnesota Animal Hooved Rescue. I also will be there again this year to work the concession stand. She is a little more shy and quite than my other 2 so having me close by puts her more at ease and she will more likely want to participate. My 11 year old loves science and art. So I always make sure she has a wide variety of art supplies (right now there are great sales going on) and science books/ magazines around for her. Also web sites can be found for just about any interests. We live on a hobby farm, so everyone helps out (spoils, plays) with the animals. Right now they include 3 dogs, 3 cats, 3 rabbits, 9 hens, 2 Bantam roosters, 4 ducks and 1 African goose. We hope to expand soon with dairy goats. And eventually sheep. Before we add any animal the girls and I do research about different breeds and their needs.We also have a large bird feeding station and are always watching the daily activity.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is longer than I had planned, but I still could add more. I guess we are busier than I thought. And I didn&#39;t even add some of their planned activites. No wonder I am so tired some days! :) But I wouldn&#39;t want it anyother way! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777433298">We slept in this morning (that happens alot as we always stay up past<br/>
midnight)<br/>
It was storming this AM when dh got up for work  It was great sleeping<br/>
weather.  Shortly after dh left (poor guy, we wish he could stay home and<br/>
play everyday) Max (9yo) got up and played Gauntlet on the gamecube.  He<br/>
then went to the family room and watched some morning cartoons. Then I got<br/>
up.  Sam (12yo girl) woke up shortly after me. They had breakfast (cereal).<br/>
Right now Sam is helping out by doing the dishes. Max is doing a combination<br/>
of picking up toys and such from the family room floor while doing some<br/>
karate type moves and making fighting noises LOL<br/>
I am wriiting (of course) and petting the dog, wondering if I really have to<br/>
goto the grocery store today (I hate shopping). DH will be home for lunch in<br/>
about 2 hours.  We usually eat lunch while DH and I dicuss current events<br/>
(politics, news articles, etc) The kids almost always get in on the<br/>
discussion.<br/>
Max is planning a game that he wants to play with his best friend this<br/>
afternoon after PS gets out. He is telling me about the props they will use<br/>
and what characters they have decided to play.  Sam and I will probably play<br/>
with the sewing machine again. She has shown a great interest in learning to<br/>
sew recently.  So we dug out the machine last week, bought some remnants to<br/>
practice on, and some patterns. A local homeschooler is offering classes for<br/>
sewing, and Sam really wants to do it.  I&#39;ve got to call today and find out<br/>
when the classes start. After that we may watch a movie, read, play games or<br/>
whatever suits us. Sam has been going thru some tough times recently with<br/>
her best friend (she is in public school, we&#39;ll call her &quot;B&quot;) B&#39;s Mom has<br/>
been trying to talk Sam into going to PS all summer.  She said that B is<br/>
taking all honors courses and will not have time for friends &quot;except at<br/>
school&quot;  ARGH! So instead of seeing B everyday, now she is lucky to see her<br/>
once a week and she just lives down the block. So Sam has been spending more<br/>
time with me and/or a homeschooled boy (first big crush LOL) that lives down<br/>
the street.  I am sure around 3pm today kids will begin to show up on our<br/>
doorstep asking if the kids can play. This evening someone will probably<br/>
help me with dinner. One of my friends will probably stop by.  When DH gets<br/>
home we will talk about stuff over dinner.  He will more than likely play a<br/>
game at the kids request.<br/>
<br/>
The possibilities are endless.  Some days we are out all day long. Our plans<br/>
could change at any moment, we fly by the seat of our pants around here and<br/>
we love it!<br/>

<br/>
this remark by Teresa really perked my ears up...or caused my <br/>
eyebrow to raise ...being the case of email. ;-)  The reason is <br/>
because I use FIAR and love it.  I know Teresa doesn&#39;t mean anything <br/>
against FIAR when she shared this...and I&#39;m not taking it that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to make mention that *boxed* curriculum hsers think <br/>

learning style coming out of using FIAR.  It&#39;s more of an extra. <br/>
There are days we&#39;ve done only FIAR because I didn&#39;t want to do <br/>
anything else.  And, since I love literature and books, I enjoy FIAR <br/>
immensely.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess what&#39;s considered work for someone may be considered fun for <br/>
another.  <br/>
<br/>
Huh?  Is that part of the concept behind unschooling?  Are am I way <br/>

otherwise?  I know I sound like a novie hsers...and I am a novice <br/>

Yet (even after six years of hsing) I still <br/>
think of the structured/disciplined learning that is happneing in a <br/>
school room today and I worry that my dc are just *playing* in the <br/>
living room.  <br/>
<br/>
I admire hs families whose dc do self-study on their own during the <br/>
day.  My dc tend to wait for me to place something in front of <br/>
them...otherwise they&#39;re off *playing*.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice would be most helpful...if I could just get a *peek* <br/>
inside your *unschools* today.  What are your dc doing right this <br/>
moment as you read my message?  What are your plans to do with them <br/>
for when you get off the computer?<br/>
First, I think it is great that all five of your kids are playing together! <br/>
That is what mine are doing too. I am concerned that you are making statements <br/>
about &quot;just playing&quot; and &quot;otherwise they&#39;re off playing&quot; as if playing is <br/>
frivolous and something to be discouraged. My kids learn the most when they are <br/>
&quot;just&quot; playing. <br/>
<br/>
This morning my dh rolled out of bed, did his morning thing and then crawled <br/>
back into bed with me. I heard something in my sleep that sounded like; &quot;I&#39;ve <br/>
got a few minutes, just wanted to cuddle...&quot; I went back to sleep and woke up <br/>
when he kissed me good-bye. (I think he was late! &lt;g&gt;) The kids came <br/>
downstairs about 10 minutes later, Moly took our dog out and came back in and crawled <br/>
into bed with Jack and I. Maggie (the dog) got excited and jumped in bed too. <br/>
After about 5 minutes of cuddle time Jack got up and fixed himself some cereal. <br/>
Moly and I played &quot;Where&#39;s the puppy&quot; with Maggie for a few minutes then Moly <br/>
went and got some treats to show me she taught Maggie the down command. (She <br/>
learned it from Animal Planet when she was &quot;just&quot; watching TV &lt;g&gt;) Then she <br/>
and I got up and fixed coffee. <br/>
<br/>
I spent time on the phone with a friend to make arraignments to help her pack <br/>
for a move and with my MIL who wanted to make plans for Christmas. The kids <br/>
ate breakfast and watched the last part of LOTR that they had missed last night <br/>
when they fell asleep. Yep! The fell asleep on their own, no one told them to <br/>
go to bed. Moly got up when she was tired and went upstairs on her own. After <br/>
the movie was over, Darin woke Jack up enough to tell him he was still on the <br/>
floor and did he want to sleep there or go upstairs. Jack went upstairs. <br/>
<br/>
They have played on the computer with some games they got from the library. <br/>
Moly was coloring in a new American Girl coloring book (Kaya) she bought <br/>
yesterday afternoon. She has been mowing yards this summer, and she had a lemonade <br/>
stand during the fiesta and has earned quite a bit of money! She wanted to get <br/>
the coloring book at Barnes and Noble last week, but didn&#39;t have the $14 or so <br/>
on her. I had told her I would buy it for her, but she wanted to get it <br/>
herself. Yesterday we were at Sam&#39;s Club and she found it for half what it is <br/>
selling for at Barnes so she bought it. She asked, while coloring, where Columbus <br/>
landed when he first came to America. I told her I wasn&#39;t too sure, but I <br/>
thought it was somewhere in the Bahamas. So she looked it up. I was right. Then her <br/>
little brother asked if she wanted to play marbles with him so she put her <br/>
things up and they got all of his marbles out. Jack wanted to draw a circle on <br/>
the floor with chalk. I suggested a string tied to make a circle. They thought <br/>
that was a great idea. I did too. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Darin got home to eat and give me the car, the kids had tons of things to <br/>
show him. Right now they are building with Moly&#39;s new Ello set of fairies. Darin <br/>
asked me if I was going to bring in my plants off the front porch today. I <br/>
said yes. Then he asked the kids if they would please clean the porch off so he <br/>
can sand it this weekend. Moly asked if he wanted it done right now or just <br/>
sometime, he said whenever. No yelling or demanding, no time limit, just a nice <br/>
request and I am sure the kids will do it for him. Jack wants to help sand. <br/>
Darin said he will look for small eye goggles, Jack said he can use his swim <br/>
mask. Yes he can, great idea! <br/>
<br/>
Moly went and got the sand paper pads for the sander and is now trying to <br/>
figure out how many pads they will need for the porch. Jack suggested measuring <br/>
the porch so they have abandoned the Ello set and Daddy and are off in search <br/>
of a measuring tape. Darin wants to go back to work soon, so I will leave the <br/>
kids to their &quot;math&quot; and take him back. Darin is still &quot;playing&quot; with the Ello. <br/>
This afternoon we will go swimming and I will take them to a friends house to <br/>
play so I can go help my other friend pack for her move. <br/>
<br/>
Some days we &quot;do&quot; more than others. Mostly we just live and go with what ever <br/>
presents itself at the moment. Hope this helps.<br/>

&gt; **What do you admire about it?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>~Rue  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the question, Rue.<br/>
Honestly I haven&#39;t stopped to wonder what I admired about it.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s seeing some children who have a wholesome enthuasiasm <br/>
for learning, a love and excitment of new learning adventures.  Who <br/>
aren&#39;t scared of answering questions put to them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying me dc aren&#39;t like this...they are about some <br/>
things...the things they&#39;re interested in.  But I dread when we&#39;re <br/>
in a situation around other hsers or public school children and my <br/>
dc clam up.  I feel like they&#39;re hiding their talent and knowledge <br/>
under a bushel basket.  Not that I want them to come off like &quot;no-it-<br/>
alls&quot; but.... Example, my middle ds mumbles terribly.<br/>
<br/>
Yet we&#39;re taking a Latin class this year that meets once a week.  <br/>
He&#39;s repeating the Latin like it&#39;s old shoe.  I&#39;m still trying to <br/>
remember how to say, &quot;My name is...&quot;  :-)  But he does this mostly <br/>
at home...not around his friends.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny...my oldest ds was talking to me the other day and <br/>
the &quot;stuff&quot; he was telling me.  And it was brilliant stuff (for lack <br/>
of a better word...information?) What struck me the most about all <br/>
the things he was telling me is that we never &quot;studied&quot; any of that <br/>
stuff (info?).  I don&#39;t ever remember this as &quot;subject&quot; matter.  I <br/>
even asked him how he knew all that &quot;stuff&quot;.  He said he just knew <br/>
it...had picked it up here and there or read about it.  That was <br/>
just the other day...the day I started thinking that maybe <br/>
unschooling wasn&#39;t such a bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
Also, he went to the Grand Canyon this summer with my parents.  My <br/>
dad, a highly intellectual person, came back very impressed with <br/>
this young grandson.  My son is a worry-wart and at times seems <br/>
unsure of himself.  He has been accused of being unfocused.  But my <br/>
parents were nothing short of impressed.  My father was amazed at <br/>
the things Corey knew and said he handles himself well and is very <br/>
sharp-witted and quick with information.<br/>
<br/>
And who is more observant of a child than the parents?  The <br/>
grandparents.  They look with critical eyes at the parents and <br/>
watchful eyes upon the child.  My parents were basically <br/>
saying, &quot;You&#39;ve done a great job with this young man&#39;s training.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was speechless...and amazed at God&#39;s humility and compassion.<br/>
<br/>
Again...maybe there is a lot to say about the unschooling <br/>
lifestyle...which I&#39;m sure you will all let me know.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

yes, your post was helpful...as well as everyone else&#39;s.  I ahve <br/>
lots to think about tonight.  And I do understand that play is <br/>
highly under-rated in today&#39;s highly competitive world.  Havn&#39;t <br/>
there been schools who have stopped having recess time altogether?<br/>
<br/>
I do believe in playtime.  Following CM&#39;s method, we do <br/>
our &quot;schooling&quot; during the morning hours and end at lunchtime.  The <br/>
dc have all afternoon and night for &quot;play&quot; and learning on their <br/>
own.   So I&#39;m not questioning the playtime.  I&#39;m trying to adjust to <br/>
the whole unschooling mindset.  I&#39;m here with a new thinking and I&#39;m <br/>
looking to &quot;educate&quot; myself.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If I come across asking the wrong type question or sounding like <br/>
a &quot;structured&quot; person, you will all have to excuse me.  I have lived <br/>
in &quot;structure&quot; all my life.  But, with the birth of each baby, my <br/>
life has become a little more unstructured.  I want to use this <br/>
unstructured lifestyle to our advantage. <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m seeing is that it is the excited, enthuiastic hsers who <br/>
raise excited, enthusiastic children.  <br/>

books designed to guide them through subjects? Because that is what FIAR is. You <br/>
read a book and then do activities or units of study based on the book. You do <br/>
FIAR because YOU enjoy it. As unschoolers, my kids read a book because they <br/>
want to and they may or may not play or do something because of what they read. <br/>
And I don&#39;t structure activities based on what they are reading. They read for <br/>
enjoyment, or to learn about something they want to know about. Like Moly <br/>
this morning wanted to know about Columbus landing in America. She was coloring, <br/>
stopped, looked up her answer, and went back to coloring. I did not question <br/>
her on her knowledge, I didn&#39;t force her to look anything up, or design an <br/>
assignment based on her question. She found out what she wanted to know and left <br/>
it at that. <br/>
<br/>
Then you said you want peace of mind on these &quot;unschool&quot; days you &quot;pull while <br/>
you are unschooling this year.&quot; Unschooling isn&#39;t something you &quot;do&quot; on a <br/>
certain day or for a year. Unschooling isn&#39;t a plan of sort, it is just life. You <br/>
have to separate the word you know as school from your vocabulary if you want <br/>
to unschool. You have to stop putting unschooling in quotes, as if it is just <br/>
another description of the kind of school-at-home you do. Many of us describe <br/>
unschooling as child led learning. BUT that doesn&#39;t mean we take an interest <br/>
of our child and turn it into a unit study. That would be eclectic schooling. <br/>
<br/>
Your peace of mind comes from trusting that children will learn what they <br/>
need to know, when they need to know it. It comes from knowing that a momentary <br/>
interest in when Columbus came to America is all she needs to know at that <br/>
particular time. Now Moly knows, she will remember it, I won&#39;t have to test her on <br/>
it. You also have to know when an interest is momentary and when it is long <br/>
term. Moly want&#39;s to be a vet. She has wanted this since forever. I do as much <br/>
as possible to provide things she can use toward this goal. Her interest in <br/>
Columbus was here and gone. But I am sure she will remember it always, unlike <br/>
me, who learned it at a set time in school, spent days on the subject, probably <br/>
did some sort of report on it, had a test and promptly forgot. So before you <br/>
do anything you can ask yourself, is this momentary or lasting? Many times I <br/>
have disappointed myself and ruined a child&#39;s interest in something because I <br/>
went overboard. <br/>
<br/>
Moly has her life goal all planed out. She wants to go to K-State, she even <br/>
knows what she needs to do to get into the vet school after her four years of <br/>
college are over. But I also know that Moly is only 9, she may change it at any <br/>
time. When we go to Manhattan to visit friends who own a pet store there, she <br/>
asks to go to the college. She has toured the vet school and asked questions. <br/>
She takes our dog to the vet, follows the vet around asking questions. He <br/>
lets her look in the microscope at stool samples and gets his collection of <br/>
hearts filled with worms, still born puppies and kittens, a fetal deer fawn and <br/>
other oddities out for her to examine. <br/>
<br/>
She got to watch Maggie&#39;s spay last year. He recruited her one day to help <br/>
with bull dog puppies. He was doing a c-section and needed another pair of hands <br/>
to help him, his assistant and the owner. She was ecstatic! I did not ruin it <br/>
for her by quizzing her and throwing a bunch of books at her to read. Our vet <br/>
is always amazed at what she knows and he always comments that we must really <br/>
work hard on this and asks when does she find time to do her animal things <br/>
with all her other studies. In the past I have shrugged my shoulders and said <br/>
nothing. But when she told the vet that one of the bull dog puppies was &quot;mushy&quot; <br/>
and she thought it might have water on its brain and he examined it and told <br/>
her she was right. He again made the comment that she must be neglecting other <br/>
things to learn about animals. I finally took the time to explain that Moly <br/>
chooses to learn about animals, that she doesn&#39;t neglect anything because there <br/>
isn&#39;t anything to neglect. He thought about that for a minute and said he <br/>
wished someone had thought that way when he was a kid. <br/>
<br/>
To get unschooling, you have to get life. You read because you enjoy it. You <br/>
learn about something because you want to. Let that be your guide with your <br/>
children too. Give them that same freedom and curtsey. <br/>

do FIAR... but your kids might not want to join you, or they might want<br/>
to just sit in on the stories but not do the other activities, or they<br/>
might want to skip the Monday and Tuesday activities and then modify the<br/>
Wednesday one, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
What my daughter likes is theatre, so most days we have the structure of<br/>
a rehearsal at some point. She decides what to audition for and then<br/>
after casting she&#39;ll generally get a rehearsal schedule, and most<br/>
evenings she&#39;ll ask me what&#39;s planned for the next day. She asks me to<br/>
run lines with her sometimes, and I do. She&#39;s never failed to be off-book<br/>
by the deadline. Today she has rehearsal from 4:30 to 6:30, and I offered<br/>
to take her shopping before that for an &quot;audition outfit&quot; - when I was a<br/>
kid we always got a new outfit for the first day of school, and  since<br/>
most of her clothes are from thrift stores or hand-me-downs, we thought<br/>
getting a brand-new outfit would be a good thing. We also need to get a<br/>
birthday present for my grandma and one for a friend of hers - she&#39;s been<br/>
chosing beads and making personalized necklaces for most of her friends&#39;<br/>
birthdays lately, so we&#39;ll probably do that.<br/>
<br/>
Sometime late last night or early this morning she planned her next<br/>
birthday party, including writing a guest list and coming up with a list<br/>
of places to possibly have the party. She has a group of friends from the<br/>
bay area, where we used to live, and she wants to invite them, too, so<br/>
she was thinking of places in between Davis and Alameda. She&#39;ll be eleven<br/>
in January, so this is really planning ahead...<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But I <br/>
&gt; really do want to have peace of mind on these *unschool* days that <br/>
&gt; we pull while we&#39;re *unschooling* this year.  My lifestyle requires <br/>
&gt; it this year.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think of unschooling as something you can do on some days but not<br/>
on others. Unschooling permeates our lives, and the basis of unschooling<br/>
is my daughter&#39;s freedom to chose her own paths for learning. She started<br/>
writing a novel the other day, after writing very little for 5 years. It<br/>
was cool - I think I posted about it other places, but maybe not here. <br/>
<br/>
I do think having &quot;peace of mind&quot; with unschooling is important - but I<br/>
think you have to recognize it as your issue, and not put it on your<br/>
kids. If you give the mssage that you&#39;re not feeling comfortable about<br/>
unschooling because they&#39;re not learning certain things, or learning in<br/>
certain ways, then you&#39;re actively sabotaging the process and it won&#39;t<br/>
work. You&#39;re the one who needs to work on changing your beliefs about<br/>
learning and schooling...<br/>

that&#39;s because their kids ask for it.<br/>
<br/>
The vision you have of learning/education (as most people do!) is of getting<br/>
the child from where she is to where she&#39;s supposed to go.<br/>
<br/>
But for unschoolers there&#39;s no predefined end point. It&#39;s more like the<br/>

textbooks to someone who is thinking in school terms.<br/>
<br/>
Play to unschoolers is doing what they enjoy. When my daughter writes,<br/>
that&#39;s play to her. Play is how she spends her days. Learning happens as a<br/>
side effect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817248638">&lt;&lt;Havn&#39;t there been schools who have stopped having recess time<br/>
altogether?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that I have had to do, vigorously and often, is<br/>
consciously choose not to go down the path of discussing the practices<br/>
of schools - good or bad. It is so easy, especially when in the position<br/>
of having to defend one own&#39;s lifestyle to the unconvinced, to get<br/>
sucked into an ever widening quagmire of school bashing. I walk away<br/>
from ALL conversations about schools, for my own peace of mind. It is<br/>
kind of a &quot;cold turkey&quot; approach to removing all the schoolish lingo and<br/>
thinking from my mental vocabulary. I&#39;ve just HAD to do it to be free to<br/>
grow.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I do believe in playtime.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do *not* believe in playtime. I believe in living a full life, with my<br/>
daughter engaging in activities that have some interest for her. If you<br/>
do not have playtime, then all activities can be viewed as having merit.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Following CM&#39;s method, we do our &quot;schooling&quot; during the morning hours<br/>
and end at lunchtime.  The dc have all afternoon and night for &quot;play&quot;<br/>
and learning on their own.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn does some of her most intense and enriched reading, drawing,<br/>
questioning, and imaginary play at night. She often spends her morning<br/>
on quiet tv watching and reflection, and then usually wants to go for a<br/>
swim.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m trying to adjust to the whole unschooling mindset.  I&#39;m here with<br/>
a new thinking and I&#39;m looking to &quot;educate&quot; myself.  :-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the wonderful journey. I urge you to follow Sandra&#39;s earlier<br/>
suggestions about the reading. It is like peeling an onion - just when<br/>
one thinks &quot;I&#39;ve got it&quot;, along comes another challenge to one&#39;s<br/>
assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What I&#39;m seeing is that it is the excited, enthuiastic hsers who <br/>
raise excited, enthusiastic children.&gt;&gt;<br/>

and I had a fabulous time. Thanks go out to Kelly, Ben, all the speakers and<br/>
so many wonderful attendees. Way Kewl!<br/>
<br/>
    Laundry and grocery stores have taken up most of my day until now. My<br/>
youngest and I did clean out the rabbit cage. I got to read a little of my<br/>
new HEM last night. Life Learning came too. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
    As I type my youngest(9yob) is watching Totally Spies. Then Justuce<br/>
League. (It takes meforever to compose one of these. LOL!) We just finished<br/>
a conversation obout heaven and hell. From what I have been able to see<br/>
today he has played army men, fixed and eaten his breakfast and lunch,<br/>
played and watch his older brother play Kingdom Hearts, watched TV, and<br/>
played in his room for a while. Oh yes he took a shower to get ready to go<br/>
to a friends house tomorrow.After dinner we have plans to play a game of<br/>
LIFE.He also showed me a magic trick.<br/>
<br/>
    My oldest ds (18yo next week) has been working on his computer getting a<br/>
driver, working on stuff for his computer group, working on RedHat, IMing,<br/>
IRC, and various other stuff. He did play Kingdom Heart and later he goes to<br/>
his weekly computer group.<br/>
<br/>
    Aimee can I contact you off list? I&#39;d like to talk to your dh about how<br/>
he got into computer admin without a degree. That is Michaels focus. He<br/>
starts college classes in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
    My other ds (13yo) spent the night at a friends last night. He&#39;s been<br/>
out the majority of the day socializing with friends that will start school<br/>
soon. Also with his hs friends in the neighborhood. Riding bikes,<br/>
skateboards, swimming and all that stuff. He&#39;ll be home for dinner then out<br/>
again. It&#39;s been a slow day. I&#39;ll be glad when I get caught up and the kids<br/>
in the hood are back to school. It will be nice to have my kids around a<br/>
little more. ;-) I&#39;m sure they have done other things today too.<br/>
<br/>
    Advice? Well relax, read, read, read. Write, explore your town, state,<br/>
and countryside. Find *your* passion and live a full life. That will be the<br/>
example you want and will enjoy the wonders of your family in doing so. I&#39;m<br/>
sure others have said it too. Listen to your kids, your heart, and your<br/>
family will soar. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648310788">Hi Cay<br/>
<br/>
From someone who has homeschooled for seven years and only in Jan/Feb <br/>
began exploring the concept of Natural Learning.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, my husband and 9 year old girl just got back from the <br/>
pool. She&#39;s reheating some dinner for an after pool snack. Earlier <br/>
today, we read through some DK books on large cats (and the small <br/>
cats) and talked about the differences, and compared the facts that <br/>
we got from THESE books, to some facts we had from books over the <br/>
summer, specifically: Is the Puma a large cat or a small cat? One <br/>
book says &quot;small&quot; but these books we have now say &quot;large.&quot; We&#39;re <br/>
going to look into that one further.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 year old boy is flying paper airplanes around the house, <br/>
waiting his turn at the computer, since he wants to conquer all the <br/>
levels on a game we just got: Beetle Junior. He&#39;s thinking he doesn&#39;t <br/>
really like this game all that much, because it doesn&#39;t have that <br/>
many levels, and you pretty much do the same things on each level. <br/>
He &quot;rescued&quot; my youngest girl&#39;s &quot;snack&quot; by turning the heat off under <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
My 15 year old girl is taking drama at the high school again this <br/>
year, but her &quot;studies&quot; right now are about pirates...Pirates of the <br/>
Caribbean having turned her on to that subject. She spent an hour or <br/>
so chatting on a Tolkien forum, answering emails, and listening to <br/>
some Celtic CD&#39;s that she got at the UT Shakespeare Festival last <br/>
week with my mom. (Next year, MY turn!!! :) She&#39;s in her room at the <br/>
moment, probably writing. She&#39;s keeping her journal in a hobbit <br/>
notebook, and writing as if she were a hobbit explaining her life to <br/>
the journal.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today, we drove up the nearby canyon and went for a nice <br/>
walk. The temp was low 80&#39;s and a nice breeze: lovely walking <br/>
weather. We found lots of bushes with dark red/blue/purple berries on <br/>
them and tasted to see if they were choke cherries.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, can anyone tell me if choke cherries have five pits?<br/>
<br/>
We made sure and spit everything out, but they didn&#39;t have a bitter <br/>
taste, so we think they are not poisonous. Probably choke cherries, <br/>
actually.<br/>
<br/>
But I do have something &quot;scheduled,&quot; once the pool closes. I want to <br/>
read Watership Down aloud to the family. Doesn&#39;t that sound like a <br/>
good read-aloud? We&#39;re going to get a chapter under our belts before <br/>
deciding whether to read the whole thing or not. They&#39;re <br/>
thinking &quot;not&quot; at this point, but they&#39;ve agreed to a fair sample <br/>
before really saying no thanks.<br/>
<br/>
well, there you go. <br/>
<br/>
Wow. I never thought we did that much today!<br/>
