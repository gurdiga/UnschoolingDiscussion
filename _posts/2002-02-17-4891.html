<div id="ygrps-yiv-155466617">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
After hearing about this group in the last week from at least three different <br/>
people and their saying how great it is I decided to join. My name is Ginny <br/>
Hunt and we homeschool/unschool with our four children (Ryan 18, Jonathan 10, <br/>
Josiah 8, and Victoria 5) in Virginia.  :::waves::::<br/>
<br/>
I just had to comment on the Candy Land thread because my daughter&#39;s birthday <br/>
in December was themed &quot;A Unicorn in Candy Land&quot; -- ha! She had chosen some <br/>
birthday party plates that portrayed a magical rainbow and white unicorn amid <br/>
candy flowers and a gingerbread castle, so we ran with the Candy Land theme <br/>
because we had an old game from when my oldest was a toddler in the mid <br/>
eighties. The graphics change over the years and my daughter was fascinated <br/>
with the different characters and how they differed from the ones she knew <br/>
today.  Anyway, we had made a gingerbread house so we put the old game board <br/>
in the center of the table and plopped the gingerbread house on top of it and <br/>
set the little colored gingerbread men game pieces around it.  I made a <br/>
unicorn shaped cake and served all kinds of fun foods like sparkly pink <br/>
Jell-o in plastic champagne glasses and pastel mini marshmallows in gold foil <br/>
cups.  A day or so before the party I baked large gingerbread men that the <br/>
kids decorated during the party.  <br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s a better use for the game than actually playing it. Ha!<br/>
