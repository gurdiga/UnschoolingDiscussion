  &gt; Yes I really want to come.  I have to say its a little scarey though <br/>
  &gt; LOL,Columbia SC, away from home ha, and what to do with the kids?  Steph<br/>
  &gt;  <br/>
<br/>
  Bring the kids with you.  If that is possible.  There is plenty of help at <br/>
  the conference.  How many and how old are they?  Let us know if you have trouble <br/>
  getting it together, maybe someone here has a some great ideas.<br/>
