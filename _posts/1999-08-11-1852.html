<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923519049">Hi Mary Ellen,<br/>
My 4.5yo was able to use the potty for her urine months before her two same<br/>
age friends on our street.  Her bowels,  however,  have been a completely<br/>
different story!!  She has had constipation issues from birth.  Our doctor<br/>
sent us to a specialist when she turned 4.  We agonized with this &#39;bowel<br/>
program&#39;  for 2 1/2 months.  (She was taking 5 TBPS of medicine daily!! And<br/>
we struggled to get it in her.)  We finally, &#39;gave it up&#39; and let it go.  I<br/>
decided to just let her be for a few months ... maybe she&#39;s just on the far<br/>
end of that spectrum.<br/>
We did not allow her to wear pull-ups during the day.  And she was somewhat<br/>
limited with activities if she had accidents (e.g.,  she was not allowed to<br/>
go on certain outings or to friends homes if she had had an accident the day<br/>
before.)   THIS WAS NEVER A PUNISHMENT!!  We did offer &#39;incentives&#39;  like<br/>
special outings when she did well.<br/>
T.Berry Brazelton holds the opinion that some children are afraid to let<br/>
their bowel movements be flushed because they see it as part of<br/>
themselves.....I can&#39;t say what goes through the mind of a four year old!!<br/>
Hopefully,  you can hang on to your own comment:  Life&#39;s too<br/>
mysterious...don&#39;t take it serious.<br/>
My only other words of wisdom:  This too shall pass.<br/>
Blessings,   Susan<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716674981">Hi,<br/>
When I decided to potty train my 2 1/2 yo daughter it was a couple of months <br/>
past her second birthday. I just took off the diapers and never looked back. <br/>
I&#39;ve have to clean up some messes but it&#39;s only been 3 months and she&#39;s fully <br/>
potty trained. Plus I put posterboard on the bathroom door and let her put <br/>
her favorite stickers on it when she went on the potty. (Praise them <br/>
constantly!) It was a lot cheaper and easier to clean the carpets than buy <br/>
pull ups. <br/>
                                    Good Luck<br/>

Have you ever seen an untrained teenager??  They do (unless there is an<br/>
organic problem) get it, just in their own time.  You just have to learn to<br/>
let go of the idea they should do something on a time table, even if it&#39;s a<br/>
time table most kids fit.  AND also remember that most people fudge a great<br/>
deal. Sure, I can say my last child was out of diapers around two. That&#39;s<br/>
because she spent from 2- 3 naked. It had nothing to do with being capable<br/>
of going potty, it had to do with the fact she wouldn&#39;t wear dipaers, or<br/>
anything else for that matter.  :0 sigh.. I miss those days.<br/>

Unschooled potty learning. My daughter was nearly three when she decided to<br/>
use the potty. She took off her diapers on a Thursday and that was it,<br/>
except I did ask her to wear a pull-up at night for a week until I was sure<br/>
she would wake up (she did). I am willing to wager that if you&#39;d waited the<br/>
three months she would have been reliable at just about the same time,<br/>
without the three months of messes.<br/>

When my 7 1/2 yo dd was about 3 1/2 I asked her if it woudl be more <br/>
convenient to use the toilet. She planted her feet on the ground, crossed her <br/>
arms, looked me straight in the eye, and stated,  &quot;Not ready, Mom.&quot;    End of <br/>

4).  Since he has always been a smart little cookie...what I did was have<br/>
HIM pick a date on the calendar that would be the start of &quot;NO MORE DIAPER&quot;<br/>
days.  (I only showed him one months calendar!!)  It worked!!  Each day, we<br/>
crossed off a day...getting closer and closer to the &#39;big&#39; day.  I think it<br/>

Hello Mary Ellen,<br/>
<br/>
what a coincidince, but this is something I am working on as well.  I have<br/>
done potty learning by allowing my children in to watch, and respecting<br/>
their own timetables.  All three of my girls learned to use the potty<br/>
between 2 1/2 and 3 years old without accidents.<br/>
<br/>
One of my twins, who is almost five, has refused to have bowel movements on<br/>
the potty.  Betsy has them in her underwear instead.  I have treated her<br/>
with respect, talked and talked about it, kept it simple, ie &quot;I know you&#39;ll<br/>
poop on the potty when you are ready&quot; and &quot;everybody poops on the potty&quot;<br/>
etc.  All I could get out of her was that she was afraid to go on the potty<br/>
because it would hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I have had her to the doctors for a check-up over this, and she has never<br/>
exhibited signs of constipation.  The biggest problem we&#39;ve had with it is<br/>
that she &quot;forgets&quot; to tell me about it, so the bm&#39;s get all over her bottom<br/>
and causes yeast infections.  (no fun)<br/>
<br/>
Last night when we were getting ready for bed and putting away laundry she<br/>
walked around the house for half an hour, crying and squeeling *loudly* that<br/>
her butt hurt.  I decided that it was time to take action, and took her to<br/>
the bathroom.  I explained calmly that we wouldn&#39;t leave until she pooped.<br/>
She cried and cried, and even tried to bite me.  The other kids were really<br/>
supportive, and my oldest drew a picture of Betsy pooping that we hung up on<br/>
the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy screamed and begged to go to bed, but I held my ground and started<br/>
rubbing her tummy in the &quot;I-love-you&quot; massage (I think it&#39;s in the Sear&#39;s<br/>
BABY BOOK for colic).  She screamed at me that she was going to DIE if she<br/>
pooped (?!?!) but I kept repeating that I knew she could do it, and whenever<br/>
I offered to leave she asked me to stay.  After over ninety minutes of<br/>
crying, she had the bigest bm I&#39;ve ever seen out of such a small child,<br/>
stopped crying immediately, and was extremely proud.  She hugged me and said<br/>
she needed to go tell her sisters.<br/>
<br/>
I think her problem stems from one occasion when it did hurt to go, and she<br/>
just held on to that.  My oldest almost road her bike out in front of a car<br/>
when she was five and her scared her so much that she refused to cross<br/>
streets for several months.  I remember a similar experience of having to<br/>
hold her in the van while she screamed about refusing to cross the parking<br/>
lot from the car to the grocery store.  It took about forty-five minutes<br/>
before she would allow me to carry her in to the store (and come to think of<br/>
it, she was a few weeks before the age of five at the time, too.  Hmmmm.<br/>
Coincidince?) and after that catharsis she got over her fear of crossing the<br/>
street.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this story is really long, and I have no idea where our potty<br/>
learning saga will go now.  But Betsy will be five in a few days, so I hope<br/>
you don&#39;t feel so alone!  I know of a woman near Pontiac, MI who is<br/>
gathering information to write a book about late trainers, her twin boys<br/>
were still in diapers at the age of five last summer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541033965">We tried that &#39;special undies&#39; with our 3 yr old Piper (4-6-96). She started<br/>
going to the potty when she was 2.5 exactly and was doing great until march<br/>
when we started making her (worst think we have done so far this year) go to<br/>
nursery at church. We only made her go for a month before we realized that<br/>
it was the wrong decision but the damage was done. She took control of the<br/>
one thing she could, her potty habits. She started not only going in her<br/>
pants but going where ever she felt  like. It is a long uphill battle trying<br/>
to regain her trust and encourage her to use the potty every time. She<br/>
always does bm in the toilet but she will still pee where she wants to<br/>
sometimes. It is very frustrating but what I find works best with her is<br/>
just treating her with respect and encouraging her but not over praising (it<br/>
just makes her more self conscious). My point, about the special undies, is<br/>
that she can wear her special pooh undies but if she soils them she will<br/>
quickly run out of them. Some days it works and some days it doesn&#39;t. By the<br/>
way, she is our most spirited child, our brightest and our most daring (has<br/>
been climbing high and jumping from high places for quite a while). Our now<br/>
4.5 yr old boy Sebastian potty trained himself promptly at 2.5 with no<br/>
problem, he just asked to wear undies one day and never looked back. Go<br/>
figure.<br/>

 4 1/2?  He&#39;s my cautious child, the one who never rushes into anything.<br/>
 Have you ever seen an untrained teenager?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here for my 7 yo.  4 1/2 years.  One day I said to him that sorry I <br/>
can&#39;t take you with me you&#39;re to big to change diapers outside of home.  He <br/>
never wet another.  My 2 yo at the time saw him start to use the potty and <br/>
trained herself within 2 days.  It&#39;s not worth arguing over, she&#39;ll do it.<br/>

&gt; &gt;When I decided to potty train my 2 1/2 yo daughter it was a couple of months<br/>
&gt; &gt;past her second birthday. I just took off the diapers and never looked back.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve have to clean up some messes but it&#39;s only been 3 months and she&#39;s fully<br/>
&gt; &gt;potty trained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Really, I recommend just waiting until the *child* decides, not the parent.<br/>
&gt; Unschooled potty learning. My daughter was nearly three when she decided to<br/>
&gt; use the potty. She took off her diapers on a Thursday and that was it,<br/>
&gt; except I did ask her to wear a pull-up at night for a week until I was sure<br/>
&gt; she would wake up (she did). I am willing to wager that if you&#39;d waited the<br/>
&gt; three months she would have been reliable at just about the same time,<br/>
&gt; without the three months of messes.<br/>

I have a 5 year old boy who is at the same state.  He finds it much more <br/>
comfortable to squat in a diaper than to sit either on a potty chair, or the <br/>

I&#39;m new here and writing from Eastern Washington State.  I&#39;m looking for<br/>
support for my youngest daughter&#39;s transition out of diapers (aka potty<br/>
training!).  She is definitely resisting it.  She seems to have bladder<br/>
control, but not so great for BM&#39;s.  I&#39;m considering just not buying<br/>
diapers anymore.  Does that sound cruel?  Tried pull-ups, but she treats<br/>
them as a diaper.  Any support or ideas would be helpful!<br/>
I hope this is an OK question for this list.  I&#39;m trying to trust  in my<br/>
children&#39;s own rates of mastering skills.  But it&#39;s hard when all her<br/>
friends, including some much younger, are out of diapers.  Even my<br/>
usually supportive mother wonders if I just &quot;haven&#39;t made it clear to her<br/>
that I expect her to use the toilet&quot;!<br/>

had care for, and my own two) that when children are ready to potty train,<br/>
there are not messes (or rarely) and it takes more like a weekend than<br/>
three months.  When they have the skills and the ability necessary, and<br/>
they show interest and are self motivated (without elaborate rewards,<br/>
ultimatums or other coersion) they will &quot;train&quot; themselves with minimal<br/>
help from you.  Even my most brilliant niece, who was reading and doing<br/>
math at age three and continues to astound us all, did not potty train<br/>
until nearly 4, despite coersion, multiple rewards promised and other pushing.<br/>

not alone.  It really is just one more of those things that society<br/>
thinks should be done by a certain age and really is not so different<br/>
from when they learn to read or ride a bike or multiply.  But for some<br/>
reason certain milestones are considered more critical by most people --<br/>
like when they learn to read, or potty train or wean from the breast.<br/>
By the way, my bil was potty trained at 9 months!  (My mil says!!)  And I<br/>
clearly remember having accidents and wetting the bed at 6 or so, even<br/>
though I&#39;d been &quot;potty trained&quot; for years.<br/>

child you have.  LOL, I remember my mother &quot;training my brother.  He was so <br/>

the potty seat, and sitting there for hours singing or reading or telling <br/>

&gt;Hello Mary Ellen,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;what a coincidince, but this is something I am working on as well.  I have<br/>
&gt;done potty learning by allowing my children in to watch, and respecting<br/>
&gt;their own timetables.  All three of my girls learned to use the potty<br/>
&gt;between 2 1/2 and 3 years old without accidents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of my twins, who is almost five, has refused to have bowel movements on<br/>
&gt;the potty.  Betsy has them in her underwear instead.  I have treated her<br/>
&gt;with respect, talked and talked about it, kept it simple, ie &quot;I know you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;poop on the potty when you are ready&quot; and &quot;everybody poops on the potty&quot;<br/>
&gt;etc.  All I could get out of her was that she was afraid to go on the potty<br/>
&gt;because it would hurt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have had her to the doctors for a check-up over this, and she has never<br/>
&gt;exhibited signs of constipation.  The biggest problem we&#39;ve had with it is<br/>
&gt;that she &quot;forgets&quot; to tell me about it, so the bm&#39;s get all over her bottom<br/>
&gt;and causes yeast infections.  (no fun)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Last night when we were getting ready for bed and putting away laundry she<br/>
&gt;walked around the house for half an hour, crying and squeeling *loudly*<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;her butt hurt.  I decided that it was time to take action, and took her to<br/>
&gt;the bathroom.  I explained calmly that we wouldn&#39;t leave until she pooped.<br/>
&gt;She cried and cried, and even tried to bite me.  The other kids were really<br/>
&gt;supportive, and my oldest drew a picture of Betsy pooping that we hung up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the wall.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Betsy screamed and begged to go to bed, but I held my ground and started<br/>
&gt;rubbing her tummy in the &quot;I-love-you&quot; massage (I think it&#39;s in the Sear&#39;s<br/>
&gt;BABY BOOK for colic).  She screamed at me that she was going to DIE if she<br/>
&gt;pooped (?!?!) but I kept repeating that I knew she could do it, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>whenever<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I offered to leave she asked me to stay.  After over ninety minutes of<br/>
&gt;crying, she had the bigest bm I&#39;ve ever seen out of such a small child,<br/>
&gt;stopped crying immediately, and was extremely proud.  She hugged me and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>said<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;she needed to go tell her sisters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think her problem stems from one occasion when it did hurt to go, and she<br/>
&gt;just held on to that.  My oldest almost road her bike out in front of a car<br/>
&gt;when she was five and her scared her so much that she refused to cross<br/>
&gt;streets for several months.  I remember a similar experience of having to<br/>
&gt;hold her in the van while she screamed about refusing to cross the parking<br/>
&gt;lot from the car to the grocery store.  It took about forty-five minutes<br/>
&gt;before she would allow me to carry her in to the store (and come to think<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it, she was a few weeks before the age of five at the time, too.  Hmmmm.<br/>
&gt;Coincidince?) and after that catharsis she got over her fear of crossing<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;street.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry if this story is really long, and I have no idea where our potty<br/>
&gt;learning saga will go now.  But Betsy will be five in a few days, so I hope<br/>
&gt;you don&#39;t feel so alone!  I know of a woman near Pontiac, MI who is<br/>
&gt;gathering information to write a book about late trainers, her twin boys<br/>
&gt;were still in diapers at the age of five last summer.<br/>
