<div id="ygrps-yiv-367672159">5 and 7  are not old  AT  ALL   for a bedwetter......particularly boys.   I<br/>
guess that even today it remains one of those secretive things in many<br/>
communities.  Even age 12  is not particularly unusual.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 I think the larger size pull ups or nighttimes are a wonderful invention.<br/>
The time will come that they are no longer needed but,  until then,  no<br/>
reason to &quot;get concerned&quot;.   I thought that wearing the pull-ups would<br/>
prevent the mattress from getting wet?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Cleaning a mattress...instead of Febreze, you could try soaking it with one<br/>
of the enzyme preparations for biological stains.    These will take days to<br/>
work,  and then you will need to dry completely.   Bright sunlight the best<br/>
for final drying and airing but this is not really the season :-).<br/>
After  it is completely clean  (or even if you decide cleaning is hopeless)<br/>
get a zip on plastic mattress cover.   That will keep the mattress from<br/>
getting wet again as well as &quot;seal-in&quot;   any odors OR  allergens.    For<br/>
comfort you will want to have a  padded or quilted washable mattress cover.<br/>
Years ago when my children were still children :-),  we often had &quot;extras&quot;<br/>
spending the night  and tried to be matter of fact about bedwetting<br/>
situations.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
No pull-ups in those days.   We had mail ordered some night time underwear<br/>
for one of my sons but it was bulky and uncomfortable.      Our routine<br/>
solution was 1) the &quot;old-style&quot;  waterbeds with just a &quot;bag&quot;  for a mattress<br/>
and 2) liberal use of  sleeping bags with outer layer waterproof material.<br/>
3) Even comforters on top of  &quot;camp pads&quot;  provided good absorption  and<br/>
could be easily thrown in washer. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
During those years  our washer and dryer got LOTS  of use.   The nasal<br/>
sprays to suppress nighttime urination had come into use by then and we<br/>
considered it for summer camp  although were not interested in it for daily<br/>
use.    Seemed to us that the risks of routine use outweighed the<br/>
inconvenience of added laundry.    Again, Goodnights were not around then. <br/>

 <br/>
It was also found to be hereditary.  This helped ease our minds a lot,  <br/>
because my father in law said he wet the bed till he was 12 or 13.  It also  helped <br/>
my son not feel so bad when he knew grandpa struggled with it  too.  We had a <br/>
daughter that wet till she was about 8, and my son till  about 10 or so.  I <br/>
think the best advice is, plastic mattress covers, and  pullups, and let them <br/>
grow out of it.  If you can&#39;t afford pullups, we just  got the big thick <br/>
training pants, and put a small hand towel folded up in it  (bulk in front for boys, <br/>
middle for girls :o), and a pair of sleepy pants or  sweats over it.  It <br/>
worked most of the time.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think not LETTING it be a big deal is the key.  <br/>

   <br/>
  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m not sure that 5 or even 7 is too old to be wetting the bed.  My sister wet the bed until she was about 10.  Both her kids wet the bed to 7 or so, and my brother&#39;s kids until 6 or 8.  I think it just goes with the territory for some kids, whether it&#39;s bladder size, habit or whatever.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My kids haven&#39;t been long-term bedwetters, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s because we have co-slept and dh & I are very tuned in to the warning signs.  And there are often warning signs.  With my sis, it was sleep-talking.  Also true for Andy, who was dry all night (well, from about 11pm to 5 am) by 4.  With the other two boys, it&#39;s restlessness in their sleep.  We still regularly take Dan to the bathroom to pee -- in his sleep -- sometime after he falls asleep. If we put him to bed in his own room (like so many parents do) we&#39;d miss the signs and he would regularly wet the bed, but why put him thru that when we can help?  It&#39;s the loving thing to do.  <br/>
   <br/>
  How to clean the mattress?  No really good ideas there.  I would suggest that you invest in some plastic-backed mattress pads -- the kind that are soft on top, so the kids don&#39;t have to sleep on a crinkly bed.  My Mom just kept lots of towels and clean sheets handy so I could help my sister get back to bed on towels and change the sheets in the morning, and she accepted that when sis outgrew it they&#39;d buy her a new mattress.  Once I figured out that she talked when she needed to get up to pee -- and I was the ONLY one who slept lightly enough to hear her -- it became my job to help her.  If nothing else, it gave us all enough perspective that bed-wetting by our own kids has always been no biggie for us; it&#39;s just something some kids do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713960750">I concur with the others that your kids are not &quot;old enough&quot; to not be wetting the bed.  Some kids, especially boys, wet the bed well into their teens.<br/>
<br/>
I did want to mention that in my son&#39;s case, he was sleeping so soundly, he just didn&#39;t wake up when he had to go.  We bought one of those alarms that snap onto the underwear.   It goes off at the first sign of wetness.  He even slept through that (but we didn&#39;t LOL!!).  It only took about a week for him to adjust and he no longer needed it and has never wet the bed since.<br/>

be gotten at any pet or feed store. It works for kids&#39; accidents,  <br/>
too. When our older son has wet the bed, we soak the spot really well  <br/>
with enzyme deodorizer and let it dry (once or twice it has meant not  <br/>
sleeping in that bed that night). It works very well. It kept an all- <br/>
cotton futon in action for many years!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Marty wasn&#39;t dry at night until he was nine or so.  His dad had been the same way, but was <br/>
shamed and punished.<br/>
<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t have to go far to hear stories of shame and punishment from people your <br/>
own age, I&#39;m sure.  My friend Helena&#39;s grandmother used to hang the sheet on the front <br/>
fence and tell the neighbors her granddaughter was still peeing the bed even though she <br/>
was old enough not to.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about age.<br/>
<br/>
We tried things with Marty like walking him to the toilet in his sleep, and withholding <br/>
liquids before he went to bed.  Nothing helped.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the principle of the thing, though:  Sleep is important.  Drinking liquids is an <br/>
important thing (especially for desert dwellers, and for growing children).<br/>
<br/>
Pullups don&#39;t work very well (it&#39;s been a few years, but at the time the sides were very <br/>
leaky).  We used UltraPampers in the largest size.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was only at night, so that was one diaper a night.  When/if it was dry, it could <br/>
be carefully removed and reused.<br/>
<br/>
When he outgrew Pampers we got small adult diapers.<br/>
<br/>
It was MUCH better and cheaper than the cost and frustration of a load of laundry every <br/>
day (sheets, mattress pad, pajamas) and a morning shower for a child who had slept in his <br/>
own pee.   Less cruel, less frustrating, less expensive.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t really de-pee a mattress.  If the purpose of peaceful and sanitary sleep is <br/>
important, get another mattress.  Maybe find a used one, or an inexpensive one, until he&#39;s <br/>
dry.<br/>
<br/>
Waterproof mattress pads are expensive and uncomfortable.  A series of cheap mattresses <br/>
might be better.  And when each DOES totally outgrow the peeing, get a better less-cheap <br/>
mattress for him.<br/>

own pace.  Just like learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
I have one child that didn&#39;t stop until the age of 13, then overnight<br/>
just quit.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you have ruled out bladder and kidney infections and food allergies<br/>
like dairy and wheat, then it is just a matter of time.<br/>
<br/>
All of the tricks parents use to &quot;help&quot; a child stop wetting the bed<br/>
are very coercive and humiliating.  Alarms, buzzers, shocks, refusing<br/>
to let them drink after dinner...they are just cruel IMO.  Kids aren&#39;t<br/>
dogs to be trained.<br/>
<br/>
Put a mattress protector on the beds until your children stop wetting<br/>
the bed, underneath the mattress pad so it isn&#39;t noticeable.  Buy them<br/>
pull-ups, and when they are too big for pull ups, buy them Depends. <br/>
Cheerfully and matter-of-factly change their sheets when wet, and<br/>
don&#39;t make a big deal about it when they aren&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
There was about a month or two at the end where my child would wear a<br/>
Depends to bed each night &quot;just in case&quot;.  When that time was up, we<br/>
realized our bedwetting days were over with that child.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest, 7yo, will wet at night if he has ice cream after dinner,<br/>
or if he is ill and on cold medication, or if he is wearing underwear<br/>
to bed.  He says it is because the underwear feels like a pull up and<br/>
he forgets.  But he hasn&#39;t had any night-time wetting for months either.<br/>

  Marty wasn&#39;t dry at night until he was nine or so.  His dad had been the same way, but was <br/>
  shamed and punished.<br/>
<br/>
  You wouldn&#39;t have to go far to hear stories of shame and punishment from people your <br/>
  own age, I&#39;m sure.  My friend Helena&#39;s grandmother used to hang the sheet on the front <br/>
  fence and tell the neighbors her granddaughter was still peeing the bed even though she <br/>
  was old enough not to.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s not about age.<br/>
<br/>
  We tried things with Marty like walking him to the toilet in his sleep, and withholding <br/>
  liquids before he went to bed.  Nothing helped.<br/>
<br/>
  Looking at the principle of the thing, though:  Sleep is important.  Drinking liquids is an <br/>
  important thing (especially for desert dwellers, and for growing children).<br/>
<br/>
  Pullups don&#39;t work very well (it&#39;s been a few years, but at the time the sides were very <br/>
  leaky).  We used UltraPampers in the largest size.<br/>
<br/>
  The problem was only at night, so that was one diaper a night.  When/if it was dry, it could <br/>
  be carefully removed and reused.<br/>
<br/>
  When he outgrew Pampers we got small adult diapers.<br/>
<br/>
  It was MUCH better and cheaper than the cost and frustration of a load of laundry every <br/>
  day (sheets, mattress pad, pajamas) and a morning shower for a child who had slept in his <br/>
  own pee.   Less cruel, less frustrating, less expensive.<br/>
<br/>
  You can&#39;t really de-pee a mattress.  If the purpose of peaceful and sanitary sleep is <br/>
  important, get another mattress.  Maybe find a used one, or an inexpensive one, until he&#39;s <br/>
  dry.<br/>
<br/>
  Waterproof mattress pads are expensive and uncomfortable.  A series of cheap mattresses <br/>
  might be better.  And when each DOES totally outgrow the peeing, get a better less-cheap <br/>
  mattress for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032415392">My only concern with mattresses is mold, which can cause a lot of health problems.  We ran into that with my son.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure that even an enzyme cleaner will get *all* of the urine in a mattress.  Its hard to say.<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely get rid of the mattress once the bedwetting stops, and maybe before that if you put a plastic cover on the new one.  They can be found at Kmart.<br/>

My pediatrician told me that up to age 10 or 12 is not unusual.  Why would a kid wet the bed if they couldn&#39;t help it?  Both my girls used pull-ups.  They are cheap compared to mattresses and washing the bedding.  I reassured them, rather than shamed them.  They still participated in sleepovers too.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I was going to La Leche League meetings we had a discussion from time to time on &quot;old enough&quot; - to sit up, to eat, to walk, to crawl, to stop using a high chair, to stop needing mom&#39;s milk, and more.<br/>
<br/>
It was a useful exercise for pointing out that people do things when they are ready, not by the calendar.<br/>
<br/>
My girls are 10 and 13.  I still need to remind myself sometimes to consider them as individuals rather than think that they are &quot;old enough&quot; to be acting differently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639260126">My son stopped wearing Goodnites or generic nighttime pull-ups at age 9.5.<br/>
The pull-ups apparently have improved dramatically over the years, Sandra --<br/>
because they literally *never* leaked for my son in the time he wore them --<br/>
about six years. <br/>
<br/>
It was never an issue for me, but he started being a little upset about it<br/>
when got to be around 8 and *both* his younger sisters (who are 2.5 and 6<br/>
years younger than him) were able to be dry at night. Both of the girls were<br/>
dry at night before they were 2. One thing that was helpful for him was the<br/>
realization that *most* of his male friends were in the same boat. One of<br/>
his very close friends, who is a 10 months younger, wears them right now. My<br/>
son went on a sleepover a couple of years ago with a group of 7yo boys and<br/>
75 percent of them were wearing the Goodnites.<br/>

  Enzyme cleaners are a good option, but if the mattress has been urinated on repeatedly and not treated... it might be time for a new mattress. Then you buy a zip on water proof mattress cover and a thick mattress pad to cover the plastic.   <br/>
<br/>
*****Second, my kids are old enough to not be wetting the bed.******<br/>
   <br/>
  Second, your kids bladders don&#39;t know how old they are! Bladders are a smooth muscle that spasm. Some bladders spasm uncontrollably. Sometimes the urethra (the tube that carries the urine from the bladder to the outside) has a reflux problem, causing a bladder that thinks it has been emptied to fill back up. (think gastric reflux only this is urine coming back up) The first condition requires medication sometimes, most times the bladder matures on its own. The reflux problem causes accidents and infections. It requires medication, antibiotics, and sometimes surgery. And requires sonograms and cystograms to properly diagnose. And sometimes years to treat.<br/>
   <br/>
  There are other problems and causes of accidents, but the most important thing is to remember that bladders like walking, talking, reading, and life need time to mature at their own rate. And that telling a child they are too old to be wetting the bed means nothing to the bladder. Regardless if you have or have not said anything to your boys, give it some more time and patience, and if you are really worried that there might be a deeper cause than just an immature bladder, make an appointment with their doctor to discuss your worries. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-396920537">I am coming out of lurkdom to highly recommend a chiropractor.  We use one<br/>
that does Gonstead method and that is what I recommend.  We have seen<br/>
chiropractors for years and it even saved my mother from having shoulder<br/>
replacement surgery.  If you are not familiar with chiropractic treatment,<br/>
check it out.it helps so much.  My chiropractor explains it like this:<br/>
Every nerve that helps with every function of your body (heart, sinuses,<br/>
lungs, kidneys. everything) goes through the spinal column and out your<br/>
spinal cords.  If there subluxation (something out of alignment) then it<br/>
causes whatever function are effected to not function at 100%, which causes<br/>
your body to not properly heal itself.  If you have a cut, it&#39;s not the band<br/>
aide that heals it.your body heals itself.  Almost every single person has<br/>
misalignments and don&#39;t realize it.  If I have allergies, headaches or sinus<br/>
problems, I will go to my chiropractor before I do anything else.<br/>
Bedwetting is definitely something that could be caused by the spine not<br/>
being aligned properly.  I would also try water with lemon juice and all<br/>
natural juices like cranberry juice with little sugar.  Infections, even a<br/>
slight lingering one that you don&#39;t even realize is there can cause frequent<br/>
urination.  But, like some others have said, sometimes, it&#39;s just something<br/>
that is unexplainable and they will out grow.  I had a daughter who<br/>
occasionally wet the bed until about 7 yo.  Just curious.was this child a<br/>
c-section baby?  My chiropractor has some interesting info on this as well<br/>
and how it effects children by not being birthed naturally through the birth<br/>
canal.it&#39;s interesting.btw, my bed wetter was a c-section baby.  Blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649935224">Hi Kim!<br/>
   <br/>
  Others have given great responses to your questions. I just wanted to share how we waterproof our mattresses for Parker. If you get an old wool blanket, wash it in hot & dry it on high, it will be felted and act as a barrier for pee. We put that over the mattress, a thick towel on top of that and fleece blanket on top of the towel. No sheet. He sleeps in poly fleece jammies no undies or no pants at all. If he wets, the fleece draws all the moisture away from him, the towel absorbs it, and the wool won&#39;t let it through to the mattress. He stays warm and dry. The bed is protected. The wool can be aired out, and only needs to be washed every couple of weeks or so. The fleece & towel can go right in the wash. It sounds a little complicated at first, but honestly it is very comfy & easy to maintain!! Totally avoids the needs for diapers/pullups/depends (unless your kids prefer them!!). Hope this is helpful!! Tessa<br/>

more important that he gets a good night&#39;s sleep than to wake him up <br/>
throughout the night to pee (better for me too!)He wears Goodnights, <br/>
which usually work well. FWIW, he was a homebirth baby, family bedded, <br/>
etcetc. In fact we still share sleep most nights (or he is on a pallet <br/>
near the bed on the floor)....he&#39;s just a really deep sleeper. Other <br/>
than the expense of the diapers, it doesnt really bother me. My son&#39;s <br/>
paternal grandmother accused me of &quot;infantalising&quot; him by &quot;having him <br/>
wear diapers&quot;, which just seems so bizarre to me. I was never shamed <br/>
growing up, and when i wet the bed at a friend&#39;s cottage on vacation <br/>
(i was pretty mortified)SHE didnt make me feel bad either. I didnt <br/>
even realize that happened &quot;in real life&quot; until i saw the tv movie <br/>

mother put the sheets out the window to dry for everyone to see. I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762496411">When my son was still peeing in the night in bed (around age 5 or so),<br/>
and refused to wear pullups, we used those soft (cheap) mattress<br/>
covers that are sort of flannel on one side and waterproof something<br/>
on the other. I actually saw some the other day in Joann&#39;s Fabrics by<br/>
the yard.  So the cleanup itself was pretty easy, though his legs<br/>
would get all red and rashy. Morning showers helped, and we explained<br/>
the relationship between the pee in the night and the rash on his body.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I tried was telling him right before he went to sleep<br/>
to try to be aware of the pee as he was sleeping. I let him know that<br/>
some people need to get up in the night and you have to listen to your<br/>
body, even as you sleep, to know if you have to get up. Waking him up<br/>
to pee was not helpful: the one time I tried it he just got mad at me<br/>
and refused to go anyway. But helping him be aware that not everyone<br/>
really makes it through the night (though everyone else in our family<br/>
happens to), was useful.<br/>

 <br/>
No they&#39;re not.  If they&#39;re still wetting, there&#39;s probably a  physiological <br/>
reason.  Lots of children wet the bed until they&#39;re much  older.  My brother <br/>
and my husband both wet until they were 13.  I wet  the bed until I was 7, and <br/>
I would probably have done it later if I had not been  shamed that summer by <br/>
my much older cousin.<br/>
 <br/>
Wetting the bed is a fact of life for some kids (none of mine wet the bed  <br/>
for some reason, even though the odds were stacked against them--genes and  <br/>
gender).  It&#39;s better to help them not be ashamed, to encourage them about  the <br/>
day when it will be a past thing for them, and to put plastic sheets on the  <br/>
mattresses and pull-ups on their bottoms for as long as it takes for their  <br/>
bladders to mature.<br/>
 <br/>
The thing is, we call it &quot;wetting the bed&quot;, but it&#39;s not that.  It&#39;s  bladder <br/>
immaturity or some other kind of developmental brain thing (that&#39;s what  it <br/>
was for me).  If you don&#39;t want your beds peed on, then protect the  beds.  But <br/>
don&#39;t shame the children.  The goal is nighttime  dryness.  It will come.<br/>

My daughter-in-law has been putting wool pants on my grandson over his  cloth <br/>
diapers.  Every so often she puts more lanolin in them with some  process.  <br/>
But I just read online about a woman who crochets her own  &quot;soakers&quot; and when <br/>
it seems they&#39;re leaking a little she just rubs more lanolin  in.<br/>
 <br/>
I imagine a wool blanket used for this purpose wouldn&#39;t lose its lanolin as  <br/>
often as baby diapers that are changed frequently, but adding lanolin would be <br/>
a  way to make it more waterproof.<br/>

That was such a sad movie.  It&#39;s old, and I don&#39;t think it got into  the fact <br/>
that it&#39;s normal to wet the bed, but I think it did some good by  showing the <br/>
mom (who would flip out over it) as what she was, an abuser.   Might have <br/>
saved a few kids some humiliation at the hands of their parents by  showing it&#39;s <br/>
NOT OK to shame their kid over bedwetting.  <br/>
 <br/>
My mom had a friend who punished her daughter for bedwetting.  She  told <br/>
everyone that Bobbie wet the bed.  My mom&#39;s friend was very upset  by the movie.  <br/>
I never found out if it helped but I think the public  humiliation of her <br/>
daughter stopped.  <br/>

And if you don&#39;t want to do the wool blanket system, Bed, Bath and Beyond<br/>
sells a washable bed pad (absorbent on one side with a water proof backing)<br/>
that we used under Jayn in bed, and also under her when she was napping on<br/>
the sofa. This is similar to the disposable ones that are available through<br/>
any drug store, but more comfortable and less plasticy.<br/>

  *****<br/>
   <br/>
  We would be/have been just fine with using goodnights or some other products, had our boys been willing to use them.  With all three, as soon as they were out of diapers during the day, they insisted on being out of diapers at night, too.  I tried with each, offering diapers, pull-ups, etc.  No way.  In their minds, big boys didn&#39;t wear diapers, day or night (not something I ever said to any of them, just what they absorbed from friends, etc).  They&#39;ve all been really good about being taken to the toilet in their sleep, and very manageable so it&#39;s no big deal.  Besides that, they all sleep right thru it.<br/>

box...  Wipe the mattress (stained area) with a damp cloth, then sprinkle<br/>
the area with borax and rub it in a bit... let it dry, and vacuum it up. I<br/>
have had it work on some seriously soaked mattresses, and it didn&#39;t take<br/>

about allergies and bedwetting that really fits here... something about<br/>
inflammation making the bladder hold less liquid, so that it is a good deal<br/>
harder to hold urine, especially when asleep. I&#39;ll look it up and post it<br/>

couldn&#39;t find it online, lol... EVERYTHING is online, doggone it!)<br/>
<br/>
I know that I personally wet the bed until I was mmph years old (double<br/>

enough, without shaming from adults... I remember waking up wet, even though<br/>
I thought that I *HAD* gone to the bathroom ... turns out that I had dreamed<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Marty was also a sleepwalker.  He still talks in his sleep sometimes,  <br/>
just as clearly as if he were awake.<br/>
He would get up and walk toward the outside, and when he realized  <br/>
(somehow, it seemed) that he wasn&#39;t in the bed he would kind of  <br/>
panic.  Or maybe the panicky feeling was what caused him to get up.<br/>
<br/>
We would go where he was and just talk to him soothingly and guide  <br/>
him back to bed and stay with him a while (or ask if he needed to pee  <br/>
or whatever, but he wasn&#39;t really awake and asking him questions  <br/>
sometimes made the panic come back because he didn&#39;t know the answer).<br/>
<br/>
As he got older and became more aware of all that, he realized that  <br/>
sometimes he had that feeling when he was awake, or started to have  <br/>
it.  And it seemed to him to be times when he had been really busy or  <br/>
distracted for a long time, or playing a game for a long time, and  <br/>
hadn&#39;t eaten.  So he started having protein snacks later at night,  <br/>
and in the daytime if he has that feeling (kind of like weird  <br/>
auditory effects) he&#39;ll go and eat something with protein in it, and  <br/>
drink more water.  That might not be the entire cause and effect, but  <br/>
whether that&#39;s it or not it seems to help, and he figured it out on  <br/>
his own.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it has directly to do with peeing the bed, except just  <br/>
that Marty was *so* asleep once he was asleep that standing up and  <br/>
walking around wouldn&#39;t even wake him up, so having a wet bed wasn&#39;t  <br/>
going to.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents don&#39;t mind that the kid is uncomfortable or cold or gets  <br/>
a rash, because they say then he&#39;ll learn to stop peeing the bed  <br/>
sooner.  I think they&#39;re wrong.  It&#39;s not a learning thing, it&#39;s a  <br/>
developmental thing, and wishing discomfort or pain or unhealth on a  <br/>
child defeats the purpose of parenting and sleep, in my way of  <br/>
thinking.   I WANT my children to be warm, comfortable, safe and  <br/>
healthy when it&#39;s just as easy as the other, and even when it&#39;s harder.<br/>
