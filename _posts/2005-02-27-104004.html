<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919658844">I  was wondering what some thoughts were on some concerns I have about my 7 <br/>
year old son.  I have always wanted to homeschool, and was drawn to <br/>
unschooling.  I feel it has worked well for us.  My son has always been a <br/>
smart, mature in some ways, curious child.  I have always seen  him learning <br/>
through life.  The whole family has learned so much through his interests.  <br/>
He has always been a high need child, very resistant to change, and hard to <br/>
measure.<br/>
<br/>
Recently he has not been interested in anything, except video games.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go anywhere.  He would play games all day if I let him, and <br/>
that would be fine if he limited himself and didn&#39;t become rude.  So <br/>
recently I will have him not play during the day and be able to play in the <br/>
evening when his dad is home from work (they play together then).  But he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do anything, and this is new.  New, meaning since December.  <br/>
My husband had been overseas for 2.5 months and came home then.  That is <br/>
when the xbox came into our lives.  Before then my son certainly did not <br/>
want to sit down and do lessons, but I saw his natural curiosity at work.  I <br/>
feel that he has anger at his dad being gone, and the challenges that <br/>
situation created.  Then his dad is home and they have this great new toy.  <br/>
And that toy is a way of connecting with dad again.<br/>
<br/>
So I wonder if this will pass or if I need to do something more active.  He <br/>
does not read, and that is fine usually.  I previously felt that he would <br/>
want to learn when the time was right.  That is a hard one for me.  As much <br/>
as I don&#39;t want it to matter, it does.  I don&#39;t want to measure his <br/>
intelligence or measure our homeschooling success on reading, but I keep <br/>
coming back to it.  He has no interest in learning either, he says it will <br/>
be too hard.  He rejects anything where he thinks someone is trying to teach <br/>
him something.<br/>
<br/>
On the positive side I have seen him be very confident in what he knows.  I <br/>
have heard him tell people &quot;I homeschool, I figure things out for myself, I <br/>
taught myself how to swim, etc&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else ever been through this?  I would like to hear from others <br/>
who have had children with this type do learning style and hear what worked <br/>
for them.  Also I have a 3 year old and 8 month old daughters.<br/>

take breaks. He needs to decide for himself if they&#39;re worth it or not.<br/>
Sometimes being grumpy may be worth it! But you can remind him with &quot;Nice<br/>
voice please&quot; that choosing to be grumpy doesn&#39;t mean he has to grump at<br/>
you. He can choose to be nice regardless of how he&#39;s chosen to feel.)<br/>

My daughter has had braces for 2 years. She hasn&#39;t been able to eat carrots.<br/>
She has been able to eat candy because we don&#39;t limit it. (She eats way less<br/>
than I do!) When she went to get her braces off she took a container of<br/>
carrots with her. At the end of her appointment they handed her a bag of<br/>
candy as a special treat. She didn&#39;t open the bag. She had carrots in the<br/>
car. In fact the bag still hasn&#39;t been opened after 4 days (and there&#39;s some<br/>
good stuff in there too!)<br/>

<br/>
A varation of this I use with my 5 year old is to ask he if she is using a nice loving voice or a rude voice . Then I tell her how much I like it when she speaks to me in a nice loving voice. <br/>
<br/>
If she has been doing something like playing her v-smile for a long time I might ask .....Do you think you might be a little grumpy because you havent eaten in a while? or because you need to stretch and jump a little ? ( we have a little mini trampoline for sensory issues and blowing off extra energy) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716598672">&quot;He would play games all day if I let him, <br/>

play during the day and be able to play in the <br/>
evening when his dad is home from work (they play<br/>
together then).&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Confessions of an over-strewer: If my child shows an<br/>
interest in, say, games, I try to get my hands on<br/>
every game I think she might find interesting.  It is<br/>
too bad, but I have squelched a couple interests just<br/>
by strewing too much!  (This is not true for fairy<br/>
tales or Barbies, though.)  There has got to be a<br/>
happy medium.<br/>
<br/>
When Sophia was really little, probably 2 or 3, she<br/>
loved the TV.  So, instead of really trying to get her<br/>
to do other things, which was my first approach<br/>
(&quot;Wannacaolorgotothezooplaythisgamegoseegrammagoseedaddy...&quot;),<br/>
I tried to find all the shows I thought she&#39;d like,<br/>
and literally, for about a month, she did little<br/>
besides watch TV.  I took most of her meals and snacks<br/>
to the TV room and I gave her comfy blankies and I set<br/>
dolls and animals near her and I looked up her<br/>
favorite characters using the Internet and guess what?<br/>
 She got bored!  She had seen the shows, and for<br/>
awhile, she didn&#39;t watch much TV.  <br/>
<br/>
I love to knit...well, sometimes.  I sort of<br/>
over-knitted and got a little bored, but at first I<br/>
knit as much as I could.  I taught myself from a book<br/>
and I was really proud of myself.  If my husband said,<br/>
&quot;Sarah, if you knit all the time, you won&#39;t learn<br/>
anything else and you won&#39;t see the sunshine and your<br/>
fingers will get blistery and your eyeballs will start<br/>
to ooze,&quot; well, I would be annoyed with him and I<br/>
would probably try to knit in secret or something. <br/>
But he didn&#39;t say that.  He really loved the things I<br/>
made and he was really proud and he supported me, and<br/>
the passion eventually became a good hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m on to precious metal clay...and my husband<br/>
built me a work table...<br/>
<br/>
BUT, if I would have kept knitting and if Sophia was<br/>
still watching 12 hours of TV a day...would those<br/>
interests be less valid?<br/>
<br/>
My husband started sluffing school at 13.  You know<br/>
what he did?  He played video games and more video<br/>
games.  He quit going to school at 14.  He started<br/>
reading lots of books and taught himself to play<br/>
guitar, but mainly he played with the computer.  He<br/>
taught himself a little about programming.  He never<br/>
did get his fill of computers.<br/>
<br/>
When he went back to school at age 22, he had to learn<br/>
a bit of math, but ended up with a computer<br/>
programming degree.  He makes a pretty decent living. <br/>
I&#39;m glad he spent a lot of time playing with<br/>
computers.<br/>
<br/>
In writing all this, I really just wanted to say, your<br/>
son will like you more and your house will be more<br/>
peaceful if you help him play *more* computer games. <br/>
Who knows...it might turn into a career.  Or, he might<br/>
get totally bored.  But he&#39;ll get to decide! And it is<br/>
a lucky kid who gets to decide what he loves.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is important.<br/>
 <br/>
I know these ideas are foreign to people who were raised with lots of rules  <br/>
and &quot;safeties&quot; and controls.  It seems wrong to say &quot;Let him have more of  <br/>
what you fear.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
He might not make a career of it, and he might not even get tired of it,  but <br/>
it&#39;s a big part of understand learning to realize that when a child (or  <br/>
anyone) is engrossed in an activity, others don&#39;t know and can&#39;t know what  <br/>
they&#39;re thinking or learning.  And ultimately it&#39;s none of anyone else&#39;s  business.  <br/>
If you&#39;re lucky and if you have a good relationship with your  child, he&#39;ll <br/>
share those thoughts and ideas with you.  If he feels you&#39;re  an adversary <br/>
rather than a partner, he will share less.  But the learning  your children do <br/>
will not all be shared with you, and the sooner you know that  and that you come <br/>
to peace with the idea, embrace it, welcome it, revel in it,  the sooner you <br/>
can relax about wha tthey do and for how long they do it.   The confidence that <br/>
they are always learning will infuse you and your  life.  Then it&#39;s easy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757570078">thank you all for the input.  We talked about it and are letting him take <br/>
the lead with the game playing.  I am seeing the benefits and the things he <br/>
has learned from them.  I realized I had a fear that didn&#39;t necessarily have <br/>
anything to do with my son.  My dh comes from a family that is rampant with <br/>
alcoholism and other addictions as well.  I believe seeing my son not be <br/>
able to do or want to do anything else caused me to fear that he would grow <br/>
up to be that way too.  I am hoping that allowing him to make his own <br/>
decisions and take responsiblity for himself and growing up in an <br/>
unschooling environment will give the tools to succeed.  I still really want <br/>
to see him do some other things, and from looking back I know he will when <br/>
the time is right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407578634">I just wanted to share something I noticed in my own language and thinking<br/>
lately.  I&#39;ve become aware that I&#39;m not entirely comfortable with using the<br/>
words &quot;let&quot; and &quot;allow&quot; when talking about our plans for living with our<br/>
long-awaited child (still in utero).<br/>
<br/>
I used to describe unschooling to others as a situation in which parents<br/>
&quot;let&quot; the child learn in freedom.  Now that&#39;s starting to leave a bad taste<br/>
in my mouth.  I&#39;m now more likely to leave the parents&#39; authority out of the<br/>
definition and to focus on what the learner does and how she interacts with<br/>
those around her.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we will be &quot;letting&quot; our child pursue her own learning path.  We<br/>
could impose our will and force her to do otherwise because we&#39;re bigger and<br/>
stronger and the law gives us more power.  Joe (my husband) is more for<br/>
being blunt.  I like to say we &quot;adopted&quot; our dog (from the shelter).  He<br/>
likes to say we &quot;bought&quot; her because we paid the $30 fee.  He&#39;s very much a<br/>

I let my sons pursue their own interests because I keep them home and <br/>
provide them that environment vs sending them to public school.  We do <br/>
&quot;allow&quot; them to learn in freedom, because without our intervening on <br/>
their behalf they would be subjected to hours sitting in a classroom <br/>
being forced to learn in someone else&#39;s prescribed way, in a prescribed <br/>
time and someone else&#39;s agenda.  Because we are the adults we &quot;provide&quot; <br/>
that privilege for them.  Because the power/control to send them to <br/>
school or not send them to school is mine, I do &quot;let&quot; him stay home.  It <br/>
is a privilege I afford them given the rules of our society.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I used to describe unschooling to others as a situation in which parents<br/>
&quot;let&quot; the child learn in freedom.  Now that&#39;s starting to leave a bad taste<br/>
in my mouth.  I&#39;m now more likely to leave the parents&#39; authority out of the<br/>
definition and to focus on what the learner does and how she interacts with<br/>
those around her. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I usually say that I help them do what they want to do, but there is a REAL, <br/>
legal &quot;letting&quot; going on.  I don&#39;t have to help them.  I don&#39;t have to let <br/>
them.   But I&#39;m choosing too.<br/>
<br/>
While there&#39;s an advantage to wording things in a way to empower children, <br/>
there might be a corresponding danger in forgetting or in them never knowing <br/>
that they have received a big privilege withou our culture, having parents who <br/>
forego their right and duty (hard to forget our duty to take care of our kids) <br/>
to follow a different path.<br/>
<br/>
If something happens to parents, the surviving children&#39;s rights are then <br/>
subject to other adults&#39; rights and duties and they might have no interested in <br/>
or inkling of the arrangement the parents had made with the child, let alone <br/>
the arrangements the parents had made in their own heads to tweak language and <br/>
thought and definition.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t define away all cultural realitie, nor do I think we should.  We can <br/>
give our kids the option of staying home instead of going to school, but we <br/>
can&#39;t change the fact that without our willingness and cooperation, they would <br/>
not have a choice.  We gave them the choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=We could impose our will and force her to do otherwise because we&#39;re bigger <br/>
and<br/>
stronger and the law gives us more power. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The law gives you responsibilities that you can&#39;t just blow off without mom.  <br/>
It&#39;s not such a simple &quot;NOT doing,&quot; there&#39;s a big deep DOING.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Joe (my husband) is more for<br/>
being blunt.  I like to say we &quot;adopted&quot; our dog (from the shelter).  He<br/>
likes to say we &quot;bought&quot; her because we paid the $30 fee.  He&#39;s very much a<br/>
call-it-what-it-is person, and I tend to prettify the language to put the<br/>
focus where I want it.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Putting the focus where you want it is central to communications.  A very <br/>
simple sentence such as &quot;Are you riding with me to Denver?&quot; can have its meaning <br/>
changed deeply by which word is emphasized.  Seven different meanings to the <br/>
same sentence, with no more than a stressed word.<br/>
<br/>
It costs money (way more than $30) to adopt a child.  If you adopt, will your <br/>
husband like to say he &quot;bought&quot; the child?   <br/>
<br/>
Language is WELL worth examining and guarding, but we can&#39;t bend reality with <br/>
it.<br/>

There&#39;s something about the difference between &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn.&quot;  Lots of <br/>
people come new to homeschooling or unschooling and claim not to understand <br/>
the difference, or say that teaching IS necessary, you might just not call it <br/>
teaching and it&#39;s just semantics, and they&#39;re not going to waste their time with <br/>
trivial word choices.  But in that FLOOD of defensive language, what they&#39;re <br/>
saying is that they don&#39;t want to think about it very deeply.   Without deep <br/>
thought and examination, unschooling is a waterbug that never gets below the <br/>
surface of the flood of ideas and words to real understanding.<br/>
<br/>
So I salute you, Julie in NY who hasnt&#39; had a baby yet, for wanting to move <br/>
beyond &quot;letting&quot; him do this or that, but stay on your feet and know that you <br/>
DO have authority and (at least linguistically speaking, and you will hope <br/>
legally speaking) even ownership of this child to some extent.  He will be YOUR <br/>
son.   So each choice you make is yours and each time you give him the reins to <br/>
make a choice, they were your reins to give.<br/>

Thanks, Sandra.  Your response to my thoughts on using &quot;let&quot; and &quot;allow&quot;<br/>
inspired another thread.  I&#39;ve responded to the language issues in another<br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
Considering the cultural realities makes me think of John Holt&#39;s book _The<br/>
End of Childhood_, in which he argues for expanded rights for young people<br/>
(if I&#39;m recalling correctly).  What do all of you think about working to<br/>
legislate freedom for young people, at least incrementally?  A waste of<br/>
time?  Can&#39;t be accomplished through legislation?  I have been focusing more<br/>
on the changes I can make in my own life because of disillusionment with the<br/>
political process, but our laws certainly don&#39;t respect young people.  Also<br/>
wondering if you know any young people who have expressed an interest in<br/>
changing laws related to their rights.<br/>

This is a good point.  Being positive vs. not losing sight of the world as<br/>

would be the best candidates for respecting kids...arrggh!  That&#39;s a hard<br/>
one!<br/>

<br/>
An interesting question!  I think in most cases he would say &quot;adopt.&quot;  But<br/>
if he wants to question something, he might say &quot;bought&quot; to inspire further<br/>
discussion.  Maybe if we chose to adopt from country X because it was easier<br/>
and cheaper, he might look at it as a market decision and use the word<br/>
&quot;bought&quot; in certain situations and with certain people to be provocative.<br/>
(Only with those people who would enjoy a good discussion about questioning<br/>
the motives behind and the issues surrounding our decision.)<br/>
<br/>
I think he says &quot;bought&quot; more often in relation to our dog because we&#39;re<br/>
aware of how animals are treated as commodities, and we talk about it<br/>
frequently.  A recent conversation evolved from congratulating ourselves on<br/>
the fact our dog has a much better life than the dog next door to discussing<br/>
how much of a prisoner Fern (our dog) is.  So I think he still says &quot;bought&quot;<br/>
as a reminder to me that we don&#39;t live in my personal dreamworld, as far as<br/>
the treatment of animals is concerned.  They&#39;re still very much a commodity<br/>
to be bought, sold, and profited from.  I say &quot;adopt&quot; with a beatific smile;<br/>
he grins sardonically and tosses back &quot;bought&quot; to remind me that we&#39;re not<br/>
living on Planet Happy. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Language is WELL worth examining and guarding, but we can&#39;t bend reality<br/>
with it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  This is one of those sentences I will keep in the back of my head<br/>
and return to from time to time.  Can we?  Can&#39;t we?  Maybe we can!  I&#39;m<br/>
thinking of Orwell&#39;s _1984_ here, not the most positive example.  But those<br/>
in charge of language did control perceived reality, changing history daily.<br/>
Does language typically labeled as &quot;PC&quot; help to usher in a new reality,<br/>
reflect real changes in society, or does it just annoy people?  And going<br/>
back to my own example of &quot;let&quot; and &quot;allow,&quot; if I use language reflecting<br/>
freedom when speaking with grandparents and others about my child, might it<br/>
influence their interaction with young people in some subtle way?  I really<br/>
have no idea.  Just pondering at this point.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; There&#39;s something about the difference between &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;learn.&quot;  Lots<br/>
of people come new to homeschooling or unschooling and claim not to<br/>
understand the difference, or say that teaching IS necessary, you might just<br/>
not call it teaching and it&#39;s just semantics, and they&#39;re not going to waste<br/>
their time with trivial word choices.  But in that FLOOD of defensive<br/>
language, what they&#39;re saying is that they don&#39;t want to think about it very<br/>
deeply.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just came to this realization on another unschooling list.  I was talking<br/>
about how teaching is one part of unschooling and how I invited my mom to<br/>
teach me to crochet, but another poster helped me recognize the difference<br/>
between learning (information getting through) and teaching (tossing it out<br/>
there and hoping it sticks).  I realized that in my case, I had been<br/>
equating teaching with learning. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; So I salute you, Julie in NY who hasnt&#39; had a baby yet, for wanting to<br/>
move beyond &quot;letting&quot; him do this or that, but stay on your feet and know<br/>
that you DO have authority and (at least linguistically speaking, and you<br/>
will hope legally speaking) even ownership of this child to some extent.  He<br/>
will be YOUR son.   So each choice you make is yours and each time you give<br/>
him the reins to make a choice, they were your reins to give.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I will keep this in mind.  I love discussing language issues, so thanks<br/>
again for your thoughtful response!<br/>
  <br/>

However, even within your own children&#39;s lives, you can give them so<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775230734">***John Holt&#39;s book _The End of Childhood_, ***<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Escape From Childhood: The Needs and Rights of Children&quot;   Maybe my<br/>
favorite Holt book and the one apparently completely ignored by those who<br/>
want to claim John Holt never thought unschooling could encompass all of<br/>
life.   It was published by Dutton in 1974, it&#39;s an amazing book.  There<br/>
was some recent discussion here about one of Sandra&#39;s talks where she<br/>
encourages people to think dangerous thoughts.  This book is full of<br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
From page 1:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is a book about young people and their place, or lack of place, in<br/>
modern society.  It is about the institution of modern childhood, the<br/>
attitudes, customs, and laws that define and locate children in modern<br/>
life and determine to a large degree what their lives are like and how<br/>
we, their elders, treat them.  And it is about the many ways in which<br/>
modern childhood seems to me to be bad for most of those who live within<br/>
it and how it should and might be changed. <br/>
<br/>
For a long time it never occurred to me to question this institution. <br/>
Only in recent years did I begin to wonder whether there might be other<br/>
or better ways for young people to live.  By now I have come to feel that<br/>
the fact of being a &quot;child,&quot; of being wholly subservient and dependent,<br/>
of being seen by older people as a mixture of expensive nuisance, slave,<br/>
and superpet, does most young people more harm than good.  <br/>
<br/>
I propose instead that the rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities<br/>
of adults citizens be made *available* to any young person, of whatever<br/>
age, who wants to make use of them.  These would include, among others:<br/>
<br/>
1. The right to equal treatment a the hands of the law- ie., the right,<br/>
in any situation, to be treated no worse than an adult would be.<br/>
2. The right to vote, and take full part in political affairs.<br/>
3. The right to be legally responsible for one&#39;s life and acts.<br/>
4. The right to work, for money.<br/>
5. The right to privacy.<br/>
6. The right to financial independence and responsibility-ie., the right<br/>
to own, buy, and sell property, to borrow money, establish credit, sign<br/>
contracts, etc. <br/>
7. The right to direct and manage one&#39;s own education.<br/>
8. The right to travel, to live away from home, to choose or make one&#39;s<br/>
own home.<br/>
9. The right to receive from the state whatever minimum income it may<br/>
guarantee to adults citizens.<br/>
10. The right to make and enter into, on basis of mutual consent,<br/>
quasi-familial relationships outside one&#39;s immediate family-ie., the<br/>
right to seek and choose guardians other than one&#39;s own parents and to be<br/>
legally dependent on them.<br/>
11. The right to do, in general, what any adult may legally do. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***What do all of you think about working to<br/>
legislate freedom for young people, at least incrementally?  A waste of<br/>
time?  Can&#39;t be accomplished through legislation? ***<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a waste of time.  Things have to change.  <br/>
<br/>
In the recent Supreme court decision which found the juvenile death<br/>
penalty unconstitutional, Justice O&#39;Connor, one of two dissenting<br/>
opinions, said this:<br/>
<br/>
She said: <br/>
&quot;...The court&#39;s analysis is premised on differences in the aggregate<br/>
between juveniles and adults, which frequently do not hold true when<br/>
comparing individuals,&quot; <br/>
<br/>
She said:<br/>
&quot;Chronological age is not an<br/>
unfailing measure of psychological development, and common experience<br/>
suggests that many 17-year-olds are more mature than the average young<br/>
&#39;adult.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A supreme court Justice saying age is not the best factor for determining<br/>
a persons ability to understand and accept responsibility would seem a<br/>
step toward recognizing the rights of all Americans.  Unfortunately the<br/>
questioning of arbitrary age limits occurs primarily when adults are<br/>
making decisions about how to punish kids.  <br/>
<br/>
People are afraid of children&#39;s rights issues in the way people are<br/>
always afraid to give power to the powerless.  What dreadful fate awaits<br/>
the oppressors when the oppressed are finally given their constitutional<br/>
freedoms?  <br/>
