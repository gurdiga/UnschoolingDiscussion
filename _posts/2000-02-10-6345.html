<div id="ygrps-yiv-444502312">Anybody know of any homeschooling groups in Mississippi?  My dad has to<br/>
stay in MS because of his job, but my mom is thinking about taking the<br/>
kids (she still has four living at home) back to California because the<br/>
schools are so much better there.  I&#39;ve discussed homeschooling (and<br/>
unschooling) with her, but she still thinks that homeschooling is doing<br/>
assignments at the kitchen table all day long.  So, if there are any<br/>
groups that anyone is aware of - my family is in Collinsville - near<br/>
Meridian - please let me know.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
