<div id="ygrps-yiv-759394375">Hi beth!<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of the Oak Meadow curriculum manuals and books.  I use them<br/>
to read over and implement the projects in our time.  I think they have a<br/>
wonderful philosophy about the growth of children.  The heart of learning is<br/>
a very good book that they publish.  I am thinking about getting the manual<br/>
for 5th grade social studies because my son is interested in the American<br/>
Revolution after listening to Johnny Tremaine (we rented it from the library<br/>
a few weeks back).  He is not begging to learn about the revolution, but<br/>
while the idea is here, I am going to run with it as long as it seems to<br/>
spark an interest.  I don&#39;t know if this is true &quot;unschooling&quot;, but it works<br/>
for us!  :)<br/>

&gt; Mary Ellen,<br/>
&gt; The only preschool experience I ever wanted my kids to enjoy was the<br/>
Waldorf<br/>
&gt; school they really  have a clue about children&#39;s development and needs in<br/>
&gt; the Kindergarten  too bad they don&#39;t take that philosophy with them<br/>
however.<br/>
&gt; No rushing or spending full days there for most of those kids mine went 2<br/>
am<br/>
&gt; a week for a few months till I realized I couldn&#39;t afford it and I loved<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; hang with them there. Does anyone here combine the Oak Meadow stuff with<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; unschooling philosophy? Just curious I know they are very structured their<br/>
&gt; curriculum and teacher directed but I wonder if there is a way to use the<br/>
&gt; stuff they do without spending all the money just to get inspired. I want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; learn how to play the recorder and also knit and think if I do it myself<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; kids may want to join me which is the Waldorf Kindergarten philosophy and<br/>
&gt; Native American of being a role model but carry it over to other aspects<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; life using story telling and teaching writing through art in a child<br/>
&gt; centered way.<br/>

That is a great example of taking from a traditional curriculum for<br/>
unschooling your son. Thanks for sharing this Mary Ellen.  I think we do<br/>
have a responsibility to run with whatever their interests are no matter<br/>
what  resources we do have available but I am interested in knowing how Oak<br/>
Meadow presents this history and if he enjoys it. Please feel free to let us<br/>
know more when you do get it and see how or if it continues to spark his<br/>
interest.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
