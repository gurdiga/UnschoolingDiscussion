<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426308374"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I found the same to be true when I started homeschooling (a whole 3<br/>
&gt; months ago) LOL!  I also live in Washington State, in Des Moines.  I<br/>
&gt; found a fun group in Maple Valley.  They are not strictly<br/>
&gt; unschooling, but definately unschool friendly.  What part of<br/>
&gt; Washington are you in?  I have two children, boy 9 and girl 7.  We<br/>
&gt; are also spiritual agnostics and the first group of homeschoolers we<br/>
&gt; met were fundamental Christians.  I joined a Yahoo message board<br/>
&gt; called Washingtonunschoolers and met some nice people there.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; how I heard about the Maple Valley group.  I look forward to talking<br/>
&gt; to you some more.  Us unschoolers in Washington State need to plan a<br/>
&gt; statewide event where we can get together:)<br/>

We are in Puyallup. Let&#39;s correspond privately and see what we can put<br/>
together. Maybe we can even grow into our own &quot;conference/convention.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you are talking about the WHO convention, I can share some of the thought<br/>
process that went into selecting the workshops. As a side note, though,<br/>
attendence (at the paid convention) was down by quite a bit this year. This<br/>
was also the case at another conference I attended recently as a vendor. My<br/>
opinion: the great homeschooler roundup is underway, with alt ed/cover<br/>
schools picking the independents off one by one. People are falling for the<br/>
financial bribes and &quot;ease of use&quot; arguments.<br/>
