<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015077754">I just heard an unbelievable story through a friend of a friend. This persons son has some developmental <br/>
<br/>
delays.He is almost one and fully breastfed and thriving on it. They were at a speech therapist(which seems <br/>
<br/>
bizarre to me in itself) and the therapist is very concerned because the child is not on solids yet. Her concern is <br/>
<br/>
that they will miss the window of opportunity for solids and his eating and his speech will be affected. This story <br/>
<br/>
made me groan, chuckle and be amazed that someone could truly think this. The other funny picture was the one <br/>
<br/>
conjured in my head of a twenty year old who still has to be breastfed because he missed the window of <br/>
<br/>
opportunity.HAHAHA<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s crazy!  I would have laughed right in the therapist&#39;s face.  <br/>
And when I got done laughing, I would have said, &quot;If he misses the <br/>
window of opportunity for solids, he&#39;ll just drink Ensure for the <br/>
rest of his life!&quot;  A lot of &quot;experts&quot; could improve themselves a <br/>
great deal by getting out and going for a walk in the fresh air.<br/>

OH MY GOD!!! And he will be like one of those adults who never ever learned <br/>
to eat solid food but who drink all the time.  At bars.<br/>
<br/>
No, wait.  Even they will eat pretzels or popcorn.  Sometimes a sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  What was the guy TALKING ABOUT!?   &quot;Window of opportunity...&quot;<br/>

What a goof.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-214354597">I just have to respond to this one.  My 6.5 year old daughter was 100%<br/>
breastfed until around 18 months.  There was NOTHING anyone could do to<br/>
talk her into taking a bite of solid food.  It just wasn&#39;t going to<br/>
happen.  This included all medicines, etc., too.  One time we attempted<br/>
to give her tylenol- she still has never had any medicine to this day. <br/>
I read a medical study showing how if babies were allowed to eat the<br/>
foods that they choose, the more likely they were to not have any food<br/>
allergies.  A different study said that the longer you waited to<br/>
introduce solids to a child genetically disposed for food allergies, the<br/>
more likely they will not have any.  Lots of food allergies run in both<br/>
mine and DH&#39;s families.  My daughter who refused to eat solid foods<br/>
until 18 months is allergic to NOTHING so far as we can tell.  She knew<br/>
when her body would be able to handle different foods and I am so<br/>
thankful that we always listened.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she is my early talker.  She said her first word around 6 months<br/>
old.  We wrote down all her words on her first birthday and we got 104. <br/>
She was talking in complete sentences at a year, often run-ons that were<br/>
14+ words.  Breastfeeding makes the jaw stronger.  Anyone suggesting<br/>
otherwise is ignorant on the topic.<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  I hesitate to bring the following up because it sounds like a<br/>
brag, but I will in order to show all sides of reading development.  She<br/>
was/is also an early reader.  She started reading when she was 2 and she<br/>
currently goes through more books that I can keep track of.  She loves<br/>
to use them all as resource books, so she wants to keep most of what she<br/>
reads.  We spend a lot of money on books.  She easily reads and<br/>
comprehends on an adult level and it is hard to find books where the<br/>
content is appropriate for her, yet the language isn&#39;t too easy that she<br/>
reads the book in less than an hour.  She loves books like the Mary-Kate<br/>
and Ashley detective series ones and I buy them for her, but they only<br/>
last an hour or so (she does love to reread them and refer to them for<br/>
quotes).  She has read all the Harry Potter books three times each.  She<br/>
can read the first three in one day each and the fourth in two days.  I,<br/>
similarly, was a very early reader (truly reading books and maps at 3). <br/>
No one &quot;taught&quot; my daughter nor myself how to read, we both seemed to<br/>
just be born thinking that way.  My second daughter thinks in a<br/>
completely different and wonderfully unique way.</div>
