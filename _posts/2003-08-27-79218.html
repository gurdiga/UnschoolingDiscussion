<div id="ygrps-yiv-239944906">I received this in my mail this morning. I thought I&#39;d try to help--but since <br/>
the Southeast is not on her itinerary, I figured I&#39;d forward it here. Maybe <br/>
some of y&#39;all could help her out. Contact her directly @  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jdawson@...">jdawson@...</a><br/>

Hi,<br/>
I&#39;ve been corresponding with Linda, a homeschool mom from New Zealand <br/>
whose family will be traveling in the USA in September. They lean <br/>
toward unschooling. Teens might enjoy interviewing this family for <br/>
your newsletter!<br/>
<br/>
I thought some listmates here might also know of homeschooling <br/>
conferences, picnics, or other events in the states the family will <br/>
be visiting. If so, please contact Linda directly at <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jdawson@...">jdawson@...</a>&gt;. I&#39;m posting her message below. In addition, I <br/>
wondered if anyone knows of some archery-related events in the states <br/>
they will be visiting, since Linda&#39;s son is an avid archer.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>

Linda&#39;s message:<br/>
Hi, my name is Linda and I live in Christchurch, New Zealand with my <br/>
husband and three children, ages 15, 12 and 6. We have been <br/>
homeschooling for eight years.<br/>
<br/>
In September we are travelling to the US. We will be travelling in a <br/>
rental car and staying in hotels/motels along the way. We plan to <br/>
visit San Diego, Tijuana, Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, Denver, Nebraska, <br/>
Devils Tower, Mt Rushmore, Montana, Little Bighorn battlefield, <br/>
Yellowstone NP, Salt Lake City, Carson City, San Francisco, Kings <br/>
Canyon and back to Los Angeles and maybe Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any homeschoolers in the areas we are headed to? It would <br/>
be nice to meet up with some of you.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone recommend restaurants/cafes and or hotels/motels or places <br/>
of interest in the places we intend to visit?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any good archery and outdoor stores?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Linda</div>
