The realization I had while talking with Seth is that God had begun<br/>
something twenty years ago that came to be called &quot;homeschooling,&quot; but<br/>
which really wasn t about schooling at all. <br/>
<br/>
If we can get past being put off by the heavy-handed religious slant and the <br/>
historical inaccuracies, there is a small point this writer is making, imo.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;School&quot; -- if we have to name and define what we do all day in terms of <br/>
whether or not our child is &quot;in school&quot; or &quot;being schooled&quot; that&#39;s an interesting <br/>
notion. If even unschoolers label themselves in terms of &quot;school&quot; that&#39;s <br/>
something to think about. Maybe it says more about those grocery clerks who are so <br/>
curious about a child out and about on a &quot;school day&quot; than it does about the <br/>
homeschooler. Maybe it says hsing isn&#39;t as accepted and natural seeming an idea <br/>
as it should be, among those who choose not to hs -- and even among some <br/>
hsers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it says we&#39;re just not all that bright. We need to label each other. <br/>
And we label each other in terms of our jobs, some of the time. &quot;There&#39;s Jim, <br/>
the fireman. There&#39;s Molly, the lawyer. Oh, that&#39;s Nance, she stays at home with <br/>
her kids and homeschools -- can you believe it.&quot; We&#39;re just not very clever <br/>
in talking to one another. <br/>
<br/>
And a lot of grownups are horrible, just horrible, at talking to kids. DD was <br/>
relieved the other day when an older gentleman at the deli counter did NOT <br/>
ask her too much about school -- only asked if all her homework was done; it was <br/>
:) -- but then he proceeded to ask her about -- ta da!! -- other things. What <br/>
she liked at the deli, etc. <br/>
<br/>
She proclaimed later that he was a pretty boring old man, but at least he <br/>
didn&#39;t ask her what grade she was in! Gosh, how many times has she been asked <br/>
that stupid question?  Grownups just don&#39;t seem to know what to talk to kids <br/>
about so they fall back on these stock questons -- which may be completely <br/>
inappropriate.<br/>
<br/>
So it just seems to me that it&#39;s a small idea to ponder -- getting past all <br/>
the other fluff in the article -- why we label each other in terms of &quot;school&quot; <br/>
at all. We need to describe each other, to know each other somehow and this is <br/>
the best we can do? Not very impressive. :)<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;Hello list&quot; -- Nance here, unschooling Mom to 2 fantastic kids in <br/>
Florida. (But I do other things too and you might describe me completely differently <br/>
in a different context. :) )<br/>
