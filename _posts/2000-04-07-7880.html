          Your post almost brought me to tears. I know that most people that<br/>
hs (at least the earthy crunchy ones like us), boy that was a blanket<br/>
statement huh? tend not to care about things like the house and car. It&#39;s<br/>
just nice to here it put into words like that. I too, am too busy loving my<br/>
kids to worry about these things. Thanks for making my day!<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Breastfeeding<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi there, I happen to be one of those terrible moms who didn&#39;t breast feed<br/>
&gt; my children.  I think with my first daughter the decision was made because<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; a lack of information on my part.  When my son was born 2 years later I<br/>
did<br/>
&gt; try to breast feed him.  It was quite pleasurable, as long as I was<br/>
nursing<br/>
&gt; on the left side.  The right side was another story.  I can&#39;t describe the<br/>
&gt; strange sort of pain I felt.  It wasn&#39;t anything like the normal pain I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; feeling on the left side, and it didn&#39;t go away.  For some reason my right<br/>
&gt; breast (especially the nipple)  is very, very sensitive (all the time).  I<br/>
&gt; talked to my doctor who dismissed me saying &quot; no one&#39;s body is perfectly<br/>
&gt; symmetrical.  We&#39;re not exactly the same on both sides - not in shape,<br/>
size<br/>
&gt; or sensation&quot;.  So, I stopped breastfeeding my son.  I didn&#39;t even try<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; my next daughter.  I was very discouraged at that point.  When my fourth<br/>
baby<br/>
&gt; was born, 14 months ago, I did try to nurse her.  She was injured at birth<br/>
&gt; (by the same doctor who gave me the advice on symmetry) and because of low<br/>
&gt; muscle tone she had problems latching on and sucking.  I was totally<br/>
stressed<br/>
&gt; out!  There was just too much going on.  It was our first year of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling, my baby was hurt, and I knew that to successfully<br/>
breastfeed<br/>
&gt; her was going to take lots of time and energy (especially since I&#39;d<br/>
basically<br/>
&gt; be doing it for the first time).  Besides all that I never did figure out<br/>
&gt; what the problem with my right breast was...or is.  So, I quit.  I spent<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; first few months of her life avoiding some of the very people who<br/>
&gt; could/should have been supporting me.   You know why?  Because I didn&#39;t<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to hear the breastfeeding lecture...again.  I know it&#39;s best for the baby!<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; know! I know! I know!  And guess what?  I think homeschooling is best for<br/>
&gt; kids.  But I don&#39;t go around preaching about it to every person I meet.<br/>
In<br/>
&gt; fact, I don&#39;t even talk about it unless someone asks me to.  I figure that<br/>
&gt; everyone has their reasons for doing things the way they do.  Most people<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; doing all they know  they&#39;re capable of doing for their families with the<br/>
&gt; circumstances they&#39;ve been given.  Notice I didn&#39;t say ARE capable of<br/>
doing.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve all had times when we were capable of doing more than we&#39;ve actually<br/>
&gt; done.  Maybe I just got lucky, but all of my kids have been very healthy.<br/>
No<br/>
&gt; ear infections, no allergies, and only the occasional cold.  They&#39;re right<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; target for weight, and have met all of their developmental milestones at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &quot;appropriate&quot; time ( except for my youngest, but that has nothing to do<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; what I&#39;m feeding her)  Oh yeah!  They&#39;re really smart too. BG.  And when<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; young daughter of an acquaintance said to me as I was bottle feeding my<br/>
baby<br/>
&gt; one day last sumer  &quot; Ugh!  why are you feeding her that yucky stuff&quot;?  I<br/>
&gt; explained the best way I could. Then I said a silent prayer of<br/>
thanksgiving<br/>
&gt; that she was alive and that I was able to feed her at all.  The birth of<br/>
my 1<br/>
&gt; year old was a major life altering event for me.  I no longer worry about<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; trivial things in life (well, not as much as I used to anyway).  Who cares<br/>
&gt; what the house looks like?  Or, the clothes, or my hair, or the car?  I&#39;m<br/>
too<br/>
&gt; busy loving the children I&#39;ve been blessed with to worry about what other<br/>
&gt; people think.  And I for one, have certainly got better things to do than<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; monitor the parenting choices of others.  Okay, all that being said...I do<br/>
&gt; want to say that if there is a baby number 5 in my future I will most<br/>
&gt; definitely try again to breastfeed.  When that time arrives, I believe<br/>
I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; need lots of advice.  And I think I know just where I can find it.  Baby<br/>
&gt; needs me...gotta go.<br/>
