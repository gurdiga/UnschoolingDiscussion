is the epitome of weird.     <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I haven&#39;t lost any friends outright.  But watching how people treat children<br/>

&gt; people with feelings and ideas all their own.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve necessarily lost any friends over unschooling, either.<br/>
Mainly I just don&#39;t make new ones when we move new places.  I&#39;m too wierd<br/>
for most people, I guess.  I&#39;m interested in things that require thought,<br/>
and I talk to my son for the fun of it.  The other day, somebody told me<br/>
that was a wierd thing to do.  I&#39;d never realized.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, I&#39;ve discovered lately that people without kids are<br/>
far more likely to be good friends for me.  They have interests besides kids<br/>
because they haven&#39;t got kids, and they haven&#39;t mastered the parent vs. kid<br/>
culture, so they treat my son better than most parents do.  Somehow society<br/>
seems to expect that parents socialize with other parents.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too. We have several childless couples and singles who REALLY *get* <br/>
unschooling---the lifestyle and everything. A few of them will help at the <br/>
conference. Two are school teachers and one is a former teacher. Go figure. <br/>
But they *get* it. And they treat my boys as *people*.<br/>

A woman I met in January and became instant friends with understands<br/>
unschooling.   She has no children, and twenty years ago decided she<br/>
wanted to learn stained glass.   She didn&#39;t want to take a class so she<br/>
bought a few books and supplies and learned it.   She makes a great<br/>
living doing custom windows.<br/>
When I was trying to explain unschooling she said &quot;Oh!  Just like I<br/>
learned stained glass!&quot;   <br/>
Just like that.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s right this minute floating in the Colorado river somewhere on her<br/>
way through the grand canyon.<br/>
<br/>
Damned show off ! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is interesting because my husband and I were talking about this just <br/>
last night.  We are still pondering the &quot;what if something happens to the <br/>
both of us&quot; question, with little in the way of answers yet.  But we both <br/>
came to the conclusion that we need to be looking at family that does not <br/>
have children.  My best friend and my niece are two that we are talking <br/>
about.  All of our family that have children are so set in how children need <br/>
to be raised, all of them have such a disrespectful attitude toward children. <br/>
 Totally believe that children need to be &quot;filled up&quot; with knowledge, have no <br/>
independent thought, should not be part of conversations and decision making, <br/>
etc., etc.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple of family members with no children do not seem to have that mind set <br/>
and would be more open to discussing alternative thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it has nothing to do with children, maybe it is just my family.  <br/>
They do not seem to be the type to question societies &quot;normals&quot;.  &quot;It has <br/>
always been done like this&quot; is good enough for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.<br/>
