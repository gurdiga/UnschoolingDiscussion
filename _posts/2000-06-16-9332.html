<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597252625">Hi Trisha,<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about electricity and how I first learned about sort of the basic<br/>
ideas. Maybe this will interest you and Gary.<br/>
<br/>
One idea is that electricity sort of flows through a wire like water through a<br/>
hose. The light switch is the valve, voltage is like water pressure, watts are<br/>
like how much water a sprinkler can put out, amps are like how much water the<br/>
hose can safely carry, resistance is like anything that can slow the flow.  Show<br/>
him ratings of appliances in your home and compare how many watts a space heater<br/>
or hair dryer puts out to a blender or a TV. The watts are sort of like heat,<br/>
maybe more like energy output. If you have circuit breakers or a fuse boxes, say<br/>
that the main is like the main water line into the house, and all the smaller<br/>
ones are like pipes to different areas of the house and the outlets and switches<br/>
are like faucets. Where&#39;s the drain? Tell him all circuits are a path. There are<br/>
wires to and from all outlets and switches and even in and out of your house.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the traffic analogy is useful. When you close the switch it&#39;s like<br/>
lowering the bridge so traffic can flow around the circuit from the source<br/>
(battery +) to the load (light) then along the wire to the other end of the<br/>
battery(-).<br/>
<br/>
You could explain it like dominoes. Set up a row (as long as you want) and say<br/>
that the first tap is like turning on the switch and the last one falling can<br/>
knock something over that could represent a light bulb going on. The electrons in<br/>
the copper in a wire (or anything else that conducts electricity) get tapped<br/>
along like dominoes till they reach the other end.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if Radio Shack still sells these, but I had a &quot;101 Projects&quot; kit<br/>
when I was a kid where it was a board with color coded wires of different lengths<br/>
and several tiny resistors, capacitors, transistors etc. all soldered to it. You<br/>
followed the directions about which wires to connect where and you could make a<br/>
radio or a light or a morse code beeper thing. The wires connected via springs so<br/>
you could take it apart again and again. That probably is too old for him right<br/>
now, but maybe they have simpler kits that you could build together to illustrate<br/>
and play. Like the old basic of a battery, 2 wires, and a light bulb, maybe even<br/>
add a simple switch.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that some of this could be interesting to you and Gary. I know I&#39;ve had<br/>
alot of fun over the years making things.<br/>

&gt; Gary has been VERY into bugs since before he could walk, and recently he,ms<br/>
&gt; gotten interested in Spanish,and how electricity works(which has stumped me,<br/>
&gt; I have no idea how to explain this to a 6 year old without boring him to<br/>
&gt; tears,I have looked on the web, but most of what I found is a little too<br/>
&gt; advanced as he doesn&#39;t read much yet.)<br/>
