Kids and internet safety came up IRL for my dd this week.  I&#39;m not worried about it, but have had a couple of people tell me that I should be.  Dh is concerned that she will stumble onto porn sights (hasn&#39;t happened yet) and a friend shared her concern that children shouldn&#39;t use their real names, not even just first names, online.<br/>
