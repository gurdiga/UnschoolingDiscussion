<div id="ygrps-yiv-449617196">I love having wretched excess around for the kids to learn with.<br/>
We have that same &quot;tub&quot; of coins - and had a lot of fun with it<br/>
during the election cycle.  The basic shtick was that 516 pennies<br/>
will have a specific height when stacked - and that a PVC pipe<br/>
will hold that stack up.  Whichever candidate&#39;s &quot;pipe&quot; got full<br/>
first was the winner.  We were having some friends with young<br/>
kids up to watch the returns;  I was mainly looking for an<br/>
entertaining way to occupy them, while keeping them involved in<br/>
the events.<br/>
<br/>
First you have to make several stacks of 10 pennies and measure<br/>
them.  Average the measurements.  Multiply the average by 51.6<br/>
(for the 4 yo, that was KEWL - her own first calculator, with her<br/>
own name on it!!!).  Cut the PVC pipe to length; label each.<br/>
Build a base for the 2 pipes (1x 8, 8 inches long, with a 2x4 cut<br/>
6 inches long and drilled with a hole saw to hold the pipes up,<br/>
glued together and all decorated with stars and &quot;stuff&quot;).  Take a<br/>
BIG map of the United States and a list of the electoral votes<br/>
for each state.  Find each state and label with the number of<br/>
votes.  DD is pretty kinesthetic, so we prepared for that part by<br/>
going to a nearby school parking lot that has a US map painted on<br/>
it, sized maybe 50 x 125 feet.  Having &quot;walked&quot; the locations of<br/>
each state, she didn&#39;t have to have much help finding them on the<br/>
map and marking the number of votes.  Counted out a 1000 plus<br/>
pennies (where upon I was informed that it would have been a heck<br/>
of a lot easier to take $10 to the bank and get rolls.<br/>
<br/>
Put markers by the map on the floor and a bowl of the pennies.<br/>
They colored in each state as it was called, counted out the<br/>
pennies and put them in the right tube, which meant there were<br/>
several tasks for each event, letting everybody have turns at<br/>
everything.  Of course this particular election ended up<br/>
providing more that the usual opportunities; enough so we could<br/>
have developed a HS commune by the time it was done, but the kids<br/>
were tuckered and sleeping before it got too crazy.<br/>
