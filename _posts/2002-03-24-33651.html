<div id="ygrps-yiv-972809074">Hi, I&#39;m new to this forum.  I&#39;m curious to know if anyone out there <br/>
has had their kids attend Grace Llewellyn&#39;s camp in Oregon.  I&#39;m from <br/>
the Northeast and aware that she is starting up a new camp this year <br/>
in Virginia.  I have a 12 1/2 year old son who might consider it in <br/>
the future if it sounds good.  Any feedback? --Marie</div>

friend whose daughter is going to go this year for the first time and is <br/>
really excited.  I&#39;ve heard that they might not get enough kids for the <br/>
Northeast one, so even if your son wouldn&#39;t be going this year, you might <br/>
want to let them know that you&#39;d be interested in the eastern one for the <br/>
future.<br/>

If there aren&#39;t any members here whose children attend the camp, another<br/>
list does have several members whose children have attended.  The Home-Ed<br/>
list is a general homeschooling list with a lot of unschoolers on it.<br/>

I hope you stay here with us too!  Welcome to unschooling-dotcom!!<br/>

evening with two of them (one visiting from Canada) making People Piles.<br/>
She can&#39;t wait until she&#39;s old enough to go. I&#39;ve heard nothing but rave<br/>
reviews from all the teens I know.<br/>
