<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016190612">Yes, yes, yes! Loved this whole post. It is imo all about the Power of <br/>
Story.<br/>
<br/>
       Pleasantville is one of our family favorites for just these unschool-y <br/>
reasons. Then we discovered Strictly Ballroom last week and had great fun <br/>
relating its themes back to Pleasantville, Dirty Dancing, and Footloose. We <br/>
decided the Preacher in Footloose, the Mayor in Pleasantville, and the toupeed <br/>
Dance Association head in Strictly Ballroom (Barry I think) all were the same <br/>
character, embodying the repressive forces of convention, keeping the populace in <br/>
line so people can&#39;t grow beyond the bounds those leaders represent and <br/>
believe are necessary.<br/>
<br/>
       As an academic thinker, what I like about the heroes in each of these <br/>
movies is that they beat the controller-standardizers at their own game. In <br/>
other words, they aren&#39;t brought up as rebels or indoctrinated to rebel. They <br/>
don&#39;t set out to be rebels at all, and they don&#39;t come to it by default because <br/>
they aren&#39;t able enough to excel within the rules. Instead they come to it <br/>
gradually and reluctantly, for their own reasons. It is a personal journey with <br/>
meaning only to that young person who tries first of all to fit in rather than <br/>
to rebel. <br/>
<br/>
       The Strictly Ballroom dancer was the best at all the conventional <br/>
steps, and then he needed even more, to grow beyond their limits. Tobey Maguire <br/>
knew and loved everything about the old black-and-white tv world -- he didn&#39;t <br/>
want to rebel, but eventually it happened in spite of his desire to fit in, just <br/>
because its limits couldn&#39;t hold him forever. <br/>
<br/>
       The preacher&#39;s daughter in Footloose who just wants to rebel and run <br/>
away has a horrible time of it until she&#39;s inspired to understand her own <br/>
feelings and her father&#39;s feelings as well. Same with the Dirty Dancing daughter, <br/>
who is such a good girl in every way, until she meets the rebel dance teacher <br/>
and her generous heart grows even more, finally breaking through beyond <br/>
societal limitations. All the successful hero characters first steep themselves in <br/>
the rules and boundaries and learn to understand them, thereby also learning <br/>
about and eventually exceeding their own limitations through experience. These <br/>
are acts of personal growth and discovery, not social rebellion.<br/>
<br/>
       That&#39;s how we see unschooling. That&#39;s the Power of Our Story.<br/>
<br/>
       Not trying to rebel or decide anything for anyone else, or reform the <br/>
public schools or take over homeschooling. We are simply being true to our own <br/>
family&#39;s journey of personal growth and discovery. We do this just like in <br/>
the movies, by first knowing more than most people about what those boundaries <br/>
are and how to live within them and what is possible beyond them. And <br/>
sometimes, it just happens to have revolutionary import of which we never dreamed! :)  <br/>

&gt; One movie that I associate with unschooling, because it is about <br/>
&gt; thinking outside the box, and living life passionately (but it is NOT <br/>
&gt; for little kids...) is Pleasantville.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Toby McGuire and Reese Witherspoon both star, and it may be the <br/>
&gt; first  big movie for both of them. It also has Jeff Daniels <br/>
&gt; from &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; and &quot;Fly Away Home&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fly Away Home is VERY unschooly. The one about the flock of geese <br/>
&gt; that bonds to a high school girl and she has to lead them through the <br/>
&gt; air to a wintering spot...that&#39;s a good one for depicting a life of <br/>
&gt; passion and interest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But to tell you the truth, movies are just  Highly Graphic <br/>
&gt; Storytelling :) and the little brains inside their little skulls are <br/>
&gt; clicking away making connections that we can&#39;t imagine...and so, like <br/>
&gt; everything else, movies ARE unschooly. Just like chopping firewood, <br/>
&gt; baking bread, drawing symmetrical designs, counting change, swimming, <br/>
&gt; reading Nate the Great, and grocery shopping are :)<br/>

       Rebellion was never part of my identity, even as a teen. I&#39;m always <br/>
startled when others see our lifestyle or anything I say or do as rebelling. I <br/>
think of myself as so normal and well-adjusted. :)  JJ<br/>

In Strictly Ballroom, it was definitely rebellion.  But it had to do with <br/>
priorities.   His mentors considered the rules, contests and titles to be <br/>
primary.  Scott&#39;s priority is dance itself.   That&#39;s a conflict.  He&#39;s been groomed.  <br/>
He can&#39;t step off his path without it being rebellion, but he&#39;s decided that <br/>
his own ideas outweigh his duty to his mother or teacher.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Rebellion&quot; is what it&#39;s called by the people who don&#39;t approve.<br/>
&quot;Liberation&quot; or &quot;freedom&quot; are the names given by those who step up and out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092589979">Okay, I&#39;m gonna have to get Strictly Ballroom now. I&#39;ve seen Dirty <br/>
Dancing, but can&#39;t remember anything other than Patrick Swayze&#39;s <br/>
amazing bod...don&#39;t remember a lick of the plot! LOL and I&#39;ve never <br/>
seen Footloose either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to get these into the house and check them out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they aren&#39;t able enough to excel within the rules. Instead they <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For the above reason, if none other:  &quot;it isn&#39;t because they aren&#39;t <br/>
able enough to excel within the rules&quot;...this was a HUGE discussion <br/>
between me and my best friend, about my choices in the education of <br/>
my kids...she always DID excel within the rules...top of her class, <br/>
high achiever, etc. and is having a hard time understanding my <br/>
(strong)dislike of the system. For so many people, the burden of the <br/>
rules drives out initiative, passion, interest. The rules are <br/>
stronger than MANY personalities. Not everyone can push past them the <br/>
way you describe here. <br/>
<br/>
Heaven forbid, my kids should come into adulthood with the baggage I <br/>
had to contend with. I want them to find their excellence, and don&#39;t <br/>
see how I can MAKE them or FORCE them...if it is to be theirs, they <br/>
must find it themselves. And me along to help over the rough spots, <br/>
enjoying the journey with them. <br/>
<br/>
Having gone through the &quot;tried first to fit in&quot; and then <br/>
the &quot;rebellion&quot;...but you know, with no personal resources, my <br/>
rebellion was ugly and dangerous. I hope to endow my kids with the <br/>
resources, and free them up so the rebellion is meaningless...they&#39;ll <br/>
already have themselves, and themselves with confidence, abilities, <br/>
discernment, morals...<br/>
<br/>
I like this thread!<br/>
