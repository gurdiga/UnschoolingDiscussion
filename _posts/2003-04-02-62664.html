<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018027894">We never had butter with lobster. Most people I know eat it plain. <br/>
Preferably cooked and eaten outside where you can make a big mess and <br/>
admire the big pile of shells afterwards :-) Some people have mayonnaise <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like lobster. It seems a shame living where I live. I used to like <br/>
it when I was young but now it makes me sick.<br/>

The idiom is &quot;free rein,&quot; as Kelly pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
Any &#39;reign of TV&#39; would be TV ruling your life! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I need to pass this on to Holly.  She&#39;s collecting homonyms in sets of three, <br/>
sentences with all three words.  So far she just has the sets of two, their <br/>
and bye.<br/>
