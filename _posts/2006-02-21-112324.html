<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481793315">Hello all: I don&#39;t know if this is already common knowledge to <br/>
everyone else, but a friend just introduced us to Google Earth. You <br/>
download the free software (it doesn&#39;t take long at all - <br/>
www.googleearth.com) and then you can travel anywhere on the planet <br/>
via satellite photos! The photos are up to 3 years old, and outside <br/>
of large cities you can&#39;t see too close to the ground, but since <br/>
yesterday afternoon, we&#39;ve visited the Statue of Liberty (photo was <br/>
clear to within 300 ft from the top of her head), the Great Wall of <br/>
China (from several thousand feet up), the Eiffel Tower (that was <br/>
really cool as there was a clear shadow of the tower and the tower <br/>
itself could be seen very clearly), the pyramids at Giza, the <br/>
gardens at Versailles, the Tower of London, the St. Louis Arch, <br/>
Fenway Park, and, of course, we&#39;ve pinned down where our house is <br/>
here outside of Athens, GA, as close as we can make it out.<br/>
 Our almost-7yo DD has taken over the laptop & is cruising the world <br/>
by herself, plugging in the names of places she wants to see, and <br/>
quickly gaining mastery of reading larger numbers, we&#39;ve found, as <br/>
she reads aloud (of her own volition) the altitude at which the <br/>
photo becomes most clear.<br/>
  Enjoy,<br/>
Julie H.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297895922">Marty looked for Times Square, but said the ground was hard to find  <br/>
in NYC.  Central Park was easy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then he looked at Rome and found the Colliseum.  VERY cool.  And he  <br/>
found his friend&#39;s house in Stanley, New Mexico.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274183705">I love Google Earth.  It has a search feature where you can enter<br/>
latitude and longitude coordinates, so I can sort of &quot;cheat&quot; when I go<br/>
geocaching.  Some cache sites are seen crystal clear, and I know exactly<br/>
where to look.  If I can&#39;t find the cache then, I need to give up.  :)<br/>

mentioned it and found it only for PeeCees, it&#39;s now available for  <br/>
Macs too :-)<br/>
