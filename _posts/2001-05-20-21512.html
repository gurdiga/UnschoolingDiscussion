<div id="ygrps-yiv-958973333">Several years ago I had the misfortune of going to Michelle&#39;s website and reading her idea of what young children should be doing.  She was very active on the boards and email groups as well.  I had quite a few confrontations with her, none ended nicely I might add.  She would advocate that all these new homeschoolers out there be following her &quot;plan&quot; for their young children and basically they were behind if they didn&#39;t fill those expectations.  I made a point to counteract each and every of Michelle&#39;s posts on boards or email lists that I was on to let people know that there is another way and that they should thoroughly research her ideas of early education before embarking their little charges with a full academic schedule as she prescribed.  Anyway, she finally faded away and I am happy to say that her website is no longer running so hopefully less and less people will be influenced by her ideas.<br/>

  I found this under the two year old section<br/>
  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Holds a crayon correctly when coloring.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m sort of hoping Michele Lewis is not on our list, because this is pure<br/>
  bs.  I have had 4  2yr olds pass through my home and there&#39;s no way you can<br/>
  say a *2* year old needs to be able to do this.  And who gets to define<br/>
  correctly?  When in that second year is this a supposed need?  3 days after<br/>
  the birthday when they are still babies? OR the day before they turn 3 and<br/>
  you&#39;re missing that baby face you knew so well?   We won&#39;t even go into the<br/>
  wide maturation differences inherent in boys and girls.  I had one son that<br/>
  was a &quot;baby&quot; until shortly after his 4th birthday.  He didn&#39;t lose his baby<br/>
  face, nor his baby ways until then.  He wasn&#39;t and isn&#39;t &#39;slow&#39;, he&#39;s just<br/>
  himself..  He didn&#39;t speak until 4ish either, and then he spoke in complete,<br/>
  complicated sentences.  He hated to color or draw until about the age of 8<br/>
  and just last week, at now 11,  he asked me for a drawing class.<br/>
<br/>
  I read through the rest of the list and realized that what I disliked most<br/>
  about the infomation there was the tone in which things were presented.  I<br/>
  offered the children all of these things and more, I just didn&#39;t fret over<br/>
  the idea of having them master or prove the skills.  I trusted that they<br/>
  would want to write and color and sing and waxh hands and learn to read.  I<br/>
  trusted their inate ability to love me and trust me and talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
  She also thinks 4 year olds shoud understand the concept of sin and<br/>
  forgivness. I know learned adults who disagree on these concepts. I know<br/>
  Christians and Jews who hold diametrically opposed definitions of these<br/>
  concepts.   4 year olds shouldn&#39;t even know the word sin, IMNSHO.<br/>
<br/>
  i didn&#39;t think much of the site to tell you the truth.<br/>

  &gt; BlankHi All<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Someone pointed me to this list of skills to be mastered by 2, 3 and 4<br/>
  year olds. I would love to hear other people&#39;s opinion on it. Personally I<br/>
  think the Phonics, Writing and ARithmetic skills lists are a bit too<br/>
  advanced for my liking. My almost four year old is not even close to<br/>
  mastering it.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Here are the lists<br/>
