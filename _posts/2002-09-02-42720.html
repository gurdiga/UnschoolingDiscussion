&lt;&lt; I read a book called &quot;Coloring Outside <br/>
 the Lines&quot; in which a man who designed artificial intelligence for <br/>
 computers and therefore had studied a lot about how learning works, <br/>
 wrote about how to get your kids through public school with their <br/>
 critical thinking, creativity and love of learning in tact.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love that book. I recommend it often because it&#39;s written by a Dad and he <br/>
had his kids in ps (which baffles me since he lists all the ways it damages <br/>
kids), and therefore is a good book imo for people reluctant to accept <br/>
homeschooling as a viable option.<br/>
