&quot;Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocre minds. The <br/>
latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to <br/>
hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.&quot; ~ <br/>

Thanks, Diana.  This quote made me think of what I&#39;ve experienced here on <br/>
this website-the honest and courageous encouragement to use my own intelligence <br/>
instead of living the way I was programmed to live-and hence, doing so for my <br/>
chidren.  Thanks to all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931830652">We were just watching ET tonight (I forgot how good it was) and this quote  <br/>
stood out to me.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s the scene where Elliot has to go to school after staying home &quot;sick&quot;  <br/>
from school, with E.T., the day before.  Him and his brother are walking  down <br/>
the driveway to leave, and his brother says, &quot;Did you explain school to  him?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
And Elliot says, &quot;How do you explain school to a higher  intelligence??&quot;<br/>
