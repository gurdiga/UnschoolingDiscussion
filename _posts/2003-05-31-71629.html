I am. But, IMO, THAT is slimey behavior, that dumping the first wife <br/>
when he got famous. Paul Hogan, from Crocodile Dundee did that, for <br/>
his co-star whateverhernameis, and I consider that slimey, too. OH! <br/>
That guy from LA Law dumped HIS wife, for the older woman attorney <br/>
actress...LOL I don&#39;t know names of ANY TV actors! Slimey. When a <br/>
woman does it, it&#39;s slimey, too. And when they do it to each other, <br/>
that&#39;s slimey for the kids&#39; sakes. Like Tom Cruise and Nichole Kidman <br/>
or Loni Anderson and ???Burt Reynolds? Adopting children and breaking <br/>
up their family? Slimey.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too bad that Charleton Heston has political and social ideas <br/>

Doing It Right, at least as far as steadfastness in family is <br/>
concerned.<br/>

<br/>
You know what it is? It seems that divorce and remarriage is the norm <br/>
with movie stars, so when a couple stays together for a long time, we <br/>
want to admire them...rightly so.<br/>

<br/>
I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s a fair assumption at all to say that what these<br/>
people did is slimey. Their marriage broke up. None of us here certainly<br/>
know what really happened. If anyone fooled around at all and even who<br/>
actually did. Why they broke up and who was more responsible if any one<br/>
person really was. I also don&#39;t think most people have children on the<br/>
assumption that they won&#39;t be together forever. Some people change and some<br/>
people don&#39;t and some people go different directions and a lot of people<br/>
just make mistakes. And some people are much better off being apart and some<br/>
children are better with their parents being apart too. Seems like there is<br/>
a lot of judging going on because of who wed and who divorced.<br/>
