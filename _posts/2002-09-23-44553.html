<div id="ygrps-yiv-735246538">Hi Shannon,<br/>
Does your daughter attend some kind of school now?  If not, then you are <br/>
already unschooling her.  What TV shows does she enjoy now?  Watch those <br/>
with her and see if you can find shows/videos that are about things she has <br/>
shown interest in.  Also look for stuff about your interests  &quot;Field trips&quot; <br/>
are a school-term, along with educational vs. junk TV, videos, books,etc. <br/>
and curriculum.  When you go places now with your daughter, what do you call <br/>
it then?  Going to the zoo, playground, park,etc.  Just keep calling it that <br/>
and save the school-terms for any reports you have to give to the school <br/>
district.<br/>
As for places to go, take her places she likes and that you think she might <br/>
like.  Active/ hands-on is much better than don&#39;t touch places.<br/>
Have you been to unschooling.com?  The message boards are wonderful.<br/>

&gt;are some good places for field trips?<br/>

I thought that unschooling meant there was no curriculum. Just a thought. <br/>
PBS has a few &quot;okay&quot; shows for kids. Don&#39;t know how &quot;educational&quot; they are, <br/>
but our kids (7 & 9/10) like them.<br/>

  I will choose Free Will&quot; -Rush (& Todd)<br/>
