&lt;&lt; Yeah, and Sandra won&#39;t come if it&#39;s in summer. Desert people would drown in<br/>
our humidity! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would.  I&#39;ve been to the Pennsic War three times.  It&#39;s kinda deathish, <br/>
camping in Pennsylvania.  In the morning it&#39;s hard to tell where the little <br/>
lake ends and the air stops.  But for a good cause (and especially if I don&#39;t <br/>
have to be in a car all the way across the country to have it GRADUALLY go <br/>
wet; that&#39;s rough) it might be doable.<br/>
<br/>
Truthfully, it&#39;s hard to breathe at first.  The first time I was in PA in <br/>
August I said it felt like the air was full of plants and water.  But what <br/>
people who are used to high desert air have to do is get a new breathing <br/>
rhythm and just breathe very shallowly.  There&#39;s a LOT of oxygen to be had, <br/>
hardly breathing.  And a deep breath can hurt.  Your lungs get too full and <br/>
you&#39;re still breathing in and it&#39;s like a cramp nearly.<br/>
<br/>
But it made me more sympathetic for people going the other direction, who <br/>
would get out here, and up here (a mile high where I live, and they often see <br/>
the mountain and say &quot;let&#39;s go up there!&quot; but it&#39;s another whole mile!) and <br/>
they&#39;re breathing shallowly as they&#39;ve done for years or a lifetime, and it&#39;s <br/>
not doing them as much good as it did before.  They get tired and <br/>
light-headed and now I know what to coach them to do.  For years I had no <br/>
clue.<br/>

I grew up in PA. That&#39;s fog, not humidity.<br/>
<br/>
Humidity is when the salt shakers stop pouring.<br/>
<br/>
Humidity is when the clumping cat litter stops clumping.<br/>
<br/>
Humidity is when you feel wetter getting out of the shower than you felt in<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
It was so humid here last year that salt scattered on the table pulled so<br/>
much water out of the air it formed puddles.<br/>

<br/>
Oh my gosh, I can relate to this!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I live in PA.  But my mom moved to NM (she has since moved back).  Anyway, the first time I went to see her, we went up to on the Sandias on that cable car.<br/>
<br/>
I want to tell you I was sick as a dog by the time we got done with that 20 minute cable car ride.  At first, I wasn&#39;t sure what was wrong with me.  Light headed, nauseous, etc.  Then I realized how high we went in such a short time and realized it was altitude sickness, or at least thats what I think it was.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was up there for about an hour and got something to eat, I felt a bit better.<br/>
<br/>
Makes me hesitate to go up there again.<br/>

I&#39;ve often said that it feels like we&#39;re drowning in August.  It *does* feel like the air is full of water, and when the air is thick, you can really smell the fragrance of the plants too.  I love it, but I thank Gd for air conditioning!<br/>
