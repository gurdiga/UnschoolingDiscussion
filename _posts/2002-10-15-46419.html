I am not one of the long-time posters here, but I know what helped me was reading this list for a few weeks.  Lots of subjects and they seem to come up periodically.<br/>
Also read the posts on Unschooling.com website.  That will give you an endless trail of info.  I also read several books, And the Skylark Sings, is one of my favorite and Family Matters:  Why Homeschooling Makes Sense,  and now am reading Homeschooling Our Children and Unschooling Ourselves.<br/>
Like others have said, read,read,read,  and I believe it will all make sense.<br/>
Also, trust, trust, trust, and be patient with your children,  they are amazing and if only we&#39;ll allow them to be...<br/>
Hope this helped,<br/>

Just keep reading the posts from this list. You can also find other <br/>
homeschooling lists that may be more state-specific :) Unschooling dot com <br/>
is a pretty good message board. I used to visit it a lot when we were <br/>
looking at different styles of homeschooling. I think what helped us most <br/>
was belonging to a group such as this, asking lots of questions (like <br/>
you&#39;re doing), and getting as comfortable as possible with the idea of the <br/>
freedom of home/unschooling. Read lots of articles. &lt;shameless plug&gt; You <br/>
can find some at our site <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rambleman.tripod.com/homeschool_home.html)">http://rambleman.tripod.com/homeschool_home.html)</a> as well as many others <br/>
by just googling &quot;homeschooling&quot; at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a><br/>

And... Welcome to the list :)<br/>

you can meet other homeschoolers IRL for help.<br/>
<br/>
Also, check out unschooling.com and www.unschooling.org for articles <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654938009">Hi Elise,<br/>
  I&#39;m from Pennsylvania too, about 2 hours from Lancaster.  -You <br/>
might find the pa-hs list helpful. It does sometimes generate a lot <br/>
of email, but the ladies on that list are always very willing to <br/>
answer questions for a new homeschooler. To join this list, address a <br/>
subject-less email to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:subscribe-pa-hs@...">subscribe-pa-hs@...</a> or (for the digest <br/>
version) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:subscribe-pa-hs-digest@...">subscribe-pa-hs-digest@...</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling in Pennsylvania Ezine is a once-every-two weeks email <br/>
publication that lets you know about the significant events that home <br/>
educators in the state want to know about. There are no commercial <br/>
advertisers and the ezine costs nothing. Find out about legislation, <br/>
court cases, curriculum fairs, seminars, field trips, museum <br/>
packages, new support groups, and websites of relevance. To begin <br/>
receiving Homeschooling in Pennsylvania Ezine simply address and then <br/>
send a blank email message to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:subscribe-pa-hs-ezine@...">subscribe-pa-hs-ezine@...</a>. <br/>
<br/>
To get a free copy of the current homeschool law, send a blank email <br/>
message to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pa-hs-law@...">pa-hs-law@...</a>. Don&#39;t buy any guides to the <br/>
Pennsylvania law.  They often encourage overcompliance!  Just read <br/>
the law itself.  <br/>
<br/>
For info on complying with the homeschool law, check out www.phen.org<br/>
Since your older child is in first grade in a public school, you will <br/>
still have to file an affidavit for him, even though he&#39;s not 8 years <br/>
old yet.  You&#39;ll find everything you need at the phen site.  <br/>
