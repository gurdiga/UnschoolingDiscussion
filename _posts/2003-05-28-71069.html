bought this it was one of the cheaper ones but without loosing the quality. I <br/>
bought mine so I could take photo&#39;s in the hospital when Nicholas was born. So <br/>
far so good. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163309595">Uggh.... &quot;disposable&quot;    Please stop and consider that buy purchasing &quot;disposable&quot;  you are encouraging, supporting and enabling a self destructive mindset.<br/>
<br/>
Further, buying a disposable camera is like getting furniture from rent-a -center. You end up paying and paying.<br/>
You have a family.<br/>
You have a computer.<br/>
You will want to take many more digital pictures.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen cameras for less than $60.00.<br/>
<br/>
Also - check pawn shops ....how about camera shops?? <br/>
My 35 mm cost me less than $100.00 used w/ a 90 day warranty/guarantee?(which is which??)<br/>
Brand new it was $535.00<br/>

had no problems with it so far, we&#39;ve only had it since Christmas, <br/>

card (CF card).  The camera only holds about 14 pics without the <br/>
memory card.  We bought a 128mb memory card from Amazon for about $40 <br/>
and it holds about 200 photos now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-227227714">Disposable digital didn&#39;t even make sense to me, so I googled it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,65463,00.asp">http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,65463,00.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
Before I bought a digital camera, I was having my photos developed by<br/>
snapfish.com/  I mailed them my exposed roll, they sent me back photos, but<br/>
also posted my photos on their website.  I could copy the photos onto my<br/>
computer for email, making greeting cards, etc., and could also send friends<br/>
a link to view my photos at snapfish.  You can also have your regular photos<br/>
developed right onto CDs.  This type of service is now widely available.<br/>
<br/>
As for price, I recommend thinking first about how you will use your camera.<br/>
Do you want to zoom in on your kids?  Do you want to take panoramic photos<br/>
while hiking?  You probably won&#39;t get both in a &quot;cheap&quot; digital.  Do you<br/>
want a compact camera or do you care more about high quality photos?  Read<br/>
reviews.  They are easy to find on-line.<br/>
<br/>
Another price factor to consider is that printing your own digital photos is<br/>
not cheap.  Unless you have a very good printer, special paper, and special<br/>
ink, none of which are cheap, your photos will have sort of a &quot;newspapery&quot;<br/>
look to them.  I still have some of my photos profesionally printed.<br/>
(Services for this are widely available - you just bring in your flash card<br/>
and they copy the photo from it.)<br/>
<br/>
I love my digital camera for the intant processing of photos.  I can take<br/>
photos at my child&#39;s birthday party, and the next day print out custom thank<br/>
you notes for each guest.  I email photos of the kids to my mom.<br/>
<br/>
Another factor I love is that it doesn&#39;t cost any more to take lots of extra<br/>
photos.  I always take several of each shot, then delete the ones I don&#39;t<br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
We got an extra rechargable battery and an extra large-capacity flash card.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine not having the extra battery.  Digital cameras burn<br/>
batteries very quickly!<br/>
<br/>
A factor I hadn&#39;t considered is that digital photography takes up a LOT of<br/>
computer disk space.  If you have CD-RW drive, you can copy them onto CDs<br/>
though.  If you can figure out how.  I&#39;m still working on that.  Can Kirby<br/>
come visit me? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a Canon Elph and like the compact size.  It does well at close range,<br/>
but not for scenic photos.  It also doesn&#39;t do well in very low light<br/>
situations.  Dh wanted to get a more expensive one, but I insisted on having<br/>
a camera that I wasn&#39;t afraid to touch!  And this one still cost more than<br/>
the nicest still camera I ever bought.  Ours is a couple of years old now.<br/>
<br/>
We bought a Barbie digital for Jackie when she was 6.  It is very low pixle,<br/>
but she has a lot of fun with the software that came with it.<br/>

For a PC, not a Mac (where we get ours).   They had a special one day, 99 <br/>
cents for the roll on a disk (not CD), so we got it but had to put it in Kirby&#39;s <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got a Concord eyeQ duo 2000 free with a lexmark printer for $127 at <br/>
walmart. Long story short, the camera was stolen off my stroller at <br/>
the zoo, and I went to walmart and got another one for $100 because <br/>
it is a great camera for the money. It has 2.0 megapixels 1600x1200 <br/>
resolution, 1.6&quot; color LCD screen, 7mb internal memory, webcam, video <br/>
clips, SD/MMC slot, 4x digital zoom, batteries, software, cables, <br/>
handstrap and case. <br/>
<br/>
I LOVE THIS CAMERA! They marked it down to $88 at walmart and I got a <br/>
refund adjustment. I think they are going to stop carrying it in the <br/>
store, the website now says available at walmart.com only. I highly <br/>
recommend this camera, we use it for a lot of homeschooling <br/>
documentation. <br/>
<br/>
There are also reviews online if you google, that other people love <br/>
this economical camera. I think it is largely sold overseas. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666017302">Right now, I just want a digital for ebay listings  (yes, I&#39;m obviously hooked LOL)&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I plan on using my regular camera for the rest, and developing onto CD&#39;s, while also getting negatives.<br/>
<br/>
Developed pictures are much better quality from  regular camera negs than a digital right now, unless you pay an arm and a leg and your first born child for a professional grade digital along with the dev. equipment (I think that is what I read).<br/>

ANyway....I guess the cheap 50.00 camera will suffice :o).<br/>

  I got a Concord eyeQ duo 2000 free with a lexmark printer for $127 at <br/>
  walmart. Long story short, the camera was stolen off my stroller at <br/>
  the zoo, and I went to walmart and got another one for $100 because <br/>
  it is a great camera for the money. It has 2.0 megapixels 1600x1200 <br/>
  resolution, 1.6&quot; color LCD screen, 7mb internal memory, webcam, video <br/>
  clips, SD/MMC slot, 4x digital zoom, batteries, software, cables, <br/>
  handstrap and case. <br/>
<br/>
  I LOVE THIS CAMERA! They marked it down to $88 at walmart and I got a <br/>
  refund adjustment. I think they are going to stop carrying it in the <br/>
  store, the website now says available at walmart.com only. I highly <br/>
  recommend this camera, we use it for a lot of homeschooling <br/>
  documentation. <br/>
<br/>
  There are also reviews online if you google, that other people love <br/>
  this economical camera. I think it is largely sold overseas. <br/>

replacing batteries a lot.  The only issue I have is that all my photo&#39;s are on <br/>
my computer. I need to get them on CD&#39;s (I have a burner just haven&#39;t tried <br/>
it yet)<br/>
I have less photo&#39;s of my kids. I thought I would print them a lot but I <br/>
haven&#39;t yet. <br/>
<br/>
Nicholas&#39;s Birthday is today the cool part is I dont need to dash out for <br/>
film so there are many up sides to the Digitalis.  The kids love to look at them <br/>
rather than wait for developing. I also will add one her and there to my <br/>
welcome screen on my computer.<br/>
I send them to family and add some to the family page we have or even the <br/>
Brittany page we have.<br/>
Dustin took a photo of him self and printed it for the Homeschool newsletter <br/>
he made.<br/>
<br/>
They are lots of fun.  They are also less bulky than a camcorder for those <br/>
quick grabs when they begin walking, riding a bike or events.<br/>

place to go is Best Buy they have a bunch out and you can even try them out. <br/>
Or even Walmart, Circuit City and possibly Sears.<br/>

It&#39;s BOTH!!  Disposable cameras are perfect for some occasions. Like if you <br/>
know you won&#39;t use a regular one much, and feel it would be a waste to buy one. <br/>
If you just need one for a specific thing, and then no more. Another great <br/>
idea for disposable cameras, is something like a wedding, setting one on each <br/>
guest table for them to take, then you&#39;re sure to get pix of everyone, and some <br/>
funny ones too &lt;g&gt;!! Or, and idea that recently hit me; my son wants SO BAD to <br/>
take some picture -all by himself- of bugs and spiders in the back yard. He&#39;s <br/>
already dropped and broken our camera, which had to be sent to be fixed, to <br/>
the tune of almost $100. My idea for his bug pix? I&#39;ll be getting him is very <br/>
own camera to take outside and take whatever pix he wants. Disposable. Yes, it <br/>
would be ridiculous to constantly be taking pix always using disposables. THAT <br/>
would be the horrible consumerism part for sure!!    Lara........</div>

We played for a wedding a couple of weeks ago.  They did the receiving line <br/>
at the reception, and Keith, still in costume, sat up kinda behind the bride <br/>
and groom (on a banister over a two-story drop, which made me wish he had more <br/>
life insurance) and took pictures of guests in the receiving line.  He tried to <br/>
get two at a time.  It took at least three cameras, and those he had used up, <br/>
we stashed behind the gift-pile.<br/>
<br/>
It was a good idea.  It wasn&#39;t his idea, but I&#39;m impressed he thought of that <br/>
and did it. <br/>
<br/>
So I played recorder alone while people met and gret (meeted and greeted?).<br/>
It was his idea to steal the idea of a friend of ours who, as a gift, took <br/>
wedding photos for us.  And our favorites are of the people in the receiving <br/>
line.  <br/>

Have you ever looked at a listing on Ebay and the picture was so poor that you didn&#39;t feel comfortable bidding on the item?  Very low resolution just looks blurry and this is what you get with a $50. camera.  (My sister has one)  A useless waste of money.  I think you would be happier and better off getting a better quality used camera.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Right now, I just want a digital for ebay listings  (yes, I&#39;m obviously hooked LOL)&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I plan on using my regular camera for the rest, and developing onto CD&#39;s, while also getting negatives.<br/>
<br/>
  Developed pictures are much better quality from  regular camera negs than a digital right now, unless you pay an arm and a leg and your first born child for a professional grade digital along with the dev. equipment (I think that is what I read).<br/>
<br/>
  ANyway....I guess the cheap 50.00 camera will suffice :o).<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
    Disposable digital didn&#39;t even make sense to me, so I googled it:<br/>
    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,65463,00.asp">http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,65463,00.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
    Before I bought a digital camera, I was having my photos developed by<br/>
    snapfish.com/  I mailed them my exposed roll, they sent me back photos, but<br/>
    also posted my photos on their website.  I could copy the photos onto my<br/>
    computer for email, making greeting cards, etc., and could also send friends<br/>
    a link to view my photos at snapfish.  You can also have your regular photos<br/>
    developed right onto CDs.  This type of service is now widely available.<br/>
<br/>
    As for price, I recommend thinking first about how you will use your camera.<br/>
    Do you want to zoom in on your kids?  Do you want to take panoramic photos<br/>
    while hiking?  You probably won&#39;t get both in a &quot;cheap&quot; digital.  Do you<br/>
    want a compact camera or do you care more about high quality photos?  Read<br/>
    reviews.  They are easy to find on-line.<br/>
<br/>
    Another price factor to consider is that printing your own digital photos is<br/>
    not cheap.  Unless you have a very good printer, special paper, and special<br/>
    ink, none of which are cheap, your photos will have sort of a &quot;newspapery&quot;<br/>
    look to them.  I still have some of my photos profesionally printed.<br/>
    (Services for this are widely available - you just bring in your flash card<br/>
    and they copy the photo from it.)<br/>
<br/>
    I love my digital camera for the intant processing of photos.  I can take<br/>
    photos at my child&#39;s birthday party, and the next day print out custom thank<br/>
    you notes for each guest.  I email photos of the kids to my mom.<br/>
<br/>
    Another factor I love is that it doesn&#39;t cost any more to take lots of extra<br/>
    photos.  I always take several of each shot, then delete the ones I don&#39;t<br/>
    like.<br/>
<br/>
    We got an extra rechargable battery and an extra large-capacity flash card.<br/>
    I can&#39;t imagine not having the extra battery.  Digital cameras burn<br/>
    batteries very quickly!<br/>
<br/>
    A factor I hadn&#39;t considered is that digital photography takes up a LOT of<br/>
    computer disk space.  If you have CD-RW drive, you can copy them onto CDs<br/>
    though.  If you can figure out how.  I&#39;m still working on that.  Can Kirby<br/>
    come visit me? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I have a Canon Elph and like the compact size.  It does well at close range,<br/>
    but not for scenic photos.  It also doesn&#39;t do well in very low light<br/>
    situations.  Dh wanted to get a more expensive one, but I insisted on having<br/>
    a camera that I wasn&#39;t afraid to touch!  And this one still cost more than<br/>
    the nicest still camera I ever bought.  Ours is a couple of years old now.<br/>
<br/>
    We bought a Barbie digital for Jackie when she was 6.  It is very low pixle,<br/>
    but she has a lot of fun with the software that came with it.<br/>
