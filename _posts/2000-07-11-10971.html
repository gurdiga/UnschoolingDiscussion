<div id="ygrps-yiv-314739298">Hi Everyone,<br/>
I havent posted an aweful lot lately. Sorry. How is everyone these days. Hope <br/>
your summers are going okay. We had a B-Day party for DD on Sunday. She just <br/>
turned 9. She had a great time, but  I often wonder if its wise to put7/8 <br/>
girls in one spot(we are so catty sometimes!) One of the girls has asthma(sp) <br/>
and smoke from campfires bothers her as does childrens play makeup anything <br/>
perfumey. Anyway the other kids were doing sparklers as did she but my dad <br/>
lit off the canon and that bothered her a bit. So she used her in-haler and <br/>
came and sat with me for a while. Not all of these girls  knew eachother most <br/>
of them are cousins but two of the girls who came are from my dd&#39;s first <br/>
school (she went 1st and 2cd0 The girl with asthma  and one of her other <br/>
friends. So they were calling her a snob. I felt so bad for her. I really <br/>
snapped and yelled at them all if they didnt learn to get along then everyone <br/>
was going home! (no Mary Poppins here!! EG) They were just so &quot;Clicky&quot; And I <br/>
really felt *Weird* because Im pretty close to that little girl she spends <br/>
alot of time at my house even though we moved two towns away. But some of the <br/>
*other* girls are my nieces. (&#39;That I love dearly) I did not like the feeling <br/>
that I had for the rest of the day. BTW my dad did not know she couldnt be <br/>
around the smoke otherwise he would have never lit off the canon.  She is <br/>
beginnig to grow out of it though , thats really good. Anyway sorry if my <br/>
thoughts are not all in one place tonight  like I said SCATTERBRAINS!! I just <br/>
feel  funny lately like Im disorganized or something. But when I look around <br/>
everything seems fine. I dont know sorry for babbleling and thanks for <br/>
listening. <br/>
If anything came out of the party its DD had a great time and I remembered <br/>
one of the reasons for homeschooling. She was the only one and it showed. BG<br/>
