<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My husband and I both smoke, and have since we were 
very young......I think the health part has alot to do with the way you look at 
it, I believe what you believe affects how you are affected by things.&nbsp; We 
have been taught that tobacco(plain tobacco)&nbsp; is sacred, and carries&nbsp; 
prayers to the creator.&nbsp; We do not smoke mainstream brand cigerettes, only 
100% tobacco.....we think that the chemicals that are added to the tobacco, are 
what are most addicting &amp; harmful.&nbsp; And we choose not to give money to 
the cigerette compnaies that put chemicals in their tobacco.&nbsp; But I&#39;ve 
thought alot on this topic, and I tend to think also that there are many other 
factors contributing to lunge cancer, which are purposefully not being looked at 
close enough.&nbsp; The pollution that cars &amp; trucks make in our cities 
everyday, must have an effect on the lungs, and no-one is about to say quit 
driving..they aren&#39;t even going to suggest that this may CAUSE lung 
cancer.&nbsp; How about the pollutants of many businesses.and products.you see 
the the clouds of chemical smoke going into the air, but are we stopping 
it??&nbsp;People use paints, and cleaning supplies that have harmful chemicals 
to the lungs, everyday. The war on tobacco companies is all about money...the 
facts, and tests are propaganda for one side or the other in my 
opinion...if.you&nbsp;inflict any extreme ammount of any constituant on any 
thing for a duration of time, and it will become toxic...High levels , and 
extremes are toxic of any one thing..vitamins, Minerals nutrients, Our bodies 
are made as such we need a variety of different things at different stages and 
times(in my opinion)&nbsp; Everything in Moderation.... It is not the tobacco 
itself that is the culprit of lung cancer, in my opinion.&nbsp;I am not saying 
that high levels of nicotine on an already weak lung will not affect it, surely 
it will. I think if one leads an overall healthy life, that this is very 
important &amp; this demonstrates respect for oneself, and the environment, but 
when it comes down to it, when the time comes , the time comes, whether you&#39;ve 
been a smoker or not.&nbsp; I do not think, personally that any death is before 
it&#39;s time, whatever the cause, and I&#39;am not dismmissing the pain caused by 
losing&nbsp; a loved one.... , and mean deeply not to offend anyone who has lost 
a family member whose autopsy stated lung cancer as the cause, Many Blessings to 
you, and may they be in peace.....but I think the best thing to suggest if you 
want to quit smoking is to either just STOP...or at least switch to an all 
organic tobacco, with no chemicals or additives, at least you will be more 
likely to quit when you are ready, and won&#39;t be contributing hard earned dollars 
to a company you do not believe or trust in.&nbsp; Just my 2 cents.......Totally 
NOT intending to make anyone mad, or insult anyone else&#39;s beliefs on this 
one.&nbsp; I also believe we all have a right to our place in the mind, meaning, 
I respect others to have the beliefs they have, and to be at the stage in life 
they are in.&nbsp; Everything is in it&#39;s place, and everything is in 
transition.&nbsp; But lastly, I do believe all plants, including tobacco to be 
Sacred, a gift from the Earth MOther..and Tobacco particularly to be a Sacred 
plant , whose smoke carries our prayers to the Spirit world......I do not 
support BIg Tobacco COmpanies, or any other Large Corporate Entity.&nbsp; Many 
Blessings in fullfilling that which you want for yourself.&nbsp;
