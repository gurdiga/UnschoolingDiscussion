<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513439983">&lt;&lt;maybe we need to find some fun poems&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Limericks, perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite childhood memories is writing letters back and forth with<br/>
my grandmother.  We did everything in limerick form.  It was so much fun.<br/>

&lt;&lt;intent on getting their own way&gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;help the child learn to be a better person&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First off, why does being predisposed to inactivity and wanting your own way<br/>
make you a less than good person?<br/>
<br/>
Second, how is describing your child that way to strangers on an email list<br/>
any different than describing your husband that way to people behind his<br/>
back?<br/>
<br/>
I think we are back to the need for accepting people as they are and helping<br/>
them change IF THEY CHOOSE to do so, not because we think they need to.<br/>

<br/>
I am not the original poster.  I think of myself as a fundamental<br/>
unschooler.  Many Christians see me as Pagan.  I follow the Bible only so<br/>
far as the teachings directly from Jesus.  Jesus said that children are who<br/>
we should strive to be like, he honored them on several occasions.  I feel<br/>
it is my duty and privilege to honor my children, to remember that they are<br/>
close to God.<br/>

  I am getting better at simply letting her be.  And have found that the<br/>
less I get involved (with prodding, what I think is encouraging, etc.)  the<br/>

and her 6yo sister know.  I didn&#39;t *say* anything about it,  just did it -<br/>
wrote it in large letters and taped it to the fridge.  I noticed her looking<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I went through my panic stage a couple of years ago, I didn&#39;t know <br/>
about this list.  I think my reading push was particularly bad for Lars <br/>
because of all the phone counselling I had done over the years.  He had <br/>
heard me tell other people time and again that their kids would read when <br/>
they were ready, that forced reading causes problems, that we can trust our <br/>
kids to learn what they need to know.  I really believed it, and yet, I <br/>
still panicked.  I&#39;m sure Lars must have felt really ripped off about <br/>
it.  (Yes, I have apologized.)  It was the dyslexia idea that got to <br/>
me.  What if he had a problem that was preventing his learning to read, and <br/>
I never did anything to help him with it?  I just carried it too far, <br/>
insisting rather than offering help.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing I didn&#39;t do that might have been a good idea is to start writing <br/>
him notes.  I waited until he could read reasonably first.  Looking back, I <br/>
could have made use of it earlier without his feeling bad about not being <br/>
able to read them perfectly.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s good you can see this now.  I got so focused for a while on what Lars <br/>
couldn&#39;t do, that I forgot to pay enough attention to what he could <br/>
do.  Since I&#39;ve been doing that, his self-esteem has jumped.  It&#39;s also <br/>
good that you are aware of what each of your kids is good at.  I assume you <br/>
point it out to them as well (or to other people when the kids are <br/>
listening.)  I was concerned that my granddaughter (just turning 7) would <br/>
read before Lars.  Since they are so close in age, and Skye is here a lot, <br/>
they tend to act more like siblings than uncle and niece.  He&#39;s still ahead <br/>
of her in reading, but she&#39;s really keen to be able to do it.  And she does <br/>
tend to be competitive with him.    For a while she seemed ready to copy <br/>
him in everything else, like sports and stuff.  Now she&#39;s moving into the <br/>
things she really loves, like drama and dance and music.  It&#39;s obvious how <br/>
different they are, and that they&#39;re both fine.<br/>

carrying it through.  I just wish I had had this list then.  In just a few <br/>
months, I&#39;ve been challenged to change a lot of my parenting and <br/>
homeschooling practises.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544770776">Hi Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t mind if I jump in here.  In my opinion, as an <br/>
unschooler, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to protect my boys from every <br/>
single hurtful person they come across.  Unfortunately, unfairness and <br/>
rudeness is something we can not protect them from all of the time.  But <br/>
we can try.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with TRYING for perfection.  Even <br/>
though we try, they will still be exposed to unpleasant situations.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a need for us as parents to describe them in <br/>
negative terms (in their presence, or not in their presence) just so <br/>
they can be prepared to enter the &quot;real&quot; world.  I happen to think my <br/>
boys are already in the real world and they are exposed to many good <br/>
things, a well as bad.  I also know that should my boys encounter a <br/>
situation in the future (as an adult) that they have not yet <br/>
experienced, they will be able to handle it.<br/>
<br/>
I have never called my boys &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;willful&quot; and I hope I never do.  <br/>
I believe that would be very hurtful and it would affect them in a very <br/>
negative way.  It would make them feel less about themselves and demean <br/>
them and that would be contrary to the philosophy of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who knows me will agree that I am VERY far from perfect, but that <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I shouldn&#39;t keep trying.  I am definitely guilty for <br/>
modeling rude and poor behaviour to my kids.  And, my husband uses some <br/>
pretty foul language at times.  Of course, my boys have learned some of <br/>
these things, and I don&#39;t like it much, but this is just the reality of <br/>
our particular family.  They have learned plenty from our mistakes and <br/>
they are and will be prepared for the real world.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people on this list who have a much more <br/>
relaxed family than we do, but even they can not protect their children <br/>
from everything.  So, there is no need for us to consciously label our <br/>
children for their own good.  Anyway, as unschoolers, aren&#39;t we supposed <br/>
to respect our childrens&#39; choices and if they want to do nothing then <br/>
allow them to do nothing.  That is their choice.  They should not be <br/>
called &quot;lazy&quot;.  This is my opinion.<br/>
<br/>

imo, people tend to live up to the expectations of others. If somebody tells you repeatedly that you&#39;re a great dancer, by golly, you&#39;re going to keep dancing and dancing and before you know it, you *are* a great dancer. OTOH, if somebody repeatedly tells you that you&#39;re stupid, well... you start believing it. Same with the words willful or lazy.... talented or bright. IMO it&#39;s all in how you present it.<br/>

sure that &quot;marketing&quot; is not a part of my family life and honesty <br/>
is.  That means using terms accurately.  If one of us (including me <br/>
or my dh) is being lazy, it is perfectly okay for the others to point <br/>
it out.  We don&#39;t just ignore it and hope for the best.  And <br/>
sometimes hearing it sparks a rejuvenation of sorts.  At the very <br/>
least it gives one incentive to look within once in a while.<br/>
But then, I guess this presumes that the people involved are content <br/>
and secure enough with each other not to allow an observation to be <br/>
hurtful.  My 16 year old can tell me I am being lazy without hurting <br/>
my feelings.  I can tell her she is sleeping too much (yet again) <br/>
without hurting hers.  <br/>

Sandra is no longer here. She started her own list as you already know. There is really no point in dragging up old arguments. We&#39;re trying to get a fresh start here and make this list a pleasant place to dissect the issues of unschooling. We can pick apart the issues, disagree with one another but I, for one, would really like to see this ugliness cease. Plenty of people had something to say about labeling and diagnosing kids with reading problems. Nobody stooped to calling me ugly names (thank you &lt;g&gt;) yet everybody got to bring their POV to the table.  <br/>
Which brings us to this point. You stated your way of dealing with words in your family. Others wrote in in opposition and you rebutted. End of thread *unless* you feel you were misquoted or misunderstood and then, by all means, I&#39;d hope you&#39;d try to clarify. <br/>
Please... I need a place where we can toss things out for discussion and debate and I&#39;d imagine others are here for the same reason. If a thread stirs up so much anger, can the parties involved take it off list or just drop it?<br/>
.. not trying to be a list-police... just wishing we could all hang out under the same roof in peace<br/>
