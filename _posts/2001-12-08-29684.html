<div id="ygrps-yiv-7836906">&lt;&lt;why can&#39;t Bridget adjust for her son&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here I am responding for Bridget....who&#39;d a thunk it?<br/>
<br/>
I too have an 8yo son who is anxiety ridden, a floor flopper, etc..  What<br/>
may be going on with Bridget, and I know goes on here, is that with 4 other<br/>
kids (3 of them 5 and under) I simply don&#39;t have the time to cater to every<br/>
desire of my sons or of anybody else for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
I work very hard to make sure everybody&#39;s needs are met as much as I can.<br/>
When I fall short, we talk to each other and try to come up with solutions.<br/>
But I can&#39;t always stop whatever I&#39;m doing (changing a diaper, fixing supper<br/>
for the 3 little hungry guys, helping older dd coral an ornery goat, etc..)<br/>
and go upstairs with Zach everytime he wants a different car to play with.<br/>
I am not wonder woman, wish I was, but sometimes the answer isn&#39;t &quot;no&quot;, it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;Give me 5 minutes&quot; or &quot;How about later?  I can&#39;t right now.&quot;  And that can<br/>
be enough to cause a floor flop.<br/>
