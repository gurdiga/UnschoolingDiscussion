<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would respectfully disagree with this statement. When I think of Bart<br/>
&gt; Simpson, a show my kids love to watch (often) I seen no learning, teaching<br/>
&gt; value from it. Rather, I see it as simply entertainment... nothing more. I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t quite grasp how you (Ren) draw the conclusion that to consider some tv<br/>
&gt; as *not* educational is not &quot;embracing unschooling in it&#39;s most joyful<br/>
&gt; form&quot;.<br/>
&gt; IMO everything does not have to be educational.<br/>
&gt; I guess I lost your train of thought on this ... ??<br/>

*Lisa finds herself dissatisfied with her family&#39;s religion, discovers <br/>
Buddhism, to the great concern of her family, THEN discovers she can be <br/>
uddhist and STILL celebrate Christmas with her family.<br/>
*A BRILLIANT episode on homophobia (with John Waters)<br/>
*Bart discovers the danger of irresponible use of weapons AND in caring for <br/>
bird&#39;s eggs that SEEM normal...<br/>
*Guest appearances by Stephen Hawking, Dick Cavett, Mandy Patinkin, Steve <br/>
Allen......etc....<br/>
*Regular references to popular culture, classic movies and books, etc., <br/>
etc....<br/>
<br/>
That said, &quot;educational&quot; is not the only reason to do something. But you&#39;d be <br/>
surprised where you can learn things.<br/>
