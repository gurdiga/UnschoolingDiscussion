&lt;&lt;The result was a very vocal and mature child at a very young age. By the <br/>
age of 2, an adult could actually sit and have a conversation with her. I <br/>
mean a real converstation. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mary: Tara sounds  a lot like our Kalie - the sad part was that so few adults <br/>
(my parents included) even believed she could understand what she was <br/>
conversing about. Big mistake! We&#39;ve had some great talks!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When I would take her to a rare occasion where there were other little <br/>
kids, she would refuse to play with them. Always said they did stupid stuff <br/>
that <br/>
she wasn&#39;t interested in. I took her everywhere with me, but again she was <br/>
only around adults. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a difference: Kalie does enjoy time with other children - a lot; <br/>
particularly the older ones, as we discussed before, relative to <br/>
occassionally hitting in her own age group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now she&#39;s great and very social but she missed a lot of being a kid. I&#39;m <br/>
sure some of it was just her personality but a lot of it was also me screwing <br/>
up.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Why do you feel you screwed up? Did you feel you should have exposed her to <br/>
more children? I&#39;m just wondering if maybe the aloofness wasn&#39;t just a part <br/>
of who Tara was when she was small. (I was like that myself, but I came from <br/>
an abusive home - unfortunately I really was &#39;different&#39;.)<br/>

Well that&#39;s a good thing I would say. That she enjoys being around other <br/>
kids, no matter what the age.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why do you feel you screwed up? Did you feel you should have exposed her <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes I do think me not really knowing &quot;what to do with a baby, toddler&quot; was a <br/>
big part of how her personality was shaped. I think it made her (Tara) <br/>
harder when she &quot;had&quot; to go out in the world of school. (sorry for the dirty <br/>
word!) Like I said I had no friends who had little children and didn&#39;t do <br/>
support groups or playgroups or anything like that. She was always just with <br/>
me and my mom. We went out almost every day but it was like shopping and <br/>
stuff. Not really stuff a kid would like to do. Although Tara is a major <br/>
shopper to this day!! And yes there is a part of me that believes a lot of <br/>
it was just who Tara was, but I also believe that I instilled a lot more of <br/>
that in her.<br/>
<br/>
Now with our 3 other children, I don&#39;t force child play or make play dates <br/>
even once a week. But they have each other and play well. Being that they <br/>
are 7, 6 and 2, it&#39;s a built in playdate every day. Plus I have been doing <br/>
fun kid stuff with them from very early on. I do think it makes a very big <br/>
difference. Add that with my homeschooling support groups and field trips <br/>
and park days, they get just enough and not too much for them. As they get <br/>
older, I figure they&#39;ll ask if they need more interaction. Tara never asked <br/>
and just went from snobby I don&#39;t want to play with you kid to 12 year old <br/>
know it all wanna be 18. It was very hard for us all.<br/>

I chose to have one child, and now I&#39;m stuck with my<br/>
decision.  Hubby&#39;s had the pipeline snipped.  Most of<br/>
the time I&#39;m fine with that, but sometimes......<br/>
<br/>
I had thought that we would adopt or become foster<br/>
parents by now, but money and space has made me think<br/>
twice. ( and thrice).<br/>
<br/>
I do love to help friends and family with their very<br/>
young ones, and that makes me feel better. <br/>

Well, we can&#39;t make babies with stuff we have lying around the house. And <br/>
Julian has a strong preference for being an only child. Given the effort it would <br/>
take to come up with additional kids, he gets a strong vote.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I have a job where I get to be with lots of kids and I <br/>
always get to hold the babies. It&#39;s cool.<br/>
