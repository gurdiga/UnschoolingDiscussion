<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157238163">Help me out here folks!<br/>
<br/>
A friend has a son who is having a very hard time in school. He&#39;s only in<br/>
grade one but having lots of &quot;behaviour problems&quot;--lashing out at other<br/>
kids, refusing to do schoolwork, throwing stuff, ripping up math sheets etc<br/>
(you go, guy!).<br/>
<br/>
This is a very physical child, also very sweet, smart and nature oriented,<br/>
who has also been through some &quot;stuff&quot; and does have some social<br/>
difficulties, quick temper etc. but nothing severe or unsolvable.<br/>
<br/>
I KNOW this kid could flourish outside of school (who wouldn&#39;t?). He is very<br/>
self-directed and has clear interests, few of which are covered during<br/>
indoor school hours. The parents are seriously drawn to<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling but it&#39;s very new to them and they feel<br/>
unsure/insecure, especially as the teacher is saying that this child will<br/>
never learn to overcome his social problems if he&#39;s not in school.<br/>
<br/>
A big concern the mom has is that she already feels overwhelmed and<br/>
sometimes doesn&#39;t treat her child as gently as she&#39;d wish yells, nags etc)<br/>
and has some depression which she believes may be contributing to her son&#39;s<br/>
problems. She&#39;s worried having him full-time wouldn&#39;t be best for him but<br/>
really hates the idea of sending him to school another day where he&#39;s<br/>
miserable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling rather unhelpful as I mostly find myself  saying things like<br/>
&quot;AAARGH!&quot; rather than anything coherent or intelligent when they tell me<br/>
this stuff about school. I&#39;m too emotionally involved i think (I love this<br/>
family and really want this kid to quit school!).<br/>
<br/>
Anybody have some good rational feedback to help these folks out (or rather<br/>
to help me help them out?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59321406">The family sounds like they would benefit from Unschooling much more than <br/>
Traditional HS. Mom needs to work on parenting and yelling. It is hard for some <br/>
and will take lots of patience. Each family member needs their own time to feel <br/>
complete and not bitter about space or stresses like school, money and money. <br/>
I wrote money twice because that seems to be our starting stress/meltdown in <br/>
our home.<br/>
If they try to relax and let life happen their son should come around. Not to <br/>
mention many issues in school tend to disappear when the child is brought <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
Can she join Unschooling 101? <br/>

<br/>
You might suggest that they try it just for the rest of this year.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll probably be hooked.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s pretty hard to be too far behind for second grade.  So it&#39;s not like <br/>
moving to the moon, it&#39;s like taking a vacation and going back next year (or <br/>
so it will seem to them, I bet).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
He probably wouldn&#39;t HAVE the problems if he wasn&#39;t in school.<br/>
If he&#39;s not ready, he&#39;s not ready!!<br/>

it might be helpful to the mom. :)<br/>

but<br/>
really hates the idea of sending him to school another day where he&#39;s<br/>
miserable.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
As someone else mentioned, it need not be a set-in-stone forever<br/>
decision to take him out for now. (heh,heh,heh) I think it would help to<br/>
point out to her that the specific behaviors that you mention are<br/>
totally caused by school, and by school&#39;s intrusion into his home in the<br/>
form of homework. It may help her to remember how he was at home prior<br/>
to going to school for the first time. Perhaps she feels overwhelmed<br/>
*because* she is conflicted in her heart, rather than conflicted because<br/>
she is overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
The other idea that may help her feel more confident is that just<br/>
because he is not in school, does not mean that she has to be<br/>
responsible for filling his time 24 hours a day. I am with Jayn (now 4)<br/>
most of the time, but her Dad takes her out fairly often, and she does<br/>
ballet for an hour once a week, when I get to chat with the other hs&#39;ing<br/>
moms at the class. Sometimes she plays with other kids. She also spends<br/>
a lot of time watching DVD&#39;s, engaging in self-directed fantasy play<br/>
with her dolls, playing computer games (minimal help needed), and doing<br/>
her craft projects. It actually surprises me how much time I get to sit<br/>
at the computer sometimes. If Jayn had a grandmother near, and not<br/>
nutty, I would have even more time. <br/>
<br/>
If they are online, I would also direct them to www.naturalchild.org<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naturalchild.org/">http://www.naturalchild.org/</a>&gt;   for respectful parenting info. At any<br/>
rate I like that site, and it has helped me. That way the parenting and<br/>
the educational choices aren&#39;t intertwined. We know them as intertwined<br/>
because we are further along on the journey of Unschooling as lifestyle<br/>
choice, but it may help your friend with her worries. Gentle mindful<br/>
parenting strategies will help her regardless of whether they bring<br/>
their boy home from school or not.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;especially as the teacher is saying that this child will<br/>
never learn to overcome his social problems if he&#39;s not in school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
It&#39;s hard to let go of our ingrained respect for &quot;experts&quot; - ingrained<br/>
by school itself. However the teacher is hampered by both self-interest,<br/>
and his/her own biased education. What do grade school teachers get<br/>
nowadays - one semester of &quot;child psychology&quot; or &quot;classroom management&quot;<br/>
techniques designed to suppress the individual to make the group more<br/>
cohesive???? I don&#39;t know, nor is that my point. My point is that your<br/>
friends may be giving the teacher&#39;s opinion an undeserved weight simply<br/>
because of the habit of a lifetime and the teacher&#39;s status as an<br/>
expert. Your friends are the experts in their son. <br/>
<br/>
Was it Mary or Anne speaking at the conference about how she had an<br/>
epiphany when she asked the school principal what the school&#39;s goals<br/>
were for her child? Maybe these parents need to examine what the<br/>
teacher&#39;s goals are, implied or explicit, for their son. Are they goals<br/>
they would *want* to support? Are they goals that require school, and<br/>
only school, to achieve them? Are they goals that only relate to school<br/>
(e.g. ability to work quietly in a large group not of his choosing, on a<br/>
project not of his choosing, for a time frame not of his choosing). I<br/>
think the teacher is betraying ignorance and bias just by the use of the<br/>
label of &quot;his&quot; social &quot;problems&quot;. If they are social problems by<br/>
definition wouldn&#39;t the group be at least partly to &quot;blame&quot;? Perhaps<br/>
she/he is feeling like a failure and can&#39;t deal with it. &quot;Never&quot; is a<br/>
pretty portentous word, a pretty final word, a pretty definitive word to<br/>
use in reference to a six or seven year old. I guess none of us have<br/>
ever changed in our personality or actions or likes or social abilities<br/>
since we were six, so it is clear that these are the most crucial years<br/>
to mold him to a fitting cog in the machine. Oh now I&#39;m just getting<br/>
irritated with that dopey teacher, much like you wanting to say<br/>
&quot;aarrrggghh!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, Sandra mentioned taking him out for the rest of the year. I think this<br/>
feels like such a huge decision for the parents. I was thinking of<br/>
suggesting just keeping him home for a week, and maybe I&#39;m just overly<br/>
optimistic or something but I was thinking that by then they&#39;d already be<br/>
hooked! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps she feels overwhelmed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *because* she is conflicted in her heart, rather than conflicted because<br/>
&gt; she is overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good point. One thing that is especially hard is that the parents are being<br/>
pressured by the school to back up the &quot;discipline&quot; when the parents don&#39;t<br/>
give a shit about the worksheets and the silly rules. But they still have<br/>
this thought that the boy needs to learn &quot;respect&quot;--hmmm... i think i need<br/>
to point out that respect is learned when one feels repected...<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the helpful thoughts and further questions to help figure this<br/>
out. I heard the dad speak out in defense of his son today and feel<br/>
confident this little boy is going to be supported to rise out sooner or<br/>
later.<br/>
