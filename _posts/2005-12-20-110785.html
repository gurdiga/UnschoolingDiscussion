<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886737822">I&#39;ve enjoyed reading about Mr. Bentley and the snowflake convo.<br/>
As a kid, I remember having many conversations with my very wise <br/>
Grandad, who told me how every single snowflake was unique.<br/>
&quot;All of them?&quot; I&#39;d ask in awe.<br/>
&quot;yep&quot;<br/>
Well, being the kind of kid I was, I said &quot;How do they know that? <br/>
There are millions and millions and they can&#39;t check every single one, <br/>
I bet there ARE some that are the same&quot;<br/>
He laughed and said that research supported them being completely <br/>
unique.<br/>
Then once-upon-a-time, when I was still young and newly living on my <br/>
own far from family, he mailed me an article. It was about a scientist <br/>
that seemed to have found two identicle snowflakes!! That was a cool <br/>
moment.<br/>
