I thought your quote was very appropriate although it may not immediately<br/>
have appeared to be.<br/>

Isn&#39;t this what people who are not open to debate and stick to their<br/>
emotional &#39;security&#39; are doing ?<br/>
<br/>
They feel more comfortable sticking with usually long-held views, or views<br/>
which don&#39;t question too much how they&#39;re living because it&#39;s more<br/>
comfortable to think that way, regardless of the rights and wrongs of it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you just have to accept that no matter how convincing or strong<br/>
your case, you are not going to change some people&#39;s minds.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand there is no excuse for continually bringing up your<br/>
opinions when you are not prepared to debate them reasonably.<br/>
<br/>
People should have the freedom to wallow in their own little world of<br/>
self-deceit if they wish, as long as they don&#39;t try to get me to join them.<br/>

<br/>
It seems to me that the people with the emotional blockages are generally<br/>
the ones who try to keep everything on an intellectual (or<br/>
pseudo-intellectual) plane. They say things like, &quot;He has to know his<br/>
multiplication tables or he&#39;ll never get into college&quot;, but the<br/>
underlying blockage is something like, &quot;I am terrified of screwing up as<br/>
a parent and having my child end up homeless like my uncle.&quot;  In cases<br/>
where people insist on defending their actions of the past, I can&#39;t help<br/>
but wonder if their sense of self-worth is so fragile that they can&#39;t<br/>
deal with the idea that they were wrong. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that people who are blocked generally get their hackles up<br/>
when others try to talk about the emotional ramifications of what their<br/>
doing, especially the ramifications for their children. During the recent<br/>
Defense of Spanking thing, the original poster tried to use<br/>
pseudo-intellectual reasoning about how it was necessary and the choice<br/>
was either that or her child be hit by a car, while other posters were<br/>
focusing on the emotional responses a child might have to being hit and<br/>
humiliated in public. She couldn&#39;t acknowledge that at all, she couldn&#39;t<br/>
deal with the emotional impact of what she had done so she ignored it and<br/>
pretended it didn&#39;t exist, or that it was necessary and therefore<br/>
unworthy of comment. I can&#39;t think of any way to get through to someone<br/>
in that place except getting her to acknowledge those emotions, but<br/>
acknowledging those emotions in her child would have meant admitting to<br/>
herself that she has caused them, and she wasn&#39;t willing to do that yet.<br/>
It takes a lot of courage, to face up to your mistakes as a parent. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose there are two ways to deal with someone like that. You can be<br/>
non-confrontive, and suppport the good things they&#39;re doing, and hope<br/>
that eventually the person is able to see past their blockage. In a one<br/>
to one situation with someone who doesn&#39;t seem real ready to change, that<br/>
would seem like a good option. On a huge email list, though, where the<br/>
point of the list is to help hundreds of people get somewhere, not just<br/>
one person, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s feasible. If ideas contrary to the point<br/>
of the list are left out there, unchallenged, then it changes the point<br/>
of the list and waters it down, and that&#39;s not fair to the hundreds of<br/>
other people on the list. <br/>
<br/>
I think learning about unschooling is the goal here, rather than peace. <br/>
I&#39;d prefer to have respectful, fruitful discussions, because it&#39;s a lot<br/>
more pleasant, but if I have to chose between some strife and<br/>
&quot;Unschooling-lite&quot;, I would chose the former...<br/>

Interesting discussion.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to<br/>
get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude.<br/>
See in college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the<br/>
natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that<br/>
you shall learn what you have no taste or capacity for.  The college,<br/>
which should be a place of delightful labor, is made odious and<br/>
unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to<br/>
rally their jaded spirits.  I would have the studies elective.<br/>
Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure<br/>
interest in knowledge.  The wise instructor accomplishes this by opening<br/>
to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself.  The<br/>
marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for boys, not for<br/>
men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor.&quot;<br/>

www.unschooling.com is pretty good on that sort of thing, because people can <br/>
start their own topic and put it in whatever folder they think is most likely <br/>
to attract the sort of input they want.<br/>
<br/>
The new HEM lists might be great for that too.<br/>

<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
And in the case of the bus-stop spanking story, the author turned out not to <br/>
be a homeschooler (yet, considering it), not an unschooler, and so as a story <br/>
it was fine.  As advice, it wasn&#39;t.  As a challenge and insult to <br/>
non-spankers, it was no good at all.<br/>
<br/>
Many people are volunteering to share information for the benefit of each <br/>
other and lurker-others or those who pass by and read for an hour or a day and <br/>
keep going.  Some of them might be further willing to volunteer to play <br/>
counsellor for emotionally blocked individuals, but nobody can ask us ALL to change <br/>
the focus of the list from information, experience and ideas to the mental <br/>
health of individuals.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; if they are stuck on it emotionally, <br/>
they won&#39;t be able to hear what we&#39;re saying&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s true, that is beyond the scope of the intent and purpose of the <br/>
list, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t understand football, but nobody asks the players to play <br/>
slower and tell the onlookers what they&#39;re about to do and why.  <br/>
<br/>
There are boxed things to buy for people who aren&#39;t able to understand <br/>
unschooling.  We have little to nothing to sell here (thought I expect that <br/>
conference is going to be pretty wonderful!!).  If unschooling takes self-examination <br/>
and openness to ideas and trust, those are the things it takes.  If someone <br/>
can&#39;t do it that&#39;s fine.  I can&#39;t do gymnastics.  I can&#39;t speak Arabic.  Those <br/>
things limit my options on earth.  <br/>
<br/>
If what&#39;s being offered free isn&#39;t accessible to a few individuals because <br/>
they are too emotionally blocked, then they need to work on their personal <br/>
selves, not get angry with people who DO understand it and CAN discuss it and who <br/>
have it working well in their families.<br/>
<br/>
Yet there are MANY people who came to unschooling and honestly tried to con<br/>
sider the ideas, and they tried the suggestions, and their families started <br/>
becoming happier and more peaceful.  And many have reported that as their children <br/>
began to relax and love their lives, that the parents begin to rethink all <br/>
KINDS of things they believed were true.<br/>
<br/>
Unless people are willing to try it, they can&#39;t understand it or believe it.  <br/>
Lots of people every day share how they got from one point to another, with <br/>
lots of practical suggestions and reassurances.<br/>
<br/>
This makes sense too:<br/>
-=-It seems to me that the people with the emotional blockages are generally<br/>
the ones who try to keep everything on an intellectual (or<br/>
pseudo-intellectual) plane. They say things like, &quot;He has to know his<br/>
multiplication tables or he&#39;ll never get into college&quot;, but the<br/>
underlying blockage is something like, &quot;I am terrified of screwing up as<br/>
a parent and having my child end up homeless like my uncle.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
So they can try it or they can decide not to try it, but to stay and just <br/>
tell us we&#39;re wrong and not nice enough for their delicate selves doesn&#39;t help <br/>
anyone.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve noticed that people who are blocked generally get their hackles up<br/>
when others try to talk about the emotional ramifications of what their<br/>
doing, especially the ramifications for their children. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That happens a lot too.   If it seems flashing-neon plain to half a dozen <br/>
readers that someone is NOT as relaxed as she says she is, how patient do the <br/>
volunteers need to be with a flowing tirade of &quot;I *AM* relaxed, I SAID I am <br/>
relaxed, WHY don&#39;t you people just READ exactly what I WROTE, instead of GUESSING <br/>
with NO evidence that I&#39;m not relaxed!???!??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some people need to visit self-help lists a while first to learn to be <br/>
calm and at peace with themselves and their children, and then come to <br/>
unschooling lists after they&#39;re relaxed and able to consider ideas that have to do <br/>
with parent/child relations and with trusting children.  <br/>

problems, it&#39;s not here for that, although I&#39;ve found that the<br/>
unschooling journey has helped me resolve some of my underlying life<br/>

there&#39;s not much left to give to learning about unschooling your kids...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Group A: People coming here don&#39;t necessarily think they have problems <br/>
TO fix.<br/>
<br/>
Group B: Some of us think we do and always will have problems that <br/>
could use fixing - because we see progress as part of (maybe the <br/>
purpose of) life. Fix one, another becomes visible. For everybody.<br/>
<br/>
Those are two very very different mindsets. When someone criticizes one <br/>
of their ideas - Group B&#39;s immediately think, &quot;Hmmm - wonder if THIS is <br/>
pointing one of those places I need to work on fixing?&quot;  They may not <br/>
see it, they may not believe it, but the possibility exists in their <br/>
minds and that allows communication and so disagreements with them <br/>
seldom erupt into nastiness.<br/>
<br/>
Group A&#39;s often don&#39;t really even seem to understand what&#39;s going on - <br/>
they think they are personally under attack and they have to defend <br/>
themselves. It doesn&#39;t occur to them that it is just their idea about <br/>
something - that they can benefit, anyway, from the discussion by <br/>
working hard to clearly articulating why they don&#39;t buy the other <br/>
side&#39;s arguments. The Group B&#39;s end an argument where minds were <br/>
unchanged with - &quot;Well, you&#39;ve given me a lot to consider. Thank you.&quot; <br/>
Group A&#39;s end an argument by leaving angrily and going off and <br/>
complaining elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
On this list, Group A&#39;s are in the minority - but the others will jump <br/>
in when they think someone is being attacked who doesn&#39;t like it. I&#39;ve <br/>
been defended a time or two by people who thought I was being attacked <br/>
- but didn&#39;t realize that I was THRILLED with the opportunity to <br/>
clarify and articulate my own ideas and that the other person was doing <br/>
me a favor. But to Group A people, they felt my deeply-held beliefs <br/>
were being bludgeoned with logic - well, yeah - how cool is that?<br/>
<br/>
of COURSE it is more complex than two groups - some are in group A when <br/>
it comes to some issues and group B for others - we can never keep them <br/>
sorted out.<br/>
<br/>
The question is how do we let the Group B stuff happen without the <br/>
Group A people getting upset?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035860709">I wanted to add one more thing --  it would be very helpful if people <br/>
simply didn&#39;t post anything that is essentially reiterating what they <br/>
already said, unless they think they&#39;ve come up with a brilliant new <br/>
way to explain it.  Even those who love to have their ideas challenged <br/>
get cross when they read the same argument 20 times - I know that if it <br/>
didn&#39;t make sense to me the first time or two I&#39;m not likely to get it <br/>
the 19th time and certainly no more likely the 20th time.<br/>

I know for sure that I suffer from the misperception that if I just say <br/>
it again that someone will &quot;get it&quot; this time.<br/>

I have an excuse - I teach college and studies show that in a lecture <br/>
situation you really only have 20 percent of your students paying close <br/>
attention at any one time - so repetition catches new people. (And I <br/>

there are hundreds of extremely competent people on the list and that  <br/>

differently and better for the person I&#39;m talking to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826575930">This was posted on the new NoSpanking list and I couldn&#39;t resist <br/>
passing it along to all of you.  I&#39;m not a sticker fan - but as an <br/>
alternative to spanking? Heck yeah!<br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
&quot;Spanking... increases the rate of street entries by children&quot;, wrote <br/>
Dr. Dennis Embry in a letter to Children Magazine .<br/>
<br/>
Since 1977 I have been heading up the only long-term project designed <br/>
to counteract pedestrian accidents to preschool-aged children. <br/>
(Surprisingly, getting struck by a car is about the third leading cause <br/>
of death to young children in the United States.)<br/>
<br/>
Actual observation of parents and children shows that spanking, <br/>
scolding, reprimanding and nagging INCREASES the rate of street entries <br/>
by children. Children use going into the street as a near-perfect way <br/>
to gain parents&#39; attention.<br/>
<br/>
Now there is a promising new educational intervention program, called <br/>
Safe Playing.  The underlying principles of the program are simple:<br/>
<br/>
1. Define safe boundaries in a POSITIVE way.  &#39;Safe players play on the <br/>
grass or sidewalk.&#39;<br/>
2. Give stickers for safe play.  That makes it more fun than playing <br/>
dangerously.<br/>
3. Praise your child for safe play.<br/>
<br/>
These three principles have an almost instant effect on  increasing <br/>
safe play.  We have observed children who had been spanked many times a <br/>
day for going into the street, yet they continued to do it.  The moment <br/>
the family began giving stickers and praise for safe play, the children <br/>
stopped going into the street.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132575530">I can&#39;t wait for your math talk at the conference!  This was so logical and made sets so practical. &lt;g&gt; I am right that you are the math professor and are giving the talk?  I hope?<br/>
 <br/>
I agree wholeheartedly that once it gets to the point the spanking impasse came to  (well, it was thankfully a discussion for some, part of the time) that the unbudging party is not going to accept any kind of emotional theories being thrown her way (even ever so gently) because this would mean taking respionsibility for her actions and if it has been so difficult after days of people attempting to show her, she isn&#39;t going to get it without more personal probing and patient feedback than I can imagine this list being able to handle.  Sorry about the run-on-sentence.  I am glad to have finally vented a little about the frustration I was feeling lurking on and off this past week, seeing the people who are helping me to make such huge changes being so wrongly attacked!  Second run-on of the night...  <br/>
 <br/>
I would also ask, how can the group B people not get upset by Group A stuff?  I know all my buttons were pushed by the Jeva stuff and wished I could just let it go more.<br/>

Group A&#39;s often don&#39;t really even seem to understand what&#39;s going on - <br/>
they think they are personally under attack and they have to defend <br/>
themselves. It doesn&#39;t occur to them that it is just their idea about <br/>
something - that they can benefit, anyway, from the discussion by <br/>
working hard to clearly articulating why they don&#39;t buy the other <br/>
side&#39;s arguments. The Group B&#39;s end an argument where minds were <br/>
unchanged with - &quot;Well, you&#39;ve given me a lot to consider. Thank you.&quot; <br/>
Group A&#39;s end an argument by leaving angrily and going off and <br/>
complaining elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
On this list, Group A&#39;s are in the minority - but the others will jump <br/>
in when they think someone is being attacked who doesn&#39;t like it. I&#39;ve <br/>
been defended a time or two by people who thought I was being attacked <br/>
- but didn&#39;t realize that I was THRILLED with the opportunity to <br/>
clarify and articulate my own ideas and that the other person was doing <br/>
me a favor. But to Group A people, they felt my deeply-held beliefs <br/>
were being bludgeoned with logic - well, yeah - how cool is that?<br/>
<br/>
of COURSE it is more complex than two groups - some are in group A when <br/>
it comes to some issues and group B for others - we can never keep them <br/>
sorted out.<br/>
<br/>
The question is how do we let the Group B stuff happen without the <br/>
Group A people getting upset?<br/>

If you&#39;re building a sand castle and someone walks through the middle of it, <br/>
it&#39;s hard not to be upset.<br/>

We build and rebuild this all the time, but it&#39;s WAY more fun to have someone <br/>

just like you described, people get an emotional (and stubborn) attachment to <br/>
the way they believe, and will not budge no matter what tone someone tried to <br/>
point it out with and not matter how much sense those opposed are making.  At <br/>
least that&#39;s what I see.<br/>
