<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780923794">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I thought people here (and perhaps especially their teenage unschoolers)<br/>
might be interested in this essay by Paul Graham:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html</a><br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a computer nerd type, and writes lots about and from that<br/>
perspective, but often his thoughts on how the school system works leads<br/>
him to very unschoolish perspectives.  This essay is discussing the<br/>
relative merits of jumping in and trying to start a company in your late<br/>
teens or early twenties rather than trying to follow the school -&gt; job<br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it&#39;s not too off topic,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413373089">He actually has a whole series of articles that are<br/>
interesting.  For instance, his article<br/>
&quot;What you&#39;d wish you&#39;d known&quot; is very unschoolish!<br/>
