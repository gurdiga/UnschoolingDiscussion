<div id="ygrps-yiv-26401369">As a pagan/UU this whole thread SINGS for me. In my beliefs, we ARE all<br/>
the  children of God/dess so treating our kids as such - WOW! It never<br/>
struck home with me until whomever (Johanna?) posted that bit about<br/>
treating our kids as the messiah. Now I&#39;ve been making a list of things<br/>
that I say  that I  would NEVER say to Jesus or Buddha or Mohammet or<br/>
Taliesin - and Ithink I&#39;m beginning to hear how I  must sound to my<br/>
son. So thank you all for this thread!<br/>
<br/>
If I seem a bit incoherent it&#39;s &#39;cause I  was up all night with a friend<br/>
whose brother is an EMT in Manhattan and is listed among the missing.<br/>

When I shared with Dh about this thread and seeing our<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children as the Messiah. He said ooh that makes a lot<br/>
&gt; of sense. Just think his mother believed he was the<br/>
&gt; son of God. So when she looked at him she saw the son<br/>
&gt; of God. So she always saw good. So how could Jesus<br/>
&gt; help but become good. So it has become very important<br/>
&gt; to me to see the true pure child even when her<br/>
&gt; behavior does not seem in accordance with that. That<br/>
&gt; upset/negative behavior is only an aberation or an<br/>
&gt; indication of some unmet need.<br/>
