<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227910154">Ren posted something that might not make much sense without the  <br/>
knowledge that Diana Jenner (who has posted here sometimes as  <br/>
HaHaMommy) has lost her daughter, Hannah, to leukemia.  If you want  <br/>
to send flowers or a note, the address is here.<br/>
<br/>
Diana Jenner<br/>
1218 South First Avenue<br/>
Sioux Falls, SD 57105<br/>
<br/>
If you think you might have met Hannah at one of the last two Live  <br/>
and Learn conferences but aren&#39;t sure, there are some photos here<br/>

<br/>
If you would like to know how else you might help, please write to me  <br/>
directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a><br/>
If that address is truncated,<br/>
it&#39;s my first name at my whole name dot com<br/>
<br/>
The obituary is this, and otherwise I&#39;d like to keep the discussion  <br/>
off this list if we can.  Thanks.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; Hannah Lea Jenner left this life peacefully, in her mother&#39;s arms,<br/>
&gt;&gt; early on February 24, 2006.   She was 9.5 years old and had a smile<br/>
&gt;&gt; on her face, as she so often did.   Chemotherapy had just begun for<br/>
&gt;&gt; her recently diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, but the<br/>
&gt;&gt; infection too quickly claimed her body.  Hannah was a life long<br/>
&gt;&gt; learner for whom all experiences came with joy and love.  Survivors,<br/>
&gt;&gt; grateful for having loved her, are her mother, Diana (Lambert)<br/>
&gt;&gt; Jenner; her brother, Hayden Jenner; her grandparents, aunts, uncles,<br/>
&gt;&gt; cousins, and countless friends-who-should-be-family.  She is embraced<br/>
&gt;&gt; on the other side by her father, Mitch Jenner, and others who have<br/>
&gt;&gt; gone before her.  In lieu of flowers, the family requests outpourings<br/>
&gt;&gt; of love and tender regard to every child, and gratitude on the part<br/>
&gt;&gt; of parents of living children everywhere.<br/>
