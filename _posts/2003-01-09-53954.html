<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m reading _In the Arena,_ the autobiography of Charlton Heston, and a very<br/>
&gt; good book on the making of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  And various places<br/>
&gt; in there I find bits of trivia about what&#39;s coming in the third movie, when<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re talking about sets and special effects and miniatures.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s the book on the making of the Lord of the Rings called, please?  I&#39;m<br/>
interested in something like that.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m also interested in David&#39;s new book.  Sounds like I&#39;m going to be<br/>
investing more money in books again soon!  Oh, well, I could do worse. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I got mine from Barnes & Noble online.  They were so cheap I got six <br/>
altogether.  When I saw the first two, I ordered RIGHT THEN to get more, and <br/>
gave all but one away as gifts.<br/>

The price is up from the before-Christmas sale, but it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
You might find it cheaper or used at Amazon or in person if you have Barnes & <br/>
Noble.<br/>
