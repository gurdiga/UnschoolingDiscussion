<div id="ygrps-yiv-47871738">Ouch... my toes. I&#39;m ok though now.<br/>
fyi - I have not taken my dd&#39;s out of ps yet. I am using this post site as a<br/>
place to learn about the best ways to go about it and  to really understand what<br/>
it is to unschool. I have to still convince my dh of this as ps is still very<br/>
much a part of him and is hard to break him of (still cannot understand why,<br/>
when both he and I hated it so much). There are a few things we must get in<br/>
control of and feel comfortable with before we can take the full plunge. I have<br/>
begun attending the hs group that meets sort of near by monthly as well. I would<br/>
hope that I can still voice my opinions and questions to this group even though<br/>
I have not pulled them out yet.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand Nicki&#39;s pain. Understand too that a 6 yo will change their<br/>
minds quite often and what they like now, they may not tomorrow and visa versa.</div>

You have to make the decision to homeschool or public school.  <br/>
Everyone on this list &quot;made&quot; the decision to unschool, homeschool, <br/>
private/public school their children.  What you can do is let him <br/>
help you pick his curriculum.  But at six years old, you as the adult <br/>
should be making the schooling decision.  If he likes to play soccer, <br/>
sign him up for a soccer league.  Maybe the homeschool group has a <br/>
team.  Take him to homeschool functions.  He will make friends very <br/>
easy.  He is very young.  That is my opinion.  I probably stepped on <br/>
a toe or two and I apologize in advance.  <br/>

I disagree (but my toes are fine, thanks!  LOL)  <br/>
Unschooling is about children taking their own <br/>
decisions, and being supported by their parents.  We <br/>
make the decision to support this, but that&#39;s as far as <br/>
it goes.  YMobviouslyV!!  If he wants to go to school, <br/>
that&#39;s up to him.  What he gets from it will vary <br/>
depending on the attitude of everyone around him, which <br/>
is why I said that I thought facing the teacher down <br/>
with him present would be a useful experience *grin*  <br/>
Now one of mine said on the way to the home-ed fes we <br/>
were camping at that they wanted to go to school so we <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be going, but it hasn&#39;t been mentioned <br/>
since...  Don&#39;t know what exactly I&#39;d do about it if <br/>
she did decide to go, but that&#39;s not the point, it&#39;s <br/>
like Sandra said, it&#39;s about personal power, choice, <br/>
freedom.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I would NEVER do this. It is a great and valid suggestion so I truly<br/>
appreciate it. But our past history has taught me to be EXTREMELY cautious<br/>
at what I choose to expose my child/ren to under the premise that they will<br/>
learn something valuable. Unless I am very very sure that the outcome will<br/>
be to my liking (i.e the teacher will admit that what rules we have at our<br/>
house can not be dictated by her, that it&#39;s wrong, that she&#39;s sorry she<br/>
underestimated my child, etcetc), my experience is these types of situations<br/>
do more harm than good. Or at very least that the harm that can be done is<br/>
way too damaging to risk it.<br/>
<br/>
Case in point - two years ago after I separated from my ex and he was living<br/>
with his parents and watching my children during the day  my kids&#39; paternal<br/>
grandfather decided to get physically abusive on me. He did this in front of<br/>
my children. I was really shocked but not terribly hurt. I weighed my<br/>
options and decided that because my children SAW what happened I needed to<br/>
be proactive and take them with me to file a report against this man.<br/>
Previous years experience taught me (unfortunately) that assault and battery<br/>
was pretty easy to file - especially being a woman, a mother, and having<br/>
witnesses. I felt like it would be wise to show my children that at no costs<br/>
is it appropriate to tolerate physical abuse, that the police are there to<br/>
help keep us safe and protect us from people who try to harm us. I took them<br/>
because I felt it was important for them to see me being proactive about<br/>
this situation. In the end, the police LAUGHED me out of the station,<br/>
literally telling me that they had &quot;real&quot; crime to fight and that I couldn&#39;t<br/>
be a &quot;nutsy woman&quot; and expect them to do ANYTHING about this situation. They<br/>
said all of this in front of my children. I even said to them that I&#39;d hoped<br/>
they&#39;d be more responsive to the situation, if only for my children&#39;s<br/>
benefit and they told me something about my children  learning early that<br/>
there is real crime and then there are family squabbles. Oh - not to mention<br/>
that I was totally berated for breastfeeding my toddler there. Doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter that the law is on my side when I&#39;m IN the police station.<br/>
<br/>
I can not tell you how much this experience has tainted my belief that we<br/>
should drag our kids through these situations with us. I am way way way too<br/>
fearful that this teacher would accuse my child of being delayed, behind, a<br/>
poor reader, a poor student and accuse me and homeschooling of making that<br/>
happen. It has happened in the past and that is NOT something I want my<br/>
child to hear from the person he already listens to more than his own<br/>
mother! It would accomplish exactly the opposite and further alienate<br/>
himself from me and homeschooling as a concept.<br/>

OK, I get your point, it&#39;s not possible to know what <br/>
the outcome of this would be, but I still think that <br/>
having his mother spell out to said teacher why it&#39;s <br/>
important for your son to learn in his own sweet way <br/>
would get the message across to him more than telling <br/>
him directly, and the fact that you&#39;re willing to take <br/>
such a stand for him would be impressive.  But this is <br/>
my thoughts on it, so what you do is up to you.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a scary story, btw.  On the other hand, my <br/>
brother told me this story about my mum, who usually <br/>
doesn&#39;t say boo to a goose and could have &#39;anything for <br/>
an easy life&#39; tattoed on her face, she says it so <br/>
often.  Db has something about his teeth that cause <br/>
them to fur up when he drinks milk.  One day he was <br/>
going to the dentist (he was about 8yo I think) and the <br/>
dentist started having a go at him for not brushing.  <br/>
Mum stood up, for once, and told the guy that he had <br/>
brushed his teeth, she&#39;d watched him do it, and if he <br/>
was going to call them liars she&#39;d go somewhere else.  <br/>
Mum doesn&#39;t think she can stand up to authority <br/>
figures, but she can and I&#39;ve told her so (from this <br/>
and other things) so don&#39;t underestimate the power of a <br/>
child&#39;s memory!  You can use the situation to your <br/>
advantage, don&#39;t let it get confrontational, just say <br/>
your piece and leave.  Don&#39;t let &#39;em grind you down!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what your children really think about that <br/>
episode...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879287495">&lt;&lt;I wonder what your children really think about that<br/>
episode...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ugh Tracy, I am way too afraid to ask. Maybe in a few years.<br/>
<br/>
 This was the same day said grandfather kicked his son and my children out<br/>
of their house and onto the street with no car, no money and no where to go.<br/>
I finally got a collect call at work at the end of my work day - they&#39;d<br/>
spent all day on the streets. Oh - and they were escorted away by the<br/>
police. This was a big reason I wanted my children to witness me being<br/>
proactive with the police. They had just been forced to leave their father&#39;s<br/>
home by police escorts who KNEW they&#39;d be homeless and transportationless<br/>
and did not even offer my ex a chance to call me or make arrangements<br/>
otherwise. My kids were 18 months and 4.5 at the time. My kids have<br/>
witnessed way too much and been through way too much. I don&#39;t *think* they<br/>
sense my feelings about this because most of my decisions are based on these<br/>
reasons on more of a subconscious level. It&#39;s only when I start thinking and<br/>
writing about it that I realize how much of our past affects my parenting<br/>
decisions now and it makes more sense (if only to me! &lt;grin&gt;) why I have<br/>
made the decisions that I have and why I&#39;m so on the fence about things. I<br/>
used to have such conviction and now I&#39;ve seen the hurt that my convictions<br/>
have cast on my children and it&#39;s made me very cautious. I&#39;m FINALLY<br/>
starting to see the hurt that being so cautious has created (small stuff<br/>
compared to the rest but even small stuff is significant). And I&#39;m just<br/>
trying to wade through and find a middle ground. Cautiously optimistic, I<br/>
think it&#39;s called :)<br/>
<br/>
I really do try to stand up for them. In other realms this comes naturally.<br/>
It USED to come naturally in his classroom as well. I hope I am not coming<br/>
across as one of those pushover inactive parents. I guess I have finally<br/>
given up. I spent the better part of the school year making daily<br/>
appearances, phone calls, letters ....all with gently-worded clarifications<br/>
about my expectations, concerns, etc. I KNOW all the little tricks to being<br/>
assertive and making myself clear as day. I&#39;ve done it a million times<br/>
before in other situations. I&#39;ve counseled other Mothers on being assertive<br/>
with their families and doctors. It is second-nature to me. But I was<br/>
constantly belittled, pacified, etc. by this teacher.  I always left more<br/>
angry than I did when I came in. The VERY first day of school there was a<br/>
bullying incident and I jumped on it right away and was literally told by<br/>
this teacher that my child was perhaps reacting to how different he felt<br/>
because of his age (he was only 5 when he started first grade). That she was<br/>
not present during the episode but it seemed to stem from my own child&#39;s<br/>
frustration at not being able to keep up with the other kids - not actual<br/>
bullying from other kids. No attempts by me to firmly clarify that my child<br/>
relayed incidences of name-calling, restricted access on the playground, etc<br/>
made this woman reconsider her own stand. She&#39;d drawn a conclusion and stuck<br/>
to it. She does not want to hear what I have to say. From the start her<br/>
reaction to confrontation has been to clearly repeat her own stand until I<br/>
back down or give up. She simply does not want to hear what I have to say.<br/>
MANY times my son has been present during these conversations and I have<br/>
always tried to leave before it is too obvious that this woman cares nothing<br/>
for what I have to say. Finally I&#39;ve given up. Maybe that makes me a weak<br/>
mother or just plain a failure. Maybe I am dismissing  an opportunity to<br/>
possibly create a strong memory for him to take into adulthood. But I&#39;m<br/>
tired and I hate the system and I could care less what all the other<br/>
children learn or don&#39;t learn from this woman anymore. All I care about is<br/>
MY child and my rally for change has to start at home. At least for this<br/>
issue.<br/>

When something&#39;s painful and we had no choice sometimes we justify why it was <br/>
important and good for us.  And we cling to those justifications, because <br/>
otherwise we might get really angry at our parents or whoever did that to us, <br/>
or inflicted the thing on us, or made us continue.  <br/>

It might make you feel better to write a letter to that teacher with a copy <br/>
to the principal.  Summarize, starting with that first incident.  Tell how it <br/>
made you feel to be dismissed.  Try to keep the whole thing to one page.  We <br/>
could help you edit it.<br/>
<br/>
It will make a difference in her treatment of others in the future.  And it <br/>
will be an official &quot;mark&quot; on her at the school that you cared enough to <br/>
document your unhappiness, and that you took your child out.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher probably wouldn&#39;t respond, for legal reasons if nothing else.  <br/>
Maybe the principal would write a soothing something.<br/>

This is a GREAT idea! I think I will do it - even if I don&#39;t end up sending<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what the legal disadvantages are with putting in writing that I<br/>

month that was sent out to all parents. I just really do not want to be<br/>
&quot;listed&quot; unless/until I absolutely have to. So my only reservation about<br/>
sending a letter is that it would be forwarded to the school board as legal<br/>
proof of my intent. Maybe it&#39;s worth it and my fears are unjustified? I<br/>
don&#39;t know, it makes me a little nervous.<br/>
<br/>
This teacher has just accepted another teaching position within the district<br/>
at another Elem. school so I&#39;m not sure my copying others of importance<br/>
would have any bearing. My reason for including others would mostly be to<br/>
explain my choices and the effect of this behavior on some parents.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm, I&#39;ve been thinking on this one and I have to say for me and my <br/>
family I disagree with this. Unschooling is a life choice that my DH <br/>
and I have made for our family. Right now, at the ripe old age of <br/>
almost 5, my son doesn&#39;t have the decision to go to school placed in <br/>
his hands. If he did, it&#39;s possible that he might want to do it. Half <br/>
of his friends are going to go to kindergarten next year, the whole <br/>
culture supports, promotes, and expects it, it seems thrilling and <br/>
exciting to ride a big yellow bus and go sit with his friends. <br/>
Unfortunately, I think it would also be emotionally and mentally <br/>
damaging and so it&#39;s not an option we&#39;re giving him. I also wouldn&#39;t <br/>
let him walk into the middle of a busy highway to retrieve a quarter. <br/>
Honestly, that&#39;s sort of what it feels like to me - he&#39;d be reaching <br/>
for something small and shiny (the &quot;good&quot; experiences of school), and <br/>
get hit by a bus (the rest of the crap that comes with it). <br/>
Additionally, we&#39;d have to go through registering him with the system <br/>
(bleh), doing the whole immunization crap (double bleh) or filing a <br/>
religious exemption, exposing our whole family to the system. That&#39;s <br/>
not something we&#39;re going to be doing.<br/>
<br/>
Others may disagree, but I see Unschooling as a family decision and <br/>
one that (right now) my husband and I are making. As the kids get <br/>
older and have a bit more life experience and resilience to what <br/>
others have to say, they&#39;ll have the option to go to school. But at <br/>
this magical age of taking in the world, they don&#39;t. I also don&#39;t put <br/>
my son in daycare just because when we drive by a daycare center with <br/>
a pretty play structure he asks to go, FWIW.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;So my only reservation about<br/>
sending a letter is that it would be forwarded to the school board as legal<br/>

<br/>
OH no it wouldn&#39;t.  It would be put in a filing cabinet and hidden because <br/>
both the teacher and principal could be in trouble if the school board <br/>
thought they were wrong.  School boards are the boss.<br/>
<br/>
But if the principal had other complaints on that teacher and he/she chose to <br/>
send the letter on with a complaint, the board wouldn&#39;t see it as a letter of <br/>
intent or a letter about you or your child, but as a letter of complaint <br/>
against someone they hired and were paying.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This teacher has just accepted another teaching position within the district<br/>

WHY is she leaving?  Were they unhappy with her?  Or is it just closer to her <br/>

I totally agree with your entire post. We did the same thing when our oldest <br/>
was younger. (She is 17 now) We did not give her the option when she turned 5 <br/>
to go to school. Your posts reflect the way I felt at the time perfectly. <br/>
When my oldest turned 8 she said she wanted to go to school. She was <br/>
determined. Later she told me that her Aunt, who was in high school at the <br/>
time, told her she was missing tons of fun and of course all her friends were <br/>
there. We still did not let her go. Instead we let her join a karate club, <br/>
and she was also in dance and gymnastics. We pointed out to her that she <br/>
would not be able to do those extra activities if she was in school because <br/>
there would not be enough time. ( this was true as all activities were out of <br/>
town) She decided the activities were worth missing school for. Now that she <br/>
is 17 she says that she is glad that we never sent her to school and she can <br/>
talk to her friends and see how much they dislike it. She is glad that we did <br/>

<br/>
I can relate to this, I go through phases of feeling <br/>
this way with my mum sometimes!  You have tried, <br/>
obviously, and reached the limit of your resources with <br/>
this woman.  I guess I&#39;d be saying to my son (on a good <br/>
day, this is!!  *grin*) &#39;I don&#39;t like it, I don&#39;t like <br/>
the way this teacher behaves, but I&#39;m too tired of <br/>
fighting her attitudes to go any further with this.  If <br/>
you want to do &#39;x&#39; at home, that&#39;s fine by me, and what <br/>
you want is much more important to me than anything <br/>
this teacher wants.&#39;  But that would be on a good day...<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re doing the best you can, and that&#39;s all <br/>
any of us can do.  I&#39;m sorry if this thread has brought <br/>
up painful memories for you, though sometimes they can <br/>
help in clarifying why we behave the way we do now, as <br/>
you say.  You&#39;re certainly not a failure!<br/>
<br/>
Did you mention that she won&#39;t be teaching your son <br/>
next year?  Take the summer off, then if your son still <br/>
wants to be in school, see what the new teacher&#39;s like, <br/>
and use all those skills you have in store &#39;from <br/>
scratch.&#39;  I agree with Sandra that it&#39;s not likely to <br/>
be beneficial if you&#39;re fighting about home-ed to start <br/>
with...<br/>
<br/>
How much longer do you have to put up with this woman?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368558235">I totally agree with your entire post. We did the same <br/>
thing when our oldest <br/>
was younger. (She is 17 now) We did not give her the <br/>
option when she turned 5 <br/>
to go to school. Your posts reflect the way I felt at <br/>
the time perfectly. <br/>
When my oldest turned 8 she said she wanted to go to <br/>
school. She was <br/>
determined. Later she told me that her Aunt, who was in <br/>
high school at the <br/>
time, told her she was missing tons of fun and of <br/>
course all her friends were <br/>
there. We still did not let her go. Instead we let her <br/>
join a karate club, <br/>
and she was also in dance and gymnastics. We pointed <br/>
out to her that she <br/>
would not be able to do those extra activities if she <br/>
was in school because <br/>
there would not be enough time. ( this was true as all <br/>
activities were out of <br/>
town) She decided the activities were worth missing <br/>
school for. Now that she <br/>
is 17 she says that she is glad that we never sent her <br/>
to school and she can <br/>
talk to her friends and see how much they dislike it. <br/>
She is glad that we did <br/>
not give in to her request but stood by our beliefs <br/>
that public school is not <br/>
an option for us. <br/>
Our other three children never wanted to go to school. <br/>

Well, maybe I didn&#39;t clarify myself in my post.  I think that if a <br/>
child says he wants to go to school, he shouldn&#39;t &#39;just go&#39; without a <br/>
lot of discussion, about what school is and does and what people <br/>
do there, and why they want to go and what they think they&#39;ll get <br/>
out of it.  If it&#39;s possible to find a compromise between what the <br/>
child wants (the activities or time with other children, or the ride <br/>
on the bus...) and what the parent wants, ie the freedom as a <br/>
family to come and go and do stuff together, then fair enough, if <br/>
the child, once all the pros and cons have been thoroughly (and for <br/>
something like this, I mean thoroughly) explored still wants to <br/>
experience school, then there could be ways (like flexi-schooling, <br/>
for one) to facilitate this without impingeing too much on the rest <br/>
of the family&#39;s freedom.  Organising ways for the child (depending <br/>
on age) to get himself up (pre-made breakfast? alarm-clock? <br/>
clothes sorted in advance?) without disturbing one or all family <br/>
members isn&#39;t impossible, and transportation to and from school <br/>
may not be difficult to sort out in a similar fashion.  The idea that <br/>
once a child&#39;s enrolled in a school they can&#39;t decide when they do <br/>
and don&#39;t go has already been disproved by Nicki&#39;s son, &#39;being ill&#39; <br/>
when he just doesn&#39;t want to go, though honestly saying &#39;I don&#39;t <br/>
want to go today&#39; would be preferable to me!  I understand that <br/>
the school board might not like it much, but they might be <br/>
amenable to a fixed-day part-time arrangement...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not actually arguing for school, btw, just that the child can <br/>
experience it without placing as much restriction on family-life as <br/>
most folk assume.  And that the child can make such a decision, <br/>
given all the info that the parents can offer and anyone else he <br/>
might ask.<br/>
<br/>
As a counterpoint, how many people take their children to <br/>
activities which are run in ways they (the parents) disagree with?  <br/>
Would they stop the child from going?  I have permission to <br/>
forward this from the author, she sent it to a UK home-ed list <br/>
today:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;X adores swimming club, it&#39;s definitely the thing he looks forward <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to most. At his stage, he trains with the club 3.25 hours per week. <br/>
The swimming when it hurts bit doesn&#39;t happen often, to be fair, <br/>
only during races or in T10&#39;s (an assessment where they are <br/>
recorded on how far they can swim in a continous 10 minute swim, <br/>
and there&#39;s a coach at each end nagging them if they&#39;re too tired to <br/>
tumble-turn at the ends!). I think if you&#39;re a certain sort of person, <br/>
there&#39;s a great satisfaction in pushing yourself to do well in spite of <br/>
discomfort, as well as the feel-good factor of endorphins!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you meet a fair proportion of pushy parents at a <br/>
competetive swimming club :0( - mostly of slightly older children <br/>
who are already swimming in national or regional races. People <br/>
who say that sometimes their child doesn&#39;t want to come, is too <br/>
tired to train, but mum/dad insist that it has to be done. Other <br/>
parents who are angry if their child does poorly in a race and <br/>
insists on talking them through it stroke by stroke telling them <br/>
where they went wrong. Parents living out their own thwarted <br/>
ambitions through their children.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, the emphasis is too much on speed and competition even in <br/>
the D (development) squads that C is in. They get timed at each <br/>
training session on one stoke at one distance, and this all gets <br/>
recorded and a graph printed monthly showing how each child&#39;s <br/>
times are coming down.  Unfortunately, at this stage this does very <br/>
little for good stroke development, and you see children sacrificing <br/>
everything they have been taught about good strokework in their <br/>
quest to beat the child in the next lane. Also, the slower children <br/>
are not popular amongst the squad members, generally.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This mother goes on to say that while he&#39;s interested and enjoying <br/>
it, she&#39;ll be taking him.  I feel similarly about a class my children go <br/>
to, there are aspects I don&#39;t like but they enjoy it and so they go.<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s the difference between this and school, apart from the <br/>
amount of time involved??  <br/>
