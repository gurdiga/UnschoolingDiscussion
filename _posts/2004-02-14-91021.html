<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351905998">Well, I&#39;ve already posted that we&#39;ve just been having a great day today. Megan was busy drawing all over her leg with a washable marker after her nap. Instead of freaking out that now she was in need of a bath, I stripped her to her diaper and let her draw all over herself. I even drew on her...so did Sarah. She ended up with a flower on her shoulder and mostly hearts all over drawn by us and lines from herself. Logan got a heart on one shoulder and a smilie on another; and Sarah a heart on one shoulder and a butterfly on the other. <br/>
 <br/>
I think they had a great time doing something totally unexpected and off-the-wall that would normally have been met with &quot;Don&#39;t do that!&quot; We all laughed and then they all went into the tub happily. <br/>
 <br/>
When I asked what they wanted for dinner...they said &quot;Cake!&quot; so..guess what is baking?! <br/>
 <br/>
Somehow that&#39;s a fitting end to the day we&#39;ve had today.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I found that the Crayola Dry Erase markers washed off even better then the washable ones. A few minutes in a tub and the ink would be gone. No scrubbing at all. A tip from a mom who&#39;s arrived at the In-Laws with a two year old painted in full jungle camoflage.<br/>

You know, that sounds kind of fun!  I&#39;m sure that my DD would LOVE <br/>
to do that though we&#39;ll have to wait until DH leaves for work....he <br/>
might not think it&#39;s as fun as we do.  Shhhhhhh  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266918326">Jayn frequently draws all over herself with a variety of markers, or her<br/>
paints. She has been doing so for about 2 years. Some colors seem more<br/>
indelible than others on her skin, but everything fades eventually. I never<br/>
even considered preventing her from doing so, as she has so much fun and a<br/>
long story about each illustration.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a college teacher I use white board markers a lot. Writing up on the <br/>
board in front of a class it is impossible not to get some on my arm <br/>
and hand. I developed a sensitivity to these markers and it was BAD - <br/>
had a terrible rash that spread from my arms to my face and it was <br/>
really hard to get rid of. I finally, after weeks, got rid of it, then <br/>
we wanted to check and make sure it was the markers, so I just put a <br/>
dab on the inside of my arm and got a big red welt there which spread <br/>
as a rash along the inside of my arm.<br/>
<br/>
Just so you&#39;ll be suspicious of markers IF your children come down with <br/>
a mysterious rash.<br/>
<br/>
My kids used markers all over themselves - Roya still does it at 19 (so <br/>
don&#39;t hold out hope for them growing out of it &lt;G&gt;) - never had a <br/>
problem. But you may want to avoid the white board markers - EXPO was <br/>
the brand that I was using.<br/>

My kids liked the scented markers - but even those drive me crazy.  This from a person who&#39;s allergic to most perfumes and fragrances.<br/>
