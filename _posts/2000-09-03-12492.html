Sheesh is right. I think this should go beyond the suggesting<br/>
stage....arrange a sleep-over when at least two of your children have loose<br/>
teeth, preferably two teeth each. Don&#39;t let them come home without cash. So,<br/>
when you were little, did the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; leave _you_ large amounts of<br/>
money, or is this one of those &quot;We couldn&#39;t do for you, but we&#39;ll do for the<br/>
grandchildren&quot; situations?</div>

<br/>
Actually, I think this is my dad&#39;s idea of humor!! (Sigh!) The worst part<br/>
is, he probably WOULD give them $5 a tooth. They all have areally intense<br/>
mutual admiration party going on that shows no signs of ending. It&#39;s kinda<br/>
fun watching my ex-boxer dad melt into a big gooey puddle for his<br/>
grandkids!!<br/>
<br/>
And no, he would no more have given us folding money for tooth loss than he<br/>
would have tried to fly to heaven on his own two wings!! $.25 was the norm.<br/>
&#39;Course, I&#39;m 48 now and a quarter DID go a lot farther in the days when a<br/>
candy bar cost a nickel!! (And dinosaurs roamed the earth!!)<br/>

Shirley, it is gratifying, isn&#39;t it? My own dad is &quot;Papa&quot; to all the kidlets<br/>
and is known for his unbridled generosity. Drives me nuts....I say, &quot;Just<br/>
one&quot; and he says &quot;Oh, they can all have one....I&#39;ll pay for it&quot;. (Dad,<br/>
you&#39;re missing the point, here....)  But there&#39;s nothing like watching a<br/>
full-grown man turn to liquid jello holding a little one.  I said that aloud<br/>
when my husband was holding our youngest daughter, and she piped up, &quot;Mmmmm.<br/>
Jell-oo!&quot;<br/>
