 ELECTION 2000 <br/>
Candidates weigh in <br/>
on home schooling <br/>
DNC attacks Bush for being <br/>
&#39;lenient&#39; with home schoolers <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Distancing his candidate from the DNC&#39;s incendiary rhetoric against home <br/>
schooling, Dagoberto Vega, spokesman for the Gore-Lieberman campaign said <br/>
yesterday that &quot;Al Gore has always felt that parents are their children&#39;s <br/>
most important teachers. He also believes the federal government should not <br/>
impair a parent&#39;s decision to school their children at home. However, Gore <br/>
feels that the federal role in education should focus on ensuring that every <br/>
child in America&#39;s public schools is educated at the highest level.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The DNC statement, and that of Gore&#39;s spokesman come at a time when home <br/>
schoolers around the country are being faced with an increasing number of <br/>
truancy accusations, and parents find themselves becoming legal experts on <br/>
their right to educate children at home without government interference. <br/>
<br/>
Vega stressed Gore&#39;s commitment to the government&#39;s school system. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Managing a strong, successful public school system reflects upon our <br/>
commitment to all children,&quot; Vega said. &quot;It is also a key factor in the <br/>
continued economic success of our nation. That&#39;s why Al Gore believes that we <br/>
have a responsibility to our future to continue improving America&#39;s public <br/>
schools.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Vega also noted that the vice president&#39;s position on home schooling &quot;stays <br/>
the same&quot; in the face of ideological opposition on the part, not only of the <br/>
Democratic National Committee, but especially the powerful National Education <br/>
Association. <br/>

In a less than perfect world, I am OK with Mr. Gore remaining focussed on the <br/>
&quot;federal&quot; role being to improve public school and not to &quot;impair&quot; <br/>

The bottom line is that it is individual states that have the final say on<br/>
hsing laws, not the federal government. That is why each state has different<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree Al Gore (or anyone else voted into presidency) will have bigger fish <br/>
to fry.  Unfortunately, that is exactly the problem.   No matter who is voted <br/>
in, he won&#39;t be the one making these decisions.  The president simply does <br/>
not have that power...not the individual, at least.  Have to look at the <br/>
bigger picture, which includes the political party and who the candidate <br/>
ultimately answers/responds to; that could be his wife, his religion, his <br/>
parents, his kids, someone he opposes, special interest groups, who hosts the <br/>
biggest/most fun party, his political party.  Whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Because he has bigger fish to fry, he won&#39;t have time to devote to this <br/>
particular issue one way or the other.  That lack of time and attention will <br/>
have a bigger impact than any one man&#39;s personal opinion.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s how it stands now...sort of.  Problem is that the local schools get so <br/>
much funding &#39;back&#39; from the Feds that the Feds actually pull a lot of <br/>
strings.  Just look at what happened with Goals 2000.  Essentially, if the <br/>
school district wanted the $$$ they came up with a program that met the Feds <br/>
requirement.  Viola!  Schools across the land operating in the same cookie <br/>
cutter style.  Very small step from there to greater and greater Fed <br/>
&#39;influence&#39; and eventual control.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion, FWIW, <br/>

 Nance &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     Thanks for sharing this, Nance.  When I first came to have any strong <br/>
beliefs about politics (after a few somewhat apathetic years as a struggling <br/>
young single mother), I felt much more alligned with Democratic thought on <br/>
most issues.  However, as time went by, I found that there were a couple of <br/>
big issues that I didn&#39;t agree with them on, homeschooling being a major one. <br/>
 I feel that unschooling is a reflection of my liberalism because I want my <br/>
kids to learn freely and not be brutalized by a regimented, often harsh style <br/>
of &quot;educating.&quot;  <br/>
     One thing I hate about the way the two party system has become is that <br/>
there doesn&#39;t seem to be a point by point consideration of each issue by <br/>
average citizens or at least their views can&#39;t be accurately reflected <br/>
because we have to choose between two sweeping platforms.  I have a friend <br/>
who is deeply bothered by legal abortion and so tends to vote for Republicans <br/>
yet she strongly believes in a higher minimum wage, unions, worker safety <br/>
laws, and other Democrat takes on things.  Whether someone agrees with her <br/>
feelings on abortion or not, my point is that these issues should be <br/>
considered one by one.<br/>
     I resent having to choose in this way.  Just because a person believes <br/>
in children being able to learn at home (or whatever other issue), does not <br/>
mean she believes in no or low minimum wage laws, getting rid of safety <br/>
regulations for the meat or other industries, or not having basic health care <br/>
for all people, for example.<br/>
     I am generally a supporter of unions because in certain situations, they <br/>
seem to be the only way a person can get a living wage and some job <br/>
protection.  But the NEA angers me because I think they are dishonest in <br/>
their attack on homeschooling.  Their primary motive seems to be job security <br/>
and not what is good for the homeschooled kids.  I would feel much better <br/>
about them if they would stick to issues directly concerning their own pay <br/>
and working situation.<br/>
     I think these are some reasons that people end up not voting.  They get <br/>
disgusted with the process and feel that neither of the big two (and maybe <br/>
none of the smaller parties, either) really represent their views on the <br/>
issues important to them.  I wonder if I will finally get to that point, too.<br/>

I hope not, Lucy.  But I know exactly how you feel.  I was almost there <br/>
myself.  Coudn&#39;t bring myself to vote for Mr. Bush based on this single <br/>
issue.  But I hadn&#39;t seen anything reassuring from Mr. Gore&#39;s camp on hsing <br/>
either. Until this article.  Which is not as pro-hs as I would like but is a <br/>
long way from the NEA&#39;s position.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>
