<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755895559">I&#39;d love some insight on how to handle this.  My dd8 wants to get <br/>
out and do as much as possible because she is so bored at home.  My <br/>
ds9 prefers staying home.  We do not have anyone nearby that can <br/>
hang out with my son.  My closest relative is 1 hour away and our <br/>
homeschool friends are too busy homeschooling and doing their own <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
I help my son bring things to do, meaning I remind him that we <br/>
should grab some things to take with us like his gameboy and some <br/>
books.  He complains about wanting to be at home though.  If we stay <br/>
home too much, my daughter cries because she is bored.  Yes, I&#39;ve <br/>
tried to help them find things they find interesting but my daughter <br/>
mostly complains about not having anyone to play with.  My DH and I <br/>
are thinking about joining the YMCA to find some classes for my <br/>
daughter, but the facility is just too far to drop her off.  She <br/>
also wants to start a co-op with other girls for American Girl <br/>
stuff.  My son just hangs his head down and groans because when he <br/>
hears her planning these things, he feels he&#39;ll have no choice but <br/>
to tag along.  <br/>
<br/>
How can I meet their needs without making the other one feel <br/>
miserable?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re doing pretty well - trying to balance their needs.<br/>
Remember, things will change - this might not be forever. Your son  <br/>
might make a special friend at some of your daughter&#39;s activities,  <br/>
and want to go, for example.  So - hold out hope that their desires  <br/>
might line up better, in the future.<br/>
<br/>
But, in the meantime, you&#39;ll have to be as creative as you can be and  <br/>
they&#39;ll grow up knowing that conflict is handled by trying really  <br/>
hard to find a way to meet each person&#39;s needs and by compromising  <br/>
when you can&#39;t figure out how to do that. This is one of the  <br/>
benefits, to the children, of having siblings, by the way, so even  <br/>
when it is so hard for you, remember that the skills they are  <br/>
learning (through your modeling and their own attempts to deal with  <br/>
conflict) are going to be useful to them throughout their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Some ideas - be MORE creative about what you take along for your son:<br/>
<br/>
Have a special decorated box - maybe a large Rubbermaid container -  <br/>
for &quot;take out&quot; stuff. He can put things in there - even buy special  <br/>
things that he might see in a store - for his &quot;take out&quot; box. YOU can  <br/>
put surprises in there, too. Keep it in the car, so it isn&#39;t always  <br/>
just sitting around available, to keep it more special. One of those  <br/>
rolling carts would be perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Invite his friend to go along to play while your daughter is involved  <br/>
in activities.<br/>
<br/>
Take them to parks a lot. Have a blanket - same blanket every time,  <br/>
so it feels like home - for him to have has his own space at the  <br/>
park. He puts his &quot;take-out box&quot; on the blanket and he &quot;owns&quot; that  <br/>
space. Your daughter can play with other kids - take her friends  <br/>
along - while YOU spend time with him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you can come up with a lot of other options.<br/>
<br/>
Last - is it possible that when you&#39;re out of the house, he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
get your full attention? Is it possible that when you go to  <br/>
activities, for example, that you&#39;re preoccupied with talking to the  <br/>
other adults and not focusing on him? He might be wanting to stay  <br/>
home because he doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with the level of separation  <br/>
he feels from you when you are involved with other people. Making a  <br/>
lot more concerted effort to remain &quot;connected&quot; with him, while  <br/>
you&#39;re out, might be very helpful. Looking him in the eyes a lot,  <br/>
patting or touching him, checking in with him more frequently, and  <br/>
spending time while you are out playing with him, not half-playing  <br/>
while talking to other moms &lt;g&gt;, might help him be more comfortable  <br/>
out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are all the ways to help your daughter feel more  <br/>
comfortable staying home....make home more exciting, invite people  <br/>
over more, do more stuff with her at home, etc.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll probably need to do a combination of lots of things.<br/>

I was reading your post with interest because we tend to have this issue <br/>

I thought the same thing too.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s harder on the &quot;homebody&quot; because he can&#39;t be *home* when <br/>
he&#39;s gone.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the &quot;social butterfly&quot; *could* be just as social at <br/>
home. Post several different places about an American Girls Evening or <br/>
Tea or Brunch. Monthly would be good. It would keep her busy planning <br/>
the theme, making invites, decorating, pulling together a themed menu, <br/>
etc. There may not be as many the first time or two, but I bet it could <br/>
get *really* big after word-of-mouth! Post notices at toy/doll stores. <br/>
libraries, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If your house becomes the party house, everyone&#39;s satisfied---and your <br/>
house gets cleaned to boot! &lt;g&gt; (Well, mine would! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>

Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t the panacea I was hoping it would be. Is <br/>
anything? ;)<br/>
<br/>
Sam had serious issues with other people being in *his* space--pretty <br/>
much worse than going out. He couldn&#39;t even be &quot;home&quot; at home because of <br/>
the other people there.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I found out pretty quickly that other people doing the same thing <br/>
my kids did wasn&#39;t nearly so cool, and those who weren&#39;t used to <br/>
unschooling became downright wild and disrespectful of property at times.<br/>
<br/>
Even on a small scale having people in didn&#39;t work out for us, though <br/>
I&#39;m not sorry I gave it a shot! Playdates don&#39;t tend to be much more <br/>
successful, for my introvert, though they&#39;re getting a little bit <br/>
better. I think it&#39;s helped that we gave it a good long rest.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had to keep trying different things and retrying them as the kids <br/>
get a bit older. No matter how we slice it, though, it&#39;s hard to <br/>
accommodate really divergent personalities sometimes. I like what Pam <br/>
said about it being more about the process and the trying in the long <br/>
run than the actual successes. At least, that&#39;s what I hold onto. ;) <br/>
I&#39;ve found that focusing on the process and letting go of more <br/>
outcome-based thinking in myself helps tremendously, as does seeing the <br/>
situation as more long-term than short term, both in how each child&#39;s <br/>
needs really are being met over time and in how the process of <br/>
problem-solving becomes an important life skill.<br/>

I have four children ages 14 down to 2, I&#39;ve been there.<br/>
I would ask your son what he wants to do. Go to places (if he wants to)that  <br/>
there are kids his age or similar interests. If he meets someone bonus if not  <br/>
there is always a new place or a different day.<br/>
It&#39;s easy to have a go go child and have one who&#39;s needs/wants don&#39;t seem  to <br/>
be getting met.<br/>
If he wants to stay home right now I would honor that as much as possible. <br/>
My oldest went through that for a bit so i offered personal time for him in  <br/>
the evening when my DH could take the other three.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, they do sound like excuses.  I thought the same thing when I <br/>
posted.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling over 4 years now.  Of all the <br/>
acquaintances we&#39;ve come across, we&#39;ve only become &#39;friends&#39; with <br/>
two families.  They have been our regular play-dates.  Between our <br/>
three families, we have 4 boys and 2 girls.  Both families <br/>
homeschool in a traditional manner, one schools in the mornings and <br/>
the other schools mostly in the afternoons.  It makes getting <br/>
together challenging, but we&#39;ve been doing pretty good so far.  <br/>
They&#39;ve now formed a First Lego League team that meets 3 days per <br/>
week, Tuesday through Thursday.  Jeffrey went to the first few <br/>
meetings but decided against joining the team.  We were basically <br/>
told they&#39;d be so busy with the Lego stuff that they couldn&#39;t <br/>
schedule any park days or play-dates until the end of October.  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t invite &#39;strangers&#39; to our home because it makes my son <br/>
uncomfortable.  If he doesn&#39;t know the person, he feels anxious <br/>
about them being in his room and touching his things.  Also, Jeffrey <br/>
doesn&#39;t like to play outside much (which makes park days kind of <br/>
weird since we can never stay longer than about 90 minutes). <br/>
<br/>
A biggie around here is homeschool classes.  We tried many because <br/>
we liked the idea of being with other homeschoolers but we don&#39;t <br/>
like the formal structure of the classes.  Even the fun enrichment <br/>
classes didn&#39;t excite my children.  Besides, we&#39;ve never met <br/>
a &#39;friend&#39; in any class.  The kids rush in, do their class, then <br/>
rush out again either to another class or leaving the building.  I <br/>
don&#39;t see how other homeschoolers call it socialization.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Co-ops don&#39;t seem to be popular because they involve work.  Every <br/>
time I&#39;ve tried getting something together, I get many interested <br/>
families who want to drop their children off so they either have <br/>
some alone time or time with younger children.  I don&#39;t want to run <br/>
a babysitting service.  People would rather pay for classes because <br/>
they don&#39;t have to be involved.  The excuse I&#39;ve heard most often is <br/>
that they are homeschoolers who are with their children all the time <br/>
and they use homeschool classes and extracurricular activities as a <br/>
break.  That just doesn&#39;t fit our lifestyle.  :)<br/>
<br/>
One helpful thing is that my DH works from home on Mondays now.  I <br/>
want to try doing either Girl Scouts or an American girl thing on <br/>
Mondays since Jeffrey can stay home with Dad.<br/>
<br/>
So, no, I&#39;m really not using excuses.  I just keep running into <br/>
obstacles.  It&#39;s hard to get out and meet people when my son has <br/>
such a hard time with new things.  Even going to a new store or <br/>
restaurant brings on a huge amount of anxiety for him.  I wish I <br/>
lived closer to my mom.  Then he could stay with her while Allison <br/>
and I run around town.  :)<br/>

Maybe you could reframe this in your head.  Having one or two girls<br/>
come to your house and do some activity with your daughter (an<br/>
activity that lets your son be peaceful in some other part of the<br/>
house) is as much them doing a favor for your family as it is you<br/>

Yes.<br/>
And instead of thinking of it as a long-term thing (whether six  <br/>
weeks, all summer, a year or forever), invite them once with an  <br/>
option for a second.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted girls to come over a few years back so we had a few My  <br/>
Little Pony play sessions.  There were eventually three or four, but  <br/>
without saying &quot;We will do this every Wednesday,&quot; we scheduled one,  <br/>
and then another...<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little I found that inviting just one other kid  <br/>
over could change the dynamics in some wonderful ways.  And the  <br/>
parents of onlies appreciated having a place where their kids could  <br/>
play.  I couldn&#39;t just leave them alone for a long time, though—I had  <br/>
to be available to entertain or comfort those who weren&#39;t playing  <br/>
with the guest at one point or another, when that happened.   <br/>
Sometimes it did, and sometimes it didn&#39;t.  One repeating pattern  <br/>
with various single boys was that the visitor would play with Kirby  <br/>
inside for a while and then with Marty outside for a while.  Kirby  <br/>
was better for action figures and games, and Marty was good for  <br/>
roller blades and bikes.  Even now, if one of Kirby&#39;s friends wants  <br/>
to go ice skating or swimming, Marty will go with them, but Kirby won&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012805036">I read through all the posts, though I might have missed this  suggestion.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re going someplace for just, say, and hour or so, couldn&#39;t your son  <br/>
just stay home?  9 years old, I think, depending on the maturity of the  kid, <br/>
is old enough to be home for an hour or so.  I wouldn&#39;t do it all the  time, <br/>
because then he&#39;d be missing out on your attention, but maybe once a  week?<br/>
 <br/>
With cell phones, and if you&#39;re not going far, this is much safer than it  <br/>
used to be.  If you&#39;re really feeling uncomfortable about it, maybe set it  up <br/>
with an elderly neighbor that if he had a problem or needed help, he could go  <br/>
to their house.  <br/>
 <br/>
I was babysitting at age 10, for other kids in my neighborhood.  Sure,  my <br/>
mom was right down the street, but you would just be a phone call away.   I hate <br/>
to always bring this up, but I used to work for a PD in CA, in the  juvenile <br/>
section, and there was no mandated law as to how old a child had to be  to <br/>
stay home.  The officers/detectives said it completely depends on how  <br/>
responsible the child was. (Obviously they&#39;re not talking about a 6 year old  staying <br/>
home and babysitting a 2 and a 4 year old...)  They said there&#39;s 8  year olds <br/>
that might even do better at home than some 15 year olds...it just  depends on <br/>
the child.  <br/>
 <br/>
We have 2 boys that often will stay home when we have to go to town (we  live <br/>
in the country.)  They love it!  They get to watch what THEY want  on TV, or <br/>
play video games uninterrupted by siblings, etc.  I usually put  out some <br/>
munchies for them too.  They are a LITTLE older (12 and 14) but  they came to us <br/>
through foster care, and their maturity level is probably that  of a 10 and 12 <br/>
year old.  They do great, clean up their messes when I&#39;m  gone, they take <br/>
great phone messages, and they just like the feeling of being  &quot;older.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
But other kids will want to play in it.<br/>
<br/>
Our criteria for taking things to a park were &quot;will it be something  <br/>
to fight over?&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s a criteria for most things in my life. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s an argument for saying things worth fighting over are  <br/>
good things, but if the goal is to create peace in a certain  <br/>
situation, it&#39;s a good consideration.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe taking two little tents, one for privacy and one for sharing,  <br/>
is a possibility.   They&#39;re cheap on sale sometimes; $15 or $25 off  <br/>
season.<br/>

Oh!  I was thinking a real dome tent, like two people can sleep in.   <br/>
Those are probably less expensive than tents designed specifically  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-925784340">Well, yeah, it&#39;s like an adult one but smaller.  Actually, I think it&#39;s called a junior dome tent.  I have one, as I&#39;m a short adult, and it was only $12 or so.  It&#39;s about 5&#39;3&quot; diameter.  But your point stands:  other kids would want to play in it.  So maybe that&#39;d be more fun for the super-social than the avoiding-social.  :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991478646">The kid&#39;s age that is.<br/>
<br/>
This week I realized that my role as &quot;parent who unschools&quot; is very<br/>
different from a few years ago.<br/>
<br/>
This light bulb happened as my 14 yo daughter was planning to make deviled<br/>
eggs for 4th of July. I&#39;ve never made them before. She asked me to go to the<br/>
store to get some olives. I said sure, and was there anything else in the<br/>
recipe that we might not have. She said she was doing it from her head, had<br/>
no recipe, and she was pretty sure. I asked if she would like me to print<br/>
out a recipe from the internet to make sure, and she said no, she was really<br/>
sure. So I trusted and got just the olives and a few things others wanted.<br/>
But I hate to say that it was really HARD not to look up a recipe to make<br/>
sure. I didn&#39;t want to go to the store a 2nd time, and I wanted her to have<br/>
success with her eggs.<br/>
<br/>
In the not-too-distant past, if my child had an interest in cooking<br/>
something I would jump on the internet, pull out the cookbooks, etc. show<br/>
them things that I thought would help/interest them. I would be a superior<br/>
resource for them.<br/>
<br/>
I realized that my older three children (ages 17, 16 and 14) have needed<br/>
something different than that over the last few years. They certainly still<br/>
need and want me to be there and listen and support them, but more often<br/>
THEY want to be the resource...the one who checks out what is going on<br/>
locally, cruises the internet, gains the information. Sometimes they prefer<br/>
that I don&#39;t even know too much about it...they want to be the resource.<br/>
<br/>
Watching them step into roles of more responsibility and maturity is such a<br/>
joy and privilege. They are becoming more adult than child. Maybe it seems<br/>
like an obvious thing, but as it has and is happening here, it just hit home<br/>
the difference in my role as a parent with them.<br/>
<br/>
It takes great cognizance sometimes to follow the shifting role that our<br/>
kids need us to be. But SO worth it!<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to see the required &quot;rebelliousness&quot; of teenhood, btw. :oP<br/>
(that&#39;s me sticking my tongue out at society).<br/>
<br/>
And the deviled eggs were DELICIOUS!!!<br/>

<br/>
Kirby&#39;s first deviled eggs were similarly scary for me, and had a  <br/>
result that made me really feel anxious and wrong.  Way too much  <br/>
emotion for deviled eggs, THAT&#39;s for sure!<br/>
<br/>
Everything was fine, but when he got them arranged on the platter, he  <br/>
knew he had seen them with red stuff sprinkled on, but didn&#39;t ask (I  <br/>
think we had left the house for a while, the adults) WHAT.  Didn&#39;t  <br/>
look it up.  Used cayenne pepper.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know that&#39;s wrong.  It&#39;s not right.  It&#39;s not paprika.  Paprika  <br/>
is the red stuff on deviled eggs.  That&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, it was good.  It was weird (for me), but it tasted fine!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-shifting with age... The kid&#39;s age that is.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think even if kids could stay the same age, our view of the  <br/>
situation would shift with our own age.  Interestingly (and  <br/>
confusingly), we both get older at the very same rate of speed�not  <br/>
the same growth curve, because my kids&#39; ages have doubled  over and  <br/>
over and mine hasn&#39;t (not in their lifetimes, not yet).<br/>
<br/>
All in all, this made me want deviled eggs.  And I&#39;m visiting a  <br/>
friend who broke her ankle dancing (Ramona King, in a storytelling  <br/>
and African drumming/dance show at the zoo, for those who know her or  <br/>
that show), and I think she probably NEEDS deviled eggs.  How could  <br/>
she not?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the idea (and for the good story, too).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105501713">We were there to enjoy Kirby&#39;s deviled-egg-making! The cayenne pepper  <br/>
was really GOOD on them - much better than colored dust (paprika -  <br/>
which tastes a little like dirt, to me, anyway). He got rave reviews  <br/>
and came back for an encore - made them again!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra was bothered by the use of cayenne pepper and not paprika -  <br/>
that was clear. But it was very interesting to me to see how Kirby  <br/>
was calm and happy anyway - lots of kids would have felt like they&#39;d  <br/>
totally blown the whole thing if mom came in late and told them the  <br/>
red stuff was supposed to have been paprika. Not Kirby. Not anybody  <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, I&#39;m about to go put a pot of eggs on to boil AND we will  <br/>
probably put cayenne pepper on at least half of them - Kirby-style!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330048090">-=-OOOooooops! So sorry I was trying to forward this to my DIL who is  <br/>
trying to &quot;get&quot;unschooling!<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
I thought of another one.  Or rather another one happened yesterday.<br/>
Kirby was leaving for a job interview and I walked him out.  He&#39;s  <br/>
more charismatic than I am and does really well in first-impression  <br/>
situations so I didn&#39;t say a word about the regular interview  <br/>
coaching stuff.  What I did tell him is that even if he doesn&#39;t get  <br/>
this position, that the interview still serves a good purpose.   <br/>
Sometimes they know who they&#39;re going to hire and are interviewing as  <br/>
a formality or technicality, but they still get to know him better  <br/>
and he&#39;ll be a step ahead the next time.<br/>
<br/>
I might not have thought to say that but I used to work where we were  <br/>
required to interview three people to promote.  Even if it was an  <br/>
inside promotion, we had to interview two other applicants, because  <br/>
it was a state job (at the records office at the university, where I  <br/>
worked for a year and a  half after I stopped teaching).   Sometimes  <br/>
we filled the lower spot with one of those interviewed.  That&#39;s kind  <br/>
of a bummer, to apply for one job and be offered a lower one, and  <br/>
sometimes they were interested and sometimes they weren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That kind of comes under conversation, though, so I guess it&#39;s not a  <br/>
separate kind of mom-duty. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
