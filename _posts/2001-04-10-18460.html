&lt;&lt; I didn&#39;t realize you were in Yorkshire. We have a friend from<br/>
there who is a dear soul, but we can hardly understand a word he says when<br/>
he visits &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When we were in Yorkshire visiting I rarely understood people the first  <br/>
time, but Holly picked it up quickly and would translate for me.  <br/>
<br/>
We sought out &quot;normal&quot; everyday things rather than tourist things, which made <br/>
it even harder (for me).  At stores sometimes I would just hold out a handful <br/>
of money.  Holly would know what they had said and pick out the right coins, <br/>
and give the proper response as we left.  The short little &quot;maybe I help you&quot; <br/>
and &quot;thanks&quot; kinds of phrases were the hardest of all.<br/>
<br/>
I used to interpret, in college, when my friends from Texas or rural New <br/>
Mexico would be trying to converse with kids from Boston or New Jersey.  Some <br/>
phrases would go RIGHT on by, unintelligible.  &quot;There&#39;s a horse in the yard&quot; <br/>
(with Boston accent) meant NOTHING here (neither did the horse in the yard <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).   &quot;We went for a film and a pie&quot; had to be translated to &quot;movies and a <br/>
pizza.&quot;    My boyfriend (from India via Toronto and Summit NJ) got in endless <br/>
loop with my granny in Texas with her &quot;Come again?&quot; and his &quot;Pardon?&quot;  I came <br/>
in about the third round and saved them both.<br/>
<br/>
I got in trouble in a pub, ordering Red Bull and vodka (the current popular <br/>
drink among young people, they said), because when they asked how I wanted it <br/>
I said &quot;whatever&#39;s common.&quot;  All came to a hush and my American friend said, <br/>
&quot;Say customary or normal, not &#39;common&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  Ooops.<br/>

<br/>
In New Mexico, we can watch &quot;Are you Being Served?&quot; and THAT is a weird, <br/>
weird show, but their accents are easy to understand (which might be why we <br/>
get it).  We were getting Mr. Bean for a while.  No dialog removes the <br/>
language problem, but there are still cultural mysteries sometimes.   Black <br/>
Adder was great while it lasted.  I heard there&#39;s a new one with time travel. <br/>
 (Not here, but in England.)<br/>
<br/>
In England last summer The Simpsons was a big item.  That&#39;s about as rough as <br/>
we get on language here, for TV anyway.   It&#39;s been on here for ten years or <br/>
more, so it will be along time before you&#39;ve seen all of those!<br/>

5yrs old would spend many happy hours in laughter.<br/>
*Up in smoke* (movie) was some thing else she rolled around the floor <br/>
laughing at.  The story line went way over her head - but when the <br/>
police stopped them when they were in the car, and knocked on the <br/>
window while the one inside the car sang *keep on knocking but you <br/>
cant come in* dd was in hysterics........ <br/>

on tape, and the kids and I watch them all the time. <br/>
Royle Attkinson Live (is that how its spelled?) is<br/>
also a good one.  My kids love this one(although they<br/>
don&#39;t get most of the jokes, and some might find it<br/>
inappropriate for kids) still they laugh there heads<br/>
off throughout.<br/>

I love &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; but we don&#39;t get it where we live :-(  I almost never watch American commercial television (network) but I do enjoy many Brittish programs when I run across them.  I used to watch Benny Hill when I was a kid, LOL.  And, of course, I love Monty Python.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434473588">&lt;&lt;My family came to visit and were trying to figure out what language the <br/>
people in the store were speaking by picking out a word or two here and <br/>
there...they finally figured out it was local North Carolina English! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Western Arkansas--out of my natural range, but I went for two days, to pick <br/>
up young friends staying with grandparents.  The adults sent these kids for <br/>
&quot;rose-snares,&quot; I thought, and gave them five dollars, and the kids took off <br/>
on foot.  They came back with fresh corn on the cob, unhusked.<br/>
<br/>
I STILL didn&#39;t know what the people had said.  I asked later.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;roastin&#39; ears&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That probably might not make sense to most people even written out, but we <br/>
grew corn when I was growing up and so I&#39;m at least familiar with &quot;ears.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84376727">LOL, reminds me of when a British fellow I lived with <br/>
did a presentation<br/>
here in the states. He walked up to the whiteboard to <br/>
erase it and asked the<br/>
assembled room &quot;Anyone here have a rubber?&quot;. Talk about <br/>
a hush....<br/>
For you on the other side o&#39; the pond, a rubber here is <br/>
another word for<br/>
condom.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that&#39;s a rubber, or to be more precise, a rubber <br/>
johnny or french letter (if you&#39;re really old...)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and he used to go into hysterics every time we <br/>
drove past the<br/>
restaurant called &quot;Knickers&quot; or if I called my bag a <br/>
&quot;fanny&quot; pack. The<br/>
former I take it is slang for underwear in the UK and <br/>
the latter for female<br/>
private parts...<br/>
<br/>
And the bag is a &#39;bum-bag...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll never forget the time I went to the store and <br/>
on the list was &quot;BR&quot;.<br/>
It was the only thing I couldn&#39;t figure out what I <br/>
needed to get. It was<br/>
&quot;Bog Roll&quot; of course (toilet paper)... Amazing how two <br/>
people can speak the<br/>
same language and yet not be able to understand each <br/>
other half the time.<br/>

Definitely divided by a common language...<br/>
