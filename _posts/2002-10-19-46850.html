your out look.  How do you get to that point, or have you always been there?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Heidi (my sister in law&#39;s name is Heidi! :) and welcome to the <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
I was very fortunate to discover, while pregnant with my oldest <br/>
daughter, the late (lamented) America On-Line homeschooling <br/>
forum. Some of the people you see posting here I&#39;ve known for <br/>
over eight years, and they were instrumental in my own growth <br/>
as a person and a parent.<br/>
<br/>
I was also raised in a pretty bizarre combination of support for <br/>
just about anything I wanted to try (flying around to science fiction <br/>
conventions as a teen, raising rats as a hobby, etc.) and yet still <br/>
in a crime-and-punishment oriented household. It has given me <br/>
a pretty good look at what works and what doesn&#39;t if you want to <br/>
create a happy and mentally-healthy household.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787012753">I enjoyed it too. I have been enjoying this whole conversation immensely!<br/>
<br/>
I have found that I am getting better at avoiding punishments. I do have one<br/>
area that I am not sure how to handle. Maybe some of you would like to make <br/>
some suggestions??<br/>
<br/>
I have two boys, Jason (5) and Kyle (2). I have gotten pretty good at handling the bickering<br/>
and fighting when there is a reason...wanting to watch something different,<br/>
play with each others toys etc. I have been talking them through the disagreements<br/>
helping them put into words what they want and need and helping them come to <br/>
agreements. It is paying off so far, as I have noticed Jason is getting better at<br/>
negotiating and asking Kyle for things. And Kyle is starting to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Where I am having a problem is with what to do with the little jabs and pushes. <br/>
Jason will walk past Kyle and bonk him on the head. Or push him as he walks by.<br/>
Or basically do things to torment him (like consistently riding his bike close<br/>
to Kyle&#39;s). Basically looking for a reaction and getting one. Any suggestions<br/>
on how to handle this? I have been stopping him and telling him not to, but<br/>
I feel it is ineffective and that I should be doing more. I have to admit that<br/>
I have yelled in frustration which has not helped and actually led to him <br/>
spitting in my face (this is not normal behavior for him and I know that it<br/>
was a way of getting a reaction from me as he did not like me yelling). I am <br/>
getting better at handling things but still tend to have the old patterns come<br/>
out...feeling that I can not let him treat Kyle (or me) this way, but not sure<br/>
what to do except use punishments (which I normally try to avoid).<br/>
<br/>
I think part of it has to do with attention...Kyle is giving up his naps which<br/>
has resulted in a very cranky 2 year old most days. We have talked about this<br/>
being a phase and Jason has been pretty good about playing on the computer or <br/>
watching tv. I try to give him attention when I can, but I have been pretty <br/>
emotionally exhausted many nights. Jason is the type of kid who thrives on <br/>
attention. I realized this weekend while down at my ILs how much better<br/>
he was  behaving, mostly because my ILs dote on him (which is definitely a good<br/>
thing!). Any suggestions? Jason has also been staying up much later then usual and <br/>
has been ignoring his body signals (we don&#39;t have a set bedtime and he used<br/>
to be pretty good at going to bed when tired). It just hit me last night that I think<br/>
this is his way of getting more time with me.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to get a new perspective on this...thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737181611">Brett started doing these type things to Tyler when he was 4 and Tyler was 3. I think it&#39;s just part of being siblings. Every child with a brother or sister that I&#39;ve known has gone through that &quot;let&#39;s get a rise out of the other&quot; stage. I handled it by letting Tyler know that whenever Brett was bugging him, to say &quot;stop doing that, please&quot; and had a talk with Brett about how when he says &quot;stop&quot; to someone, he wants and expects them to listen to him, so he needs to do the same when someone tells him to stop. I told Tyler if Brett didn&#39;t stop after being asked, that he could always come to me and we&#39;d do something fun together. When he did, Brett would eventually wonder up wanting to join in - I left it up to Tyler whether or not Brett could join, since it was Brett&#39;s actions that caused Tyler to come do whatever in the first place. About half the time, Tyler wouldn&#39;t let Brett join, and I think that made the biggest difference of all. I guess that stage lasted a little over a year, and it still surfaces now and then, but now Tyler has gotten sneaky and will get back at Brett in other ways, and Brett knows it. LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337603856">Stephanie,<br/>
I have had this with my two oldest, doing it to the younger, <br/>
What has seemed to help is I talk with them individually.  We talk about how important and special siblings are and how when they are older they will really enjoy having siblings.  Even is they don&#39;t enjoy them now. (Like if the younger is getting annoying).  Also I do alot of telling them stories of how I felt being a youngest child and it really affected how I felt about myself. ( My older siblings were very resentful of me and were very angry with me all the time. ) I don&#39;t shame them or blame them, but talk about how they are feeling.<br/>
They seem to really treat the younger ones better when they see it as a special thing to have a younger sibling.  Those younger ones really look up to the older and when the older ones figure that out they are so proud of it!<br/>
Hope it helps,<br/>
Take Care,  Kelli<br/>
