We didn&#39;t have any of the choices you have (small town), but he <br/>
wanted to see what middle school was like, and we respected that.<br/>
We had a simple agreement.  You can come back home whenever you want, <br/>
but once you&#39;re home, you stay for the rest of the school year.  <br/>
Also,  while he chose to be at school,  he was expected to &quot;play the <br/>
game,&quot; so to speak - do the work,  do his best to learn, etc.  <br/>
Anyway, he stayed for about 11 weeks until right after Thanksgiving <br/>
and has been home every since.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099262340">We are entering the next phase of our life adventures. My oldest, Emily, who<br/>
will be eight in October, has been insistent that she wants to try school.<br/>
After much time spent dicussing what she wanted to do and why, and<br/>
discussing a number of alternative options, it seems to me that she has the<br/>
idea that school is like an all day play date every day with a lot of kids.<br/>
This from a sensitive, artist type girl who likes to spend a lot of time<br/>
alone, and when we have a full calendar says to me, &quot;Mom, why do we have to<br/>
go somewhere everyday?  Why can&#39;t someone come over our house?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But she is adamant about going to school.  We are very fortunate to now be<br/>
living in Ann  Arbor.  Where we used to live I wouldn&#39;t even dream about<br/>
sending her to school.  So here we were able to investigate a wide range of<br/>
private schools (none of which we could afford), several public charter<br/>
schools, (all of which focused on Math, Science, and Technology; you know,<br/>
prepare kids for the ecomony type education:^p) and the public Open school.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the families in our church send their children to the Open school,<br/>
which is based on the philosophy that each child arrives at school with<br/>
their own strengths and potential and it is up to the teacher to facilitate<br/>
learning.  Also, each student is democratically represented, and time is<br/>
spent on cooperation and comunication.  There is  a much higher (than<br/>
traditional schools) number of field trips and guests, and each child is<br/>
free to choose to be in any classroom, the media center, the music room, the<br/>
art room, or the science lab throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
So all things considered, I feel very fortunate that we have this option<br/>
here.  I know if Emily had to go to traditional school, she probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t choose to, because she has already told me that she is not the<br/>
sitting still do work all day kind of girl.  Still, I went through a period<br/>
of wondering what  I did to fail her in some way.  I have realized that<br/>
following my principles of respecting the child and trusting that they will<br/>
commincate their needs to me,  responding to her and trusting her means<br/>
having faith in her.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I both agreed years ago that when the kids were old enough to<br/>
choose, that they would have that option.  I am still dealing with my own<br/>
unschooling ideals that any school, even an open school, is too far removed<br/>
from the real world of society and the natural rhthym of nature to be<br/>
useful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562448249">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter was adamant about trying school at the same age as your<br/>
daughter. She is now 10 and there is no looking back ...homeschooling is<br/>
her No. 1 choice.<br/>
<br/>
I must admit that it was a stretch to try to be positive about her choice<br/>
to try school, but I did it.  We (dh and I) decided to let her try a school<br/>
for a few days so that if it was a disaster she could leave and save face.<br/>
We told her that after a two day trial she could decide whether to stay<br/>
home or try school for a semester. <br/>
<br/>
We chose a school that we would have sent her to in the first place (if we<br/>
had to) and with her best buddy. We packed a lunch and drove to school. My<br/>
heart was in my throat...<br/>
For two days she attended the school and didn&#39;t say anything much about the<br/>
experience but seemed keen to return the second day. I kept breathing...<br/>
<br/>
On the second day as we drove home from school I asked, &quot;So, would like you<br/>
like to give school a try??&quot;<br/>
Her response was solid. She did not want to return to an institution..she<br/>
found the space physically &#39;hard&#39; and unwelcoming (I found this<br/>
particularly interesting ...that she would key in on the hard floor, the<br/>
concrete walls, the hard desks, ..)and she found that she spent a lot of<br/>
time pretending to be doing work so that the teacher would not give her<br/>
another project (the kids taught her this...). She basically told me that<br/>
it was a waste of her time and that she loved being able to work when she<br/>
felt like it.  &quot;I have decided to stay home until grade 12 and then I will<br/>
write my exams for college,&quot; she said this with total authority. My life<br/>
flashed before my eyes...I am here for a few more years  :)<br/>
<br/>
In retrospect, I think that if we had fought her on her choice or given our<br/>
opinions of school she might have stayed longer but we tried to stay out of<br/>
her process. And I think that it must take a lot of courage to ask to go to<br/>
school if you know your parents are not too keen on the idea. I had to<br/>
honour her courageous (and inquisitive) act. I am glad that she went<br/>
because she now knows that she is happiest at home.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, <br/>
Brooke in British Columbia<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Sam, Clonlara&#39;s tuition  is over $6K/year, something we could not<br/>
afford.  They do have single classes for homeschoolers (still a bit steep in<br/>
my opinion) which I offered to my daughter, but she refused. She wants to do<br/>
the whole day school thing of being there every day with all the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Their son made a list of all the questions they had about<br/>
&gt; school.....everything  they were wondering about.<br/>
&gt; Then, they made an appointment with the school principal, and the child<br/>
&gt; interviewed the principal, and had all their questions answered......<br/>
&gt; that was enough to change their mind.  I think it was a fantastic way<br/>
&gt; for the decision to be made.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We spent a lot of time writing lists of what Emily wanted to do and various<br/>
ways of accomplishing this.  We made lists of what she wanted to learn, what<br/>
she wanted to do, what she thought she might get out of school, why she<br/>
wanted to go. We wrote down all of our options for school, and what it might<br/>
be like.  We called all of the local schools and asked questions.  We<br/>
visited the schools before we made our choice.  Emily was enamored of the<br/>
Open School, and looking forward to  being there with a lot of the kids from<br/>
church.  Now my 5 year old twins want to go to school, but there are 45 kids<br/>
on a waiting list, so they&#39;ll  have to wait whether they like it or not!  I<br/>
want to wait a while and see how Emily fares before I go putting her sisters<br/>
on a waiting list at their young age.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much those of you who wrote with suggestions.  I like the two<br/>
day idea, too, but am thinking it is really hard to really get an idea of<br/>
what the school is like in the first two days, especially a free place like<br/>
the Open School.  I think it takes the first week to get over being tired<br/>
and unsure of what&#39;s going to happen next. I think I will sit down with<br/>
Emily and ask her what she thinks, if she wants to talk about it after a<br/>
week, or after the first month.<br/>
<br/>
I am beginning to get over my own concerns (which I have kept to myself<br/>
really well) and trusting more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732295765">Why not let her go a few days and discover she doesn&#39;t like it?  Is it costing<br/>
money?  Are you afraid she will never &quot;stick to&quot; anything? Are you afraid she<br/>
will regret having quit and always think it was better than it was?  Talk to her<br/>
about it if she decides to quit.  I think quitting after the first hour should<br/>
be an option.  Sometimes I know enough in a short time to quit something or<br/>
leave some place that is obnoxious for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910010566">Well, today is Emily&#39;s third day of school and so far she loves the Open<br/>
School.  She has made a lot of friends, and really likes her teacher.<br/>
Interesting coincidence, the principle of her school homeschooled her three<br/>
grown children through Clonlara, so she likes Emily right away.<br/>
<br/>
The school is really interesting so far, they have morning Meetings and<br/>
afternoon Choice where they can do just about anything.  Emily&#39;s teacher was<br/>
really impressed with her, and told me a neat little story when I picked her<br/>
up yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
On the first day everyone did introductions and Emily was the only child<br/>
there who  had homeschooled.  One of the boys piped up and said, &quot;That&#39;s<br/>
where your Mom and Dad teach you the lessons.&quot; and Emily replied, &quot;my Mom<br/>
and Dad don&#39;t teach me, I teach myself.&quot;  What a girl!<br/>
<br/>
My only concern with her is that after the novelty wears off that she might<br/>
grow bored, but we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.  Of course now<br/>
her two little sisters want to go school.  This is such a huge shift; we<br/>
have been a homeschooling family for *years*, and I have been a<br/>
homeschooling advocate/activist.  All of the reasons that we talk about<br/>
homeschooling are true; the school routine does take over your whole family.<br/>
Evenings used to be full of projects and spontaneous trips; now we have to<br/>
get everybody cleaned up and in bed for early rising.  Just having to get up<br/>
one hour earlier is taking some adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see how things play out.  I keep reminding myself that she may do<br/>
really well in an open school, and also that it isn&#39;t necessarily permanent.<br/>
She may choose to come home next week, next month, or even next year.  She<br/>
knows it&#39;s an option, something I didn&#39;t have when I hated school.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, it&#39;s still a school, and they are held to following the<br/>
state&#39;s requirements.  No matter how good the teacher, I have trouble<br/>
believing that any real learning can occur when material has to be packaged<br/>
and presented to a group of children.  I fail to see how there can be any<br/>
real exploration and in depth personal learning and growth in the school<br/>
model.  It all seems so superfical; there are collages in shoe boxes and<br/>
paper mache models, but no garden!  It feels very cold and hard, inorganic.<br/>
So removed from real life.<br/>
<br/>
Enough of that; one of the things the parents there like about the Open<br/>
School is that parents are welcomed and encouraged to participate at all<br/>
times.  They even plan Open Fridays when parents are encouraged to come in<br/>
and lead an activity of their interest and skills.  I can see that if Emily<br/>
lasts, I will be starting a garden committee...<br/>

<br/>
Thank you , Lori.  You are so right.  Last night the bugs started crawling<br/>
out, Emily started telling me about how mean most of the boys are with<br/>
teasing and being rowdy in class.  The teacher is constantly telling them to<br/>
to be quiet or sit down.  I don&#39;t know if this is a problem with the kids,<br/>
or the teacher.  My gut feeling when I walked into her classroom ten minutes<br/>
early yesterday was that these kids were trouble!!  I told her that is<br/>
always a problem in school, and it makes it harder for her to to hear the<br/>
teacher or get attention.  For the first time all week I contrasted school<br/>
with homeschooling, but she was firm.  She said she doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
homeschool because it&#39;s boring.<br/>
