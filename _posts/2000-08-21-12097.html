<div id="ygrps-yiv-777534054">Interesting couple of days, I got sunburnt yesterday (yes, that&#39;s <br/>
possible in Yorkshire *grin*,) today we have thunderstorms with <br/>
hailstones!!!  Is this August?  Can you say &#39;Global Warming???&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is also a quick note, that I might not be reading my <br/>
mail or chatting too much this week, so if anyone wants me <br/>
particularly, please mail me direct...  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tracy.oldfield@...">tracy.oldfield@...</a><br/>

Catchya&#39;ll soon!<br/>
