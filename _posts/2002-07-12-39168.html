<div id="ygrps-yiv-623631840">Back when I was asking about chess books, some wonderful person from here<br/>
recommneded the Usborne Guide to Advanced Chess.  (I had a computer clean-up<br/>
fit recently and deleted her email, unfortunately.)  But my books arrived<br/>
yesterday, and everybody here has scanned that one at least once.  It&#39;s<br/>
terrific, and just what we needed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much, and I&#39;m sorry I forgot who you were!<br/>
