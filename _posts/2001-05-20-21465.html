<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657547885">Hi everybody, <br/>
I&#39;m Dustin.  I&#39;m 16 years old and I&#39;m ending my 10th grade year of <br/>
school, and I&#39;m considering homeschooling(or unschooling).  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure of how to go about doing this.  I guess my question is: How do I <br/>
go about this &quot;unschooling&quot; I mean, how do I graduate if I never take <br/>
any classes?  Point me in the right direction.<br/>
thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137179417">Hi Dusty<br/>
<br/>
You need the book &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by Grace Llewellyn. It<br/>
will explain all. :)<br/>
You could take the GED and be done with it and just go to college or live or<br/>
whatever. Or you could unschool yourself by learning what you want and<br/>
consider yourself &quot;graduated&quot; when you think you&#39;re done.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947666048">It depends...<br/>
What are your goals? Why do you want to graduate? If you just need a date and <br/>
school name to put on job applications, make one up. If you need specific <br/>
information or training for your desired career, learn it, from books or from <br/>
people who know or from community or junior college classes or other. If <br/>
you&#39;re applying to universities, you may want to research what has been <br/>
successful for other homeschoolers applying to the schools you&#39;re interested <br/>
in. There&#39;s a lot of information out there on that subject.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s really not one &quot;one size fits all&quot; type answer. Until you <br/>
know where you want to go, it&#39;s hard to tell how to get there.<br/>

<br/>
Plus find some homeschooling families in your area who might introduce you to <br/>
other homeschooled teens who might have good local leads and ideas.<br/>
