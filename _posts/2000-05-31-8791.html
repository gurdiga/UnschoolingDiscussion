<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380179995">Hello Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading about several of you living on farms and lots of acreage.  <br/>
We are currently looking at some land many, many miles from where we live <br/>
now, but closer to my dh&#39;s work.  However the problem is...I have never <br/>
lived on that much acreage (only an acre!) and that far out by nothing but <br/>
farms!  What are the pros and cons?  Have any of you lived in the city and <br/>
the country?  How did you feel about the country life-people, work, life in <br/>
general?  Part of me says this would be a fantastic experience for our kids, <br/>
but another part of me says &quot;what about people contact? stores?&quot; I would <br/>
appreciate any input on this subject!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184895692">Dh and I were both brought up in the country until we were 15 / 16 and then<br/>
moved to the city where we stayed until a year ago (we are now 48 / 49). Our<br/>
children were 18 (living away from home), 15, 12, 9 when we moved. We rented<br/>
until 3 months ago when we moved onto our 16 acres.<br/>
<br/>
I know quite a few people who have moved fron city to country and many are very<br/>
happy. The ones who aren&#39;t are usually the ones who moved for the sake of the<br/>
children. Who moved because they thought it would be a good place to bring up<br/>
their kids. Obviously you wouldn&#39;t do it because you thought it was bad for your<br/>
kids &lt;g&gt; but IMO the kids shouldn&#39;t be your primary reason for moving. If they<br/>
are older, like mine, they will need an adjustment time, in fact may never<br/>
adjust, and they will feel especially resentful if they are aware or reminded<br/>
that you moved for their benefit. Even if they are babies when you move they may<br/>
not be the sort of kids who will relish country life.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I am saying is, *you* and your partner must really want to live<br/>
in the country for your *own* sakes. The &#39;great for the kids bit&#39; may or may not<br/>
be an added bonus.  But if you aren&#39;t committed to the lifestyle and loving it,<br/>
you will end up really resenting your kids for whom you made such a sacrifice.<br/>
Believe me, I&#39;ve seen it!<br/>
<br/>
We discussed what we wanted to do with our kids and 2 of the 3 living at home<br/>
didn&#39;t really want to move. We pointed out that for us it was now or never due<br/>
to our age (48 /49) and they were accepting of that. Actually, they don&#39;t hate<br/>
it - but if they were feeling an expectation that they should enjoy it, I<br/>
believe we&#39;d have major problems.<br/>
<br/>
I know we aren&#39;t long time back-to-the-landers yet but I did a lot of talking to<br/>
people during the couple of years before we took the plunge, and this is what I<br/>
observed / was told.<br/>
<br/>
Final word - I LOVE living out here &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It seems to be a big plus that the land is closer to your husband&#39;s <br/>
work than where you live now, moving further away from work and <br/>
creating a longer commute is often a problem when people move to <br/>
the country.<br/>

My children and I never lived on a farm before, now we can do all <br/>
sorts of farm tasks, ploughing, & seeding fields, making hay, <br/>
driving tractors, castrating bull calves, lambs and kids [with elastic <br/>
bands] assist in the delivery of animals, installing and repairing <br/>
electric fences, incubating 200+ chicks a week, feeding the <br/>
assortment of animals and caring for them, and operating an <br/>
assortment of machinery.<br/>
<br/>
The pros to me are that we are more involved in life, we spend time <br/>
doing real things, the children learn a lot from being on a farm, life <br/>
and death, caring for animals, cruel hard facts of life for male farm <br/>
animals [we treat our animals humanely and none are kept in <br/>
confinement conditions, but whenever there are female animals <br/>
having babies, there is an excess of males, to keep them intact <br/>
would just lead to a lot of fighting, to keep them too long would be <br/>
financial suicide] just to name a few things.  They can understand <br/>
and participate in the running of the farm and they know that their <br/>
assistance is of real value.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We are lucky to be only 3 miles out of Winona so we are in no way <br/>
isolated, also being the local compost site we get a lot of people <br/>
here on weekends and the kids interact with a lot of visitors.<br/>
I guess in some rural areas you could feel isolated and have to make an<br/>
effort to get your children some company if they are out of school.<br/>
<br/>
Also if you are only doing it for the children, I&#39;d rethink it, there is a <br/>
lot of work involved with a larger property especially if you have <br/>
animals.<br/>
