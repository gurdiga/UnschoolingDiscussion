----------------------<br/>
<br/>
They do what they like and get out into the community and volunteer and <br/>
eventually are offered or get a lead on a job.<br/>
<br/>
They apply for some beginnig kind of college class at a junior college or <br/>
community college and see if they like it, sometimes. After they take a few <br/>
classes, they can say &quot;some college&quot; on applications, and if they did okay on those <br/>
clases, they can use that when they apply to college full time.<br/>

*************<br/>
How does anyone go to college or get a job? Not saying college is or isn&#39;t <br/>
important, but many many people never went or dropped out. And lots of folks <br/>
have jobs. My DH has one, there are a few others here who either have spouses <br/>
that work or they work themselves. Some of the kids have jobs too. Moly has a <br/>
small lawn mowing business; complete with fliers, cards, bills, and receipts, she <br/>
is almost ten. She doesn&#39;t go to school or college. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have noticed that home-schoolers tend to be more entrepreneurial, <br/>
generally, than the general population. Their children will, I think, tend <br/>
to be even more oriented towards creating their own businesses than <br/>
&quot;getting a job.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the job market -- and for the most part college as well -- is just as <br/>
accessible to home-schooled youngsters as the government-schooled. Nearly <br/>
every state offers a &quot;general education degree&quot; type certificate one <br/>
obtains by passing written exams, which functions as the equivalent of a <br/>
high-school diploma. And increasingly, both employers and colleges are <br/>
looking at a lot of things _besides_ a high-school sheepskin to gauge <br/>
applicants, as said sheepskins have plummeted in value.<br/>

process, or an interview, or all of the above...<br/>
<br/>
Some don&#39;t go to college (just like schooled people) and some <br/>
make their own jobs (just like schooled people).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67110314">Hello! My name is Elizabeth. I have four children, ages 7; 3; 2 and 2 months. This is our second year of homeschooling, and in the past two years we&#39;ve run the gamut of school at home to unschooling and back to school at home and now once again into unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going home for Christmas, and I know the subject of &quot;homeschooling&quot; is going to come up. My younger brother is the only one at this point who knows we&#39;re homeschooling and he wants to know more of why, etc. I pointed him in the direction of J.T. Gatto and John Holt&#39;s writings on education and he&#39;s promised to read them so we can have an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; debate (something we used to do when growing up that I&#39;m looking forward to..it means staying up late arguing loudly, M&Ms as weapons and some Cherry Coke LOL) about the subject. He is the ONLY one in my family open to hearing me out rather than just chewing me out. <br/>
<br/>
Two years ago when we were thinking about homeschooling, I tried to tell my mother why we were considering it, etc. and she had a COW over it. She&#39;s not at all open to  the idea. Especially because my oldest has some &quot;special needs&quot; issues. <br/>
<br/>
SO when we go home, and my mother realizes that Sarah&#39;s &quot;missing nearly a month of school&quot; by the time we go back home, and that I won&#39;t have a single book or assignment for her to &quot;stay caught up&quot; with...it&#39;s going to get rough. Worse when I explain that we don&#39;t use a curriculum at all, just life. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not worried so much about me in all of the mess that&#39;s coming because I&#39;m used to it. There isn&#39;t a darn thing I have EVER done in my life that has been&quot;right&quot; according to my mother. But Sarah is an innocent. I&#39;ve explained to her that Grandma doesn&#39;t agree with homeschooling and that there might be an argument over it while we&#39;re there. She already knows that while we&#39;re at Grandma&#39;s house there will be a ton of rules to follow &quot;Don&#39;t touch this, don&#39;t touch that, children need to eat everything on their plates and not snack and go to bed at 6:30 pm&quot; type things. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d avoid visiting my mother if I could, but she&#39;s asked for us to come up (we&#39;ll be staying with my inlaws who are 100% supportive of us) and visit. She&#39;s never met the two youngest, only seen Logan once and Sarah three times in their lives. <br/>
<br/>
Among the arguments I know she&#39;ll bring up will be that it&#39;s irresponsible of me to presume that I can educate my children better than a professional. I know unschooling isn&#39;t irresponsible, but rather teaching my child to become responsible for her own self. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas how I might handle this, especially how I might keep it from becoming a major issue? I have thought about sitting down and writing out a letter explaining our reasons and everything and sending it before we come down. <br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth<br/>

********************************<br/>
A couple of ideas:  The letter sounds good.  It&#39;d be a good start.  I&#39;d ask <br/>
her in the letter to call you and you can talk about it, but I&#39;d also let her <br/>
know that if there is going to be any arguments about it, then you won&#39;t be <br/>
visiting her.  Explain that you don&#39;t want your daughter to ever feel that your <br/>
choices are less than &quot;adequate&quot; or that she is missing out on a lot.  If she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a cow about it this time, maybe you could bring her a very simple <br/>
book by J. T. Gatto to read.  Afterall, he WAS a &quot;professional&quot; who&#39;s eyes <br/>
were opened to a better way of teaching.  I&#39;d especially bring something of his <br/>
explaining why the school system is broke and unfixable.  Good luck! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wrote a letter like thise for my MIL but never sent it because we came to a sort of truce. I forget trying to explain unschooling and she doesn&#39;t question my choice. But...The letter I wrote started up with a lot of buttering up. Something like, <br/>
    &quot;I know your questions about homeschooling come from your love and concern for Catherine. First off I&#39;d like to say Thank You for that. Catherine is lucky to have so many caring people in her life who have her best interests at heart.  <br/>
    I know the choice we&#39;ve made seems strange but it&#39;s one that we made in the interests of raising a responsible, independant person who carrys a love of learning with her throughout her life. There is a lot of information out there regarding homeschooling and unschooling and I have spent a lot of time researching this. Here&#39;s a list of books, websites, etc. that you can look at for yourself and that can answer your questions better than I could.&quot;<br/>
    I wouldn&#39;t bother explaining to much. If you give her a nice long list of resources to search out you&#39;ve made it her problem. If she chooses to do the research she may come around. If she doesn&#39;t then her refusal to do so is her responsibility and you have the right not to be dragged into any arguments she hasn&#39;t bothered to prepare herself for.<br/>
    Other then that I&#39;d just prepare short, snippy answers in advance. About whether you&#39;re qualified maybe, &quot;I know that Mom, but she&#39;s imminently qualified to learn so I don&#39;t need to worry about teaching.&quot; But stop it there and don&#39;t get dragged into anything further. Tell her to take her list of books to the library and research. Hope this helps.<br/>

I would do that, and I would also say the length of your time in her home is <br/>
going to depend on her willingness to let you be there in happiness and peace, <br/>
that you&#39;re not coming to be on trial or shamed in front of your children, <br/>
and that it&#39;s up to her whether he can be welcoming and sweet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-759084189">Tia said &quot;I thought she meant she wouldn&#39;t have a single *school book* with her on their visit&quot;&#92;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that is what I meant. No text-books. Traveling a two-day road trip with no books?! YIKES! NOT HAPPENING! AND we have library cards for the library systems at both my mother&#39;s AND my motherinlaw&#39;s handy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837744458"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t you have ANY books at your house!?  If not, GET some.  Don&#39;t you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have  libraries near your house?  Tell them your kids have access to<br/>
thousands of  books and the internet.   Tell them what you Do have instead<br/>
of what you don&#39;t.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that when you&#39;re dealing with disapproving relatives you need to<br/>
come across with supreme confidence. I never wait to be asked what we are<br/>
doing I start first and tell them excitedly all the WONDERFUL stuff we have<br/>
been doing, the great books we have read, places we have been. Make a big<br/>
list for yourself before you go and and think hard about all the<br/>
conversations you have had with your kids, movies that have provided food<br/>
for thought and go armed with confidence and joy in your life and your<br/>
children&#39;s learning.<br/>
