<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120924725">Hello. My name is David, a 16 year old unschooler. First time posting<br/>
here, as well. =) Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ll just skim over my unschooling history. I became<br/>
frusterated at junior high for all the reasons teenagers usually have,<br/>
started the whole rebelling thing, failed 9th grade on purpose, etc.<br/>
In the beginning of my second year of 9th grade, I found the Teenage<br/>
Liberation Handbook. Having really no support for trying to get out of<br/>
school, I decided to try to &quot;fight the system&quot; by myself. (Both of my<br/>
parents didn&#39;t like the idea, but they didn&#39;t really get in my way<br/>
that much. I can be very stubborn and strong willed when I set my mind<br/>
on something. =P) After skipping school on and off for about two<br/>
months, the school threatened to send my parents to court, and so I<br/>
went back to school. It wasn&#39;t fun at all, (I would get detention for<br/>
reading books in class instead of &quot;learning&quot;, and then get sent to<br/>
alternative schools for reading in detention. =P), but I stayed in<br/>
school until I turned 16, then rose out of it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been out of school for about a little over half a year now. But I<br/>
feel like I haven&#39;t *done* anything. I like messing around with<br/>
computers and electronics, and I can safely say I know more about them<br/>
than the average user, but I would like some pointers on what I should<br/>
do. The internet has been great in helping and research, but I would<br/>
like to find some kind of computer store, or something, and try to get<br/>
some kind of job there, but I live in a very small town in rural New<br/>
York. Stuff about philosophy, and things like that also interest me.<br/>
(The closest library is about 7 - 10-ish miles away.) <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, any feedback would be nice. If you have any other questions,<br/>
feel free to ask. <br/>
Thank you in advance!<br/>
-Dave</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-247308055">Dave, I&#39;m afraid this doesn&#39;t exactly answer your question, but I think you&#39;ll find some <br/>

like I wanted some direction, I enrolled in the local community college and <br/>
just took courses that interested me. Maybe you could do something like that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912406163">Hi David.  <br/>
<br/>
We used to live in a very small town.  I also have a 16-y-o son, who <br/>
after leaving school 2 1/2 years ago, spent quite a bit of <br/>
time &quot;doing nothing.&quot;  So, from that base of experience, I have a <br/>
couple of suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Get a job, even if it&#39;s not in your field of interest.  Earning money <br/>
will enable you to expand your world--by getting a car, license, <br/>
insurance; by funding workshops, book purchases, computer stuff, <br/>
classes, conferences, camps; by funding memberships (DVD clubs like <br/>
Netflicks or Mentura), subscriptions, etc.  Running your own computer <br/>
assistance business might work in a town like yours.  Put an ad on <br/>
the local bulletin board and in the local shopper.  Other self-<br/>
employment ideas: house cleaning, yard work, childcare, snow <br/>
shoveling, cleaning gutters, painting.  It can feel good to work--<br/>
gets your energy going. <br/>
<br/>
Challenge yourself to ask questions when you watch a movie or read a <br/>
book.  Write them down.  Pursue answers.  <br/>
<br/>
Ask the library that&#39;s closest to you to get titles you want, either <br/>
on interlibrary loan, or by purchasing them. <br/>
<br/>
Some books my son has enjoyed recently: <br/>
The Simpsons and Philosphy: the D&#39;oh! of Homer. eds: Irwin, Conard, & <br/>
Skoble<br/>
Rich Dad, Poor Dad, by Robert T. Kiyosaki & Sharon L. Lechter (about <br/>
financial intelligence; the authors note that schools do nothing to <br/>
promote financial intelligence, but merely repeat the &quot;stay in <br/>
school, get good grades, get a degree, so you can get a good job&quot; <br/>
line, which, the authors say, isn&#39;t true and doesn&#39;t teach money <br/>
management at all)<br/>
Knowing God, by J.I. Packer<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re interested in philosophy, my husband recommends:<br/>
<br/>
Patterns of the Western Mind, by John Kok  --long ordering time from <br/>
Amazon, quicker at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dordt.edu/bookstore/">http://www.dordt.edu/bookstore/</a> <br/>
<br/>
I encourage you to get to know some people better in that small town <br/>
of yours.  You write well.  Have you thought about putting together a <br/>
history of your town, or a collection of stories from its <br/>
inhabitants?  Start with some of the oldest people there.  How has <br/>
life changed?  How is it the same?  Why?<br/>
<br/>
The best to you,<br/>
Lynn<br/>
<br/>
