&gt; my escape.  I still have my original copy.  Pages are torn, a few missing <br/>
&gt; and I only have the front cover, which is barely attached by the thread <br/>
&gt; binding.  I purchased a new copy for my children but alas, they don&#39;t find <br/>
&gt; comfort in that book as I once did.  I suppose that&#39;s a good thing! &lt;bg&gt;  I <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; still read it though.  Despite my reasons for loving it then, I still find <br/>
&gt; such joy in that book.  I&#39;m still a day-dreamer, dreaming of what I will do <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to my house and yard, and find a lot of inspiration in that little gem of a <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; book. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OH and it has a happy ending!!!<br/>

sister, and it was so wonderful. It&#39;s also by Julie Andrews, which is cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-768583500">Sounds a lot like &quot;An Episode of Sparrows&quot;, about an orphan living with<br/>
her aunt & uncle above their restaurant, who escapes by making a garden<br/>
in the disused back area of a church in London. Happy ending too.<br/>
