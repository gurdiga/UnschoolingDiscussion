I&#39;d been looking into the Waldorf approach...seems to come with the AP territory...but this sort of thing is enough to turn me off completely.<br/>

  The more I learn about Waldorf schools and Rudolf Steiner, the less respect I <br/>
  have for them.<br/>
<br/>
  It sure does SELL well to peace-loving, artsy, loving parents with cash, <br/>
  though.   Their assertions about music and art sound good and soothing while <br/>
  you&#39;re first hearing it, but from the point of view of art or music they seem <br/>
  like nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
  And one of the saddest homeschooling stories I&#39;ve ever heard was of a family <br/>
  where the parents became suddenly SO sold on Waldorf stuff that they went in <br/>
  and cleaned out their son&#39;s toys.  Everything with faces and everything <br/>
  plastic was swept up and trashed.  And they presented him with his new <br/>
  improved &quot;guaranteed&quot; nurturing and wonderful new toys.  But the little boy&#39;s <br/>
  favorite thing had been a My Little Pony, and it was thrown away without <br/>
  consultation.  He had not only no interest in the new faceless wooden pony, <br/>
  but felt hugely betrayed and hurt.<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s another example of parents looking at a &quot;program&quot; instead of at their <br/>
  own child.<br/>
