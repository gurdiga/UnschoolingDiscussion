&gt;<br/>
&gt; first:  you wrote: &lt;&lt;Although I certainly do not feed-on-demand&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; i wonder, what does your view see that is so shockingly wrong with following<br/>
&gt; the cues that God has given the baby to tell us of her needs?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all there is nothing &quot;shockingly&quot; wrong with demand feeding, I didn&#39;t<br/>
mean to sound that way.  My personal definition of demand feeding is feeding<br/>
whenever the baby cries no matter how much time has gone by since the last<br/>
feeding.  Even if it has only been an hour.  The Ezzo&#39;s are being slammed for<br/>
Parent-controlled feeding.<br/>
<br/>
I will give you the definition of Parent Controlled feeding straight from their<br/>
book:<br/>
    &quot;It is unfortunate, but there are still some whose only understanding of an<br/>
infant schedule comes from old wives&#39; tales and bad advice.  They speak of rigid<br/>
feeding periods with babies crying needlessly, waiting to be fed - and mothers<br/>
who are forced to harden their hearts to their baby&#39;s cry.  Although that may be<br/>
an accurate reflection of the J.B. Watson era, it is a distorted picture of what<br/>
an infant schedule should be and what Parent-Controlled Feeding is.<br/>
    The Parent-Controlled Feeding plan has to do with more than just feeding.  It<br/>
is a 24 hour strategy designed to meet not only the needs of your baby, but those<br/>
of the entire family as well.  It&#39;s made up of 3 basic activities that are<br/>
repeated in a rythmical cycle throughout the day: feeding, wake time, and nap<br/>
time.  Those cycles are both routine and predictable&quot;  (Italics theirs) And then<br/>
they go in to say why routine and predictability are important to an infant.<br/>
<br/>
There is another method of feeding that I beleive the Ezzo&#39;s method is being<br/>
mixed up with.  The Clock Feeding or hyper-schedule.  It is a synthetic response<br/>
since the mothering process is subject to the clock as the final authority.  The<br/>
clock in a sense assumes all responsibility of right and wrong, removing the need<br/>
for emotions.  The Ezzo&#39;s do not teach this nor do they believe it is right!<br/>
<br/>
I feed my baby taking into consideration both time and true need.  I know that<br/>
babies go through growth spurts and that sometimes their motabolism slows down,<br/>
and I also consider that.  When my daughter was first born I was feeding her<br/>
whenever she cried.  When I read about the PCF I tried it and it worked for me.<br/>
Feeding, waketime and naptime, in that order every 3-4 hours really freed me up<br/>
and seemed to take the stress out of it for me.  I had her on a schedule and she<br/>
also seemed a lot less fussy than before.  Like I said, it worked for me.<br/>
Everyone has their own way of doing things and I do not have any sort of<br/>
authority nor do I give myself heirs (sp?) to say anything about the way anyone<br/>
else does things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and second:  &lt;&lt;But I always compare it to what Scripture has to say.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; since Scripture can be so easily used out of context to suit the defender, on<br/>
&gt; whose interpretation do you rest your trust?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honestly I rest my trust on God.  I pray about it and go with what he tells me.<br/>
I am certainly human and make plenty of mistakes, so I can truly say that I try<br/>
my best and rely on God to give me the wisdom I need.  He says He gives it freely<br/>
to all who ask, so I ask on a regular basis!!! :-) I definately need it with 4<br/>
kids!  I am not saying that because you demand feed that you aren&#39;t following<br/>
what God has said.  God says different things to different people.  TV might be a<br/>
sin for one person because they put it before God and not for another because<br/>
they don&#39;t. As long as you&#39;re living your best to please and follow Jesus, that&#39;s<br/>
all that matters.  If you or I are doing anything wrong, as Christians He will<br/>
show it to us eventually.  Isn&#39;t that good to know.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for asking and I am really sorry that I ever brought this up.  I know<br/>
this is a mailing list about unschooling not debates on which way is right to<br/>
breastfeed and raise your kids.  Please believe me that I never meant for any of<br/>
this to happen!  I don&#39;t subscribe to being the final authority on anything so<br/>
please don&#39;t take anything I said as being condemning or condesending!<br/>
God Bless!!! :-)<br/>

It seems to me that this list is so much more then just a one subject list, <br/>
just as unschooling is so much more then just one thing.  We share and grow <br/>
and help, our children as well as each other, I hope this list remains a <br/>
place for all of us to be able to talk about what concerns us, that is how <br/>
life long learners learn! lol   <br/>
