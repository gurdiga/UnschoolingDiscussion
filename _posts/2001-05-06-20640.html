Zwolle paddling case makes New York Times -from the Sabine News<br/>
<br/>
From The New York Times: ZWOLLE, La. — Laid out on the kitchen table, the<br/>
snapshots of 10- year-old Megan Cahanin make a grim collage. They are not of<br/>
her sweet face, but of her bare behind. There are 12 in all, taken, her<br/>
mother says, day by day as the doughnut- shaped bruises on each cheek faded<br/>
from a mottled purple to a dirty gray.<br/>

ZWOLLE, La. — Laid out on the kitchen table, the snapshots of 10- year-old<br/>
Megan Cahanin make a grim collage. They are not of her sweet face, but of<br/>
her bare behind. There are 12 in all, taken, her mother says, day by day as<br/>
the doughnut- shaped bruises on each cheek faded from a mottled purple to a<br/>
dirty gray.<br/>
<br/>
Megan&#39;s father, Robert Cahanin, recalls that when he first saw the bruises,<br/>
hours after she was paddled by her school principal for elbowing a friend in<br/>
the cafeteria, he collapsed on the floor, crying. Then he picked up the<br/>
phone and called the police, the school board, the governor, his lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It hurt me more than it hurt Megan,&quot; Mr. Cahanin said in a twist on the old<br/>
parental prespanking saw. &quot;You don&#39;t hit on my baby.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Megan, a fourth grader whose name appears more often on the honor roll than<br/>
on a referral slip to the principal&#39;s office, is one of millions of public<br/>
school students still subject to corporal punishment, and in March her<br/>
family joined a small but apparently growing number who are suing to stop<br/>
it. Megan&#39;s classmate DeWayne Ebarb, a hyperactive child who has been<br/>
paddled regularly throughout his time at Zwolle Elementary — on 17 occasions<br/>
in 8 weeks last fall alone — filed a second suit in late April, leaving this<br/>
close- knit logging town of 2,000 pondering a practice as old as time.<br/>
<br/>
Though it gets little attention, corporal punishment in schools remains<br/>
legal in 23 states, and the United States Education Department&#39;s most recent<br/>
data show that 365,000 children were paddled in the 1997-98 school year,<br/>
most in a swath of Southern states that could be called the Belt Belt.<br/>
<br/>
Yet recent debate over corporal punishment focuses largely on parents, with<br/>
even many pro-spanking psychologists and pediatricians loath to support the<br/>
principal&#39;s paddle. At the same time, though, some school districts and<br/>
states say they must increasingly rely on physical discipline as the public<br/>
pushes for a crackdown on student misbehavior.<br/>
<br/>
And legislation pending in Congress as part of President Bush&#39;s education<br/>
package could expand the practice by giving teachers and principals broad<br/>
protection from liability for disciplinary actions.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Almost every democracy in the world has bans on corporal punishment — we&#39;re<br/>
going in the opposite direction,&quot; said Robert Fathman of Dublin, Ohio,<br/>
president of the National Coalition to Abolish Corporal Punishment in<br/>
Schools. &quot;You can&#39;t whack a prisoner, but you can whack a kindergarten<br/>
child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But in many communities like Zwolle (pronounced zeh-WAH-lee), a hamlet about<br/>
80 miles south of Shreveport best known for its annual tamale festival,<br/>
parents and educators base their support for corporal punishment on two<br/>
powerful sources: the Bible, and their own experience.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s the way that I grew up, that&#39;s the way it&#39;s always been in this<br/>
society here,&quot; said Dan Leslie, superintendent in Sabine Parish, whose 12<br/>
schools include Zwolle Elementary. &quot;You act ugly, you do something bad, you<br/>
get a whipping.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of the 27 states that have banned corporal punishment in school, the first<br/>
was New Jersey, in 1867. Massachusetts came next, a century later, in 1971.<br/>
When Mr. Fathman started his crusade in 1984, after his own daughter landed<br/>
on the painful end of a paddle, five states had adopted bans. The 27th, West<br/>
Virginia, acted in 1994, following states that also include New York and<br/>
Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
The number of paddlings around the country, the Education Department figures<br/>
show, dropped from 1.4 million in the 1979-80 school year to 613,000 in<br/>
1989-90 to 470,000 in 1993-94. In many states that allow corporal<br/>
punishment, individual districts ban it, and in most schools that allow it<br/>
parents can sign a form exempting their children. Black students are 2.5<br/>
times as likely to be struck as white students, a reflection of what<br/>
researchers have long found to be more frequent and harsher discipline for<br/>
members of minorities.<br/>
<br/>
Court challenges have been largely unsuccessful, given a 1977 decision by<br/>
the Supreme Court rejecting the notion that paddling is cruel and unusual<br/>
punishment. A decade later, a federal appeals court ruled that a New Mexico<br/>
girl held upside down and beaten had been denied due process, signaling that<br/>
school officials could be held liable for severe beatings. But similar<br/>
findings have been rare.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The vast preponderance of the lawsuits challenging the use of corporal<br/>
punishment in individual instances are unsuccessful,&quot; said Charles Vergon, a<br/>
professor at Youngstown State University in Ohio who has studied the issue<br/>
for 15 years.<br/>
<br/>
Families tend to win such cases, Professor Vergon said, only when educators<br/>
have &quot;abused in a fairly significant way the public&#39;s trust.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The federal liability-protection legislation mimicks statutes in nine states<br/>
where paddling is popular, including Louisiana. Scott McLellan, a White<br/>
House spokesman, said the measure would head off frivolous lawsuits against<br/>
educators and cited a survey showing that 31 percent of high school<br/>
principals were involved in litigation last year, up from 9 percent a decade<br/>
earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Many education and medical groups oppose corporal punishment, saying it<br/>
aggravates aggression and can cause depression.<br/>
<br/>
But Robert Surgenor, a detective in Berea, Ohio, who wrote a recent book on<br/>
corporal punishment, said &quot;pain is probably the most effective form of<br/>
discipline.&quot; Over 14 years, Detective Surgenor said, he investigated more<br/>
than 150 cases of children who had assaulted their parents and found that<br/>
fewer than 2 percent had been subjected to corporal punishment, a much<br/>
smaller proportion than in the community as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
Emily Williams, a kindergarten teacher in rural Mississippi, said that when<br/>
she arrived from Williams College last year, she was horrified to hear<br/>
teachers striking students in the hallways, the classroom and the cafeteria.<br/>
But by March, frustrated by her own inability to control her class, she had<br/>
picked up the paddle herself.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s so easy to say that&#39;s crazy or that&#39;s brutal or unnecessary or savage,<br/>
but it&#39;s part of the whole system,&quot; Ms. Williams said. &quot;A lot of things are<br/>
different down here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Robert Cahanin and his wife, Chenette, never complained when their older<br/>
child, Matthew, got a few swats for leaving his seat or ignoring directions.<br/>
But it was different when Mrs. Cahanin picked up Megan, who weighed 68<br/>
pounds, from school that day last December. Megan started to cry. Then she<br/>
showed the bruises.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She had to give me a reason why she hit Megan that hard,&quot; Mrs. Cahanin said<br/>
of the principal, Judy Rials, who had administered the customary three<br/>
licks. &quot;If I had done that to Megan, I would be consulting an attorney to<br/>
get me out of jail.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When she heard of the Cahanins&#39; complaints, Joy Ebarb, DeWayne&#39;s mother,<br/>
began to question the repeated paddling of her son, who takes Ritalin for<br/>
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. DeWayne says the paddling does not<br/>
hurt. But his mother says he has started to flinch when she reaches to hug<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
At school, Mrs. Rials keeps the Ten Commandments posted behind her desk,<br/>
along with the aphorisms &quot;When we tolerate everything . . . we stand for<br/>
nothing,&quot; and &quot;That which doesn&#39;t kill you will make you stronger.&quot; The<br/>
teachers have 3-by-9- inch paddles, most made by students in wood shop; Mrs.<br/>
Rials&#39;s, about six inches longer, was taken by the district attorney&#39;s<br/>
office, which cleared her after an investigation into the paddling of Megan.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not our favorite part of the day,&quot; Mrs. Rials said of paddling, which<br/>
she has done hundreds of times in four years as principal. But it is better<br/>
than suspension, she said, particularly for fourth graders, who must pass a<br/>
state test to be promoted. &quot;You can&#39;t educate a child if they&#39;re not in the<br/>
classroom,&quot; she said. &quot;Keeping children from the classroom could be<br/>
devastating. It could change their lives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since her paddling, Megan Cahanin has started biting her nails and, most<br/>
mornings, tries to avoid going to school, her parents say.<br/>
<br/>
The Cahanin and Ebarb lawsuits, against the school district and Mrs. Rials,<br/>
argue that corporal punishment violates the guarantee of equal protection,<br/>
since it is illegal for those in authority to hit prisoners, nursing home<br/>
residents or children in foster care.<br/>
<br/>
The question has generated scores of messages on a community forum on the<br/>
Internet, and gossip around town. Some accuse Megan&#39;s parents of beating her<br/>
themselves, or blame them for showing the snapshots around. Others suggest<br/>
that the whole school district, the entire town hierarchy, is corrupt.<br/>
People quote religious maxims, and talk about when they were coming up.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Lord said, Spare the rod, spoil the child, and I think he knows a lot<br/>
more than those bleeding-heart liberals,&quot; Pat Ebarb (no relation to<br/>
DeWayne), the police chief in nearby Noble, said over coffee and cigarettes<br/>
at Bill & Sissy&#39;s Cafe. &quot;A child needs discipline. I don&#39;t believe they<br/>
ought to be abused or mistreated, but if they need their behind dusted, let<br/>
them get it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tears come whenever Mrs. Cahanin takes out those pictures of her daughter&#39;s<br/>
bruised buttocks. With sorrow, she recalls a moment months before when Megan<br/>
was playing school in her room, swinging a fly-swatter at her dolls&#39;<br/>
backsides, and wishes she had signed a paper that would have prohibited<br/>
paddling her daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Megan, sitting on her parents&#39; back porch watching a downpour hit Toledo<br/>
Bend Lake, said, &quot;You try to forget about it, but sometimes you just can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s so painful seeing that lady every day,&quot; she said. &quot;Whenever I see a<br/>
paddle, I just move away.&quot;<br/>

This story makes me ill. My parents live very near Zwolle in <br/>
Hornbeck.  In our private email I didn&#39;t realize you were in <br/>
Louisiana. That&#39;s where I&#39;m from (until 3 months ago).  I deleted <br/>
your address or I would have written this privately. Would you email <br/>
me again and let me know where you are?<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
<br/>
I certainly wish I knew how to get someone&#39;s email address from here <br/>
without asking.  <br/>
