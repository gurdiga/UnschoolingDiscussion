<div id="ygrps-yiv-326275453">Have any of you read the book The Game of God?<br/>
It has a real interesting take on a &quot;God&quot; who is involved in our <br/>
world as an underlying creative force. <br/>
I recommend it for those who like to question as I do. <br/>
And I can&#39;t help but add...would you punish your grandkids for <br/>
something that your kids did (re reference to childbirth pain <br/>
death/etc for the Garden of Eden sin).  Not the kind of behavior I <br/>
want to emulate.  What about you?<br/>
