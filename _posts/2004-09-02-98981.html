<div id="ygrps-yiv-898311504">From Laura Derrick of The National Home Education Network:<br/>
<br/>
NHEN has received a request for assistance with finding a high school<br/>
aged homeschooler and parent in the New York metro area willing to be<br/>
interviewed for Teen Kids News. Any of the boroughs, or nearby in NJ is<br/>
fine, but the crew is limited in how far they can travel, so close in<br/>
is best, if possible. If you are interested, or if you know someone who<br/>
might be, please contact me ASAP so that I can put you in touch with<br/>
the producers of Teen Kids News. Also, please feel free to forward this<br/>
message to any appropriate state or local email lists/groups so that<br/>
other interested homeschoolers might have a chance to respond. This<br/>
looks like it could be a lot of fun for a homeschooled teen!<br/>

  From Teen Kids:<br/>
I’m writing from Teen Kids News. Teen Kids News can be seen weekly on<br/>
over 200 stations nationwide. Our on-camera anchors and reporters are a<br/>
diverse team of tween and teen journalists reporting from a<br/>
professional news set. The aim of Teen Kids News is to deliver the news<br/>
in a kid friendly voice, explaining stories without talking down to our<br/>
audience.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking to present a story about the Home Schooling. We are<br/>
looking to interview a parent who is a home schooler and home school<br/>
activist as well as his or her child about Home School. We are looking<br/>
for a well spoken high school aged child. We want our audience to learn<br/>
more about what Home School is, and what it is like to be home<br/>
schooled.<br/>
<br/>
We would like to shoot this story sometime in September. We are able to<br/>
do this interview in the New York Metro area only, and would ask for 45<br/>
minutes to set up, an hour of interview time for each the parent and<br/>
child and additional time for B-roll. We would send a three person<br/>
crew—producer, camera and audio. Our audience is 12-18 year old kids.</div>
