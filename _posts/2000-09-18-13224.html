<div id="ygrps-yiv-421674743">Well, we are on the coast.  You can see the Pacific Ocean from my upstairs<br/>
window.  Almost everyone knows everyone else or is someone&#39;s cousin and the<br/>
population number has been static since the 60s, so there is a real small<br/>
town feel to it.  There are about 130,000 in this county which encompasses<br/>
2.3 million acres which is about the size of 2 Delewares, 1 Rhode Island and<br/>
the District of Columbia combined, if I remember my land masses correctly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559016761">Our experience was when we went to pick up two yearling Arab fillies and<br/>
were coming back over the pass.  I know it is only about 10,000 feet at the<br/>
summit but I&#39;m sure it is really 10 MILLION feet down &lt;g&gt;  For those that<br/>
have never been there, you come up and then it is like someone cut the top<br/>
off and the road is instantly flat so you don&#39;t really see what might be in<br/>
front of you.  There was a gal parked right smack dab in the middle of the<br/>
road standing by her car.  We had three choices, hit her, the 10 million<br/>
feet down the cliff face or putting the truck into the snow bank on the up<br/>
side cliff face.  My sister and I were in a panic because the last vehicle<br/>
we passed was a big rig pulling half a modular home.  All we could picture<br/>
was horses plastered all over the road.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, we got the fillies out and up the hill and tied to a couple of<br/>
trees. Then we went to deal with the one taco short of a combination plate!<br/>
Seems she had never driven in the snow before and the black ice scared her.<br/>
O.K., I can deal with that EXCEPT her husband was asleep in the back seat<br/>
and she didn&#39;t want to wake him up because he really needed the sleep!<br/>
Don&#39;t know who was more peeved at her, us or him.  When he asked her why she<br/>
didn&#39;t wake him up (not in those words &lt;g&gt;), she said &quot;But you look so sweet<br/>
and peaceful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Grrrr, did I mention one guy had already gone off the road?  We luckily had<br/>
a winch on the truck to pull him back up the hill!  Oh, and the truck with<br/>
the modular had pulled off so the driver could take 10.<br/>
