<div id="ygrps-yiv-838326253"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;It&#39;s easier to start unschooling before the mom really fully understands<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
if possible, because the kids will show her that it works when they&#39;re given<br/>
an open, honest chance to do so.  The mom&#39;s fears and worries remain for a<br/>
while, but will gradually be replaced with the confidence and first hand<br/>
knowledge that one thing leads to another and that trust is rewarded.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very, very true!  I never thought I&#39;d be a homeschooler or a non-put your<br/>
kid in daycare mom......until I had my daughter.  Instantly, it became,<br/>
&quot;THEY can&#39;t have MY kid!!&quot;  And I began researching (SIL homeschools, first<br/>
school at home, then more relaxed, but NOT an unschooler) and I kept reading<br/>
and reading until I discovered unschooling and thought, wow, cool.  I kept<br/>
reading, and she kept growing, and here we are, just about 7 years later and<br/>
it IS working (despite a few niggling doubts in the past).  Of course, my<br/>
family is after me because her handwriting is atrocious, she&#39;s not reading<br/>
novels yet, and they keep pestering me about what &quot;methods&quot; I&#39;m using and<br/>
what &quot;reading series&quot; I&#39;m using, etc.  But it&#39;s working.<br/>
