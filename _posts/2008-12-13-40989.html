<div id="ygrps-yiv-411924833">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading this list for a while, and this is my first post. I appreciate the candor and thoughtfulness on this board.<br/>
<br/>
I have two boys, ages 6 and 3. As the holidays approach, the issue of &quot;what to do with all the toys&quot; comes to the forefront for me. The boys get a lot of presents this time of year; we have a couple different toy storage systems set up in our living room area, the playroom, their bedroom, as well as the attic. We also have a few &#39;overflow&#39; boxes of toys for doodads. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, at any given moment, a completely broken toy can become the &quot;it&quot; toy for the moment, at the center of all their imaginitive, creative play.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering how people deal with this in a way that is respectful to children, yet still honors the space we live in. In a nutshell, we need to have a way to get some toys out of the house - be it by selling them, giving them away, or tossing them in the trash.  <br/>
<br/>
My personal issue with this is that I have a strong tendency to save things that are &#39;useful&#39; or &#39;good,&#39; even if the logical side of my brain says, &quot;It&#39;s better if we get rid of it.&quot;   So, if I were to sit down with the boys and go through all the toys to decide which ones to give away, throw away, sell and keep, I can pretty much guarantee it would be **very** stressful for me, and thus, would be stressful for them as well. <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate a cut-and-dried, step-by-step, how-to on how some of you have successfully dealt with this, if there is such a thing -- probably coming from someone who is not a &quot;keep it all&quot;-er  *or*  has overcome his/her hoarding tendencies, LOL!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>

Selling is stressful because you end up practically giving things  <br/>
away anyway, so maybe giving away is better from the beginning, if  <br/>
your kids aren&#39;t interested in getting rid of things.<br/>
<br/>
Our method has pretty much been packing and stacking.  When Kirby  <br/>
moved out and didn&#39;t take a lot of packed-and-stacked, that was fine  <br/>
because we had told him he could move back.  When we went through his  <br/>
stuff a year later, after he decided he really wasn&#39;t going to move  <br/>
back, that was kind of stressful for me too.  I don&#39;t know a way out  <br/>
of that.    I still have a lot of Kirby&#39;s stuff, moved to another  <br/>
room.  I figure someday when he gets a house I can press him to get  <br/>
his stuff, and he will only really want some of it, but it will be  <br/>
his decision then.<br/>
<br/>
The stories of mothers throwing away baseball cards and comic books  <br/>
and classic dolls and Beatles stuff are endless, and I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
join that.   We don&#39;t know what of the Ninja Turtle and Pokemon and  <br/>
Mario stuff will be considered classic.<br/>

I don&#39;t have your answer, but I have data and reminders.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144877279">In the very religious home I grew up in it was bad to value stuff and not<br/>
amazingly it was tossed without admission or apology.  I&#39;m not happy about<br/>
the dishonesty that I don&#39;t want to repeat, so I definitely err on the<br/>
keeping side especially since Karl really thinks a lot of his things.  I<br/>
have asked in the past about donating and the stress around that question<br/>
let me know to keep rather than get rid of, though I would love to clear up<br/>
the space.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029261077">Some ideas for changing attitude about &quot;things&quot; - use different self- <br/>
talk:<br/>
  &quot;Let&#39;s put this up out of the way so we can get it back out again  <br/>
later and it&#39;ll be new and fun.&quot;<br/>
&quot;We aren&#39;t enjoying this nearly as much as another child would enjoy  <br/>
it, so let&#39;s give it to a thrift store.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We seldom throw anything away - we either pack it up and put it out of  <br/>
the way, for a while, or give it away to Goodwill or other local  <br/>
thrift stores.  I don&#39;t find it too difficult to give things away  <br/>
because I consciously imagine a thrilled little child finding it as a  <br/>
thrift store treasure!<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah, we packed and stacked a lot of stuff over the years and  <br/>
much of it was brought out later, at different ages, and put to good  <br/>
use. I don&#39;t do that so much, these days, because it isn&#39;t so likely  <br/>
the kids are going to want to revisit old toys --- although I&#39;m now  <br/>
becoming conscious of what I want to have around the house when I have  <br/>
grandchildren!<br/>
<br/>
My mom had the best grandma house any grandchild could want - a closet  <br/>
filled to overflowing with toys, games, puzzles, art supplies.  <br/>
Videogame console and games. VCR with lots of kids videos. CD player  <br/>
with lots of kid-friendly music. Kid-favorite frozen foods always  <br/>
available. Cocoa and cookies. An &quot;office supply&quot; drawer that they were  <br/>
invited to use anytime they wanted - post-it notes, hole punches,  <br/>
tape, lots of kinds of paper, markers, colored pencils, scissors, and  <br/>
so on. And she had a HUGE collection of children&#39;s books. For a long  <br/>
time she had a duck with a little swimming pool - the duck laid eggs  <br/>
and the kids would go find a duck egg and my mom would make them an  <br/>
omelet. She had a veggie garden and lots of miniature fruit trees. She  <br/>
had photo albums of family pictures that were on a shelf under her  <br/>
coffee table - the kids loved to look at the old family photos. She&#39;d  <br/>
always have things &quot;sitting out&quot; that her grandkids might enjoy - a  <br/>
peacock feather, a set of nesting dolls, little figurines that they  <br/>
could play with, a little bowl containing foreign coins, a box of  <br/>
pretty rocks. And, she had a fantastic collection of children&#39;s books  <br/>
- when my mom died, my sisters and I divided up the books between us  <br/>
and even just a third of her children&#39;s books is a great collection.  <br/>
She loved beautiful picture books, especially.<br/>
<br/>
Some people like spacious, clutter-free living spaces. I like to visit  <br/>
those people!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807610450">I and my boys have loved hanging on to things ,so I can <br/>
relate.  What&#39;s worked for us is the attic plus time.<br/>
<br/>
When things got too crowded, I packed some things away, things they <br/>
weren&#39;t using regularly, and put them in the attic, letting them know <br/>
we could always get it down if they wanted something.  When they were <br/>
the ages your kids were, I usually checked with them first.  Any <br/>
storage area would work, under the house, garage, shed.  (In most <br/>
areas, you can have a good weatherproof shed built in your yard for <br/>
less than $2000 - way cheaper than moving or adding on.  The one in <br/>
our area is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shedshop.com/)">http://www.shedshop.com/)</a><br/>
<br/>
For a number of years, it seemed our attic got fuller and fuller, to <br/>
the point of being a little scary!  My boys are five years apart in <br/>
age, so we had to keep things for a long time!  Then, as they got <br/>
older, they were gradually willing to part with some things.  At <br/>
first they preferred  either to give things to a younger child we <br/>
knew or to sell them at the toy consignment shop and they got the <br/>
money.  Now, bit by bit, the attic is emptying out.  Some toys we all <br/>
want to save for the next generation, but even some well loved things <br/>
are leaving us.  The kids are fine with it.  It&#39;s my sentimental soul <br/>
that has a hard time now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736359578">On the three or four occasions that Jayn has been ready to part with a toy, <br/>
we have either taken it to the Goodwill at once, or given it to a friend. <br/>
There have been a couple of times when Jayn has been unsure about it, but we <br/>
have needed space (these were really big items like a giant stuffed swan) so <br/>
we put it into our storage facility which also holds all the furniture that <br/>
we have inherited. This &quot;gone but not&quot; has been a good solution for now. <br/>
Eventually when we have more space she can make a choice about permanence - <br/>
so our solution is the procrastination method! :) Other than that, it has <br/>
been important to Jayn to keep almost everything, so I guess we can&#39;t help <br/>
you. She intends to have a toy and doll museum when she is grown, and wants <br/>
to have a playroom for kids to enjoy there as well as displays.<br/>
<br/>
We have tried keeping things in boxes for a yard sale, but that has yet to <br/>
occur.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935450750">Something that&#39;s worked for us has been to carefully pack away a whole  <br/>
bunch of items in big (usually clear) plastic bins and put them in the  <br/>
attic or garage.  The child decides which stuffed animals, for  <br/>
example, she wants out at present.  Right now it&#39;s Old timey ones  <br/>
(like the classic Pooh&#39;s and knitted ones) and penguins.  The rest go  <br/>
in the bin and if she wants one of them to play with it&#39;s not a big  <br/>
deal to go get it.  The bin is clear so we can usually find the one  <br/>
she wants without taking it all out.<br/>
<br/>
Once the room is cleared of things the joy of having a clear space  <br/>
really sets in, without the fear or sadness of giving up her favorite  <br/>
things.  Often now, she will get rid of things but she still tends to  <br/>
want to keep most of it.  Obviously my daughter is involved in the  <br/>
process so I don&#39;t put away stuff she is using or really wants to keep  <br/>
out but I do most of the heavy lifting and sometimes she preferrs to  <br/>
let me do it while she watches TV or plays on the computer.  Once it&#39;s  <br/>
clean and looking nice, she likes it so much that she keeps it clean  <br/>
herself most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
13yo dd has a ladder to a little attic space in her closet but she  <br/>
likes to give stuff away and get rid of stuff to make room for new.    <br/>
15yo ds likes to keep most things and so we&#39;ve given him shelves and  <br/>
storage space in his closet.   8yo dd uses her closet, the garage and  <br/>
the attic  for storage and she also likes to have certain things in  <br/>
the living room and dining room.    She prefers to have some open  <br/>
space in her room to play in so the compromise of putting it away in  <br/>
bins works really well for her.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve already been clearing shelves to make room for holiday  <br/>
decorations and I figure when those get put away there will be an  <br/>
automatic space for whatever new toys they get for Christmas.<br/>

I have a terrible paper-work fetish and would keep every little scrap that<br/>
my kids draw a happy face on and give to me.  It&#39;s much easier for me to<br/>
purge some of these items when I take a picture of if first.  We even take<br/>
pictures of dd&#39;s drawings on her dry erase board if she particularly likes<br/>
it.  She likes seeing the pictures posted and it seems to virtually elimiate<br/>
any stress she felt about erasing a drawing or tossing away items once she<br/>
sees them on our flickr page.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684040126">Taking pictures of Lego creations really saved our son&#39;s sanity - and thus ours ;)  He&#39;d work hours, days, weeks on a creation.  Going back to make revisions many times, then not want to take the final version apart.  He&#39;d set them on display throughout the house.    By doing this he&#39;d run out of Lego&#39;s and could not continue creating.  He had many moments of frustration and angst until we hit upon the idea of taking pictures.  He still lets many creations sit but when he is ready to disassemble it seems to come easier for him since we started taking pictures.  This was several years ago - he is 14 now and we still have Lego creations on display - some newly created and some have been around a while.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done this for art projects too - well lots of creations around here.  He had a bug collection and when it started to crumble we took a picture relieving some of his stress of it falling apart.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have three children (11, 8, 3).  When I notice something hasn&#39;t <br/>
been played with in a while, we pass it down to the next younger <br/>
child.  The imaginext pirate set I bought for my 11yo years ago <br/>
recently got passed from my 8yo to my 3yo.  My 8yo still occasionally <br/>
goes in his sister&#39;s room to play with the pirates, so it&#39;s kind of a <br/>
win-win situation for everyone.  When my 3yo outgrows her toys, she <br/>
passes them to her younger cousins.  Keep in mind, this is not <br/>
something I do to them.  They are full participants in this hand-me-<br/>
down toy process.  They much prefer giving their toys to someone they <br/>
know rather than to some strangers.<br/>
<br/>
I also know there a quite a few toys that we will keep indefinately.  <br/>
My mother kept a lot of my toys when I outgrew them, and now my <br/>
daughter gets a lot of joy out of my old Stawberry Shortcake dolls.  <br/>
I still remember my 11yo (when he was 2) frantically searching for <br/>
his &quot;dreen moop&quot; which just happened the be the green mop I got for <br/>
Christmas as a child.  Recently my family enjoyed a game of bingo <br/>
using my childhood bingo set.<br/>
<br/>
I have also packed toys in huge plastic totes and put them in the <br/>
attic because we just didn&#39;t have the space for them in the house.  I <br/>
get them out periodically and we go through them.  The kids decide <br/>
what to get rid of, what to take out and put in their rooms, what to <br/>
leave in the tote, and what to remove from their room and place in <br/>
the tote. <br/>
<br/>
I guess the key to getting rid of toys in our house is a gradual <br/>
letting go.  Also, it might be my suggestion, but it is always their <br/>
decision.  It might also help that they see me drop a lot of my own <br/>
stuff at Goodwill on a fairly regular basis (I used to be a packrat).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683431113">Thanks - I appreciate all the ideas and thoughts on this from everyone. It&#39;s been very helpful. I&#39;m going to make our attic a better toy storage area (it already somewhat is) and keep things flowing in and out of there, and involve the kids in the process, taking little steps rather than worrying about needing to get rid of X number of toys or something, to make way for new.<br/>
 <br/>
The boys do like sharing with friends and will also give them toys sometimes, too. (Course, that makes us the recipients as well, on occasion!)  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been taking pictures of kids&#39; artwork, or scanning them in, and then recycling the originals or mailing them to relatives/friends. A few I do keep, because they are just soooo special to me!<br/>
 <br/>
I also think this is fantastic:<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It might also help that they see me drop a lot of my own &gt; stuff at Goodwill on a fairly regular basis (I used to be a packrat).<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>The pack rat in me doesn&#39;t want to hold on to things that don&#39;t reflect the best of who I am, or that have no historical/familial value - and so I *want* to let go of things and still feel good about myself, and not regretful. This would be a good exercise for me and the kids. <br/>
 <br/>
Much appreciated on all accounts,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085049592">And of course the easiest things to let go of are the things you got<br/>
thinking they&#39;d be something you like only to find that they&#39;re not what you<br/>
like.  I&#39;ve gotten a couple of toys and video games like that for Karl,<br/>
which on 2nd look (out of the bag at home) he didn&#39;t like after all.  Not<br/>
hard for me to part with.  If it&#39;s brand new, I can return it or sell it<br/>
online or some such thing.<br/>
<br/>
Relatively speaking, everything is like that to some degree, eventually.<br/>
It&#39;s less easy to get rid of something if you still see value in it, and<br/>
very hard to if you see a lot of value in it.<br/>

Something can seem perfectly useless and still be of some value, sentimental<br/>
or otherwise.  I have a lot of that kind of thing.  Most of those things<br/>
lessen in value as time goes by.  I periodically go thru and find that many<br/>
things perplex me.  Why did I keep them in the first place?  I might not<br/>
remember any more (so they&#39;re no longer likely to be very valuable).<br/>
Naturally some things only get more precious to me the longer I have them; a<br/>
personal collection or a journal or pictures.<br/>
<br/>
That has me thinking I should go through my stuff more often, and then I<br/>
would probably find a lot that I could move out of my house much sooner.  As<br/>
opposed to letting it sit for ages like I usually do.  :)<br/>

the way&quot; when we&#39;re going out. I keep a basket in the entryway that  <br/>
almost always has something in it that someone wants to donate -  <br/>
mostly clothing in our house, but also the occasional kitchen gadget  <br/>
that seemed like a good idea at the time &lt;g&gt; or puzzles that we&#39;ve  <br/>
already done or games that nobody really likes much (we have a LOT of  <br/>
games, I weed through them the way other people might clean out the  <br/>
refrigerator). When there are a handful of things in the basket, we  <br/>
stop by and drop them off - every few weeks, usually.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113906031">Oh I have a hard time getting rid of most things too! I am getting better<br/>
over the years, but at this moment I desperately need to purge. <br/>
 <br/>
One advantage I have is that I organize a children&#39;s consignment sale twice<br/>
a year, so to set a good example and follow my own advice, periodically I<br/>
force myself to get rid of things my son has outgrown! The idea is that<br/>
parents gather up stuff their kids have gently used, prep it so it looks<br/>
nice, clean toys and hang clothes on hangers, and bring it all down to one<br/>
location where we open to the public for 3 days and then it&#39;s over. I need<br/>
to write a newsletter real soon here and want to include some advice on<br/>
boxing things up to get ready for the spring sale while we all get ready for<br/>
the influx of xmas toys!<br/>
 <br/>
(I&#39;m not trying to advertise, heck you&#39;d have to live in Portland or close<br/>
by to participate in my sale! But if you want to know more about what it is,<br/>
here&#39;s my web site: www.passitonsales.com And I&#39;m involved in a support<br/>
group with other sale owners so depending on where you live I might be able<br/>
to refer you to a similar sale.)<br/>
 <br/>
Clothing is fairly easy to let go, except I do have some baby clothes (I say<br/>
in case i have another but I know how easy it is to get more clothes, so it<br/>
must be sentimental), and I&#39;ve gotten rid of all the big stuff as soon as we<br/>
stopped using it (swing, high chair, stroller) but it&#39;s still really hard to<br/>
sell the toys. Even if Damon doesn&#39;t play with everything, I see the value<br/>
in it and want to keep it around &quot;in case&quot; we need it some day. We&#39;re trying<br/>
to redo the basement to organize all the toys because I only see more<br/>
purchases in the future. In the meantime, there are toys everywhere, all<br/>
over the house. It doesn&#39;t bother me, but Geoff (dh) doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course I can&#39;t resist shopping at my own sale, and thus bringing in MORE<br/>
toys! I&#39;ve had people over who say Damon has too many toys. I wonder what<br/>
that means. He does use them all, sometimes together (block towers that cars<br/>
crash into or towns constructed of all sorts of materials). And does it<br/>
matter that most of them were used before we got them and I paid very little<br/>
for the lot? And why do I care what other people say?! When we go to other<br/>
houses, it seems those kids have a lot of toys too. It&#39;s not a competiton, I<br/>
just have a hard time getting rid of stuff. <br/>
 <br/>
I was at someone&#39;s house last week (not a friend, just picking something up)<br/>
who was very proud of the fact that she had very little toys for her 2.5yo<br/>
dd. I looked around at her immaculately clean house and felt so sorry for<br/>
her kid! She said they&#39;d rather spend money on a zoo menbership or science<br/>
museum and go to the library for books. We go to the library too, but we<br/>
also won a ton of books! Some things I just want to grab and read when I<br/>
want to, not have to wait until the library is open and hope they have it.<br/>
We have the memberships too, I just don&#39;t get not having toys in your house!<br/>

Thanks - I appreciate all the ideas and thoughts on this from everyone. It&#39;s<br/>
been very helpful. I&#39;m going to make our attic a better toy storage area (it<br/>
already somewhat is) and keep things flowing in and out of there, and<br/>
involve the kids in the process, taking little steps rather than worrying<br/>
about needing to get rid of X number of toys or something, to make way for<br/>
new.<br/>
<br/>
The boys do like sharing with friends and will also give them toys<br/>
sometimes, too. (Course, that makes us the recipients as well, on occasion!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been taking pictures of kids&#39; artwork, or scanning them in, and then<br/>
recycling the originals or mailing them to relatives/friends. A few I do<br/>
keep, because they are just soooo special to me!<br/>
<br/>
I also think this is fantastic:<br/>

<br/>
The pack rat in me doesn&#39;t want to hold on to things that don&#39;t reflect the<br/>
best of who I am, or that have no historical/familial value - and so I<br/>
*want* to let go of things and still feel good about myself, and not<br/>
regretful. This would be a good exercise for me and the kids. <br/>
<br/>
Much appreciated on all accounts,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My sister in law was like that with her house.  Her kids are 16 and 14<br/>
now.  When they were little though, they routinely had garage sales<br/>
where the kids would get rid of almost every toy item they owned.  When<br/>
they came to our house, they went hog wild and played and played and<br/>
played.  Twice their whole family moved out of state and got rid of<br/>
almost EVERYthing, tv&#39;s, gaming systems, everything except basic living<br/>
essentials.  They never had books really.  They had one tiny bookcase<br/>
when the kids were really little that was about 2 feet wide and had 2<br/>
shelves on it.  One quarter of it had children&#39;s books and the rest was<br/>
cutesy stuff.  That went bye bye when the kids went to school because<br/>
they were officially too old for picture books and they could get books<br/>
from school.<br/>
<br/>
Something that I&#39;ve noticed about kids that go to school, is that they<br/>
outgrow toys and move through them really fast, like fads.  Perhaps it&#39;s<br/>
because they don&#39;t play with them all day and grow attatched to them. <br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s peer pressure, stuff like playing with baby dolls is for<br/>
babies, even at the young age of 7 and 8.  The neighbor girl just got<br/>
rid of ALL of her barbies and bratz, she was still 7 when she did that,<br/>
and she told Margaux that she&#39;s too old for them now.  I know kids<br/>
change and outgrow things, but I remember playing with dolls and barbies<br/>
until I was about 12.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille always valued her toys and kept them around for a long time and<br/>
a lot of her friends have been secretly jealous of it, largely because<br/>
they HAD to get rid of all their toys that their parents decided they&#39;d<br/>
outgrown.  When they visited they always went straight to the toys and<br/>
such that they themselves had gotten rid of.  Our house has always been<br/>
a source of imagination play and fun because there are actually things<br/>
to play with!<br/>
<br/>
Our house is small, so we do go through stuff and get rid of stuff. <br/>
Anyone who&#39;s ever visited could tell you, though, that we have an<br/>
enormous amount of toys!</div>
