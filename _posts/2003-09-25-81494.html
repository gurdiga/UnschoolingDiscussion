<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971127768">My 9 yo son reads a little but not what most people expect of a 9 yo.  I&#39;m <br/>
wondering if those of you with &quot;late&quot; readers have ever &quot;prepared&quot; adults who <br/>
work with your kids.  How have you let them know not to expect reading and <br/>
writing and helped them to deal with your child sensitively?  Words, I&#39;m looking <br/>
for words to use.  My son is about to start a junior naturalist program that I <br/>
think is likely to become  very important to him. It&#39; a morning a week and <br/>
involves overnights with the same tight knit group of people for years to come.  <br/>
It&#39;s more time away from us than he&#39;s spent with non-homeschoolers so far.  (My <br/>
baby......waaa!)   I doubt there&#39;s much reading and writing involved, but I <br/>
worry about how he&#39;ll handle it if there is any and especially about reactions <br/>
from other kids.  So it occurs to me to say _something_ to the rangers in <br/>
charge but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea and if it is, I&#39;m not sure what to say.  <br/>
Any thoughts appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son wasn&#39;t really reading when he started scouts at 11.  It happened that<br/>
the scout master was a friend, and we spoke to him about it.  (In scouts<br/>
they start expecting the kids to copy stuff off the board into their books,<br/>
etc.)  He was fine with it and mentioned that he gets a fair number of<br/>
school kids who have trouble.  I would let the rangers know that there&#39;s a<br/>
problem with reading and writing.  They&#39;ll likely chalk it up to learning<br/>
disability, and I don&#39;t think it would hurt to let them think that in this<br/>
case.  They might be more sensitive to his feelings about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473126348">Hi Pam<br/>
<br/>
This is right up my alley. My katie is nine and ONLY THIS YEAR started<br/>
getting interested in reading. So far, she has explained herself, with<br/>
a little sigh of regret &quot;Sigh...I&#39;m not reading yet&quot; ...  I think that<br/>
little &quot;regret&quot; thing might be a reflection of my own worry about it.<br/>
I&#39;ve tried, but man, it&#39;s tough. <br/>
<br/>
anyway. Ask your boy if he would like to explain, or would he rather<br/>
you did? And if you are the one...Maybe it would be best not to<br/>
&quot;prepare&quot; the instructors with him present? Their reaction could give<br/>
him a negative  concept of his &quot;late starting reader&quot; status. <br/>
<br/>
As for words...I dunno. Katie has always just handled it her own self,<br/>
in Sunday school and other places where a child is expected to be<br/>
fluent by age 7 (arggghhhhh)<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

I wrote a letter to the acting school Holly was going to for a while and said <br/>
she wasn&#39;t reading yet, and so please not to put her on the spot in class.  I <br/>
enclosed some information on unschooling and the web addresses of <br/>
unschooling.com and my page.  I figured if they DID look they would understand, and if <br/>
they didn&#39;t bother to look, they would have homework to do if they DID question <br/>
the situation.  Easy to say &quot;Didn&#39;t you even read what I sent?<br/>
<br/>
And now I remember there was such a moment.  She got a new teacher who said <br/>
in front of the others &quot;You have to be able to read to act&quot; or some &quot;have to&quot; <br/>
statement.  Holly wasn&#39;t too hurt by it, because she/Holly said as soon as it <br/>
was spoken she knew they take really little kids in the classes who totally <br/>
can&#39;t read, and being a Shirley Temple fan, she knew Shirley Temple acted before <br/>
she could read, so her thought was &quot;wrong.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I called the school and told them to pass Holly&#39;s file to that teacher before <br/>
the next class, and next time I was in there she came and apologized to me.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was ten and was handed a clipboard to fill out the forms for a <br/>
karate advancement test, I leaned over to write and the sensei said &quot;He has to do <br/>
it himself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Well he can&#39;t do it himself, I&#39;ll help him.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Had he said &quot;NO you CAN&#39;T help him&quot; then I would have said &quot;He can&#39;t do it by <br/>
himself.  Is he doing his karate okay?  You can help him or I can help him, <br/>
but this isnt a writing class, and he&#39;s not writing yet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I did that day was just to keep helping, and the next time I came in I <br/>
brought a copy of the interview Home Education Magazine published of me, and <br/>
said if he wanted to read that he&#39;d get an idea of my homeschooling philosophy <br/>
and how we do things.<br/>
<br/>
I just didn&#39;t give him the idea that he could dictate what Kirby had to do <br/>
outside of karate business.<br/>
<br/>
And as it all turns out, Kirby&#39;s one of the favorites at that school and has <br/>
judged other advancements, with forms, on clipboards, where he has to put his <br/>
comments down pretty quickly.  His writing isn&#39;t standard--it&#39;s tiny, for one <br/>
thing (something school kids don&#39;t do because they get credit for filling up <br/>
pages), and printed, but it&#39;s always legible.<br/>

This made me think of what happened when I attended a school, for<br/>
academically gifted kids in fifth and part of sixth grade (1971-72).<br/>
When we began we had to get ink cartridge pens with special calligraphic<br/>
squared off nibs. We were all taught to write in &quot;italics&quot; (I guess that<br/>
is the calligraphy designation) in ink, rather than ballpoint or any<br/>
felt tip pen, for all of our class work and assignments. After a while<br/>
we were given speed tests, and neatness counted - a type of writing<br/>
seemingly diametrically opposed to writing fast in speed tests that were<br/>
also spelling dictation. I recall being middling at it - my writing was<br/>
never as beautiful or as fast as many others in the class. However to<br/>
this day I am totally mystified as to the purpose of it - other I<br/>
suppose than legibility - but then why the fountain pens? I found out<br/>
later, when some of my former classmates turned up at my high school,<br/>
that in the last term of sixth grade, the entire class was moved on to<br/>
&quot;Chancellery&quot;, a more curvy and leaning version of the other calligraphy<br/>
- which seemed to me to be moving backwards if the purpose was<br/>
legibility. These classes were experiments in &quot;free&quot; learning<br/>
supposedly, but the odd handwriting obsession of the staff was hardly in<br/>
line with that thinking.<br/>
