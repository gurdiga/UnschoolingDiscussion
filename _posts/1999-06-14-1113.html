<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137666949">What most exites me, in the universe of Unschooling ideas, is the thought of<br/>
capturring and capitalizing on &quot;moments,&quot; or &quot;aha&quot; instances. I love<br/>
tangents.<br/>
<br/>
So yesterday I&#39;m clicking away at the computer, IMing with a friend, and my<br/>
3 1/2 yo dd Jordyn sits down to me~asking how to spell &quot;Jackie.&quot; (jackie is<br/>
a friend of my oldest dd&#39;s)<br/>
OK, So I&#39;m clicking and talking to Jordyn, but not even watching what she&#39;s<br/>
doing, until my IM is done and I look over to see that Jordyn has indeed<br/>
written &quot;Jackie,&quot; __really well__. Her C is backwards, and there&#39;s no caps<br/>
or anything--but Gee whiz. I didn&#39;t teach her any of that. None of us did.<br/>
<br/>
For weeks she has been playing with cuisenaire rods, making letters. The<br/>
other day she made some with chinese food packets. Not once has she ever<br/>
been even so much as encouraged in this direction. We&#39;ve just made sure that<br/>
we have materials and activities available in the house (and outside of<br/>
course) to keep her interested.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought it was a good example of the fact that kids are naturally<br/>
curious, and truly &quot;learning all the time.&quot;<br/>

     That is so neat!!  These are the kinds of stories that we need to tell <br/>
each other.  It encourages us to keep on doing things the way we are, and it <br/>
shows us that unschooling really does work!  <br/>
