or all of the time. The point wasn&#39;t that Moms or Dads should be separate <br/>
from their families (although some find some alone time is necessary), but <br/>
that they should also be People, with some of their own interests. It&#39;s fine <br/>
... wonderful, even... if you share those interests with your kids. <br/>
