<div id="ygrps-yiv-989177950">Reasons to worry about a 21 month old who is not talking:<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t react to language when spoken to him, seems oblivious to what <br/>
language is for. Doesn&#39;t attempt to communicate with people in any way. <br/>
Doesn&#39;t make any sounds at all. Making no effort to attempt language.<br/>
<br/>
Since none of those apply to your son, tell the commenters &quot;Thank you for <br/>
your concern&quot; except of course the child&#39;s dad who should be reassured. :)<br/>
