&lt;&lt; Is there a difference between a Radical Unschooler and just an<br/>
Unschooler?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it really depends on the person. What might be radical to some,<br/>
wouldn&#39;t seem so to others. In my local area, I would say I&#39;m radical. Here<br/>
on the list, I can&#39;t say the same thing because so many others seem to<br/>
parent and unschool as we do.<br/>

<br/>
Well.....like most things it depends.  The problem is that some people call<br/>
themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot; but they force the kids to do math, or they<br/>
&quot;unschool&quot; after the kids get out of ps in the afternoons, or they require a<br/>
certain amount of reading each day.  These are people that hard core<br/>
unschoolers would refer to as &quot;eclectic&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschoolers use that title as a way of saying &quot;No really, we are<br/>
committed 100% to unschooling.  My kids are REALLY in charge of their lives,<br/>
etc..&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you heard Eddie Izzard&#39;s routine about &quot;weirdo transvestites&quot;?  He says <br/>
he&#39;s an action transvestite, and an executive transvestite, not a &quot;weirdo <br/>
transvestite.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Outside of discussions of homeschoolers, they&#39;re all homeschoolers.<br/>
To someone in South Africa, Americans are all Americans.<br/>
<br/>
To someone in Mexico or Canada, they probably know and care about the <br/>
differences between Texans and Californians, or New Englanders/Midwesterners/Pacific <br/>
NE folk.   Within a state, people know which regions are likely to be how, or <br/>
will expect what behavior or level of clothing formality, or will have what <br/>
food, and so forth.  In which town in your own state is there most likely to be <br/>
a mosque, or synagogue, or Buddhist center?  Which is likely to have three <br/>
kinds of Pentecostal church?  Where can you buy Moon Pies and pork rinds?  Keifer <br/>
and sprouts?<br/>
<br/>
And so within homeschooling some people have lots of shades of meaning for <br/>
the homeschoolers like themselves and fewer shades for those further away.   I <br/>
don&#39;t personally care much about the difference between ABeka and Sonlight, and <br/>
I&#39;m sure there are differences!  Within those, I bet there are people who <br/>
choose their friends or avoid people based on how they use those, and I bet they <br/>
themselves have terminology for their slackers and too-stricts and just-rights.<br/>
<br/>
In different discussions over the years I&#39;ve seen different distinctions made <br/>
about &quot;radical.&quot;   Sometimes it involves whether there is any instruction.  <br/>
Some people want to teach math facts and reading and other than that they&#39;re <br/>
unschooling.  They&#39;re not radical unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it involves whether there&#39;s any separation of learning and other <br/>
life.  Some want to give their kids uninterrupted learning opportunities and <br/>
time to pursue their interests during &quot;school hours&quot; so that on a school day <br/>
they&#39;re free to do what they want as long as it seems somewhat justifiably <br/>
schoolish.  And they might accept that Lego or sandbox play is schoolish because <br/>
there are math and engineering and physics and nature elements, and they want to <br/>
document some of that.  But they might not want the kids to just sit and look <br/>
out the window, or to read magazines about movie stars, or to play a video game <br/>
during that same time.<br/>
<br/>
If you read that and thought, &quot;Yeah, but looking out the window, playing a <br/>
video game or reading ANY magazine is still learning,&quot; then you&#39;re probably a <br/>
radical unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is another division that considers whether unschooling has so <br/>
transformed the parents or the family that they have blurred the lines between <br/>
learning and any other part of life, and I think that&#39;s the line which causes <br/>
conflict on this list at at the unschooling.com forum sometimes.  It has to do <br/>
with lifestyle other than project/learning/input.  What about bedtimes and food <br/>
and chores and rules of interaction with the world?<br/>
<br/>
Each family has a point which is too far for them.  For me &quot;too far&quot; is when <br/>
a parent comes here and says they don&#39;t think it&#39;s their job to suggest <br/>
anything for their kids to do, ever.  They don&#39;t think it&#39;s their job to comment on <br/>
their children&#39;s interests.  They don&#39;t think it&#39;s unschooling if a parent <br/>
ever directs anything or imposes his or her own interests on the child in any <br/>
way.   See, I think that&#39;s justifying some kind of detached neglect, and I think <br/>
it&#39;s stupid.   Yet there have been very VERY few of those over the years (and <br/>
I think they were bullshitting anyway, or experimenting with a posture they <br/>
didn&#39;t actually hold and would say something different in a week or two).<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s my personal edge-of-the-world.  But I don&#39;t call them more radical <br/>
than I am.  I think they&#39;re just doofi or they&#39;re just saying what they think <br/>
will stir trouble.  (Do you imagine anyone would actually do that?  I didn&#39;t <br/>
think so years ago, but now I&#39;m sure they do because I&#39;ve heard their twisted <br/>
confessions of having disrupted lists and wasted people&#39;s time just for the <br/>
thrill of being irritants.)<br/>
<br/>
So back to the real world as we know it and I would like to try to maintain <br/>
it.  I think if people divide their lives into academic and non-academic, <br/>
they&#39;re not radical unschoolers.  I think unschooling in the context of a <br/>
traditional set of rules and parental requirements and expectations will work better <br/>
than structured school-at-home, but I don&#39;t think it will work as well for the <br/>
developing souls and minds of the children involved.  And those who are not <br/>
radical unschoolers would look at that and say &quot;What do their souls have to do <br/>
with unschooling?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It has to do with philosophy and priority.  I think the way I discuss whether <br/>
one of my teens can go to a movie or not under the circumstances of the <br/>
moment is as true and deep a life-building experience as when he asks me what <br/>
squares and square roots are about.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we had in various combinations and not all at once from seven to <br/>
seventeen kids here.  It was a madhouse.  Seven was my low count because there <br/>
are still seven here at the moment.  At one point two were gone and were coming <br/>
back, one was half-expected (and did show up) and Marty wanted to go to the <br/>
dollar movies to see &quot;School of Rock&quot; with a subset of the day&#39;s count.  Holly <br/>
didn&#39;t want to go; her guest from England did.  Kirby half wanted to go; the <br/>
girls coming back wanted to see him particularly.  So the discussion with Marty <br/>
involved me helping him review the schedule, the logistics of which and how <br/>
many cars, did he have cash, could he ask Kirby to stay, could we offer another <br/>
trip to that theater the next day for those who&#39;d missed it today, etc.    I <br/>
could have said &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; without detail, but it was important to me for <br/>
it to be important to Marty to learn how to make those decisions.   Lots of <br/>
factors.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s part of my personal style of radical unschooling. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve always considered ourselves fairly far out on the radical fringe of<br/>
unschooling, but I&#39;ve been taken to task (by someone on this list) for<br/>
reminding my son to do his Latin. My point was (and still is) that he chose<br/>
to work his way through this book with an online group, and it&#39;s important<br/>
to him to turn in his assignments on time, and if he doesn&#39;t work on the<br/>
assignments throughout the week he tends to have to spend hours the day<br/>
they&#39;re due. He doesn&#39;t like that, and we don&#39;t like having to go over them<br/>
with him late at night before he turns them in. Nonetheless, he&#39;s 11, and<br/>
for a long time he wasn&#39;t going to choose to do Latin when there were<br/>
computer games to be played. So we reminded him. We didn&#39;t say, &quot;Turn off<br/>
that stupid game and do your Latin this instant!&quot; We said, sometimes several<br/>
times a day, &quot;Don&#39;t forget your Latin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;radical unschooler&quot; who saw my post about this on another list said I<br/>
should examine what we were doing to see if there was a better way. She<br/>
implied, quite strongly, that we weren&#39;t unschooling enough, that something<br/>
about the Latin was our problem. But I don&#39;t think helping a child remember<br/>
something he wants to do excludes us from the radical unschooling club.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, now that he&#39;s almost 12, we almost never have to remind him<br/>
about the Latin anymore. He finally matured to the point that he can<br/>
remember on his own. And everyone&#39;s happy.<br/>

If you see it as a club and are concerned about being excluded. . .<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been taken to task (by someone on this list) for<br/>
<br/>
reminding my son to do his Latin. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remind my kids to return their phone calls.  Sometimes they have to pause a <br/>
game to do that.  <br/>
<br/>
I sometimes remind Kirby to set his alarm if he&#39;s going somewhere the next <br/>
day.  (He rarely needs the reminder anymore.)  I remind him to wash his gi or at <br/>
least throw it toward the washing machine.  (Ditto.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;He tends to have to&quot; means he has no choice, though.  He DOES have a choice, <br/>
doesn&#39;t he?  <br/>
<br/>
I reminded my kids to get their Halloween costumes together early.<br/>
When they&#39;re going to a medieval event, I ask them to get all their costume <br/>
parts together a few days before so we know if they need anything repaired, <br/>
made or bought.  <br/>
<br/>
But they could say &quot;I&#39;d rather just not go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who criticized it before, and it could have been me (or one of <br/>
dozens of others who are on more than one list), but maybe it&#39;s because it was <br/>
Latin, which is even more than times tables or reading, the epitome of <br/>
schoolishness.  Maybe it was because of the use of &quot;have to&quot; (whether he has to <br/>
study, or you have to remind him).<br/>
<br/>

so: &quot;We said, sometimes several<br/>

certainly wouldn&#39;t have time for college-level Latin. It&#39;s just like<br/>
unschoolers who teach themselves Klingon or dwarven runes (both of which<br/>
he&#39;s done at various times). We all love language here, like other families<br/>
love music or art or nature.<br/>

reexamine about the Latin, and that was my point before: If he doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to do it, he doesn&#39;t have to. But since he wants to do it, if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to spend four hours on it in one day, he has to spread that out over<br/>
several days. And if he gets so into Deus Ex or Freedom Force that he<br/>
forgets, we have to remind him. There are certain things in life that we all<br/>
&quot;have&quot; to do, for whatever reason.<br/>

<br/>
Nah,,<br/>
<br/>
I think if a parent finds that they are reminding a child to do something<br/>
too much, it might not be that important to the child. Its become the<br/>
parent&#39;s agenda and not the child&#39;s.  There&#39;s such a fine line, and I have<br/>
crossed it before.  ( I&#39;m not saying its not important to him.) But, if he<br/>
is into the Deus Ex or Freedom Force,  that might be a priority to him at<br/>
that time.   I<br/>
<br/>
I think this is similar to practicing an instrument,  I&#39;ve seen it similar,<br/>
anyway.   I have friends who keep reminding their kids about practicing.<br/>
It turns into a stressful thing.    I think the parents have to let it go.<br/>
Yes,  I might mention the instrument,  but its going to be up to them to get<br/>
it done.   If they choose to do something else,  well,, that was more<br/>
important to them then.  They know they won&#39;t have a certain piece down or<br/>
what ever.   They might even go to a lesson unprepared,  its happened.   But<br/>
its up to them.<br/>

That would drive me crazy! &lt;g&gt;  When there are things to be done, I don&#39;t<br/>
want people reminding me to do it.  You and I are obviously different.  When<br/>
I was growing up my mother would always be at me about things.  I think<br/>
that&#39;s why now if someone reminds me about something,  it really hits me<br/>
wrong.  She would never allow me to take on the responsibility as my own.<br/>
<br/>
On this same vein,  I think my children will really be able to differentiate<br/>
or prioritize what is important to them.  I already see them doing this.<br/>
They&#39;ve taken the responsiblity onto themselves.  They know what&#39;s true to<br/>
them and there won&#39;t be the kind-of distractions going on with them like<br/>
there is to me.   They don&#39;t have different thoughts going on in their heads<br/>
like: &quot;Oh, maybe I should be doing this instead of that&quot;.  They&#39;ll know.  I<br/>
am just learning these things now. :)<br/>
<br/>
In leading this unschooling life they are able to develop that sense.   When<br/>
something is important, they do it,  if it isn&#39;t they don&#39;t,  and they don&#39;t<br/>
sit and worry about what isn&#39;t happening--because it isn&#39;t important.<br/>

I have a larger vision of what I want my life to be.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with Alex. He wants to do the Latin, but it&#39;s not foremost in<br/>
his mind most of the time. When a week goes by when I forget to remind him,<br/>
he stays up late on Monday night to get it done. It&#39;s not because I&#39;ve told<br/>
him it has to be done -- it&#39;s because he wants to keep up with the group.<br/>
That makes it important to him, even if at a particular moment it&#39;s not what<br/>
he chooses to do. It takes a lot more focused brainpower than playing<br/>
computer games, so for the same reason I spend way too much time playing<br/>
spider solitaire, he frequently plays games rather than doing anything else.<br/>
And that&#39;s his choice, but it helps him when I remind him that there are<br/>
other things in the world.<br/>

<br/>
Ok, so that&#39;s when it&#39;s important to him.  He does it when he feels the need to get it done.  Until that time other things are important.  <br/>
<br/>
~~It&#39;s not because I&#39;ve told<br/>
him it has to be done -- it&#39;s because he wants to keep up with the group.~~<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and sometimes he is keeping up with the group by staying up late on Monday night.  It&#39;s his choice.  Whether you remind him or not, he&#39;s keeping up with the group because he chooses to.<br/>
<br/>
~~It takes a lot more focused brainpower than playing<br/>
computer games~~<br/>
<br/>
Maybe for him it does, maybe for someone else it would take very little effort.  Some people are naturally inclined to learn something, some people have to work their butts off.  If he chooses to work his butt off, cool!  If he chooses to let it go, cool!  Neither is better when doing something like learning Latin.  <br/>
<br/>
It still &#39;sounds&#39; like it&#39;s more important to you than to your son.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also the type of person that hates to be reminded of something I &#39;should&#39; do.  I&#39;ll do it when I&#39;m ready to do it, until then I&#39;ll do something else.  It&#39;s my time, my life, and my choice.  If it doesn&#39;t get done, oh well, I&#39;m the one that will deal with the consequences, if any.  If I have to be repeatedly reminded to do something, it must not have been as important to me as someone else thinks it should be.<br/>

Yes,  but don&#39;t you want it to be you who decides when to get those things<br/>
done?  I know I take pride in getting things done on my own.  Not when<br/>
someone else says its time or which is important to get done.  Its part of<br/>
allowing a person to learn how to be responsible.  And allowing them to<br/>
figure out what is important to them.<br/>
<br/>

What I meant to go on to say is that &quot;important&quot; means different things in<br/>
different contexts, and implying that I&#39;m pressuring my son to do Latin<br/>
because I think it&#39;s important is missing the point. Yes, the consequences<br/>
are his to deal with, and he has now reached the point where he doesn&#39;t need<br/>
reminders anymore. But letting him stay up till midnight every single Monday<br/>
back when he needed those reminders wouldn&#39;t have been unschooling -- it<br/>
would have been punishing him for being an 11-year-old.<br/>

If he hasn&#39;t asked for the reminders, maybe ask if he wants them. Maybe <br/>

don&#39;t tell him when to do them, I just remind him that they exist. I&#39;m like<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re being a little oversensitive here. I never made any value<br/>
judgments about Latin vs. computer games, and yes, of course there are many<br/>
types of intelligences. But I know from experience that it&#39;s a whole lot<br/>
harder to do Latin than to do almost anything else we do, and my natural<br/>
tendency is to put it off. He is the same. That does not mean it&#39;s not<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44525660">Perhaps it&#39;s not learning Latin that is the problem but rather the <br/>
medium he&#39;s using to do it.  When I hear unschoolers talking about <br/>
this subject it always has to do with some formal learning <br/>
situation.  There are lots of other ways to learn Latin than through <br/>
a schoolish, sequential, college level, on-line Latin class.<br/>
<br/>
Being a word based person myself, I have lots of Latin materials <br/>
around the house including things for younger kids that my kids use <br/>
whenever the mood strikes.  These aren&#39;t watered down at all but just <br/>
more kid friendly.  One is Latin Is Fun by Amsco Publishing and the <br/>
other is an out of print book called Latin For The Grades published <br/>
around the turn of the century.  It&#39;s written for second graders who <br/>
don&#39;t even have a grasp of grammar yet but anyone who went through it <br/>
would put a second year high school Latin student to shame.  There&#39;s <br/>
also Transparent Language which I like a lot.<br/>
<br/>
We have stories and songs and games in Latin (and about six other <br/>
languages).  We watch movies and find stuff on the net.  Most of my <br/>
kids foreign langauges have been learned through Total Physical <br/>
Response.<br/>
<br/>
I studied Latin for three years, loved every minute of it but, <br/>
believe me, there is a better way.  And if you just let him be he&#39;ll <br/>
be able to find it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lillian, I get what you mean about procrastination, sounds like you <br/>
have a strong tendency to be a procrastinator, don&#39;t like that tendency <br/>
in yourself, and so you like someone else to be there to give you a <br/>
push to get around to doing things you want to &quot;have done&quot; but don&#39;t <br/>
ever just feel like doing at that particular moment. You&#39;re certainly <br/>
aware that you do things sometimes even though you&#39;d rather do other <br/>
things &quot;at the moment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a procrastinator. It is partly because I always have been able to <br/>
do what you say your son will do - procrastinate and then successfully <br/>
&quot;catch up&quot; in a last-minute intensive effort. It is the nature of how I <br/>
work. It is also sometimes because I do too many things and I do simply <br/>
&quot;forget&quot; about some of them until they become &quot;fires&quot; that have to be <br/>
put out.<br/>
<br/>
Some occasional &quot;reminding&quot; is just kindness between people who care <br/>
about each other, of course.<br/>
<br/>
However, parents who really want their kids to continue with their <br/>
music practice or latin group or whatever - will often claim to just be <br/>
&quot;reminding&quot; and say their kids have a choice, when, in fact, the kids <br/>
feel subtly pressured by the parents regular reminders to keep at <br/>
something that the kid would otherwise have dropped.  This is common. <br/>
Your situation may or may not be like this, but we can&#39;t tell from what <br/>
you write that it isn&#39;t. So, like anything else posted to this list, <br/>
get ready for it to be critiqued and examined and looked at from a <br/>
number of points of view.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I very much understand procrastination issues &lt;G&gt;. I don&#39;t <br/>
think I&#39;d appreciate someone else constantly reminding me to do the <br/>
things they think I really want to do instead of what I am doing at the <br/>
moment, though. I&#39;m trying to think of how my parents could have helped <br/>
me be less of a procrastinator....I see it in my kids and I still do <br/>
it, myself, so it isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve resolved, entirely.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do &quot;nagging&quot; - it drives me nuts (because as a procrastinator <br/>
myself I hate it when people start &quot;reminding&quot; me - &quot;Honey, didn&#39;t you <br/>
want to go grocery shopping? Maybe this would be a good time for you to <br/>
do that?&quot;) I don&#39;t do that to my family. But last night Rosie said, <br/>
&quot;Oh, I need to remember to finish the blankets for Aunt Julie and Aunt <br/>
Kathleen. Remind me tomorrow morning, okay?&quot; So - right now since I <br/>
just remembered &lt;G&gt;, I&#39;m calling out to her, &quot;Hey, Rosie, don&#39;t forget <br/>
about the blankets.&quot;  She says, &quot;Oh, yeah, thanks.&quot; And she&#39;s <br/>
continuing to play her computer game. Maybe she&#39;ll remember the <br/>
blankets today or tomorrow or maybe she&#39;ll be staying up late <br/>
frantically finishing them (Christmas gifts).<br/>
<br/>
So, Lillian, instead of examining whether or not you&#39;re still in the <br/>
unschooling club if you remind your son to do something (because who <br/>
the heck cares - truth is, there is no club &lt;G&gt;), I&#39;m turning this into <br/>
a question of how do you handle it when you see your child <br/>
procrastinating doing something they want to do and you know it will <br/>
end up that they&#39;ll have to do it under a time crunch and when tired, <br/>
etc. Or that it may not get done. Or that it&#39;ll get done but not in a <br/>
way that the kid will be happy with.<br/>
<br/>
If some activity regularly requires parents to remind kids to do it I <br/>
bet most unschoolers here will say: &quot;Let him procrastinate and learn <br/>
from it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is harder for those of us who still feel kind of crummy <br/>
about ourselves because of our own tendency to procrastinate, even <br/>
after years and years of experiencing the natural consequences. We <br/>
parents tend to be pretty reactive when see our own weaknesses or <br/>
failings showing up in our children.<br/>
<br/>
My kids do procrastinate like I do. It has helped me to watch them and <br/>
realize that they still manage to accomplish a LOT and that often the <br/>
things they procrastinate on are things they end up dropping later as <br/>
lower priority than other things they&#39;re doing. My kids and I suffer <br/>
from simply thinking we want to do a LOT more than what we can <br/>
realistically manage so procrastinating can sometimes be our way of <br/>
determining which things we really do work on. Sometimes it is because <br/>
we&#39;re trying to do too much and are overwhelmed and kind of paralyzed. <br/>
Sometimes it is because we decide to do things because we think we <br/>
&quot;should&quot; rather than because we really &quot;want&quot; to do it.<br/>
<br/>
So - looking back at what Lillian wrote --<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;On days when I need to do something, I ask my husband and boys to <br/>
remind me<br/>
repeatedly until I actually do it. It&#39;s quite easy to get distracted <br/>
and let<br/>
things slip, even things that are important to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Asking others to remind you occasionally is one thing - saying you ask <br/>
them to remind you &quot;repeatedly&quot; seems like you&#39;re asking them to take <br/>
responsibility for you, instead of you finding a way to deal with your <br/>
own distractibility.  I also can&#39;t help but question how important <br/>
something can really be to you if you still &quot;let it slip&quot; after <br/>
repeated reminders.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There&#39;s nothing to reexamine about the Latin, and that was my point <br/>
before: If he doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to do it, he doesn&#39;t have to. But since he wants to do it, if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to spend four hours on it in one day, he has to spread that out <br/>
over<br/>
several days. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If that is his goal, a brief reminder, &quot;Honey, don&#39;t forget you wanted <br/>
to do your Latin today and that you won&#39;t have time this afternoon <br/>
because we&#39;re going to a movie,&quot; ought to be enough to give him the <br/>
heads up that he might want to think about his time management for the <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my kids tend to be procrastinators like I am, my older kids <br/>
who take college courses manage to get all their work done and done <br/>
well. Sometimes they do it last minute and sometimes they plan ahead <br/>
and do things early.  I don&#39;t remind them or even know what they have <br/>
to do unless one of them says to me, &quot;Mom, remind me I need to work on <br/>
my project for my class tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I didn&#39;t hear, Lillian, from your descriptions, was any mention of <br/>
your son initiating or asking for the reminders. So that leaves the <br/>
feeling this is mom wanting her kid to do things the &quot;right&quot; way - not <br/>
leave it to the last minute.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;And if he gets so into Deus Ex or Freedom Force that he<br/>
 </span></blockquote>forgets, we have to remind him. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
There is that &quot;we have to&quot; phrase --- you mean you have to remind him <br/>
or else he&#39;ll have to do it all at once at the last minute. But you <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; remind him. You could also help figure out all kinds of <br/>
other ways to help him consider not putting it off. I use a computer <br/>
calendar that allows me to set &quot;alarms&quot; - either emails that I can set <br/>
to arrive before an &quot;event&quot; or little popups that will remind me about <br/>
&quot;events.&quot; And I put in as &quot;events&quot; anything that I think I might need <br/>
to be reminded about. This works well for me because it is when I&#39;m <br/>
online that I&#39;m most likely to be procrastinating &lt;G&gt;. So if HE sees <br/>
procrastinating as a problem for himself, he might like to brainstorm <br/>
with you and come up with some ways he can be responsible for his own <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There are certain things in life that we all &quot;have&quot; to do, for <br/>
whatever reason.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This kind of statement is what gives your email a &quot;tone&quot; that doesn&#39;t <br/>
sound like unschooling. Yes, its true that we all have to do some <br/>
things - like eat and sleep and pay our taxes &lt;G&gt;. But what does that <br/>
have to do with a totally optional doing-it-because-he-loves-it Latin <br/>
class? He apparently DOES do it, right? Whether you remind him or not? <br/>
The question is whether he does it by spreading it out over several <br/>
days or does it all in one intense session at the last minute. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do it either way. Neither is right or wrong. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t even &quot;have to&quot; do it at all.<br/>
<br/>
I bet that when he procrastinates and then does it all at once to get <br/>
it done on time, he is unhappy and you worry that it won&#39;t continue to <br/>
be fun and he&#39;ll want to quit something that would continue to give him <br/>
pleasure if he&#39;d do it differently. Makes sense to me. So it would make <br/>
sense to me to talk to him about that - give him that insight of yours <br/>
so he has that awareness. I think maybe that is what you are trying to <br/>
do by repeatedly reminding him and that is why it still feels, to you, <br/>
like he has a choice, but from outside it looks like you care more <br/>
about him doing it than he does.<br/>

they really wanted to do.  Part of being a kid is<br/>
living in the moment instead of thinking about what<br/>
needs to be done by the end of the week.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the fact that as her son got older he took<br/>
over the responsibility for finishing the work on time<br/>
means it really was something he wanted to do and yet<br/>
he wasn&#39;t ready to be 100% responsible for it.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t part of unschooling enabling our children to do<br/>
the things they want to do, whether it is driving them<br/>
to karate class or paying for the          lessons or<br/>
reading books aloud to them?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe a gentle reminder during the week to do the work<br/>
for his online class was what he needed to succeed at<br/>
what he really wanted to do, instead of leaving him to<br/>
be frustrated because he had hours of work to do in<br/>
one evening and perhaps thinking he couldn&#39;t do this<br/>
class afterall.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving him to be frustrated and feel like a failure<br/>
because he was overwhelmed would not help him, nor<br/>
would it teach him to be more responsible.  It would<br/>
have just caused him to quit doing something he<br/>
enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, maybe not...if I am looking at this<br/>
skewed, please let me know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416019929"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If they love it or need it, they&#39;ll do it.  As I said before, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; dealt with this a lot in consulting with homeschoolers for many<br/>
&gt; years.  So many people as they learn about unschooling are in the<br/>
&gt; same situation.  It really takes an act of faith* to let go- no<br/>
&gt; reminders, finding less formal ways to learn something, letting them<br/>
&gt; fail or waste their time- but those who do, without exception, find<br/>
&gt; that it really is simple.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What doesn&#39;t seem to be coming across is that I&#39;m not invested in the Latin.<br/>
It&#39;s not mine. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mine. I don&#39;t think I have to force him to<br/>
keep going. He quit once before, and he can quit again if he wants to. All I<br/>
do is remind him. He wants to finish the textbook so he can read Harry<br/>
Potter in Latin. It&#39;s his goal. It&#39;s his project. Ignoring him isn&#39;t<br/>
allowing him the freedom to succeed -- it&#39;s allowing him the freedom to<br/>
procrastinate and then stay up till midnight and be miserable.<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t believe that every single person on this list does exactly what<br/>
he or she wants at every single minute of the day and still works toward<br/>
greater goals. Don&#39;t you ever have to do something you don&#39;t particularly<br/>
want to do because it moves you along toward something you do want?<br/>

&gt; for his online class was what he needed to succeed at<br/>
&gt; what he really wanted to do, instead of leaving him to<br/>
&gt; be frustrated because he had hours of work to do in<br/>
&gt; one evening and perhaps thinking he couldn&#39;t do this<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love to sew.  I hate to mend and hem.  It is a wish of mine to have a<br/>
photograph of my children in matching pajamas in front of our Christmas tree<br/>
and/or their stockings every Christmas (photo to be taken on Christmas Eve).<br/>
I have two girls (ages 7 & 3).  I found matching red plaid sleepwear (night<br/>
gown for my daughter that likes nightgowns, pajamas with pants for my<br/>
daughter that only likes pants).  Well, the pants are way too long.  The<br/>
smallest size that I could find were a size too big.  I didn&#39;t realize that<br/>
they&#39;d be quite this big.  So, I either have to hem them, or go without the<br/>
photo because my daughter will not wear clothes that are too big or too<br/>
small (she&#39;ll just strip in order to be comfortable).  So...  today I am<br/>
hemming.  I&#39;ve procrastinated it because I hate hemming, but I&#39;ll do it<br/>
because I want that photo.<br/>
<br/>
Another example:  My 7 yo daughter, Zoe, wanted to wrap her Christmas<br/>
present for her sister in white paper that she could decorate (her goal and<br/>
idea, not mine).  We have white paper, but was having a really hard time<br/>
finding a time when her sister was asleep or otherwise not going to see.  A<br/>
couple of nights ago, she fell asleep and I immediately went and got Zoe and<br/>
said, &quot;I know you are busy right now, but here is your chance.  Teagan is<br/>
asleep.&quot;  I helped get the supplies out for wrapping and coloring and Zoe<br/>
did it.  I helped with the harder parts in order to make it go faster (we<br/>
were worried that Teagan would wake up and see what we were doing--she<br/>
didn&#39;t).  I reminded, she had to stop the really fun thing that she was in<br/>
the middle of, but she wanted to wrap so she did it then (even though it<br/>
wasn&#39;t the ideal time for her).  I wouldn&#39;t have been mad if she&#39;d said that<br/>
she didn&#39;t want to do it then, but I would have reminded her that she might<br/>
not get another chance (we&#39;d been waiting for a chance for weeks).<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, of course, we do things that we don&#39;t really want to do in order to<br/>
get our long term goals met.  I do the laundry and dishes practically every<br/>
day so that my long term goal of not having to do 10 loads of laundry and/or<br/>
multiple loads of dishes in one day is met.  :)  It would be nice to do zero<br/>
loads a day, but I would rather eat and wear clothes.<br/>
