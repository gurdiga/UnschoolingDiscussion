<div id="ygrps-yiv-53428630">Hey, thanks you all that responded to my question.  It has made me <br/>
realize that what I am doing is working just great. Right now I am <br/>
in the middle of potty-training my twins so that has been taking up <br/>
a major portion of my time. I was feeling a bit guilty that I <br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;right there when needed&quot; like I thought I needed to be. <br/>
I also received great encouragement from the single parent who <br/>
responded.  It gave me a boost of confidence that I CAN do it too!<br/>
I&#39;m off to check for wet undies again! LOL</div>
