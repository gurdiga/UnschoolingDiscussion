 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;His attitude toward school is that it is stupid but he wants to be with <br/>
his friends.  I figure it he feels that way, he&#39;ll come home before he gets <br/>
into trouble over it.  I think he just wants to decide if its worth it to be <br/>
with his friends and I don&#39;t think it will take long for him to decide.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My daughter will readily admit her first reason for wanting to go to school. <br/>
It&#39;s for the social stuff. The people, her friends, all the daily <br/>
interaction, the homecomings and proms. Funny thing is of the latter two, <br/>
she hasn&#39;t gone to any yet!!! She figures it should be special and she&#39;s <br/>
saving homecoming and prom for her last year. Go figure. Maybe they aren&#39;t <br/>
all as important as she thought. Maybe again she just likes the idea of <br/>
having the choice and being able to say no. Tara has always had this power <br/>
struggle going on with herself and others. I think that&#39;s half the thing <br/>
about school. Pushing the line a little but not being over it. Of course I <br/>
was the same way in school. Never really in trouble but always pushing it <br/>
with teachers and rules enough to get noticed. I understand Tara. That&#39;s <br/>
good for us both!<br/>
<br/>
The second thing that Tara finds interesting is the validation. She likes <br/>
seeing herself being good at something instead of just knowing it and <br/>
hearing it from us. The paper and accolades count for her. That&#39;s her and if <br/>
that&#39;s what she needs and wants, I&#39;m with her. I can actually see the last <br/>
year undoing all the crap the schools did to her previously. It was our <br/>
whole attitude change and I have this list to partly thank for stressing <br/>
that to me. It has made a difference, even if we are talking school. Again <br/>
we&#39;re talking choices. I just really hope none of the other 3 want to go <br/>
that way.&lt;bg&gt; Hypocritical I guess but hopeful none the less.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369388384">--- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com">Unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Mary Bianco&quot; &gt; <br/>
&lt;&gt;My daughter will readily admit her first reason for wanting to go <br/>
to school.  It&#39;s for the social stuff. The people, her friends, all <br/>
the daily interaction, the homecomings and proms. Funny thing is of <br/>
the latter two, she hasn&#39;t gone to any yet!!!&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter started out in what appeared to be a good supportive home <br/>
education environment with a large homeschool support group that <br/>
called itself inclusive.  The reality was something else we soon <br/>
learned, and ultimately she ended up being the only homeschooler in <br/>
this large group who was officially banned from the homeschool prom, <br/>
a small rather expensive affair organized by a small group of moms <br/>
from this homeschool support group.  Now, this was not the first time <br/>
she had experienced exclusion from members of this group, but this <br/>
was the first time we were officially notified of her exclusion.  <br/>
<br/>
Why?  Was she some sort of miscreant?  Did she have a behavior <br/>
problem?  Was she known for her wildness and unsocial attitudes?  <br/>
Nope.  She is, in fact, an extremely disciplined competitive figure <br/>
skater aiming for the U. S. Nationals in the next few years.  She is <br/>
pretty and congenial, and bright, a high achiever involved in lots of <br/>
outside social and volunteer activities, educational and <br/>
philanthropic groups and projects.  <br/>
<br/>
So why was she excluded?  No one felt that they had to give a <br/>
reason.  But some did spread lies and rumors.  One mother told the <br/>
group of organizing mothers that I had phoned her inquiring about <br/>
whether or not my daughter could attend this prom, that I had argued <br/>
with her, and that she had told me clearly that my daugther was not <br/>
welcome, then I had hung up on her.  None of which is true; never <br/>
happened.  I never called anyone to inquire about my daughter <br/>
attending this prom.  She goes to several proms and formal dances <br/>
every year, as a guest of the friends she has made through her other <br/>
organizational activities outside the home education world.  As a <br/>
matter of fact, on the very day this exclusive little homeschool prom <br/>
was supposed to take place she had already accepted an invitation to <br/>
attend another formal dance, a very fancy one at one of the best and <br/>
biggest schools in our metropolitan area.  So she had never even <br/>
thought about going to this homeschool prom.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I had inquired via my e-list about this prom, so <br/>
that I could post the information, all the facts, on my homeschool e-<br/>
list for other homeschooled teens who might be interested.  I had no <br/>
idea about what was going on behind the scenes in this group of moms <br/>
who were organizing this event.  I do know that I wasn&#39;t getting <br/>
responses to my email queries for information.  But since it wasn&#39;t <br/>
something I was personally concerned about I didn&#39;t really care one <br/>
way or the other, just tried to get the basic info to post for other <br/>
homeschoolers who might be interested, which I do every day for all <br/>
kinds of activities that I learn about.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally I received an email from one of the moms informing me that my <br/>
daughter had been banned from this homeschool prom, not giving any <br/>
reason, of course, just informing me that I should not have made that <br/>
phone call to one of the moms, should not have hung up on her.  <br/>
Wow!!!  The lengths to which some people will go to justify their <br/>
bigotry and bad behavior.  I was stunned by this email.  But the <br/>
small-mindedness of some of the local homeschoolers had more than <br/>
come home to me in the past, which is why we made every effort to <br/>
expand my daughter&#39;s circle of friends and activities way beyond the <br/>
home education crowd. <br/>
<br/>
Today she attends a number of proms and formals throughout the year, <br/>
all at area high schools, as a guest of other teens she has met in <br/>
all her different activities.  What&#39;s more she always designs and <br/>
makes her own prom dresses since one of her career interests is <br/>
fashion design.  This month&#39;s floor length slinky shimmery gown was a <br/>
big hit, costing her a grand total of $5.  She went with a date who <br/>
was the star of the whole dance since he was the best dancer there, <br/>
had circles of other dancers standing around him most of the evening, <br/>
lines of girls trying to get a dance with him, often dancing with as <br/>
many as six girls simultaneously.  He, too, was a guest at this <br/>
formal dance, as was my daughter, both invited by one of my <br/>
daughter&#39;s good friends.  My daughter had to share him for many of <br/>
the dances, but she didn&#39;t mind at all.  She had lots of other <br/>
friends there that she wanted to dance with so she enjoyed the <br/>
privilege of being the only one this handsome and well-liked young <br/>
man chose to dance with for all the slow dances, which made her very <br/>
special indeed.  <br/>
<br/>
What did she miss by being banned, shunned, from the homeschool <br/>
prom?  She missed attending an expensive and very exclusive little <br/>
dance with a small group of small-minded people.  Instead she has <br/>
attended, and continues to attend, a string of wonderful proms and <br/>
formal dances throughout our greater metropolitan area, with lots of <br/>
friends she knows at these dances, and the opportunity to make many <br/>
new friends, too.  She finds herself very socially comfortable in a <br/>
wide variety of situations, and has a great sense of social self-<br/>
confidence.  And she has never had to attend a single day of public <br/>
or private school to enjoy all these social benefits from the <br/>
institutionalized teen high school scene.   <br/>
<br/>
I guess the moral of my story is for home educators not to limit <br/>
themselves to our small home education communities and groups, <br/>
especially as our children enter their teen years.  A whole big <br/>
wonderful world is waiting for their participation, and often the <br/>
best things do not come from the immediate circle of home education <br/>
support group activities.  By encouraging my daughter to pursue her <br/>
interests, to involve herself in a wide variety of activities, all of <br/>
which have greatly expanded her social circles, she has even more <br/>
social and civic options open to her than the average high schooler.  <br/>
She does not see the world in terms of a cheerleading letter sweater, <br/>
or one high school athletic team, or one pre-determined group of <br/>
friends who come from the pool who get shuffled into one specific <br/>
educational institution.  I think she is way ahead on the social <br/>
integration end of things.<br/>
