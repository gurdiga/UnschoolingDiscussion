<div id="ygrps-yiv-878169217">Been there; done that; own the forge and tongs.<br/>
<br/>
2 cheap quick and easy way to ease in, both of which were very<br/>
satisfactory for our son.  (1) living history/re-enactment events<br/>
may have a smithy set up.  If so, plan to spend the weekend at<br/>
that spot (2) the Farmer&#39;s Co-op or where ever folks in your area<br/>
buy horse stuff will have a bulletin board with business cards<br/>
from farriers.  Take one of each and call until you find a<br/>
congenial soul who would like a hand for some training.  The<br/>
first 30 or 40 plant hangers I got for Christmas came from those<br/>
opportunities.  ...of course Santa brought him a bad of<br/>
anthracite coal after a few years, but he was big enough to see<br/>
the joke - not to mention that it was offset with a new blower<br/>
for the forge and a new range for his apartment.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the ultimate teenage liberation is to give them their own<br/>
apartment attached to the house - laundry room, kitchen, outside<br/>
doors, etc and the freedom to live as independently as they want.<br/>

| &gt; Holly told me last week that when she was little she had told<br/>
the neighbors<br/>
| &gt; she wanted to be an artist when she grew up.  So they all<br/>
started saying<br/>
| &gt; they<br/>
| &gt; wanted to be artists too.  But the whole field of choice she<br/>
had at the<br/>
| &gt; time<br/>
| &gt; was artist or actress.  She hadn&#39;t realized there were all<br/>
KINDS of<br/>
| &gt; choices.<br/>
| &gt; So give the two she knew of, she&#39;d prefer artist, and the<br/>
neighbors copied<br/>
| &gt; her. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

wants to be a<br/>
