&lt;&lt; When we were flying from Boston to LA we stopped in Pittsburgh. It took us<br/>
<br/>
an hour by plane. It takes us 11 hours by car. We had 5 more hours to get to<br/>
<br/>
California. Kathryn, who was 10 at the time, said &quot;Do you know how long it<br/>
<br/>
would take to drive to California? It would take 66 hours.&quot; *That&#39;s*<br/>
<br/>
algebraic thinking. (Which someone neatly described as using what you know<br/>
<br/>
to figure out what you don&#39;t know.) The context of the problem supplied the<br/>
<br/>
sense of how the numbers needed to be manipulated. Her curiosity supplied<br/>
<br/>
the desire to manipulate them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
CREEPY CREEPY!!!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly was asking how long it would take to drive to Florida.  I <br/>
said four days (taking into consideration stopping and sleeping, and not <br/>
driving like a truckdriver).  How long would it take to drive to California <br/>
(by which she meant &quot;Disneyland&quot;).  I said &quot;two drivers, not stopping? one <br/>
day&quot;  meaning there within 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
And yesterday I was thinking (without mentioning it to Holly) of Boston.  She <br/>
had said &quot;We should go on a road trip,&quot; and I was doing something else and <br/>
didn&#39;t say anything but said &quot;Boston.&quot;  And she saw a panel van with a little <br/>
window in the back, on the side (like a full-size Chevy without side windows) <br/>
and said &quot;We should get one of those for trips!&quot;  I said it&#39;s not fun, I had <br/>
ridden to Pennsylvania and back in the back of a windowless van.  Hot and <br/>
boring.<br/>
<br/>
But my most obvious algebra story has to do with allowance.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid my allowance was 35 cents for a while.  The paperback books <br/>
I was reading that season cost 50 cents.  (Doc Savage books.  Weird.)  So my <br/>
math had to do with two weeks, one book, four candy bars.  Boring and <br/>
insufficient for my needs.  But I still to this day know with no thought that <br/>
70 cents is divisible by 35 and that $1.05 is three weeks&#39; allowance at that <br/>
long-ago rate.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are aware of the others&#39; allowance rates.  It&#39;s 75 cents per year of <br/>
age per week.  A ten year old gets $7.50, and there was a second wave <br/>
Schoolhouse Rock video about &quot;$7.50 once a week&quot; that Holly saw when she was <br/>
ten.  That was cool.<br/>
<br/>
But they have over the years calmly, efficiently and correctly calculated how <br/>
long it would take any one of them, or two or three of them together, to buy <br/>
this or that.  And how much more quickly they could save a given amount if <br/>
they were a year older.  Marty is especially quick at it.  We&#39;ve never <br/>
stopped them and shown them any algebraic notation to go with it.  Someday <br/>
when someone does, they will get it immediately, without any hesitition or <br/>
bafflement, because it will be the writing system of a language with which <br/>
they are already familiar.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby doesn&#39;t claim his allowance regularly because he has a job.  It goes on <br/>
the calendar each Sunday like an oldtime passbook.  When he needs a lump of <br/>
money he &quot;withdraws allowance,&quot; but the goal is to save for the anime <br/>
convention in Denver in fall.  This will be the third year that is his method <br/>
of savings.<br/>
<br/>
Holly sometimes goes to calendar, but often takes it and keeps it herself.   <br/>
She is the person most likely in this family to be able to change a $20 or to <br/>
lend someone $10.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen Kirby&#39;s wallet, and Marty&#39;s.  They usually have a little money, <br/>
and their wallets are immaculately organized.  I&#39;m impressed.   Their dad&#39;s <br/>
is too.  I guess it&#39;s genetic.  I would use a wallet if I didn&#39;t lose them  <br/>
so easily.  I use little manila envelopes that fit into a jeans pocket, and I <br/>
can write on the outside when I use the debit card and for how much, and I <br/>
can note appointments and phone numbers, and then get a new envelope when <br/>
it&#39;s full or I&#39;ve spent $200.  That&#39;s a kind of algebra problem too, mixed <br/>
with other matters.  But the best parts of life are mixed matters!<br/>
