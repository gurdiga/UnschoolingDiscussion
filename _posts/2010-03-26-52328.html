<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458417623">I have friends who smoke but never in the house... only outside, usually on<br/>
the front stoop. Never in the car unless it&#39;s a car only for the smoker.<br/>
They have kids now. And that helps their kids have some say-so about their<br/>
breathing space. The reason for not smoking indoors is that the smoker grew<br/>
up in a home where the kids didn&#39;t get to ask that no one smoke in the<br/>
house, and it reeked. That&#39;s probably part of the reason he smokes. He has<br/>
siblings that smoke, 3 out of 4. He would love to quit and so would his<br/>
sister. I used to visit the family a lot in the house of his parents and<br/>
that&#39;s where I started liking the smell of cigs. Then it wasn&#39;t long (couple<br/>
years) before I took it up. Now I&#39;ve quit.<br/>
<br/>
Just some ideas for reasons to smoke outdoors rather than indoors. If anyone<br/>
wants them (probably not ;). But doing that might cut down on kids and<br/>
friends taking up the habit.<br/>

Marty&#39;s girlfriend smokes.  She tries to stop.  Marty smokes a few<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041842681">There&#39;s some interesting new research on the effects of third-hand smoke (the basic upshot being that the chemicals that come in with the smoker are still toxic). . .  at least there&#39;s fewer of them (for the sake of the children&#39;s air).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718110645">Whenever my husband was having a hard time quitting & staying stopped, I found American Spirit Tobacco which is chemical additive free. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://americanspiritloosetobacco.com/">http://americanspiritloosetobacco.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
What I saw was that when the chemicals are gone from the tobacco, it made it easier to smoke less and easier to quit. There are testimonies in the American Spirit literature about it too. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad that people become addicted to smoking, they know it smells bad and makes them feel bad; still, they&#39;re compelled to continue, often longer than they wish. I feel for them.<br/>
<br/>
And at the same time, I don&#39;t want to smell it. Phew<br/>
<br/>
