<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128948405">I think the alarms could be useful for an older child who was very upset by <br/>
the wetting.  I have had friends who used them with their children with good <br/>
results.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH It&#39;s going to stop on its own eventually so why bother.  Reassurance <br/>
that it will eventually stop and that others take longer to stay dry at night too <br/>
may be all that is needed.<br/>

years older than me, now 46. He wet the bed till he was 12yrs old. I remember that <br/>
alarm going off in his room, and all hell broke loose in our house. My dad <br/>
would go yelling into Bill&#39;s room and haul him into the bathroom. My mom would <br/>
go in to change the sheets and mutter and grumble about it, the alarm skelled <br/>
the dickens out of me, and to this day, I cannot stand alarm clocks, fire <br/>
alarms, school bells etc. I only recently realized it was probably to do with that <br/>
alarm and my parent&#39;s less than empathic handling of the bedwetting. <br/>
Interestingly, my brother&#39;s daughter is the only one of the grandchildren that had a <br/>
problem with bedwetting, and she did so till she was 12. Both of them were deep <br/>
sleepers. <br/>
Just my experience with noisy alarms, some 35years ago.<br/>

  Thank You!  My fingers and my brain are not well connected.  It&#39;s always interesting proof reading my writing.  Though I usually get the &quot;Oh my gosh, That is not how this is spelled&quot; irritated perfectionist telling me I&#39;ve done it Wrong.  Thank God for spell check or I think I&#39;d be banned from some lists.8-D<br/>
