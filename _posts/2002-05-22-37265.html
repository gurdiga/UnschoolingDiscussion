<div id="ygrps-yiv-599835438">Hi Joy,<br/>
<br/>
I have a very interpersonal first born daughter. I also have 2 younger <br/>
children. When I feel I can no longer keep up with my girl&#39;s constant need <br/>
for me, I invite friends over or get invited to friend&#39;s houses. She has a <br/>
constant need for sharing her life. It is how she learns. She does not nor <br/>
can I expect her to be alone and thrive. Aloneness is a type of punishment <br/>
for Ashley. When I hear I am bored, which happens after hanging out with our <br/>
schooled friends by the way, I say my mantra,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;boredom is the soil from which sprouts creativity.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids get very tired of this. I really say it over and over if they come <br/>
to me bored. The schooled friends of ours think I&#39;m nuts, but they get it. <br/>
Ashley&#39;s mom does not fix our state of boredom. I also invite my daughter to <br/>
hang out with me and fold laundry or wash or cook. Sometimes she does, but <br/>
usually she will find herself having lots of ideas of activities.<br/>
<br/>
When you have cool stuff sitting around unused, I find if i move stuff, <br/>
maybe check out a kit, the kids are all over me to play with it. Yesterday <br/>
we were doing a group stamping project, so I was sorting the stamps, <br/>
checking the ink pads. My three kids stamped for over 1 hour. The stamps are <br/>
in reach, yet sat untouched until I touched them.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts so far. As for new baby, they are so fun for older siblings to <br/>
help with and an 8 year old can do lots of important jobs including holding <br/>
and rocking and burping. Including your son in as much baby stuff as you can <br/>
may help satisfy his need to be with you. My older got to watch newborn alot <br/>
while I took my daily shower.<br/>
