<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312930127">&quot;We are here to help each other learn. A statement like <br/>
the above is like a Christian man going to a Rabbi and asking for help with <br/>
his faith. Then crying out *WHY didn&#39;t you help me? The advice you gave <br/>
doesn&#39;t apply to my Christian life!* The Rabbi can only help from his Jewish <br/>
point of view. We can only help from our Unschooling lives point of view. We <br/>
can&#39;t give advice on punishments. Other than to say we don&#39;t use them, and we <br/>
feel they don&#39;t work, and we feel there are more effective ways to live with <br/>
our children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a year old.  It was written by one of the wise homeschooling moms <br/>
named &quot;Nancy.&quot;  Now I wish I knew which one.   But it was good, and it&#39;s still <br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
When someone hates the ideas presented here, it&#39;s hard, but if we give people <br/>
advice they like regardless of what we really believe, we&#39;re not really going <br/>
to be helping anybody.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to Holly and Marty about people getting angry when we say &quot;eep&quot; <br/>
about ideas like walking away from a kid who&#39;s crying and locking him out.  <br/>
They both got big eyes about that story, and I wish I could magically (or <br/>
electronically) convey the looks on their faces.    I think they&#39;ll be really good <br/>
parents, and if they do better than I did, WONDERFUL!  If they say &quot;I just <br/>
decided to be a better mom than my mom was,&quot; that would be great.  I have screwed <br/>
up in an assortment of ways, but I keep moving toward the me I would like to <br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
One of the moms who left the list (but might come back, I don&#39;t know) said I <br/>
treated her like she wasn&#39;t smart (I don&#39;t have the exact quote here, and <br/>
that&#39;s okay).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a hard thing to answer.  If I respond to ideas on the merit of the <br/>
idea itself, I thinying, &quot;Well this one should be cut slack or ignored because <br/>
she seems not to be thinking very well,&quot; that would seem to me when I was <br/>
treating someone as though she were less intelligent.   <br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s a problem for me.  Assuming everyone is really on equal footing may <br/>
not be realistic, but sorting and treating some as second-string isn&#39;t nice.<br/>
<br/>
On the discussion boards someone wrote a long request for information, and <br/>
after I wrote a long response, she said &quot;I came here for help.  Can anyone help <br/>
me?&quot;  (Or some such.)   Others did respond too, but although she asked me <br/>
direct (and seemingly snarky) questions,  I wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
By Sandra Dodd (Sandradodd) on Sunday, November 23, 2003 - 04:35 pm:<br/>
-=-I am asking for advice on unschooling. . . .Can <br/>
anyone help me? -=- <br/>
<br/>
If you came to me with a hammer in your hands <br/>
saying you wanted to learn to play recorder, I <br/>
would ask you to put down the hammer. <br/>
<br/>
I AM trying to help. <br/>
<br/>
I will lend you a recorder. I will GIVE you a <br/>
recorder, but you need both hands free to accept <br/>
it. <br/>

I feel bad, because her first post was very enthusiastic, but it was <br/>
disdainful of her kids in a way, and clearly she doesn&#39;t want to give up making them <br/>
read, telling them what to do, and getting &quot;results&quot; she&#39;s already foreseen.   <br/>
But it was (in terms of Nancy&#39;s analogy) as though she was gushing full voice <br/>
about what a WONDERFUL church this was and how at home she was going to be, <br/>
and someone said &quot;it&#39;s a synagogue, but you&#39;re welcome,&quot; and she said  &quot;I came <br/>
here for a church, when is Mass?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard helping a lot of people at once.<br/>
It&#39;s too much for volunteers to help each person individually.<br/>
I learn from the exchanges when we get some good ideas flowing, and I don&#39;t <br/>
want to abandon the full-list format, but sometimes it&#39;s really, truly <br/>
frustrating to find people complaining that they didn&#39;t get what they came for.<br/>

<br/>
We don&#39;t have a FAQ yet.  That might be nice, for newer people to the list.  <br/>
If you guys write the questions, Joyce can write the answers!  (Okay, we <br/>
won&#39;t make Joyce do ALL the work.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe people here could propose questions AND answers for them, for <br/>
newcomers.  <br/>

Sandra and all,<br/>
<br/>
I hear your frustration, so maybe this is a good time to jump in with<br/>
my story.  Fisher left first grade two weeks ago and has been<br/>
unschooling ever since.  I have gone through every conceivable<br/>
emotion, especially during the week we made the decision and had to<br/>
tell people.  But every time I panic, every time I think &quot;dear God,<br/>
what have I done,&quot; I make myself read the posts on the web site, or go<br/>
to SandraDodd.com, or pick up a John Holt book.  If I was on the web<br/>
site, I would specifically look for Sandra&#39;s posts, or Joyce&#39;s or<br/>
Pam&#39;s or some of the other long-timers -- my time is limited and I<br/>
just wanted to get to the voices of unschooling for the moment, and<br/>
not to the questions -- I wanted to jump right to the &quot;answers.&quot;  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And it worked.  We&#39;re having a great time.  We&#39;re watching all kinds<br/>
of TV and wondering lots of things about the shows we&#39;re watching.  We<br/>
write down lists of Toys We&#39;re Interested In from the commercials.  We<br/>
play Pokemon and Yu-gi-oh -- the card games and pretend adventures,<br/>
sometimes with some Dora thrown in.  Fisher made up an awesome game<br/>
that we played with the characters from Yu-gi-oh making up imaginary<br/>
teams -- he threw a ball up the steps, counted which step it landed<br/>
on, divided that number in half, and that was the score for that<br/>
player.  After a bunch of rounds, we added up the scores -- he worked<br/>
with the math because, after all, it was his game and he wanted to<br/>
know how to score it.  We&#39;ve run to Toys R Us to buy a Yu-gi-oh<br/>
monster shootout game that he saw advertised and really wanted --<br/>
before we went we had a great discussion about money and how our<br/>
household finances work (since I had to make sure I had enough money<br/>
to buy the game &lt;g&gt; -- I didn&#39;t have enough for all the extra figures,<br/>
so he chipped in with his saved birthday/allowance money).<br/>
<br/>
Most of all, I have my son back.  Slowly he&#39;s coming back from being<br/>
over-scheduled and somewhat sullen.  He has loads of time to play with<br/>
his baby brother, and I get more hugs and kisses than I&#39;ve gotten in<br/>
months.  He got sad about missing school exactly twice, when he saw<br/>
the big good-bye card that his class made for him.  After that, I<br/>
asked him if he missed school and the answer was immediate and simple: no.<br/>
<br/>
I still have questions that I&#39;ll bring up another time, but for right<br/>
now, you should know that what you&#39;re doing is helping.  I let go of<br/>
the side of the pool and whaddya know, the water does hold me up!  So<br/>
thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
I think this could be fun to do for its own sake, but I wouldn&#39;t expect this<br/>
to remove repetitive basic questions from some new people even if the exact<br/>
question is answered. How many people seem to write &quot;I know it says to read<br/>
for a while before posting but, how do I get my child to read? She just sits<br/>
all day and watches tv, unless I make her go outside.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I left another list, partly because this list was better, and partly because<br/>
I got so tired of the same endless questions about how to file an R-4 posted<br/>
daily, despite the introduction directing people back to the list&#39;s parent<br/>
group page that has step-by-step instructions on how to do it, and FAQ<br/>
pages. Some people are lazy, some people want to feel special. I see<br/>
sometimes people ask a silly question and get invited to read for a while<br/>
longer. Maybe there should be a standard answer that gets sent out by one of<br/>
the moderators: Please go to the FAQ page.  Am I just cynical?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, but that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
If ALL we ever do is say &quot;read the rules, read the FAQ&quot; it will be as boring <br/>
as if we discuss R-4s all the time (especially since only nine people are in <br/>
California &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Some balance might be good, though.  A FAQ for those who are into reading <br/>
stuff like that would give them a boost toward the deeper parts of the <br/>
discussions.  They could help the rest of us answer the repetitive questions.<br/>
