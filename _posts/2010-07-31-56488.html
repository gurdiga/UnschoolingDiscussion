<div id="ygrps-yiv-106306004">dear everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for some advice how to handle my sons drinking. <br/>
He is 18, finished highschool last summer (he didn&#39;t choose homeschool three <br/>
years ago when we discovered the legal way to homeschool in Holland for his 10 <br/>
year youger siter), didn&#39;t want to go to the university (OK by us) works self <br/>
employed from home to earn enough to pay for his clothes, social life and things <br/>
(we don;t want money for food or housing and pay his insurance) he helps with <br/>
cooking and shopping. Since we homeschoole we try as much to apply unschooling <br/>
principles, so he is supported in his interests, we give him trust and freedom <br/>
and there is a lot of love all around.<br/>
Mostly I&#39;m very happy with what he chooses to do. But he is drinking to much. <br/>
From thursday to sunday he goes out each night, with friends. They stay out till <br/>
dawn, spend time at friends houses (all his friends live in student houses, not <br/>
with their parents), or go to bars or sit in the park. I don&#39;t mind him going <br/>
out I love to see him happy with friends and they are welcome in our home ( but <br/>
when they have dinner with us, they go out after 10-11pm). During those nights <br/>
out he drinks between 10-20 beers. he is open about it, and I am open about it <br/>
that I think that that is much. and that I would rather have him drink less. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t drive a car (goes about on his bike) comes home savely, doesn&#39;t puke or <br/>
has a very bad temper the next day. But he has many colds and grows a beer <br/>
belly.<br/>
This morning when I woke and could smell the beer around him I felt so angry. <br/>
But I realize that behind my anger is fear, for him, for me not knowing how to <br/>
handle this, for not doing enough, and sadness. I don&#39;t think it has to do with <br/>
my illness and the troubling time we have had with it, because it started way <br/>
before that. He likes the feeling being slightly drunk gives him. The more <br/>
outgoing extravert man he becomes, he likes the fun of it and says he can handle <br/>
it all and for me not to worry. So I didn&#39;t act out in anger, just said sleep <br/>
well and dicided to write this letter.<br/>
Does anybody have a advice for me, sees things I don&#39;t see? <br/>
greetings, Josh</div>

 </span></blockquote>Realistically, you need a way to handle your own feelings about it. You can&#39;t stop him. You can create a situation where he feels a need to be sneaky about drinking, or where he decides he&#39;d rather move out and go on drinking, but you don&#39;t have to do those things. <br/>
<br/>
For years George drank - sometimes just one or two beers, sometimes, if he was in a rotten mood a whole twelve pack, sometimes more than that. Twelve beers wasn&#39;t enough for George to be drunk, that might give you an indication of how regular a drinker he was. He wasn&#39;t abusive, wasn&#39;t an ass when he&#39;d drink a lot, just sort of lethargic. I never gave him any kind of hassle about drinking and the vast majority of the time he didn&#39;t ask me to buy it for him. I&#39;m generally pretty kind to George, we have a warm, friendly relationship with lots of mutual care in it. A few years back he decided to stop drinking and did, just like that. He said he decided it was a lousy strategy for dealing with his funky moods, that it was effecting his health and leaving him less available for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite aunty has (had?) a drinking problem - she used to get drunk when she was unhappy. Its a different sort of issue than someone who &quot;drinks too much&quot;. She would get out of control, get hurt, lash out verbally at other people. Her husband is gentle and supportive, didn&#39;t give her grief for her drinking, although he confessed to me that he worried about that. Last year she decided to go to treatment and hasn&#39;t had any alcohol to drink since, even in the sorts of circumstances that would have sent her to the bottle in the past - she&#39;s learning to handle her problems in other ways. <br/>
<br/>
People stop drinking because they choose to. It doesn&#39;t have to be a traumatic process of &quot;hitting bottom&quot; the way AA makes it out to be. Given kindness and a comfortable life, people can choose to change. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can feel those things without making your son responsible for them. You don&#39;t have to agree with all his decisions, or think they&#39;re all the greatest decisions in order to be supportive. It will help him more if you can be supportive of him and not put down his decisions. If he wanted to do something dangerous - my brother used to race bicycles and now is an amature car racer, not exactly the safest of hobbies - you could be scared for him and supportive of him at the same time. In a way, his decision to go out drinking with friends is that kind of decision. It has risks, but chances are your son knows those risks. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108447434">-=-He is 18, finished highschool last summer (he didn&#39;t choose  <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re not asking about an unschooling situation, though, as he went  <br/>
to school.<br/>
He went to school his whole life so far, and now he has a job (that&#39;s  <br/>
good) and he lives at home (that&#39;s good), and he&#39;s old enough to drink  <br/>
legally, right?<br/>
<br/>
And he has friends!<br/>
<br/>
You could shame and complain until he stops being honest or moves  <br/>
out.  Most parents would do that, at least in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
I think at this point, if he&#39;s not driving under the influence of  <br/>
alcohol, he&#39;s not passing out in the gutter, and he&#39;s paying for his  <br/>
own entertainment, let it go without comment.   Or maybe a &quot;be  <br/>
careful,&quot; or &quot;I worry about you&quot; kind of nice mom comment, not  <br/>
warnings and threats.<br/>
<br/>
I did talk to my kids about drinking contests.  There are some party  <br/>
games that involve TOO Much drinking, in contests to see who can drink  <br/>
the most.  I told them people could die, and it&#39;s a waste of money and  <br/>
takes a toll on their bodies, and it might be a good idea to decide  <br/>
early to just let other people win.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby turned 21 (the drinking age here) he got a bottle of  <br/>
tequila as one of his gifts, from a friend.  A month later when he  <br/>
moved to Texas, it hadn&#39;t been opened and he didn&#39;t take it with him.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is 21.  He drinks more than Kirby did, but at home when he&#39;s  <br/>
watching movies or playing games with friends, they drink Dr. Pepper  <br/>
and Coke, or more likely water.  Unless it&#39;s a specific party with the  <br/>
intention to drink (three or four of those a year), they don&#39;t even  <br/>
have a beer.   But when he goes to other people&#39;s houses, who went to  <br/>
school and who grew up with tons of rules and parental trouble,  <br/>
they&#39;re more likely to be drinking.   When he goes out to karaoke at  <br/>
the Irish pub (because that&#39;s how it is in New Mexico &lt;g&gt;), he drinks  <br/>
some.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Josh, <br/>
<br/>
I feel for you. But really there is no way anyone but your son can say if he has a drinking problem. But it sounds like you&#39;re having a problem with it. <br/>
<br/>
Alanon Family Groups help the family & friends deal with their feeling & focus regarding other people&#39;s drinking. Alanon is a 12-step program for the family, like AA is for the drinkers. If you can&#39;t find a local meeting to attend, there is literature and there are online groups too. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As he&#39;s single that may be a true statement.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent&#39;s drinking is endangering children and risking the  <br/>
continuation of a family, that&#39;s a problem.  That doesn&#39;t mean the  <br/>
family can declare that the problem drinker should stop, but there is  <br/>
such a thing as an intervention.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that with an 18 year old it&#39;s a whole different deal.  Most 18  <br/>
year olds are drinking, I think, outside the Moslem world.  More drink  <br/>
if they were limited until that time, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
When an age is dangled in front of someone for years, &quot;When you&#39;re X  <br/>
you can do Y,&quot; then it&#39;s pretty well certain they will want to do  <br/>
that, or feel deprived if they don&#39;t.   It&#39;s a natural reaction.<br/>
<br/>
My kids drank when they were younger, at parties.   I knew.  They  <br/>
didn&#39;t keep it secret.  And so because of that, they were open to  <br/>
discussing the details.  When Holly was in Canada and was legal  <br/>
drinking age, she went out one night, but another night she was on the  <br/>
way to the club and saw some younger teens skateboarding in a parking  <br/>
lot and hung out there with them instead.   No desperation.  No &quot;need.&quot;<br/>

Great! what more do you want from him??<br/>
In my similar experience it was good to remember what i was like at 18. Also good to look at the part alcohol played in my life (ive been in AA for 25 years but thats a whole other story except i can put my hand on my heart and say &quot;There is plenty help if and when YOU decide its a problem for you&quot;...<br/>
Then i role model self care and get on with the business of living my life..<br/>

--- Thanks everyone for your reactions. I helped me put it in perspective and <br/>
made a great talk with my husband who lately started nagging him and that <br/>
worried me. We feel we can trust Olaf with  everything else so we decided to <br/>
trust him with this as well.<br/>
