<div id="ygrps-yiv-282678119">Update on our oldest daughter&#39;s adventures in Toronto -- Nike is<br/>
thrilled with the coursework at the Academy<br/>
(www.academyofrealistart.com) and the big city life.  Our Southern<br/>
girl is really warming up to winter in the Great White North, too<br/>
(though she&#39;ll only be dreaming of a White Christmas once she returns<br/>
for a visit to the land o&#39; sunshine, where the orange and palm trees<br/>
sway, just like in LA...) We really appreciate all the advice and<br/>
encouragement that came from so many corners of our world while we<br/>
were preparing for the big move last summer -- we couldn&#39;t be more<br/>
pleased with her decision :)<br/>
