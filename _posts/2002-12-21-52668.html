<br/>
&gt; Happy Holidays to all you unschooling parents and families! I have a<br/>
subject<br/>

from.<br/>

does<br/>
&gt; staying connected with your teen become smothering? She seems to have WAY<br/>
&gt; more freedom then any of the other teens we&#39;ve met here, even though<br/>
several<br/>
&gt; of them are unschoolers. Okay, there were a couple of  &quot;incidents&quot;, one<br/>
&gt; involving hand holding, and another involving  a truth or dare Jenga game<br/>
(I<br/>
&gt; hadn&#39;t played it with her, or looked at it after it came out of the box).<br/>
&gt; Both of these &quot;incidents&quot; were very brief, lasting about 5 mins. before an<br/>
&gt; adult became involved. Do I have a perverse child? Am I an unaware parent?<br/>
I<br/>

&gt; Although what that would be I&#39;m not sure...I&#39;m being vague in case some<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20134">Kristen, I love you! Thanks for your response-I have been feeling that I am<br/>
the only parent in the whole world who isn&#39;t, as you said, assuming all<br/>
children are evil! It&#39;s good to know that I am not alone, and that other<br/>
people also parent from the perspective that our children are to be trusted!<br/>
thanks again for boo hissing along with me! I&#39;m going to keep on trusting<br/>
that she can make good decisions for her life-what, when , how she learns<br/>
everything!<br/>
Happy Holidays,<br/>

<br/>
What I , and my teens , find difficult is when people don&#39;t treat the teens in their family as reasonable beings. You know, I sometimes don&#39;t agree with my teens&#39; choices but we talk about as rational people. Yet, my older boys are interstate atm, staying with another hs family and going to a formal ball. They have, in turn, invited the young people from that family back, in January, to spend a weekend with us and attend yet another ball. But, the father in the other family is saying no - it costs too much  to fly - this is in spite of the fact that the oldest two are 18 and 20 and are paying their own way. The father isn&#39;t discussing this - he is forbidding it! Makes my boys see red - they are used to discussing things ad infinitum in our family... I think our discussions are really valuable and erlevant to their lives now and  to their futures - to us, it is important to treat teens as reasonable beings, not as the enemy or a problem.....Leonie W. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-427585878">I&#39;ve been away from here for nearly 24 hours, and I have a lot of reading to <br/>
do, but about teens and e-mail, I don&#39;t check on my kids.  I don&#39;t know their <br/>
passwords.  They do know mine.  They don&#39;t check on me either.  <br/>
<br/>
I joined NeoPets yesterday because Marty wouldn&#39;t let me play his games! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
(and I figured I could give him some of my stuff, because he cards and I <br/>
don&#39;t).   They asked for a street address, and I gave it to them.  The site&#39;s <br/>
on some other continent, I think.  Also my address is a matter of public <br/>
record, and it&#39;s in the phone book, and you can put it in Mapquest and get a <br/>
map to my house.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids were telling people in instant message how to get to our house, <br/>
and what time would be good to sneak in in the dark, that would be horrible.  <br/>
But they wouldn&#39;t ever do anything so stupid.<br/>
<br/>
The internet horror stories I&#39;ve heard seemed always to involve a teenager <br/>
who was profoundly unhappy and whose parents weren&#39;t communicating with them, <br/>
or kids who were frequently grounded and stuck in their rooms, and so ANYONE <br/>
with a plan to get them out and to listen to them seemed like a glowing <br/>
savior.    In a case where kids are treated as people and communications with <br/>
their family are good, why would some online person seem more attractive than <br/>
people they know and trust?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t get excited about addresses being out there.  Paranoia and instilled <br/>
fear definitely hurt kids.  They can be wise and careful without being <br/>
terrified.<br/>

<br/>
Same here.. and I agree with everything else you said about &quot;Internet safety&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I dont want to make light of anyones fears of Internet predators or <br/>
security risks, but , in fact that are pretty minimal.  If someone wants to <br/>
find out your ( or your teens) address, phone number, etc.. they can easily <br/>
without you divulging it.   Folks on the Internet are no more &quot;risky&quot; than <br/>
folks in real life.    My kids have unrestricted access to the Internet.    <br/>
Landon has 150 names on his buddy list!!.. But, he only talks to about 30 of <br/>
them.. And, they are all mutual acquaintances of his real time friends ( whom <br/>
are the majority of who he talks to online)  I think its great that he can <br/>
has the opportunity to extend his  involvement with others to the far corners <br/>
of the world.  He doesnt go into chat rooms, ( except to goof off, like in <br/>
the beanie babies chat room.. thats another story. lol)  He much perfers the <br/>
one on one of email or instant messanger.    We REALLY need to get another <br/>
computer!  This one is hard to spread around between 6 people.<br/>

    Subject: Teens?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    &gt; Happy Holidays to all you unschooling parents and families! I have a<br/>
    subject<br/>
    &gt; I&#39;d love some input from this list on, especially Sandra and Tuck&#39;s<br/>
    wisdom.<br/>
    &gt; We re in a new community, very conservative compared to where we came<br/>
    from.<br/>
    &gt; My oldest dd became a teen over the summer. The question I have is when<br/>
    does<br/>
    &gt; staying connected with your teen become smothering? She seems to have WAY<br/>
    &gt; more freedom then any of the other teens we&#39;ve met here, even though<br/>
    several<br/>
    &gt; of them are unschoolers. Okay, there were a couple of  &quot;incidents&quot;, one<br/>
    &gt; involving hand holding, and another involving  a truth or dare Jenga game<br/>
    (I<br/>
    &gt; hadn&#39;t played it with her, or looked at it after it came out of the box).<br/>
    &gt; Both of these &quot;incidents&quot; were very brief, lasting about 5 mins. before an<br/>
    &gt; adult became involved. Do I have a perverse child? Am I an unaware parent?<br/>
    I<br/>
    &gt; try to keep my relationship with her based on mutual trust, but it seems<br/>
    &gt; like everyone here is hovering, waiting for something awful to happen.<br/>
    &gt; Although what that would be I&#39;m not sure...I&#39;m being vague in case some<br/>
    one<br/>
    &gt; on this list happens to be one of those parents, but really, now that I&#39;m<br/>
    &gt; typing it, it was that innocent. Give me some feedback!!<br/>
    &gt; Robyn, wearing a disguise as I type :-))<br/>
    &gt;<br/>

I understood that.. I think we sort of got off on an Internet &quot;tangent&quot;  As <br/>
far as teens supervision ( or lack thereof)  My 16  yo son doesnt really have <br/>
any supervision when he goes out.   I trust him and I trust his judgement.  <br/>
He always calls to let me know if he&#39;s going to be out later than he <br/>
expected.   I know which of his friends engage in behavior that entails bad <br/>
choice. He has called me to come get him before when he was sick of being <br/>
around pot smokers.   I took him to meet a friend (Matt) yesterday ( who <br/>
happens to be 20, and in college) and Matt  was supposed to bring him home <br/>
last night.. Around 11 last night, Landon called and said they were at a <br/>
local coffee shop and the he decided to just spend the night with Matt.  That <br/>
was fine with me.  Matt brought him home this morning and he told me all <br/>
about what they did yesterday. ( well what he wanted to share, that is.. lol) <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
I believe you said your daughter is 13. My daughter, Anna is 13 too.  Her <br/>
social activties include sleepovers with her friends, or days out with them.. <br/>
or them coming over here.   There are usually parents around somewhere as we <br/>
have to chauffer them around. .lol.. but we dont hang around unless the girls <br/>
want us to.   I am not really clear on what happened with the &quot;incidents&quot; <br/>
with your daughter.. You mentioned hand holding.. Gee, thats what 13 yos do.. <br/>
:-)     I dont know what is perverse at all about that.   I remember playing <br/>
spin the bottle when I was that age..  ( gosh, what fun.. hehe)  I think as <br/>
long as you are open and accepting of your daughter, she will give you the <br/>
clues as to how much she needs you around.   I took Anna to her first dance <br/>
in October.  She wanted me to stay.  I had planned on just dropping her off, <br/>
but staying was cool too..  There were others mothers there that had INSISTED <br/>
on staying.    Anna asked me to stay, I think she just felt more comfortable <br/>
with me &quot;there&quot;  And the kids all got a big kick out of disco Moma, cuz I <br/>
sure didnt sit around and gossip with the other mothers.about how some <br/>
mothers just dropped thier kids off and had no idea what goes on in thier <br/>
lives.  I was thinking.. What IS going on?? they are dancing for goodness <br/>
sakes!  . LOL  We both had a lot of fun, and I got the nickname &quot;Dancing <br/>
Queen&quot;  The next day, Anna went over to her friend Lauren&#39;s house and they <br/>
went to a Halloween party at another friends house.. I dont know the girl or <br/>
her parents, but they had a lot of fun.   Maybe I am too trusting, but I just <br/>
know my kids well enough to know that they will do the right thing..And if <br/>
the don&#39;t. they know that I am here to help them through it, not judge them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758220563">Yes, and this has been an occurrence here too to some degree.  My son and a girl in VA exchanged phone numbers.  I don&#39;t have a problem with that, but we don&#39;t really know who this girl is, or if she&#39;s really in VA, or even if she&#39;s really a &quot;girl&quot; and not someone else.<br/>
<br/>
My kids would be the ones who would make arrangements like the one with the movie theater because its &quot;exciting&quot;.  I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with how things are at home.  Its just one more thrill, and my kids are thrill seekers.<br/>
<br/>
Our street address is *not* in the phone book, nor is it available online.  And whatever address we have is associated with my husband&#39;s name, or mine...not the kids&#39;.  I plan on keeping it that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752879019">Hiya Teresa;<br/>
I was the one that started the original thread about Teens, and I wasn&#39;t<br/>
talking about Internet stuff, although it&#39;s okay with me that we&#39;ve gone<br/>
there, too. It&#39;s good to hear that their are other parents out there who<br/>
don&#39;t feel they must be with their children every minute. my daughter has<br/>
always had freedom to be with her friends, sometimes with me there, too, but<br/>
often without me. I mean in her room, or at the skating rink, Kmart, the<br/>
movies. I have always trusted her, and when she&#39;s needed information or help<br/>
she&#39;s asked me for it. As I said, we are in a new community, and the parents<br/>
here are not as relaxed. Not relaxed at all, and i don&#39;t get what they think<br/>
these kids are going to do. My daughter was &quot;caught&quot; holding hands with a 12<br/>
year old boy at the movies, when the mother turned who&#39;d taken them turned<br/>
around and they both jumped. This has now turned into a really big deal,<br/>
with the boys mother not wanting them to be together. I&#39;ve also heard that<br/>
other girls have been told not to be in my daughters bedroom when a boy is<br/>
there with them, too. And, friends of hers, girls, that are younger have<br/>
been forbidden to play with her anymore, &quot;because she&#39;s at a different<br/>
stage&quot;! I am mostly shocked that homeschooling, unschooling parents are this<br/>
way, whatever way this is. What about trust? The infamous &quot;Jenga incident&quot;,<br/>
was blown way out of proportion, too. It was the Truth or Dare version,<br/>
which wasn&#39;t really the one dd had wanted, but was the only one the store<br/>
had when we went to get it. Nothing happened when the game came out at a<br/>
party dd was having, with about 8 or 9 teens, 2 or 3 of them boys. But, the<br/>
two parents who had stayed (one of them completely afraid to let her<br/>
daughters out of her sight EVER!), freaked out. It&#39;s an adult game! it&#39;s<br/>
inappropriate! it&#39;s not wholesome! so, I&#39;ve been feeling like a completely<br/>
checked out mom, who doesn&#39;t supervise my child&#39;s every move. No one from<br/>
our old community was this way at all-okay, there was one weird dad who<br/>
insisted his daughters go everywhere together, and he&#39;d wait in the car<br/>
outside while they played at a friends, but we all knew he was weird. Okay,<br/>
enough ranting for now. Thanks for listening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934036873">Hmmmm,<br/>
<br/>
Now see, I *do* find that when my kids and their friends (who are the opposite sex) spend time together &quot;alone&quot; in the house (like in the basement) they are doing things they ought not to be doing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve caught them on a few occasions doing more than just holding hands.<br/>
<br/>
So, I did trust them initially, but they have broken that trust and due to the fact that the *other* kids very often don&#39;t have the same freedoms mine have, I&#39;m thinking that they are exploiting the freedom in my house to do some &quot;interactive exploring&quot; that otherwise might not occur.  <br/>

  Hiya Teresa;<br/>
  I was the one that started the original thread about Teens, and I wasn&#39;t<br/>
  talking about Internet stuff, although it&#39;s okay with me that we&#39;ve gone<br/>
  there, too. It&#39;s good to hear that their are other parents out there who<br/>
  don&#39;t feel they must be with their children every minute. my daughter has<br/>
  always had freedom to be with her friends, sometimes with me there, too, but<br/>
  often without me. I mean in her room, or at the skating rink, Kmart, the<br/>
  movies. I have always trusted her, and when she&#39;s needed information or help<br/>
  she&#39;s asked me for it. As I said, we are in a new community, and the parents<br/>
  here are not as relaxed. Not relaxed at all, and i don&#39;t get what they think<br/>
  these kids are going to do. My daughter was &quot;caught&quot; holding hands with a 12<br/>
  year old boy at the movies, when the mother turned who&#39;d taken them turned<br/>
  around and they both jumped. This has now turned into a really big deal,<br/>
  with the boys mother not wanting them to be together. I&#39;ve also heard that<br/>
  other girls have been told not to be in my daughters bedroom when a boy is<br/>
  there with them, too. And, friends of hers, girls, that are younger have<br/>
  been forbidden to play with her anymore, &quot;because she&#39;s at a different<br/>
  stage&quot;! I am mostly shocked that homeschooling, unschooling parents are this<br/>
  way, whatever way this is. What about trust? The infamous &quot;Jenga incident&quot;,<br/>
  was blown way out of proportion, too. It was the Truth or Dare version,<br/>
  which wasn&#39;t really the one dd had wanted, but was the only one the store<br/>
  had when we went to get it. Nothing happened when the game came out at a<br/>
  party dd was having, with about 8 or 9 teens, 2 or 3 of them boys. But, the<br/>
  two parents who had stayed (one of them completely afraid to let her<br/>
  daughters out of her sight EVER!), freaked out. It&#39;s an adult game! it&#39;s<br/>
  inappropriate! it&#39;s not wholesome! so, I&#39;ve been feeling like a completely<br/>
  checked out mom, who doesn&#39;t supervise my child&#39;s every move. No one from<br/>
  our old community was this way at all-okay, there was one weird dad who<br/>
  insisted his daughters go everywhere together, and he&#39;d wait in the car<br/>
  outside while they played at a friends, but we all knew he was weird. Okay,<br/>
  enough ranting for now. Thanks for listening.<br/>

their parents don&#39;t want them to do.  I&#39;m thinking of some of the things I<br/>
did, like waiting until the rest of the family had gone to bed, then<br/>
sneaking up to my attic room with my boyfriend to spend the night.  I&#39;d go<br/>
down and have breakfast with the family, then my boyfriend would come down<br/>
when they&#39;d all left the house, as if he had just arrived at the house that<br/>
day.  (This was age 16.)  Since my son is likely to be able to &quot;get away&quot;<br/>
with just about anything he really wants to do, I&#39;d rather just trust him to<br/>
do the right thing.<br/>
The one most important thing my mother did with me was let me know that she<br/>
believed in me, that I would stay out of trouble, that I could get myself<br/>
out of trouble if I did get into any, and that I would know to ask for help<br/>
if I couldn&#39;t.  I didn&#39;t always live up to those beliefs, but I think I did<br/>
better that way than if she had been constantly on my case.  (I think she<br/>
would have been ok with my becoming sexually active if I&#39;d told her, but my<br/>
sister had scared me by saying I&#39;d be grounded forever if she found out.)<br/>

<br/>
I think those parents are making such a big deal out of nothing. Holding <br/>
hands and Truth or Dare Jenga???? Please, how stupid is that to get upset <br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
I think you are right in seeing it as no big deal. Too bad your daughter has <br/>
to suffer for it though by kids not being allowed to be around her. I would <br/>
say try real hard to find her some new friends. They are going to make your <br/>
poor daughter paranoid about nothing.<br/>

  Oh I agree with you Sandra.  I was just pointing out that although we had the same safety concerns, we each handled it differently, and it made a difference in how our kids responded to us.<br/>
  I can see seeds of rebellion being planted and I can see what is coming down the road.  That child confides in me when she should be able to confide in her parents.<br/>
<br/>
  That is not to say I&#39;m perfect, far from it!!!! In fact, I reverted back to my old ways just today with my daughter so now I have to go talk to her about that ;o)<br/>

&lt;&lt; My daughter was &quot;caught&quot; holding hands with a 12<br/>
year old boy at the movies, when the mother turned who&#39;d taken them turned<br/>
around and they both jumped. This has now turned into a really big deal,<br/>
with the boys mother not wanting them to be together.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m uncharitable in this kind of summary, but generalizing from <br/>
everyone I went to school with, my sister&#39;s friends who got in trouble, the <br/>
batch of homeschoolers who have grown into teens with my kids, etc., I truly <br/>
and honestly think this:<br/>
<br/>
It is much more likely that the actions cited above, making a big deal about <br/>
handholding, will lead to teen pregnancy or impregnation WAY sooner than a <br/>
lighter attitude about teens growing up.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s nothing to be sneaky about, kids won&#39;t be sneaky.  IF they have to <br/>
be TOTALLY sneaky even to stand and lean on a wall with a kid of the opposite <br/>
sex, if NOTHING they do is okay, and the parents won&#39;t really discuss or <br/>
consider it, just say NO to them, then once they&#39;re sneaking, why should they <br/>
limit themselves to just holding hands?  They will have an urgency and a <br/>
desperation (and an ignorance, in many cases) that the kids whose parents are <br/>
calm and open couldn&#39;t even imagine having.    <br/>
<br/>
Privileges doled out in small doses make that thing (whether it&#39;s dating or <br/>
food or video games or anything) seem HUGEly important an valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another example on the video game evidence.  Two boys who come over <br/>
sometimes, the younger brothers of one of Holly&#39;s friends, always played <br/>
video games every single time they came over.  They might hang out with Holly <br/>
and their sister, too, maybe 1/3 of the time or less, or go out in the yard, <br/>
but their main interest here was video games. <br/>
<br/>
Friday they were being babysat, in my absence while I went to a movie with my <br/>
husband and Marty.  So Holly was here, these three kids, and two teens I <br/>
arranged with to come and hang out.  The boy of the teens was prepared to <br/>
help them get video games set up, whichever system they wanted.<br/>
<br/>
They kids were in the library making up a play to videotape.  When the teens <br/>
got here, they went up, took a look, the kids were totally engrossed in their <br/>
project, and Holly didn&#39;t even think to introduce them to their babysitter <br/>
(one of the aforementioned unschooled kids, who&#39;s 18 now).  <br/>
<br/>
So the teens went and played video games in Kirby&#39;s room.<br/>
<br/>
Side note:  The kids are 16 and 18.  A boy and a girl.  Their parents knew <br/>
they might be with a member of the opposite sex with no adult supervision <br/>
(they WERE the &quot;adult supervision&quot;) but neither parent probably even thought <br/>
for a second.  Usually the girls, and maybe one or three other girls, is over <br/>
here with three to seven teenaged boys and older anyway---<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So...  it turned out that althought the four younger kids broke for lunch <br/>
three hours into the four hours (commenting that they were surprised it was <br/>
already 1:00 and they should eat), they went back in the library and finished <br/>
their movie, which runs about six minutes and is really funny.<br/>
<br/>
Neither boy asked to play video games.  Neither said &quot;video games.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here is why:<br/>
A few weeks ago they got a Playstation.  Just a used Playstation I, but <br/>
because they have video games at their house now, our house has opened up to <br/>
limitless possibilities, instead of just the desperate grab for video-game <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
And the same with mixed-groups of teenagers.  If they&#39;re used to being with <br/>
kids of the opposite sex, they&#39;re willing to do LOTS of things when they get <br/>
one-on-one instead of just hold hands or be mushy.  And if they assume/trust <br/>
that they will get to be with those kids again whenever it can be arranged <br/>
without the parents freaking out, they will be WAY more calm about what they <br/>
do or don&#39;t do on any given day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691580670">AAAhhhhh finally.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at work now and this darn webmail is really full of glitches.  <br/>
<br/>
I did a lot of thinking on the way to work (after I talked with my <br/>
daughter).  I think too, that kids already do make their own <br/>
decisions.  They do what is important to them, no matter how much we <br/>
adults think we are in control.  <br/>
<br/>
The only difference between our kids and those who are more restricted <br/>
is how much information they give us.  The flow of information is <br/>
entirely dependent on trust.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep what you said in mind Sandra.  I truly don&#39;t mind if my kids <br/>
make friends on the net or talk to each other on the phone, etc.  I <br/>
think its neat that the entire world is their playground.  And <br/>
honestly, I&#39;ve set an example myself because I actually took my kids <br/>
and stayed overnight with a family we only knew from online!!!   <br/>
Actually we&#39;ve done that 3 times with 3 different families!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
They usually always tell me whats going on, so I guess I am still <br/>
shedding that thinking that kids can&#39;t judge character well, and will <br/>
automatically find mischief without me there to butt in LOL.  Its <br/>
interesting to become aware of this kind of thinking in every day stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853936402">Parents are often the MOST uptight when kids are 11 to 13 or so, though <br/>
- so maybe it is not JUST your new location, but also that your <br/>
daughter has hit that age. I saw it with both of my older girls&#39; <br/>
friends and now am seeing it starting with my younger daughter&#39;s <br/>
friends, to some degree. She is 11 and her closest friends are 11 to 14.<br/>
<br/>
Partly it is fear of the kids growing up -- it is scary, when you have <br/>
a sweet little 10 yo kid, to imagine the stuff that kid is going to <br/>
have to deal with very very very soon. An 11 yo who is friends with <br/>
people of all ages (as most of our kids are) is going to soon be <br/>
hearing stuff about sex and drugs and hearing profanity, etc., and that <br/>
can be so unsettling to us  parents who (understandably) want to <br/>
protect our kids and prolong their childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Also it is not knowing, yet, how to cope with losing control over their <br/>
kids. We HAVE to do it - we HAVE to give up control - or we&#39;re going to <br/>
face huge rebellion issues or create huge problems in our kids&#39; lives <br/>
that they&#39;ll have to work out as adults. But, still, it is often really <br/>
hard to accept that it is time to begin to let go - to begin to let the <br/>
kids make mistakes on their own, for example, because it is a guarantee <br/>
that allowing freedom means allowing them to make mistakes. Many <br/>
parents mentally go from &quot;they will make mistakes&quot; right into &quot;some <br/>
mistakes can be deadly&quot; -- and so they become too fearful to gradually <br/>
let go.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters friends - 3 or 4 girls and 4 or 5 boys  - have wanted to <br/>
have a big sleepover somewhere. One of the moms told her kid &quot;No way - <br/>
you guys are too old for sleepovers.&quot; The kids didn&#39;t get what she <br/>
meant - &quot;too old???&quot; I&#39;m guessing she meant too old for mixed gender <br/>
sleepovers.<br/>
<br/>
I guess people of young teens just don&#39;t realize or can&#39;t envision that <br/>
their kids and their friends will be driving in just such a few short <br/>
years and that they will then have their own &quot;space on wheels&quot; and can <br/>
pretty much do anything they might want to do. There is simply no such <br/>
thing as &quot;parental control&quot; over a kid who has access to a car. So, if <br/>
for no other reason, it behooves parents to establish a climate of <br/>
trust and confidence and openness and willingness to listen to <br/>
anything, right then while their kids are young teens. That is the <br/>
critical time, imo, to get things set up so that the later teen years <br/>
will be safer and happier. What does it tell a 12 or 13 yo boy, for <br/>
example, when he is told he can&#39;t be trusted to be around his friends <br/>
who are female, at night? Not that I don&#39;t know about the sexual <br/>
attractions that are revving up at that age - obviously. But the kids <br/>
and their parents can work those things out when there is trust on both <br/>
sides, when they are talking about this stuff openly. It seems so <br/>
obvious that &quot;control&quot; isn&#39;t going to work - and that it is better to <br/>
begin from early or pre-teen years to build the relationship that <br/>
you&#39;re going to wish for DURING the later teen years - when a <br/>
relationship where parents think they can simply forbid certain <br/>
behaviors is unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
It can be scary to have teenagers moving out into the world where we <br/>
can&#39;t protect them. But when parents react to that fear by trying to <br/>
INCREASE their control over their young teens, I think it is likely to <br/>
hurt their relationship with their child and that is much worse. It is <br/>
the existence of an essentially strong relationship that is critical - <br/>
much more  critical than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times what I see is parents increasing or fighting to keep <br/>
control in the early teen years and then the kid cutting the parent OUT <br/>
of their real life in later teen years and adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
All that by way of saying that what you&#39;re dealing with is likely to be <br/>
people who are in this stage of reacting to the fear of their kid <br/>
growing up by trying to control them as much as they can, right now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to handle it except to accept it and explain it to my <br/>
own kid the best I can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169847192">Would they not even tell you? They&#39;d go to a theater under false <br/>
pretenses - with a group - but intending to meet some internet buddies?<br/>
<br/>
That is not thrill-seeking - that is not understanding standard safe <br/>
living and not sharing something with parents.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters (and I) have met LOTS of people over the internet. Heck, I <br/>
met Sandra that way - after reading stuff she was writing on the old <br/>
AOL hsing boards, I read that she was coming to Los Angeles and I <br/>
insisted on going to the airport and picking her and her family up and <br/>
taking them to their hotel.<br/>
<br/>
My 15 yo talks on the phone occasionally to her internet buddies? These <br/>
are people she has gotten to know online - not strangers. She isn&#39;t <br/>
doing it secretly. She&#39;s saying, &quot;MOM -- guess WHAT?? My friend Ingrid <br/>
is going to call me from Norway on Sunday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Long ago we talked about online safety -- they are sensible and savvy <br/>
and there is not going to be any sneaking around to meet anybody <br/>
they&#39;ve met online. But we&#39;ve had people come stay at our house -- <br/>
people the kids only knew online before that. It has worked out well - <br/>
some have become good friends and other online friendships faded away <br/>
after in-person meetings.<br/>

trouble.  My dh and I, after we were engaged, became sexually active.  I was <br/>
17, and had been a virgin.  My mother sort of instinctively knew.  One day <br/>
she asked me outright if we were having sex.  I couldnt lie.. I told her, <br/>
yeah, we were.. . I&#39;ll never forget the disappointment my mother showed.  She <br/>
didnt preach or condemn or judge me, she just hugged me and cried.  She said, <br/>
I just wish you had waited.. I said, I know Mom. but.. we didnt.... And that <br/>
was that.    My sister, otoh, became very sexually active since she at 16.  <br/>
Once when my sister was a Sr in High School, Mom found a used condom in the  <br/>
trash can in her bedroom(she still cleaned up after her)!!.. I know that that <br/>
scenario wasnt as touching as the one between Mom and me when she found out I <br/>
was having sex.   Ive said before, that to me, My mother is the epitome of <br/>
perfection as a Mother.  (OK, OK, she&#39;s not perfect, but shes pretty darn <br/>
close :-)<br/>

female friends.  He has very close friends of each sex. .. He&#39;s been to <br/>
sleepovers with girls and boys when he was as young as 13, and, some of his <br/>
friends still crash together at someones house occasionally.  Girls are not a <br/>
big mystery to him.  He&#39;s not had sex yet, but I think he&#39;s getting antsy ( <br/>
lol)   My hope is that he will wait til hes at least 18...(fingers crossed)  <br/>
But, I know there is really nothing I can do to stop him from having sex if <br/>
he decides to do it.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband, who got teenagers before he got a baby, put it something like <br/>
this.  Parents only have a short time of control, but the opportunity to have <br/>
influence forever.  At some point, you have to give up control, because <br/>
through insisting on control, you eventually lose your influence, as well.  <br/>
<br/>
You may control your child until the minute they turn 18, and I know lots of <br/>
people do.  But what&#39;s the possibility that a child like that is going to let <br/>
you continue after they don&#39;t have to?  Child moves out, cuts you off, and <br/>
you no longer have influence OR control.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather be an influential person in my children&#39;s lives well into their <br/>
adulthood, then have control of something as trivial in the long term as <br/>
clothing or food choices, friend preferences or whatever.<br/>

&gt; Hi Kristen - Recently, due to an emergency, I had to find an old <br/>
&gt; friend<br/>
&gt; who I had completely lost touch with and within two days I had his <br/>
&gt; cell<br/>
&gt; phone number in Latvia thanks to the Internet, so I was curious <br/>
&gt; when I<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; saw this to see if indeed it would be impossible to find you.  Within<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; about a minute and a half I found the town you live in ( I assume it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you - if you&#39;ve signed for separation of school and state).  Another<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; minute and I had your address and phone number (if your husband&#39;s name<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; is Daniel).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s a mistake to assume that if you don&#39;t directly give out<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; your address no one will be able to find it.   I think we could find<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; just about anyone given enough motivation and time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope you don&#39;t mind my experiment - I&#39;ve always figured it didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; really matter what personal info we gave out on the computer, and <br/>
&gt; wanted<br/>
&gt; to test my hypothesis.  If you really are untraceable, and I found the<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; wrong Kristen, feel free to give me an &quot;I told you so&quot; <br/>
&gt; :0.  ~Rue <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The way someone would  trace your kids  to your address is from  your ISP.  <br/>
Tracing ISP&#39;s are pretty easy for even for amatuer hackers.  Heck, you dont <br/>
even have to be a hacker, just use Neotrace.. Then you get the name and <br/>
address of the person that owns ( uses) a particular computer.   Every <br/>
computer has a number that can trace you back to the ISP.  But, my point is, <br/>
even though folks CAN trace names and numbers, I dont feel its any more of a <br/>
risk than meeting folks in real life.. <br/>
