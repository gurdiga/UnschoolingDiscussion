<div id="ygrps-yiv-319290808">Hi.  I have just recently joined this list and have enjoyed the discussion<br/>
so far.  My name is Nicole.  I am 32 years old.  I have been married to the<br/>
most awesome Brad for a little over 14 years.  We have seven awesome sons<br/>
and one angel in heaven.  I just recently miscarried at 9 weeks.  We would<br/>
like to try again very soon.  We live in Idaho.  <br/>
I just started homeschooling my boys last year and so far, it seems as if we<br/>
are failing misserably.  So I have really started looking into the <br/>
unschooling&quot; side of it.  The biggest problem I am having with it is my<br/>
oldest has been in school for quite a while now and feels like he&#39;s not<br/>
learning if we aren&#39;t doing something structured all of the time.  He&#39;s<br/>
always asking me &quot;What can I do mom...&quot;  UGH.... HATE that question. <br/>
Yesterday his friends told him he should go to school with them so he could<br/>
be learning.  It would be easiest to just send him back to ps ... but I don<br/>
t feel good or right about that...so I wont.  But it&#39;s a struggle!<br/>
Anyway, I look forward to getting to know more unschooling families and<br/>
learning from some of you veterans!<br/>
Thank you for having me!<br/>
Nicole<br/>

Welcome to the list, Nicole :) As for the kids needing to be told what to <br/>
learn and when, sounds like they need a bit of deschooling time (see <br/>
archives for that, as we were just talking about it :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388690642">Welcome, Nicole...<br/>
&lt;We have seven awesome sons<br/>
and one angel in heaven.  I just recently miscarried at 9 weeks. &gt;<br/>
We have 7 sons and I, too  havehad yet another mniscarriage (  two weekedns ago). :-( Hang in there. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;The biggest problem I am having with it is my<br/>
oldest has been in school for quite a while now andfeels like he&#39;s notlearning if we aren&#39;t doing something structured all of the time. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
I went through this recently with my 9 yo - he has never been to school but he knows many structured homeschooles. Hhe was worried that he wasn&#39;t doing any schoolwork like other kids...I got out my journal and pointed out to him all the great stuff he has been doing lately and the learning thus involved  It really helped him to see he *is learning all the time. Maybe this sort of journalling would help your son - you journal and share your thoughts with him...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;He&#39;salways asking me &quot;What can I do mom...&quot;  UGH.... HATE that question. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have many limits in your home? I only ask this, because I noticed that my kids used to feel restless when there were limits, apart from natural ones!,  on what they could do - when they can watch a video or play the computer or walk to the library etc their options seem limitless and they are less likely to feel restless. If it still happens, I usually suggest something, do something with them ...Leonie W. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731122462">Hi Leonie!  Thanks so much for the welcome!  Sounds like we have a lot in<br/>
common!  If this is too personal, just tell me to take a flying leap:o)  But<br/>
are you going to try again to have another?  The only reason I ask is<br/>
because I want to try again asap and it would be fun to have someone to be<br/>
pregnant with!<br/>
You know, I am afraid I may have too many limits...I&#39;m going to have to<br/>
think that one over!  Thanks for that idea!<br/>
