<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072767110">Hello<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a situation I&#39;d like to see how unschooling would apply.<br/>
<br/>
Your child needs braces, not because of major tooth misalignment, but <br/>
because of a hidden jaw alignment that, if not corrected, will <br/>
develop into TMJ in later life. His smile looks fine, his teeth are <br/>
straight and white...but there is a flaw in his bite that will lead <br/>
to health probs down the road. He doesn&#39;t want braces. He dislikes <br/>
how they look on people and thinks they would be too painful, esp. <br/>
when he can&#39;t see anything wrong with how he looks and no one is <br/>
teasing him about crooked teeth.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have him fitted with braces, anyway? <br/>
<br/>
Also, your child begins to find an interest in higher learning at <br/>
about age 17...he is nearly at the end of his high school years, even <br/>
though he isn&#39;t in any grade or what have you. Now he&#39;s looking into <br/>
going to college. You make just enough money that he won&#39;t qualify <br/>
for aid, but not enough to pay his way. If he&#39;d been working on it <br/>
from an earlier age, he might have the means for a scholarship, or at <br/>
least a high school transcript and a diploma behind him. Now, though, <br/>
he&#39;s desiring to do this but not able to because he doesn&#39;t qualify <br/>
for scholarships. GED&#39;s are a tool, for sure, and so are college <br/>
entrance exams, but there&#39;s no scholarships available for kids <br/>
without a history of doing very well academically.<br/>
<br/>
Work his way through...yeah, that&#39;s an option, for sure. Wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
the first time. But lack of planning in his earlier years has left <br/>
him with FEWER OPTIONS than he would have had, if there&#39;d been some <br/>
structure and some pushing back there. A child may not know himself <br/>
well enough to realize that formal education is something he wants to <br/>
do...MAY not? I&#39;d venture, he WON&#39;T know himself well enough.<br/>
<br/>
What say ye?<br/>

&gt; Heidi<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of kids have gone to college who were unschooled. That&#39;s <br/>
one of the first things I read about as I ventured into this arena. <br/>
Secondly, the options you mentioned (as in scholarships due to <br/>
grades or academic performance) are still a big if. Lots of kids <br/>
go through the steps to finish high school and fulfill <br/>
requirements and *still* don&#39;t qualify for the grants and <br/>
scholarships that you are suggesting.<br/>
<br/>
But lastly, and this is the one that changed everything for me, why <br/>
do we put more weight on preparing against a possible desire <br/>
than on the pursuit of one that is currently self-evident, allowing <br/>
for the possiblity that that very pursuit will be the key to leading a <br/>
child where he/she actually wants to go?!<br/>
<br/>
Recently a mom on a nother forum where I spend a good deal of <br/>
my time talked about her 17 yod who got 1580 on the SATs. This <br/>
girl is completely stumped aout what school to pick and where to <br/>
apply. She doesn&#39;t know what she wants to do with her life and <br/>
is feeling that paralysis that comes before a major decision.<br/>
<br/>
She has optionsÂ—multitudes of them. What she doesn&#39;t ahve is <br/>
clarity. Yet she is the model public schooled kid.<br/>
<br/>
How many of us knew ourselves well after twelve years in &quot;the <br/>
system&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
My hope is that my kids can use this season of their lives to live <br/>
to the fullest in a way that satisfies their innate curiosities. And by <br/>
doing that, we are trusting that at the appropriate hour, they will <br/>
see what it is that will come next.<br/>
<br/>
If it turned out that one of our kids said, &quot;Gee, I really did want to <br/>
go to Princeton and my form of education won&#39;t convince the <br/>
admissions folks that I am qualified, what can I do?&quot; We will go <br/>
for it then. We will face that issue then. That seems profoundly <br/>
logical to me. <br/>
<br/>
(Did you see Rudy? Great movie to see what happens when a <br/>
kid decides what he wants to do and does what it takes to make <br/>
it happen, even at Notre Dame and without money or a good <br/>
high school record.)<br/>
<br/>
Another book that helped me is REAL lives by Grace Llewellyn. I <br/>
love that these kids didn&#39;t even all want college once they had <br/>
found their niche in life. Who knows how our kids will spend their <br/>
early adult years? Simply using the teen years as an insurance <br/>
policy just in case seems such a sad way to approach life.<br/>
<br/>
And fwiw, so far my oldest two do want to go to college so we are <br/>
making decisions accordingly...<br/>

a wonderful, less expensive way to try out &quot;higher learning&quot;. If your child <br/>
doesn&#39;t like it, you or he is not out thousands of dollars. <br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Not only because dentists are so often wrong, but just no.<br/>
<br/>
He can have corrective work done later if he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;GED&#39;s are a tool, for sure, and so are college <br/>
entrance exams, but there&#39;s no scholarships available for kids <br/>
without a history of doing very well academically.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He can go one semester, and if he does well, apply for scholarships on the <br/>
basis of that, explaining why he has no prior transcripts.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But lack of planning in his earlier years has left <br/>
him with FEWER OPTIONS than he would have had, if there&#39;d been some <br/>
structure and some pushing back there.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;d had more structure and pushing aimed toward the possibility of being <br/>
able to apply for scholarships at a college he might not even have wanted to <br/>
attend, what would he have lost in exchange?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;A child may not know himself <br/>
well enough to realize that formal education is something he wants to <br/>
do...MAY not? I&#39;d venture, he WON&#39;T know himself well enough.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I refuse to press my children to live for the possibility of college.  Some <br/>
children die before they&#39;re college age.  I&#39;d rather help them live as though <br/>
they might die tomorrow.  (I&#39;ve never mentioned it, but I do think of a <br/>
friend of mine who killed himself at 14, and I look at my kids, and I don&#39;t <br/>
hassle them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; How many of us knew ourselves well after twelve years in &quot;the <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I did.<br/>
Not BECAUSE of the system, though.  <br/>
I was just a self-knowing kind of kid.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.  That&#39;s like asking &quot;How many of us could have been professional <br/>
musicians at the age of ten?&quot;    Not me, but my friend Marty was playing <br/>
piano for church at 10, and surpassed any piano teacher within 90 miles <br/>
within a couple of years.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because Martha had a HUGE musical intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
And I did interpersonal naturally, and so was really interested in why people <br/>
did what they did, and what they thought they were going to do next, and then <br/>
watching and seeing what they actually DID to next, and why.  And I did the <br/>
same with myself.  I always checked what I thought was going to happen <br/>
against what I really ended up saying or doing, and being analytical about <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
So this question is valid and good:<br/>
<br/>
-=-&lt;&lt; How many of us knew ourselves well after twelve years in &quot;the <br/>
<br/>
system&quot;?  &gt;&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not because of the system, necessarily.  <br/>
<br/>
Interpersonal talent is not rewarded in school at all.  Some kids use it to <br/>
get better grades, to get away with stuff in class, to get out of library <br/>
fines, whatever all...  but generally in school kids with interpersonal <br/>
interests are given bad grades in conduct and told they&#39;re not in school to <br/>
socialize.<br/>
<br/>
So how many kids know themselves well after twelve to eighteen years of <br/>
homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Depends whether their parents have encouraged and drawn out their knowledge <br/>
of such things, I think. <br/>
<br/>
And unschoolers have WAY more chance of doing that successfully for lots of <br/>
reasons, but what springs to mind right away are theshaming him for not <br/>
putting his name in the right place or some other school-specific and <br/>
arbitrary thing.<br/>
He hasn&#39;t become equated with a bundle of test scores and grades.<br/>
He&#39;s had time to think.<br/>
Probably his mom has some knowledge of Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple <br/>
intelligences theory, and is herself aware of whether interpersonal and <br/>
intrapersonal skills are strong in a child or not.<br/>

Plus, it is up t the child. If he changes his mind later then it can be done then.<br/>

What about a part-time degree? Then a young person can work (and earn valuable work experience which employers generally are more interested in than a degree) and attend university.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s never too late though. I skivved off school most of the time but when I was 18 decided I wanted to go to university. I had no qualifications as I failed to turn up to take my O levels at 16. So I<br/>
went to the local college  and obtained some A levels and went to university at 20. I think I did better at university because I had decided to go therefore I really worked and enjoyed it too.<br/>
Universities seem to welcome mature students and often waive the entrance requirements. I was interviewed and they were far more interested in my back-packing round the world than in which exams I took.<br/>

There are so many other ways to reach a destination!<br/>

Nope. :)  Unless they can prove they haven&#39;t lived with you for a couple <br/>
years and you haven&#39;t been supporting them, college tuition is assumed to be <br/>
a parental responsibility. Sucks for kids whose parents have a high income <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801189015">Hi Elissa<br/>
<br/>
These are hypotheticals, but also things that could really happen. <br/>
I&#39;ve seen lots of replies, though. What I&#39;m doing is, trying to get a <br/>
grasp on how far or how deep the &quot;let them choose&quot; goes. I think <br/>
there are scenarios where the parent DOES decide, period. <br/>
<br/>
The braces thing...that&#39;s me. Although in my childhood, my bite was <br/>
not seen as needing braces, because my teeth are straight and strong, <br/>
but my lower jaw is too little. It started clicking in eighth grade <br/>
and still does, and I grind my teeth non-stop, both symptoms of TMJ. <br/>
My molars have cracks in them. Nothing serious at this point, but the <br/>
grinding will lead to greater tooth damage. Get braces now. That is <br/>
an option, and I don&#39;t blame my folks, because the dentist <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;see&quot; the TMJ due to my perfect bite. <br/>
<br/>
Teeth that are straightened in childhood tend to stay aligned. Adult <br/>
bone has hardened, so braces are a longer process and more expensive, <br/>
and may not &quot;take.&quot; I&#39;m not going to get braces, because I can&#39;t <br/>
afford them, but I do consider that not getting them in childhood has <br/>
proven to be a minor health...hassle...that may develop into <br/>
something bigger and too bad, because I can&#39;t afford them, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
anyways, you guys have answered my &quot;hypotheticals&quot; very well. I like <br/>
how this group seems to constantly think outside the box. You&#39;ve been <br/>
good for me.<br/>

 Although,Ive never had this problem.  Anna WANTED braces.. shes in them for <br/>
about  6 more mos.. Her teeth are now beautifully straight.  Only complaints <br/>
she had were wearing rubber bands for a couple of months.. But, she knew that <br/>
if she didnt wear them, well, all would be for naught, and also the time she <br/>
had to wear them would be extended.  Ethan is next in line, and bless his <br/>
heart, he asks me almost weekly when he can get his braces.. His overbite is <br/>
horrible and he feels very self conscience and embarrassed by it.   Although, <br/>
it weighs much less on him now that he is home and not getting picked on in <br/>
school.<br/>

Hi, Heidi --<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t originally post on this topic, about pushing a child to get<br/>
braces to prevent TMJ.  But as I was reading, I was thinking that one<br/>
way to make a better decision (for the hypothetical child) would be to<br/>
look at the available dental literature and find out, for people who DO<br/>
get TMJ later from this cause, how severe the symptoms are, and<br/>
specifically, *what the treatment options are*.  I think this would help<br/>
in coming to the best possible decision.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it would ever be possible to get good data on what<br/>
percentage of kids with similar &quot;bite alignment&quot; problems actually<br/>
develop TMJ as adults.  Maybe it is close to 100%, but it would be<br/>
interesting to have a number. I would assume that an orthodontist might<br/>
be more likely to overdo it than to underdo it, in making a diagnosis. <br/>
If there was an alternative method to treating a potential problem, I<br/>
don&#39;t know how much information they would give.<br/>

Never heard of it. I had braces too. In the UK braces tend to be for teeththat overlap so cleaning is difficult. It is done for medical reasons, not usually cosmetic. I think you can pay private<br/>
