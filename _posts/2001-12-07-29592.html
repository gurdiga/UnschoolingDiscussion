<br/>
My son is a lot like yours.  He doesn&#39;t like to brush his teeth because he<br/>
has developed a &quot;thing&quot; about toothpaste.  The backs of his ears could grow<br/>
potatoes.  His room is a disaster.  His choices in these areas do not<br/>
reflect my priorities.  Normally, that is fine.  But at some point, his<br/>
choices bump up against others in the family and we have to come up with a<br/>
plan.  When I am out money because Zach needs extra dental care, we have a<br/>
talk about his teeth and eventually decided that I would remind him every<br/>
morning to brush.<br/>
<br/>
I work very hard to look at my reasoning behind my intervention.  Is it<br/>
because his actions are not what I would choose or are they actually<br/>
interfering with other people?  That is the basis I use to determine if I<br/>
will step in......so his room is still a disaster and his ears are filthy  .<br/>
