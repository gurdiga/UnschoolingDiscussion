<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341069087">We will be happy to send postcards in response, if you put your address<br/>
on the postcard it would help as I have a terrible memory and put things<br/>
up to keep them and it takes weeks to find where I put them. Our address<br/>
is<br/>
David, Keith and Erick Holden<br/>
827 East &quot;A&quot; Street<br/>
Casper, Wyoming  82601<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for helping me with the kids education, it makes it so much<br/>
easier for me to have friends to turn to.<br/>
Sharon<br/>
