&gt; Hi All: especially Valerie and Carollyn:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Having just read Melissa&#39;s e-mail jarred something inside of me... I need<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; apologize to all for my hick comments... It was uncalled for and<br/>
&gt; unnecessary.. If I can&#39;t get my point across without resorting to<br/>
insulting<br/>
&gt; people, then I ought to think again about how to reinforce my argument.<br/>
My<br/>
&gt; behavior was inappropriate and child like (well that&#39;s PS child like)...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do hope you all accept my apologies... I will continue to disagree on<br/>
&gt; subject such as spanking, but not to resort to namecalling.<br/>

Pass the Lemonade!  My weatherbug says its down to 105. But considering that<br/>
it is after 6:30, I&#39;m underwhelmed with the decrease from a high of 108<br/>
earlier in the day!!!<br/>
<br/>
Did you say you are in the burbs near San Antonio?  I am in the sticks<br/>
approximately 100 miles from both SA and Austin.  Actually we are 21 miles<br/>
to Llano and 21 miles to Fredericksburg.  As soon as we can find good jobs<br/>
and get our place (21 acres, house, antique log cabin, and several<br/>
outbuildings) on the market, we are heading for the Pacific Northwest.<br/>
Their highs in the daytime are lower than our lows at night.<br/>
<br/>
Melodie :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147697156">Apologies accepted, Dawn.<br/>
<br/>
I had an interesting experience in the gorcery store today. I was talking to<br/>
a man in line and mentioned that I had been born in Appalachia and that my<br/>
grandfather had been a coal miner. He informed me that that was impossible<br/>
because there were no black Appalachians and certainly there were no black<br/>
coal miners in the 1920&#39;s!! The man &quot;erased&quot; my whole, dang family!! Sheesh!<br/>

Shirley, you crack me up.  That&#39;s saying a lot today because I have some<br/>
irritating virus and see very little humor in anything. In all seriousness,<br/>
do you think it&#39;s possible for someone who is racist to the bone to change?<br/>

I&#39;ve read and seen touching accounts of bigots reformed, but most of the<br/>
bigots I have to come into contact with are still present and accounted for.<br/>
My gut level response is that staunch bigotry falls into that &quot;stupid to the<br/>
bone&quot; category that knowledge cannot cure. Of course, there are some folks<br/>
who simply haven&#39;t thought the situation through. I suppose there would be<br/>
hope for them. I have few among my acquaintances. They tend to think<br/>
themselves wonderfully open-minded because they are not burning crosses on<br/>
anyone&#39;s lawn. Sigh!<br/>

Wow, Shirley, Happy 20th Anniversary!<br/>
<br/>
(that&#39;s from the other post, if you&#39;re trying to follow along)  One thing<br/>
people tried to tell me when my eldest was &quot;school age&quot; and it obvious she<br/>
wasn&#39;t going, was that she would never learn &quot;tolerance&quot; or learn about<br/>
other cultures, beliefs, etc, etc.....I replied if she could get along with<br/>
her entire extended family, she&#39;d be fine. My husband and I were blessed<br/>
with very large (dare I say &quot;mixed&quot;) families.<br/>

here, when the bloke who planted to bomb in the gay pub in Soho, <br/>
London, was sentenced.  There was a former far-right-wing <br/>
activist, who was now working for the &#39;other side.&#39;  Why?  His <br/>
son was born with a cleft lip and palate, and his &#39;friends&#39; told him <br/>
that his child would have to be &#39;euthanised&#39; because he was <br/>
imperfect.  Sometimes it takes a kick up the bum like taht to <br/>
change someone&#39;s pov, sometimes nothing will.  Such is life.<br/>
