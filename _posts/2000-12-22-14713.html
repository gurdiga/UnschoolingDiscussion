Your gifts sound so awesome!  I wish I was a relative!  I don&#39;t see as much <br/>
heart and thought in Martha&#39;s gifts anyway, yours are so creative.<br/>
<br/>
We made our gifts this year and had a ball.  Unfortunately, none of them made <br/>
it into the mail on time (one of the kids got sick the night before our post <br/>
office day) but everyone understands.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804386604">A friend of mine gave me a subscription to that magazine for Christmas last <br/>
year and I was so disappointed, it was so full of ads that i could not even <br/>
enjoy it. I mean it said in one article that her socks costs 80.00(angora). <br/>
Really? to much for me.<br/>
Peace and love ,Tami(who is trying to get used to a new key board after an <br/>
attack of coffee on old but cooler one).<br/>
