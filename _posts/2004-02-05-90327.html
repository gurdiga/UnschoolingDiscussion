<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418721413">I am new to this list and to unschooling.  My kids are still relatively young (7,6,4,3,3).  I was following a CM approach and have abandoned it for the second time.  The first time my oldest was only 6 so I decided he would just be in kindergarten and I could leave his life unstructured.  This time however, I&#39;m feeling as though I need to make the leap of remaining unstructured forever.<br/>
<br/>
My struggle:  I&#39;m having an identity crisis.  Over the last 2 years I&#39;ve gone from being very critical of homeschoolers to an unschooler.  My discomfort has become more pronounced now that I am abandoning, so completely, many of my long held and strongly stated beliefs.  I know with time I will become more comfortable with presenting myself honestly to the world but I am not there yet and am not sure how to become comfortable.  I know much of my discomfort is disliking anyone not to approve of me.  I would value any insights you can give me.<br/>
<br/>
Also, what do your kids answer when people ask them what grade they&#39;re in or about school?  My kids don&#39;t feel like we do school so are lost when strangers ask about it.  Thanks again for your input.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a matter of getting to a place where you don&#39;t need to defend yourself.<br/>
You just are who you are.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sort of a Zen thing so it&#39;s hard to describe! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote a bit ago:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; When we&#39;re put on the spot about our beliefs, we often feel we *need* to<br/>
&gt;&gt; enlighten someone. There&#39;s a driving force inside us that says we *need* to<br/>
&gt;&gt; make them understand so they can stop thinking bad thoughts about us and our<br/>
&gt;&gt; families and our choices.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; But if someone can let go of the emotions questioning stirs up -- not<br/>
&gt;&gt; necessarily not feel the emotions but let the emotions exist, accept them,<br/>
&gt;&gt; but detach ourselves from the control they try to weild over us -- a person<br/>
&gt;&gt; can get to a healthier place.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; If someone questions us we can choose to give them information or not<br/>
&gt;&gt; depending on whether it seems a useful use of our time or not. But if we can<br/>
&gt;&gt; accept that their emotions and reactions and mental place aren&#39;t ours to<br/>
&gt;&gt; control, we can be more at peace with ourselves. We can be at peace with<br/>
&gt;&gt; doing what we feel is right without taking on the burden of expecting the<br/>
&gt;&gt; world to change for us and because of us. We&#39;re releasing the information for<br/>
&gt;&gt; people to use as they will, not expecting a change in anyone in return. They<br/>
&gt;&gt; are where they are for a reason. We can give them the information to change,<br/>
&gt;&gt; but it isn&#39;t in our power to change them. It&#39;s entirely their choice to hold<br/>
&gt;&gt; onto the place they&#39;re in or seek out what they need to get to a new place.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many people are not going to understand homeschooling. Fewer are going to<br/>
understand unschooling. If they wanted to, they&#39;d reach out and ask<br/>
questions. When they attack someone who has the information they need to<br/>
change their ignorance to knowledge, they are protecting their own<br/>
ignorance. They&#39;re basically saying it&#39;s scary where you are and I don&#39;t<br/>
want that scariness to affect me, so I&#39;m going to do what I can to defend<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing we can do about that. They&#39;re making the choice to remain<br/>
ignorant. We can offer the information but we can&#39;t make them take it.<br/>
<br/>
If we can let go of that need to make them take the information in so they<br/>
can understand us, we can let go of the need to defend ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, what do your kids answer when people ask them what grade they&#39;re in or<br/>
&gt; about school?  My kids don&#39;t feel like we do school so are lost when<br/>
&gt; strangers ask about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They can say &quot;We&#39;re homeschooled. We don&#39;t do grades.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or you can tell them -- if they&#39;re birthdays are in the summer! -- that to<br/>
figure out their grade they can subtract 5 from their age and say &quot;We&#39;re<br/>
homeschooled but if I were in school I&#39;d be in grade x.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You could tell your kids that when people ask what grade the kids are in,<br/>
they&#39;re trying to get some information they can relate to. Like if they know<br/>
someone else in that grade or if they have some memories of something that<br/>
happened to them in that grade. Ages aren&#39;t as useful for them because a 6<br/>
yo could be in kindergarten or 1st or 2nd.<br/>

Susan,  <br/>
Changing long held beliefs can be very painful, changing strongly stated<br/>
beliefs can sometimes be embarrassing, but if your beliefs have really<br/>
changed, you have to let your life follow that path.  Maybe you could try to<br/>
be not so concerned with how you are &quot;presenting&quot; yourself to the world?<br/>
Why don&#39;t you just live your life the way you want to and let the chips fall<br/>
where they may?  If friends ask about your change in outlook, just answer<br/>
honestly.  It might sound like &quot;I know I&#39;ve been critical of homeschooling<br/>
in the past, but after reading and thinking a lot about it, I&#39;ve decided<br/>
that it might be a good thing for my family.&quot;   It might sound completely<br/>
different, it&#39;s up to you!<br/>

I can definitely relate to this!  Most people probably can.  People<br/>
generally want others to like and approve of them.  Remember, though, that<br/>
no matter what you do, someone will disapprove of you.  Also, think about<br/>
the people whose actions you don&#39;t &quot;approve of&quot;.  Do you really want their<br/>
approval?  I know of many people who do things to or for their kids that I<br/>
don&#39;t agree with.  Their approval of how I raise my kids is totally<br/>
irrelevant to me.  Their values are totally different than mine.<br/>
****************************************************************************<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, what do your kids answer when people ask them what grade they&#39;re in or<br/>
about school?  My kids don&#39;t feel like we do school so are lost when<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

My oldest, when asked what grade he&#39;s in will generally answer with  &quot;We<br/>
homeschool.  We don&#39;t do grades<br/>

<br/>
Well, then you are probably doing something right &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
My kids vary on how they respond.  The girls will usually answer with<br/>
whatever grade they would be in if they were in school (they keep up with<br/>
it.  I usually have to ask them what grade to put on forms which makes<br/>
people turn and look at me funny &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My son says he doesn&#39;t go to school and when asked what he does all day, he<br/>
usually responds that he just watches tv......I think he just enjoys the<br/>
looks on people&#39;s faces because he watches less tv than probably most<br/>
schooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to your kids.  Give them ideas for things to answer.  Just let them<br/>
answer whatever feels good to them.  Most people ask kids about school<br/>
because they don&#39;t have a clue what to talk to them about or they don&#39;t know<br/>
them very well.  After you have been homeschooling for awhile, people will<br/>
tend to know you homeschool, they will have been around your kids and know<br/>
they are smart, they will quit asking.<br/>

That&#39;s true, and yet if someone was know to be firmly of a belief (like <br/>
school is necessary), when and if that person DOES decide different, their change <br/>
will be more significant than that of one who was never very particular or <br/>
invested.<br/>
<br/>
(Unless the person is just known to glom entirely onto one thing and jump <br/>
like a flea to another sincere belief, but that&#39;s for each person&#39;s real-life <br/>
friends to gauge. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<br/>
When people say &quot;But you used to be a teacher!&quot; it&#39;s easy to say &quot;Well then I <br/>
should know what&#39;s wrong with the schools.&quot;   Sometimes they don&#39;t want a <br/>
well-considered response to their rhetorical question, they want a rhetorical <br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Change your focus from your feelings to your children&#39;s and it will be easier.<br/>
<br/>
Will you discomfort your child DEFINITELY<br/>
in exchange for NOT discomforting someone you see occasionally POSSIBLY?<br/>
<br/>
Will you trade your children&#39;s happiness<br/>
for your comfort?<br/>
<br/>
The children are with you every day.  They are depending on you to make their <br/>
lives as good as you can make them.  <br/>
<br/>
These relatives, neighbors, friends, strangers you&#39;re worried about are NOT <br/>
depending on you.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t compromise your children for the comfort of outsiders, and if you <br/>
consider the bond between you and your child to be a part of your motherhood, a <br/>
part of their childhood, then others are outsiders.<br/>

But your post reminded me of something that happened last week.  We were signing up for cheerleading and one of the women asked what grade my youngest daughter (who wasn&#39;t along) was in so they knew which squad sheet they needed to check off.<br/>
<br/>
ANyway, I couldn&#39;t answer right away.  I had to turn and ask my 11 year old what grade the 8 year old was in LOL.  I&#39;m sure I must have looked like a total goof LOL.<br/>

<br/>
I know how you feel, and have only recently �come out� as an unschooler with<br/>
my local group. If I start to worry, I remind myself that I am being a<br/>
little paranoid � most people are far too busy with their own lives to be<br/>
worried about mine. I�m just not interesting enough to be the subject of<br/>
gossip, at least not sustained gossip.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
However what I sometimes do when questioned by people who are nice but<br/>
skeptical, such as my neighbor who is very fond of Jayn, is put it off onto<br/>
this list. (Heh, heh) What I say is that I didn�t make this stuff up out of<br/>
the air, but that this way of life has been shown to work by people with 20<br/>
years experience, whose children have grown up fabulous and intelligent, and<br/>
that it may be unusual but it is not unproven. I suspect the questioner�s<br/>
definition of �work� is traditional (ie go to college, get a job) but I know<br/>
it is working now for Jayn and us (a happy and mostly relaxed life) so I let<br/>
that go. I talk about how the life we are living now is an investment for<br/>
when Jayn is a teenager. I know that it is primarily about being happy and<br/>
fulfilled today, but other people are sometimes reassured that we are at<br/>
least thinking about the future.<br/>

much about other people&#39;s approval. AND - your kids will help, because <br/>
you&#39;ll see what great people they are becoming and you&#39;ll develop an <br/>
inner confidence and other people&#39;s opinions will seem of lesser and <br/>
lesser importance. Focus on your kids. That&#39;s the insight that I can <br/>
offer. Be strong in that.<br/>
<br/>
I went from PTA officer to unschooler - almost overnight!!! I know what <br/>
you mean about having an identity crisis &lt;G&gt;.  But what hasn&#39;t changed <br/>
is your commitment to your children and doing what YOU think is best <br/>
for them.<br/>

am abandoning, so completely, many of my long held and<br/>
strongly stated beliefs. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    My advice is to take them one at a time, because<br/>
that&#39;s less overwhelming at first.  What makes you<br/>
most uncomfortable?  Pay attention to the language you<br/>
use, and the feelings that you have.  How does that<br/>
serve you now, does it still work for you, and make<br/>
sense to you, or is it just habit? <br/>
<br/>
But the other side of that, is, what first appealed to<br/>
you about unschooling?  What is it that you liked so<br/>
much you really became ready to start letting go of<br/>
all those beliefs?  Those are important guideposts.  <br/>
 <br/>
The point here is to make it &quot;your own&quot;, right?, and<br/>
that means reading, discussion, and thought, and lots<br/>
of time to do those things! It might mean that some of<br/>
what you read in a book or read on this list doesn&#39;t<br/>
fit quite right right away and that&#39;s ok. You have<br/>
identified a blindspot and that&#39;s good.  Try not to<br/>
get judgmental and keep searching for *what it is* you<br/>
have a problem with.  Someimes that is very hard to<br/>
do, read thru the archives and you&#39;ll see many others<br/>
struggle with it too! <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know with <br/>
time I will become more comfortable with presenting<br/>
myself honestly to the world but I am not there yet<br/>
and am not sure how to become comfortable.&gt;&gt;<br/>

My advice:  Stay open to learning.  Get used to not<br/>
knowing *all* the answers, but getting to know BETTER,<br/>
every day, what&#39;s right for you, and your kids!  <br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&lt; I know much of my discomfort is disliking anyone<br/>
not to approve <br/>
of me.  I would value any insights you can give me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, man, I know what that is like.  lol  My only<br/>
advice is, push thru the discomfort to stand up for<br/>
yourself, and you might do it poorly at first, but<br/>
that&#39;s ok, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing yet! ( My<br/>
voice used to shake, and so did my hands!) <br/>
<br/>
 Practice!  Do it with strangers, people you&#39;ll never<br/>
see again, and don&#39;t care (as much) about. Practice in<br/>
front of your mirror when your nervous about an<br/>
upcoming situation, or role play with your husband or<br/>
an understanding friend, whatever works.  You&#39;ll start<br/>
to feel more confident as you pay more attention to<br/>
real life, and not &quot;what they MIGHT think&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, what do your kids answer when people ask them<br/>
what grade they&#39;re <br/>
in or about school?  My kids don&#39;t feel like we do<br/>
school so are lost <br/>
when strangers ask about it.  Thanks again for your<br/>
input.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son is ruthless. lol They ask, what grade are you<br/>
in and he simply says, &quot;I don&#39;t go to school.&quot;  He<br/>
usually gives them a look like, &quot;Go ahead, ask me<br/>
another stupid question.&quot;  lol<br/>
<br/>
  There&#39;s usually dead silence while the other person<br/>
tries to figure out how that could possibly be!  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it amazes us how ignorant people are about<br/>
homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
At this point, I usually feel sorry for the person and<br/>
I tell them his age, ( or he does) and that if he were<br/>
to be in school, he might be in 4th, but that he&#39;s<br/>
homeschooled, and that we don&#39;t measure his<br/>
intelligence in grades.  There&#39;s usually more dead<br/>
silence at this point.  lol <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just my POV about the subject line of your<br/>
post.  I don&#39;t believe that changing your mind changes<br/>
who you are.  You are always the same person, just at<br/>
a different stage of life and development.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  one of the women asked what grade my youngest daughter  was in . . .<br/>
ANyway, I couldn&#39;t answer right away.  I had to turn and ask my 11 year old <br/>
what grade the 8 year old was in LOL.  I&#39;m sure I must have looked like a total <br/>
goof LOL. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE when that happens.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes one of my kids will know because one of their friends has made a <br/>
big deal of it for one reason or another (complaining about my kids having too <br/>
much privilege or something, usually) but most often, we all look at each other <br/>
like cows admiring a disco ball while a few seconds pass.<br/>
<br/>
The other people must think we&#39;ve all lost our minds.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby went to a prom with a dozen other kids, they were all seniors, and <br/>
his date told people variably &quot;he&#39;s homeschooled&quot; (which satisfied everyone) <br/>
or &quot;He would be a junior but he&#39;s homeschooled.&quot;  So it kept him from having <br/>
the taint of being a junior, I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly and I spent the day at a prep school the other day that goes 6th to <br/>
12th grade.  I was doing a project for a friend who teaches history.  Kids were <br/>
asking Holly what grade she was in and she was saying &quot;I don&#39;t go to school.&quot;  <br/>
They asked if she was a buddy (a visitor or prospect attending with another <br/>
student) and she said &quot;No, I&#39;m with my mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was fun.  They just weren&#39;t stock answers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028434870">One way to make critics feel better is to say &quot;We&#39;re trying this for now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;We&#39;re going to see how this goes&quot; they&#39;ll relax.  Maybe they&#39;re <br/>
relaxing because they think yo&#39;re being cautious and that seems wise to them.  <br/>
Maybe they&#39;re hoping really hard that it fails so you&#39;ll go back to something <br/>
they understand.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Kirby was six, seven, eight, saying to many former <br/>
teacher-friends and  to relatives, &quot;We&#39;re going to do this as long as it seems to be <br/>
working out!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hard to argue with a happy presentation of that!<br/>
