   You&#39;re getting really defensive...nobody is criticizing you...people ARE<br/>
offering suggestions.  We&#39;re asking you to step outside of yourself, away<br/>
from how you&#39;ve always done things...and try something new.<br/>
<br/>
  We only know of you what you&#39;ve given us, and are making suggestions and<br/>
observations based on that information.<br/>
<br/>
  If you don&#39;t want suggestions, maybe don&#39;t ask for them.  This list is not<br/>
so much a support group.  It&#39;s for discussion, and what you read here is<br/>
SUPPOSED to challenge you to refine your relationships...with your kids,<br/>
with yourself maybe.<br/>
<br/>
  I think the most important thing that people have offered you is the<br/>
hardest for you to accept:  we&#39;re telling you how your kids see you and your<br/>
behavior.  Yes, it&#39;s kind of scary.  But it doesn&#39;t have to be.  Do some<br/>
reading at Sandra&#39;s site, and Joyce&#39;s site.  Keep reading here.  Read<br/>
&quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; by Alfie Kohn.<br/>
<br/>
  Try not to be defensive.  Take what you can manage and leave the rest.<br/>
Keep saying, &quot;You&#39;ve given me a lot to think about&quot;  Then think about it.<br/>
It will make your life much better, and will save your children.<br/>

<br/>
Warm hugs to you as you wade through this information :o)<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a person on this list who knows you in any way except the way<br/>
you have described your situations and how you handle them.<br/>
<br/>
People have attacked the things that you have said and done in the<br/>
situations you described because the things you were saying and doing were<br/>
drastically away from where unschooling lives and breathes. All of the<br/>
advice, though on the surface may seem derogatory, are actually useful<br/>
things to ponder and try. Make a cup of tea, breathe deep, and read through<br/>
them again. Try them on for a moment. Try to read them as if they were<br/>
written to someone other than you. It is not personal to you. It is directed<br/>
at the behaviors. Just take the suggestions for change if you like, and<br/>
disregard the rest for now. We all know that you working through things and<br/>
trying to get good advice, and no one is thinking you are a monster.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, my 17 yo has been breaking pencils for years. It wasn&#39;t until I broke<br/>
a few pencils myself that I saw what the attraction was. It is a very<br/>
satisfying feeling to break a pencil! He lately has been disassembling<br/>
pens...pen pieces all over the house sometimes. He eventually picks them up,<br/>
if I haven&#39;t done so already. Usually.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get as much satisfaction out of disassembling the pens though...he<br/>
gets something out of it. He doesn&#39;t tell me though. It&#39;s a secret :-)<br/>
<br/>
He respects people deeply, and treats animals and plants with love and care.<br/>
<br/>
Just loves to break pencils. He bought a replacement box recently for the<br/>
first time on his own. That was to replace a bunch he had used. Very<br/>
thoughtful I thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193705590">I think that often when you are tired or trying to change then solutions and ideas can seem like critisism and more problems.<br/>
  Change is hard.<br/>
  I remember many years ago when I asked about punishment. I didn&#39;t want to spank so i asked about taking away their TV time or computer games and it took me ages to see that punishment like that is wrong too. It might not be spanking but it was all about imposing my adult power (I;m bigger n stronger) on kids in order to have my own way. It wasn&#39;t taking into account them at all.<br/>
  Its much more effort to be creative and sometimes when they are squabbling I know it would be easier to yell etc rather than find out if they are bored or if somethings up.<br/>
  Things ain&#39;t perfect by any means, We still don&#39;t like in a Walton&#39;s type house but its fairer. The kids tell me when I&#39;m being unreasonable and suggest creative ways to stop me being bored and cranky!<br/>

<br/>
I agree with this statement.  Unschooling is such a paradigm shift for most<br/>
of us.  I still struggling with myself and how I react to my children.  I<br/>
read a whole lot more than I post.  I read carefully and ask myself the hard<br/>
questions.  There are times I dont like my own answers.  We tend to get<br/>
defensive when there is something within us that really does need<br/>
addressing.<br/>
<br/>
I realized last week that I have been hard on my 10yo dd. Why? Because I<br/>
want her to have better eating habits and not raise her voice while she<br/>
complains that everyone is out to get her.  I could kick myself at times<br/>
because I do loose my temper and say things I have to go back and apologize<br/>
for.  As far as the eating, she is overweight and never feels good.  Always<br/>
complains of being tired.  She will spend all day on the couch if I dont<br/>
encourage her to go outside and play or go for a walk around the hay field<br/>
with me and her sister, etc.  After reading A LOT on several lists I am on,<br/>
I realized I was making way too big a deal about this eating thing.  I went<br/>
to Costco and bought a vegetable tray and lots of fresh fruit.  I am<br/>
beginning to show her how to read labels when she asks me if a particular<br/>
selection is good to eat.  I realize that her lack of self-esteem is partly<br/>
due to my reactions to her about several things.  Now for a mom who is<br/>
really trying hard to be a better parent than what she had growing up, that<br/>
was a hard pill to swallow.<br/>
<br/>
My girls tend to argue quit a bit.  I am working on how I respond.  The main<br/>
thing is not pouring on the guilt to get the results I want.<br/>
<br/>
I dont want to ramble.  I hope you will take some time to really assess<br/>
where YOU are.  Perhaps journaling would help you take a better outside look<br/>
at some of this.  When I journal and go back later to read what I wrote, I<br/>
get a different perspective on things.  Just remember, it really isnt about<br/>
your children.<br/>
<br/>
Life is a journey.  Be patient with yourself and others around you.<br/>

<br/>
They are being supportive by offering ways for you to look at what habits you have and examine them more closely.  This is not a means to put YOU down personally, just a challenge to see if there could be a different way.<br/>
<br/>
===You have all just made it out like i am selfish and don&#39;t care about my children as much as my own feelings,when i wouldn&#39;t be thinking i was making a mistake, or asking foradvice, or even putting conscious thought into my parenting if i was just selfish and didn&#39;t care about my children. ===<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t read any posts that stated you didn&#39;t care about your children.  I read that you need to learn to show them differently than you have been in the past.<br/>
<br/>
===I didn&#39;t post here to find a way to make my kids let me have an easier life.===<br/>
<br/>
By unschooling the way being suggested here, you will find EVERYONE especially your children will have an easier life.  Not a bad thing!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
==I had many differnet topics relating to unschooling i wanted to ask questions<br/>

how to do things the right way. ===<br/>
<br/>
Re-read the responses that were sent.  ...But only After you have taken a bubble bath or meditated or come in from gardening or any other activity you do to feed YOU.  Then be objective and see if maybe the responses are an effort to help you learn how to &#39;do things the right way&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===You are all pointing fingers at me the way you say i do it to my children.===<br/>
<br/>
No one is pointing fingers at YOU just your actions.  They are hoping to help you feel what your children may be feeling by the way they are being handled.  Sometimes the truth is painful to hear.  And change is difficult because it requires us to examine ourselves and accept our faults.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=== I don&#39;t appreciate the accuasations: Did you look at bugs with them? Sounds like you just want them out of your hair. You don&#39;t know enough about me to assume things like that.

These are not accusations.  They are questions.  <br/>
<br/>
=== I don&#39;t see much of a point to this. ===<br/>
<br/>
Try again when you can look at this from a different plane.  No problem can be solved from the place it was created.  You will have to get to a different place.  Good luck with the process and this group will support it!  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting, you know.  Most of us parents (there are some <br/>
notable exceptions) are really trying to do the best we can with the <br/>
knowledge we have (or most importantly, *don&#39;t* have).  Now, as I had <br/>
mentioned earlier, my folks had a fairly punitive methodology, and my <br/>
sibs and I got the belt or the switch or the back of a hand a <br/>
lot.  There was a lot of yelling going on and I was sometimes so <br/>
scared I peed in my pants!  I was very meek and never yelled back; I <br/>
can remember being afraid just to walk past my dad &#39;cause I just <br/>
*knew* he would hit me (and a lot of times, he did).  Made me just <br/>
want to disappear.  So, when I was really little, I did the best I <br/>
could to stay out of the way and not call attention to myself (to the <br/>
extent that I could).  But, when I was a teenager, I was hellish!  I <br/>
was still afraid of my folks, so I didn&#39;t back-talk them, but I was <br/>
deceptive and sneaky and just plain awful.   What I didn&#39;t realize <br/>
then, but do now, was that our relationship was a dance that they <br/>
actually choreographed.  I responded to their lead, and we all did <br/>
the best we could.  In spite of that, it wasn&#39;t really very good.<br/>
<br/>
But, I was talking with my mom recently, and she saw herself as being <br/>
a really crummy mother!  (She definitely did have issues!  No doubt <br/>
about that!)  Anyway, her saying that was quite a revelation to <br/>
me.  I can certainly forgive her and my dad because I know they did <br/>
their best, and I know they loved me and my brother and sister, even <br/>
if I was sure they hated me back then.  I wonder how different things <br/>
might have been if she could have acknowledged that when we (she and <br/>
my dad and my brother and my sister and I) were young enough to maybe <br/>
take a different path.  I had/have a lot of recovering to do from my <br/>
kidhood days.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Excuse me for trying to figure out how to do things the right way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re excused!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You are all pointing fingers at me the<br/>
&gt;way you say i do it to my children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But, did you not ask what you could do differently?  Why ask if <br/>
you&#39;re not willing to hear the answers?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I don&#39;t see much of a point to this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s great that you asked the questions.  I hope you&#39;ll keep <br/>
reading and keep asking.  And, don&#39;t take stuff so personally!  As <br/>
you pointed out, nobody here really knows you, so nothing can really <br/>
be meant personally.  The responses you read weren&#39;t insults or <br/>
accusations or digs or anything like that.  Folks are just trying to <br/>
help in the best way they can.  It can be really helpful to assume <br/>
the best in other folks, not the worst.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this has helped a little.<br/>

<br/>
==================================<br/>
<br/>
If authoritarian parents could see into their kids, the thoughts they<br/>
listen in on would probably feel really awful.  I remember in college<br/>
thinking it would be nice to be a tree.  Now that&#39;s very odd, I know.<br/>
  It certainly raises a few questions about me huh?  ;)  I was<br/>
struggling hard in those days to keep my head up.  Before then, when I<br/>
still lived with my parents, I often wished to be invisible and<br/>
fantasized what it would be like.  In someone else, those ideas could<br/>
have been interesting &quot;what if&#39;s&quot; and nothing more.  In me, they were<br/>
a desire to be elsewhere, anywhere but in my life, my body, on earth.<br/>
   My upbringing had made existence untenable and painful.  Intro to<br/>
Life 101, otherwise known as the School of Hard Knocks.<br/>
<br/>
I decided very early that I didn&#39;t want to have kids because of my<br/>
experience growing up.  Well, the years rolled by, I got a little<br/>
freer and I had my own child almost 3 years ago.  I can only say for<br/>
sure, even now, even being freer than I&#39;ve ever been that I have so<br/>
much work to do to be truly free.  *sigh*  The dance (as Marji aptly<br/>
names it) first learned as a child stays with a person the longest,<br/>
has the greatest impact on the child, and is the easiest to infect<br/>
others, our spouses and children, with.<br/>
<br/>
By all means.  Let&#39;s learn a sweet new dance.  My parents didn&#39;t<br/>
intend to dance cruelly but it feels cruel even today.  They thought<br/>
they were being loving, doing things to me for my own good.  Maybe<br/>
they were more loving than their own parents in some ways.  My<br/>
siblings could more easily mask their feelings and get on with it than<br/>
I could.  Speaking of dances, one of my sisters the other day, after I<br/>
asked what her son wanted to do, said quite confidently &quot;I don&#39;t care<br/>
what *he* thinks.&quot;  She signed him up (accepted a hard won invitation)<br/>
for a cotillion-- so he can learn to dance gentleman-like.  I&#39;m sure<br/>
my nephew will absolutely hate it with every fiber of his being, not<br/>
the least because it&#39;s not really his choice.  Sis tells me that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t even know about it yet.  Yikes.  He&#39;s 13.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s often one of my kind in every family.  I think that&#39;s<br/>
one too many.  In my family, there&#39;s two of my<br/>
not-coping-with-our-upbringing/ decisions we&#39;ve made/ etc. kind out of<br/>
four daughters.  I think that&#39;s WAY too many.  And way too much pain.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s interesting, you know.  Most of us parents (there are some<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
notable exceptions) are really trying to do the best we can with the<br/>
knowledge we have (or most importantly, *don&#39;t* have).  Now, as I had<br/>
mentioned earlier, my folks had a fairly punitive methodology, and my<br/>
sibs and I got the belt or the switch or the back of a hand a<br/>
lot.  There was a lot of yelling going on and I was sometimes so<br/>
scared I peed in my pants!  I was very meek and never yelled back; I<br/>
can remember being afraid just to walk past my dad &#39;cause I just<br/>
*knew* he would hit me (and a lot of times, he did).  Made me just<br/>
want to disappear.  So, when I was really little, I did the best I<br/>
could to stay out of the way and not call attention to myself (to the<br/>
extent that I could).  But, when I was a teenager, I was hellish!  I<br/>
was still afraid of my folks, so I didn&#39;t back-talk them, but I was<br/>
deceptive and sneaky and just plain awful.   What I didn&#39;t realize<br/>
then, but do now, was that our relationship was a dance that they<br/>
actually choreographed.  I responded to their lead, and we all did<br/>
the best we could.  In spite of that, it wasn&#39;t really very good.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; </span></blockquote></div>
