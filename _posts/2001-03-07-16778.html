I have to admit to be coming around to your way of thinking more and <br/>
more.  I was one of these mums who insisted on using a math work <br/>
book. dd didnt like doing them - but scored well.  So why was I doing <br/>
them. She has the grasp of math - always was good at math at school - <br/>
unless she is going to be a scientist she really doesnt need to know <br/>
any more than she knows.  There are calculators these days any way.<br/>
<br/>
dd is showing a lot more motivation these days.  Said she wants to be <br/>
a makeup artist to the stars - so this week she wrote to the local TV <br/>
studios make up department for advice.<br/>
Yesterday she watched TV all day, she hasnt done this for a long <br/>
time, and I have to admit to feeling a failure - she did get the word <br/>
find book out last night and do some of those puzzles, plus she <br/>
always checks her email and answeres them...... She watches the <br/>
movies on TV or the Nickelodian chanel.<br/>
<br/>
you really used to scare me sandra, but now that I know you, I trust <br/>
any advice you give to us al.<br/>
marianne - whoes dd has gone of to work with dad, she is doing *work <br/>
experience* - if she had her way she would go to work with her dad <br/>
everyday!</div>

<br>
<br>That&#39;s school reform.
<br>
<br>If schools are just kind of tweaked a little bit--smaller classes, more 
<br>colorful books, shorter class periods, different-looking report cards, fewer 
<br>tests, windows with nicer views, softer chairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Vouchers! &nbsp;A choice of schools!
<br>
<br>Choices of teachers within schools.
<br>
<br>Still, school.
<br>
<br>And school-at-home is another form of that same thing.
<br>
<br>Those who stay on the curriculum path which goes 
<br>kindergarten
<br>first grade
<br>phonics
<br>second grade
<br>double column math
<br>third grade
<br>times tables
<br>etc.
<br>etc.
<br>are not getting off the path, whether they are riding the path in a school 
<br>desk or at a kitchen table. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Having looked at the subject line and the return address to confirm that I&#39;m 
<br>on the unschooling list, I feel confident in saying that one cannot unschool 
<br>AND stay on that path. &nbsp;There are wider-path lists and I&#39;m on some of them, 
<br>so I would understand the defense of traditional means there, but here is 
<br>where unschoolers should be safe to promote unschooling without apologies to 
<br>textbook manufacturers or salesmen.
<br>
<br>If a family chooses to stay on the path (a term I used just for one e-mail 
<br>earlier today, not something I hope to have become dogma--just a temporary 
<br>analogy) they absolutely have the right to do so and they are in the 
<br>majority. &nbsp;But if they say to unschoolers, &quot;This isn&#39;t working, my child 
<br>hates math, my child doesn&#39;t want to read, my child won&#39;t do his *work* 
<br>(meaning worksheets or reports to nobody)&quot; then when unschoolers say &quot;remove 
<br>yourself from the expectations you had when he was going to be in school all 
<br>his pre-adult life&quot; and I said that too, only it sounded like GET OFF THE 
<br>PATH.
<br>
<br>Math isn&#39;t divided into subject area and specialties or into six elementary 
<br>levels and six high school levels, or four primary, four midschool and four 
<br>high school. &nbsp;Well it is, but only by textbook companies. 
<br>
<br>In the real world, math is like a language for a way of thinking.
<br>
<br>History isn&#39;t divided into school-levels either, in the real world. &nbsp;Nor is 
<br>English, nor science. &nbsp;Geology involves chemistry and physics. &nbsp;&nbsp;Astronomy 
<br>can&#39;t be had without light physics and lenses. &nbsp;Aeronautics involves 
<br>materials, and you&#39;re back to chemistry and physics and metalurgical 
<br>considerations, and construction. &nbsp;They don&#39;t divide up NEARLY the way they 
<br>pretend to seem to in school.
<br>
<br>The more unschoolers play with such ideas the easier it is for them to see 
<br>that they can go cross-country, cross-age, cross-ability, cross-subject, 
<br>cross-universe.

<br>Well, that would have been a lovely sentiment to have expressed. &nbsp;Welcoming, 
<br>helpful, maybe offering a few real-life suggestions. &nbsp;Not lecturing and 
<br>yelling -- I know, it&#39;s your style.
