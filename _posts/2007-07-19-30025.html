<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968627101">New word on the Lyrics game is &quot;oh&quot;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lyricsgame.blogspot.com">http://lyricsgame.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Marty is housesitting, but I had forgotten.  I had told Keith he  <br/>
could take my van to work, when we were going to leave his at the  <br/>
shop.  When we were in the driveway to leave, he said &quot;Martin didn&#39;t  <br/>
come home,&quot; and I figured he was out late and slept on someone&#39;s  <br/>
couch, but luckily I remembered before Keith left.  So he left me my  <br/>
ratty old mini-van which makes whale songs and should be in the shop  <br/>
itself.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to be older and have extra cars.  Many times I had to drive  <br/>
Keith to work in our one vehicle (or our one running vehicle) and  <br/>
pick him up later.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s housesitting for five days.  He can come home during the day  <br/>
to get stuff, but he&#39;s sleeping there.<br/>
<br/>
The reason we put the Taurus in the shop is that Holly and I are  <br/>
going to Denver for the weekend.  I should be able to update the  <br/>
lyrics game from there (in case Marji just gasped...); the photos are  <br/>
in Photobucket so I can get to them from there.  It will be Holly and  <br/>
one or two older male friends (older than Holly,  younger than I am;  <br/>
one&#39;s 22, one&#39;s 36) who can help us drive if they go, and participate  <br/>
in the SCA philosophy discussion while we&#39;re there.  The one who  <br/>
draws is VERY interested in going, The other is fairly newlywed (less  <br/>
than a year) and works long hours, mostly driving, so driving to  <br/>
Denver for fun isn&#39;t as much a draw for him.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be staying with Wendy, who used to live with us.  They live  <br/>
across from a little lake/pond with ducks and geese, so I&#39;ll take  <br/>
some corn I have from when we made cornbags.  (Will ducks and geese  <br/>
eat corn?  I&#39;d rather not give them bread; it&#39;s not natural...)<br/>
<br/>
Those are the considerations of the moment at my house.  Kirby&#39;s  <br/>
asleep; worked until 3:00 a.m.  Holly&#39;s asleep; don&#39;t know what she  <br/>
did after I went to sleep.  I&#39;m repairing two pairs of Marty&#39;s  <br/>
favorite pants today.  I really like days when I can stretch and not  <br/>
be pressured.  I know those of you with little kids don&#39;t have that  <br/>
right now, but you will!  You will.  (I didn&#39;t then, and I do now.)<br/>

<br/>
I hope it&#39;s a great trip!!!  (I&#39;m actually, um, heading out myself <br/>
for the weekend; we&#39;ll be back Monday night or early Tuesday or <br/>
sometime on Tuesday.)<br/>
