<div id="ygrps-yiv-640196149">I know this question is for Bridget but it reminds me<br/>
of when my son and I first moved to California a few<br/>
years ago. He spent two days taking two <br/>
carboard boxes, decorating them, attaching them,<br/>
making doorways in them and then slept in them for a<br/>
few days. On the floor, next to my bed.<br/>
<br/>
Geez, if anyone saw him they would of taken him away<br/>
and called CPS instantly!!!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
LOL!! My friend&#39;s son slept in the empty refrigerator<br/>
box for weeks. He moved to his bed after that for a<br/>
week then got a new laundry basket and slept in that<br/>
for 5 days. Now he&#39;s sleeping on the floor. Where&#39;s he<br/>
going to end up next is the common joke between us!<br/>
