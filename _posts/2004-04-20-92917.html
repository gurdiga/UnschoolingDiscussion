<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306515872">&lt;&lt;&lt;What if he never shows a spark for Christophr Columbus, fe?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then he simply hasn&#39;t come upon a situation where he needed to know about<br/>
Christopher Columbus.<br/>
<br/>
But chances are that he will know at least as much as your average high<br/>
school student just because of the holiday and the parade and the cultural<br/>
issues surrounding CC.  It comes up every fall in conversations, in the<br/>
newspaper, etc..<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things that lots of people know that I don&#39;t.  The entire<br/>
concept of physics and math was a black hole to me until I was grown and had<br/>
kids.  And I have a Master&#39;s degree with a BS.  But I just didn&#39;t get it.<br/>
Then I watched a Bill Nye video with the kids and it has been clear ever<br/>
since.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are lots of things I know that lots of other people<br/>
don&#39;t.....like you can use lemon juice and milk to make farmer&#39;s cheese, how<br/>
to knit a hat without ever having to purl, how to say the ABC&#39;s backwards...<br/>
<br/>
Even kids who have gone to school together with the same teachers will not<br/>
know the same things when they graduate.<br/>

What if he never shows a spark for Christophr Columbus, fe?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an immigrant from Australia. I have managed to do many jobs, have<br/>
friends, find love, and have interesting conversations as an adult who<br/>
doesn&#39;t know tons of the things that the school system here considers core<br/>
curriculum - I would probably be a Jaywalking Allstar, if you have watched<br/>
Leno at all. I can&#39;t name all the States probably, let alone the capitals,<br/>
or list all the Presidents. At home I was the equivalent of valedictorian.<br/>
They made a movie about Columbus didn&#39;t they? Did it include the horrors he<br/>
and his crews perpetrated in Haiti? School level information is often not<br/>
remotely complete. Philosophical issue: is any amount of information the<br/>
whole story on any subject, or is there always more to learn? <br/>
<br/>
What *if* a kid never sparks Columbus or [insert topic here]? How would his<br/>
life therefore be impossible - now or later? Is there some age limit in your<br/>
mind about when he needs to have these sparks by to count? Some people find<br/>
completely new interests as adults. What could happen to him? One thing is<br/>
that other people may try to quiz him with offensive questions, as people<br/>
sometimes do when they find out someone is homeschooled. They do that to all<br/>
homeschoolers. These interrogators are rude if adults, and have been<br/>
brainwashed if school children. Jayn mostly refuses to answer, regardless of<br/>
whether she knows the answer, preferring to initiate real conversations<br/>
about her current interests. DH and I usually say, &quot;She won&#39;t be a<br/>
performing monkey&quot; to stop them.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a great and abiding interest in  eg: Columbus, and have the<br/>
information around the house - maybe even the movie I mentioned or some<br/>
books with great illustrations or some ship models or a TV series comes on<br/>
or...this is strewing I guess. He may spark something from your passion<br/>
about your subject - or not. OTOH, if you are forcing yourself to read about<br/>
eg: Columbus and going rigid with boredom, or getting a tension headache<br/>
every time you think about the reading you &quot;must&quot; do to make sure he sees it<br/>
is important to learn about eg:Columbus, I think you are likely to smother<br/>
any spark that occurs.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it is something to ponder: whether there really is any particular<br/>
piece of school type knowledge that is essential to a happy life for a child<br/>
in the market economy democracy called the USA. (I&#39;m not talking about<br/>
skills - you say he knows how to read so he is already doing very well<br/>
indeed. If a skill is entirely used in a school setting, then it is beyond<br/>
irrelevant to our family. If it is useful in real life then it will be<br/>
learned at the time.) I&#39;m leaning to the &quot;None&quot; myself. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272080989">&#39;What if?&#39;  - what if we stopped worrying about &#39;what ifs&#39;, and <br/>
concentrate on &#39;what is&#39;?  Will the world end if your kids never show a <br/>
spark for Columbus, or my kids never show a spark for Captain Cook?  (We <br/>
live in new Zealand.)  Value the learning they are doing, instead of <br/>
worrying about what they aren&#39;t learning - they will never learn it all <br/>
- and how boring would life be for a true know-it-all?<br/>
<br/>
What I will tell you is that in a city close to where I live there is a <br/>
city counsellor who is functionally illiterate. This year he is running <br/>
for mayor, and has as good a chance as anyone of making it.  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s needed, your kids will learn it when they need it, or they will, <br/>
like the man mentioned above, find other ways of doing things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524989702">&quot;but rather<br/>
just the variety of different topics and concepts that kids learn in <br/>
school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Variety? I see school topics and concepts as extremely limited. When <br/>
you&#39;ve got the whole wide world to learn from, how can school <br/>
possibly even come close to competing?<br/>
Topics my children would never have come in contact with from school:<br/>
Yu-gi-oh, Pokemon, Mage Knight, Japanese Anime, rollerblading, <br/>
guitar (playing what he chooses, not what a band would force him <br/>
to), foreign money (actual real money, not just talk about it), <br/>
Medieval re-enactment, photography (at any age, not just HS), <br/>
woodworking (again at younger ages, not HS), starting their own <br/>
business ( a real one, not just faking it), massage therapy, herbal <br/>
medicine, homeopathics, dragon lore and art, travel, fort <br/>
construction, ....<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on...this is a small sampling and doesn&#39;t even <br/>
begin to convey the richness of learning that takes place in a wide <br/>
world of freedom.  School is all about a very restricted set of <br/>
information, and very academically focused.<br/>
<br/>
The other great thing, is your child will hear about Christopher <br/>
Columbus just from living in this country, and living in your <br/>
family. Unschooling isn&#39;t about waiting for a child to say &quot;show me <br/>
this&quot; and then teaching them something. It&#39;s living. And in living, <br/>
your child is probably going to come in contact with information <br/>
about Christopher Columbus.<br/>
And even better, they won&#39;t have some cockamamie idea that <br/>
Christopher Columbus &quot;discovered&quot; America. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe your child will show an interest in Native American basketry, <br/>
and bump into something about Columbus that way. Or maybe he&#39;ll get <br/>
fascinated with ships and bump into Columbus through a passion about <br/>
all things ship related. It isn&#39;t important that a person learns <br/>
specific bits of knowledge, it IS hugely important for them to <br/>
follow their interests and passions.<br/>
And if they do that with an aware, mindful adult available, that <br/>
adult will point to interesting stops along the way that they may <br/>
not know about.<br/>
Cultural literacy happens by learning about that which interests you <br/>
and being out in the world living a happy life, interacting with <br/>
many different types of people.<br/>
That is unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If he spends the rest of his life never hearing the name Christopher<br/>
Columbus, would that really be so bad for him? If the name comes up somehow,<br/>
he will probably ask. You explain and that might lead into more and it might<br/>
not. If not, is *that* really so bad?<br/>
<br/>
There are going to be lots of topics that are never viewed as interesting.<br/>
One can&#39;t know everything there is to know about everything. Some people<br/>
know a little about a lot and some a lot about a little. Doesn&#39;t really make<br/>
one person smarter than the other. He will inquire as to what interests him.<br/>
It might be trains for the rest of his life, but along with learning about<br/>
trains, he will also be picking up bits and pieces of much more.<br/>
<br/>
School is very limiting. Your life with you son won&#39;t be. Much better than<br/>
school. Can&#39;t even compare.<br/>

I was nearly 40 before I realized that &quot;pre-Columbian&quot; art had anything to do with Columbus.  And although this may be slow and dorky of me, I bet I&#39;m not the only one.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably even people that don&#39;t connect &quot;District of Columbia&quot; with Columbus.  It&#39;s not like you have to pay a fine for not knowing.<br/>

I was probably in my 30&#39;s and had been interested in word origins since I was <br/>
nine.  That  one lay dormant though, and jumped out at me one day. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are references in song to &quot;Columbia&quot; and a couple of the songs are so <br/>
good I wish sometimes the country had been called &quot;Columbia,&quot; but it wasn&#39;t and <br/>
now it&#39;s too late.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Columbus was a shit, in retrospect, but the guy &quot;America&quot; is named <br/>
after hardly even shows in the rearview mirror (or as Marty is having difficulty <br/>
not calling it, &quot;REVIEW&quot; mirror).<br/>

It doesn&#39;t make a huge amount of sense that this explorer guy&#39;s name is applied to art produced by peoples half a world away.  I think that&#39;s why it&#39;s possible to go for a long time without making a click.  Because in reality it&#39;s nonsensical. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
