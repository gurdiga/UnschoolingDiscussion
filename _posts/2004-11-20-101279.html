<div id="ygrps-yiv-755796839">I have been following this thread pretty closely.  I joined HSLDA when we<br/>
first starting hsing.   I thought I had read their website fairly well and<br/>
yes, I did see several red flags. But to be completely honest I was told I<br/>
really needed to join incase....   Being a brand new homeschooler at the<br/>
time,  I think now that I look back, I joined out of fear.  I have read the<br/>
links that have been posted here recently.  Haven&#39;t liked what I have found<br/>
I might add.  Now for what may be a silly question.....  Through reading the<br/>
posts on this subject, am I correct that many of you do not belong to such a<br/>
group.  That a group like this isn&#39;t really needed or helpful?  That my<br/>
money would be best used doing something that my girls and I would enjoy.  I<br/>
guess somewhere in the back of my mind there is this small piece of fear<br/>
that says, &quot;what if someone comes knocking....&quot;  Maybe I need to be more<br/>
confident in my understanding of the South Carolina laws.  Uhmnm, just doing<br/>
some pondering, any insight would be helpful.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The HSLDA application does not exactly state that you must be following <br/>
a curriculum. Here is what it states that you agree to:<br/>
<br/>
• To exercise diligence in teaching our children in a responsible way.<br/>
• To use a clearly organized program of education to instruct our <br/>
children.<br/>
• To keep records of each child’s educational progress.<br/>
<br/>
I have been told, directly by an HSLDA attorney, that it is easier to <br/>
defend someone using a curriculum, but that that is not a requirement <br/>
and that he has defended and is willing to defend unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not defending them. I always advise new homeschoolers in my area <br/>
that they do not need to join them, that they do not provide legal <br/>
insurance,  and that they should only send them money if they want to <br/>
help promote their extremist political agenda.<br/>
<br/>
But, for the sake of the credibility of &quot;our side,&quot; I think we should <br/>
be accurate in our complaints and criticisms.<br/>

&quot; Any children enrolled in a public homeschool program, such as a <br/>

&quot;HSLDAdoes not provide legal representation for members in matters <br/>

Since the HSLDA is the one that would make the decision to take you on as  a <br/>

 be the ones to decide if you fit the criteria or not.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to plug in something I wrote at unschooling.info/forum, and if it&#39;s <br/>
unreadable this way, the link is this:<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.info/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=7&whichpage=5,">http://unschooling.info/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=7&whichpage=5,</a> and the <br/>
post is dated 11/06/04:<br/>
 <br/>
No matter how much more radical people like Kelly and Ren are than I am, the <br/>
criticism is delivered to my address, as it were. &lt;bwg&gt; I think it&#39;s because <br/>
I&#39;ve used my real name as a &quot;screenname,&quot; and user name, and e-mail address and <br/>
never changed it. I&#39;ve never been unschsandra or kookymum or pookyschooler or <br/>
anything other than SandraDodd. So those who want to personify what they fear <br/>
or are drawn to have used me as the poster screenname. <br/>
<br/>
From the time Kirby was eight and I was on *Prodigy, I would say &quot;Unschooling <br/>
can work; it works at our house.&quot; So the questions would be &quot;HOW does it work <br/>
at your house?&quot; &quot;How are you getting this to work?&quot; &quot;Why are you not giving <br/>
up/freaking out?&quot; And I would tell them how, and why. And I would tell them why <br/>
I was so confident, which was following in the footsteps of two other <br/>
families, and having had five solid years of La Leche League-inspired attachment <br/>
parenting. I had decided after reading an article in Mothering when Kirby was a <br/>
baby not only to continue with child-led weaning, but not to require or forbid <br/>
foods, and not to &quot;do dessert.&quot; My husband and I had been together for seven <br/>
years before Kirby came, and we hadn&#39;t made a practice of having desserts after <br/>
meals anyway, so that was easy and made simple sense. We would try to ensure <br/>
that food was never an issue, nor a power struggle, nor infused with great <br/>
import or danger.<br/>
<br/>
So by the time Kirby didn&#39;t go to kindergarten (which was a tentative thing; <br/>
we were willing to see how that went and then put him in K or 1st the next <br/>
year, maybe), I didn&#39;t &quot;kind of think&quot; that he could learn and do well making his <br/>
own decisions, I KNEW. I knew because he ate all kinds of foods without being <br/>
forced, he never gorged on candy, he went to sleep when he was tired, he took <br/>
care of his things without being forced to, and he shared without being made <br/>
to. Letting him make his own decisions about how to be while we were generous <br/>
and gentle with him had worked out perfectly well. And at that time I had a <br/>
three year old doing equally well.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the way we lived as a family, unschooling worked.<br/>
The questions being asked were &quot;Why does unschooling work for you?&quot; and &quot;How <br/>
are you doing that?&quot; and &quot;What did you do?&quot; They were asking me, because I was <br/>
saying &quot;Can TOO work&quot; in the face of an onslaught of irrate criticism from <br/>
school-at-home folk.<br/>
<br/>
Then gradually the unschooling discussion was large enough to be separate, <br/>
and there were other regular contributors. Those who communicated the most <br/>
clearly and who were the most thoughtful and analytical were also seeing that one <br/>
good power struggle could cause a parent to resent a child, and a child to wish <br/>
to spite the parent. Spite and resentment do not help make an unschooling <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
So when people insist that &quot;all unschooling is&quot; is just homeschooling without <br/>
a curriculum or without lessons, I don&#39;t disagree. They should take it out <br/>
and put it on billboards. Lobby to get it into the dictionary. Whatever. But <br/>
when families come to ask how they can make unschooling work, it does no good to <br/>
say &quot;Just don&#39;t have a curriculum. See ya!&quot; It takes layers of understanding, <br/>
it takes recovery from school, and a desire to have a relationship with a <br/>
child in which learning is flowing and easy. It takes working to create an <br/>
atmosphere in which children and parents wake up happy to see the day. <br/>
<br/>
Abraham Maslow says (as teachers have studied for decades) that learning <br/>
cannot take place where there is hunger, fear, stress, or a lack of positive <br/>
regard. One known failure of school is their attempt to insert info into chldren <br/>
who are hungry, stressed, afraid, and labelled &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;slow&quot; or even &quot;average.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One known failure of homeschooling is when the parents do the same kind of <br/>
damage at home. If a child is not eating when she&#39;s hungry, sleeping when she&#39;s <br/>
tired, being with her loved ones when she wants to feel connected, and <br/>
receiving positive regard, she will not &quot;naturally&quot; want to learn. She will naturally <br/>
want to get food, companionship, safety, love.<br/>
<br/>
Some of those who have lately defined unschooling as NOT parenting-related <br/>
are also saying that no one has the right to define unschooling. Interesting <br/>
that they want to define it, then. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really care as much about the definition of unschooling as I do about <br/>
helping real individual families to unschool in a way that works, that can <br/>
last, and not just be a temporary respite from school or curriculum, but that <br/>
can be sustained and enlarging in and for their whole family. IF learning stops <br/>
where &quot;parenting&quot; starts, how will unschooling be &quot;learning from life&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a problem. Perhaps there&#39;s a disconnect between talking about <br/>
unschooling in a clinical, detached &quot;technical&quot; way, and helping actual people really <br/>
get it to work as well as it can -- not settling for &quot;good enough for the state&quot; <br/>
or &quot;academics covered,&quot; but moving on to self actualization right in one&#39;s <br/>
own home. Maslow&#39;s self-actualization has traditionally been thought to be for <br/>
adults, past school age. I look at the descriptions now, though, of <br/>
self-actualization, and I know teens who are there. Unschooled teens.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone won&#39;t decide on a definition of unschooling. It doesn&#39;t matter if no <br/>
two families decide on a definition. But when I&#39;m asked &quot;How did you do <br/>
that?&quot; I&#39;m going to be honest. It&#39;s not about academics. It&#39;s about having changed <br/>
how I saw the world and children, and then living harmoniously with my <br/>
children in a world I *know* to be filled with all the elements they need to thrive. <br/>
I suppose someone could spend a lot of volunteer time telling people how to <br/>
unschool without changing their attitude or parenting. I haven&#39;t seen that, <br/>
though, because I don&#39;t know of any truly happy and successful unschoolers who <br/>
have clung to traditional parenting. If it can work, no one who&#39;s doing it has <br/>
come out and helped others do it that way too.<br/>

<p><small><time>22 Nov 2004, at  8:03am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-735536378">I was very interested to see this post (the response<br/>
to it).  I feel the way I do so often when I read<br/>
responses about what unschooling is, how it works,<br/>
etc. from folks who have been doing it all along,<br/>
which is badly -read guilty- that I ever sent my kids<br/>
to school in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing whatever we&#39;re doing since the<br/>
summer.  We started out &#39;homeschooling lite&#39; no<br/>
curriculum, just projects and journal entries and then<br/>
I read about &#39;de-schooling&#39; which made sense so I<br/>
stopped all formal education stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I just wondered if there are folks out there who have<br/>
made the adjustment from taking the kids out of school<br/>
and would share experiences/advice.  This is a<br/>
decompression period for me as well as I went back to<br/>
work when Aaron was three (my husband came home) and<br/>
worked long hours for the next 2.5 yrs.  We did<br/>
attachment parenting, child-led weaning and have never<br/>
restricted food or been very strict about bed times,<br/>
so the &#39;unschooling&#39; lifestyle doesn&#39;t seem much of a<br/>
stretch for us.  <br/>
<br/>
But now with them home all day and the weather getting<br/>
cold, I find myself stuck.  They want to stay home all<br/>
day, not go into the yard (till the snow comes at<br/>
least) not do anything except play X Box and watch TV.<br/>
 This is not MY best season, so the biggest problem<br/>
with all that is that I need to get out of the house<br/>
most days (if not every day) to avoid serious seasonal<br/>
depression.  On the days I insist (and tell them flat<br/>
out that it&#39;s for me - that I just can&#39;t sit in the<br/>
house all day) there&#39;s always a struggle about getting<br/>
ready, etc. and often they complain on the subway (we<br/>
live in the NYC area and have no car), but in the end<br/>
we usually have an incident-free good time.  When<br/>
there is an incident, I feel badly because, after all,<br/>
I *forced* them to come out in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m conflicted about how hands on to be.  I<br/>
read something about &#39;strewing&#39; (on this list I think)<br/>
a couple of months ago, but my attempts are so obvious<br/>
to them - they just roll their eyes as if to say,<br/>
&#39;come on, do you think we don&#39;t know what you&#39;re<br/>
trying to do?&#39;.  I want them to have freedom (and they<br/>
do) and be able to make good decisions (which we&#39;re<br/>
working on) and occasionally get out of the house (at<br/>
least until they are old enough to stay home alone so<br/>
I can engage with the outside world)  Does anyone else<br/>
out there have a bunch of little homebodies?  Any<br/>
creative suggestions on getting them out to do things<br/>
you know they usually love to do (not to mention<br/>
trying something new).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this post went on, but it&#39;s so amazing to have a<br/>
group of people who can relate.  When I talk to (most<br/>
of) my friends about it, they&#39;re like, &quot;well get out<br/>
of the house and away from those kids -- no wonder<br/>
you&#39;re loosing your mind!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Pamela - who is already getting cabin fever even<br/>
though it&#39;s only November! <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and the <br/>
&gt; post is dated 11/06/04:<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; No matter how much more radical people like Kelly<br/>
&gt; and Ren are than I am, the <br/>
&gt; criticism is delivered to my address, as it were.<br/>
&gt; &lt;bwg&gt; I think it&#39;s because <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve used my real name as a &quot;screenname,&quot; and user<br/>
&gt; name, and e-mail address and <br/>
&gt; never changed it. I&#39;ve never been unschsandra or<br/>
&gt; kookymum or pookyschooler or <br/>
&gt; anything other than SandraDodd. So those who want to<br/>
&gt; personify what they fear <br/>
&gt; or are drawn to have used me as the poster<br/>
&gt; screenname. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the time Kirby was eight and I was on *Prodigy,<br/>
&gt; I would say &quot;Unschooling <br/>
&gt; can work; it works at our house.&quot; So the questions<br/>
&gt; would be &quot;HOW does it work <br/>
&gt; at your house?&quot; &quot;How are you getting this to work?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Why are you not giving <br/>
&gt; up/freaking out?&quot; And I would tell them how, and<br/>
&gt; why. And I would tell them why <br/>
&gt; I was so confident, which was following in the<br/>
&gt; footsteps of two other <br/>
&gt; families, and having had five solid years of La<br/>
&gt; Leche League-inspired attachment <br/>
&gt; parenting. I had decided after reading an article in<br/>
&gt; Mothering when Kirby was a <br/>
&gt; baby not only to continue with child-led weaning,<br/>
&gt; but not to require or forbid <br/>
&gt; foods, and not to &quot;do dessert.&quot; My husband and I had<br/>
&gt; been together for seven <br/>
&gt; years before Kirby came, and we hadn&#39;t made a<br/>
&gt; practice of having desserts after <br/>
&gt; meals anyway, so that was easy and made simple<br/>
&gt; sense. We would try to ensure <br/>
&gt; that food was never an issue, nor a power struggle,<br/>
&gt; nor infused with great <br/>
&gt; import or danger.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So by the time Kirby didn&#39;t go to kindergarten<br/>
&gt; (which was a tentative thing; <br/>
&gt; we were willing to see how that went and then put<br/>
&gt; him in K or 1st the next <br/>
&gt; year, maybe), I didn&#39;t &quot;kind of think&quot; that he could<br/>
&gt; learn and do well making his <br/>
&gt; own decisions, I KNEW. I knew because he ate all<br/>
&gt; kinds of foods without being <br/>
&gt; forced, he never gorged on candy, he went to sleep<br/>
&gt; when he was tired, he took <br/>
&gt; care of his things without being forced to, and he<br/>
&gt; shared without being made <br/>
&gt; to. Letting him make his own decisions about how to<br/>
&gt; be while we were generous <br/>
&gt; and gentle with him had worked out perfectly well.<br/>
&gt; And at that time I had a <br/>
&gt; three year old doing equally well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because of the way we lived as a family, unschooling<br/>
&gt; worked.<br/>
&gt; The questions being asked were &quot;Why does unschooling<br/>
&gt; work for you?&quot; and &quot;How <br/>
&gt; are you doing that?&quot; and &quot;What did you do?&quot; They<br/>
&gt; were asking me, because I was <br/>
&gt; saying &quot;Can TOO work&quot; in the face of an onslaught of<br/>
&gt; irrate criticism from <br/>
&gt; school-at-home folk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then gradually the unschooling discussion was large<br/>
&gt; enough to be separate, <br/>
&gt; and there were other regular contributors. Those who<br/>
&gt; communicated the most <br/>
&gt; clearly and who were the most thoughtful and<br/>
&gt; analytical were also seeing that one <br/>
&gt; good power struggle could cause a parent to resent a<br/>
&gt; child, and a child to wish <br/>
&gt; to spite the parent. Spite and resentment do not<br/>
&gt; help make an unschooling <br/>
&gt; environment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So when people insist that &quot;all unschooling is&quot; is<br/>
&gt; just homeschooling without <br/>
&gt; a curriculum or without lessons, I don&#39;t disagree.<br/>
&gt; They should take it out <br/>
&gt; and put it on billboards. Lobby to get it into the<br/>
&gt; dictionary. Whatever. But <br/>
&gt; when families come to ask how they can make<br/>
&gt; unschooling work, it does no good to <br/>
&gt; say &quot;Just don&#39;t have a curriculum. See ya!&quot; It takes<br/>
&gt; layers of understanding, <br/>
&gt; it takes recovery from school, and a desire to have<br/>
&gt; a relationship with a <br/>
&gt; child in which learning is flowing and easy. It<br/>
&gt; takes working to create an <br/>
&gt; atmosphere in which children and parents wake up<br/>
&gt; happy to see the day. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Abraham Maslow says (as teachers have studied for<br/>
&gt; decades) that learning <br/>
&gt; cannot take place where there is hunger, fear,<br/>
&gt; stress, or a lack of positive <br/>
&gt; regard. One known failure of school is their attempt<br/>
&gt; to insert info into chldren <br/>
&gt; who are hungry, stressed, afraid, and labelled &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
&gt; or &quot;slow&quot; or even &quot;average.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One known failure of homeschooling is when the<br/>
&gt; parents do the same kind of <br/>
&gt; damage at home. If a child is not eating when she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; hungry, sleeping when she&#39;s <br/>
&gt; tired, being with her loved ones when she wants to<br/>
&gt; feel connected, and <br/>
&gt; receiving positive regard, she will not &quot;naturally&quot;<br/>
&gt; want to learn. She will naturally <br/>
&gt; want to get food, companionship, safety, love.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of those who have lately defined unschooling as<br/>
&gt; NOT parenting-related <br/>
&gt; are also saying that no one has the right to define<br/>
&gt; unschooling. Interesting <br/>
&gt; that they want to define it, then. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t really care as much about the definition of<br/>
&gt; unschooling as I do about <br/>
&gt; helping real individual families to unschool in a<br/>
&gt; way that works, that can <br/>
&gt; last, and not just be a temporary respite from<br/>
&gt; school or curriculum, but that <br/>
&gt; can be sustained and enlarging in and for their<br/>
&gt; whole family. IF learning stops <br/>
&gt; where &quot;parenting&quot; starts, how will unschooling be<br/>
&gt; &quot;learning from life&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a problem. Perhaps there&#39;s a disconnect between<br/>
&gt; talking about <br/>
&gt; unschooling in a clinical, detached &quot;technical&quot; way,<br/>
&gt; and helping actual people really <br/>
&gt; get it to work as well as it can -- not settling for<br/>
&gt; &quot;good enough for the state&quot; <br/>
&gt; or &quot;academics covered,&quot; but moving on to self<br/>
&gt; actualization right in one&#39;s <br/>
&gt; own home. Maslow&#39;s self-actualization has<br/>
&gt; traditionally been thought to be for <br/>
&gt; adults, past school age. I look at the descriptions<br/>
&gt; now, though, of <br/>
&gt; self-actualization, and I know teens who are there.<br/>
&gt; Unschooled teens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone won&#39;t decide on a definition of<br/>
&gt; unschooling. It doesn&#39;t matter if no <br/>
&gt; two families decide on a definition. But when I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; asked &quot;How did you do <br/>
&gt; that?&quot; I&#39;m going to be honest. It&#39;s not about<br/>
&gt; academics. It&#39;s about having changed <br/>
&gt; how I saw the world and children, and then living<br/>
&gt; harmoniously with my <br/>
&gt; children in a world I *know* to be filled with all<br/>
&gt; the elements they need to thrive. <br/>
&gt; I suppose someone could spend a lot of volunteer<br/>
&gt; time telling people how to <br/>
&gt; unschool without changing their attitude or<br/>
&gt; parenting. I haven&#39;t seen that, <br/>
&gt; though, because I don&#39;t know of any truly happy and<br/>
&gt; successful <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought maybe not everybody is really familiar with the Maslow <br/>
hierarchy of needs so I found this explanation. His point is that <br/>
everybody has needs and when those needs are met, others sort of pop up <br/>
to replace them.<br/>
<br/>
Physiological - First most basic needs are for air, water, food, sleep, <br/>
sex, health, and so on. This includes the need to get rid of physical <br/>
illness or pain or discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
Safety - These are psychological needs for stability and security of a <br/>
home and family and feeling safe in the world. The need for the world <br/>
to make sense, to be logical and orderly, and to have some kind of <br/>
consistency.<br/>
<br/>
Love and belongingness are next on the ladder. Humans have a desire to <br/>
belong to groups: clubs, work groups, religious groups, family, gangs, <br/>
etc. We need to feel loved (non-sexual) by others, to be accepted by <br/>
others.  We need to be needed.<br/>
<br/>
Next self-esteem which results from competence or mastery of a task. <br/>
And also there&#39;s the attention and recognition that comes from others. <br/>
This is similar to the belongingness level, however, wanting admiration <br/>
has to do with the need for power, competence, ability.<br/>
<br/>
Self-Actualization<br/>
The need for self-actualization is &quot;the desire to become more and more <br/>
what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.&quot; <br/>
They can seek knowledge, peace, esthetic experiences, self-fulfillment, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra that unschooling means nothing more than not doing <br/>
school at home and not imposing the trappings of school on our <br/>
children. But unschooling successfully relies on our kids being in that <br/>
&quot;self-actualization&quot; stage on Maslow&#39;s hierarchy. Children who have <br/>
their other needs met will experience the need for self-actualization <br/>
and that is what unschoolers mean when they say things like, &quot;Kids are <br/>
natural learners, just support their interests and passions.&quot; It is <br/>
obvious that you cannot punish, starve, beat, deprive, or shame a kid <br/>
into being a &quot;natural learner.&quot; What is less obvious, but just as true, <br/>
is that an unschooling parent&#39;s primary job is to provide for their <br/>
child&#39;s lower needs to be met so that the self-actualization need <br/>
becomes primary for them and THEN to help them and support them in <br/>
satisfying their desire to become everything they are capable of <br/>
becoming.<br/>
<br/>
So lots and lots of talk on the unschooling topic will necessarily <br/>
always be about how unschooling works and THAT is always going to be <br/>
about how to get all those other needs met so that the kids can <br/>
function and live in the &quot;self-actualization&quot; stage. Once they are <br/>
there - then unschooling just flows easily and it is obviously a <br/>
wonderful satisfying way to live.<br/>
<br/>
You know, for YEARS unschoolers have tried to come up with terminology <br/>
that would indicate more what we &quot;do&quot; rather than what we do not do <br/>
(school). Maybe something that describes what we do as a sort of <br/>
Maslowian Self-Actualization Program would work! &lt;G&gt; Instead of saying, <br/>
&quot;We&#39;re unschoolers,&quot; maybe we could say we&#39;re &quot;Maslowians.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of other interesting things about Maslow&#39;s ideas, <br/>
that apply to unschooling - this post is long so I&#39;ll put them in a <br/>
different one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-461881864">One of the things Maslow did was to ask people about their ideal life <br/>
or what an ideal world would be like -- and from that  he could figure <br/>
out what needs they have or haven&#39;t had met.<br/>
<br/>
He also thought that sometimes extreme problems in getting basic needs <br/>
met - like death of a parent or divorce or periods of hunger as a child <br/>
or abuse at the hands of a parent - these things could make someone get <br/>
stuck at that level for their whole life - never be able to really feel <br/>
that their needs in that area are satisfied and so constantly be trying <br/>
to meet those needs and therefore never be able to move to the next <br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
Also - all the lower-level needs are &quot;deficit&quot; needs - when you do <br/>
fulfill them you don&#39;t feel them anymore. But self-actualization needs <br/>
actually get stronger as you fill them.<br/>
<br/>
Maslow looked at historical figures who seemed to be obviously in the <br/>
&quot;self-actualization&quot; level and looked at characteristics they had in <br/>
common.  They were &quot;reality-centered&quot; meaning they were aware of what <br/>
was fake and what was genuine. They were &#39;solution-oriented&quot; when faced <br/>
with problems they immediately looked for solutions. They thought <br/>
process as important as product, means as important as ends. They liked <br/>
significant amounts of solitude in their lives and had deeper and fewer <br/>
relationships. They tended to be somewhat conventional on the surface <br/>
and noncomformists below the surface. They had strong, but not hostile, <br/>
senses of humor - often joking at their own expense. They didn&#39;t try to <br/>
change other people, but did try to be better themselves. They had a <br/>
lot of humility and respect for others. They tended to be more creative <br/>
and inventive and original and they tended to have more &quot;peak <br/>
experiences&quot; - experiences that put them in touch with the infinite and <br/>
eternal. People in the self-actualization stage can still have problems <br/>
- grief, sorrow, and even guilt and anxiety, but their responses <br/>
reflect the listed characteristics.</div>

still going through the Maslow levels, but I think those kids from <br/>
around 9 to 12 whom we sometimes describe as &quot;soaking up learning like <br/>
a sponge&quot; or are sometimes described as being in the &quot;fact-gathering <br/>
stage,&quot; are at least in some kind of kid equivalent of Maslow&#39;s <br/>
&quot;Self-Actualization&quot; stage.<br/>

Debbie - it is good to see you here and I&#39;m SO sorry to learn of your <br/>
loss. My heart goes out to you.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 17 yo and she doesn&#39;t know what she wants to do and she <br/>
dabbles in all kinds of things - even taking some college courses, but <br/>
not enrolled in a full college program - and, in fact, neither does my <br/>
18 yo niece know what she wants to do, but she is going to go to <br/>
college next year anyway - to a &quot;liberal arts&quot; college - just because <br/>
it is expected. BIG price tag for a kid who has no reason for even <br/>
going (other than that that is what she&#39;s expected to do).<br/>
<br/>
I have a 20 year old who DOES know what she wants to do and she&#39;ll be <br/>
going to a college this spring with purpose in mind and that&#39;s awesome. <br/>
I&#39;m a college professor and I try really hard to discourage kids from <br/>
going to college unless they can explain (to themselves, at least) what <br/>
they&#39;re doing there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can arm your 15 yo with the information that you have an <br/>
online friend who is a college professor and she thinks that 15 yo&#39;s <br/>
should not be thinking about college as if that is a sensible goal in <br/>
and of itself, but should be experimenting with all kinds of activities <br/>
and pursuing those that interest them and that, eventually, if college <br/>
turns out to be something that will help them, they&#39;ll figure that out <br/>
when the time is right.<br/>

This really struck a cord with me.  One of my very best friends recently<br/>
adopted a boy who had been removed from his home for abuse and neglect.  He<br/>
then spent 5 years in various foster homes (He was also removed from a<br/>
foster home because of abuse).  The problem now is that he can&#39;t seem to<br/>
regulate his food intake.  If his mom doesn&#39;t tell him he&#39;s had enough, he<br/>
will eat until he throws up.  He also steals food and hides to eat it, even<br/>
though they almost always say yes to any request for food.  He recently got<br/>
up when the rest of the family was sleeping and ate two dozen cookies.  I<br/>
wonder if he will be stuck with this unfulfilled need his whole life.  I<br/>
suggested &quot;unfooding&quot; him, by just letting him eat whatever he wants, but<br/>
between him throwing up, and eating all of the entire family&#39;s goodies she<br/>
just doesn&#39;t think it will work.  Any suggestions?<br/>

Cheaper cookies.  Vanilla wafers.   Peanut butter.   Cheese.   <br/>
Throwing up won&#39;t be forever.   <br/>
<br/>
Cooking with him, so maybe he sees the hard work that went into making the <br/>
stuff and he won&#39;t want to eat it all.<br/>

Eating until he throws up won&#39;t kill him.  Models do it all the time.  (A <br/>

aware of how time-consuming food prep can be.  They have four other kids and<br/>
keep a very well stocked pantry, plus my friend&#39;s DH is a chef and cooks all<br/>
kinds of fabulous things.  He has access to a lot of food, but it&#39;s never<br/>
enough.  He steals his siblings&#39; Halloween candy.  He stole and ate the<br/>
snacks his teacher keeps in her desk.  He sneaks candy at home, although he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to.  He scavenges candy off the floor of the car, etc.  If the<br/>
problem is emotional eating, what else can be done so that the throwing up<br/>
*isn&#39;t* forever?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

suggested &quot;unfooding&quot; him, by just letting him eat whatever he wants, but<br/>
between him throwing up, and eating all of the entire family&#39;s goodies she<br/>
just doesn&#39;t think it will work.  Any suggestions? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cheaper cookies.  Vanilla wafers.   Peanut butter.   Cheese.   <br/>
Throwing up won&#39;t be forever.   <br/>
<br/>
Cooking with him, so maybe he sees the hard work that went into making the<br/>
stuff and he won&#39;t want to eat it all.<br/>
<br/>
Eating until he throws up won&#39;t kill him.  Models do it all the time.  (A<br/>
joke, a bad joke.)<br/>

have the man say,  &quot;Oh, dear,  you had a little too much...  oy, it must <br/>

He stole and ate the snacks his teacher keeps in her<br/>
desk. He sneaks candy at home, although he doesn&#39;t<br/>
have to. He scavenges candy off the floor of the car,<br/>
etc.  If the problem is emotional eating, what else<br/>
can be done so that the throwing up *isn&#39;t* forever?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I suspect, though his parents have allowed him the<br/>
freedom to eat as much as he wants and throw up as<br/>
much as he wants, that this is still a control issue,<br/>
and there is a lot still there to keep him obsessive<br/>
about it. He knows he&#39;s not supposed to do it, and<br/>
that he&#39;s supposed to get better. I was allowed<br/>
freedom of eating, but there was a tacit understanding<br/>
in our family that one could eat too much (and that I<br/>
*was* eating too much) and that some foods were bad.<br/>
This was enough to create an unhealthy craving in me.<br/>
I snuck food too, because I felt ashamed -- I bet he<br/>
does too. <br/>
<br/>
It has been a hard, hard habit to break, and I feel<br/>
like I&#39;m still recovering at 38 years of age. I think<br/>
you said they had been at this for several months,<br/>
well, it just may take longer than that for him to get<br/>
emotionally healthy. What&#39;s more is that with the<br/>
crazy eating his chemical feedback system may be<br/>
messed up -- he may literally not be able to recognize<br/>
anymore when his body needs him to stop. <br/>
<br/>
What worked for me was to get out of that judgemental<br/>
environment -- living alone. With no one looking over<br/>
my shoulder, I could relax a little, so that the<br/>
relational issues were no longer overwhelmingly at the<br/>
forefront of my consciousness and I could begin to<br/>
really feel and listen to what was happening to my<br/>
body, and feel that my decisions ultimately rested<br/>
with me and what *I* wanted and believed. I assume<br/>
they either don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t do this for him<br/>
(allowing him enough of his own space that his food<br/>
preparation and intake can be separate from the rest<br/>
of the family&#39;s.) All I can think is going as extreme<br/>
Sudbury as they can stand. In other words, give him<br/>
not only freedom of eating, but also freedom from<br/>
their judgement (implying freedom to make his own<br/>
judgements.) I think, short of shaming or forcing him<br/>
to stop, that that is all that will work permanently<br/>
and deeply and long-term. <br/>

&lt;&lt;  He has access to a lot of food, but it&#39;s never<br/>
enough.  He steals his siblings&#39; Halloween candy.  He stole and ate the<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine broke her neck when she was 24 and lived in the hospital for <br/>
a couple of years, outlasting every other patient AND every other nurse or <br/>
attendant.   She was on a neurological ward, and I met several of her roommates. <br/>
 One day I went to see her and her door was tied shut with sheets, through <br/>
the handle to the handrail.<br/>
<br/>
Turned out they had moved her and put another patient in there, because it <br/>
had a stronger, harder window.  They were afraid this guy might go out the <br/>
window, even though it was the 7th floor or so.<br/>
<br/>
It was tied shut because it was mealtime.<br/>
<br/>
This guy had been hit by a train, and he was hardly even hurt, physically, <br/>
but it was such a blow to the head that he had brain damage.  And what had been <br/>
damaged was the part of him that would say &quot;Oh, that&#39;s enough food now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He was starving.  He would eat salt and pepper packets and drink shampoo.  <br/>
The night before, he had gone to the rack of dinner trays and been grabbing <br/>
everything he could reach and shoving it in his mouth, and had ruined twenty trays <br/>
or so before they stopped him, so his door was tied shut long enough for them <br/>
to distribute other meals.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how it was treated, but it did make me know that there&#39;s such a <br/>
thing as a switch that says &quot;full&quot; and his had been broken.<br/>
