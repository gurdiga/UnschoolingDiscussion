a pillow and stay with that one while the older one did whatever (unless it<br/>
was the hottest or coldest part of the year).&lt;&lt; Sandra<br/>

::splort!:: Nice segue, Sandra. I was still on the conjugal issue, and you<br/>
go right into &quot;early morning stuff&quot; and I&#39;m still trying to figure out why<br/>
you&#39;re kicking the toddler out into the car while you had time with Keith<br/>
and... oh! It&#39;s a different topic!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, &quot;early morning stuff&quot; is one of my favorites, and I don&#39;t mean swimming<br/>
lessons!<br/>
