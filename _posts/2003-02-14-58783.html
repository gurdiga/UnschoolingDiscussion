<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485160482">But before I go, since someone asked I will say something about why I would consider myself unschooled as an adult, and the pitfalls of unschooling my sister and I have encountered.  Remember, too, that I still support unschooling, maybe not such radical unschooling as many of you support, but a more moderate approach to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I attended school on days when I felt like it, and stayed home when I felt like it, except when the school would send home notices or call my parents and tell them that I would fail my grade and be left back.  At those times my mother would encourage me (but not insist) to go, even if I would rather stay home; she didn&#39;t know there were other options in the 60&#39;s.  Grades were unimportant to them.  I watched as much tv as I wanted, in fact, I was one of the only kids I knew who had unlimited access to television, including a television in my room -- and I watched a lot of tv!  I went to bed when I wanted, I ate what I wanted, etc...  My parents trusted my judgments, and let me make my own decisions.  I was unconditionally loved, and I was supported in my decisions, to the best of may parent&#39;s abilities.<br/>
<br/>
As adults, my sister and I have real problems with organization, persistence in difficult or unpleasant but necessary tasks - oh this clearly requires more time to explain, and I do not have the time - but the results are disorganized homes; difficulty finishing projects begun; unclaimed medical reimbursements due to loss of paperwork, or lapse of time; procrastination; this list goes on...  There were incredible benefits, too:  we felt treasured and respected, we are both quite creative and able to &quot;think outside the box&quot;, our stress levels were nil; for the most part, it was a very happy childhood for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to strive for with my own children are the good aspects of the life we led, while gently guiding them away from the stumbling blocks.  Oh this is all falling on so many deaf ears, so I don&#39;t know why I bothered, but these past couple of days posting to the list have been interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, but all too time-consuming.  Best of luck to all of you on the paths you have chosen.  I wish for all of you and your children the beauty that life has to offer, and lives filled with peace, purpose, and satisfaction.  -- Lynda <br/>

they think they were leaving your education to the experts or were they <br/>
guiding you, strewing your path and engaging your mind? On the days you <br/>
stayed home, what did they do with you?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, even the most radical kind, does not mean leaving children <br/>
alone  24/7. It means staying connected, presenting new ideas, getting <br/>
excited with them over new discoveries, answering their questions and asking <br/>
more back. It&#39;s not neglect.<br/>

that clear. :o) Just fishing around for more info and making a general <br/>

  &gt;&gt;The Pa unschoolers list is where I meant (and also where we are a bit off <br/>
  &gt;&gt;topic lately).  I was hoping to spark some discussion.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Sure. forward away then. :o)<br/>

  &gt;   &gt;Do you mind if I forward this to the Pa list?  I&#39;d like to get a <br/>
  &gt;discussion<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;going about unschooling again as things have gotten off topic of <br/>
  &gt;late.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   I&#39;m not sure what you mean. What Pa list? Off topic here on this list or <br/>
  &gt;the<br/>
  &gt;   Pa list?<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;I attended school on days when I felt like it, and stayed home <br/>
  when I felt <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;like it, except when the school would send home notices or call <br/>
  my parents <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;and tell them that I would fail my grade and be left back.  At <br/>
  those times <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;my mother would encourage me (but not insist) to go, even if I <br/>
  would <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;rather stay home; she didn&#39;t know there were other options in the <br/>
  60&#39;s.  <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;Grades were unimportant to them.  I watched as much tv as I <br/>
  wanted, in <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;fact, I was one of the only kids I knew who had unlimited access <br/>
  to <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;television, including a television in my room -- and I watched a <br/>
  lot of <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;tv!  I went to bed when I wanted, I ate what I wanted, etc...  My <br/>
  parents <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;trusted my judgments, and let me make my own decisions.  I was <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;unconditionally loved, and I was supported in my decisions, to <br/>
  the best of <br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;may parent&#39;s abilities.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Were your parents around interacting with you and your sister each <br/>
  day? Did <br/>
  &gt; they think they were leaving your education to the experts or were <br/>
  they <br/>
  &gt; guiding you, strewing your path and engaging your mind? On the days <br/>
  you <br/>
  &gt; stayed home, what did they do with you?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Unschooling, even the most radical kind, does not mean leaving <br/>
  children <br/>
  &gt; alone  24/7. It means staying connected, presenting new ideas, <br/>
  getting <br/>
  &gt; excited with them over new discoveries, answering their questions <br/>
  and asking <br/>
  &gt; more back. It&#39;s not neglect.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Life is good.<br/>
  &gt; ~Mary<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;Did it sound like I was neglected?  Not at all.  My parents spent <br/>
  endless hours with us - more than any other parents I knew.  And my <br/>
  mother, in particular, spent endless hours of focused attention <br/>
  talking with us, listening to us, supporting us, and filling our <br/>
  world with opportunities.  I only hope I can do the same for my <br/>
  children. Love you Mom! -- Lynda<br/>
