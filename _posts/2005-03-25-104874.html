<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094131258">Hi I am Joy new to group age 29 two children living with us age 16 <br/>
and  5. Does anyone in this Group Live in Ky? How can my children get <br/>
a diploma  with unschooling in this state isnt it required to get a <br/>
job anymore?<br/>
===========================<br/>
 <br/>
Hi, Joy.<br/>
 <br/>
Please read the list&#39;s description and guidelines, <br/>
_http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/_ <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/) <br/>
 <br/>
or <br/>
here:<br/>
_http://sandradodd.com/lists/info_ (http://sandradodd.com/lists/info) <br/>
 <br/>
Particular regional information might be found at _www.unschooling.com_ <br/>
(http://www.unschooling.com) , in the message boards  here:<br/>
_http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/1078/1078.html?FridayMarch18200511<br/>
50pm_ <br/>
(http://www.unschooling.com/discus/messages/1078/1078.html?FridayMarch1820051150pm) <br/>
 <br/>
and if you click &quot;topics&quot; in the box at the bottom of any of those pages,  <br/>
you can find many discussions for newcomers to unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
The unschooling discussion list is more for the discussion of general  issues <br/>
helpful to all unschoolers and we have a large, international readership,  so <br/>
we try to avoid discussion of local laws.  <br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s a Kentucky page I found with google.<br/>
_http://kyhomeschool.info/_ (http://kyhomeschool.info/) <br/>
 <br/>
When you&#39;ve read the list for a week or two, you can post, but please keep  <br/>
the questions more general and of interest to people all over the place.   <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Sandra<br/>
