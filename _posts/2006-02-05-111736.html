<div id="ygrps-yiv-267520908">I have toyed around with unschooling, and relaxed homeschooling and <br/>
was curious about a couple of things. My kids aren&#39;t the type to <br/>
really pursue an interest (other than video games) on their own. I <br/>
think there are some things learned through gaming, but there has <br/>
got to be more than that.<br/>
<br/>
What exactly do your kids do? Any kids learning Algebra simply <br/>
because they want to? Foreign Language?<br/>
<br/>
My kids gets lots of practice reading and writing through their <br/>
gaming interests, but we are at a loss for math. We are approaching <br/>
high school and right now are enrolled in a cyber charter school. <br/>
They are forced to do the higher maths, history etc... I&#39;m not sure <br/>
they would do any of this on their own if we dropped the cyber <br/>
charter. <br/>
<br/>
How do you get your kids to want to learn algebra, geometry, <br/>
calculus? I can&#39;t really find any everyday uses for these maths.<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t the type to just pick up a book and read it. They do <br/>
read websites, but that&#39;s about it. Do your kids read for the sheer <br/>
enjoyment of it?<br/>
<br/>
What are your kids into? What are they learning from it? We kind of <br/>
did unschool for a few years but they didn&#39;t do much. They are not <br/>
behind their peers because of it, but they want to do it again and I <br/>
am hesitant now that they are approaching high school.   <br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m trying to get at is does it take a certain KIND of <br/>
kid to unschool successfully? The type to find a topic and really <br/>
get into it? Mine don&#39;t do that. Also, how do you encourage learning <br/>
of high school subjects?<br/>

No, it takes a certain kind of parent to unschool successfully.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;The type to find a topic and really<br/>
get into it? Mine don&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Having been told what is important to learn and how to learn it,<br/>
doesn&#39;t facilitate much joy. Yours haven&#39;t had the opportunity to do<br/>
that first of all...secondly, why do they have to find a topic and<br/>
&quot;get into it&quot;?<br/>
Dabbling with lots of different things is ok too.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Also, how do you encourage learning<br/>
of high school subjects?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why would you want to do that?  Why are high school subjects important<br/>
to you? How do they help a person live a balanced, joyful life?<br/>
<br/>
Before you can even consider unschooling, you might want to examine<br/>
your reasons and why you think school subjects are necessary.<br/>
I didn&#39;t learn anything of value in school, everything I learned that<br/>
is of value to me today, was learned from pure interest.  Unschoolers<br/>
trust in real learning, which means that if a person is enjoying an<br/>
activity, there is learning happening.<br/>

<br/>
Elementary school subjects are important to me because you have to <br/>
be able to read and write and do basic math in order to function in <br/>
life. I&#39;m ok with unschooling these years because I think you DO get <br/>
enough practice in these areas just by living life.<br/>
<br/>
High school subjects were really useless to me,personally. I never <br/>
used anything that I learned in school past the 6th grade. But...I <br/>
chose to not go to college and stay home with my family. Aren&#39;t high <br/>
school subjects necessary for college? Aren&#39;t they necessary for <br/>
some jobs? One of my children wants to be a veterinarian--won&#39;t she <br/>
have to study some advanced math to acheive that goal? Right now, <br/>
the other two have no desire for college (they are 12 and 13), but <br/>
what if they change their minds and find that they can&#39;t go to <br/>
college because they never learned algebra or geometry?<br/>
<br/>
We tried unschooling for several years, we just didn&#39;t do school. <br/>
They didn&#39;t get into anything but gaming. They didn&#39;t &quot;dabble in <br/>
alot of things&quot;. or pursue any interests other than gaming related <br/>
activities. They seem to have learned everything they needed to know <br/>
up to this point from this but I was concerned that if they change <br/>
their minds about college we will hedge them in, do you know what I <br/>
mean? The 13 year old would like to learn programming, and that <br/>
takes advanced math--but he doesn&#39;t have the motivation to bother to <br/>
learn it on his own. He just figures &quot;I don&#39;t know that kind of <br/>
math, so I can&#39;t learn programming&quot;, rather than the goal being <br/>
enough for him to buckle down and learn it on his own. <br/>
<br/>
Are your kids motivated enough to teach themselves what they need to <br/>
know to acheive their goals?<br/>

Here&#39;s a really great &quot;rant&quot; on just that subject, believe it or not,  <br/>
written by one of the brothers who has the NPR show, &quot;Car Talk.&quot;  And he  doesn&#39;t <br/>

 <br/>
One other note on foreign language:  For years I tried to get my kids  to <br/>
learn a foreign language, and probably bought every program imaginable to get  <br/>
them interested in it.  Well my (now 22 year old) daughter got a job at the  <br/>
only Mexican Restaurant in town, and now speaks fluent, and I mean FLUENT  <br/>
spanish...she never would have learned this from a curriculum.  And my son  just got <br/>
hired there (he&#39;s 17, first job) so most likely, he&#39;ll learn it  also.  They <br/>
will learn what they want to learn and what they need to learn  to be what and <br/>
who they want to be! :o)<br/>

Are you?<br/>
Do you ever watch DVDs in other languages, or put the French  <br/>

<br/>
Do you mess with math puzzles and show the kids the fun parts?   <br/>
(Would you do it if you didn&#39;t have kids?)<br/>
<br/>
When you need to figure out something like how much potting soil to  <br/>
buy or how much cloth, do you figure it out aloud and let the kids  <br/>
share in your calculations?<br/>

<br/>
It takes a certain parental attitude.  We can help you find that!   <br/>
And as you find it, it will change your kids, and it will change  <br/>
you.  It will change the relationship between you and them.  It will  <br/>
change the way you see learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We are approaching<br/>
high school and right now are enrolled in a cyber charter school.<br/>
They are forced to do the higher maths, history etc...-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re in school, unschooling isn&#39;t an issue.  If they&#39;ve been in  <br/>
school and being taught, they&#39;ve been learning more than anything  <br/>
else not to do things they don&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to do.  Bummer.<br/>
<br/>
School &quot;forces&quot; them to do higher maths?<br/>
School &quot;forces&quot; them to &quot;do&quot; history?  What would &quot;doing history&quot;  <br/>
really be?<br/>
<br/>
-=-My kids aren&#39;t the type to just pick up a book and read it. They do<br/>

<br/>
If you want to read a website, try this one:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
Tell me when  you think &quot;that&#39;s about it.&quot;  (Oh... follow at least  <br/>
half of the links, too!)<br/>
<br/>
-=-What are your kids into? What are they learning from it? We kind of<br/>
did unschool for a few years but they didn&#39;t do much.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Kind of doing unschooling is not unschooling.  If it&#39;s just not doing  <br/>
school, it&#39;s a vacation, a lull.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re going about this as backwards as the school system. Telling him<br/>
he &quot;needs&quot; to learn higher math in order to do programming isn&#39;t true.<br/>
One can learn all they need of math by DOING programming.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a great way to squelch his joy and interest, that&#39;s all.<br/>
When my child is interested in learning something new, we go after<br/>
information on that topic, we don&#39;t pre-learn all the skills you might<br/>
need in order to do that thing...we just DO it!<br/>
<br/>
Trevor learned how to build a computer, network, repair and some basic<br/>
HTML because he loves technology. When he needed information, we found<br/>
a fun person for him to hang out with that was a computer whiz and<br/>
through their friendship, Trevor learned all he wanted for that time<br/>
in his life.<br/>
Mostly he games. That&#39;s ok. He doesn&#39;t need to worry about college<br/>
until college is in his sights.  How would an adult go back to school<br/>
in their 30&#39;s or 40&#39;s (or any other age)?  The same way anyone goes to<br/>
college, by finding out the requirements, fulfilling them (or finding<br/>
a community college to start with) and doing some test prep.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re looking for interest everywhere but where your child actually<br/>
HAS interest. Any topic a person loves (including gaming) can lead to<br/>
everything in the UNIVERSE. Truly.<br/>
<br/>
If you want unschooling to work for the older ages, you have to trust<br/>
it first. Right now, you trust school topics more than the passions<br/>
your child has this very moment. That isn&#39;t going to help them feel<br/>
validated.<br/>
<br/>
The things you labelled as important school topics at elementary ages<br/>
are easily picked up by living LIFE. Nothing changes when a person<br/>
gets older as far as natural learning goes. Human beings that are<br/>
alive and growing are learning. Learning is just part of living and<br/>
growing.....<br/>
You&#39;re worrying about what you&#39;re kids aren&#39;t doing, and you&#39;re<br/>
missing all  the cool things they ARE doing. Life is short, look away<br/>
from school and see them for the interesting human beings they are.<br/>
Not broken, not missing anything. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve talked about my husband before, but I think he is a wonderful <br/>
example in this situation, so I&#39;m going to bring him up again :)  He <br/>
left high school at 14.  Wow!  Good for him.  He left so that he <br/>
could....play around on the computer!  There were other reasons, of <br/>
course, but he did play around on computers a lot.  He started by <br/>
playing games.  Then taking computers apart.  Then starting to write <br/>
basic code.<br/>
<br/>
He left this interest for awhile.  <br/>
<br/>
Joined a band.<br/>
<br/>
Followed The Dead.<br/>
<br/>
Got me pregnant:)<br/>
<br/>
Went to college...In computer science.<br/>
<br/>
Now he has a lucrative career managing an engineering team and <br/>
writing software for lawyers.  He wants to start his own consulting <br/>
company.  He will, if he wants to, I have no doubt!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked him before what his advice is for people who say their <br/>
kids have no interest in anything other than gaming.  He said, &quot;Do <br/>
anything you can to get your kids addicted to the computer, <br/>
seriously.&quot;  He was only kind of kidding.  <br/>
<br/>
When he went to college, he had to start at the *very* beginning in <br/>
math, but he ended up going far in math...one class short of a <br/>
minor.  He did incredibly well!  He did well because he wanted to <br/>
get his CS degree.  He did well because he was *ready* to learn. <br/>
Learning math was finally applicable in his real life.<br/>
<br/>
Computer interest can lead to so many things: a good career, new <br/>
acquaintances, new parts of the world (he&#39;s traveled all over as a <br/>
consultant), lots of math, and law and sports and....  the list goes <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Glenn was lucky he had a Mom that helped him acquire computers when <br/>
not every family had them, he was lucky he could leave school to <br/>
pursue his interests, and we&#39;re all lucky he has a job he loves now!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have one kid who has a great love of math and says she might want  <br/>
to be an engineer of some kind - and, yes, she is doing math for fun.  <br/>
Right now, as I type this, she is doing an online math program.  <br/>
Someone told us about it, she tried it for the three hour trial  <br/>
period and then asked me to subscribe to it. She&#39;s had it a week and  <br/>
has used it for about 9 or 10 hours this week. This is a kid who used  <br/>
to stay up at night doing math puzzles - she&#39;d be so sleepy, but kept  <br/>
wanting to just do a little more.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter did math in college - never really did any as an  <br/>
unschooler - but she just started from the lowest math class in  <br/>
college and moved on up, doing fine at each level. She didn&#39;t take  <br/>
very advanced math - but loved statistics and has taken some research  <br/>
methods courses.<br/>
<br/>
My middle daughter wants to go to a selective college and so she&#39;s  <br/>
decided she needs to study some math in order to do well on the SAT.  <br/>
Also the school has some minimum requirements in math. So she&#39;s doing  <br/>
the same online math program.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Foreign Language?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Roxana LOVES to learn foreign languages - she subscribed to a daily  <br/>
email program for a year and learned a lot of Norwegian that way.  <br/>
She&#39;s learned a lot of foreign language - various languages - by  <br/>
learning musical theater pieces in other languages. She sometimes  <br/>
watches French movies, in French, or in English with French  <br/>
subtitles. She has dabbled like this for years - picked up a lot. A  <br/>
few weeks ago she bought a Harry Potter book - in Latin - just for  <br/>
the fun of working some of it out.  In college, she took a French  <br/>
class and did really well and loved it.<br/>
<br/>
My point in telling these things is that, yes, there are kids who  <br/>
will pursue these &quot;subjects&quot; for fun. But not all kids will do this -  <br/>
my other kids have no interest in foreign language, for example. Rox  <br/>
isn&#39;t really very interested in algebra or geometry (in a formal  <br/>
sense) but has chosen to study them because she has a greater goal  <br/>
that requires it. She&#39;s 18.<br/>

<br/>
A friend of ours, the dad of the family Holly stayed with in England,  <br/>
finished high school but didn&#39;t go to college.  He could already at  <br/>
that point create a Macintosh computer from scattered Mac parts, and  <br/>
do any hardware or software thing anyone could request.  His dad was  <br/>
an Apple technician from the early days of Mac, and the son&#39;s life  <br/>
was filled with opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
This is Leon McNeill, of whom I&#39;m speaking.  Anyone with a Mac  <br/>
interest might have heard of him, but you could look him up.  No  <br/>
computer science degree, no math degree, no engineering.  Just  <br/>

&gt; I have one kid who has a great love of math and says she might want<br/>
&gt; to be an engineer of some kind - and, yes, she is doing math for fun.<br/>
&gt; Right now, as I type this, she is doing an online math program.<br/>
&gt; Someone told us about it, she tried it for the three hour trial<br/>
&gt; period and then asked me to subscribe to it. She&#39;s had it a week and<br/>
&gt; has used it for about 9 or 10 hours this week. This is a kid who used<br/>
&gt; to stay up at night doing math puzzles - she&#39;d be so sleepy, but kept<br/>
&gt; wanting to just do a little more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My oldest daughter did math in college - never really did any as an<br/>
&gt; unschooler - but she just started from the lowest math class in<br/>
&gt; college and moved on up, doing fine at each level. She didn&#39;t take<br/>
&gt; very advanced math - but loved statistics and has taken some research<br/>
&gt; methods courses.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My middle daughter wants to go to a selective college and so she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; decided she needs to study some math in order to do well on the SAT.<br/>
&gt; Also the school has some minimum requirements in math. So she&#39;s doing<br/>
&gt; the same online math program.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Foreign Language?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Roxana LOVES to learn foreign languages - she subscribed to a daily<br/>
&gt; email program for a year and learned a lot of Norwegian that way.<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s learned a lot of foreign language - various languages - by<br/>
&gt; learning musical theater pieces in other languages. She sometimes<br/>
&gt; watches French movies, in French, or in English with French<br/>
&gt; subtitles. She has dabbled like this for years - picked up a lot. A<br/>
&gt; few weeks ago she bought a Harry Potter book - in Latin - just for<br/>
&gt; the fun of working some of it out.  In college, she took a French<br/>
&gt; class and did really well and loved it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My point in telling these things is that, yes, there are kids who<br/>
&gt; will pursue these &quot;subjects&quot; for fun. But not all kids will do this -<br/>
&gt; my other kids have no interest in foreign language, for example. Rox<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t really very interested in algebra or geometry (in a formal<br/>
&gt; sense) but has chosen to study them because she has a greater goal<br/>
&gt; that requires it. She&#39;s 18.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875827079">***My kids aren&#39;t the type to <br/>
really pursue an interest (other than video games) on their own.***<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Don&#39;t let them do it on their own, join in.  Talk with them about their video games, try and see why they like it so much.  There is so much in those games, its not a wonder that they are so intriguing.  Keeps your mind working all the time and us humans do like that. ;)  You might even enjoy playing too!  I do.  :D<br/>
   <br/>
  <br/>
****I <br/>
think there are some things learned through gaming, but there has <br/>
got to be more than that.****<br/>
   <br/>
  My kids do ALOT of gaming,  from online multi playing games, computer games, game console games, hand helds to board games and card games.<br/>
   <br/>
  The thing is, is that gaming is so much, it has so much in it and it can lead to so much more too.<br/>
   <br/>
  I could list all the things that my kids have learned from those games, but sometimes I think people also miss the point when I do that.  The point of understanding unschooling.  You have to see that a person will learn what that person needs to learn.  And as a parent to an unschooler we have to be ok with what our children want to do.  Once you can be ok with that a whole new world will open for you.<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  Back to my first comment, &quot;don&#39;t let them do it on their own&quot;  this is where the gaming can just go and go and go.  :D<br/>
   <br/>
  Help them to see more about what they like in the game.  One example of my son going on a tangent with gaming is his playing Final Fantasy XI.  Final Fantasy XI is a MMORP (massively multiplayer online role playing) game.  He played that game for months, and tons of challenges and fun in it. One of his tangents was learning about Samurais.  He had to level a character to a high level and then he could unlock Samurai.  He loved it.  I thought maybe he&#39;d like to learn more about samurais so we borrowed The Last Samurai,  he loved it.  Watched it 2 or 3 times, watched all the extras. <br/>
   <br/>
   We then got the mini series Shogun.  I thought he might like it.  He wasn&#39;t sure at first because he didn&#39;t like the way it looked.  It looked &quot;old&quot; to him.  It is dated, but we gave it a try.  After the first segment he was hooked as was I, trying to remember it from my childhood &lt;g&gt;.  We got them all from Netflix.  It was great.<br/>
   <br/>
  He also was online quite a bit looking up things about them--he especially likes armor and weaponry.<br/>
   <br/>
  Now, zoom ahead to this past Christmas, 6 months later, and we&#39;re having a dinner with my in-laws and a neighbor(who is an English professor)  We&#39;re all talking and find out that our neighbor spent a few years in Japan researching their history.  Cool,,, my son starts asking him about samurai, we start talking about the movie and tv show.   <br/>
   <br/>
  My neighbor can&#39;t believe how much he knows about Japan and these ancient warriors.   <br/>
   <br/>
  All from gaming,,,, well and all that it leads to...<br/>
   <br/>
  My kids are living such a happy life and the learning is sooo happening.  The math happens, the reading happens,  it really DOES happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649442119">***What exactly do your kids do? Any kids learning Algebra simply <br/>
because they want to? Foreign Language?****<br/>
   <br/>
  I also wanted to quick comment on this.  This will be shorter, promise! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
   <br/>
  As far as Algebra,,,why do people worry about Algebra?  I&#39;ve never used my algebra since leaving school.  I guess i&#39;ve figured out things I need when I need them,, kind of algebra, figuring out X.  But my kids do that all the time and they&#39;ve never been taught it.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about that.<br/>
   <br/>
  But as for foreign language, my daughter loves languages. She&#39;s wanted to learn different ones for years and she&#39;s only 11.  We&#39;ve drawn Chinese characters, Japanese, read Spanish, French, Norwegian, and elvish.  :D    Now, we aren&#39;t fluent in any of those,, yet.  But I know if she wants to, it will happen.<br/>
   <br/>
  Her language interests also get nurtured within gaming, ah huh!   In our new game we&#39;re playing, WOW, (world of warcraft) there are different races with different languages. :D  So, she now is trying to decypher those different languages that she can&#39;t speak.  We are currently trying to find an ad-on so we can communicate with the different races and just last night she went through our alphabet to me (on another computer) in a different language to see how the whole thing corresponded with English. &lt;g&gt;   I never thought of doing that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s not lose sight of unschooling, please, in this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Formal study of a course of mathematical concept and notation  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be (by unschoolers) equated with &quot;doing math.&quot;   It will  <br/>
screw up our unschooling thinking if we use school terminology  <br/>
without disclaimers or qualifiers.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was doing math (real math) yesterday when they decided who owed  <br/>
what and what the tip should be at IHOP.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was doing math when he decided which paycheck would be best to  <br/>
pay for his ticket to California (he&#39;s paying his own way to a  <br/>
homeschooling day at Legoland, and going out without the family).<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was doing math yesterday when he used PayPal to buy some gold/ <br/>
points for an online game he&#39;s playing (which Marty says is &quot;just  <br/>
wrong&quot; and &quot;cheating,&quot; but Kirby says is &quot;discouraged&quot;).  He was  <br/>
doing some pretty real math when he was trying to explain to me what  <br/>
all that would be like in terms of Neopoints, and considering how  <br/>
many minutes of game play it takes to get how many points (in his  <br/>
game and mine) and what that time and effort is worth in dollars, in  <br/>
the reasoning through which he was working.<br/>

facilitate how SHE wants to get there.<br/>
<br/>

have to learn it before they are 17 (or 18 or 62...)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was concerned that if they change <br/>

&gt;to <br/>

&gt; math, so I can&#39;t learn programming&quot;, rather than the goal being <br/>
&gt; enough for him to buckle down and learn it on his own. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>FYI as one who has worked in high tech software companies since <br/>
1990, it does NOT take advanced mathematics to understand <br/>
programming. It takes orderly thinking (this first, then this) and <br/>
creativity (both of which abound in video game players). It&#39;s like <br/>
creating a recipe almost. My DH learned to design websites (HTML <br/>
programming) with just barely a high school diploma (that is, he got <br/>
by enough to keep the school off his back but didn&#39;t really learn <br/>
anything there - he learned by programming on an old TRS-80 era type <br/>
computer). Again, your job is to facilitate. So, go out to Borders <br/>
or B&N and find some Intro to programming books. Visual Basic is <br/>
pretty simple (and is one of the Intro classes one would take in <br/>
high school or college anyhow). Java programming can get you a job <br/>
without a college degree. Get a Lego Mindstorms set to play with. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are your kids motivated enough to teach themselves what they need <br/>
&gt;to <br/>
&gt; know to acheive their goals?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Were your kids motivated enough to handle repeated falls to finally <br/>
walk across the living room? Were your kids motivated enough to <br/>
repeat &#39;mik, mik, mik&#39; enough times until you &#39;got it&#39; and gave them <br/>
milk...and maybe said &#39;Here&#39;s your milk&#39; and next time it got a <br/>
little closer to &#39;milk&#39; than &#39;mik&#39; because it got them to their goal <br/>
sooner.<br/>
<br/>
What it really sounds like is that -you- are worried because you see <br/>
learning as something that ends at age 17 or 18 and then life <br/>
happens and you have to have everything you need packed in before 18 <br/>
or you&#39;ll never be able to do anything. Try telling that to my DH <br/>
who went to college at 27 because he hated school so much he vowed <br/>
never to set foot in a classroom again when he graduated high <br/>
school. Then he found something HE wanted to do, applied, and took <br/>
all the CLEP exams (college level exam for placement - they have <br/>
them in math, science, arts, history, etc - pretty much all areas) <br/>
and tested out of 1 1/2 semesters of intro coursework - he said the <br/>
tests were like playing Jeopardy! Very little was related to stuff <br/>
he learned in school, except insofar as there was reading and basic <br/>
math involved (and you already said your kids have that covered <br/>
anyhow).<br/>

<br/>
But I&#39;m not particularly recommending it and certainly don&#39;t think  <br/>
parents should try to make their kids do it. It just HAPPENS to  <br/>
appeal to my 15 year old who has always liked math workbooks and math  <br/>
games/puzzles. Neither of my other two did formal math like this as  <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t good for learning what I consider real math - math  <br/>
reasoning, math concepts, logic, etc. It is dry computational stuff  <br/>
only. How to multiply fractions with absolutely NO motivation for why  <br/>
anyone would want to multiply fractions or what the answer really  <br/>
means when you get it.<br/>
<br/>
Good for my daughter who, at 15, has been fascinated with real-life  <br/>
math, played games involving math, and been interested in and talked  <br/>
about math concepts all her life. She&#39;s filling in stuff she never  <br/>
happened to learn how to do and she&#39;s liking that a lot.<br/>
<br/>
For my older daughter, 18, who wants to do  formal algebra and  <br/>
geometry programs, this seems good because she can do it and IM with  <br/>
friends at the same time. She&#39;s all about multi-tasking! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

It does kind of miss the point, but on the other hand it IS the point!<br/>

That was great, Kelli.  I have enshrined it, and when I went to find  <br/>
a place to put it, I found there was already some good similar stuff!<br/>

&gt; Let&#39;s not lose sight of unschooling, please, in this discussion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Formal study of a course of mathematical concept and notation<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t be (by unschoolers) equated with &quot;doing math.&quot;   It will<br/>
&gt; screw up our unschooling thinking if we use school terminology<br/>
&gt; without disclaimers or qualifiers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly. In fact, I don&#39;t think of what Rosie is doing online with  <br/>
this math course as &quot;doing math.&quot; It is less than that - it is fun  <br/>
for her, so that&#39;s fine, but if someone (not an unschooler) was  <br/>
looking for a math curriculum this would NOT be my recommendation. Or  <br/>
at least it would be the lowest, poorest part of a math program.  <br/>
Unschoolers get the best and richest math &quot;program&quot; by living their  <br/>
lives and letting the math bubble up just like everything else  <br/>
bubbles up.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t NEED this - they&#39;ll learn what they need to learn. Neither  <br/>
of my other kids needed or wanted anything like this and they&#39;re FINE.<br/>
<br/>
If people are thinking they don&#39;t have enough math in their  <br/>
unschooling lives - the first thing I&#39;d suggest is that you probably  <br/>
do and just don&#39;t recognize it and, second, if you want to &quot;strew&quot;  <br/>
more stuff that encourages mathematical thinking and learning,  <br/>
perhaps look at Julie Brennan&#39;s website, &lt;LivingMath.net&gt; for ideas  <br/>
that are going to be far better than a mechanical, formal math program.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY reason I brought it up was because someone asked and, yes, I  <br/>
have a daughter who, at 15, is as interested in doing formal math as  <br/>
she is in going to Disneyland or learning to play guitar or playing  <br/>
soccer. It isn&#39;t any more special to her than those other things,  <br/>
which are ALL important to her.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who love music will gravitate toward music and, at some point,  <br/>
might very likely want a more formal way to study - lessons,  <br/>
teachers, books, plans, whatever. Roxana &quot;just sang&quot; until she got  <br/>
really serious about musical theater and then she wanted to study  <br/>
with people who could really help her progress. Rosie could stand in  <br/>
the living room and copy karate moves while watching Bruce Lee  <br/>
movies, but she wanted systematic instruction by people who knew how  <br/>
to help her. She&#39;s played guitar for a long time, but just decided to  <br/>
take some lessons recently.<br/>
<br/>
Kids should pursue what they are interested in pursuing and sometimes  <br/>
that includes formal methods - but I always hate to talk about a kid  <br/>
who loves things that sound like formal schooling because people jump  <br/>
all over it, thinking THAT is good for their kid, too.<br/>
<br/>
I do not consider this math program to be any more important (in  <br/>
fact, it is LESS important if I&#39;m honest) than Rosie getting on the  <br/>
phone and putting together a group of kids to go together to  <br/>
Disneyland today - calling people, making arrangements, talking to  <br/>
their parents and leaving messages and getting back to people with  <br/>
new information and all that. THAT is a real-life important skill.  <br/>
AND it involves important mathematical thinking, too.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I also wanted to quick comment on this.  This will be shorter,  <br/>
&gt; promise! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   As far as Algebra,,,why do people worry about Algebra?  I&#39;ve  <br/>
&gt; never used my algebra since leaving school.  I guess i&#39;ve figured  <br/>
&gt; out things I need when I need them,, kind of algebra, figuring out  <br/>
&gt; X.  But my kids do that all the time and they&#39;ve never been taught  <br/>
&gt; it.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   But as for foreign language, my daughter loves languages. She&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; wanted to learn different ones for years and she&#39;s only 11.  We&#39;ve  <br/>
&gt; drawn Chinese characters, Japanese, read Spanish, French,  <br/>
&gt; Norwegian, and elvish.  :D    Now, we aren&#39;t fluent in any of  <br/>
&gt; those,, yet.  But I know if she wants to, it will happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Her language interests also get nurtured within gaming, ah huh!    <br/>
&gt; In our new game we&#39;re playing, WOW, (world of warcraft) there are  <br/>
&gt; different races with different languages. :D  So, she now is trying  <br/>
&gt; to decypher those different languages that she can&#39;t speak.  We are  <br/>
&gt; currently trying to find an ad-on so we can communicate with the  <br/>
&gt; different races and just last night she went through our alphabet  <br/>
&gt; to me (on another computer) in a different language to see how the  <br/>
&gt; whole thing corresponded with English. &lt;g&gt;   I never thought of  <br/>
&gt; doing that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=============================<br/>
<br/>
I thought that said VEGETARIAN, even when I was halfway through the  <br/>
response.<br/>
<br/>
I was a vegetarian for a couple of years, and though I did do a lot  <br/>
of reading, I didn&#39;t have to study FIRST before I quit eating  <br/>
burgers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-FYI as one who has worked in high tech software companies since<br/>
1990, it does NOT take advanced mathematics to understand<br/>
programming. It takes orderly thinking (this first, then this) and<br/>
creativity (both of which abound in video game players). It&#39;s like<br/>
creating a recipe almost. My DH learned to design websites (HTML<br/>
programming) with just barely a high school diploma (that is, he got<br/>
by enough to keep the school off his back but didn&#39;t really learn<br/>
anything there - he learned by programming on an old TRS-80 era type<br/>
computer). -=-<br/>
<br/>
I took an easy programming class years ago, and it didn&#39;t seem like  <br/>
math to me. It seemed like rules to a game.  Thinks I learned then  <br/>
helped me just this morning! &lt;g&gt;   But I could have learned those  <br/>
things without the class, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very math-nervous, and my first response is to avoid it, but  <br/>
luckily for me computer coding doesn&#39;t seem so mathish, because (I  <br/>
think) it&#39;s not done with numbers and &quot;formulae.&quot;  Yes, there are  <br/>
patterns, and you really have to be careful about characters, but  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; Are your kids motivated enough to teach themselves what they  <br/>
need to<br/>
  know to acheive their goals?-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-Were your kids motivated enough to handle repeated falls to finally<br/>
walk across the living room? Were your kids motivated enough to<br/>
repeat &#39;mik, mik, mik&#39; enough times until you &#39;got it&#39; and gave them<br/>
milk...and maybe said &#39;Here&#39;s your milk&#39; and next time it got a<br/>
little closer to &#39;milk&#39; than &#39;mik&#39; because it got them to their goal<br/>
sooner.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The real question in cases such as this are:<br/>
Is the mother motivated enough to *learn* what she needs to know to  <br/>
make unschooling work well for her family?<br/>
<br/>
Our company has helped hundreds or thousands of moms Just Like YOU  <br/>
unschool successfully.  (Oh... I mean this list can be really  <br/>
helpful. &lt;g&gt;)    Here are some good starting places:<br/>

I had to laugh as I re-read this. Trevor has an interest in German,<br/>
because of an online game he plays.<br/>
They both have an interest in Japanese because of their passion for<br/>
manga and anime. They&#39;re content with it being an interest, I&#39;ve<br/>
offered up a language program if they&#39;d like. I really don&#39;t think<br/>

requirements for doing what SHE wants to do - you can help her figure  <br/>
out how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
There is a fine line between taking a kids&#39; interests seriously  <br/>
versus locking them into any interest they&#39;ve expressed and goading  <br/>
them into doing things based on having expressed those interests.<br/>

at the library that are specifically about how to draw anime.<br/>

Does anyone else have suggestions for resources to use for this.  <br/>
Currently she is downloading and printing out pictures, then she <br/>
uses tracing paper to trace them.  I thought that was a great way to <br/>
start.<br/>

Anyhow, it is all about anime here at our house, especially <br/>
Inuyasha, and anything Miyazaki.<br/>

Hedgehog, she&#39;s looked through a lot of Japanese stuff too.  A few  <br/>
years back, last time I talked to her, she was doing the original in  <br/>
ink and then scanning and using a computer paint program to color  <br/>
sometimes, or doing the character in color on paper and then setting  <br/>
it in a computer-generated background.  There&#39;s an example on one of  <br/>
my pages and might still link to her stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We got some postcards with art she did for Christmas, and a magnet.    <br/>
I guess they&#39;re from a online place that puts your artwork on things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I checked out your link and it just reminded me that my dd has also <br/>
been wanting to write out a walk through for a game that she&#39;s been <br/>
playing.  <br/>
<br/>
Are there any rules for walk throughs?  I thought this would be a <br/>
great idea for her to do, since we had a hard time finding walk <br/>
throughs for this particular game, and the ones we found were <br/>
incomplete and lacking the specific info that she was looking for.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there have experience helping their child write up a walk <br/>
through?</div>

&lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think there are principles. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Admit when you&#39;re not sure, tell why you know or think something if  <br/>
it seems important (cite player&#39;s guide maybe, I mean).<br/>
<br/>
Be clear, don&#39;t just say &quot;get that coin&quot; if there&#39;s more than one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyone out there have experience helping their child write up a walk<br/>

<br/>
I have experience helping them read them, years back, and much  <br/>
experience hearing them be thrilled when the walkthrough was great or  <br/>
cranky if it got them lost or stuck.<br/>
<br/>
For those wondering what the heck a &quot;walkthrough&quot; is, it&#39;s a textual  <br/>
guide to playing a video game, or at least a part of a game—a  <br/>
narrative that another gamer can follow.<br/>
