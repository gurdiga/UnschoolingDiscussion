<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959920128">Sorry to the list in general.<br/>
If people in Maryland can help this mom, please write directly to the address <br/>
at the bottom.<br/>
Don&#39;t respond on the list.   Thanks.<br/>

====================<br/>
<br/>
Hi All,<br/>
I&#39;m a homeschool mom who needs direction.<br/>
My son is 13, and we have used the unschooling<br/>
method, yet the umbrella we are under has had<br/>
a split or something going on, we are now in<br/>
the cross fire somewhat.<br/>
Their policy used to be supportive of unschooling.<br/>
The umbrella is now wanting receipts of our trips, documentation<br/>
for all kinds of junk they never demanded before.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is all legal, but I don&#39;t have<br/>
the time to check out the legal end, nor do I have the<br/>
energy.<br/>
I&#39;m looking for non-public umbrella that supports<br/>
unschooling. We live in Maryland.<br/>
All advice welcomed, need someone to point me in<br/>
the right direction.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Michele<br/>
<br/>
