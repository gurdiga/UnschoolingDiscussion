<div id="ygrps-yiv-557270233">&lt;&lt;But sometimes you really do have to put on your shoes and get in the car<br/>
and schlep around with Mom.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Of course you do.  But those instances are less often than we tend to think.<br/>
I have 5 kids (3 too little to be left alone at all) and a husband who<br/>
travels quite a bit.  Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet.  When that<br/>
happens I try to make it as easy on the kids as possible.  Bring whatever<br/>
they are playing with along for the ride.  Stop by the library on the way<br/>
back.  Turn the radio way up and roll the windows down.  Make sure we go on<br/>
the really hilly road with all the curves.  Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
But mainly, I try to point out that I know the kids are inconvenienced, I<br/>
know it it a pain for them and I appreciate their sacrifice.  I also try to<br/>
make sure that when I suddenly have to schlep around with one of them (coach<br/>
didn&#39;t say what color baseball pants were needed until day before the 1st<br/>
game) I am not a crab about it.<br/>
