<div id="ygrps-yiv-174227293">I ran across this site in reader digest, although I haven&#39;t had time to find <br/>
the exact<br/>
site of where we live you or your child might be able to. <br/>
Its  satellite image (actual pic from the sky of where you live)<br/>
<br/>
terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com<br/>
<br/>
Enter your city and stae and then keep zooming in for your astronauts eye <br/>
view,<br/>
a pilots view, and a birds view, the closer you zoom.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, let me know if this works.<br/>
