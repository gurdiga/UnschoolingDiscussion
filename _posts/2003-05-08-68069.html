<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735218285">My son made a few friends last week. One being a boy next door who moved <br/>
there a couple months ago.<br/>
I really wanted to support him in this relationship and not speak my concerns <br/>
but today it has come to a discussion. The family is a little rough around <br/>
the edges and yells constantly at their kids and dogs.  <br/>
The boy has been suspended from school for fighting. Basically they live in a <br/>
very small pull behind camper in someone&#39;s yard and have seen and are seeing <br/>
rough times.<br/>
Normally I would have followed my instinct but I did not because I was hoping <br/>
he would make the choice. <br/>
 My son lately has been concerned about how many friends he has. But this one <br/>
I am worried about.<br/>
Ok, the issue, today while playing the boy&#39;s family dog bit my son in the <br/>
leg. The dog is a pit bull or a chow or even a mix of the two. Dustin isn&#39;t <br/>
sure, he just says the dog was running after him viciously. They say the dog <br/>
has had its shots, I will be calling the town in the Am to find out. I know <br/>
this dog is not registered here though.<br/>
Either way we will be getting Dustin antibiotics in the am per the Hospital. <br/>
<br/>
Tonight at dinner he is telling us the family is pouring oil in the small <br/>
stream to kill the misquotes, then he said he wasn&#39;t sure. This was after my <br/>
husband reacted cuz we have well water.  Erin Brocavich (sp) ring a <br/>
bell!!!!!!!! <br/>
<br/>
Any of you ever deal with the friend issues and what did you do? Do I speak <br/>
or zip it?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think Jennifer&#39;s email speaks volumes.  Learn to trust your own inner <br/>
&gt; judgment.  If something about the child and the family &quot;bother&quot; you, even <br/>
&gt; if <br/>
&gt; you can&#39;t exactly nail what it is, your innate judgment is trying to <br/>
&gt; protect <br/>
&gt; you and your family.  Trust it!  Keep your distance from the entity that <br/>
&gt; gives you bad vibes.  While you don&#39;t want to be mean to the neighbor <br/>
&gt; child, <br/>
&gt; you want to protect and nurture YOUR CHILD, first and foremost.  Always <br/>
&gt; keep <br/>
&gt; the focus on that.  .  .  .<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you.<br/>
I think normally I would have and sometimes in the past I have totally <br/>
freaked out over stuff. I wanted to stay on the Unschooling side of not <br/>
demanding that he not play with him but hoping that he choose this on his <br/>
own.<br/>
He did today, he said that he may play with the boy on occasion but is not <br/>
very interested in being buddy buddy. He also said before I could speak, I <br/>
know Mom, I know I will stay away from the dog and their house. Good!<br/>
I did not report the dog bite to the police, I still may I dont know? I would <br/>
however like to know if the dog has current shots, if it does not I will be <br/>
reporting it. I do worry though that the family..... once they see where they <br/>
live will end up in a bigger mess though I dont think much could be worse <br/>
than where and what they live in now.  But then again who am I to say they <br/>
are not happy....<br/>
Dustin is on antibiotics and doc says he will be fine.<br/>

This would be my biggest concern, dogs can inflict a lot of damage on a<br/>
child, even fatal.<br/>

<br/>
Get some clarification, we have used SALAD oil to kill mosquitoes before.<br/>
If they&#39;re using motor oil that is probably illegal and you could report it<br/>
to the proper authority.<br/>

Two years ago I would have been in their face demanding the immediate site of <br/>
the papers. Now im just to chicken *^^$* to go over there, more kids more <br/>
worry who knows.... Hubby says just report to police they can swap tags there <br/>
are several dogs over there. I was told tonight that the dog has bitten <br/>
before.<br/>
So tomorrow I am off to report it.<br/>

It is motor oil, my husband is a mechanic, Dustin knows what it looks like.<br/>
<br/>
This whole situation has caused way to many negative discussions and ill <br/>
feelings in our home.  My husband had Dustin crying after he said we where <br/>
going to call the police. Three steps forward ten steps back.......<br/>
I do hope next week is better for all of us.<br/>
