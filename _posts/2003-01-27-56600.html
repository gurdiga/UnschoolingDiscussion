&gt; not make sense.  But if you can understand that it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; pigs in a blanket or prime rib, it&#39;s the EVENT that dinner is more than the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; type or amount of food.  This becomes more important as children find their <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; way in the world and have jobs and other things going on.  I think <br/>
&gt; sometimes <br/>
&gt; if our children are home with us every day all day, we might sometimes take <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; that time a little for granted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know that I did before but try to make an effort not to anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I probably didn&#39;t help anyone understand it better but it isn&#39;t about <br/>
&gt; actual <br/>
&gt; food at all.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wonderfully said, Glena.   I agree.   And I was thinking when folks kept <br/>
listing all the things they do with thier children, all the times they are <br/>
together so they dont &quot;need&quot; family meal together time...  Its not about the <br/>
quantity of time you spend with each child.  For us, its more about ALL of us <br/>
being together as a family.   Its that time of day ( and NO, its not every <br/>
day)  that we are all in one place at the same time.  It feels very close and <br/>
intimate.   And, your right, whether its bologna sandwiches or rack of lamb,  <br/>
the comfort comes from being together, not so much the food.   Its checking <br/>
in with each other.. Sharing the days events, accomplisments, concerns.  <br/>
Learning from each other about how we each deal with and handle things.  Its <br/>
getting and giving advice and support for each other.    Its basically an <br/>
affirmation that we are a family and we are here for each other. <br/>
<br/>
 Another thing that struck me while reading some of the responses to familes <br/>
eating together..  For me, preparing a meal for my family is an act of love.  <br/>
Its a sacrifice of my time and effort that I gladly give.   They appreciate <br/>
it.   I dont HAVE to cook a sit down meal.. and  for most of our eating, I <br/>
dont. But when I do, it shows that I want to take the extra time and effort <br/>
to create an opportunity for us all to be together.  I usually get several <br/>
&quot;thank yous, that was good&quot;.. etc.<br/>
<br/>
  Its NEVER been mandatory to come eat with the rest of the family.   I dont <br/>
require them to come and eat.. I only inform them that the meal is ready.  <br/>
Lots of times they have helped prepare it and set the table ( of thier own <br/>
accord).   Occasionally someone will be engrossed in a TV show or a game or a <br/>
phone conversation.  It&#39;s that persons choice to continue thier activity or <br/>
come eat with the family.  95% of the time, they opt to come join us.  The <br/>
times they don&#39;t, they may join us later in the meal or miss it all together. <br/>
  I can tell the disappointment that they missed the meal.  Yeah, they can <br/>
eat leftovers ,but its not the same.   The sound of laughter and discussion <br/>
is usually  luring enough for them to leave thier activity and come join the <br/>
family.   I would never contend that that eating meals together as a family <br/>
is the &quot;right way&quot; or &quot;better way&quot;  But, it has  value for our family and <br/>
that is what is important to me .  <br/>
