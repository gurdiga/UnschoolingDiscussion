<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023396150">Our support group here in NC, is having an international fair later this<br/>
year.  In keeping with this theme, we are looking for Pen Pals in other<br/>
countries.  Right now we are still in the planning stages (or should I<br/>
say, I am)  Is there anyone in another country that might be interested<br/>
in this idea?  Maybe even more than just a pen pal.  Last year my kids<br/>
and I participated in the &quot;flat farm&quot; project.  A girl in California<br/>
send a paper doll of herself and sent it to us.  We created a journal of<br/>
her time here, and we sent it back several months later.  We took<br/>
pictures and wrote things et....  We also made paper dolls of our kids,<br/>
and sent them to her.  It was quite interesting.  We really thought it<br/>
was fun to get our journal back.  During the time we were working on our<br/>
journals, we send postcard to her ect..  I&#39;m thinking this would be a<br/>
nice way to correspond during a several month period, and then we will<br/>
share these at our international fair.<br/>
So........  anyone out there interested?<br/>

but we belong to a support group and am sure that there would be some kids, if<br/>
not mine, who would be keen to participate.<br/>

<br/>
Now that I know we live near each other, I&#39;m interested in knowing about<br/>
the support group you mentioned in your mail.  Is it an online one or<br/>
other?  Thanks! And my aunt is a native Costa Rican and could probably<br/>
get me an address or two for pen pals if you&#39;d like.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760897759">Ok, I&#39;ve heard from two people.  I&#39;m going to get a number from my group<br/>
how many people want to do this.  Then, I&#39;ll let you know further.  I&#39;m<br/>
quite excited about this.  I Think it will be really fun, and a nice way<br/>
to exchange cultures.<br/>
If there are others out there outside the US, and want to participate,<br/>
just let me know anytime.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking we may have 24 kids...that would be about 10 families.  But<br/>
I&#39;ll have to wait and see what response I get from my group.<br/>
I think exchanging families would probably the best way to go about<br/>
this, rather than sending individual kids to individual places.  That<br/>
way we can each do one journal instead of having to do one for each<br/>
child.  I&#39;d never get that accomplished!  :)<br/>
But maybe some with older kids would like to do their own.  Just let me<br/>
know what you think.  I&#39;m making this up as I go along.  (Hee..Hee)<br/>
Ann<br/>
Oh yeah...maybe those that want to do this could send me an email with<br/>
their kids ages. Then I&#39;ll save them to a folder to help match up.</div>
