negative IS mentality, when there is no &quot;schooling&quot; in it.  I was just<br/>
bewildered by the comments about &quot;a day in the life of&quot; and school issues<br/>
confusing unschooled chilren when you were talking about Little Bear.  <br/>
<br/>
I do agree about Franklin, though.  The one mom at the playgroup that I<br/>
quit who I thought might be a good friend has made some comments that<br/>
raised my eyebrows on various occassions about sending her preschooler to<br/>
private school, about movies they watch or the plethora of toys that they<br/>
own/buy, etc.  But one I remember in particular is her praise for Franklin.<br/>
 I can&#39;t stand Franklin for my unschooling children, as almost every<br/>
episode includes a mention of or a focus on school.  Barney is another with<br/>
a focus on schooling, as the whole set consists of the school and the<br/>
schoolyard, where all of the shows take place.<br/>

toddlers.  I like to keep things simple and wholesome and I think those<br/>
shows are geared more towards older children.  Plus I try to stay away from<br/>
potrayals of violence, and evil characters (like Dr. Claw on Inspector<br/>
Gadget.)</div>

Maybe they are too young -- of course, that&#39;s your judgement.  But -- it <br/>
seems to me that a lot of good stories need a bad guy to give the story a <br/>
plot.  Good almost always wins over evil in these stories but the idea that <br/>
someone might not be good is something the kids need to know (and figure out <br/>
anyway) at some point.  IMO, of course.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I certainly wouldn&#39;t advocate TV as a road to understanding reality.  <br/>
But, a good story needs (what&#39;s it called in literatue class?) tension.  The <br/>
youngest child may not need that but very soon, to make the story <br/>
interesting, I think, there has to be some kind of conflict or problem or <br/>
dilemma, imo.  If not, it&#39;s a documentary.  Which are nice too.<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have agree with Joel (as usual) on this issue.  There is plenty of time<br/>
to become acquainted with the various faces of evil in this world.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think preschoolers necessarily need to do this.  However, for what it&#39;s<br/>
worth, I find that their programming options are VERY entertaining for<br/>
them, and there is always a &quot;problem&quot; to be solved in the storyline without<br/>
the use of violence or evil characters.  Frankly I would rather they learn<br/>
to solve more realistic problems in ways which use their intellect and<br/>
talents than to think that everything is black and white, good and evil and<br/>
must be solved physically with violence and weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some examples:<br/>
<br/>
From Dragon Tales:  For those of you not familiar with the show, it centers<br/>
on two American children of Hispanic descent, Emmy and Max.  They have<br/>
found a magic dragon scale and use it to wish themselves into the land of<br/>
dragons on a regular basis where they play with their young dragon friends.<br/>
 On a recent episode they met a near sighted Unicorn who had lost her<br/>
glasses.  The rest of the show focused on the two kids and their dragon<br/>
pals helping &quot;Eunice&quot; to find her glasses using reasoning, problem solving<br/>
and retracing her path.  <br/>
<br/>
On another episode, Max was frustrated with being little and not being able<br/>
to do the things that he wanted to.  In the course of the story his angry<br/>
tantrum released a trouble making imp who thrived on Max&#39;s anger and grew<br/>
in size (and trouble) each time Max lost his temper.  Max had to learn to<br/>
reign in his temper and express his frustration in a more constructive way,<br/>
like using that energy and determination to figure out how to accomplish<br/>
his goals.  In this was the imp shrank and they were able to recapture him<br/>
in the seed pod from which he came.<br/>
<br/>
In another episode, the kids and dragons were building a tree house and<br/>
Emmy wanted everyone to do things her way, and was hurting everyone&#39;s<br/>
feelings by not listening to them.  She had to discover that to work<br/>
together, everyone has to have their voice heard and be able to have a hand<br/>
in the finished product.  She learned to back off and let the others<br/>
contribute to the project, even if they didn&#39;t do things exactly the way<br/>
she would have, because they each had their own special gifts and talents<br/>
to bring to the tree house construction that were just as special as hers.<br/>
<br/>
From Little Bear:  In one episode Little Bear meets a new friend, No Feet<br/>
the garden snake, and sets about discovering what kind of a bed No Feet<br/>
would like.  He tries all different places in his bedroom, but the drawer<br/>
is too dark, the shelf too high, the plant pot too small, and so on.<br/>
Finally they decide that his best bed is in the garden where Little Bear<br/>
found him.<br/>
<br/>
On another episode Little Bear sets off exploring in the forest, a<br/>
recurring theme, with some of his friends and has many adventures along the<br/>
way, and meets some new friends.<br/>
<br/>
In another Little Bear episode, he and his best friend Emily try to make<br/>
some cupcakes &quot;just like Mother Bear makes.&quot;  After including everything<br/>
but the kitchen sink in the cupcakes, they come out of the oven not quite<br/>
right.  With some help from Mother Bear, who tells the story of her first<br/>
cupcakes and how they were not quite right either, they discover they have<br/>
left out a key ingredient, the baking powder!<br/>
<br/>
You get the idea.  The stories are interesting, fun and entertaining,<br/>
without the use of villians as a story device.  I find that plot line<br/>
rather tired and boring anyway.  It&#39;s an overused device.  Anyway they do<br/>
watch and love a number of Disney films, which use the villian story device<br/>
almost exclusively.  I don&#39;t think that they need to see evil characters or<br/>
violent story lines in their every day entertainment.  Once in a while in<br/>
their Disney movies is more than enough for me.  I find that boys have a<br/>
natural tendancy towards more agressive behavior and if I want them to<br/>
learn to express themselves in other ways I want their regular<br/>
entertainment to be non-agressive in nature.  It seems to be working so<br/>
far, as I have two polite, affectionate little boys who do not regularly<br/>
&quot;play fight,&quot; choose weapons as playthings, or know what a G-U-N is.<br/>
