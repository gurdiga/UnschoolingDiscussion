<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287010508">----- snip----- The only rule I have had is that for every fictional<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; book that she checked out from the library she had to check out 3 non-<br/>
&gt; fiction and a biography.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was before you were an unschooler, right?  Because telling your kids<br/>
what to read isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My 10yod is just as likely to grab and read non-fiction as fiction.  She<br/>
loves both.  I have never required anything of her reading.  She has always<br/>
been free to pick and choose whatever she wants (or even choose not to).<br/>
Last week she asked me to help her find a book about California at the<br/>
library.  She loves reading tidbits about states and quoting them to us.  I<br/>
love watching her enjoy this and I love that there will NOT be a test.  What<br/>
she remembers from it will be the parts that matter to her.  (And now I<br/>
finally remember that Florida is the sunshine state and California is the<br/>
golden state, not the other way around.  Washington is the evergreen state,<br/>
but this is only true on the western side.)  And if she doesn&#39;t remember any<br/>
of the facts, she will no doubt remember that you can go to the library and<br/>
get books that tell you all sorts of interesting details about just about<br/>
anything you want to know!  And she knows that if you like a book, you can<br/>
look under the author&#39;s name and find more books by the same author.  And<br/>
she knows that some authors write both fiction and non-fiction.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and feel that I could use some advice and encouragement. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let the &quot;homeschooling&quot; go.  When you are deciding what they should learn<br/>
and when they should learn it, that is not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I am very good at grammar and spelling, but clueless when it comes to auto<br/>
mechanics.<br/>

<br/>
I LOVED non-fiction as a kid and still do.  When I finish a novel I often <br/>
feel like I wasted my time, because it was just a story.  (Personal problem, <br/>
and I do know lots of thought comes and ideas and truths and all that, but I <br/>
think because of the way I am interpersonally, I don&#39;t need fiction as much <br/>
as some people do.)  <br/>
<br/>
I have TONS of non-fiction books.  I just love them.  If someone had made me <br/>
read them, it could have turned them to spinach.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe they forced me to read novels! LOL!  I&#39;ll have to think about that.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Washington is the evergreen state,<br/>

<br/>
I grew up in New Mexico, and so I thought I knew what New Mexico looked like. <br/>
 <br/>
Wrong.<br/>
I was in the Rio Grande Valley between two beautiful mountain chains, in  Rio <br/>
Arriba county, which was indeed full of rivers and streams, and orchards and <br/>
farms.<br/>
<br/>
Every time we got textbooks, though, like geography books, or every time <br/>
there was something about New Mexico in one of the classroom magazines, they <br/>
would show Carlsbad Caverns or a yucca plant on a sand dune with miles of <br/>
flat nothing but sagebrush behind.  I never saw that part of New Mexico until <br/>
I was 26 or 27.  Weird, huh?  There is quite a bit of that part of New <br/>
Mexico, but people tend not to live there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d seen yucca and sage brush, but only in relatively lush civilization. Ha!  <br/>
<br/>
So like the Blind Men and the Elephant, if we tell kids what part is &quot;the <br/>
important part&quot; they can easily get the wrong idea about what an elephant is <br/>
like, but if we say &quot;Here is a world of elephant art, video, poetry, sound <br/>
recording, and there are some real elephants to touch and smell, go for it!&quot; <br/>
they&#39;ll know more about elephants than they could find in any single kid&#39;s <br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
I rambled.  I rambled right into a herd of elephants.<br/>
Life is like that when you unschool.<br/>

<br/>
I tend to *assume* that non-fiction is spinach and will be very<br/>
&quot;nourishing&quot; and have a strong unpleasant flavor.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult, I actually like spinach more than I like non-fiction.  That<br/>
&quot;school taste&quot; really lingers.<br/>
<br/>
It never occured to me to stop and think that this list is<br/>
&quot;non-fiction&quot;.  Without the label it doesn&#39;t taste bad!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-47153706">I have just about every Stephen King book and have read most of them lots of times, except Dreamcatcher, I read his wifes discription of the &#39;nastys&#39; in the book and was never able to get past the mental image and just couldn&#39;t get into the right frame of mind to read the book, I just kept giggling. Maybe I&#39;ll try it again.<br/>
I just started reading Patricia Cornwell&#39;s Jack The Ripper Book. I love forensic science. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
