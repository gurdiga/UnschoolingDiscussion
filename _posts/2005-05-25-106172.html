<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024576995">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kathy and we have a 6 year-old son that we accidentally <br/>
started homeschooling in August.  It&#39;s a long story that I will <br/>
babble later :)<br/>
<br/>
In the time we&#39;ve been doing (or not doing) this, it appears to me <br/>
that I am much more inclined to an unschooling approach.  I still <br/>
have many personal hurdles to jump to feel like I&#39;m REALLY in an <br/>
unschooling way but I&#39;m slowly finding people who are helpful.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest concern we have is that our little guy has some disorders <br/>
that make communication difficult and affect him physically as well.  <br/>
We initially had diagnoses of autism, PDD-NOS, speech disorders and <br/>
sensory integration dysfunction.  Ellis is my third kiddo and I knew <br/>
from the time he was about 2 months old that he was not &#39;usual&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
We pursued SI therapy which helped a great deal initially in terms of <br/>
his coordination and many sensitivities.  He spent two years in half-<br/>
time public school special ed which was a great experience and did <br/>
wonders for him because of an incredible teacher.  We were lulled <br/>
into thinking he would have this kind of treatment for the rest of <br/>
his school days.<br/>
<br/>
Boy were we wrong.  He was declared &#39;normal&#39; in April, 2004 and <br/>
graduated to &#39;regular&#39; kindergarten.  Our concerns were dismissed.  <br/>
We were patted on the head and told to leave him to the <br/>
professionals.  The principal said, &quot;We&#39;ve had LOTS of kids like <br/>
Ellis.  We know what we&#39;re doing.&quot;  In spite of this, he started <br/>
kindergarten in fall with a teacher I despised on sight.<br/>
<br/>
He was broken after six school days.  We withdrew him on the 7th <br/>
school day and the office staff person read my letter, then <br/>
said, &quot;Well is he coming today?  Because it takes us 24 hours to <br/>
process the paperwork and he&#39;ll get an unexcused absence.&quot;  I was <br/>
speechless (a rarity).  As if I CARED about an unexcused absence?<br/>
<br/>
So that is how we accidentally started homeschooling - with no <br/>
forethought, no planning, no clue.  The only real obsession I have is <br/>
that Ellis read, and read well.  To me, that is a key to almost <br/>
everything else he will want to explore on his own.  And we&#39;re book <br/>
junkies anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
The problems we encounter are that Ellis does not engage in &#39;normal&#39; <br/>
kid things.  He has the kindest heart in the world.  He has some <br/>
physical weaknesses and sensitivities that limit his interest in a <br/>
lot of things.  He has a crazy sense of humor and giggles <br/>
constantly.  But he retreats into his head and doesn&#39;t come out <br/>
except in the form of video games.  He is absolutely obsessed with <br/>
anything that has a screen and once he goes into that &#39;place&#39;, he&#39;s <br/>
gone.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m wondering if anyone has similar experiences and what might <br/>
help to give a kid like Ellis a chance to wonder.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>
<br/>
Kathy</div>

You can&#39;t *force* or *impose* reading (or anything else) and expect it to<br/>
become the joyous experience and beloved skill that you experience it as and<br/>
aspire to for him. Just keep reading yourself, have a print rich<br/>
environment, and read for/to him to help him follow his interests - Trust<br/>
that he will read in his own time. If he enjoys any of the teaching reading<br/>
computer games let him do them at his own pace and in his own way, with as<br/>
much repetition as he likes, ignoring the imposed timetables and teacher<br/>
guides that sometimes come with them. Again see Sandra&#39;s site for lots about<br/>

what he knew was a wrong answer simply because it would make silly <br/>
noises or whatever when he did. Or, by judiciously juggling correct <br/>
and incorrect answers he could make a favorite part of the game last <br/>
longer. Or whatever. He used it in his own way. So, if your DS picks a <br/>
wrong answer over and over and isn&#39;t getting frustrated (that would be <br/>
something else entirely) or stays in a particular section for awhile, <br/>
don&#39;t panic - he&#39;s just exploring in his own way and time.</div>

As far as the video games -- a lot of atypical kids (Asperger&#39;s and<br/>
such) do extremely well with video games, and they do exactly what you<br/>
describe -- they go into that space and they&#39;re home.  (Actually, you<br/>
described it as getting &quot;lost&quot; but I would describe it as feeling<br/>
&quot;found.&quot;)  I know of Asperger&#39;s kids who grew up to be video game testers.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like this is a real comfort zone for your son, so support<br/>
him in it.  Learn the games with him, watch and read with him, read<br/>
Sandra&#39;s links about video games and how much can be learned from<br/>
them.  You can still offer other things that sound fun, but just know<br/>
that these games are important to him, and they should be respected<br/>
for the part in his life that they play (no pun intended) &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

I said Asperger&#39;s, then looked back at your email and you had said<br/>
autism.  Fill in autistic spectrum disorder (or whatever you want to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971861552">Thank you very much for all the suggestions and<br/>
directions to find more information.  I realize I have<br/>
jumped in feet (or head?) first without the<br/>
recommended lurking time but I&#39;m kinda bullish about<br/>
my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to answer a few questions and comments that<br/>
may help clarify anything I left out in the first<br/>
novella.<br/>
<br/>
Ellis LOVES to read.  We used a book called &#39;Teach<br/>
Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons&#39;.  We made it<br/>
to about Lesson 49 when we both got bored with it and<br/>
started making up our own stories.  I liked the theory<br/>
and the method.  It worked for him very well and even<br/>
better when we dumped the book :)  (my first hint that<br/>
&#39;not school&#39; was way better than &#39;school&#39; at home)<br/>
<br/>
Ellis is a video junkie and not in a way that I think<br/>
anyone would consider healthy, either physically or<br/>
mentally.  He will shut out everything including his<br/>
own bodily functions once he encounters a screen. <br/>
It&#39;s like hypnosis of the evil swirly eyes kind - kind<br/>
of like &#39;Tommy&#39; in real life.  While my older boys (18<br/>
and pushing 16) were video addicts, I never had to<br/>
physically block the screen or shout loudly into their<br/>
haze just to get them to go to the bathroom.  We&#39;ve<br/>
had to clean furniture and carpets and floors.  And<br/>
not just at home, either.  It&#39;s almost scary.  <br/>
<br/>
Our solution is to curtail his video time to about an<br/>
hour total on any given day.  That includes computer,<br/>
TV, videos, LeapPad, etc.  It really makes a world of<br/>
difference.  Even so, he will literally talk like a<br/>
video game with sound effects, beeps and clicks, hand<br/>
gestures (there&#39;s a name for what he does with his<br/>
hands but I can&#39;t remember it), and is almost<br/>
completely unresponsive when we speak to him,<br/>
sometimes for entire days.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost track of my question/thought but hope this<br/>
may provide additional insight that can help me<br/>
continue to gather information from all of you.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks, again!<br/>
<br/>
Kathy<br/>
<br/>
PS: The elderkinder do not live with us but are<br/>
adored, cherished and worshipped when they do get to<br/>
be here.  They&#39;re pretty terrific guys and they are<br/>
just great with Ellis.<br/>

not a solution, it might be a great problem down the line.  The world of  <br/>
difference might not ultimately be the world you have in mind.<br/>

happen, I&#39;m sure, if you&#39;re interested.d<br/>

joys.  You need to reconsider how you view his hobbies and likes and<br/>
dislikes, because it is through them that learning will happen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He will shut out everything including his<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So is he pooping and peeing in his clothes because he can&#39;t leave the<br/>
game?  Refusing to eat until he is done?  How about suggesting that he<br/>
take care of those things before he starts?  How about fixing him a<br/>
plate of his favorite foods and serving it to him while he plays?<br/>
<br/>

compare children anyway, but comparing a child with a neurological<br/>
difference to his older neurologically typical siblings really isn&#39;t<br/>
fair at all.<br/>
<br/>
Also, computer/video games weren&#39;t the same then when they were your<br/>
son&#39;s age as they are now, either.  It sounds from your word choice<br/>
more like you are the one that has decided that video games are evil.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

minutes isn&#39;t usually even enough to finish one level in most advanced<br/>
video games and defeat the boss and get to a point where the game can<br/>
be saved.<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing while he is engaged in these activities?  What does<br/>
he do for the other 23 hours in a day?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL!  This sounds so much like my son Aaron.  Even his pretend play<br/>
with figures always sounds like a video game, complete with levels,<br/>
hit points, and bosses.  He will set up an incredible scenario and<br/>
have my assigned little toy go through it complete with battles.  Some<br/>
day he might be an awesome computer game creator.<br/>
<br/>
However, lots of little boys sound like walking video games.  I have<br/>
read that over 80% of the verbalization that small boys make are just<br/>
sounds like bangs, whistles, swooshing swords, crashing hot wheels, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Limiting my sons&#39; time with computers and video games backfired big<br/>
time.  It caused them, in a typically Aspie way, to obsess about their<br/>
time on the games down to the last second, and when they weren&#39;t<br/>
allowed to play, their mind was obsessing about the game, thinking<br/>
about when they would be allowed to play again and what they would do.<br/>
 Often they would retreat and then when we asked what they were<br/>
thinking about it was the game.<br/>
<br/>
Releasing the limits actually freed my boys from that bondage. <br/>
Knowing that they could play their games as much as they really wanted<br/>
to helped them let go of the obsessing and anxiety, they could<br/>
complete their games and then put down the controller and walk away<br/>
feeling happy and satisfied and go on to something else.  They could<br/>
also choose not to play, knowing that later they would be able to pick<br/>
it up if they wanted to. <br/>
<br/>
Getting a DVR meant that they could tape the shows they love if we are<br/>
busy outside the house and didn&#39;t spend the entire outing worrying<br/>
about what they were missing or if we would get home in time, and<br/>
could enjoy the activity.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of limiting the video games, you *could* use them as a way to<br/>
connect with your autistic son, to draw him into a world where you are<br/>
interested and talking to him about the games, and building a<br/>
relationship with him.  <br/>
<br/>
We use the Sims and Sims 2 character maker as a way to help Aaron<br/>
focus on people&#39;s faces and expressions.  He sits on his older<br/>
sister&#39;s lap while playing, and they laugh and talk and hug and<br/>
discuss the people they make and how they look and make decisions<br/>
about clothes and hair and their expressions and such.<br/>
<br/>
Aaron and I play a game while we are playing Pokemon Colesseum where<br/>
we both cross our fingers and chant, &quot;pretty please&quot; together,<br/>
(sometimes fast, sometimes slowly, sometimes loudly, sometimes softly)<br/>
until we know whether or not the pokemon we are trying to catch will<br/>
stay in the poke ball.  This is called emotion sharing and referencing<br/>
in therapy circles, where the activities are artificial and designed<br/>
to emphasize these things, but for us, it is just part of our<br/>
enjoyment of an activity together.<br/>
<br/>
So my suggestion would be that instead of seeing his joys and passions<br/>
and hobbies as something that interferes with your relationship with<br/>
him, start seeing them as possibly a place to start to connect.  It<br/>
will overflow into other areas.<br/>
<br/>

will overflow into other areas.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Susan&#39;s whole post is great -- I hope you read it a few times and<br/>
really let it sink in.  I just wanted to speak to the bathroom accidents.<br/>
<br/>
My son has not been diagnosed with any ASDs (autistic spectrum<br/>
disorders)or anything else, but he has definitely had problems with<br/>
bathroom accidents while playing video games.  He has also had them<br/>
while playing other really involved games, usually with other kids. <br/>
But yes, he&#39;s had them the most when playing video games.<br/>
<br/>
The things that have helped the most were time, growth and<br/>
development, and unlimited access to video games.  A few months after<br/>
we did away with all the limits, and just kept reminding him that it<br/>
was okay to pause, because he could play the game for as long as he<br/>
wanted, whenever he wanted, the accidents were greatly reduced (he was<br/>
6 and 1/2 at the time).  It took a few months for him to really get<br/>
it, and for him to trust us.  Now that he&#39;s almost 8, it almost never<br/>
happens, and it&#39;s not a huge deal if it does.<br/>
<br/>
But the other thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the accidents tended to go in<br/>
cycles.  He wouldn&#39;t have any for a long time, and then he would start<br/>
having them again.  I finally decided that this was part of his growth<br/>
process -- he could hold it for longer as he got older, but as he was<br/>
practicing holding it longer, he would overreach his limit and have an<br/>
accident.  Then he would get used to his new &quot;abilities&quot; and things<br/>
would normalize for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I know (from lists and in real life) of quite a few other kids, some<br/>
from completely unschooled families and some not, who have a tendency<br/>
to these accidents, some until they were 10 or so.  It seems to be a<br/>
mix of how their bodies work and of getting so involved with what<br/>
they&#39;re doing, they forget to go.  The parents just gently work with<br/>
them, assure them that whatever it is will be there when they come<br/>
back, help them clean up if needed (my son usually washed out his own<br/>
pants and cleaned up after himself -- it helped him feel more<br/>
independent), and let them know when they need to change clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Gently and nicely -- a good way to go in most situations. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482186687">My sister had problems like this up to the time she was about 10 or 11 <br/>
years old, when we were children in the 50&#39;s/60&#39;s - no video games <br/>
then, she was just intensely involved in playing with other kids out in <br/>
the our neighborhood. She regularly ignored her body signals until it <br/>
was too late. To my dismay and embarrassment!<br/>
