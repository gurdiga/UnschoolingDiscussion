&lt;&lt;Which brings me back to my original quandary.  Since this is the way it<br/>
<br/>
is (and I’m hoping it will improve over time, but I’m not betting on it)<br/>
<br/>
I’m wondering if preschool would be a nice diversion for Rory.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe I can help. I just realized just how little Rory is.<br/>
<br/>
My partner and I, long, long ago, worked as preschool teachers in two very <br/>
good, loving, homey day care centers.  And we were always aware that no matter <br/>
how good the programs were, and how loving and wonderful the adults were, and <br/>
how much the kids really liked being with the other kids and in the program....<br/>
<br/>
Every day, every one of those kids would have preferred to be with their <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
If you ARE thinking about preschool, and REALLY want to do it, please don&#39;t <br/>
do it before age three AT LEAST. If you can wait until four, that&#39;s better. Two <br/>
year olds don&#39;t need very big worlds. Even if your husband only took him to <br/>
the backyard once or twice a week, but played with him, cuddled him, read to <br/>
him, tickled him, made him giggle several times a day... it would be enough.<br/>
<br/>
This may sound awful (and it really is), but if you bring this baby to a <br/>
preschool when he is two years old, and he knows his daddy is home and he COULD be <br/>
with him, it will break his heart, no matter how good the program is.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I don&#39;t think preschool is necessarily an evil thing, and it&#39;s a <br/>
need for some people... but Rory will be happier at home with someone who loves <br/>
him.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s easy to forget the sense of wonder that little ones have at what we<br/>
consider commonplace things. Everyday I go out to the chookpen to collect<br/>
the eggs. Everyday Mia (4) gets excited when we have eggs to bring in. Every<br/>
time I bring home the shopping, the kids are clamouring to see what&#39;s in the<br/>
shopping bags. It&#39;s the same when they watch a movie for the tenth time and<br/>
get just as excited as they did the first time. They bring a sense of<br/>
newness to it.  Maybe it&#39;s that their senses haven&#39;t been dulled, they&#39;re<br/>
totally open.<br/>
<br/>
I think little ones need that time at home. It is a big world out there and<br/>
it can be overwhelming for them especially without a loving parent close by.<br/>
