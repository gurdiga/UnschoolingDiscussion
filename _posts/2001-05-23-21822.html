Has anyone tried to tie this in with any adult that is illiterate?  I mean,<br/>
the<br/>
news media and ps and such are always crying that more and more children and<br/>
adults are illiterate these days. If it is reasonable to say that you can<br/>
transmit basic literacy and math skills within about 50 hours, why are there<br/>
so<br/>
many illiterate adults out there? Do they just not want to learn?  I am in<br/>
total<br/>
agreement with everything everyone has stated about late reading, but this<br/>
just<br/>
popped into my mind. This is not a condemning question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
In my opinion, there are so many illiterate adults because schools try to<br/>
force a one-sized-fits-all curriculum on children. I think that is the<br/>
entire reason that there are adults we all know who hate reading, are afraid<br/>
of math, do not comprehend basic scientific principles, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In the Book of Learning and Forgetting by Frank Smith he writes about how<br/>
true learning happens, and that it isn&#39;t always positive. Many, many<br/>
children learn, very well, that reading or math or science or pull-ups are<br/>
impossible and incomprehensible to them. They don&#39;t forget it, even when<br/>
they&#39;re all grown up, even if people around them are assuring them it&#39;s not<br/>
true.<br/>

<br/>
Someone asked about the idea that all of high school content (or all of it<br/>
that you really need) can be learned in a short number of hours.  Sandra<br/>
and I thought it had been written about by John Holt, but couldn&#39;t cite<br/>
chapter and verse. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another poster came up with a John Taylor Gatto quote with a specific<br/>
number of hours in it.  (Searching the archives for the last week for<br/>
&quot;Gatto&quot; should turn up this post.)<br/>
<br/>
When the discussion turned to adult literacy, I posted the above that you<br/>
quoted.  I still think that Holt is on record somewhere with some estimate<br/>
(low) of number of hours need to learn something.  And I think he may have<br/>
based some of what he said on adults learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
My memory is hopelessly vague, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from posting. <br/>
Sorry.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, Betsy, your memory is more like right on target. I pulled my <br/>
copy of GWS #1-12 off the shelf and found a short essay in GWS #6 <br/>
(September, 1978) titled &quot;Thirty Hours&quot; where John wrote about Ny <br/>
Lille Skole (My Little School) near Copenhagen, in which he described <br/>
a teacher who helped children who were interested in learning to read <br/>
by simply sitting with them and listening to their efforts for the <br/>
most part. John asked the teacher how much help these children seemed <br/>
to need, and the reply was &quot;about 30 hours,&quot; a figure which rang a <br/>
bell for Holt.<br/>
<br/>
Holt then writes about serving as a consultant to teach reading to <br/>
adult illiterates in Ohio, noting that after three ten-hour per week <br/>
sessions (30 hours): &quot;My strong impression at the end of my three <br/>
weeks was that most of the students in the classes I had observed had <br/>
learned enough about reading in their thirty hours so that they could <br/>
go on exploring reading, and become as skillful as they wanted to be, <br/>
on their own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He then recounts Paulo Freire&#39;s experiences with adult illiterate <br/>
peasants in Brazil: &quot;He too found that it took only about 30 hours of <br/>
teaching...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holt ends with this: &quot;Thirty hours. One school week. That is the true <br/>
size of the task.&quot;<br/>

one waited to the age of 15 (instead of starting at 5 or 6).  I thought it <br/>
