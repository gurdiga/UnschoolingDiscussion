<br/>
&gt; WASHINGTON, DC -- A new &quot;fingerprints-for-food&quot;<br/>
&gt; program -- which encourages children to submit their<br/>
&gt; fingerprints to purchase school lunches -- is another<br/>
&gt; frightening example of how law enforcement-style<br/>
&gt; technology is being used to monitor children in public<br/>
&gt; schools, the Libertarian Party said today. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Should 7- and 8-year-olds be required to submit<br/>
&gt; biometric identifiers so they can eat lunch?&quot; asked<br/>
&gt; Steve Dasbach, the party&#39;s national director. &quot;Should<br/>
&gt; children in grammar school be treated like criminals<br/>
&gt; for the convenience of public school bureaucrats? Or<br/>
&gt; has schoolyard surveillance finally gone too far?&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This week, national attention has become focused on 35<br/>
&gt; public schools in Pennsylvania, where school officials<br/>
&gt; have implemented an unprecedented<br/>
&gt; &quot;fingerprints-for-food&quot; program. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Using technology supplied by a company called Sagem<br/>
&gt; Morpho -- which also sells fingerprint-tracking<br/>
&gt; devices to the FBI and the Secret Service -- schools<br/>
&gt; such as the Welsh Valley Middle School encourage<br/>
&gt; children to have a fingerprint scanned, and a<br/>
&gt; numerical representation of it saved in the school&#39;s<br/>
&gt; database. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then, children can put an index finger on a scanner as<br/>
&gt; they move through the cafeteria checkout line. The<br/>
&gt; print is matched in the database, and the price of the<br/>
&gt; lunch is deducted from the family&#39;s account. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; School officials say fingerprinting speeds up lunch<br/>
&gt; lines and ends the problem of lost or stolen lunch<br/>
&gt; money. It&#39;s so successful, they say, the technology<br/>
&gt; may be expanded to allow children to check out books<br/>
&gt; from school libraries, board school buses, and have<br/>
&gt; their attendance taken. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not so fast, says Dasbach. Before schoolchildren are<br/>
&gt; routinely fingerprinted, Americans need to ask: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Do we want our children treated like criminal<br/>
&gt; suspects? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Fingerprinting isn&#39;t just for criminals any more --<br/>
&gt; now it&#39;s for schoolchildren who only want a hot<br/>
&gt; lunch,&quot; noted Dasbach. &quot;Is that the message we want to<br/>
&gt; send about our children?&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Do such programs desensitize children to government<br/>
&gt; demands for biometric identifiers? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Adults are reluctant to allow the government to build<br/>
&gt; databases of biometric identifiers because we know how<br/>
&gt; politicians can abuse such information, and because we<br/>
&gt; understand the Constitutional prohibitions against<br/>
&gt; such privacy-invading programs,&quot; he said. &quot;Perhaps the<br/>
&gt; most ominous thing about fingerprinting schoolchildren<br/>
&gt; is that it conditions them to surrender biometric data<br/>
&gt; whenever the government demands it.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Will the government eventually misuse the<br/>
&gt; information it collects? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;School officials insist these fingerprint images<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t be used for any other purpose,&quot; said Dasbach.<br/>
&gt; &quot;But keep in mind, politicians once promised that<br/>
&gt; Social Security numbers would never be used for<br/>
&gt; general identification purposes, that IRS employees<br/>
&gt; would never illegally divulge your income tax records,<br/>
&gt; and that state motor vehicle departments would never<br/>
&gt; sell your drivers license photo. Yet each of those<br/>
&gt; things happened. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;So, should we trust school bureaucrats when they say<br/>
&gt; they won&#39;t misuse your childrens&#39; fingerprints in the<br/>
&gt; future?&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Are we sacrificing too much for the sake of<br/>
&gt; efficiency? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;This fingerprinting procedure may indeed save time<br/>
&gt; and money, like any other industrial assembly line<br/>
&gt; procedure,&quot; said Dasbach. &quot;But do we really want our<br/>
&gt; children to be monitored like pieces of machinery? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;In a way, this new program exemplifies what is wrong<br/>
&gt; with government-run education: It treats children like<br/>
&gt; interchangeable cogs in a machine, rather than<br/>
&gt; respecting each student as a unique individual.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In light of all these concerns, parents ought to find<br/>
&gt; out whether their local school district is planning to<br/>
&gt; start implementing a similar &quot;fingerprints-for-food&quot;<br/>
&gt; program, and speak out against it, he said. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t allow your children to be fingerprinted like<br/>
&gt; criminals,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#39;t allow your children to be<br/>
&gt; put under the government&#39;s thumb.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
