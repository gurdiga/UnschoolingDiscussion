<br>THanks! She went to Gladwynne Montessori. This was the first experience with 
<br>any type of Montessori. She actually enjoyed it and made friends, etc. but I 
<br>was not going to send her back there. I did not realize when I was checking 
<br>out schools for her that this area was probably one of the most wealthiest 
<br>around. I have nothing against wealthy people at all, but it was not a 
<br>situation I would have kept her in. What I did like about it was no testing 
<br>(except Standardized) or grades. However, it was a school and very 
<br>structured. She decided on her own to homeschool this year. . &nbsp;in fact, I was 
<br>quite shocked when she told me she would. SHe has told me during the year 
<br>this year about how she realizes now how that school was so stifling. . . 
<br>.having to do things at a certain time. . . needing permission to go to the 
<br>bathroom, etc. etc. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I understand your wanting to have order, etc. but I think if you are really 
<br>interested in unschooling, you might want to check out Open Connections. 
<br>Email me privately if you would like phone number, etc. I would be happy to 
<br>talk &nbsp;with you about it.
