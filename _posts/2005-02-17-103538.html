<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066345408">-=-correct me if I am wrong... but you are not the official determiner of what an unschooler is.... each family is welcome to determine what works for them. If it doesn&#39;t fit your definition exactly they may still be unschooling. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is from a post that was returned for being not in keeping with the list&#39;s guidelines (which are here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/info">http://sandradodd.com/lists/info</a><br/>
and in a file here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingDiscussion/</a><br/>
which is, unfortunately, more than one click away unless you&#39;re reading at the yahogoroups webpage already.<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t the only or final word on unschooling, and it doesn&#39;t need to be everything to anyone.  My opinion doesn&#39;t match the other two list owners&#39; nor the other moderators all the time, and that&#39;s fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a poster is on about something that is based on personal matters not even related to unscholing directly, and that&#39;s fine to a point, but sometimes moderators get things back on topic by returning posts or writing to someone on the side, and sometimes it&#39;s done out on the list itself.<br/>
<br/>
There are several unschooling lists here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
<br/>
Others can be found with google.com or by searching yahoogroups<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/">http://groups.yahoo.com/</a><br/>
 with the &quot;join a group&quot; button search, which is right below the &quot;start a new group&quot; button.<br/>
<br/>
With over 1600 members, not everyone can be made happy, but luckily there are lots of places to discuss unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but not all versions of unschooling need to be equally welcome on this list.  There are people who will write that they use a curriculum in the mornings and unschool in the afternoons.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s unschooling, and am unwilling to say &quot;Oh good! If that works for you...&quot;  Some say their kids go to school but they unschool on the weekends.  That&#39;s insufficiently &quot;unschooling&quot; for my support.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not approving or certifying unschoolers on this list, though, we&#39;re discussion various ideas and what will help unschooling flourish and what can be detrimental.  If we stick to the ideas themselves, we&#39;ll be doing well.<br/>
<br/>
All unschoolers are self declared, aren&#39;t they?  There is no application, test and certificate saying &quot;Now you&#39;re an unschooler.&quot;  It&#39;s something people choose to do, knowing they have LOTS of school and school-at-home options. It&#39;s a goal to be moved toward, continuously, as children grow up.  Because it involves ideas and attitudes, it can only be clarified in people&#39;s minds with ideas and experimentation and analysis of their reactions and responses to how it&#39;s unfolding.   &quot;When the kids do [whatever], it makes me angry... [sad... afraid...]&quot; it&#39;s the emotional response that is often the blockage between trusting natural learning and giving up and going back to rules and lessons and deadlines.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t mind lessons and workbooks and deadlines.  Millions of them are out there, and lots claim to be unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
For my volunteer time and energy, I want to help maintain a list where the position is held that those things are not only unnecessary, but can be harmful to an ideal natural learning situation.<br/>
<br/>
Others can spend their volunteer time and energy as they wish, and they do!  There are LOTS and lots of websites and local in-person groups and e-mail lists with other points of view.<br/>
