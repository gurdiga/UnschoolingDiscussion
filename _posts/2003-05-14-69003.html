<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394770272">Hi, I&#39;m a lurker.  Thought I&#39;d jump in and let you know that <br/>
www.greenpeople.com has listings of most food co-ops across the <br/>
country.  Even in my tiny town!!  You can scan blooming prairie for <br/>
what you want and most co-ops will special order for you.  Try the <br/>
Eden Organic Kukicha tea.  Personal fave.<br/>
