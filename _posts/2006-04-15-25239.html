<div id="ygrps-yiv-732281952">Hi Beth!<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re in Georgia, too - Canton, to be exact.  There are a couple other  <br/>
Georgians on this list as well. I have five children ages 13 (twins), 8, 5 and  4.  <br/>
If you&#39;re anywhere near Canton, maybe we can get together!<br/>

<br/>
We are in Cumming, not too far from Canton actually.  I just joined <br/>
the GA unschoolers list as well.  Feel free to email me.  We now have <br/>
a very loose schedule.  Yay!  :)<br/>
