<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222933052">Hello, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering, does anyone have any problems with getting burned out?  We <br/>
have been unschooling, but my hubby and I were always planning on me going <br/>
back to work when the kids get into Kg-- now, we are worried about how to <br/>
handle it financially, which is kind of burning me out a bit, and also what <br/>
about my plans for a career?  I planned to have a part time career when my <br/>
kids were both in school-- what now?  Can you homeschool and work?  Can you <br/>
unschool at home and still work in a schooled world?  I find its so hard to <br/>
stop thinking and moving in the unschooling way when I need to go to work.  <br/>
Any suggestions or comments on this subject would be great.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417174889">Dear Rachael,<br/>
I haven&#39;t responded to the list yet because I was waiting until I had<br/>
something pressing or useful to say. The area of working and unschooling<br/>
is something I&#39;ve had experience in.<br/>
<br/>
I started unschooling when my older daugther was 7 and my younger 5. I<br/>
teach parttime at a small local college which only required  I<br/>
actually be on campus 12 hours a week. What I did was to find/create<br/>
activities/classes my kids were interested in primarily through our<br/>
homeschooling group which puts out a calander of activities every month.<br/>
Sometimes I had to create the opportunity myself, for instance by<br/>
contacting a dance studio and asking it they could teach a class at such<br/>
and such a time (when I had to be at work). Then I&#39;d call around to other<br/>
hs&#39;ers and try to find interested dancers. Then I&#39;d ask another mom<br/>
whose children had signed up  if I could drop off my daughters at their<br/>
house so she could take them and her daughter to class at the same time.<br/>
Usually it wasn&#39;t asking too much if I could drop them off an hour ahead<br/>
of time (the girls could play with their child) and I could return the<br/>
favor by picking them all up after the class and maybe bringing their<br/>
child to my house to play.<br/>
<br/>
There are always places that are unused during the school day<br/>
that wouldn&#39;t mind opening their facility for hs&#39;ers: gymnastics studios,<br/>
places that teach children&#39;s art classes, tennis facilties, pottery<br/>
places that teach classes.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this didn&#39;t work all the time. Sometimes I just had to do the<br/>
trade thing: I&#39;ll have your child to play this day, if my girls can come<br/>
play at your house this day. And fortuneately I had several moms from my<br/>
hs group that this worked with (meaning that our kids got along well<br/>
enough that seeing each other a few times a week wasn&#39;t too much).<br/>
<br/>
When all else failed I had to bring them to the college and let them color<br/>
or play on the computer or play with legos while I taught my classes. They<br/>
really didn&#39;t like this scenario and it was a bit dubious from the<br/>
college&#39;s pt. of view. Sometimes I could take them to their dad&#39;s office<br/>
who teaches at the same college. sometimes he had a hour free to take them<br/>
to lunch or to the college gym.<br/>
<br/>
REmember too that they grow up fast. Now mine are 10 and 12 and I can<br/>
leave them to do their own projects for a few hours at time. Although<br/>
these young years seem interminable while you&#39;re in them, in reality they<br/>
fly by. Mostly you need to find a job with flexible hours and you need to<br/>
look for multiple solutions to childcare. It really helps to have a hs<br/>
support group and a husband able to take up some slack.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s much more I could impart, so if you have other questions feel free<br/>
to ask.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Of course I can&#39;t speak to your situation, but I thought I &quot;had&quot; to work<br/>
for financial reasons.  To make a long story short, we&#39;ve been living on<br/>
one very irregular income for 6 years now.  It is stressful at times<br/>
(understatement), yet amazing how we always somehow manage.  It is very<br/>
worth the trade-off for our family, for now.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I planned to have a part time career when my kids were both in school--<br/>
&gt;&gt;what now?  Can you homeschool and work?&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Technically, you could have someone provide childcare while you are<br/>
working and you provide &quot;school&quot; when you are home.  I have a friend<br/>
whose daughter is being &quot;homeschooled&quot; by someone else, but our state<br/>
doesn&#39;t require children to go to school until they are 8.  So as far as<br/>
any authorities are concerned, the dd is being babysat.  There was stuff<br/>
on this list a while ago about hs other people&#39;s children.<br/>
I&#39;ll bet there are ways that you could work this situation out.  Good<br/>
luck! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know several people who hs and work.  many, like me, work around our<br/>
partner&#39;s schedule.  My dh flexes his week to get off @ 3:15 two days a<br/>
week and I teach on those days from 4-9 pm, do office hours another<br/>
evening after dinner, and then work at home and in my office on weekends a<br/>
lot, for a total of 30+ hours a week.  I know several people who are<br/>
nurses and hs, and one midwife who does it.  It just requires thinking<br/>
outside of the lines to work it all out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am a hospital RN and for the last year and a half have been working<br/>
full-time nights, four 9-hour shifts a week.  It has worked well with hsing<br/>
when that is all I work--however, due to our being chronically short<br/>
staffed, I end up working a lot more than that.  I have tried hard to only<br/>
work weekends, but have finally given up and gone to part-time, which will<br/>
start in November.  I have taken another part-time job which I can do at<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
We spent years with only one income, and I have a lot of experience in<br/>
stretching our dollars.  My second income has been wonderful, but it has<br/>
been a tradeoff in terms of family life.  It was a big decision to go back<br/>
to part-time work, and I was afraid dh would be opposed, but he was very<br/>
supportive (probably feeling the lack of good meals).  I could not have<br/>
worked and homeschooled young children, but my kids are high school age,<br/>
now, and working very independently--however they need their mother more<br/>
than they have had me for the last 18 months.<br/>

<br/>
I worked while homeschooling for the past two years. I was a bartender, going <br/>
to work from 8-10:00 pm and getting off work around 3:00 am. It worked very <br/>
well for us. Now, due to a change in my husbands career, I don&#39;t have to work <br/>
at all, and it is even better!! There are ways to work around the &quot;typical&quot; <br/>
setup, however, and I trust you will find a way that will work for you.<br/>
