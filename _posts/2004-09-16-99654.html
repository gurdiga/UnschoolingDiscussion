I can  remember some things irritatingly well and others leave me  almost<br/>
instantly.   I can never find my keys, shoes, measuring  spoons or car in<br/>
any parking lot.   I sometimes get all the way  to the post office before<br/>
I realize I didn&#39;t bring the mail with me.   I read when I was four<br/>
years old and I can still recite &quot;The Raven&quot;  which I memorized in third<br/>
grade.   I know how many strips of  fabric are in every rug I ever made.  <br/>
Not everyone fits neatly in the  zone most of society would like us to<br/>
believe is &quot;normal.&quot;    My  feeling is &quot;normal&quot; is much bigger than most<br/>
people ever consider and if we  could relax everyone would be better off. <br/>
If her friends are hurting her  feelings with their comments maybe she<br/>
can think about the things she does  well and maybe you could tell them to<br/>
zip it. <br/>
