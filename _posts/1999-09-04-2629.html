certainly found myself wishing that I were independently wealthy when my 14<br/>

would have bought it in a heartbeat.<br/>

Too commercial and they don&#39;t want &quot;extras&quot; wandering about in costume.  As <br/>
for the politics, plenty of folks who see a small pond and immediately wanna <br/>
be a big fish, but I think it&#39;s pretty easy to play your own game in it, and <br/>
ignore the petty silliness.  After all, when things are said and done, a <br/>
pointy hat and a dollar will get you a cup of coffee like anybody else.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think I saw the beginning of this thread, but I find the SCA pretty <br/>
unschoolish and fun, though for an intentional community I&#39;m not so sure.  I <br/>
saw someone advertizing for &quot;populace&quot; for some hunk of land they wanted to <br/>
set up an SCA community on once, but I can see major cans of worms there.  <br/>
One can be like-minded enough with a bunch of people to enjoy a hobby with <br/>
them, without agreeing enough on fundamental values and priorities to feel <br/>
very like-minded when it comes down to 24/7.<br/>

Sorry, you&#39;re right.  Lovely people and all that.  I guess I was comparing it <br/>
to the SCA, not Walmart.  In the SCA you can get years of martial instruction <br/>
and almost any kind of craft instruction you want also, scot free.  I do <br/>
calligraphy and illumination in the SCA, and the work is given to the kingdom <br/>
and then given to award recipients to commemorate their service.  If someone <br/>
wants to learn what I can teach, I&#39;m expected to make an effort to help them, <br/>
without remuneration.  Commercially, my work would have to run into several <br/>
hundred dollars.  Obviously, yes, if I want to actually make a living at my <br/>
craft, I would have to go elsewhere, though as fewer SCA people are making <br/>
all their own stuff, and as, on the whole, they get wealthier, that is <br/>
changing.  I am probably a complete curmudgeon, and frankly, my budget is <br/>
more in the rummage sale range than even Walmart&#39;s, so I find county fairs <br/>
and craft shows and all manner of things too commercial.  But, if I have to <br/>
pay a substantial entrance fee to something, I want workshops and activities, <br/>
not sales booths, (&#39;cause getting in has left me broke),  and things to <br/>
passively observe. The renfaires seem to fill a niche in the world and <br/>
entertain people at large very nicely, which is well and good, and they do <br/>
provide a living for good craftspeople and performers.  But, if you want to <br/>
learn to make your own hat, or stop rolling dice to see whether your <br/>
character beats another in a fight, the SCA is there and people will show you <br/>
how to do everything they know without any money changing hands.<br/>

  My husband and I are potters--we have a gallery but we also do craft shows. <br/>
We appreciate people who value the hand crafted object--things that are made <br/>
by hand with heart. We don&#39;t even try to compete with the vavious &quot;marts&quot; (K, <br/>
Wal- etc). We make stuff one at a time, by hand.  We don&#39;t sell, people <br/>
buy.(kind of like we don&#39;t teach, our kids learn) ..It&#39;s a different way of <br/>
being--it is a reflection of our value structure.  when people comment about <br/>
a finger print or a nail mark we tell people that what they are seeing is the <br/>
mark of the craftsman--it lets you know that the item was made by a person, <br/>
not a machine!!   <br/>

  We hear comments about the cost of the work all the time, and we struggle <br/>
with making things accessible to people.  It&#39;s a tough issue--I don&#39;t know <br/>
any wealthy craftspeople (monitarily, that is).Many don&#39;t have health <br/>
coverage and few have retirement plans.the longest vacation we&#39;ve taken is 3 <br/>
days. My husband and i are rare--neither one of us has another job or teaches <br/>
in addition to being a maker of things--and I haven&#39;t been in the studio for <br/>
a year. Making things by hand is expensive, period.  Time, materials, how <br/>
long it has taken one to develop the skills to create the work...   We will <br/>
always work out a plan for people if they want a piece. <br/>
 We&#39;ve organized other artists to donate good seconds to the battered women&#39;s <br/>
shelter in out area--thie items are given to women for the holidays, <br/>
birthdays, mothers&#39; day etc.We give our time and our work to various <br/>
charitable community groups.  <br/>
 We have a family to support--house, vehicle etc.  It&#39;s tough to balence it <br/>
all...<br/>
