&lt;&lt;  what <br/>
are the &quot;hidden lessons that ARE learned&quot; from schooling and not <br/>
learned by unschooling kids? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people are retarded and we don&#39;t have to care about them.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, that&#39;s not hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Neither is this:<br/>
<br/>
If you study and always finish your homework and never ditch school or do <br/>
drugs or cause trouble, you will make over $100,000 a year and be happy your <br/>
whole life.<br/>
<br/>
Math has to be taught in a certain order.  (Also not hidden; lots of <br/>
math-degreed adults still believe it.)<br/>
<br/>
Sports can make you rich, and good equipment is only for those who might be <br/>
on that track.<br/>
<br/>
Music and art aren&#39;t really important.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Business math&quot; isn&#39;t real math.<br/>
