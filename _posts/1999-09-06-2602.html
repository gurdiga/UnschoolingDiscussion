I must agree.  I too have a dd that indicates she desires a schedule<br/>
(although when I come close she bulks at them) and I abhore schedules and<br/>
being tied down to time allotments.  Now, understand that I have not read<br/>
the rest of this thread yet (I&#39;m a little behind on email right now) but<br/>
how can one unschool with a schedule anyway?  Do you say OK, time for math<br/>
or science and then let them pursue their own specific subject?  Leaves me<br/>
a little confused based on what little I know of unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>somethings are schedualed in our lives whether or not we homeschool. Isaac<br/>
has asked for tennis lesson, you have to schedual those. Shabbat is friday<br/>
nite so we arent gonna celebrate it when he feels like it but when it is :)<br/>
I think those are normal scheduals .<br/>
<br/>
what is annoying to me is that he asks for a schedual and then gets pissed<br/>
when i make one. So I have now taken to making a calandar that says what my<br/>
plans are and what his have been adn then he can add anything he wants and<br/>
do it himself.<br/>
