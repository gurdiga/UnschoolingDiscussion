<div id="ygrps-yiv-393053399">A pamphlet has been put out by a number of British authors through the<br/>
National Centre for Language and Literacy that you can buy here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncll.org.uk/20_books/20_our_publications/20_our_publications/40-resources/view_publication_html?mainID=38480">http://www.ncll.org.uk/20_books/20_our_publications/20_our_publications/40-resources/view_publication_html?mainID=38480</a><br/>
<br/>
Apparently authors including Philip Pullman, Quentin Blake, Jamila<br/>
Gavin, Michael Rosen, Jacqueline Wilson and Bernard Ashley are up in<br/>
arms over having their works used in comprehension exercise.  The<br/>
Guardian (<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,5500,1636322,00.html">http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,5500,1636322,00.html</a> )<br/>
 quotes Michael Rosen as saying: <br/>
&quot;The literacy hour doesn&#39;t encourage the idea that books are for you,<br/>
that they are yours. It says that they are texts which can be quizzed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actually these are both nice quotes as well: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What we object to is having our books treated as if they are frogs<br/>
ready for dissection, when actually they are live frogs,&quot; says the<br/>
illustrator Blake, who was children&#39;s laureate from 1999-2001.<br/>
<br/>
Ashley agrees: &quot;I don&#39;t allow my books to be used for comprehension<br/>
exercises, and I haven&#39;t for 30 years. I write to entertain, and I<br/>
won&#39;t have any kid sweat over something I wrote to delight.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of the authors taking umbrage at having their works<br/>
used for something other than pleasure.  And, I suppose if I had<br/>
written something for the pleasure of others I would be upset as well.  <br/>
