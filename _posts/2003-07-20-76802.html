<br/>
I know very much what it&#39;s like.<br/>
I have three children that are very strong minded, one is more compliant and a people pleaser. Out of those three, one is EXTREMELY sensitive/hyper/intense...whatever you want to label it, he&#39;s intense in my book. A joyful, happy person, but NOT compliant in any way, nor is he an easy child comparitively. I am very , very selective about where we go and at what time of day because certain places/times are almost sure to bring about a meltdown if I&#39;m not properly prepared.<br/>
<br/>
But isn&#39;t that our job as parents? To know and understand the child development phases and know our own children well enough to be creative and thoughtful where their temperments are concerned?<br/>
If I had an intense child that was sure NOT to hold my hand in a dangerous area, and I knew this about them, it&#39;s MY fault if I get us into a situation, not the childs!!! yikes.<br/>
A backpack works wonders. If a three year old is too large for the backpack, then make sure you have a free hand. There are always many options to avoid hitting people and treating children with disrespect.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, in a life threatening situation a child will get my protection whether they want it or not, they would want it if they truly understood what was happening. So knowing that I am acting on their behalf, because they don&#39;t understand, is my job too.<br/>
But that&#39;s not what we need to discuss on this list. It&#39;s a given that any of us would protect our child against their will if it was a life/death situation.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about day to day solutions for these children/families. My children have as much say in our activities as I do. If they didn&#39;t want to go to the library, we&#39;d compromise. There are always SO many solutions and I think it&#39;s ultra important for parents to consider children&#39;s requests, likes/dislikes as equally important to your own.<br/>
That isn&#39;t happening if the attitude is &quot;too bad, we HAVE to do this&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes Deb, and good for you too! Unfortunately, thats is not the case for <br/>
everyone. The cousin I spoke of in my previous post is probably the polar opposite <br/>
of your child as you describe him. She does not know happiness, she does not <br/>
know compassion, she does not know why people love her despite these things. <br/>
She acts out in ways that would have some asking when is her head going to start <br/>
spinning? It is heart breaking. There are no answers. Whatever choice is made <br/>
in every situation, never seems right. To stay inside for fear of how the <br/>
public perceives her, would leave very little life to be lived. To &quot;talk out&quot; the <br/>
things she does is like talking to a wall. There is no consequence that works <br/>
either. So when I said that even I felt the urge to slap her when she spoke <br/>
tose words to her mother, my aunt, I realize that even that would have no <br/>
consequence for her. She would neither change her behavior, nor would it make <br/>
anyone in our family feel better. It is one of those things that are so sad and <br/>
make so little sense. Just this afternoon, this child asked my mother, after my <br/>
mom complimented her on behaving so nicely for the first half of the day, &quot;So <br/>
are you ready for me to be evil now?&quot; My mom was taken aback and just answered, <br/>
&quot;No. Why? Do you want to be?&quot; The child just laughed and reminded my mom <br/>
about grabbing my 24 yr old sister by the neck on the 4th of July. She recognizes <br/>
what she did as bad or evil and yet cannot control the urge and followthrough, <br/>
thereby acting out these horrible things.<br/>
<br/>
So all the talking in the world isn&#39;t gonna change it, all the hitting in the <br/>
world isn&#39;t gonna change it, but is there an answer? Unfortunately, not so <br/>
far. But she is loved anyway. She is treated with compassion in spite of lacking <br/>
it. She is treated like a human, even when she acts likes a monster. So what <br/>
are the adults in her life supposed to do? They have to live the double edged <br/>
sword, the catch 22, they have to protect others, themselves and even her from <br/>
herself. I can&#39;t even begin to contemplate what that must be like as a <br/>
parent. I guess it makes my kids, even in the midst of hormonal changes and sibling <br/>
bickering to be angelic in comparrison.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who has been pondering these things for days just because it is so <br/>
painful for anyone who lives it.<br/>

&gt; Tia<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello Tia,<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for the reply and the answer is yes to every one of your questions. She <br/>
was adopted by my aunt and uncle when she was 1 week old. She was born crack <br/>
addicted along with fetal alchohol syndrome. She was born at 30 weeks <br/>
justation and was a mere 3 lbs at birth. <br/>
<br/>
This is what makes the story so sad. Her parents (my Aunt & Uncle) lost their <br/>
25+ yr marriage primarily due to her issues. I&#39;m not saying she is to blame, <br/>
but her problems are the most extensive I have ever seen. Everyone in my <br/>
family has been on this journey of searching out any and all theories, <br/>
alternatives, meds, you name it, it has been done. That is why in one of my posts, I said <br/>
the poor thing has more labels than the cans in my pantry. I meant that. The <br/>
list just seems to grow and the answers thus far have never helped. She is 14 <br/>
and has the maturity of maybe an 8 year old on a really good day. She has a <br/>
very high IQ, but cannot cope with minute to minute life. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t that I anticipate anyone knowing any of the answers we have <br/>
desparately searched for for all these years, rather that I could identify with Oom&#39;s <br/>
story on a personal level. I just think sometimes we judge so harshly without <br/>
knowing the circumstances. There may never be an answer that is going to make <br/>
her life have a positive outcome, but we still hope everyday. We have all had <br/>
people ask us how we could possibly love such a child. The answer is, it takes <br/>
work but she is still worthy of being loved. She is still a child. She has <br/>
issues most people will never deal with in their whole lifetimes, wrapped up in <br/>
one body. <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who of course believes she did in fact choose this life karmically <br/>
speaking, but doesn&#39;t think that negates her need to be loved in spite of that <br/>
choice.<br/>

doing respite care for other foster parents.  I can almost picture the girl you <br/>
are describing, as I&#39;ve seen children like her quite a few times.  There is <br/>
one boy in our program with all the traits you are describing.  The foster <br/>
family that has him and his sister are saints...have stuck by this kid through <br/>
unbelievable behaviors...waited years for him to go to a &quot;famous&quot; attachment <br/>
disorder doctor, and he is finally beginning to turn around a tiny bit.  Still, he <br/>
has so far to go and may never change completely and may end up hospitalized. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We were lucky...our adopted son (was a foster son) made a huge turnaround.  <br/>
Don&#39;t know what we did right, maybe it had nothing to do with us.  But I think <br/>
we&#39;ve just been really, really lucky that the 3 kids we were placed with DON&#39;T <br/>
have the problems you are describing (and the one with similar behaviors got <br/>
past them).<br/>

on another list.  Oh, wait, I am.  Remember when you described my<br/>
&#39;suburban&#39;, physically fit life, and I told you that you were way off?<br/>
Remember when you said I must have &#39;dainty and well behaved&#39; daughters?<br/>
Remember we talked about spanking and how you can rationalize it all you<br/>
want but it is NEVER necessary?  Remember we talked about what we do when<br/>
one child doesn&#39;t want to do what the family &#39;has&#39; to do?  Remember we<br/>
talked about the fact that there are families where children are given<br/>
freedom to make all of their own choices?  Deja-vu all over again.<br/>
<br/>
I know that you&#39;ve been told very nicely in the past couple of weeks that<br/>
your posts come across as rude and offensive.  I see that you&#39;ve decided not<br/>
to let that affect your posting style.<br/>
<br/>
You are on an(other) unschooling list.  You are not going to find a lot of<br/>
support here for parenting methods that rely on the underlying premise that<br/>
parents and children are adversaries.  I sincerely hope that you won&#39;t find<br/>
it on ANY unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
The amount of anger that you spew in your emails is really astounding to me.<br/>
The fact that they&#39;re so filled with sexism, insults, and disrespect for<br/>
children saddens me.  ~Rue<br/>

Cope, that&#39;s what you do. I was separated from my husband for 6 months once <br/>
and I took off with my then 4 year old son to a harsh city - South Bronx, New <br/>
York. Had no car, no job, no baby-sitter and little money and we stayed with a <br/>
friend who worked all the time. There was drugs and violence like I&#39;ve never <br/>
seen. The bus was always an issue. My son was use to a car and hated the bus, <br/>
he would give me such a hard time getting on the bus but even then I learned <br/>
the best times of his days and what favorite toy or snack to take and so on that <br/>
made it so much easier. My son was a typical almost 5 year old, hyper and <br/>
defiant but we coped and it was not easy. I think that if you are living in the <br/>
slums or rich and famous, we can all cope....if we want.<br/>

&gt; That sounds a lot like &quot;if you aren&#39;t upper middle class, able-bodied  <br/>

&gt; reason?  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know a heck of a lot of people who think, gee, I COULD afford to live  <br/>
&gt; in a<br/>
&gt; gated community with a name like Whispering Willow Estate, and I COULD  <br/>
&gt; send the<br/>
&gt; butler out to the grocery store, so I could stay home with Muffy.  But  <br/>
&gt; instead,<br/>
&gt; I think I&#39;ll go move to a bad neighborhood in a strange city 2000  <br/>
&gt; miles from<br/>
&gt; home, where I don&#39;t know a soul and my husband has just deserted me.  <br/>
&gt; Then I&#39;ll<br/>

parent is around but that does not mean that the behavior will not continue <br/>
when the parent is not around.  I have been dealing with that.  A friend of my <br/>
sons.  His parents spank.  He is quite nice when they are around but if he comes <br/>
over alone he is a horror.  So much anger and destruction, quite the bully.  <br/>
I have had to limit the times he comes to our house.  If the boys want him <br/>
over we make a picnic out of it and the parents come along.  Although they have <br/>
never spanked in front of us they threaten the child.  That is always a tough <br/>
one to explain to my boys but I try to be honest and we talk about why we do <br/>
things the way we do in our family.  My boys know that I was spanked growing up. <br/>
 etc etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-982626609">&quot;Trust me, I have a biology degree and I do know some <br/>
things.  Boys are relatively &quot;retarded&quot; in these areas, and yet they<br/>
 tend to be if anything MORE active at a younger age, so the potential for getting themselves into danger should be obvious.  And no, it isn&#39;t possible to just talk them out of it. I don&#39;t think anyone who has only raised girls fully understands just how much trouble little boys can get themselves into, things that wouldn&#39;t even occur to the average mom until they happen, because as a general rule we just don&#39;t think the way they do! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t trust anything you say at this point.<br/>
You may know some things, but not enough about unschooling and raising children for me to trust what you say.<br/>
<br/>
The entire above paragraph made me physically ill. I can&#39;t believe a person that claims to know so much can say boys are relatively &quot;retarded&quot; in those areas. Sick.<br/>
You act like you are the only one at this list that has intense, active boys. Like we all have quiet, complacent girls that don&#39;t question anything just because we advocate peaceful respectful parenting.<br/>
You couldn&#39;t be more wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I have three boys, one is very calm and peaceable. I have a girl that is not. I think more girls are complacent and agreeable because that was the only acceptable thing in our society for so long.<br/>
<br/>
I have a two year old that is an incredibly intense boy.<br/>
He uses knives to cut his food, when I say &quot;that knife is too sharp, let&#39;s use a different one&quot; he immedietly hands it to me.<br/>
Why?<br/>
Because he trusts that I want him to get what he wants/needs also. I am not his adversary.<br/>
He had three melt downs at the health food co-op the other day. Each time I talked calmly until he listened and then explained to him that the candy he wanted had to be paid for first (only because it was in bulk) and then I would give it to him. He was able to calm down and listen because we DO have this trust and respect.<br/>
<br/>
If I yell &quot;STOP&quot; it is for a good reason, and he knows it. Does this mean it&#39;s safe to trust him around cars? Of course not, he doesn&#39;t understand the danger. But to smack him would hurt the trust we have built and he&#39;d be MUCH less likely to listen to me when he really needs to.<br/>

humiliation likely felt much worse.  I shudder to imagine how that <br/>
child felt to have a crowd of big people cheering on the big person <br/>
who smacked him.  The main lesson of a spanking is that &quot;might makes <br/>
right,&quot; and that lesson was reinforced by the cheering on-lookers.<br/>
Personally, I want to cheer when I see a parent speaking gently and <br/>
respectfully to his/her child, and handling difficult moments with <br/>
patience and self-control.  <br/>
Instead of cheering you on while you smacked your child in <br/>
desperation, why didn&#39;t one of those on-lookers help you with your <br/>
groceries so you&#39;d have your hands free to get your child safely on <br/>
the bus without resorting to violence?  That&#39;s what I would have <br/>
done.<br/>

don&#39;t call it unschooling, but they live it more than anyone else that I<br/>
know).  Anyway, we saw a progressive play where you walk around with a guide<br/>
on to each part.  They have a just turned 3 year old wonderful outgoing boy.<br/>
Our group was about 30 people and their boy wandered around the group as we<br/>
walked.  He was totally safe and very kind and respectful to all the people<br/>
around us.  At the end, we were led into the parking lot, their boy followed<br/>
in with the crowd.  It just so happened that none of the adults in our party<br/>
were close to him at that second.  The father leapt ahead, found the boy<br/>
walking on a log, hugged him in a not scared way, then very calmly and<br/>
politely started pointing out the cars around us.  The boy calmly noticed<br/>
the cars for the first time, so the father continued in his calm and gentle<br/>
voice telling him how it scared him for the boy to be around those big cars<br/>
especially at night when he was so little and wouldn&#39;t be seen.  It was an<br/>
amazing conversation that made me want my family to spend more time with<br/>
their family.  No yelling, no screaming, everyone was listened to and<br/>
everyone was heard.  The boy had done nothing &quot;wrong&quot;, but he was well aware<br/>
to look out a bit more in the future.  (Meanwhile my almost 3 year old<br/>
refused to leave my arms, not that I minded.)<br/>
<br/>
Children do listen when they are talked to.  Maybe not always, but like the<br/>
logical people in this world, if they are regularly respected they will<br/>
regularly respect.  In a busy street scene, my kids know exactly where I<br/>
need them to be and what their options are for their (and my) safety.  I<br/>
have had some challenging moments with my oldest in the past (with regard to<br/>
car safety), but after we were all calmed down we had some very enlightening<br/>
conversations- she really did not realize that people could be squished and<br/>
killed.  I hadn&#39;t wanted to scare her with details of that, but she was<br/>
quite interested to find out it really could happen.  Hitting on a street is<br/>
not an option, pulling a person (any person) back from a moving vehicle is,<br/>
of course, but it doesn&#39;t sound like that was what the problem was.  I agree<br/>
that anyone who applauds at a mother for hitting her child should be<br/>
ashamed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great post!  What a sweet dad.<br/>
<br/>
We are having this conversation on an adoptive board I frequent...same thing, <br/>
spanking is OK when the kid&#39;s going out into the street.  <br/>
<br/>
I suggested taking the child to very busy intersections way ahead of time, <br/>
before they begin &quot;running into the street&quot; (of course holding very tight to the <br/>
hand) and letting them see how big the cars are, how fast, powerful, etc <br/>
(having visions of busy Los Angeles corners from my childhood).  Talk about how <br/>
dangerous it would be to walk out right in front of them and what would happen.  <br/>
Next time you see a dead possum or squirrel or dog or whatever on the side of <br/>
the road, point it out...that poor animal ran out in front of a car.  They <br/>
don&#39;t know any better, but we do!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876943333">We live on a very busy street (especially in the summer with all of the tourists) in Gloucester MA. I think about that street all the time. We have a great big back yard but the only way to get to our cars is to go outside the front way, right next to all of those cars racing down the road. Now, when I say I think about this often, I mean it! I have a newly turned three year old rambunctious energetic little girl. She loves to run from me, she loves to hide from me, she thinks all of these games are hysterical:) I do the same exact thing that your friend did with his son, with my little Sadie. Every day when we go out there I explain this to her, that I love her so much that I want her to always be with me (and her two sisters) and those cars out there could really hurt her. I tell her if she is acting particularly impatient that day, that this scares me, please hold my hand... and do you know, that kid knows a heck of a lot about cars for a three year old. She practically could<br/>
 cross the street on her own (not that I would ever let her now) she looks both ways and she holds onto my hands. I couldnt imagine hitting her over this... I really couldn&#39;t. Kelli<br/>
