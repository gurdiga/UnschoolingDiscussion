&gt; <br/>
&gt; check out styles here:   www.Birkenstock-cn.com  .   specials, bargains and<br/>
&gt; closeouts here, too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for even better prices, look for them on ebay;  lots of new but obsolete<br/>
&gt; (past seasons) styles, plus sometimes gently used ones.  best to find them<br/>
&gt; locally to try on to figure out your sizing, then buy online.<br/>

couple hours north of here.  There are SOME perks to living in Germany!<br/>

sell them at the conference.LOL You could probably make a pretty penney or <br/>
two.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301573243">I am going no-mail for a while or I&#39;ll never get my script finished. The<br/>
list is too interesting and sucks up my time. I have no capacity to<br/>
resist temptation and not check my mail. In reality I probably won&#39;t<br/>
check the lists very often either, however I will return, well before<br/>
the SC conference. If for some reason that eludes me completely at the<br/>
moment anyone should want to speak to me, my email address is available.<br/>
In closing I would like to add that I was watching &quot;Bridget Jones Diary&quot;<br/>
last night and Colin Firth is still the top of my list of Doable.<br/>
