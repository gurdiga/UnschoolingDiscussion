<div id="ygrps-yiv-396771123">**People study the effects of drugs on the unborn, the effects of the <br/>
<br/>
mother&#39;s emotions on the unborn and what effects literature reading <br/>
<br/>
and music have on the unborn.  And then we&#39;re going to say it&#39;s ok to <br/>
<br/>
take their lives?  I don&#39;t think that taking the life of a child <br/>
<br/>
sounds like even an option for an unschooler. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**This isn&#39;t a religious list and I don&#39;t think this is a good topic for this <br/>
<br/>
list at all.**<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t necessarily a religious subject. I don&#39;t see a hint of there being a <br/>
religous argument in the post being quoted. I think it&#39;s an interesting <br/>
question, in spite of it&#39;s being a potentially explosive topic. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see abortion as a religious issue. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I may choose to do a certain thing in a certain situation...that may be <br/>
abortion or smoking or some other issue.  And I do talk about things with my <br/>
children (granted mine are boys) And I am not sure how the topic would play <br/>
out in real life.  It is hard to say when your children are still little and <br/>
you have not had this discussion but I would hope that I would be able to <br/>
talk about it and let them make the choice with my support and a mother.  <br/>
Just as I do any other choice they make.  This one may be a difficult choice <br/>
but is still a choice I couldn&#39;t foresee taking away from anyone.<br/>
