<div id="ygrps-yiv-856470934">The African Lungfish lives in the swamps and rivers of West and South Africa<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oregonzoo.com/cards/Rainforest/lungfish.african.htm)">http://www.oregonzoo.com/cards/Rainforest/lungfish.african.htm)</a>.  It has<br/>
lungs which allow it to breath and stay alive during the dry season in soft<br/>
mud within a mucus-lined cocoon.  It can survive in such a state for up to<br/>
four years.  When the waters return, it leaves the cocoon and pretty much<br/>
swims around like your average fish.<br/>
<br/>
The African Lungfish is well adapted to the seasonality of it&#39;s physical<br/>
environment.  It instinctively knows when it&#39;s time to carry on as usual and<br/>
similarly, when to slow down and burrow in.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I&#39;m as in touch with my own instincts as the African Lungfish<br/>
is.  Humans live in physical/emotional/business environments which have<br/>
cycles and seasons as well.  There is a time to build, to plant seeds, to<br/>
prepare, and there is also a time to retrench, to rest, and to burrow in.<br/>
Sometimes, in our 24-hour, instant gratification, hyper-materialistic<br/>
society,  it can be too easy to forget these principles.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness for the animals to help us remember!<br/>
