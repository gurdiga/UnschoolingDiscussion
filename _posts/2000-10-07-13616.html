<div id="ygrps-yiv-933174028">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Here is yet another news story that ran a couple days ago in Japan on the <br/>
emotional scars of Japanese schoolchildren.<br/>
<br/>
This story focuses on the phenomenon known as *hiki-komori*, literally <br/>
&quot;locking oneself away,&quot; in Japanese. An alarming number of Japanese <br/>
youths seem to be undergoing this emotional crisis now and the &quot;experts&quot; <br/>
seem almost at a loss as to how to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
This article does a good job of covering the issue in general. But <br/>
unfortunately, the story stops short of investigating the undeniable <br/>
links between *hiki-komori* and school. Perhaps the &quot;experts&quot; just <br/>
haven&#39;t gotten around to researching that particular connection yet.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, Japanese children in droves are losing their very spirit <br/>
and direction in life....  <br/>

Asahi Evening News - 5 October 2000<br/>

THE SCARY &#39;REAL WORLD&#39; OF RECLUSIVE YOUNGSTERS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In early August, more than 100 parents gathered at a community center in <br/>
Omiya, Saitama Prefecture, to discuss what was wrong with their children. <br/>
One 59-year-old mother spoke about her 32-year-old son who had hardly <br/>
ventured out of the home for 10 years, bathing only once a month, rarely <br/>
speaking to his family and sometimes behaving violently.<br/>
<br/>
The mother said she had consulted public health officials and hospitals, <br/>
none of which were able to come up with convincing explanations or <br/>
suggestions for treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Another parent complained about a 29-year-old son, whose only <br/>
communication over the previous five years had been in the form of <br/>
written notes left on the kitchen table with instructions such as: &quot;Get <br/>
me a video-game magazine&quot; or &quot;Do something about the dog that keeps <br/>
barking all day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yet another parent spoke of her teenage son washing his hands so <br/>
frequently that they were always raw, and who refused to attend school <br/>
because both the school and its students were &quot;dirty.&quot; He even admonished <br/>
his mother to keep her hands clean.<br/>
<br/>
This tendency toward reclusiveness among young people -- a phenomenon <br/>
known as *hikikomori* (social withdrawal) -- seems to be rising at an <br/>
alarming rate. The meeting in August was part of a growing movement by <br/>
confused and troubled parents to seek mutual support and professional <br/>
help. Late last year in Saitama Prefecture alone, four separate groups of <br/>
parents joined together in mutual support organizations.<br/>
<br/>
Traditionally viewed as a domestic problem caused by poor parenting, <br/>
*hikikomori* has been neglected by the government and social service <br/>
organizations alike. While they are now finally starting to address the <br/>
problem, they have yet to come up with much in the way of effective <br/>
solutions or treatments.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is not a problem that can be solved by the family alone,&quot; said <br/>
Masahisa Okuyama, 55, one of the organizers of the August meeting, who, <br/>
along with his wife had been forced to move from their house into an <br/>
apartment 18 months earlier by the growing violence of their 25-year-old <br/>
son.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Even though we need support from public institutions, when parents seek <br/>
advice from public health offices, children&#39;s welfare agencies, hospitals <br/>
and police, they end up just getting the runaround, and find themselves <br/>
feeling isolated and exhausted,&quot; he said. &quot;We want the government to set <br/>
up facilities that we have access to and that we feel we can turn to for <br/>
help,&quot; he added.<br/>
<br/>
Takehiko Yoshikawa, the director of the mental health institute of the <br/>
National Center for Mental Health and Neurology, takes the crisis <br/>
seriously. He calls *hikikomori* &quot;a mental health problem that concerns <br/>
everyone,&quot; arguing that if it isn&#39;t addressed now, there will be dire <br/>
consequences in the future.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Perhaps the hijacking (of a bus by a 17-year-old boy from Saga <br/>
Prefecture last May) left a strong impression. There is a growing trend <br/>
to regard reclusive young people as future criminals,&quot; he said. &quot;This <br/>
perception is wrong and dangerous. *Hikikomori* is a national mental <br/>
health problem.&quot; The teenage hijacker had a history of reclusiveness.<br/>
<br/>
Psychiatrist Tamaki Saito, an expert on *hikikomori*, defines the <br/>
condition as young people who show no other signs of neurological or <br/>
psychiatric disorders, who shut themselves up at home and refuse to take <br/>
part in social activities for six months or more. The condition usually <br/>
starts with a refusal to go to school and often continues into the 20s or <br/>
30s. Afterward, sufferers may re-emerge into a normal adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
No one -- neither parents nor specialists nor the youths themselves -- <br/>
can explain the causes of *hikikomori* or how to recover from it. The <br/>
condition varies from case to case and there is no set cure. Some people <br/>
are able to return to society after spending time at private <br/>
institutions, while others react better to medication.<br/>
<br/>
A 21-year-old man who seems to have made a dramatic recovery from a few <br/>
years ago, recalled the period when he started to stay away from school.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One year in June when I was a third-year junior high school student, I <br/>
found myself simply unable to go to school,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
His inability to get up and go to school had been growing for about a <br/>
year. Even when he did force himself out of bed, it took him longer and <br/>
longer to leave the house.<br/>
<br/>
He lingered in the bathroom, spending 15 minutes washing his hands, and <br/>
up to three hours in the bath.<br/>
<br/>
Although he managed to graduate from junior high school and enter a <br/>
private senior high school, for the first 10 days, he was unable to <br/>
summon up the courage to attend.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, at the urging of his father, the boy saw a neurologist who <br/>
diagnosed him with an obsessive-compulsive disorder. His parents arranged <br/>
for him to enter a private institution in Chiba Prefecture for children <br/>
who refused to go to school. The boy left his parents&#39; home and moved <br/>
into an apartment.<br/>
<br/>
At the institution, the boy met other children who shared similar <br/>
problems. He found them easier to communicate with than his school peers. <br/>
No one thought his tendency to spend long periods in the bathroom was <br/>
strange. Gradually, his condition improved.<br/>
<br/>
A young man who shut himself up in his home for about six months during <br/>
his final year in junior high school tells a similar story.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I hardly remember anything from that time,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of things <br/>
seemed to be happening at once.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two and a half years ago, the 18-year-old boy moved from his home into a <br/>
dormitory run by a private organization to help troubled youth live <br/>
independently.<br/>
<br/>
He began to feel more comfortable in this environment, since the people <br/>
he met knew nothing about him. His confidence returned and a year later <br/>
he applied for a part-time job.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back on his more reclusive days, a 25-year-old college student in <br/>
the Kansai region who lives with his parents and younger brother, thinks <br/>
all he really wanted was for his parents to recognize and appreciate him.<br/>
<br/>
He says that, at the time, about once every two weeks he reacted <br/>
violently to trivial remarks by his mother by punching holes in the wall <br/>
and breaking furniture.<br/>
<br/>
For three years, until recently, the man rarely left his room, and <br/>
although he managed to enter college, he was unable to make friends or <br/>
work with others.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It was painful staying home all day doing nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;Even <br/>
though I wanted to go out, I couldn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eventually his parents advised him to see a psychiatrist, who prescribed <br/>
a course of medication. The man&#39;s condition improved and he returned to <br/>
college.<br/>
<br/>
Michizo Miki, a school counselor in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, who offers <br/>
counseling to the parents of troubled children says that an important <br/>
element of a successful outcome is simple listening.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When people come to me for advice, I give them a full and attentive <br/>
hearing,&quot; said Miki. &quot;But since the symptoms of the condition differ from <br/>
person to person, there is no set formula to deal with every case.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A 25-year-old man in Aichi Prefecture who has made giant strides in <br/>
recovering from *hikikomori* has begun writing to children with similar <br/>
problems. The names were supplied to him by a parents&#39; association.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why not get together with people who share the same problem,&quot; he wrote. <br/>
&quot;It might be helpful to meet older people who have overcome it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
None of the recipients of his letters has yet replied, but the man is <br/>
hopeful.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I know that in their hearts, every one of them wants to be understood by <br/>
others,&quot; he said.<br/>
