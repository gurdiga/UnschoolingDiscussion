<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590367235">This is your first weather lesson. If you don&#39;t get snow in your area<br/>
this might be worth sharing with your  children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here in  Fargo, ND we are getting bombarded with our first snow.<br/>
<br/>
The wind is blowing and by this a.m. we have at least 4 inches,<br/>
and its still coming.<br/>
<br/>
My white car was completely covered, it looked like a snow bank.<br/>
<br/>
My son dug out this snow pants, gloves and hat. He has been<br/>
shoveling for quite a while now. And has already had to come inside<br/>
and exchange wet gloves for new dry ones. He is talking about snowboarding<br/>
and skiing. He also likes to build snow forts in the yard.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, we don&#39;t see snow until after Halloween. The last few years,<br/>
the kids have trick-or treated in their costumes. The weather has been<br/>
fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
Once in awhile you can hear police sirens, as the roads are slippery<br/>
with ice and snow, and people in our area forget to practice slow cautious<br/>
driving. The radio indicates that there has been a few accidents, and<br/>
some cars in the ditches.<br/>

conditioner was on and the fan is quite loud.  Today the high is <br/>
expected to be 85, and I had to dig out some shorts I had put in <br/>
winter storage.  We went to the LEAF festival (awesome music and arts <br/>
fest - theleaf.com) at Black Mountain, NC last weekend and got <br/>
sunburned, and Seth was running nakedly with lots of similarly-<br/>
attired toddlers at the edge of the lake.  I&#39;m hungering to move from <br/>
Charlotte (WAY conservative town), but NC does have nice <br/>
advantages...if you like warm weather, that is!<br/>
