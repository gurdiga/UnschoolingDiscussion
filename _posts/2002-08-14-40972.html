&gt; &gt; After having done that, I don&#39;t think TJ would ever have considered <br/>
&gt; calling<br/>
&gt; &gt; himself a Christian<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Though he wasn&#39;t a Unitarian officially, Thomas Jefferson wrote somewhere<br/>
&gt; that he identified most closely with Joseph Priestly&#39;s Unitarian church. He<br/>
&gt; lived too far and the only church nearby was the Episcopalian one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last time I stumbled on Thomas Jefferson&#39;s like the Unitarian church I <br/>
&gt; found<br/>
&gt; some more polished entries, but these are interesting nonetheless:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary (1952) includes in the definition <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; Deist: &quot;One who believes in God but denies supernatural revelation.&quot; There<br/>
&gt; is no question Jefferson rejected the Bible as divine revelation and<br/>
&gt; rejected the divinity of Jesus. In the Declaration of Independence<br/>
&gt; Jefferson&#39;s appeal was to the God of the Deist, &quot;Nature&#39;s God,&quot; not<br/>
&gt; specifically to the God of Christianity (see letter dated Sep. 14, 1813, to<br/>
&gt; Jefferson from John Adams equating &quot;Nature&#39;s God&quot; with &quot;the revelation from<br/>
&gt; nature&quot;).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As President, Jefferson occasionally attended church services; but, he was<br/>
&gt; not a communing member of any Christian church. Further, he refused to<br/>
&gt; proclaim any national days of prayer or thanksgiving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jefferson says he was a &quot;Materialist&quot; (letter to Short, Apr. 13, 1820) and <br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &quot;Unitarian&quot; (letter to Waterhouse, Jan. 8, 1825). Jefferson rejected the<br/>
&gt; Christian doctrine of the &quot;Trinity&quot; (letter to Derieux, Jul. 25, 1788), as<br/>
&gt; well as the doctrine of an eternal Hell (letter to Van der Kemp, May 1,<br/>
&gt; 1817). Further, Jefferson specifically named Joseph Priestly (English<br/>
&gt; Unitarian who moved to America) and Conyers Middleton (English Deist) and<br/>
&gt; said: &quot;I rest on them ... as the basis of my own faith&quot; (letter to Adams,<br/>
&gt; Aug. 22, 1813). Therefore, without using the actual words, Jefferson issued<br/>
&gt; an authentic statement claiming Deism as his faith. The 1971 (ninth <br/>
&gt; edition)<br/>
&gt; Encyclopedia Britannica, 7:183, states the following: &quot;By the end of the<br/>
&gt; 18th century deism had become a dominant religious attitude among<br/>
&gt; upper-class Americans, and the first three presidents of the United States<br/>
&gt; held this conviction, as is amply evidenced in their correspondence.&quot;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Atheist! Infidel! Jacobin! Jefferson&#39;s political enemies were crucifying<br/>
&gt; him. It was the fall of 1799 and Vice President Jefferson was running for<br/>
&gt; President of the United States of America. One of his greatest political<br/>
&gt; opponents, the Federalist Alexander Hamilton, had set the tone of the<br/>
&gt; campaign by using the epithet &quot;atheist&quot;, among others, to label their great<br/>
&gt; antagonist, Thomas Jefferson.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One outraged cleric issued The Voice of Warning to Christians, on the<br/>
&gt; ensuing election of a President of the United States. He cried<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;This election is not a choice between individuals or policy, but is<br/>
&gt; infintely more, of national regard or disregard to the religion of Jesus<br/>
&gt; Chris. Will the people choose Jefferson, a confirmed infidel? Read in his<br/>
&gt; infamous publicatin Notes on Virginia, of his disbelief in the Deluge, in<br/>
&gt; his disbelief in the story of Adam and Eve, and of his statement that &#39;It<br/>
&gt; does me no injury for my neighbors to say there are twenty Gods or no God.&#39;<br/>
&gt; Christians, if you value eternity, vote against this infidel! By voting for<br/>
&gt; him, you will do more to destroy the Gospel of Jesus Christ than the rest <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; the whole fraternity of infidels with all their arts, their industry, and<br/>
&gt; their intrigues.&quot; <br/>
&gt; Another minister wrote, &quot;I do not believe that the Most High will permit a<br/>
&gt; howling atheist to site at the head of this nation.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A newspaper, the New England Palladium, was even worse. It thundered<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Should the infidel Jefferson be elected to the Presidency, the seal of<br/>
&gt; death will be on our holy religion, our churches will be prostrated, and<br/>
&gt; some infamous prostitute, under the title of the Goddess of Resaon, will<br/>
&gt; preside in our sanctuaries, which are now devoted to worship of our Most<br/>
&gt; High.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 I never knew this about Jefferson even though he is not one of my favorite <br/>
people.....<br/>
