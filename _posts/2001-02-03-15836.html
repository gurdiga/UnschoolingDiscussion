<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287738247">The point is having the choice.  Sandra is NOT saying everyone should have<br/>
an abortion. What she (and others who agree with her -- I&#39;m one of them) is<br/>
saying is everyone should have a CHOICE.  Adoption is another choice.  Why<br/>
should be limit our choices? When I have had the discussions with others in<br/>
the past, the folks that tout adoption seldom mention abortion as a viable<br/>
option.  This is a deeply personal decision and people really don&#39;t know how<br/>
they will feel until they face a particular situation.<br/>
<br/>
I have been faced with the decision twice in my marriage (I have 2 children<br/>
and had 3 pregnancies--one of the three was planned).  The first time I<br/>
decided not to have an abortion.  I was unsure that I was ready to bring a<br/>
child into the world  --- not really sure that I was mature enough at that<br/>
stage.  I made the decision to have her and she will be 20 on Monday.<br/>
Another I decided to terminate (abort).  The aborted fetus had an IUD<br/>
wrapped around it.  No one could have made those decisions for me and no one<br/>
had the right to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>

The point is that we really do get that.  The point is, for me and most of <br/>
those who are pro-life, that the unborn are ALIVE.  There is no choice for <br/>
them and that their life is as deserving of protection as yours or mine.  I <br/>
am in full support of procreative choice that does not include the taking of <br/>
a life.<br/>
<br/>
Either some of you are not hearing us or you cannot comprehend how we can <br/>
continue to oppose something you find so &quot;logical&quot;.  It is the taking of a <br/>
life and &quot;choice&quot; does not erase that for us.  No matter how vital you see <br/>
&quot;choice&quot; it does not sway us to believe that it is okay to take the life of <br/>
the unborn!<br/>

I&#39;ve stated it as many ways as I know how, without making this post as long <br/>

<br>No one said it was an easy choice. &nbsp;But sometimes people make choices that 
<br>are difficult and which you might not agree with and which are deeply 
<br>personal. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Very personally, to me, the viability of the fetus is a big issue. &nbsp;And as 
<br>medical science advances, viability comes earlier and earlier. &nbsp;So maybe that 
<br>line moves.
<br>
<br>OTOH, the fact that many young people are uninformed about birth control and 
<br>sex in general and are making these choices and mistakes and decisions at 
<br>relatively young, inexperienced ages, is disquieting to me.
<br>
<br>OTOH, I found it unsettling that I had to wait so far into my 2 pregnancies 
<br>to have the amnios done (I was over 35). &nbsp;It seemed to me that it was several 
<br>months into the pregnancies before they could even do the test. &nbsp;Both 
<br>children were healthy. &nbsp;But I knew and know now that I would have had 
<br>abortions if they had not been -- they were testing for Downs Syndrome and 
<br>whatever else that test shows. &nbsp;All these medical advances and yet these 
<br>tests were done so late -- seemed to me at the time anyway.
<br>
<br>These are deeply personal issues, obviously. &nbsp;With more than one or 2 or 3 
<br>sides or aspects to consider. &nbsp;These are very difficult decisions. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>The same people who can&#39;t figure out how to set up a decent education system 
<br>sure as heck don&#39;t need to be deciding what&#39;s going on in my uterus.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481901582">I do understand your position Kris.  And a few other women have written <br/>
eloquently as to why making Roe vs. Wade illegal would be a bad thing.  That <br/>
reason is because many (notice I said many, not all) of the people who call <br/>
themselves &quot;pro-life&quot; also do not believe in birth control.  Their only <br/>
&quot;prevention&quot; for abortion is abstinence.  They fight to keep education out <br/>
of the schools and they fight to close down Planned Parenthood&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
My problem with this is that not everyone in this country is raised with the <br/>
same morals or values.  Not everyone in this country believes that sex is a <br/>
sin and against the laws of God.  So, in order to have the choice whether or <br/>
not to engage in sexual behavior, the option and information of birth <br/>
control needs to be available.  Personally, I would rather see a woman use <br/>
birth control than have an abortion any day.  I would never have an abortion <br/>
myself, I did use birth control so that wouldn&#39;t have to be a choice I would <br/>
have to make.  And as someone else mentioned, sometimes that doesn&#39;t even <br/>
prevent the necessity for abortion.  I don&#39;t remember who mentioned having <br/>
to abort because of an IUD, but I applaud you for your honesty and thank you <br/>
for sharing your story.<br/>
<br/>
That is why I am pro-choice.  Until all women are educated and given access <br/>
to birth control, abortion needs to be safe and legal.<br/>
