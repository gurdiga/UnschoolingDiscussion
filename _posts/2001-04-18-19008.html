<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007222426">Yesterday was one of those days where I felt like we had a &quot;good&quot; unschooling day.  And it didn&#39;t require a special field trip or special materials...<br/>
<br/>
Emily had been running a fever for a couple of days, so we were going to take her to the doctor in the morning (we were suspecting a sinus infection).  But before we left, I remembered I had even forgotten to check her forehead... she felt cooler... took her temp and it was 98.,8.  She felt fine, so we canceled the appt. and decided we&#39;d go to piano lessons instead (we had had to cancel those for the dr. visit).  I wasn&#39;t able to reach her piano teacher before we left, so I left a message and forwarded calls to the cell phone in case she called back.  We hopped into the already warmed up car and made a stop at the post office on the way.  Usually, we drop Emily off for her hour-long lesson, while the other kids and I drive around or go shopping.  Since we were about 15-20 minutes late this time, we decided we&#39;d all stay.  Emily was very excited to show Miss Kate a new song she was composing (her teacher really encourages her composition).  Instead of a formal lesson, they spent the next 30 minutes or so transcribing Emily&#39;s music on staff paper.  <br/>
<br/>
After lessons, the kids were asking for French fries from McDonald&#39;s. I told Emily how much cash I had on me and she figured up whether I had enough to get some for everyone (not before asking if I could just use my credit card... LOL).  We came home and ate our fries, then she set to work cleaning her room and putting away her clean laundry.  At one point she came down and said, &quot;I&#39;ve been listening to &#39;NSYNC while I&#39;m working and do you know on one song they say the word &#39;love&#39; 37 times??&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The baby had been napping, but after he woke up and nursed, we went upstairs to finish helping Emily with her room.  We sorted out some clothes that were getting too small, and talked about a friend who was having a labor induction yesterday.  Talked about pitocin, oxytocin, contractions... Em was trying on a shirt to see if it was too small and remarked that she thought she would need a bra within a year...  I told her she might be right. <br/>
<br/>
Once her room was done, she came downstairs and watched some Animal Planet... waiting for her friend across the street (also homeschooled, but not unschooled) to finish school so she could come over.  I had some new software I got from UnbeatableDeals.com and called her in to see it.  We set up Mavis Beacon teaches typing and she did a few lessons, stopping after she had learned the home row and the letters &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;.  Her avg. speed was 11WPM.  Then she gave Gizmos and Gadgets a try for a while, until her dad got home from work.  Her friend showed up just as we were getting ready to go out to dinner, so we invited her along.  Ate at Golden Corral buffet, where the kids got to make their own choices and all did a good job of choosing.<br/>
<br/>
I realize I haven&#39;t mentioned the 5yo and 2yo much...  they spent most of the day playing different things..  puzzles, a matching game, etc.  They watched some tv, we read books together.  The 5yo noticed some dry skin where he had gotten a sunburn last week during our warm spell.  So we talked about why his skin was peeling there.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it... no earth-shattering observations, no special trips or deep mysteries of life solved... just a rather boringly normal day, but still a learning day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690535294">I love days like this. I woke up late today and found<br/>
the kids playing their Egyptian empire computer game,<br/>
which I&#39;ve mentioned here before because they&#39;re<br/>
currently obsessed with it. I said, &quot;Hey, you guys<br/>
didn&#39;t wake me up!&quot; Erik shouted in a really intense<br/>
voice, &quot;I&#39;m in the middle of a major civil war here,<br/>
Mama!&quot; He&#39;s still trying to control the uprising now.<br/>

I think these types of days are the best. With spring in the air here my boys <br/>
have been outside about nonstop. And who can blame them. They have been <br/>
hammering and sawing and I am always surprised with what they come up with. <br/>
Seems like there are always projects going on here. And I know there is <br/>
learning going on too. <br/>
Sounds like you and your children had a wonderful day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358281494">I only have one at home these days.  She looks after her own room, <br/>
tidies up the bathroom after she has used it, and generally cleans up <br/>
her mess.  I do the rest.  However when the mood takes dd will clean <br/>
the house and do the washing etc.  I appreciate these days because I <br/>
know she did it becuse SHE wanted to.  When i had 4 at home they each <br/>
had their own little job -= keeping their room tidy.  Dishes - <br/>
getting the milk - setting the table - clearing the table.<br/>
What do we do all day? For the past month or so my dd has been on <br/>
*Work experience* with her father...... They both love this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240292258">Well, I would tell them that if they didn&#39;t treat the<br/>
tools with respect, then they couldn&#39;t use them next<br/>
time. That if they&#39;re going to treat the good tools<br/>
like throwaway plastic toy tools, then they&#39;d have to<br/>
USE throwaway plastic toy tools. Kids need to learn to<br/>
care for their possessions, value them. There&#39;s so<br/>
much plastic junk out there that they may not be<br/>
realizing the difference between your husband&#39;s tools<br/>
and the latest happy meal toy. In our family, we had<br/>
this problem with books. The kids had to learn to<br/>
respect the books. We did this by making them pay<br/>
their own library book repair fees, and not buying new<br/>
books if they destroyed the old ones, but letting them<br/>
keep the repaired ones. They were not only leaving<br/>
books on the floor to get stepped on, but also<br/>
bringing books into the bathtub, out in the yard, etc.<br/>
Now they take better care of books. Mostly. :) Juli<br/>

<div><font face="Pooh">Ask them to help build a place for each tool, like maybe a 
carry box that they can put all the tools in when done and even if not in the 
house, they can put it in the garage or fort prior to coming inside the house. 
As to the mess in the backyard, remind hubby that creativity flows everywhere 
and when the kids get tired of tripping over their messes they will clean 
up...or if its time for dad to mow the lawn, they can go out and clean up their 
messes or watch their messes get chewed up by the lawnmower and pay for the new 
lawnmower blades if they get broken. We had to go out about an hour ahead of dad 
if he said today is lawn mowing day...ack! I remember we hadda sorta rush around 
putting all our stuff on the back patio and that included cleaning up dog poop!

Or a parent could use the tools *with* the child, and demonstrate how to
put them away.&nbsp; Oftentimes children are not shown how to care for
something.&nbsp; They are just told to put them away.&nbsp; Maybe the parent
and child could do an experiment with a less expensive tool...they could
watch what happens to it when it rains, is left to the dogs, is run over
by a car, etc.&nbsp; Parent and child could talk a lot about the benefits
of caring for belongings.&nbsp; They could do an experiment with another
tool.&nbsp; They could see what happens when it is taken really good care
of.&nbsp; They could clean it every time it is used, wrap it in a soft
cloth, and put it in a special shoe box in a safe corner of the garage
or a bedroom.&nbsp; Parent and child could talk about the difference in
the tools.

Sometimes, I lose something or leave it in the rain, and it makes me sad.&nbsp;
I feel foolish when I forget something like this.&nbsp; I still go buy
a new one if I need it.&nbsp; I remind myself to care for the next one.&nbsp;
If a child loses something valuable to them, I think it shows a lot of
respect to help them recover the item.&nbsp; Maybe searching at garage
sales, thrift stores, etc.

where they are free to treat their *own* belongings in a way that is appropriate
for them?&nbsp; They can leave their toys out, play with them, return to
find them right where they left them.&nbsp; They might find that they like
it when they clean it themselves, or they might find it suits them to have
one spot that is their own to keep messy.

I have a love of books, too.&nbsp; I like it when they are respected.&nbsp;
I think if my child was showing this type of anger or sadness, I would
offer a pillow to kick, an animal to throw, an old plate to smash safely,

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are not projects, I let my kids keep train sets,<br/>
block castles, blanket forts, and other things of that<br/>
nature up for days on end.  My older son, Thomas, does<br/>
not get involved in elaborate, multi-stage projects<br/>
though.  The train sets and other constructions are<br/>
usually his little brother&#39;s.  Thomas often spends<br/>
time involved talking to and with his toys in<br/>
imaginary scenarios, but these are very portable.  He<br/>
is hyperactive and lacks even the patience to do a<br/>
simple board puzzle.  It is something we are working<br/>
on.  Thomas is extremely intelligent and articulate,<br/>
but high strung, emotional and hyper.  <br/>
<br/>
What I was referring to is that when he is looking for<br/>
an item, in a toy chest or bin, he usually<br/>
dumps/empties the entire contents onto the floor to<br/>
find the one or two items he is interested in, and<br/>
then walks away and leaves the pile.  Some days he<br/>
will do this with almost every container in his room,<br/>
creating a huge chaos of people and animal figures,<br/>
vehicles, gadgets, blocks, beanies and bric-a-brac.  <br/>
<br/>
We leave it for while to see if he shows any interest<br/>
in picking up, but these are not piles that he plays<br/>
with.  He retrieves what he wants and is done with<br/>
them.  We gently remind, we ask, we show, we offer to<br/>
help.  Often we have to take his chin and reiterate<br/>
several times while he is watching us speak, what it<br/>
is that he is expected to do, in clear simple terms. <br/>
We line his bins up on the floor, one for people, one<br/>
for animals, etc, with pictures on the front to show<br/>
what goes in each.  We ask him to &quot;Pick up all the<br/>
animals please&quot; and we assist some and help get him<br/>
back on track when he strays from task (which is<br/>
often).<br/>
<br/>
However his response to this is occassionally to fall<br/>
onto the floor and scream &quot;uh-uh!!  No!&quot;  When no<br/>
amount of coaxing or insisting will get him involved<br/>
(we do not threaten or bribe) then we are forced to<br/>
take other actions to save the floor, our sanity,<br/>
prevent injury and prevent destruction of all the<br/>
toys.  We warm him what will happen if we have to pick<br/>
them up ourselves, when he has made the mess.  Some<br/>
days he just does not care.  In those cases, we pick<br/>
up for him, but the toys go into time out for a while.<br/>
<br/>
We have elimated clutter by organizing his toys, taken<br/>
out extra messy items to his non-hyper brother&#39;s room,<br/>
and made his room as simple as possible in terms of<br/>
cleaning/mess/stimulation.  He has six small bins (two<br/>
sets of three pull out drawers), one small table top<br/>
bin with coloring books and puzzles, one medium bin<br/>
with a lid for beanies, one small toy chest for<br/>
miscellaneous larger items, a toy castle and pirate<br/>
ship, a large magnadoodle, and a couple of other<br/>
items.  That is all that is in his room aside from his<br/>
bed, and a play table with two chairs and a few things<br/>
on the upper closet shelf.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;He used to have the kids&#39; book<br/>
&gt;&gt;collection in his room, but whenever he got mad, he<br/>
&gt;&gt;would sweep clear the shelves into a big pile and<br/>
&gt;&gt;refuse to pick them up later<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I think if my &gt;child was showing this type of anger<br/>
 </span></blockquote>or sadness, I &gt;would offer a pillow to kick, an animal<br/>
to throw, an &gt;old plate to smash safely, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your concern, but we have been to family<br/>
therapy, play therapy and parenting classes.  He has a<br/>
number of options that are allowed for expressing his<br/>
anger/frustration, and is encouraged to use his very<br/>
extensive vocabulary to explain his feelings.  The<br/>
dumping of the books was engineered to garner a<br/>
satifyingly (to him) reaction from mom and dad, who do<br/>
not like books mishandled, no matter how we try to<br/>
remain calm about it.  Removing them to his brother&#39;s<br/>
room has solved that problem.<br/>
