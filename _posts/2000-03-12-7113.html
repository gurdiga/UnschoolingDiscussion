<div id="ygrps-yiv-545746338">Welcome to the list, Carli!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what we do:<br/>
<br/>
The other day, Mook (3yods) asked me, &quot;Mom, why does the earth spin?&quot;  I<br/>
have no idea where he learned that the earth spins.  So I explained to<br/>
him about day and night, and we made a model of the solar system with<br/>
mandarin oranges and a table lamp (shade removed).  We found some great<br/>
websites, and now he knows so much about the solar system.  Though we do<br/>
some simple role playing sometimes (usually after he&#39;s had some trouble<br/>
with his friends), I don&#39;t teach him much except by example.  Mostly he<br/>
teaches himself.  If he has a question, I answer, and sometimes he wants<br/>
more info.  So we go look it up together.  &quot;What does this word say?&quot;<br/>
has become the phrase of the month.  (his, not mine)<br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like what you&#39;re doing is unschooling - you don&#39;t need<br/>
our approval, anywho.  Helping your children follow their interests is,<br/>
IMO, unschooling.  Sometimes I expand on Mook&#39;s interests a little.  Say<br/>
for example, Pokemon.  (Mook couldn&#39;t care less about pokemon, but I<br/>
hear it&#39;s really big everywhere - not just in Japan)  Pokemon comes from<br/>
Japan, so you could learn related stuff about Japan.  Like, the Japanese<br/>
pronounce Pokemon poh*keh*moh*ng (and anime is pronounced ah*nee*meh),<br/>
etc.  Maybe they&#39;ll want to know other Japanese words, so you search the<br/>
internet, or get a tape from the library, and before you know it,<br/>
they&#39;re learning Japanese.  Or history, or math, or who knows what<br/>
else.  It&#39;s amazing how one thing leads to another.  Just by following<br/>
their interests.  Sometimes something just dies out.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not worrying about what you &quot;should&quot; be doing.  Just<br/>
learning in a way that works for you and the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!  <br/>
