<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for your response to my long post, Renee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When you go looking for a self-healing circle, please be sure you look for<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; place that allows for full expression of all emotions, especially the<br/>
&gt; so-called negative ones (rage, sadness, etc). I am not talking about a<br/>
&gt; circle of people sitting around talking about how they feel or what they<br/>
&gt; have experienced, but rather people actually feeling and fully expressing<br/>
&gt; their feelings. This can be done without blaming someone else for our<br/>
&gt; feelings. Sometimes if a person just can&#39;t seem to get past blaming we set<br/>
&gt; up what we call a &#39;container&#39;. Then the person can vent and rage and blame<br/>
&gt; until they are finished, without anyone interrupting at all. Then the<br/>
&gt; process of &#39;cleaning up&#39; needs to happen, especially if the intensity is<br/>
&gt; between two people within the circle, say a husband and wife. We need to<br/>
&gt; sometimes be allowed to just vent, but the person receiving the &#39;vent&#39;<br/>
needs<br/>
&gt; to have enough substance to NOT TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OTHER<br/>
&gt; PERSON&#39;S FEELINGS (not take things personally).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Say a wife really needs to express some strong anger at her husband,<br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; quite know how to do it without sounding like she is blaming him, she can<br/>
&gt; ask him to be a container for her. If he feels strong enough to handle her<br/>
&gt; rage without taking it on and then getting defensive - great. If he<br/>
doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; feel strong enough to do that, the wife may have to pick someone else  to<br/>
&gt; take his place and he may be present as witness. In the end, whatever the<br/>
&gt; wife is feeling towards her husband has at the core very little to do with<br/>
&gt; her husband, but most likely originated within her own first family. The<br/>
&gt; purpose of circle is to get to the core of things and deal with them at<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have come to believe that we choose our partners and draw out of our<br/>
&gt; partners the very things we need to heal in ourselves the most. That to me<br/>
&gt; is the main purpose for intimate relationships. The more intimate you get,<br/>
&gt; the greater the potential for healing for both partners.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have trouble finding a self-healing circle where you are I could<br/>
give<br/>
&gt; you some more info about exactly what we do and the tools we use and maybe<br/>
&gt; you could start your own self-healing circle. To begin with here is a<br/>
&gt; sample:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BEING IN CIRCLE by Sedonia Camu and Joshua Halpen<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Angeles Arrien says that we need to do four things to make our lives work<br/>
&gt; and they apply to being authentic in the circle as       She says we must<br/>
&gt; show up, pay attention, tell the truth, and not be attached to the<br/>
outcome.<br/>
&gt; A circling community allows many opportunities to practice these skills by<br/>
&gt; teaching us to be fully present, to pay attention to our deepest impulses<br/>
&gt; and to be alert and aware of others. We learn to tell the truth so that we<br/>
&gt; can be deeply known just as we are while discovering more about our-<br/>
selves.<br/>
&gt; Our commitment needs to be so great to these principles that we do them<br/>
&gt; regardless of the outcome. This means that we &quot;give away&quot; from the very<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; of ourselves. What makes a circle safe for practising this radically<br/>
&gt; authentic behaviour, for going through public transformation is the unique<br/>
&gt; quality that arises when there is harmony between the personal and the<br/>
&gt; transpersonal.<br/>
&gt; This state of awareness, contained within a circle, generates an energy<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; cannot come from any other place. This is what has been called in -many<br/>
&gt; traditions &quot;the Witness&quot;. To be an effective witness requires that we pay<br/>
&gt; attention, not project, interpret, judge, or try to &quot;Fix&quot; the other. There<br/>
&gt; is no room for interference in another&#39;s process. The witness is asked to<br/>
&gt; sit in his or her own circle of Power, pay attention, take responsibility<br/>
&gt; for what he or she is feeling, and not project his or her experience onto<br/>
&gt; the other. The only way to really see someone else is to fully own our<br/>
&gt; emotions, feelings, and thoughts.<br/>
&gt; The need to be really seen is as great as the need for food and shelter,<br/>
yet<br/>
&gt; most of us go though life starving for reflection. We al I need to be seen<br/>
&gt; with eyes filled with love, acceptance, and adoration. There is terrible<br/>
&gt; loneliness and alienation when we feel no one sees, hears, or understands<br/>
&gt; us. This loneliness lingers in circles unless the quality of witnessing is<br/>
&gt; present.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes as part of witnessing, people go through a stage in which they<br/>
&gt; seem to know what they are feeling and they take the certainty that<br/>
affords<br/>
&gt; them and assume they know what others are feeling. This is not witnessing.<br/>
&gt; For instance, sometimes when people feel afraid of another&#39;s pain they<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; immediately reach out to hug or stroke them, which stops the process, or<br/>
&gt; they might come up with a solution to the other person&#39;s dilemma or<br/>
discount<br/>
&gt; the other&#39;s feelings by saying it&#39;s not really so bad.<br/>
&gt; All these are the reactions of someone who is afraid of his or her own<br/>
pain,<br/>
&gt; or someone who is not being in circle.<br/>
&gt; Learning how to witness is essential because we live in a time when great<br/>
&gt; numbers of people am beginning to tell their truths. Some of these truths<br/>
&gt; are hard to hear, some involve terrible childhood abuse and betrayal, yet<br/>
&gt; they must be told and heard. When they are not heard properly the telling<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; undermined and damage, rather than healing, may result. It can take a long<br/>
&gt; time to regain the courage to tell the story again.<br/>
&gt; In the circle process, when people sit and speak from the deepest part of<br/>
&gt; themselves, no matter how wounded, how much anguish or how many tears,<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; then, at that moment, are sitting in their circle of power. They need to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; witnessed, that is, to be respected for their willingness to go so deep<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; be so vulnerable. What is required of us as witnesses is to sit in our own<br/>
&gt; circle of power, owning our own pain and fear, fully being with those<br/>
&gt; feelings and not projecting them outward.<br/>
&gt; Our stories need to be heard, not fixed. Nobody needs fixing, we are not<br/>
&gt; machines. All we need is to be heard. We need someone else to know- how<br/>
hard<br/>
&gt; it was, to know, that we have survived with dignity and that we are not<br/>
&gt; afraid to feel. We as human beings need more than any- thing else to be<br/>
&gt; seen, known, felt, accepted, and loved.<br/>
&gt; When people are real in the circle we love them for their process of<br/>
&gt; becoming whole. We love each other for being who we are, with all our<br/>
&gt; perfections and imperfections. The essence of the process is to validate<br/>
&gt; that we are living, breathing, dancing, real people who feel pain and fear<br/>
&gt; and make mistakes, while living and caring about each other. The circle<br/>
form<br/>
&gt; creates a place for everyone to work, pray, be real and feel at one with<br/>
&gt; each other, all together.<br/>
&gt; Being in a circle teaches us to respect ourselves and one another. When<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; happens we are brought into an experience of immanence and sacredness,<br/>
&gt; making us better able to honour the beauty and integrity of the earth. If<br/>
&gt; enough people gather in circle and grapple with their identities within<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; context, it enhances the possibilities for us all. Creative group dynamic<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; essential if we are going to mobilize healing and create an ecological<br/>
&gt; environment for ourselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me know how it goes. There are a lot more books that I would<br/>
recommend,<br/>
&gt; such as &quot;Getting The Love You Want&quot; or &quot;Conscious Loving&quot;, and others. If<br/>
&gt; you want I will send you a list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the best,<br/>
&gt; Nicoletta<br/>
