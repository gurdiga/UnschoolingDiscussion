&gt; A letter to the London Observer newspaper from Terry Jones (of Monty <br/>
&gt; Python fame).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Letters<br/>
&gt; Sunday January 26, 2003<br/>
&gt; The Observer<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m really excited by George Bush&#39;s latest reason for bombing Iraq: <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s running out of patience. And so am I! For some time now I&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; really pissed off with Mr Johnson, who lives a couple of doors down <br/>
&gt; the street. Well, him and Mr Patel, who runs the health food shop. <br/>
&gt; They both give me queer looks, and I&#39;m sure Mr Johnson is planning <br/>
&gt; something nasty for me, but so far I haven&#39;t been able to discover <br/>
&gt; what. I&#39;ve been round to his place a few times to see what he&#39;s up to, <br/>
&gt; but he&#39;s got everything well hidden. That&#39;s how devious he is. As for <br/>
&gt; Mr Patel, don&#39;t ask me how I know, I just know - from very good <br/>
&gt; sources - that he is, in reality, a Mass Murderer. I have leafleted <br/>
&gt; the street telling them that: if we don&#39;t act first, he&#39;ll pick us off <br/>
&gt; one by one. Some of my neighbours say, if I&#39;ve got proof, why don&#39;t I <br/>
&gt; go to the police? But that&#39;s simply ridiculous. The police will say <br/>
&gt; that they need evidence of a crime with which to charge my neighbours. <br/>
&gt; They&#39;ll come up with endless red tape and quibbling about the rights <br/>
&gt; and wrongs of a pre-emptive strike and all the while Mr Johnson will <br/>
&gt; be finalising his plans to do terrible things to me, while Mr Patel <br/>
&gt; will be secretly murdering people Since I&#39;m the only one in the street <br/>
&gt; with a decent range of automatic firearms, I reckon it&#39;s up to me to <br/>
&gt; keep the peace. But until recently that&#39;s been a little difficult. <br/>
&gt; Now, however, George W. Bush has made it clear that all I need to do <br/>
&gt; is run out of patience, and then I can wade in and do whatever I want! <br/>
&gt; And let&#39;s face it, Mr Bush&#39;s carefully thought-out policy towards Iraq <br/>
&gt; is the only way to bring about international peace and security. The <br/>
&gt; one certain way to stop Muslim fundamentalist suicide bombers <br/>
&gt; targeting the US or the UK is to bomb a few Muslim countries that have <br/>
&gt; never threatened us. That&#39;s why I want to blow up Mr Johnson&#39;s garage <br/>
&gt; and kill his wife and children. Strike first! That&#39;ll teach him a <br/>
&gt; lesson. Then he&#39;ll leave us in peace and stop peering at me in that <br/>
&gt; totally unacceptable way. Mr Bush makes it clear that all he needs to <br/>
&gt; know before bombing Iraq is that Saddam is a really nasty man and that <br/>
&gt; he has weapons of mass destruction - even if no one can find them. I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; certain I&#39;ve just a s much justification for killing Mr Johnson&#39;s wife <br/>
&gt; and children as Mr Bush has for bombing Iraq. Mr Bush&#39;s long-term aim <br/>
&gt; is to make the world a safer place by eliminating &#39;rogue states&#39; and <br/>
&gt; &#39;terrorism&#39;. It&#39;s such a clever long-term aim because how can you ever <br/>
&gt; know when you&#39;ve achieved it? How will Mr Bush know when he&#39;s wiped <br/>
&gt; out all terrorists? When every single terrorist is dead? But then a <br/>
&gt; terrorist is only a terrorist once he&#39;s committed an act of terror. <br/>
&gt; What about would-be terrorists? These are the ones you really want to <br/>
&gt; eliminate, since most of the known terrorists, being suicide bombers, <br/>
&gt; have already eliminated themselves. Perhaps Mr Bush needs to wipe out <br/>
&gt; everyone who could possibly be a future terrorist? Maybe he can&#39;t be <br/>
&gt; sure he&#39;s achieved his objective until every Muslim fundamentalist is <br/>
&gt; dead? But then some moderate Muslims might convert to fundamentalism. <br/>
&gt; Maybe the only really safe thing to do would be for Mr Bush to <br/>
&gt; eliminate all Muslims? It&#39;s the same in my street. Mr Johnson and Mr <br/>
&gt; Patel a re just the tip of the iceberg. There are dozens of other <br/>
&gt; people in the street who I don&#39;t like and who - quite frankly - look <br/>
&gt; at me in odd ways. No one will be really safe until I&#39;ve wiped them <br/>
&gt; all out. My wife says I might be going too far but I tell her I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; simply using the same logic as the President of the United States. <br/>
&gt; That shuts her up. Like Mr Bush, I&#39;ve run out of patience, and if <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s a good enough reason for the President, it&#39;s good enough for <br/>
&gt; me. I&#39;m going to give the whole street two weeks - no, 10 days - to <br/>
&gt; come out in the open and hand over all aliens and interplanetary <br/>
&gt; hijackers, galactic outlaws and interstellar terrorist masterminds, <br/>
&gt; and if they don&#39;t hand them over nicely and say &#39;Thank you&#39;, I&#39;m going <br/>
&gt; to bomb the entire street to kingdom come. It&#39;s just as sane as what <br/>
&gt; George W. Bush is proposing - and, in contrast to what he&#39;s intending, <br/>
&gt; my policy will destroy only one street. Sincerely, Terry Jones<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506080665">Let&#39;s do our best not to bring up the subject of Iraq. There are families<br/>
here with loved ones who could be involved and the subject is a painful one<br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
