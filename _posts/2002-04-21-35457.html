<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540152309">&lt;&lt;Attacking other peoples posts and comments is in no way productive to<br/>
this<br/>
list.  Do you hold a position that I am not aware of on this list that<br/>
makes<br/>
it necessary for you to decide who has the right to say what and what is<br/>
or<br/>
is not allowed to be said?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thank God for the folks who were bold enough to tell me &quot;that&#39;s not<br/>
unschooling&quot;!  For unschooling to work there has to be a leap of faith<br/>
and it&#39;s all about trusting your child/ren to learn.  When I first<br/>
studied unschooling my gut told me it was true but I clung to my &quot;school&quot;<br/>
mentality.  Until I let go completely I didn&#39;t see it work, since I did I<br/>
know that I know it happens.<br/>
<br/>
Folks, like Sandra, who held up the standard in spite of the torpedos<br/>
gave me a vision to focus on.  I could have wasted time with lashing out<br/>
(I probably did) but listening and being slow to defend myself got me<br/>
much further.<br/>
<br/>
Much time and opportunity is wasted by multiple posts which attack<br/>
responding posters.  There will always be the faithful few who don&#39;t<br/>
compromise and are willing to stick their necks out.  Either ignore their<br/>
posts or garner the benefits.<br/>
