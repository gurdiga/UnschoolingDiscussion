Just a public service announcement: <br/>
<br/>
    Let us remember that there are ENORMOUS distinctions between <br/>
&quot;Fundamentalist Christians&quot; (specifically) and &quot;Christians&quot; (generally).  I <br/>
would wager to say that we of the &quot;general variety&quot; greatly outnumber those <br/>
of the &quot;fundamentalist variety&quot;, and thus the latter variety (fundamentalist <br/>
Christians) is most DEFINITELY a subset (and not a defining subset, at that <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) of the former. <br/>
<br/>
   Thank you and I will now return to my regular semi-lurking behavior. :-)<br/>

I&#39;m wondering what kind of book store you have in your home. I love this idea. Do you make any money?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952420360">&lt;&lt;My son would love a book of spells&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She ordered it from &quot;The Pyramid Collection&quot; catalog.  It is called the<br/>
&quot;Book of Good Spells&quot; or something along that line.  It is gypsy spells and<br/>
kind of fun.  I have also seen books of spells at Barnes and Noble.<br/>
