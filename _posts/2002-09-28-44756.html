To me that&#39;s like another thread here about rape and molestation.  I have<br/>
lived through it, and I would NOT want to see other people suffer, just<br/>
because I had to.  Pain does not make you stronger, it makes you hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I love your stories about your kids.  I was reading the Homeschooling Book<br/>
of Answers (which Army interlibrary loan just found for me....3 months<br/>
later!) and had to smile at the pictures of the youngest two kids Linda<br/>
Dobson had comments from...Marty and Kirby Dodd at 8 and 11.  Bet they&#39;ve<br/>
grown a lot since then!<br/>
