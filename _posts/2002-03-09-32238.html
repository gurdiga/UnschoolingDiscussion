<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445531957">Just received this from another group.  Looks like there is going to be a long weekend.  Wonder how long it will be after that before mail is back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, thoroughly sick of all the Yahoo maintenance and down times and thinking Topica and SmartGroups are looking better all the time!<br/>

Yahoo Groups will be down from March 15th until March 18th<br/>
for more maintenance! So in light of this news, next weekend<br/>
will be rather quiet to say the very least! Normal service is set to resume March 18th Late..... Please pass this news on to as<br/>
many people as you know that use Yahoo Groups <br/>
