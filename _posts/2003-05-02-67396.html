&gt; are rated G.. But some of them are VERY scary for kids.  If they were <br/>
&gt; &quot;rea;&quot; <br/>
&gt; people, I know they would be rated PG for PG-13.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>

 Just out of curiosity, I did a search on Disney movie rating.  I went to &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/&quot;">http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/&lt;/A">http://disneyvideos.disney.go.com/&lt;/A</a>&gt;.. Searched the A-Z movie listings for <br/>
Rated G  Rated PG and Rated PG 13.. Here are the results<br/>
<br/>
483 rated G<br/>
180 rated PG <br/>
3 rated PG 13<br/>
<br/>
These are not &quot;currently playing&quot; movies.. Just available videos and DVDs. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I know things have gotten  a bit more &quot;drastic&quot; in the last few years.  <br/>
.. Although, Peter Pan and Captain Hook DID sword fight.. And there were <br/>
bombs and man eating alligators too.. lol.. I remeber that Malificent , the <br/>
evil queen in Sleeping Beauty, was very very scary to Landon.  Esp the part <br/>
where she turns into a Dragon.  He was scared of her, but he sort of idolized <br/>
her too because she was so powerful.  He would dress up like Malificent and <br/>
act out the movie.  McLeach in Rescuers Down Under was a horrible cruel man <br/>
too... those Disney villians, *shudder.... And folks think Harry Potter is <br/>
bad..lol<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632123772">How about Bambi? His mother dies; there&#39;s a very artistically done <br/>
fire scene with crashing limbs and burning and injury.<br/>
<br/>
But think about good ole fashioned fairy tales...there&#39;s plenty of <br/>
ugly, scary imagery in Grimm and Anderson, and even milder fairy <br/>
tales that don&#39;t have gore in them, have estrangement in families or <br/>
abuse from a parent to a child or from sibling to sibling or the <br/>
death of a beloved father...<br/>
<br/>
When a Christian ministry came out a few years ago (after &quot;Aladdin&quot; <br/>
appeared on the screen) with a &quot;Where are all the mothers? Disney <br/>
always leaves the mothers out of their movies.&quot; Hello? Cinderella <br/>
DIDN&#39;T HAVE A MOTHER in the original fairy tale, you DOLTS! Neither <br/>
did Snow White or Pinnochio, and Briar Rose was raised by someone <br/>
other than her mother, and the list goes on and on and on and on. <br/>
Trying to make our world more...pure? safe? emotionally <br/>
stable?......As if this generation had a monopoly on wickedness and <br/>
scariness! urg.<br/>
<br/>
That incident is what caused me to finally give up on trying to <br/>
monitor our movie viewing from ANYONE outside my own circle of <br/>
friends and family. I know what to ask friends, and they know what <br/>
our kids are able to handle.<br/>
<br/>
peace, heidi<br/>
