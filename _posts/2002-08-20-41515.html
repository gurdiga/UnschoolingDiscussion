<div id="ygrps-yiv-202886300">I find that a yearly carpet cleaning by a professional carpet cleaner <br/>
is a good investment.  Make sure the carpet cleaners you hire have a <br/>
truck-mounted system because they clean the best.  They have gotten <br/>
all kinds of stuff out of our carpets and furniture!<br/>

our poor carpeting!  I got it at Home Depot, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s probably <br/>

I don&#39;t remember the name of it either, but I&#39;m pretty sure it was Karin who <br/>
recommended it. She&#39;s on vacation this week, but we can ask her when she <br/>
gets back.<br/>

give you the name of that cleaner found at Walmart.  It&#39;s called KrudKutter.<br/>

I used this stuff  - what is it? - Oh yeah, Oxiclean.  Got it at<br/>
Walmart.  It takes out blueberries, grapejuice, old pet stains, paint in<br/>
the carpet stains, all kinds of stains.  And it really works (I&#39;m told<br/>
it&#39;s sold on tv too, so now I&#39;m an infomercial)  But it really does<br/>
work!  And it&#39;s not very expensive.<br/>

stain.  She thought it wasn&#39;t doing anything, then the next time she looked <br/>
she couldn&#39;t find the stain.  From the Oxy part, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s got <br/>
hydrogen peroxide or something similar in it.<br/>

: My daughter used Oxyclean, or something like that to clean up a grape<br/>
juice<br/>
: stain.<br/>
<br/>
Oxyclean is my best best best cleaning friend.<br/>
<br/>
We have one of those old white sinks that turns the color of anything that<br/>
gets dumped in it (coffee, juice, spaghetti sauce)....the sink was<br/>
discussing when I first moved in here, and after trying to clean it for<br/>
months with everything I could think of...I tried oxyclean and it was bright<br/>
white after I left it sit on there for 30 minutes or so. now once a week I<br/>
use it and leave it sit for 5 minutes or so and it stays white.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have one of those lanyards on my keys, and I always wear my keys<br/>
around my neck.  I would wash it once a week but it never turned white....I<br/>
soaked it in oxyclean for about 20 minutes and it looked brandnew (the<br/>
purple stayed purple and the white turned white).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used it on hand-me-down baby clothes that I received with stains on<br/>
them...before passing them to the next person the stains were gone.<br/>
<br/>
Great stuff.<br/>
