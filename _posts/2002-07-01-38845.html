  &lt;snip&gt;Of course, dh is thinking all we need is one more thing about our<br/>
  family to<br/>
  &gt; have to explain to people, as if being an unschooling, semi-homesteading,<br/>
  &gt; mixed race, adoptive family isn&#39;t enough.<br/>
<br/>
  You won&#39;t have to explain it to anyone at the church.  I still look up the<br/>
  sermons on the website because we just can&#39;t find another UU church like it<br/>
  up here.  My kids even liked it there and that is saying a lot.<br/>
