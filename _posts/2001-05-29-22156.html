 My problem right now is that I&#39;m physically unable to sit at a sewing<br/>
 machine long enough to create the quilt top or even cut out the pieces!  I&#39;m<br/>
 on the look out for some great pictures in outline or quilting designs I<br/>
 like well enough to have BE the quilt design.  Then I&#39;ll just put the top,<br/>
 bottom and batting together and enjoy the quilting process (If I don&#39;t<br/>
 expect to accomplish it quickly I can do the quilting part). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I saw a beautiful quilt like this at the Iowa State Fair one year, and it <br/>
had won &quot;best of show&quot;, too:  pure white fabric with extraordinarily <br/>
intricate quilting in white thread. Minimal, but breathtaking..... :-)<br/>

Perhaps if you try something small, like receiveing<br/>
blanket sized quilt that is hand quilted.  Or maybe a<br/>
tiny comforter? Or hand applique&#39;? On any small sized<br/>
project.  Not necessarily for any purpose, but just to<br/>
make.  Art doesn&#39;t have to have a reason.<br/>
<br/>
Prayers for you to have more stamina<br/>
