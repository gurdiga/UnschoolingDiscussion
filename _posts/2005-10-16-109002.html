<br/>
<br/>
  You need to sit down and talk about this and keep talking about it and NOT with an eye towards winning but with a willingness to compromise. Make it clear why you want to unschool and give him some articles and stuff to read but keep in mind and let him know that this is not to convince him, but to help him understand why it&#39;s important to you. Then ask what he thinks are important issues surrounding homeschooling and parenting and take his concerns seriously. Then you guys need to work out some compromises. My DH just won&#39;t go for no bedtimes. So we have a &#39;quiet time&#39; where my kids can go to their room by a certain time and read or play in bed until they&#39;re ready for sleep. That covers his need for time alone and with me and leaves the kids in control of their sleep. Not ideal but it works reasonably well for now. And down the road, who knows? He&#39;s loosened up on a LOT in the two years we&#39;ve been unschooling and really enjoys a lot of the perks now.<br/>
<br/>
  Back up, take a breath and regroup. If your prime concern is for your kids then your desire to unschool should NOT be threatening your marriage. If it&#39;s a good and healthy relationship then it would just be cruel to your children to break it up over this. You&#39;re in a partnership. You guys HAVE to negotiate this stuff. You have to listen to his concerns respectfully and help shape some compromises that will address both of your concens. And you won&#39;t get to lift limits and all that right away. It just won&#39;t happen if he&#39;s as opposed as it seems. But take smaller steps. Give him time. Remember, I&#39;m two years in and bedtimes are still something we have to compromise on. Slow down.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you let go of it.  There are so many spouses<br/>
who won&#39;t have their children unschool *at all*. <br/>
Yours is at least willing to let them unschool their<br/>
learning.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband wasn&#39;t totally thrilled about the whole<br/>
unschooling idea at first.  We really slowly eased<br/>
into it.  The unschooling of their learning happened<br/>
first and then over time, controls on food, TV, video<br/>
games, etc. happened.  For us, it happened gradually. <br/>
I would share emails from this list and other info<br/>
with him on occasion.  And somehow, he has progressed<br/>
into an dad who truly believes in unschooling.  I<br/>
think it is because I let him be, that I didn&#39;t create<br/>
a huge issue about it all.  We didn&#39;t fight about it,<br/>
we didn&#39;t have any major discussions about it.  It<br/>
just happened.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was the same with us.  Also, once you start questioning the why <br/>
of things, your kids will follow.  Kids are really good at <br/>
questioning &quot;why&quot;, but in traditional settings, that type of <br/>
questioning is frowned upon,(and honored in inspirational posters at <br/>
the same time).  When dad was saying &quot;no&quot; and not letting go of <br/>
bedtimes and such, my dd would get so frustrated and ask me why.  I <br/>
just started directing her to her dad, so that he could answer those <br/>
questions for himself.  <br/>
<br/>
Your kids will question their father if he doesn&#39;t let go.  All kids <br/>
question things they think are unfair.  So, let it go and direct <br/>
their questions to the person setting up the &quot;rules&quot;.  Don&#39;t do the <br/>
united front thing.  Let them question and let them know your <br/>
answers honestly.</div>

<br/>
Yes, that is such a dumb idea - that the children must never see the parents disagree on anything.  They can learn a lot by seeing their parents have respectful discussions about issues.<br/>
<br/>
I try to respond in a way that doesn&#39;t sound hurtful to dh, but when he is acting disrespectfully to the children I always say something about it.  Sometimes I will wait and talk to him about it later.  It just depends on the situation and how the children are reacting.<br/>
<br/>
Or I will question him.  &quot;Does it really matter if the kids do (or don&#39;t) ...?&quot;  Sometimes he is just responding without thinking.  When he stops to think about it, he often realizes that the action or behavior is OK.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>=================================================<br/>
<br/>
Numerous arguments aren&#39;t better than requiring chores.   <br/>
<br/>
Family unity is worth more than the confusion caused by parents disagreeing <br/>
and fighting.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who wrote that her husband would just move the family to another <br/>
state or buy a truck, but that is not really an unschooling issue.   <br/>
<br/>
There MUST be parallels to other areas of life.    If there&#39;s a list about <br/>
sailboat ownership and maintenance (there are probably lots of them) or formula <br/>
racecars, that doesn&#39;t mean everyone should be able to have or do that.<br/>
<br/>
If a family isn&#39;t agreed about homeschooling and it causes a divorce, the <br/>
kids end up in school.<br/>
<br/>
If a family isn&#39;t agreed about unschooling and it causes a divorce, the idea <br/>
of unschooling did those children a huge, deep harm.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom wants to move toward not requiring chores, the best way is probably <br/>
for her to do the chorse WITH the kids, and encourage whole-family cleanups so <br/>
the dad can see the kids&#39; capabilities, and the kids don&#39;t see the dad lying <br/>
on the couch telling them to clean the yard or something.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually is the only way to go. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073760871">Lucky for us, Darin has never had hard and fast rules about video games or tv. But then if we were not unschooling he would be the more permissive parent in that area. &lt;g&gt; Unschooling was foreign to Darin, he didn&#39;t get it and constantly questioned me. He would even sabotage (right word?) things when he got home. He would ask me what I did for school with the kids today. He would ask the kids math and spelling questions. So taking a page from other matters in our marriage I snuck unschooling up on him. Quietly, unassuming. Darin isn&#39;t a big reader, he does like to read, just doesn&#39;t have the time or energy. So taking that into consideration I would email him articles from Sandra&#39;s and others web sites. I would leave books laying around with paragraphs highlighted. And I never, ever said things like &#39;did you get my email?&#39; or &#39;did you read such and such in that book I left open on your pillow?&#39; I just sent or left and didn&#39;t mention. If he brought it up or asked a question, fine,<br/>
 great! And I rarely mentioned the word unschooling, to us that was almost a catalyst. I would talk about all the things the kids and I did during the day, and quietly guide schoolish conversations into other, more productive matters. I didn&#39;t argue with him or contradict him in front of the kids or otherwise. When he asked the kids schoolish types of questions I would say things like &#39;did you know that today Jack kept the shopping list and read from it for me while Moly kept the price book and calculator and kept us in our budget?&#39; And my kids aren&#39;t quiet about their accomplishments. A few years ago my mom gave Jack a bunch of wood projects, bird houses and such. Lots of instructions, measuring, cutting... not one of those pre cut kits. He had to do most of the work himself. That was impressive for Darin, who when he saw the gift, thought it was more for someone in a high school shop class than a seven year old. <br/>
 <br/>
Now six years later if you were to spend a day with us, (a day Darin is here that is) you would probably think he is the more unschoolish of us. And yes it did take years. You can probably deschool a child in a few months to a year, depending on the length of time spent in school. You can deschool your self in about the same amount of time, maybe a bit longer, but someone who is resistant it can take years. But those years can be good. Keep it low key, keep things non-confrontational. You have to be THE example. Take a cue from the moderators of this group. When things get too far away from unschooling topics and become more about schoolish or whatever things, they gently guide the group back on track. <br/>

<br/>
During out parenting career (our oldest is 24 now), there were often <br/>
times when I would say to Barry (after a spanking, or shouting, or a <br/>
grounding or whatever), &quot;This is wrong. This is just wrong&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And he would answer, &quot;What&#39;s your suggestion, then?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t have one. I just knew what I  we  were doing wasn&#39;t <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I first started to read about respectful parenting, my kids <br/>
were already old  the oldest in his late teens and back in <br/>
public school after &quot;school at home&quot; and the middle son being <br/>
unschooled &quot;only the school&quot; part.<br/>
<br/>
Things just weren&#39;t going as well as I wanted them to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I finally discovered whole-life unschooling on this list, even <br/>
though I picked stuff for Barry to read  and he did  it took more <br/>
than that. It took reading, thinking, contemplating, research, <br/>
arguing (in my head, not on the lists &lt;g&gt;) and time. <br/>
<br/>
And I was looking for answers. Barry thought things were going <br/>
pretty well. (And they were by the usual standards.)<br/>
<br/>
But when I finally got it, REALLY got it, I was ready to do it NOW <br/>
- no, yesterday!<br/>
<br/>
Barry wasn&#39;t.<br/>

have to BE the example.  (I changed the emphasis a bit, Nancy &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

would offer several suggestions/choices and let them choose. The <br/>
other thing I tell them is that when their kids ask to do something <br/>
just say yes more.  I remember I would think &#39;is there any real <br/>
reason why they can&#39;t?&#39;, and if there wasn&#39;t I would say yes.  These <br/>
are small changes that you can do even if hubby isn&#39;t on board yet.<br/>
<br/>
With other lifestyle issues like food, just offer them lots of <br/>
choices, if your tradition has been set meal times, don&#39;t just scrap <br/>
that.  Instead just ask your kids questions like what sounds good for <br/>
lunch etc...  With bedtimes, I would just say would you like to watch <br/>
the rest of the program, not you don&#39;t have a bedtime anymore.  You <br/>
can evolve into this over time.  Think of it as baby steps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111279741">I don&#39;t think it is a great &quot;intro to unschooling&quot; video - it is more  <br/>
of a &quot;human interest&quot; type film. It is a documentary for the non- <br/>
unschooing public, not conceived of as something useful for  <br/>
unschoolers or potential unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t think it would be particular great at convincing a spouse  <br/>
or in-laws. There is a tone of the families being very interesting  <br/>
and unusual - very quirky. That might not BE the approach one would  <br/>
want to take with a doubting spouse. I know it would have been more  <br/>
of a turn-off for my dh, not an inspiration to want to BE like them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying there is anything negative about those people featured  <br/>
in the film - they&#39;re great, interesting, articulate, etc. Two of the  <br/>
three families in the documentary are friends of mine and the third  <br/>
was really interesting, too. But the film-maker chose them and chose  <br/>
to feature them as unusual, quirky, a bit eccentric. Which they ARE,  <br/>
of course, and that&#39;s WONDERFUL and inspiration to ME, but I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking that a spouse, who already thinks this unschooling stuff  <br/>
sounds a bit too weird, might be more turned off than convinced by  <br/>
the video.<br/>
<br/>
My husband turned out to be an unexpectedly conventional kind of guy  <br/>
who likes to &quot;fit in&quot; to society way more than I care about.  <br/>
Whodathunk it? He came to this country from Iran, a member of a tiny  <br/>
minority religion that believes in equality of women and men, an end  <br/>
to racism - very very progressive. I thought he was a risk-taker,  <br/>
unconventional type of person - but I think he&#39;d USED up his  <br/>
adventurous spirit just getting here and marrying ME! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So once he was sort of settled in, finished school, good job, married  <br/>
with children, homeowner, in a community with good schools -- he was  <br/>
set and happy. &quot;I,&quot; on the other hand, was still the same person who  <br/>
had studied in a field not much open to women,  joined a tiny  <br/>
minority religion, married a guy from Iran - still a person who LIKES  <br/>
to do the quirky, different thing!<br/>
<br/>
So unschooling appealed to that part of me, while my husband is still  <br/>
completely bewildered by it. He&#39;s never actively fought it - but he  <br/>
had to &quot;just trust&quot; me. Never &quot;got it.&quot; Can&#39;t really quite understand  <br/>
how this all happened - how the kids turned out so &quot;okay.&quot; He&#39;d have  <br/>
liked to have had them in school, winning accolades that he could  <br/>
brag about to other parents, especially at work. It is hard for him -  <br/>
he can&#39;t say to the guys at work, &quot;Oh, well, MY 14 year old spends  <br/>
most of her time hanging around at a karate studio with mostly older  <br/>
guys, playing RISK. That is, when she isn&#39;t sleeping late because she  <br/>
stays up half the night IMing with online friends. He could say she&#39;s  <br/>
taking &quot;college courses,&quot; but he&#39;d have to &quot;admit&quot; that those courses  <br/>
are &quot;musical theater&quot; and &quot;piano&quot; classes. Not too impressive  <br/>
compared to the guys talking about how their kid has an above 4.0  <br/>
grade point average or is taking five AP classes or whatever. Oh  <br/>
well. Poor him. &lt;G&gt; He may not have those kinds of bragging rights,  <br/>
but he has three daughters who love their family and are all busy and  <br/>
happy and independent-minded with a strong sense of self and have  <br/>
strong passions and interests and are enthusiastic about life and  <br/>
their own futures and are NOT plotting how to get as far away as  <br/>
possible from their parents as soon as they can! That&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>

It&#39;s a good trade off, isn&#39;t it?  <br/>
<br/>
Once in a while I wish I could join in the bragging at family get-togethers<br/>
but with unschooling nothing is black and white like A&#39;s on report cards and<br/>
winning sports teams.  My kids are smart and funny and athletic (no sports<br/>
teams, just horse back riding almost every day) and caring and kind but it&#39;s<br/>
hard to qualify for a quick brag.  But I wouldn&#39;t change a few minutes of<br/>
bragging for the relationship we have in our family that I am pretty sure<br/>
none of my siblings have with their kids. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-33999730">Since bragging rights came up, particularly with this ending, I<br/>
thought I&#39;d brag a bit (within context obviously).  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we went over to a friend&#39;s house.  While David and the dad<br/>
were staying back at home to cook dinner, the mom and her infant and<br/>
daughter (5) and Linnaea (5), Simon (8) and I went to the park.  On<br/>
the way there the little girl really wanted to be the leader.  Linnaea<br/>
was power skipping and got in the lead.  There was a verbal squabble<br/>
about who had rights to the front which ended with the friend falling<br/>
to the back and whimpering a bit.  Not long after Linnaea walked back<br/>
to her friend and said, &quot;Could you lead? I don&#39;t know where we are<br/>
going and you do.&quot;  I teared up and had to look away. If I had forced<br/>
Linnaea to cede the front to this little girl she would never have<br/>
been able to be generous in such a wonderful way.   <br/>
<br/>
Simon isn&#39;t a reader, yet.  Linnaea still slurs lmnop into one letter.<br/>
 Whenever my dad calls he expresses deep concern over their education.<br/>
 I can&#39;t brag about how advanced they are for their ages in school or<br/>
in literacy or in numeracy. And I don&#39;t know that I want to or need<br/>
to.  But I know that they both are loving, generous people.  I know<br/>
that not only can Linnaea at 5 be more generous than almost any other<br/>
child I&#39;ve ever met, but she can do it with a tactfulness that I would<br/>
never have predicted. Even if I can only rarely brag about it to a<br/>
select group of people.<br/>

   It is really neat to hear someone bragging about their kid because <br/>
they are kind to others.  Why does achievement seem to trump treating <br/>
other people well?  Imagine how our society would be if kindness were <br/>
as championed as honor rolls, good grades, sports skills etc...<br/>
<br/>
My turn to brag:0)  We were on a hay rack ride last week. A younger <br/>
child lost their shoe, my 11 year old son hops off, retrieves the <br/>
shoe and puts it back on for the younger kid.  Being so kind and <br/>
nurturing is something they certainly don&#39;t learn in school.  But I <br/>
seriously can&#39;t think of anything that is more important.  Doesn&#39;t it <br/>
seem like ps champions the less important stuff, and ignores what is <br/>
essential?<br/>

with academic achievement than with anything else.  Not that they<br/>
don&#39;t love their children, but I&#39;ve been told by a homeschooling<br/>
mother that the most important thing she could do for her children was<br/>
to make sure that they could be successful, productive adults.  If<br/>
that meant that her children spent their teenage years at home<br/>
studying for GCSE&#39;s than so be it.  As an aside, David (dh) this week<br/>
said he thought that if the worst happened and we all died from bird<br/>

favor of verbal and mathematical to the near exclusion of all else (except <br/>
sports and music as *extras* earned by those who are good at language and <br/>
numbers, &quot;good&quot; being proven school-style).<br/>
<br/>
Even if the schools were to make a fully equally situation for the jocks, <br/>
artists, musicians, dancers and actors...    Would they have any way to really <br/>
encourage or quanitify or reward interpersonal or intrapersonal intelligence?<br/>
<br/>
There is a reward on its own for those who are popular among others at <br/>
school, who can find tactful ways to tiptoe through the minefields of school and <br/>
maybe help others along the way.   But as a skill all its own in one who is not <br/>
also talented in language, math, physical or mathematical ways, it&#39;s not given <br/>
any credit at all, as far as I can remember or imagine.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine married someone who was &quot;not very clever&quot; in his own words, <br/>
but he said she was very sweet.    She didn&#39;t stay as sweet as she could&#39;ve.   <br/>

  Another brag. Not about academics or doing kind things or anything <br/>
like that. My dd aged 9 has just taught herself to make custard from <br/>
reading the instructions on the custard powder tin. The kind you have <br/>
to mix custard powder with sugar and a bit of the milk, then boil some <br/>
milk, mix with the powder in a bowl and then return to simmer in the <br/>
pan again.<br/>

She&#39;s been making custard for herself  all week, she made some for us <br/>

Do you really think everyone has a capacity or desire for those kinds of <br/>
things?<br/>

Which things are you referring to Sandra, the capacity to be creative,<br/>
philosophical, and adventurous?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think everyone has the same capacity as everyone else, but I think<br/>
that schools and parents squash what little bit some people have right out<br/>
of them.  You should see the stories my kids have been writing this week.<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll send in a little bit for the list to read, if they don&#39;t mind.<br/>
(I&#39;ll have to ask) Their creativity and writing abilities are amazing and<br/>
they have always been unschooled.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I have myopic vision.  I believe that because my eyes have<br/>
opened to the joys of living and learning if only everyone else would<br/>
open their eyes they could experience that as well.  But, maybe they<br/>
are all the dwarves in C.S. Lewis&#39;s The Last Battle who would never<br/>
open their eyes to joy prefering to believe the food in front of them<br/>
was donkey turds rather than the wonderous bounty that Aslan set in<br/>
front of them (and I do appreciate the irony of an atheist using C.S.<br/>
Lewis&#39;s allegory to demonstrate a similar view). Or maybe you are<br/>
right.  It could be a lack of capacity or desire.  Sigh...how sad.<br/>

<br/>
Have you ever seen the 7 up series?  It&#39;s a British series created by<br/>
Granada television in the 60s.  It was begun largely as an examination<br/>
of the benefits of certain kinds of education (public versus grammer<br/>
versus comprehensive) and the class system.  In the end it is a sort<br/>
of reality show (the most recent 49 up was aired a little over a month<br/>
ago) following the people who were in the first episode in 1963. The<br/>
people are fascinating to listen to.  They are interesting, some more<br/>
than others, and interested in other things.  Perhaps because they<br/>
were selected at 7 and followed again at 7 year intervals for the next<br/>
42 years.  Maybe because someone else found them interesting they<br/>
became more capable of presenting themselves in interesting ways. <br/>
Maybe it is just good editing.  Maybe, really, there aren&#39;t any people<br/>
who want to be lumberjacks working in accounting, but Monty Python let<br/>
me dream it so.  <br/>

think accountants have been led to believe that white collar jobs are simply <br/>
superior to positions involving physical labor.<br/>

Some unschoolers don&#39;t even seem to wan t to do more than they &quot;have to do.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do I   *have* to do that?&quot; <br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t *have* to do that to be an unschooler.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought when I left school I would get away from people&#39;s attempts to do <br/>
just the bare minimum required to pass, but it seems the outside world is full <br/>
of lots of them too.   The receptionist and the girl in the records room at the <br/>
clinic where I was yesterday--no compunctions about bullshitting when they <br/>
didn&#39;t know the real answer.   If they won&#39;t lose their jobs over wrong answers, <br/>
the wrong answers are no real problem.<br/>
<br/>
-=- It could be a lack of capacity or desire.  Sigh...how sad.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why, though, is it sad for you?<br/>
If everyone was as interesting as you are, you&#39;d be average instead of <br/>
fascinating. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jocks sometimes think it&#39;s said when someone else isn&#39;t as athletic or as <br/>
knowledgeable about the trivia of the chosen sport.   Why should they be sad?   <br/>
<br/>
School-at-homers express sorrow for the poor benighted children of <br/>
unschoolers.   Why should they be sad?<br/>
<br/>

Yes.   Some have more than others.<br/>

<br/>
I have no doubt your kids are creative.<br/>
You should&#39;ve seen the stories some kids write who ARE in school!<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone longs to be us, that&#39;s all.<br/>
