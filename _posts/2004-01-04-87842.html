<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821509874">**so they can continue to press for government<br/>
funded (and eventually compulsory) school for children younger than the <br/>
age of five.**<br/>
<br/>
I also see this coming and think it&#39;s a lousy idea.  I don&#39;t want <br/>
taxpayers to subsidize this for every child, even when the parents can <br/>
afford it and/or the kids don&#39;t want to go.  Even if there isn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;enough&quot; childcare available and even if it is expensive, I like the <br/>
fact that it is diverse; people who use it can pick a program that they <br/>
find appealing (e.g Montessori preschool).  To drive existing daycares <br/>
and preschools out of business and supply one generic government school <br/>
experience for 3 and 4 year olds is really a crappy idea.<br/>
<br/>
(And while I&#39;ve got the word &quot;crappy&quot; in mind can I link this with the <br/>
potty-training thread?  Is it likely to be mandatory to start government <br/>
schooling at age 3 and to be potty trained at that age without <br/>
exception?  Good grief.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, of course, I think kids benefit from spending lots of time with <br/>
loving parents at home or in the world.  Let&#39;s dump the ingrained idea <br/>
that love and comfort &quot;spoil&quot; children and make them too weak for life&#39;s <br/>
struggles and battles.  Arrrgggghhh!<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas how to effectively fight against the universal preschool push?<br/>

I have no answer to your question but, I do think that I remember <br/>
this having come up some time ago.  Before we moved from CA (I have <br/>
yet to hear them in NV yet but....you never know) there were <br/>
commercials on both tv and radio that start out with a grown man in <br/>
some wonderful job.  He says I could never have this job if I didn&#39;t <br/>
go to college.  Then I could never have gone to college if I didn&#39;t <br/>
graduate from high school.  I could never have graduated from high <br/>
school if I didn&#39;t do well in junior high and so on until he&#39;s a 4 <br/>
or 5 year old child saying that he could never have gone as far in <br/>
life if he hand&#39;t gone to pre-school!  UNBELIEVABLE!!  So...my child <br/>
has to go to pre-school before he/she can get a good job that they <br/>
like?!  Are you kidding me?  What&#39;s next?  pre-pre-school?<br/>

Keep unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, in CA one of the local proponents of making kindergarten,<br/>
rather than 1st grade, the school starting age, is/was actually my local<br/>
representative. At one time some of the members of my group were all for<br/>
going to see him and talk about the proposed legislation. I didn&#39;t care to<br/>
go, and some other members felt it was like inviting trouble with the local<br/>
DOE. At the time there was increased paranoia in CA due to a memo being<br/>
circulated about hs being illegal (it&#39;s not of course). However I believe<br/>
that the push for this one year early, is entirely to do with an extra year<br/>
of free child care for the large population of economically struggling<br/>
families in much of this electorate, and almost nothing to do with education<br/>
advantages. These are children who are already in childcare of varying<br/>
quality - and much of it is overcrowded and overpriced. The affluent have<br/>
nannies, not group daycare. Some schools offer paid kindergarten. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want preschool, but many people would like the financial relief.<br/>

I think by getting out in public, talking with people about how we live,<br/>
etc., we lay the ground work for alternatives in people&#39;s minds.<br/>
<br/>
We are in the local small feedstore fairly regularly.  The man who runs it<br/>
has adult children but not much contact with small ones.  When we come in,<br/>
the kids (all 5 of them) love to climb up on the counter stools to tell him<br/>
what we need, they talk to him about the animals or 4-H or hunting or<br/>
whatever.  He ALWAYS has candy for them.....so at Halloween, we took a big<br/>
bag for him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the kids were gone to grandma&#39;s this last week and I went in the<br/>
feedstore.  Carl asked about the kids and I told him they were gone.  He<br/>
said &quot;I have to ask, how do you do it?  Don&#39;t get me wrong the kids are<br/>
always very nice here, very polite but when they get home......they have to<br/>
be going in a thousand different directions?  How do you do it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I replied &quot;I drink lots of herbal tea and simply let them go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Carl kind of grinned and said &quot;That might be an idea.&quot;  Then he went back in<br/>
the back to get something else I needed.<br/>
<br/>
Carl came back out and said laughingly, &quot;Now that I think about it....it is<br/>
probably a really good idea.&quot;<br/>
