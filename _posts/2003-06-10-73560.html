<div id="ygrps-yiv-944628904">I was thinking it was someone here that was talking about maybe starting a <br/>
reading group of unschoolers but was unsure because everyone has their own <br/>
definition of unschooling.  I met one today that takes the cake.  <br/>
<br/>
At our homeschooling play group I showed up early and one other Mom, new to <br/>
the group, showed up early.  We were chatting and she was talking about their <br/>
homeschooling journey.  She had said they have been homeschooling for 13 years <br/>
now.  For the first 12 years she had done it all herself.  Decided what they <br/>
were going to study for history, math, science and for how long.  What books <br/>
they were going to read and what reports would be due for English etc etc, <br/>
created her own curriculum and was getting tired of the endless hours of writing up <br/>
this curriculum. Then she found the wonders of Bob Jones University stuff and <br/>
bought the boxed curriculum this year and she and the kids love it. It went <br/>
on. We talked about other stuff too.  I didn&#39;t mention that I was an <br/>
unschooler, hate to scare people off.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, the rest of the group showed up and we were all chatting.  Teresa and a <br/>
few others were talking about taking their children out of public school.  <br/>
And happened to mention unschooling in passing.  This new Mom pipes up &quot;I <br/>
unschooled for 12 years then I discovered BJU and my kids love it.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I could see Teresa&#39;s eyes bug out (hi Teresa).  I just knew she was thinking <br/>
&quot;why on Earth would someone unschool for 12 years then switch&quot; or &quot;how bizarre <br/>
is that.&quot;  LOL.  Later I had to explain to Teresa exactly what that mom&#39;s <br/>
definition of unschooling is.  I had no idea that she would say that as she never <br/>
mentioned unschooling in our earlier conversation.  Too funny<br/>
<br/>
Most people have a definition of unschooling that is real relaxed.  This Mom <br/>
was so far away from unschooling I don&#39;t think you could get any further away. <br/>
 LOL.  So if I were going to start a &quot;book club&quot; I would definitely make sure <br/>
everyone is in at least the same chapter if not all on the same page.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just my interesting day.  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, when that lady said that, I must have contorted my face or something.. <br/>
LOL... I even said to the lady next to me.. &quot;gosh, thats a reverse, I&#39;ve never <br/>
heard of anyone going that way&quot;..  I didnt say anything to the &quot;converted <br/>
unschooler&quot;  I just listened in amazement as she described how much easier her <br/>
life was now that she could &quot;blame&quot; all the work on the video personality from <br/>
the BJU tapes she uses.   I was in shock thinking her kids had been unschooled <br/>
for 12 yrs and now they LOVED BJU curriuculum.   It all became clear when Pam <br/>
explained it to me after the lady had left.  I was like.. HUH??, WHAT?? she <br/>
made up her own school at home curriuclum and she called it unschooling???    <br/>
<br/>
We met a &quot;new&quot; lady today who has teen that she homeschools.  I know she is <br/>
trying to get her footing and decide which way to go with it.  I had emailed <br/>
her the unschooling.com link and she said she really enjoyed reading the web <br/>
site.   Today she said she is concerned about how her son will &quot;get&quot; Biology next <br/>
year ( he is 15).  All the dissecting frogs and stuff.   Folks gave several <br/>
suggestions for online stuff and local classes.  I was thinking.. &quot;can&#39;t he <br/>
just catch a frog and cut it up if he wants to?&quot;  LOL.. but I didn&#39;t say that.    <br/>
 We are going to be meeting her and her daughter again soon, she and Anna <br/>
might hit it off.  Anna said today that she was very nice and she would like to <br/>
do something with them again.    I will kind of just casually talk about <br/>
unschooling, sort of like witnessing to a non-believer.. LOL.. Lead by example and <br/>
all of that good stuff.  If she sees that Anna is doing great, maybe she will <br/>
be convinced that unschooling DOES work<br/>
