<div id="ygrps-yiv-636684269">I have been benefiting from this list for a few months,<br/>
but have never posted. I am an unschooling mom of three<br/>
daughters, ages 9, 7 and 5. It has been a rough month for us<br/>
as we have wondered whether our choice to home and then <br/>
unschool our kids is the &quot;right&quot; thing to do. I realized<br/>
that I was taking too many polls of the people around me,<br/>
trying to get their approval so that I could feel okay<br/>
about what we were doing. It wasn&#39;t enough that my husband<br/>
and I felt confident about it, I needed everyone to pat me o<br/>
on the head and say what a good job I was doing and what<br/>
a wonderful mother I was. I have realized over the past week<br/>
that there are places where you will be able to get support<br/>
in these endeavors and places where that support will never<br/>
be forthcoming. Just as I had to accept that, I have had to<br/>
wrestle with my own doubts and fears on a daily basis. Its<br/>
not the most fun, but at least I can feel good that I am<br/>
showing my kids that we can reevaluate and renegotiate<br/>
life whenever we want to, making mistakes can be a way of<br/>
finding out both what we like and what needs to be let go of.<br/>
I appreciate the input on this list so much. Thanks. Teresa</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540731829">Yep, doubts seem to go with the territory, but I&#39;m finding that this is<br/>
good.  It helps me examine my choices very closely.  But, having said that,<br/>
I still have doubts.  I do have friends who homeschool though, and I can<br/>
always turn to them in those times.  I feel much better shortly.  It does<br/>
get easier I think.  It is a huge change, and changes take time to get used<br/>
to.  Welcome.....<br/>

    Welcome Teresa,<br/>
     I too have done this in too many areas of my life for many years.  If I <br/>
don&#39;t allow myself to get distracted my others&#39; opinions, I have a good, <br/>
clear sense of what I believe in and the way I want to live.  Unschooling is <br/>
an important part of my life and ideals.  But I can be insecure at times and <br/>
if I am around certain people at those times, I find myself doubting what I <br/>
believe.  As the years go by, I find myself more sure and I bolster that by <br/>
thinking, reading, and writing about the reasons for my beliefs.  Lists like <br/>
this are also a major source of support.  <br/>
     I don&#39;t like to be afraid to listen to others&#39; opinions because I <br/>
believe we are often challenged and enriched by them.  So I try to find the <br/>
balance between being open to other views, willing to discuss things, and <br/>
doing what I need to do to stay connected to my own true voice.  Best wishes <br/>
with your unschooling adventures...<br/>
<br/>
