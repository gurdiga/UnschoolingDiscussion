&gt; I&#39;m in the dark here... what is Sweet Valley High???<br/>
&gt; Nina<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **Nina, you poor, deprived thing....Sweet Valley High is a series of little<br/>
&gt; paperback books that&#39;s centered around an imaginary High School. Incredibly<br/>
&gt; juvenile. I&#39;m sure many here who read them envy your ignorance on the<br/>
&gt; subject. (btw, I think I read *one* and that was enough to turn me off from<br/>
&gt; them forever.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288356992">My son really liked Lloyd Alexander&#39;s books &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, &quot;The Castle<br/>
of Llyr&quot;, and &quot;The High King&quot;. Also, for fun, adventure and laughs the<br/>
dragon series by Patricia Wrede were well enjoyed &quot;Searching for Dragons&quot;,<br/>
Dealing with Dragons&quot;, Calling on Dragons&quot; amd &quot;Talking to Dragons&quot;. He has<br/>
also enjoyed the Secrets of Droon&#39; series and Dinotopia books. For us these<br/>
are read together books.<br/>

&gt; Subject: boys books<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m new to the list and have been enjoying the information you all<br/>
&gt; have been sharing. Thanks!<br/>
&gt; I have 3 sons - 10 and  7 years old  and 18 months. I was wondering if<br/>
&gt; anyone had suggestions of books they found that their sons enjoyed. My<br/>
&gt; boys are really into adventure stories, and anything that makes them<br/>
&gt; laugh. I&#39;m looking for read together books and &quot;read by themselves&quot;<br/>
&gt; books (2nd grade level). </span></blockquote></div>
