hi,
<p>i thought this was an interesting and perhaps timely quote, at least
for me it was:
<p>&#39;truth is that all theories, no matter how warm, fuzzy, and intuitively
obvious, interfere with relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp; to have no theories is
the challenge, to say yes to the moment, to go where no one has gone before,
space...the space between humans...the finial and only frontier.&nbsp;&nbsp;
be brave.&#39;
<p>- the handwringers&#39;s column in <u>the california homeschooler</u>
<br>by barbara alward &amp; diane kallas
<br>&nbsp;(i got it from this winter&#39;s issue of <u>paths of learning</u>
mag)
<p>this is just the last paragraph.&nbsp; the whole column is very humorous
and was written as a satirical response to alfie kohn&#39;s theories (who i
enjoy)&nbsp; it was published right after a long interview w alfie:)&nbsp;
i love this mag. and this column makes me want to subscribe to&nbsp; <u>the
california homeschooler</u> as well.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733046702">Helen,  Thanks for this!<br/>
    I guess it&#39;s the holidays,  but the fact that my family (of origin) is<br/>
very disconnected is on my mind lots lately.  Dh&#39;s family has been better<br/>
overall,  but as we all get caught in our family lives,  it&#39;s<br/>
harder...parenting styles differ - one of his sibs actually uses Ezzo<br/>
&lt;cringe&gt;.  His sibs live across the country and it&#39;s been difficult to get<br/>
together.<br/>
    Anyhow,  I&#39;m like Sarah in that I&#39;ve observed and &#39;wanted&#39; to have<br/>
closeness with my children as they grow into adults.  I know that I usually<br/>
enjoy our time now and find that living this way supports closeness in<br/>
relationships;  whereas,  I think &#39;schooling&#39; them could be divisive.<br/>
    I appreciate hearing from you and Tia on this since your perspective is<br/>
different.  Sometimes when one is in the midst of a situation....it&#39;s hrad<br/>
to get a good look ifyaknowwhatImean.<br/>
Susan<br/>
I always expected a close relationship with my kids when they were<br/>
grown, and so far we have just that, even though three of them live<br/>
quite a ways away (two in Alaska, one 60+ miles away), and the other<br/>
two are gone more than they&#39;re home most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
What do I mean by close? Well... I was visiting the kids in Alaska<br/>
just before Christmas and we were out doing some Christmas shopping;<br/>
I was picking out one of those noisy-obnoxious kinds of toys grandmas<br/>
love to give grandkids when my oldest son grabbed me from behind,<br/>
lifted me right up off my feet with a big bearhug, and said &quot;Mom, I<br/>
love you to pieces but if you get that for my daughter I&#39;m going to<br/>
mail both it and her down to YOU!&quot; &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So I snuck back the next day, bought the noisemaker, wrapped it up<br/>
and tucked it under the tree for HIM to open on Christmas - after I&#39;d<br/>
left! &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m waiting for Jim, the son who lives 60 miles away, to<br/>
show up with his family. I was over at their place last night (yeah,<br/>
we all travel A LOT), and thought about just spending the night<br/>
there, but it was a beautiful clear moonlit night and the drive<br/>
between here and there is through some of the most beautiful<br/>
mountains anywhere, over the highest pass in the state... (and<br/>
besides, there&#39;s nothing like one&#39;s *own* bed and snugglies &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been home about ten minutes when the phone rang. It was Jim, just<br/>
checking to make sure I&#39;d made it home safely. Mark said it was his<br/>
third call, and on his call before that he&#39;d said he was giving me<br/>
another half hour before he started out looking for me. (Yes, I carry<br/>
a cellphone, but it doesn&#39;t work out in those mountains.)<br/>
<br/>
I credit my parents with teaching me how to parent. What goes around<br/>
comes around.<br/>

<br/>
And I think this is true.  We learn so much<br/>
about parenting, even things we wish we<br/>
didn&#39;t know, from our parents and other<br/>
relatives.<br/>
<br/>
I think the best parents look closely at how<br/>
they were parented, and choose which aspects<br/>
of their own parenting they wish to keep, and<br/>
what things they will never do.  My parents<br/>
were wonderful parents, but I also know there<br/>
are mistakes they made and I will work to not<br/>
make those same mistakes.  I want to make all<br/>
new ones.<br/>
<br/>
however, so many people simple parent as they<br/>
were parented, without thought.  It was good<br/>
enough to them to be spanked, go to school,<br/>
eat fried foods, not be in seat belts,<br/>
whatever... I turned out OK and by golly so<br/>
will my kids.  I hate that mentality.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well... most of the time, they are. But there *are* other times... I <br/>
tend to see the positive side of things, but the warts are still <br/>
there. We&#39;re not the Nelsons or the Cleavers, by any means. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

my Dad - all do things which drive me right up the wall (Dad&#39;s <br/>
3-pack-a-day chain-smoking is probably the worst), but I try to be <br/>
philosophical and let them be who they are. Yeah, I tell Dad his <br/>
smoking&#39;s gonna kill him someday, and that I find it hard to be in <br/>
the same room with him when he really gets going, and - the one plea <br/>
that always gets to him - it&#39;s not good for the little <br/>
great-granddaughters (but that only works when they&#39;re around)... But <br/>
I know he smokes purely out of a habit picked up when he was working <br/>
30-40 hours at a stretch debugging computer programs - smoking became <br/>
some kind of a physical or mental crutch for him then, and it&#39;s <br/>
somehow serving the same purpose now as he battles being paralyzed <br/>
and wheelchair-bound. He&#39;s so proud of the fact that he can pull out <br/>
and light his own cigarettes - he can do so damn little else...<br/>
<br/>
And just FWIW: we&#39;ve tried every distraction in the book to get him <br/>
to quit. First off, he has to want to quit, and he doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
But the point was, my family&#39;s not perfect. Many of you probably have <br/>
&quot;more perfect&quot; families. I just choose to focus on the good and let <br/>
the rest go, as my parents taught me to do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mother smoked almost all her life.  I knew not to hassle her about it, <br/>
having been a smoker myself.  About the only thing I said to her in the <br/>
last few years was to mention what a drag it would be to have to be hooked <br/>
up to oxygen all the time.  (She has a touch of emphysema.)  Well she just <br/>
happened to mention on the phone early this summer that she hadn&#39;t smoked <br/>
for a week.  I&#39;m sure she could hear my jaw dropping.  &lt;g&gt;  She said it had <br/>
nothing to do with health worries.  She just woke up one morning thinking <br/>
she didn&#39;t want to do that anymore.  She talks now about how nice it is to <br/>
have more money to spend on other things.  She will be 86 in February and <br/>
she still isn&#39;t smoking.<br/>

<br/>
Dad quit smoking after his stroke in September, and didn&#39;t even want <br/>
to smoke for several weeks afterwards, but then one day he just up <br/>
and started in again.<br/>

up for her the other evening - four packs of cigarettes came to over <br/>
$17.00! I was flabbergasted - and then my sister told me the price is <br/>
going up by sixty cents a pack next week!<br/>

do in my life. It was harder than childbirth!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe keeping this thought in mind when dealing with anyone that smoked <br/>
for any length of time will help the whole perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t even a heavy smoker.. just something I picked up in while <br/>
waitressing and it stayed with me for 10 or so years.<br/>
<br/>
But alas, there are some powerful addictive chemicals in commercial <br/>
cigarettes...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, she did that once before, a number of years ago.  Then she ran for <br/>
the local school board and started up again on election night.  &lt;g&gt;  At the <br/>
time, she felt that she had gained none of the benefits of non-smoking and <br/>
all of the negatives.  She was coughing more and had gained a lot of <br/>
weight, maybe a few other things.  But I think it *will* stay decided this <br/>
time.  At this point she can use the weight anyway, having shrivelled away <br/>
to almost nothing.  And quite a few people have noticed, and told her, that <br/>
her thinking is a lot clearer since she stopped.  She worries a lot about <br/>
the fact that her memory is going.  (I&#39;m making a point of *not* telling <br/>
her that the one local nursing home won&#39;t accept smokers.  At this point <br/>
she&#39;s adamant that she doesn&#39;t ever want to live there, but she does want <br/>
to stay in her small town.  I want to see that option remain open if I can, <br/>
even though the *plan* is for her to die in her sleep one night in her own <br/>
apartment.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

easily stopped many times for months or years at a time without much of <br/>
a problem.  It was never a big deal.  Whenever I felt I was becoming <br/>
dependent on it, I would immediately stop.<br/>
<br/>
  I thoroughly enjoy smoking.  What I do to cut down the cost is to roll <br/>
my own cigarettes.  You can buy some really fine loose Danish, Dutch or <br/>
Turkish tobacco and roll your own for a fraction of the cost of a <br/>
regular pack of cigarettes and they are far better.  It just looks like <br/>
I&#39;m smoking a joint, that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not encouraging anyone to smoke.  I&#39;m just sharing information about <br/>
how I save some money.  I am planning to stop again with the new year.  <br/>
It&#39;s too bad it&#39;s not good for you.  But, then, so is eating too much <br/>
ice cream which I love to do also.<br/>
