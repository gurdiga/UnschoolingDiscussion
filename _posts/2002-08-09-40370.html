<div id="ygrps-yiv-597549206">More apologies to all for all my diatribes, and for those that may still<br/>
come. Last I looked, Helen was saying that in the subject of unschooling,<br/>
hardly anything was Off Topic. I have long believed that it&#39;s important for<br/>
people to know that, deep down, the school system is out to eliminate us,<br/>
even though there are some sympathetic people among its employees.<br/>
That&#39;s partly why I called our practice &quot;The Education Underground.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have plenty of precedent for my feelings about the school system<br/>
we reject. I believe that many who enter the world of Homeschooling, do so<br/>
without quite knowing why they do it. They know that they didn&#39;t get along<br/>
in their child&#39;s school and they knew it wasn&#39;t educating their child, but<br/>
can&#39;t put their finger on what it was specifically that bothered them, even<br/>
if the teachers seemed nice enough...<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a passage from John T.Gatto that might help some newbies who find<br/>
themselves in that catagory:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;As long as we&#39;re questioning public schooling, we should question whether<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there really is an abstraction called &quot;the public&quot; at all, except in the<br/>
ominour calculations of social engineers....I find the term [public]<br/>
insulting, a cartoon of social reality.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; If an institution that robs people of their right to self-determination can<br/>
 </span></blockquote>call itself &quot;public;&quot; if being &quot;public&quot; means it can turn families into<br/>
agents of the state, making parents spy on and harass their sons and<br/>
daughters because a schoolteacher tells them to; if the state can steal your<br/>
home because you can&#39;t pay its &quot;public&quot; school taxes, and the state courst<br/>
can break up your family if you refust to allow the state to tell your<br/>
children what to think, then the word &quot;public&quot; is garbage and for people who<br/>
allow themselves to be treated like slaves. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on your side. I will stand up for your rights.<br/>
