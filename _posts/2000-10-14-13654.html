<div id="ygrps-yiv-234696060">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
A story here in today&#39;s Yomiuri, a conservative national daily newspaper <br/>
in Japan, on yet another aspect of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori&#39;s <br/>
&quot;education reform&quot; measures: the purging of those teachers deemed to be <br/>
problematic from public schools nationwide.<br/>
<br/>
To some degree, one could welcome such government action, since there <br/>
certainly are problems with schoolteachers in Japan who physically or <br/>
emotionally abuse students in their classes.<br/>
<br/>
But reading the following story, one also gets the impression that those <br/>
are not necessarily the same kind of &quot;problem teachers&quot; the Ministry of <br/>
Education plans to go after.<br/>
<br/>
Historically in Japan, &quot;problem teachers&quot; has meant the same thing as <br/>
&quot;problem students&quot;: those people who dare to question higher authority <br/>
and thus are judged to be &quot;troublemakers.&quot; That would appear to be the <br/>
case this time as well.<br/>
<br/>
Purging the country&#39;s public schools, as the Ministry of Education <br/>
intends to do, would seem to serve two convenient purposes: (1) It gives <br/>
notice to public school teachers nationwide that they will &quot;shape up or <br/>
ship out&quot; if they do not conform to the tighter &quot;education reform&quot; <br/>
measures planned by the Japanese government.<br/>
<br/>
And (2) It punishes teachers only, while leaving the deeper underlying <br/>
problems of Japan&#39;s educational system untouched. <br/>
<br/>

MINISTRY IN DRIVE TO FIRE &#39;PROBLEM TEACHERS&#39;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So-called problem teachers -- ones who lack the leadership to conduct <br/>
meaningful classes -- may find themselves removed from the classroom if <br/>
the Education Ministry has its way.<br/>
<br/>
A campaign the ministry is preparing to launch includes a planned <br/>
revision of the law so that such teachers can be dismissed from the <br/>
nation&#39;s public schools.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers are currently screened and hired by prefectural governments, <br/>
although they are technically classified as local community government <br/>
officials.<br/>
<br/>
Under the ministry&#39;s plan, teachers who are deemed problematic would be <br/>
transferred out of the classroom and reemployed as prefectural government <br/>
officials in a nonteaching capacity. The ministry also aims to be able to <br/>
take such action without the consent of the teachers in question.<br/>
<br/>
A more coercive measure for the dismissal of problem teachers was also <br/>
considered, but the ministry turned down the idea on grounds that the <br/>
teachers themselves are not necessarily always accountable for their <br/>
actions.<br/>
<br/>
The chosen method would also guarantee alternative employment for the <br/>
individuals to be dismissed as teachers, thus sparing them the shock of a <br/>
sudden firing.<br/>
<br/>
The plan requires a partial revision to the law on the organization and <br/>
operation of local educational administrations.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Prefectural governments that hired the individuals in the first place <br/>
should be held responsible,&quot; a ministry official said.<br/>
<br/>
Who are these so-called problem teachers? Their characteristics include <br/>
an inability to communicate with pupils and a lack of enthusiasm for <br/>
making learning more interesting or exciting for the pupils. Many of them <br/>
reportedly only &quot;lecture&quot; students from blackboard notes. Some teachers <br/>
have even been accused of harming their charges by discouraging them <br/>
through words and actions.<br/>
<br/>
Estimates put such teachers at about 1 percent of the entire body of <br/>
public primary and middle school teachers nationwide, according to <br/>
undisclosed survey documents compiled by prefectural education boards.<br/>
<br/>
A teachers&#39; union official has voiced concern that such an attempt by the <br/>
ministry to remove problem teachers could backfire, resulting in the <br/>
ostracization of capable or popular teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, the seemingly small ratio of suspected problem teachers may <br/>
mask a teacher apathy whose effects are more widespread than apparent. <br/>
Indeed, such apathy constitutes a problem that cannot be ignored in that <br/>
homeroom teachers have considerable influence over the lives of children <br/>
in their charge.<br/>
<br/>
The ministry and prefectural education boards previously have neglected <br/>
the issue, confessing that they were at a loss for effective solutions.<br/>
<br/>
In theory, such teachers can legally be dismissed or demoted from their <br/>
teaching positions for a lack of professionalism under the Local Civil <br/>
Service Law, even though their lack of professionalism may not be <br/>
intentional.<br/>
<br/>
In stark contrast with the ease of implementing punitive dismissals of <br/>
individuals implicated in crimes, however, in cases of dismissals or <br/>
demotions based on professional ability, the burden of proof is on <br/>
authorities to show that a teacher cannot be expected to improve.<br/>
<br/>
Courts also have accepted complaints filed by dismissed teachers and <br/>
often have ruled in their favor, making local authorities all the more <br/>
cautious about dismissing teachers in general.<br/>
<br/>
The result has been that problem teachers continue to occupy the <br/>
classroom, despite protests from children and their guardians.<br/>
<br/>
The concessionary practice that has become common is to bring in another, <br/>
more compatible teacher or transfer the unpopular teacher to another <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
This, however, is hardly a solution, and has just given rise to increased <br/>
distrust of the public education system among parents.<br/>
<br/>
The ministry&#39;s apparent determination to revise the law is seen as an <br/>
effort to nip the further spread of public distrust in primary and middle <br/>
school education in the bud by taking the rights of pupils in the <br/>
classroom more seriously.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of rehiring dismissed teachers as prefectural government <br/>
officials is seen as a bridge from the protective educational environment <br/>
to the competitive working world. It also takes the burden off local <br/>
communities that otherwise would be saddled with incompetent teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, small local governments, with their limited resources, would <br/>
be hard-pressed to find new jobs for the dismissed teachers within their <br/>
own jurisdictions.<br/>
<br/>
The ministry, however, expects the revised law to be applied carefully, <br/>
including having the teachers undergo various training programs before <br/>
the final decision is made to transfer them.<br/>
<br/>
After all, public school teachers are hired as specialized public <br/>
servants under a law that not only assures job security but also prevents <br/>
them from looking into other fields.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, views held by the local community, including those of the <br/>
parents and the pupils, should be taken into consideration, in addition <br/>
to the opinion of the final decision-maker -- which in this case would be <br/>
the school principal -- in determining the professional aptitude of the <br/>
teacher in question.<br/>
