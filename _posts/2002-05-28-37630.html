<div id="ygrps-yiv-287567467">I&#39;ve been reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and reading ABOUT <br/>
the author and his ideas. So I ran into this:<br/>
<br/>
Pirsig&#39;s works have been the the focus of the discussion group, The Lila <br/>
Squad, which has been in existence since 1997.  From the experience of the <br/>
group, I have noticed that attempts to condense and pin down the Metaphysics <br/>
of Quality into concise definition often result in meaningless triviality.  <br/>
By contrast, the discussions that make up those attempts are rich and full of <br/>
unexpected insight and value. This is not a failure of the concepts of the <br/>
Metaphysics of Quality. <br/>
<br/>
I thought that we could substitute &quot;unschoooling&quot; for &quot;Metaphysics of <br/>
Quality&quot; and this would explain why it is so useful to try to define <br/>
unschooling over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has been the the focus of this discussion group since its <br/>
inception.  From the experience of the group, I have noticed that attempts to <br/>
condense and pin down &quot;unschooling&quot; into concise definition often result in <br/>
meaningless triviality.  By contrast, the discussions that make up those <br/>
attempts are rich and full of unexpected insight and value. This is not a <br/>
failure of the concepts of &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
