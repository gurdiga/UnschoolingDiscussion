Hello fellow homeschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
I am a single mother who has homeschooled my two children from birth.  We<br/>
have embraced the unschooling approach in the past three years.  I have met<br/>
some of you and know others.  I am currently a full-time student at OU.  I<br/>
have a double major of Anthropology and Women&#39;s Studies.  This semester I am<br/>
doing an Honor&#39;s research project for my Anthropology research.<br/>
<br/>
The research, in a nutshell, has to do with the way children learn.  It will<br/>
be a comparison between indigenous ways of learning and unschooling,<br/>
basically.  I would like to interview as many unschooling families as I can.<br/>
I am going to send out surveys to those who are interested in participating.<br/>
I would also like to observe several families firsthand.  If you are<br/>
interested in participating, please email me and ask any question you may<br/>
have.  If you would be willing to let me observe and are in the<br/>
Norman-OKC-Edmond area let me know.<br/>
<br/>
This research is the beginning of my research as an anthropologist, and will<br/>
be invaluable to an understanding of our modern connections to indigenous<br/>
knowledge and traditions.  Please consider being a part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
<br/>
