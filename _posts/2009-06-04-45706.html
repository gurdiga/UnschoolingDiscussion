<br/>
101 Reasons Why I&#39;m an Unschooler<br/>
I think it was in a link on a post on this list, or I saw it  <br/>
somewhere, I don&#39;t even know, but it&#39;s good.   It&#39;s small, and so a  <br/>
little pricey if you figured it per word, but don&#39;t worry about that.   <br/>
It&#39;s easy to read and might make the perfect thing to give the  <br/>
relatives who are disdainful but don&#39;t want to learn.<br/>
<br/>
If you can only buy one book this year, wait and buy mine in  <br/>
September. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you can buy two, buy this one.   (Or if you need one *now.*)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301379645">With regard to these wonderful books (and yes I will purchase them BOTH Sandra &lt;grin&gt;)  when most of my relatives just don&#39;t get it, regardless of the articles, essays, books, lists, and quotes I provide them with - I just see these as another failed path to their enlightenment. As discussed earlier, perhaps for whatever many reasons, they don&#39;t want to get it. The other part of me doesn&#39;t want to feel responsible anymore for explaining what we do.  My focus over the past 4 years has tried to be less on the naysayers and more on my children, where it belongs.  <br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m sorry I missed the chat on relatives.  I was not home.  Are there archives to read what was discussed?  <br/>

I don&#39;t see anything above the chat window either! No links anywhere except<br/>
in the request for topics which sends an email to Sandra. Not much one can<br/>
do on this page but click Start Chatting, which asks for a password to enter<br/>
the Unschooling chatroom. But nothing on this page gives me a password. <br/>
 <br/>
Wondering...is it always the same? I did join the chat the other day, but<br/>
Sandra had posted the password here (on the yahoo group) so that&#39;s how I got<br/>
in. Maybe I got lucky! I wonder if that page looks different on the days<br/>
when there is an active chat happening?<br/>
 <br/>
Oh wait, I just clicked the other links and the one for CHATS has the<br/>
password (which is always the same BTW). The REGULAR one tells when the<br/>
chats regularly happen. Adjust time zone from mountain to wherever you are!<br/>
Both of those pages have links to the ROOM page where the chat happens. I<br/>
hope this helps anyone who is still having problems. Look at all of the<br/>
links above!<br/>

<br/>
No, the page itself is one of my pages.  Only the chatbox is &quot;foreign.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I change the colors and intro sometimes, and occasionally add  <br/>
something to a sidebar on the right, but I don&#39;t know why some links  <br/>
would show (the box at the bottom) and some would not.<br/>
<br/>
Are you getting a background with the chat logo?<br/>
<br/>
Where the chat log is, out and about (my unschooling page, my blog),  <br/>
it goes to the intro page with the password, and from that to the room.<br/>
