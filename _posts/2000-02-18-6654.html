&lt;&lt;I used a friend&#39;s spiffy new computer the other day and found that, while <br/>
it was faster than ours, it still seemed to take a lot of time.  I&#39;m assuming <br/>

We could do a fun experiment -- everyone who wants to participate, go to the <br/>
Unschooling.com main page and count how many seconds it takes to completely <br/>
load.  Then come back here and report the number.  It would be interesting to <br/>
see what kind of variation there is.  (Some variation would depend on other <br/>
usage at the time.)<br/>
<br/>
This type of information would be useful to those of us who are working on <br/>
webstuff for NHEN (and also to people like Lisa who work on the website for <br/>
BOTH unschooling.com AND NHEN.)<br/>
<br/>
We know that some people have computers and browsers and modems that are so <br/>
slow they severely tax their patience, but it&#39;s hard to get real data that&#39;s <br/>
representative of homeschoolers.  (We may tend to hang on to our computers <br/>
longer than, say, office workers.)<br/>

Don&#39;t give up hope!  My brother ate peanut butter and honey sandwiches for <br/>
years on end as a boy, and now he orders the tofu vegetable scramble for <br/>
breakfast and eats Indian food for lunch.  I think his taste buds didn&#39;t grow <br/>
up until he was 30.<br/>

  Well, let&#39;s see if we can all try it at the same time!  That&#39;s a good<br/>
  way to get really bad performance!<br/>
<br/>
  I just tried it.  It took about 15 seconds.  The images were in my<br/>
  cache though since I&#39;d visited the website earlier in the week.  But<br/>
  when I emptied my cache it didn&#39;t take any longer.  <br/>
