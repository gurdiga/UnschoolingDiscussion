<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Of Marty, I thought &quot;All that Nintendo Duck Hunt paid off.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s the first thing I thought, video games, when you mentioned it!!! Good<br/>
&gt; for him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Army has a war games kind of video that they use for training soldiers.<br/>
Much of the reason they use is isn&#39;t for speed but for decision making.<br/>
They recently put some soldiers up against some really hot shot gamers.<br/>
Who, when, why, where, I don&#39;t know.  I didn&#39;t read the newspaper article<br/>
for details needed for the quiz the next day, unfortunately.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The end result, though, was that the soldiers got creamed by the gamers.  I<br/>
thought that was kind of funny, in a way.  Sad, but funny.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it was the gamer aspect Marty liked so much about the crime scene.  <br/>
There were factors to weigh and relationships between things and angles, and <br/>
when a guess was made, the team had to follow through with IF that&#39;s what we <br/>
think, then from what direction and where then and when?  It was aa 3-D puzzle <br/>
with timeline factors.  Right up his gaming alley.<br/>

I think there&#39;s a TV commercial like that. Expect I think in that one, the<br/>
service men kick butt!!! It&#39;s cute!<br/>
The gamers are so bummed about losing on line they remark, &quot;Who ARE these<br/>
guys???&quot;<br/>
