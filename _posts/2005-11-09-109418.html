 </span></blockquote>No.   I think it will be a long time before there are any, if ever.   Part of <br/>
the problem is that the definition of unschooler isn&#39;t scientifically valid.  <br/>
 Homeschoolers could be studied, and unschooling-leanings could be a part of <br/>
that.    <br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem is that few have been unschooled throughout.   Most <br/>
started in school, and it would be difficult or impossible to separate out what <br/>
they learned in school, or what effect school had on their subsequent attitudes <br/>
toward learning.<br/>
<br/>
I learned in school (definition presented three different times; I learned it <br/>
the first time) that no study was valid without a control group.   No control <br/>
group, no scientific method.   What would be the control group?   <br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand... what is the control group for formal education?    <br/>
All their &quot;studies,&quot; all the grad students&#39; &quot;work&quot; on which masters&#39; and PhDs <br/>
in education are based are done with pretty much nothing but the boogie man <br/>
as a real control group.   The hypothetical uneducated, illiterate, <br/>
unsocialized, math-ignorant straw man is the control group.   &quot;If it weren&#39;t for us, you <br/>
would be... &quot;   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go to a Live and Learn Unschooling Conference (the next one is in NM <br/>
in Sept 2006)...there will be NO question in your mind then <br/>
whether &quot;unschoolers are different&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, while i was at the last L&L Conference (this past Oct in <br/>
MO), i realized that unschoolers truly ARE different. We read on the <br/>
lists all the time about how unschooled kids are different, the <br/>
teenagers arent moody angry kids who hate their parents, the kids <br/>
are friendly and open, honest and caring....sometimes its hard to <br/>
believe that its true. Could unschooling really make THAT much of a <br/>
difference? <br/>
<br/>
But as i stood there surrounded by hundreds of unschooled kids I had <br/>
to admit, that YES they really are different. Its palpable. <br/>
Unmistakable. I don&#39;t know that a scientific study would be very <br/>
good at measuring how an unschooled teenager willingly and kindly <br/>
plays with a preschool age friend. Or whether the scientific method <br/>
could really capture the essence of a healthy, happy, whole <br/>
relationship between a 15 yr old teenager and her parents. How could <br/>
a scientific study really quantify the joy at seeing a roomful of <br/>
people clapping because a child was brave enough to go onstage in <br/>
front of strangers and tell a joke, or sing a song, surrounded by <br/>
total, unconditional love and acceptance? What &quot;scientific&quot; words <br/>
could truly convey the impact of a child learning to read (or &quot;do <br/>
math&quot; or spell or...)in his own way, in his own time, thereby <br/>
preserving his love of learning for years to come?<br/>
<br/>
I know you want proof that unschooling won&#39;t screw up your kid, that <br/>
your child will be successful and be able to learn what he &quot;needs&quot; <br/>
to know. But you&#39;re asking the wrong questions, really. Unschoolers <br/>
know that those are the natural byproducts of unschooling...how <br/>
could they not be? Because the real question is: is my child happy? <br/>
Is his or her day filled with joy? Do we treat each other kindly, <br/>
and with respect? Do i encourage my child&#39;s passions and help him <br/>
attain his goals if i can?<br/>
<br/>
If a child is raised the way most unschoolers are raised, how could <br/>
they NOT be successful? How could they NOT realize their dreams? <br/>
Happiness---JOY---*that&#39;s* the key to unschooling! How do you <br/>
measure that??<br/>

culture has clearly defined benefits for educational<br/>
outcomes.  I&#39;m simply saying that it would be nice to<br/>

children who are unschooled compared to children in public<br/>

<br/>
In a population of unschoolers, you are not going to get anything <br/>
really &#39;measurable&#39; in the weighed, defined, quantified, test <br/>
scores, college admissions, &quot;good&quot; (lucrative, prestigious) careers <br/>
way. The benefit of unschooling, as Karen said elsewhere, is in Joy, <br/>
Love, Freedom, Curiosity, Creativity, Peace. Can&#39;t measure or bottle <br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re considering unschooling as a homeschooling method that <br/>
produces more doctors or more engineers or higher GPAs, you&#39;re not <br/>
going to find what you are looking for. If you are looking for a way <br/>
to nurture the unique individual sparks of everyone in your family, <br/>
then read some, think some, ask yourself what the studies you are <br/>
looking for would prove in the long run in your unique family. <br/>
Because what we are all saying is that we&#39;ve jumped into the water <br/>
and we love it - that is our experience. There are those who dip a <br/>
toe in and decide not to because it doesn&#39;t fall within their <br/>
definition of proper temperature and salinity range. That&#39;s their <br/>
choice.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If unschooling has any positive benefits they should be measurable.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Measured how? Tests? Nope - that would defeat the purpose of the <br/>
subject being tested because imposing a test arbitrarily would go <br/>
counter to unschooling.	College degrees? Invalid since many of those <br/>
who have been unschooled choose to go directly into careers or start <br/>
businesses or whatever - you&#39;d have to hold this one in abeyance <br/>
until the end of the subject&#39;s life because they might choose to get <br/>
a degree at age 30 or 40 or 60. But then again that wouldn&#39;t even <br/>
prove anything since many people choose to get degrees later and <br/>
later (my DH didn&#39;t start college until 10 years after high school - <br/>
he didn&#39;t go until he found something he was interested in and chose <br/>
to pursue via a college path). Lucrative career paths? Nope again <br/>
since not all choose that path - some choose to start businesses or <br/>
explore other types of options. Plus, even those today who have done <br/>
the high GPA, good college, advanced degree &#39;hoops&#39; are out looking <br/>
for work, waiting tables, doing data entry, etc - stuff happens. <br/>
<br/>
Notice the words choice, choose, and option that appear repeatedly. <br/>
That&#39;s because each person in the family (parents too) are choosing <br/>
their own path through life, not following the &#39;good grade, college, <br/>
career&#39; path. How does one measure joy?<br/>

higher grades, more college degrees, early graduation, taller, <br/>
faster, etc. Anecdotal eveidence is all there is when you are <br/>
looking at a life being lived. Perhaps in two or three generations <br/>
when there are children of children who have never set foot in a <br/>
classroom *involuntarily*, it might be possible to notice general <br/>
trends (maybe there will be a visible mushrooming of writers, <br/>
painters, athletes, who were all unschooled but that isn&#39;t something <br/>
we can see in the now). One of the problems of this kind of <br/>
measuring is that you aren&#39;t measuring just one thing as you would <br/>
with looking at GPAs or SAT scores. What unschooling looks like is <br/>
as different as each person, each family, that is living it. <br/>
<br/>
This might not be a perfect illustration (and I ask forgiveness <br/>
ahead of time for the comparison I&#39;m about to make) but maybe it&#39;ll <br/>
help: did you ever watch one of the big dog shows (like the <br/>
Westminster Kennel Club show)? One of the things that they <br/>
repeatedly mention when doing best in class judging is that the dogs <br/>
are not compared to one &#39;perfect&#39; hypothetical dog but to their <br/>
individual breed standard - how close is this particular German <br/>
Shepherd a &#39;perfect&#39; example of German Shepherd; this collie to <br/>
the &#39;perfect&#39; collie; and so on. The one that is the closest to <br/>
their particular breed standard, wins. Now, to move it to our <br/>
unschooled kids - rather than being compared to other people <br/>
(different &#39;breeds&#39;), we are &#39;judging&#39; our kids based on their <br/>
individual &#39;breed&#39; and guess what? They are exactly 100% perfect <br/>
examples of themselves! Isn&#39;t that wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s why you&#39;ll never &#39;quantify&#39; unschooling - it&#39;s as unique <br/>
as a fingerprint.<br/>

As a dog show judge, I really liked this, Deb!<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a very hard concept for people new to dog shows (much less the uninitiated!) to <br/>
understand. We&#39;re not comparing collies to schnauzers or even collies to collies. The <br/>
comparison is to a written standard (always including the intangibles!), NOT to one another!<br/>

studies of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation.  I think this speaks <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-176181431">There have been no formal studies of unschoolers, as you probably already  <br/>
knew, because in the greater population unschoolers are a very small segment, we <br/>
 can&#39;t all agree what makes someone an &quot;unschooler&quot; anyway (even on this <br/>
list,  really), and the people who tend to fund this kind of thing don&#39;t care. The <br/>
 people DOING it know it works and don&#39;t need studies.<br/>
 <br/>
That said, you want measurements and evidence that authentic learning takes  <br/>
place. <br/>
Julian, who is 16, has unschooled since he completed the third grade. To  me, <br/>
that means that since he was 7 years old, he has not been forced to read,  <br/>
write, study, or learn anything he didn&#39;t want to. In addition, we do not have  <br/>
required chores, we do not punish, he does not have a bedtime, etc. <br/>
 <br/>
My information on Julian is clearly anecdotal rather than scientific,  <br/>
because we don&#39;t have a control Julian. (If we did we&#39;d probably feel sorry for  the <br/>
control Julian and start unschooling him, so it&#39;d mess up the  research.<br/>
 <br/>
The main way all homeschoolers know their kids are learning is they talk to  <br/>
them. Even the ones who test and have assignments can tell their kids are  <br/>
learning without them. They just worry about it or are required by state  <br/>
authorities to test. Julian knows stuff. Lots and lots of stuff. Lots that I  don&#39;t <br/>
know. And I&#39;m wicked sharp.<br/>
 <br/>
Some of the Impressive Stuff that Julian has done:<br/>
1. When he had just turned 14 he took a Harvard Extension course called  <br/>
Evolution and Society. He took it because he thought it sounded interesting. He  <br/>
was required each week to read 200-300 pages of primary source material  <br/>
consisting mostly of pre-Darwin era science and religion writing. Because he had  <br/>
not been in school, he was hindered by not having learned to skim long, boring  <br/>
reading, but he did fine. He had also not spent years learning to write  <br/>
papers...in fact, when he left school he hated writing and had written almost  <br/>
nothing until this course. The course required several lengthy argument papers,  <br/>
which we coached him through (the mechanics, not the content--HE knew what  <br/>
needed to be in them, we didn&#39;t.) He did the most participating in class  <br/>
discussions. The next youngest student was 21. Most were taking it for graduate  <br/>
credit. He earned a B+.<br/>
2. Julian is a committed musician, and works on his music for up to hours a  <br/>
day. He takes guitar and voice lessons weekly. He is planning to teach himself <br/>
 to play the bass.<br/>
3. Julian spent a year and a half working weekly at a local food pantry,  <br/>
eventually training other volunteers. The Director told me that he was the best,  <br/>
most reliable volunteer he had.<br/>
4. This fall Julian got a job as a Coordinator of Religious Education at a  <br/>
UU church, a job that had been intended for an adult. He plans curriculum,  <br/>
worship, etc. for the program, and works with many volunteers.<br/>
5. He is presently taking an online Marine Biology course through the  <br/>
University of CA at Dominguez Hills.<br/>
6. He often teaches things like Beginning guitar and making  chainmaille to <br/>
children and adults.<br/>
7. He writes extremely well, both creatively and more traditional  papers.<br/>
8. He has become very adept at doing sound for events, and has created an  <br/>
impressive sound system for himself. <br/>
 <br/>
I could go on and on. These things are cool. What we find cooler is that he  <br/>
has done these things because he loves to and wants to. He did well in his  <br/>
Harvard course because he cared about it, not because he suddenly had become a  <br/>
prodigy. He is also an awesome friend, very kind and caring. He likes his  <br/>
parents. He has an insatiable desire for learning stuff, in lots of areas.<br/>
 <br/>
It is different, and there is emotion and faith, as well as reason and  <br/>
evidence.<br/>

And, since we&#39;re not nuts (okay well...lol) why would we continue <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Learning is certainly measurable.  Johnny can read<br/>

Reading what? Job applications? the next Harry Potter novel? a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really? What are those clearly defined benefits for educational <br/>
outcomes? One of the VPs in our company has no college degree. There <br/>
are plenty of folks with advanced degrees and no job. Is a <br/>
particular education outcome a guarantee of anything? If yes, show <br/>

you could be doing what you choose and getting to where you choose <br/>

read through a bunch of the archives here and on other sites) is <br/>
that those &quot;expectations&quot; are not something we choose to hold our <br/>
kids (or ourselves) to. The only expectations my son has to look at <br/>
are what he expects of himself, not me, not society at large.<br/>

the same place that something that didn&#39;t feel so good, which would <br/>
I choose? that&#39;s pretty much a no-brainer. Before any of this will <br/>
make sense, there needs to be a realization that there&#39;s more than <br/>
one way to anything. Good grades to college to good job are hoops <br/>
that lead to someplace BUT there are other ways to good job AND what <br/>
defines &#39;good job&#39; is variable. Even employers are finding out that <br/>
more money and prestige is not the drawing card it once was. So, if <br/>
a &quot;good job&quot; is variable then the path to get there is also <br/>
variable. And if the path is variable, why would one NOT want to <br/>
take the one that offers the most joy and pleasure along the way?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Better than the approach that I am currently using. Be it<br/>

definitely NOT going to be better than what you are currently doing. <br/>
Another analogy (I know I know lol): some chickens are kept in <br/>
coops, fed scientifically, medicated, and all their eggs are in one <br/>
place and easy to measure and count. Other chickens are free-range <br/>
chickens. They are given some food and water and peck and hunt for <br/>
the rest. They aren&#39;t routinely medicated tomake them bigger or <br/>
produce more, just if they get sick. Their eggs are here and there <br/>
and wherever - sometimes you don&#39;t ever see the eggs even though you <br/>
know they are there somewhere because the chicken is healthy and <br/>
that&#39;s what healthy chickens do. Same with people. You can pop a <br/>
child into a seat, feed them on scientifically designed and approved <br/>
materials for their age, medicate them if necessary to get them to <br/>
sit still and do the material, and it&#39;s easily quantifiable - x <br/>
number of pages, y exercises correct, etc. My son is a free range <br/>
boy. There&#39;s stuff he knows that I have no idea about - I didn&#39;t <br/>
teach it to him. He&#39;ll pop out with a comment along the way that&#39;ll <br/>
amaze me (he was explaining that certain types of armor in a game <br/>
make the character invulnerable - he&#39;s 7 - I didn&#39;t know he knew <br/>
that word nor the definition of it - no vocabulary lists or <br/>
quizzes). Just as I&#39;ve collected tidbits along the way and made <br/>
connections to other things, he is collecting tidbits and making <br/>
connections.<br/>
<br/>

would be hard pressed to measure and test and quantify it. Things <br/>
like self-motivation, curiousity, overall happiness and satisfaction <br/>
and contentment are not things that can be measured except <br/>
subjectively. And if all there is is subjective data, then our <br/>
anecdotal evidence should be quite adequate to that standard.<br/>

&quot; Deci starts from the position that individuals have something <br/>
that can be called a &quot;true self,&quot; and that people wish to act in<br/>
accord with this &quot;true self.&quot; They wish to be autonomous (authentic) <br/>
rather than controlled. If they act autonomously (authentically),<br/>
they are self-motivated. If they act autonomously, they also respect<br/>
others because the &quot;true self&quot; wishes to be related to others (a<br/>
point on which Aristoteles would have agreed, and Thomas Hobbes would<br/>
have strongly disagreed). Deci assumes that human beings are<br/>
cooperative by nature, rather than competitive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So do unschoolers believe that human beings are cooperative by<br/>
nature?<br/>
<br/>
Do they believe that invdividuals have something called a<br/>

<br/>
Do they believe that all individuals are self-motviated?<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t think the poster is interested in unschooling.  I think <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s interested in enlightening a group of misguided/ignorant <br/>

&gt; Maybe he thinks none of us went to public school or college.  <br/>
&gt; Maybe he thinks none of us came from traditional backgrounds.<br/>

think.  Ever think of that?<br/>
<br/>
I have no interest in convicing you that you&#39;re wrong or that there&#39;s<br/>
a better way.  I just want to understand.  Isn&#39;t that one of<br/>
the foundations of unschooling? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208178750">Another good &quot;we have experience&quot; analogy in the world of measurement is the <br/>
idea that mothers NEED to know how much their infants are eating.   Well...   <br/>
He nursed until he fell asleep, my breasts are making more milk, he peed and <br/>
pooped later, and he&#39;s gaining weight.   <br/>
<br/>
No we do NOT need to know how much he had.   It won&#39;t help anything to know <br/>
how much it was.<br/>
<br/>
And honestly, there have been doctors who &quot;required&quot; mothers to pump milk and <br/>
measure it and report how much the baby drank.   STUPID doctors.   (And <br/>
fearful mothers who shouldn&#39;t let doctors own their babies.)    <br/>
<br/>
If you EVER know of a mom who has some reason to need to know how much a baby <br/>
drank, weigh the baby before feeding and after, on a baby scale that shows <br/>
ounces.   (And don&#39;t change the diaper before weighing the second time--output <br/>
was in, just before he put it out.)<br/>
<br/>
Testing to see if a person is learning is &quot;necessary&quot; when the teacher needs <br/>
to justify the salary, when the school needs to justify the grant money, when <br/>
the parents want to decide whether to keep paying the tutor.   It all has to <br/>
do with money.<br/>

Your premise, Michael, that &quot;better&quot; implies some sort of measurably  <br/>
superior outcome, is false.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You may need to look to your own definitions and vocabulary, and yes,  life<br/>
philosophy so that you can ask questions that would make more sense to those<br/>
who have chosen and experienced unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It appears that your definition of learning  (and the need for measuring)<br/>
leans a bit to segregated &quot;academics&quot;.    Or at least to the idea that only<br/>
what is measured can be worthy.     Count your blessings that I don&#39;t<br/>
respond to your claim about being able to  easily measure &quot;Johnny can read<br/>
or he can&#39;t&quot;.   (Clue:  try to digest earlier writing by Herndon or Kozol.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You might also consider asking folks who breastfed their children  &quot;how can<br/>
you know whether they are getting nourishment without first putting the milk<br/>
in a measuring cup or bottle&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I predict you will be disappointed if you seek from this list  either<br/>
scientific proof or a sales pitch that you should unschool **because**  it<br/>
will produce a better schooled product. <br/>

Michael, you joined the list yesterday.     You asked about studies; you <br/>
received responses.<br/>
<br/>
On the side, I sent you links to Joyce&#39;s site, Pam&#39;s, to unschooling.info and <br/>
my site.     If you&#39;re truly interested in unschooling, go to what&#39;s already <br/>
written and read there a while, please.   Keep reading this list for a week or <br/>
so. Then if you have questions and haven&#39;t found other sources, post your <br/>
questions.<br/>

So  unschooling is based on emotion and faith, rather than<br/>
reason and  evidence?<br/>

 <br/>
This list is full of reason and evidence.   FULL of it.<br/>
 <br/>
And so is my life with my kids and my time with other unschooled  kids.  I <br/>
don&#39;t need studies.  I can see it with my own eyes.  <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t have to go to school to learn about gravity.  Nobody had  to show me <br/>
a study. It just is.  I can see it working all around  me.  Same with <br/>
unschooling.  It works.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you live on the moon and gravity is different for you.  If you  left <br/>
school and started hanging with some unschoolers, it would become  obvious to <br/>
you, too.<br/>
