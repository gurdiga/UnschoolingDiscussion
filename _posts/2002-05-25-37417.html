<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978415234"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I just read about, (what I thought) was a great idea although it may not <br/>
&gt;seem so to some of you.  I was reading about a Korean Christian that told <br/>
&gt;about her mother keeping a journal on each of her eight children.  She&#39;d <br/>
&gt;put a picture of each child in and write down all the POSITIVE <br/>
&gt;observations and accomplishments for the month.  At the end of the month <br/>
&gt;the child could read what mother had observed and written for that <br/>
&gt;month.  She said it was such an exciting time at the end of the month to <br/>
&gt;get to read it.  Mother never put in the negative things or failures of <br/>
&gt;any kind. Just positive.<br/>
&gt;What do some of you think of this idea??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like it.  I think I might start doing something like it, in a less formal <br/>
way.  I have a kid who tends to think he&#39;s not good at a lot of things <br/>
(other than sports).  He gets a lot of positive strokes about his athletic <br/>
successes.  I think it might help him if I document some of his other <br/>
successes that might not be as obvious to him.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962167438">I like this idea for my 13 year old.  I think that we often have far<br/>
to much negativity with our teens.  It is a time when they need as<br/>
much positive as they can get.  Thanks for relating it to us.<br/>
