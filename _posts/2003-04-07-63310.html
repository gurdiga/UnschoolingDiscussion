 You guys are really busy trying to school each other while your children are<br/>
 benefitting from your distraction.  Who can read all these emails and still<br/>
 have time to be with the greatest treasure in the world? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is an incredibly rude assumption.<br/>
I get the emails in digest form and I can quickly scan through many posts in <br/>
a very short time and respond just as quickly.<br/>
At the moment, all of MY treasures are asleep. Blissfully, peacefully <br/>
sleeping. I have worked out, checked email and will be showered before they <br/>
are even up.<br/>
How rude to assume we would short our children in any way because we are here <br/>
trying to help other people have better lives.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
