&gt; &gt;We need to administer 600 hours/year of homeschooling<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is this a guideline or does it say it has to be documented hours?  You can <br/>
&gt; always say you administer 600 hours per year.  With all the field trips and <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; videos and museums/parks/conversations/activities of daily living that you <br/>
&gt; help with etc etc...that would not be an untruth.  Sometimes you have to <br/>
&gt; really read the regulations and watch how they are worded.  If it says <br/>
&gt; documented hours then how does it say it must be documented.  etc.<br/>
&gt; I agree that a local support group might be of some help, but sometimes <br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; parents do not know the laws well either.<br/>

Well as an unschooler you can can keep track of the hours and <br/>
examples of your children&#39;s play. Way more fun and just as valid <br/>
(more so IMHO) as far as learning goes.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, if it says documented hours and journaling is OK than that should <br/>
not be a problem.  You just need to keep a log of what you do during the day <br/>
and maybe throw in a few &quot;schooly&quot; terms once in a while.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people do not see  the value in play.  But you don&#39;t need to use that <br/>
word.  Like the mom with the see saw you could journal it that as <br/>
science/math exploration with balance.  Or baking becomes practice with <br/>
fractions.  Probably not good examples but do you get my meaning?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to keep track but you may have to translate some of the things <br/>
your children do into &quot;schooly&quot; terms.  Not change what your children do.<br/>
