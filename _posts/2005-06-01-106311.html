<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087505670"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I talked to him about degradation of women, about <br/>
creating unhealthy <br/>
and<br/>
unreasonable expectations in marriages, and that <br/>
normal sex wasn&#39;t <br/>
like that.<br/>
He said &quot;Well, DUH, mom!&quot; I said some people  were<br/>
messed up by WANTING <br/>
it<br/>
to be. He seemed surprised that that could  happen.<br/>
<br/>
I told him that some of those who are filmed are not<br/>
quite  volunteers <br/>
and<br/>
told him two stories, one of the mom of girls his age<br/>
he&#39;s  known his <br/>
whole<br/>
life,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my son first got Vice City, (he was 9?) from his<br/>
Dad, and I saw it, the first scene I saw was a guy,<br/>
the hero, walking along the beach, punching out women<br/>
in bikinis who kept walking up to him.<br/>
I told him the following: many women who might<br/>
approach a man in public with the intention of<br/>
proposing a trade of sex for money are probably single<br/>
moms trying to feed their kids. If you&#39;re not<br/>
interested, an appropriate response might be no thank<br/>
you, not punching them out. (I didn&#39;t go into all the<br/>
permutations and exceptions) This seemed to work. He<br/>
didn&#39;t develop a habit of punching out naked women in<br/>
videogames.<br/>
