<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794066214">Hi, <br/>
    I&#39;m new to the group. Been reading for a few days. Mostly very intelligent conversation about useful topics. More than I have been able to say about anyone for a while.<br/>
I just wanted to throw in some noise and see what falls out.<br/>
<br/>
First a question: Does anyone have interest in, or know of, small-scale home (or un-) school vocational apprenticeships (machining, electronics, farming, woodworking, etc.)?<br/>
<br/>
My little rant: Yes, you can reduce a bureaucracy, by making them unnecessary. The unschoolers set an example of this by scaring the hell out of ps&#39;s. The more local a task can be accomplished, the less bureaucracy  (can I abbrev as bcy?) is needed, and it eventually will dry up due to lack of perceived need and funding. Another example would be roads and bridges. If local governments take care of broken bridges without fed funding (adhering to safe practices, of course), then you don&#39;t have to send money to someone to make a decision to send money back. <br/>
<br/>
Being in Wisconsin, (a negative balance fed dollars state) we are very aware that the only net product we receive from the fed government is promises and regulations.<br/>
<br/>
There are hardly ever simple answers, but real solutions are almost always reducible to simple tasks. In this case, it is &quot;Buy local, buy only what you need.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know of an organization that might match you up, but if you&#39;re<br/>
creative you might find something on your own.  <br/>
When my friend&#39;s daughter expressed an interest in becoming a vet, she<br/>
found a vet in their area willing to have her come in and learn while<br/>
helping out.  She was fourteen at the time and has now been there two<br/>
years.  <br/>
<br/>
I found geologic field work for my nine year old on a hobby shop bulletin<br/>
board.  The local rock hounding club meeting schedule was posted there. <br/>
Several members of the club were geologists and one helped my son get a<br/>
job monitoring a seismic site.  He collects soil, water and vegetation<br/>
samples and writes reports about once every three months.  <br/>
<br/>
I also called a university in another town to ask about field work and<br/>
found cut worm population monitoring available in the spring.  He will<br/>
have a territory of approximately a hundred miles ( I&#39;ll do the driving )<br/>
and he will have to set and monitor cut worm traps and write reports.  <br/>
<br/>
I would just start asking everyone, everywhere.  Lumber mills, cabinet<br/>
makers, machine shops,  news stations, hobby shops, museums, whatever.<br/>
Ask librarians, they know everyone. Call the universities, talk to<br/>
program directors. Sorry I don&#39;t have better advice, maybe someone else<br/>
will think of something.  <br/>

 First a question: Does anyone have interest in, or know of, small-scale<br/>
home (or un-) school vocational apprenticeships (machining, electronics,<br/>
farming, woodworking, etc.)?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pete- I dont know what the original title for this was because it came to<br/>
me as Digest Number something-or-other. Some starting points (some of these<br/>
are schools, but they arent huge institutions and theyre outside of the<br/>
mainstream):<br/>
<br/>
When I was 16 (19 years ago) I did a farm apprenticeship on a small family<br/>
farm through the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA).<br/>
Dont know whether this still exists.<br/>
<br/>
In college (about 15 years ago) I did an internship in draft animals (mostly<br/>
oxen) and early American farm machinery at the Tillers Small Farm Program,<br/>
Kalamazoo Nature Center, Kalamazoo, Michigan. Visitors came to see - some of<br/>
them were Africans looking to introduce these methods to areas in Africa<br/>
where draft animals are not yet used. Another intern built a log cabin<br/>
single-handedly, with hand tools, while I was there.<br/>
<br/>
You can make a working solar oven, capable of cooking full meals, out of<br/>
cardboard, aluminum foil and glass. Ive taught workshops in State and City<br/>
Parks using info from the online Solar Cooking Archives at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://solarcooking.org">http://solarcooking.org</a><br/>
<br/>
Habitat for Humanity might be  a good place to learn building skills. They<br/>
build houses in partnership with low-income people in the U.S. and abroad.<br/>
(They need other kinds of help more than swinging a hammer, though  all the<br/>
volunteers want to do that! Also, theyre mostly Christian and when I<br/>
volunteered briefly for them years ago in Americus, Georgia, they would send<br/>
you abroad only if you were religious  any religion, but it had to be a<br/>
religion. You could volunteer in the U.S. without professing any faith.)<br/>
<br/>
Shelter Institute and the Yestermorrow School are examples of owner/builder<br/>
schools. Pop that into a search engine, or see a Department of Energy<br/>
listing at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eren.doe.gov/consumerinfo/refbriefs/t311.html.">http://www.eren.doe.gov/consumerinfo/refbriefs/t311.html.</a> These<br/>
places focus on energy-efficient, easy-to-build structures.<br/>
<br/>
The voluntary simplicity movement (try this in a search engine) might be a<br/>
good place to find people versed in the truly basic skills (not all of<br/>
them rural, but having to do with intelligently using your money and other<br/>
resources).<br/>
<br/>
Real Goods, in Hopland, California, is a company that sells alternative<br/>
energy supplies and that is connected to a non-profit organization that<br/>
teaches workshops on how to build straw-bale houses (dont give me the joke<br/>
about the big, bad wolf  some straw-bale houses have been standing for over<br/>
a hundred years), use solar and wind energy, do permaculture gardening, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Other things to try in a search engine are Intermediate Technology<br/>
Publications (inspired by Schumacher, who wrote Small Is Beautiful and<br/>
Small is Possible), the Electric Shoe Company (which is developing a shoe<br/>
that recharges a special kind of battery using the pressure exerted on the<br/>
sole in walking), and the book Understanding Pedal Power (you can rig up a<br/>
stationary bike to power a radio, TV, etc.) Dont have the time to get the<br/>
links right now. If anybody else does, please post.<br/>
<br/>
Agricultural extension services like the 4-H might be worth a look. Hmm,<br/>
wooden boatbuilding schools are another category.<br/>
<br/>
Ill add more ideas if I think of them. The range is endless and the time is<br/>
now. (Why are we bombing Afghanistan? Doesnt it have something to do with<br/>
oil? What if we harnessed the energy of youth  not to mention our own - to<br/>
the task of finding ways to overcome our dependence on oil? Wouldnt that<br/>
free us to work on the problem of peace?)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my husband is looking to work in something like this. Right now<br/>
hes the manager of a consumer electronics store in Manhattan belonging to a<br/>
major corporation that shall remain nameless. We want out. If anybody has<br/>
any job leads for us (Im mostly busy with our two-year-old and writing a<br/>
book on attachment parenting, but I could maybe work part-time, too), please<br/>
email me privately. My husbands got a degree in psychology, for what its<br/>
worth, and experience in computers and Greek diners as well as the<br/>
electronics store. Ive mostly done translating and interpreting, writing,<br/>
editing, proofreading, teaching English to adults in Spain, environmental<br/>
ed, and alternative therapy for kids under stress.<br/>
