When I subbed to this list, I thought I&#39;d learn about unschooling and be able to discuss it with others doing the same. It&#39;s not quite what I&#39;d envisioned, however.

Is this typical fare? If subject lines said what it was about, the delete button would be great, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the norm. <br/>

I relish healthy unschooling/homeschooling discussion and debate, so I&#39;m going to hang out a bit longer, but I am curious if it&#39;s always so unfriendly feeling and argumentative? I know not everyone&#39;s posts are of this tone, so maybe it is just the time of year? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385120224">Hi Newbie,<br/>
I&#39;m pretty new too and yes it&#39;s been like this since I joined but after a few weeks of it I&#39;ve learned which posts to delete. There are really only a couple who provoke the BS and most of us quickly learn not to feed them but sometimes one can&#39;t resist the temptation&lt;G&gt; I&#39;ve had one of those days today&lt;BG&gt; Personally I&#39;ve found enough sincere and thought provoking information and ideas to keep me reading. The couple of people who don&#39;t fit in know who they are and the rest of us are hoping that they&#39;ll will run out of steam sometime soon. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good questions Donna. . . I can only answer for myself. I admit to jumping <br/>
into the fracass now and then, having my buttons pushed by something or the <br/>
other. How I do want to show up in the world and on this list is someone who <br/>
can respect all choices. . . do I always do that? Probably not, but it is my <br/>
intent. It would be nice if the fierce arguing and constant need to be right <br/>
would stop, but it doesn&#39;t appear to be slacking off any. My choice is to <br/>
ignore and not respond to those posters anymore. I can&#39;t tell anyone else <br/>
what choice to make or how to post, only choose how I will or will not <br/>
respond. How it all ties in with unschooling for me is in the life I lead for <br/>
my children to see.  If you post something about unschooling which I feel I <br/>
can contribute to, I certainly will. <br/>
<br/>

I cannot judge my own path and SELF, having the knowledge that I have chosen <br/>
to come here to experience these specific issues and grow, learn, and <br/>
Remember Who I Am.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224436586">I&#39;m glad to see there are still newbies coming here and I hope they don&#39;t leave over the few postings that are so hateful. Some of us here like to have debates and listen to all sides of an issue... what a great way to learn and grow. Most seem to be able to do this and not feel they have to convert anyone or even beat a dead horse over some things. Others (it takes two to tango, so I&#39;m not singling one person here... there are more that keep this ball rolling) seem to be upset all the time about one thing or another. In fact, it nearly shut down the list (imo.. that was what I thought would happen) but luckily, it didn&#39;t. <br/>
Lovemary has a good point... ignoring these kinds of posts is the best response, although I know it&#39;s sometimes hard to do. But, if we don&#39;t get a grip here, there won&#39;t *be* much of a list what with a few people promoting other ones to jump over to... this one could die out. I, for one, won&#39;t let a few bickering bickersons run me off but I *will* ignore posts from particular posters whose style is defensive. They may not change subject lines, but the names will be there and that&#39;ll be enough to make me use the delete button. I&#39;m hoping others will do the same!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798298031">For the first couple of months I gave it the benefit of the &quot;time of year&quot; doubt. Subject lines are maybe not so informative, but you may find after a while you can set a couple of automatic filters on your software and not read messages from those posters you find fairly consistently you&#39;d be better off without.<br/>
