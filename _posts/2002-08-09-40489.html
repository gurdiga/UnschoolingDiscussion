<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138134617"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;How many people do you figure Christianity has killed?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;It&#39;s too hard to tell. The figures between the crusades, inquisitions, and <br/>
&gt;&gt;witch burnings combined range from the 100,000&#39;s to 3,000,000.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder what the ratio of people killed to overall population of the times <br/>
would be though? It might make the numbers seem much more powerful to view <br/>
the number killed relative to the number available to kill.<br/>
<br/>
And are there any figures on the people killed in the name of other <br/>
pre-Christianity religions, say Judaism, Shinto or Buddhism? Just curious.<br/>
<br/>

in my stacks for the life of me.<br/>
<br/>
I really want to bow out from the list, because the off topics are not part <br/>
of the program, and I am bordering on being tacky. Well sh**, I&#39;m already <br/>
that, but I really find it embarrassing if people are bothered by it, <br/>
especially the list moderator, and Mrs. Hegener, lord bless her.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t me going home with my marbles. Just me trying my darndest to not <br/>
remain an a**hole forever. Antagonizing bright women seems to have been my <br/>
cross to bare. Something my single and desperate Mother had to put up with <br/>
for far too long. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, I once accidentally on purpose dropped the book &quot;Why Men Rule&quot; <br/>
in her lap, and in her usual fashion she said, &quot;Bobby, don&#39;t be an a**hole.&quot; <br/>
She said the same back in 1968 when she named our black cat Malcom X, and I <br/>
told her it might not be the most savory of names in the white suburbs of <br/>
Chicago. &quot;Bobby, don&#39;t be an a**hole.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really wanna stop being an a**hole.<br/>
