<div id="ygrps-yiv-747606598">Hi to everyone and especially Zan!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for quite awhile.  We live in rural southern Oklahoma and my only child, 4 yo girl, will start public school this fall...if I let her.  I&#39;m a former teacher myself and have strong misgivings about our schools.  I&#39;ve been really struggling with the idea of homeschooling/unschooling.  One of my primary problems is that, like Zan&#39;s experience in Indiana, all HS groups here are faith based.  Now, I would nominally call myself a Christian...but I was raised in Oregon (need I say more?!?) and my ideals/beliefs are so liberal, I don&#39;t fit in anywhere.  In fact, I&#39;m more buddhist than anything.  Needless to say, I will NOT sign a faith statement.  Zan, I read your post about feeling on the fringe and it is a comment I make to my husband so much.  I&#39;ve lived here 6 years and can find NO ONE to relate to.  Finding this group online a few months ago has been such a good thing for me.  Until then, I had no concept that anyone other than fundamental Christians wanted to avoid the public schools.<br/>
<br/>
So here I struggle, with a headstrong daughter who undertook this summer to teach herself the alphabet.  She is also far, FAR too sensitive to the ridicule of her classmates (she&#39;s been in part time daycare since 11 months because, unfortunately, I MUST work...for now).  It&#39;s the sessions of comforting her after picking her up, trying to convince her that even though Johnny told her we didn&#39;t love her, it wasn&#39;t true.  And even though Susie said her clothes were stupid (she takes great pride in dressing herself...sometimes in *interesting* outfits), they were okay if SHE liked them.<br/>
<br/>
I must admit...I&#39;m just scared that I don&#39;t have the ability to properly teach her.  I know it&#39;s my former teacher indoctrination...but still...Anyway, I&#39;m so glad to hear all of your successes on this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137386129">Hi Cat!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sad to hear that you struggle with the same issues as I do.  But I must<br/>
say that I see the choice to unschool separate from the problems with my own<br/>
&quot;socialization&quot;  (yucky word!) If I never met another person who homeschools<br/>
or unschools I would still have my children at home learning in their own<br/>
special ways.  I beleive in it that much, that all in all I don&#39;t NEED the<br/>
support, I just WANT it.  Don&#39;t let other&#39;s closed-minds deter you from<br/>
choosing what you see as right for your child.  Trust me, I speak from<br/>
experience.  I did put my kids back in PS(once for a year and once for a few<br/>
months), it was a mistake that left &quot;scars&quot; on their learning styles. Now<br/>
they have been home for 2 years and I wouldn&#39;t change it for the world<br/>
(unless they insisted).<br/>
I have to say that I am very lucky, my dh is extremely supportive and he is<br/>
my closest and dearest friend.  He&#39;s the only one I can truly trust to give<br/>
support in this and all endeavors.  Regardless of all my &quot;fringe&quot; ways he<br/>
loves me (as a matter of fact I think he loves me because of my fringe ways)<br/>
haha<br/>
<br/>
Well I am sorry I can&#39;t say more now, it is friday and fridays are very busy<br/>
around here. I haven&#39;t even gotten dressed yet! AHHHHH!<br/>
Thank you for posting, your post got me thinking and has made me realize<br/>
that I am lucky, maybe not in all areas of my life, but in the most<br/>
important areas.<br/>
I wish you the best in making these important decisions.<br/>
Zan<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927337195">hey cat!<br/>
  i was in your shoes as well! i live in the south and have mostly bible <br/>
belter around me. i have alot of different views but whenever i say my views <br/>
most people give me an odd look. see i believe that every religon must have <br/>
some value or so many wouldn&#39;t follow them. and who am i to say which way is <br/>
the right way, that&#39;s not my place and religous freedom is what our country <br/>
was founded on.  anyway when i first thought of hsing i thought you could <br/>
only do it if you had religous reasons, then i did some research, and found <br/>
some groups. i can&#39;t begin to tell you the difference hsing has made in our <br/>
lives. we are lucky enough to have a good group here that isn&#39;t based on <br/>
religon, but we walk to a different beat and mostly do things with <br/>
ourselves.but i have really enjjoyed having our hs group especially when i <br/>
have questions about nc or our county. have you ever thought of starting your <br/>
own group. go to educational stores and put out flyers about what you would <br/>
like to achieve. it may just take off before you know it!!!!<br/>
