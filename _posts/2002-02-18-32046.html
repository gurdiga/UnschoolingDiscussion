<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075041917">HI, BONNIE!<br/>
<br/>
Do you have the following resources?  They have oodles of info in them for a <br/>
variety of interests/subjects.  Music, your particular interest, have <br/>
several offerings to be found in these bookis:<br/>
<br/>
1)  &quot;Homeschooling Your Child for Free...Resources for Home Education on the <br/>
Internet and Beyond,&quot;  by LauraMaery Gold & Joan M. Zielinski, ISBN <br/>
0-7615-2513-0.  CHAPTER 9 deals exclusively with music.<br/>
<br/>
2)  &quot;The First Year of Homeschooling Your Child,&quot;  by Linda Dobson, ISBN <br/>
0-7615-2788-5 has lots of info in the back.  &quot;Thousands of Free Step-by-Step <br/>
Tutorials:  http://www.learn2.com&quot;  was listed on pg. 284.  I haven&#39;t <br/>
checked this out, yet.<br/>
<br/>
3)  &quot;Homeschooling Almanac 2002-2003,&quot;  by Mary & Michael Lepert, ISBN <br/>
0-7615-2856-3.  Chapter on Music Programs and Materials.  Lots of CD Roms, <br/>
audiocassettes, in case you don&#39;t find what you&#39;re looking for online right <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a great &quot;happened-to-find&quot;  book at Borders Outlet for $2.99:<br/>
<br/>
4)  &quot;Good Music, Brighter Children,&quot;  by Sharlene Habermeyer.  Page 296 <br/>
lists many internet sources for music information, etc..  Haven&#39;t finished <br/>
reading the book, yet, and I haven&#39;t checked out the internet soruces listed <br/>
therein.  Looks like an absolute goldmine with over 50 listings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;M CURIOUS AS TO HOW OLD YOUR CHILD/REN ARE.  MY SON IS 9 1/2 YEARS OLD AND <br/>
LOVES TO DANCE, AND HE CREATES MUSIC ON THE COMPUTER WITH HIS &quot;SIM TUNES&quot;  <br/>
SOFTWARE, but he&#39;s not yet interested in learning how to play an instrument.<br/>
<br/>
WOULD YOU PLEASE PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK, ONCE YOU&#39;VE CHECKED OUT SOME OF <br/>
THESE RESOURCES?  You could help save me some time, too!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and Splendid Sunsrises!<br/>

Perhaps constructive ideas about how to make the magazine more <br/>
readable for unschoolers?  Perhaps views of curriculum from an <br/>
unschooler since there was a section for curriculum views.  Perhaps <br/>
ideas of how she can label topics to make them more appealing to <br/>
unschoolers as well as homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I doubt the intent of the magazine was to be sexist, but <br/>
perhaps since some one feels that way they could suggest a title that <br/>
they would feel is more inclusive?<br/>
<br/>
There is a big difference between CONSTRUCTIVE criticism and <br/>
criticism.  It seemed as though the poster was asking for the former <br/>
and would probably be helped more by it as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700625971">It is well organized.  I would find it more useful if there were an <br/>
unschooling area.  Maybe you could add a section for unschoolers or <br/>
work on the subheadings to include unschooling &quot;ways&quot;.  Like under <br/>
schedules, you could add a subheading for people who do not use <br/>
shedules.<br/>

a good craft project because my kids were asking for one, I would <br/>
like to be able to click on a section labelled &quot;crafts&quot; instead of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823091509">The post you quoted of mine was in response to another post NOT to the<br/>
website. I was simply commenting on teh post. Just thoughts that came out of<br/>
my head regarding unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As to someone making a HOME/UNschooling magazine, it was a homeschooling<br/>
one. It struck me as strange that they would want comments on such a<br/>
structured/ classified type of method from unschoolers. I asked because<br/>
maybe they don&#39;t really understand unschooling. Maybe they DO want to<br/>
incorporate unschooling ideas into the magazine. I was kind of wondering<br/>
where to start.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;?  If a new unschooler was concerned<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;about reading (a very common concern) where would they look?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about the unschooling.com boards? ;o&gt;<br/>
This was not an unschooling magazine.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or, would it be so wrong to title a section<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;language arts, knowing that under it there could be a topic about<br/>
&gt;children learning to read at their own pace along with other topics<br/>
&gt;concerning grammar, reading, etc? &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For unschoolers I think it would be so wrong. because it is still<br/>
categorizing learning which can be detrimental to true learning. Again,<br/>
schools do this to better quantify and qualify what students are &quot;taught&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I may have come across abruptly, and apologize to the magazine editor for<br/>
that. I didn&#39;t mean to. She hasn&#39;t seemed to object to my questions though.<br/>
Why are *you* so annoyed with me?<br/>

you want both audiences, I think there should be an option on the home <br/>
site.<br/>

*Homeschoolers Enter Here<br/>
<br/>
Within each of the second pages would be classifications. Some could <br/>
overlap. Things like structure, schedule and cirriculum would not. The <br/>
unschooling one would say things like:<br/>
un-cirruculum, unschooling schools, etc.<br/>

If you don&#39;t want both audiences, then its laid out quite well at it is.<br/>

I tend to agree that labelling areas of learning assist in the process.  My <br/>
filing cabinet contains folders labeled &quot;music,&quot;  &quot;the natural world,&quot;  <br/>
&quot;compassion education,&quot;  &quot;robotics,&quot; and, yes, &quot;language arts,&quot;  etc.  The <br/>
language arts folder might contain ideas that I picked up from magazines, <br/>
books, other at-home-schoolers/ unschoolers, creative writing ideas, pen pal <br/>
lists, thank you notes...some inspired by my son, some by me.  They are <br/>
there so that we can find them when we&#39;d like to, but also to refresh our <br/>
tired minds when inspiration just isn&#39;t flowing and we&#39;re &quot;bored.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Before I &quot;organized&quot;  my materials, some were in folders, some in the <br/>
envelopes the catalogs came in, and yet others were in crates or in piles on <br/>
the floor.  I could rarely put my hands on that particular thing that I knew <br/>
I had when I really wanted/needed it.<br/>
<br/>
In the last month, since my filing cabinet and new bookshelf arrived (and I <br/>
took the time to label and categorize my material, providing each a &quot;home&quot;), <br/>
my life has become much less stressful and I am better able to utilize my <br/>
time - with my son, or in other ways, instead of searching my piles for <br/>
material to follow through on an inspiration we might be lucky enough to <br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just a few days old on this list and I admit to feeling as if I&#39;ve been <br/>
chastised at least a couple of times for using language that others did not <br/>
feel fit the &quot;unschooling&quot;  mold.  (I&#39;m not oblivious to the fact that my <br/>
feeling of being chastised might be me mucking around in my own issues, too) <br/>
  Anyway, I&#39;m doing my best to unlearn my way out of old convention - a baby <br/>
doesn&#39;t just stand up and start to run - there is a process of learning, of <br/>
trying and failing, of testing the waters and, perhaps, making different <br/>
choices.  It takes a while to build up the strength, stamina, coordination, <br/>
and determination to tackle the awesome task of walking, and then running.  <br/>
It comes most easily with gentle persuasion and encouragement and providing <br/>
a safe environment for the learner to feel comfortable and secure enough to <br/>
proceed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not directing this comment to anyone in particular, just expressing <br/>
myself as a newcomer.  We&#39;re all in this forum for one reason or another, <br/>
and I imagine we are all making that choice on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
I understand how people can be misunderstood when suffering a clear <br/>
disadvantage of not being physically present and/or at least a telephone <br/>
interaction where body language and/or voice inflection can provide <br/>
meaningful clues as to the intent behind the message conveyed.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve got to run.  A client is due and I leave this post somewhat <br/>
anxious that I&#39;m not taking more time to review before sending, but I hope <br/>
the &quot;heart&quot;  in the message speaks kindly and no offense is taken.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: Hi Homeschool Mums!<br/>
&gt;Date: Fri, 22 Feb 2002 21:34:16 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;?  If a new unschooler was concerned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;about reading (a very common concern) where would they look?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; How about the unschooling.com boards? ;o&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And would there be a title to certain areas to direct me to them?<br/>
&gt;Seems I recall there are such titles there....History, Math, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Or, would it be so wrong to title a section<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;language arts, knowing that under it there could be a topic about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;children learning to read at their own pace along with other topics<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;concerning grammar, reading, etc? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For unschoolers I think it would be so wrong. because it is still<br/>
&gt; &gt; categorizing learning which can be detrimental to true learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, the titles at unschooling.com, which you recomended and<br/>
&gt;categorize learning, would be detrimental?  I am sorry, but perhaps I<br/>
&gt;am just not following what you mean.  It seemed you objected to<br/>
&gt;classifying something as language arts.  How would you organize a<br/>
&gt;website without a title to direct a person to a certain area?  Do you<br/>
&gt;have a suggestion for the site owner on a way to title the sections<br/>
&gt;to make them more comfortable to unschoolers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Again,<br/>
&gt; &gt; schools do this to better quantify and qualify what students are<br/>
&gt;&quot;taught&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And a website would do it for organization so people would be able to<br/>
&gt;go directly to what they are interested in.  And some unschoolers do<br/>
&gt;it because they have to meet state requirements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I may have come across abruptly, and apologize to the magazine<br/>
&gt;editor for<br/>
&gt; &gt; that. I didn&#39;t mean to. She hasn&#39;t seemed to object to my questions<br/>
&gt;though.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why are *you* so annoyed with me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not annoyed with YOU, nothing personal.  It was JMO that adding<br/>
&gt;something constructive might benefit the original poster more so than<br/>
&gt;just saying it was not unschooling.  It seemed the responses were<br/>
&gt;negative and abrupt, which did not seem very helpful, IMO.  Simple as<br/>
&gt;that.<br/>

you yourself said you may have been abrupt, which I thought was a <br/>

I used the term. <br/>
Seeing the posts as negative was subjective and I could have read <br/>

responsible for communicating it in an understandable way and must <br/>
take their audience into consideration if they want to be <br/>
understood.  If one were intending to be helpful, then it seems <br/>
logical that one would need to consider their audience even more.  A <br/>
little more difficult on email, but entirely possible if one <br/>
remembers the people at the other end are real w/thoughts and <br/>
feelings.  You said you were asking a question, yet it was worded as <br/>
a statement.  Had it been a question, I would not have thought it <br/>
negative.  Posting style differences?  Perhaps, yet when on a list <br/>
where not everyone personally knows each other it seems, as posters, <br/>
we should consider how others might read what we write.  While <br/>
posting style differences do exist, it is my opinion that <br/>
consideration when posting for how others read things could go a long <br/>
way to improving communication.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961156156">I think it would be helpful to separate out all the arguments since they&#39;re<br/>
getting tangled up together ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Whether categories are useful or not is moot when the *real* question is<br/>
whether the site will bring people back.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if someone were looking for reading ideas it would be helpful<br/>
to know where to go on the site. But that&#39;s assuming the people are already<br/>
returning on a regular basis. But what will bring them in the first place?<br/>
And what will keep them coming back to that particular site out of all the<br/>
other sites on the internet?<br/>
<br/>
So, if you were looking for reading ideas, would the first site you thought<br/>
of be *this* site? No, regardless of how useful or not categories are, the<br/>
site doesn&#39;t offer anything that can&#39;t be found in thousands of other<br/>
places. Organization isn&#39;t the key that will bring people back but unique<br/>
offerings.<br/>
<br/>
And *which* people does the author want to come back? All homeschoolers? The<br/>
content is way too skimpy. (Check out Ann Zeise&#39;s site<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/</a> for something that has mass appeal.<br/>
In other words a site needs to be massive to have mass appeal.). All NZ<br/>
homeschoolers? There isn&#39;t enough NZ specific content (laws, NZ offerings<br/>
and such). The Homeschool Association of California<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org/chaos2confidence.html">http://www.hsc.org/chaos2confidence.html</a> website is a good example.<br/>
<br/>
The setup *seems* to be offering a small corner on the web for a group of<br/>
women who are drawn by something about the site that calls to them. So far<br/>
the only unique thing may be a feeling a kinship with the label &quot;New Zealand<br/>
Homeschooling Mum&quot; where they&#39;d feel they were likely to get to hang out<br/>
with others who also shared that feeling of kinship with the label.<br/>
<br/>
So the question is, what would a &quot;New Zealand Homeschooling Mum&quot; like to<br/>
find *on the site* once they find *each other*? So first you have to get<br/>
them there. (Give some group - &quot;New Zealand Homeschooling Mum&quot;s if that&#39;s<br/>
what you&#39;re going for -- a place that they feel they can identify with.)<br/>
Then you need to provide the content that will keep them returning. If you<br/>
can figure out what it is they want, then they will come to meet each other<br/>
and stick around. (A message board or email list might be helpful.)<br/>

I see a difference between a folder labled &quot;Robotics&quot; and one <br/>
labeled &quot;Language Arts&quot;. Robotics is a specific area of interest, <br/>
it&#39;s like us putting comic books together or playmobil stuff <br/>
together, so we can find it later. Language Arts is huge, and I see <br/>
it more as a tool than a subject. We use reading, speaking, and <br/>
writing (aka language arts) all day long, every day, in many ways to <br/>
do many things. The same with &quot;math&quot; or &quot;history&quot; or &quot;science&quot; - I&#39;d <br/>
stick pretty much everything we own in a language arts folder, if I <br/>
had one...<br/>
