&lt;&lt; Running together Christianity and fundamentalism is like running<br/>
together snakes and venomous  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well when I&#39;m talking about fundamentalist Christians I&#39;m talking about <br/>
venomous snakes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not MY idea or my imagination that fundamentalist Christians don&#39;t <br/>
consider Catholics to be Christians (nor do most of them consider Lutherans <br/>
or Episcopalians, etc. to be &quot;true Christians.&quot;  They teach that they&#39;ll be <br/>
burning in hell with the other heathens unless one of them somehow, against <br/>
his church&#39;s teaching, actually somehow had a personal relationship with <br/>
Jesus and was born again.  But they don&#39;t discuss it as being very likely.<br/>
<br/>
Talking about venomous snakes isn&#39;t the same as talking also at the same time <br/>
about venomous spiders, so the fact that there are also fundamentalist <br/>
Moslems doesn&#39;t apply to the Christian Homeschooling Movement (or Community <br/>
or Faction or Whatever).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can&#39;t we all just get along?&quot; is answered with &quot;*NO* we can&#39;t&quot; by <br/>
fundamentalist Christians before any other Christians.<br/>

<br/>
The 2nd Generation:<br/>
Fortifying and Advancing<br/>
<br/>
-=-A presidential election year, where questions and answers about public and <br/>
foreign policy directed to and from hopeful candidates abound, is the prime <br/>
time for training ourselves and our children in the Biblical position of <br/>
today&#39;s issues. Does the Bible have anything to say to NAFTA, The United <br/>
Nations, or most favored nation status of China? Does the Bible have anything <br/>
to say to welfare reform, Social Security, or national health care? For the <br/>
2nd generation of homeschoolers to advance on the other fronts of attack <br/>
against the family, church, and nation, they must have the answers to these <br/>
questions, they must have them based on the objective truth of God&#39;s Word, <br/>
and they must be able to articulate them convincingly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-To fail to equip our children to give a rational and comprehensive answer <br/>
to the questions is to dress our children for war and send them out with no <br/>
bullets. Their best hope is to be captured and allowed to live as prisoners <br/>
of war. By no means will the complaining and accusations of the unregenerate <br/>
be put to rest short of the final judgement, but that fact does not relieve <br/>
the Christian of his duty to be ready with a reasoned response and, <br/>
therefore, be faithful to equip each succeeding generation of covenant <br/>
children to do the same.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;covenant,&quot; they mean precisely those who believe just as <br/>
they do.<br/>
And by &quot;reasoned&quot; they mean memorized.<br/>
And by &quot;objective&quot; they mean straight from their propaganda.  <br/>
<br/>
I lately got the Christian Book Distrubors catalog (Christianbook.com) and if <br/>
you think they think all Christians are equal, go peek.  The whole paper <br/>
catalog is enough material to fill a house, easily, and there are even action <br/>
figures:  Bibleman, Luxor Spandroth, Biblegirl, Cypher, and El Furioso.  You <br/>
can get videos featuring their adventures.  (page 60 of the catalog, I&#39;m <br/>
certainly not making this up)<br/>
<br/>
They hope to enable Christian homeschooling families to &quot;live apart&quot; meaning <br/>
to be separate from other kinds of people, even from others who &#39;claim&#39; to be <br/>
Christian.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an adverstisement for a wall cross.  Definitely NOT a crucifix:<br/>

<br/>
That doesn&#39;t apply to the Pope.  Or even Canadian Baptists.<br/>
<br/>
They do have a Catholic section, and the http: shows it as a specialty <br/>
subgroup.<br/>
<br/>
They also have a section on Cults.  Specifically  named right on that page:   <br/>
Mormons and Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses.   Here&#39;s a quote from a book review, also <br/>
front page:  &quot;detailed information about how cults twist particular <br/>
scriptures for their own purpose. More importantly, however, this book shows <br/>
why the meanings that cults apply to particular verses are wrong, and why <br/>
they contradict orthodox Christianity. Armed with this knowledge, each and <br/>
every Christian will be able to stand against the arguments offered by <br/>
members of cults as they try to to proselytize us. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are probably anti-Catholic sections in some of those books.  <br/>
Anti-Catholic messages were common in our church when I was growing up.<br/>
<br/>
And now they&#39;re claiming ownership of homeschooling in the U.S.</div>

<br/>
From Heart of Wisdom Homeschool Information site, on Socialization:<br/>
<br/>
What about Socialization?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, homeschool children should have friends. But not just random friends. <br/>
Homeschoolers have the opportunity to for selective socialization. Parents <br/>
can guide their children to other Christian families with like minded morals <br/>
and values. Most home school families I know are are very active with other <br/>
families. There are weekly field trips with support groups, twice a week <br/>
church functions, scouts, choir, weekly skating parties, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
[then there&#39;s a cartoon and some statistics]<br/>
<br/>
What Does God&#39;s Word Say About Who we Socialize With?<br/>
<br/>
The concept of separation from evil is fundamental to God’s relationship with <br/>
His people. According to the Bible, separation evolves two dimensions-one <br/>
negative and one positive:<br/>
<br/>
1.  separating yourself morally and spiritually from sin and everything that <br/>
is contrary to Jesus Christ, righteous and God’s Word.<br/>
2.  drawing near to God in a close intimate fellowship thorough dedication, <br/>
worship and service.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don Stamp commentary explains in the Full Life Bible:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.  In the Old Testament separation was an ongoing requirement for God’s <br/>
people. (Ex 23:24; Lev. 20:22-26; Isa 52:11;) They were expected to be holy, <br/>
different and separated from other peoples in order to belong to God as His <br/>
very own.<br/>
2.  In the New Testament God commanded separation of the believer (a) from <br/>
the corrupt world system and from unholy compromise. (b) from those in church <br/>
who sin and refuse to repent (Mat 7:15; 1Co 5:9-11; 2Th 3:6-15) and from <br/>
false teachers, churches or cults that teach theological error and deny <br/>
Biblical truths (Mat 7:15; Rom 16:17)<br/>
3.  Our attitude in separation must be one of (a) hatred toward sin, <br/>
unrighteousness and the corrupt world system, (b) opposition to false <br/>
doctrine, © genuine love towards whom we must separate. and (d) fear of God <br/>
as we perfect holiness.<br/>
4.  The purpose of separation is that we as God’s people might (a) persevere <br/>
in salvation (1Ti 4:16; Rev 12:14-17), faith (1Ti 1:19; 6:10; 20-21) and <br/>
holiness (Jo 17:14-21; 2Cor 7:1) (b) live wholly for God as our Lord and <br/>
Father (Mat 22:37; 2Co 6:16-18) and convince the unbelieving world of the <br/>
truth and blessings of the gospel (Jn 17:21; Phi. 2:15.)<br/>
5.  If we separate ourselves properly, God Himself rewards us by drawing near <br/>
with His protection, blessing and Fatherly care. He promises to be everything <br/>
a good Father should be. He will be our counselor, guide; He will love and <br/>
cherish us as His own children. (2Cor 6:16-18)<br/>
6.  The refusal of believers to separate themselves from evil will <br/>
inevitability result in loss of fellowship with God (2 Co 6:16), of <br/>
acceptance by the Father (6:17) and of our rights as children (6:18cf. Rom <br/>
8:15-16).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
In an article in the new Home Education Magazine, Liza Sabater was describing <br/>
the package and way of life school becomes for people:   &quot;With school come <br/>
friends and peers; elders and role models; the time for learning and the time <br/>
for doing everything else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As you can see from the separatist information above, That packaged way of <br/>
life is enforced on Christian Homeschoolers, and their &quot;package&quot; is much <br/>
smaller than it would be if the kids were in school.  They DO give their <br/>
children a pre-determined set of friends, peers, elders and role models.<br/>
