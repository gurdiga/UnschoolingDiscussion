<div id="ygrps-yiv-620994710">I&#39;m going to be checking this book out of the library (again) today. We had <br/>
it checked out a little while back, but I read another book by the same <br/>
author (A Mind at a Time) and was more researcing my kids&#39; different <br/>
learning styles, than MY style.<br/>
<br/>
It occured to me this past weekend, that Mel Levine&#39;s basic premise in The <br/>
Myth of Laziness, that there is a mind-type that can&#39;t sustain mental energy <br/>
and it isn&#39;t because of laziness, could very well apply to me. Why else did <br/>
it never even occur to me, all through school, that turning in homework <br/>
would mean getting a grade? I mean, that idea NEVER clicked. I got failing <br/>
grades, and I could NOT figure out why. People, I&#39;m not stupid. Just <br/>
clueless :) Well, part of that was boredom, I think. But part of it was, <br/>
hello? Hand in the STUPID math homework. Duh.<br/>
<br/>
And now, when I would really REALLY like to have my house clean and tidy, <br/>
and I know what needs to be done...the energy just isn&#39;t there, starting <br/>
with the mental energy of making a list of what needs to be done.<br/>
<br/>
Gonna get the book, and GOING TO READ IT.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

&gt;I can relate to your 18 year old son, because I sometimes sit around and <br/>
&gt;think &quot;blah, blahbety blah, I haven&#39;t accomplished anything with my life.&quot;  <br/>
&gt;(I get both distracted easily and tired easily.)  (And washing clothes just <br/>
&gt;*doesn&#39;t* feel like an accomplishment.)  Part of what I struggle with is <br/>
&gt;figuring out which of my interests (or tasks) is most important.  My <br/>
&gt;tendency is to do just a little bit of several things, preferably <br/>
&gt;simultaneously. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A book that I like about learning differences, that includes having <br/>
&gt;scattered mental energy (as one of the learning issues) is Mel Levine&#39;s <br/>
&gt;book -- The Myth of Laziness.  (Heck, just the title might make your son <br/>
&gt;feel better.) </span></blockquote></div>
