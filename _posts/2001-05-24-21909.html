<div id="ygrps-yiv-379116430">A response from Sharon Karpinski:<br/>
<br/>
1. The information about Elsie as recommended literature for Christian<br/>
Homeschoolers came straight off the Net at various Elsie Dinsmore sites<br/>
supported by Christian Homeschoolers.  I added the words &quot;fundamentalist&quot;<br/>
which I believe does describe the form of evangelical Christianity embraced<br/>
by many Christian oriented Homeschoolers. To take it further---if one<br/>
must---I believe they are either Calvinists or Anabaptists but I have not<br/>
researched this.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Obviously, I don&#39;t contend that all Christians are embracing Elsie as<br/>
suitable child reading matter. I&#39;ve no idea where the &quot;all&quot; came from. I&#39;d<br/>
never write it that way because I are one.  I am a practicing Christian who<br/>
does not believe the Elsie books are a good idea 130 years after the fact. <br/>
<br/>
3.  All info about Elsie book plots comes from my personal reading<br/>
experience. I have read Elsie, Elsie&#39;s Holidays at Roseland, Elsie&#39;s<br/>
Girlhood, Elsie&#39;s Children, Elsie&#39;s Widowhood,  Elsie&#39;s New Relations and<br/>
Elsie&#39;s Young Folks. I&#39;m about halfway through Elsie&#39;s Womanhood, which I<br/>
just acquired. And if anybody has any of the Dodd Mead edition Elsie books,<br/>
lemme know. I want them.<br/>
<br/>
4.  I know a number of homeschoolers whose orientation is not primarily<br/>
religious. I lived in northern Calif.  for many years during the height of<br/>
&quot;alternative lifestyle&quot;, e.g. I&#39;m an old hippie.  When my son was a child,<br/>
several of his friends were homeschooled for various reasons (their parents<br/>
believed they could do it better than the local public school, they lived<br/>
in a yurt ten miles up a dirt road impassable much of the year and---my<br/>
personal favorite---the local junior high&#39;s main problem wasn&#39;t even drugs,<br/>
it was prostitution and that girl&#39;s parents couldn&#39;t afford private<br/>
school). I don&#39;t think I am innately prejudiced against homeschoolers<br/>
though, obviously, I could be wrong about that.  <br/>
<br/>
5. Mr. Travilla (Elsie&#39;s husband) forgot to have &quot;obey&quot; removed from the<br/>
marriage vow which is just as well since when Elsie finds out what he<br/>
intended to do, she informs him that she actively wants to obey him, that<br/>
her obedience passes from her father to her husband. Travilla, poor man,<br/>
has been fighting the &quot;obey&quot; thing for twenty years because he thinks his<br/>
friend Horace demands too much of his daughter. Travilla is killled off as<br/>
soon as possible (in book 6). <br/>
<br/>
On the whole, I&#39;m pleased with the responses that you&#39;ve sent (and do send<br/>
more, even the condemnatory ones---the loyal opposition always reveals much<br/>
about themselves when on the attack) because I thought what I&#39;d found was a<br/>
little scary. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not alone. Sharon<br/>
<br/>
[I&#39;m forwarding her the responses, as you figured out by now.  --Sandra]<br/>
