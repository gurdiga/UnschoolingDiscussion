<div id="ygrps-yiv-853138198"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My son was two when he dropped something on his foot and used the F word to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  express his displeasure.  We just ignored it, although my brain spun around<br/>
  the idea that I needed to clean up my language, and soon!&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  So far any swearing on our part has gone unnoticed by the kids. Once a man walking by our house called my son a  f****ing asshole. Jess came down to the house wondering why someone would call him an acorn!<br/>
<br/>
  Another time their cousins were over and my neice came in to tell on her younger brother for saying the f word. My boys came in and asked what was wrong with the letter f. LOL We spent the next 10 minutes thinking up lots of great words that began with f. <br/>

<br/>
I was about 10 and came home from school telling my mom that someone said an<br/>
awful word. I wouldn&#39;t even repeat it. She asked me what it started with and<br/>
I told her F. She almost had a heart attack. It was that kind of household.<br/>
She finally got it out of me, the word was fart!!! I thought shut up was a<br/>
swear word until I was 8.<br/>

One of the most elegant jokes I knew when I was a kid was &quot;what starts with f <br/>
and ends with -uck?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOVE that riddle!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(firetruck is the correct answer, though it&#39;s certainly only one of TWO great <br/>
answers!)<br/>
