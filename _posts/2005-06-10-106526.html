was, won&#39;t he miss field day??  This is the one &quot;fun&quot; day of the <br/>

of school so they can go to one field day per year.  <br/>

But, in regards to your comment, we know a lot of 1st/2nd generation <br/>
Americans due to chess club and they seem have the worst opinions of <br/>
homeschooling than most people we meet.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I suppose if that was the woman&#39;s only experience with<br/>
homeschooling or unschooling, that is a fairly natural response. How<br/>
did you respond to her observation?  Did you clue her in on how many<br/>
children are homeschooled here, and how it has become an accepted form<br/>
of education in the States? <br/>
<br/>
Many people I know came to this country because of our wonderful<br/>
school system, with the dream of their children getting a better<br/>
education than was available in their country.  They can&#39;t understand<br/>
why anyone would choose to homeschool when the education is free here.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I have ever met someone who came to America because they<br/>
wanted the freedom to homeschool their children.  I have met friends<br/>
who later pulled their children out of the public schools and<br/>
homeschooled them when their expectations weren&#39;t realized, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  This is going to sound totally inappropriate but my first thought was it would have been funny to look concerned, open your eyes wide and say, &quot;Oh! But maybe that was just because he was black?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  She wouldn&#39;t have gotten the irony of course and would have thought it was a racist comment instead of one pointing out her stereotyping. Ah well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,  it&#39;s Madame Barley here.  This woman, an RN trained in France, <br/>
has highly educated relatives and in laws in her home country.  Her <br/>
husband is highly educated. Her children have highly paid professions <br/>
and are married to spouses with professions, too (as opposed to <br/>
jobs). They are well-off and she gets involved in causes and appears <br/>
to know everything, if you get my drift. <br/>
<br/>
 I told her homeschooling is not that uncommon here, but she felt I <br/>
was borderline abusing my child.   She becme quite angry; actually, <br/>
before this event, we were friends.  I never spoke to her in the tone <br/>
she spoke to me.  (I value my life.)<br/>
<br/>
  She had a part-time job assisting with medically-problematic <br/>
children in the regular classroom.  &quot;Lame ducks&quot; is what she calls <br/>
them.  I have come to understand that no matter what &quot;problem&quot; my <br/>
child should ever have, now or 10 years from now, or when he&#39;s 85, it <br/>
is going to be because he did not go to school - by his own choice <br/>
completely, by the way.   It is a burder we parents have to bear, and <br/>
not think about it too much!</div>

I must&#39;ve heard &quot;prom&quot; 40 times over the year, and I just used to say &quot;I  <br/>

might&#39;ve, but my boyfriend was in a rock band and was always playing for  <br/>
someone else&#39;s prom.  And I really wasn&#39;t that kind of girl anyway, to doll  up that <br/>
way.)<br/>
 <br/>
Then through no effort of his own, Kirby was invited to two proms.  He  went <br/>
to one, accidentally socially-botched the other (which was fine), paid for  <br/>
his own extra-nice tux...  <br/>
 <br/>
So...  <br/>
Me, school, good student, boyfriend, no prom.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby, <br/>
No school, prom and a half. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Just last month one of the unschoolers some of you have read about (Liam  <br/>
McClure) went to a prom.  Danced swing.  Wouldn&#39;t dance any of the  other stuff, <br/>
I heard from his sister.  But she said he cleaned up real  well.  (Twin <br/>
sister, btw.)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You mean in the eyes of that woman?<br/>
 <br/>
Doesn&#39;t matter whether it was your child&#39;s choice, from her point of  view.  <br/>
And objectively, either.  If that turns out to have been &quot;a bad  choice,&quot; then <br/>
it&#39;s the mom&#39;s fault for allowing him to make a bad choice.<br/>
 <br/>
Without choices, people don&#39;t risk as much guilt or failure.  <br/>
People can have a measure of innocence and guiltlessness, but it costs  <br/>
freedom and choice.  And it DOES risk failure and disappointment every  time, at <br/>
every turn.<br/>
 <br/>
Bummer about the prevalance of homeschooling is that it made school a  choice <br/>
and spreads the guilt.  And the better unschooling works, the more  guilt <br/>
seeps into having chosen school at home.   <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think it can be helped.<br/>

I just wanted to say reading this made me so happy. My daughter also <br/>
has so much choice in her life, and being home is completely her <br/>
decision. (she&#39;s almost 10)<br/>
I love hearing that other people realize that their kids should have <br/>
