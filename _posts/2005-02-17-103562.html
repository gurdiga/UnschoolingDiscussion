<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443552479">Hi all. That&#39;s how I feel about something I wrote a few minutes or so ago. Even though my son was sitting right next to me and he said that it was fine to go ahead and quote this small piece from his journal... I feel I&#39;ve said too much. I feel like I&#39;ve said way too much about our personal lives and I shouldn&#39;t have. I do my best to honor his wishes (like never using his name on line)  and even now, he&#39;s sitting near by saying: &quot;It&#39;s no big deal, Mom. People share.&quot;, I feel that for myself I shared too much. So, if this was way off the unschooling theme and how things are normally done around here, I do so apologize. Sometimes I think my knee jerk need to share these things is so I don&#39;t feel so scared in this... but here was probably not the place to do it. So... again, I apologize.  <br/>
 <br/>
He gave me his journal a few weeks ago. In it he wrote: &quot;I am afraid Mom is going to die. I&#39;m really scared because she&#39;s my Mom, but she&#39;s my best friend...<br/>
 <br/>
Peace to you all,<br/>
Susan <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844190191">Your son is right, Susan. People share. Women, especially, share.<br/>
<br/>
There are email lists that don&#39;t allow any actual real personal <br/>
information - it is ALL about theories. I find those incredibly boring <br/>
and useless.<br/>
<br/>
But many of us learn by telling our stories to each other and working <br/>
on them together - we chew on them - we dig for the bigger principles <br/>
at work, we figure out how we feel about things by talking about <br/>
real-life situations. Although we post specifics - true anecdotes and <br/>
situations - it is the underlying basics that we really focus on. <br/>
That&#39;s how we learn from each other. I post that my kids sing all the <br/>
time - at the top of their voices - they LOVE to sing. You may not have <br/>
singers, but you may have a kid who plays the radio loudly all the <br/>
time. Or kids who just use really loud voices. At the same time my <br/>
specific issue is looked at, perhaps in some depth with differing <br/>
responses, people will be comparing and contrasting it to other <br/>
situations that they&#39;ve faced. Two of the most important things we&#39;ll <br/>
do will be to see how general unschooling principles apply to this <br/>
specific situation and to see if general unschooling principles can be <br/>
developed out of this specific situation. Either way - it is all useful <br/>
analytical discussion. NONE of it is about us all somehow determining <br/>
who is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;good&quot; or otherwise. None of it is personal. None of <br/>
us have any authority over each other.<br/>
<br/>
However, we have simply found that if it is all hypothetical, it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have that ring of truth to it that makes it so real and useful.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t share much, to be honest. I didn&#39;t get any sense from your <br/>
original posts of what your decision-making was like, what your <br/>
relationship was like, etc. Without that context, people&#39;s responses <br/>
will be more shots in the dark - so keeping in mind that they may be <br/>
useful to somebody else, you simply need to either ignore what doesn&#39;t <br/>
fit or expand on your situation more so that the conversation can be <br/>
more focused, if that is what you&#39;d like.<br/>
<br/>
If not, your comments might be the starting point for a discussion that <br/>
will expand and branch out in directions that are no longer even <br/>
relevant at all to your own situation.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, NOTHING written is really about any individual - we know so <br/>
very little about each other (most of the 1600+ of us, anyway), that <br/>
we&#39;re all just responding to what WE get from what others write.<br/>
<br/>
Take what you can use - if something provokes thought, consider it a <br/>
gift. Ignore the rest - unless you feel like questioning it or adding <br/>
to it or expanding upon it or disagreeing with it - or, in other words, <br/>
analyzing it yourself.<br/>
