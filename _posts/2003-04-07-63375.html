<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367698777"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You know how you sometimes think maybe you didn&#39;t make something <br/>
 </span></blockquote>interesting <br/>
enough for your child to WANT to know anymore.  By NOT &quot;talking&quot; math or <br/>
doing &quot;fun&quot; things with math I just wondered if I was somehow short changing <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
I read, she sees me read, she reads.  I cook, she sees me cook, she wants to <br/>
cook.  I garden she sees me she joins in.  Sometimes its the other way around <br/>
<br/>
but you get the idea.  If you&#39;re not somehow exposed to it, how will you <br/>
know? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this for our local unschooling group:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That is the biggest challenge I have and will have is finding a way to <br/>
&gt; sneak the math concepts in without it sounding like I am teaching math.  If <br/>
&gt; we even utter the word math right now, we hear the moans and groans, and <br/>
&gt; whining begin.  It is hard not to bring up the connection while cooking <br/>
&gt; etc., but,...maybe in time, they will be less offended and anxious about <br/>
&gt; the term math.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The BIGGEST challenge will be for YOU to BACK OFF on &quot;teaching math&quot;! They&#39;re <br/>
SURROUNDED by math! They CAN&#39;T escape it! Unschooling math does NOT look like <br/>
&quot;schooled&quot; math---there won&#39;t necessarily be workbooks and &quot;paper math&quot;. <br/>
Unschooling mathematics is patterns and logic and problem-solving. <br/>
<br/>
To UNschool math, you need to think out loud when YOU do math. When you&#39;re <br/>
figuring the 15% tip, YOU should say, aloud, &quot;OK, 10% of $44 is $4.40 plus <br/>
another 5%---$2.20 is $6.60. OK, she was a good waitress, let&#39;s leave $7.50.&quot; <br/>
Or if you&#39;re a 20% tipper---$4.40 and $4.40 is $8.80. Do math OUT LOUD---let <br/>
them SEE your gears working. Soon, YOU&#39;LL be able to see theirs! DON&#39;T make <br/>
it a &quot;lesson&quot;, just problem-solve out loud.<br/>
<br/>
Gas is $1.59/gallon right now. You have ten dollars. DON&#39;T ask them, just say <br/>
outloud that you can get one, two, three, four, five---about six gallons with <br/>
your ten dollars. Estimation is a great tool. Who cares about &quot;remainders&quot;??? <br/>
After filling ten dollars worth, then LOOK at how much you actually got! And <br/>
remember, it&#39;s NOT a lesson!!!! It&#39;s just a interesting tidbit---to YOU!!!!<br/>
<br/>
If you start &quot;sneaking&quot; things, hell! They see right through THAT! They&#39;re <br/>
SMART! And what they&#39;re LEARNING is that YOU don&#39;t think they&#39;re smart ENOUGH <br/>
to learn math. YOU&#39;RE handicapping them yourSELF!<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY way they&#39;re going to be less anxious about math is if YOU are! <br/>
<br/>
Buy them Zoombini&#39;s Logical Journey computer game. Zoombini&#39;s is a math game <br/>
for pre-readers. (Don&#39;t tell them THAT!) There are no + or - or x or &gt; signs. <br/>
It&#39;s about THINKING and SOLVING and PATTERNS and very HIGH levels of <br/>
mathematics. It&#39;s alegbra and calculus for 5 year olds! And it&#39;s FUN! <br/>
<br/>
Children can&#39;t help but learn arithmatic in their daily lives. It&#39;s <br/>
everywhere. It may not LOOK like long division, but the point is NOT that it <br/>
DOES. The point is that they GET IT. Kids will eventually come up with their <br/>
OWN ways of subtracting large numbers quickly (which is what division <br/>
IS!)---and if they figure it out ON THEIR OWN, they&#39;ll NEVER forget it---and <br/>
they&#39;ll OWN it.<br/>
<br/>
Learning multiplication tables TRULY isn&#39;t important. What&#39;s important is <br/>
that they can figure out how to do math &quot;their way&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
At five, Duncan looked up at me one day and said, &quot;Mom, two fives is ten. <br/>
Three fives is fifteen. Four fives is twenty.&quot; He was looking at his <br/>
digits---five fingers or toes on each appendage. I asked what five fives <br/>
might be. He struggled a minute and said, &quot; twenty-five.&quot; He was doing <br/>
multiplication at five years old---because he wanted to. I did NOT rush out <br/>
and get paper and pencil to show him what it looked like on paper. I just <br/>
took joy in the fact that HE found joy in it!<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian is a colllege statistics and economics professor who will be <br/>
addressing math questions at the conference this August. If you&#39;re struggling <br/>
with &quot;unschooling everything but math&quot;, DON&#39;T miss her!<br/>
<br/>
BACK OFF on teaching math. Let them DEschool what they learned in school (and <br/>
at home) about math---that it&#39;s hard or that they&#39;re stupid---because THAT is <br/>
what they&#39;ve learned! Back off. Ban the word &quot;math&quot; from your household. Let <br/>
them---on their own---find the joy and beauty of patterns and logic and <br/>
problem-solving. They can&#39;t escape it---they&#39;re surrounded by it. I promise!<br/>
<br/>
And GET OVER the LD label! We ALL learn differently, but we all LEARN. At our <br/>
own pace and in our own way. Each child is unique. Don&#39;t put yours in a box. <br/>
Step AWAY from the box!<br/>

voice said, &quot;I&#39;ve never mastered MINE either!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve never been important to me, or important enough for me to &quot;make&quot; my <br/>
children memorize them either.<br/>
