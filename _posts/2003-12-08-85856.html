       Someone did post those words: &quot;it&#39;s her body so what&#39;s the harm?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
       Like anything else, it could be reasonable and moderate in one <br/>
situation and used to justify a harmful extreme in another.<br/>
<br/>
       I personally see all kinds of risks in having sex under age 14, and/or <br/>
when knowing someone only well enough for a movie date and a couple of <br/>
visits. That is what I see. Whether the majority of other unschoolers agree with me <br/>
is a separate question, as is whether and how I can help my children avoid <br/>
those risks.<br/>
<br/>
       To engage in risky behavior without harm doesn&#39;t lessen actual risk. <br/>
It just lessens our perception of risk (which perversely may result in more <br/>
exposure to it.)<br/>
<br/>
       Do you know the movie, &quot;The Big Easy&quot; with Dennis Quaid as a New <br/>
Orleans cop? They arrest a distraught woman for murdering her husband, and are much <br/>
amused because her defense is she never meant to kill him, she&#39;s stabbed him <br/>
before and he didn&#39;t die! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       I take your point that you don&#39;t see video games with violent content <br/>
as risky or objectionable. Not sure you&#39;ve heard me, though. I get the feeling <br/>
you&#39;re in some other argument you&#39;ve had before, raising objections to things <br/>
I haven&#39;t said and never even thought.<br/>
<br/>
       Like your riff about &quot;today&#39;s highways&quot; -- I don&#39;t see much <br/>
relationship between what I said and how you responded with something about living in <br/>
the present only.  (Maybe you meant to be funny?) <br/>
<br/>
       Today&#39;s highways are different than when I learned to drive 30 years <br/>
ago. So I have to think about, and deal with, new realities and learning needs <br/>
for my children as drivers, not simply go on auto pilot from my own past and <br/>
how I was schooled or parented. Also I was a first-born child with a classic <br/>
focus on delayed gratification (living in the future)  I agree we are here now, <br/>
but not that the present is all we have. It&#39;s all pretty seamless to me.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;        But it seems to me worth mentioning that another extreme to avoid <br/>
&gt; would be a sort of anything-goes tolerance for risky or demonstrably <br/>
&gt; destructive <br/>
&gt; choices, in the name of &quot;unschooling.&quot; Where each of us begins to feel that <br/>
&gt; extreme approaching will vary, of course. Nose-piercing, tattoos, sexual <br/>
&gt; contact <br/>
&gt; with others, ingesting mind-altering substances, handling guns, and playing <br/>
&gt; violent video games all fit into that category for me, when it is my own <br/>
&gt; children under 14 in question.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you really consider playing video games (which are never violent, thought <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; they  might have &quot;violent&quot; subjects, like war, karate kicking, guns) is in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; same category with mind-altering substances or tattoos or having sex?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Drugs are illegal, tattoos are permanent, and sex can cause death or <br/>
&gt; reproduction or both.  A video game is a kid sitting in a chair with a <br/>
&gt; remote control, <br/>
&gt; not sticking anything into his body--not ink, LSD, other people&#39;s parts...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t seem at all in the same category to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;I <br/>
&gt; protecting and nurturing my children is to first protect them from their own <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; extreme behavior long enough to help them to learn how to handle their own <br/>
&gt; extreme <br/>
&gt; impulses and desires that might do them permanent harm. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My children have not experienced the &quot;extreme behavior&quot; you seem to be <br/>
&gt; worried about.   &quot;Tolerance for risky or demonstrably destructive choices&quot; <br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; been an issue at our house.   I think Kirby had sex a time or two (at the <br/>
&gt; same <br/>
&gt; camping event) but I know he had condoms because I have them to him when he <br/>
&gt; seemed in a possible range.  It didn&#39;t cause him to go sex crazy.  It&#39;s been <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; nearly a year, and he was the girls boyfriend (in a way, they went to one <br/>
&gt; movie, <br/>
&gt; he visited her once and she came over here once) for several weeks and <br/>
&gt; decided <br/>
&gt; she wasn&#39;t really all that nice.  No drama, no trauma.   If it happened (as <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; suspect), she was his first but he wasn&#39;t her first.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My choice wasn&#39;t &quot;to tolerate&quot; it or not.  It seems to have been a done <br/>
&gt; deal. <br/>
&gt; He talked to me an somewhat vague terms about the situation being serious, <br/>
&gt; and I talked to him in somewhat less vague terms about birth control, and <br/>
&gt; condoms not being 100%, and serious relationships needing back-up birth <br/>
&gt; control. He <br/>
&gt; said &quot;I&#39;ll mention that.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I was his age I was having sex.  He&#39;s that age and is not (in general <br/>
&gt; terms).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Those are some places that the &quot;it&#39;s their body so <br/>
&gt; what&#39;s the harm?&quot; philosophy seems extreme to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t heard people say &quot;it&#39;s their body so what&#39;s the harm?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It IS their body.  So help them learn to make choices when it&#39;s not so <br/>
&gt; crucial instead of deciding for them up to the point that they&#39;re making <br/>
&gt; their very <br/>
&gt; first solo choices ever about things like tattoos, drugs, sex, guns, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids have been making choices their whole lives, and I don&#39;t see them <br/>
&gt; doing crazy or dangerous or impulsive things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That pretty much goes against this:  &quot;I think part of my job in <br/>
&gt; protecting and nurturing my children is to first protect them from their own <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; extreme behavior long enough to help them to learn how to handle their own <br/>
&gt; extreme <br/>
&gt; impulses and desires that might do them permanent harm. &quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That doesn&#39;t mean, though, that I have not protected them, that I haven&#39;t <br/>
&gt; helped them learn, and that I don&#39;t care whether they are done permanent <br/>
&gt; harm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The article on balance is a warning against seeing the world as two extreme <br/>
&gt; choices, either controlling or &quot;losing control.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;  Up to now, I had been mainly thinking about how as an unschooler to <br/>
&gt; help them handle learning to drive a car on today&#39;s highways, &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What other highways could they learn on?  The past and future are not <br/>
&gt; useable <br/>
&gt; highways.  Here we are, just today.  Just now.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, then, I missed that.<br/>
Was it about piercing or a tattoo?<br/>
Or was it about IV drugs or crazed group sex?<br/>
Honestly, not all things are equally dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;     Like anything else, it could be reasonable and moderate in one <br/>
situation and used to justify a harmful extreme in another.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen anyone on this list justify harmful extremes?<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about our real children and not our imaginary freak-out fantasies.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I personally see all kinds of risks in having sex under age 14&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was sixteen, close to seventeen.  He&#39;s almost six feet tall.  He&#39;s <br/>
shaved for a couple of years.  He&#39;s not a little boy.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s under fourteen.  She&#39;s not even thinking about kissing, let alone <br/>
having sex.<br/>
<br/>
So where did you get &quot;under fourteen&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I personally see all kinds of risks in having sex under age 14, and/or <br/>
when knowing someone only well enough for a movie date and a couple of <br/>
visits. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t know her better, it&#39;s that he&#39;s really busy, and <br/>
didn&#39;t glom onto her in the desperation some teens do when another person will <br/>
pay personal, physical-touch attention to them.  I&#39;ve NEVER seen that kind of <br/>
desperation in any of the teenaged unschoolers I&#39;ve know.  I&#39;ve seen it dozens <br/>
of times in kids at school, both when I was a kid and when I was a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
The girl called Kirby a lot. When he discovered she was in the habit of lying <br/>
to her dad he wasn&#39;t very interested in pursuing a relationship with her.  He <br/>
did go and meet her mom (who lives in another state, but had come to visit.  <br/>
The girl was pressing Kirby to call her mom &quot;mom.&quot;  He wasn&#39;t comfortable with <br/>
the pressure on him to act married to her instead of just a boyfriend.<br/>
<br/>
They were at a camping event where I was not, when &quot;it&quot; happened (as I <br/>
strongly suspect; Kirby was discreet enough not to talk about it openly, but there <br/>
were subtle indications).  In the context of that camping event, it was quite <br/>
romantic.  He had known her for a while, and was friends with many of her <br/>
friends.  So the suggestion that he didn&#39;t know her is inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that he didn&#39;t jump on her like a flea on a hotter newer dog seems <br/>
to me proof of maturity.<br/>
<br/>
The relationship started in February.  He botched her prom invitation (not <br/>
knowing what a big deal prom was, he answered honestly &quot;not really&quot; to &quot;Do you <br/>
want to go to the prom?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When he discovered what a faux pas that had been, he went and reserved a tux, <br/>
called her and said he would go with her.  She said she already had other <br/>
plans (to go with a female also-dateless friend) and his response when he got off <br/>
the phone was &quot;Well that saved me a hundred dollars.&quot;  She broke up with him <br/>
a day or two later.  I think she was afraid of the fallout from her NOT going <br/>
with him when he was willing.  She had all manner of school-based angst and <br/>
considerations about the relationship.  Kirby had none of them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; To engage in risky behavior without harm doesn&#39;t lessen actual risk. <br/>
It just lessens our perception of risk (which perversely may result in more <br/>
exposure to it.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you mean mathematically, but how does it work for you in <br/>
the real world?<br/>
<br/>
Do you drive your car when the tires are getting bald?<br/>
Do you drive in the snow when it&#39;s less than life or death?<br/>
Have you ever exceeded the speed limit?<br/>
Did your lack of harm lessen the actual risk?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Not sure you&#39;ve heard me, though. I get the feeling <br/>
you&#39;re in some other argument you&#39;ve had before&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m writing to hundreds of people.  Maybe you were writing to just one.<br/>
The list isn&#39;t designed for that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;       Like your riff about &quot;today&#39;s highways&quot; -- I don&#39;t see much <br/>
relationship between what I said and how you responded with something about <br/>
living in <br/>
the present only.  (Maybe you meant to be funny?) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing funny about the fact that we are alive in this moment and <br/>
today&#39;s life is the only life we can live.   <br/>
<br/>
How will a child learn to drive today without today&#39;s highways?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;       Today&#39;s highways are different than when I learned to drive 30 years <br/>
ago. So I have to think about, and deal with, new realities and learning <br/>
needs <br/>
for my children as drivers, not simply go on auto pilot from my own past and <br/>
how I was schooled or parented. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you not considered your own driving in the past thirty years?  Would you <br/>
teach them to drive with thirty-year-old visions and thoughts in your head?<br/>
<br/>
Would you parrot what your driver&#39;s ed teacher said or what your parents said <br/>
(you said &quot;how I was schooled or parented&quot;) instead of taking the synthesized <br/>
knowledge you possess from all possible sources and the experience of thirty <br/>
years and pass THAT on to your children?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also I was a first-born child with a classic <br/>
focus on delayed gratification (living in the future)  I agree we are here <br/>
now, <br/>
but not that the present is all we have. It&#39;s all pretty seamless to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a firstborn with a sometimes-irritating amount of detailed recall of <br/>
childhood memories, and live seems QUITE seamless to me, yet the only point at <br/>
which my feet actually touch the ground is this moment.  The past is memory and <br/>
the future is speculation.  Whining about memory and losing sleep over <br/>
speculation only screw up the next breath we take.  <br/>
<br/>
In AA (my mom used to go) they very indelicately say &quot;If you&#39;re standing with <br/>
one foot in the past and one foot in the future, you&#39;re pissing all over <br/>
today.&quot;<br/>
