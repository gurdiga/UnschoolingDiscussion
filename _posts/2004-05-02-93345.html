<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314865887">&quot;But that does not negate the idea that <br/>
swimmies are dangerous.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
It most certainly does. In every examply you used, the PARENTS were dangerous, not the swimmies.<br/>
When my children are too young to swim, I am in the water with them (or another largish swimmer that can hold them), swimmies or not. Most of my children hated any kind of floatable on their body, so I held them. But those that did use some kind of flotation device still had me right there....there&#39;s no way any swimmie was dangerous on any level.<br/>
I alternate between the kiddie pool and the big pool, holding them and being right next to them. Same thing at the beach. Swimmies aren&#39;t dangerous, people are.<br/>
