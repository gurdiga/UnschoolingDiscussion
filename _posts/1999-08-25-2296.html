just trying to do their best -- as they perceive it and as they are able.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This issue is similar to homeschooling and breastfeeding.  We can all<br/>
state the reasons why these are beneficial for children, but can never<br/>
imagine all the factors that each family must consider before making a<br/>
decision.<br/>
However, there is also a concept called INFORMED CHOICE.  This is what is<br/>
often lacking in our society.  We go along blindly doing what most people<br/>
do without thinking long and hard to learn all the pros and cons, before<br/>
deciding what really might be best for our family (and periodically<br/>
reevaluating).<br/>

See, I think Mary Ellen stated it much better than I did! But that is what I <br/>
meant. I felt comfortable enough with this list to state my opinions and it <br/>
turned out much differently than I expected! Again, my apologies!<br/>
