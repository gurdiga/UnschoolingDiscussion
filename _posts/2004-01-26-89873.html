<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424164762">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
we (me, husband + son) are looking forward to a 17day-holiday in Los <br/>
Angeles (and probably also Sacramento). This is my first trip to <br/>
California (actually first trip to the US). Could anybody advice me what <br/>
a 5yo boy who loves everything on wheels and is into technical things <br/>
shouldn&#39;t miss? What are unschoolers&#39; favorite spots in and around LA?<br/>
<br/>
All the best from Germany,<br/>

I&#39;m trying to think of it in terms of what you can&#39;t also get in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
Universal Studios tour<br/>
La Brea Tar Pits (nothing about wheels, but memorable, wonderful, and easy to <br/>
get to)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t live there, but those are places I would definitely return to (having <br/>
been once and twice, respectively, but Holly has been to neither).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033692591">There is Travel Town in Griffith Park, in Los Angeles, which is free.<br/>
Griffith Park also has a small scale train that you can ride on.  The<br/>
Petersen Automotive Museum, also in LA, which is very close to the La Brea<br/>
Tar Pits and the LA County Museum of Art.  Are you driving up to Sacramento?<br/>
If so, you can arrange to pass through San Jose, which is home to the Tech<br/>
Museum.  It&#39;s a wonderful place to spend the day with someone who is<br/>
interested in all things technical.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I second these and the La Brea Tar Pits!! Especially the Tech museum - <br/>
we live 8 hours away and my youngest  daughter begs to go there.<br/>
<br/>
Also - don&#39;t plan to &quot;see Hollywood&quot; - or at least don&#39;t expect <br/>
anything except busy city streets. If you go to Universal Studios (a <br/>
big theme park) you&#39;ll see more &quot;Hollywood&quot; and have a lot of fun - <br/>
take the back lot tram tour, which is how the whole thing got started <br/>
and don&#39;t miss the special effects show and the &quot;animals in the movies&quot; <br/>
show.<br/>
<br/>
When my German relatives come here, they want to go to the beach a lot. <br/>
Depending on time of year and where you&#39;re staying, we can tell you <br/>
which beaches are fun for what. You might want to try to go to the <br/>
Cabrillo Marine Museum and tidepools and take a harbor cruise at the <br/>
Long Beach/Los Angeles Harbor.  If you are driving from Los Angeles to <br/>
Sacramento, a nice way to do it is to drive up Highway 101 to San Jose <br/>
first and go to the Tech Museum and then drive from there to <br/>
Sacramento. Hwy 101 is a FAR nicer drive than going straight from LA to <br/>
Sacramento and you can make a quick stop in Santa Barbara or other <br/>
beach towns. My sister-in-law, who is German, was named Barbara because <br/>
her parents came here on their honeymoon and her mother fell so in love <br/>
with Santa Barbara.<br/>
<br/>
  Sacramento has an awesome train museum - it is at the north end of Old <br/>
Town Sacramento. Don&#39;t miss that. Sacramento has the state capitol <br/>
building - the park around it is a great place for a picnic - it is <br/>
lovely and there are lots of squirrels, the capitol building tour would <br/>
be boring for a five year old, but walking around in the building for <br/>
20 minutes or so would not be, because the rotunda is cool, you can be <br/>
up about 4 floors and look up into the dome or look down below. I&#39;d <br/>
skip the Golden State Museum, for a five year old it would be mostly <br/>
boring. Sutter&#39;s fort can be pretty cool, especially if they have some <br/>
living history type of stuff going on, which they often do. This can be <br/>
a fairly short stop, though, not an all-day visit, and it is right in <br/>
town. The California State Indian Museum is on the same property as <br/>
Sutter&#39;s Fort and, again, my German relatives, especially the kids, <br/>
have always REALLY enjoyed that - since it is so uniquely American and <br/>
they didn&#39;t have other chances to see real Indian stuff. I&#39;d think that <br/>
an hour or so spent there would be fun for a 5 yo, but not much longer <br/>
since it is all looking, no activity. Since you can go to Sutter&#39;s Fort <br/>
AND the Indian museum at the same place - well worth going.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I second this motion.  The train museum in Griffith Park is cool, but all<br/>
outside, and weathered where the one in Sacramento is indoors and plush and<br/>
beautiful.  I did forget to mention that there is an area in Griffith Park<br/>
that is maintained by train enthusiasts that is full of scale model trains<br/>
to ride.  It&#39;s only open certain days of the month ---<br/>
<br/>
Los Angeles Live Steamers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Located adjacent to the Travel Town Museum, the Los Angeles Live Steamers is<br/>
a local club devoted to the preservation of locomotives through scale<br/>
models. Open to the public every Sunday from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. when the club<br/>
offers free public rides on their live steam scale model trains.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s more info on the Travel Town museum:<br/>
<br/>
Travel Town Museum<br/>
<br/>
5200 Zoo Drive<br/>
(323) 662-5874<br/>
Open daily, 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. Closed December 25.<br/>
To See Travel Town&#39;s Collection<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Located at 5200 Zoo Drive in the northwest corner of Griffith Park, this<br/>
transportation museum is dedicated to the preservation and celebration of<br/>
railroad history in the western United States through a sizeable collection<br/>
of steam and diesel locomotives, trolleys, passenger equipment, and freight<br/>
cars; particular thematic emphasis is placed on the heritage of railroading<br/>
in Southern California. In addition to the railroad-related artifacts the<br/>
museum has an indoor collection of automobiles and horse-drawn vehicles,<br/>
along with a permanent exhibit of turn-of-the-century fire trucks and<br/>
apparatus entitled, &quot;Firefighting in Los Angeles, 1869-1940.&quot; Two vintage<br/>
railroad passenger cars are available for meetings or birthday party rental.<br/>
Group visits and school tours are available. First Sunday of every month<br/>
offers alternately either docent-lead free tours of the Union Pacific<br/>
Streamliner passenger equipment or full-scale railroad operations. Admission<br/>
is free. Miniature train ride concession and gift shop.<br/>
        <br/>
And yet another train in GP:<br/>
<br/>
Griffith Park Southern Railroad<br/>
<br/>
Los Feliz/Riverside Drive entrance to the Park<br/>
(323) 664-6788<br/>
The rides operate from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekdays and until 5:00 p.m. on<br/>
weekends and holidays.<br/>
<br/>
The miniature train ride has served the public in Griffith Park since 1948.<br/>
Youngsters of all ages enjoy the experience of riding the FREEDOM TRAIN or<br/>
the COLONEL GRIFFITH on the Griffith Park and Southern Railroad. The track<br/>
stretches over a mile and takes the rider past pony rides, through a lush<br/>
green meadow, through an old Western town, and past a Native American<br/>
village.<br/>
<br/>
SR2 Simulator - This ride realistically simulates the excitement of driving<br/>
a racing car; riding a roller coaster; and flying in acrobatic airplanes.<br/>
