<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854201095">Awhile ago I was contacted by a reporter here in Minnesota who wanted to do an article on unschooling.<br/>
I passed it on to my local unschooling group. <br/>
Here is how it turned out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565463577">I linked it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a>  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t write anything about it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a blog for links to outside articles about homeschooling, and unschooling mostly.<br/>
