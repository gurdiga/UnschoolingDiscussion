<div id="ygrps-yiv-709911694"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;(We rarely even know when school will start anymore as it&#39;s such a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>non-issue at our house.)<br/>
<br/>
I wish we never knew, but my kids (especially my youngest, Bay) know<br/>
because it means the mass-exodus of all the teens who have been hanging<br/>
around our house/farm all summer! And, they become increasingly more<br/>
difficult to get together with because of the all-encompassing school<br/>
monster which holds them captive from early morning until early evening and<br/>
then we only get to see them on weekends! Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
We have virtually no unschooled (or homeschooled, for the matter!) teens in<br/>
our community. . . several younger ones, but only two teenage friends for<br/>
my youngest son and none for my older two! Boo hoo.<br/>
<br/>
The only silver lining in this cloud is that the beaches are empty! - my<br/>
teens get all the waves! <br/>
<br/>
Love, Lee<br/>
