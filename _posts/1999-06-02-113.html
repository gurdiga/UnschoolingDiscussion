&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s great to meet you!!!  Matter of fact I would like to talk to you and<br/>
&gt;Eryn about creating some teen space on the unschooling.com site!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, that would be cool. I&#39;d love to help with that if you decide that&#39;s<br/>
what you&#39;d like on unschooling.com. Unfortuntaly, I cannot write more<br/>
because I have a million emails to answer, but if you want to talk to me<br/>
privately my email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:OmegaMolecule@...">OmegaMolecule@...</a> Anyway, gotta go. :) ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>
