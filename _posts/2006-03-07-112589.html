<div id="ygrps-yiv-272009636">Hi, I have 2 unschooled daughters 12 and 4. I started my journey <br/>
after 3 days of kindergarten. Yep, the teacher was an a... and being <br/>
an older Mom (late 30&#39;s at the time) I thought, &quot;What happened to <br/>
kindergarten?&quot;.I had no idea. Of course I didn&#39;t get the <br/>
daycare/preschool thing either because it didn&#39;t exist when I was a <br/>
wee one. So I called my LLL Mom friends that were doing it-<br/>
 &quot;homeschooling&quot; and one was sweet enough to drive to my house and <br/>
hand me the copy of &quot;Why Schools Don&#39;t Educate&quot; and I GOT IT and <br/>
here I am. <br/>
<br/>
Well, we had a small homeschool group for a few years and then some <br/>
of the Moms started a charter school for homeschoolers. aaarrrggghh <br/>
I opted out of the testing and they begged me to &quot;do it&quot; or they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get their funding...aaarrrgg. And I stood my ground and <br/>
then they asked if we would go off the books...so I asked can we <br/>
still come here? How am I going to explain this to my little one? <br/>
And they said, &quot;Oh, sure&quot;. Well, the drive was an hour and 10 <br/>
minutes and then my next daughter was born so I just quit going. As <br/>
my little one got older we went to another group 35 minutes away and <br/>
they wanted you to sign a &quot;Statement of Faith&quot; aarrggh. Well, a <br/>
catholic Mom from the group called me later and after I told her who <br/>
I was and that I don&#39;t belong to that group she said, &quot;that we need <br/>
to just support each other because we are homeschooling&quot;. (a kind <br/>
soulful lesson that I continue to pass on). So we had some friends. <br/>
<br/>
Well, we just moved from small town CA to Idaho. We were in the <br/>
country and the whole family was tired of being so isolated. And my <br/>
11 year old daughter needed more and my social 3 year old was going <br/>
to get desperate too but even sooner. <br/>
<br/>
So here we are. I found this site in 1999 and peek in here every <br/>
once in awhile to feel connected when so few like minded souls are <br/>
around. And it works every time!! Thank you for being here everyone. <br/>
This area (Boise/Meridian) has tons of homeschoolers with a good mix <br/>
and they are inclusive on their yahoo groups and there are field <br/>
trips, etc. and this place just has tons to do! PE for homeschoolers <br/>
at the YMCA twice a week, and in the other direction at the Nampa <br/>
Rec center. Homeschool Days at the Discovery Center!! They cater to <br/>
homeschoolers!!<br/>
<br/>
Are any of you in the Meridian/Boise, Idaho area? I would love to <br/>
connect with you. Thanks again, Sue 898-1486</div>

jumped out at me:<br/>

liked each other and it was a good fit, not because you were both  <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Although it&#39;s fading, years back people adamantly insisted that  <br/>
homeschoolers had to stick together against the rest of the world.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy or realistic.<br/>
<br/>
There are hundreds of thousands of homeschoolers who homeschool  <br/>
specifically to keep their children away from families like ours and  <br/>
ideas like mine. &lt;G&gt;  We&#39;re not doing the same thing.<br/>

<br/>
I want to comment on this.  I think there are situations where it&#39;s good for<br/>
people to from &quot;relationships of convenience&quot;...but I agree that<br/>
homeschooling is not one of those situations.  Here&#39;s a real example from<br/>
our lives.  We live in Japan.  We&#39;re military, but we don&#39;t live on base--<br/>
we live in a Japanese neighborhood and most of our neighbors don&#39;t speak<br/>
English or eat the same food as we do, or go to the same places, or shop at<br/>
the same stores.<br/>
<br/>
There is an American, school-at-home family just around the corner from us,<br/>
and they would qualify as this kind of homeschoolers:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt; There are hundreds of thousands of homeschoolers who homeschool<br/>
 </span></blockquote>specifically to keep their children away from families like ours and<br/>
ideas like mine. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
In spite of this, we have a very good neighbor-type relationship.  If we<br/>
were in the states, theirs would be the last place I&#39;d ask to borrow a cup<br/>
of sugar, because we are SO different-- except that we live near each other.<br/>
Our kids play together sometimes, but we just don&#39;t discuss homeschooling<br/>
except in very general terms.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that there are lots of homeschool families who don&#39;t really<br/>
understand what &quot;support&quot; is.  I think it can even be dangerous to form<br/>
relationships or support networks based on the, &quot;You homeschool?  So do we!&quot;<br/>
principle.  On the other hand, sometimes even wildly different homeschool<br/>
styles can be a non-issue in a relationship if there is some other source of<br/>
commonality involved.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few random, mulling-it-over-while-drinking-coffee thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Tami, who actually has the only full-size oven in the neighborhood.  (Most<br/>
Japanese houses don&#39;t have ovens, only little &quot;fish broilers&quot;, and so many<br/>
Japanese people have never baked a cake, or cookies, or anything.  Bakeries<br/>
are VERY popular, and expensive.)<br/>

We bought a Japanese rice cooker (looks like a crock pot, sort of,  <br/>
and plugs in) before American manufacturers started making them, and  <br/>
much cheaper, or before we saw any American versions, anyway.  I had  <br/>
been thinking they must have kitchens with too many little  <br/>
appliances, but I hadn&#39;t thought they wouldn&#39;t have an oven.<br/>
<br/>
So we have big ovens (unlike Japan) and big refrigerators (unlike the  <br/>
U.K.) and big dishwashers (unlike... the U.K. and maybe unlike  <br/>
Japan).  Big microwaves, generally.<br/>
<br/>
What do kitchens have in New Zealand and Australia?  Do they follow  <br/>
the English tradition of bitty little fridges and room-temperature  <br/>
beer and soda?<br/>
<br/>
For small appliances, I have a little food processor, a blender, a  <br/>
hand mixer (not a stand-up thing like my mother-in-law has), two  <br/>
crock pots and the aforementioned rice cooker.  They take a lot of room.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761951617">We, of course, have a rice cooker. Tiger Brand, which is Japanese, (the<br/>
American versions, ummmm..suck.)  Everyone, and I mean everyone here has<br/>
them.  Little tiny side of the road veggie stands with no electricity---<br/>
there&#39;s an extension cord running to the nearest gas station, house or<br/>
grocery store to power the rice cooker.<br/>
<br/>
These things not only cook the rice perfectly, they keep it hot for 12<br/>
hours!  I highly recommend one to anyone who ever eats rice.  What we don&#39;t<br/>
have because our Japanese house is too Americanized, is a built in, humidity<br/>
controlled, bug-proof rice storage bin with handy-dandy measuring feature.<br/>
You dial up the amount of rice you want, pull the handle, and presto! Most<br/>
of these bins actually measure in the same units as the rice-cooker<br/>
measuring cup...which isn&#39;t really a &quot;cup&quot; as we know it.<br/>
<br/>
More interesting tidbits:  in Japanese, the word for rice: &quot;gohan&quot; is also<br/>
the word for meal.  With additions, it also means &quot;breakfast&quot;, &quot;lunch&quot; and<br/>
&quot;dinner&quot;.  The price of rice is regulated by the government, and people get<br/>
way bent out of shape over the politics of rice.  Gas costs almost the<br/>
equivalent of $5 a gallon, which is not so big of a deal, but if the price<br/>
of rice goes up 2 yen, everyone fusses!<br/>
<br/>
Alright, enough already!  It&#39;s morning here, and I haven&#39;t had breakfast!<br/>
I&#39;m hungry!<br/>

<br/>
Fie upon that sacrilege!!! Warm beer?! Not for an Aussie! There is an old<br/>
and reworked joke - two men on the top a snowy mountain (or climbing a<br/>
glacier or traveling Antarctica) in a blizzard stop and hunker down in the<br/>
snowy flurries and icy gale. They open their Esky (Australian for cooler).<br/>
They pull out a bottle or can of beer. They pop the top and both take a<br/>
swig. Moments later they spit it out in huge disgust and exclaim, &quot;Eerrgh!<br/>
Warm beer!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was a renter of houses and flats in Sydney & elsewhere, and when Mom<br/>
was a house and condo owner, all the places had in common no dishwasher and<br/>
no place to insert one. Just not considered standard equipment. Some places<br/>
had an insinkerator (sink disposal), but only the most modern condo<br/>
buildings. Fridges are just like here, microwaves smaller and not ubiquitous<br/>
then as I recall. <br/>
<br/>
Free standing ranges with oven below were much more common than wall ovens<br/>
(a luxury kitchen item). The ranges and stoves all have a feature called a<br/>
&quot;griller&quot; - what you would consider a broiler - but separate from the oven,<br/>
a slide out drawer just under the hot plates. This applies to gas or<br/>
electric. Perfect for those staples of Australian cooking the lamb loin chop<br/>
and lamb cutlet. I remember the big deal was to have a gas stove and an<br/>
electric oven as the height of modernity.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have a large asian style rice cooker - the kind you see at Panda<br/>
Express keeping the steamed rice warm. I had toasters, hand held mixer, and<br/>
blenders. My grandmother always had a Mix Master (like a KitchenAid stand<br/>
mixer) that she was very proud of. When I lived with electric stoves, I<br/>
generally had an electric kettle. I did my vegetable steaming on the stove<br/>
with a stacking set of steaming pans - like a double (triple) boiler with<br/>
holes.<br/>
<br/>
One very useful and important appliance was an electric skillet. We had<br/>
those in different sizes all over the world.  Another is a water boiler<br/>
called a &quot;berko&quot; - like an electric kettle but with a wide mouth top instead<br/>
of a spout - it can be used to heat/cook pretty much any liquid like soups<br/>
or intant noodles. Lots of folks in dorms had those. <br/>
<br/>
I also used to have a rolling clothes washer when in an apartment - twin tub<br/>
with a hose that attached to the kitchen faucet. None of the apartments or<br/>
houses I ever rented had clothes dryers, only washers in the laundry room.<br/>
Most people hang their laundry. My mother had a stacked washer & dryer when<br/>
I was in high school in our house - but it was unusual. <br/>
<br/>
Also rare in Australian homes - although that may be changing with the<br/>
newest constructions - built in closets in any bedrooms, the coat closet in<br/>
the living room, central heat or air. Really - apartments do not come with a<br/>
furnace! I never had central heating until I came here, only numerous<br/>
methods of room heating such as kerosene heaters or electric ones. One of my<br/>
enormously wealthy friends had gas powered central heating in her house - it<br/>
was a mark of luxury.<br/>
<br/>
Another common feature of many of the homes I lived in was instant gas water<br/>
heaters in the shower/tub and kitchen. You open the flue, light the pilot<br/>
light, turn the flame into the heater and &quot;whoomph&quot; the gas lights up and<br/>
heats the water instantly. Easy adjustments to temperature are made by<br/>
panning the pilot back and forth. Very efficient and inexpensive end use<br/>
energy water heating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721408797">We lived in Germany for a while, and they generall don&#39;t have built in <br/>
closets either.  Actually, a lot of places don&#39;t have built in kitchen <br/>
cabinets.  We lived on base, so we had those things, but we had hot <br/>
water radiators in each room that I thought were pretty cool.  In <br/>
Germany, air conditioning is very rare in homes, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
usually get hot there.  Also, they are very picky about clean windows <br/>
and don&#39;t have screens.  We had really big windows that swung into or <br/>
outside of the house so they were easy to clean.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We found the beds to be interesting as well.  When we first arrived <br/>
there, we stayed in a hotel for a few weeks.  Instead of a big double <br/>
bed, there were 2 single beds with wooden frames around them, and they <br/>
were pushed together.  But it wasn&#39;t really like a big bed because <br/>
there was wood in the middle!  And instead of disgusting hotel <br/>
bedspreads that rarely get washed here in the U.S., they had down <br/>
comforters and changed the comforter covers every day.  They hung the <br/>
comforters out of the (unscreened) windows to air them out.  You could <br/>
see comforters hanging out of windows all over the place.<br/>

Beer.<br/>

Pornography.<br/>
<br/>
Action figures.<br/>

Soda.<br/>

Panties. (The Japanese have got this ... thing about panties.) The  <br/>
picture there is for used school girl panties. (Do they guarantee  <br/>
that I wonder?)<br/>
<br/>
There was a picture that turned up on Google for BVDs and men&#39;s  <br/>
socks. A vending machine for a hotel.<br/>
<br/>
In Tokyo at least they have hotel &quot;rooms&quot; that sort of look like  <br/>
vending machines. They&#39;re like tubes in a wall. Basically just a  <br/>
place to sleep for the night.<br/>

Not long ago I had told my kids about the cigarette vending machines  <br/>
that were everywhere in the 1950&#39;s and 60&#39;s, and about going to buy  <br/>
cigarettes for my mom when I was twelve and would ride my bike up to  <br/>
the highway and there was a cigarette machine in just any building.   <br/>
Now, even where Marty works at a grocery store, the cigarettes are  <br/>
all behind the customer service counter, and if a customer wants  <br/>
some, the &quot;courtesy clerk&quot; (formerly known as sackers or bag boys� <br/>
Marty&#39;s job) trot over there and get them and bring them back.  Quite  <br/>
a controlled substance now, comparatively speaking, tobacco.<br/>
<br/>
But at New Year&#39;s Keith and Holly and I went to visit her  <br/>
grandparents in Alamogordo, a four hour trek south.  In Carizozo, a  <br/>
town where my own grandmother went to high school during the  <br/>
Depression, we stopped at an ancient filling station, and in the  <br/>
hallway toward the bathroom there was an empty, dusty cigarette  <br/>
machine with the eight or so slots and the pull handles to release  <br/>
one pack after you&#39;d paid 60 cents.  I was thrilled to be able to  <br/>
show Holly one of those very machines.<br/>
<br/>
I think a pack of cigarettes is $3 or so now, isn&#39;t it?  And they  <br/>
have dozens of choices.<br/>

we just put the food outside where it was freezing :).<br/>

<br/>
In the 18th century (and maybe somewhat before and after), in England  <br/>
and probably in the U.S. too, a guy could buy a smoke in a pub, and  <br/>
it would be a cheap clay pipe pre-filled with tobacco.  They could be  <br/>
thrown away later, or the guy could take it home and re-use it.  The  <br/>
pipes were white.  They&#39;re in smalltown museums sometimes, and in  <br/>
illustrations for old stories like Rip Van Winkle.  It was like a  <br/>
plastic cup.  Disposable, but not necessarily right away.<br/>
<br/>
They were bisque-fired clay, one firing only, so they weren&#39;t  <br/>
&quot;ceramic,&quot; but were porous and easily breakable.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Here&#39;s an article involving those pipes, a report on an  <br/>
excavation of Brunswick Town<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the most commonly encountered forms of<br/>
material culture on British colonial-era sites in North<br/>
America, smoking pipes clearly represent the power and<br/>
influence that tobacco had on the development of the early<br/>
colonies. Imported white kaolin clay pipes have been found<br/>
in almost every archaeological context imaginable, from<br/>
residences to public buildings to industrial sites to<br/>
agricultural fields, and across lines of socio-economic status<br/>
and gender. The great volume of pipes imported to<br/>
Colonial America by British manufacturers made them an<br/>
inexpensive commodity, an object that was expected to be<br/>
readily discarded and replaced with another. As such, the<br/>
clay tobacco pipe may be considered to be one the first<br/>
disposable products. Archaeologist Ivor NoÃ«l Hume<br/>
(1969:296) observed them to be â€œas expendable as<br/>
cigarettes, though vastly more durable, ensuring that their<br/>
fragments survive in the ground in prodigious quantities.â€<br/>

And others (because they were made in molds) were fancier, but I was  <br/>
thinking of those plainest, cheapest ones.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some photos of others, similar, and some fancier.   This  <br/>
could open a whole new window onto some history you might not want to  <br/>
explore with your kids.  Just warning...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-396071245">This thread has reminded me of a long-standing question I have tried, <br/>
in vain, to find an answer to. Perhaps someone here knows: when and <br/>
why did the British begin measuring for cooking using weight, versus <br/>
volume?<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple 19th century English and Scottish cookbooks, and the <br/>
measurements are all in teacups and dessertspoons and so on, as are <br/>
American ones from the same time period. But now the British <br/>
(Australians? how about you?) measure flour, sugar, etc. by weight. <br/>
Why? When?<br/>
<br/>
I stayed with an English family during part of my spring holiday when <br/>
I was at the University of Edinburgh for a year, and the mother made <br/>
a &quot;snack cake&quot; for me and her two sons. It was so good I asked her for <br/>
the recipe, which began &quot;you weigh three eggs...&quot;. I tuned out at that <br/>
point--I didn&#39;t have a kitchen scale until just a few years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know the history of this difference?<br/>

That is so cool!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wish I would sell all my books, but other times I wish I  <br/>
had every book I had ever owned (like my English version of the first  <br/>
Harry Potter book, which I didn&#39;t keep)...  but in college I had a  <br/>
cookbook called &quot;Housekeeping in Old Virginia,&quot; and one of the  <br/>
recipes began thusly:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Render a pig.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then they told what to do with the various parts and byproducts of  <br/>
all that.  I think at the end you&#39;d end up with a ham, some pies, and  <br/>
some soap, at least. (Joking about that—I don&#39;t remember what one  <br/>
thing the recipe was for.)<br/>
<br/>
My granny&#39;s recipes always involved pinches and smidgens, teaspoons  <br/>
and tablespoons, but she used real teaspoons or tablespoons, not a  <br/>
storebought set of &quot;measuring spoons&quot; and I learned from her to see  <br/>
what it looked like in the palm of my hand instead of really using  <br/>
the spoon.<br/>
<br/>
Now, though, I use measuring spoons and have lots of sets of them,  <br/>
because I just like the way they look.<br/>
<br/>
I like that butter is sold by the pound, but measured in tablespoons  <br/>
and quarter cups and half cups. Maybe that&#39;s the intersection, that  <br/>
1/4 pound of butter is 1/2 a cup, and other measurements come from  <br/>
butter.  I don&#39;t know how butter is packaged and marked other places,  <br/>
but here (speaking of butter paper, again, so soon), it&#39;s in a light  <br/>
cardboard box, one pound.  And usually within that there are four  <br/>
quarter-pound packages, each wrapped in paper.  The paper has  <br/>
markings for half cup, quarter cup, and then all the teaspoon  <br/>
markings starting at the left side, so you can cut it on one of those  <br/>
lines and add that pre-measured block to a recipe.  Maybe that&#39;s  <br/>
still true in all of the English speaking world, and maybe it never was.<br/>
<br/>
My granny (born early 1900&#39;s) got single-pound blocks of butter in  <br/>
her later years, in sets of commodities she got from the State of  <br/>
Texas, because she was on welfare to some extent (&quot;getting  <br/>
commodities&quot;) in the 1960&#39;s.   She didn&#39;t like for the butter to look  <br/>
like it was packaged, because most of her earlier life she had made  <br/>
her own butter, with a hand churn.  So she would leave the butter out  <br/>
in a little bowl, and when it got soft she would press it down with a  <br/>
knife to the shape of the bowl, and leave it in there that way.  That  <br/>
way it reminded her of homemade butter and she was happier for it not  <br/>
to be so obvious she had government butter.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the same grandmother who was in Carizozo, New Mexico in  <br/>
the Nineteen-teens.  That was Mamaw, my dad&#39;s mom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215924365">One thing I find interesting is how the different availibility of <br/>
electricity or the way it is delivered affects what appliances are used. I <br/>
discovered when we moved from South Africa to the USA that electric kettles, <br/>
which are the norm where the current is 220 volts are pretty uncommon in <br/>
America and I had to get used to putting the kettle on the stove (no not my <br/>
electric one - although I wouldn&#39;t put that past me ;-). We had to leave all <br/>
our electrical appliances behind in South Africa anyway, because they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work in America. (Dh and kids are busy watching West Side Story and <br/>
I couldnt avoid the refrain &quot;Everything&#39;s good in America... &quot; from running <br/>
through my head.)<br/>
<br/>
After a few years in Germany I had to invest in a stovetop kettle after our <br/>
move to Italy, for different reasons. Because of a chronic electricity <br/>
supply shortage in Italy, households can only use a limited amount of <br/>
electricity at one time. In our case it was 3 kilowatts (our dishwasher and <br/>
two lights). There was no way I could have, say the kettle and the iron or <br/>
the oven and the vacuum cleaner going together without tripping our <br/>
electricity so I bought a kettle to boil on top of our gas stove. That was <br/>
one of the reasons I was happy to move back to Germany even if it meant that <br/>
homeschooling could get us in trouble with the authorities. Sheesh, do I <br/>
have my priorities wrong or what?<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned comforters, which is also something I had to get used to. <br/>
I prefer duvets with duvet covers, large sized, as we had them in South <br/>
Africa. I paid a lot of money to get a big duvet here in Germany (and had to <br/>
hunt for it too) rather than try to cuddle up to my dh under two teeny <br/>
single duvets. Amazing what one accepts as the norm when one is used to it.<br/>

I recall  requesting a recipe from a woman who grew up in  small-town-Ontario,<br/>
Canada.  It was for some kind of self-saucing  pudding and it called for<br/>
“butter the size of an egg”.  I suspect the  recipe was handed down through<br/>
generations and was written before eggs were  graded for size…<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or before chickens were bred or genetically engineered for different sized  <br/>
eggs.  Maybe at one time all chickens had about the same size eggs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461154284">We have the paper cup machines here, only the cups are plastic.  In some<br/>
office building in Tokyo, they have installed a &quot;use your own cup&quot; hot drink<br/>
machine...it&#39;s a big new thing, everyone thinks!  On the other hand, there<br/>
are &quot;hot&quot; vending machines, that serve little cans of hot coffee and tea.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce pretty much covered the rest of the Japanese vending matching<br/>
thing...I haven&#39;t checked the photos...but there really are machines that<br/>
sell...umm...&quot;used&quot; underwear.  It&#39;s definitely NOT Victoria&#39;s Secret!<br/>
<br/>
There are some weird &quot;all you can eat&quot; restaurants here, but you pay a<br/>
different price based on how long you want to stay, and if you leave too<br/>
much uneaten food on your plate when you&#39;re ready to leave, you have to pay<br/>
an extra fee.<br/>

  machines.   I was assuming they were out of paper cups and had a<br/>

  plastic cups with them, I thought.<br/>

electric teakettle.  Seemed to be a good idea; faster, cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
When I got home I saw one, fat, yellow, plastic, kinda see-through,  <br/>
in the shape of a traditional stove-top teakettle, in a thrift  <br/>
store.  Bought it immediately.  Thought &quot;Cool, they do have them  <br/>
here.&quot;  Then I found it was made in Canada. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They do have them here, but they&#39;re rare and I think more for office  <br/>
use than home.  I don&#39;t use it regularly but I took it with me to the  <br/>
conference in St.Louis, and it&#39;s back in our back...  kitchen, sort  <br/>
of.  We have a place that could be a kitchen.  It has a sink, but no  <br/>
stove/oven, and so sometimes I make tea there and use that kettle.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up without central heating, and in a house without even a  <br/>
swamp cooler (unusual for here).  We didn&#39;t have an automatic  <br/>
washer.  We got a dryer a couple of years before I left home.  Before  <br/>
that, it was wringer washer, hang it on the line.   The only  <br/>
appliances my mom had were a percolator (old-time electric coffee  <br/>
pot) and a hand mixer.    I find myself, still, sometimes GIDDY at  <br/>
having a microwave, dishwasher, washer and dryer.  Keith resists  <br/>
technology.  He doesn&#39;t like to spend money.  Once the technology  <br/>
arrives, he&#39;s totally hooked, but avoids the next wave.  So he  <br/>
resisted DVD players for a long time and now, including computers and  <br/>
DVD players and cars that will play a CD, we must have 20 players.   <br/>
He resisted DVD players; now he lives on DVDs (Babylon 5, Farscape,  <br/>
stuff like that).  We don&#39;t have cellphones.  Weird. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In England even six years ago it seemed every living being had a  <br/>
&quot;mobile&quot; (which the pronounce not as Americans pronounce the word,  <br/>
and not as Alabama pronounces their city, but (how can I indicate  <br/>
it?)    MOH bile    (long &quot;i&quot;, which we reserve for the yellow yuck  <br/>
in one&#39;s digestive system).<br/>
