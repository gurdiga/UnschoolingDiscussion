in the middle of the night so you can sleep.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456319159">On the website I listed it stated to sit in the back middle of the car so<br/>
that you are looking straight out rather than to the sides, as the blur can<br/>
make some people queasy....<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann<br/>
whose other suggestion would be to take a train. I don&#39;t seem to get motion<br/>
sickness in a train, and they are fun!  Don&#39;t laugh this suggestion off<br/>
though it is given with a grin. If you can work it into your budget it just<br/>
may be the ticket.  She can move about, there is a lot of fun in talking to<br/>
other passengers, and you can have a nice meal in the dining car...<br/>

It&#39;s funny how people can be so different. I don&#39;t get carsick or anything <br/>
but the one time I was on a train, I found it awful. Traveled from VA to FL <br/>
on Amtrak and will never do that again. The side to side movement was the <br/>
worst. I couldn&#39;t wait until it all stopped.<br/>

<br/>
She took out her windex to get rid of some of the dirt on the front window,<br/>

Windex snow. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68368428">Thank you so much for all the great ideas.  The fear of elevators is because<br/>
she thinks she might get stuck in there, although this has never happened to<br/>
us.  I get claustrophobic too, but I thought it was because my older<br/>
brothers used to hold pillows over my head. :-(  I have panicked inside dark<br/>
tents.   Now I know I have to sleep with my head close to the entrance.  I<br/>
do have a little motion sickness too, but never when I&#39;m the driver.<br/>
<br/>
I had a discussion with Lisa yesterday, asking her about her concerns and<br/>
sharing some of your ideas.  She said if she must endure the 4 hour ride,<br/>
she would like to stay at Gramma&#39;s for a few days, rather than just one, as<br/>
we would if we went with Dh this weekend.  She also felt as if the trip was<br/>
sprung on her suddenly.  She would prefer to have more advance time to &quot;get<br/>
ready&quot;.  She said peppermint helps, laying down helps, and she liked the<br/>
idea of frequent stops.  She does prefer my car to any other.  We&#39;ve had it<br/>
since before she was born.  She said the &quot;new car smell&quot; of Dad&#39;s truck<br/>
(1999) and Gramma&#39;s car (1995) makes her feel worse.  I&#39;ve thought about<br/>
having a DVD player in the car too.  I wonder if looking at moving objects,<br/>
like a video screen, is better for some kids than looking at a book.  I can<br/>
read in the car though without it bothering me.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that there are other issues involved here for me.  I want to<br/>
please dh by accompnaying him on the weekend trip, and please my mom by<br/>
coming to visit her.  She does come to visit here too, but of course likes<br/>
it when we visit her.  I have plenty of guilt issues going on with my mom.<br/>
I&#39;m very good at guilt!  No matter how much time we spend with her, I hear<br/>
&quot;nobody visits me&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m so sad you are leaving&quot;, rather than just<br/>
&quot;thanks for coming, it was great to see you&quot;.  Well, that is another topic.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding me that what is important is helping my daughter feel<br/>
safe and as comfortable as possible.  We do have dreams of buying some kind<br/>
of bus or motor home for taking road trips in real comfort...  She doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to get sick on buses, but planes are awful for her.  She hasn&#39;t been on<br/>
a train.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779768676">I&#39;ve missed most of this discussion, so I apologize if this is a repeat<br/>
suggestion. Reading in cars (including map reading) has always made me<br/>
ill within seconds! However the effect is ameliorated by chewing gum,<br/>
the only time I use it, and having a breeze on my face from an open<br/>
window. I never get sick reading on buses or trains either, a mystery to<br/>
me why this is so.<br/>
