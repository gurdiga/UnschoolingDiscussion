CBS linked child abuse to homeschooling because they didn&#39;t have the<br/>
balls to link it to fundamentalist freaks. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve wondered for years when the poo would hit the fan.  The first time I<br/>
&gt; saw a copy of Home School Digest<br/>
&gt; I wondered how/ why every homeschooler in the world wasn&#39;t being<br/>
&gt; investigated, with all that &quot;train up a child&quot; crap and their happy<br/>
&gt; advertisements for &quot;THE ROD - the ideal tool for child training.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Religious freedom includes the freedom to hit kids.  Fundamentalist folks<br/>
&gt; are homeschooling to keep their kids away from secular influences.  They<br/>
&gt; *are* homeschooling to isolate their kids and they are &quot;disciplining&quot;<br/>
&gt; their kids and they do keep them away from doctors because they&#39;re afraid<br/>
&gt; of the questions.   It&#39;s bad.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly what you said: fundamentalist freaks.  These are not <br/>
Christians.  THE ROD????  What the heck is that?  Well, I am one of those Christian <br/>
freaks that DOESN&#39;T believe &quot;the rod&quot; means beat your kids.  I had one friend <br/>
tell me it was her God-given right to spank her children.  If anyone can please <br/>
show me that in the Bible???  Everything in the Bible is metaphorical, and the <br/>
rod and the sheep are referred to metaphorically.  Anyone ever read of a <br/>
sheep being beaten by the shepherd?   Not me.  And the other thing-did Jesus stay <br/>
away from secular people and situations?  NO.  How do you share the gospel if <br/>
you only stick to &quot;your kind&quot;?  This isn&#39;t the way those who truly love and <br/>
serve God treat their children, homeschooling or not.  This is the way sicko&#39;s <br/>
treat their children.  <br/>

<br/>
I grew up Baptist.<br/>
They told us &quot;the Bible never contradicts itself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They lied.<br/>
<br/>
There are verses that say not to mix with other people.<br/>
There are verses that say go out and do good and baptize.<br/>
<br/>
Churches pick the ones they like best and then say &quot;the Bible never <br/>
contradicts itself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is sure a great thing, though, for those who have chosen not to <br/>
yoke them selves to unbelievers.<br/>
<br/>
Ah... went to find that Bible reference (it&#39;s II Corinthians 6:14)<br/>
and found a discussion of the very thing, by a Nazarene minister.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-755545585">You are right, I find contradictions all over the place.  I find it difficult <br/>
to find a church for that reason-you can find scriptures to support any cause <br/>
you are trying to support if you take the time to look and have the ability <br/>
to twist things out of context.  So then what is a person to do?  It&#39;s <br/>
heartwrenching if you truly want to follow God and do the &quot;right&quot; thing.  I just try <br/>
to focus on the two main things Jesus said-&quot;Love the Lord God with all your <br/>
heart&quot; and &quot;love one another as you do yourselves&quot;.  But then you hear other <br/>
Christians that say if you ignore the rest of the Bible you are sinning.  It is <br/>
the part of my life I have the most dilemma in dealing with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659849939">P.S.  I do agree with this Nazarene minister, and he explained it very well.  <br/>
However, that really only addresses one issue I internally struggle with, and <br/>
I have been in one homeschool group with I think would dispute that theory.  <br/>
I was told not to shop at Walmart (?), go to Disney (I live in Central <br/>
Florida), or let my children play with children whose parents don&#39;t go to church <br/>
regularly.  My daughter Melody is mentally challenged, and has never been accepted <br/>
in a church.  She was treated much better by peers who haven&#39;t been to church <br/>
than the ones in the church. I don&#39;t think you can judge a person by whether <br/>
or not they go to church.  I don&#39;t think it defines them, and I certainly hope <br/>
it does not define me.<br/>
