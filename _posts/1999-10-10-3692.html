&lt;&lt; I think fathers, with the exception of nursing**, (which is an important<br/>
difference) are capable of nurturing their babies every bit as much as<br/>
mothers. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**and carrying and growing the pre-born<br/>
<br/>
obviously, there are many biological differences.  grant that it may come <br/>
easier for mothers from more than just social/cultural norms?  <br/>
<br/>
i am agreeing with fathers being absolutely capable, but it comes easier for <br/>
the mother --yes bc of cultural norm, but also bc of the way we are.<br/>
