<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052843805">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
This summer we&#39;re taking the kids up to the mountains about once a week. <br/>
We&#39;re taking the tent and lunch and &quot;day camping.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We set up the tent and the baby has a safe place to roll and practice <br/>
crawling, we have naptime in there, it&#39;s way cooler than in town.<br/>
<br/>
We have lunch and snacks there and when it gets dark head back to town. It&#39;s <br/>
about 20 degrees cooler up there than down here, so we really enjoy and look <br/>
forward to it.<br/>
<br/>
:-) Diane</div>
