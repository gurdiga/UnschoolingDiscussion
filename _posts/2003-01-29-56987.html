<br/>
Money!  I had to take Spanish to fulfill a foreign language requirement, and<br/>
also Arts and Humanities classes.  My major was in Nutrition and Dietetics.<br/>
<br/>
But at $96/credit hour, they were making big money requiring me to take<br/>
classes I didn&#39;t need.<br/>

to take ONLY the courses NEEDED!? ANd WHAT would that do to others&#39; GPAs???<br/>

There was (I read here, maybe?) a woman to went to college, took only the <br/>
science courses, and applied to vet school. She was accepted with no <br/>
undergraduated degree. Snazzy!<br/>
