<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734653311">I know *you* all know that :)  I am just figuring it out, and glad I have while my kids are still young.  I have been reading for years different philosophies in learning.  I think I thought I knew and agreed with unschooling, but could not put my finger on it exactly.  I would not claim it.  Now I get it.  My kids do not need me to make all the connections for them in learning.  They are allowed to make their own connections.  What they come up with has been more insightful then what I could &quot;teach&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
A question I have (which may or may not be answerable) is what is something that has made unschooling great in your family?  What is something that you have done or tried that has not been helpful?  Thanks, Michal-mom of 3 boys</div>

Now you get it a little bit more.  There&#39;s always more to get, as kids  <br/>
get older and parents get older.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids do NOT need you to make all the connections for them.  Why  <br/>
did you add &quot;in learning&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that they are &quot;allowed&quot; to make their own connections.  It&#39;s  <br/>
that ONLY they can make the connections, in their own minds.  Nothing  <br/>
on paper is learning.  Nothing recited is learning.  Nothing in a  <br/>
conversation is learning.  Nothing written on this list is learning.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is putting information together in one&#39;s own head so that it  <br/>
makes new and different sense.  It always and only happens inside the  <br/>
learner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804605715">I meant in living, and said learning.  That fortunately is something else I figured out.  I can&#39;t STOP my kids from learning.  That was *such* a weight off my shoulders.  You are right, I get it a bit more, and am excited for the rest.<br/>
