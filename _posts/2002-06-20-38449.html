 </span></blockquote>Luz -- I just loved this. I think it is so helpful for people to realize that <br/>
all the old schoolish ways of thinking are not usually going to just <br/>
magically vanish from our brains when we decide that unschooling is a good <br/>
idea. We&#39;ve grown up being bombarded with the ideas that &quot;school is a child&#39;s <br/>
work&quot; and that &quot;nothing is a higher priority than school&quot; and &quot;school comes <br/>
first&quot; and so on. All those slogans are in there, in our heads. And, even <br/>
though there IS more support and more &quot;evidence&quot; (real live unschoolers, <br/>
growing up and leading interesting, happy, joyful, successful lives), we are <br/>
STILL doing something very &quot;fringy&quot; and if OUR kids turn out to be axe <br/>
murderers or complete sloths - we&#39;ll blame ourselves and so will others think <br/>
it is OUR fault since we did this weird thing and not only didn&#39;t send them <br/>
to school, we didn&#39;t even school them at home. So - I think that if a sense <br/>
of standing precariously on an edge of some sort pops up occasionally, in our <br/>
minds, we shouldn&#39;t be too surprised.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - when that happens, when we have doubts and fears or are discouraged, it <br/>
helps to remember that those feelings sometimes go along with being a parent, <br/>
no matter what educational choice we make. <br/>
<br/>
Since I had a child in school, for a while, I can very easily reassure myself <br/>
by remembering what it was like to be constantly trying to figure out what <br/>
was really going on in her classroom - was the teacher doing a good job? Was <br/>
she treating my child fairly? Was my child learning anything worthwhile? WHAT <br/>
was she really learning? Weren&#39;t they just wasting most of their time there? <br/>
Weren&#39;t there some really awful hidden lessons being taught? Wasn&#39;t my child <br/>
being indoctrinated into a very materialistic worldview with values very <br/>
different than our family&#39;s? Wasn&#39;t the social life of the schoolyard looking <br/>
increasingingly meanspirited and sexualized, even among 9 and 10 year olds? <br/>
Wasn&#39;t my child becoming mostly eager to please the teacher, rather than <br/>
eager to learn? And, finally, even then, wasn&#39;t my child learning a WHOLE lot <br/>
more by following her own interests outside of school than the mostly-twaddle <br/>
she was being exposed to in school - even when it was presented in <br/>
interesting, multiple-intelligence-based ways? <br/>
<br/>
One example of the latter always comes to mind. I was working as a classroom <br/>
volunteer. The &quot;unit&quot; the class was working on was the human body. This <br/>
lesson was about &quot;joints&quot; -- they looked at diagrams of different kinds of <br/>
joints in the human body, memorized names of different parts, and then had <br/>
the &quot;hands-on&quot; part of the lesson which consisted of taping popsicle sticks <br/>
to their thumbs and fingers so that they couldn&#39;t bend the joints and then <br/>
trying to pick up various items such as paper clips, staples, pencils, etc. <br/>
Not a bad idea - lots of fun - gets the point across about the importance of <br/>
joints. Except - there are 35 children in the class and each one needs to <br/>
have the popsicle sticks taped to their fingers. This turns out to be a huge <br/>
mess - the kids don&#39;t have the dexterity to easily tape up each other&#39;s <br/>
fingers. The tape twists and sticks on itself and when they start pulling it <br/>
off - they&#39;re are yelping in pain as it is pulled off their skin. The <br/>
popsicle sticks are so long that they dig into their hands and the kids start <br/>
complaining about the pain. Some do NOT want to do it - they don&#39;t like the <br/>
stuff being stuck to their hands. Many are just frustrated, not being able to <br/>
get the sticks taped on sturdily enough to keep them from bending their <br/>
fingers. It takes FOREVER to get everybody taped up and satisfied. Then - <br/>
they are supposed to be in 5 teams and there are stations with bowls of <br/>
different things to try to pick up at each station. There are recordkeeping <br/>
forms at each station. Each kid is supposed to get a certain amount of time <br/>
and they are supposed to keep track of how many of each item the team was <br/>
able to pick up - how many cotton balls, how many paper clips, etc. They have <br/>
stopwatches but now everybody has to stop and learn to use them. More time <br/>
gone by - and I can see the teacher is getting tense because the time <br/>
allotted for &quot;science&quot; is almost finished and they haven&#39;t even started the <br/>
actual activity yet. So, fnally the teams are starting to pick things up - <br/>
each kid getting 30 seconds for each item. All goes well for a while, but by <br/>
the time they&#39;re moving to the 3rd set of items to pick up, they are <br/>
extrememly BORED and lots of kids are &quot;acting up&quot;. There is a LOT of waiting <br/>
time - always six kids watching while the seventh is doing the picking up. <br/>
When they move to another station, it is just more of the same - with <br/>
different items. They&#39;ve LEARNED the lesson about joints being important - <br/>
but they still have to go through all the stations and keep score even though <br/>
none of them actually CARE who picks up the most items. They&#39;re in the middle <br/>
of this when the bell rings for the 20 minute recess. NO time to take off the <br/>
splints - so they go out wearing them. Of course, that is a big no-no ---- <br/>
the playground aide spends the whole recess removing them from the fingers of <br/>
little boys who are using them as weapons. Recess is over and they return to <br/>
the classroom - they didn&#39;t finish the science activity, but there is no more <br/>
time for that anyway, so they don&#39;t all get to do all the stations and most <br/>
don&#39;t really care except that some items were more fun to fool with than <br/>
others and some kids complain that it isn&#39;t fair that they didn&#39;t get to do <br/>
those.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad - time to go on to &quot;reading workshop.&quot; Before they on the book the <br/>
class is reading together, the teacher asks them to remember what they&#39;d read <br/>
last. Several kids respond to her leading questions and they &quot;review&quot; what&#39;s <br/>
happened up to then in the book. THEN they take out their reading journals <br/>
and they are supposed to write about what they think is going to happen next. <br/>
My daughter has read this book before - so she raises her hand and asks the <br/>
teacher what to write if she already knows what is going to happen. The <br/>
teacher says, &quot;Pretend you don&#39;t know and write what you think you would have <br/>
thought would happen next if you didn&#39;t already know.&quot; (Right - well, this is <br/>
writing that the child is surely going to think really &quot;matters&quot; <br/>
:::sarcasm::::) But she does it. Then they start the reading. One child is <br/>
picked to read aloud - 34 others are supposed to be reading along. I can see <br/>
that most are not - many are just daydreaming, some of doodling or just <br/>
playing with their fingers or hair, few eyes are on the book. Some are <br/>
surreptitiously reading ahead. MY daughter has put another book in her lap - <br/>
she&#39;s reading that while holding the class book up in front of her and I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure the teacher knows it, that this is sort of tacitly okayed by her. <br/>
When it is her turn to read, she looks at the teacher who tells her the page <br/>
number and where to start. <br/>
<br/>
When the reading is finished, finally, it is time for computer lab - once a <br/>
week for an hour or so. The kids are paired up - my daughter is paired with a <br/>
boy who is one of the &quot;behavior problem&quot; kids - a boy who doesn&#39;t yet read <br/>
and is often bored and causing trouble. They have a long list of things they <br/>
are supposed to do - a numbered list. They have 45 minutes to do 30 things. <br/>
They are supposed to alternate, first one does number 1 on the list, then the <br/>
other kid does number 2 on the list, etc. Number one on the list is to drag <br/>
something certain spot.  The other kid doesn&#39;t know how to drag using the <br/>
cursor. So my daughter tries to explain it to him - finally she puts her hand <br/>
on his and tries to help him do it. The computer lab teacher happens to walk <br/>
by right at that moment and snaps at her to let him do his own work. So she <br/>
sits back and doesn&#39;t help him. He got the idea of dragging, but now he <br/>
doesn&#39;t know which WAY to drag it - he doesn&#39;t appear to understand left <br/>
versus right, in fact. I go over and help him and the computer lab teacher <br/>
doesn&#39;t yell at me. My daughter gets to do her item - which takes about 5 <br/>
seconds, and then it is back to the other kid. That&#39;s it - he is never able <br/>
to do his second one and she never gets another turn on the computer. <br/>
Forty-five minutes of sitting, frustrated, not being allowed to help or do <br/>
anything herself. Add to that the time it took to line the kids up and get to <br/>
and from the computer lab.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT did they really learn from all this? This is a REALLY big question and, <br/>
once I started answering it in depth, I couldn&#39;t leave my children there AND <br/>
it led inexorably to unschooling - because a lot of the answers applied <br/>
equally to school-at-home as to school-at-school.<br/>
<br/>
Couldn&#39;t my child have been at home - comfortably sipping a cup of cocoa and <br/>
reading one of her favorite books? Or maybe we could be at the nursery, <br/>
buying ladybugs to release in our garden to control the aphids? Or we could <br/>
be camping? Or going to a museum? Or playing a game? Or amost ANYTHING else <br/>
including just sitting at home chatting or sleeping? <br/>
