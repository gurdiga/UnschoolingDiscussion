way, like my dh did. There is a lot to be said for giving free rein to the <br/>
person who HAS been willing to examine their ideas and research and observe <br/>
and become REALLY convinced of something. Somebody who won&#39;t do that is <br/>
really overly controlling. And, slowly, over the years, my dh has absorbed it <br/>
by osmosis. Or maybe he actually picked up something from all those times he <br/>
fell asleep listening to me talk about it? Nah, it is because the kids are <br/>
growing up and are OBVIOUSLY thoughtful and intelligent and competent and <br/>
filled with passion and enthusiasm and goals and he&#39;s proud of them. I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure he wonders sometimes if they wouldn&#39;t have turned out &quot;better&quot; <br/>
(read that as wanting to major in pre-med instead of art in college) if <br/>
they&#39;d been &quot;schooled&quot; at home or in an institution or at least been more <br/>
&#39;channelled&#39; into more &#39;serious&#39; study. But that&#39;s okay - he can wonder - as <br/>
long as he still supports them and loves them and keeps his own doubts to <br/>
himself.<br/>
