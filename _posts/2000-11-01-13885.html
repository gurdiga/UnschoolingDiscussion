<div id="ygrps-yiv-58469324">Valerie,<br/>
What do you find so objectionable about anime and sci fi?  Is all sci-fi<br/>
bad or just the adolescent stuff she&#39;s reading?  I think there is some<br/>
really great sci-fi literature!  Has she read Isaac Asimov&#39;s Foundation<br/>
trilogy or his robot books?  They are really good IMO.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also found anime to have some powerful messages - have you watched<br/>
any of the films with her or read any of the mongas (sp?)?  There is some<br/>
anime that a lot of 11 year olds wouldn&#39;t be ready for too - too dark for<br/>
sensitive children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be glad to try to help you find some redeeming qualities in these<br/>
interests!  She does need to learn to share things like the computer<br/>
too though so I support you in getting her off so you can have your<br/>
turn.  (I personally hate sharing my computer but we don&#39;t have enough<br/>
for all of us! So even Mommy has to share!!&lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Hi Cindy, Sorry it&#39;s taken so long to answer...my server&#39;s been down (the<br/>
HORROR!)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind anime and sci fi, really. I just don&#39;t like how my 11 yo clamps<br/>
onto some trend and doesn&#39;t come up for air until something even worse comes<br/>
along. Why can&#39;t she be obsessed with French Impressionism for awhile<br/>
instead of (I can hardly bring myself to say this...)&quot;Sailor Moon&quot;? And I<br/>
thought Pokemon was mindless?....this is worse. I&#39;ve told her why I don&#39;t<br/>
like it (because in Japan where it was created it&#39;s mainly about who has the<br/>
biggest tits...try to imagine the character&#39;s banter). But she doesn&#39;t see<br/>
that, she sees the &quot;cool&quot; hair and outfits. What she does is print countless<br/>
pages of Sailor Moon pictures and she and her younger sister color them and<br/>
write &quot;bios&quot; that were also downloaded. My house is swamped with these<br/>
papers.<br/>
<br/>
The _one_ redeeming quality of S.M. (and I looked hard) is Cristina now has<br/>
quite a knowledge of astronomy, since all the characters have the names of<br/>
the planets. A neighbor boy came over to borrow the computer; he had a<br/>
report on Jupiter due for school. Cristina proceeded to tell him all about<br/>
Jupiter. He was impressed, but used the computer anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The books she&#39;s into are like Animporphs only worse....&quot;Other World&quot;. If she<br/>
read only that, I&#39;d protest. We read aloud (Harry Potter right now) and she<br/>
is like her dad and me...she&#39;ll pick up something and read for a few<br/>
minutes, whatever&#39;s laying around (newspaper, magazine, book) so she gets<br/>
variety. But the majority of what she is reading is this Other World series.<br/>
Rather dark. I know she&#39;ll overload on it eventually and move on to<br/>
something else, but I was thinking that with Animorphs.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad is really into science fantasy. He bought C her first of that kind<br/>
recently: Tad Williams&#39; &quot;Mirror World&quot;. She&#39;s only read the first chapter so<br/>
far. Too busy with SM and OW.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it bugs me that she gets so obsessive about these things and expects<br/>
everyone else to be thrilled, too. In fact, she is severely disappointed if<br/>
not bent out of shape if others _don&#39;t_ share her current passion. But that<br/>
doesn&#39;t bother me nearly as much as her Center of the Universe delusion.<br/>
That manifests itself with hogging the bathroom, the computer, leaving her<br/>
junk all over the house, using other people&#39;s stuff without asking, etc,<br/>
etc. She just doesn&#39;t get it or she just doesn&#39;t care or maybe both. I worry<br/>
she will never grow out of it and end up alone with nothing but books and a<br/>
computer for company.<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify...she is very smart and creative and active. Just<br/>
so....self-centered.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s Cristina&#39;s world and we just live in it&quot;. ---Valerie</div>

<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">Do you do any volunteer work anywhere 
that she could come along with you? I&#39;m thinking that if she sees the needs of 
others first hand, it might cause her to alter her universe center a tad. I&#39;d 
try two approaches... 1. volunteer to take your pet to a senior citizens complex 
once a week and see how she deals with the elders. 2. volunteer to help out at a 
children&#39;s center where *she* would be in a &#39;superior&#39; position. See if either 
of those changes her focus.</font></div>
<div><font face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">IMHO, if the parent isn&#39;t happy with 
what her child is interested in, about the only way to change that&nbsp; is to 
alter your direction... shake up your day.... do some other things that will 
keep her busy and away from Sailor Moon. (of course, I don&#39;t think you should 
let her in on your little plan &lt;g&gt;) It sounds to me like you view her 
interest in S.M. and Other Worlds sorta like an addiction. When one is addicted 
to, say cigarettes for example, they way to kick the habit is to alter your 
routine.</font></div>

  take a _lot_ of little children to give her a &quot;good&quot; feeling of superiority 
  rather than what she has now...she has three little sisters and she lords it 
  over them. She is almost old enough to help at ballet with the 3-5 yo&#39;s. I 
  look forward to that. We do some volunteer work, mostly through church and 
  4-H, but it&#39;s hard&nbsp;to get out and do it because of my 4 and 2 yo&#39;s,

  while sorting her haul of candy. I do consider her passions to be like 
  addictions and it seems I&#39;m always trying to heap more worthwhile activities

***Thanks Dierdre. I&#39;ve heard of it, always meant to read it, and keep<br/>
forgetting. The thing with Cristina (11, btw) is she&#39;s been like this since<br/>
she was about 4 years old. Ever see the cartoon &quot;Katie Kaboom&quot; from<br/>
&quot;Animaniacs&quot;? That&#39;s Cristina. My little train of emotion always on the<br/>
verge of derailment. I will read Reviving Ophelia, though. I&#39;m sure it will<br/>
give me some insight.<br/>
