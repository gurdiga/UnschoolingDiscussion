Are you really trying to say that it&#39;s not the NEA that is working hard to<br/>
eliminate, or at least limit and harass homeschooing across the country?<br/>
Gee, if it weren&#39;t, then why are there so many restrictions on our practice?<br/>
What...Are we trying to limit our own freedom?  No. Somebody is behind it.<br/>
Let&#39;s agree that it is the NEA and the other school employee unions, who are<br/>
trying to influence politicians (whose elections they help pay for) to do<br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
In the case in CT this past spring, yes, all it took was one superintendent.<br/>
We were told that he was backed by others, but he was the front man. My<br/>
point was how easy it was for such a person (a legal agent of the state<br/>
school system and therefore with easy access to the legislative process) to<br/>
have a law written, sponsored and presented for approval by a legislative<br/>
committee so that it could be recommended to the full legislature to be<br/>
turned into a LAW that would have virtually eliminated homeschooling from<br/>
this state. Homeschoolers in CT had only three working days warning !<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the NEA is the force behind all the efforts to eliminate homeschooling<br/>
in America. The NEA, you can be sure, put that superintendent up to it, even<br/>
helped write his script for the hearing, and paid for lawyers to help write<br/>
the law. The NEA pays lobbyists in every state capitol and in DC especially,<br/>
and their goal is to fight against our rights to educate our own children.<br/>
To them, it&#39;s a business, and they&#39;re well organized and have truckloads of<br/>
money.<br/>
<br/>
Are you suggesting that this is trivial? Are you suggesting that it is not<br/>
likely ever to happen or that it really can&#39;t have serious consequences for<br/>
unschoolers. In my own prepared short speech to that committee (which I<br/>
didn&#39;t get a chance to give) I was ready to tell the lawmakers that<br/>
everything my wife and I did in order to assure that our child was getting<br/>
educated would have been ILLEGAL under the law they were considering, and<br/>
our son would probably have been taken from our home and put in the &quot;care&quot;<br/>
of welfare and social workers at state-run foster homes, all because of our<br/>
unschooling. I would however, in my defense, have told them that our<br/>
family&#39;s total absence of schooling was the main reason why our son had the<br/>
tools to attend a fine college and achieve at the highest possible academic<br/>
levels for four straight years and graduate Magna Cum Laude.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are in the same war as all other homeschoolers. I don&#39;t think<br/>
that is Off Topic at all.<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to whether Israel is a country....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Interesting that you say that it was one superintendent that caused all<br/>

&gt;Are you really trying to say that it&#39;s not the NEA that is working hard to<br/>
&gt;eliminate, or at least limit and harass homeschooing across the country?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The NEA is trying, but are they succeeding?  Up here, the BCTF has tried, <br/>
but it hasn&#39;t done them any good.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Gee, if it weren&#39;t, then why are there so many restrictions on our practice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, there are none here.  And I think there are at least some states <br/>
where there also are none.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What...Are we trying to limit our own freedom?  No. Somebody is behind it.<br/>
&gt;Let&#39;s agree that it is the NEA and the other school employee unions, who are<br/>
&gt;trying to influence politicians (whose elections they help pay for) to do<br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can agree that they&#39;re trying, in some places.  It seems to me that in a <br/>
democracy, people have the right to try to influence legislation to suit <br/>
them.  And other people have the right to oppose that legislation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt;this state. Homeschoolers in CT had only three working days warning !<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But my point was that superintendents are *not* the NEA.  At least they <br/>
don&#39;t belong to the union here in BC.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;money.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Amazing how unsuccessful they&#39;ve been then.  Really.  The number of <br/>
homeschoolers is going up, not down.  And more and more people from all <br/>
different walks of life are homeschooling, including teachers.  My cousin <br/>
is a teacher who says she wishes she had homeschooled her kids.  She didn&#39;t <br/>
know then that it was possible.  She actually helped influence my son to <br/>
decide not to try high school this year.  Teachers see what goes on in the <br/>
schools, and a lot of them don&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you suggesting that this is trivial?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s trivial, but it reminds me of some of the people in the <br/>
50&#39;s, who saw communists under every bed.  I just don&#39;t believe in the big <br/>
conspiracy theory.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you suggesting that it is not<br/>
&gt;likely ever to happen or that it really can&#39;t have serious consequences for<br/>
&gt;unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that you had a threat in your state.  It seems to have been stopped <br/>
by homeschoolers working against it.  Democracy in action.  I don&#39;t believe <br/>
that government bureaucrats sit around all day dreaming up ways to force <br/>
homeschoolers into the schools.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would have been a good speech.  Too bad you didn&#39;t get to give it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Unschoolers are in the same war as all other homeschoolers. I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt;that is Off Topic at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not in a war.  One of many reasons why I left the U.S. is the tendency <br/>
there to turn everything into a war.  (war on poverty, war on drugs, <br/>
etc.)  I&#39;m really a pretty peaceable person.<br/>
