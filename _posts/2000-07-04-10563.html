&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is a lifetime ahead of you Tracy, wait until your children are older,<br/>
&gt;give all to them now. You will have so much more to give in ten years time.<br/>
&gt;We really do want to do everything NOW, don&#39;t we? The problem isn&#39;t going<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been following this thread with interest... I don&#39;t think you have to <br/>
wait to help other mothers or even do something as formal and time-consuming <br/>
as volunteering regularly in a teen mothers&#39; home. If people are looking for <br/>
guidance, they will join a group, like La Leche or a playgroup, or attend a <br/>
mom-and-tot type program. Sometimes they just turn up at the park, longing <br/>
for another mom to talk to. You can do a lot just by being an experienced <br/>
mother and a good listener. Just by modeling patient, loving, responsive <br/>
parenting, sympathizing with their woes by telling stories about how you <br/>
survived sleepless nights or nursing strikes or the terrible twos, you can <br/>
give younger moms confidence and hope and an example to follow. I have <br/>
learned a lot in situations like this, as a new mom. And in turn, I have <br/>
tried to offer suggestions -- when asked -- and model the type of parenting <br/>
I believe in when I&#39;m in those situations.<br/>
<br/>
I applaud your urge to help others, and I have a feeling that just by being <br/>
you and taking your children out in public, you are doing more good than you <br/>
know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693568438">Why thank you!  I know that there are opportunities to help others <br/>
in other ways, I am a LLL Leader Applicant myself, for one thing <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  But this is just a pet idea of mine, that think needs tackling, <br/>
as I said, before I become &#39;irrelevant,&#39; to such folk.  I&#39;m not even <br/>
talking about volunteering in a &#39;teen mums home,&#39; I don&#39;t think <br/>
they even exist around here!  But I am considering contacting the <br/>
local Social Services dept (very, very carefully, even though our <br/>
council is friendly to home-ed) to see who and what services are <br/>
there for teenage parents, and whether one could get involved.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone for the encouragement, it is something I&#39;ve <br/>
thought about ever since I started my family.<br/>
<br/>
Tracy<br/>
