<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498390301"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How far would you go in encouraging a kid to stick with something<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ve started? My 10yo unschooler has been bugging us for the past<br/>
&gt; year to give him viola lessons (he has a passion for classical<br/>
&gt; music). <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, Beth, I think that you&#39;re talking about one issue and this involves<br/>
another.  Does your son want to *quit* viola and you want him to keep going,<br/>
or are you having problems getting him to practice regularly?  In my mind,<br/>
those are seperate issues.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He has two one-hour lessons a<br/>
&gt; week and is expected to practice at home at least 5 days/week. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t *make* him practice that often;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>2 hours is a lotta lesson time.  5 practice sessions a week on top of that<br/>
is absurd, IMHO.  That&#39;s basically expecting the &quot;only practice on the days<br/>
you eat&quot; thing.  I don&#39;t feel like practicing every day, why would a kid?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He has not asked to quit (yet), but practice sessions are becoming a<br/>
&gt; bit of a battlefield. .....I&#39;m having trouble convincing him that the rewards<br/>
&gt; are worth the frustration!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>10 year olds truly vary in their abilities to accomplish something without<br/>
parental direction.  Some actually can, some need help getting going but can<br/>
take it from there, and many truly need someone there the whole time.<br/>
Remember that when you practice, you&#39;re tackling something &quot;new&quot; at each<br/>
moment, because you&#39;re supposedly learning new patterns, solving problems,<br/>
improving sound or whatever.  It&#39;s not like legos, for example, where you<br/>
helped your child understand the directions the very first time they built<br/>
something, and now they can take it from there.<br/>
<br/>
I try to get parents to attend lessons, when possible, and practice<br/>
regularly with their children, when possible, until the *child* asks that<br/>
they go it alone.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my drill for parents: If you&#39;re encouraging your child to practice,<br/>
agree on the time, or that right now is a good time.  Take out the<br/>
instrument together.  You could hold the viola while he tightens the bow.<br/>
Help him set up the music, put on the shoulder rest, etc.  Ask what he&#39;s<br/>
going to play through first.  (Encourage him to start with something he<br/>
knows well, to warm up.)  Ask (or remind, if you attended the lesson) what<br/>
his teacher was asking him to work on this week -- improving his bow grip,<br/>
holding his viola up, whatever.  Help him do that, on the piece he knows<br/>
well, if needed.  (Parents can hold the instrument in the right place so the<br/>
child gets a feel for it, help periodically push a wrist out that&#39;s bending<br/>
in, etc.).  <br/>
<br/>
Then look at whatever piece(s) he&#39;s supposed to be working on right now.<br/>
Have him play a bit of it.  One line or so.  Ask if he&#39;s happy with it.<br/>
(It&#39;s OK if he&#39;s happy with it!)  Are there problems that need fixing?  Can<br/>
he go back and do it again to improve just that one thing he didn&#39;t like?<br/>
<br/>
Children don&#39;t innately understand that with music, you have to figure out<br/>
every little bit, and it may take 5 tries to get it right.  You will have to<br/>
help with that.  I find that kids get angry because it&#39;s not going well, and<br/>
I spend a lot of time trying to teach them to not get instantly mad.   I<br/>
teach that first, you identify the problem.  (I have them say it out loud.)<br/>
Then decide what will solve it, and then try again.  For example, it&#39;s all<br/>
out of tune.  Sounds awful.  I need to move my whole hand up a little bit.<br/>
Now try it.  Or, the sound is squeaky.  I think it&#39;s my bow; it must be too<br/>
close to the bridge.  Let me put it farther away and try again.  (If you&#39;re<br/>
regularly coming across problems he can&#39;t solve, it&#39;s time for a list for<br/>
the teacher.)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that sounds stilted.  But it&#39;s a good habit to get into, and it works.<br/>
It teaches the child to solve, rather than react to the problem.  Oh, and<br/>
one more thing.  When it&#39;s good, have them stop and say say so!  I see kids<br/>
all the time who never tell themselves anything about their playing unless<br/>
it&#39;s bad.  Well, duh, of course they don&#39;t want to practice!<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas: If his teacher asked him to practice some little part several<br/>
times, sweeten the deal a bit.  Break out the M&M&#39;s, and put some on the<br/>
stand.  Eat one each time you do it right.  Applaud accomplishments -- it<br/>
may look like no big deal to you to fix that bent wrist, but trust me, it&#39;s<br/>
a tough thing to do.  Tell your husband over dinner how well today&#39;s<br/>
practice went.  Call the grandparents and play the piece over the phone.<br/>
<br/>
If your son tells you to go away, you&#39;re being a pest, respect that, but do<br/>
something in the next room, instead.  Be prepared to be interrupted to help.<br/>
Don&#39;t be a pest, but do be availalbe.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I tell my students&#39; parents that when their children ask to quit,<br/>
they need to talk about what the problem is. Do they need help practicing?<br/>
Do they not like their teacher?  Is the instrument in need of some repair so<br/>
it&#39;s easier to play (check with the teacher on this one)?  Is their lesson<br/>
or practice time at a bad time for them (during their favorite TV show?)?<br/>
Are they being teased for playing something &quot;stupid&quot;? Or do they just not<br/>
like the sound of the instrument anymore, and would rather do something<br/>
else?  It&#39;s ok to quit if you don&#39;t like it!  I quit things I hate.  I&#39;ve<br/>
also quit music before, and I&#39;ve been playing for 25 years.  Sometime you<br/>
need a bit of time off to miss it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, this is a big issue to me, did you get that impression!? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Last night Holly was in the next room and I frustrated her accidently.<br/>
<br/>
She was doing some two-note thing, a Puppet Theatre bit of some sort, and <br/>
although the rhythm changed the two notes didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;The second note is too low.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was NOT helpful to her, since it turned out &quot;the second note&quot; was the <br/>
open string.  But I was in the other room, and forgetting, being more used to <br/>
recorders and vocal, that one of those notes wasn&#39;t changeable.  So the thing <br/>
that was important for her to know was the FIRST note was sharp.  <br/>
<br/>
Too frustrating and confusing, so I just said &quot;Sorry, never mind.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I liked it.  I like real people&#39;s real stories a lot!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my musical outline:<br/>
<br/>
Started piano at five, played a year, quit.<br/>
Started clarinet at ten, fifth grade, played for five years.<br/>
Started piano again at 11, quit; started again at 12, took lessons for three <br/>
years.<br/>
Sold the clarinet to buy a guitar at 15.  Folk-style finger-picking, <br/>
accompaniment to singing.<br/>
Got a recorder at 17.  Learned to play it without effort, got to the point of <br/>
performing Telemann in public, left the city for the small town, taught <br/>
others (easier stuff).<br/>
<br/>
Vocal, separate from the above<br/>
sang for fun, mom sang for fun (country and western, with guitar)<br/>
harmonized at nine, out in the yard<br/>
loved singing lessons in school, when we had them<br/>
Sang at church from nine.  Soloed at 11?<br/>
Choir in Jr. High and High school<br/>
made All-State Mixed choir when I was a junior, but left high school that <br/>
year to go to college.<br/>
<br/>
Have sung ballads, madrigals, medieval carols, Sacred Harp (18th century <br/>
shape-note hymns) over the years, and lately.<br/>
<br/>
I have never been GREAT or remarkable at any one instrument.  I&#39;ve never been <br/>
considered &quot;accomplished&quot; at any one.  BUT...  I have friends who have been.  <br/>
I&#39;ve known people who studied an instrument intensely for ten years, but as <br/>
soon as they left school they never touched it again.  Lots of people.<br/>
<br/>
I know a couple who were great at piano very early on, and both still play.  <br/>
One runs the music department at her church.  The other did jazz bands in <br/>
bars.  (I&#39;ve lately lost contact.)<br/>
<br/>
More of my friends who still do music never took any music in school.  That&#39;s <br/>
interesting, huh?  Those who play guitar learned it on their own (as I did, <br/>
too) and many of them still play.  One drummer who was in band with me is <br/>
still playing drums in bands sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Every city choir and orchestra, every pipe and drum band, every historical <br/>
brass band (Albuquerque has a civil war band!) has some people who knew the <br/>
instrument since childhood and others who learned as adults.<br/>
<br/>
I think music is something one has or doesn&#39;t have.  I think a good musical <br/>
aptitude can be destroyed or discouraged, but not created.<br/>

I absolutely agree!! The instructors send home a practice sheet every <br/>
week. The kids are supposed to check off each practice item and then <br/>
the parents are supposed to sign off. SO SCHOOLISH! I hate it, which <br/>
is why I don&#39;t expect him to practice everyday and he only practices <br/>

you said above (I am also musically gifted) and I attend every single <br/>
lesson with him so that I know what the instructors expect him to <br/>
work on (and what we can leave aside). Unfortunately since these are <br/>
group lessons (there are about 30 kids at each lesson with 3 <br/>
instructors that take turns teaching while the other 2 roam around <br/>
the class) we&#39;re running into the typical &quot;teach to the middle&quot; <br/>
mentality that leaves out the slower/faster kids. They&#39;re doing a <br/>
good job of teaching the basics but sometimes I really squirm when <br/>
they do truly pointless exercises and talk to the kids like they&#39;re <br/>
all slightly brain damaged. :/<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Brenda, obviously this is a big issue for me too! Our house has <br/>
always been full of music. I sing, play guitar, a little piano, and <br/>
now I&#39;m learning the viola right along with ds! My dh also plays <br/>
guitar. Our son has always been musically inclined and he says he <br/>
enjoys his viola lessons. However, he seems to have inherited his <br/>
mom&#39;s perfectionist tendencies and becomes easily frustrated. Music <br/>
lessons are not the only area in which we deal with this issue. It&#39;s <br/>
one of the reasons we unschool.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve asked (and so far he&#39;s agreed) that he stick with these lessons <br/>
until the end of the semester, at which time he can keep going, take <br/>
a break or outright quit. We keep reminding him of how thoroughly <br/>
frustrated he gets when he first plays a new video game. He <br/>
eventually figures out what needs to be done in order to succeed <br/>
(while playing for hours on end; he actually learned to read by <br/>
playing them) and THEN he loves them. But until then he rants and <br/>
raves and throws major FITS! I&#39;ve pointed out to him that sometimes <br/>
learning any new skill (like playing the viola) can be just as <br/>
frustrating AND just as rewarding as mastering his games. In fact if <br/>
he practiced the viola as often as he plays video games he&#39;d be a <br/>
virtuoso in no time! &lt;lol&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You know, I think I&#39;ll just lay off for awhile and let him know that <br/>
it&#39;s up to him to come and get me when he wants to practice. Who <br/>
knows, maybe if he goes to a lesson or two unprepared (he can&#39;t stand <br/>
feeling confused) he just might decide to practice after all.<br/>
<br/>

ps(Now he wants to play the xylophone(!) so we&#39;re looking into that <br/>
too.)</div>

 </span></blockquote>I definitely agree with this. My brother is gifted...he started violin in 4th<br/>
grade (I always found it interesting that they offered orchestra instruments<br/>
a year before band instruments trying to get more kids in the orchestra). Picked<br/>
up tuba in high school so he could be in the marching band (while still playing<br/>
violin in the orchestra). Taught himself bass guitar. Can play the bass line of<br/>
any song just by listening to it (I can barely pick out the bass line LOL!).<br/>
Went to Phoenix with his band, is now in San Diego. Still plays bass and teaches<br/>
guitar. His students love him because he has long hair, a tattoo on his chest, nipple<br/>
ring and tongue stud. He makes violin &quot;cool&quot; for the kids mainly because he really <br/>
loves it. My brother did &quot;ok&quot; in school, mostly C&#39;s and B&#39;s (whereas I was the <br/>
straight A student). Never went to college, but is now (at 32) taking classes at the <br/>
community college to help with the recording work that he does.<br/>
<br/>
I played clarinet starting in 5th grade all through college. I enjoyed it more for the <br/>
social aspect of it. I loved marching band and was active in high school as well<br/>
as at Virginia Tech (good thing too, because I met my hubby there...he played baritone).<br/>
My last year at Tech, I asked our director if I could skip the audition and just play <br/>
the 3rd clarinet part. I HATED auditions with a passion. He agreed and I loved being <br/>
down near the bottom...got to sit with a sophomore friend of mine who was a music major <br/>
and we had a  blast. I do not however consider myself overly musical. I can read music, <br/>
but I have not had any desire to touch my clarinet since I graduated. I do however <br/>
absolutely love classical music and still get a kick out of hearing music on the radio <br/>
that I played (although it is getting harder to remember if I played it in high school <br/>
or college!) Actually one of the things that I had to work through when I decided<br/>
to homeschool was that I would never be a &quot;band mom&quot;. Although we do have a local home<br/>
school band and there is always Drum Corps International (DCI) which my husband did <br/>
when he was in high school (marching band competitions throughout the summer...great shows<br/>
if you ever have one around you, check it out. They have the national championships<br/>
on PBS around thanksgiving. Powerful stuff. Jason loves it)<br/>
<br/>
As far as xylophone lessons...that is a neat instrument...definitely check out a DCI <br/>
show. I love to watch the xylophones in the pit...pretty incredible what they can do.<br/>

&lt;&lt; We keep reminding him of how thoroughly <br/>
frustrated he gets when he first plays a new video game.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s interesting.  I&#39;ve likened playing piano with playing video games, <br/>
talking to my kids too.  There&#39;s a pattern to follow, you hit the right <br/>
&quot;buttons&quot; in complex patterns...  (We&#39;ve also talked about musicality, <br/>
because Holly has some friends who &quot;hit the right buttons&quot; on their <br/>
instruments, but never make music, so not to say we haven&#39;t talked about <br/>
more...)<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve said &quot;winning the game&quot; is knowing a whole piece well enough not to <br/>
&quot;game over&quot; before the end.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I&#39;m feeling hyper, maybe doing a lot of housework and wishing <br/>
I weren&#39;t, sometimes I put music at the keyboard, and sit and play until the <br/>
third mistake, which I consider &quot;losing,&quot; and then I go work some more.  Next <br/>
time I sit, I only play until the third error, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Lame, but real. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Who <br/>
knows, maybe if he goes to a lesson or two unprepared (he can&#39;t stand <br/>
feeling confused) he just might decide to practice after all.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll learn to do what I used to do!! I perceived that my teacher <br/>
wanted to see progress.  I would sight read badly at one lesson, and sight <br/>
read well at the next one!  She felt like a good teacher.  During the week I <br/>
would play whatever I liked, and sometimes even the assigned piece.<br/>

<br/>
I have NEVER been sorry about friends I&#39;ve met through  musical activities.  <br/>
Either I&#39;m prejudiced and think all the brightest people are musicians, or <br/>
there&#39;s something about the mind-workings of musicians that makes them easier <br/>
for me to understand and get along with.    That&#39;s easy to expect from others <br/>
who are very physical, or very verbal, or intuitive.  It&#39;s not that I want to <br/>
do music with  my musician buddies all the time, or even to LISTEN to <br/>
similarly-shared music, but it&#39;s something about the way they see the world <br/>
and organize their thoughts that resonates with me.<br/>
<br/>
Am I imagining this?  Can anyone else shed light on it?<br/>
<br/>
I met my husband singing with him in a madrigal group.<br/>
I&#39;ve never had a boyfriend who wasn&#39;t a musician, back to 7th grade.  I <br/>
wonder about my first grade boyfriend, Michael Barrens, who was in Fort <br/>
Worth.  Anyone know him?  I bet he&#39;s a musician. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Actually one of the things that I had to work through when I decided<br/>
to homeschool was that I would never be a &quot;band mom&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I both grieved band, and nothing else, when we figured out our kids <br/>
weren&#39;t going to go to school ever. <br/>
<br/>
Kirby joined the homeschool band one year to play clarinet, but flat quit <br/>
after the second session.  I was sad, but I understood.  Marty sings.  I hear <br/>
him around the house.  And he has borrowed my rosewood ocarina, and I hear <br/>
him playing it sometimes, goofing with the fingering chart and playing easy <br/>
songs.  Holly has a guitar but hasn&#39;t picked it up lately, she has some songs <br/>
she&#39;s found or made up on the piano, sings LOTS, and plays fiddle joyfully <br/>
(though not yet smoothly).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you are imagining this. I too get along MUCH better <br/>
with other &quot;musical types&quot;. I think it may have to do with the fact <br/>
that music is a unique language, and just like we feel a connection <br/>
to others who speak our native tongue (especially if we&#39;re surrounded <br/>
by those who don&#39;t) we feel a certain connection with those who <br/>
understand the language of music.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had three major love relationships in my life. The first guy was <br/>
completely UNmusical; that one ended in total disaster. The second <br/>
was sort of musical; I was with him for 5 years. However, the man I <br/>
finally married is VERY musical and a talented guitarist. We&#39;ve been <br/>
together 12 years. Just a theory.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644872861">Hmmm. I never really thought about this, but I have always dated guys in the band. THe<br/>
one guy I dated my freshman year in college who was not in the band was really cute, but <br/>
we just did not have any kind of spark. It only lasted one or two dates if I remember.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. I never realized that I only dated band geeks! Interesting....<br/>
