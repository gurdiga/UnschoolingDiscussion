extend their interst with legos. Search the web for<br/>
lego sites. There are lot of people out there who are<br/>
lego fanatics. Check your local library for book on<br/>
legos. We checked one out on the history of Legos. <br/>
There are lots of cool pictures and idea makers for<br/>
more projects with them. <br/>

Where we live there was for a time a lego &#39;club&#39; when<br/>
some homeschoolers got together and did lego building<br/>
together. I think some of the parents showed how to do<br/>
some stuff and the kids watched or not.<br/>

&gt;&gt; My sons (6 & 8) build some incredible things with<br/>
&gt;&gt; legos.  I think the 8 yr olds<br/>
&gt;&gt; are quite great!      I have often wondered how to<br/>

with a computer game (we highly recommend Putt Putt Travels Through Time,<br/>
just in case anyone&#39;s interested &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was sitting at the desk with her, playing with two Pokemon<br/>
figures. They were hopping around one of those big flat Lego green building<br/>
squares (about 12&quot; by 12&quot; I think), on which Brit (almost-7) had built an<br/>
honest-to-goodness MAZE out of Legos.<br/>
<br/>
It had an entrance and and exit and twists and turns and dead-ends and traps<br/>
and the aisles in the maze were all the same width.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been so impressed since the last time I gave birth. &lt;g&gt; I didn&#39;t<br/>
even know she really knew much about what a maze was, much less how to go<br/>
out and BUILD one.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a Lego Nut -- he builds kits and when we&#39;ve cleared enough<br/>
garage space this fall he&#39;s going to have his Lego trains and town buildings<br/>
all set up out there and I envision a lot of Dad and the Girls time<br/>
tinkering with this layout or that. I know he&#39;s found all manner of websites<br/>
besides the obvious Lego.com, and there are a LOT of clubs out there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90097469">Some homeschooling moms around here are doing some sort of Lego robot thing,<br/>
not sure what that is about, but you might be able to find some information<br/>
about it.<br/>
I believe it was a camp they had to go to , and there were some<br/>
competitions... my DH is totally into it, but I don&#39;t have him here to tell<br/>
me what it is :)<br/>
<br/>
We have a large 55 gallon garbage can full of my husband&#39;s old legos, he<br/>
always talks me into buying more for our son (who is 2) and DH will just<br/>
&quot;keep them safe&quot; until our son is old enough to play with them :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>         Lego Mindstorm. They were created by the guys at that MIT lab <br/>
where they come up with all sorts of weird things (like computers in your <br/>
shoes and stuff).<br/>
<br/>
         Lego Mindstorm is GREAT, but it is something that you definitely <br/>
need to work with your kids on if they are younger (say, anywhere from 6 to <br/>
12 or so). Older kids may enjoy going through the various technical books <br/>
including the For Dummies book (ISBN 0764507672), Creative Projects with <br/>
Lego Mindstorms (ISBN 0201708957) or the O&#39;Reilly Unofficial Mindstorm <br/>
manual (ISBN 1565926927).<br/>
<br/>
         Mindstorms allow you to build all sorts of robots and program them <br/>
directly or using your computer (depending on the set and the complexity of <br/>
the program). The key to them is a CPU Brick that can be connected to all <br/>
sorts of sensors and motors. There is a very simple language for <br/>
programming Mindstorms, but when you get bored of that or reach the limits <br/>
of that language, you can use various freeware and shareware products to <br/>
develop new programs using C and other common programming languages.<br/>
