<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995255190">Good morning ya&#39;ll,<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that most if not all of you have had to deal with others <br/>
(family, friends or complete strangers for that matter)tell you that <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling is not healthy and that you need to put <br/>
your kids in school.  I hear this:  Your kids are so sweet, so well <br/>
behaved and smart, but I feel that I need to say this...&quot;You need to <br/>
put those kids in school!!! They need socialization and what about <br/>
all they&#39;ll miss learining in school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t so much care what they think, but at the same time I never <br/>
have any snappy comeback.  Matter of fact with the above comment, <br/>
which was is by the way an exact quote, I responded if they are so <br/>
well behaved, sweet and smart how do you think they got that way?  <br/>
Only the oldest has ever been to school and that was only part of <br/>
kindergarten for half the year before we pulled him out.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I feel like if I had statistics on how lousy of a job <br/>
schools do I would have a more of a leg up on those who challenge me <br/>
all the time.  It seems from reading here for a while that you all <br/>
know all kinds of facts or just stuff in general about the ps <br/>
system.  I read and study all the time about UNSCHOOLING!!!  I am <br/>
trying to fix broken relationships, learn how to better respect and <br/>
encourage my kids.  I don&#39;t have time to read all the other stuff <br/>
about ps.  <br/>
<br/>
Well I was just wondering if there were others like me.  Others who <br/>
just don&#39;t have the time to keep up with what ps does since it <br/>
really doesn&#39;t affect what I am doing with my kids.  I also find it <br/>
too depressing.  I just wish that our lives would be proof enough <br/>
that this is the right way...at least for us!  Why should others <br/>
demand proof of our choices?  Esp. when I am not trying to tell them <br/>
they have to do it my way!!!<br/>

them how to live their life and I most certainly would only offer my <br/>
opinion or advice if they sincerely requested it.  (even then with <br/>

that I&#39;m still a newby to unschooling is that my family is filled <br/>
with kids who LOVE and THRIVE in the school setting.  Using &quot;stats&quot; <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work because they are happy in school, their friends are <br/>
happy, the family relationship is happy.  Despite the fact that they <br/>
run around and not only do school but sports and extra-curricular <br/>
clubs, everyone is happy.  The friends I have, the same, their <br/>
children absolutely love school and cannot imagine life without it.  <br/>
They still have passions and joy and love learning, so this whole <br/>
philosophy does not fly with them.  My step-brother and wife and <br/>
kids go camping and fishing all of the time, etc.  My Aunt and <br/>
Uncles children love school and still explore their passions and <br/>
they do much just like my brothers family. <br/>
<br/>
Too them kids can truly enjoy life despite being schooled and &quot;to <br/>

<br/>
Yeah.  The main difference people notice about homeschooled kids is that <br/>
they are nicer and can talk to adults.  &quot;Oh, no!&quot; people shudder, &quot;those <br/>
homeschooled kids are so different!&quot;  (Give me a break!)<br/>
<br/>
My potential snappy comeback is that if I thought my kid was going to <br/>
grow up and go to prison, I&#39;d send him to Jr. High School now to toughen <br/>
him up and teach him those institutional rules.  Otherwise it is <br/>
irrelevant.<br/>

<br/>
Well I was just wondering if there were others like me.  Others who <br/>
just don&#39;t have the time to keep up with what ps does since it <br/>
really doesn&#39;t affect what I am doing with my kids.  I also find it <br/>
too depressing.  I just wish that our lives would be proof enough <br/>
that this is the right way...at least for us!  Why should others <br/>
demand proof of our choices?  Esp. when I am not trying to tell them <br/>
they have to do it my way!!!<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Well, I keep up with the progressive private school goings-on, so that&#39;s why I was SOOOO taken aback by what I found on Michael&#39;s site. I really thought the schools were trying (&#39;though failing miserably!) to be better. I thought they were putting out *some* kind of effort to make schools a better place to be and to move into the 21st century. Hell, there are new schools and school buildings going up here every month! We have &quot;Speaking of Schools&quot; on NPR (and although I hardly ever agree with them, they seem to be *trying*). There are reports almost weekly on the local news about changes they want to see. The Superintendent of Education is *highly* visible and in the news almost daily----but then again, she wants to be governor---and test the hell out of kids!<br/>
 <br/>
But I guess I was wrong. Or deluded. Or sheltered. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
But I have rude awakenings every now and then: We had two convicts escape a couple of weeks ago. All the area schools were in lock-down. No one in or out. Our 12 year old neighbor said that they weren&#39;t even allowed to go to the bathroom all day---just allowed to change classes. One girl had diarrhea. Eleven years old.<br/>
 <br/>
We also have a &quot;Reading First&quot; elementary school---it&#39;s where Duncan is zoned. What the HELL does that *mean*, anyway???<br/>
 <br/>
But to answer your question... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I have no faith that someone who doesn&#39;t know me OR my children will know what they need to know. I *DO* know that Cameron&#39;s friends are having a really hard time in high school now---and I&#39;m NOT talking academically: they&#39;re all &quot;passing&quot; their classes. They&#39;re having a hard time emotionally, spiritually (not Christian-based---but in their own hearts---the &quot;breath&quot; part of spiritual), socially, economically---not to mention relationship-wise with their families and with the world. They have no direction. No passions. NOTHING. They&#39;re empty.<br/>
 <br/>
My unschooled teen is RICH with ALL those things. I have all the proof *I* need. I usually just wave my hand and say that the proof is in the pudding. And I&#39;m a patient cook. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well, if this stops working, we&#39;ll put him in school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those relatives and friends have a couple of motivations when they say what <br/>
they say.   They want to comfort themselves with assurance (all involving the <br/>
voice in their heads, and the children they once were) that school was good for <br/>
them in some way, that they didn&#39;t go to school for nothing.   You&#39;re coming <br/>
dangerously close to causing them to have to review everything in their whole <br/>
lives and they don&#39;t want to do do that.    The other thing they want to feel <br/>
better about is that you haven&#39;t gone totally insane, and so if you say &quot;If <br/>
this doesn&#39;t work, we&#39;ll put him in school,&quot; they will feel that you&#39;re <br/>
constantly assessing the situation and that school IS an option for you, and that <br/>
maybe they will have their own nervous fears soothed in the end, and that THEY <br/>
(not you) will get to say &quot;I told you so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let them have that little hope.   It will keep them calmer and quieter, and <br/>
it will also probably make them more likely to really look at your kids not in <br/>
the light of their being lost forever, but as possible future schoolkids.    <br/>
It costs you nothing, and defuses the hostility.<br/>

***Oh Sandra,  <br/>
<br/>
You sound just like my peace loving husband.  So sweet and <br/>
considerate.  I always open mouth and insert foot, leg, hips you get <br/>
my point.  I am never trying to be nasty or even challenging, but I <br/>
guess I am found offensive in my efforts to defend why our children <br/>
are not in school.<br/>
<br/>
My husband always just yes&#39;s what he can, calmly stands his ground <br/>
when he can&#39;t agree and remains unscathed the whole while.  Me, I <br/>
tend to feel defensive all deep down inside and it feels like I am <br/>
being tortured and if they keep it up long enough we&#39;ll &quot;see the <br/>
light&quot; so to speak.  <br/>
<br/>
I like your idea and will probably use that very line the next time <br/>
I am under fire.  With school teachers in the family maybe they <br/>
won&#39;t feel as personally insulted by our choosing to keep our <br/>
children home as it seems they do now.  <br/>
<br/>
We have expressed to most of these people that one of the major <br/>
reasons that we keep our children out of school is because we feel <br/>
that we love them, know them and care about their future and <br/>
happiness more than anyone else every will.  It&#39;s nothing personal <br/>
against them it is just how we feel.<br/>

else.  I can&#39;t imagine calling up my ______ and telling them &quot;Hey I <br/>

In any given setting I feel very strongly that no other person <br/>
should ever be so comfortable with another human being to just blurt <br/>
out whatever is on their mind with out regard as to the other <br/>
persons feelings.  For example &quot;I really don&#39;t think you should wear <br/>
your hair like that it looks like crap!&quot;  Happens all the time, I <br/>
don&#39;t get it maybe it is just me.  Maybe I am naive to what is <br/>

One of the Blue Collar comedians (sorry---can&#39;t remember his name) has an opening that&#39;s similar to how I feel this time of year. Ben, my husband, has a brother who&#39;s a medical doctor, a sister who is a teacher, and two sisters who are nurses.<br/>

But this comedian&#39;s opener is: I have a brother who&#39;s a doctor, a sister who&#39;s a lawyer,...<br/>

always thought &quot;But why would it not work!?   It works GREAT,&quot; and I didn&#39;t say <br/>
it.    Because honestly, at the heart of it, if it HAD stopped working, <br/>
schools are all around us.   Free government schools that would welcome my children <br/>
with open arms, and snarky comments on the side, probably, that they would <br/>
have to eat later, but hey... none of that was going to be my problem.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby never did go to school and he&#39;s 19 now.<br/>
Marty never did go to school and he&#39;s 16.   Nearly past the compulsory <br/>
attendance point.<br/>
Holly liked to visit school; visited Monte Vista Elementary, visited in <br/>
England (wore a uniform and everything), visited Sandia Prep school, seriously <br/>
considered going to 8th grade at the nearest mid-school.    She decided not to go <br/>
to school.   She&#39;s 14.   She still might.   But from my own point of view, <br/>
&quot;it&#39;s still working,&quot; and so I won&#39;t put her in school.<br/>

3. A Google News search for &quot;assault at school&quot; resulted in 6,510 hits. <br/>
We don&#39;t have enough medical coverage for that kind of socialization. <br/>
4. The only other people compelled into institutions are convicted<br/>

5. I would but they have ATT.  &lt; autodidactic traits and tendencies&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380023179">I don&#39;t have any answers for you really. Your question did bring up <br/>
things for me though.  I see most unschoolers talk about how &#39;good&#39; <br/>
their childrens&#39; behaviour is. My daughter is not always good. Her <br/>
behaviour can sometimes be found unacceptable by people. Sometimes <br/>
her behaviour can be exceptional in people&#39;s eyes and they wow about <br/>
her, but are then stunned when she has a no coping time.<br/>
<br/>
 She has difficulties with some social and other situations and <br/>
other people do not understand (or want to undertand) that she has <br/>
the unacceptable behaviour at that time because she can&#39;t cope or is <br/>
very stressed.  She acts out when under stress. I am loath to put a <br/>
diagnostic label on my child but I do know what it is, she is <br/>
Dyspraxic.<br/>
<br/>
My child is not acceptable to some people. She is not compliant, she <br/>
is not always polite, she can be very volatile. Some people think if <br/>
I sent her to school she would somehow miraculously become &#39;normal&#39;. <br/>
They are so far from the truth they are out of our atmosphere. She <br/>
was quite violent as a toddler and up to about age 6. People do not <br/>
see how far she has come they only see her &#39;bad&#39; behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
If she had been in school (they start at 4/5 locally) she would have <br/>
been labelled with a behaviour disorder and called disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
She is also highly intelligent but struggles with some ordinary <br/>
things like hair brushing. People do not understand (again they <br/>
don&#39;t want to) that these kinds of things are very difficult for <br/>
her. The asumption is always it is because she is not at school, <br/>
bizarre idea I know but that&#39;s what people think :S<br/>
<br/>
I am mostly OK with this. I&#39;ve been a home educator for over 12 <br/>
years and other people&#39;s disapproval is something I&#39;m used to. I <br/>
don&#39;t however have a come back for these people.<br/>
<br/>
 My child is seen as the unacceptable side of home education, by <br/>
home educators not just school people, when in fact home education <br/>
has allowed her to lead a fairly normal life without being labelled <br/>
or put in to some kind of special group. Because her difficulties <br/>
are not obvious then any problems she has are put down to <br/>
unschooling. It is flipping annoying to tell the truth.<br/>

If I had known that my question was gonna solicit such wildly <br/>
hysterical responses I would have prepared myself.<br/>
1. a box of tissues to dry the tears of laughter<br/>
2. tylenol - geez my cheeks hurt from smiling and laughing<br/>
3. a friend who could relate to laugh with me.<br/>

Sandra has suggested &quot;We&#39;re going to try this for awhile.&quot; <br/>
You could add, if they persist.  &quot;I know we have a lot of options if we<br/>
decide to try something else.&quot;<br/>

It&#39;s hard, but as your kids get older there&#39;ll be fewer comments.   A<br/>
liberating moment for me was when I realized I didn&#39;t owe anyone an<br/>
explanation.  I could just smile and say, &quot;We like things the way they<br/>

All of the people who know us, all of them, were skeptical at first.  <br/>
None of them bother us about it now.  Some still believe it&#39;s a fluke<br/>
that Dylan has turned out ok so far, &lt;g&gt; but no one wonders what or<br/>

 </span></blockquote>{{{HUGS}}}  I think the first thing I thought when you wrote this <br/>
was what I had written.  The comment from the one person was a <br/>
quote, but I get many on how well behaved my kids are.  Well it is <br/>
not that they are not well behaved now, but alot of the reason my <br/>
children &quot;were&quot; so well behaved is because we lived an almost cult-<br/>
like Christian lifestyle.(whole &#39;nother topic)  My children weren&#39;t <br/>
allowed to misbehave (ever)which meant...<br/>
1. never having an opinion that didn&#39;t match ours (dh and I)<br/>
2. never had a choice or other option other than what we dictated to <br/>
them.<br/>
3. not having an opinion or a choice means being quiet and agreeable <br/>
for the most part.<br/>
4. My children were so sheltered that they had no idea what <br/>
rebelling even was (or at least the younger ones)<br/>
5. The sad and sorry list goes on and on...<br/>
<br/>
I know your situation is different but for my family having perfect <br/>
and obedient children came at a great price to those children.  One <br/>
that I will spend the remainder of my days trying to mend and erase <br/>
from their memories.<br/>
<br/>
Now my kids are amazing when they are good and equally as amazing <br/>
when they are naughty(antagonizing each other).  They voice their <br/>
opinion now and we struggle through and remind ourselves when they <br/>
are hard to deal with that it is because of what we did to them. <br/>
(not your case I am sure, but it is mine).<br/>
<br/>
We have really great runs where for a couple weeks their behavior <br/>
and actions are mild and wonderful to live with and then we will <br/>
have (like last week) a couple days in a row where it is very <br/>
frustrating.  My dh wanted to throw in the towel due to this last <br/>
week, but I reminded him that you can&#39;t turn around a lifetime of <br/>
mistakes, and expect to have no bumps in the road, overnight.  <br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem is helping them to find an acceptable way to <br/>
express anger and frustration. A way that isn&#39;t hurtful or harmful <br/>
to other members of the family.  This is not easy cause my kids have <br/>
never been allowed to express themselves.  It&#39;s like starting from <br/>
the beginning, only with a new baby they don&#39;t have the years of <br/>
oppression to hamper thier learning.<br/>

experience probably comes from what they see everyday and their own <br/>
idea of normal.  Which actually their idea of normal may very well <br/>
be based on what I see as the current trend of how terribly kids <br/>
treat each other.  I hope that made sense &lt;G&gt;<br/>

They don&#39;t need to see how far she&#39;s come; just you do.   If her behavior&#39;s <br/>
not good for some situations, she just needs to not be in those situations.   <br/>
That&#39;s true of everybody, for all their lives, not just childhood.   There are <br/>
places I really don&#39;t need to be because I wouldn&#39;t behave well.   I need to <br/>
stay far away from parent-teacher-organizations and rallies for fundraising for <br/>
education.   I need to not work in a bank.   I need to not play organized <br/>
sports; I can hardly even watch.    Luckily, none of those things is required.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Keith and I have had a side hobby for years of noticing, when someone is on <br/>
the news for some bizarre behavior or a crime, what they choose to tell about <br/>
the person.   They won&#39;t say &quot;John Brown, a Catholic, was charged with murder <br/>
today.&quot;   New Mexico is FULL of Catholics.   But if he were a member of some <br/>
very minority group, that might be mentioned even if it had absolutely NOTHING <br/>
to do with why they were talking about him on TV.    Or even without the <br/>
fifteen-word summary, in newspaper or magazine articles when they profile the person <br/>
they WILL mention notably rare traits, but not the common ones.   That&#39;s <br/>
natural, I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799017718">Thanks Pam<br/>
           and everyone else who responded, and gave me things to <br/>
think about, much appreciated. I have that book Caged In Chaos, it&#39;s <br/>
a very good book. Must admit I thought the same thing as you...she&#39;d <br/>
have been much better off not being at school. <br/>
<br/>
I identified with the writer up to a point as I also went to <br/>
boarding school and dd&#39;s dyspraxia did not come out of thin air. I <br/>
like the book as I have found it has lots of useful practical tips <br/>
for getting by in everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
Dd is only just learning to understand her own body. She is just <br/>
starting to differentiate being tired from being ill. Up until the <br/>
last month or so when she was tired (including that just waking up <br/>
feeling) she was always convinced that she was ill and had some <br/>
disease. She&#39;s just started noticing the feeling of being tired and <br/>
how it makes her feel in her body and emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
She can&#39;t yet tell for herself situations where she is going to melt <br/>
down. I can tell but she often wants to go to things that will <br/>
affect her negatively. It&#39;s a hard balance to find. We talk a lot <br/>
about potential situations happening so I can try and give her tips <br/>
to manage.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s highly intelligent, very verbaly confident with a rich <br/>
vocabulary. It throws people for a loop that she finds some every <br/>
day things hard. They just don&#39;t get it. I guess it&#39;s the habit of <br/>
trying to fit people in to little boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is an absolute blessing for our family. Atm she&#39;s in the <br/>
kitchen with my partner as they&#39;re making ginger biscuits :)<br/>

&gt; trying to fit people in to little boxes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep. My middle child - she&#39;s 18 now and suddenly seems very capable -  <br/>
but I remember when, at 13 or 14, I realized she couldn&#39;t use a can  <br/>
opener. There were always things she had trouble with - that seemed  <br/>
very out of line with her intellect and even with her own  <br/>
introspective abilities.  She told me the other day that she still  <br/>
has trouble picking up social clues from people. Her example is that  <br/>
she&#39;s hanging around the college theater where she does shows, with a  <br/>
group of other people, and some are talking about going out to eat.  <br/>
She never used to know if she was &quot;invited&quot; or not. It would be one  <br/>
of those things where everybody was arranging rides and stuff, and  <br/>
unless someone looked right at HER and asked, &quot;Do you want to ride  <br/>
with me?&quot; she&#39;d think she shouldn&#39;t go.  Now she gets it that  <br/>
everybody is &#39;invited&quot; - that it is just a group thing and she can  <br/>
just ask somebody, &quot;Do you have room for me to ride with you?&quot; But  <br/>
she said, a couple of days ago, that she&#39;s starting to realize how  <br/>
much social stuff just went over her head, in the past, and she  <br/>
thinks it still does. &quot;I&quot; think that her interpersonal intelligence  <br/>
is developing and she&#39;s becoming more aware and competent - so at the  <br/>
same time that she&#39;s actually MORE competent, she&#39;s more aware of her  <br/>
incompetence. She&#39;d definitely happier, though, and enjoying  <br/>
observing other people and thinking about how they interact with each  <br/>
other and what it all means. Seems to me most girls, at least, do a  <br/>
lot of this in their young teens, but my daughter didn&#39;t seem to have  <br/>
an eye for it at all.<br/>
<br/>
Her &quot;intelligences&quot; have been extreme and very uneven since she was  <br/>
very very little - I think she&#39;s a kid whose brain develops that way  <br/>
- huge big massive development in certain areas - she read fluently  <br/>
at three years old and was reading adult-level literature at five,  <br/>
for example. Socially, she had a lot of trouble - never was good at  <br/>
reading other people.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - my point is that she certainly never fit into any box and it  <br/>
was amazing how many people blamed her for that and blamed ME for  <br/>
trying to make her life a bit easier (at the same time that I was, of  <br/>
COURSE, supporting her learning to handle herself better, especially  <br/>
in groups).<br/>

&gt; Unschooling is an absolute blessing for our family. Atm she&#39;s in the<br/>
&gt; kitchen with my partner as they&#39;re making ginger biscuits :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yum. Hot out-of-the-oven ginger cookies - crisp or chewy? Sounds  <br/>
WONDERFUL. I&#39;m going to make some too. And have them with tea.<br/>

&gt;  When Dylan was younger we&#39;d get this kind of thing too. <br/>
&gt;  I used to have this fantasy.  In my fantasy I&#39;d have little cards <br/>

&gt;  &quot;You would not believe how little I care what you think.&quot; <br/>

One of my fantasies:<br/>

Jerk offers unsolicited advice. I say, &quot;Oh, did I ask for your advice?&quot; <br/>
They admit I did not. I say, &quot;Well, then, I must not have wanted it.&quot;<br/>

There&#39;s a great family-joke line we&#39;ve been using for years. It&#39;s from <br/>
the seventh season of Deep Space Nine when a subordinate fawningly <br/>
tells the head Founder (leader of the evil empire), &quot;That&#39;s an <br/>
excellent idea!&quot; She replies icily, &quot;Your opinion was not solicited.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Miss Manners recommends saying, &quot;Hmm, what an interesting notion,&quot; and <br/>
just moving on from there.<br/>

Very honest, just not at ease with responsibility to other people for <br/>
numerical stuff.<br/>
