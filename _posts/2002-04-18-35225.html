<div id="ygrps-yiv-479456189">We love the Osbournes!!! We&#39;ve watched it right from the beginning and find<br/>
it humorous and entertaining. We (dh & I) like rock music and although we<br/>
don&#39;t own an Ozzie album (dh liked Black Sabbath in his younger years), we<br/>
are familiar with his music and it is so funny to see how he is getting<br/>
along these days in his &quot;older&quot; age, especially interacting with his family.<br/>
Such an off-the-wall yet also normal kind-of family with arguements and<br/>
disagreements, but I also see the love they share (in between all the<br/>
bleeps! :-D)<br/>
Some of TV&#39;s finest - 2002 style. (I understand this is purely subjective!)<br/>
