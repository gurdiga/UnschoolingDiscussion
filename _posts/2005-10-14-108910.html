<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597949992">I called a friend today who had turned me away several months ago. <br/>
Her way of putting distance between herself and people she loved.  Her<br/>
husband answered the phone and said she committed suicide, has been<br/>
gone for a month.  He said she got clinical help but it didn&#39;t take.  <br/>
<br/>
She is one of the closest friends I&#39;ve ever had, an unforgetable voice<br/>
and a beautiful laugh, she wrote wonderful songs and sang so... <br/>
anyway.  Too much pain I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Not to be maudlin but just to say, here was one who was abused by both<br/>
parents cruelly in childhood and adulthood.  They were abused too, and<br/>
no telling how many countless generations that goes back.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know for sure if they caused her depression but I would say so.  <br/>
<br/>
She accused me of having a savior complex.  :)  Well I would have<br/>
loved to have saved Dawn.  It was never spoken between us that she<br/>
would do this last thing, but I knew she might.  Her husband who is<br/>
just a marvel himself is raising their son and daughter (3 and 1 year<br/>
old.  He said she kept saying all the time.. and I&#39;ve heard her say it<br/>
many times ...she should be happy but she just can&#39;t.</div>

Oh, that&#39;s horrible.  I&#39;m so sorry for your friend&#39;s family, and for  you, <br/>
for that helpless feeling.<br/>
