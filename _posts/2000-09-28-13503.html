<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920945047">I just want to say I am not a bigot.  If so I would be bigotted against my own family.  My Aunt is gay and I love her very much.  My daughter is Philliapine, my granddaughter is black/philliapine.  I am american indian/sweedish/unknown.  So I am not bigot.  <br/>
<br/>
I do support the Scouts.  They choose to teach a group of ideas.  They stand and fight for those ideas.  I support them in their choice.<br/>
<br/>
I support your choice to disagree with them that is the beauty of this country. you don&#39;t have to agree with people to support them and their differences.<br/>
<br/>
The government gives money to start companies, go to school, or do any number of individual things.  So why cant they let this organization use govrnment land/buildings/ect..?<br/>
<br/>
And to the question about the other unrepented &#39;sins&#39; of the leaders...if the dont reject them because of this, they should for the same reason they chose not to include gays.<br/>

&gt; This is correct.  Girl Scouts have NEVER accepted &quot;extreme&quot; (what the GS&#39;s<br/>
&gt; use to call them) women as leaders.  The only difference being, that no<br/>
one<br/>

<br/>
Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts are and have always been separate  organizations;<br/>
not branches of the generic &quot;scout&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Actually,  the BIG  difference is not lawsuits but that the GSA does NOT<br/>
have a national policy  stating that endorsing or practicing or tolerating<br/>
homosexual persons or activities is a singular reason to either prohibit<br/>
joining or to be removed from either membership or leadership.     Actual<br/>
practice within local neighborhoods or councils may vary  both historically<br/>
and geographically but the national organization does not insist  that<br/>
discrimination (based on religion, race, culture, OR  sexual orientation) is<br/>
proper.<br/>
<br/>
Vicki---no longer a registered Girl Scout but was extremely involved<br/>
starting in 1957 and continuing as an adult scout and leader for several<br/>
years  including more than one of the &quot;reorganizations&quot;   (Did you know that<br/>
Cadettes and Daisies did not always exist?) </span></blockquote></div>

Lynda, i am a feminist, and like what you have said here.  I guess the point <br/>
for some of these litigating parents is that girl scouts might not be &quot;tough&quot; <br/>
enough or &quot;real enough&quot; for their girls? (same thing as wanting girls to play <br/>
with trucks but not to encourage boys to play with dolls---joining up with <br/>
the masculine is always seen as the most important option). They want them to <br/>
be accepted in the &#39;big league&#39;.  I agree that our litigious society is very <br/>
troublesome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541747432">Well, Girl Scouts camp, hike, raft, learn to build fires, tie knots, so I&#39;m<br/>
thinking it is usually the parents, not the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Being female has never stopped me from doing anything but I never felt I<br/>
had to bust into a men&#39;s club to do it.  I own a Harley, drive a truck<br/>
(307, 350 horse, hotrod type &lt;g&gt;), owned my own businesses and hauled<br/>
horses long haul.  My oldest little sister drives long haul, Class A.  My<br/>
second to youngest little sister shows cars and races cars.  Legislation<br/>
didn&#39;t do this for us nor did sueing so we could belong to the boy&#39;s clubs.<br/>
<br/>
It is how you are raised and whether or not you are raised to give a dead<br/>
rat&#39;s patooty about perceived barriers.  Of course, having liberated males<br/>
in the family before ERA was even thought of might have helped.  Grampa (bd<br/>
1866) was a real role model for all of us and he taught all us girls to<br/>
hammer a nail and saw a board when we were still in ruffled bloomers.  All<br/>
the boys know how to cook (youngest son loves to pick recipes out of<br/>
Vincent Price&#39;s cookbook to experiment with) and all the girls know how to<br/>
fix anything around the house.<br/>
<br/>
So, to wind do this long winded rant, the problem and cure are both in the<br/>
home, not in sueing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, I for one am surrounded by men, what with husband and two sons.  Even my cats are male!  If we got any more testosterone in this house I might run screaming into the street.  But I do encourage my boys to express their gentleness, loving, affection, tenderness, sadness, and other things not encouraged in boys in western culture.  My boys DO play with dolls.  <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, although they do not go to day care or have any macho friends, they really do not pay all that much attention to their dolls.  Once in a while they like to play with them, but everyday they love to play &quot;Cars&quot; and &quot;Knights.&quot;  My eldest does not even really know the difference between mommies and daddies and shows no preference for playing &quot;daddies and babies&quot; over &quot;mommies and babies&quot; with his little animal toys, which he plays with about every day.<br/>
