We&#39;ve got to give kids independent time right away because that is the key <br/>
to self-knowledge, and we must re-involve them with the real world as fast <br/>
as possible so that the independent time can be spent on something other <br/>
than more abstraction. This is an emergency, it requires drastic action to <br/>
correct - our children are dying like flies in schooling, good schooling or <br/>
bad schooling, it&#39;s all the same. Irrelevant.</div>

Welcome to the list and the wonderful world of homeschooling! I&#39;m Amy<br/>

collection of the best articles in the first edition in 1985, and <br/>
then added more in the second revised edition in 1994, but the book <br/>
is now out of print. Many libraries still have copies, however - it <br/>
was the first homeschooling book to reach the Library Top Ten List!<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re thinking of Jean Reed&#39;s revision of &quot;The Home School <br/>
Source Book,&quot; from Brook Farm Books, David. We received that <br/>
well-worn volume today with an Olympia postmark and I thought to <br/>
myself &quot;Hmmm... I know where *this* galley&#39;s been...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is terrific, isn&#39;t it? Lillian reviews it for our Sept/Oct issue!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re still gonna get a lot of that!  (contradictions, I mean)<br/>
<br/>
Essentially (IMO) homeschool is any activity that is education at home rather <br/>
than a traditional school.  Well, that isn&#39;t good either.  How about <br/>
education directed by the parents/guardians/family and based from home...?  <br/>
Unschooled is less structure.  For some it means no structure and strictly <br/>
child-led.  <br/>
<br/>
I avoid grade labeling.  At first it was difficult for ds to know how to <br/>
answer when someone asked what grade he was in; he felt like he somehow <br/>
didn&#39;t belong because he didn&#39;t have a label like everyone else he knew.  So, <br/>
I took opportunities to point out to him when he had just learned something <br/>
and say something like &#39;Look!  You just counted the correct change to the <br/>
clerk.  That counts as our math lesson for the day.&#39;  A few examples and he <br/>
started feeling more confident that he was getting enough &#39;school&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Now when someone asks what grade he&#39;s in, he simply responds that we <br/>
homeschool and don&#39;t use grade categories!<br/>
<br/>
He will be 12 in October.  He has never been to ps.  We have at times tried a <br/>
more structured approach, but always fall off the wagon.  I finally gave <br/>
myself permission to decide that our homeschool style was unstructured and <br/>
we&#39;ve done great every since!  At first I got real nervous about the &#39;what if <br/>
we miss something&#39; dilemma.  But, as time has gone on I see how silly I was <br/>
to be concerned.  There is no way to STOP ds from learning!  He explores <br/>
things on his own.  When I insist on a time table or set curriculum, I get in <br/>
his way.  <br/>
<br/>
I still use a text for math, but not for any other subjects.  That may change <br/>
in the future, depending on the needs as we go.  Even the math text is used <br/>
very loosely.  We don&#39;t follow the schedule and will do a lot of on again, <br/>
off again work.  It often depends on the weather!  If it&#39;s dreary outside (or <br/>
too hot!) we&#39;ll do more inside things which may include the math text.<br/>
<br/>
As for assessments...I rely on conversations with my child.  I can clearly <br/>
tell he understands use of the English language, for instance (or at least <br/>
our Americanized version!).  He often comes to me with a theory he has come <br/>
up with about xyz which will lead to exploration to discover if he is <br/>
correct.  It truly amazes me what I can learn about my child by just talking <br/>
and sharing with him.<br/>
<br/>
We read a lot aloud and silently.  I have him read to me as well as my <br/>
reading to him.  Family reading time leads to great discussions and lets me <br/>
know how well he is understanding what he reads and the world around him.  <br/>
The questions he asks as we are reading are great clues.  For instance, the <br/>
reading might have the word &#39;racism&#39; in it; he has difficulty pronouncing the <br/>
word, so we sound it out; then he asks what it means and it leads to a <br/>
discussion.  Now, the next time we run into that topic, we&#39;ll have a <br/>
different discussion and I can tell he&#39;s learned from one time to another.<br/>
<br/>
As for nouns, verbs, etc.  As far as I&#39;m concerned an 8 yr old has no need to <br/>
worry about such things.  If he can instinctively put together decent <br/>
sentence structure, who cares whether he knows how many nouns, verbs, <br/>
adverbs, adjectives, etc., were used in the sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Best real life use I&#39;ve ever had for such information was a fill-in-the blank <br/>
story game asking me to list nouns, verbs, etc., which were then put into a <br/>
story line.  Very humorous and lots of fun, but hardly an essential life <br/>
skill.<br/>

  <div style="FONT:10pt arial;">&nbsp;</div>
  <div style="FONT:10pt arial;">Welcome Dianna,</div>
  <div style="FONT:10pt arial;">I&#39;m Amy unschooling mom to 3 girls, 7, 4, and 2. 
  I will attempt to answer your questions, but I think there are a lot of 
  variables in unschooling. Keep in mind this is what works best for my 
  family.</div>
  <div style="FONT:10pt arial;">&nbsp;</div>
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am a little confused about homeschool vs. 
  unschool.</div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div>I think the biggest difference is that the learning is child led vs. 
  parent led. I do not assign any work to my kids. I do however, have workboks 
  and texts available to them anytime they want. Some unschoolers I know do not 
  have any such materials in their homes at all.<br></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. How do you know if your kids are 
  learning all the basics.</font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nouns, 
  verbs, etc.?</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">A lot of this is simply a matter of trusting the 
  proccess of natural learning. I have a little one around the house, so it&#39;s 
  easy for me to be reminded of this. I watch the leaps and bounds that she 
  grows and learns by everyday and so much of it is natural. I did not teach her 
  how to walk, yet she does. I did not teach her how to talk, yet her vocabulary 
  grows everyday. I have to trust that the older ones are learning in this 
  manner also. for some added reassurance you could also check out the core 
  knowledge series. &quot;What your x grader needs to know&quot;</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Do you say you are in a 
  certain grade?</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">We do, simply because I find it easier when we&#39;re 
  out and about. A lot of things, like scouts and sports go by grade level. We 
  do not do this at home however. MY oldest dd would be entering gr. 2 this 
  fall, but a lot of her reading skills are only 1st grade level and a lot of 
  her math is 3rd or 4th grade level.</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Do you 
  use any type of worktext items at all?</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">I guess I answered this under # 1.</font></div>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hope this helps :)</font></div>

<br/>
3.  I have a friend who&#39;s kids sincerely love workbooks, so they use them.  <br/>
My son really dislikes them, so we don&#39;t use them.<br/>
<br/>
2.  I find it social convenient to be able to answer the grade question, so <br/>
if it came up, I would say, &quot;He&#39;s a 1st grader.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
1.  I define basics pretty narrowly right now.  To me the basics are reading <br/>
and computing, at this age.  I can see my son progressing in what he reads <br/>
(road signs and comic strips, was nothing 2 months ago) and the complexity of <br/>
the math questions he asks me (&quot;what&#39;s a billion plus 2&quot;).  He&#39;s been exposed <br/>
to the terms &quot;noun&quot;, &quot;verb&quot; and &quot;adjective&quot; from MadLibs, but doesn&#39;t deeply <br/>
grasp them yet.  I&#39;m confident that he&#39;ll understand it more easily when his <br/>
brain is more mature.<br/>
