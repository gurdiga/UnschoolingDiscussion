<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779371560">Hi! I think if people don&#39;t vaccinate they have to understand the importance <br/>
of diet. We are vegans and don&#39;t vaccinate. We also practice extended <br/>
nursing. None of my 4 children have ever had to be on antibiotics or had an <br/>
ear infection. The oldest is 11. You really are what you eat! Eat things to <br/>
build your immune system. I am not saying this is easy in our culture <br/>
because we struggle with cravings all the time. But, I know from experience <br/>
it works!<br/>
