<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145649309">Gee, I google everything nearly, I never thought to google that. We sit here not making easy bake oven treats a lot, because we are out of stuff and they are so expensive. Thanks for the tip, I will definitely do it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952161106">Besides using the recipes on the web, you can also buy cheap boxed cake or<br/>
cookie mixes and let them use them a little at a time.  Look for the ones<br/>
that just need water and oil.  Sometimes we break an egg and keep it in a<br/>
bowl in the fridge and use a spoonful of it as needed too.  It&#39;s pretty<br/>
cheap and easy that way.<br/>
