<div id="ygrps-yiv-211111032">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been trying to eat a variety of foods.  We started doing research<br/>
on the food pyramid and made our own food pyramid and put it on the<br/>
refrigerator for my son and I.  We also had labels with magnets on with<br/>
the various categories.  The goal was to make sure you had the right<br/>
amount of food from each category.  It was a great way to keep track of<br/>
our food and really got us thinking about our diet.  We kept up with it<br/>
for a while and my son&#39;s pyramid is still on the fridge.  My son is now<br/>
six years old.  One of the funny things was you are only to get one<br/>
sweet a day and he started changing the number one to a higher number<br/>
until now he says he&#39;s up to 7 sweets a day.  He doesn&#39;t get that many<br/>
sweets a day by the way.<br/>
