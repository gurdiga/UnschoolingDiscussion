<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000780306">Hi, all!  I&#39;ve enjoyed lurking these past couple weeks and am <br/>
already learning a lot.  We are a young unschooling family in <br/>
western Colorado.  We have three beautiful children--Marian (4), Leo <br/>
(2), and Sophie (5 months).  There are a lot of homeschoolers in my <br/>
town but all of them are in a local government-funded program where <br/>
they are given $2000 a year to spend on their child&#39;s education in <br/>
exchange for meeting with their &quot;resource counselors&quot; and setting <br/>
and following established goals and requirements.  I&#39;m uncomfortable <br/>
with this, and around here it seems that if you&#39;re not in the <br/>
program, you&#39;re &quot;out&quot;...Out of the loop, out of the group.  :(  I&#39;ve <br/>
not given up on my search for local kindred spirits, but I am <br/>
welcoming the support I anticipate finding here.  I look forward to <br/>
getting to know you all.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755204658">Pleased to meet you! Hope you&#39;re able to find some homeschoolers soon.<br/>
<br/>
According to my reading of your note, there are very few homeschoolers <br/>
in your town, and everyone you&#39;ve contacted has their kids in public <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to note that public school is public school, regardless <br/>
of what building it&#39;s in. Homeschooling families make their own <br/>
decisions about curriculum and individual classes.<br/>
