<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689707505">****Personally I never wanted my child to be fearful<br/>
so I never mentioned <br/>
any<br/>
of the &quot;stranger danger&quot; or &quot;good touch, bad touch&quot;<br/>
stuff.  I simply <br/>
made<br/>
sure it was not a possibility.  It was worth it to<br/>
protect that <br/>
careless<br/>
joy that only seems possible in childhood.***<br/>
<br/>
My mother felt the same way. I wish she hadnt, because<br/>
from the time I was 7 until I was 12, my &quot;closest&quot;<br/>
uncle was molesting me and filling my head with &quot;its<br/>
our secret&quot; and &quot;your parents would be so mad at you&quot;.<br/>
I kept my secret until I was a very screwed up 16 year<br/>
old, sexually promiscuous and in danger of killing<br/>
myself with drugs and alcohol.<br/>
ANYTHING can happen to ANYONE, and by not giving your<br/>
kids the tools to deal with things that MIGHT happen,<br/>
you&#39;re leaving a very inportant life lesson out. I&#39;m<br/>
not trying to insult anyone, I just want to give you a<br/>
child&#39;s point of veiw. I was that child, and had I<br/>
been talked to about those things, I may have been<br/>
able to prevent it from ever happening.<br/>

Kerry&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is why I specifically said that I made sure it couldn&#39;t happen and I<br/>
meant exactly that.  I didn&#39;t trust anyone that I didn&#39;t know INTIMATELY.<br/>
 This meant I knew a total of THREE people I would trust my children<br/>
alone with.  I have many friends who were molested, including my best<br/>
friend who&#39;s situation sounds similar to your&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
My children were never left alone with anyone and in those times when<br/>
people came to visit and stayed over, the children slept with me.  They<br/>
didn&#39;t spend the night at friend&#39;s homes until they were old enough to<br/>
handle the information.  We had a couple of proven family members who we<br/>
would have turned to in an emergency.<br/>
<br/>
You see, I also have a couple of friends who were coached about &quot;good<br/>
touch, bad touch&quot; and were STILL molested.  They STILL believed that the<br/>
monster would follow through on their threats.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that many children are not capable of dealing with the<br/>
situation even with being taught.  It takes a LOT to deal with and adult<br/>
in this manner and I decided that it wasn&#39;t worth robbing my children of<br/>
their innocence and then trust that THAT was enough to protect them.<br/>
<br/>
I preferred that they enjoy that innocence to the maximum and disable the<br/>
possility.<br/>

<div><font size="4">I have known too may people, including myself who have gone 
through similar situations. We teach our children if they feel uncomfortable 
about any kind of touching,&nbsp;they can say no it is their body, and they can 
to talk to us.&nbsp; Private means private. All things in balance though. The 
Berenstain bears have a video tape that explains this concept of strangers 
well.&nbsp; It is on the Messy Room videotape. The other concern Kerry brings up 
here is just as&nbsp;important, though. Our children need to trust their inner 
feelings. and know their bodies are theirs, not mine or anyone elses. I&#39;m sure 
she felt uncomfortable about what was happening, but felt no control in the 
situation.&nbsp;</font></div>
