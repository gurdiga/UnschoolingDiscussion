My dd is 12yrs old.  We have only been h/s unschooling for 8 months <br/>
and like your son, she is very unmotivated.  She is very anti <br/>
anything that smells of school.  And like you I was getting very <br/>
frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Here in New Zealand it is the ps hols - so I havent bothered too much <br/>
about school - not that we do school any more at any time - Anyway, <br/>
my dd has read several books from the library - she very rarely reads <br/>
books - made a cake - wrote a story - made up a dance - explored the <br/>
rock pools - learned that bats fly by sonar - played shops with a <br/>
friend - we have played the Game of Knowledge - and she has been <br/>
swimming. Just to mention a few.<br/>
<br/>
This is a child who during *school term* lays in bed half the day.....<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who will climb into bed with her son when she isn&#39;t <br/>
talking to her husband, and he is 18yrs old!!!!!<br/>
I think it is pretty cool that yoou have such a close relationship <br/>
with your son.<br/>
My dd used to climb in bed with me almost every night when my husband <br/>
worked away.<br/>
