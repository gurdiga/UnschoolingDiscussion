<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027755964">&lt;&lt;Why is it the rats I have seen and held tend to be mean and bite when<br/>
held? <br/>
Can rats be trained to use litter boxes or are they like hamsters in that<br/>
<br/>
respect that they go  in a corner but basically all over the cage. How<br/>
are <br/>
they on smell, hamster cages stink! TIA, Lynn F&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Like someone already said you have probably been seeing pet store rats<br/>
and/or rats that aren&#39;t played with enough.<br/>
<br/>
Rats can be litter trained by from what I&#39;ve read it&#39;s more a case of<br/>
encouraging a natural tendency.  Some rats are more likely to be<br/>
selective in where they go potty than others.<br/>
<br/>
Our rats don&#39;t smell bad as long as we clean their cage AT LEAST once a<br/>
week.  We use aspen bedding, it still helps with odor but doesn&#39;t have<br/>
the nasty oils in pine and cedar.  We tried the recycled newspaper<br/>
bedding once but it was awful, it almost smelled like a dirty cage new in<br/>
the bag.<br/>
<br/>
One good breeder uses alfalfa pellets, she says that since her ratties<br/>
always use the same corner to pee she just scoops up the pellets that<br/>
have disintegrated from being wet every day.  Then she dumps the whole<br/>
cage of litter every week, I&#39;m going to try this next time.<br/>
<br/>
We also give our girls a bath about once a month.  We put them in a deep<br/>
rubbermaid storage bucket with just a couple inches of warm water and bit<br/>
of mild soap, this way they can still touch bottom.  It&#39;s not their<br/>
favorite activity but they don&#39;t seem to suffer from PTSD either.  We<br/>
just rub them a bit (especially their tails) and then rinse them off with<br/>
warm water.  We all hold one of them, rub it dry and then put them back<br/>
in their clean cage where they fluff and dry themselves the rest of the<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of our would take his ratties into the shower with them, they<br/>
seemed to love that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My ratties always loved to swim. In the summer I would put a plastic wadding <br/>
pool out with about an inch or so of water in it and put things in the pool <br/>
so they could get out of the water and sun too. I did have one that hated <br/>
water, but for the most part I think rats like to swim.<br/>
