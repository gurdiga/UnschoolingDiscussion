<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542501229">Hi listmates-<br/>
I have always encouraged my children to draw and draw and draw and draw . .<br/>
. we keep the ones we really love - and those that might be considered<br/>
&quot;waste&quot; - we cut into fourths and use as scrap notepads, clipped together<br/>
as a pad . .  .or we use the back side and write letters on them . . . or,<br/>
we put them in the scrap paper recycling bin and bless their passage into<br/>
something else. . . but I could never assume for a moment that it was<br/>
wasting to see them creating in such joy.<br/>
In aloha, Lee<br/>

people throw away. Hospitals are another major waster of paper (not medical <br/>
waste). These might be some resources for you.<br/>

&quot;regulation&quot; size or shape.  The different shapes can sometimes inspire <br/>
creativity, but most of them look like regular paper.<br/>
