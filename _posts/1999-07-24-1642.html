&lt;&lt; We read &#39;Sarah... &#39;  last year but I couldn&#39;t get my daughters very<br/>
 interested in the lesson activities. Hence, we are unschooling. I realized<br/>
 that , for right now, they are not into these pre-packaged learning<br/>
 experiences.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We consider what we are doing with B5IAR as unschooling.  The activites are <br/>
done informally,and we don&#39;t do what they don&#39;t want to do.   We don&#39;t follow <br/>
the guide strictly (thus we would be schooling then) and we do it when we <br/>
feel energized and want to take something on.  The boys have been very <br/>
positive and interested in this Thomas Edison unit.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
unschooling has to mean using nothing and hoping like heck your kids can find <br/>
the answers to their questions.  I for one am not always stimulating and <br/>
spontaneous and I find I need help now and again to show the boys some really <br/>
cool things that just shouldn&#39;t be passed up or looked past.  I do believe in <br/>
stimulating the mind and trying new experiences.  Stopping the children so <br/>
they can look at things they otherwise may have looked straight past.  And <br/>
having a child who in the past sufferend from ADHD, it has indeed been <br/>
crucial for us to provide a stimulating environment.  And I know they would <br/>
never want to read Sarah, Plain and Tall, hahaha! <br/>
<br/>
Like I said, a great deal of this can be done as dinner conversations or <br/>
&quot;let&#39;s try this see what happens&quot; type of stuff.  I will blurt out a few <br/>
points in the car, and we will discuss it far as we like.   And my guys <br/>
wanted to do this.<br/>
<br/>
Even though we are unschooling also, i use B5IAR to increase my knowledge <br/>
base and my creativity and they are learning how to dive into things a little <br/>
more deeply.  they are asking more questions about why things are they way <br/>
they are and how things work.. This unit along with other things we are doing <br/>
has stimulated something in them that was lying formant for sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Since they previously were in a public school situation... they had to find <br/>
out that learning can actually be fun and things you thought you would hate <br/>
may be interesting after all.  I have heard them time and again say that <br/>
never would have thought some of the things we do are fun, but much to their <br/>
surprise and my delight, they are enjoying a variety of things.  But it <br/>
doesn&#39;t appear that they would not have picked these things up or asked to do <br/>
them...because they think &quot;learning things&#39; in general suck.  So, Mom is <br/>
doing a bit of stimulation for now and it is paying off big time.  I am <br/>
exposing them to things they otherwise would have passed up.<br/>
<br/>
Oh my goodness, i do believe their minds are opening and they are becoming <br/>
more willing to learn and experience things outside of their previously <br/>
comfortable box.  So B5IAR is benefitting us just fine right now...and it <br/>
also expanding my mind, which also needed some prying open :-)  I am getting <br/>
better at answering impromptu questions and finding the answers to questions <br/>
I have.  And before the boys wouldn&#39;t touch books outside of Goosebumps or <br/>
Animorphs without putting up a battle.  Now they see that you can&#39;t judge a <br/>
book by its cover and you might actually enjoy what is written in the pages <br/>
inside.  For this I am extremely thankful... I was a bit worried about it :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690795365">I had bought the five in a row book... and after the question on this loop <br/>
popped it out agasin and decided that since my almost five year old keeps <br/>
asking if we can &quot;do&quot; school that I would try it out when I return from NY <br/>
next week, I went ahead and orderd the beyond 5 in a row fore my older <br/>
daughter becuase she loves the boxcar children books and I thought it might <br/>
be fun to incorporate stuff with that.  I often find taht I ride the fence on <br/>
unschooling and my participation...  in that I don&#39; twant to force stuff down <br/>
their throat (ie holocaust!  :-) per our earlier posts regarding this) but <br/>
havce also noticed that often tijes my 7 year old will say a book is &quot;boring&quot; <br/>
just based on the looks of the cover,  So --  Ibought the five in a row <br/>
boolks.  I think we will pick and choose also and know that they ahve many <br/>
outside interests... She is really &quot;into&#39; getting a hamster right now and has <br/>
been.,  In this house we believce that you don&#39;t just run on out and purchase <br/>
a pet to have unless you reserach etc. making sure the pet is truly wanted <br/>
not just a passing fancy, plus this opens many other areas of interest.  <br/>
Anyway, bottom linje...  I find that I am often in between... but nonetheless <br/>
enjoy being wikth them and wathcing them learn -- regardless how they learn...<br/>
