<div id="ygrps-yiv-855355651">&lt;&lt; How do you know if you have a yeast imbalance?  What are the symptoms <br/>
<br/>
and how do they test for it?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BIG REFEREE&#39;S WHISTLE!<br/>
<br/>
Please change some of the subjects, real life, protein, ads, slings, soon <br/>
please.  Let&#39;s move away from things that could better be discussed on other <br/>
lists and back to particularly unschooling stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Google.com is great for general information.  A list with 1553 members (I&#39;ve <br/>
discounted the two I&#39;m about to ban for attempted spamming) and 444 posts so <br/>
far this month (in seven days) needs to try to stay on topic.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
