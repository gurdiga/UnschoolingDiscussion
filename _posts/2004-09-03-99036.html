<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834135678">The greatest gift I received at the conference was the challenge and <br/>
permission to become a YES parent.  I attended the conference with <br/>
someone who had never heard of unschooling until we met 10 weeks <br/>
ago.  We climb into the car after the conference and he admits, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
really uncomfortable with the whole &#39;just say yes&#39; thing.  How can <br/>
you really raise kids without telling them no; isn&#39;t it the same <br/>
thing as letting them run all over you?&quot; I had to really think about <br/>
that... luckily he was my captive audience for the trip home and I <br/>
would have lots of time to form my answer.  What I realized is that <br/>
it&#39;s not really about saying yes; as if saying yes is the symptom of <br/>
my examination of every no in my book.  I need to look at every <br/>
single knee-jerk no that is about to escape my lips, what is behind <br/>
it? Fear? Distraction? Most of the time, it is one of those two <br/>
things... Do I want to spend my life with my child being afraid?  Do <br/>
I want to spend it being distracted?  Saying yes to my child forces <br/>
me to be present and forces the voices of fear to quiet, even just <br/>
for a moment.  I will say no again, I just know it... but it will <br/>
really mean something because my children will understand it is a <br/>
truly thoughtful response and not just the first one.  <br/>
<br/>
After 4+ more days of vacation after the conference, four+ days of <br/>
Yes practice, I noticed an amazing shift in my children.  They <br/>
became YES kids &lt;bg&gt; The selfishness and knee-jerk screeches were <br/>
diminished... they felt good giving each other the gift of Yes.  <br/>
<br/>
Just for today, say YES!<br/>
<br/>
~diana :)  <br/>
For all that has been, I say THANKS.  <br/>
For all that is to be, I say YES!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96914687">Well, that was what it *feels* like, I should show you what it <br/>
*looks* like :)  <br/>
Pre-conference: Hayden and gas stations and mom&#39;s bad attitude: He <br/>
MUST go in, he MUST look at ALL the candy available, he MUST compare <br/>
the prices to get the best deal, he MUST tell me what everyone he <br/>
knows would buy if they were in the store, this MUST last 15 minutes <br/>
even when we have 3, I must SIGH and roll my eyes and rush him right <br/>
along.  <br/>
Post-conference: Hayden and gas stations and mom&#39;s YES attitude: <br/>
Hayden, come on out, we&#39;re at the gas station, doncha want a treat?  <br/>
&lt;bg&gt; We&#39;ll be sure to tell Lincoln that we thought of him when we saw <br/>
that candy in New York.  At one stop he had only a quarter to spend <br/>
(the atm was out of order, I had NO cash), I tried for 15 minutes to <br/>
convince him [blah, blah, blah, blah at its finest] there was nothing <br/>
in the entire place for 25 cents, not even one machine.  A man walked <br/>
by and said &quot;good luck mommy&quot; and it was enough of a distradtion for <br/>
me to realize exactly what I needed to do, I let Hayden go into the <br/>
store and look around, while I took a deep breath.  I gently <br/>
suggested he ask the clerk what was available for him... the clerk <br/>
sadly said no and we left.  We got in the car, he was disappointed, <br/>
but not in me ~ I got the chance to listen and empathize, be on his <br/>
team. We drove on and fantasized of what we would get at the next <br/>
rest stop with a working atm, what would we get if we won the NY <br/>
Lottery, would it change our vacation plans?  <br/>
<br/>
Diana&#39;s SPAM adventure: As we were totally wiped out overwhelmed and <br/>
200 miles from home on Thursday morning, I said YES to the SPAM <br/>
Museum in Austin, MN.  (yes, that Some Parts Are Meat stuff in the <br/>
blue can, they have a museum) Hayden and David were revved but Hannah <br/>
had just awakened and a museum was not high on her list of wants for <br/>
the day. I stayed in the car with her, I knew David would come out <br/>
and tell us if it was cool and would even take a shift in the car <br/>
with her so I could go in with Hayden.  As soon as it was understood <br/>
that she did indeed receive a YES you can stay in the car and not go <br/>
in, she says, &quot;you&#39;re a YES mom and I want to be a YES daughter so <br/>
let&#39;s go in.&quot;  We had a great time, it is corny and funny, you should <br/>
see us in our SPAM assembly line outfits!  I even went so far as to <br/>
accept a few samples... my lifetime quota has been met, but I&#39;m a <br/>
team player!  <br/>

<br/>
Before I even read the rest of what Diana wrote, I feel compelled to say that <br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone has ever advocated &quot;just say yes,&quot; and I know it might <br/>
be exaggeration for humorous effect, but if anyone reads it without that <br/>
thought. . .<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t say no for arbitrary reasons.<br/>
Don&#39;t say no when the yes won&#39;t hurt anything.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;just say yes&quot; is causing some concern and confusion.  Some people seem <br/>
perhaps to think a blanket &#39;yes&#39; in the morning (&quot;Go forth and do whatever you <br/>
want to do&quot;) is the same as considering each moment&#39;s request and advising <br/>
kids whether it&#39;s a good idea, a good time for whatever it is, a good way to do <br/>
it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ve read the next part of Diana&#39;s report, and I feel much better.  The <br/>
reason I&#39;m still going to post what&#39;s above is because of a couple of <br/>
conversations at the conference.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What I realized is that <br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s not really about saying yes; as if saying yes is the symptom of <br/>
<br/>
my examination of every no in my book.  I need to look at every <br/>
<br/>
single knee-jerk no that is about to escape my lips, what is behind <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
things... Do I want to spend my life with my child being afraid?  Do <br/>
<br/>
I want to spend it being distracted? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Knee-jerk no&#39;s are bad.<br/>
Yes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I will say no again, I just know it... but it will <br/>
<br/>
really mean something because my children will understand it is a <br/>
<br/>
truly thoughtful response and not just the first one.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s true, and my kids will take no.  <br/>
I told Marty just ten minutes ago that he could do something I&#39;m worried <br/>
about.  He said, &quot;You can say no, mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But I&#39;m saying yes because I love you, and because I don&#39;t want you to <br/>
become sneaky and resentful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t know that will happen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But it MIGHT.  And I don&#39;t want it to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We were being very light about the whole thing, joking, but when he said &quot;You <br/>
can say no,&quot; he wasn&#39;t joking.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-After 4+ more days of vacation after the conference, four+ days of <br/>
<br/>
Yes practice, I noticed an amazing shift in my children.  They <br/>
<br/>
became YES kids &lt;bg&gt; The selfishness and knee-jerk screeches were <br/>
<br/>
diminished... they felt good giving each other the gift of Yes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just for today, say YES!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Diana&#39;s children were some of my kids&#39; favorite buddies at the conference. <br/>
<br/>
It was strange, overall, to be around people in so many stages of desire to <br/>
change, and implementation of new ideas.    <br/>
Some kids seemed to be too unsupervised.   <br/>
Some were entirely unsupervised, but it didn&#39;t seem like it (because they <br/>
weren&#39;t standing out as in need of supervision).<br/>
<br/>
Marty told me and Joyce (and Kathryn F. and Holly D.) that of all the kids <br/>
who were there, there were only three or so he wouldn&#39;t have chosen to hang out <br/>
with.  A couple of older boys (I suspect had been to school, and one Marty <br/>
said hadn&#39;t really wanted to attend the conference) did some posturing and Marty <br/>
was unimpressed.<br/>
<br/>
In the real world, that&#39;s not bad stats at all, three out of... how many <br/>
kids?  Nearly 200?<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling conferences are a rarified special corner of the real world, <br/>
and there are people there in decision-making mode (especially, maybe, dads, <br/>
and there were lots of those--65 at the all-dads/only dads meeting), and when <br/>
some perceived that some parents were giving blanket &quot;yes&quot; without judgment, it <br/>
might&#39;ve (did in a case or two) made them nervous.<br/>
<br/>
Yet for every story of questionable behavior, I probably heard three glowing <br/>
reports of generosity, courtesy, older kids helping younger ones, kids hanging <br/>
out with adults without any awkwardness, etc.  So it wasn&#39;t a big problem at <br/>
all.  It was a little twitch some people commented on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954449416">Diana,<br/>
I adore your &#39;yes&#39; story.<br/>
<br/>
When we left you guys at the restaurant Sunday evening Fire wanted ice<br/>
cream.  We said yes to her and said we would stop at the first rest area<br/>
along the way so she could get some.  She fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
When she woke up the next morning in her own bed the first words out of her<br/>
mouth were disappointment that she didn&#39;t get her ice cream.  So i asked her<br/>
if she would like ice cream for breakfast.  Her eyes lit up and she asked<br/>
&quot;can i really?&#39;  &quot;Of course,&quot; i said.  She said she would like ice cream for<br/>
breakfast lunch and dinner and snack as well.  Why not?  What a delightful<br/>
day she had.  Everytime she said she was hungry we had this wonderful<br/>
excitement together when she realized she could have exactly what she<br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
In the evening when my sister called and Fire told her she had eaten ice<br/>
cream all day long, for breakfast, lunch and dinner and even snack, my<br/>
sister asked me what kind of mother i was.  The answer, &quot;the best, most<br/>
wonderful mother in the whole wide world.&quot;  What could she say to that.<br/>
<br/>
In our home, saying Yes is about finding solutions that work for everyone.<br/>
When my kids feel threatened that what they want will not happen they *may*<br/>
become difficult and obstinate and angry human beings - they&#39;ve never had to<br/>
supress their feelings so they&#39;ll let us know what&#39;s on their mind.  Once<br/>
they recognize that we are all finding a way to make what we all want happen<br/>
they become confident creative joyful participants in solving and resolving<br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
I do hope David learns that *he* is entilted to &quot;yes&quot; (or no) without<br/>
feeling guilty that he may be percieved as running over another person.  I<br/>
noticed his frustration when Fire was teasing him.  Instead of directly<br/>
asking her to stop he played sad and coy.  When asked directly if he would<br/>
prefer that she not tease him he was seemed surprised by her responsiveness<br/>
to the sincerity of his request.  I don&#39;t think people are raised to believe<br/>
that having what you want is a simple as asking for it.  I hope my kids<br/>
don&#39;t have to manipulate and play act in order to get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
I am babbling now...my mind is still spinning from all that i witnessed over<br/>
the weekend.  What a great place to be.  We are already talking about next<br/>
year in Pensacola.<br/>
<br/>
See you there.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hayden and gas stations and mom&#39;s YES attitude:  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I want to tell a really nice Joyce Fetteroll story, about a gas station. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We were looking for the Higgins Armory Museum in Worcester on Tuesday after <br/>
the conference.  The Mapquest directions were iffy, and we were a little lost, <br/>
so Joyce stopped at an old-style corner filling station/convenience store to <br/>
ask directions.  Holly wanted candy cigarettes.  She had a pack years ago in <br/>
Minnesota, and we never do find them in Albuquerque.  I had told them how common <br/>
they were when I was a kid.<br/>
<br/>
I bought her two packs.  She shared them around.  She had fun.  She played.  <br/>
She realized she was going to need more.  (We made jokes about her toy <br/>
cigarette addiction, and how she&#39;d need a sugar patch or corn-syrup patch to wean <br/>
herself off of them later.)<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked if she could go back and get more.  <br/>
Joyce willingly (and efficiently) found the filling station, and where Holly <br/>
bought several more packs.  <br/>
That was nice of Joyce to do, along with the other larger nice of cheerfully <br/>
taking us to whatever museum I had thought might be fun (and far away).   We <br/>
saw Hammond Castle and the Peabody Essex on Monday, Higgins Armory and candy <br/>
cigarettes on Tuesday (and a cemetery, but Holly stayed at the house out of fear <br/>
of mosquitos).  Wednesday, my longtime dream museum, the National Plastics <br/>
Museum, which was Holly&#39;s favorite and Marty has talked it up too.  I was pretty <br/>
confident that it would be cool, but was relieved that other people thought <br/>
so too.<br/>
<br/>
So Joyce did a lot of &quot;Sure, okay&quot; kind of &quot;yes&quot; stuff to foreign guests, and <br/>
I really appreciated it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-415780510">When we went to Mexico they sold candy cigarettes at the panaderia (bakery).<br/>
I also remembered them from my childhood.  My kids had a lot of fun with<br/>
them.  We have very few family or friends who smoke.  The few who do know<br/>
that we don&#39;t allow it inside our house.  I&#39;m not worried about the candy<br/>
cigarettes leading to &#39;harder stuff&#39;, but the joke about the corn syrup<br/>

*************************<br/>
<br/>
Oh I&#39;m so glad you broght this up... we discussed it on the way home :)  He<br/>
was so surprised by what happens when you tell kids the truth!  He wants to<br/>
know what you whispered to Fire to get her to stop ~ I suspected an empathy<br/>
statement, like, &quot;YOU sure wouldn&#39;t like it, neither does David&quot; or maybe it<br/>
was just as simple as, &quot;He&#39;s playing silly, but it really hurts his<br/>
feelings&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To fill in the rest of you, David was my co-pilot for the trip (our<br/>
relationship remains undefined) who had never heard of unschooling before we<br/>
met in July and had no idea what he would experience at an unschooling<br/>
conference.  The young girls (6-9ish) thought it was funny to taunt him and<br/>
call him a baby.  He responded quite funnily with his mock-sad faces, though<br/>
he really wanted the girls to stop, he never said so to them directly.  I&#39;m<br/>
not sure what his thoughts were, maybe he expected the mommies to jump in,<br/>
but I was giving him wide berth to put a stop to it on his own terms, to<br/>
speak up about his own needs and as an adult, he didn&#39;t quite know what to<br/>
do... Which is where Lisa stepped in and whispered something (???) to Fire<br/>
and the whole thing stopped and the rest of the night was wonderful! :)<br/>
<br/>
Amazing, just amazing.<br/>
<br/>
~diana :)<br/>
To all that has been, I say THANKS!<br/>
For all that is to be, I say YES!<br/>
