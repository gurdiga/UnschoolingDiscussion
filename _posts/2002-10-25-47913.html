&gt; list.  The volume of posts is remarkable, but few of them have<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So, Tangie, you come here often? :)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, if you&#39;ve only been a member of the list a short time, I can tell<br/>
you that it fluctuates widely (and occasionally wildly :) in topics, but the<br/>
central core is unschooling and it always comes back around.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been here awhile and still think parenting-in-general doesn&#39;t have<br/>
almost everything to do with unschooling, keep reading for a bit longer and<br/>
see if it starts to make sense.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to unschool if your parenting style is like that of many/most<br/>
American families, so we have to address the problems in parenting while<br/>
we&#39;re in the process of talking about unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pam - I&#39;ve been reading the list for quite some time now and I love it!  My <br/>
two oldest daughters went through public school - my son, who is 10, attended <br/>
kindergarten and has been homeschooled since!<br/>
<br/>
How do we as parents, and maybe parents who got into the rut of &quot;school at <br/>
home&quot;, become unschoolers - it seems that major thought process changes are <br/>
needed and I find that I&#39;m having a hard time switching paradigms.  I love <br/>
the idea of unschooling and I feel that it would be an ideal way for us to <br/>
live!<br/>
<br/>
I have a really hard time just &quot;being&quot;....must be all those years &quot;doing&quot; <br/>
public school with my girls.  Suggestions?  Comments?<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling in a nutshell, is good parenting.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think unschooling is anyway?  And I have read many posts about <br/>
how to let go of control, in order to unschool more effectively.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just not the right list for you.<br/>

If you can get to the internet, go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/articles">http://sandradodd.com/articles</a><br/>
and read deschooling and disposable checklists.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a doer. :) Mostly, I&#39;m an over-doer, in fact. Unless I have 27 <br/>
balls in the air, I&#39;m not happy and I&#39;m looking for something to <br/>
add.<br/>
<br/>
What I try not to do is add my daughters to my list of projects that <br/>
I&#39;m directing to my version of a successful completion. When I <br/>
get the urge to foist something on them, or &quot;make&quot; them the way <br/>
I want them to be, I redirect it.<br/>
<br/>
So, I breed show rabbits and show guinea pigs. I train my dog. I <br/>
clean out a closet. I scrapbook. I do all sorts of things that my my <br/>
control freak flag fly if you will &lt;g&gt; and leave my daughters out of <br/>
my Type A machinations.<br/>
<br/>
With them, I try very hard to remember that I want my role to be <br/>
their fan, supporter, confidant, helper. I pay attention to what they <br/>
are doing and try to think of things they might want to do, without <br/>
prejudice if they say &quot;no thanks&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been easy for me, and I don&#39;t know why.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563040473">Hi, Tangie --<br/>
<br/>
I think the point is that unschooling isn&#39;t just something we do for a<br/>
few hours a day to replace school -- it&#39;s our whole lives with our children.<br/>
