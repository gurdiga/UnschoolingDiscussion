<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090843907">In January, a neighbor called to ask if I knew anyone who would like a teddy<br/>
bear hamster.  We had not been looking for a hamster, but my kids talked me<br/>
into taking it.  (They didn&#39;t have to twist my arm too hard.  I think he&#39;s<br/>
pretty cute!)<br/>
<br/>
Although my kids like the hamster, the bottom line is that I do most of the<br/>
hamster care.  10yod feeds him almost every day, but rarely gets him out of<br/>
the cage, and then usually for just a few minutes.  Every once in awhile, I<br/>
suggest that we find him a new home with people who are able to spend more<br/>
time with him.  The kids always insist that they want to keep him.  But the<br/>
poor thing is ignored most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
What do other folks consider when making decisions about getting/keeping<br/>
pets?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to make ultimatums (ie play with him 30 minutes a day or he<br/>
goes!), but we really don&#39;t NEED to have this little guy hanging around and<br/>
not getting the attention he deserves.<br/>

<br/>
I guess it all depends on what you consider to be an ultimatum.  I don&#39;t see <br/>
anything wrong with saying that you don&#39;t want to be fully responsibile for <br/>
the hamster and you are going to need help.  Otherwise, in his best <br/>
interests, you will have to find him a good home.<br/>
<br/>
Now, having said that!  *I* think it is unrealistic for parents to assume <br/>
that young children are capable of providing total care for their pets.  In <br/>
the beginning, they are cute and cuddly and fun to watch and play with.  <br/>
But, over time, they become like anything else...video games, books, <br/>
swingsets....they get old.  Asking a young child to make a life-long <br/>
commitment to an animal is a lot to ask, imo.  Even if that lifetime lasts <br/>
only two years!  My 12 yr old, who is very responsibile, isn&#39;t yet ready to <br/>
make that commitment.  Or, at least, not without a lot of fuss and heal <br/>
dragging.<br/>
<br/>
When we take pets in, I assume that they will be *my* pets and my <br/>
responsibility.  Then, if the kids help out with their care, all the better <br/>
for me!  I allow them freedom in pet care, just as I do in their attainment <br/>
of knowledge.  I can&#39;t imagine forcing a textbook anymore than the care for <br/>
a live animal!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it has to be a cut and dry ultimatum.  Have you thought of <br/>
getting another hamster and some excercise equipment for him?  Do they <br/>
really need to be let out daily?  I don&#39;t know!  We&#39;ve never had a hamster.  <br/>
LOL I know vets recommend getting a playmate (of the canine persuasion) if <br/>
their dog is lonely.  Wouldn&#39;t this also work for your pet?  If not, I would <br/>
discuss the needs of the hamster with the kids and let them know that you <br/>
can&#39;t take full responsibility for it.  I wouldnt&#39; force them or require <br/>
them to take him out everyday but I would let them know that if he isn&#39;t <br/>
getting what he needs that the loving and responsibile thing to do would be <br/>
to find him another home.  Then, I&#39;d give it a few weeks and if nothing <br/>
changed, I&#39;d ask for their help in finding him a new place to live.  Maybe, <br/>
faced with the thought of having to lose him, the thought of spending a <br/>
little more time with him everyday won&#39;t seem such a bad price to pay.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m way off!  I&#39;m interested in hearing what others have to say!<br/>

&lt;&lt;What do other folks consider when making decisions about getting/keeping<br/>
pets?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I think it&#39;s unrealistic to expect that kids will<br/>
take sole responsibility for a pet. I don&#39;t think, no matter how much you<br/>
explain it, they understand the work that really goes in to taking care of<br/>
it. So with that in mind, I would think a parent, before taking on a pet,<br/>
understands that for the most part, when the kids are young, you will be<br/>
taking care of the pet. If that&#39;s fine then go for it. If you don&#39;t want<br/>
that responsibility, then don&#39;t get one. If you get a pet thinking you won&#39;t<br/>
be having to take care of it, and find you are and don&#39;t want to, I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s unreasonable to sit and explain exactly what bothers you about<br/>
having the pet and what needs to be done to keep the pet in the house. Again<br/>
I think it&#39;s unrealistic to expect total pet care from the child. If you can<br/>
come to an agreement, then great. If not I would think it kinder to find the<br/>
pet a better caring home.<br/>
<br/>
I am a pet lover. Always have been. We never had many pets because my mom is<br/>
not an animal lover. The few times we were able to get a dog or cat, even<br/>
then I would not completely take care of the pet. As much as I wanted it and<br/>
loved it, I was a kid and had other things to do.<br/>
<br/>
So now we have 2 dogs, 2 cats, 1 snake, 2 fish tanks with 14 fish and 1 frog<br/>
and 3 hermit crabs. Some fish, 1 cat, 1 dog, the snake and the hermit crabs<br/>
are supposed to be some of the children&#39;s pets.<br/>
<br/>
I feed the dogs most days, always feed the cats, always clean the fish tanks<br/>
and crab tanks. I feed the fish, check the water, feed the crabs, bath one<br/>
dog, cut all the nails and water the snake. My husband cleans the snake cage<br/>
and feeds him. My daughter cleans the litter box. We have the bully taken<br/>
elsewhere to bath. We walk both dogs and I let them out all day plus clean<br/>
puke and whatever they have chewed for the day. The kids play with the dogs<br/>
and cat sometimes. They play with the hermit crabs although not as much as<br/>
when we first got them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really fine with all this as I knew what I would be doing when we got<br/>
them all. I&#39;m actually thinking of getting a turtle and maybe a bunny<br/>
too..........for the kids. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s hard cause he&#39;s in a cage, right?  I would mention that to them, that <br/>
that makes them and you more responsible for his needs.  <br/>
<br/>
Alex sometimes acts towards our cats in a way that I deem disrespectful of <br/>
the animal, picking Serena up, even tho she hates that, stepping way too close <br/>
to one of them laying on the floor, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I just try to give him an idea of how the animal might feel.  Point out the <br/>
cues the animal is giving that something is bothering them.  &quot;I think Serena is <br/>
kicking her back legs because she wants you to put her down.&quot;  He&#39;s just <br/>
thinking about what he wants, to pick her up.  He then figured out that she kicks <br/>
her legs every time he picks her up.  One time she got him with her back claw, <br/>
and he realized that was what she was trying to do all along.  He figured out <br/>
what I already knew, she hates being picked up! lol <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re noticing the animal wants more attention, and your kids aren&#39;t.  Point <br/>
out your observations to them.  They&#39;ll probably start paying more attention <br/>
to the animal&#39;s cues to be fed, watered, played with.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;That cage is getting pretty stinky, I betcha he doesn&#39;t like that smell.  <br/>
Animals have more sensitive noses than humans do, did you know that?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Or, &quot; The hamster runs around the cage a lot when you come walking by, I <br/>
think that&#39;s him trying to tell you that he wants to play with you.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My fish makes a big splash when he&#39;s hungry, it means we&#39;ve not fed him that <br/>
day, and that he&#39;s mad at us.  My son noticed this first, actually. <br/>
<br/>
Pets are like babies who can&#39;t tell you what they want or need.  You have to <br/>
pay attention to their behavioral cues. Model that for your kids, they&#39;ll <br/>
catch on really fast. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that young children are capable of providing total care for their pets.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree!  I&#39;d like to clarify that it isn&#39;t the pet care that is the issue.<br/>
I&#39;m willing to clean cages and feed/groom pets, or ask the kids if they&#39;d<br/>
like to feed the animal (they sometimes think of the feeding by themselves,<br/>
and sometimes help me with the cleaning).<br/>
<br/>
My question is more about how much attention is reasonable to expect them to<br/>
spend doing something that THEY say they like and want to keep.  If it&#39;s a<br/>
puzzle or game that gets played once in a blue moon, it is easy enough to<br/>
stick it in the garage until the next time.  Or if my child says she wants<br/>
to play an instrument, but rarely actually does it, that is no big deal.<br/>
But the pets take up more room and require time and money to care for even<br/>
when nobody wants to pay attention to them.<br/>
<br/>
My 10yod clearly loves animals.  Especially ones that we don&#39;t own!  I am<br/>
taking her to guide dog puppy training classes and I assist as needed with<br/>
her pet sitting jobs.  For the past couple of months she has been asking for<br/>
a pet bird.  I&#39;m not against her having a pet bird, but I wonder if it will<br/>
end up being treated like the hamster is treated, or should I say not<br/>
treated, but ignored most of the time.  Maybe I need to revise my idea of<br/>
how much attention certain pets need.<br/>

I think then maybe you should look at the pets you have or want. If you<br/>
don&#39;t mind the care giving and are looking at the attention, how much<br/>
attention can a hamster really need???? Put a little wheel in there or buy<br/>
one of those hamster balls and let him roll all over the floor for awhile. I<br/>
bet the kids would watch him then!!! And depending on the kind of bird,<br/>
walking by the cage every hour or so and talking to him is attention. I&#39;m<br/>
not sure whether it&#39;s necessary to take him out and &quot;play&quot; with him. A bird<br/>
is one thing I have never had.<br/>

to<br/>
spend doing something that THEY say they like and want to keep.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know, but again, I think it is unrealistic to assume they will *want* to <br/>
care for an animal, including attention, as much as the animal needs it.  I <br/>
think it is reasonable to expect that when they asked for the animal they <br/>
had every intention in the world of caring for it and providing it with <br/>
undying attention and love.  By emphasizing THEY, it sounds as though *you* <br/>
have expectations of them that they have not met.  Honestly, I don&#39;t think <br/>
it is reasonable or realistic to expect a 10 yr old child to fully grasp the <br/>
permanance of an animal&#39;s needs.  I know some children do, but I know a lot <br/>
don&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If it&#39;s a puzzle or game that gets played once in a blue moon, it is easy <br/>
enough to<br/>
stick it in the garage until the next time.  Or if my child says she wants<br/>
to play an instrument, but rarely actually does it, that is no big deal.<br/>
But the pets take up more room and require time and money to care for even<br/>
when nobody wants to pay attention to them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see an animal being much different at all, to a child, than a game <br/>
or an instrument.  They all have their &#39;honeymoon&#39; phases of interest.  They <br/>
all take up space, time and money and must be cared for if we want them to <br/>
be kept in good condition.  I realize there is an emotional and living need <br/>
with the animal, but to a child, it&#39;s not much different.  In the beginning, <br/>
it&#39;s all sugar and chocolate.  Sooner or later, you begin to crave salt.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My 10yod clearly loves animals.  Especially ones that we don&#39;t own!  I am<br/>
taking her to guide dog puppy training classes and I assist as needed with<br/>
her pet sitting jobs.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s great!  She will have an opportunity to spend time with animals she <br/>
loves without any worries!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; For the past couple of months she has been asking for<br/>
a pet bird.  I&#39;m not against her having a pet bird, but I wonder if it will<br/>
end up being treated like the hamster is treated, or should I say not<br/>
treated, but ignored most of the time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you are willing to accept that it *will* be ignored most of the time by <br/>
your child and are willing to step in and give it the attention it needs, <br/>
then get the bird!  If you feel like you will be resentful, put out and <br/>
irritated, don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Maybe I need to revise my idea of<br/>
how much attention certain pets need.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not necessarily.  I think you should think more about how much *you* want to <br/>
care for these animals under the assumption that in a few days, weeks or <br/>
months, the kids won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I understand completely how you feel.  I have been there far too many times <br/>
and it wasn&#39;t until *I* changed my perspective that the problem was solved.<br/>
<br/>
If we trust our children to know when and how to acquire knowledge, then a <br/>
natural extension of that trust would be understanding that they will care <br/>
for their pets and give their love and attention when they want to and need <br/>
to.  When the time comes that she is ready to completely care for an animal, <br/>
she will do it.  Without pushing and prodding.  Without suggestion.  And <br/>
without making promises she isn&#39;t prepared to keep.<br/>
<br/>
Something to chew on.  Feel free to spit at any time! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really appreciate your comments.  It certainly is my problem.  The kids<br/>
are happy with having the pets here when they are interested and paying no<br/>
attention at other times.  I&#39;m the one who is bothered.  What is the point<br/>
of having a pet if all we do is give it food?  Why do we have it unless we<br/>
do want to spend time with it?  I could certainly find other things to keep<br/>
in the space that is currently occupied by pets and their trappings, not to<br/>
mention other things to do besides clean cages! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It relates to parts of the unschooling process that I still haven&#39;t figured<br/>
out.  There are only so many hours in a day, only so many square feet in a<br/>
house, and only so much money available.  How do we decide where to allocate<br/>
those resources to best support our children?<br/>
<br/>
When a child says they want a pet (or shows an interest in something) do we<br/>
rush out and get it?  Or do we wait until they&#39;ve indicated that they<br/>
really, really, really want it?  How can we tell how much they want it?<br/>
Where is the line between the unschooling parent who supports all the kids&#39;<br/>
interests and the one who doesn&#39;t do enough?<br/>
<br/>
I suppose there are no set answers to those questions.  Knowing my children<br/>
will give me clues.  Still, I could use some guidance from some of you<br/>
experts out there :-)<br/>

<br/>
No, maybe, we can&#39;t, there isn&#39;t one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are many things we should rush out and do, save putting <br/>
our a fire or some other drastic necessity.  Of course, there are times for <br/>
spontinaeity but bringing a pet into our homes isn&#39;t a good time for that! <br/>
;)  They may indicate they really, really want it the first time they see <br/>
it.  Caring for another living being is a big responsibility and one that <br/>
deserves serious consideration and thought.  I don&#39;t think there is a way to <br/>
really know how much they want it other than listening to them and watching <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, I wish I supported all my kids&#39; interests but the truth is, I don&#39;t.  I <br/>
acknowledge what they express interest in but sometimes things just look <br/>
cool and they don&#39;t want or need me to rush out and grab everything I can <br/>
get my hands on related to the moon, just because tonight it happened to <br/>
look really cool hiding behind the clouds.  There are times that they do <br/>
express an interest in something and I simply can&#39;t indulge them.  My <br/>
daughter wants a $300 bike but will have to wait until we move and get <br/>
settled.  She&#39;s also going to earn money to pay for half of it because it is <br/>
above what we can spend on a bike.  Imagine if all seven of my kids wanted a <br/>
$300 bike!  OUCH!<br/>
<br/>
If we ran with every little whim our kids have....well in my case, I&#39;d need <br/>
my husband to pick up about 35 more jobs and 10 more houses to store all the <br/>
junk in! LOL<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I suppose there are no set answers to those questions.  Knowing my <br/>
children<br/>
will give me clues.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the best thing you can do is to relax.  Don&#39;t worry that you might <br/>
be depriving them of diving into every possible new adventure head first.  <br/>
Kids do a lot when left to their own devices.  The key is to support their <br/>
emotional and physical needs and find creative solutions and possibilities <br/>
for all the rest.  You don&#39;t have to rush out and buy a bird right away.  Or <br/>
a clarinet, volleyball net or anything else for that matter.  If you feel <br/>
the urge to rush out and buy or do, take a trip to the library and talk <br/>
about birds on the way there.  Maybe your daughter will grab a bird book.  <br/>
Or maybe she&#39;ll grab a cookbook and beg you for a set of her own pots and <br/>
pans!<br/>
<br/>
Kids feel everything with such passion and zest.  Trust your judgement and <br/>
hone in on those patience skills.  It will all work out in the end and you <br/>
will have drawn the perfect line of balance and happiness.<br/>

<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>

<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, I &quot;really really&quot; wanted pets.  I vowed I&#39;d take care of them, and I did for a day.  Then I&#39;d get bored of it and forget about the care.  I loved playing with the pets, but hated the responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time, when I see parents worrying about their kids not taking care of pets, its because they think their kids are growing up to be irresponsible.  (Funny how we have a tendency to take one small thing like that and make it into the &quot;big picture&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
The good news is, this worry is really unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
Today, I&#39;m a full grown adult.  And when I got my dog, I was afraid I&#39;d be irresponsible (bec. that is what I always heard from my parents about how I didn&#39;t care for my pets).  <br/>
<br/>
The truth is, I LOVE animals, and I DO take really good care of them, now that I&#39;m an adult.  So for all of these years, I&#39;ve lived with this fear that I would be the cause of some animal&#39;s suffering and avoided getting a pet of my own.<br/>
<br/>
Because of my own experience, I&#39;ve decided that when we get pets, they are for me to care for.  So, if its something I feel *I* can handle, I might do it (unless hubby objects).  But if I can&#39;t, I&#39;ll say &quot;no&quot; but I don&#39;t necessarily lecture anyone on the proper care of pets like I might have a few years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying anyone else here was doing that, just me :o).<br/>

  &lt;&lt;When a child says they want a pet (or shows an interest in something) do <br/>
  we<br/>
  rush out and get it?  Or do we wait until they&#39;ve indicated that they<br/>
  really, really, really want it?  How can we tell how much they want it?<br/>
  Where is the line between the unschooling parent who supports all the kids&#39;<br/>
  interests and the one who doesn&#39;t do enough?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  No, maybe, we can&#39;t, there isn&#39;t one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think there are many things we should rush out and do, save putting <br/>
  our a fire or some other drastic necessity.  Of course, there are times for <br/>
  spontinaeity but bringing a pet into our homes isn&#39;t a good time for that! <br/>
  ;)  They may indicate they really, really want it the first time they see <br/>
  it.  Caring for another living being is a big responsibility and one that <br/>
  deserves serious consideration and thought.  I don&#39;t think there is a way to <br/>
  really know how much they want it other than listening to them and watching <br/>
  them.<br/>
<br/>
  Boy, I wish I supported all my kids&#39; interests but the truth is, I don&#39;t.  I <br/>
  acknowledge what they express interest in but sometimes things just look <br/>
  cool and they don&#39;t want or need me to rush out and grab everything I can <br/>
  get my hands on related to the moon, just because tonight it happened to <br/>
  look really cool hiding behind the clouds.  There are times that they do <br/>
  express an interest in something and I simply can&#39;t indulge them.  My <br/>
  daughter wants a $300 bike but will have to wait until we move and get <br/>
  settled.  She&#39;s also going to earn money to pay for half of it because it is <br/>
  above what we can spend on a bike.  Imagine if all seven of my kids wanted a <br/>
  $300 bike!  OUCH!<br/>
<br/>
  If we ran with every little whim our kids have....well in my case, I&#39;d need <br/>
  my husband to pick up about 35 more jobs and 10 more houses to store all the <br/>
  junk in! LOL<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;I suppose there are no set answers to those questions.  Knowing my <br/>
  children<br/>
  will give me clues.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I think the best thing you can do is to relax.  Don&#39;t worry that you might <br/>
  be depriving them of diving into every possible new adventure head first.  <br/>
  Kids do a lot when left to their own devices.  The key is to support their <br/>
  emotional and physical needs and find creative solutions and possibilities <br/>
  for all the rest.  You don&#39;t have to rush out and buy a bird right away.  Or <br/>
  a clarinet, volleyball net or anything else for that matter.  If you feel <br/>
  the urge to rush out and buy or do, take a trip to the library and talk <br/>
  about birds on the way there.  Maybe your daughter will grab a bird book.  <br/>
  Or maybe she&#39;ll grab a cookbook and beg you for a set of her own pots and <br/>
  pans!<br/>
<br/>
  Kids feel everything with such passion and zest.  Trust your judgement and <br/>
  hone in on those patience skills.  It will all work out in the end and you <br/>
  will have drawn the perfect line of balance and happiness.<br/>

nocturnal and sleep pretty much all day.  Mine sleep all day.  We have a couple.  <br/>
Different species so they are in different habitats but they make their little <br/>
nest and curl up all day and sleep.  But if we are up around midnight and hear <br/>
the wheel turning we will take them out to play for a while.  We do have a <br/>
small mouse and he has lots of play things in his habitat but he is just to small <br/>
and quick to take out.  He would be gone in a flash. <br/>
<br/>
We have quite the variety of pets.  I find that if I take the hamster out to <br/>
play then the boys get real interested real fast and will spend a half hour or <br/>
so playing.  I think they forget sometimes but if I start they will follow.<br/>

couple of birds, canary birds, and they seem to be stressed when I put my hand <br/>
in their cage.  Like when I clean things.  So I don&#39;t push the interaction <br/>
with the birds and try to clean as quickly as possible.  There are so many toys <br/>
out there for birds and the ones we have like to be together.  They play <br/>
together all the time.  We have just 2.  We enjoy watching them and listening to <br/>
them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mary Ellen, we grew up with pet birds and they are basically <br/>
attention-maintenance free. :) They sit in their cages and if they <br/>
are happy, they sing. I highly recommend a canary that can be <br/>
near a sunny window. They make the most incredible music. We <br/>
also had numerous parakeets. Their cages need cleaning and <br/>
they do need food and water, but they don&#39;t actually need to be <br/>
played with.<br/>
<br/>
We had neighbors who used to allow their parakeet to fly around <br/>
the family room. That was exciting! My mom didn&#39;t go in for that. :)<br/>
<br/>
We later had an African grey parrot. It was loud, very messy, and <br/>
mean spirited when you&#39;d open the cage door. I feel sorry for the <br/>
big fella now. I don&#39;t think African grey parrots are meant to be in <br/>
cages.<br/>
<br/>
Our family now has had one bunny and two pet rats. The bunny <br/>
was a waste of time and money. Not friendly at all. The rats, otoh, <br/>
were wonderful! If my son would cycle out of his daily interest, I <br/>
would just take one of the rats out from time to time myself. This <br/>
almost always re-awakened his interest in them. My husband <br/>
would too. He&#39;d take a rat and put it on his leg and let the little <br/>
guy climb up to his waist (while lying down).<br/>
<br/>
Then our son would jump right in. Sometimes it&#39;s more fun to <br/>
play with a pet... while playing with a human too. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great questions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just where you are now. I have a son who is really an animal <br/>
lover and has been for his entire life. He&#39;s now 8, almost 9. I <br/>
haven&#39;t wanted a dog because I don&#39;t want to hound (he he) the <br/>
kids to look after it and I may have allergies. I&#39;m also a bird lover <br/>
and I don&#39;t like the idea of our dog chasing them all away from <br/>
our yard.<br/>
<br/>
Yet my son has a passion that it unbending toward animals and <br/>
would love a dog or pet or something! That&#39;s why we began with <br/>
pet rats. This worked well for him because rats are friendly, <br/>
clean (yes, they are) and intelligent. They also have short life <br/>
spans. They were full of cysts and had to be put to sleep after <br/>
two years. This turned out to be about the right life span for a pet <br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
We now have membership passes to our city zoo. And we&#39;re <br/>
talking about the next pet... which may actually be a dog. I&#39;m <br/>
working up to it. We read about animals, we watch birds together <br/>
(he&#39;s becoming quite a birder!) and he even stops to look at <br/>
insects (yesterday: &quot;Mommy, Mommy, come quickly. We have <br/>
baby bees all over our flowers. They&#39;re so cute!&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
My older kids have asked for a dog many times, but then they <br/>
lose interest in even asking. My 8 yr old has an undying love for <br/>
them. I&#39;m beginning to think that I am holding him back from one <br/>
of the tings that makes him tick.<br/>
<br/>
This has come through hundreds of conversations and <br/>
observations and connections.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;re just about to make some pet decisions ourselves.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose there are no set answers to those questions.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Knowing my children<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; will give me clues.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. And accommodate and support all the interest that you see. <br/>
Take advantage of every dog your child knows now. Read animal <br/>
books. Observe birds in your yard. Go to the zoo, farms and other <br/>
animal places. Pets are good, but there&#39;s a world of animals out <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I found a great book called Working with Wildlife that had all <br/>
kinds of jobs available for adults who wanted to work with <br/>
animals. That was an inspiring little tome for my boy and we&#39;re <br/>
now following up on some of its ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

I would be very careful with getting a bird.  From my understanding <br/>
they get extremely attached to their owners and have a very difficult <br/>
time readjusting (macaws can die of a broken heart, literally).  Some <br/>
types of birds can become very hostile if left with someone else for <br/>
a vacation of something like that.  They also live a very long time <br/>
so it is a huge commitment. It really takes the right person to be a <br/>
bird owner so just a little warning.  If she really wants one you may <br/>
want to see if you can get her involved with a bird rescue center of <br/>
some sort so she can see first hand the energy they need.  Just <br/>
thought I would mention it because I found all that info suprising!<br/>

I don&#39;t know much about the little birds which is probably what she <br/>
is thinking about but larger birds do.  They need time out of cage, <br/>
actual play time, etc.  They are a heck of a lot more complicated <br/>
than I ever imagined.  Needless to say we will not be getting a <br/>
bird!  BTW, I heard similar things about rabbits.  I saw this show <br/>
about this lady that did rescues of rabbits and she was saying how <br/>
they live for 13 years or so and are very snuggly little guys.  Her <br/>
cheif complaint was people get them on a whim and then get rid of <br/>
them by letting them loose, etc.   It was pretty interesting and kind <br/>
of sad, who knew?  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Someone else also wrote about bunnies becoming &quot;dud&quot; pets..   Landon has a <br/>
blue dutch bunny and also a Dumbo rat ( has big ears).  Both are wonderful, <br/>
loving, fun pets.. BUT, bunnies do take a lot more effort to get them to be really <br/>
domesticated.   Well, actually, the effort is just a lot of handling when <br/>
they are still young.   Landon did a lot of research on rabbit care before he <br/>
decided to get a rabbit.  He knew it was going to take time and lots of handling <br/>
to get his bunny used to being petted.   He got Ed ( his bunny) when he was <br/>
just weaned from his moma, and he also made sure that he had already been <br/>
handled.   He bought him from a reputable breeder and not a pet store.   So, Ed has <br/>
been a part of our family from the get go and we all handled him a lot.  There <br/>
are certain ways to hold/pet rabbits, and Landon had learned all about them, <br/>
so we knew how to hold him and how NOT to hold him.  He is litter boxed <br/>
trained and he comes when you call him.  He kicks his shavings around when you walk <br/>
by to show he wants your attention.. Or he kicks the cage, almost like a <br/>
karate side kick.  He stands on his hind legs to beg for a treat. Its funny.   So, <br/>
I guess my point was.. Rabbits can make good pets if you know how to care for <br/>
them<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something we&#39;ve done that I think works really well, is research just exactly <br/>
what we really want. For example, Sierra really wanted a rabbit. But having <br/>
an outdoors animal and one that won&#39;t want to be held much, isn&#39;t what she <br/>
really wants. So we all discussed just exactly what the kids wanted.<br/>
They wanted a pet they could carry around, hold a lot and play with.<br/>
But their Dad is allergic to a lot of animals and we have a small house.<br/>
<br/>
The perfect animal was a rat. Rats LOVE to be held and played with, which <br/>
makes them a marvelous kids pet. Unlike hamsters and other rodents, rats actually <br/>
crave human interaction. They&#39;re curious and amusing.<br/>
<br/>
While I do most of the cage cleaning, I often go in and find that someone has <br/>
beat me to the filling of the water and food dishes. They get their rats out <br/>
and play with them frequently. In fact, I often get reminded that Luna (my <br/>
rat) hasn&#39;t been held enough lately and would they like me to bring her out? :) <br/>
Smart kids!!<br/>
I&#39;ve never,ever said anything other than,&quot;boy, these ratties sure act like <br/>
they need some attention&quot;  <br/>
They LOVE their little friends. So I think choosing a truly right pet for <br/>
your family needs is really important.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re getting a greyhound next. The kids have learned through my research to <br/>
really think about all the pet qualities you want. Trevor told me he really <br/>
wants to get a male greyhound because it will be more playful than a female (the <br/>
females are extremely calm most times) so they know through former experience <br/>
that choosing specific pet qualities can make or break the relationship!  And <br/>
when we choose these pets I am getting something I know I am willing to care <br/>
for on my own, so that takes a lot of pressure off too.<br/>

Lanora, 12, REALLY wanted to breed rats.  She took excellent care of the<br/>
three she already had and put in hours of research into their care.  We<br/>
adopted a mom and her litter.  They aren&#39;t neglected &quot;care&quot; wise, she feeds<br/>
them and cleans their cage BUT they aren&#39;t played with much.<br/>
<br/>
She admits that it&#39;s too much and regrets her decision (thankfully there<br/>
have been no more babies).  I have reminded her that she should be giving<br/>
them the same amount of attention because her regret isn&#39;t their fault but<br/>
it hasn&#39;t really made much difference.<br/>
<br/>
Even when you&#39;re &quot;almost positive&quot; that they&#39;re &quot;sure&quot; it can surprise you.<br/>
If she ever says she &quot;really&quot; wants something else I will still trust her,<br/>
she has gained much more realistic perspective from this experience.  She<br/>
has passed on several opportunities for new pets since, she doesn&#39;t want the<br/>
responsibility.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I would be very careful with getting a bird.  From my understanding<br/>
they get extremely attached to their owners and have a very difficult<br/>
time readjusting (macaws can die of a broken heart, literally).  Some<br/>
types of birds can become very hostile if left with someone else for<br/>
a vacation of something like that.  They also live a very long time<br/>
so it is a huge commitment.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well like I said I&#39;ve never had a bird but I think that maybe you are more<br/>
referring to parrots as opposed to parakeets, canaries or cockatiels. I<br/>
don&#39;t think they live any longer than big dogs. Don&#39;t parakeets live like<br/>
8-10 years??? My MIL had quite a few cockatiels and they were friendly but<br/>
not so attached to her that they would die without her. One flew out the<br/>
door, one died and one she had to give away when she moved. That one did<br/>
fine in it&#39;s new home.<br/>
<br/>
Now looking at macaws or african greys or cockatoos is a totally different<br/>
bird!!! Way more expensive, sensitive and lives a lot longer.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know much about the little birds which is probably what she<br/>
is thinking about but larger birds do.  They need time out of cage,<br/>
actual play time, etc.  They are a heck of a lot more complicated<br/>
than I ever imagined.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I know that about the larger birds. I really have my heart set on a<br/>
Peach Moluccan Cockatoo. One day though. They are pretty darn expensive and<br/>
being that I never had a bird before, not exactly the right pet for me right<br/>
now! But I love them and well, maybe when I retire from having little kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Her cheif complaint was people get them on a whim and then get rid of<br/>
them by letting them loose, etc.   It was pretty interesting and kind<br/>
of sad, who knew? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That I know too because I see the ads from the Wildlife Rescue Center here<br/>
saying they are over run with bunnies. At Easter they are begging people not<br/>
to buy from stores and if they really want a rabbit come and see them.<br/>
Sierra asks about a bunny every bnow and then and Tara always wanted a bunny<br/>
when she was younger. I just have a hard time with a pet that when left out<br/>
will just run away and I need to go chasing it. Not sure really how calm and<br/>
affectionate some bunnies are. I think I&#39;ll stick to a turtle for now. Might<br/>
be bringing one home this week.<br/>
<br/>
I want to go to Teepee Western Wear for a belt for Joe and the Seminoles are<br/>
right across the street always selling turtles. I&#39;ve wanted to stop a few<br/>
times but never have. I&#39;ll have to see how much this will all cost me.<br/>
Sierra loves turtles. We actually had a large box turtle years ago that Joe<br/>
found. Tina Turtle!!! We ended up letting her go at a wildlife park. She was<br/>
so happy to swim away. I almost cried.<br/>

a bunny. I really don&#39;t have that much time to devote to a bunny and with<br/>
the dogs and cats, just not a good calming house for a bunny to come into.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

How wonderful!!!! I know a few people who have adopted rescue greyhounds and<br/>

the new one does.<br/>

usually &quot;Adopt a Senior&quot; month with many groups so our adoption fee was <br/>
waved.  &quot;Senior&quot; my foot!!!!!  He tears around the yard at breakneck <br/>
speeds and digs holes to the center of the Earth.  LOL  He&#39;s really a <br/>
pretty cool dog.  One giant perk (IMO) is *minimal* shedding.  I have <br/>
enough &quot;fur tumbleweeds&quot; already.  ;^)<br/>

back porch.  We have the best of both worlds, Alex and I go down to watch them <br/>
and listen to them sing,  but we don&#39;t have to feed them or clean out their <br/>
cages ( and with two cats, I just don&#39;t want to deal with THAT anyway!) .  It&#39;s <br/>
wonderful!  They&#39;re so sweet!  <br/>
