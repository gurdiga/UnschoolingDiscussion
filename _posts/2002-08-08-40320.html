which reminds me to say that the new Austin Powers movie is exceptionally <br/>
funny, and one of the scenes involves subtitled Japanese, but the subtitles <br/>
are in white, over a partially white background, until something is moved (a <br/>
door, someone who was wearing white) so you see what PART of the subtitle <br/>
looks like, and then you see what the full version of it was.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, too much toilet humor, lowbrow slapstick and other embarrassments.  But <br/>
you&#39;ll probably laugh anyway because it&#39;s really funny.<br/>
<br/>
You will never see Britney Spears again withtout thinking of a scene or two <br/>
from that movie.  And there are other cameos (although she&#39;s better than a <br/>
cameo--three scenes, counting end credits, or more).  Probably some favorite <br/>
actor of yours will show up.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t anyone here spoil it for anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it.  But those <br/>
who haven&#39;t gone, don&#39;t miss the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
All that and Godzilla.  <br/>

The last scene is between BS and Mini-me. The topic is Mini-me&#39;s endowment<br/>
(The key word is Tripod)<br/>
Hang around after the credtits.<br/>
(The pun was intended but the misspelling was not. I left it there because<br/>
it was apt.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626929347">hey, in case anyone is wondering, i took my e-mail name from the Chair of Indefinite Studies, who is a professor at Unseen University in Terry Pratchett&#39;s Discworld series.  If you haven&#39;t read these, you might want to look into them. they&#39;re kindof comedy/fantasy/spoofing everything, and very fun reading.  <br/>
heh, i guess someday i should write an e-mail that does something other than suggest a book...sorry, i am unabashedly fond of books.  and, since i don&#39;t have kids (i&#39;m on this list because i plan to unschool my kids when i have them, and in the meantime it&#39;s probably a good idea to expose myself to the ideas of unschooling... plus, it just makes me happy to think that i&#39;m not the only person in the world who thinks that learning is a natural process for children and adults), i guess i don&#39;t have any great anecdotes to add.<br/>
