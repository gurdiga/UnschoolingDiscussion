it.....afterall you paid for.... I guess I am not the only ones.....the guys <br/>
that precut don&#39;t understand it either, but they just do the cutting and if <br/>
they customer&#39;s don&#39;t want what they paid for, they are happy to resale it <br/>
and make a profit....LOL<br/>

have to get rid of all the brainwashing......<br/>
I am finding myself having to admit he&#39;s right.....that&#39;s so hard...... since <br/>
I always fight tooth and nail cause I&#39;m right the majority of the <br/>
