 Has anyone had any experience with children suddenly displaying fearful <br/>
 behavior? I have an 8yo who suddenly is scared to be in his room alone, or <br/>
 even to be upstairs alone. He cries  -- and I mean really frightened crying. <br/>
 He&#39;s afraid to sleep in his room. He won&#39;t consider being dropped off at a <br/>
 friend&#39;s house or Scouts. Just starts crying and clinging. This has been <br/>
 going on about two weeks. No major scary events in our lives lately. My <br/>
 mother suggests it is because we are together too much and he needs to be <br/>
 out more with other people and &quot;children his age.&quot; Has anyone had any <br/>
 experience with this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   maybe it is an age thing? I would read Your Eight Year Old by Ames and Ilg.<br/>
<br/>
   I would not listen to your mother&#39;s advice. Go w/ yur own instincts on <br/>
this. Sometimes we as parents don&#39;t even see the connection to a behavior <br/>
right away. <br/>
