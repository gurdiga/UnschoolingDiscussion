<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122239173">I think this was written in 1997.  I found it looking for something I  <br/>
need for the conference coming in September, but it reminded me of  <br/>
the recent bit on TV and parental control.  It&#39;s my writing, except  <br/>
what&#39;s marked as quotes.  Everything from here down was then:<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
====<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t even look back to see who the original author was, so I hope  <br/>
this will come across as totally clinical which it&#39;s intended to be.   <br/>
Two quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Can I unschool and still have him accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The question really is, can HE unschool and still accomplish his  <br/>
goals?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Terminology reflects thought and belief.<br/>
Sometimes just a slight shift in terminology will release the mental  <br/>
block that keeps people from understanding unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of examples:<br/>
Calling grown women &quot;girls&quot; instead of women kept women from  <br/>
advancing for many years.   When someone learns to remember to say  <br/>
&quot;women&quot; when they mean women, suddenly girls BECOME women in their  <br/>
minds.<br/>
<br/>
Nursing and childbirth counselors and midwives remind women to change  <br/>
their terminology.  If a woman says, &quot;My doctor says I have to...&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;My doctor won&#39;t let me...&quot;  it&#39;s really worth interrupting and  <br/>
asking them to change the words and thought to , &quot;My doctor  <br/>
recommends...&quot; or &quot;My doctor doesn&#39;t believe...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If woman give ownership of their babies to the doctor, they will not  <br/>
be able to make decisions and to act on their own beliefs without a  <br/>
doctor&#39;s approval or permission.<br/>
<br/>
If parents retain ownership of their children&#39;s learning, the  <br/>
children cannot learn on their own.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve just said above is / will be / has been misinterpreted to  <br/>
mean the parents should throw up their hands, back off, and not say a  <br/>
word.  That&#39;s not what I mean at all.   Possibly the very same  <br/>
interactions can occur, but the balance of power and responsibility  <br/>
can change by changing the phrasing and definitions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Can he unschool and still accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is that different in wording only from &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Can I unschool and still  <br/>
have him accomplish his goals? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s 180 degrees of difference mentally, and very little  <br/>
difference in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Is it a change worth making?<br/>
I think it&#39;s absolutely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
When forceful suggestions are made here, though, sometimes people  <br/>
take it as criticism or attack.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re trying to help push someone&#39;s car and it&#39;s not going  <br/>
anywhere, sometimes pushing harder helps.  Occasionally, though, you  <br/>
just HAVE to say, &quot;Is it in neutral or not?&quot;   If they say, &quot;No, it&#39;s  <br/>
in first gear, push harder,&quot; what are you going to say?   You stop  <br/>
pushing and say &quot;You HAVE to put it in neutral first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So before anyone can enjoy the benefits of unschooling they HAVE to  <br/>
&quot;put it in neutral.&quot;  They have to take off the emergency brake.   <br/>
Otherwise the car won&#39;t move.  Too many people say &quot;We tried pushing  <br/>
the car, it didn&#39;t move, we bought a new one.  Pushing cars never  <br/>
works.&quot;<br/>
