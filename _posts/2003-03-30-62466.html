<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007198600">Ok I have to say that I have had a very controling nature {less then parents I know, but still controlling}<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to give that up since being on here. Mostly that have had the choice but I had still felt the need to step in. <br/>
<br/>
Well this morning my 3 year old was playing and didn&#39;t want to eat what my 7 yo had fixed {some speggetti O&#39;s} <br/>
<br/>
I left her alone. <br/>
<br/>
She fell asleep while her and her oldest sister  were playing the Playstation and later woke up and wanted a sucker. <br/>
<br/>
She thought at first I wouldn&#39;t let her have it, but I gained her trust and told her I&#39;d open it for her. After a couple of licks she decided she didn&#39;t want it so insted of making her eat it because she had asked for it, I told her I&#39;d wrap it up for later. She decided she wanted a &quot;Hot Pocket&quot; and happily ate it.<br/>
<br/>
So yes this stuff works. In the end it just seems to be a control issue. I&#39;m trying to give them control and only step in when it would be a REALLY bad decision. <br/>
<br/>
 Say something like if she wanted to eat vitimins like candy or something like that.<br/>
