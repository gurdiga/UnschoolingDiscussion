 </span></blockquote>Completely off the grid?  Some of my best friends live in <br/>
earthships.  The original community is in the Taos, NM, area, hardly <br/>
off the grid.  But earthships have now landed in communities all over <br/>
the globe.  These are blissfully quiet, delectably comfortable living <br/>
spaces.  And you can even rent one in the Taos area to stay in for a <br/>
few nights to see if earthship living is really for you.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of good innovation still going on in New Mexico regarding <br/>
variations like straw bale homes, rammed earth homes, and of course, <br/>
the traditional labor intensive southwestern mainstay, the adobe <br/>
home.  Many live with photovoltaic electricity, composting toilets, <br/>
gravity fed water systems, Servel refrigerators, passive and active <br/>
solar heating, Paloma water heaters (heat as you use), solar water <br/>
heating, and other alternatives. Some counties even allow grey water <br/>
systems!  <br/>
<br/>
Another interesting place that challenges one to rethink the concept <br/>
of shelter is The Shelter Institute in Woolwich, Maine.  They teach <br/>
people how to design and build their own &quot;shelter,&quot; nudge students to <br/>
reconsider every aspect of the shelter concept.  <br/>
