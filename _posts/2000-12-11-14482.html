Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dec. 10, 2000 | CHICAGO (AP) -- A judge will hold a hearing Monday on a<br/>
&gt; 6-year-old boy who was removed from his mother&#39;s custody because she was<br/>
&gt; still breast-feeding him when he was 5, allegedly against his wishes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services took the child<br/>
&gt; in July after a baby sitter called a child-abuse hot line.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Champaign County Circuit Judge Ann Einhorn is scheduled to hear the<br/>
&gt; case. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DCFS investigators said the boy told them he no longer wanted to<br/>
&gt; breast-feed, but the mother, 32, said her son never indicated that he<br/>
&gt; wanted to stop. She denied any allegations of abuse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Authorities did not identify the woman to protect the child&#39;s privacy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;The fundamental issue on this is that the child did not want to do it,<br/>
&gt; and I think that&#39;s one of the key reasons this is a problem,&quot; said DCFS<br/>
&gt; Director Jess McDonald.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The agency also contended the woman shared a bed with her son. The<br/>
&gt; mother said there is not enough space for the boy to have his own room.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;My child was weaning himself,&quot; the mother said. &quot;I don&#39;t think DCFS<br/>
&gt; has any right to be involved in this decision between me and my child.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although it is rare for an American child to be breast-fed at such an<br/>
&gt; advanced age, physicians and anthropologists said it is not unheard of.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Katherine Dettwyler, an anthropologist and nutritionist at Texas A&M<br/>
&gt; University, recently conducted a study of 1,280 children whose parents<br/>
&gt; reported their breast-feeding practices. Of the total, 375 children<br/>
&gt; were still breast-feeding at age 4, 212 at age 5 and 67 at age 6.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Mother who breastfeeds boy, 6, faces custody fight<br/>
&gt;State calls it abuse; she defends approach<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By Sue Ellen Christian and Julie Deardorff<br/>
&gt;Tribune Staff Writers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In an exceptional case, Illinois child protection authorities have taken a<br/>
&gt;6-year-old boy from the custody of a Champaign mother because she was still<br/>
&gt;breastfeeding him, allegedly against his wishes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the view of the mother fighting for the return of her only child, the<br/>
&gt;battle pits American norms about parenting against her right to raise her<br/>
&gt;son as she sees fita style that includes allowing the boy to choose when<br/>
&gt;he quits nursing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To state child welfare officials, the case is about abuse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Authorities at the Department of Children and Family Services took the boy<br/>
&gt;from the 32-year-old woman&#39;s home after a baby-sitter called an abuse hot<br/>
&gt;line and the child subsequently told investigators that he no longer wanted<br/>
&gt;to breastfeed, they said. The mother says she told investigators her son<br/>
&gt;never indicated he didn&#39;t want to nurse and that she would continue to<br/>
&gt;breastfeed as long as her son wished.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The agency has determined that the child&#39;s living situation constitutes<br/>
&gt;sexual molestation and risk of harm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Breastfeeding a child is not the issue,&quot; says Deborah Kennedy, DCFS<br/>
&gt;regional administrator in the central region. &quot;It&#39;s after he has stated<br/>
&gt;that it is unwanted and she had that information and didn&#39;t indicate she<br/>
&gt;would halt that activity ... then you have unwanted behavior on his part<br/>
&gt;and that constitutes abuse.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;She added: &quot;In general, any contact between a sexual organ against the will<br/>
&gt;of the child constitutes abuse ... because it&#39;s breastfeeding, it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;sensitive issue.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On Monday, final arguments are scheduled in the family court case in<br/>
&gt;Champaign County, which alleges emotional harm to the boy. The case is to<br/>
&gt;determine whether the boy was neglected or abused and whether he should<br/>
&gt;return home to his mother.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The mother says the misguided case is based on society&#39;s narrow ideas about<br/>
&gt;what constitutes good parenting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Research shows that while rare, it is not unheard of for a child to be<br/>
&gt;nursing at 6.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Indeed, some pediatricians and child-rearing experts have come to espouse a<br/>
&gt;revival of old parenting practices, such as extended breastfeeding and<br/>
&gt;sleeping in the same bed with childrenwhat some call &quot;co-sleeping.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;DCFS has said that co-sleeping was a factor in its decision to take the<br/>
&gt;child from the home. DCFS investigators say the woman slept naked with the<br/>
&gt;boy, which she denies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;They are saying because you&#39;re not practicing Dr. Spock American-style<br/>
&gt;parenting, you&#39;re a bad mom,&quot; says the petite, feisty woman who was born on<br/>
&gt;a farm in Downstate Illinois. &quot;What about all those places in the world<br/>
&gt;where the family sleeps in one room and that is co-sleeping and you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;telling me all those people are maladjusted? It&#39;s cultural bias.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;My son would come to me and ask to nurse,&quot; says the woman. &quot;It&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;sexual. It was a closeness thing. When he&#39;s ready for it, he will ask to<br/>
&gt;end breastfeeding.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A complete understanding of the case is elusive, in part because not all<br/>
&gt;the testimony and evidence is public. The judge in the Champaign County<br/>
&gt;case, Ann Einhorn, has refused to release any documents, and the state&#39;s<br/>
&gt;attorney as well as the lawyer representing the boy refuse to discuss the<br/>
&gt;case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(The Tribune editorial standard is not to name juveniles in investigations<br/>
&gt;of sexual abuse, so the names of the child and the mother, who have the<br/>
&gt;same last name, have been withheld. In interviews, the mother did not<br/>
&gt;request anonymity.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The woman is the oldest of nine children in a family that she says<br/>
&gt;practiced co-sleeping.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Her current home is a two-bedroom, second-floor apartment, cluttered with<br/>
&gt;mounds of clothes, toys, newspapers and boxes of food through which narrow<br/>
&gt;pathways have been carved. Hoping her son will be home for Christmas, she<br/>
&gt;has purchased about a dozen presentsa scooter, a book, the game<br/>
&gt;Battleshipwhich sit stacked on the stairs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The mother works part time at a liquor store and takes continuing education<br/>
&gt;classes. She never married the child&#39;s father, who now lives in Oregon and<br/>
&gt;only recently has instigated contact with the boy. He did not return phone<br/>
&gt;calls from the Tribune.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The mother says she practices child-led weaning, which is supported by the<br/>
&gt;Schaumburg-based breastfeeding advocacy organization, La Leche League<br/>
&gt;International, and allows the child to determine when he or she is done<br/>
&gt;nursing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;My child was weaning himself,&quot; she says, &quot;he was nursing for 10 minutes a<br/>
&gt;day and on weekends a little more. I don&#39;t think DCFS has any right to be<br/>
&gt;involved in this decision between me and my child.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Natural or the norm?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;DCFS documents given to the Tribune by the mother indicate that the boy<br/>
&gt;told a child protection investigator that he no longer wanted to nurse and<br/>
&gt;had told his mom that; the mother says her son has never communicated that<br/>
&gt;to her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The documents also indicate that the boy told the investigator that he<br/>
&gt;still shared a bed with his mother and &quot;sometimes when she does not have<br/>
&gt;clean clothes, she sleeps naked.&quot; The boy told the investigator that he<br/>
&gt;always slept in clothes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In an interview, the mother says she has not slept with him naked since he<br/>
&gt;was around age 3, when she stopped because her son commented that she<br/>
&gt;should put some clothes on. Though she has since moved, the mother says her<br/>
&gt;son did not have his own room or his own bed in their former three-bedroom<br/>
&gt;apartment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Her parenting style and the way she was raised bring to the fore areas of<br/>
&gt;child-rearing that many of today&#39;s parents keep private because they are<br/>
&gt;not seen as widely acceptable in society, experts say. While no researcher<br/>
&gt;supports forcing a child to nurse or co-sleeping naked if that creates<br/>
&gt;discomfort for a child, they also say that co-sleeping and extended nursing<br/>
&gt;are both perfectly naturalit is society that makes them seem unnatural.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Research shows that many women continue to nurse their children well beyond<br/>
&gt;infancy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Katherine Dettwyler, an associate professor of anthropology and nutrition<br/>
&gt;at Texas A&M University, conducted a study in the late 1990s on 1,280<br/>
&gt;children whose parents self-reported information about their breastfeeding<br/>
&gt;practices. Of the total, 375 children were still nursing at age 4, 212<br/>
&gt;children were nursing at age 5, and 67 children were nursing at age 6,<br/>
&gt;according to Dettwyler.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Elizabeth Baldwin, a Miami-based attorney who specializes in breastfeeding<br/>
&gt;cases and is an adviser to La Leche League International, says &quot;there is<br/>
&gt;nothing wrong with breastfeeding at age 6.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;You cannot make a child nurse; either the child has the need or does not<br/>
&gt;have the need,&quot; Baldwin said. &quot;We have sexualized the breast to the point<br/>
&gt;where we assume that it is a sexual thing rather than a tool for nursing.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Extended breastfeeding and co-sleeping often go hand-in-hand, experts say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Other countries wouldn&#39;t even know there was a question to be asked about<br/>
&gt;where should my baby sleep,&quot; said James McKenna, a professor of<br/>
&gt;anthropology and the director of a mother-baby behavioral sleep lab at the<br/>
&gt;University of Notre Dame. &quot;It is a recent Western concept engrained in us,<br/>
&gt;an emphasis on individualism and the idea that it&#39;s a moral principle that<br/>
&gt;early in life babies and children need to soothe themselves.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;McKenna added: &quot;In our society, we equate nudity with the potential for<br/>
&gt;sexuality. It may not be a sexual act at all in the minds of participants;<br/>
&gt;it is externally influenced viewpoints that make it so.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He warned, however, that not all co-sleeping arrangements are necessarily<br/>
&gt;healthy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;The benefit of any kind of social behavior is determined by the context in<br/>
&gt;which it occurs,&quot; McKenna said. &quot;In a healthy human family, sleeping<br/>
&gt;arrangements can enhance that which is already good, or it could be the<br/>
&gt;case sleeping arrangements can enhance that which is already bad.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Focus on boy&#39;s reaction<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Champaign case is similar tobut also critically different froma<br/>
&gt;celebrated case out of New York state in 1991. In that case Denise<br/>
&gt;Periggo&#39;s 3-year-old daughter Cherlyn was taken from her because Periggo<br/>
&gt;had strong feelings of sexual arousal when breastfeeding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the Champaign case, experts are divided on how the nursing was affecting<br/>
&gt;the boy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A report by Champaign forensic psychologist Dr. Marty Traver,who evaluated<br/>
&gt;the boy upon referral from Judge Einhorn, described an alert, relaxed child<br/>
&gt;who expressed ambivalence about nursing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It is clear that [the boy] has suffered some emotional problems as a<br/>
&gt;result of his extended nursing,&quot; Traver wrote. &quot;Those problems however do<br/>
&gt;not appear to rise to the level of abuse unless there is evidence that [the<br/>
&gt;boy&#39;s] mother nursed him for her own gratification.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;The primary detriment from extended nursing in this case, was that [the<br/>
&gt;boy] was ashamed of doing so and did not feel socially appropriate in doing<br/>
&gt;so,&quot; Traver&#39;s report states.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;A parent must weigh the damage done by participating in something society<br/>
&gt;does not approve of against the positive effects and advantages of<br/>
&gt;continuing to do so. In this case, as in many others, the parent and child<br/>
&gt;had to keep the continuing breastfeeding a secret because of societal<br/>
&gt;disapproval. This sets the child up to keep other secrets that he cannot<br/>
&gt;yet understand,&quot; the report stated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Traver also said it was not appropriate for the boy to continue to sleep<br/>
&gt;with his mother. &quot;At this age, it would be psychologically harmful for him<br/>
&gt;to be in his mother&#39;s presence when she is nude. ... (The boy) must learn<br/>
&gt;to sleep in his own bed and soothe himself to sleep.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But a report by Kate McDougall, a Catholic Social Service social worker who<br/>
&gt;is counseling the mother and child, concluded that while the mother&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&quot;parenting style may be considered somewhat permissive, this therapist does<br/>
&gt;not have concerns about [the boy&#39;s] safety while in her care.&quot; McDougall<br/>
&gt;added that she saw no evidence of any abuse in the relationship.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The boy &quot;has come to feel ashamed and guilty about breastfeeding as a<br/>
&gt;result of his being removed from his mother&#39;s care due to their nursing.<br/>
&gt;This therapist has concerns that these feelings of shame and guilt will be<br/>
&gt;exacerbated by further separation,&quot; McDougall wrote in a clinical<br/>
&gt;assessment report.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;McDougall also stated in her report that she had no concerns about the two<br/>
&gt;sleeping in the same bed and recommended the boy be returned home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The woman&#39;s public defender, David DeThorne, said Traver&#39;s testimony stated<br/>
&gt;that the child was embarrassed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;That shouldn&#39;t be a reason the state should get involved,&quot; DeThorne said.<br/>
&gt;&quot;She was doing something to him outside the norm, and [perhaps] he didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want tothat is open to dispute as well.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He added: &quot;Parents should be allowed to make decisions that might be out of<br/>
&gt;the norm. Most parents don&#39;t breastfeed at age of 6, but it doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s wrong for the child.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Countered DCFS spokeswoman Martha Allen: &quot;There is a problem when the<br/>
&gt;mother is sleeping naked with a 6-year-old; we live in America and we have<br/>
&gt;our norms too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;This is a case that not just DCFS but the state&#39;s attorney and judge<br/>
&gt;determined was inappropriate and was a form of abuse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;It&#39;s inappropriate for a mother to be breastfeeding a child at 6 years old<br/>
&gt;and to be sleeping naked with him. The reason DCFS found it an issue was<br/>
&gt;we&#39;re looking at the area of sexual abuse when we say molestation. There is<br/>
&gt;risk of actual and emotional abuse. We are in the realm of sexual abuse;<br/>
&gt;that is the reason that we took the child out of the mother&#39;s care.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On Monday, Judge Einhorn will hear final arguments from both sides in the<br/>
&gt;Champaign County case. Einhorn may decide on Monday, or she could wait<br/>
&gt;until a later date, to determine whether the boy was neglected or abused.<br/>
&gt;If her determination is that the child was abused, another hearing will be<br/>
&gt;held to decide whether the child can go home or not, and to determine a<br/>
&gt;plan for the mother to get her son back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Though she wants her son back, the mother also refuses to compromise her<br/>
&gt;methods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;They took my son because I&#39;m not following the DCFS cookbook on raising a<br/>
&gt;kid,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#39;s so outrageous, they need to admit they made a mistake<br/>
&gt;and drop it.&quot;<br/>

**********<br/>
Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>
