<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107393360">I brought up critical thinking at unschooling.com a few months back and got a <br/>
weird response from someone accusing me of schoolishness, of suggesting <br/>
school-type stuff.  It was baffling.<br/>
<br/>
If school recommends careful thought, should a homeschooler reject careful <br/>
thought because they (sometimes try to) teach it in school?<br/>
<br/>
So about shoes on phone wires, or any other thing I hear that I&#39;ve only heard <br/>
once from a dubious source or that just doesn&#39;t make logical sense, I run it <br/>
through my filters of what makes sense, and how would people know, and could <br/>
it be even feasible or plausible?<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who&#39;s wondering what&#39;s even meant by &quot;critical thinking&quot; I went <br/>
through several websites to find some short, clear ones.<br/>
