<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937161578">I would recommend looking in your yellow pages and attending Sunday services <br/>
at whatever churches you consider within a reasonable distance.  You&#39;ll <br/>
figure out whether you like it before you know what it really is about.  I <br/>
personally feel a great awe at the fact of life on this planet and feel that <br/>
religion is often a powerful aid to many, but was uncomfortable as part of <br/>
any group with a &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude.  I feel supported and <br/>
spiritually comfortable at my UU congregation.  Try it out.</div>

have difficulty finding a place where we are comfortable.<br/>
