<br/>
The whole point of avoiding THOSE words has to do with an unschooling <br/>
mindset. If you can take THOSE words out of your vocabulary, you can more <br/>
easily SEE unschooling. It&#39;s difficult. It&#39;s part of the paradigm shift. <br/>
IFyou can let go of THOSE words, you&#39;ll be able to  &quot;get it&quot;. THAT&#39;S the <br/>
point of banning &quot;textbooks, NO, curriculum, practice, obedience&quot;, et al. And <br/>
we CAN substitute other words for those: YES. Real books. Do. TV. Principles.<br/>
<br/>
This is IMPORTANT. <br/>

Yes.  That&#39;s what the whole conversation was about.  Every word has its <br/>
euphemisms in Society.<br/>
<br/>
But those words don&#39;t have to do with learning theory.<br/>
<br/>
If this were a Christian clean-language yahoogroup, then we wouldn&#39;t need to <br/>
discuss what the replacement words were.  We would all know them.  We could <br/>
discuss whether &quot;darn&quot; was too rough for polite conversation.<br/>
<br/>
But if one has never, ever ONCE considered the difference between teaching <br/>
and learning, the utter NON application of &quot;teaching&quot; to natural learning, <br/>
then they will have a very difficult time even imagining how someone could <br/>
learn without a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
If they can&#39;t imagine that, if they cannot come to SEE it clearly, they will <br/>
not be able to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
If you have unschooling ideas or experiences to offer this list, please offer <br/>
them.<br/>

share the information on this list with their young children. The lack of<br/>

girls for a walk or something. I&#39;ll admit, I was blushing, growing up in<br/>
a house with absolutely no swearing tolerated. You had to B.M. or tinkle.<br/>
You could not &quot;fart&quot;, but must go to the bathroom to &quot;toot&quot;. My dd was<br/>
warned against rhyming in front of Grandma. She often  dropped &quot;bad&quot;<br/>
words when rhyming duck, stuck, f***, or itch, stitch, b****, and Grandma<br/>
would look at me and say &quot;you are going to allow that?!?!&quot; DD  would just<br/>
wonder &quot;allow what?&quot; She had no clue. Ironically though, after spending<br/>
the day with Grandma who has cable and the Disney channel, both dd&#39;s came<br/>
home with some not-so-refined sayings such as butt-sniffer, retard, and<br/>
shut-up, to name a few, things they would never be subjected to in our<br/>
house.<br/>

<br/>
In many cases (like your first set, &quot;the f word&quot; and &quot;intercourse) the Anglo <br/>
Saxon word is overridden by theword that came from the Norman French or from <br/>
Latin.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, &quot;intercourse&quot; is from Latin and is the &quot;scientific&quot; term, <br/>
shortened from &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; which is itself a euphemism for the <br/>
plainer Latin word &quot;coitus.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Shit is also Anglo Saxon (meaning its been in English since before the Norman <br/>
Conquest, which means 1000 years old and maybe more).  &quot;Poop,&quot; I have no <br/>
idea.   &quot;Bowel movement&quot; is like &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; in a way.  Long and <br/>
technical and vague.<br/>

<br/>
All the stuff I read on this list hits so close to home. I wish we all<br/>
could climb the trees together with rainbow colored hair.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just east of Denver, CO where the trees are so small they couldn&#39;t<br/>
hold my weight. I always wanted pink hair since before Missing Persons<br/>
was popular, but never had the guts. Well, I did dip the ends in pink<br/>
once when I was doing my daughter&#39;s hair, but it&#39;s just not the same. My<br/>
daughter&#39;s hair changes color on a regular basis, I&#39;m so proud. She could<br/>
use some unschooln friends cause the public school friends she has just<br/>
don&#39;t seem to fill her needs, and the homeschoolers round here might just<br/>
think we&#39;re freaks. My 15yo son freaked the other day about me not<br/>
forcing him to do math all these years. I had to point out how he can do<br/>
math and if or when he needs to use it every day it&#39;ll come faster to<br/>
him, and how, as he stood there playing some riff on his guitar, he&#39;s<br/>
learned all these other wonderful things during the time &quot;I&#39;ve waisted&quot;<br/>
not forcing him to do math. I think I got my point across but he let me<br/>
know he&#39;ll still blame me for everything anyway. It&#39;ll always be &quot;Mom&#39;s<br/>
fault&quot;, I can live with that. My youngest son is 12 and still isn&#39;t<br/>
comfortable reading, but he&#39;s not uncomfortable not reading:-). He knows<br/>
so much about so many different things but hasn&#39;t learned too much, if<br/>
any of it, from a book. We&#39;re big Simpsons fans, hell, we&#39;re big TV fans<br/>
and the night owls at our house even watch South Park. We&#39;re not as<br/>
together as some of you sound to be but we&#39;re doing ok. For these and<br/>
many more reasons, when I sit here and listen to what you&#39;re all saying I<br/>
feel at home. The timing of some of these posts are so perfect it&#39;s<br/>
scary. <br/>
<br/>
Pardon my run-on sentences, I had to get that out.<br/>

(by their standards), it&#39;s going to be a lot more effective to depend on<br/>
ourselves to do the screening. We all have different standards and what one<br/>
person finds offensive won&#39;t be what someone else does, so even if they<br/>
remember to warn us, there are going to be times when they don&#39;t realize<br/>
that what they&#39;re doing could be offensive.<br/>

It&#39;s a list for adults so it&#39;s probably best not to assume the content is G<br/>

became the rulers and the Anglo Saxons were the peasants. So anything Anglo<br/>
Saxon was vulgar and anything Norman was classy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also why we use one word for the meat (that the Normans ate) and<br/>
another word for the animal (that the Anglo Saxon peasants tended):<br/>
cow/beef, sheep/mutton, deer/venison, chicken/poultry. (Though we do now use<br/>
chicken to refer to the animal and the meat. Perhaps because poultry doesn&#39;t<br/>
refer to a specific animal meat anymore.)<br/>

eggs.<br/>
<br/>
My French dictionary lists two words for chicken: poussin and poulet.<br/>
<br/>
Pullet is a young chicken. Which came from poulet which was a diminutive of<br/>
poul (cock) and refered to a young cock.<br/>
<br/>
Which seems to suggest poultry was specifically chicken. So what did the<br/>
Normans call goose and duck meats? And if they didn&#39;t have a different name,<br/>
why not? And if they did, why did we lose them?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something interesting:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The following is an excerpt<br/>
&gt; from A GOURMET´S GUIDE -<br/>
&gt; FOOD AND DRINK A TO Z,<br/>
&gt; John Ayto, p. 368.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In common with beef, mutton, pork and veal, venison was a term introduced by<br/>
&gt; the descendants of the Norman Conquerors of England to refer to the flesh of a<br/>
&gt; particular animal used as food. But it has not always meant &quot; deer-meat&quot;. At<br/>
&gt; first, it referred to the meat of any animal killed in the chase, which could<br/>
&gt; include wild boar, hare, and rabbit as well as deer ( &quot;Hares are thought to<br/>
&gt; nourish melancholy, yet they are eaten as venison, both roasted and boiled.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Fynes Moryson, An Itinerary, 1617.) This reflects the word´s origins, in Latin<br/>
&gt; venatio, &quot;hunting game&quot;; a derivative of the verb venari, &quot;hunt&quot;. Signs of the<br/>
&gt; modern narrowing-down in signification to &quot;deer-meat&quot; appear in the late 16th<br/>
&gt; century ( &quot;Amongst the common sort of people, nothing is accounted venison but<br/>
&gt; the flesh of red and fallow deer,&quot; John Manwood, A Treatise of the Laws of the<br/>
&gt; Forest, 1598), but wider options remained open well into the 19th century ( &quot;<br/>
&gt; a haunch of Kangaroo venison&quot; , Godfrey Mundy, Our Antipodes, 1852).In 1983,<br/>
&gt; Broken Arrow Ranch worked with the USDA to refine the definition of &quot;venison&quot;<br/>
&gt; for meat labeling purposes. After a great deal of research and discussion, it<br/>
&gt; was agreed that the term &quot;venison&quot; could be used for labeling meat derived<br/>
&gt; from members of the deer and antelope families.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So maybe that Gourmet&#39;s Guide would answer the other questions too.<br/>

&gt; 1.    1066-1250. About 900 words were borrowed during this phase, with most of<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.    1250-1400. The heaviest borrowing from French occurred in this period<br/>

could build boats to kick the butt of the Spanish Armada) and turkeys and <br/>
tobacco.  <br/>
