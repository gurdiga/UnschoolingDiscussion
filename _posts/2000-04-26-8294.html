hi,
<p>what i understood her to be saying was that kids are hardwired to learn
therefore there&#39;s no need to use a teaching or &#39;facilitating&#39; hs method.&nbsp;&nbsp;
i didn&#39;t pick up on the part about not helping kids learn in the way you
implied but felt she helping her kids acquire knowledge as the need arose
- she helped write a paper on the legalities of unschooling w/ her oldest
and help her younger one discover edible plants in their backyard - perhaps
this is just semantics or splitting hairs type of thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>it seemed apparent she uses books (unless she has a good grip on taxonomy:)
and isn&#39;t completely anti-school because she sees her kids going on to
college if they so choose.&nbsp; i thought the article ended on a weird
note because the 10 yo, when asked about school, said she&#39;d like to go
but when asked why she said because she&#39;s never been there.&nbsp; sounds
to me like she&#39;d be more interested in a field trip than a lifestyle change.&nbsp;
but the author interpreted it as a denial by the mom of the child&#39;s wishes
but it sounded more whimsical to me.
<p>the part i liked was this:
<br>&#39;No matter how inane the conversation, Furgason listens intently and
takes her kids seriously. There is no
<br>shushing, even when they get a little loud with excitement.&#39;
<p>i also admire her courage to stand up and be counted.&nbsp; it&#39;s obvious
her kids are learning just not in a neat and scheduled manner much to the
authors and ps teacher dismay.

we help them learn how to put their socks on...&nbsp; But I thought the
bit about the 6yo eating leaves was good :-)&nbsp; The 10yo wanting to
go to school was interesting, is it unschooling to not allow her to go?&nbsp;
I suppose one could argue about the disruption to the family and so on,
but if it&#39;s genuinely her chioce?&nbsp; I&#39;ve always said that if mine wanted
to go, they could, even though it would turn my life upside down, but ahving
kids turns one&#39;s life upside down anyway &lt;g&gt;&nbsp; Food for thought...</font>&nbsp;<font size="-1">Thanks
