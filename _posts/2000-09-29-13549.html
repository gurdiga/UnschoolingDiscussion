<div id="ygrps-yiv-171733421">Mine&#39;s Dec 20th. Besides being just before Christmas, it ends in zero, so<br/>
it&#39;s hopeless as far as anyone remembering. (Has anyone else noticed that<br/>
about dates ending in zero? One of my daughter&#39;s is May 20th and no one can<br/>
get that one either.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when I was little, it made my day/year to have just a regular<br/>
birthday party as close to my actual birthday as possible. Not June. Not<br/>
after New Years. Not the first weekend of December. And to receive presents<br/>
like any of my cousins would in real birthday wrapping paper. Not those<br/>
dreaded birthday-Christmas combo&#39;s or half of a gift set for my birthday and<br/>
the other half for Christmas. In other words, an ordinary birthday. Cake,<br/>
guests, gifts....the usual.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have heard the same thing from all of the Dec. birthdays in our family, so I am always carfule how we celebrate hubby and son&#39;s birthdays.  Never a theme related to the holidays, no holiday paper, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
We do usually have a party on a differnet day for my son (like earlier in the week closer to daddy&#39;s birthday) because we celebrate Yule on the Solstice, which fell ON my son&#39;s birthday last year.  This year it is the day before.  However, as he gets older and understands about dates, and all the factors involved (like people being busy, interferrence with our own holiday traditions and observances, etc) I will let him choose which day he would like his party to be.<br/>
