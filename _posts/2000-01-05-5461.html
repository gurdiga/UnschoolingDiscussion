I saw a picture in our newspaper of &quot;B&quot; and &quot;I&quot; riding in a stroller,<br/>
pushed by their dad &quot;C.K.&quot;.  Are these relatives of yours?  I&#39;ll cut it<br/>
out and send it to you if you&#39;d like.<br/>

The darn trouble with cleaning the house is it gets dirty the next day<br/>
anyway,<br/>

thing.<br/>
