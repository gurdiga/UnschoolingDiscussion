<div id="ygrps-yiv-961338689">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to thank you for  giving me some food for thought on country <br/>
living!  I really appreciated it! If any one else has some input or <br/>
suggetions on moving to the country, I&#39;d love to hear them!<br/>
<br/>
Thought I&#39;d add my two cents on the food allergies.  My3yo has eczema, red <br/>
cheeks and behavior changes caused by allergies to milk and wheat!  Then my <br/>
1yo projectile vomits (as in 8 times in one hour!) from soy and eggs!!! Do <br/>
you realize how much stuff out there has these products? UGH!!! So we have <br/>
become VERY organic lately!  The one thing I have learned is that I can <br/>
trace 3 of the 4 allergies back to my diet when I was pregnant with them!!! <br/>
I have also stumbled upon this concept in a few books!  So, if any of you <br/>
are dealing with food allergies and considering having more children, watch <br/>
your diet when you&#39;re pregnant.  The biggest thing I learned was to not eat <br/>
the same foods all the time and not eating only craved foods!  You ought to <br/>
see me watching for the right child to grab the soy milk and the other to <br/>
grab the cow&#39;s milk in our house!  No vacations or visits to other houses <br/>
for dinner for awhile! We&#39;re just getting the hang of this.<br/>
