&quot;Children&#39;s lives have been evolving in<br/>
a way that mirrors the characteristics of the lives of criminals in<br/>
prison. They, too, have a roof over their heads, regular meals and<br/>
entertainment provided for them, but they are not free to go out. But<br/>
children are not criminals.&quot;</div>
