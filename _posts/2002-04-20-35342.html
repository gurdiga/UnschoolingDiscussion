<div id="ygrps-yiv-951543928">Hi,<br/>
  I grew up waking and falling asleep to the TV. My parents had one in about every room of the house. I don&#39;t watch much TV as an adult. I have my days, but  mostly I have many other activities.<br/>
 Now, my dh didn&#39;t always have a TV, and when his family did it was only one or two snowy channels, and very limited. As an adult, he loves TV, and vegges out watching it way more than I ever do.

His brother is the same way, and they both have to have it really loud and the lights preferably off. Also, they are always shushing everyone. <br/>

Not really trying to make a strong point, just my TV story.<br/>

I also think about his sheltered childhood and teen years, and wonder if that is why his was so out of control in his 20&#39;s. Maybe that is just him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679731594">My husband also had tvs in all the rooms in his house.  His dad is a real<br/>
tv and movie buff.  But there was a lot of fighting in their house and<br/>
not much positive connecting.  So, tv was either a buffer from the<br/>
fighting or the only way people interracted.  My husband loves his night<br/>
shows.  I used to not watch tv much, but now I do because I realize to my<br/>
husband it means connecting with me.  As a child, I always had unlimited<br/>
tv, not that I over-watched or underwatched it.  There were times when I<br/>
watched a lot and other times I didn&#39;t watch any.  But I can&#39;t stand to<br/>
have the tv on all the time, like a lot of people I know do.  It is<br/>
because of the way my mind is, or something.  I cannot not pay attention<br/>
to it if it is on.  Also, I can&#39;t forget it when it&#39;s over.  I go over<br/>
and over it again in my mind.  To me, the tv is like going to the<br/>
theatre.  When the show is on, it&#39;s got my attention.  I can&#39;t hold a<br/>
conversation while it&#39;s on.  It&#39;s also very hard for me to follow the<br/>
dialogue, so I really have to concentrate.  Maybe this is because I read<br/>
so many books growing up, i.e., I can&#39;t follow an oral dialogue the way I<br/>
can a written one.  I used to read excessively, a real bookworm.  (I<br/>
would focus all my energy on what I was reading, and go into another<br/>
little universe and have trouble shaking it off when I was in real life. <br/>
Sort of like an actor who can&#39;t get out of character even when he&#39;s not<br/>
acting anymore.)  Maybe if as a child  tv was taught as a value, good or<br/>
bad, it would affect one&#39;s viewing as an adult.  But I think enjoying it,<br/>
having it on all the time, hating it, ignoring it, or being hypnotized by<br/>
it has less to do with whether or not you watched too much of it growing<br/>
up, and more to do with an individual&#39;s unique tastes and physiology and<br/>
psychology.<br/>

I&#39;ve never heard anyone else say this but it sounds like what I have <br/>
to guard against when I am reading.  I can get so wrapped up in that <br/>
other &#39;world&#39; that when I finish the book or series of books, I go <br/>
into a minor depression.  I&#39;ve learned to control it, but in the past, <br/>
finishing a good series could make me non-functional for at least a <br/>
week!<br/>

who didn&#39;t.   And I can tell you stories of my friends and how some <br/>
literally never turned off the tv in their house, yet, noone ever <br/>
seemed to watch it.  To others who were restricted.  All of it seems <br/>
to me, to be a personality thing.  Restricted people binge, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes that was my point too - that if everyone told their own &quot;tv stories&quot; - <br/>
we&#39;d find that there is no specific way it will always turn out. Just NOT <br/>
having tv doesn&#39;t guarantee anything and neither does tv-watching guarantee <br/>
anything. It isn&#39;t the TV, itself, that is the real &quot;thang&quot; - to misquote <br/>
Joanna  &lt;g&gt;. It is what ELSE is going on in the family. In a family where the <br/>
kids go to school/daycare and have homework, music lessons, scouts, dance, <br/>
sports, and Kumon math - time is going to be so scarce that tv-viewing is <br/>
going to be taking away from time spent talking to mom and dad or siblings <br/>
and from time to play and read and so on. But in an unschooling family, there <br/>
is time for all that and some tv too. It just is really really different for <br/>
people who are unschooling. And, I&#39;m willing to believe that there are kids <br/>
who are adversely affected by tv and that parents recognize it. I think it <br/>
must be very rare. I think that more often the parents just don&#39;t like the <br/>
idea of tv because it &quot;looks&quot; like kids are doing anything productive. I <br/>
think that sometimes parents are just hoping that turning off the tv will be <br/>
the magic that will ensure their kids will grow up perfect in every way &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478868801">Bridget, I actually went for fifteen years without reading a fiction<br/>
book, out of concern for my mental health.  I read a lot of how to&#39;s and<br/>
other nonfictions, and I read children&#39;s stories to my kids.  But reading<br/>
fiction for myself was something I didn&#39;t want to get into, after almost<br/>
nonstop fiction from age six to twenty.  Last year I took it up again,<br/>
and do occasionally when I have the time and inclination.  It&#39;s sort of<br/>

And because of school being what it is, kids who read novels are considered <br/>
GOOD kids, studious kids, bright kids.  No matter that the novel is about sex <br/>
and drugs and murder, the vision of someone reading a book is soothing in <br/>
this culture.  If the kid sitting next to the reader (the reader would have <br/>
been me) is drawing some REALLY cool pictures with details of WWII planes, <br/>
that is BAD, dumb, a waste of time and paper.  If another kid is looking out <br/>
the window translating new things he&#39;s learned into Tewa (what they speak in <br/>
Santa Clara Pueblo), it looks like he&#39;s doing NOTHING.  (But at least he&#39;s <br/>
not wasting paper).  And if another kid is writing a note to a friend who <br/>
REALLY  needs some friendship and support, that note will be confiscated and <br/>
torn up and they&#39;ll both be in trouble.  But that kid who&#39;s reading about <br/>
hookers and the mafia is a GOOD KID!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824861916">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
(newbie here, trying to catch up :-)<br/>
<br/>
We have friends who allow almost no tv watching, whereas we have lots of <br/>
tv&#39;s and videos. When these two girls come over they are mesmerized by <br/>
the tv -- I&#39;ll see one of these girls standing almost nose to the tv, <br/>
staring at it. My kids are baffled - why would anyone want to watch tv <br/>
when there are friends to play with and interesting things to do? We <br/>
discuss a lot about choosing what to watch on television and making sure <br/>
it&#39;s worth your time. We also sometimes like it on for background noise, <br/>
and my eight yo dd and I had a discussion on good channels to put on for <br/>
background noise - she was complaining about the lousy stuff that was on <br/>
the kids channels during certain times - so we looked at A&E, History <br/>
Channel, Discovery and discussed those. Hubby and I tape shows and watch <br/>
them when we get a chance and then skip any that don&#39;t hold our <br/>
interest. Like a lot of things, there&#39;s good stuff on television and <br/>
junk. It isn&#39;t evil, isn&#39;t great -- it&#39;s all on how you use it. I&#39;m a <br/>
news junkie and a big A&E fan, so I generally put those on when I want <br/>
some noise. Hubby goes for espn, oldest likes the animal planet. And <br/>
lots of times, of course, we turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
Susan<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;   I grew up waking and falling asleep to the TV. My parents had one in <br/>
&gt; about every room of the house. I don&#39;t watch much TV as an adult. I <br/>
&gt; have my days, but  mostly I have many other activities.<br/>
&gt; Now, my dh didn&#39;t always have a TV, and when his family did it was only <br/>
&gt; one or two snowy channels, and very limited. As an adult, he loves TV, <br/>
&gt; and vegges out watching it way more than I ever do. I used to think, <br/>
&gt; &quot;oh, too bad it was so limited to him as a child, maybe he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
&gt; so obsessed.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His brother is the same way, and they both have to have it really loud <br/>
&gt; and the lights preferably off. Also, they are always shushing everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not really trying to make a strong point, just my TV story.<br/>

&gt; PS<br/>
&gt; I also think about his sheltered childhood and teen years, and wonder <br/>
&gt; if that is why his was so out of control in his 20&#39;s. Maybe that is <br/>
&gt; just him.<br/>
&gt; Oh, he&#39;d just love me telling his life on this huge list.<br/>
