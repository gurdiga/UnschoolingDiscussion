guess we are relaxed homeschoolers working towards unschooling.  How long <br/>
does it take to get &quot;there&quot;?  We started this process last year for 6 months, <br/>
then I put him back in kindergarten again, then I took him out and seriously <br/>
said &quot;we are going to do this&quot;.  I notice that everytime I have a rule for <br/>
something I&#39;ve started to think about whether it&#39;s safety or my control <br/>
issues.  For the first time yesterday we went to rent videos and I let Zak <br/>
pick whichever one he wanted.  He picked Simba (the Lion King II) and the <br/>
Land Before Time V.  I was internally in a bit of a panic that he might pick <br/>
up the Godzilla movie in the adult section he was looking at.  So how do you <br/>
determine what&#39;s ok and what&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
What if Zak decided he wanted to watch the Godzilla movie (which looked <br/>
scarey even for me).  Do I just let him get it and watch it?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t know if this will reassure you but my little guy ( now nine ) has<br/>
been watching Godzilla since he was four.  We love Godzilla.  <br/>
I do know what you mean though.  He once chose a scarry looking sci-fi<br/>
movie I had never seen, with an R rating.  I just gritted my teeth.  He<br/>
turned it off about twenty minutes in and said it wasn&#39;t what he thought<br/>
it would be.  ( He was seven )<br/>
He has very discriminating tastes these days and if it&#39;s a movie I<br/>
haven&#39;t seen he&#39;ll ask the clerk if it&#39;s any good.  ( sometimes this is<br/>
trouble because we love those horrible old B movies that no one else<br/>
likes! ) <br/>
My son knows some great places to get Godzilla toys if Godzilla fever<br/>
strikes at your house!  <br/>

or so, maybe I might be &quot;there&quot;. I really don&#39;t know. I have considered <br/>
myself an unschooler all along, but I know I really have not been, until the <br/>
last couple of years. And I still struggle with control issues at times. But <br/>
it is a great journey that our entire family is committed to and we just plug <br/>
away at it every moment.<br/>
<br/>
Funny story. .  Quinton likes to jump on the furniture and has created this <br/>
great game where he takes all the cushions off the couch and finds different <br/>
and pleasing (to him) ways of jumping off the highest part of the couch. It <br/>
really bugs Lelia (who is 12) and Bryan.  We finally realized why it bugs <br/>
Bryan so much. . . he was not allowed to jump on furniture when he was young <br/>
and he wants to join in with Quinton. Problem is when he does, he breaks <br/>
things!! LOL It bugs LElia cause she hates seeing the cushions all strewn <br/>
about. :)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I <br/>

<br/>
One second, but people often put that second off as long as they can.  I <br/>
don&#39;t understand why.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t either.  They ALWAYS say &quot;I don&#39;t know why we didn&#39;t we do this <br/>
sooner.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty went through a Godzilla phase.  I forced myself to watch some with him, <br/>
and he never got scared.  I found him a book about the making of some of the <br/>
early Godzilla movies (or with photos from the moview, at least, I forget), <br/>
and he was aware from the beginning that it was model art and animation and <br/>
puppets and such and was seeing it that way.<br/>
<br/>
Why is Godzilla &quot;worse&quot; than Land Before Time?  Land Before Time movies have <br/>
some good songs (there&#39;s a singalong tape with words going by of the songs <br/>
from the movies up to VI, I think it is), but there&#39;s still a lot of <br/>
scariness and screaming (CERA, STOP SCREAMING!!)  It&#39;s worth thinking through <br/>
such things, as you&#39;ve already said you&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to start unschooling before the mom really fully understands it <br/>
if possible, because the kids will show her that it works when they&#39;re given <br/>
an open, honest chance to do so.  The mom&#39;s fears and worries remain for a <br/>
while, but will gradually be replaced with the confidence and first hand <br/>
knowledge that one thing leads to another and that trust is rewarded.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008031491">Ansley LOVES horror movies. This is the kid who announced this year he&#39;s<br/>
going to study the paranormal (&quot;You know, Mommy - the WEIRD stuff&quot;).<br/>
He&#39;s seen several PG and R rated movies. We DO censor his choices to a<br/>
degree. For example, no ROBOCOP because  the first 10  minutes are so<br/>
incredibly violent - he&#39;d be into the  violence with little chance  to<br/>
react.  On the other hand, we went to see Jurassic park  3 and The Mummy<br/>
Returns in the theaters with him and he  LOVED them. My basic rule of<br/>
thumb is I have to see the movie first to see if, from how MY child<br/>
reacts, he will have TIME to turn it off before the intensity level is<br/>
too much  for him.<br/>
<br/>
Rachel Ravenhart<br/>
<br/>
PS&gt; He LOVED Billy Elliot when it was in the theatre. I knew a &quot;boy<br/>
dancer&quot; movie would be fun, but I never expected him to sit through the<br/>
whole thing.<br/>

think it&#39;s just that I&#39;ve been conditioned to believe (through my own <br/>

to watch out for with my kids.  Of course what that leads to is not <br/>
trusting that my kids will watch what they are interested in and not <br/>
watch what they are not interested in.  <br/>
<br/>
Good opportunity to practice faith I believe &lt;g&gt;   Thanks Sandra for <br/>
the help in opening up my mind to the kind of unschooling that I want <br/>
to have in my life.<br/>

Wanda. We have been known to break out singing &quot;Always look on the bright<br/>
