<div id="ygrps-yiv-130122580">we went out yesterday evening and found two within two miles of our house, <br/>
and it was SO cool! When we found our first one, we all geeked out <br/>
completely! I&#39;ve already got the first one for today planned, and I want to <br/>
get one together to hide.<br/>
<br/>
THIS is something everyone in our family will enjoy doing.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

&gt;We started geocaching a few months ago and it has been great.  The kids <br/>
&gt;love<br/>
&gt;finding the treasure and they actually want to go for hikes now!  We also<br/>
&gt;just got some travel bugs and will be releasing them sometime soon.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;really fun to look for geocaches while traveling because it gets you out to<br/>
&gt;places you might not have seen otherwise (even works in your own home<br/>
&gt;town!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Happy geocaching!<br/>
