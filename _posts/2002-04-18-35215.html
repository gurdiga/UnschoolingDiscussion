My heart aches for you.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter spent 6 weeks in jail once (for lying to a cop about her<br/>
boyfriend&#39;s REAL name) and it is a painful thing to endure.  I know how much<br/>
it hurts to know someone you love and care about is in a terrible place.<br/>
Hopefully the experience will help to bring a good change in his life.<br/>
<br/>
I wish there was some way I could think of something to say that would ease<br/>
your pain and make you feel better.<br/>
