&gt; Can anyone tell me the author of the book I think is called The Relaxed<br/>
&gt; Homeschooler, and Relaxed Record Keeping.  Is it Mary Hood?  I have a<br/>
&gt; friend in SC I want to pass this info to, and of course I can&#39;t find it<br/>
&gt; now.  Ha, ha.<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-22107394">I don&#39;t know how many of you have read Dick King-Smith, but we love him<br/>
here.  We read Babe, and loved it much more than the movie (which was<br/>
too sad and scary for my kids).<br/>
We just finished reading &quot;Sophie&#39;s Snail&quot;, and really loved it.  Sophie<br/>
is wonderful.  If you love nature and exploring the garden, and kids and<br/>
their honest way of being, you will love Sophie.<br/>
Just wanted to share.....<br/>
We also love Mr. Ape.  This was wonderful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145984852">I LOVE his books!  They are such a good read for younger kids to listen to.  I have not read a story by him that I was not touched by one way or another.  And every time a helicopter flies over, the kids look for pigs.  Nothing wrong with kids who have no idea pigs can&#39;t fly!<br/>
