<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645604711">Hello Mary,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to respond to you &quot; TARGET&quot; comment.<br/>
<br/>
I did not want to give to the local school eather. I did at first. Now I do not want to and I am having a hard time getting them to take it off of my bill. <br/>
<br/>
I have moved sense I started and am now home schooling. Unless they want to donate to me. LOL<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;. My local Target was shocked when I wouldn&#39;t give them a school <br/>
name to donate proceeds to from my credit card there. (money doesn&#39;t <br/>
come from me)<br/>
<br/>
Mary B&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

Happy St. Patrick&#39;s Day!!<br/>
