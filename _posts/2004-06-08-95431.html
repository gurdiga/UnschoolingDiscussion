&lt;&lt;   It needs to be actual oregano though,<br/>
<br/>
most of what&#39;s in the spice section at the store is really Mexican sage and<br/>
<br/>
wont work.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, MAN!  So all those kids all those years who thought oregano might pass <br/>
for marijuana not only didn&#39;t have real pot, they didn&#39;t even have real OREGANO!?<br/>
<br/>
The things we learn in retrospect... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Spices are funny.  Just like bugs and plants and birds the same name will be <br/>
used in different places for different things.   Robins here aren&#39;t like <br/>
English robins.  And I suppose there must be hundreds of examples like that, but <br/>
&quot;oregano.&quot;  Man...  <br/>
<br/>
I love names and language, so it amuses me twice. <br/>
<br/>
When I was little there were &quot;snake doctors&quot;  and &quot;lightning bugs.&quot;<br/>
Then I moved to northern New Mexico, from the swampy side of a lake near Fort <br/>
Worth, and found there were no snake doctors whatsoever.  There were <br/>
dragonflies (still a cool term) and fireflies (a little less dramatic than LIGHTNING <br/>
BUGS).<br/>
