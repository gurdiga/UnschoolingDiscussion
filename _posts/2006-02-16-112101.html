<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914170195">After several more back and forths with dh about unschooling (a <br/>
semi-yearly occurrence here), he witnessed/ participated the following <br/>
series of conversations over our Valentine&#39;s dinner. I wanted to take <br/>
the time to type it out because I (and many other unschoolers) often <br/>
talk about all the learning that goes on just by having cool <br/>
conversations with our kids, and this seemed like such a great example. <br/>
This one was rather heavy on my interests, but we&#39;re just as likely to <br/>
have really cool discussions that are heavy on science--dh&#39;s field of <br/>
interest--or anything else for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
Hanging out with the kids while having hors d&#39;oevres, we began talking <br/>
about loads of things that led to a really cool series of discussions <br/>
throughout the rest of the evening until we finally wrapped up over <br/>
strawberries dipped in chocolate sauce. Many of these topics were very <br/>
cursorily covered, at a level the kids could grasp and as the result of <br/>
questions they asked or attempts to illustrate the topic with an example <br/>
they&#39;d be familiar with, but nevertheless, we created and reinforced <br/>
loads more connections on our grand unschooling dot-to-dot!<br/>
<br/>
See if you can catch this crazy train...<br/>
<br/>
bolting food--new puppy<br/>
<br/>
Pip from Great Expectations, Oliver Twist--recent commercials--Dickens, <br/>
serial publications, Industrial Revolution<br/>
<br/>
Child labor laws, current poverty level across the world<br/>
<br/>
sweatshops, illegal aliens, Men in Black--opening scene<br/>
<br/>
American wealth, unable to fathom poverty<br/>
<br/>
&quot;full fathom five thy father lies&quot; --Shakespeare, Donne or Hopkins--look <br/>
it up because I can&#39;t remember which--it was Shakespeare, but GM <br/>
Hopkins&#39; &quot;Wreck of the Deutschland&quot; was the other poem I was thinking of<br/>
<br/>
dirty limericks in which dh always tries to rhyme &quot;Hohakas&quot; (don&#39;t ask <br/>
me why, except he&#39;s from NJ--reminiscent of Hackensack?)<br/>
<br/>
iambic pentameter, trochaic meter<br/>
<br/>
Tyger, Tyger--one of the kids&#39; favorite poems--Little Lamb, William Blake<br/>
<br/>
innocence vs. experience<br/>
<br/>
Christian mythology, garden of eden, tree of knowledge, fall from grace<br/>
<br/>
All of which ended with a really deep discussion of whether we&#39;d choose <br/>
knowledge or painless obedience--guess which we all chose? ;)<br/>

Here&#39;s a convoluted path to a song by Dave Van Ronk<br/>
that&#39;s just a recitation of NJ town names--Hohokus is<br/>
in there!<br/>

Then scroll down a bit to the end of the third<br/>
paragraph under the June 7 entry, and click on &quot;Garden<br/>
State Stomp.&quot;<br/>

Hohokus (sometimes spelled Ho-Ho-Kus) is a small town in Northern NJ about 8<br/>
miles NW of Hackensack.<br/>
