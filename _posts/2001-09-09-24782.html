<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted to say that it seems I may have finally learned that sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
better to not jump in on a topic with my beliefs, as from all the recent <br/>
debate I have hit a EUREKA moment. Although I may not always agree with all <br/>
of you ( I really think that is plain impossible with this bunch of ladies <br/>
since you&#39;re all SO different. Which keeps us all thinking, so it&#39;s a good <br/>
thing lol),  I learn alot by you all making me think about things a little <br/>
more. <br/>
<br/>
Let me share with you my EUREKA moment, and I know many will not agree with <br/>
my thinking, but I&#39;m hitting myself on the head over what I didnt&#39; see <br/>
before. It hit me as I was thinking about how the more &quot;radical&quot; ladies allow <br/>
their children to stay up to whatever hour they feel like TRUSTING their <br/>
child, letting their child play guns TRUSTING their child, etc. And, of <br/>
course, I was thinking of the recent heated posts I&#39;ve read. I believe it was <br/>
Dawn who shared about the good thing about homeschooling is that in PS it&#39;s a <br/>
dictatorship (I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve got the wrong person and I&#39;m sorry for <br/>
totally not saying it as eloquently as it was originally put). I was thinking <br/>
about that post when EUREKA. I am a hypocrite. I tell others I want to be <br/>
respected for having my own beliefs, that I don&#39;t like being told my way of <br/>
doing things is wrong, that I want to be respected. YET, I tell my children <br/>
what they are allowed to play with, where they are allowed to go, when they <br/>
are allowed to go there, what television shows they are allowed to watch, <br/>
what things they are allowed and not allowed to say. I understand and respect <br/>
that many people need those limits, as I strongly felt I needed. But for ME, <br/>
MYSELF, MY OWN PERSONAL SELF, I hit a EUREKA moment. Who am I to tell others <br/>
I want to be fully respected when I don&#39;t fully respect my children. Who am I <br/>
to dictate my children&#39;s lives to the extent that I do when I despise anyone <br/>
dictating my life in any way, shape, or form. Who am I to be a hypocrite.<br/>
<br/>
I have been a dictator in our home. I have told my fiance that I do NOT want <br/>
him having encouraging my son to follow certain interests becaus I do not <br/>
agree with them. I haven&#39;t allowed my children to watch certain television <br/>
shows because I<br/>
feel they are against MY beliefs. I sit there and say I want my children to <br/>
choose to be christian for themselves, yet I push my christian beliefs on <br/>
them. Yet I tell others that I would never push my christian beliefs on <br/>
another person. I am a hypocrite. That is the conclusion I have come to. I <br/>
have tumbled it through my head most of the day. I debated about should I <br/>
RELAX a bit more? Should I TRUST my children? Well, after that EUREKA moment, <br/>
the answer was YES (although a shaky yes because I have some very strong <br/>
opinions about things that I know my children will pursue once I relax) I sat <br/>
down and shared this with my life partner and he got that &quot;dear in the <br/>
headlights&quot; look. I can only imagine the shock in his mind as I&#39;m telling him <br/>
that I&#39;m WRONG and I need to RELAX. He jumped up with how he&#39;s always wanted <br/>
to take his son shooting, but he knows how I feel about guns. He wanted to <br/>
take our son to a monster truck race, BOY did I go off on him over that one! <br/>
I have decided what my children will not watch, where they will not go, as <br/>
well as so much more. I have been a dictator, something I have said I detest. <br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s my EUREKA moment. Thanks to the debate this board offers. <br/>
<br/>
I have come to these views of my own free will. No one from this board or <br/>
anywhere else is standing behind me with a shotgun to my head. I have not <br/>
been hypnotized, brainwashed, or drugged into a false conciesness. I have <br/>
meerly hit a most likely life altering EUREKA moment which is the &quot;....<br/>
epitome of the exchanges of information <br/>
we&#39;re all voluntarily engaged in&quot;<br/>

lives more than I control mine.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard people say they limit content on TV and movies.  I bet at<br/>
least one of you is running a net nanny.  <br/>
That is your decision and more power to you, but it irritates me that<br/>
many of you also were willing to jump all over me from day one before you<br/>
even asked what I mean by our jobs list.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I think you are the one who is not getting it.  I did look<br/>
within and what I found was someone who has trusted her kids implicitly<br/>
form the first day we started homeschooling in 1995 (I think that&#39;s the<br/>
right year).  My girls have had the ultimate unschooled experience for 6<br/>
years.  This year, we added a bit of direction at Rachel&#39;s request<br/>
because of what she wants to be doing next year.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know what the problem is here but from the moment I started<br/>
talking, you all assumed you knew who I was and where I was coming from. <br/>
I was told some pretty rude and insulting things from the very beginning.<br/>
 Had I been someone truly struggling with the concepts, I would have cut<br/>
and run pretty far back.  I have no problem with your methods, your<br/>
theories or your conversation.  But I think it is a shame that you would<br/>
treat a relative stranger this way when what you ought to be doing is<br/>
putting a better face on the concept.  Really, think about it, if I had<br/>
left this group back on Saturday, when I was first told that I am wrong,<br/>
I would have taken away the opinion that you are all a bunch of fanatic<br/>
nut cases who only believe in your own little sliver of homeschooling. <br/>
Is that really what you want to accomplish?  Driving away those who are<br/>
willing to speak up because you think they don&#39;t agree with you?  <br/>
I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret too . . . I would have left then had I<br/>
not been here because of a specific other person&#39;s request that I join. <br/>
That&#39;s why I stuck around long enough to find out that you are not ALL<br/>
rude and obnoxious here and why I will probably stick around for a while<br/>
longer. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>As I said this morning - I don&#39;t particularly care what you call me.  In<br/>
fact you can call me that crazy bitch if you want to.  What I object to<br/>
is the fact that I&#39;ve been told all of the following things and these<br/>
were before you even knew anything about me.<br/>
<br/>
1.  I am not unschooling - but you have no idea what the dynamics here<br/>
are and whether it is or is not unschooling<br/>
<br/>
2.  I am being dishonest with my kids (even though they know what I do)<br/>
over the TV cable issue<br/>
<br/>
3.  I don&#39;t belong on this list - good way to promote your philosophy -<br/>
tell those who are even a little bit different to go away right up front!<br/>
<br/>
4.  That I am telling YOU that you are doing it wrong.  (Ihaven&#39;t said<br/>
word one about what I think of what YOU are doing.)  <br/>
<br/>
5.  In a round about way, that I don&#39;t offer my kids enough options. <br/>
(even when I was bedridden, they had TONS of options.  My girls used<br/>
them, my son did not.)  <br/>
<br/>

you were falling short as parents but the criticism lobbed at me has been<br/>
downright shocking!  But then the actual critical stuff came from only<br/>
two or three people.<br/>

Well yes, of course! ......The oldest 3 and the sister<br/>
of whom I had custody are all adults, the youngest, 7,<br/>
can do what he likes...but the internet doesn&#39;t<br/>
attract him too much yet.  Kathryn&#39;s links have<br/>
intrigued him some...and I&#39;ve done some searches that<br/>
caught his attention now and again, but mostly it is<br/>
too slow for him to stick with for very long.  We have<br/>
a few cds that he likes. Math Blaster, Explorapedia,<br/>
some others. He occasionally will send an ecard or<br/>
email to someone special. Observing his tastes with TV<br/>
he likes the sort of things that even I consider to be<br/>
worthwhile. I have been blessed with youngsters that<br/>
continually amaze me with their inborn goodness. They<br/>
are so NICE! So, yes, they have access to whatever.<br/>
And I signed a form at the library saying the 7 yr old<br/>
could access the net without limitations. &#39;course he<br/>
can&#39;t get there without me. I know how to back track<br/>
spam or other offensive material to its source<br/>
(usually) so I feel relatively safe in my ability to<br/>
protect my child from predators. He does have some<br/>
guidelines about releasing information which are<br/>
basically the same as telephone ettiquite and safety.<br/>
The older kiddos learned this too. Nobody&#39;s starved<br/>
for attention or ego boosting so that&#39;s not a<br/>
danger...knock on wood.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about garbage is that it is so tacky and<br/>
boring....not very attractive at all....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844424229">I believe she was referring to something like a web blocker where the probram <br/>
kinda filters the web pages being viewed and if it has any &quot;undesireable&quot; <br/>
content as set forth by either the program itself or the program&#39;s settings, <br/>
it doesn&#39;t allow the site to be viewed. We&#39;ve been using one. I guess it&#39;s <br/>
time to think about that one now LOL.<br/>

<br/>
When we signed Holly on for an AOL screenname, I signed her up as &quot;young <br/>
teen&quot; (although she&#39;s 9) because they don&#39;t let 9 year olds do anything but <br/>
go into the AOL kids-only area.  <br/>
<br/>
She wasn&#39;t able to get instant messages, so I raised it to &quot;mature teen.&quot;  <br/>
She couldn&#39;t get onto her own website.  So I just put her in as an adult and <br/>
said if she got e-mail that said &quot;XXX&quot; or &quot;Penis&quot; she could just delete <br/>
it--that&#39;s what the rest of us do.<br/>
<br/>
Once one of my kids or one of their guests had pulled up some porn stuff.  <br/>
Once in several years doesn&#39;t bother me much at all.   Kirby was reading some <br/>
fan fiction that had some sexiness to it (not slasher craziness, just <br/>
romance).   When I were his age, &quot;Man with a Maid&quot; had already made the <br/>
rounds of our group, and *that* is some nasty stuff.  I lived.  <br/>

<br/>
Pardon me.  I didn&#39;t say any of the things you just<br/>
attributed to me, below.  Sorry.  A mistake somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m am sorry, too, that you have had so much trouble<br/>
in you body and spirit. I do not wish ill health and<br/>
pain for you. It must have been more than painfull to<br/>
have to part with a child and make contact again. It<br/>
seems your heart has been broken in more ways than<br/>
one. <br/>
<br/>
We all wish,pray, intend for you to find peace and<br/>
healing for yourself and your family.<br/>
