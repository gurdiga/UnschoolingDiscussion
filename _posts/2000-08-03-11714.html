<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574283063">Hey Kim,<br/>
<br/>
What you are describing sounds like you have to &quot;de-school&quot; them.  Have you<br/>
read  &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;.??.. your girls might be ready  to<br/>
read that for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I read it twice and now I gave it to my 11 year old to read so he can<br/>
understand the unschooling way better--in terms of options and ideas.   .<br/>
We have always been child-led but for my kid...he needs some direction.<br/>
This year since he is technically doing upper middle school /high school<br/>
level work , I told him we would be more hands-off.  It will be more<br/>
directed my him as to what he wants to study.<br/>
<br/>
Each year I have him sit down and do a list of things he might want to<br/>
investigate or study..... we don&#39;t stick to it but its a starting point.<br/>
When we run out of ideas or get bored we try to remember what was on the<br/>
list to see if its sounds interesting or not and go from there.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime,,, we just &quot;live&quot;  !!!!.  Between activities, the dog, the<br/>
house, the shopping, the meal prep,visiting our friends, volunteer work,<br/>
the laundry, field trips and our huge appetite for books and  going to the<br/>
library....<br/>
<br/>
We have been mostly &quot;unschoolers&quot; for years but have in just the past few<br/>
years gone to a more text approach for math only.<br/>
<br/>
It takes time to come up with your own family&#39;s rhythm.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
